I'd been here a couple times in the past and received the pasta cookbook last year, so I'd been craving exciting pasta for a while. We did the tasting menu with a couple glasses of wine and everything they served was delicious. None of the pastas from the tasting menu were available a la carte, so I was expecting something delicious and they delivered.\n\nIt's not just about the pasta itself here - the sauces and accompaniments are just as interesting as the pasta itself. Tortellini in broth with speck seemed un-assuming but was was spicy, hearty, and probably my favorite dishv. Everything they served was top-notch though, and I left full.\n\nThe service could have been a little better. Everyone was friendly, but we found ourselves waiting a lot between courses, sometimes while also waiting for refills on our wine. That wouldn't stop me from coming back, but what could have been served and ate in 90 minutes took more like 2.5 hours.", "author": "Tmon B."}

Expect the table next to you to hear your whole conversation and vice versa. The service started out great but slowly declined. We had to ask for water twice and eventually when we were ready to go, someone entirely different closed our bill. \n\nThe food was all very good and extremely rich.

The pasta is not good. This is coming from an Italian. We had the pasta tasting menu ... $75 is way too much for this place when service is lacking, there is one bathroom, and there is not good food. The pasta sauces were bitter and it left me not wanting more. The pasta with beets was extremely bitter and trying too hard. Sometimes simple and classics are best.

Overall the meal was excellent.\n\nTHE WAIT: None for three + a baby on a Thursday night at 6pm. Granted, this was during Burning Man so the city was overall pretty empty!\n\nTHE SERVICE: Friendly and attentive.\n\nMUST-HAVES: Heirloom tomato caprese (starter), Tarleggio scarpinocc (pasta), Chocolate budino & Blackberry polenta cake (desserts).\n\nTO START\n* Heirloom tomato caprese ($17) - 4.5 stars\nSo simple, and so delicious. Fresh chewy mozzarella, lovely perfect tomatoes. \n\n* Vitello carne cruda (veal tartare $16) - 4 stars\nTheir bread is always amazing. The tartare had good texture and subtle flavors. \n\nPASTA\n* Tarleggio scarpinocc ($20) - 4.5 stars\nNice mix of balsamic & sweet flavors. My favorite of the pastas we ordered.\n\n* Heirloom corn tonnarelli ($21) - 4 stars\nLovely texture to the pasta. Heavy savory flavors, especially from the ham. I think this could have used more corn.\n\n* Jimmy nardello farfalle ($23) - 3 stars\nMore spicy than I expected, and overwhelming sourness to the flavor. I didn't enjoy this very much.\n\nDESSERT\n* Chocolate budino ($10) - 4.5 stars\nI've had this several times and it never disappoints. Definitely heavy, dense, and rich. I don't usually love coffee but this was nicely balanced with the dark chocolate flavors.\n\n* Blackberry polenta cake & lemon gelato ($9) - 5 stars\nWOW, this was the best dessert I've had in a long time. The cake was super moist and had a subtle gritty texture from the polenta, which I loved. This was paired perfectly w/ the coconut crema, lemon curd, lemon gelato, and fresh blackberries.

Skip some of the other dishes (see below).\n\nI heard about this place two years ago and finally managed to drop in for dinner on a weekday. Walk-in wait time was estimated to be 30 minutes, though we were seated in 20. The restaurant has a funky vibe - decorated like an upscale Italian restaurant with a half-open kitchen and bar, but blasting upbeat energetic music that at first feels out of place but then becomes part of the ambiance.\n\nFood:\n-Country bread (4 stars) : super fresh and well-made bread. At $5, it's not something I'd order at most restaurants but to my bf's point, if we're already spending $60 for the meal, might as well spend another $5 for bread. I do wish I had saved some of it for the pastas so I could have mopped up all the sauce.\n-Calamari starter (3.5 stars): very unique dish. I would have never thought of \"squid ink soaked croutons\" myself, but that's why I come to restaurants like these. The dish was a bit saltier than I would have liked, but did combine flavors in a new way.\n-Taleggio scarpinocc (5+++ stars): While the first dish on a list of pastas is usually the most plain, we were blown away by this dish. The sauce tasted like pure butter, and came with a drizzle of balsamic that complemented the creaminess of the rest of the dish. The pasta itself was cooked perfectly too. I literally used my fork to scrape up every last bit of the sauce. \n-Butternut squash ravioli (2.5 stars): After the other pasta dish, this one was underwhelming. I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce that was chosen - it had muddled flavors that were hard to place. Also, capers can be overwhelming - and in this dish, that was the case. Would not order again (though also I think this item rotates out of the menu).", "author": "Helen Z."}

All in all I left spending under $90 and was full and content and very satisfied.  I sat at the bar as reservations are tough to come by but did not feel squished or uncomfortable at all.\n\nI began with a complimentary amuse bouche of arancini with a soft, oozing inside.  Next came the crudo with avocado puree and shishito pepper.  Nice summery dish that opened the palette.  Interesting texture but nothing too memorable about the dish as the pasta is what you come to Flour + Water for.  The summer triangle pasta was interesting and had a thick taste.  Very fresh and hearty.  The tomato tortellini was my favorite dish of the night.  The soup base had a spicy, gazpacho flavor and tortellini popped with each bite.  The fennel and rabbit could have been an entree from its size and and from its hearty flavor.  Very good dish recommended for all.  The final pastas came together as they both featured fig in the ingredients.  The duck was soft and wasn't gamey at all.  The kale with pork had a soft and healthy flavor and was super easy to eat even after 4 courses.  The final dessert course of lemon gelato was the perfect palette ender.  Scoopable and more or less inhalable all at the same time.\n\nReally nice place overall.  Tee memorable aspect of the meal came from the sheer quantity mixed with the easily seen and tasted pasta quality and presentation.  The bartender was mentioning they sometimes offer half pastas as well which I adore to help experience multiple dishes at a restaurant, taps style.  Parking can be tough, but besides that there is nothing bad about my meal.  Make a reservation and go here as soon as possible.", "author": "Zachary A."}

I like to try out new places and cuisines as much as possible. But Flour + Water is one such place that I've already repeated a few times and will continue to do so.\n\nThe first and most important important tip would be to make prior reservations. The wait will be quite long if you show up without it. It's a small, cozy, dimly lit place - perfect for dates, candlelight dinners.\n\nTheir menu changes on a daily basis based off of fresh produce that they get everyday. So be rest assured that every dish on the menu is going to be fresh. Not just that the dishes are also unique in flavors. The PASTAS are unlike what you will find in other Italian restaurants. They may not be authentic, but they are definitely different and full of flavor. \nThe MARGHERITA PIZZA is a staple on the menu and a must have. The pizza base is very light and the toppings are just delicious.\nThey've also got a pretty good wine selection.\n\nThe servers are very polite and helpful.

I have the vegetarian tasting menu and was blown away by every dish by the flavor combinations, even if I did not personally like one or two.  At $75, it's honestly a bargain compared to everything else in the city.  Make a reservation ASAP though otherwise come ~ 15 minutes before it opens and wait in line.  \n\nThey gave me am amuse bouche of a green garlic arancini to start, which was a tad on the salty side which I don't necessarily fault since there was a rich cheese sauce on the bottom to accompany it (cheese is by nature, salty).  \n\nThe first course was an appetizer salad of ricotta salata with melon and avocado - never had melon in a savory course before but it worked beautifully!!!  \n\nThe most creative pasta, IMO, was the bee pollen, honey, turmeric, carrot cappellatti.  I thought it was an ingenius mix of flavors that married well together, but it just wasn't for me.  I particularly loved the canneloni which was far superior to normal cannelloni that are tomato based with ricotta and taste so, so bland.  The flavor today came with a sweet corn puree with an eggplant stuffing - loved the sweetness of the corn puree.  \n\nThe tasting menu finished with a lemon verbena gelato - at first when I read this I thought \"wow, this is SUCH a boring dessert given the previous 6 dishes why don't they do something more creative?\"  but by the time I got to eating the gelato I understood - it really wrapped up the entire meal together.  Having 6 (?) pasta dishes consecutively makes for quite a carb-heavy, rich meal.  The gelato was very refreshing and light that cut right through everything and brightened up the palette.  If they had given a heavy dessert, I bet I'd have fallen asleep but the gelato actually gave a bolt of freshness and energy!", "author": "Melody L."}

It was $75 per person and came out to $97 after tax and tip - definitely a bit pricy. I did like a few of the dishes though so it might have been better choosing our own from the a la carte menu. \n\n * FRIED RISOTTO BALLS: This was complimentary and not actually on the tasting menu. It was good! There was some kind of citrus-y sauce that balanced well.\n\n * HALIBUT CRUDO: dressed with charred citrus, fennel, pickled onion and chili oil. This appetizer had so many flavors going on. It was light and acidic with a punch of spice at the end. The chili oil was a strange combination though...\n\n * TALEGGIO SCARPINOCC WITH ACETO BALSAMICO: no idea what any of these words mean but it's by far my fav dish of the night! The balsamic dressing was perfectly lightly salty and sweet, but the pasta itself was definitely the highlight.\n\n * SQUID INK CORZETTI WITH SWORDFISH, ENGLISH PEAS & ARTICHOKE:  Nothing really special but I appreciate the texture of their handmade pastas.\n\n * SALUMI TORTELLINI EN BRODO: Salt on salt... the soup was way too seasoned and the tortellini could have had more stuffing inside. I definitely would not order this on my own.\n\n * FARRO AND SMOKED HEN CANNELLONI WITH MELTED LEEK, MEDJOOL DATE AND NASTURTIUM: I wasn't really impressed with this dish..it tasted like something I could have bought at the frozen food section of Safeway. The dates did make it better though.\n\n * SPRING ONION AND BEEF RAVIOLINI WITH FERMENTED TURNIP AND HORSHRADISH GREMOLATA: decent but nothing to write home about. The fermented turnips were an interesting touch. \n\n * BLOOD ORANGE SHERBET WITH STRAWBERRY AND BLACK PEPPER: this was pretty refreshing and a good way to end a carb heavy meal.\n\nEach dish also took a while to come out, although the servers were very nice and attentive.

It's all good if this Pizza I was waiting for was worth all the trouble, but!!!! the Margarita pizza was burnt. Not crisp, not thin crust well done but, The crust was extra charred that you can scrape the pitch black burntness of it and tasted like I was eating pure coal. \n\nAlso, might I add that the restroom was extra toasty.

I came without a reservation around 25 minutes before opening, and got seated at the bar when the restaurant opened. There was quite a line when the restaurant opened so if you don't have a reservation and plan on walking in you should get there at least 20 before it opens. I ordered the taleggio scarpinocc (pictured) and the gnochetti sardi. Both of the pastas were great, but the taleggio scarpinocc was my favorite. It's delicious and I highly recommend it! I ended up skipping dessert, but I plan on coming back as soon as possible, so I'm sure I'll try the sweets someday. I also want to emphasize that the service here is incredible. My server, Elizabeth, was very kind and attentive, and she even patiently walked me through the menu. She made my experience an 11/10. Thanks for the great meal team F+W!", "author": "Vanessa W."}

What's the secret to Thomas McNaughton's flagship restaurant?\n\nIt's the handmade pastas made everyday on site, using the best seasonal ingredients California has to offer, the easy to understand wine list and the neighborhood feel of the casual, rustic restaurant. \n\nWe wanted to save ourselves for the pasta that's been praised by many, thus skipping appetizer and not ordering pizza. (Although, you should try one of their wood fired pies if it's your first time) We munched on their dark country loaf bread and while waiting, I enjoyed a glass of Campi Flegrei Falanghina ($14) with its bitter orange aromas and nice minerality. Know that the wine list is very overpriced, since I found a bottle online for only $19.\n\nI eat with my eyes first and when my pasta arrived, I could see it was worth the wait. The Gargati with braised collard greens, pancetta and hen cracklins was to die for! Wonderfully rich, salty, bitter and creamy, the flavor combinations are so comforting. I can easily make this dish at home, I just need to get my hands on some cracklins. His maltagliati with braised porcini mushrooms and lemon thyme sauce was quite the opposite of my dish. Much lighter, brighter and healthier than mine ;-) . The quality is top notch and you pay for it for such a small portion. \n\nDinner didn't feel complete without a sweet ending and the understated chocolate budino with espresso cream and sea salt proved to be mouthfuls of ambrosia. \n\nIt's less challenging to get a reservation now than before when Flour + Water first opened, but a rezzie is still highly recommended.

I swear even if they had screwed up every other dish, the chocolate dessert would more than make up for it. But they didn't screw up anything which makes things even better. We ordered 2 full portion pastas and 2 half position pastas, but the waiter mixed up the order and brought out the 2 half portion orders as full portions. We only just mentioned this to her - she immediately went back to the kitchen, spoke to the chef and brought us full portions of all 4 pastas. We really like 3 out of 4 pastas vegetarian pastas. We didn't like the saffron pasta as much, it tastes like curry pasta. But like I said before, it does not matter if you served the BEST dessert in the world afterwards. I highly recommend this place!", "author": "Sharanya A."}

I've been on a pasta kick lately and while at a pasta class, the chef mentioned that Flour + Water was one of his favorite places. The SO and I walked in last minute on a Thursday night and were able to snag two bar seats last minute which was awesome. \n\nWe ordered the pasta tasting menu for the evening. Definitely great value because it's so so so much pasta. I was a little underwhelmed by how slowly the dishes came out though - e.g. the first dish is a medley of appetizers, but it took then over 45 min to serve that. I recognize that their nights are pretty busy, but it seems like a pretty long time post ordering to serve someone. \n\nThe pasta dishes definitely lended toward innovative fusion flavors that while interesting, personally didn't make the cut for me. When we went, the menu was: spuntini, raviggiolo cappelacci with matautake mushrooms, pine nuts and douglas fir, seaweed tagliarini with blistered sungold tomatos, agretti and uni, smoked hen tortellini en brodo with chervil and speck, lamb and jimmy nardello agnolotti with oregano breadcrumbs and tinkerbell pepper, water buffalo shank cannelloni with roasted eggplant, chanterelle mushrooms and nettles, and winter squash gelato with walnut butter cookie. \n\nLike I said, super, super innovative. But some dishes just felt like a bit toom uch or didn't quite work. E.g. the tortellini en brodo left my mouth wincing because of how sharp the oversalted flavors were. This was unfortunately a trend throughout the meal where I kept feeling physical pain in my mouth because of how oversalted the dishes were. I appreciate innovation, but not when core execution is misdone. \n\nOverall, value is great $75 to be super full and try lots of creative pastas, but sometimes I just want really classic dishes well executed, and to that extent, Flour + Water missed the mark for me but is not bad at all.", "author": "Jasmine X."}

But strangely, I think Yelp's current 3.5 star rating might be just about right.  Typically these trendy places with good service and hipster decor tend to do very well with the pseudo-connoisseurs and score undeservedly high scores.  Well, I think Yelpsters got this one right...\n\nLike I said, service was pretty good.  Our waitress was cute and very nice to us, and extremely polite and pleasant.  And also like I said, ultra super hipster all over.\n\nHere's the deal: the menu has more fancy-schmancy food-nerd over-the-top words than even the craziest of Michelin Star restaurants.  I dunno basically 1/2 of the words used, though I'm sure they're found in chef textbooks.  But yet... despite all the apparent classically-trained knowledge and supposed high-end ingredients, all the food tastes pretty standard actually.  Like really not that much different than Cheescake Factory tasting, but for 1/2 the portions and 1/2x more the price...\n\n1. Cappelletti Apertitivo Americano Spritz $12:  Sorry, can't remember if I liked this.\n\n2. Eggplant Caponata $8 \"with guanciale, sundried tomato & parmigiano reggiano\":  Tomatoes mixed up with a bunch of other veggies.  Tastes good.  Portions somewhat small, but it is actually a side-dish, so I guess the pricing is reasonable.  6/10\n\n3. Black Pepper Tonnarelli $21 \"with smoked lobster mushrooms, egg yolk & caproncino\":  I didn't order this, but I had a couple bites from it.  Kinda like a carbonara,... well, more than kinda.  Served in a tiny-ass bowl.  Hells no.  4/10\n\n3. Horseradish Leaf Fusilli $22 \"with braised octopus, early girl tomato, calabrian chili & gremolata\":  So, it's pasta with tomato sauce basically.  All that other stuff... well, I don't remember none of it.  Over twenty bucks.  And it's TINY.  Like 1/2 a medium bowl's worth.  ....yeah... nope.  4/10\n\n4. Lambchetta $32 \"with charred castelfranco, eggplant conserva & nepitella\":  Like a turducken but with lamb!  Not for the anti-richness folks for sure.  I just went to Cockscomb yesterday and had a pig's head split in half, and I would say that just about the only thing richer I've had in recent memory.  So, for that, it's LOVELY.  But alas, it's also falling apart and somewhat hard to serve and eat.  I did appreciate the crisp outer layer though.  But as I said, so uber rich, fatty, and good juicy lamb.  Very nice.  8/10\n\nSo, other than the lambchetta, nothing was all that impressive... well, except the price.  In a bad way.\n\n3/5\n\n#sanfrancisco #italian #italianpasta", "author": "Dean C."}

Perhaps my palate is unsophisticated. Perhaps I'm cheap. We had two appetizers, three pasta dishes, a pizza and a $5, five-slice loaf of bread. We left hungry. When we got the first pasta dish, we almost laughed out loud at the portion size. On average, each $20-$24 pasta plate contained 14 pieces of pasta. That's $1.42 per piece of pasta. Reviews of taste were mixed in the party. Some of us liked some dishes and not others. No one liked everything.\n\nAll told, the bill was $153 before tip, with only one $15 glass of wine ordered.

If I could only eat pastas and pizzas for the rest of my life, I'd probably choose to do that. (But I can't consume a whole lot of dairy so that couldn't ever happen. Boo!) \n\nFlour + Water is located on Harrison Street in the busy Mission District of San Francisco. We usually get there EARLY; like before the restaurant even opens. There's always a group of customers forming a line outside the entrance because of their popularity. (Make sure to get early reservations; like 2 months ahead would be good or else you're just hoping for other groups to cancel last minute.) Be prepared to drive around for a couple of minutes to find street parking there, especially around dinner time. \n\nThe exterior is clean and simple while their interior is woodsy and rustic. The ambience feels more like a place where groups of friends come together to enjoy a good meal. Yep, this place gives me the \"feels\" yo. This place is just cool. At Flour + Water, they offer a Pasta Tasting Menu in addition to their a l\u00e0 carte menu. I always opt for the regular menu because the other one just might have too much dairy in it. \n\nI would definitely give this place 5 stars if not for their poor handling of incoming guests when they open their doors. There's no one coming out to ask which group has a reservation and which are just walk-ins. There should be a separation between the two so there's no confusion when everyone tries to queue up in the same line. I hope they can improve upon this in the future. \n\nBacon Glazed Thumbelina Carrots : This was great. A good side veggie dish to go with all the carbs. But hey bacon-glazed anything is good. \n\nLeek Ash Chitarra : This pasta is actually green because of the leek color. It was a great contrasting color against the yellow yolk. Of course the yolk was jelly-like and delish. This was a pretty rich and creamy pasta because of the cheese on top and sauce on the bottom. If you're not into rich pastas, then this isn't the one for you. \n\nUovo Pizza : If you are a lover of burrata, then this is the pizza for you! They pile mountains on top so you definitely won't miss it. The chili and farm egg mixed with pancetta was perfect. It wasn't too spicy at all.", "author": "Julie W."}

If I'm trying to come to this place for a while but I know you need reservations ahead of time and we wanted to wait for a nice occasion. We came here and Wednesday night and it was absolutely packed, the earliest reservation we get wasn't until 9:30 PM! So definitely plan ahead if you want to try this place out.\n\nThe ambience is romantic and candle lit, perfect setting for an elegant restaurant or nice evening out. The appetizer was incredibly delicious! We got the asparagus on the menu which was drizzled with the delicious cheese sauce and bacon bits. For our meal, we order the nettle & artichoke casoncelli and maiale pizza. These paired with a delicious wine made for incredible meal.\n\nThe nettle & artichoke casoncelli is basically like a ravioli in the shape of a gnocchi and is fully stuffed with delicious ingredients! I have to say this is my favorite thing that I ate from the menu all night. It tasted like some sort of delicious meat inside and the seasoning is delicious an indescribable! The only thing I can say to you is you definitely have to try this out if you're torn between what kind of pasta to get. The stuffing in the sauce makes this definitely worth a try, it was recommended to us by the server as one of her favorite types of pasta on the menu.\n\nThe maiale pizza was incredibly unique and was also recommended to us by the server. It is a delicious pizza with fresh vegetable seasoning on it and incredible aged, savory cheese to top the pizza. It has garlic and pieces of bone marrow all spread on top of the pizza which I love! Bone marrow is one of my favorite things to eat and I thought this was a really unique and incredible topping to put on the pizza.

I love doing wherever I go but at this place I really needed help knowing what everything is. We ended up going with the  agnolotti dal plin pasta which has no description and I had noooo idea what it was until the waiter described it.

Don't forget to ask for bread.\n\nThink a slightly more expensive Delarosa--similar menu style consisting of appetizers, small pasta dishes, and pizza, as well as some entrees.  \n\nPatata pizza ($18) - thinly sliced potatoes, bufala mozzarella, leeks, and Calabrian chiles.  Tasty, great combo, always love Calabrian chiles on pizza, but lacked sauce.\n\nMaiale pizza ($20) - prosciutto, arugula, cheese, tomato sauce.  Not a great mix of toppings, would have been better with an herby pesto or something other than the tomato sauce, and prosciutto was just thrown on top, which made it difficult to separate onto the separate slices.  Pass on this.\n\nWater buffalo bolognese tagliatelle pasta ($23) - slightly overly salty, but tasty and good portion of sauce to pasta.  Pasta is not al dente, which I actually prefer.  All pastas are small portion size for price, not enough for a full meal.\n\nBraised duck fusilli pasta ($21) - tender duck, tasty, well cooked pasta (just over al dente).  Just the short corkscrew pasta (not the authentic fancy fusilli).  I liked it better than the bolognese, but others I was dining with commented that it was just an elevated version of tuna hamburger helper.  I didn't grow up on that, so I was happy with the dish.\n\nSpigarello ($8) - small bowl of pan fried kale-esque greens with Calabrian chiles and some lemon--very good.\n\nChocolate budino ($10) - small pot of baked chocolatey sturdy creaminess with espresso cream and sea salt on top.  Nice mix of espresso and milk chocolate.\n\nOverall, nothing to go out of your way for.

The items with anchovies or bacon were definitely saltier than others, which is expected to a degree, but these were more than expected. I wouldn't say they would keep up from ordering them again, but don't order more than one or two if it isn't your thing.\n\nWe tried:\n-Fried squash blossom appetizer: so unique and delicious\n-Corn and crescenza raviolini with chocolate mint\n-Taggiasca olive rigatoni with whey braised lamb, fennel, anchovy\n-Smoked tessa (bacon) and egg yolk raviolo: these had an entire egg yolk in each one\n-Uovo pizza: their pizza is AMAZING. Loved the crust and flavors\n-Roasted duck: prepared perfectly\n-Parsley pappardelle with pork sugo, lamb's quarters, and early girl tomato\n-Additional pasta dish on the house to make up for our wait. Not sure what it was, but it was good!\n\nAmbiance:\nThe seating was comfortable and not packed in as some eateries tend to be in SF. We really enjoyed the playlist (which they print and share at the hostess desk, which was pretty cool). The must was a little loud so it made conversation strained sometimes. The lighting was also very low, which made us rather sleepy given our late reservation and carb coma :)\n\nService:\nWe had a reservation at 8:15 (make through Open Table; it's hard to get a seating at a decent time so check early!) and were informed upon entering at 8:05 that they were running 20 minutes behind. We were actually seated close to 9, but not at the fault of the hosts. They informed us they had to remind the previous party that others were waiting. To make up for this they graciously brought us 2 pasta dishes on the house. \n\nOur only complaint is that the service realllllly slowed by the end of the meal. While we appreciated time between courses, we felt we were waiting pretty long between the last few and then had to find someone (not sure where our waitress went) to ask for the check. This normally wouldn't have been a problem, but due to the seating delay and the extended waits between courses, our meal stretched until 11pm.", "author": "Susan G."}

We got back to our apartment and waited a bit before they texted us that a seat was ready. We went back hoping for a table, but got a corner seat at the bar for the three of us. At least we were angled towards each other, so that worked out fine. \n\nThe bartender was nice, we got some glasses of wine. We really just wanted to taste a few different things, so we shared this ricotta tart that came topped with asparagus and black truffle mushrooms (there weren't very many of them). Very creamy, yet light. Then, we shared the salsiccia pizza, which came with sausage & leeks. The pizza here is very interesting, the crust is bubbly and crispy at the same time, but the dough itself is a little soft. I could have stood for a more crispy crust to be honest, but I loved watching the chef make the pizza, as I could see into the kitchen & beautiful pizza oven from the bar. Lastly, we split the smoked duck tortellini. Was very happy with the quantity of tortellini's as fancy Italian places like to just give you a few. You could tell the pasta was homemade.\n\nIt didn't quite meet up to all the hype, but then again, we didn't do the tasting menu and we were happy with the food and dining experience overall.", "author": "Emily A."}

And I honestly don't know why I keep coming back. Most of the time, it is because friends/co-workers want to come and I tag along. This place is nothing special, believe me. Le bf loves this place though.\n\nI've always made reservations to come here. The idea of sitting at a communal table or waiting forever for a seat at the communal table doesn't sound fun to me and seems like a huge waste of time. I remember the first time le bf tried to get reservations, it was tough. This was one of those places where you made reservations exactly 2 months out (or was it 1 month out). \n\nWhat I have learned about this place over the years:\n1. Majority of dishes are overly salty. \n2. The servers as snooty and un-attentive. You can never flag them down when you need them.\n3. The food coming out of the kitchen can sometimes take more than 45 minutes for 1 dish.\n4. The dishes aren't anything special. Feel free to go elsewhere for homemade pasta and pizza\n5. This place isn't cheap, and the food doesn't necessarily match the price. \n\nThe menus do change a bit, but what has always remained constant is the bad service and the saltiness of food. They also don't seat you (even though you have a reservation), until your full party has arrived, even if there are a ton of empty tables. I have never had a dinner here where the service was passable. I can never flag down a server when I need them, and I definitely couldn't find them to ask why it took 45 minutes to get a dish of pasta. The food is always on the saltier side. For example, if I ordered 7 dishes that night, 6 of them would be too salty. \n\nReally, do yourself a favor, and don't come here. There are better pizzas in the city and better pasta places. I think that if you've never been here, it might be worth coming once just to say you've eaten at Flour + Water, but don't expect the service to be good or the food to be that good. \n\nPro tip: If you are wearing dark pants, DO NOT use the cloth kitchen towel napkins that are provided. They will shed all over your dark pants and you walk out with a ton of white lint on your pants. Not cute.", "author": "Carolyn Z."}

The meal was solid, and I highly highly recommend the wine pairing.  Many uncommon wines that still complimented the dishes well.  Great value.  The wine pairings must have been selected by someone who loves wine and loves sharing their knowledge. \n\nIt was a LOT of food, and I wish we hadn't finished the portions for the first few dishes.  One of the major positives of coming here is that the pasta is consistently cooked to perfection.  Efficient and friendly service.  The guys working behind the bar were awesome - both having a good time and ensuring their guests did as well.  \n\nWe waited 30 minutes for a table and ended up being seated at the bar, which is not comfortable, particularly for a longer meal.  We arrived on the later side, so there were several empty 4-tops, which I guess they wanted to be available in case larger parties came in.  \n\nMeal\n1) Spuntini / Snacks: poached or smoked salmon (don't remember) with  corn and columbine flower (or some other kind of flower) - very enjoyable.  Tomato preserve + corn and also something else and toast.  Sparkling Garganega blend for the wine.  Overall:  4 /5 stars\n\n2) Lobster mushroom cappelletti with huitalcoche and corn:  Perfectly chewy pasta with funky and bright flavors, not too heavy.  Paired with a Sciaglin, a fresh, smooth white wine, slightly floral / aromatic on the nose, one of our favorites for the night.  4 / 5 stars\n\n3) Spaghetti with salmon conserva, heirloom tomato, blue lake bean and chili.  The dish had a moderately strong fishy taste, which wasn't my favorite.  The dish had the perfect amount of chili, giving it a nice kick.  3/5 stars.\n\n4) Smoked hen tortelleni en brodo with sungold tomato conserva and opal basil.  WOW. \nThin, salty broth with strong summer tomato flavor, complemented by the savory / herbal flavor of basil (classic tomato / basil flavor combo but in a homey soup).  You then get the nice pasta texture, and then taste the smoked hen inside.  I'm having a hard time describing in words what the hen tasted like. It's little shot of incredibly tender meat, both light and rich at the same time, and a nice contrast to the bright, herbal flavors in the broth.   Paired with a macerated white / orange wine (Coenobium). 5 / 5 stars\n\n5) Duck cannelloni with summer squash, mouse melon, lemon cucumber and purslane.  Basically a duck taquito.  Not my favorite dish of the evening - felt there was too much meat in the dish (despite being very tasty / not too gamey at all) and not enough freshness / brightness contributed from the other ingredients. It wasn't bad, just not to my taste.  The Brachetto wine was our favorite of the evening.  3 / 5 stars\n\n6) Lamb and jimmy nardello agnolotti with oregano breadcrumbs and caproncino.  We were too full at this point to eat more than a few bites (particularly given how rich the dish was), but it was delicious.  The breadcrumbs were such a small detail, but they added a really nice grace note for the texture to the dish.  Barbera wine was a perfect pairing.  4.5 / 5 stars\n\n7) Flor di Latte gelato with stone fruit.  Incredibly delicious.  I would go back here just for the desert.  Mostaco d'Asti pairing (like candy in a glass).  5/ 5 stars", "author": "Holly P."}

It Ain't cheap and I think the total with tax, tip, that F$%#ing  SF health tax was $375. ( but for six people that is roughly $63 a person...and that is somewhat reasonable.\n\nAPPETIZERS:\n\nBaby lettuces with  fig leaf vinaigrette,  bodacious goat cheese & toasted hazelnut ....nice salad but perhaps the least impressive dish...under dressed.\n\nfried green tomatoes with pickled tomatillo, cucumber & ricotta . Great crunchy tomatoes with a silky ricotta....wish there was more.\n\nsalumi board with tuscan butter, peach mostarda,  gherkin pickles & ciabatta  GET THIS....everything was outstanding especially the tuscan butter and the peach mostarda....with the toast points....yummy.\n\nPASTAS:\n\nstradette with lobster mushroom, corn & perigord truffle: Every pasta dish was executed perfectly.....lovely marriage of mushrooms and truffles....although the truffles were a tad scant.\n\nrye radiatore with braised pork, mache & pickled mustard seed ...to me this is a magical dish.....that pork married with the radiatore.....is mythological. The flavor the texture....is just wow.\n\nwhole wheat bigoli with pancetta, cranberry bean & breadcrumbs. Perhaps the least appealing pasta....good none the less. It is a very unique spin on Bigoli....nice contrast of pancetta to cranberry with a crunch from the bread crumbs.\n\nPIZZAS:\n\nmargherita - san marzano, fior di latte, basil &  extra virgin olive oil  \n\nsalumi- san marzano, coppa, lemon thyme, arugula & parmigiano reggiano \n\nTheir Pizza's are somewhat flimsy and soggy yes....but I liked it and no one complained, Toppings are delicious. Good but not great.\n\nSECONDI:\n\nmixed roast of pork with charred red spring onion,nettle  & stone fruit relish  Great dish although a tad pedestrian...everything was executed well. The pork had a lovely cook to it and the flavor was succulent and tender.\n\nDESSERTS:\n\n\nchocolate budino with  espresso cream & sea salt ....MINE as in keep your spoons away. Dense salty chocolate....perfection\n\nzucchini cake with limoncello, red walnut & stone fruit mousse ....good but slightly underwhelming.\n\nWINES:\n\nF+W's wine list is a very nice currated list from mostly Italy ( which does not get the credit that California and France does). Wines are pretty reasonable and compliment the dishes superbly.\n\nOVERALL: I highly suggest trying F+W with the aforementioned expectations. \n\nI love the neighborhood and parking is pretty easy ( are rare commodity in SF).\n\nIf you read this review you are a yelp saint....Thank you!", "author": "David G."}

My two biggest complaints were that I was served a glass of wine with a floating piece of cork and that our waiter pushed us to over-order. Based on our waiter's comments, we had the impression that the main dishes must be more tapas-sized because he continuously expressed concern that we would not have enough to eat. \n\nFor a table of six, we ended up with six pasta dishes, a main course meat entree, two pizzas, two appetizers, and two sides. This was far too much food and made less enjoyable by the fact we did not necessarily want each of these dishes but had been pushed to order them. Not sure if the waiter was unfamiliar with the menu or angling for a bigger tip. The food itself was solid but the service could use some improvement.", "author": "Rhiannon O."}

The first thing you notice when you walk in is that there is a distinctive vibe. The music playlist was filled with \"feel-good\" music - peppy and recognizable songs (the music level did seem to rise as the night went on, just as something to note depending on the kind of evening you're looking for). The staff aren't restricted to any sort of uniform. They all looked comfortable and happy. We took note, throughout our evening, that the restaurant seems to encourage their staff to show their personalities while still providing an upscale experience - nothing about it feels stuffy or stifled. The diners are dressed casually for the most part. We were in business-casual, and were probably among the dressiest people there. It's very much \"come-as-you-are and enjoy the meal.\"\n\nWe chose to do the pasta tasting menu, which is a very reasonable $75/person (without wine pairings). Our waiter helped us choose a bottle of wine that would carry well throughout the tasting, and he did a phenomenal job. Each dish was a treat. There was a great range of pasta (all made from scratch), and you could taste the thought and work that went into each dish. The chef especially does a great job paying attention to textures, as pasta can sometimes fall into a texture trap. The dessert course was a wonderfully light strawberry sorbetto, which was the perfect cap to a carb-forward meal. None of the dishes were so heavy that we couldn't finish them, and we both left feeling satisfied but not painfully full. \n\nAfter the tasting menu, I absolutely want to go back and dine off of the a la carte menu. Everything about Flour + Water left us with a good taste in our mouths (literally and figuratively).", "author": "Amanda R."}

One quick glance at the lineup and we made the easy decision to do the vegetarian pasta tasting menu.\n\nWe were not disappointed. The highlights were the tagliatelle with smoked mushroom bolognese and the black truffle and sottocenere agnolotti da plin. We gobbled both of those dishes up like there was no tomorrow. We also loved the teleme with scarpinocc and the arancini they started us with. The salted caramel gelato was also fantastic.\n\nOn a side note, we had recently returned from a gluttonous trip to Italy and we feel that the pasta at this restaurant, at least for vegetarians, is on par with the best pasta we had there, and certainly more inventive in terms of vegetable use.

Lovely space and great service. We put our name down around 6:30 pm and told 1.5-hour wait (totally fine and expected) and I appreciated how kind the hostess was to ask if we were familiar with the neighborhood and wanted to some recommendations to get a drink. We ended up over at Pacific Brewing for about an hour and then our table was ready so it worked out well. Once seated, we knew we didn't really want to mess with anything but the pasta, which my friend has had before. We decided to splurge and just go for the pasta tasting menu plus wine pairing. Now onto the tasting - \n\n1. Sputini (little nibbles) with prosecco - Tasty mini arancini, crispy pork crackle chips, and pickled mushrooms. Pickled mushrooms were so tasty with the crackles\n2. Salsify caramel with fermented buddha's hand, whey & caviar - This pasta looked like large saltwater taffies. Caviar wasn't overwhelming and flavors were light creamy - 3.5/5\n3. Charred leek & diver scallop tortellini en brodo - Tortelli in a salty beef broth - Tortelli had almost no flavor in our opinion and then beef broth kind of over compensated - 1/5\n4. Duck cannelloni with celery root, pickled cipollini onion & hedgehog mushroom - Awesome, delicious and would get on its own. 4.5/5\n5. Carrot & rabbit cappelletti with tessa, fermented leek salsa verde & bearss lime - This was my favorite by far. Everything worked so well together and I considered ordering this dish again - 5/5\n6. Broccoli orecchiette with braised veal shank, calabrian chili & fermented spigarello - Again, great pasta dish, nice spice from the chili. 4.5/5 \n7. Dessert was caramelized apple gelato with molasses cake - Nice end to the evening, unfortunately, I am not a fan of the aperitif pairing (almost like a brandy or port) so we should have asked for a substitute as it was purely wasted money. \n\nOverall the portions were really nice for the tasting and I left really full. So why the three stars - I the tortellini was soo lack luster and paying that much for the tasting I hold dishes to higher standards. Our total bill came to ~$300 pre-tip. Doing the math, their pasta is $20 - $25 so if we would have ordered say 4 kinds of pasta to split and a $50 bottle of wine we would have been about $120 - $140 under our tasting bill so not really sure the tasting is worth it.", "author": "Aryn C."}

My husband and I couldn't land a reservation, so he arrived on a Friday at about 4:30 (an hour before they opened) and he was first in line. When they opened, we were given the choice of sitting at the bar or the communal table. We chose the bar because we could see the kitchen from there, and we love to watch the cooks work their magic. It's like dinner and a show!\n\nI won't get into detail of every course (pics explain what we had), but we had a stellar time. This was our second visit to F+W and we were just completely enamored this second time around.\n\nYou can taste the quality ingredients, and the time and effort put into their food. Watching the cooks, you see their hard work, and the detail they put into making sure each dish goes out perfectly. We both agreed that our favorite dish was the telem scarpinnoc with aceto balsamico. It was these candy wrapper shaped pastas with a butter sauce and balsamic, and mannnnn, I could have eaten 4 rounds of that dish.\n\nIf you can recognize superb level quality food, you will love Flour and Water. If Olive Garden is fine pasta to you, you just might not understand, and might end up being one of those 2 star, \"I don't get the hype\" reviewers. But I believe in you, dear reader.

The sauce was really good, almost like a thick soup.

Overall, it worked, caviar was a nice touch. \n\nTortelletti - 1/5, very salty and couldn't eat after having 3 of these. The broth was salty and I would try to not drink it.

I taste the pomelo pulps from this dish that lingers around my tongue.\n\nFrancobolli - 2/5, talk about acidic and salty. The lamb filling was nice, but the edges of the pasta is too hard. The fermented leek is strong so it's a love it or hate it.\n\nCavatelli - 1/5, salty, dough is too hard. The mushroom were part of the dough, the water buffalo is good but not enough. Too heavy and it's one of the biggest pasta dish out of all the tasting.\n\nGelato - 2/5 - not a huge fan, too sweet for me. The shortbread was just crumbs with crumbs of hazelnut. The same gelato came with the upside down cake.\n\nApple upside down cake - 3/5 - the cake was decent but not the best. Gelato I can go without.

Our waiter seemed frustrated with our group from moment one, when we weren't ready with our wine order on his first visit to the table. It was clear he was impatient and trying to rush us to decide on meals as well. He told us we shouldn't course out our order, because it was \"best to order all at once.\" Then, just before we did put in our full order, he told us he needed to \"go on a break,\" and that someone else would be taking over the table. Quite odd that a server would get a break at all, nevermind half an hour after the shift had started (we had an early seating, at 5:45pm). The waitress who took us on was not much more impressive. She seemed to stress that we weren't ordering enough (both at dinner, and dessert), though we were quite satisfied with everything we had. \n\nI was frustrated not only because the staff didn't feel welcoming or helpful, but also because my group didn't make a reservation 28 days in advance to be rushed out or criticized for not ordering enough, or in the \"right\" way the servers wanted us to.\n\nOne other small complaint is that the beer and wine list is just alright, and they don't do cocktails.

We ordered the agnolotti del plin and the beautiful pasta was filled with this tasty chicken and pork mixture. The sauce that it had on top was this nice, rich glaze. I actually wished I had more sauce. We also ordered the salsiccia pizza with an egg on top - it was cooked perfectly. The tomato sauce on the pizza was a bit too sweet for me so that threw things off for me a bit initially. But the other components on the pizza were nice. Next time, we'll probably just order pasta dishes and share so we can try more since we wanted to try them all initially!\nPut your name on the list and walk down to Trick Dog for a drink until your table is ready.

I must give thanks to chef Evan and his culinary team for the wonderful and delicious experience. I am sure to come again and again and again!!! \n\nTime to dive into the real reason why people actually read these reviews. Food! Food! Food! \nFlour+water is special in the menu department because it changes everyday, which is a great culinary experience for food lovers wanting a new experience and not-so-great for those that constantly want to have the same dish over and over again. So, rather than telling stories of the amazing dishes I had on the night of, I will talk about the love and time that went into preparing the dishes I had. I cannot say for sure how much time and love they actually put into the dishes but I can say that with every bite of perfection, I could feel the warmth called love. To justify my reasoning, they make their pasta in-house everyday! If that is not love and appreciation for delicious pasta than nothing is! \n\nOverall, words cannot explain how excellent both the food and service was. Only when you have experience it yourself for the first time can you really appreciate the finest pasta. If there is anything that I can say for sure is that I will be coming back for another round in the near future! \n\n\n\nTIP: Reserve your table a few days to a week in advance!

My co-workers' ravings about it, and the whole Steve Jobs' approval etc., made us really excited to try it. We went on a Sunday and got there 20 minutes before they opened and were second in line. Right when they opened, we were seated immediately and given our menus.\n\nOur waitress checked in right when we sat down and gave us our water pitcher and said she'd be back. We decided what to get right away to get our order in asap. Our waitress didn't come back for at least 15 minutes. I'm usually pretty patient, but that was a little ridiculous. The restaurant hadn't filled up yet (and never did when we were there) and we saw her around and she didn't seem terribly busy, but we could not flag her down. She ended up taking the orders of two other groups that came after us (seated also at the walk-in area) before she came over to us. She took our order and didn't even say anything, not even an \"Okay, what would you like?\" or even a \"Got it\" after we ordered. She seemed pretty irritated. She was that way towards us the entire night and wouldn't even smile or speak to us, but she did with the groups next to us, which was strange. \n\nIt was weird because we just put in our orders and didn't ask for anything complicated or for any extra things besides what we ordered (the other wait staff would give us our refill pitchers or clean up our plates after they were left empty by her for a good amount of time - they were fine, it was just this one waitress). I don't mind rude prompt service (e.g. my favorite Chinese restaurants), but rude plus negligent is a double whammy. We are really low maintenance people, so it really upset me that we were neglected and treated so rudely at a place that I've heard has great service. \n\nAdding insult to injury, our food was not great. We ordered a margherita pizza that was actually very good, except our crust was too burnt. I do like some dark brown or black on my pizza, but ours had too much black. Then, we had a couple of pastas and I like my salt (to gauge this, I love McDonald's fries), but we agreed that these were way too salty to even taste the sauces. I kept drinking water from all of the salt. You can tell that they know their s*** when it comes to dough and fresh pasta etc., but the heavy salt just ruined it all. \n\nI would have given it another chance if just the service was bad, or just the food was too salty and burnt based on what others have said, but it was just a non-ideal experience overall.

Service was a bit slow, but overall wouldn't keep me from returning; we did have to ask 3 different people for bread, which was very average and a little on the hard side.\n\nThe food wasn't bad, but considering all the hype surrounding this place, I expected more.  We ordered two pastas, neither of which was cooked al dente, and the patata pizza.  Both pastas were good, but I've definitely had better at places like Locanda and A Mano.  I think I was mostly put off by the fact that the pasta was overcooked.  I did like the fact that most pastas can be ordered in half portions, which isn't advertised, but is something you can ask for.  The patata pizza was the standout item for me and I thought that even the crust was pretty good. I would compare the quality of the pizza to that of Delfina, which I love.  Given that I can get similar pizza at a place that doesn't take forever to get a reservation and better pasta elsewhere, I don't think I will return, but am happy I tried it.

It's been a a couple of days without a response from their team, so I think it's fair to publish this review. \n\nIt was our first time to Flour + Water and we did have high expectations of the experience given their reputation as a cornerstone of San Franciscan cuisine. \nMy friends and I chose to start with a salumi pizza to share and were excited to enjoy the pasta tasting menu, which came highly recommended to us. \n\nThe first few courses blew us away-- we thought the salumi pizza was perfect, from the toppings to the consistency of the dough. The spuntini was an unexpected combination of pork and mushrooms, all of which were robust in flavor and texture. We thought the first two courses of pasta (salsify caramelle and scallop tortelletti) really lived up to the unique Flour + Water flavor that we were so excited to try. \n\nWhen we were brought the 5th course--the carrot and rabbit cappelletti--we were shocked at how salty the dish was. Since all of the previous dishes were so phenomenal, we collectively took another bite. The rabbit filling inside of capelletti was so overly salted that you could not taste any of the actual protein. When our server asked how the dish was, we let him know that we felt it was over-salted. He tried to diagnose the dish--suggesting maybe it was the bacon within the rabbit filling, or the salsa verde garnish, and then graciously offered us a new serving but we decided to move on to the next course. \nNOTE-- I was not able to taste any bacon flavor because of how salty the filling was... and bacon is a very distinct, easy to recall flavor. \n\nThe last course of pasta was the broccoli orecchiette with braised veal shank. \nAs soon as we tasted the orecchiette, our entire table fell silent. It was also tremendously over-salted. It was completely inedible. As a diner, you never want to have an experience which results in sending a dish back, let alone two dishes in a row back. \nWe all tried to take another bite as the server came back to our table to check on us. \nI will admit that I was embarrassed to have to again let him know that we all found the dish to be salty. Our server was very apologetic and let us know that he wanted to ensure that we were happy with our food given that the tasting menu is supposed to be the premiere dishes of the restaurant, and immediately took the plates back to the chef for us. \n\nWe were then told by the maitre d' that the chef had tasted the dish himself and didn't think it was salty. I understand that palettes can different from person-to-person and that flavors can be complex. Our entire table felt that the dishes were too salty. \nThis was not about an exotic spice, or new unknown vegetable, or unfamiliar protein flavor profile. \n\nThe last two dishes were simply over salted. \n\nTo the point of not being able to taste any other flavors, in what seemed like very thoughtful, nuanced dishes. \n\nIt was very disappointing and frustrating experience to give honest feedback to the staff only to be told that the chef insisted the dish was not too salty. \n\nAll of the service staff were friendly gave prompt service throughout most of the meal, but the last two courses of pasta quite literally left us with a bad taste. \n\nThe maitre d' offered us different courses of pasta that had a more \"sweet\" profile which we were not interested in. To be clear, all four of us have an affinity for salty, savory dishes. It's not a matter of preference for sweet vs. salty. \nInstead, we settled on finishing with dessert, with an additional serving of the chocolate gelato and apple upside down cake. Both of the desserts that were added to our meal were delicious (with the candy cap mushroom ice cream on the cake being particularly memorable), but unfortunately we did not come to the restaurant for a dessert tasting. \n\nWe left the last two courses of the pasta dishes virtually untouched because of how over-salted they were. The bill came and we were still charged in full even though we only experienced 5 out of the 7 courses. \n\nSadly, I can not recommend F+W to anyone else.

A member of the staff (not the hostess) sat us in the far back corner of the restaurant that was more private and quiet. My dining partner and I love being in the action and have been waiting to eat here for a while - so we asked to sit at one of the other dozens of empty tables. \n= The man gave us a disappointing look and said 'where ever you'd like girls\", we sat at a table near the serving window and then proceeded to HIT THE TABLE at my friend to \"queue\" her to look at him and thank him. When she did not because we were put off by his behavior, he looked at my with wide eyes and gave me a look like \"You know what you've done wrong\"\n= We ordered sparkling wine to start the night off. We received flat wine and very nicely let our server know that the wine was flat. He then left us for about 10 minutes and contemplated with other staff members. He then says that we must simply not like the wine, and he will give us something else. He does not admit to us that we were served a flat glass, etc. We insisted that we would like that wine, but he refused and brought us out something else. \n= We then ordered the *RECENTLY PRICE INCREASED* pasta and wine tasting duo. \n= We were then served the SAME KIND OF SPARKLING WINE MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY, but this bottle was poured in front of us, and surprise! - was not flat. The waiter never admitted the bottle he served us first was flat, he just made us feel like we have 0 idea what we were talking about\n= The crudo course was served to us. The runner introduced it as \"trout,\" and the menu stated \"amberjack.\" confirmed with our waiter that it was amberjack..... \n= Last course was a lamb ragu cannelloni and on my second bite I found  A BONE! It was the size of a quarter and I could have easily choked on it. ..The waiter brought me out another course, as I simply did not want to eat the rest of the plate as I did not want to find out what else could be in there. \n= We did not receive the cookbook that the pasta menu states you receive if you order the pasta tasting. \n\nPSA: Our meal was not comped. We were given a few glasses of wine and another plate of food for the bone mishap (which should be expected in ANY restaurant, especially in a restaurant of their supposed caliber - lol)   \n\nI have worked at fine dining restaurants for 3+ years and could not believe the service, the food or the way we were treated. They were basically laughing at our experience, and then proceeded to ARGUE with my dining partner when we called and argued the next day. \n\nFor spending $300+, this place was ABSOLUTELY not worth it.

I would recommend stopping by early to put your name down and then go walk over to Valencia St to check out stores or get drinks.\n\nThe food was great. I would rate the pasta as the best dishes followed by the appetizers and then the pizza. My personal favorite dish was ravioli with roasted corn on top. We had a group of 4 and shared everything tapas style. I think that's the way to go because the dishes varied largely in size. For example, the pasta dish alone would not fill up most people but a pizza would have been too much for one person.\n\nThe service was slow so if you're starving, you are not going to be a happy camper.

Part of our party was late and they only seat you when the whole party has arrived which is kind of annoying because the rest of us would have been down to start with bread, but I do understand. However, the waiting area at the front is really small and crowded, and it's not like it's warm in SF so you can't really wait outside. Thankfully they didn't give our table away and we were seated as soon as our 4th person arrived.\n\nAmbiance- cute, trendy restaurant. Dimly lit, wooden tables etc. What you would expect.\n\nBread- pretty solid bread. I wish they would have been us bigger portions so we didn't have to keep asking for more, but it was definitely good bread.\n\nWine- we got a bottle of the Fattoria Di Gratena SangioveseCchianti for $45 (least expensive bottle on the menu) and it was actual really really good. It was slightly chilled but not as much as white wine, and went down super smooth. I actually took a picutre of the label because I want to buy it on my own. 5/5\n\nAppetizer- we went with the melon with ricotta which was meh in my opinion. It was very fresh but not super flavorful. My sister really liked it though. I would give it a 3/5, but she probably would have said 4.5/5\n\nThen we got the margherita pizza. AMAZING. 5/5. I'm always on the search for good margherita pizzas. This was definitely up there with my favorites in SF, along with Delfina's, Una Pizza Napoletana and Del Popolo. \n\nBetween the four of us, we got four different pastas. I'm not going to bother describing them all, because our waitress told us they change every day. They were all very interesting and rich in flavor, a little too much for me and had a lot of meat (veal or pork). The quality of the pasta was definitely delicious and homemade. If you like rich flavorful pastas with meat then I would definitely recommend coming here. If you are like me and like cacio e pepe the most, I would give the pastas 4/5 because they were still above average and better than most pastas I've had in SF.\n\nOverall- 100% will be coming back for the pizza.

The lamb meat was one of the best I have had - super tender and juicy. Sauce was very rich and tasty (my roommate said it was a bit salty but I think it was just about right) Agnolotti was super good, and with the combination of cheese and sauce it was really a memorable dish.

The filling was tasty though nothing spectacular, but the sauce was very unique. Not sure exactly what was in it, but it was rich yet strangely not heavy from some kind of citrus notes. Definitely haven't had a sauce anything like it.\n- Cresta de gallo with hen liver: This pasta looked like macaroni with a mohawk (Try googling \"cresta de gallo\"and you'll see what I'm talking about). This was by far our favorite dish of the night. I'm usually not a huge fan of the strong flavor of liver, but the hen liver added an amazing savory flavor to the perfectly al dente pasta that wasn't overpowering at all. And the sauce was so addictingly good! We ended up soaking the complimentary bread in the leftover sauce in the bowl.\n- Margherita pizza: Ever part of the pizza tasted so fresh, from the dough in the crust, the tomatoes, the mozzarella, to the basil. The crust was slightly charred on the edges, but I didn't mind this.\n\nAnd for dessert:\n- Chocolate budding with espresso cream & sea salt: I usually don't order chocolate desserts, but we gave this a try because it seemed popular.

I especially appreciated this since we had gotten engaged a few hours before and we were still a bit dazed by the whole experience. The staff was patient with us and helped us navigate the menu. I really wanted a good red wine and they brought me 3 wines to taste so that I could find the one I liked the best. They were just really good people. \nI can't recommend Flour + Water highly enough.

Initially made the reservation for a party of 4 but due to illness I needed to reduce it to a party of 2 with about 24 hours prior notice. Called the restaurant and they were very accommodating.\n\nWe had a 5:45 reservation on a Saturday and arrived about 5:40 to find a line out the door. I understand this is to be expected. Couldn't tell if this was just the line for everyone or only people without a reservation but considering the people in front of us had a reservation we just played it by ear. The line moved pretty quickly and we got to the front in about 5 minutes. \n\nWe were greeted with warm smiling faces and the staff seemed very friendly. We were quickly escorted to our table and began to review the menu.\n\nI came here with the intention of focusing on the pasta so we ordered:\n\ngargati with braised hen, yellowfoot mushrooms & pickled fiddlehead fern\nagnolotti dal plin\ncoal roasted baby carrots with caramelized honey, lemon thyme & hazelnuts\n\nThe plates arrived quickly and we dug in. I felt the gargati with the hen reminded me of comfort food. Like a bowl of chicken soup on a rainy day. There were a few pieces of skin or fat and gristle but otherwise the was ok. The agnolotti dal plin was a bit gamey, probably due to the rabbit. At first I didn't care for this dish but it began to grow on me. The carrots had interesting flavors but this dish was not cooked evenly. There were a few carrots which were under cooked. \n\nIt felt like they were really trying to showcase several different flavors in the plates we had rather than focusing on simple dishes. The effort put into the dishes was evident but some of the combinations seemed to miss their mark. We decided to skip desert as nothing was really jumping out at us and we still had a few morning buns from Tartine in the car.\n\nYes I would go back but I would try completely different dishes. The entire experience was less than an hour. I felt the prices were reasonable for the portion and quality of food served.", "author": "Jesse P."}

The thin Italian pizza, the well thought out appetizers, the array of interesting entrees, and the not too sweet desserts have always satisfied my palate. When I come here with my mom and sister we usually order 1 or 2 pizzas, 2 pasta dishes, an entree, a couple appetizers, and a dessert.

It's on a lonely corner, but already from the outside, you can tell this is going to be a great meal. The stylish wooden sign with the simple name of the place gives it away.\n\nThe inside has your standard modern wooden beams with inset lighting and a faux-rustic look. It is in the Mission, after all.\n\nWe really really really wanted to try the Prix Fixe menu, which had a delicious and interesting concoction of delicious pastas, seafood, and meats. However, we just weren't up for it tonight. Instead, we tried...\n\n1. Padron pepper rigatoni with braised pork shoulder and spring onion: Wow. The pasta was done to perfection. The pork was melt in our mouth soft and flavorful. Not too salty. Beautiful dish. \n\n2. Mixed roast of pork with douglas fir, chanterelle mushroom, and brussel sprouts: Is there anything in the name of this dish that you wouldn't have in a heartbeat? 5-star dish. The pork was done to perfection. The central slices were medium-well done, and the sides had fatty slices that were just amazing. This was over perfectly cooked mini-brussel sprouts and a smattering of the cute little mushrooms. \n\n3. Baked shelling beans with kale pesto, fior di latte, pancetta, and breadcrumb: This was a small side. It's a good and very creative dish. I would not have expected these ingredients to go well together, but they did. The pesto gave it a nice flavor and the breadcrumb a crunchy texture, which was a great contrast to the softer consistency of the baked beans.\n\n4. Chocolate budino with espresso cream and sea salt: We actually had to order two desserts because the main courses were so phenomenal. MUST TRY! Best chocolate budino I've ever had. The consistency and richness of the dark chocolate is mind-boggling. The light cream on top and a sprinkling of sea salt made this a sinful treat.\n\n5. Sweet corn bonet with caramel corn and blackberries: We weren't sure what to expect with this, but we were glad we ordered it. Such a creative combination, presented beautifully. The flan tasted like a regular amazing flan at first bit, but toward the end of the taste experience, the creamed corn came through. The crunch of the caramel corn was a great addition.\n\nOverall, the ambience and quality of the food was second to none. Prices were reasonable. Make sure you get a reservation.

We eat out every night unless we have a dinner party at someone's house or we host people at home. I'm a big time foodie and this place was just ..... meh. \nThen the waiter had to go home and he was polite and nice but did not introduce the new server.\nI am not sure how to say this although I'm a very direct person but the waiter who was running the food smelled horrible. I know is San Francisco and everybody is free to do whatever they want including not wearing deodorant, but it is a food environment which requires hygiene and that particular waiter with the long earring was not hygienic at all and the smell was very offensive. I understand chefs ask the waiters to not wear cologne so the fragrance does not interfere with the smell of the food but he took it to the next level and it was not appropriate. \nThen a female waitress showed up and she was pushy and on a rush to get out of there. I was not even finished with my pizza and was offering offering anything else.\nI asked for dessert menus and the smelly gentleman  brought them. The desserts were good, the coffee tasted good. The wine selection was decent and we picked a Sangiovese.\nOverall, a mediocre experience. \nWe are not cheap by any means. We dine all over the place and travel the world, but after the lack of good service by the waiters that took over when our original waiter left, they did not deserve more than 16 percent tip. \nAlso, the waitress came to grab the check because she really really wanted to leave. Again, inappropriate. \nFlour and water think they are \" so cool\" and they were probably good 5 years ago. NOT ANYMORE.\nGo to SPQR or Delarosa, both are amazing places for less money and better, professional and hygienic service.\nAnd Flour and Water is also not cheap.

The front of house was pleasant and very efficient, and I had friendly but unintuitive service throughout my time. I did wait around 45 minutes for a single seat at the bar, but it was a request I made so I could watch the kitchen. Plan on making reservations and be mindful this is an incredibly popular place. I started with a delicious caponata, and had I been more than one person I would have gotten a pizza as well. They change pastas daily, but the whey braised lamb rigatoni was wondrous. The duck was seared perfectly and I thoroughly enjoyed the creamed corn and fig set. Budino, whut?! It was a magical little chocolate pot of maldon salted delight, paired with a majestic Barolo. Red wine with chocolate? Do it. My only possible regret is not doing the pasta tasting which they offer with a wine pairing... but that duck was talking to me.", "author": "Karla D."}

This is my favorite restaurant in San Francisco.  We came here for an early weeknight meal. We were seated quickly, and our waitress gave us a rundown of the menu, and provided her recommendations. We selected one starter, three pasta dishes, and one entree, and I had a nice glass of sparkling wine to start. The dining room is small but well laid out, and feels open and comfortable. The art of the back wall, a mural of anchovies, is a nice touch. \n\nThe duck rillettes starter was pretty good, the cauliflower accompaniment might have been more flavorful than the little duck fritters themselves , so I might pick something else to start next time. \n\nThe pastas were the standout on the menu. The noodles themselves were perfectly cooked, with the perfect combination of tenderness and chew. The buffalo bolognese was simple yet sublime, the best pasta dish I have ever tasted. The sauce was meaty and flavorful, the meat and tomato and cheese perfectly balanced, and the pasta to sauce ratio was just right. The gargati pasta with hen was an interesting combination to try, a nice change from the usual red tomato sauce.  The stuffed pasta with ham (maybe speck) was also delicious, the delicate butter sauce allowing the flavor of the pasta and filling to shine through, but the bolognese was far and away the standout. The entree was tasty too, prosciutto wrapped chicken, but after the world class pasta, it paled in comparison. \n\nOverall, this is an excellent restaurant, we will be coming back, even though it's near impossible to secure a reservation, it's well worth booking far in advance to try the standout pasta dishes.", "author": "Arugula F."}

Sadly, much like Per Se in New York; these guys have become too complacent and the quality of their food was extremely sub standard.

The pasta tasting menu is a great idea to sample several dishes at the tune of $65 per person + another $40 for wine pairings.  \n\nOur table split ravioli, whole wheat linguine with beans, and a pepperoni pizza with added on egg.  Everything was excellent!  I typically don't leave my North Beach neighborhood for homemade pasta and Italian food, but I can proudly say that Flour + Water really crushed it!\n\nThe only complaint from one person in our party was that the whole wheat pasta was way too al dente to the point where she only consumed one bite.  I personally enjoyed the consistency of the linguine and was glad that it wasn't overcooked.   The ravioli was also al dente, but softer than the whole wheat dish.  Although we disagreed on the pasta consistencies, we all agreed that the pasta sauces were complex, unique, and right on target.  The pizza crust edges were oh-so-slightly blackened by the wood-firing. \n\nThe chocolate budino with sea salt desert was rich and satisfying! Go for it", "author": "Andrea H."}

I checked OpenTable last weekend and the F+W gods must have been on our side because we swooped in on a 7:30pm reservation just this past week. Other than that, I saw a lot of very late weeknight (excl. fri) dinner reservations available but for weeks later.\n\nWe found some residential parking nearby and got to the restaurant early. We waited several minutes for our table but I believe we got seated at just about our reservation time. It was busy but I noticed that the big table at the front was empty, probably for a later group reservation? \n\nWe knew we wanted to try a pizza and a pasta dish. We ended up getting both and and app so by the end we had no room for dessert. We chose: \n\n--Appetizer - Pork belly with cauliflower, pine nuts, rutabaga, sultanas and sage: This dish had a lot going on but each component came together in harmony. The sweet sultanas (which I recently learned are grapes) with the salty pork belly was perfect. Oh and I just love pine nuts. \n\n--Pasta - Duck agnolotti in a brown butter sauce: The little pinched pockets of pasta filled with duck were delicious and the brown butter sauce was rich and wonderful. I noticed that the fresh pasta was much more dense.\n\n--Pizza - Margherita: The crust was the best part. It was thin, crunchy and soft but slightly chewy. The cheese and fresh basil were key elements but unfortunately, the sauce was very underwhelming. I thought it was pretty bland and didn't add anything to the pizza. \n\nService was pleasant the entire evening.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-05-22", "description": "Flour + Water is one of the city's most polarizing restaurants. Though often maligned as overrated and overpriced, it remains one of the city's most sought tables. \n\nAs a rather frequent diner at Flour + Water, who's had some of his most memorable and disastrous meals here, I've quickly come to understand why this is the case:\n\n(1) Skip the pizza and stick to the pasta. There's a reason why most of the negative reviews focus on the pizza. One idea for a party of 2: Order a half potion of each pasta entr\u00e9e for half the price of the actual pasta tasting ($70/head!).\n(2) If you sit at one of the tables in the far back, prepare to be ignored by the waitstaff. We literally had to walk up to the pass each time to ask for a server.\n(3) The restaurant is DARK. Reserve for 7:30 p.m. (summer) or 6:00 p.m. (winter), so that the sun is setting just as you're leaving. \n\nIf you play your cards right, you'll be in for a delicious, enjoyable, and reasonably priced meal.\n\n- - - - - - - -  F O O D  - - - - - - - - \nThe menu at Flour + Water is seasonal and always changing. (Check the F+W website after 5 p.m. to see that evening's menu.) While the pastas are usually excellent across the board, I'd steer clear of the pizzas. NOTE: Pastas may be ordered in half portions. I highly recommend doing this if you are a party of 3 or fewer, so that you can try as many pastas as possible.\n\nSeasonal SALUMI BOARD ($18) (4.5 STARS)\nOne of the best salumi boards I've had, although it doesn't hold a candle to Bestia's. The luscious tuscan butter is delicious as always, as is the apricot mostarda. The rest of the board features a rotating selection of meats and salami, such as lardo, copper di testa, crispy trotter, finocchiona, and on one particularly memorable visit, an absolutely delicious foie gras torchon encrusted in sweet dates. My one nitpick is that they only give you 3 small slices of bread, although you can always ask for more. This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't so hard to flag down a waiter.\n\nPORK RAVIOLINI with Green Garlic, Pancetta, and English Peas ($3) (5 STARS)\nOne of my favorites. I'm often wary of ordering ravioli at fine Italian restaurants for fear of getting 2 to 3 small ravioli for $25. This portion, however, was generous and  delicious. The raviolini were basted in a fragrant, garlicky butter-based sauce. A must order whenever it's on the menu.\n\nCHERVIL CHITARRA with SQUID, Heirloom Tomato, and Calabrian Chili ($10/20) (4.5 STARS)\nChitarra is a variety of egg pasta similar to linguine in shape. The pasta was perfectly cooked with a zingy, just-spicy-enough sauce. It had a wonderful slight brininess to it from the seafood. The squid could have been more tender though.\n\nGARLIC CHIVE STROZZAPRETI with Braised Pork and Ramp Soffrito ($10/20) (4.5 STARS)\nSimilar to the Pork Raviolini in taste, the pasta were beautifully made and perfectly cooked as you'd expect at F+W. The kitchen was generous with the braised pork. You really can't go wrong with anything that combines garlic and pasta.\n\nDUCK CASONSEI with Brown Butter LIVERS and Rhubarb ($11/22) (3.5 STARS)\nOrdered this on one of my more forgettable visits. While the pasta itself was expertly handcrafted, the sauce was slightly off-putting. I love livers, but these had a distinctly metallic taste to them.\n\nSALSICCIA PIZZA ($18) (3.5 STARS)\nEver since I last dined at Bestia in Downtown LA, I've been craving Bestia's sweet and savory take on a Salsiccia pizza: a delicately baked white pie slathered with pork, honey, and ricotta. Unfortunately, while the crust on F+W's version is light, puffed up, and delicious -- it's worth nothing that I enjoy my crust slightly charred - the center of the pizza is comically thin. Ours was at most 2mm thick! The slices would flop even when bent into a curve. Moreover, there was nothing impressive about the flavor combination.\n\nMixed ROAST PORK with seasonal garnishing ($28) (4.5 STARS)\nWhile often overlooked, Flour + Water's Secondi dishes are not to missed. They're among the tastier meat entr\u00e9es you'll find at Italian restaurants -- and certainly among the prettiest ones (think flower garnishing). The Mixed Roast of Pork, a dish that makes it onto the menu about a third of the time, is my go-to entr\u00e9e. A duo of pork loin and pork belly, it was accompanied by two exception sauces.\n\nChocolate BUDINO ($10) (4 STARS)\nAnother case of heightened expectations. As I ate this all I could think of was the Salted Caramel Budino at Barbuzzo in Philadelphia. An explosion of flavors, Barbuzzo's budino pairs a chocolate crust, vanilla bean caramel and sea salt with a dollop of whipped cream. And for $2 less, no less! While Flour + Water's take is by no means bad -- it's velvety, rich, and bittersweet -- it's pretty one note by comparison.\n\n- - - - - - - -  P A R K I N G  - - - - - - - - \nStreet parking quickly fills up after 7 p.m. Plan 5-10 minutes for parking.

He decided to go with the not so prime time of 7:45 pm.\n\nHubby and I arrived a bit early.

Same sentiment with the short rib casoncelli (pasta pockets like ravioli) which included shishito peppers.  The pici pasta dish was the least enjoyable dish.  Even though there were tender morsels of braised duck up in there, I liked it the least.  \n\nThe sides of summer squash and green beans were just fine, but if I had to do it again, I probably would have skipped the sides, and gone with a salad antipasti or another pasta to share.\n\nOverall, solid pastas (don't waste stomach space on the pizzas), but the portions are eensy weensy, teeny tiny, so this definitely isn't a \"value\" dining destination.

I had heard so much about this restaurant and I don't know if my expectations were too high but I was disappointed with the outcome. I really don't understand all the hype about it.\n\nWe got there at 9pm and were seated instantly by our kind host. The deco of the restaurant was nothing special, I would have liked if there was more light. Our table was kind of ensconced at the back of the restaurant. \n\nWe decided to share 2 pastas and a pizza between 2. (Portions are small)\n\nWe ordered:\n- Smoked paprika & corn raviolini with ricotta: my favorite, very tasty. Loved the corn taste. \n\n- Parsley pappardelle with rabbit ragu, heirloom tomato & lamb: The dish was not hot when it arrived to our table. I though it wasn't as really as tasty as I though it would be, the flavors didn't blend together. Very disappointing.\n\n- Pizza: salsiccia- san marzano, pork sausage, treccione,  pickled shishito pepper & cal\u00e7ot onion. The pizza was fine, the pork sausage overpowered all the other flavors. Not better than any other pizzas I've had before. If you want good pizzas in SF go to A16.\n\nThe pizza came out really fast, maybe after 10 minutes since we had ordered it. As soon as we finished the pizza the raviolinis arrived and as soon as we finished the raviolinis the papardelle arrived. By 9:40 pm we were already out of the restaurant discussing what had just happened inside. Decided to go for cocktails at Trick Dog instead of having dessert. \n\nOverall, I would not return, I've tried many other places with much better pasta and you don't have to wait a month to get a reservation. This was an OK dinner.", "author": "Nicole R."}

The squid ink pasta was a little oily but good, the salmon sashimi appetizer was ok and the lemon farfalle was interesting.

But after about 30 minutes it was fine and we got seats at the bar.  I'd come back if there was a shorter wait.  Next time I want to try the pasta tasting menu!  There was a pregnant lady who came by herself to do that (badass).  \n\nThe service was impeccable.

Getting reservations was so hard that we celebrated her birthday 3 days late...but that's okay. \n\nAmbiance: Perfect. Small, intimate and dim with tons of candles everywhere. We loved it!\n\nDrinks: We went with a bottle of prosecco ($50 bottle, not too bad)- it was kind of oakey, not as sparkly as I'm used to, but still delicious! \n\nFood: I can't recall the 30 types of pasta I had that night (jk we had five types, but it truly felt like 30 plates after the fourth course), but I'll list the highlights. \n\n1st course: Amazing breaded olives that came with a side of butter and we asked for bread (don't forget to ask for bread, no matter how many courses you will be consuming that night -- this bread was one of the best I've had!). The olives were flavorful and paired well with the butter and balsamic vinegar (we requested this as well). The butter was a whole different story. What is this butter and where can I get a tub of it? Not quite sure how to explain it, but the whipped, light taste with some type of flavoring (possibly olive as well) was the best I ever had. My sister and I just used the butter on our bread and our pastas and finished the small serving of it before dinner even ended. Oops, sorry waistline. \n\n1st pasta course: The most simple pasta dish we ate that night, but my favorite. It was sort of like tortelini pasta stuffed with cheese, topped with salt and balsamic vinegar. The pasta was a little chewy (#authentic) and with a little crushed red pepper, it was perfection. \n\nThere were 4 other pasta dishes in the middle: each extremely unique and flavorful (ex. we had a tortellini soup, a mushroom spaghetti type pasta, and a pesto ravioli dish). \n\nDessert: Orange sorbet- rich and tasty but felt like a cop out - I've seen so many creative good desserts on other reviews / at other tasting menus that it just didn't feel like there was a lot of thought in it. \n\nOne other thing: 2 or 3 of the pasta dishes were extremely salty! Not sure if this is how the pasta is or if it was the day we went but both my sister and I had to add balsamic vinegar or eat very little of the sauces in the pasta because it tasted like extra salt was just added to the dishes. Unfortunate but didn't take away from the unique types of dishes Flour + Water created, especially for a vegetarian tasting menu. 3 stars for food, 1 star for creativity / service.", "author": "Anu P."}

After the slow start, the rest of the experience was perfect.\n\nWe ordered:\nCharred asparagus (absolute must)\nThe Triangoli (lemon filled pasta - so good, but very sour and is necessary to split)\nThe Ditalini with pork ragu (super flavorful and perfect to even out the lemon-y pasta)\nSalsiccia pizza (definitely order a pizza with lots of toppings - if you just go with the margherita, you won't get much on it)\n\nFlour + Water is a premier restaurant.

The smoked trout had celery with it.  Normally I don't care for celery, but the celery actually complimented the trout nicely.  They also smoked the trout well.  \n\nThe pasta with oxtail didn't work well for us.  The red wine infused with the oxtail was overpowering and ruined the dish in our opinion.  It was so strong that when we got our last 2 dishes, the flavor of the oxtail was still stuck on our tongues. \n\nThe pasta with clams and mussels were very tasty.  The pasta was soft and melted in your mouth.  The clams and mussels were fresh.\n\nOur final dish was cabbage, with bread crumbs, and pancetta.

The flavors of the cheese mixed with the cauliflower and meat were just a unique flavor combination. The pasta was thin and aldente.\n\nSalumi pizza- was pretty full by this point but the pizza crust was thin and chewy and the portions of meat and veggies on this pizza was spread evenly on each slice.\n\nI wish we had room for dessert but we will definitely return to try other things or repeat a few things :)", "author": "Tiffany L."}

If you've tried lately, you know that F+W has had no openings via OpenTable.  BUT! F+W knows this and they've set aside a number of tables for their walk-ins.  We showed up at 5 and when those magical doors opened, we were probably third group to be seated.  After getting comfortable, and perusing the menu a few times, we were told by our server that we should share items.  You know what sharing means: THE ABILITY TO HAVE MORE OPTIONS!  So, in all of its glory and tastiness, we decided go with the following:\n\n-Agnolotti dal plin: Little \"clouds\" or \"pillow\" looking pasta that was filled with beautiful pork shoulder, chard, and carmelized onions served with a light butter and lemon sauce.  The pasta was al dente, and served with shavings of parmesan on top.  DELICIOUS!  Who knew that a three word menu item would pack so many flavors.  This was one of my favorites of the night, and most definitely a \"must have\" item if you're there.\n\n-Tagliatelle with english peas, morels, spring shallots & ricotta:  Beautiful and citrusy and was a good change up from the agnolotti.  Again, the pasta here was what I thought made the dish.\n\n-Pizza! Which as it seems, changes daily.  The pizza we have was a white pizza with ricotta, green garlic, asparagus, and I think broccoli.  Like the tagliatelle, there was also a citrus element on the pizza too.  I think Brittny and I decided that the toppings on the pizza were OK, but the pizza dough and crust was to DIE for.  I suppose this confirms that I'm definitely more tomato sauce pizza kinda girl.  Anyway, I was glad we got this so as to quell any curiosity of F.O.M.O.\n\nBefore I go on, I should mention that all of this was paired with a glass of their Castaldi Francesca, Vespolina, 'Nina', Colline Novaresi DOC, Piemonte.  Highly recommended!  Bellissimo!\n\nSo, yes, we went for dessert, and yeah, we got two of them to share:\n-Naturally we went for the popular item: Chocolate budino with espresso cream & sea salt\n-And added another one for curiosity: Moscato baba with strawberries, mascarpone & butterscotch\n\nBoth desserts were amazing in their own respects, even though they were polar opposites from taste.  Personally, I think I enjoyed the moscato baba more, mostly because I enjoyed the fresh sorbet that came with the dish.  The budino was decadent and I really enjoyed the espresso cream that came with it.\n\nOverall, I thought that flour + water was a beautiful experience.  I'm so glad we had the chance to eat here without having to wait for a reservation, and were able to enjoy it on an awesome sunny Monday evening.

Filled with a variety of meats and cooked perfectly al dente. Not too salty - really good. If you choose to come here, please get this.\n- Rigatoni carbonara - sadly we had to send it back because we all couldn't eat it. Nothing about the flavors were carbonara-esque, and it was more of a creamy rigatoni than anything else. \n- Pizza with prosciutto and egg - this pizza was incredibly decadent and I'm not sure I would have been able to eat more than one slice even if we had started our meal with it. Mixed feelings here.\n\nOverall, I don't think this place deserves the hype, especially in a city with plenty of great Italian options.", "author": "Amy Y."}

It's really hard to find ITALIAN restaurants that can/will make pizza and pastas dairy-free. At least half the menu was an option for me and they didnt make me feel like I was a challenge. (Not usually the case, a lot of Bay Area restaurants have a \"no-substitutions\" rule. Like, sorry I literally cannot eat dairy, I guess I'll leave??) Our server made the effort to tell me before we left that I was always welcome and there would always be delicious dairy-free pasta for me to eat. \n\nThis place is perfect for a date night. It's warm and charming with a cool city vibe. Our server was really nice, not the quickest service ever, but the place was packed so we always assume there will be lags. \nHe recommended the perfect wine, best dishes and everything was delicious and worth the wait.

Seeing the color leave a residue on your palm, causing that itch to lick that blue or green off your skin (even though you know that there is no additional taste). Well, that is how I must begin with F+W. The staff was magnificent. The hostesses were SUPER nice and accommodating during the long wait. Once I took a bite of my pizza, there was no chance the quantity to wait ratio was going to be special. As soon as I picked up my first slice it ripped in half. Second slice the same. Soggy. So soggy. The pizza was as soft as could be. It was also somewhat flavorless. The cheese was terrific, but that is outweighed by the not so good sauce and mediocre crust. Flour+Water is a terrific date spot (for the rich of SF) and I'm sure their dining experience altogether (sans pizza) is great, but this just wasn't for me. \n\nDisclaimer: I'm from New York.

It's ironic now that I'm living in San Francisco to think it was in Miami Beach at Food & Wine's Sobe Festival where I met Chef Thomas McNaughton the Chef of Flour + Water. Looking back on it now, he was quite memorable at the time since he was probably 27 (quite young for such an accomplished chef) and from San Francisco. The fact that he was from San Francisco (where I was contemplating moving to from New York City) around that time may be why I remembered him or maybe the delicious food or his good looks. Probably a combination of the three! \n\nWell.... three years later, I'm now a SF local and Flour + Water is one of my favorite spots. I frequent it as much as I can, or as often as I can get a reservation which is every few months. Each time I visit I'm still in love with the delicious rich food, the laid back chill atmosphere and the awesome vibe Thomas and his team have created. \n\nA few of my favorite dishes on the Menu at Flour + Water include the below.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-03", "description": "Solid 4 star experience. I had high expectations, because I follow their work on Instagram. I couldn't get a reservation even a month out, so my party of 3 did a walk-in right when they opened on a Wednesday night and scored a great seat. The hostess and servers were all really down to earth, attentive and friendly. They offered a pasta tasting for $65, but I didn't get to try it this time. It seemed like a great deal, because there were more than a handful of pasta options listed plus a dessert and a glass of a dry Lambrusco. We ordered light this time but I would love to return and explore more of the menu.\n\nChicory salad with pine nuts, persimmon, ricotta with whey vinaigrette -3 stars. It was a nice light salad that was more of a refresher than a mind-blower. The flavors of the chicory and pine nuts stood out, but the few thin slices of persimmon were kind of lost & the ricotta was creamy but not the most flavorful. The roughage leaves were left very large, and the knives they have don't cut anything well. It made for messy eating by all of us which was entertaining. \n\nMustard Garganelli with braised pork shoulder and cabbage -4.5 stars. This was the table favorite. I came to this restaurant specifically for the pasta, and this dish proved to me that they have talent in the kitchen. The pork shoulder was tender and flavorful; the pasta itself had a beautiful crunch and snap from being perfectly handcrafted and cooked al dente; the mustard seeds added a beautiful acidity to keep the dish from being overly rich. Love the texture they added as well.\n\nLemon Thyme Cappellacci, beef polpettini, charred kale - 4 stars. Again, perfectly handrolled and cooked pasta that snapped with each bite. The meatballs were firm and seasoned nicely. This had a lighter acidity than the other dish but was just bright enough. There was a lot of fresh parmigiano reggiano on top, so the dish was a tad salty, but I'm a salt fiend.\n\nSausage broccoli rabe olive oil chili pizza -4.5 stars. The dough-OMG - this was possibly the best Napoli-style pizza crust I have ever had, and I've had many many all over the country. It was charred, salted just right, chewy, soft but supple, and omg wow. The combination of sausage and rabe is my favorite when I don't want a pure margherita and theirs was great. The base of the pie was very thin though, so it did flop under the weight of the sauce and toppings. I can forgive that because of the ring of outer crust though. \n\nApple tart with salted caramel ice cream - 3 stars. The tart crust was very crumbly like a lighter shortbread and wasn't that rich and flavorful. The apple filling was minced almost paste-like with very tiny apple chunks. Not too much texture. This was just ok.\n\nOverall, I had a great meal, and the pastas were just as good as I had expected. I regret not having ordered a third pasta that had a different texture since the 2 I ordered had the exact same mouthfeel (thin sheets rolled up into a tube or trumpet which snapped with each bite). The biggest surprise was the pizza. I can't wait to return to try more pastas and another pizza. Beer wine only. Communal table and bar seating open for walk-ins.", "author": "Catherine N."}

But I saw the 3.5 stars on yelp so I was questioning the recommendation...I should have listened to my gut.\n\nFirst we had to wait an extra 20 min for our reservations in a Sunday night at 830pm. Other reviews said there was several weeks to a month long wait for reservations, so I guess we should have been grateful for only 20 min.\n\nThe menu had an interesting assortment of options, many of which sounded good. I settled on the roast duck and a side order of the brussel sprouts. My friend got the crab pasta, and we shared the charcuterie board to start.\n\nThe charcuterie came first and I was surprised to see something that looked deep fried on it. The music was so loud that we couldn't hear the server explain the dish so we dug in. The fried thing I think was a salmon croquette. I enjoyed it the most (not sure how it qualifies as charcuterie though). The rest of the pork slices and terrine was warm and ok. Nothing particularly stood out, all mild in favor--which I don't normally expect from charcuterie, I like my charcuterie flavorful and cured tasting. Nothing on this board meet either of those criteria.\n\nThen our meals came. The crab pasta was excellent, very fresh and clean tasting without being overpowering a crab can sometimes be.\n\nMy lamb was almost bad. Somehow the chef thinks anchovie sauce matches with roast duck...Sorry it was disgusting (and I actually like anchovies). The lamb wad also partially undercooked, which made the meat chewy instead of soft. The skin was crisp, but the fat was not softened so was still somewhat chewy and opaque. So it also didn't have the nice duck taste. Completely disappointed with this dish.\n\nThe brussel sprouts were tasty, and was mixed with finely diced apples and capers. I was expecting more of a sweetness from the apples, and a contrasting saltiness from the capers. I couldn't taste either, except maybe both were embedded in the sauce...still a good dish overall.\n\nI definitely didn't think the meal was worth what we paid which is why I gave it two stars. It would have been three stars, if it wasn't also so expensive for what was served.

Lets just start out by saying, the menu constantly changes so don't expect the dish that you love will always be on the menu.

My favorite dish here is the Margarita Pizza! Omg I think this pizza goes on the top 5 pizzas that i've tried and I'm pretty picky. We also got the squid ink pasta as well as some other pasta that I can't quite remember. The portion sizes here are pretty small, but the pizza was def. the best bang for your buck. But all in the all the pasta was good. It didn't blow me away like the pizza, but I sure did enjoy the food.\n\nFor appetizers we got this fried braise pork thing and stone fruit plate. It was really good, but to be honest it was super tiny. I usually wouldn't complain about this, but if the price of the appetizer is only a couple bucks less than the main dish...I would go with the main dish.

The food was truly unique in both texture and flavor. The staff was extremely friendly and helped explain each item on the menu. The dishes are a little small but I left feeling full. Not stuffed, but a satisfactory full where you know you had enough food but don't feel uncomfortable. The dishes here are designed to be shared. If you're in town, this place is a must.

We had the salumi, spaghetti, rigatoni and the squid pizza. We know salt enhances, but this was more than an enhancing, it was just all too salted to the point of not being able to truly taste the proteins. Service of beverages was fine, but courses were coming out way too quickly. Every course was still being eaten when another plate was brought out only to sit as we still were trying to eat what was initially given. Delfina and A16  (Oakland) definitely have the salt ratio and timing right on. Flour and Water really needs to take a look at these issues.", "author": "Cherith L."}

Both were amazing.  The crudo had some sort of creme fraiche and was so fresh.  And the pizza, ahhhh when you got that perfect bite that had sauce, mozz and basil, just speechless. \n\nEntrees were the braised rabbit for my friend (awesome!) and I had the pasta with smoked hen, charred escarole and duck pancetta.  It had me at duck pancetta.  I am normally a fast eater, but this had to be savored.  I was afraid that if I ate at my normal speed that it would be gone too quickly or that I might miss a flavor.\n\nSeriously, every bite was amazing.

We booked the Test Kitchen for our families and the cozy \"at-home\" ambiance was absolutely perfect for our intimate wedding party. The waitstaff was incredibly polite and accommodating, despite our numerous dietary restrictions (vegan, pescatarian, and gluten-free!). We all received beautiful individually printed menus and the food was out of this world. The attention to the wine pairings and platings was phenomenal. We were able to bring our own floral arrangement to dress up the table and when I asked the lead server if we could do a series of \"surprise\" dances with our parents, he graciously let us use the sound system for our music and prepped dessert outside so that it could be carried in seamlessly immediately after.

We ordered four courses as followed:\n\nMaiale pizza and added arugula - crust was amazing!\n\nDuck casonsei - first time having duck pasta. It tasted so good. By far my favorite dish. In fact I'm craving it right now. \n\nZeppoles with blood lime curd - like mini fried donuts coated in cinnamon sugar. I love all things sweet. \n\nKale and short rib agnolotti with perigord truffle - this tasted good but after a few bites it got old in my mouth. \n\nEach dish shows how fresh the in house pasta is.

Jamie W. and I have wanted to try flour+water for quite a while, but the sight of that queue when we frequently passed by on Harrison was just too overwhelming for us. And then he had a brainstorm. Since the 49ers didn't make it to the Super Bowl this year, we knew we wouldn't be too upset to miss the game and thought everyone else would be home watching it. Not quite. We did end up being the first in line that Sunday evening, but the line still formed around the block for this \u00fcber-popular place. So now that we've manipulated heaven and earth to get a table, was it up to the hype?\n\nOh yes. Yes indeed. Owners David Steele and David White and especially chef Thomas McNaughton have figured out a certain zeitgeist in San Francisco dining and really captured culinary lightning in a bottle. Don't believe me? Try the $17 Cocoa Strozzapreti, a truly savory chocolate-accented pasta bursting with robust flavor thanks to the braised duck and salsify (see photo). A stunning dish that could have easily encouraged me to ask for seconds despite the semi-hefty price tag. From there, it was easy to pick out which pizza to try because those magic words were emblazoned on the $16 Tesa - pork belly!\n\nIt was a wood-fired round of thin-crust joy with not only pieces of smoked pork belly but also braised cabbage, fior de latte (which is a velvety variety of mozzarella), and parmigiana (see photo). I don't think that lasted more than five minutes between the two of us. To balance out our carb intake, we also ordered the $7 side of Roasted Turnips mixed with spigarello leaf broccoli, garlic, chili flakes and a squeeze of lemon (see photo). Delicious with the turnips attaining a nice, toothy texture. We buzzed through the main meal so quickly that we felt a need to extend the pleasure with a couple of their signature $8 desserts. The first was the Blood Orange Polenta Cake with fresh cream and candied almonds (see photo).\n\nNot overly sweet with just the right texture to the polenta to soak up the juice of the blood orange. The second was the Chocolate Budino with espresso caramel cream and sea salt. Decadently rich even by Italian budino standards with just enough of the salt to counter the sweetness of the chocolate. I had their French-press coffee to wash it all down, but frankly it was an excuse just to stay in the warm ambiance just a bit longer since we managed to get served all this glorious food in less than an hour. Gee, my mother told me I should chew slower to enjoy my food. Also because there were children in China starving for strozzapreti. Guess Mom was right.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...really superb execution on laid-back Italian cuisine just trendy enough to satisfy your taste buds\nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...warm vibe with heavy Mission-style furniture, surprisingly intimate for such a buzzing place\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...very nice and attentive but not unctuous by any means\nTOTAL - 5 stars...flour+water just proves it is more than the sum of its parts", "author": "Ed U."}

Served with an ultra fruity olive oil. \n \nPizza: Uovo -- n'duja, burrata, calabrian chili & farm egg  ($19 + $2 for arugula add-on)\nSolid. This is the first time I've had n'duja (pronounced \"en-doo-yuh\") and I hope it's not my last. Its a spicy Calabrian 'spreadable salami'. It's pretty salty so a little went a long way.

Who doesn't love a good egg photo??\n\nPasta: Chitarra with dungeness crab, romanesco, chili & bearss lime ($23)\nAmazingly balanced in every way. The pasta and romanesco were nicely al dente, the crab to pasta ratio was fair and the acidity of the lime was perfectly spot on. My only gripe is the price tag. It definitely felt way too steep for the portion. \n\nEntree: Roasted hen crown with fried fingerling potato &  nasturtium salsa verde ($23)\nBasically, amazing.

The actual ambience was quite casual, with three different tables with children standing on the chairs -- although this may have been a coincidence.\n\nI found it to be a little too dark. I'm sure it's beautiful when there is some natural sunlight coming in, but since it's a dinner place, you probably won't ever experience that. \n\nWe shared the margherita pizza, and the mustard garganelli with braised pork shoulder & cabbage (I think there was also rabbit in there). The pizza came first - the tomato sauce was extremely warm and tender. The crust was VERY thin. We were starting to think that we might not get full off of two dishes. I love margherita and this pizza exceeded my expectations (I am not normally a pizza person, but I love thin crust!\n\nThen the pasta came. I must say, it was pretty good. The mustard was very light and not overpowering which was great. The braised pork pits were delicious. It was quite flavorful, although a bit too oily. The main problem we had with it was that it was literally the size of an appetizer, which was not expected. We knew we definitely were not going to be full at this point.\n\nSo we ordered a side dish - roasted delicata squash with duck confit, currant & rosemary. This was surprisingly the best dish out of the three. The squash paired well with the duck. It was very flavorful. The funny thing is that this dish was $8, whereas the pasta was $18, and we were pretty sure the squash filled us up more than the pasta. \n\nIt would be nice if they gave more portions for the pasta dish and just increased the price a bit. We all know pasta itself is cheap.\n\nThe service was alright. They seemed a bit colder and less friendly than other restaurants that tend to require you to reserve for a spot. Also, when we were ordering the duck confit dish, the waiter had no idea what we were talking about, and went to fetch a menu to confirm. The menu does indeed change daily, though we were a bit surprised by the lack of knowledge by the staff.\n\nOverall, delicious food but one definitely requires some appetizers or side dishes to have a filling meal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-11-22", "description": "***Flour + Water is a very good Italian restaurant and the prices are pretty reasonable given the quality of their housemade pasta***\n\nThomas McNaughton's Flour + Water immediately reminds me of the other Mission dining destinations I have been to.  There is a line out the door waiting for the restaurant to open.  The decor is upscale but casual and the atmosphere is very loud, lively and youthful while the menu has a seasonal approach and showcases many contemporary items at reasonable prices.\n\nFlour + Water definitely looks the part.  It taste the part too.  Their focus is pasta, but they also feature starters, pizzas and a select number of sides and entrees.  Most items on the menu are below $20.  They also feature a reasonably priced nightly pasta tasting menu, which features an antipasti, 5 small pasta courses and a dessert.\n\nI opted for their pasta tasting menu because it sounded like a great way to get a lot of variety at a reasonable price.  The reality was that while there was variety, there was also some repetitiveness throughout the menu (very good Parmigiano-Reggiano everywhere, which resulted in similar flavor experiences with a lot of the courses).  Still, most of the food I had was very satisfying and definitely makes me want to return to see what other kind of great pasta dishes the kitchen can whip up.\n\nThe tasting menu started with lamb tongue that was served with pine mushrooms and very good, strong and creamy pine mushroom puree.  There were also some blood-braised greens, which gave the greens a blood sausage-like note.  The lamb tongue was interesting, but it was a little grainy like some animal livers.\n\nThe first pasta course was beet and ricotta mezzaluna, which was topped with crunchy hazelnuts and very sharp but soft Parmigiano-Reggiano.  While the beet flavor did not really pop that much, the ricotta flavor was incredibly strong, which made me realize how many ricotta dishes do not really have a ricotta flavor.\n\nThe second pasta course was great.  It was thick and al dente caramel looking pasta filled with very intense and creamy sweet potato filling and then topped with crunchy pumpkin seeds, Parmigiano-Reggiano, a sweet brown butter sauce, and then salty crispy speck to counter it.\n\nNext came duck tortellini, which was paired with a Parmigiano-Reggiano brind broth, lemon and bitter greens.  The fragrance of the broth was incredible; it had brightness and freshness from the lemon as well as a savory aroma and even a bitter note.  I have had a lot of food with great aromas, but the complexity of the aroma here was truly unique.  Unfortunately, the duck tortellini was not great; the duck flavor was not that strong and the filling was dry.\n\nSage cavatelli came next and it was very good and hearty (generous portion too).  It came with veal sugo and Parmigiano-Reggiano.  It was a simple pasta, but it was also a very refined version of a hearty, rustic and comforting dish.\n\nThe last pasta course was a nettle lasagnette, which came with braised oxtail and chanterelles.  The pasta was good and I really liked the braised oxtail even if it was a small portion.  The braised oxtail had a great flavor and it was very moist.  The oxtail ragu was very savory and delicious.  The cooking of the chanterelles was very nicely done; they really showcased both the flavor and unique texture of this wild mushroom--very good crispy frilly edges and a bouncy stump.\n\nDessert was a pear cake with fennel meringue and buttermilk sorbet.  The pear cake had the moistness and consistency of a pineapple upside down cake and the buttermilk sorbet was both sweet and a little bit tart (very refreshing and creamy too).  The fennel meringue was nicely sticky but did not have much of a fennel flavor.\n\nService was good.  The food came out quickly and at an even pace and the staff was friendly, attentive and polite.\n\nAs mentioned, prices were reasonable given the ingredients and the high quality cuisine served.\n\nThe dining room was nice--great looking wood and a really cohesive look throughout the restaurant (the room also did not feel cluttered despite its small size); nice touches throughout the room including a bright open kitchen and attractive light fixtures.\n\nFlour + Water is a very good Italian restaurant.  It does not showcase the creativity of SPQR or Los Angeles' Bestia, but it delivers very good, contemporary and refined rustic Italian cuisine.  Given their reasonable prices and their delicious pastas, Flour + Water is a must visit if you spend a lot of time in San Francisco.\n\nNearby street parking is free, but it is Mission so parking spaces are hard to find.", "author": "Anthony N."}

Having dined at various Mario Batali and Michael White locations in NYC, Barbara Lynch and Jodie Adams outposts in Boston, as well as solid Italian restaurants throughout Europe, I can assure you this blows them all away. When it comes to pasta this is about as good as it gets.\n\nListen to me. Do NOT bother with the pizzas (pretty much everyone is luke warm about them) do NOT bother with the antipasti (they all seemed pretty meh and are definitely very overpriced). DO Get the pasta. My date and I, both of whom are smaller sized humans, devoured 4 entree bowls of pasta as well as a broccoli contorni and still wanted more.\n\nPro Tip: We asked our waitress if we could possibly order an entree portion of one of the pastas on the \"Pasta Tasting\" menu and she allowed us. This dish, the Hen Raviolini with Nettles and Scarlet Turnips, was perhaps the finest dish we had. Filled with a parmesany deep chicken umami tone which was balanced by the nutty, vegetal taste of the nettle.Though, to be honest, all the pasta was almost equally amazing.\n\nThe best dish on the actual menu was probably the Beef Fattisu with Brown Butter Capers and Cauliflower. It is quite decadent yet smart, principled, and luxurious all at once. The pasta has an indescribable bite and silkiness. Our second favorite (though it was close) was the Papardelle with Braised Pork, cabbage, and mustard seed. Don't be scared of this, the mustard really just acted as a kind of acidic bite rather than an overwhelming flavor and the pork was similar to a play on pulled pork.\n\nWe also had the Tagliatelle with Boar Sugo which was, as you have probably guessed by now, a virtually perfect dish although our least favorite of the four. It was certainly the heartiest of the lot, and topped with a flavorful dash of breadcrumbs that lended the dish great body and texture.\n\nWhen it comes to dessert it seems the Chocolate Budino is de rigeur and I can see why. The fleur de sel sprinkled on top and generous dollop of espresso-flavored whipped cream gave the dessert amazing dimension and airiness. \n \nThe service here was absurdly good and all the waiters were professional, nice, and working HARD. An exceptional restaurant I wish there were more like in NYC. Oh yeah, one more tip: You can sometimes get a reservation here and not wait over 60 days if you keep checking Open Table about two weeks before the night you would like to eat. I don't know if this is because of cancellations or the way in which they open reservation slots, but if you don't see the day you want open just keep checking up to a week or so before.", "author": "Paul A."}

On one hand, the food is very good and the service I have been given is always warm and friendly.  On the other hand, I get frustrated waiting for a table, the \"expected\" wait time is wildly inaccurate, and they seem to give preference to certain people and seat them ahead of those who have been waiting.\n\nI have arrived right at opening as well as into the dinner time.  Even the time when we were there right at opening (waiting out front with a small group of other diners) another party of four who knew the hostess walked right in front of us and got a table immediately.  Since the place was half empty, there was no reason for them to be seated first, and it only delayed out seating be 3 or 4 minutes - but still ...\n\nLast night the 30 minute wait turned into 1 hour and 10 minutes.  If they had told me that up front I would have been fine and just gone elsewhere.  But standing there for over an hour is unacceptable.  On top of that, the part of two who checked in behind me was seated before me - because both of their party was there when they arrived according to the hostess.  Note: my wife showed up 15 minutes after me and well within the quoted 30 minute wait time.  Plus, it clearly appeared that there were a couple of other parties that clearly were given preferential seating because they were familiar with the hostess and waitresses.\n\nNow before you chastise me for being rude or something like that, I will point out that I was wall dressed (jeans, nice shirt, nice sport coat), I was polite with the hostess and smiled at her and the other waitress every time they were in the area, and ordered a nice glass of wine while waiting.  So there was nothing done on my part to cause being passed over.\n\nAdding to the issue is that some of the crowd is completely oblivious to the people waiting.  I am all for taking your time and enjoying the meal, but once you are done, vacate the table so others can enjoy thier evening.  Last night a party of 5 young hipsters was sitting in the middle of the communal table.  When they finished thier meal and paid the check, they THEN pulled out a laptop and started looking at some information and material.  When the laptop was finally put away that all (all 5 of them) took out thier phones and started checking messages and emails.  They stayed there a good 15 to 20 minutes after they paid the check.  oh and BTW, they split the check 5 ways with 5 credit cards. Jeez.\n\nI have experienced these types of issues on all of my visits.  \n\nBy the end of the evening I was in a better mood because the food is very good and our waitress was wonderful.

After waiting about ten minutes they opened the doors and started seating patrons. We could have sat immediately but since we aren't 70 years old, we decided to put out name down and grab a beer around the block. We came back promptly at seven and ended up getting the best seat in the house - at the bar facing the kitchen. \n\nWe decided that we wanted a slow food night, which in our world means ordering Italian style with only ordering the next course when we are finished the previous. We started off with the homemade ricotta and house cured prosciutto - the ricotta was divine with a slight sweetness and bright flavor which ended up coming from lemon zest. Although separately everything was divine I will say that the crispy bread was a bit salty so when you ate it with the prosciutto it was a bit much. Only \"complaint\" (I tend to like salt) of the night. \n\nWe then moved onto the pasta corse and after much duress over what to order decided to get the short rib cannelloni. The picture doesn't do it justice (I will admit that it's not the most appealing plate, with brown meat coming out of a cream tube with green sauce...) but once it hits your lips, you are sold!

It was deliciously crisp on the outside and succulently tender and moist on the inside. As we cut into the slow-cooked egg, the yolk started oozing out like hot lava which added a creamy decadence. The corn and cherry tomatoes were exceptionally fresh which gave brightness to the dish.\n\n~ ~PIZZAS~ ~\nWith pizzas, it's ALL about the crust. And with a solid Neapolitan pizza, I expect the crust to be crisp throughout with the outer edge having a nice toothsome chew with blistering and some char on the edges. Although Flour+Water's crust was crisp throughout, it was overcharred causing a lingering burnt taste in my mouth.  \n\n*MARGHERITA - Tomato, Basil, Fior di Latte & EVOO ($13) - 2 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qs7FgJ-UXgpbAMass0Oojg?select=EkBb5OryaYzZDGbDlViP1g\nMarinara had an overpowering tanginess that was borderline sour. \n\n*BIANCOVEDRE - Pancetta, Summer Squash, Marjoram, Black Pepper w/ Egg ($17 +$3 Egg) - 3 STARS \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qs7FgJ-UXgpbAMass0Oojg?select=x06rlp6usDsoIjt07OahmA\nThe biancovedre sounded a lot better than it tasted. Although less charred on the edges than the margherita, it was bland. The slices of pancetta did add a slight salty component but not enough for each bite to be flavorful. Perhaps, a more pungent cheese should have been used to bring out the flavors of all the ingredients. \n\n~ ~PASTAS~ ~\nThe housemade noodles were perfectly cooked to an al-dente.

The potatoes and romano beans didn't do much for the pasta. Although our waitress said there were pine nuts in the dish, we didn't detect any which was disappointing as it would have been a nice texture contrast. \n\n*DESSERT: CHOCOLATE BUDINO w/ Espresso Caramel Cream & Sea Salt ($8) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qs7FgJ-UXgpbAMass0Oojg?select=pD0l7rFfwsoxGxxysppmxw\nTraditionally an Italian pudding, Flour+Water's rendition was a cross between a chocolate ganache and a mousse. It was velvety smooth, rich, decadent and not overly sweet. The espresso caramel added a sweet bitterness which helped balance some of the richness, though we weren't a fan of the sea salt as it added an intense burst of saltiness with each bite. \n\nS E R V I C E\nThe entire staff at Flour+Water was friendly, down-to-earth and knows the menu like the back of their hand. Our waitress gave us great wine recommendations (which didn't disappoint) and checked on us several times to see how we were doing.

The tomato sauce wasn't too tangy, the cheese was ooey-gooey and the egg with the runny yolk was a great addition.\n\nThe Cured Duck Breast I wasn't so crazy about.  Although I really liked the kale and parsnips, I wasn't impressed by the duck itself.\n\nHowever...I loved the Rabbit Raviolini!  These cute little ravioli were cooked well.  The preserved lemon brightened up the dish and the pistachios added a nice crunch in contrast to the tender rabbit.  Just the right amount of creamy sauce.  Not too rich, either.  Overall, a wonderful dish.\n\nI also enjoyed the Chocolate Budino with Espresso Caramel Cream & Sea Salt.  I'm not sure what the difference is between a budino and a pot de creme, but that's what the consistency was like to me.  The espresso caramel cream was really tasty, too.  The espresso wasn't too strong with just hint of caramel.  Plus, I'm a sucker for any salted sweet nowadays.\n\nMy husband and I sat at the communal table, which is a great way to meet new people and see what other dishes look like.", "author": "Rose A."}

We got seated immediately in the small restaurant with wooden decor. The staff was friendly but I felt rushed - there would be two different waitresses that asked if we are ready to order one after another; communication is poor among the staff. Water and bread is upon request, which is stated at the end of the menu. They have a tasting menu for around $70 per person, but my family didn't want to be overly stuffed so we ordered our own dishes. Our antipasti dish was a small salad that consisted of cauliflower, broccoli, brussels sprouts, and a delicious creamy vinaigrette below it all. Their veggies were all crispy and the sauce was delicious with it - though it was a fairly small portion to share among 3 people. They also have mustard seeds in them, but it doesn't make it sour in any way. I had the pork trotter ravioli which had a delicious sauce that wasn't too heavy, but the outer parts of the ravioli were hard and seemingly not fully cooked. My sister had the radiatore with braised pork, which she liked but I thought it lacked flavor next to my ravioli. The portion of hers was much larger than mine as well. My mother had the margherita pizza with anchovies - the crust was burnt and the pizza caused the crust below it to become super soggy that it was hard to pickup a slice and eat. As for desserts we got the Affagato and Panna Cotta. My sister told them in advance that it was my birthday and usually restaurants provide a complimentary dessert, but for the first time ever, this restaurant gave me the dessert I ordered and paid for with a candle on top. Minus one more star. However the panna cotta was delicious, I probably won't return - wasn't a big fan of the rushed service, small portions, and uncooked ravioli.", "author": "Amanda C."}

We were seated promptly and our server was pretty attentive. We orders the pork shoulder ditalini and veal pizza. Both were very good. Probably not to die for but pretty good. Price point was typical for Italian restaurants. For pizza, it may take a little longer. The waitress let us know that there was only one small oven that fit only 2 pizzas at a time. It was ok with us since we were slowly enjoying our pasta and wine. We opted not to order dessert but the waitress was really sweet, and provided a nice homemade ice cream scoop for my husband and lit candle for his birthday. He loved the hint of lemon and flower taste from the dessert. \n\nI also think that their pasta tasting was reasonably priced at $75 with option of wine pairing for $55. We saw a few tables order it and just enjoying their meal thoroughly. If we happen to be in that area another time, it's a nice restaurant to hit, but we live across town so it's a bit of a trek.

On the day, a couple colleagues couldn't make it and that was my first impression - the staff looking at us and saying, unapologetically, that we would still have to pay for them as we didn't cancel in time. My colleague had given her credit card details to secure the reservation but she couldn't do anything about our friends being unable to leave work (our reservations were quite early 6:00 p.m.). It seems an odd policy, especially since the table was filled easily with people passing by and feeling lucky that a table was available. It's always packed so i think filling tables isn't a problem.\n\nOn to the menu. I have lived in Italy, so I'm always excited about going to Italian restaurants and I was really looking forward to the menu! However, the serving staff seemed pretentious when I asked questions about the menu. I'm not sure why, I thought we could share in our love of Italian cuisine. But that wasn't the vibe at all. I felt like it was more a show of how many complicated words could be used, or Italian words (even if pronounced incorrectly), instead of connecting with customers and explaining the menu in a way that people could understand.\n\nThe food was OK. Not bad by any means. The pizzas were good, not Italian style but nice fusion flavors and interesting ingredients.

My 300th review and it just so happens its a restaurant I actually like!!!! \n\nCame here for dinner last night after seeing Louis CK at The Punchline. It was already 9 by the time we got there and found parking and there was still an hour long wait. The hostess told us we could walk around and come back after 35 minutes but me being the lazy person that I am, decided to just loiter outside the restaurant. Good thing I did because 20 minutes later the hostess came outside and said there were two seats at the bar and no one else who put their name down was there. I was so relieved we avoided having to sit at the communal table. I hate communal dining. I didn't even see the table, it was probably in the back somewhere. \n\nI got the margherita pizza and my friend got the salsiccia pizza. I also got some drink called Americano or something along the lines of that and it was really good except I kept getting pieces of thyme in my mouth. \n\nThey have really good timing when it comes to getting the food to us. I got force fed my friends salsiccia pizza so I took a bite that supposedly had no meat on it but all I could taste was the fucking sausage. Not going to lie though, it was amazing. Are you supposed to eat the entire pizza in one sitting because that definitely went down. I love thin crust pizza even though my teeth don't touch and if I wasn't using my hands to rip the pizza, I was using my tongue against my top teeth. \n\nFor dessert we got the warm cornmeal almond cake with olive oil ice cream from Humphry Slocombe and I fucking love their olive oil ice cream! I think I liked the dessert more than the pizza. It was so pretty and sooooo good. It came with pieces of peach but I forgot what fruit it was so I guessed it was an apple then I guessed it was pear until I finally asked my friend haha. \n\nService was fantastic!

Gathering from their reviews that their specialty were their freshly made pastas, there is definitely no shortage of variety in their menu.  My companion longed to dine here for several years and we were fortunate to secure a Sunday early evening reservation.  \nGetting to this meal proved to be an adventure as a pothole on 14th & Irving turned my rear driver side tire into a deflating balloon.  Thanks to my speedy AAA roadside assistance, I was glad to arrive within ten minutes of the designated time.\n\nShared\n1) Funghi Pizza  ($18.00) - Like that, unlike Zero Zero, the dough was chewy and more interesting texture.  No shortage of mushrooms here either.\n\n2) Prosciutto Fattisu ($17.00) - Our waitress accurately described this as \"candy wrapper\" shaped pasta filled with prosciutto in a rich and creamy sauce.  Very different presentation and not what we expected.  If you're looking for something light, this is NOT it!\n\nEntree\n3) Tagliarini ($18.00) - My perfectly cooked al dente pasta was accompanied by mussels and English peas.  Extremely refreshing flavor from the various ingredients.  Would definitely order this again.\n \nDessert\n4) Chocolate Budino ($8.00) - With neither one of us being pudding or mousse fans, this was probably the least favorite dish of the evening.  (Doesn't anyone just make a heavy, decadent dessert anymore?!)\n\nWhen we arrived, the room was full and there was slight wait at the greeting area.  Overhearing the hostess and incoming walk-in guests, I was stunned that there was a sixty to ninety minute wait for a table; more amazing was that these diners waited.  While reviewing the menu, I noted a Pasta Tasting menu for $65.00 per person.  It sounded interesting and I worried that it would be too filling.  Perhaps, I'll be up to the challenge next time here.\nYes, I will be back but we were fortunate to have reservations to avoid the table waiting anxiety.

The eggplant cannelloni was even more blase. 4 mini pieces of cannelloni, about the length of a chapstick and a half, were filled with chopped up eggplant, some cheese, and covered with about half as much sauce as it needed. I love eggplant, so that part was good, but the filling didn't really stick within the pasta, which was kind of dry, so cutting into the cannelloni, pushed everything else out of it, so it took a bit of work to get everything together in a bite (the whole plate could have been wiped out in about 7-8 small bites - I've had appetizers that were larger).\n\nI still really want to love this place, based on the reviews and great service, so maybe we'll try it again and just order twice as much!", "author": "Angirenee W."}

We were seated right away and the open seating didn't fill up until 6:30PM.

The cannelloni was fresh and the beef cheek was incredibly tender. The onions and mushrooms add a surprisingly sweet balance to the dish. This comes as 4 logs of connelloni.\n\n- Salsiccia Pizza ($20): This has a rather spicy sauce on top. The pizza dough is very soft and fluffy, and the pork sausage is more tender than solid. The cheese gets a bit overwhelming after 2 slices, so definitely share this with someone. My one quip is that the crust is too burnt in some parts.\n\n- Chocolate Budino ($10): This was probably our favorite part of the meal. Topped with coffee cream and sea salt flakes, the flavors are dynamic and perfectly balanced. I love the explosion of chocolate, followed by the more subdued coffee, and then amplified by the salt.

We both had high expectations going in, but everything from the food to the service far exceeded them. The manager brought us champagne as a gift for our honeymoon, which made us feel special. We decided to go all out and ordered the pasta tasting. Every single course blew us away! I've been to Italy several times and cook homemade pasta all the time at home. I find it frustrating when at home cooking seems to be as good as most really fancy Italian restaurants. But at Flour + Water, everything was on a whole different level! Thank you so much for caring about pasta the way you do and for making our night special (also gave us candles on our dessert. I would eat here every meal if I could.

The menu changes daily, so there is a good reason to go often. We passed on the tasting menu and opted for a  Lamb dish,  a pork and pasta dish, a peach and pine salad, finished off with a chocolate espresso mousse type dessert called budoni. I can not tell you how amazing everything was. Words just can not express the tantalizing, delicate flavors erupting in my mouth. The variety of flavors all competing for your satisfaction, while melding together to create a complete and utter food explosion. C'est tres bon! \n\nThe lamb melted in my mouth. The pasta was al dente and juicy. The pork...I didn't even realize I was eating the pork because it was like the texture of a mushroom, tender, dense and meaty with the bite.

Mmm mm. Also the sauce tasted of butter, parsley, and leeks, which paired perfectly with the tender and heavier braised pork. The agnolotti was filled as it should be (according to Master chef) with leftover meats. Some pieces I got hints of pork and shia le beouf, and other peices I got hints of salumi. Mmmmmmm good!!! It was to die for in a brown butter sauce of sorts with lots of freshly grated parmesan on top. The pizza was super soft and light in texture and mighty in flavor...like seriously wow.

It was a table of 5 loud girls, and we wanted a lot of food in addition to the pasta tasting.  Also, knowing some of us (specially me) had dietary issues, he rocked it. He knew exactly when to  interrupt, what we're looking for, and made sure we all got exactly what we needed.  \n\nThe manager Zac (with a C, we asked) was super nice too! Super friendly, no airs, gave us all a little background about the restaurant, and their restaurant close by.  He sold Central Kitchen (their other restaurant) so well, that we went and checked it out after our 8 course meal!\n\nThe food.

We shared the fava bean bruschetta, which was delicious. For our entree, we shared the artichoke triangoli with meyer lemon and herbs and the maltagliati with braised porcini mushroom, lemon thyme and almond crumble. Both entrees were light, spring-like fresh and along with the fresh made pasta, the ingredients all worked well together and created an amazing dish.\n\nWe made room for dessert and shared the chocolate budino with espresso cream and sea salt. This was so good that we ended our dining experience with a smile, but we also needed to take a walk around the neighborhood.\n\nGetting a reservations is hard, but not impossible. Make an exception and either dine early or late and you will not be disappointed. This is one of my favorite restaurants!", "author": "Allie L."}

My husband and I have been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile and finally got a chance. We were told that it wasn't your standard Italian food but that it was from Northern Italy, whatever that meant because neither of us have ever been to Italy anyways so it's not like we knew what to compare it to. Either way, we were able to get reservations for a weeknight at 8:15 and we were meeting another couple. The restaurant is in a residential area but since it's the city, parking was still pretty bad. We, however, had some good parking karma and parked right across the street! The ambiance was a lot more casual than I expected and had a bit of a rustic feel. We were seated in the back corner so it was nice because it felt more private. Our server was definitely helpful and had to tell us what some of the items actually were. He also told us it was family style so we'd probably want to order a few different items and share. He was helpful, in that we originally were going to get 2 red sauce pizzas (unknowingly they were both red) and that we might want to try one red and one white sauce. In the end we decided to split an appetizer, 3 pastas, 2 pizzas (one red and one white) and a dessert between the 4 of us. It was the perfect amount and we even had a few slices of pizza leftover. We started with the Salumi Board which consisted of butter, mustard, rhubarb, toasted sourdough, pork liver pate, crispy pork trotter, lardo & coppa. All of it was delicious and we had to ask for more bread! For the pastas we ordered the fava leaf pici, agnolotti dal plin & pork trotter raviolini. Once again, no words because they were just so good. I ended up finishing the last few pieces from each pasta dish because everyone else was too full... How can you be too full for delicious pasta!? For pizza we ordered the margherita (red sauce) & the maiale (white sauce). I read reviews for complaints that the pizza was more dough than sauce but I don't have any complaints. The pizzas had that wood stove toasty taste. They were good! And lastly for dessert the olio nuovo cake. It was super sweet but very yummy! All I can say is all of the food was delicious! I don't think you can go wrong with any of the items. Yes, other reviews say the dishes are small, but it's because it's family style and it's meant to be shared. I actually enjoyed the dining experience and thought that it was great that we got to sample so many of the different menu items in one visit! Food was fantastic and service was great! We will definitely be going back!!", "author": "Christiana P."}

It's one of my favorite cookbooks, in fact - I've made at least a half dozen of the recipes and they've all been very, very good.  I live in LA, so when I was in town for work, I couldn't wait to try the  restaurant.  \n\nI arrived shortly before 8pm on a Tuesday and was seated at the bar quickly.  The bartender recommended a nice glass of wine (the wine list is all Italian), and I was off to a great start.  Based on a tip from another yelper, I asked if it would be possible to do half orders of pasta so that I could try two, and the bartender checked with the kitchen and said yes, much to my delight.\n\nIt was all downhill from there, unfortunately.  Perhaps I made a mistake by coming VERY hungry, but the portions were miniscule.  I always take it with a grain of salt when reviewers on yelp complain about small portions, but these were really tiny (and I'm a slim, 5'6 woman - not a huge eater).  One of the the pastas, papardelle with braised pork, literally had three strands of pasta in the bowl.  I'm not kidding - three noodles!  Granted, it was a half portion, but double that and it's hardly a meal.  I also had the celery root tortellini, the flavors of which were disappointing - the acidic balsamico and heavy-handed sprinkling of walnuts overpowered the delicate, sweet flavor of the celery root filling.  The papardelle was tasty, but not on the level of the best pastas that I've had.  I was still so hungry after finishing both pastas that I contemplated ordering another dish.  Instead, I headed back to my hotel and ended up getting subway an hour later.  \n\nI am disappointed that F + W didn't live up to its cookbook.  It's good, but not mindblowing, and I can't justify spending $25 on (good, not great) pasta and still needing to eat a second dinner.", "author": "Colleen K."}

We got there shortly after they opened though so I'm sure they were busy getting through the opening rush. I got the papparedelle with pork shoulder, my date got the goat ravioli.

I was there about a week ago.  \n \nI naturally had high expectations for pizza and order Margarita Pizza, with basil & extra virgin olive oil. It was good, but honestly, it did not meet my expectation.  The crust was limp and bit salty.  The sauce had good fresh tomato flavor and was well balanced. I do not see the wow factor! \n\nTheir pastas, however, was incredibly good!  We order Cresta de gallo with caramelized onions, brown butter & sage. The texture and the flavors were perfect, absolutely loved it!.  Seemly the portions look small but I feel that they are just enough. I had an urge to order more because I loved their pasta, but I was not hungry.   One the best pasta dishes I have had! \n\nFinished off dinner with Chocolate Budino with Espresso Caramel Cream and Sea Salt - It is rich and creamy with velvety texture. Initially taste strong espresso, followed by rich chocolate and caramel. The salt flakes only enhance the flavors.  Very Good!\n\nWe did not try any wines and service was great!

It's sort of like going to a restaurant where most of the menu is just variations on the same dish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-29", "description": "Yes, flour + water is all that it's cracked up to be!\n\nTo start, we ordered the crispy pork trotter with corn, squash, cherry tomato conserva, and chili aioli. The dish was beautifully presented with a nice array of color and textures. The pork was composed in three well-seasoned, croquette-like rounds surrounded by the corn kernals and other components.\n\nFor my main dish, I ordered the taleggio scarpinocc with aceto balsamico. So. Good. It was the first time I had tasted taleggio (a cheese with a strong aroma, but mild flavor), and it was wonderfully tasty! Scarpinocc, to my surprise, was a pasta in the shape of a traditional candy in a wrapper. So cute with the pinched ends and lightly stuffed with a goat cheese in the center (where the candy usually would reside). All of this goodness was topped off with an insanely addicting and rich butter sauce and a balsamic vinegar reduction unlike any other that I've tasted!\n\nService was prompt, and the food was served without delay, which was nice. We did seem to have rotating servers (one took our starter order, another took our main course order, another closed our bill for us) at our table, which was a bit odd at first, but I guess it kind of fit the ambiance of the restaurant (if that was the intention). \n\nNotables:\n\n- This place takes VERY limited reservations VERY early on, leaving the remainder of the seating for walk-ins. Be prepared to wait if you don't have a res (or read below). \n- Arrive early. Opening time is 5:30pm. We arrived at 5pm and stood in a short line, which soon became quite long. (IMHO, it's worth standing in line for 30 mins pre-opening, rather than 1+ hours once the first seating is occupied).  \n- The closer to the front of the line you are, the higher the chance of you scoring a table (normally walk-ins get bar/communal table seating). We landed a table, which was nice, so we didn't have to \"share\" our conversation with neighbors.\n- Don't take a date here unless you have a table reservation. The communal seating is not date-friendly, unless you want to be on a date with six other folks.", "author": "Mansi A."}

Perhaps because Flour + Water is so well known, people are harsher critics, but I still don't get the three and a half stars.\n\nWhile we did have to wait a bit despite having a reservation, they brought us some awesome marinated mushrooms to make up for it. This was just the first taste of the fantastic food that was to come. \n\nThe food here, especially the pasta, lives up to the hype. The chefs here are so creative and are able to successfully mix flavors that I would never associate. Nothing is over the top or super weird, yet they pull together some simple, and seemingly different ingredients together flawlessly to craft some really interesting dishes. Since they aren't trying to hard to be overly weird like a lot of trendy places, these unique dishes are enjoyable to even the \"safest\" eaters. The food is interesting, but also maintains the integrity of traditional Italian. \n\nI think the menu changes daily, so I'll only describe my favorite dish incase they have it!:\n\nSquid Ink - I loved how round the spaghetti (or similar?) was! Slurped it right up. The spiciness of the chili, fishiness of the octopus and refreshing-ness of the mint compliment each other way better than I would've thought. \n\nOk now don't listen to anyone else and go feed yourself!

I liked the pork and savoy cabbage ravioli, but I'd love to try the squid ink pasta next time. Save room for dessert.  The warm polenta with strawberry and thyme ice cream is a delectable way to end on a sweet note.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-04-17", "description": "My bro had been raving about this place and this was our next go-to restaurant that we wanted to try in the glorious San Franciscan city. Along with that, we knew this was our only chance because we were still early and arrived at 5 PM in March. When they opened the doors, we were seated rather quickly and at a proper table (not a communal one).\n\nUpon request, they can offer complimentary focaccia bread. Their bread is very warm and is served with fresh olive oil that is slightly bitter but in a good way.\n\nFOOD:\n--Crispy Pork Trotter ($14): This was served with green garlic aioli, roasted carrots, and broccoli di ciccio. It was pretty good but nothing to rave about. It came with slices of pork (in chinese it's similar to char-siu) and some meatballs that were made of some ground pork that tasted insanely good. The rest of the dish was not executed as well and the flavors did not go that well together.\n\n--Teleme Scarpinocc ($17): This was served with aceto balsamic. We were told that the balsamic was 10+ years aged. The cheese let off a good flavor and was well balanced yet it didn't overpower the dish. This tasted quite good overall but the balsamic vinegar didn't give that strong of a taste.\n\n--Trenette ($18): This was served with pork sumo, chili, pecorino romano, and breadcrumbs. This is very similar to a Spaghetti Bolognese but with the breadcrumbs to give it more crunch and with the chili to give it some heat. This was pretty good as well but the flavors were definitely too simple and nothing really outstanding.\n\n--Whole Wheat Campanelle ($19): This was served with braised oxtail and red wine soffrito. I didn't try this one but my other family member seemed to be satisfied with this one.\n\n--Cappellacci Dei Briganti ($18): This was served with braised hen, lava leaves, and pecorino sardo. My bro seemed to really enjoy this one even though he was very skeptical to begin. I didn't try this one but my other family member seemed to be satisfied with this one.\n\n--Agnolotti Dal Plin ($18): This is basically tiny ravioli's that are filled with pork. This is pretty much a replica of the one we had at Cotogna in SF. It tasted very similar. It was pretty good and a pretty solid dish overall.\n\n--Biancoverde Pizza ($18): This was topped with asparagus, ricotta, and green garlic salmoriglio. Personally, this was my least favorite out of the main dishes. The crust was more burnt than we would have liked and I felt like this was all over the place. Other Yelpers seem to like the pizzas so maybe we should have ordered a different one.\n\n--Chocolate Budino ($8): This was complimented nicely with expresso cream and sea salt to top it off. The dessert as a whole had the perfect sweetness, saltiness, and consistency. It was very dense and rich and was similar to a thicker custard. The sea salt added the perfect crunch and offsetted the sweet flavor. However, I have had a butterscotch budino before and I found that more interesting. Still good nonetheless.\n\nSERVICE: The service was not overdone but they were very chill, welcoming and friendly. I liked how all the pasta dishes were served at the same time which is pretty difficult to do at any restaurant.\n\nSEATING/DECOR: There is quite a bit of seating with proper tables and communal dining. There is also a bar for alcohol. There are many windows that let in light which makes this place perfectly illuminated. The kitchen is viewable as well.\n\nOVERALL: Overall this is an excellent place for pasta fanatics. Everyone in my family agreed that the pastas were better and the pizzas were weaker and less interesting. The appetizers were nothing too special as well. I may return but I'd want to try a new restaurant and reserving would be troublesome so I would walk in.\n\nOTHER INFO:\n-Highlights: Teleme Scarpinocc, Agnolotti Dal Plin, Chocolate Budino\n-Avoid: Crispy Pork Trotter, Biancoverde Pizza\n-Credit Cards are usable\n-Takes reservations - Reserve in advance\n-No wifi", "author": "Jacquie H."}

I really liked the first dish with halibut and vegetables as it was light and healthy and the dish with lightly fried kale as it was tasty and just salty enough.  \n\nMany of the pasta dishes was with a brown butter sauce so they started to taste alike a little and it was sort of blur after awhile as I was becoming more and more full.  I thought they would have different sauces, some red, some creamy, some pesto, I don't know what I was expecting, but I thought there would be a little more variety.  I didn't like the one with giblets as it was a little too gamey for me, plus I was really full at this point.  That many pasta dishes was a lot for my tummy.\n\nI really liked the panna cotta dessert though - that was a hit!  There is always room for dessert somehow, hah?\n\nThe service was great, attentive and friendly.  We had plenty of time to catch up and were not rushed at all.  Definitely make a reservation (we made ours 2 months in advance because we wanted a decent time) because the crowd waiting for the communal table and bar seating took over the whole front of the restaurant.  Craziness!  I don't know how they deal with that night after night.  Seriously though, there has to be a more efficient way.

The bread alone was divine. A nice golden brown crust on the outside and chewy goodness on the inside. \n\nYou can never go wrong with the pizzas there. My suggestion is order one as an appetizer and save the pasta dishes for the main course. \nThe pizza crust was unlike anything I've ever had before! It was so light and chewy on the inside but had a nice crunch to it when you took a bite.\n\nThe pasta could almost pass for homemade, as it was so light and tender. Definitely get the pappardelle with pork sugo or any type of meat sugo at that! Just know that the pasta portions are small so if you are really hungry, get an appetizer or a side of their sauteed vegetables to boot! \n\nMy family and I are huge foodies! We basically plan our vacations on where the best food is. My mom is a food writer for Sunset Magazine and I've never once seen her speechless from a restaurants bread! But at Flower+Water, she was in awe, as were the rest of the family!  We agreed that every dish we ordered (which were a couple pizzas, 3-4 pastas, and a meat dish) were just as good as some of the meals we had in Italy. \n\nAs for the service, I was not that impressed. They didn't take reservations the many times I have called so we had to get there right at 5 when the doors open. When we got to the restaurant, there was already a line out the door, which is quite normal for them. It takes a while to be seated and an even longer time for the food to come out. To me, the staff seemed a bit snobbish and haughty the many times I've been there; they definitely don't make you feel at home.\nBut if you are able to look past the mediocre service then I REALLY recommend dining at Flower+Water.

I was both surprised at their failed execution, and my awareness of what went wrong.  \n\nThe pizza was ok, but I expected better.  My pasta dish was lackluster.  I've had better pasta 5 years ago at A16.  The pasta was soft and fresh, but I didn't like the chicken or the broth accompanying it.  I couldn't get past the feeling that I was eating chicken soup on pasta.  It was also bland.  \n\nThe service was informative, helpful, and friendly.  The wine recommendation, spot on.

Server and hostess was VERY friendly. Arrived an hour early for our reservations and was seated within a half hour. They also offer a texting service if you are waiting so you are free to roam around the streets and check out other places. \n\nSetting was a bit dimmer than I would have like but a good atmosphere. On the louder side so conversation definitely had to be turned up a bit to hear the person across from you. Very small place (hence the wait), but tables weren't too crammed next to each other. Service was reasonably fast. \n\nOrdered the panzanella appetizer (tomato, cheese, basil, and bread), which was a pleasant surprise. It was served at room temperature and very flavorful without any one ingredient overpowering. A nice balance and serving size to work up the appetite. \n\nHad the margherita pizza which was good. The crust is very thin and chewy which I like, but because it was so thin it was easily burnt (on the edges too), which gave the dish a slightly bitter taste. The sauce and cheese was nice and light. Definitely a nice dish to share in addition to another dish. \n\nTried the pork raviolini which had a bit of a sour pasta taste to it initially which I had to get over (reminded me of something putrid), but perhaps I'm just not accustomed to it. If you get over that sourness it was a decent dish. \n\nThe espresso cream chocolate budino with sea salt is a MUST. The chocolate is not too sweet at all and very creamy. Has a nice chill to it.

Being a huge pizza fan, I was excited to sample their thin crust pizzas... but after having a bite of the pasta, I was like... dammit, why didn't we order all pastas???? The pasta was AMAZING.\n\nMy friend (Kimberly F.) made a reservation for 6 TWO MONTHS in advance! She said that was the soonest they had! Holy crap. 2 months reservation? It better be good! We went this past Friday at 8:15pm. After seeing the menu, we decided to order family-style, and this is what we ended up ordering for 6:\n\nANTIPASTI:\n*Halibut Crudo (3 stars): This dish was small, and unfortunately there wasn't enough for everyone to have 1 piece of halibut (there were 5). But everyone managed to get a bite somehow. The dish was a little too salty for me. But the fish tasted fresh, and I liked the combo of asparagus/fennel/tarragon.\n\nPIZZA (fyi, each pizza comes with 6 thin slices):\n*Margherita (2.5 stars): It wasn't terrible, but the mozzarella was really sparse, and I wish it could have been a bit more spread out. But the defining attribute of their pizza was salty  and burnt crust. I've never tasted such a salty crust, which actually made the burnt taste more apparent! \n\n*Prosciutto: I can't rate this one because I didn't have a slice. But one of my friends thought this was the best pizza because they were generous with the prosciutto, and the flavor combos were unique in a good way.\n\n*Salsiccia (3.5 stars): This was my fave pizza of the bunch. The pieces of sausage were pretty big, and they were really flavorful & meaty. The rest of the ingredients masked the salty crust a little bit more... but it was still salty like the margherita one.\n\nPASTA (this is where it's at friends!):\n*Radiatore with Roasted Hen (5 stars): WOW! AMAZINGLY GOOD! The spiralish pasta was cooked to perfection!!! The hen meat was tender, and the sauce was light and refreshing. It tasted like a super fresh, farm-to-table dish.\n\n*Garganelli with Braised Lamb (5 stars): SO GOOD! Wow, they must make their pasta from scratch because the pasta texture is out of this world. The pasta was very fine and rolled into thin tubes, but surprisingly it still had the perfect, al dente consistency. Lamb meat was really good, and once again, the whole dish was so fresh!\n\nDESSERT:\n*Chocolate Budino (3.5 stars): It was a dark chocolate budino, topped with sea salt and espresso cream. Was a bit too thick for me, and I'm not the hugest fan of espresso but it was still worth finishing.\n\n*Citrus Bonet (4.5 stars): I liked this a lot! The brown sugar added a nice crunch, and the citrus bonet was perfect (not too sweet or tangy).\n\nThe pizza here was underwhelming (go to Zero Zero or Pizzeria Delfina instead), but I probably will be back another night to have a dinner full of delicious pasta!

Unless you're from Palermo or something, and Sicilians ain't exactly the Yelping kind. \n\nAnd, who else bothers to put fresh nettles on their brick-oven pizza? Outside of Tuscany, that is.

I imagine the 3.5 average is for the reservation system or difficulty/wait time for getting a table, but the food is worth the wait and worth the money!!! This is easily the best Italian in the Bay Area. For the most part, you won't find anything you've ever had before and the menu changes often which makes returning feel like its the first time. \n\nI've been here about 10 times over the past 3 years and nearly every pasta dish I have had has been amazing. The pizzas are exceptional as well. \n\nTips: 1. Ask to taste a couple of the wines before ordering a glass. They don't have the classic wine styles that locals here are used to so tell them what you like and have them give you a couple options to taste.  \n         2. Ask the waitress to explain the entire pasta menu and then ask her to tell you her favorites and if those meet your dietary requirements then order it.

Sure, there's a long wait, and a lot of the negative comments people make about flour + water on here seem to be related to difficulties getting a table. When I went, i was ready for the wait, and even though it took over an hour to get in on a weeknight, I was fine. To me, flour + water earns it's less than stellar review based on the food alone. \n\nIn order to try the largest variety we could, my group went family style and shared everything. For appetizers, we had a dish with wild mushrooms cooked in a few different ways. I don't remember the exact details of the dish since I'm a little late in writing this review, but I liked this dish far less than my fellow diners, partly because I hated the fact that they slaughtered beautiful chanterelles by pickling them, and partly because the entire dish was served at room temperature, and it felt like the components had just been sitting on a shelf somewhere in the kitchen until they were plated. We also had another appetizer that was roasted root vegetables with brown butter. This dish was actually pretty good, but then again, it's pretty hard to go wrong when you're roasting anything and then drenching it in the miracle of brown butter.\n\nFor mains, we split the margherita pizza, along with a couple of their handmade pastas. The pastas were good, but definitely did not live up to the hype. If you're used to pasta that comes from a box, you'll find flour + water's pasta to be an epiphany. If you're used to handmade pastas with a less uniform texture and more bite, you'll probably shrug when you take a bite of their pasta. The pizza was probably one of the most flavorless pizzas I've ever had from a good new age pizza restaurant. True to the name of the restaurant, it really did taste kind of like flour and water, with not much else. The pizza sauce was watery and utterly devoid of flavor. The crust had an ok chewy texture, but no crunch or airyness to it, and not much in the flavor department. I had heard a lot about the pizza at flour + water, and I left incredibly disappointed.\n\nConsidering the price and quality of food, skip the lines at flour + water. You won't be missing out on anything at all.", "author": "Jeff M."}

Guess it was a slow night, given all he hype. \n\nFood was excellent and I'm not a fan of small plates. Had kale salad (Yum!), saut\u00e9ed cauliflower  side (Yum!), celery root tortellini (very creamy), a rabbit dish, and a few other small plates that I can't remember. We also shared two desserts and a couple bottles of wine. Wait person did not recommend the pizza and I appreciated her honesty (very S.F.). \n\nOnly odd thing was, Jay Z was BLASTING over the sound system causing 99 reasons not to hear our table's conversation and wine server slammed our wine bottle on the table, misjudging glass placement and shattered a glass. This dramatic wine presentation would have been great if she had executed it correctly. Meh . . . we all have an off night and provided a great story to tell, like right now.

When we arrived, our host sat us a the table right in the middle of the restaurant.   I noticed the table by the window were finishing up so I asked her if we could have the window table instead.  In a very short tone she said : \"someone is sitting there\"  yes, I see that...what she should have say is: \"I think they are finishing up, let me double check and I will let you know\".  Sure enough, the couple left in a few minutes.  The sun was setting and glarring on my face from where we sat, I then asked her again if we can move since the sun was in my eye.  At that point she moved us over.  \nSo we made a mistake ordering the pasta tasting menu, as it was highly recommended by many reviewers and articles. I should have listen to my friend who been there a few times and just go with the a la cart.  Words of mouth is always best.\nSo why was the experience a disappointment?\nMy 7 courses tasting with 5 courses pastas, 1 appertizer and 1 dessert was a big BLAH.  Appertizer was salty,  we had the halibut balls sprinkled with seabream salt.  Saute porcini mushroom and some roasted almond...very salty.\nMy husband was jokingly said chef loves butter and cheese but hate tomatoes.  All 4 out of 5 of the pasta were made with butter sauce.  So much for tasting...no variety, not a single tomato sauces in any of the dishes.  Whatever happen to bucatini,  spaghetti,   ragu, seafood options?  Anything but butter and cheese. \nThe first course was trenette with nastrutium in pesto sauce.Came yellow squash triangoli in brown butter. It's ravioli in triangle shape.  Then came the hen tortellini in a hen both soup.  And a cappellagi (a cone shape pasta) with hen meatballs and mustard green again in a butter sauce.  And lastly a sweatbread ravioli with lamb quater in yet another butter sauce...don't get me wrong, the pasta was well made but 5 of the same or very similar tasting food does not qualify for a tasting journey in my book nor has it ever been done at any other restaurants.   \nYes, I ate at lots of places, and done lots of tasting menu...this is the first to be disappointed and feel that it did not worth the wait,  the hype and the money.  We spent much less at SPQR and Delfina for a much better experience. \nNoise level was loud, only one single stall unisex restroom but well kept. So be prepare to wait.\nOverall service was decent, food was okay....I would spent my money elsewhere for a better tasting experience , And for certain I know I won't feel sick for two days after from all the heavy butter and cheeses in my food.

All of the courses were soaked in butter and oil, which I don't mind for some dishes but across every course in a tasting tasting menu just overwhelms the palate and makes you feel gross by the end of the meal.

But, I should've known better then to let my expectations become too bloated. Like many scenarios in life, expectations and reality didn't align. While the sophisticated decor and attentive service would warrant the \"Best New Restaurant\" designation, Flour + Water fell short in the area that matters the most...the food! \n\nHowever, it seems the rest of the population doesn't agree as my friend and I were unable to lock in a reservation. So, we came early and nabbed a spot at the communal table instead (bar seating is also available for walk-ins). Portions are on the smaller side, so we ended up sharing the following four dishes:\n\n1) Rosemary papperdelle with braised duck & broccoli di ciccio\n2) Cappellacci dei briganti with rabbit polpettine & kale\n3) Salsiccia pizza (rabe, sausage, montasio & caramelized onions)\n4) Roasted brussel sprouts with tesa & preserved lemon\n\nBesides having annoyingly long names, the two pastas were the worst of the bunch. Al dente pasta may be healthier and even tastier to some, but the pasta in these dishes were borderline undercooked. Between the two, the Cappellacci was the stronger dish as the sauce had more depth and flavor. \n\nFlour + Water has also garnered specific recognition for it's pizza. However, the Salsiccia that we ordered fell somewhere in the expansive territory of \"good.\"  Not extraordinary, but still a worthwhile dish to check-out if you're going to dine here. I did appreciate the flavor that the caramelized onions added, and I usually don't even like onions.   \n\nSurprisingly, the roasted brussel sprouts were my favorite out of everything we ordered. It had a delicious charred flavor to it, and if I could eat brussel sprouts that tasted like that everyday, I'd have no problems getting my daily veggies in. \n\nOverall, it was a good one time experience, but I don't think I'd be too keen on going again. 3.5 STARS.", "author": "Natasha H."}

We both did the tasting menu-  7 courses with wine pairings for approx $150 each. We sat the bar. Usually when a restaurant offers a tasting menu it's a phenomenal experience. Tonight's tasting menu was average/just okay. Nothing special. Our bartender, Eric, who served us on this Wednesday evening was pleasant but practically ignored us even though the bar wasn't very busy. His only interaction was to pour our wine. No exchange of friendly pleasantries. We had to ask him to bring us water and also bread that the other diners at the bar were already enjoying one hour into the meal. He never introduced himself (I only found his name on the bill) and never once checked on us to inquire how we were enjoying our meal. This is why we only gave him a $40 instead of $60 tip (which was still overly generous). The portions were tiny and our dessert was sorbet. Usually if a restaurant is offering you ice cream for dessert they are cutting corners. It is a bit easy. It's not a true dessert. (This is from my French guy and I think it makes sense.) Our entire check for two which included only the two tasting menus was $336 including tip. I definitely think your money would be better spent somewhere else.", "author": "Mela P."}

My Boo and I immediately wanted to return and made a reservation on the way out for the next available, decently timed Friday: Feb. 28th. We went with two other friends and it was all unanimous: Absolutely incredible.\n\nIt seems most negative reviews have come from the same things:\n\n1) Reservations not being honored on time\n2) Rude waitstaff\n3) Small portions\n\nOn both of my trips I didn't experience problems with 1 or 2 as we were seated on time and everyone was very friendly and knowledgeable when it came to the wine. \n\nWhen it comes to point 3, I did feel like the pasta was very small for the price my first time around. But on my second trip, it seems F+W listened to criticism because the portions were noticeably larger. For real. The four of us were able to split every pasta and all felt satisfied. I wish they had more than four pizza choices (one of which is Margherita, the equivalent of vanilla ice cream to me), but the few that I've had all stand up to some of the best.\n\nI find their pastas perfectly cooked and the flavor combinations really exciting. I can see why if you'd have to wait an hour for your resies or you had a rude waiter it would taint your experience, but I didn't have those problems and it doesn't change the food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-08-25", "description": "After reading some articles online that Flour + Water was supposed to have the best pizza in SF (one claimed top 10 in the country), I was curious to see what made them so fantastic.  After eating there, I'm still curious to see what's supposed to make them so fantastic.  \n\nDropped in on a Monday night with Jenny K. so that we could catch up and see what Flour + Water was all about.  We waited for about 30 minutes for a table, but it was fine since it was a shorter wait than on a weekend (the fact we had glasses of wine in hand the whole time didn't hurt either).  After taking our seats at the bar and getting the bartender/server's recommendations, we ended up ordering:\n\n- Melon Salad with Grapes, Pickled Shallots, and Olive Sea Salt - pretty refreshing and it looked great.  With all the different fruits, it was a colorful dish to say the least.  I wondered if it would end up tasting like a fruit salad, but it was fine.  A decent starter.\n\n- Salsiccia Pizza - thin crust pizza with tomato, sausage, gaeta olives, and smoked mozzarella...it was just \"ehh\".  I liked the smokey flavor from their wood oven, but the rest of the pizza didn't amaze me.  I generally like thin crusts, but this might have been a little too thin - the edges were fine, but the center was soggy from the sauce/oil.  The cheese and sausage were good, but I wish there had been a little more of both.  Also, while the ingredients might have contributed to it, I thought the pizza dough was really salty.\n\n- Farfalle with Braised Pork and Pesto - definitely my least favorite of the night.  The braised pork was what originally caught my eye, but the meat was bland.  Maybe the pesto wiped out the flavor, but I still expected more since it was braised.  Didn't like the the consistency of the pasta either, as the ends were tender but the center/pinch felt kind of grainy-ish (if that makes sense).  \n\n- Chocolate Budino with Espresso Caramel Cream and Sea Salt - if/when I were to ever come back, this would be a big reason as to why.  Similar to a ganache with a velvety texture, it was really good.  It's a little rich with the cream, but the sea salt helps to cut some of that.  I'm never really sure what to think when the dessert ends up being the best dish of the night (especially at a pizza place), but it's hard to argue with how good it is.  \n\nI'm glad the meal ended on a positive note, but I didn't think the rest of the dishes held up their end.  If I walked in without knowing anything about Flour + Water, I might have liked them better, but I couldn't help but feel disappointed.  The service and dessert were a plus, but the rest of the food was relatively uneven.  I wouldn't necessarily rule out coming back but given the price, I'd lean towards trying a new place like Zero Zero, or going back to a favorite like Beretta instead.

The squid inky things were the highlight of the evening, delicately spicy and perfectly textured. \"The bomb\" a fancy truffly dish was underwhelming. Finally, we had the roasted chicken, which was ... roasted chicken. There's not much more to say about it.

We had the pappardelle with braised veal and and charred walla walla onion, which had so much flavor and depth.  The pappardelle was perfectly cooked. We also had the rabbit tortellini with padron peppers, tomato and olives.  I also loved the texture of the pasta and thought the padron peppers were added a bit of a kick.  Not sure if they used truffle oil on the two pasta dishes but you could definitely taste mushroom.  \n\nWe also ordered the porchetta di testa pizza with padron peppers.  This was literally pigs' face, which looks like proscuitto but a bit fattier.  The combination of the porchetta and peppers was excellent - I really enjoyed this one, and I thought the pizza was just slightly burnt the way I like it.  \n\nTHE OKAY\n\nWe started with the marinated squid, which came out looking beautiful, but was a bit bland and not special.  Next we had the affettati misti, which consisted of mixed cured meats (including mortadella) which were not particularly memorable or tasty, except for the dab of rabbit liver mousse which was super rich.  \n\nI wouldn't choose either of these appetizers again.  \n\nTHE BAD\n\nI've tried to come to Flour + Water several times, but there's always a huge wait, so I've given up every time and gone somewhere else.  This time I planned for a wait and was determined to try the restaurant.  I stopped by at 6:30 pm on a weeknight, was told it would be 1.5 hours for 3 people, but that I could leave my number.  So I left my number and headed off.   All good so far.  1 hour in I got a text saying that my table was going to be ready soon, and I had been instructed by the maitre d' that I needed to respond to let them know if I was on my way, and after ten minutes, the table would be given away.   So we came back and checked in at 7:35.  She said we were top of the list.  We still waited another 35 minutes before we got seated.  This was because she wanted to seat us at the communal table where another party of 3 had just paid their bill.  But as she should have noticed (and we certain did),  they had a 2/3 bottle of rose left, with full wine glasses, and were comfortably chatting away with no chance of leaving for awhile.   Maybe this was just unfortunate.  But in the meantime, she seated two other parties of four at tables, and when we asked about it, she just said she was dealing with the Tetris of it all.  Presumably this meant that she would much rather seat us at the communal table to take over the party of 3 rather than have us waste a table of 4.  All fine and dandy, but not when we got called back too early to watch a group of diners finish off their bottle of rose. \n\nDespite the waits, the restaurant is incredibly packed and lively.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-03-03", "description": "Flour + Water has been one of the most hyped restaurants in San Francisco over the past couple years, and reservations were difficult to obtain, even on a Monday night. I managed to snag a reservation for 9:15PM, but my friend and dining companion, who owns a restaurant, suggested we show up early and simply try to get a table as they do reserve a few seats for walk-ins. \n\nWe arrived right before 6:00PM and were in fact seated right away. Unfortunately, it was at the communal table near the door. The communal table is a long and high faux-oak table that seats about 10 people. The height of the table requires you to sit on bar stools that are extremely uncomfortable. But it was either sit here, or wait 3 hours. We took the seats. \n\nLooking around the restaurant, I noticed that wood is definitely a theme. There seems to be a lot of wooden accents on what would otherwise be modern d\u00e9cor. Whether you like it or not doesn't really matter though, as they keep the lighting so low it's difficult to see anything clearly. Hell, they even use candles and Christmas tree lighting in the bathroom. \n\nWe started with the Kale salad ($12) served with walnuts, nepitella and lemon vinaigrette. The kale was fresh and well prepared and the vinaigrette had just the right amount of tartness to balance out the salad. Nothing special, but no complaints about this dish.\n\nSince the pasta here is suppose to be great, we ordered 3 dishes to try. We sampled the rigatoni, pappardelle, and briganti. The rigatoni is a squid ink pasta with sardines and san marzano. This pasta was not good and the only one we didn't finish. In fact, we each probably only took 2 bites. The rigatoni tasted far too much like actual squid. And no, I don't mean squid that's been rendered and cooked in olive oil, I mean just squid. Normally, squid ink pasta is one of my favorite dishes, this one was just done poorly. However, I will say that the rigatoni, like all the pastas, were cooked properly, meaning al dente.\n\nNext was the fennel pollen pappardelle with braised pork ($21). Like the rigatoni, this pasta was cooked perfectly, but unlike the rigatoni, the pappardelle was also flavored correctly. The pork, mixed with olives, went very well with the pappardelle, making this the best dish of the night.\n\nThe final pasta was the briganti ($21), which is essentially pointy-hat shaped pasta. This was cooked with beef and lime. It is also served with a healthy sprinkling of cheese on top. This was also a nice dish. Not mind-blowing, but decent.\n\nWe ended the meal with mixed roast pork with mushrooms and salsa verde ($26). The pork came in 2 forms, thick chunks and medium slices. What the menu doesn't mention is that they put some kind of vegetable (kale I think) puree on top. You are also given extra au jus in case you want more flavor. The pork, especially the medium cut slices were good, as soon as I lathered it with the sauce and scraped off the puree. \n\nOne final note about the food. You need to request bread, which you should do, as their focaccia is warm, toasted and great for lapping up the sauces you like.\n\nThe servers were responsive, even if it did take them a while to take our order, and no one gave us any attitude, which I was half expecting after reading other reviews. \n\nAfter finishing the pork, sitting in those stools really started to hurt. And, as there were many people waiting for seats, we decided to skip dessert and go to Atlas Caf\u00e9, which is about one block away, for coffee (I will post a review shortly).\n\nOur experience at Flour + Water was decidedly mediocre. It's hard to enjoy a meal when your seats are uncomfortable. But, even ignoring the swiveling bar stools, only one dish, the pappaardelle stood out. Everything else was OK, but when you're charging over $20 for a bowl of pasta, it should do a little better than just OK.", "author": "N. C. L."}

We made the reservation a few weeks in advance and had no trouble, 6ppl is the max there. We all went in on their pasta tasting menu and a few of us had the wine pairing. We got a little loud I think, so sorry! The staff was super polite and I hope we weren't too much trouble.\n\nThe pastas were generally all stellar, with exotic flavor combinations and fantastic homemade pasta dough. Highlight was the Tagliarini with Calabrian chili and uni. The sauces were pretty consistently butter or fat based (no ragu or pesto or tomato sauces) leaving the focus just on the pasta itself and the fillings. Philosophically, I had no problem with this, but it did make the whole meal pretty rich despite being the right amount of food. Our server switched half way through, but both of them were great. Approach was hands-off but always around. \n\nWine pairing was the real miss here. I love Italian wine, but if you are going to charge 50/p for a wine pairing, and 3 of the tastings are prosecco, Pinot Grigio, and Moscato, then they better be the best damn examples of those wines ever. They weren't, they came across as the bland everyday wines that they often are, which was a shame. The other wines were good: a timorasso (rich, unoaked white), a schiava (great aromatic alpine red) and then two Nebbiolos, one from Lombardy (but not valtellina??) and one Barbaresco. In the end we should have ordered a bottle or two of good Nebbiolo and it would have paired well with everything. So one star off for the pairing.\n\nI would absolutely come here again, we also had the charcuterie board before everything else and that was freaking stellar, and the the pastas were well made and composed.", "author": "Rory K."}

But after finally (being able to afford) dining there, I'm so glad I got to try it -- gotta admit, it was worth the hype all along!\n\nI had a farfalle with braised rabbit and charred leeks pasta dish and a prosecco braised brussels sprouts, cabbage, and prosciutto contorni. Both dishes were tastefully executed and managed to strike the perfect balance between modern sophistication and rustic heartiness. The farfalle featured the perfect proportion of tender, juicy shreds of lean rabbit meat to toothsome al dente pasta, and I loved the ultra fresh and misshapen house-made bow tie noodles -- they lent the dish a rustic, homey character. Otherwise homey dishes were elevated by a modern farm-to-table sensibility, which was evident in the use of fresh, seasonal ingredients around which the daily rotating menu is based. Overall, I was impressed by how delicious, filling, and satisfying the food was given the relative lightness of my dishes and the simplicity of the cooking techniques used - nothing was too rich, greasy, or heavy.\n \nMy meal was definitely on the pricey side for the portion size, but between the exceedingly fresh ingredients and the quality of the cooking, it was worth every penny.

Deep and rich, the tagliolini with chanterelles, mousserons, shallot & nepitella ($16) was also on the small side.

Obviously, A16 and Pizzeria Delfina have nothing to worry about.  Rounding out the otherwise unspectacular meal, the braised broccoli di ciccio with young onion and chili ($7) was nothing special.\n\nDo not expect a quiet, romantic evening at Flour + Water:  all surfaces in the minimally decorated dining room are hard and flat, reflecting the overly loud music and din of other diners and making conversation without raising your voice nearly impossible.\n\nMr. Bauer aptly summed up Flour + Water, \"The interior is cramped, seating only 49.

Our group of 12 sat in one of the private dining rooms, upstairs from the restaurant.

The lighting was dim-lit, and the fixtures were kind of rustic.\n\nWe had a tasting menu, all served family style.  Each course came out in several dishes, which made it easier to share around such a large table.  \n\n# focaccia bread  \n-- Came with olive oil for dipping. This bread was so good that it was a challenge to not fill up on this.\n\n# chicory salad with walnut, sunchoke, mushrooms & nocino vinagrette\n\n# cured sardines with avocado, citrus & dungeness crab butter\n\n# maltagliati with king trumpet mushrooms, sunchoke & thyme\n-- Thick strips of delicious al dente pasta\n\n# agnolotti dal plin\n-- Tiny ravioli stuffed with pork.\n\n# parma - san marzano, flor di latte, prosciutto, parmigiano reggiano & arugula\n-- I thought this tasted much better than the prosciutto pizza that's served at Pizzeria Delfina.

I'd probably skip out on these next time.\n\n# braised winter greens with chili, lemon & parmigiano reggiano - Maybe I was too full at this point, but I didn't find these to be too impressed. They just tasted like salty Southern-style collard greens\n\n# chocolate budino with expresso cream & sea salt\n-- A good mix of sweet and salty. The texture is like a thick pudding/custard.  Very rich.

Did not change after 5:30 but we figured to leave one more message. We arrive 15 minutes late and are told that \"the grace period is over\". Expla to front staff we called numerous times and left messages. Reply: the front desk doesn't get messages. Why in the world would anyone even offer this service if it's not going to be used? In other words, beware of needing to call this restaurant and needing to talk to a live person. And also keep in mind that the entire party must be present in order to be seated.\nThat being said, we were thankfully still seated and the food, for the most part, was delicious.

Do not come here without getting a pizza.\n\nThe Stone Fruit salad (sliced plums, avocado, ricotta) looked small, but the portion size was better than I initially thought because of the ricotta. It was a perfect mid-summer appetizer. \n\nAnd finally the Caramelle pasta (pepper and chanterelle in candy wrapper-shaped pasta in green padron pepper sauce) which was good and had an almost Mexican inspired taste because of the padrons, but I'd probably pass on next time for something a bit more traditional.\n\nService was excellent.

This place is ALWAYS packed, however I was encouraged to arrive on time for our reservation and be seated within minutes, despite perhaps 10-15 people standing around waiting outside and every table and bar seat at the restaurant being full (at a popular 715pm time slot).  Adds a bit of legitimacy to the Opentable reservation process...Very hard to walk-in and not wait for 45min+ or get a reservation before 9pm on short notice...\n\nAnyways, we started with an albacore crudo appetizer, followed by a pork & carmelized onion-stuffed agnolotti pasta special, then a margherita pizza.  We also shared a oven-blistered pepper and corn side dish, and finished off with a chocolate budino and an almond corn-meal cake for desert. .  Everything was wonderful, including the bread (must be requested) which is from a bakery called Firebrand in the East Bay (it was sooo good I needed to inquire). In my opinion, the pasta dish was the highlight of our meal, and time after time the f+w pastas are consistently delicious and pack a bit more creativity and flavor than the pizzas and entrees.  While I do thoroughly enjoy the pizzas at f+w, I would rank them slightly below the pizzas of a similar style wood-oven style at A-16 or Tony's Pizza Napoletana.  Wine list is excellent and the desserts are also very creative and flavorful.  \n\nOverall, the experience was great, albeit there was a bit of server confusion at points, perhaps attributed to the crowd.  The closest comparable I can give this restaurant is A-16, however each has separate strengths and weaknesses.  Overall, I visit A-16 more often, which is a bit larger and also always very crowded, but I seem to be able to get more favorable reservation times there.

Props to Flour + water's wine list focusing on Old World Italian vino as I thoroughly enjoyed the 2007 Paitin Barbaresco and 2008 Torre Quarto Uva di Troia.  All things considered, F+W's worth at least one try and perhaps a revisit if you're local.  For me and my 1-hour trek out here though, one shot was enough considering that the weakest dishes were the pastas of all things.", "author": "Eric F."}

It was slightly a bit too al-dente, but I appreciate immensely that it was fresh pasta.  I'd order it again. \n\nStrozzapretti w/ Pork ($17.00) - I enjoyed this dish the most.

It was good!  I really liked the mushrooms. Yum.  Though the crust wasn't good, it was off... some parts were really salty and others were really bland.  Maybe they didn't mix the dough enough. \n\nAlong with two beers ($9.00 and $11.00), our total came to $87.00 + 8.27 tax = $95.27 + tip for the two of us.  \n\nService was fantastic; we sat at the bar.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-01-22", "description": "So - I want to start that if I could have given two and a half stars I would have.\n\nI have been hearing about this restaurant for a very long time - and my friends and I could not get it together enough to plan ahead to get a coveted reservation but when I called the restaurant I was told that they keep \"half the restaurant as well as the bar and our communal table\" open for walk ins - she indicated that they opened at 5:30 and it was first come first served.\n\nSo - we did just that.  Got there about 5:15 and we were greeted by a line already forming - which to me was great news.  If people were willing to wait in line this place must be great.  \n\nOnce the restaurant opened we slowly waited our turn in line and were lucky enough to get the very last seats at the communal table.  I will say that it was slightly misleading in that I didn't see anyone that did not have a reservation being seated at tables - only at the bar and the communal table - but we got a seat.\n\nI will say the food was really good - we started with two of us having the crab and beet salad and the third having the chicory salad.  The crab and beet salad was delish - fresh crab, fresh beets - it was really good.  \n\nSince we were not sure if we would ever be back we opted to each order a pasta and then try one of the pizzas to share.   It did take a bit for our main courses to come but we were willing to wait - even though the room was quickly filling up with people waiting for tables - so sitting at the communal table you started to feel a  bit \"bad\" as they were all sitting watching us.\n\nSo - finally our main courses are delivered - and my order was incorrect.  The person who served it immediately took it away and must have gone to our server - who I will say did come over and apologize for her screw up and said my meal would be out shortly.  To her credit she did bring me a plate so I could at least enjoy a piece of pizza while I waited.\n\nOne of us had the spinach pasta with the roasted pork - which he thought was delicious and the other had the cauliflower ravioli like dish and it was really good.  The 4 cheese pizza we had was good - not jumping through hoops amazing - but not bad.\n\nBy the time my correct pasta came out - my friends were done eating.  This irritated me a bit although I try to have sympathy for the kitchen but it was a bit awkward to be the only one eating my meal when my friends were done.\n\nThings continued to go downhill after this.  We did have dessert menus delivered but then it was a while before anyone came back to take our order - and in fact it was the woman who was re-setting the communal table for the next group overheard us talking and took our dessert order.\n\nDessert and coffee were ordered - at this time the restaurant was packed and it was standing room only in the small waiting area which was slowly getting annoying and louder and louder by the moment.  It was hard to hear early on but at this point it was near impossible.\n\nFinally dessert got there - which came before the coffee and it was really good.  Chocolate Budino was rich and delish and the Olive Oil cake with goodies was reallly good.  \n\nFinally we were done, dishes were cleared and we were more than ready to get out of of there.  When the bill finally came (by the new server btw - not sure where our original server went) we were ready to give her the check and it was forever before she came to take the credit cards.  Honestly - they were so clueless about us sitting there that we could have all left and I doubt anyone would have noticed.  But - we are not those people.  \n\nI will say I was slightly disappointed that the restaurant really did not offer anything for the fact the server put in the wrong pasta for my dinner - not only did that delay us quite a bit, it forced me to eat my pasta while my friends sat there and this was all due to our server making a mistake.  I get mistakes, they happen, but I think the restaurant could have done something to account for the error.\n\nAll in all I will say the food was good  - portions are not huge but that allowed us to try every course and food that they had to offer.  My issue was the feeling I had when I left which was one of irritation.  Service is huge when it comes to satisfaction for a restaurant - you cannot live on a good dish - you have to have a reason to want to come back and because of the service we had - I will not be running to go back.  There are so many great restaurants in SF that you need to be on your game and if they continue this lack of service experience, that line out the door will soon be gone.", "author": "Jen R."}

We waited for our friend to arrive by bicycle but were able to snag a four-top -- not just seats at the bar or the communal table. Score!  Dining where Steve Jobs could not... It probably helped that it was the week of Thanksgiving, but even still, the restaurant was packed by the middle of our meal.\n\nWe started with the cotechino sausage on a bed of lentils and local squid and smoked trotters (kind of like super tender corned beef, less salty.)  The kitchen had a mix up and sent us the wrong pasta dish, which they let us keep - stuffed with pumpkin and sprinkled with an amaretto cookie and shaved chestnuts. The pastas we ordered were stupendous - agnolotti, tiny pinched dumplings with ground pork shoulder and rabbit, and cocoa tajarin, which didn't taste like chocolate but had a certain delightful sweet earthiness with giblets in a brown butter sauce with braised giblets and butternut squash.  \n\nThe prosciutto and wild nettle pizza smelled heavenly, and the flavors were good, but the dollops of horseradish made the crust soggy. And surprisingly, the \"bread upon request\" is not made in-house but from Pinkie's in SOMA - a good crusty boule served with olive oil.\n\nEach couple had the \"mixed roast of pork\" which had three parts of the pig, including pork belly! Mmmm. We finished off the meal with the budino, more of a pot de cr\u00e8me than a little cake, sprinkled with sea salt, and the spice cake with quince and maple ice cream - delicious, but the budino is so fabulous you want to eat bowl after bowl.  We ordered two good bottles of wine, which added a bit to the bottom line.  Corkage is $15 or if you order one bottle, corkage is waved on what you bring in, so something to remember for next time.", "author": "Vanessa H."}

Said \"Why not?\" and went with the winter pasta tasting with the wine pairings.  Holy C*** that was a good choice!\n\nWhen we arrived, I was at first worried it would be too loud, and we'd be sharing the long table with other guests, which would not of been very intimate.  We weren't.  We were seated at a far more private table towards the back.  Maybe the big table is for people without a reservation?  I don't know.  Either way, the restaurant had a very casual feel, with fairly loud music, and a wait staff dressed in plaid shirts.  I iffy, but hopeful.  As it turned out, they knocked it out of the park.\n\nWe weren't sure about what to order, so asked our waitress a number of questions about both the food, and for a wine recommendation.  She knew a lot about both, and gave us 4 different recommendations for the wines.  We finally settled on the pairings instead, but I appreciate her knowledge anyway!  She was super nice, friendly, and professional the entire time, and was on the ball with clearing plates silverware etc.  This is no small feat considering there were 7 courses. :)\n\nAll of the pastas were great.  I enjoyed them all.  The lamb's tongue was a bit odd for me, and by the 6th course (duck) I was so full I could barely enjoy it.  We ended up taking most of the duck pasta home and finishing it later.  My favorites pasta was the second course.  It was a cheese course with balsamic reduction that was out of this world, paired with a semi sparkling wine.  Delicious.\n\nMy mark for a great dessert is something that makes you forget how full you are.  This hit the nail on the head.  Olive Oil cake with meyer lemon gelato with pistachio and white chocolate.  Absolutely great, and it was paired with the best dessert wine I've ever tasted.\n\n2 people doing pasta tasting and wine pairing, after tax and tip, ended up being just south of $300.  Not cheap, but fairly reasonably considering it included hte wine pairings.  The same thing without the wine woudl of been about $170 or so total I think.  It was a lot of money, and I'm NOT someone who has a lot of money.  That said, absolutely worth it, and I will come back here to do it again!  \n\nA+ and one of my new favorite places in the city.", "author": "Chris A."}

There's also a rustic feeling to it just because they have old-fashion light bulbs hanging off the ceiling and real, long wooden table at one end.\n\nWe got there about 15 minutes after the place opened.  Parking was an ease but when I first glanced at the place, I almost freaked out because I saw all these people trying to get in.  I was hungry and thinking \"oh God....an hour wait?\"  Thank god I was wrong and we actually got seated right away.  It was a communal table but seats were already filling up so we didn't have a choice. I'm okay with sharing too.  It's a little tight but that's alright.\n\nThe staff was really friendly and happy to help us with explaining which wine was best and descriptions of all of their food.  They give you a complementary sparkling water which I was very surprised about.  I LOVE sparkling water.  Most places charge!\n\n We started off with the mint chitarra with dungeness crab, fennel, sea bean, romanesco and chili.  The dish wasn't that big but it was very well made.  One of the best pasta dishes that I've had so far.  We also ordered the Salsiccia pizza which had sausages on it and I was intrigued by the Osso (bone marrow) pizza so I gave that a try.  Surprisingly enough, both of the pizzas were delicious.  I personally liked the Osso more because the taste was richer.  It was a tad bit oily but I think it might have been the cheese.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my meal here.  The communal table gave us no privacy especially because our neighbors ended up budding into our conversations a couple of times.  However, I do have to say that we were sandwiched between very sophisticated and pleasant people.  All I really remember was that my boyfriend was debating with the lady right next to him about whether the table was real wood or veneer.  The man next to me said \"trust me, I've never won a conservation with her!\"  And....he was right.  My boyfriend lost the debate.", "author": "Shirley T."}

Simply amazing.\n\nNext was maybe the best pasta I've ever had, a cocoa infused spaghetti like pasta with squash, sage, and giblets sauteed in brown butter which coated the pasta.  Topped with a fresh grating of some type of hard cheese.  Tasted like Thanksgiving in a bowl, only better.\n\nNext pasta were these hand rolled \"purses\" of tallegio cheese with a butter sauce and drizzled with an amazing aged balsamic.  Again, fantastic.\n\nThe handmade pastas are simply incredible here.  \n\nAlso tried a slice of the GF's margherita pizza.  Good, but no better than a handful of other margherita pizzas I've had.  Then again, I'm not the biggest fan of margherita pizzas.

It is the perfect, a few times a week casual but delicious, friendly, neighborhood pasta place I've always dreamed of. So many hits, and so few misses (and I suspect the few misses I've had had more to do with my personal preferences than anything else).  I am so happy this place is around. While I love the more fancy pants restaurants, if I had to choose only one restaurant to stay open in SF, it would be this one. \n\nAnything I've had with shellfish or seafood and pasta has been amazing (especially the tarragon chittara with sea urchin and then this flat squid ink pasta with pork sausage and sea urchin..mmmmmm), as has all the sweet corn dishes of late summer (the three or four different pastas minus the one that tasted like lunchables pepperoni... the singular unpleasant thing I've had in a year of dining and then there was the absolutely to die for amazing sweet corn bonet pudding thing.....). The pasta is definitely what shines here the most, though they often have good desserts and appetizers too, and I do recall one particularly succulent quail entree. I also really like their wine selection. They had a gragnano and two lambruscos that are my go-tos every time. Light and bubble and crisp, for my palate at least, they balance out all the butter really nicely.\n\nI think the tasting menu is usually the way to go, but generally I pick and choose. The best way to get a seat is to go early or late, or if you need to go in the middle of the dinner rush, eating alone is a good bet. there have been so many times there has been a two hour wait for everyone where I, as a single diner, have been able to snag that one long seat at the bar. \n\nThe staff are genuinely the sweetest and most gracious and personable or anywhere I have ever dined. It sounds ridiculously cheese, but after you come in a few times, it really does start to feel like family. Also, fact: everyone that works here is a total babe.\n\nMy only mediocre experience was booking the private dough room for my birthday. I felt they really didn't pay attention to what I wanted as far as flavor profiles and requests and we ended up with a bunch of dishes that I personally really couldn't stand and that were not their best options.

Last time, we went without a reservation around 6:30 on a Friday and ended up seated 40 minutes later.  (In the past, I've sometimes been told that it would be a 1.5 hour wait, but I don't think it's ever actually been more than 50 minutes.)  They take down your phone number and text you when your table's ready, which is nice.  If you get a leisurely cup of coffee down the street while you wait, it doesn't seem like such a hardship.  \n\nGrab a seat at the bar if you can and you'll get a great view of the kitchen.  The menu changes frequently, but last week we had mezzalune with beets and pork raviolini, and both were sublime.  (The mezzalune were particularly wonderful-- plus the half-moons are all a gorgeous purple-red color!)  The pizza looks delicious and I keep meaning to try it, but I always get pulled back to the pasta in the end.  I mean, I know plenty of other places that serve good pizza.  But the pasta here is something special.  And for dessert, you can't beat the chocolate budino.", "author": "Chris L."}

I assume because reservations are hard to come by and there is a community table that people can eat at if they're lucky. \n\nHe had been here before but I've always wanted to try it because it's so close and always seems so busy. We were lucky enough to get some decent 8:00 reservations. We had to wait 20 minutes after our allotted time to be seated, but no harm. The decor was nice and simple. \n\nThey have a great selection of wine, and we enjoyed a few different kinds- mostly Italian wines (surprise surprise).\n\nI do have to say I was a bit let down by the food. The deviled egg dish was tiny and not very amazing, lacking flavor. I had the lamb ravioli as my main course. It was definitely yummy but the dish was so tiny, I was still hungry after. Luckily my boyfriend got a pizza and shared some with me. The pizza was quite good and if I ever go again, I'd probably just get of those instead as it's decently big and quite yummy.\n\nOverall, it's definitely a bit over-hyped but still a decently good experience.", "author": "Annette D."}

We both had plenty of help from the hostess and let us know that since we arrived later in the night (meaning after 8:30 on a Tuesday night), that our wait for a table would be about 20 minutes. We were seated in the bar, which had areas for us to place our bags. There, we had plenty of help from our waitress in assisting what we should order. We both got paired with great wines, reds and whites for our pasta dishes. I know my boss ordered the tortellini with mushrooms and I had the stradette with leeks and asparagus with fava beans. Both meals were delicious and not overly expensive for the portions. \n\nI would compare the restaurant to Local Mission Eatery, in the nonchalant atmosphere, welcoming environment and well prepared meals. Would I go here on a regular basis? No. I don't think it's worth the ridiculous wait that I've seen people do since the day it opened. It's great for an impressive date night or just some kind of special evening, or if you're in the neighborhood and want a nice meal. In my humble opinion, it's better than Heirloom Cafe, which was overly priced for a rather simplistic meal. I should also state that I'm mostly vegetarian with some occasions venturing on seafood, so I expect value for over-priced vegetables. \n\nThe table next to us had a ridiculously good looking salad and a magnificent pizza (think it's the biancoverde). On my next venture out there I'll try the pizza, which has had praise from practically every foodie magazine printed in SF.

You need to make a reservation way in advance but if you show up a little before they open at 5:30, you can basically get a table.\n\nWe showed up at 5:10 ish and there were actually ~20 people already ahead of us, so we ended up making the first seating albeit at the communal table. We ended up leaving around 8 PM very satisfied with the food and grateful to Sidrah for guiding us through a lovely dinner.\n\nOnce you are seated they immediately ask you if you want complimentary sparkling or still water and get right to it. Love it. Sidrah was very helpful in explaining the menu and might just about be the sweetest person ever.\n\nFrom the antipasti we had the cucumber and melon salad, pappa al pomodoro, and the albacore conserva (listed in the order that we most enjoyed). We also ordered a side (contorni) of eggplants with breadcrumbs that came out with the antipasti. You can also get bread if you ask for it, and it comes with a lovely olive oil.\n\nMy mom thought the cucumber and melon salad was going to be lame but it was so delicious. It came with whipped ricotta and fennel and mustard seeds and was so light and fresh and awesome! The pappa was described to us as a savory bread pudding, basically a tomato soup of sorts with bread and olives underneath, so rich and yummy. Finally the slow poached tuna had a really great texture and had a few big pieces of tuna. Yummy. \n\nThe eggplant was the only thing we disliked the whole night. The breadcrumbs were great but the eggplant itself was a little bitter.\n\nFrom the pastas we had the capellacci with rabbit, the goat's milk ricotta with beets, hazelnuts, and brown butter, and the herbed pappardelle with beef tongue (listed in the order that we most enjoyed). All of the pastas had a lovely soft texture and had great sauces. I would have previously told you that I had my favorite pasta at Scarpetta in Beverly Hills but this was definitely better.\n\nWe then had a margherita pizza and added mozzarella. The pizza is very thin and the tomato sauce is really fabulous. The pizza is definitely very good, but not the best I've ever had, and not as good as Pizzeria Mozza in LA. \n\nFinally we finished with all three dessert options, the chocolate budino, pistachio gelato with brown butter torta, and the peach and peach leaf panna cotta with blackberries and fennel [ can you guess what order I put them in? :) ]. My dad also had a decaf cappuccino which was good.\n\nThe chocolate in the budino is crazy smooth and the pisatchio gelato was so airy and creamy and the panna cotta was quite light.\n\nI love almost everything about this place. I love that before you can even register that your water carafe is empty they replace it with a new one. I love how service is a team effort here, it totally reminded me of The French Laundry. I love that they charge each guest $1.95 to provide full health and dental benefits to the staff. I love that they space your courses out so you can get excited for what's to come but don't sit there bored to tears.\n\nIf we were to come back we would probably do the pasta tasting since we basically had the whole menu except for secondi, but it was definitely a lovely dinner. \n\nCheers!", "author": "Dahlia S."}

(Corso took out its pizza oven, so the comparison between it and Flour+ is a bit strained.)  It's funny arriving here on foot from the 16th and Mission BART: I walked past a PGE lot and lots of other places that didn't seem to have much Mission cool.\n\nMission cool was definitely in evidence as I approached the restaurant.  We had a reservation for 3 people, and 3 people were standing at the podium at 5:50PM, 10 minutes before the reservation time.  Our host person was about to seat us, but then stopped dead in her tracks when I announced that a fourth person was expected but that this fourth person was still a couple of blocks away, on foot.  (I had phoned in the info that another friend was coming, but this info had never been entered into the computer system.)  The three of us had to stand around unseated until our party was \"complete.\"  Five minutes later, completion was ours, and we were seated a few moments before the official time of our reservation.\n\nI went for the early figs with cured duck, ramp bulbs, aceto balsamico & mustard greens ($11) and the maltagliati with pork sausage & lamb's quarters ($16).  Both dishes were delicious, but as other yelpers have pointed out, the portions are a bit small.  I drank the two special wines by the glass of the day (each $9.50), so you can see that things tend to get a bit pricey at this establishment.  To be honest, I would have left the restaurant hungry after these two dishes were it not for the tastes that my dining companions sent my way.  I very much liked the margherita pizza and thought that the raviolini with ricotta, nepitella& shaved porcinis was no slouch either.\n\nThe desserts looked good, but I definitely wanted to dessert myself at Humphry's, down the street.  Coffees come from Mr. Espresso in Oakland.\n\nI had long been eager to try Flour+Water.  I'm glad that I did!  If you live in the neighborhood, you should come often, or at least as often as you can afford to.  I'll probably be back, but not any time soon.", "author": "Kenneth R."}

Granted, they reservations were 2 months too late from when I wanted to go, and granted the shiny, newness of the establishment would have worn off by then, but what the hell.  \n\nNeedless to say, by the time my reservation came around, I wasn't very excited about the place.  Regardless, my boyfriend allowed me to drag him to yet another restaurant that I just had to try.  \n\nAmbiance:\nThe beakers remind me of work.  There is a huge business dedicated to making candle holders, so beakers that approximate, at best, volumes of 50 ml or less, shouldn't even be in the picture.\n\nService:\nAverage on all levels.\n\nFood:\nPretty good.\n\nWe ordered the oil poached albacore for our antipasti.  At first I was confused.  But then slowly it came to me.  We were basically served a deconstructed tuna salad.  The mayonnaise was actually made from the oil the albacore was poached in, which was thoughtful.  The thin celery shavings throughout added a nice texture and flavor.  \n\nThe margherita pizza was good.  We had it with a fried egg on top, which didn't add anything to the pizza.  The pizza sauce was flavorful, albeit salty, and that along with the crust is what stood out to me as the best parts.  \n\nNot sure why everyone is raving about the chocolate budino with espresso-caramel cream and sea salt.  It was nothing special.  If you've ever had any dessert or candy sprinkled with salt, it's the same thing.\n\nOverall: \nThere's some truth to the hype surrounding Flour + Water, but don't believe all of it.  If I could describe Flour + Water with one word, it would be savory, because everything from beginning to end was just that.", "author": "Sandy K."}

Some were waiting for the open seating and hoping they get into the community table. A little after a third of the line got seated a woman came out to say that the open seating was now full and only customers with reservations would be accepted until the next seating. I don't know how many seatings they have but you can wait and have drinks while waiting. Just a warning it will be over an hour wait.\n\nThe place was cozy w/ nice deco. The old school oven where they bake the pizzas was cool. \n\nWhen we sat down the server asked us what kind of complimentary water we would like still or sparkling and she even helped us pick out a nice red to go with our meal. \nWe started off with the Yellowtail w/ asparagus. Good but not great, the onion cracklings were a nice touch. \nNext came the Confit rabbit w/ pistachio this was a nice dish, instead of the pur\u00e9e I would have liked small pieces of rabbit instead. But overall very good and would order it again. \n\nFor our entree we ordered the Farro garganelli w pork which was my favorite dish of the night. Noodles were cooked perfectly, the flavor of the pork was spot on, and the sauce was crazy good. \nFor our 2nd we tried the Pork & savoy cabbage raviolini. This dish was also very good. I also agree with some that say a little al dente when it came to the pasta shell but you will get no complaints from me except that they needed to give me a big deep bowl full of it. \n\nFinally for dessert we ordered the Ricotta Panna Cotta. This was good but compared to the Chocolate Budino it was no contest. Hands down the one of the best desserts I've had in a while. Me and the wifey always share 2 different desserts but this time we should have gotten 2 of the same. the creamy Italian chocolate pudding with the cream & sea salt what a combo. Do I really need to say anything else? Topped off the night with a nice cup of cappuccino.\n\nGreat place for food, drinks, and conversation! Must visit.

If you look on Open Table right now, I guarantee that no reservation prior to 10:45 PM is available for the next month.

Arriving at 5:45, my friend put our name in for 3, was given a 90 minute wait time, and met us at Shotwells down the street for drinks. Checking in not 60 minutes later, we were seated \"early.\" But heh, if you don't have a reservation, you know you will have to wait. Deal with it and have patience. \n\nThe menu was a bit overwhelming and the smart phones were out to google the different pasta shapes. We settled on a good variety of pasta size, textures and sauces to share. We also ordered a margherita and some cannelli beans for the table. The pizza and beans came out first. This was an excellent margherita, fresh sauce, charred thin crust, and salty cheese. Now for the pasta: we got the rabbit papparadelle, rabbit sausage cavatelli, and the pork and mushroom \"priest choker\" pasta (can't remember the italian name, but thats the english translation.) All were very tasty and perfect in their own right. There was a big difference between the two rabbit dishes, that I really appreciated. The favorite of the table was the priest choker, not so much for the pasta shape as the sauce, which I attributed to the earthiness of the mushrooms. \n\nWine and dessert were on par with most fine dinning establishments. Service was friendly if not always prompt. Our food came out very quickly, but it was a bit difficult getting our server's attention; to be fair, she was very busy, not lazy. The whole establishment reflected a seriousness, yet a lack of pretension that made me feel like I was in Portland, not San Francisco. \n\nWill definitely go back to try the pasta tasting menu and explore some of the other pizzas.", "author": "Mackenzie B."}

It can be fairly difficult to get a reservation, so I made one in October for early December. Blindly picking a date and table number, crossing my fingers it would work out. Yesterday was the day! As many restaurants in SF, the restaurant is small and the tables fairly close together. However, I found myself able to hear my dining companion across the table (unlike other restaurants that are designed similarly). \n\nWe noshed on the bread and olive oil (you have to ask for it) while we decided what to order. We started with the chicories with crispy egg, squash, cauliflower, pepitas & prosciutto ($13). It was a delicious salad, and a great way to preface a pasta heavy meal. The crispy egg was coated in breadcrumbs and soft boiled. Finally, my partner and I shared two pasta entrees- the sedanini with bacon, swordfish, olive & chili breadcrumbs ($18 ) and the pork fattisu with charred cabbage, orange & black pepper ($18). The sedanini was decidedly spicey with a nice crunch from the breadcrubs, and lighter than the fattisu. The fattisu, a cheese and pork bow tie ravioli, was savory, and accompanied with a sauce that we ended up dipping out bread into. \n\nAfter waiting for almost a year to dine at this restaurant with high expectations I wasn't Disappointed. That alone, speaks to the quality of the food and service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-05-29", "description": "Yes, the wait here is pretty ridiculous, but your patience will be rewarded with perfect thin-crust gourmet pizza. First thing I noticed was the ambiance and the interior decor. The theme reminded me of one of those old gift shops in a small seaside town like Mendocino that sells assorted seashells, except a hundred times dimmer. In fact, if you check out the bathroom, the toilet faces a whole cabinet stocked with little seashell trinkets and such. The dining area wall is adorned with a painting of a nautilus facing the communal table and a big mural in the back is painted with sardines. Very cool. Except, I didn't understand how the chemistry beaker candles fit into the whole seaside theme. \n\nAfter waiting an hour (which isn't bad considering we thought it would be longer), we were luckily seated at a table in the back without having to share space at the bar or communal table. We quickly ordered two pizzas to share: the carbonara and the emilia romagna. I found the pizza toppings here to be quite revolutionary. In most instances, I judge how much I like a pizza by its crust, but I love the toppings here. The flavors here are a work of art. I loved both pizzas equally. The carbonara had a great creamy flavor, most likely from the egg emulsion, and I could really taste every ingredient separately. The hen of the woods mushrooms paired really well with the pea tendrils and the bacon wasn't overpowering as a topping for once. Overall, it had a great peppery flavor. It had great balance in flavors and the crust was both flaky and chewy. The emilia romagna surprised me even more. I've had so many bad experiences with pesto pizzas. Pesto can be too bold of a flavor, but the ramp pesto was very mild. The mortadella was delicious and went well with the leeks and pesto. I would have never thought to use that type of sausage on a pizza. We also had the not-so-bright idea of adding a farm egg onto the emilia romagna. For future reference, there is no need for the farm egg. It provides no additional flavor, but gives you a runny texture on your pizza. \n\nFor dessert, I had to try the chocolate budino with espresso-caramel cream and sea salt. I've been obsessed with sea salt paired with rich, sweet flavors. My first experience was trying a sea salt coffee, which I thought really enhanced the sweet flavors of the coffee. The budino was excellent. The cream wasn't heavy and again, I loved the sea salt with espresso and chocolate. I really like the texture of budino. I want to say it's like a pudding, but it's not as gloppy and it has a smoother texture. I would say it's between a pudding and ganache. \n\nI was really happy that I finally got to eat here. The service was good for the most part too. The hostess kept checking in on us while we were waiting and offered us water. It took us two requests to get the bread to our table, but it wasn't that good, especially with the olive oil so maybe the waitress was trying to tell us something. Overall, the pizza is worth coming here for. And the price of the pizza is worth what you're paying.  If you're a pizza connoisseur, you have to try it because Flour + Water takes pizza to the next level. Just make sure you have a reservation a month in advance so you don't end up eating dinner at 11:00 pm.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

There isn't really any waiting room inside, you can awkwardly stand around in the entrance and constantly excuse yourself as people try to move in and out around you, the bar area is full of seated people so you can't really mill about there either.  Beer and wine only from what i could see.\n\nThe food is fantastic and well-documented in here, from appetizer to desert.  There was a prix-fixe the night we were there, $65 for the food and $40 for the wine paring, so $105 each for tasting and paring.  Each serving wasn't really a sharing size, but each dish was so good you probably wouldn't want to share it.  The spagetti with black pepper was fantastic, loved it.\n\nThe menu changes regularly and I like when a menu has today's date on it, let's you know it's a dynamic list that changes as seasonal options become available.\n\nThe service is fantastic too, our waiter was fun and accommodating.\n\nSo yes, it's a pain to get in there but it's a cozy and romantic neighborhood-y place that is worth the effort to try, if only to see what all the hype is about and chances are you are going to be offered something unique and interesting any time you visit.", "author": "Doug M."}

After all it was a Wednesday?  At 7p we put our name in for a table for 2 and were told 30 minutes... Great!  Then they said we could make ourselves at home and we can easily order a glass of wine... also, Great!  We packed ourselves in, like vertical sardines and waited... did get some very nice wine... and we waited more.  I could go on and on, I could mention we watched a woman obliterate a wine glass into thousands of pieces and saw a fellow patron nearly light her back on fire by leaning into a lit candle, but I will spare further details.  We waited for 2 hours.\n\nFinally, we started talking to a couple who were in the same predicament.  We noticed that there were no tables for 2, but often tables for 4 went empty.  We decided to combine our efforts and get one of those tables for 4 and get some food!  Even that was a cluster... we communicated with one hostess, but a different hostess seated our new party of 4 and was totally confused - quite awkward.  As far as we could tell, my original reservation evaporated.  We never would have been seated if we didn't meet this gracious couple and come up with a plan B.\n\nWas the food great?  Yes.  Was it worth a 2 hour wait?  No.  Somewhere a hostess dropped the ball and Flour + Water did not acknowledge a thing.  In fact, the first hostess had a \"go-team\" happy attitude and gave us kudos for fixing our dilemma on our own!  Hilarious!\n\nI am grateful to the other couple for sharing their table, otherwise, we never would have had dinner.

I wanted to like Flour + Water.... I truly did. I made our reservation 3 months prior and excitedly awaited our meal. We arrived promptly for our 7pm reservation and were seated right away. Sweet. We ordered two glasses of wine, both were excellent. Then we ordered our meal, the margherita pizza and the salumi fattisu. Seriously our meal came out in less than 10 min. Okay, that was a little too fast (we suddenly felt rushed) and not sure how you can make a fresh pasta and pizza so quickly, but okay, no judgements... Then we took a bite. \n\nThe crust was indeed crunchy but chewy (yum- not traditional Italian, but quite an achievement). But then there was the rest.  A good margherita pizza has whole pieces of basil, a good sauce (not too much) and cheese- not piled on American style but fresh mozzarella rounds throughout. Well, I couldn't find the mozzarella or basil on my pizza. It was crust and tomato sauce overload. Out of all the slices, 4 had no cheese whatsoever. Bummer. \n\nAnd then there was the salumi fattisu... Simply said, it tasted like a hot dog in not so good pasta with mustard sauce. The sauce was so overwhelming with the mustard flavor and such a tiny tiny portion. My fianc\u00e9 isn't a big guy. He's an average athletic dude. He forced himself to eat the not tasty meal and then ate half my subpar pizza to make up for his tiny portion. Also at no point did anyone ask us if we wanted more wine (even though we finished our glasses halfway through the meal). We didn't even bother with dessert and coffee. We paid and bailed. \n\nI felt so bad for the terrible meal that we walked over to Specchio to share a few bites of their incredible pasta and a glass of wine to ensure our night ended on a high note. You want legit real pasta and pizza Italian style? Walk 4 blocks over on to Mission (between 19th and 20th) and eat at Specchio. The food is incredible. The experience spectacular.

I have been back to the place about once a month, and when I was not there, I dreamed about my returning.  Perhaps, it is no longer an addiction, but an obsession.  Whatever you called it, I strongly recommended the place.  That is, if you can get a reservation or don't mind standing in line and wait since about half of their restaurant is reserved for walk in.\n\nIn regards to the decor, it is somewhat rustic industrial, with high ceiling and concrete floor, and Edison light bulbs (I am so tired of seeing these things all over the places).  When you walked in, you immediately see the communal table and the bar.  As your eyes moved downward, wooden tables and chairs, not the most comfortable and inviting ones, but people still lingered in them.  \n\nWhat's lacked in the decor is definitely made up by the pasta and antipasti.  Folks raved about Cotogna, Delfina..., but none of these places come close to F+W's pasta.   Each time I ate there, I was transported back to Italy.  The freshest seasonal ingredients incorporated into each dish.  The aroma of the sauce as the staff plated the dish in front of you...It was heaven in one plate.  The plate is getting more expensive.  Oh, I you like a big plate of pasta, you will be disappointed.\n\nTo me, you go to F+W to eat pasta, though their pizza and main entries are good, I had better at other places.  Perhaps, it was because by the time I had several pasta, I was full and these other items were no longer seem as appealing.  I also noted that sometime their pizza, especially tin he middle, can be a bit soggy.  However, I often observed that some people just go there for their pizza and wine/beer.  \n\nSo, if you have a chance, give it a try.  Oh, don't get turn off because the pasta seems to be on a smaller portion.  Once you have a couple, I assure you that you will be full since they are quite rich.  And when you ordered, pick the ingredients that you like, even when the combination of ingredients seem peculiar to you, trust me, it will turn out great.  If you are overwhelmed about which one to order, ask your server, and they generally have good recommendations.

It seemed deceptively short because of course we got there shortly after it had just opened at 5:30pm but the crowd that was apparently waiting in line before they opened were seated and the dining room was full. It was a long hour and a half wait, but luckily inside- a little shelter from the hard SF cold. So, you have to have a bevvie to pass the time. The aperitif I took was fairly delicious but at $12 a drink, I would expect quality.  Granted my pasta was more reasonably priced at $16 for the francobolli (smoked duck with orange & sumac) and the pasta did live up to the reputation. The roast pork with beans & prosciutto was decent too. Cappuccino was excellent and the dessert -chocolate budino (a rich chocolate custard) with a delightful pairing of espresso caramel cream was divinely sprinkled with sea salt. \nNot a huge fan of the communal tables. I'd rather go here with a good group of friends (it's too noisy for an intimate date) and the seating is so close. Avoid the seat by the window closest to the door- very awkward table leg placement which forces you to straddle the leg to pull your chair in so you don't get bumped by the millions of people hanging out waiting for a table to open. The chairs at the communal table were also -perhaps purposely designed- for a short sit, not an enjoyable lengthy dinner.  \nSo, I suppose they are saving money on getting you to request bread instead of automatically serving you with bread. But I found it odd that they took away the appetizer dishes and left you with no bread plate. It's hard to eat bread without making crumbs.\nThe waitress was nice and friendly- maybe a little too friendly with her touching peoples' backs and shoulders to get their attentions, I had no problem with it, but I could see how others might find it uncomfortable.\n Bottom line is- the pasta was quite good. It was a nice ambiance (crowded, bustling, loud) but with all the excellent food choices in the mission, I'd only go here again if I had reservations (I don't like waiting an hour and half for food.)", "author": "Naomi K."}

The food quantity is way too small and the ingredient list reads like a poem where the poet wants to show off his vocabulary. Regardless whether they want to re-create French or Italian dining experiences, they seem to have only get the showy part but not the true \"food\" part.

We waited for 45 mins for seats which is okay in the Mission. However as soon as we sit, the waitress was very cold to us. It took her 30 mins to bring us the bread we requested. When she put down a plate too hard on the table, the food arrangement on that plate was damaged but she did not bother to apologize. And every time it took us like 15 mins waving at her to get her to come talk to us.

It was lightly salted, fresh, not too acidic or bland, and the fresh cheese was AMAZING. I ordered a very tasty pasta dish with pork and capers... yet I couldn't help feeling like it was on par with pasta I've made at home (for much cheaper, might I add). I get it though - the price tag to do with the ambiance in addition to the fact that ALL of their ingredients are fresh daily - so, there's that, yes. I enjoyed my wine, my friends and boyfriend enjoyed their pizzas, and having free sparkling water to drink is always a plus for me. Good lighting, great music, interesting art on the back wall, and I heard the bathroom was a sight to behold.\n\nWhat I WASN'T impressed with was how long the host ignored us when we first arrived - we stood at the booth for three minutes awkwardly waiting to be addressed. Yes, they were busy, but a simple, \"Hello, I'll be right with you,\" takes all but two seconds and always suffices to appease in that situation. Also, the waiter was nice enough, yet he judgmentally smirked when we couldn't pronounce some of the entrees. When I asked for a wine recommendation, he said, \"Well, just go with what you like.\" Dude, I don't know what I like - that's why I am asking you. Derp.\n\nSo, would I come back here? Absolutely.

We then had the squid ink pasta with salmon sausages, sea beans and sea urchin; lots of great texture, and lovely ocean brininess. \n\nFor a side we chose the Brussels sprouts with lemon, chili and hazelnuts; my husband is adamantly opposed to Brussels sprouts, but pronounced them entirely edible; I could have been happy just with the sprouts, they were that good. Down the table someone was having the pig's heart raviolini with cocoa, figs and cippollini onions, and it looked fantastic. \n\nI can't say that I'm as enthused with the desserts; they were only \"good\" where everything else was kind of frankly mind blowing! I had some chocolatey pudding thing, with coffee cream and salt (of course! 21st century chocolate w/o salt is apparently just. not. done.)

Music was a bit loud, but contributed to a fun atmosphere over all. \n\nAttire was a mix, everything from t-shirts and jeans, to one stylin' young lady in heels and Grannie's fur stole. \n\nI'm giving it four stars only because reservations are hard to come by, and you have to line up outside starting at 5:00PM for the 5:30PM opening.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-03-30", "description": "Flour + Water is truly an amazing restaurant, but there is definitely a strategy to getting the most out of your meal.\n\nFirst of all, you should know it's likely to be at least an hour wait if you want to eat around what most people consider dinner time (possibly longer).  So plan to put your name down and then go for a walk for a while.  If you come back a bit early, you can always sit outside and sip on a glass of wine.  If you don't want to wait, reservations can be hard to get but are definitely attainable a couple weeks in advanced if you don't mind eating late (around 10pm).  Another great way to get a seat without a reservation is to just show up on a rainy day.\n\nNow onto the food.\n\nTheir pastas are by far their most delicious items and the best pasta I've ever had. They aren't actually very expensive for a dinner (at less than $20 for most if not all), but they come in small portions.  For some people, this can be a relief from the usual giant portions, but for those who have bigger appetites make sure to order an appetizer if you go the pasta route.  If you don't want to spend as much, you can also ask them to bring you a side of quality bread with dipping oil (on the house).\n\nIf you are more concerned with the quantity of food, I suggest ordering pizza.  While the same price as the pastas (or much less for the basic margherita) they are more filling and still very delicious.  I especially recommend the salsiccia, but we all have our own taste.\n\nFinally, make sure you save room for desert because the citrus bonet is amazing.\n\nOh, and they have a very good wine list if you have the money to spare.", "author": "Ethan B."}

Had no problems getting seated.\n\nWe ordered a glass of wine each, the salumi pizza, and pork belly pasta. The food was all solid and tasty (pizza was a wee bit burned but was good). Pizza's thin crust was fab. The pasta was also very tasty, but was pretty insubstantial on quantity (counted 10 or 11 ravioli style lengths of pasta).\n\nTotal bill was around $60 if I recall correctly. So yes, we enjoyed the food, but I didn't walk out dying to come back. I wanted to try the bone marrow pizza, but they no longer serve it. (Bummer but that doesn't affect my score.) The service was very good and I got a laugh out of hearing that my request for the house wine could not be fulfilled because Flour+Water find that house wines are more \"economically focused.\" (I didn't laugh while our waitress was there, but found it fairly humourous.)

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-11-21", "description": "I was very excited to try this place because my friend from L.A., Jenny C., loved this place and we pretty much have the same taste and opinion in food.  So when my guy wanted to come here for his birthday, I was more than happy to take him.  Not that I wouldn't have been happy if it was another place but you get how eager I was about F+W.\n\nI tried to make resies the week of but they were unavailable for another 2 weeks.  So on the day of (it was a Friday), I went to F+W an hour before we expected to have dinner to put my name down while waiting for the birthday boy to get up to SF.  So when we arrived, we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a spot at the communal table.  But we changed our minds as soon as we sat down and decided to wait for an actual table.  It's just awkward to have to sit next to each other rather than across from each other.  It didn't help that the stranger across from me was carrying an infant.  I'm not a baby hater but I feel there are certain places that parents should not bring their toddlers to.\n\nWe had to wait another half an hour for a table but we finally got one.  The seating in most restaurants in SF are tight and cramped and this was no exception.  But the lighting is romantic and the ambiance is trendy.  \n\nWe ordered:\n\nPork terrine:  I liked this dish initially.  It's almost as soft as pate.  But it reminded me of the meat in vietnamese banh mi sandwiches and as soon as I realized that, the dish became less spectacular.  \n\nCavatelli with pork belly, spigarello, chili & black pepper cured egg yolk:  I really liked the flavor of this dish.  I was surprised though that it was a bit sour - reminding me of a thai dish.  Though the bits of pork belly were very tiny, they were enough to give the dish a good flavor.  However, I was surprised by how small the portion was.  I don't need a lot of food but the size of the dish was ridiculous.\n\nCappellacci dei briganti (with rabbit polpettine, lobster mushroom & kale):  I loved this dish.  So did the bday boy.  The rabbit meatballs were flavorful and tender.  But again, the portion was small.\n\nPizza:  We ordered some kind of sausage pizza with anchovies on top.  Not impressed.  Which is probably why I can't remember what kind of pizza it was.  The pizza was dry and underwhelming.  I have no idea why F+W is known for their pizza when their pasta is so much better.\n\nMy experience with F+W declined substantially when the table to my right started talking to the table on my left.  Picture the scenario:  loud obnoxious L.A. (I only know because I heard her entire convo) girl bumping me and shouting into my left ear to talk to the girl at the next table.  \"Ohmigosh!  I follow your Twitter all the time!\"  Though she apologized for constantly bumping into me, she continued to yell into my left ear for another 5-10 minutes.  The girl was at my diagonal left so I don't understand why she couldn't just go to the other side to speak more quietly to her Twitter idol.  This is totally not F+W's fault but seriously people?!\n\nBut what F+W did fail on is that I told them it was my date's birthday.  You know how most restaurants do something like give you a slice of cheap cake with a candle?  Well apparently, F+W is too good to do that!  I didn't know I had to order dessert.  If I had known, I would have.  Instead, I waited there stupidly wondering when the embarrassment was going to rain on the birthday boy.  Fail.  :'(\n\nOverall:  Service was good but food could've been better and bigger.  Don't come hungry unless you plan on ordering a sh**load of dishes.", "author": "Linh V."}

The ambiance was dark and cozy. The bartender was friendly and took our wine order. We decided on a bottle of barbera. As we were waiting on our first course, we noticed our neighbors second and main courses and they were tiny! No exaggerations!!!! I wish I took a picture of it. The pre fixed menu was $95 per person and they were providing SHARED courses that were so small!

Not to mention it's within walking distance from my apartment so no excuses there! My roomie and I endured a painless 30 min wait on a Sun night around 6:30pm a few weeks ago. Best idea to go in pairs or else the wait might take well over 2 hrs. We couldn't make reservations either since it was booked for several weeks out on Open Table. Talk about a popular joint!\n\nIt had a cute, romantic ambiance set by the candle light but also a rustic quality with all the natural wooden furniture. We ended up sitting at the bar area where I got an awesome view of the action in the kitchen! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qs7FgJ-UXgpbAMass0Oojg?select=UtFT0fITqkpp5COMhok_Dw) It just made the whole experience that much better. Our waitress/bartender wasn't the most attentive but was sweet and our food came out really quickly to my delight and surprise. A $6 glass of rose wine was a great choice for the meal...light with a hint of sweetness. The affordable price helped too!\n\nWhile waiting for our food, we munched on some slices of fresh-baked country style bread with a firm/crispy exterior and a soft middle. It was paired perfectly with some olive oil. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qs7FgJ-UXgpbAMass0Oojg?select=0qRkz_wDVFJ5m8_ElqPk7Q) This is the way I like to eat bread! Yum! Luckily our entrees came out shortly after we finished off the bread and we didn't have to ask for more. =P\n\nWhat we indulged in:\n\nsarda pizza ($15) - Padrone & gypsy peppers with tomato, capers & pecorino (we requested no cheese since my roomie is lactose intolerant and they were accommodating).  It was mouth-wateringly  delicious!! The dough was slightly salty with a thin crust but was still sturdy enough to be held up without falling apart. The peppers had a bit of heat to them which was great but they could have used less capers. Let's just say it was gone in no time and we wanted more! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qs7FgJ-UXgpbAMass0Oojg?select=muUxhnqDIN4uwJMUhuF4zg)\n\npappardelle with braised pork shoulder and rabe leaves ($17) - I've never had this type of wide, flat pasta before but it was really light so I enjoyed it thoroughly. The pork was so tender that it just fell apart in my mouth and was full of wonderful flavors. It wasn't too saucy but didn't feel dry either which made for a perfect combo! The sauce was so tasty that we couldn't help but dip our pizza crusts in it. haha (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qs7FgJ-UXgpbAMass0Oojg?select=RUVyBgKnkbQEnMIE-SBaeQ)\n\nIt didn't seem like a ton of food but we were both happily stuffed after that meal.

I got a reservation for 8:45, showed up boyfriend in tow, and was ready for some pizza and a lovely evening. I'd read the rave reviews and recommendations, and I was pumped!\n\nI got there just before 8:45. I was told the table wasn't ready, but that the people there were just getting their dessert. Then, the seating hostess \"whispers\" to the girl next to her that these people hadn't even ordered dessert yet. Not off to a great start. After 20 minutes, she kept pushing me to order wine while I waited, but she offered no apology or explanation for what was taking so long. What's the point of making a reservation if you still have to wait 20 min?\n\nWe finally got seated, and since we'd been staring at a menu as we waited, we told the hostess we were ready to order. She assured us a waiter would be right over. Not surprisingly, he wasn't. When he finally showed up, we placed an order for wine, a margherita pizza, and a salsiccia pizza. Wine came 10 minutes later (why is it so hard to get a glass of wine?!), and we saw our first pizza come out of the kitchen and sit under a heat lamp as they waited for the other one to be ready. 10 min later they brought it over to our table and explained the other one wasn't ready yet, and the other one didn't come out for another 20 minutes. (This time is all adding up. What a long, painful dinner! No wonder our table wasn't ready on time.)\n\nThe only good thing I can say is that dessert was delicious. The chocolate budino was truly delicious. It wasn't enough to make up for the rest of the dinner, but it sure was good.\n\nThe service is forgivable if you're in a hole in the wall restaurant or some place that is understaffed for the number of tables. But for a place that charges over $90 for two glasses of wine, two pizzas, and a dessert, it's completely unforgivable. If your standard for good food is price, this place is great. But if you actually want good food and a relaxing evening, this is not the place for you. It was really loud, pretty dark, and the food was less than mediocre. Additionally, the waiter got pretty snarky after realizing my boyfriend (who grew up speaking Italian) spoke better Italian than he did. We really have to be so childish?

I highly recommend the asparagus pasta, the hen pastas, and any of the pizzas.  The squid pasta was VERY fishy, but if you like that kind of thing, well, it's right up your alley.\n\nI think what prevents me from giving it 5 stars - (1) just the difficulty to get a reservation (since I live in the east bay, I can think of other equally tasty Italian restaurants like Delfina, A16, Pizzaiolo, etc. that are easier to eat at), and (2) the slightly elevated prices for appetizers.

The closest reservation was 2 months away on a Monday at 9:15pm.  I booked it anyways because the reservation happened to land on my birthday, which I thought was fortuitous.   As I made my commentary about Flour and Water I have to give full disclosure that by the time I went to dinner I was definitely buzzed from my earlier happy birthday happy hour shindig.  Therefore my taste buds might have been a little off or I was too buzzed to remember how the food was.  Maybe it was too hyped up from what people have said and/or I had these grand expectations of this place.  It was good, not great...I don't think it deserves 4 stars, but neither do I think it deserves 3.  I think it is a solid 3.75. \n\nMy friends and I ordered the following: pasta tagliatelle, pizza margherita, and the roast of lamb.  Ironically the most \"non-Italiany\" thing, the roast of lamb, was the most delicious.  I would give the lamb alone a 4/5.  The pasta was definitely good, but I have had better.  The pizza was yummy and was my \"favorite\" Italian dish there.  However, I still think that Tony's in North Beach has the best margherita pizza I have ever tasted.  For desert we ordered the chocolate badino with sea salt or something.  It was good\n\nAmbiance/Service:  The ambiance was great.  The service was phenomenal overall - from the hostess to the chef.

The best thing that can happen at a restaurant, is that you DON'T KNOW what to order, because it all sounds so amazing... this will happen to you at Flour + Water...

We also ordered a side of asparagus w/ breadcrumbs/lemon zest. \n\nThe salad came out --- we devoured it. It was just SO_PERFECTLY dressed (not in the designer suit kinda way...) tossed with just the right amount of an amazingly balanced vinaigrette. The greens still had a vibrance and life to them, rather then wilting under a heavy oil slick/dressing.\n\nOur pastas came out. Both amazing! The pork/spring onion agnolotti totally took the win on this one though!\n\nSadly, the asparagus never made it out --- I chalk this up to possibly not speaking loudly enough (what can I say, I have a soft voice ;-) ) We weren't charged for it either. \n\nThe reason this place did NOT get 5 stars...

They do reserve half of the restaurant for walk-ins.  If you want to do this I recommend showing up at 4:45 to get a table.  We ended up waiting about an hour and a half for our table.  We just went on a walk and grabbed a drink at another restaurant to pass the time.\n\nOnce seated we were in awe of the trendy and warm decor.  The entire staff was welcoming and attentive.  We had a bottle of wine and did the winter tasting menu.\n\nIt changes quite frequently, but the stars were the braised duck pasta and the beet pasta was an unexpected star in the meal.  \n\nPortions for the tasting menu was perfect and the flavors were so complex and purely delicious.

It's not easy to make reservation for weekend meals unless you book way ahead of time. We decided to go on one week night, it was relatively easy to make the reservation. \n\nThe place was smaller than I thought. The ambience was rustic and a bit dark. The space wasn't cramped, but certainly not spacious. \n\nThey had a pasta tasting menu that night, which included 8 different kinds of pasta. We knew they're specialized in pizza and pasta. It was tempting, but we thought it might be too challenging to try that. \n\nWe decided to ordered three pasta and one appetizer. The appetizer (swordfish salad) was not impressive at all. And the waitress (a tall blonde girl) was a bit cold. Things were about to go downhill from there... Until the pastas arrived. \n\nAll of pasta we ordered were really good including the braised pork, the clams and mussels, as well as the quail ones. Also, midway into our service, our waitress disappeared, another girl (Jesse) took over and she was much warmer and helpful. We told her we would like the last dish to come sooner, as we had to show to go to after dinner. The last pasta arrived in no time. We appreciated their effort. \n\nWould like to try their pasta again and maybe pizza next time, hopefully served by Jesse instead of the other girl.", "author": "Kai Y."}

If this place was in NYC or NJ.. it would do ok. Not many people would go back just due to all the choices we have. But for SF I was very very impressed! IMO... Too expensive for Italian though.  Wine selection is iffy at best... needs to have more options.  GETS VERY PACKED In there by like 6pm.  Not my ideal atmosphere for Fine Italian Dining.

We ordered the funghi pizza to try which was topped with a couple varieties of mushrooms and sage cream (what got us all hooked on this pizza). Luckily we decided to order a pizza to share, because when our individual pasta dishes came out, the portions were on the small side. \n\nThe two pasta dishes that we ordered that made an impression on me was the squid ink pasta and the cocoa pasta with braised pork pieces. This was my first time trying squid ink pasta and even though it has this fishy taste to it, I really liked it! Thanks to Flour + water for making my first time trying squid ink pasta an enjoyable one. The cocoa pasta was definitely unique since I haven't ever seen it on a menu before - the faint hint of the chocolate flavor paired well with the pork sauce that accompanied it.\n\nAfter finishing the pizza and all the pasta, we were so full we couldn't even try the dessert.

The reviews over-hyped Flour + Water for me... and I went in with great hunger pains. \n\nMike L. and I arrived around 730pm on a Monday night and found the place packed. The hostess took down our names and told us it would be about a 30-40 minutes wait. In the mean time, we ordered each a glass of wine while waiting patiently for our table. \n\nAfter 30-40 minutes we were seated at the bar, which wasn't too bad, and we had a nice side view of the kitchen facing the brick oven. \n\nThe Antipasti: \n-Melon salad with grapes, pickled shallots & olive sea salt \n\nA really refreshing and beautiful dish. I love how it combines the three flavors of sweet, tangy and savory all into one dish. Would have been great to snack on in between the entrees to soften the palate. \n\nThe Entrees: \n-Salsiccia pizza: tomato, sausage, gaeta olives, smoked mozzarella & chili \n-Farfalle with braised pork and pesto \n\nThe crust of the pizza was thin but it wasn't crispy at all. The sauce on the pizza has absorbed into the dough which made the pizza soggy. The flavors weren't vibrant enough to give me the wow factor. There were hardly any sausages or olives on the pizza and it definitely lacked cheese. The only taste I can remember is the oven baked salty dough and tomato sauce. \n\nThe pasta was over cooked and the pesto sauce was also light to taste. None of the flavors of the ingredients infused with each other. While eating the braised pork, I could tell that the pork was probably cooked separately first before being tossed into the pasta dish to finish the presentation. Bland. \n\nThe Dessert: \n-Chocolate budino with espresso caramel cream and sea salt \n\nSad but true, the dessert was the best dish we had for the evening. I love the rich and creamy taste of the chocolate, and the hit of the sea salt which quickly alleviates the heaviness of the dessert. \n\nIn conclusions: Overrated!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-12", "description": "Once we got a table, the food was great.\n\nI say 'once we got a table' because they quoted us an hour wait. We went around the block and had cocktails at Asiento and returned. Ultimately, we waited three hours. Why did we wait? Because I was in SFO from DC and I wanted my flour + water experience. Because I knew (from going to Toki Underground in DC) that we would wait that long no matter when we went. Because Lesly S. said she had (on a previous occasion) made a reservation and still had to wait an extra ninety minutes. Because by then, I was too 'starving stupid' and stuck in the Mission (where people get randomly beaten up according to Lesly S.) to do anything else.\n\nNow I'm no dipshit, Venu (Venu N.'s Toki Underground Review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/toki-underground-washington#hrid:Ie59_AVlznUhlz1cB9bOhQ). I am all too familiar with the \"put your name on the list and give us your cell phone number; go around the corner and patronize neighborhood bars and we'll call you when we have space for you\" bit. I've been there done that bought the tee-shirt and know the deal. I do it at Toki. I do it at a myriad of 'made popular by some TV chef' restaurants up and down the East Coast.  But when you quote me an hour and I return in ~an hour and I stand there and see all of the cute little SFO 'magazine trendy' or hipster kids (who arrived after I did) being seated before me, I kind of have a problem with that. A huge part of me thinks we would still be sitting on that bench out front if I hadn't stood inside the doorway looking like \" Iron Eyes Cody\" for the last 15 minutes of our wait. Dam.\n\nThe food was good. We had a little bit of everything. Bread. Sage Smoked Duck. Shelling Beans & Marinated Artichokes. Radiatore & Hen. Angolotti & corn. Eggplant & turnips. Bread (oh, oh, oh the bread) & olive oil. Wine. Pizza. Black Cod. And she was pleased. \n\nWas it worth the wait? I'm still on the fence about that. It's over with now. I've had the experience. I've supped at the table. It was good. And I cannot get those three hours back ever. Would I do it again? I don't know. I've been to Toki with massive waits multiple times. But I live in DC and have had face-time with the chef and if I need to eat quickly, I can go to any of seventeen other places within a stone's throw and eat well. In SFO where there are approximately a jillion and a half superfantastic restaurants I'm sure I could do that, too. But not in the randomly-beating-people-up Mission neighborhood.\n\nFlour + Water tweeted that they love me & Lesly S. But they have 965 reviews.

Lamby all the way though.  I've read reviews by idiots who criticize Flour and Water for their lack of sauce.  I don't know what the hell that means.  If you want Prego or Ragu then don't bother coming here.  The sauce was rich and sweet with a really intense lamby flavor.  Yes the portion was a little small, but you pay for quality.  Ask your server and they will guide you.  Sidrah told us how much we needed to order.\n\nCampanelle with tesa, pea leaves. cured egg and breadcrumbs- super good!  smoky, creamy, and sweet all at the same time.  The texture from the breadcrumbs totally made this dish.  The freshness of the peas really brightened up the whole thing.  I know they smoke the tesa on their roof and you can really feel the craftsmanship and care in this plate of pasta.\n\nCappellacci dei Briganti with rabbit sausage, asparagus, and green garlic-  the winner of the night.  EVERYONE at the table was blown away by how good this was.  Some were skiddish of rabbit but with one bite were immediately converted.  I could go on forever about how good this was.  Just order it if they have it...or any rabbit for that matter.  You won't be disappointed.\n\nAll in all...Fantastic food.  Fantastic service.  The decor is phenomenal.

Nothing bugs me more than when a restaurant refuses to do any kind of substitution on their tasting menus. We had originally intended on doing the tasting menu ($60 pp) but after seeing that the appetizer was a lamb sweatbread dish that neither one of us wanted to eat and they weren't willing to make any type of substitution, we just had to pass and decided to order individual plates from the menu which ended up working in our favor cause it saved us like $45 (after tax and tip). Also, if you aren't a wine drinker there really isn't anything to drink besides water, tea (I  don't like iced tea) and either orange/lime san pellegrino sodas. I understand that they want to stay local and all natural but they should at least have some vintage sodas available for purchase or they can make their own like a lot of other places do.\n\n Dishes are a bit on the small side so you really need to order about 2 pp which is fine because you get to try more. This is what we had:\n\n-Agnolotti dal plin ($16). It was pretty good although there was this weird taste that I can't put my finger on but the bf didn't seem to notice.\n\n-Robiola scarpinocc with shaved porcini ($17). So delicious!\n\n-Saffron chittara with braised monterey squid & cured farm egg ($16). Not good.

Reminds me a lot of a pizza that I had at Orson's a while back,\n\n-Chocolate budino with espresso caramel cream & sea salt ($8). It was good but I honestly didn't like the sea salt. I would order it again but I would ask them to skip the sea salt since they just sprinkle it on top.\n\n-Olive oil & thyme cake with apple, fromage blanc & saba ($8). Yum!\n\nService was great.

The heirloom tomatoes were probably the best of the bunch, but nothing special.\n\nBut forget the starters! I was here to feed my fat ass some pizza! We each ordered 1 pizza each and would share. My wife went with the Margherita, me the Pomodoro and our third went with \"white pizza\" which name escapes me, but basically it was topped with cheese, veggies and a spicy chili. The best of the bunch was clearly the Margherita. The sauce was tangy and flavorful with enough basil to keep things interesting. The pomodoro had huge chunks of fresh tomato which was the our second place. The veggie had mixed reviews, my wife loved it but my friend and I thought it was \"ok\". \n\nThe service was very good and super attentive. Our server checked in often and made sure that we were taken care of. She was also very knowledgeable of the very Italian wine list.\n\nOverall the pizza was excellent, but debatable if it's actually the best thin crust in the City. A 16, Delfina may still be better.I also thought the pizza was bit \"soupy\" and made the crust watery in the middle. I was also very disappointed that none of the pizzas on the menu had any kind of a meat option.\n\nThe pasta dishes looked very good and will definitely come back to check out for myself.\n\nTake that Medical Technician!\n\n3 1/2 stars", "author": "Rene C."}

Four of us decided to have the 7 course tasting menu, and it was very good. But the restaurant seems to have no idea that a tasting menu takes time to eat. The last few courses were piled on at top speed--one coming before the previous one was done. As soon as the dessert plates were whisked away, the bill was on the table with a, \"no rush on this\" that was contradicted by the gesture itself. We weren't asked if we wanted coffee (we did--although we skipped as a result). We lingered to chat for just a few minutes as the anxious staff hovered, signaling to us repeatedly that it was time to go. (For the record, we were there for barely over two hours, which is not that much time, including reading the menu and ordering, for a 7 course tasting menu!)\nThe wait staff was very nice--although when we asked for a wine recommendation in the $50 range and the waitress suggested a $70 bottle as \"the perfect choice for what we wanted,\" it was a bit annoying. And the 4.5% charge for the health care ordinance is steep. The restaurant could do better on both counts.\nIn my opinion, the difference between a good meal and a great dining experience is not the food, but the whole feeling. Flour and Water will give you a very good meal. And if you're a fast eater, or if you are fully able to ignore the \"please leave now\" signals without feeling slightly stressed by them, then this is the place for you.\nA good meal is the kind of thing you're really glad you had. A great dining experience is what makes you come back. Unfortunately, Flour and Water came up short.", "author": "Melissa R."}

Dinner until midnight daily isn't really that late for an ex-NYer, but it sure pushes the limits for this sleepy city.  A limited menu of meats, pastas and pizzas allows this establishment to focus on culinary perfection that helps push their well-paired wines. \n\nSalumi della Casa: Such a diverse plate and so impressive since it was all made in house fulfilling their goal of using the entirety of the animals they butcher.  The p\u00e2t\u00e9 was moist and creamy, a lot more enjoyable than those hard blocks you get on standard charcuterie plates.  The lardo was sliced extremely thin for just a light tingle of fatty goodness.  The mortadella was among some of the best I've ever had with the fat cubes melting away like the lardo.  The duck prosciutto had a very potent raw taste to it.  The beef tongue was shockingly tender for tongue while the mustard salad beneath was decent though unnecessary.  The gnocco fritto was disappointing as a headliner because there was only one deep fried small pasta pocket which we had to begrudgingly share.\n\nDuck Prosciutto: Thicker cuts of duck prosciutto than the salumi platter that are cooked to be more like a duck ham.  I felt cooking made the duck prosciutto less complex while the sunny side fried egg made this dish seem more appropriate as a brunch item.  Definitely pales in comparison to other appetizer options.\n\nFegato Pizza: Why get a boring margherita when you can get giblets and liver?  The prosciutto braised chard added more chewy texture than simple spinach, though it was hard to distinguish the prosciutto... perhaps add more pronounced bits next time?  The liver added a good fatty tinge and was nice in small pieces, but large chunks were a bit overwhelming.  The giblets were rubbery (in a good way like squid) and full of marinated flavor.  Barely noticed the effect of the shallots and savory with all the stronger divas dominating this pie.  And of course, the blistering dough cooked in 900\u00b0F ovens was spot on!\n\nChocolate Budino: I'm always hesitant to order chocolate pudding at restaurants because it feels like a cop out -- a simple dish to prepare that even a simple a palate can enjoy.  This budino schooled me!  The layer of espresso pudding on top of the dark chocolate was brilliant.  Such bitterness to contrast the sweet chocolate.  The large salt crystals helped add another flavor and texture dimension that made me appreciate the calming sweetness of the chocolate base even more so.  The caramel cream was alright, though nothing note worthy.\n\nPumpkin Cake: Loved the little crystallized ginger hiding in the cake, a perfect idea for future carrot/pumpkin/spiced cakes.  The brown butter ice cream didn't taste that buttery, just kind of like sugar ice cream.  There was some pumpkin seed crisp on top that was too thick for my liking and not heavy enough on the seeds.

It was the albacore tuna dish. We ordered one for the table, it cost 30 dollars, and it was VERY over cooked.  When I say very over cooked I mean my boyfriend had to use a knife to cut through it, which should never ever ever be necessary with fish, and I couldn't eat it.  \nWhen we told our waitress about it she said \"oh I'm sorry to hear that.\"  We weren't offered anything else, and it was not removed from our bill. \nWe washed it down with the infant fist sized panna cotta and an espresso. \n\nLet me be clear, I was never expecting family sized portions. I don't mind spending good money on good food, but I do mind spending money on bad food. There is a world of a difference between \"fine dining\" and straight up robbery. \n\nIn conclusion, this meal cost over 200 dollars for a salad, two pizzas, a bottle of wine, and the worst piece of fish I have ever been served.

I've had it twice now and it keeps getting better. Last week, I had a pheasant pasta in broth which was almost as amazing. Again, wonderful texture and a great balance of flavors.

The margherita-with tomato, basil, fior di latte, and extra virgin olive oil-was just so so. The verzada-prosciutto braised savoy cabbage, taleggio & red onions with the addition of a farm egg- was absolutely delicious. I especially loved the cheese. But in both cases (making allowances for the egg) the pizza was soggy in the middle and lacking in the crispiness I associate with thin crust pies. My second visit didn't change that impression. I hoped the pizza thing was a fluke (see why below). \n\nThey get an entire star because of the hostess. I missed my own birthday dinner by almost and hour (after leaving 1/2 early) because of amazingly horrific traffic. Some of my guests were equally delayed. After calling to let them know we'd be late and calling again to beg to keep my table, they assured me they would hold it. As hot as this place seems to be (and it was PACKED), that in itself was a miracle deserving of a star.\n\nUnfortunately I had to take that star back, because our service on my birthday was really rushed. We were definitely late, but ordered in a timely fashion and were moving along fairly well on our own. We actually finished almost 30 minutes ahead of when they said we would need to. We definitely had time for dessert, but didn't feel like having it there when it was obvious they wanted us out. Kind of a mixed message considering they could have just opted not to save the table.\n\nA small quibble (for me, the omnivore, not so for some of my friends), this place isn't that vegetarian friendly. with all the wonderful things available to us in this state, one would hope that will change.

If only I were a cow, I would have four stomachs and could eat the pizza, pasta, entree and dessert!  \n\nOrder everything they have that is made with flour and water.   They definitely know what they are doing with these two ingredients.  For starters their bread is really good, dense and chewy, with a crisp crust.  \n\nWe started off with the carbonara pizza, which came with bacon, mushrooms, pea tendrils and an egg emulsion.  Hands down this is the BEST pizza in SF, at least made in the neopolitan style.  The crust was flavorful, thin, crisp and chewy with a few bits charred from the super hot oven.  From the first piece to the last, the crust stayed crisp, even in the center.  The toppings were generous but no one ingredient overwhelmed the dish.  I think any of the pizzas would be really good; the crust is the star.\n\nFor our entrees, my friend ordered the yellowtail and shrimp salad and I ordered the seared bass.  Yup, we both finished our dishes...licked the plates clean.  The fish was cooked perfectly  - moist and well seasoned.  The portion size was perfect for me, but some sort of starter is needed with the entree.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the chocolate budino with espresso caramel cream and sea salt and the mint panna cotta with fruit sauce and biscotti.  The chocolate dish was rich and decadent, but didn't feel heavy.  If you are a chocoholic this is a must-order.  The panna cotta was light and refreshing and was a perfect for those that love fruity desserts.\n\nWe lucked out and did not have to wait for a table at 5:45 pm on a Sunday.  Soon after we arrived, all the seats were filled - communal table, bar and regular tables.  There was a line outside but it didn't seem to be that long.  \n\nThe service was excellent.

Artisanal breads (on request): check.  Fresh, unique ingredients (a few of which requiring consultation with a glossary) on a printed-daily menu: check.  Industrial/modern decor with open kitchen: check.  No wonder we felt like a couple of foodie cool kids as we slid past the burgeoning crowd early on a Friday night.\n\nNearly everything on the menu sparked curiosity and longing.  As we nibbled on the fantastic bread, we negotiated over divine-sounding homemade pastas and contemplated a range of tantalizing pizza toppings.  We ended in a toss-up and enlisted our server, who recommended the \"farro paccheri\" with whey-braised pork, Meyer lemon and sage.    This exquisite concoction of rustic Italian comfort food confirmed both my love of farro in all forms (here, ground and formed into fresh pasta) and my undying appreciation of the magic of Meyer lemons.\n\nWe started our meal with roasted cauliflower with almonds, preserved lemon and sweet herbs.  Very intriguing concept, but a smidgeon too heavy on the potent preserved lemon, throwing off the taste and obscuring the subtle sweetness of the roasted cauliflower.   We kept our pizza course simple, choosing the classic margherita, a solid but unremarkable rendition that covered the basic notes of sweet tomato sauce, creamy fior di latte and a slightly charred crust.  As a side dish, we sampled a fine winter vegetable creation:  sauteed turnips and greens, a pleasant combination that was also slightly over-infused with lemon. \n\nThe staff at Flour + Water were very good-natured and upbeat, save for our waiter, who seemed aloof and rushed throughout the evening.

We couldn't get a reservation, as they were booked out seemingly months in advance. So we got there early (5:45), put our name in, and waited over TWO HOURS for a table. I'm thinking, \"Two hours---let's hope the food is worth it.\"\n\nLet me start with the environment: trendy, reclaimed wood and bare-bulb decor. It's lovely, but cookie-cutter. It seems like every new bar and restaurant in this town is subscribing to the same interior design rule book.\n\nNoise level: utterly out of control. They should have put a little less thought into the light bulbs and more into the acoustics. It's nearly impossible to have anything resembling a conversation! I don't enjoy screaming over my meal---certainly not at this price point.\n\nWine list: insulting. Really? Your average bottle of wine costs almost $70? This is California. We grow grapes and make unbelievable wine here. You mean to tell me you can't come up with some amazing bottles for less than $40? And I don't mean one or two bottles in a list of almost 40. Oh, and most of the wine isn't even from this country. If you're going for \"local, sustainable,\" blah blah blah, how 'bout accounting for the fact that most of your wine list gets shipped from Europe? I have to say, that wine list really pissed me off. \n\nFood: if you want amazing food served in reasonable portions that are proportionate to the quality of the ingredients and the price you're paying, go to Pizzaiolo in Oakland. Their food is amazing and you get the perfect amount for the price. Flour + Water, on the other hand, needs to beef up the portions if they're going to charge what they charge. I know SF rents are high, but I got the feeling that I was paying to furnish someone's penthouse, not to cover the cost of running the business. The food was good, don't get me wrong. But certainly not worth the two+ hour wait. And I don't even remember what we ordered, to tell the truth. So much for making an impression.\n\nStaff: mostly helpful, but our server gave us still water when I asked for sparkling.

Our friends made the reservation and the first opening they had for a table for four was over a month!\n\nSo, we were looking forward to a place with that much of a dedicated clientele.  Plus, their reviews were very glowing.\n\nUnfortunately, for us, it turned out to be anticlimactic!  I started with Crispy Pork Trotter (de-boned pigs feet) with ale, parsley root, pine nut, currant & watercress.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't worth $11 for such a small portion of it.  Also, I had just had a similar dish on a trip to Williamsburg, VA., just a few weeks ago at a French Bistro and it was much more interesting and tasty.\n\nI like rabbit and it is becoming more popular on menus in the SF Bay Area.  But, rabbit is a bit chancy as not all chefs know how to work with it.  This one, Rabbit Loin with Rutabaga, Persimmon, Cipollini & Chestnut Brown Butter, was very good.  The small nuggets of rabbit were moist, tender and flavorful.  Great.  But, for $24, there wasn't a whole lot there.  \n\nMy wife had the Beet Salad (a big fancy descriptive name) and \nRosemary Tagliarini with Roasted Hen, Nettles & Chanterelles.  She liked what she had and for her, the portions were fine.  The other couple had a vegetarian pizza and another pasta dish.  They said the pizza was too salty but the crust was sufficiently thin with good crispy texture.  The other pasta was good, but, again, very small in serving size.\n\nWe shared a single dessert and that turned out to be a joke.  It was a custard/creme item with fresh berry compote but it was so small that about 1 teaspoon per person for the four of us and it was totally gone!  Yes, it was good BUT.........\n\nAnd, it's crowded, noisy and the tables are placed really close together.  Lots of luck if you want to carry on a normal conversation with your dining partners!\n\nAnyway, it's a long ways to go for us (about 45 minute drive + bridge toll plus parking hassle) so it's not worth a repeat visit as there so many other good/better places closer to us for less money.\n\nJim", "author": "James Q."}

I enjoy both for about 3 bites before the dish cools down (if it was even hot to begin with...) and I can't stand to eat the rest.\n\nFlour + water gets 4 stars from me just for the simple fact that NONE of their 8 pasta dishes come in thick tomato or cream sauce, or even pesto. Each one has either some sort of butter-based or meat juice-based sauce. The one exception was the dish I chose to order - ham tortellini. The little boat-shaped pasta stuffed with cured ham floated about in a clear pork broth that was oh so flavorful without being salty. It was an absolute delight to eat! My friend got the cocoa strozzapreti with braised pork, which was the least appetizing bowl of pasta we've ever seen (brown squiggly noodles with light brown pork in dark brown sauce), though I know it's not their fault cocoa is brown. He enjoyed the dish, but I mildly disliked it.\n\nThe 5th star is for their desserts. We decided to try the Venetian dates cake with pistachio gelato because it sounded unique, and it just blew me away. The cake was lightly battered and fried, sort of like how bananas are fried for dessert, but some parts were sweet (chunks of dates) while other parts were more neutral. Great balance with the not-overly sweet gelato! The second dessert (really, how could we get only 1?) was white chocolate panna cotta with huckleberries.

However, great food is great food and it does make me euphorically happy. I think I left Flour + Water with hearts in my eyes tonight. \n\nGot a last minute invite. Friend of a friend made a reservation for 6 about 2 months ago and needed to fill the spot. I only knew about the place because I passed by it a couple of times on the UCSF Shuttle. The name and the decor intrigued me enough to make a note of it to check it out at some point. Reservation was for 8:00.\n\nPlace was packed when I walked in. Plenty of people just standing around and waiting for tables. I heard that they save about half the tables for walk-ins. (It's a small place.)  However, at some point they stop taking walk-ins, and my understanding is that the walk-in wait can range from 1-3 hours. 3 hours?!?! The party standing next to me ordered a bottle of wine while they were waiting. They asked the hostess whether it was unusual for the people waiting to order an entire bottle. The hostess said no, it was actually quite common. \n\nSide story: I heard that Steve Jobs tried to do a walk-in at some point, and ended up leaving because he couldn't deal with the wait. If true, I love that they didn't kow-tow to Steve Jobs. Maybe they are PC-users? Hahaha. Maybe they were burned one too many times by Apple products. \n\nThey seated us fairly close to our reservation time, which has often not happened at other restaurants. Also, we were missing one of our party, but they let us sit down anyway. They weren't going to let us order anything until she got there though. Luckily she got there right as we sat down.\n\nThe menu was confusing. I know no Italian. The wine list was filled with unfamiliar names as well (except Nebbiolo and Sangiovese, I suppose). I asked the waitress for a rec, told her I usually like zin, and she recommended the Nero d'Avola. Excellent recommendation! I really liked the light sweetness of this wine-- it was very easy to drink. Small pour though, but that's okay. \n\nI ordered the tagliarini with duck, and the beets. Again, I didn't know what most of the words on the menu were. We speculated that the different names were just the various shapes of pasta. My friend had the garganelli with braised lamb, which I got to sample. All were excellent. I especially loved the beets. It went well with the tagliarini as I'm trying to incorporate more vegetables into my life.  I especially loved the citrus-ness and the arugula. My friend had a slight complaint about the portion size, but it was nice to actually have space for dessert rather than eat until I want to puke (my \"diet\" is to actually stop stuffing myself until I want to puke, so this worked out for me). \n\nFor dessert, I ordered the chocolate budino. OMG!!! It was amazing! It was described to me as like pot de creme, so I was sold from the outset. The espresso cream was so light and went so well with the heavy chocolate mousse-y stuff. And the sprinkling of sea salt... I'm so in love. \n\nPersonal bill came out to under $50 pre-gratuity, so not bad at all. I mean, I definitely can't do this on a weekly, or shouldn't do this on a monthly basis. But yes, the food was excellent. \n\nBonus praise: The menu notes that you have to ask for bread. We didn't end up asking for bread. I actually appreciate this because I know sometimes the bread just ends up untouched and wasted.  \n\nNit-picky stuff: Two other people in our party ended up ordering the same wine as me. So we probably should have just ordered a bottle. My friend thinks the waitress should have suggested we get a bottle instead.

Of course I brought my camera so I'll upload my photos that I took that night along with my review.  \n\nFirst of all, the decor!  Mostly everything is recycled from somewhere.  The bulbs in the lamps are from an old warehouse, the wood from the bar is from an old cask(s) pre-prohibition and the tables were purchased from Myst when they went out of business.  The bathrooms were done by Paxton Gate, and honestly, I'll leave that as a surprise for you to check out when you go there.  In the back is this cool-ass painting which kind of looks like fish and has lacquer over it which gives it a cool effect.  It's a very warm kind of rustic atmosphere.  It almost feels like you're not in SF but somewhere hundreds of miles away in a coastal town.\n\nMe and my friends sat down at a table at the back of the room and as other friends joined us they accommodated us as well.  Funny enough our table of 3 turned into a table of 7 because all of my neighbors and a friend from around the corner \"The famous ED M!\" came and hung out with us.\n\nWe started out with the shaved asparagus and arugula salad w/quail egg and pancetta-caper vinaigrette.  It was delicious.  I've never had quail eggs before (at least not cooked ones) and they are very flavorful.  The asparagus is cut real thin and compliments the arugula perfectly.\n\nWe all shared the chilled pea soup with pounded mint, and grissini.  This was also amazing.  I've never had anything like this before.  It was really light but had a little but of a creamy flavor to it.  This is a MUST try when you come here.  It tasted like spring to me.  See my pics for a view of this beauty.\n\nSomeone at the bar let me try little pieces of the house cured salumi.  It all was delicious.  See my pics for what it looks like.  I love that you can eat Salumi right across the street from Cafe Gratitude!  They said that they also slaughter the animals right here so they have to bring them in whole and the people at Gratitude I'm sure will be holding protest signs soon ;)\n\nWe split a 2 pasts dishes.  The first one the Triangoli of roasted artichoke, nettle and caramelized onion for $17.  This was amazing!  I've had amazing pasta in Italy and also in Quince.  I think this is also at the top of the ladder.  Cooked to perfection and so fresh.  \n\nWe also tried the Chittara with wild ramps, prosciutto and peppercress for $17.  This was also nice, cooked perfectly al dente and had a great sauce as well on it.\n\nWe shared the Margherita pizza with Tomato, basil, fior de tatte, extra virgin olive oil and we added bufala mozzarella for $2.  The pizza was good but I can't say it was as extraordinary as most of the other apps.\n\nI also tasted some other people's pizza, such as the Carciofi - artichoke, new onion, pocorino, capers and the Uovo - Fontina and farm egg with house pancetta, nepitella.  Both were very nice as well.  Wow, does this place make anything half ass?  I don't think so :)\n\nA friend of mine had the prosciutto which I want to get next time.  It looked delicious as well.\n\nOMG!  You have the try the deserts.  So the first one was the Chocolate budino with espresso-caramel cream and sea salt $7.  My friend I think had an Orgasm after eating this.  At least that what she said ;)  She liked it so much that she picked up the bowl and licked it.  You HAVE to try this.  The sea salt goes perfectly with the espresso-caramel cream.  I love sweet and salty things..\n\nThe 2nd desert was the cornmeal olive oil cake with honey-thyme ice cream for $7.  It was also really good and the ice cream is to die for.  Take it from me..  \n\nSo, yes, the service definitely needs a little help though, but I'm not rating it on that since it's so new.  At the bar they brought out a pizza while someone was still eating their appetizer and it went cold.  During our dinner, there were times that it was hard to get our waitress.  She just didn't seem on top of everything, such as coming by and asking \"How is everything, do you need anything, etc?\"  I think this will improve over time.  \n\nHonestly, if this place could stay the way it was tonight, I would go back every day, and by the end of the year, I'd be broke :)  I just hope it doesn't turn into a Mission Hipster type of place like Beretta where you have to wait 2 hours for a table.", "author": "Mitch A."}

I was so excited to try everything after hearing everyone rave about it. Overall, it is very good, but I don't think it's as hyped up as it should be, to be honest.\n\nBread is good. My table and I shared 3 pasta dishes and a pizza, plus 2 desserts (perfect size for party of 5 with average appetites).\n\nWe shared a rabbit pasta (rabbit sausage was excellent), as well as a duck and pork pasta. They were all fantastic, but a little too salty. Also, one thing that kind of stuck out was that each of the pastas tasted really similar (probably same sauce/base). They were great, but there just wasn't as much variance as I had hoped for. We also shared the margherita pizza, which really isn't much to write home about. Crust was badly burnt, it was too thin, and flavor didn't really pop. It was OK though.\n\nThe desserts more than made up for the pizza, though. Had the chocolate budino with espresso cream and sea salt (divine) and a peach and peach leaf panna cotta with blackberries. Both were delicious and were a perfect ending to a light dinner.\n\nOverall, I'd come back again, but I wouldn't wait in the line outside for hours.

I'm not saying that in a bad way, but it just happened to be the best composed dish, and looked beautiful when it came to the table. Would definitely come back for this dish, which consisted of 2 croquettes of pork trotter meat, some parsnip puree, fried kale and roasted parsnips. Delicious to the max.\n\nAfter that we got the pork ravioli and the pizza, both of which were well executed but not as memorable as the pork trotter. I will say this though, their dough is well made for the pizza, and the pasta was cooked perfectly!\n\nI recommend this place for sure, but as all the other reviews say, plan accordingly as reservations are tough to get during peak hours, and trying to walk in without one is a shot in the dark.\n\nPros: Good pasta, great execution, good ambiance.

In summary, Flour + Water is a solid 3.5 stars.  Food was good, not amazing.  The look and feel however was impressive but borderline to cool for school vibe.   \n\nWe ordered:\n**Calamaro Pizza \n-- Squid, tomato, taggiasca olives, green garlic aioli & wild arugula\nActually pretty tasty pizza.  \nI prefer Mozza in LA because the crust is more crunchy/chewy/soft (all the textures hit at mozza).  The crust here was more of a typical brick oven place and didn't have the crisp'ness I like.  The squid, olives, sauce, and arugula was perfect though.  I was surprised by the amount of squid, every bite had some.  The flavors really worked especially the arugula which rounded everything out.\n\n**Slow roasted boar raviolini with ragusano and horseradish.\n--I really enjoyed the subtle kick from the horseradish.  The texture was great and the sauce was lick off the plate good.  The boar provided a bit of game and contributed to a pretty solid dish.  \n\n**Savory garganelli with braised pork shoulder and green garlic.\n-- I wanted to like this dish more because I love pork shoulder.  Who doesn't?!?  But, I thought the pork was dry and rather bland.  I also didn't like how the pork was in small chunks scattered throughout.  It sort of had the look and feel of canned tuna without the tuna taste.  The pasta itself was perfect and the sauce was also good.  \n\nFlour + Water is a solid restaurant that simply does not live up to it's high expectations.

Everything was tasty (though some dishes were very salty) but not worth $60/person.  We (2 of us) could have ordered the albacore appetizer, any 5 of the pasta dishes offered and the panna cotta dessert a la carte off the dinner menu and spent less.

This reputation and buzz make this place one of the most regularly sought out reservations of all time. \n\nI need to qualify this review: we ordered the pasta tasting menu as a group and then ordered two pizzas to follow. This was not a pizza-only night which I think does factor into the review. I will say that that pasta was cooked perfectly for the tasting menu and was an interesting combination of flavors and textures--some of which were excellent and some of which didn't work. One dish was too peppery for most at the table (not me) while two of the dishes were too fishy. One person commented that the pasta's blended together too much and challenged the benefits of a largely pasta-only tasting menu.  \n\nThe pizzas were both wood-fired varieties--the margarita and  the white (no tomato sauce). IMHO, both were fine but not extraordinary. In both cases, the crust wasn't consistently chewy--in fact towards the center of both pies, the crust was soggy. This happens with all pizza joints, but shouldn't to earn the 4 or 5 star ratings of some of my favorites especially because flour is in their name.  The sauce and cheese on one and the cheese and toppings on the other were both excellent and well proportioned. \n\nOther cons: they are so popular that you can't sit until your full party shows up. The service was very spotty--we joked that the waitress went to the movies in between courses. And, pizza and pasta places that require months for a reservation bug me especially if everything is not perfect. Noisy to the point of distracting.\n\nOther pro's: the wine list was eclectic, fairly priced and interesting. \n\nSummary: I think I need to go back to see if I got this place on an off night. Until then, I would stick with some of my other favorites for pizza:\n\nArinelle for slices (take-out/counter)\nGialina\nZero, Zero\nTony's Neapolitano.\n\nHere's a review of some other pizza places I/we like:\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/gialina-pizzeria-san-francisco#hrid:4KFJvagoOj0tjZaXZ-wPIw/src:self", "author": "Peter O."}

However...so much of the dining experience is based on how you FEEL as a diner and this place falls so short in that way. Others mentioned the strict rules about seating which we experienced and then we were told, upon entering at 545 on a Sunday evening, that we had an \"out time\" of 815. We tried to lighten that up by asking what exactly would happen at 815 if we weren't \"out\" and the seater with his over-inflated sense of importance, told us that 6 people would be standing over our table pressuring us to leave. The food isn't good enough to warrant this mindset and there's definitely better Italian in the city, go spend your hard earned money elsewhere.  Get over yourselves and treat your customers as if they matter most. Because they do. And FYI, it's a restaurant and not a surgery department - there needs to be a decent level of adaptability built in to your \"model\" to actually accommodate your clientele.

Appropriately crowded but not suffocating. Dined there last night with a party of 4. We shared the uovo pizza ($15) for an app and each of us ordered a pasta for the main. The uovo was a solid pizza with an egg on top and like my saying goes, eggs make everything better. My husband and I shared the maltagliatti with browned butter and giblet ragu ($15) and the corzetti with basil pesto and peas ($15). We inhaled both and were close to licking our plates.\n\nWine recs by both the bar guy and our server were spot on. Italian varietals paired nicely with our meal. We ended with a sort of pot-de-creme with a salted caramel fluff on top and a strawberry covered olive oil cake thing with marinated fennel and a honey-something ice cream. The latter was the consensus fave but both desserts didn't stand a chance.\n\nGreat use of complimentary flavors. Not your usual Italian fusion place...this place is Italian straight up.\n\nThey have some sort of \"casual service\" policy, which I think is a fancy way of saying they don't pour your wine or refill your water glasses. Not sure what I think of that. You definitely need to be proactive if you need anything during your meal.\n\nNeighborhood was very easy to park in. All around a positive experience. I would definitely go back.\n\nAccording to our server, the menu changes daily. I like that.", "author": "Jasmyn M."}

I think the menu changes often, but we got a rabbit ravioli that was absolutely dynamite. Also had a squid ink pasta that was good, but the rabbit ravioli stole the show completely. Good bread with good, flavorful olive oil. Be aware that this place is Italian not just in food but also in service, the service is good but a bit slow...but not to the point where it's a problem. You are trying to enjoy the meal after all, not rush in and rush out.\n\nThis would be a five star review but our pizza, which was otherwise very flavorful, was definitely a little burned and blackened.

Perfect place to go for a nice dinner after work with friends or co workers for a light dinner and drinks. I say light because the portions are small and as you've read, the pizzas are flat bread so you'll find yourself stuffed without the food coma from carb overload. \n\nWINE: Ordered two glasses of their Kerner which was about $9 a glass. SO GOOD! Definitely would recommend if you're into white wines that are in between a Chardonnay and Riesling. \n\nPIZZA: We ordered the Margherita and Proscuitto Pizza. The Margherita was decent, but tasted like every other Margherita pizza I have ever ordered. (I personally think the Margherita pizza at Beretta is more tasty). Everyone at the table thought that the Proscuitto was better because it was definitely more unique and the lemon zest gave it a nice kick to balance out the saltiness of the Proscuitto. \n\nMy friend ordered Melon and Grape Salad despite my warning that it was small and bland based on these reviews. He actually enjoyed the dish. It is a very light dish, sparse really, so don't expect to grub. \n\nDESSERT: Dessert was pretty bomb. I ordered the Cornmeal Almond Cake w/Peaches. The cake was really moist. It tasted like a sweetened piece of corn bread. Liked it! My friends ordered the Chocolate Budino w/Espresso. I tried this one too and thought it was packed with flavor, very rich and will hit that chocolate craving if you have one, but a bit too rich for my taste. \n\nOverall, a good experience. Probably would come back if not just for the wine and ambiance.\n\nParking is not bad. You might need to circle around for 5 minutes, but someone is bound to leave.", "author": "Kristina W."}

Being from NY, we instantly suspected 2+ hours, but it was actually only 45 minutes. We elected to sit immediately at the bar though. \n\nWe started with the halibut crudo, which was phenomenal. The fresh strawberries (both red and green), the favas and the arugula were just enough accompaniment to the fresh fish.\n\nWe shared the whole wheat strozzapretti pasta with roasted hen, bresaola and broccoli. This was the highlight for us. The hen was amazingly juicy and flavorful and broccoli crisp. Not to mention the perfectly al dente pasta with just enough \"tooth.\"\n\nFinally, we went for the fungi pizza. This was our \"least favorite\" dish, if you can call it that. The hen of the woods mushrooms, ramps, melted leeks, and fontina gave it an earthy flavor and I loved the buttery, crispy crust.\n\nOverall, we loved flour + water. I can understand 2- or 3-star reviews if there are serious flaws in food or service, but to ding a restaurant because it's popular is inane.\n\n(Pro-tip: they give very few of their tables up to OpenTable.

Came here on Friday night, for a 10:30 pm reservation after a round of drinks at the also, fan-freaking-tastic Bourbon & Branch. Call me dramatic, but this was a \"last meal on earth\" kind of good meal.\n\nI initially thought, 10:30 pm for dinner?!  But it was well worth saving up my stomach for.  I was fortunate to tag along with some friends visiting from out of state, one of who was able to snag us a reservation, even at that late hour. And not to mention people were still trickling in to get a seat at 11:30 pm. After my first bite, I knew why. Who freaking cares what time you eat at this fine establishment??? I would eat in my sleep if I could.  It was that good.\n\nWe were seated in the corner of the restaurant, under the painting with anchovies.  After quickly glancing at the menu, we decided to go all in for the Pasta Tasting menu, at $60 per person, participation is required by the entire table, no substitutions.\n\nAppetizer: albacore crudo with stone fruit & basil. Super fresh, and just the right size to whet my appetite for what was to come.\n\nWe ordered a salsiccia pizza to share.  The fennel sausage, padron peppers, shaved onion & pecorino toppings were so yummy. Fresh out of the oven, the crust and pie was perfectly chewy and done to perfection.  I remember wishing I had a second stomach to eat another one. \n\nNow onto the amazing handmade, fresh pastas: \n1. mint cappelletti with ricotta & summer squash\n2. crescenza tortelli with aceto balsamico & savory\n3. garganelli with artichokes, caper & mint\n4. cappellacci dei briganti with braised pork, sweet peppers & nepitella\n5. pork & fig raviolini with sicilian olives\n\nIt's hard to pick out a favorite pasta, they just kept getting better with each round, and each one was so different. Definitely richer in flavor and sauces as we progressed through our meal. Number four was super savory - but I was having an out of body pasta experience, I didn't care what they brought out, I would have inhaled it, as did the rest of my friends at the table. \n                \nDessert: basil panna cotta with berries & pistachio.  Weird to eat basil for dessert, but everything was so delicious, I had no trouble finishing this off.  Was perfectly creamy, and not overpowering.  Was good to cleanse off my palate with this, although don't think I'd order it on its own. \n\n5 Stars for service as well :)\n\nMy mouth is watering just thinking about it again ...

If you love things on a menu that you have to google to know what you're eating and drinking, you might like this place.  \n\nI LOVE and drink a lot of wine. Every wine on this menu was nothing I had ever heard of and was also impossible to determine what it was based on the description.  They were all Italian wines, which understandably I hadn't had before, but a little description about what it's like would go a long way.\n\nAlso, if you like paying for an $18 salad that has four pieces of tomato on it, this might be the place for you.\n\nWe show up for our reservation on time.  They don't seat us for fifteen minutes, even thought there are a lot of tables (including the one they sat us at) that were vacant.  Not that I really noticed, because I decided to use the bathroom -- which took as long as we had to wait because they have ONE bathroom for the entire restaurant and the line for that was four people deep.  PS...the bathroom is GROSS.\n\nWe finally sit down and the food and service was a total let down.  I had checked the menu online earlier in the day and saw that there were two entrees -- a pork thing and a salmon thing.  Well, they must have changed their menu for that night and not updated their website because our only two options were rabbit and salmon.  I don't eat bunny and my bf doesn't eat fish.  Ok...what else do we have? Pasta and pizza.  I'm gluten intolerant.  So, we ask the server if there are any wheat and gluten free options.  He says he'll check but doesn't come back.  When he comes back, we ask again.  He says he'll check again -- comes back and says that nothing is gluten free. We decide to order a pizza and a pasta, I would just deal with it.  The dishes were OK, nothing to write home about.  We also ordered the one dessert we could determine what it was on the menu, a chocolate thing, and it was so incredibly over salted I almost gagged.\n\nLastly, we realized once we were there that this wasn't the place for us but we were respectful and polite, trying to make the most of it.  But, even so, once this waiter determined we weren't cool foodie people who were absolutely drooling over the experience, he basically ignored us. No one thanked us on the way out, even though we walked right by him and many others.  In my opinion, these people need to get over themselves a little bit. Or, a LOT. It's just food -- and for how expensive it is, you could at least be nice about it.\n\nIf you want great unpretentious food, served by warm kind people -- don't go here.

When I first stepped into flour+water, the ambience was casual and the decor had an industrial feel. A lot of the items on the menu sounded so tasty and it was great that I went with a small group so we ended up ordering a bunch of difference dishes to share.  The dinner menu has a selection of antipasti, pastas, pizzas, secondi, and contorni. The food here tasted fresh and light. My favorites included the funghi pizza and squid ink pasta. The dishes were well presented. I also forgot to mention what great service I experienced here. The hostess was super nice and our server had some great suggestions on what to order and he basically planned out our menu for us.", "author": "Frances V."}

When I asked our server about this, I received a polite response that this is how they make their pizza. Hmm...\n\nDon't get me wrong I love roasted vegetables that have caramelized with darkened areas, however this was just a bitter burn. Even the basil on top of the pizza was burned.\n\nI can't believe that no other reviewer has commented on this, and that they serve it this way. \n\nWe also had three different servers. One dropped our water off didn't say hello and turned their behind to us to chat for a lengthy period with a regular customer. The other gave us a horrified look that we weren't going to drink alcohol.

If you have the time and the coin, the pasta tasting menu is a good way to go.  Since I am allergic to seafood, I couldn't go for the pasta tasting as there are no substitutions and there were at least two I couldn't try on the list.  So, we did the next best thing, and developed our own tasting strategy.  My friend and I shared an appetizer, a pasta dish, and a pizza, and of course some wine.  The menu changes daily, but there are always plenty of choices to choose from in each category.  And if you don't understand the Italian-worded ingredient, just ask, the staff don't mind and don't look down at you for not knowing.  The beet salad was a good start for us.  It came with some other purple root vegetable mixed in the salad, and we debated if it was a purple carrot or raw beet, I don't think we ever figured it out, but it was good.  Then came the pasta dish, and after arguing that we couldn't eat a bunny, we decided on the radiatore with braised quail & pimento peppers, and the pasta was so tasty and fresh.  Finally, our pizza arrived, and we had the pizza with sausage and heirloom tomatoes which had a nice crust and good sauce, but a little non-existent on the cheese.  I think I need to come back and get the margherita pizza to assess the full pizza experience from this place.  The wine menu is pretty extensive, and they have a few craft beers available as well.  All and all a good experience.  Oh, and you don't need a reservation and can normally squeeze in on one of the community tables within 15-20 minutes on a standard weeknight.

I've been to flour + water three or four times now and their menu never fails to impress. They always have some exotic options; most recently we had pork belly pizza, fried veal brains (very hard to find), and a pasta with braised duck giblets.  All of their noodles are spectacular and homemade. Sauces are always well balanced and nuanced. Pizzas are thin, wood-fired, and crispy, but definitely a little heavier than typical italian appetizers. If you're new to SF, I'd definitely recommend trying this place at least once. \n\nHowever, there's not much value in repeat patronage. The service has usually been mediocre. They refused my request to make a reservation outside of their 2pm-8pm window when I was there *in person*, and every time I've been there (except the last) it's taken at least 30 minutes to get a table *even with a reservation*. Table-side service is usually decent, though the waiters have frowned at me for making special requests to add or remove items from pastas. You must specifically ask for bread (maybe twice). I've also sometimes been frowned at when our party ordered a third course to try more of the menu. They clearly want to pack the house and speed people along, which I can understand, but then they don't deserve the prices they demand. If their true goal is volume, perhaps they should try going fast-casual. \n\nNevertheless, you'll definitely eat some memorable food here.  Overall, flour + water is not yet a local classic like Tartine, Delfina, or Chez Panisse, but they may very well get there one day.", "author": "Paul W."}

This time, instead of pizza, we decided to try the pastas since we'd heard good things.  Fantastic!  It looks like the menu changes regularly & now I can't remember exactly which ones we had, but I do remember that my boyfriend had a spinach-based pasta with braised pork shoulder, and that mine had olives in it & was more strongly flavored.  Both were wonderful, with fresh-tasting pasta, delicate & savory flavors, & tender meat.  We sat at the bar (seated right away this time, at 10 pm on Valentine's Day), & the bar tender was happy to give us wine recommendations & let us test several different things until we found what we wanted.\n\nFor dessert, I had the ricotta pound cake with meyer lemon marmalade & honey thyme ice cream, and my boyfriend had the chocolate budino with espresso-caramel cream & sea salt.  Both were FABULOUS, and again, the bartender recommended the perfect dessert wine for each.  I'm so glad we finally went back, & that we weren't disappointed. :)", "author": "Angela B."}

We got there pretty early at around 5:20pm and there was already a line up waiting for the place to open.  Expectations were now pretty high. \nI came here for the pasta tasting menu which changes quite often.  It's a communal menu so the entire table has to get it. The menu consisted of: \n- Pasta Estivi -  stuffed pasta with ricotta and corn puree,  couldn't taste too much of the corn but nonetheless, tasty.   It came with basil and roasted tomatoes which made it refreshing. \n- Spaghetti in clam sauce - my favourite!  The clam sauce was light, broth based on creamy, and topped with crispy bread crumbs.  I could have had a couple more servings of this. For a short while after this meal, every time  I saw a similar version on a menu I got it but have been disappointed. \n- Duck tortellini in a braised onion sauce - this dish came looking limpy and smothered with parm.  The tortellini was really light on the duck, heavy on the sauce which made it too savoury.  Between my husband and I, we got 2 each which was enough.  Didn't enjoy it as much. \n - Pasta with beans - pasta triangles with beans and pork belly reminded me of Chinese sausage.  It was okay but forgettable.\n- Ravioli stuffed with sweetbreads - the ravioli with veal sweetbread stuffing with figs in the sauce.  It was really savoury so the sweetness of the figs helped.  However, you couldn't really taste the sweetbreads, which was a shame.  I was looking forward to this one.\n\nOverall, the tasting menu is worth a try & interesting once but I'd come back and just order off the menu.", "author": "Tanya N."}

I got there about 30 minutes early and took a few strolls around the block.  As I rounded the corner at t-minus 3 minutes, the line was already 10 strong!  No longer was I the first customer of the night... Dang it.\n\nWell, I made sure that I would be the first one to use the oven that night,.  I quickly shot in my order for the special pie that my server said was one of the best thing he has ever eaten: the Osso.  \n\nI made sure to put Californian pizza on my SF dining list, and boy, was flour+water a good choice.  Only in California can you find a pizza with bone marrow, fontina, horseradish, and rapini greens.\n\nOf all of the tastes, I think you would want your pizza to be NOT salty and NOT bitter; generally I would better tolerate a tangy/sweet pizza.  This pizza was both salty/bitter.\n\nThis is one occasion where I can say that my mouth experienced an amazing confusion.  The earthy, crisped greens balanced the creamy beef marrow, and the light dusting of horseradish cut through the rich Fontina.  \n\nThough I am a stickler on crust and this crust was not amazing, the crisp and chewy thinness was good enough to hold up to these crazy flavors.  The light char was also a nice finish.  Another textural problem was the thickness of the cheese and beef marrow; they were both blob-like, but I can definitely look beyond \"unrunny beef marrow\" and \"too much cheese.\"  I also liked that they did not need any sauce to make the pie moist.\n\nThis joint is perfect for freaks who like to be first in line at a popular restaurant.  The wait is worth it because the restaurant takes proper care in making the food the focus.  The prices are fair, and the ingredients are top notch here.", "author": "Solomon W."}

But I can tell you by the end of the meal they were no longer strangers, but fellow food comrades ooing and ahing over every dish, offering bites of dishes we didn't order and marveling at the party going on our mouths.  \n\nThe atmosphere and ambiance were laid back yet stylish, with great music playing.  The tag team wait staff was superb.  They paired my wine beautifully and made great suggestions on food and after dinner drinks.\n\nHere's what we ordred and tasted.  Keep in mind the menu changes every day and they do not allow take-out b/c it compromises the integrity of the food.  I absolutely LOVE that.\n\nSteelhead crudo w/ pickled beets, black radish, meyer lemon & horseradish aioli - crudo basically means raw in this dish.  The combination of taste and textures was delish.  I didn't taste the horseradish which was a good thing in m book.\n\nCrispy pork belly with dried apricot mostarda, shaved fennel, wild arugula and pistachios - very well prepared but not my favorite dish\n\nSalsiccia pizza - wild nettles, garlic white wine sausage & perorino - fabulous flavors and the crust was perfection.  Rather large portion too.\n\nParsnip cappelletti w/ aceto balsamic- - holy clouds of heavenly delight.  This was a standout dish, although in my humble opinion could have used a bit more aceto balsamico\n\nRosemary pappardelle w/ milk brased lamb shoulder and rapini - OMG if you every see this dish on the menu, ORDER IT.  I'd say this was my favorite dish I've ever had.  They fold the rosemary into the freshly made ribbons of pasta.  Unbelievable flavors.  The lamb was not gamey at all and reminded me of pulled pork in a way.  Absolutely outstanding.\n\nSauteed beet greens w/ pine nuts, currants and balsamico - a bit sweet and OUTSTANDING.  I was very pleasantly surprised and would order again in a heartbeat.\n\nRoasted cauliflower w/ almonds, bread crumbs and pecorino - quite tasty and prepared w/ a little heat.  My foodie friends loved it, but it wasn't as good as the beet greens in my opinion.\n\nWe ordered one of every dessert and thank goodness we did.  We thought there was something inappropriate going on at the other end of the table and when one of them picked up the bowl and proceded to lick it, I knew we were in for a treat.\n\n\norange zest zabaione with meyer lemon curd, \ncitrus segments & anise biscotti  - I wasn't sure about this when we ordered it, but it was light, full of delicious citrus flavor and a delight.\n\nchocolate budino with espresso-caramel cream & sea salt - this is all that needs to be said: my friend asked if he could put the bowl down his pants.  Yes, it really was that freakin good.  I actually dreamed about it last night.\n\nspice cake with lambrusco poached pears & maple walnut ice cream - excellent and full of molasses flavor.

We did realize that without a reservation, there will most likely be a wait.  But we were okay with it and thought we can grab a drink at bar to pass the time.  We arrived at a little after 9:30pm, and to our surprise, there wasn't a line, not a soul.  The restaurant was almost full but there were a few open spots at the communal table.  We proceeded to the hostess and was told by her that there was a wait (even though there was no one waiting and a few seats open at the communal table).  Okay, no problem.  We asked if we could grab a drink at the bar while waiting and was given an emphatic and snotty \"NO\".  Okay... Then this is when it got really good, she told us the wait time was TWO HOURS.  Right, so no one waiting + seats open + can't wait / drink at the bar + @930pm + entitled hostess = TWO HOUR wait.  Thanks but no thanks.

They are cooked al dente and balance flawlessly with the accompanying sauces and other components.\n\nMy feelings on ice cream are of the take it or leave it variety (and I usually choose to leave it).  With that in mind, let it be known that I had to pump the brakes to keep from devouring the maple walnut ice cream that my sister ordered up for dessert.

It was literally almost freezing outside, so we decided to wait it out in the restaurant over a couple of drinks. Just as we were deciding to order, the hostess came up to notify us that someone was a no-show...and we were taking their table! Score!\n\nmargherita - tomato, basil, fior di latte, extra virgin olive oil: At a place called \"Flour + Water,\" a pizza was a must-try. Here we had the margherita. A crispy, thin crust was topped with a sweet tomato sauce and mozzarella. A very good pizza; though, I did prefer Zero Zero's version, as I thought their flavors were a little more vibrant.\n\ncocoa tajarin with brown butter braised giblets & butternut squash: Of course, some pastas were in order. This was a pretty interesting pasta, as it was made with cocoa. I did taste a subtle cocoa flavor in the pasta, but the deep, meaty ragu was much more pronounced. The corn added a nice sweetness and freshness to this rich dish.\n\nrosemary pappardelle with braised hen, rabe leaves & meyer lemon: One of the best things I ate in 2010, no doubt. Now, I love myself a bowl of good pasta...which is exactly what we had here. First, we had pieces of rosemary speckled throughout the pasta - this gave the pasta a unique look and an interesting way to impart the herb's flavor. Rosemary can often be overwhelming, but it wasn't at all here. The hen was tender and succulent, and made for a fantastic bite with the al dente pasta. Finally, some meyer lemon zest added just a little bit of citrus to complete the dish. Amazing!\n\nagnolotti dal plin: A meaty pork shoulder filled these agnolotti. The pasta was cooked a nice al dente, and really packed a lot of flavor with the pork. A light butter-based sauce was a welcome addition.\n\nchocolate budino with espresso-caramel cream & sea salt: This has to be the restaurant's most well-known dessert. The budino was rich, yet not too thick, with a good chocolate flavor. I especially liked the espresso-caramel cream with the chocolate, and the sea salt was a really nice way to bring out the flavors.\n\nWhile we were only able to try a few dishes between the two of us, I thought it was a pretty good sample of what the restaurant had to offer. Still, I'm leaving this at 4.5 stars until I'm able to try a little bit more. I'd have to say I was impressed. I'm a sucker for good pastas, and here I found them to be imaginative, well-executed and, of course, delicious. The menu is small and changes often, so I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to try the rosemary pappardelle again, but it's something I will remember for a long time.

The sausage pizza (it had a much fancier name) was about the same price as the pasta and delicious. \nWhile the portions for the pasta looked small, they were actually quite filling. I wasn't impressed by what the waiter termed their 'roly poly pasta' aka their cavatelli...but the other pasta dishes ordered at the table were really good. \n\nThe space is small and there was a line out the door when we arrived at 5:30.

They also give you complimentary sparkling water :).\n\nWe started off with the antipasta - the steelhead crudo (basically salmon with pickled beets, roe, and radishes). This was ok; nothing mind blowing and I could have gone without it.\n\nThe next dish we got was the pasta stuffed with game hen. The top of the dough was hard(where they crimp it), the stuffing was dry but the butter sauce it came in was good - but c'mon it's butter; how can you make butter taste bad?\n\nThe first pizza we got was the osso pizza. This was Mehhhhhh. Nothing mind blowing, I don't know why people love this. It's too salty. As I ate our next pizza, the margarita, I couldn't help but continually wonder what the hype was all about with this place. The osso had horse radish and apparently it's supposed to have bone marrow but I never saw or tasted anything resembling bone marrow. Some bites were bitter, some bites were filled with horseradish and every bite was salty. The margarita...man I don't even know where to start with this one. Here was the tomato sauce?!?! Whatever was on this pizza did not taste like tomato sauce not was there enough of it on there.  Everything about this was salty too, so I wonder if someone knocked the salt over into our pizzas. I think we went through 5 bottles of the sparking water between the 3 of us.\n\nSo I am not trying to sound like a pizza snob or anything but i have had my fair share of pizzas (from Italy to the crap on the corner to homemade) and this is place is nowhere up to par with most of the places I've been to.

If I'm paying $20 plate I want food that I'm incapable of preparing myself.  F+W provides that.  Of the four pasta dishes I've had, 3 were to die for and one was just good. The squid ink-hued pasta folded into little baskets and stuffed with a combination of seafood goodness in a tasty broth was visually appealing, delicate, and delicious. The one good not amazing pasta was a tad salty. \n\nWe tried the pizza this time around- the basic margherita which we thought would be a good measure of how good their pizza actually is- and it was delish. Tastiest I've had in a city filled with gourmet pizza joints. \n\nOur server was completely polite and hospitable. Sat at the bar one night and the communal table the next. \n\n2.

Reservations are hard to come by on Open Table, but they do reserve half of the seats for walk ins, and getting here by 5pm on a Saturday got me the first table during the first seating.  The space is not tiny but isn't huge, so I would not wait until 5:30 to try to get a walk in.\n\nIt's not just the pizza, which is awesome - get the pasta tasting.  It takes about 2 - 2.5 hours but is only $65 per person.  Wine pairings are $45 a person, but they have a lot of bottles for around $45-50, too (All Italian wines, no liquor).\n\nIncluded in our tasting...\n1. Dill cured salmon with favas, rye crumble, pickled radish, creme fraiche: salmon was nicely cured, the fava and green peas tasted really spring like and fresh\n2. Taleggio scarpinocc with aceto balsamico: BEST pasta of the night - butter emulsion sauce over house made pasta with a center pocket holding more sauce, topped with parmesan and a perfectly reduced balsamic\n3. Potato and artichoke carmelle with proscuitto and olives: pasta filled with potatoes and artichoke, kind of like a hard candy in a wrapper.  Olive was subtle, loved the proscuitto.\n4. Duck raviolini with black trumpet mushrooms and nettles: thicker pasta held up nicely to the duck, which was subtle.  I wish there were more mushrooms.\n5. Maltagliati with rabbit liver and broccoli flower: probably my least favorite - triangle shaped pasta with rabbit liver - better with more cheese, but I wasn't a huge fan of the rabbit liver.\n6. Orecchiete with pork sugo and snap peas: can't go wrong with house made ear shaped pasta, which holds the pork sugo well.  It's a bit heavy, especially as the last course, but it was very well flavored with a nice kick.\n7. White chocolate semifreddo with pistachio and strawberry: nice and light, small, slightly tart, a nice clean finish.\n\nThe table next to us shared their pizza with us, and I have never had such a flavorful crust.  It was chewy, and there was plenty of seasoning (I usually leave the crust behind).  Definitely go with the salumi one.\n\nAdded pluses: complimentary house sparkling water, candles in 100ml beakers, and an awesome staff.  Parking isn't too bad around here.

I enjoyed almost everything we had. The Sierra Beauty Apples with Marisa cheese, Shaved Fennel, Mustard Greens & Wild Arugula was refreshing and a nice way to start off our meal.The Cotechino with Umbrian Lentils, Parsnip & Quail Egg was equally good, rich and savory accented with a runny yolk to tie everything together. \n\nWe ordered almost every pasta on the menu and though everything was tasty, the favorite of the night had the be the pasta with braised pork shoulder which was a special and not on the regular menu. It was insanely good, one bite made you think of total and utter comfort food. The Pork Trotter Ravioli was another one of my favorites though others at the table found it a tad salty.\n\nIn terms of Margherita  pizza, Delfina Pizzeria still reigns supreme on my list but the one at flour + water is a solid second without any contenders coming close. We also had the Funghi pizza with an egg on top but the Taleggio cheese on it was too strong for my liking though the Rapini leaves did balance out the richness. \n\nService was fabulous.

Our server was fabulous- super cute, very friendly, and when I asked for a glass of something delicious, she brought me a wine I loved every time.

The reason why is, to me, the ingredients are extremely fresh and high quality and I have to give them high scores for that.  We sat at the bar and looked straight into the kitchen (which was very cool btw, kinda like sitting at the chef's table) so we could see all the prep.... lots of love goes into each dish and the kitchen is absolutely spotless.\n\nGetting in - yep we all know it is a pain.  They opened at 5:30, we got there at 5:45 and sat at the bar as I mentioned.  It's actually a great place to sit, you are there with the bartender (more like winetender) and about 7 other people.  \n\nNote that the menu changes ALL the time (again, fresh and seasonal - love it).  We started with a roasted cauliflower salad with kale chips and I think roasted lemon?  Can't remember but it was awesome.  I ordered the soup which is maybe the best soup I've ever had at a restaurant!  I think it was root vegetable soup with brown butter, chestnuts and fennel pollen.  Seriously, ridiculously good. Next, rabbit cannelloni - delish.  Then the margarita pizza.  I've read a few reviews debating their pizza... to me it is fabulous.  Maybe cuz I'm Italian but I just really like the simple pizzas... the sauce didn't overpower, just nice tomatoes with not much added if anything, very little salt even - fresh mozzarella, a little basil, very very thin crust, and you are done.  The crust is really nice too.

Despite an 8:15pm reservation, our table was not available until 8:45pm.  Seems like the group at that table enjoyed a more leisurely dinner than F+W staff had predicted.  That being said, soon after we sat down, one of the hostesses came by and gave us 2 free appetizers to thank us for our patience.  Great service here!\n\nThe 4 of us thought about getting the pasta tasting menu, but upon closer inspection of the dinner menu, we saw \"pork belly\" and immediately decided to order several dishes and share.  This also gave us a chance to order a pizza.\n\nAppetizers:\nCauliflower (with scarlet turnip, crispy kale, preserved lemon and caper vinaigrette): tasty but a really tiny portion.  Not sure if this is a normal portion or if they made it smaller since it was on the house.  Good but not memorable.\n\nAutumn squash salad (with lardo, brussel sprout leaves, pistachio and balsamico): same as cauliflower above\n\nSweet potato soup (with walnut , pear, and watercress oil): tasty and unique flavors.  There was a non-spicy \"kick\" to this dish, which may just have been watercress now that I think about it.\n\nPasta:\nFarro radiatore (with poached whey hen, broccoli di ciccio, peranzana olive): not what I expected when I saw \"farro\" on the menu, but a flavorful dish.  Can't say I know what's so special about whey hen, but the chunks were pretty tender and juicy.\n\nCappellacci dei briganti (with rabbit polpettine, lobster mushroom & kale): a rich dish.  Very tasty but definitely one to split, as it tasted heavy on the cream and/or cheese.  Rabbit meatballs were good and tender. Probably the richest dish of the night.\n\nSaffron chitarra (with braised squid and sea beans): didn't know what seabeans were before and still don't know.  Reminded me of a Japanese dish, mostly because the squid was quite squid-y, perhaps not in the best way.\n\nChestnut magliati (with porcini and sage): my favorite of the night.  Delicate triangles of pasta with seasonings that were just right.  Also one of the lightest dishes of the evening.\n\nPizza:\nSalsiccia with broccoli rabe and caramelized onions: was charred a bit too much for our liking.  Not the best sausage I've had and didn't get as much out of the rabe as I had hoped.  Other than being in the oven too long, crust was of good texture.\n\nSecondi:\nRoasted pork belly with fingerling potatoes, kohlrabi and apples: good dish but pork tasted heavy on the salt.  Otherwise the actual cooking execution was done very nicely.\n\nDessert:\nOlive oil cake with thyme and ice cream: good and light\n\nOverall the service was great and the food was good.  Some of the dishes were just too rich or a tad too salty, but overall very tasty.  Certainly I would recommend getting a recommendation, as I probably would not be as happy with the meal had I waited for an hour as a walk-in.\n\nAll the food above plus 2 beers and 1 glass of wine for 4 people came out to just over $50 per person.  A better deal than the pasta tasting, price-wise, and we got to try more of the other items.  That being said, the pastas are probably the highlight of their whole menu.", "author": "Naoko M."}

We started with a few local craft beers, of which I can't recall the name--It was a Saison and surprisingly balanced and refreshing. We then requested a basket of the crisp yet fluffy house bread with seriously some of the best olive oil I've had. The oil had a spice to it, yet was incredibly balanced. The thing is, you come here for the pasta in my opinion. I ordered the rabbit fattisu with whole grain mustard and mustard greens. It was one of the best pastas I've ever had--the pasta itself was etherial in texture, and the rabbit filling was perfectly seasoned. The sauce was bright and acidic from the mustard and the greens added the perfect bitter note. If I had one complaint it would be that the pasta was a tad over-salted in my opinion.

In fact, it crashed and burned.\n\nIn short, food was mediocre and service was atrocious.  \n\nWhen the waitress asked us if we had any questions about the menu, I asked if she could distinguish the farfalle with braised duck from the tagliarini with braised pork; was one richer than the other, etc.  She said \"well, they're both braised\" and then spelled out what the ingredients listed in the menu were.  I said politely, I can see they're both braised and I can see the ingredients but that I was trying to see if they had any general differences to narrow my choice.  She seemed flustered by the question and said they were about the same.\n\nSince all the wines were Italian, we asked if she could recommend something akin to a 4 year-old Cab Sauv from Napa, that's a common one that my wife and I both enjoy.   She said she only has worked in Italian restaurants so she doesn't know what a Cab Sauv from Napa tastes like.  She asked us to describe it in terms of tannins, fruit, and earthiness.  I said  they are not very earthy and have bold rich flavor, full-bodied, and 4 year's have balanced tannins and acids, and medium fruit flavor.  She picked out some Italian wine that she said should match \"closely\".  When they brought it out to taste, it was terrible and didn't even come close to tasting like a Cab Sauv.  We told the other woman serving us the wine (who was very polite)  what we had asked for originally and she made a face like (\"yeah, this is not going to be that\") and apologized.  They brought us back a much better wine close to what we're looking for, but the waitress never even apologized or acknowledged the mistake.  \n\nHow absurd that she works in a popular SF restaurant and literally has no idea what the local wines taste like?  \n\nWhen our wood-fired pizza came out, it was scorched for my wife's tastes and pushing the boundary for mine.  When she said she really couldn't eat it when it was that burnt, the waitress said \"well, that's a wood-fired oven pizza and that's the style\" which was her third condescending remark, like we only knew Pizza Hut or something.  My wife politely but firmly said she knows what wood-fired pizza was, but that this was burnt on the bottom, turning over a slice to show the abundance of black char. \n\nThey took away the pizza and a nicer waitress brought us a complementary budino to try to make up for this disaster of a dining experience.  At this point, we were just done and over this place.  It's one thing for the food to be mediocre but for the service to be so condescending, forget that.  We left the budino on the table untouched and tipped the minimum and we were out.\n\nYou can do much better at Deflina, Berretta, etc.  This place was a huge disappointment.

I.e., if you want to eat here, you've got to choose between a long wait or an impossible-to-get reservation.\n\nBut look: these sorts of practical considerations have obviously got to play a role in reviews. Two places can serve the exact same food with the exact same service in the exact same atmosphere, and if one place has no wait and is half as expensive, that place totally deserves a better review. Period. Consequently, if your restaurant is in fact *difficult* to eat at, then your food/service/atmosphere had better be correspondingly awesome.\n\nSo while all that at Flour+Water *is* pretty awesome, it doesn't quite stand out in my memory as being as good as it gets. That said, it gets close, and depending on the exact circumstances and contingencies of your visit, you might have an incredibly memorable meal there; for that reason, I think it'd be entirely worth your while to try it out some time.", "author": "Greg P."}

I went when they first opened and I hear that they've gotten substantially better since then, but my experiences in their first few months were so unsatisfactory that I fear going back. Especially since there are so many great, new, and delicious restaurants in SF. If you want to survive in such a culinary savvy city, you've got to bring your A game. \n\nI went with my sister and a few of her friends and we shared a bunch of dishes- so i was able to get a feel for many things on the menu. We ordered a pizza, pasta, salad, and appetizer. First of all, the portions were tiny for how big their prices were. 2nd, the flavors were very dull. We ordered a margherita pizza, which i didn't think was easy to mess up. It was incredibly lackluster. 3rd, the service was subpar. Our server was not very attentive and when asked for a good bottle of red wine-anything But dry, she brought us possibly the dryest red wine in the restaurant. \n\nWhen asked for dessert, we politely declined. It's a good thing Humphrey Schlocome's is a nice few block walk down the street. \n\nOverall, not a very pleasant experience for a very high price. I would consider going back again, because I believe in 2nd chances. But with so many other great restaurants in our fabulous city, it might be a while before I go back. \n\nIf you venture over there, suerte.

I went tonight I had a craving for pasta tasting menu with wine pairings. The first few courses  really showcased the tomatoes and seasonal flavors. The last three were just OK. Not at all worth the price.  most importantly I have a real issue with the service at this restaurant. It is always so robotic. I have eaten there at least 15 times and it's had private parties and still I walk in and the service is just robotic there is never a connection. I sat at The counter this evening and the bartender was just mumbling his way through the wines and the food and it was just devastating and pathetic.

The interior is nice. For appetizers, we ordered the marinated squid ($13) and the cucumber & radish salad ($10). What you get is a skillful exercise in negative space -- a mostly empty plate with a beautifully arranged line of salad along the middle. We found them severely lacking in flavor, particularly the salad. All three of us suggested salt, right upon first taste. The squid was somewhat better, but those dishes are no doubt *way* overpriced.\n\nFor mains we had the pizza w/ salsiccia (+ egg, $20 total) and melanzana ($16), and the scarpinocc pasta ($16). The latter repeated the negative space exercise, and while tasty, should really land in the appetizer category in terms of portion size. The pizzas were good, but certainly not great or even amazing. The desert, a chocolate budino ($8) was quite nice.\n\nThe music was a bit off the whole evening (too clubby/trancey) and got way too loud toward the end of our stay (~22h).\n\nAllora, nutshell: we don't get what's great enough about this place to warrant an hour-long wait, or the prices. F&W tries too hard to be special, and doesn't really deliver. Keeping an entire menu in Italian does *not* mean sophistication, it only means whipping out smartphones and asking lots of questions. We had a fun time, because of company -- the food was secondary all night.\n\nIf you want to get what F&W aspires to be, go to A16, where you'll spend the same amount of money but will be wowed all around.", "author": "Amy P."}

I have been wanting to eat here forever but its hard to get a reservation and every time I tried to walk in, the wait was too long. This time, I went right when they opened on Sunday night and was immediately seated at the communal table. Great wood decor and cool, casual, funky vibe. \n\nWe were immediately given a bottle of complimentary sparkling water.  Glasses of wine were ordered and promptly brought to us.\n\nWaitress was so cute and extremely helpful. We ordered almost everything she suggested.\n\nFor starters, the yellowtail crudo with fava beans. Yummy. Strange herbs that seemed more like yard plants than food but delicious. Very small portion though.\n\nPizza with fontina, pesto and sausage. Nice thin crust. The sausage was not spicy, italian as I would have imagined. It was pretty delicate.  Very good, not the best pizza I have ever had, but up there in the top 10.\n\nApparently the kitchen was backed up (we didn't even notice) so they apologized and brought us a complimentary appetizer. It was the rabbit terrine. First off, I had bunnies as pets as a kid, so this freaked me out a bit. It wasn't bad.  Kind of like pate with pistachios. My BF ate most of it.\n\nNext the nettle tortellini with wild boar sugo.This was damn good but not nearly as good as the fettuccini with hen, chicken livers, and farm fresh egg on top. Oh my goodness! The egg makes this dish. You break the egg and stir it into the steaming pasta and it thickens the whole thing up.  It is so good.

It was for a 9 PM reservation which isn't too bad because we're used to eating late.  Parking in the area is pretty easy to find, and we were within 1 block of the restaurant.\n\nFor dinner, we started with lamb raviolini and farfalle with braised duck.  While the farfalle reminded us of the pasta we ate in Italy, the raviolini was underwhelming.  The portions are small for the price you are paying.  Next, we ordered the famous salsiccia - sausage pizza.  Some would compare this to Pizza Bianco down in Arizona, and for us it was good but only as good as Otto in New York.  Thus said, the pizza was good but not worth waiting 2 months for.  We still had room in our tummy for dessert which was chocolate budino with espresso caramel cream & sea salt.  The dessert was superb and we finished every bite of it.\n\nAs for all of the accolades Flour and Water has received, we must agree with some of the other reviews here and that it's overrated.  I have been to other 'Top 10' restaurants in the US, and Flour and Water is just okay.  The service is both good and bad.

Unfortunately, it failed.\n\nI made the reservation four weeks in advance, and we arrived on time.  We waited over an hour for our table.  Standing in a crowded bar where there is barely enough room to turn around for an hour is not a great way to start your dinner.   We tried to sit down and the bar but we were told to stand so they could accomodate some walk-ins at the  bar.   \n\nThe staff were apologetic about the wait time, and when we finally sat down, they brought us a complimentary appetizer.  They also comp'd a dessert at the end of our meal.  I appreciated all of their efforts, and I tipped very generously. \n\nThe food, however, was not as good as I hoped it would be.   The pizza crust was just not as good as the pizza at Zero Zero or Pizzaolo or even Gialina.  It was charred black in spots and tough.   It may be their style, but I guess I don't like burnt crust.  \n\nI had a rosemary pasta dish with chicken that was very salty.

The hype! Elusive rezzies! Steve Jobs turned away!  Ahhh!  Never had I read so many yelp reviews, thoroughly causing me confusion and mild anxiety prior to going to a resto!  But, now that I've experienced F&W, I would say the hype is spot on for the *crust* of the pizza, but that's it. I wouldn't make another 2.5 month advance reservation just to eat here.  (On the other hand, I'd wait day and night to eat the fried chicken at Wayfare Tavern).\n\nCame on a sunday night and the place was packed and people were waiting.

Light, delish, good starter.\n-Margherita pizza -crust was the best crust i've had. chewy, slightly sweet, tender. More!!\n-Mushroom pizza - very earthy/woodsy combo of mushrooms.  Strong flavor. Tasty.\n-Rigatoni w/braised pork-- this was DELICIOUS.  Tomato based sauce, yet super savory.  And pork was so tender, perfect chunks that melted in my mouth.  I liked this better than the pizza crust.\n-Black ink squid pasta w/clams.   I was not friends with this dish.  One reviewer said that this was too \"fishy\". I agree. I am a huge seafood fan, but this just smelled and tasted way too fishy.  As in that smell when you go a pier where people are fishing.  Could be my taste buds, but I strongly disliked this dish. \n\n-Pumpkin cake w/olive oil ice cream and poached quince:  The ice cream was good. Pumpkin cake was a bit dry, more like a slice of quick bread.  (We affirmatively decided against the budino, which also seems polarizing on yelp!)\n\nTAKEAWAY:\nReserve 2 months in advance.  Get a pizza, a pasta, decide where you come out on the F&W debate. Oh, ask for some free bread. The olive oil it comes with is pretty good.  They don't just dish out the bread-- must ask for it.

I was weary of the clams, then remembered it was SF so that shit was prolly gonna be fresh and melty, and it was.  There is a general no-no in cooking where you dont mix cheese with seafood, which was just fine.  I saw the next day that they replaced the clams with fontina.\n\nSupplementing that was a good but eyes bigger than stomache choice of the pasta of the day and I can't remember what it was called but it was folded pasta with I think a white wine and nettles sauce--sorta like a pesto--with rabbit sausage.

The moment I stepped in and saw all those happy faces tasting pasta and sipping on wine with Scottish music playing in the background, I immediately felt comfortable in this homey environment. \n\nOur waiter who served us was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu but spoke way too fast. First of all, the menu itself seems like a foreign language to me and the waiter who spoke 1000 words a minute didn't help either. As helpful as the waiters are, I think there should still be more explanations on the menu as to what some of their food items are (What is Sformato?).\n\nI had the mint tagliatelle with whey braised lambs & peas, which came in smaller portion than I expected but tasted like top-notch pasta. It did not taste that minty as expected but the lamb was cooked to near perfection. The only downside is that for $18 a bowl, I was still hungry even after I cleaned it out.\n\nI also tried the sardines pizza, which is either a LIKE or DISLIKE. You definitely have to be a fan of sardines to like this pizza. I wasn't the biggest fan of sardines, so the pizza itself was a bit of a shock to me. But it was good nonetheless (I'm assuming for sardine lovers).\n\nFor dessert, I tasted the warm polenta cake and the chocolate budino.

They're really really good. \nI tried maybe 8 different ones and they've all been good.  \n\nI once had a \"grilled cheese stuffed squid\" appetizer there which was just incredible- like straight out of a 5 star Greek Resturant - next time I came back for seconds it was nolonger on the menu. \n\nThey always have interesting desert options also, like Delicious basil ice-cream .\n\nBiggest issue with this place is the wait- it gets annoying. If you didn't have to wait I would give this place 5 stars, but 1-2 hour wait before you can get a table, gets annoying fast. \nLast time I came back, the waiter recognized me and came over and said hello, still had to wait for an hour for a table, so we started drinking wine which is something else they do great- so better go there with people you can stand more than an hour at the time.. Defitnately not a first date Resturant as you'll have to stand up against the wall with a glass of wine for at least an hour before getting seated.

After a scoop of Blue Bottle Vietnamese coffee ice cream at Humphry Slocombe's, we beelined a few blocks to flour + water for a bite of their famous pizza. \n\nIt was just going on 5pm, so the six of us settled down on the sidewalk to wait for the place to open. Major line drama ensued when some clearly delusional middle-aged mamas attempted to cut us out, whining a pathetic argument that they were there first, but left and came back.  We fixed them with our deadest of East Coast dead-eyed stares and they slunk off to their proper place at the END of the line. \n\nA speech of painfully fuzzy logic was next on the docket, this time from the host.  He lectured us that \"we don't usually take large parties\" to avoid overwhelming the kichen\" and entreated us repeatedly to \"be mellow\" and order family-style.  Need we glare again? Just seat us and let's get going, bro. \n\nOur server was all sweetness and light, salvaging the overall FOH impression.  Before we knew it, appetizers of melon salad with cured meats and a truly heavenly veal tongue-stuffed pasta were melting in our happy mouths. \n\nPizzas were equally good; characteristics were a superthin crust contrasted by a very springy outer rim.

And, it's been highly praised in the local media, setting expectations high. The combination of those three things meant that, despite its good reputation, I had heard from various sources that they had been let down and the restaurant was over-hyped. \n\nI'm here to publicly announce that I was dumb to have listened to those people, and regret not coming in for dinner until a year after its opening. Though I wouldn't wait 90 minutes to get a table, I certainly think that Flour + Water lives up to the hype.\n\nSo much so, that I wrote a full-blown review of it for Examiner with the same title, which you can read by following the Examiner link in my profile.\n\nThe basic premise is that this restaurant is serving food far above the average neighborhood Italian joint. I would label the dishes as Italian-inspired, as they are adapted into more modern cuisine through the use of seasonal ingredients. Every dish is beautifully presented and delicious. \n\nFor appetizers, the black cod was a clear standout, as was the halibut crudo. \n\nBut where the kitchen really shows its skill is in the pastas (especially the stuffed pastas): beautifully crafted, perfectly cooked, made with thoughtfully-paired, fresh ingredients.\n\nAnd of course, you can't forget the pizza, which ranks among the best that I've had in San Francisco (along with Pizzeria Delfina)\n\nThe best part is that they're open until 1 am, so my advice would be to have a late lunch and go after the crowds have dispersed, around 9:30-10.

Tried 5 different dishes which included the tomato and fried squash appetizer, the pomodoro pizza, the lobster pasta, the halibut, and finally the fried peppers in oil.  The best part of the meal was the chocolate buddino with rock salt and caramel cream.  Holy crap...that is like crack cocaine.  Combining salt and really sweet choc mousse like texture with caramel is freaking genius.

Luckily I snagged a seat at their communal table and ordered a bunch of food.\n\nOrder as follows:\n\nOsso Bone Marrow Pizza: This pizza was fantastic. I really enjoyed the fact that the ingredients were unconventional but the flavor profile wasn't too odd. The bone marrow added the extreme richness and meaty flavor while the rapini added the crunch and cut down the fatiness of the marrow. Definitely one of my favorite pizzas in San Fran.\n\nHen and Rabbit Tortelli: There are few things I like more then fresh pasta and this dish really was great. The tortelli was stuffed with rabbit and hen and it was easily one of the best pastas I've had in awhile. The filling was so flavorful and so unique. I could eat this everyday.\n\nSalsiccia Pizza- This pizza was also really good. I would have liked a little more flavor from the sausage, but overall a very strong pizza that I would certainly order again. If I had to pick between the two, I think I would go with the Bone Marrow though. What makes their pizzas so special is their crust. The char adds a little smokiness, but their is definitely some salt on the crust that just adds another dimension to the chewy delicious crust. Other than Tony's, this is my favorite crust in San Fran.\n\nFor dessert we got the chocolate budino with espresso ice cream and sea salt. This dish was the perfect examply of salty and sweet playing perfectly with each other. The texture and consistency were a lot different that the Budinos I am used to, but overall a great dessert.\n\nFlour + Water was really a great restaurant. With all the hype, I feel that they definitely lived up to it. The interior is nice and the clientele is definitely trendy. The food is unique and very delicious.

The menu is svelte, but I kinda like that.  I would not recommend banking on being \"first in line\" though, since we had the benefit of Memorial Day driving people out of the city, shitty weather to drive people inside, and Carnaval to drive away all the yuppie types afraid of minorities gathering together.\n\nThe \"meat pizza\" was competently delectable and generically good, notable mostly for its use of stracciatella cheese.  The funghi pizza, though, while not really the best pizza I've had, is one of the more interesting ones I've had in my life, especially in the use of nettles (note that these are really rough and can scrape lips).  It kinda looks like someone dropped a pizza in a garden and then picked it up to eat, with a very, very earthy flavor, but it was certainly novel, despite not being the most appetizing.  Unfortunately, the flavor of the morels themselves were completely lost amidst the nettles and lime, which is a really great shame.  The dessert was good but definitely, definitely not $9 good.  Christ, you can get like a half-dozen actual donuts for that price, with infinitely more flavor.  The blueberry ricotta sauce that came with it did not work at all, lacking any blueberry taste and was impressively overpowered by the ricotta.  \n\nAll in all, there are better pizza places in the city that don't require massive preparation to go to or a long wait to be seated for an experience that might have been disappointing if my friend didn't oversell the hell out of this place beforehand.

People, do you not have to work? My friend Peter didn't get to the restaurant until around 6pm (they only seat complete parties), but luckily, it was still early and they sat us at a communal table.\n\nWe started our meal by splitting a salsiccia pizza topped with rabe leaves, sausage, montasio cheese and caramelized onions. This thin-crust pizza was delicious and the bottom was still crispy when it arrived. I liked how the meat wasn't overwhelming and I love anything with caramelized onions in it. I just love tomato sauce on my pizza and pasta, so part of me kind of missed have the classic tomato sauce. I'm definitely glad that they put more toppings on their pizza compared to Pizzeria Delfina.\n\nWhile the pizza was good, the pastas were mind-blowing and totally stole the show. F+W make their own pastas and the menu changes daily. I ordered the squid ink pasta (I'm a sucker for squid ink) and it was served with fresh, sweet cherry tomatoes and uni. I had never had uni on pasta before and was really intrigued. Peter order a sage pasta with pork medallions.\n\nMy squid ink pasta was very good, but the uni made it incredibly rich. I felt like I had to take breaks and stop eating it at points so as not to get overwhelmed. I was in love with Peter's pasta and could not stop eating it (luckily, the man shares his food). I kept reaching my fork over and grabbing bites of his pasta and he even gave me the last bite (the sign of true friendship). His pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce almost reminded me of a reduced, chicken noodle soup. I know that sounds odd, but it had this \"homey\" taste to it that wasn't too rich and just really comforting. The pork was so tender and would just fall apart when I pierced it with my fork.\n\nI would totally go back to F+W, but the lines started getting long by the time we left the restaurant (past 7 pm). I'd go back for the pastas; however, I'm not willing to wait 2 hours for it. Totally advise you to go early if you want to eat there!\n\nMore pictures on my blog: http://rbjello.wordpress.com/2011/09/23/sf-birthday-extravaganza-i-flour-water-and-bi-rite-ice-cream/", "author": "Jackie T."}

The baby arugula in the beet salad CRUNCHED with all the salt.  The margherita pizza was 'meh'.  The pork was bland and the chocolate dessert was huge and disproportionate with the rest of the meal.\n\nWe had a two-top table that was VERY close to the other tables.  I was confused by the communal table which seemed to seat at least 12 people.  It seems F+W would be better served by breaking those tables up into smaller groups.

Flour+Water is on OpenTable but I believe the next available time slot is in October. So...make a reservation now and come back to eat in 1.5 months? Sounds about right. You might be able to luck out and call in but reservations are really really hard to get at a decent dinner hour. You'll probably score one for 5pm or 9pm and later. I made a reservation for 4 and showed up with 2 only to be told that they cannot honor our reservation and that we had to wait for a table for 2. Really? Okay . . . \n\nBUT for two, we ordered the carbonara and the emilia romagna. We added a farm egg on the carbonara but it honestly didn't do much of a difference. The emilia romagna had pesto on it as well has other mushrooms -- I can't remember. But the one thing that stood out among these pizzas is their crust. The crust is AMAZING. I can't begin to describe how well baked it is, chewy but not too chewy. Mmm delicious!\n\nFor dessert, my friend really wanted to get the \"chocolate budino with expresso-caramel cream and sea salt.\" So we did. Sweet, salty, sweet, salty -- it was odd to me at first but it was a really good balance. I swear if I made this at home I would totally butcher it. \n\nSo, here's what you do to eat at Flour+Water:\n1. Make a reservation (if your party is less than 6)\n2. Come back in about a months time\n3. Order a few pizzas to share\n4. Order the chocolate budino for dessert\n5. Repeat if you like.", "author": "Heidi C."}

Wish there were two of them on a busy night.  I'll also throw in half a star for the dining room d\u00e9cor, especially the locally-commissioned painting of anchovies mating on a bed of butterfly wings.\n\nWhat about the food?  Nothing we ate or saw at the communal table (a savvy way to save money on linen?) would be considered exceptional at the average Italian Army mess hall.  The kind of cibo any talented Umbrian mamma might cook up on a humdrum Tuesday night, the only difference being that these particular Umbrian mamma's boys might go to bed a little hungry.\n\nA $12 squash blossom appetizer with only one tiny cheese-filled blossom?  Get real.  Or should I say, really, really insulting.  But I can't cry \"false advertising,\" because after all, the menu does clearly stipulate \"blossom\" in the singular.  And I thought restaurants that plate a $10 one-scallop starter have nerve.  You should have seen the expressions on the faces of our tablemates when their Lilliputian bowls of dishwater-thin mushroom brodo arrived.  OK, I get it. It's billed as just a brodo, not a hearty zuppa, and it was probably delicious dishwater.  Again, technically not false advertising.  Yet several ounces of this meager soup added a sobering fistful of dollars to our compatriots' bottom lines.\n\nThe least costosa pizza on the menu is the $13 basic margherita.  That's right, dough, tomato sauce, cheese and basil.  The Margherita is supposedly a good litmus test of any pizzaiolo's skills, before you try a more creative pie. The problem was, we didn't get much of a read on this pizzaiolo's skills, since the--extremely high-quality, I'm sure--sauce was spread as thinly as Madoff's remorse.  Add to that a few slender disks of perfectly good fior di latte mozzarella and just possibly enough fresh basil to feed a family of two aphids.  Plus the crust was a little under-charred to be considered authentically Napolitano, but we probably got one of the first out of the oven, so I won't go there.\n\nAnything else worth bitching about?  Yes, big time: the music.  It didn't just suck, it hurt.  If after reading this review you STILL insist on trying Flour+Water, may I suggest bringing your biggest, baddest pair of earplugs?  Make sure those plugs are new and rated a full 33 NRR.  I can hardly remember a restaurant soundtrack that detracted more from the eating.  Whoever selects the teeth-rattling hard rock at this restaurant must have DJed for the Marines during the clearing of Fallujah.  If aspiring restauranteurs are looking for a secret weapon to turn tables rapidamente, Flour+Water's playlist is your Mecca.\n\nOh, and a couple of other sore points:  the first two samples of wine by the glass we tried were seemingly the product of sour grapes.  We moved on to the Nero d'Avola rosato, which sports a cute color and packs some bracing acidity of its own.  Maybe the reds didn't have enough breathing time, but when you're charging on average $10+ for a few slurps, those six wine-by-the-glass offerings ought to be more inspiring than the average juice you pull off the shelf at Trader Joe's (no offense, Signor Giuseppe).  Think about it, with the wine industry crying uncle and thousands upon thousands of perfectly decent, cost-effective wines to choose from, you would guess that an ambitious establishment like Flour+Water could muster a handful of reliable candidates as their basic by-the-glass plonk.\n\nThen there was the fresh-faced server, who when I asked, \"Hey, can you tell me what's special about your meats, I remember reading something somewhere?\" replied, \"I have no idea, I'm new!\"  Yes, the ignorant are good people too, no beef there.  But I can't fathom why a restaurant owner who cares about the quality of his flour, water, veggies, and meats would put someone out on the floor who doesn't have a clue about the establishment's raison d'etre.  Another server did, however, fill us in that the arrosto di maiale is a special breed of half big, hairy wild boar, half domestic sow, if that is to be believed.  As we chewed on the sweet meat we felt mighty sorry for that sow.\n\nAre you a rich yuppie tourist desperately checking the top ten most-hyped SF eateries off your list?

They really should put SALT in their name \"Salt - (Flour + Water)\" or at least refer to Angelina Jolie. That and the pizza crust was black (not blackened, but carcinogenic style pure black). Prosciutto was overcooked so it tasted like bacon. Ravioli was too thick/meaty tasting while the sauce was too oily.

As a science teacher, the 100 ml beakers that were use with candles, brought a smile to my face right away.\n\nReservations are hard to come by (you'll need to reserve 5-6 weeks in advance), so we showed up about half hot before opening and we were able to get a seat the the high tops near the front. At first, I was not crazy about it, but we had some nice couples around us and it was fun to chit chat here and there.\n\nWe came  for the food and LOVED it.  The parsnip and nutmeg pur\u00e9e inside the tortellini was delicious. The margherita pizza was good and the salads are good too.\n\nOur waitress was friendly and very knowledgeable about the items on the men and the wine list.\n\nThe desert menu was awesome and they carry Humphrey Slocombe ice cream.\n\nLooking forward to going back with an advanced reservation.", "author": "saum z."}

No problem, we got there at 9 to catch a drink at the bar, the hostess said it would be easier to order from her so we got the drink list, however we weren't able to put in our order for about 20 minutes, we put in our order and asked how long it would be for our table, the hostess said it wouldn't be too long. We weren't seated until about 9:45.\n\nThe wine list is a little over priced given the wines, but we found a Barolo we wanted but they were out, so the server kindly suggested a Chianti that was 50% more expensive, when I described what we were looking for (Barolo, given the price point) he kept suggesting the same wine, much more expensive and not the right style. \n\nThe food was good - the pasta dishes we ordered stole the show, the beet ravioli especially. Others in my group really liked the halibut (which I did not eat) The pizza was lackluster at best, it was burned so there was a lot of charred flavor, the dough was soggy, the sauce was bland, overall just not good. Throughout the meal the server was a little rude, I asked for more water and it took him over 10 minutes to bring a bottle over, so I asked him again and he curtly replied that it was coming. That took another 10 minutes.\n\nIn the end this place did not live up to the hype, and beyond that just wasn't that great - especially given the prices this place was not worth it.", "author": "Mari J."}

When we mentioned this to our server she said, \"that's how we make the pizza's here.\" I'm not sure I've ever been to a place where they have pride in soggy pizza...what I can assume is that it was in the window for far too long which, in my experiences, is why pizza gets soggy. \n\n2.) The Calamari Salad was covered in a thick aoli (even though the Calamari was on top of it) and the only flavor I got was aoli and cucumber.\n\n3.) The server/chef was well aware of our dissatisfaction and did nothing to try to improve the experience...\n\n4.)

They let us sample a few wines before we decided on our bottle. 5 stars.\n\nAntipasti - we had the melon salad, and the veal.  Both were ok, nothing special. 3 stars.\n\nPizza - we had first the margherita - tomato, basil, fior di latte, extra virgin olive oil... Fantastic, 5 stars!  This was one of the best margherita's we have had.  In fact it was so good, we decided to give another pizza a shot.\n\nWe then ordered the  pancetta- shaved summer squash, nepitella, fior di latte & pancetta.  The pancetta and squash to my surprise went very well together and was another very good pizza. 4 stars.\n\nPasta - our pasta with squid was a bit too \"fishy\" for both of us, and she loves fish; the noodles were cooked nicely.  2 stars.\n\nDolce - We finished with the dessert you all need to get, the chocolate budino with espresso-caramel cream & sea salt... Loved it!  You need a sweet tooth to really enjoy this, and may be too sweet if you don't... however I definitely have a sweet tooth and could have ordered seconds and thirds if we didn't have to leave.  5 stars.\n\nWe enjoyed Flour + Water, were not impressed with the antipasti or pasta, loved the margherita, and chocolate budino.  \n\nIt's still one of the \"it\" places to go, as reservations are extremely difficult to come by, and usually made far in advance...

Some kinda pizza was shared by all as a starter.  The crust was crunchy, chewy and delicious. The cheese was creamy and a little on the pungent side..

The pasta was pretty good, although the edge of the dough [where the crimp os the raviolini is] was pretty darn tough.  I was hoping the savoy in the stuffing would have a little bite or substance to it but it was more like pureed pork mousse inside.  Ehhh...

I don't even eat duck but this has completely changed my mind.\nCocoa noodle w. Duck giblets: also, amazing. Highly recommended.\nSquid ink pasta: considering it came after the duck, it was an act too hard to follow, but had we started with a salad and fish I'm sure we would've loved it. The presentation was gorgeous.\nPork loin: so good.\n\nDessert:\nAgain, this is why I needed to write the review while at the restaurant, hopefully it'll come to me and I can revise, but it was comped, as well as the appetizers and like 5 other dishes we had and everything was amazing, start to finish. \n\nDrinks:  \nWine: Pinot was amazing\nRose champagne\nFinished with a macchiato that was so good I didn't sleep that night.\n \nAmbiance: really cute and cozy even on a rainy Tuesday night. \n\nCompletely in love with this place, oh and the music was so good too! lol.

Too uninspired to go anywhere else we decided to wait it out, but luckily you can drink wine outside their establishment so we chatted over a couple glasses of red on the bench. \n\nOur server was one of the most cheerful and polite servers I've ever had in my life.

Definitely fresh ingredients, and unique ingredients and that gets props.  The tuna app was tasty (strawberries, lemon tartness and tuna together...unique...not blow me away unique though but I appreciated the effort), the pasta dishes were really good (I had the clam), and the pizza was nice (side note: I don't take pizza advice from people in CA, they don't know crap about pizza.  The best you have here is Little Star, yet you rant and rave about Patxis.  Come on now.  This was just brick oven pizza, and if I was to put it side by side by other places like Beretta or Delfina you'd be hard pressed to find a difference.).  The pana cotta was eh...a bit too cottage cheese like in texture.  So all in all a nice dinner, but with the setup from paragraph 1, I don't want 'fine'...I wanted 'whoa.'  The hype exceeded the menu...sorry.  \n\nFor 3 glasses of wine, 1 app, 2 pastas, 1 pizza and 1 desert, total was $115...not bad.  Although i wasn't stuffed.  Honestly, Beretta and Delfina easily outshine this place by a longshot (the burrata pizza with fake sausage at Beretta is sick, I'm sure with real sausage it's also sick).

Even my very hungry husband agreed on this one.\n\nWe had dinner at Flour + Water two weeks ago with a group of three friends.  I mention the number in our party because if you've read anything about this restaurant, you know that it's nearly impossible to get in period, much less in groups.  The trick, you see, is that you put your name in, and then walk down the street to Shotwell to shoot the breeze for an hour or two.  My friend put her name in at 5:30 on a Friday night, and we were seated right around 7:30.  Once inside, it's apparent why we experienced a two hour wait. The space is small, and the eaters are happy. And happy, wine-drinking eaters might take two hours for a meal.\n\nMy husband posed this extremely useful restaurant query of the server: if I'm only going to eat here once in my life, what should I have? The salsiccia pizza, she said, or the farro farfalle with sweetbreads. So I ordered the former, and he got the latter. Worth. The. Wait. His pasta was exquisite, full of rich and delicate flavors, an entirely different experience than the sweetbreads we had at a top-notch DC restaurant last summer. My pizza was fantastic - thin crust, flavorful sausage, and a curious and pungent drizzle of anchovies.\n\nOur friends tried items from the antipasti menu - a stuffed squid and some sort of vegetable stew - and the puttanesca, which smelled amazingly fishy, the sort of dish that is done best close to the sea. We shared a bottle of wine on the recommendation of our server - a blend of Sangiovese and Montepulciano - which worked well with everything and was reasonably priced, given the environs and the menu.  We probably could've finished a second bottle if we hadn't already had drinks at Shotwell's. Besides, there was the matter of dessert: a chocolate budino - halfway between pudding and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e - with a quenelle of Humphry Slocombe ice cream and a sprinkling of sea salt. So amazing.\n\nI can see why one would be turned off by the hype and the long wait.  And I can see why, if you've waited two hours, you might be disappointed by your portion size.  But here's the thing: this is not the sort of place where you pop in for a slice after work.  It's the sort of place for a long and lingering dinner, for catching up with old friends or celebrating an occasion.

Interesting I thought, probably just because they were unsure of what time it opened just like us. \n\nThe doors opened exactly at 5:30 and as the line quickly moved, we were greeted by two very friendly hostesses who told us that they had two seats available for us at a \"communal table\"...what? oh, a new Hipster word for a long cafeteria table with a bunch of strangers....ok sure we will take a seat. \n\nOnce seated, an extremely nice waitress came up and offered up complimentary sparkling water and some menus. For appetizer we ordered rabbit confit with sierra beauty apples, dante cheese, shaved fennel & mustard greens. The salad was great!!!! it was light flavorful and the rabbit was tender and cooked perfectly. All of the flavors complemented each other. The pizza came next. We got the funghi - roasted hen of the woods mushrooms, taleggio & rapini leaves. The pizza is large enough to share, 12\". The ingredients were fresh and you could taste each of them separately, yet together. We also shared a dessert, a chocolate budino with espresso-caramel cream & sea salt. The dessert was quite simple but yet very tasteful. Both the souffle and the cream were just the perfect amount of sweet and the sea salt definitely expanded the flavor..... \n\nI must say that we expected a hip, yet not so good place.

Surprisingly, we got seated within 10 minutes. I guess we were lucky that a table had just left, and all they had to do was clean up and then seat us.\n\nFlour + water has been getting a ton of buzz since it has opened and so I have been curious to try it for awhile. When I was trying to explain to my boyfriend about what sort of restaurant to expect, I described, \"It's probably going to be a pretentious pizza place where you can expect to get a farm egg on top of your pizza.\" Lo and behold, as soon as I got there, I looked at the menu, and there is indeed an option to get a farm egg on top of your pizza ($1).\n\nFlour + water is a pretty pretentious pizza place, but it has good food, and it's not afraid to take risks, which I admire. I decided to try the osso pizza, my friend got the pasta with braised pork shoulder, and my boyfriend got the pork tenderloin. In the end, we all split the bonet dessert.\n\nI'm just going to say it right now: I've eaten at my fair share of pretentious places with puffed-up pastry people, but the bonet dessert was honestly one of the best desserts I have had in a LONG time. It was--do I dare say it?--perfect. This dessert elevated an otherwise 3 star review to a 4 star review. If the rest of the food had been this good, flour + water would have been five stars. The bonet was essentially a creme brulee with tangerines at the top and the bottom, and an almond crumble sprinkled on top, but it was just so well-balanced and delicious. It was sweet! Creamy! Savory! Juicy! Tangy! Nutty! Crunchy! Soft! It was every type of texture and flavor melding together to create a delightful, harmonious experience.\n\nYes, I am drooling just over the thought of this dessert. So freaking amazing.\n\nThe rest of the food was okay to good.\n\nOsso pizza: bone marrow, fontina, and horseradish? Okay. It was interesting, but I have not been converted to a horseradish-on-pizza fan. The bone marrow was okay. I'm guessing that the bone marrow was supposed to impart a beefy flavor on the pizza dough, but it really just tasted like melted fat and salt. Not necessarily bad, but not great. I liked the thick slices of fontina, but I don't think they added very much in terms of flavor. The horseradish was kind of bitter, a little spicy. Not unpleasant, but not great.\n\nPasta with braised pork shoulder: I only had a bite of this dish, but it was my favorite entree of the night. Tender pork shoulder and a richly savory dish. Portion size is a little small, but I think the richness in flavor makes up for it.\n\nPork tenderloin: Every bite was full of flavor, but the meat itself was very, very tough. It required a lot of chewing. The boyfriend enjoyed it though. \n\nI would come back just for that amazing dessert.", "author": "Wendy S."}

There were two types of strawberries - your normal red strawberries, and these white colored strawberries that had a firm texture and a vinegary taste.\n2) Squid ink tortellini di mare en brodo with peas - Tasted alright.  Interesting to see the tortellini's black.  The broth tasted like chicken broth to me.\n3) Rigatoni with braised pork shoulder, green garlic & capers - Best dish of the night!  The pork was very tender, almost like a stew and the pasta tasted very fresh.\n4) Cappellacci dei briganti with smoked hen, pancetta, arugula & chili - Tasted alright, a little salty for me and you could taste a hint of the chili.\n5) Biancoverde pizza - squash blossoms, lemon zest, marjoram & prosciutto - First time having lemon in my pizza, but is was surprisingly good.\n\nI always look forward to eating here, I just wish the wait wasn't so long.

I will start by saying that their pizza is simply amazing, and their crust is the closest thing I've found to the pizza I had in Napoli, Italy many years back.  The dough gets this amazing \"chewiness\" that you think about for the next week because it's so delicious. \n\nThat being said... the portion size of our pappardelle was very meager... barely enough for one person (I've frequented my share of restaurants in my time, and have an idea of what proper portioning should be).  If I'm paying $15 for a plate of pasta, I want to leave feeling full and satisfied.  AND... the place is run by hipsters, which by itself is a slight but tolerable annoyance, but the fact is that they seem to run it like a bunch of slacker hipsters as well.  At the end of the meal, we still could not tell you who our server was, and weren't sure exactly who we were tipping!  I don't know if they have some kind of communal tipping scheme of not, but whatever system they seem to use puts too many \"hands in the pot\" in regards to table service - because no one seems fully responsible for your table, orders come out slow, requests for water/etc are forgotten about, and so on.  This should be addressed.\n\nAnyway, get rid of the hipsters and reasonably increase portion size on pastas, and you'd get 5 starts from me easy!

We ordered 2 pasta dishes: the squid ink spaghetti and the garganelli with pork sausage. Both were SOO good... We slurped up every morsel of pasta and sauce! Huge critique here though: portion was WAY too small for what they're charging. And it didn't help that the small portioned pasta was drowned in a gigantic bowl... \n\nWe also ordered the margherita pizza with arugula and anchovies added on. Here's where they went terribly wrong: 1) The crust itself was not crusty. What a shame! Being that it was our first time there, I am not sure whether we just got an unfortunately bad pizza or if the pizzas always came out that way! It was as if they took the pizza out and let it sit and steam, because the crust and dough was chewy- and not it a good way. The crust looked beautifully charred and we expected an awesome crunch when we took the first bite... Definitely a letdown... 2) Their menu was a bit misleading for the add-ons pricing. They had the arugula and anchovies grouped together next to the price, which made us think that it came together. We didn't mind paying the extra $2 but it was still misleading and annoying. They should have LISTED the add ons with the price next to each ingredient. Maybe this is minor for some people, but one of my biggest pet peeves is misleading menus. \n\nAll in all, the pastas were awesome... I might come back for the pasta tasting.

I loved the simpleness of it, but watch out for the one, maybe two spicy peppers in the bowl.\n\nfunghi pizza - oven-roasted chanterelle & hen of the woods mushrooms, fontina, lamb's quarters & nepitella\nThe crust was crisp and soft in all the right places. Chanterelles.... need I say more? We did get the egg added to this. I love poached eggs or really just eggs that have the runny yolk and this was the perfect addition to the pizza\n\nsquid ink corzetti stampati with local squid, mussels & clams, baby fennel, calabrian chilis & spigarello\nThis dish was one of my favorites. The mussels and clams were a nice addition and it had just enough heat to it. The fresh pasta was cooked perfectly. \n\nporcini maltagliati with braised giblets, fresh prunes & summer savory\nOf all the dishes this one surprised me the most. It was so complex yet so simple. The heartiness of the giblets (I also think there was liver in there as well?) along with the sweet prunes that melted in your mouth made it to be such a lovely well rounded pasta dish. \n\ntaggiasca olive pappardelle with duck rag\u00fa & chanterelles\nOlives, duck, chanterelles with fresh pasta. Again, I don't think I need to say more\n\nroasted rabbit loin with broccoli di ciccio, turnips & carrots agrodolce & pancetta savory relish\nA really nice dish. Out of all of them, sadly this would be my least favorite. Only because I felt that the veg out shined the rabbit. Loved the crispy broccoli, radishes, and carrots though. \n\nDrinks included-\n\n2008 Weingut Niklas, Sudtiroler Lagrein DOC, Alto Adige\nA beautiful red, low acid with nice blackberry and pepper notes. My favorite of all the wines. \n\n2007 Villabella, Bardolino Superiore DOCG, Terre di Cavagion, Veneto\n\n2008 Bellanotte, Friulano & Malvasia, Armonico, Friuli\n\nLost Abby Devotion\n\nMirror Pound Pale Ale\n\nDesert included-\n\n2009 La Montecchia, Colli Euganei DOC Moscato Fior d'Arancio, Veneto\nI love Moscatos and this was a fizzy, orange, sweet perfection \n\nsm french press\nAs somewhat of a coffee snob, I love ordering french presses when I go out because you a) ensure that you are served the freshest cup of coffee and because b) french presses allow you to really taste and enjoy all the oily goodness and flavor notes of the bean without any papery taste like with filtered dripped coffee. BTW this is amazing if you order the Budino with its espresso-caramel cream.\n\nwarm polenta cake with blueberries, corn ice cream* & basil\nI will have loving dreams of this for awhile. The corn ice cream with the basil and blueberries are a surprising and yet comforting combination. With the addition of the polenta cake in the warm delicious goodness creates for me the perfect ending to the meal. \n\nchocolate budino with espresso-caramel cream & sea salt\nThe rich chocolate is really nice with the french press coffee. I love the combination of chocolate, salt, and caramel and the espresso was a nice twist to it. \n\nchilled prosecco melon soup with olive oil ice cream\nCold fruit soups are usually always a winner but the addition of the olive oil ice cream was especially nice. I believe there was a chiffonade of basil (or another green leafy herb) which gave it a nice balance. From what I understand Flour + Water works with small local farmers for their produce and local melons in the soup all worked together quite nicely. \n\nSo overall a great meal. Great service from Kevin and all the other servers! I never had an empty glass, food arrived within 10 minutes after ordering, and the flow of the meal was perfect. \n\nSo lets recap:\nGreat food\nGreat service\nIf you don't like waiting- here is a thought, get a reservation. \n\nTill we meet again flour + water", "author": "Monique F."}

Flour + Water exceeded all the hype and you know what,im just going to say it, better than French Laundry. Thats right. At first i was a little hesitant sinc ei showed up with Adrienne and Jovanie for a 545 reservation and was greeted by the hostess who was wearing an oversized plaid shirt, daisy duke jean shorts over black legging, oversized glasses and a barette dangling from her hair,but she couldnt have been nicer. \nwe were seated right away and our waitress then escorted us through an amazing night. we started with the green garlic sformato with whey, barley & peppercress, and the local halibut crudo with green & ripe strawberries, fava beans & wild arugula. Adrienne and Jovanie LOVED the halibut.I liked the sformato. it was my least favorite thing i ate but it was still good. Next up we got a pasta dish for free because we got one we hadnt ordered.YAY! The cow's milk ricotta triangoli with pea, asparagus & tarragon was THE BOMB and we didnt even order it. I got the nettle cappellacci dei briganti with boar sugo, carrot & pine nut.It was delicious but still not my favorite. Jovanies farro garganelli with braised pork shoulder & fennel was the star of the night. i could have ate three plates of that. Adrienne got the slow roasted pork & cabbage raviolini with mustard greens & horseradish,which was our least favorite but still delicious. Then we moved on to pizzas.Yes,by now youre thinking i am a total overeating whore, and youd be right. it took us three months to get a reservation and i wasnt going to wait another three months so i was ordering EVERYTHING! We got three of the 4 pizzas: \nboartadella- pea tendrils, spring shallots, pecorino & fresh horseradish,   \nsalsiccia- taggiasca olive, tomato, oregano, smoked mozzarella & chili ,    fungi- black trumpet & hen of the woods mushrooms, ramp, melted leeks & fontina\nMy favorite was the fungi. the fontina just RIPPED AZZ!! in a good way.\nThe salsiccia was great and spicy. The boartadella i tried and it was good, but im not the biggest horseradish fan. I forgot to mention we got the wood oven roasted asparagus with preserved meyer lemon & chili. Jovanie and Adrienne loved it. Im not eating asparagus normally but I tried it and it was delicious.\nThen,oh yeah,theres more. Desert.\nwe got chocolate budino with 8 espresso-caramel cream & sea salt\nwarm polenta cake with blood orange & 8 honey thyme ice cream\nand some kind of pistachio panna cotta.\nI loved my budino and the polenta cake was heavenly. The panna cotta was green but it had some kind of geranium notes......yeah,i know how pretentious i just sounded there,but its true.\nI tried going to humphrey slocombe after but i was so full that instead i staggered to BART and went home thinking that i had the dinner of 2011.", "author": "Jim M."}

I went there this month for a co-worker's birthday dinner making the reservations two months in advance and was not super impressed. The thin crust pizza was soggy in the middle and BURNED on the crust. My colleague's pasta dish was unacceptably salty. I wanted to send it back but she was much too polite to do that. I paid $28 for a small piece of salmon that was supposed to come with seasonal vegetables that only included two pieces of overly done carrots and a watery leaf of lettuce. The desserts may have been better but they had ran out of what I wanted to order by 6:45 PM. The espresso caramel and sea salt dish was interesting to taste. It seems that the clientele is Zynga and Twitter employee that just moved to SF and want to experience the latest trendiest happening in town.

I kept thinking that Beretta and Pizzaiolo, which have similar menus, are a million times better. i'm really glad we had reservations, because if we'd waited in line, I would have been upset about it. As it was, I was just a little disappointed. \n\nI was there with a group of 5 and we ate family style, so we were able to sample quite a few dishes (2 antipasti, 1 contorni, 3 pastas, 1 pizza, and 2 desserts). The only thing that was really excellent was the tagliette with mushrooms. It was so good, we almost got a second order instead of one of the desserts. \n\nEverything else was forgettable at best and the braised squid was actually not very good at all. We had the eggplant pizza and an eggplant pasta and it was hard to find the eggplant in both. We were excited about the pepper contorni with ricotta salata, but there wasn't nearly enough ricotta and the seasoning overall was pretty ho-hum. Melon salad was forgettable. \n\nI did enjoy the desserts, though - chocolate budino with sea salt and a polenta cake item with blueberries. \n\nBased on the buzz, I should probably give it another try, but with so  many excellent and similar alternatives (Boot and Shoe Service in Oakland also comes to mind), I don't know if I want to risk wasting another meal here.", "author": "Caitlin L."}

They have extra richness compared to other pastas (possibly due to more egg yolk in their recipes?).    All respectable pasta places in the city make fresh pasta, but these ones are thicker and richer, so I just slightly prefer the style here vs elsewhere. (SPQR also has similar pasta)\n\nI love the portions, and mix of fresh ingredients used, the ample use of \"exotic ingredients\" like offal.    \n\nThe antipastis are executed very well.  The salads, crudos, and other dishes in this section are always well thought out and executed.\n\nThe menu changes often, but in a great way.

But fortunately, this past Friday I decided to give it a try, and soon wished I had stopped listening to everyone a lot earlier.  \n\nFirstly, amazing decor. Really cozy. Let it be said that I was there at around 10, but still, it is a roomy spot and I bet it can accomodate crowds. \n\nSecondly, the service is fantastic. They are incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about the food. \n\nThridly, and is this really thirdly?, Man that pizza. Our server suggested we order the cipolla pizza with spring & torpedo onion, speck, green garlic & fior di latte. Not only was the 'green garlic pesto' heavenly, the thinnly sliced meat on top of it was was just divine. And the crust! It was a true thin crust with just the right amout of crispyness and doughy softness. Folding one slice together, all those amazing flavors combined and I was in heaven. \n\nWe also got the lamb tongue's salad, but I found it to be a little small. It was tasty, in a simplistic kind of way which I think the Chef's were going for. You could really taste the meat. \n\nAll and all, though, that pizza was incredible. I can't stop thinking about it.

It's not perfect, but it's pretty fantastic.  \n\nThe AMAZING:\n1) Ambiance \n-new age cabin/rustic/casual, loud music (beck, yeah yeahs yeahs etc.), wood beams, small candles in beakers everywhere\n\n2) Service \n-friendly, laid-back, not snotty/hipster\n\n3) PASTA\n-we ordered 4 of 5 pasta dishes and everything has a wonderful bite and flavour.  The pasta is truly OUTSTANDING and a star at this gem\n\nNOT SO amazing:\n1) The Wait\n- at least an hour and can be agonizingly long, but it still can be a good time if you just snack before and have drinks while you wait.  Yes, they do take reservations, but it is very limited and last I looked, to get a decent time or even an opening, you're looking at making reservations 2 months in advance.  \n\n2) Desserts\n-they were meh, very run of the mill boring with things such as panna cotta, budino, polenta cake.  I'm assuming there's no pastry chef, so they keep it simple and executable for a savoury chef, but the desserts also lack finesse (e.g., bubbles in the cream, really bitter blood orange sauce etc., chocolate tastes very one dimensional)\n\nOverall: GO FOR THE PASTA.  If the ambiance is in line with what you like, it's great for a date or catch-up with a friend.  My only advice is to not go with a party greater than 4.  The space is small and trying to get seated for a much larger party may entail a much longer and frustrating wait.", "author": "Miss H."}

We went on a Thursday night around 10pm and the place was packed. But we were relatively quickly seated at the communal table, which was sort of fun.\n\nThe ambiance is lovely, and we started the night with the warm potato and lamb's tongue antipasti. The dish was beautiful. The egg on top was poached perfectly and meshed well with the tender lamb's tongue and the addictive potatoes. The salsa verde was bright and acidic in flavor and went well with the entire dish.\n\nHowever the evening started to go down hill from there.  We got the osso pizza (bone marrow, fontina, rabe leaves & fresh horseradish. I was very excited about trying the pizza here after my slightly disappointing experience at Pizzaria Delfina. But I was sorely let down once again. The crust was okay, slightly burned... the dough wasn't that flavorful and didn't have the right chew.  But my biggest complaint and what really ruined the pizza was how greasy the pie was. Even my dining partner who loves fast food thought the thing was greasy....never a good sign. There was a layer of oil left in the pan that the pizza was served in, and I found the experience of eating the pizza slightly nauseating due to the oil, which is a pity because the ingredients on top meshed well with each other.\n\nWe ended the meal with parsley tagliatelle with braised hen and black trumpet mushroom. The mushrooms were heaven. The braised hen was very tender though slightly under-seasoned and bland. The tagliatelle was a revelation....you can taste the freshness of the homemade pasta, and it was cooked a perfect al dente. I would've given this dish high marks, except again the entire thing was drenched in oil...making the dish a lot less palatable.\n\nSo final opinion is that while the home-made pasta is amazing at flour+water, everything is way too greasy and the pizza is a disappointment.", "author": "Cindy C."}

Right here folks.\n\nResting on my list for over 7 months, the buzz heavy Flour + Water is a remarkable dining experience.\n\nOn a wet Thursday evening, we made our way into this charming venue off the beaten path. What appears to be a simple interior is truly an intellectual guide to the meticulously crafted food that combines the best of San Francisco effortlessly. \n\nHalf of the tables are reserved for walk ins, and despite the dark weather, the place was still packed. The host was incredibly warm, marked us down, and made sure that we were taken care of as we waited.\n\nAs a man of little patience, the wait here was actually quite enjoyable. It was a culinary fireworks show, as plate after plate exploded out of the kitchen with an aroma that kicked your knees like your first kiss. The anticipation of getting seated reminded you that you were in for something special.\n\nOnce seated, we browsed through the brown paper menu, and found each item dripping with confidence. The roundup:\n\nAntipasti: smoked strugeon with herb aioli, caper berry, pickled fennel, sunchoke & ruby crescent chips\n\n\"Light, a bit heavy on salt, but had great texture with the ruby crescent chips.

Each bite was perfection.\"\n\nPasta: sage tagliatelle braised duck with & roasted squash\n\n\"The hands down winner of the night. I could write for days, but could never describe the overwhelming buttery sauce that coated each layer of pasta with detail. Soft and full of flavor, the braised duck, hidden underneath the mound of pasta was a knockout.\"\n\nThe pasta was reminiscent of my visit to Quince, and was some of the best I've ever had in San Francisco.\n\nOne of the details I loved was that the servers were able to wear whatever they pleased, and weren't trapped into a starchy white shirt with black pants. It felt as if you were being served by a good friend, who genuinely wanted you to be there. I tell ya' it's the smallest of things...\n\nAs we came here for a special Birthday, we ended the evening with the chocolate budino with espresso-caramel cream & sea salt complete with a candle. Decadent, and not too heavy, the espresso-caramel cream finished the meal on a high note.\n\nFlour + Water, you guys have something great here, and I will be back for decades.

Italian sounded good though, media gulch is only a 15 minute drive, and hallelujah Water + Flour is open until midnight every night, praise god!\n\nYes its mission hipster - if that is a problem for you then piss off.  The young lady running the front was warm and kind, with a giant bow in her hair and big phat tats on her arms...striking in all the right ways.  The place was 3/4 full late Sunday night - always a good sign.  I sat at the counter, and as a rule I like to ask the bartender what I should drink...if they have an opinion I know all is well.  the bartender was a very opinionated  young Asian girl (I will hazard a guess at Korean) and she steered me towards champagne.  It was Sunday, and as I had been stood up for church in the morning I figured I needed some sacramental grapes, and the Vittoria Brut Rose was up to the task.\n\nThe menu is intriguing, and that is good.

Great color, great nose. great flavor, why has it taken me a year to get my lazy ass here???\n\nI am grateful to god on high that more and more places exist in the City today open late for weirdos like me who prefer to haunt the neighborhoods close to midnight.

I want to grow up all big and strong and when I'm ready, I want to be caught, packed in ice and flown to San Francisco. I want the chefs at flour+water to cut out my smile and tenderly serve it with marinated artichokes, watercress and capers. Hold the onions.\n\nSquid Ink Corzetti stampati:\nI'm from New York. If you're going to call yourself \"flour and water,\" I'm going to hold you to a different standard. The handmade corzetti stampati exceeded every expectation. Served with squid and fava beans, it was an exceptional first impression to the rest of the menu.\n\nI believe you can tell a lot about an Italian restaurant from its gnocchi. So I'm reserving judgment until I see it on the menu. But hands down, this is the best pasta I've had outside Lupa or Babbo. Yeah, I said it.", "author": "Joaquin R."}

I had the pork brisket pasta, which was made in brisket sauce, a pleasant change from Alfredo, which I can't have, and seafood sauces, which I can't stand.  All I had to tell the waitress was to disappear the cheese, and a perfect (if small) steaming plate of pasta with brisket magically appeared in front of me.  I would have tried the pasta my friends ordered, but, nope, they cheesed it.  Eew.  \n\nWhile the pasta was still in the process of being materialized, we kept asking for bread.  You see, asking just once, gets you a tiny slice per person, so we had to keep doing it, over, and over, and over again.  The bread itself was not bad, if a tad bit stale (but this was at 10pm+, after all), but man oh man, I wish they had just brought us a loaf and been done with it.  \n\nFinally, I ordered the peach and berry ice cream thingamabob, which came with Humphry Slocombe's Tahitian Vanilla, which was as good as ever.  $8 for the tiny desert may have been a tad bit much though.  The waitress made pleasant small talk, and smiled indulgently as I mock flirted with Ian H, telling him he can have some of my gooey ice cream desert like a proper date.  She also indulgently brought us out the $140 bill for four, which, considering we had only two glasses of wine (total), no one was particularly full after, and the food was good, but not amazing, was perhaps too much.", "author": "Leon K."}

I wish their restroom was in my house. The staff is genuinely friendly and helpful.  Our waitress Sam was so sweet and kind.  My friend and I even grabbed a waitress that wasn't our server to explain some of the types of pasta on our menu and she spent time answering all our questions even though we weren't one of her tables.  \n\nThe food was great!  There were a couple dishes that weren't a ten, but there wasn't a single dish I didn't enjoy.\n\nTHE BEST!!!:\n\nPork & rabbit terrina with apple & pear mostarda, arugula, pistachios & gnocco fritto - Served cold this dish is a great mix of salty port & rabbit with sweet, acidic pear and apple.  The pitachios and fritto add a nice crunchy component on top of the chewy mix.\n\nOsso pizza: bone marrow, rapini, fontina & horseradish - I never had bone marrow before last night and I'm sad I've been missing out all these years.  This pizza was freaking amazing and I will order it the next time I come back.\n\nChocolate budino with espresso-caramel cream & sea salt - I almost cried when I ate this dessert.  It's more of a ganache then a pudding, but the thick consistency was creamy and wonderful.  The sea salt and expresso-caramel cream put this over the top and made this one of the best desserts I've ever had.\n\nSTILL REALLY GOOD, BUT NOT AMAZING:\n\nBonet with barbera pear compote & amaretti crumble -This dessert is like a caramel custard or flan.  It's very refreshing and tasty.  Sadly, when ordered with the chocolate budino it just doesn't compare.\n\nMint chitarra with dungeness crab, romanesco & chili - A great pasta.  Complex with layers of flavor. Salty and buttery with a little mint, then heat to finish.\n \nCavolfiore pizza: cauliflower, prosciutto, taggiasca olives & caramelized onion - The pizza was good, but a little too salty for me.  There needed to be more sweet onions to balance out the olives and prosciutto. Still really good though.\n\nJUST OKAY:\n\nMargherita pizza - tomato, basil, fior di latte, extra:  This pizza is forgettable.  The crust is great, but nothing stood out about this pizza.

I had Margarita Pizza - my fave!  And it did not disappoint .  My dinning parter had a duck ravioli that was amazing!!  \n\nSecond, service of the wait staff, it was good, not great but not slow or anything either\n\nWhich brings me to the third thing - the hostess staff - first of all it looked like there were 3 hostesses ... um... the place isn't that big - not quite sure why they need 3??  But ok - what ever.  So I popped in on our way to Humphry Slocombe (we went for dessert first - it would have been closed by the time we were done with dinner)  and put my name in - was told there would be around a 40 min wait.  Ok - plenty of time to get ice cream and walk back.  We got back and were told we were the first 2 top on the list.  Ok Cool!  so when we saw a table of 2 get up we thought - great!  We will be seated shortly.  So we waited... and waited... and waited...........\n\nUgh!!!  That table was empty for 40 min!!!!  Really? 40 min??  If I were that waitress with an empty table for 40 min I wouldn't be too happy!  So I went and asked how much longer - it had been well over an hour and 15 min so far .... my feet were starting to hurt!  I was told that they were waiting for a reservation for that table - really?  it's been empty for over 40 min .  There must have been 4 other 2 tops waiting!  So we wait some more........  tick tock tick tock - seriously contemplated In N Out at this point!!  \n\n15 min AFTER I asked the hostess about the time there became some open table room at a community table ...hmmmm... wonder if they are going to sit us there - or at the table?  So .... one 2 top gets seated (Hmmm... they must have had a reservation - but why did they not get the table instead of the community table??)  Then another 2 top get seated...okayyyyy... then finally us!  At the community table.  So - wondering - who got the table??  OH!!!!  One of the staff's friends!! Ah I see!  It's not how long you wait - It's who you know!!!  I saw these guys come in and they too were complaining about the wait - so I know they didn't have a reservation.  So as you can tell - this was a bit much for me - I mean really??  A table empty for over 40 min!!

I made the reservations so far in advance it was ridiculous and the only spot they had was for an early bird seating at 5:45pm (they open at 5:30).  I got a confirmation call at 1:30 pm the same day (aren't they supposed to call the day before? but I digress).  Everyone was literally rushing home from work to try and make it on time.  I arrived on time but my friends ran 15 minutes late and even though our table was already set and the restaurant was fairly empty they said their policy was not to seat us until the whole party had arrived.  Slightly annoying but Whatever.  \n\nIt was difficult not to have high expectations for the food and although it was a terrific meal it did not blow me away..hence my 3 and not 4 stars.  I must give props for the service, the wait staff was friendly, knowledgeable and service was speedy.  \n\nWe ordered family style (as suggested) and ate the following:\n \nSalumi della casa: really tiny bits of meat and cheese which was pretty good but not great for sharing as the portions were pretty small \n\nRadicchio salad: nice bitter greens with large bits of cheese and the best fried anchovy I've ever had - would definitely order this again\n\nSalciccia pizza: This is what I came for and it was pretty darn good.  The crust was light and airy and the bottom just blackened enough to give it flavor.  (The pizza at Delfina is better IMHO)\n\nBiancoverde pizza: Also pretty good but it wasn't crisp enough for me and once it got cold it lost it's flavor.  \n\nArtichoke & ricotta triangoli: very delicious and light little bites of pasta, lemony and fresh.  Probably better than the salumi as a starter.  \n\nSea bass: nice big piece of fish, cooked well (good crust) and served with flavorful beans\n\nSeared chicken:  I actually didn't get to try this but everyone said it was good\n\nChocolate budino: this was really yummy, bursting with chocolate, espresso, caramel and sea salt - the flavors were excellent and we should have ordered two! \n\nFennel ice cream: the ice cream (from Humphry Slocombe) was pretty tasty but the candied fennel and accompanying accoutrements were not.  \n\nOverall I do think it's a bit over hyped and I would not wait a month to get another reservation...but I would go back.

I'm not saying the food wasn't great--it was--but if I'd waited 2 hours to get in I might have been a little disappointed. I've waited an hour or more outside Grimaldi's in Brooklyn a few times and I've never walked out anything less than satisfied.\n\nThis is based off a 10:15PM reservation and my friend and I only shared a pizza and a pasta dish (with dessert) so I can't speak for much of the menu. The service was fantastic, the hostess was super charming and the servers were genuinely friendly and helpful. I loved the space and thought it was beautifully laid out and just the right balance of rustic and chic.\n\nWe ordered squid ink chitarra with mussels & clams, baby fennel & calabrian chilies. The pasta was cooked so beautifully, I could have eaten a metric ton of it. Perfectly chewy and the squid ink lent a lovely depth to it. The mussels and clams were very flavorful and there was just the right touch of fennel (I hate overpowering fennel). My only complaint is that it was a bit oversalted and the clams a little chewy. But that's really being nitpicky, it was a very tasty dish.\n\nWe also had the funghi pizza and it was delicious--taleggio is one of my favorite cheeses and you really can't go wrong with plenty of chanterelles and hen of the woods. I've never had lamb's quarters and was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful and nicely balanced it was all crispy against the strong runny taleggio. The much-ballyhooed crust was very nice and I may just be spoiled but I liked Zero Zero's better. I love me some char but this might have gotten a bit out of hand, my mouth was lined by ash for a few bites there. Again, I'm only being hard on it because of the hype, had I walked into some random spot and gotten this food I would have been floored.\n\nThe warm apple crostata with golden raisins and Humphrey Slocombe Pistachio brittle ice cream was delightful.

We started with an Osso pizza, a pizza with bone marrow, horseradish, and kohlrabi.  It was awesome.  The crust was perfectly done, crisp, bubbly, and slightly charred, and the pizza was savory and good; the bit of bite from the horseradish was a nice touch.\n\nWe then ordered 2 pasta dishes, a seafood agnolotti and a chestnut maltagliati with pork.  Both were excellent.  The seafood agnolotti was in a fennel-lemon sauce and was very fresh and light; the maltagliati were more savory, with deeper flavors.  In both dishes the pasta was clearly freshly made and cooked al dente.  Perfect.\n\nFinally, dessert, and boy was that the kicker.  That chocolate budoni, a chocolate pudding with caramel dusted with sea salt and espresso cream, was something else.  The chocolate was deep and dark, the salt was granular enough to add a crackly texture to it.  We also got the blood orange polenta dessert, which came with clove-flavored cream, something we'd never seen before but which was absolutely mind-blowing.\n\nUpon returning home, we immediately logged on to OpenTable and tried to make another reservation at Flour + Water.

For divey, hipster beer and high ball drinks (and peanuts and pickles) go to Homestead. Am I forgetting anything? Is Shotwell right there too? I can't remember. We went to Trick Dog, had a couple weird cocktails, and got a text message after an hour and twenty minutes (we'd been quoted 1 1/2 - 2 hrs). It took us about four minutes to walk the two blocks back to the restaurant. Easy!\n\nOnce we were seated, the service was attentive and prompt. We ordered a bottle of wine recommended by the server (the wine list looked like gibberish with only Italian wines we'd never heard of), an appetizer, and four entrees to share among the four of us. \n\n- Deviled eggs - Delicious but I wish our server had told us there'd only be three for the four of us to awkwardly cut apart!\n- Ravioli with lamb, peas, and a mint sauce - Good but not our favorite. Our server recommended it, and I'm sure it's something people love when they have pasta all the time and are looking for something different. We just wanted regular old pasta, and this didn't satisfy that craving. \n- Tagliatelle with rabbit - AMAZING. I can't wait to go back just to eat that again. \n- Pizza with ricotta and green stuff - Tasty. \n- Pizza with squid and arugula - Not AS tasty but still good. A little too fishy was our verdict. \n\nOverall, everything was good, but it was really the tagliatelle that did it for me. It was a great atmosphere and experience as a whole, and I really look forward to going back. And with dessert and espressos after our meal, the bill came out to $50 each including tip!

I guess that would've been fine, except I'm a pescatarian.

I forget which kind but in this sitting, there are 2 glasses ordered for me.\n\nAntipasti: Local dungeness crab with avocado, citrus & marinated beets. My favorite dish. Everything about this dish is just right. We were going to order the sweetbreads but yea, there's meat in that dish. No vegetarian-friendly antipasti. \n\nPizza: tomato, basil, fior di latte, extra virgin olive oil. It's ok. Gets soggy from the tomatoes. I kid you not, this is the one of two vegetarian-friendly dishes in the whole menu (minus dessert)...unless I am missing something here.\n\nPasta: Celery root tortelloni with extra vecchio balsamic. Fresh pasta, that's for sure but the dish is okay.\n\nSecondi: Seared striped bass with roasted cauliflower, brusssel sprouts & guanciale. Delish fish. You guys know how to pick 'em. Alright, female server. When I say that I want her to recommend dishes with no meat (fish is ok), it would've been nice to tell me that guanicale is an unsmoked Italian bacon prepared with pig's JOWLS or CHEEKS (!). Yea, that would've been pretty helpful. Thanks...a lot. I'm not going to be a pain in the ass and tell them to prepare me another dish without the meat on top. It just gets pushed aside and I try not to think about it too much. \n\nDolce: Pumpkin cake with brown butter ice cream, caramelized apple & mulled cider sauce. Good but not great.\n\nStaff: Most of them were quite attractive. You come here often? Oh right, you work here. Well, um...I'm sorry, I probably won't be seeing too much of you. \n\nAtmosphere/space: Cozy. Read: cozy. Thanks to their Italian 900 degree Valoriani oven. I felt absolutely comfortable in my tank top...and jeans (sorry, no nude show for you). One bathroom. While you sit on the john, you can see a nice big shelf/cabinet of underwater stuff. \n\nOverall, if you are a strict vegetarian, avoid this place at all costs. If you are a carnivore, jump right in.

So my husband and I rushed there at 5:30 trying to beat the crowd.  \n\nNow, don't get discouraged if it's 5:35 and there is a line out the door already.  flour + water is deceptively large.

Yes, you will hear every word from your neighbors, but the same applies when you dine in those aforementioned restaurants with the little tables.  \n\nAlso, they have a hook under the table to hang your purse.

I opted for the bardolino based on the wonderful fruit and moderate body, nothing too much for a pizza but would hold its own to tomatoes.  It was fabulous.  The nice bartender also offered me a taste of the Massa timorasso and it was fabulous, making me wish I hadn't been so quick.  While the bardolino was good, I really loved the timorasso and will definitely look for this next time.\n\nSo far so good.

I'm having a good time by now, the crowd's good for a Monday night and I've always liked this space, so I'm hoping the curse is off the place.\n\nMy pizza comes and what a disappointment.  The flavors were actually really good, but the crust was absolutely soggy and couldn't be eaten by hand.  No crispness, no crunch, no support - it was hugely disappointing.  This place is 2 blocks from my home, so I've wanted them to succeed to no end, and I'm Italian, so I've really wanted a good place to call mine.  Am I holding too high of expectations?  I thought maybe so.  But then I spoke to a friend of mine who voiced the same concerns over his pizza experience at Flour+Water, so I know it's at least just not me.  But finally, I went to Starbelly last night and had a pizza that set the standard:  crisp, crunchy, tasty but know's its role is to support the pizza as a whole, and I could actually eat every piece by hand.

Recommend that you add a farm egg (if you're into that ;)\n - Bologna pizza - added a farm egg, but still found the salumi to be too overpowering. For the rest of my slices, I took the salumi off and it made a huge difference. Much better! \n - Pork ravioli - Yikes, the pasta was too tough. Major miss. For a place that talks up its pasta so much I expected better.\n - Chocolate budino - yummy! Rich & decadent. \n - Pumpkin cake w/ ice cream & caramelized apples - Good light(ish) desert to end a meal.\n\nOverall, it's an OK place in a city full of excellent Italian restaurants.

I love Italian food and have been gratified to see the resurgence of great new Italian places in recent years, but my visit to F+W the other night left me with the very clear impression that the reason this place exists at the moment is to serve handmade pizza and pasta to everyone who has sort of heard the buzz about Delfina, Bar Bambino, Beretta, Perbacco, Farina (uff) etc but wants something new, a little bigger and a little cheaper. A little. It's like the outlet mall version of Cal-Ital. \n\nWhy is this place so popular? The used-to-be-edgy location -- but now across the street from oh-so-Burner, delicious, expensive Cafe Gratitude? The merger of Cal-Ital kitchen tricks + tattooed & face-pierced servers? The wine list that pulls out the latest and yet already tired \"heirloom\" varietals (Alglianico, et al)? Just enough fixie kids to make the Mercedes-driving visitors from across town _really_ feel like they're somewhere else, and vice versa? \n\nThe food sounded OK but tasted boring. Flavoring handmade pasta with added ingredients is unnecessary if the pasta itself is done right. We didn't try the pizza. I remember Chocolate Budino dessert, that was tasty. \n\nService worked fairly well, although we felt like we were being pressured into buying wine while we waited well past our seating time...

Having said that, both the hostess and our waiter were exceptionally nice.\n\nThe big disappointment, though, was the food.  Of the four dishes I had, three were horrendously over-seasoned (or \"over-flavored\", maybe?  You'll see what I mean).  I had two starters -- the sardine, and the roasted cauliflower.  Both were drowned in so much dressing that it was impossible to taste the underlying ingredients.  It was like eating two plates of lemons.  Now, I like lemons far more than the next person (as a kid I used to eat lemons like they were oranges), but that's not what I ordered, and certainly not what I'm paying $12 per dish for.  The sardine was particularly disappointing because I could tell that underneath all the acidity there would have been a really nice piece of fish, if I could only taste it.\n\nMy pasta was the only good dish I had -- squid-ink spaghetti with clams, which was excellent. \n\nFor dessert, we had the chocolate boudino, which was rich and delicious, but was topped with a ball of the strongest espresso ice-cream I've ever had -- so strong that it completely overpowered the chocolate (which is quite the feat, since, as I said, the boudino was very rich).  We ended up scraping off the ice-cream so that we could actually taste the chocolate.\n\nMy boyfriend loved his pork pasta, but other than the two pastas, this place was surprisingly bad, especially at $50 per person without wine.

It was nudged up against some old windowsills which served as a wall between dining room and bathroom/serving runway.  Old windowsills are OK, old windowsills that have dust bunnies and look like they've never been cleaned are not.  We were given a bottle of water with no glasses.  We ordered wine, aps and mains, and water glasses.  We received water glasses along with wine glasses and wine which was already open.  We were told the bartender opens the wine to check if it's good, no need for our opinion.  We were also told we were free to pour the wine ourselves which ended up being the same for the water.  According to my fiancee I did a fine job which accorded more than a 15% tip.\n\nI ordered chestnut tagliatelle to start which came out part warm, part room temp.  I try not to send back pasta since 9 times out of 10 I get the same plate with a microwave treatment, so I kept on with this plate.  It was decent, light, but temp was just off.  Forgot what my fiancee ordered, it was that forgetable.\n\nMy main was flounder on gigande beans which was over-peppered fish on some half-cooked, others fully-cooked beans and a limp broth.  My fiancee ordered veal tortellini of which there were about 8 tiny pieces in what seemed like the same limp broth.  Dessert was the budino which was way too thick for budino.  We got the check from the overly contrite waitress and made a b-line outta there.\n\nNext night we went to SPQR which was my first choice but was conned into F&W by favorable reviews and had an absolutely stellar meal in comparison.

Well prepared, distinctive in flavors and pasta that's fresh and almost \"alive.\"\n\nBut, I wanted to focus more on the service. Our dishes were great until the chitarra verde and the spigarello arrived. As I mentioned, the food was good, however, those dishes were just too citrusy/acidic to match with our wine and the antipasti that we just had. We slowly brave it, working through our poor choice (well...*my* poor choice as she gave me the reins to pick this time). \n\nAs we laugh, slightly humored and disappointed, Sam, our server comes by and seems to know that we're not enjoying it and offers to take away our plates and have us order something else. We decide on the tagliolini with tripe. After we order, she just mentioned it may take a moment, as they restart the line in the kitchen. I then look at my watch and notice that it's 12:20am....they technically closed 20 minutes ago! I was taken aback and slightly embarrassed that we had her go through that. But, Sam was so genuinely accommodating to insure our satisfaction, that I felt just a little less guilty. \n\nShortly after, our dish arrives. And, not wanting to hold back the staff anymore we ask the food runner if we can just go ahead and order dessert. She tells us to not worry about it and just take our time. \n\nAfter we're done with the tagliolini, Sam brings us the dessert menus and allows us to take our time to finally order the chocolate budino with espresso-caramel cream and sea salt. Oh what a rich and delicious way to end the night.\n\nI note every little step in this review to illustrate the extreme service and patience that Sam and the rest of the staff had with a closing time table that wasn't just in and out. They could've dropped hints, told us they were closing, told us the kitchen was closed, or asked us to order desserts ahead of time. None of that. They all were smiling and accommodating till they let us out of the locked and closed restaurant, and, they even offered to call us a cab (we drove, anyhow).\n\nSo on my scale:\n\nConcept - 5 stars\nFresh, classically made italian food. Mmmm...\n\nValue - 5 stars\nFor the concept and amount of food we had....I was very surprised at the bill. If this place wasn't so packed, I would probably eat here more often.\n\nExecution - 7 stars\nThe food is fantastic, as you've already read. But, the staff's willingness to go above and beyond gives them extra extra stars. That really made our night.\n\nBecause of the Yelp scale, I can only give them a total of 5 stars. They are truly fantastic here, and I don't think any scale can really measure how well they treated us.", "author": "Ellis A."}

This was a momentous occasion because it was the first time I had taken both kiddies on the train by myself since the baby was a tiny papoose in my Ergo carrier.  This used to be a biweekly experience with my older son but now, not so much.  Our old routine would start with a  ride on the bullet train (my kid has a four stop max), then a short ride with hubby to Pizzeria Delfina, followed by dessert at Bi-Rite ice cream.  On this excursion,  I decided to change it up and go to Flour+ Water instead.\n\nWe arrived at the restaurant shortly after it opened at 5:30 pm.  Although it was Monday, there were lots of people seated at the bar already and 2/3 of the restaurant was full.  We were seated right away at a table close to the kitchen so we could see what was going on inside the bustling kitchen.  They were really accommodating with the kids and the staff came by throughout the night to coo at the kids.\n\nThe menu looked very promising - like if Pizzeria Delfina and Delfina proper merged into one (i.e. great apps, pizzas, handmade pastas, and yummy seared proteins).  Unfortunately, it didn't deliver.\n\nWe ordered the tomato salad with fried stuffed squash blossoms; a Margherita pizza; a white pizza with chilies, anchovies, and squash blossoms; whole wheat pasta with pesto, potatoes, and green beans, and papparadelle with pork sugo.  None of the desserts appealed to us so we decided to hit Bi-Rite afterwards.\n\nThe tomato salad was awesome and definitely set the bar high.  But the rest of the items were hit or miss.  The Margherita pizza was a let down because the crust was soggy and the toppings slid off when we went to grab slices.  The white pizza was tasty because it had a crispy crust and a mild kick from the chilies.  The whole wheat pasta with pesto was fine but nothing special.  I was most disappointed with the papparadelle with pork because I expected it to be similar to my favorite dish at Delfina.  It was a far cry from that dish.  The pasta was undercooked and the sauce was oversalted.  Plus, the pork was tough and fatty (and not in a good way).  Ick.\n\nService was really friendly and efficient but we waited a long time between dishes.

We went on a Sunday night with no reservations and only had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. It's warm and inviting, and I instantly got the feeling that they don't take themselves too seriously when I heard The Smiths being played. The menu has it's pluses and minuses. The pluses is that it changes daily depending what is fresh, and there are many dishes that I've not seen before and wanted to try; the minus is that deciding what to eat was tough because I may not see it again the next time I come back!\n\nMy starter was oxtail & roasted bone marrow soup with borlotti bean & tuscan kale. It was perfect for a cold SF night. It was very flavorful with good texture. A soup like this could easily be too heavy, but this was well executed and balanced. Needless to say the highlight was the roasted bone marrow on a crusty piece of toasted bread...heaven!\n\nSince I enjoy offal (a foodie's badge of honor), and with the recommendation of the server, I had to try the fegato pizza, prosciutto braised chard with duck giblets & liver with shaved shallots & savory. I'm always looking for something different and this fit the bill. The richness of the giblets and liver were balanced against the chard and blistered crispy crust. The other dishes I wish I could have tried were the chestnut pappardelle with braised pork, sage & roasted chestnuts or the roasted pork belly with braised green cabbage, cipollini, roasted potato & pancetta vinaigarette.\n\nOn the food vs price scale, flour + water ranks very high with me and would gladly go back. If you're on a budget, the truly gourmet pizzas are priced in the teens and you may never utter the words CPK again.

The turnips and greens side was tasty, cooked pretty well.  \n\nThe saving grace was the pasta dish and desserts we ordered. The pappardelle with game bird was fantastic.  The noodles were cooked perfectly.  The taste of the game bird got me really excited for Thanksgiving.  But, this was the SMALLEST pasta dish I have seen served at a SF restaurant.  F&W, does it have to be that small?\n\nWe had a chocolate mousse type dessert with caramel cream and sea salt.  Yum.  And a stewed fruit with burnt sugar ice cream from Humphrey Slocumbe.  The cake and fruit were good.  \n\nI feel about the same about Humphrey Slocumbe and F&W.  They both have a saving grace, but I don't know why people stand in line to eat at either place, when they can stand in a line to eat at Gialina or Bi-Rite.  Coincidentally, Gialina serves Bi-Rite.  It's a better place.", "author": "Amy D."}

Wow.  I haven't been this disappointed in a restaurant in a long time.\n\nWhy, you ask?\n\nExample #1: the pork chop.  I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when this came to the table.  Maybe it's NOPA's or Blue Plate's fault for serving up lavish, hulking chops of the mighty pig.  Maybe the bar has been set too high.  But really, flour + water, you are going to serve me a 2-inch by 4-inch (if that) BONELESS rectangle of anemic-looking pork and call THAT your chop?!  Chef, what on earth compelled you to remove the bone - the overwhelming source of flavor and juiciness?!  Are you hoping I'll be distracted by the spoonful of over-sauteed spinach and scattering of flageolet beans that I could have made better at home, and not notice that I just paid $24 for six bites of wan meat?\n\nWell, you say.  That's your fault for ordering a main.  Everyone knows you're supposed to get pasta and pizza and a pasta and pizza place.\n\nExample #2: the pasta.  We ordered the corzetti stampati - about ten flavorless (Chef, have you heard of salting the pasta water?) disks of naked pasta, artfully arranged in a concentric circle, drizzled with a half-tablespoon of pesto, a few walnut pieces, and about four chopped green beans.  For $16.  Is this a joke?\n\nExample #3: the pizza.  We had the biancoverde.  Admittedly, the execution was perfect.  It would have been a great pizza, had it not been for the (unadvertised) preserved lemon oil coating the arugula that overwhelmed every other flavor and made the entire pizza taste one-dimensionally odd.  \n\nBut come on, you say - at least you were drinking some good wine, and how could dessert be bad?\n\nExample #4: the wine: derivative.  I tried three reds.  They all tasted like generic table wine.  Blah.\n\nExample #5: The dessert - rosemary panna cotta with blackberry compote.  This would have been delicious - excellent combination of flavors - had the panna cotta been set.\n\nSo there we go.  Two laughable dishes, one borderline, one almost-good.  Served by a waitress who barely seemed to know we existed.  \n\nI wish my experience had been better: I truly wanted to love this restaurant.  Unfortunately, the only way I can see myself returning is if a) I am not paying, b) I am not hungry, and c) I bring my own wine.  And where's the fun in that?", "author": "Melissa B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-10-18", "description": "It's tough to complain about the portion size when you order the tasting menu.  However, when they say tasting, they literally mean \"tasting\".  As other reviews say, the pastas were really phenomenal, though I suppose as to be expected on the tasting menu, the portions were so small you could count out the individual noodles on 2 hands, and that was a double portion (me and my friend both got the tasting menu)!  On the plus side, if you are into the whole \"low carbs\" thing, even with seven courses you still only got about 30 noodles total.  The names were all so complicated, and the pasts were types I had never heard of, though they were all cooked perfectly and the flavors of the different flours they were made with all stood out to really enhance each dish. The best of the pasta dishes had some kind of rabbit meatball that would have been great over a big bowl of spaghetti or fettuccine, but alas, it wasn't.\n\nHalfway through the tasting menu me and my friend realized we would still be hungry after finishing, so we ordered a pizza as well.  (Yes, the portions were that small).  The pizza was probably the best thing I had that night.  The sausage was spicy and sweet, and the caramelized onions really made everything pop.  The egg on top was an added bonus, and the crust was really great too, though a little soggy towards the center of the pie.  \n\nDessert was great, but again super small.  We had an olive oil and thyme cake, (actually half a slice) with fromage blanc and figs.  Very tasty and light for a piece of cake that was about the size of a silver dollar.  \n\nNeedless to say, I wouldn't call this place of culinary perfection.  The food was good and well executed but for the price, you shouldn't have to order an extra entree and then be surprised when that extra entree is better than the ENTIRE tasting menu.  The service was great and friendly, though a little casual for a place like this, IMO.  Our waiter used the word \"totes\" when I asked him a question about one of the items on the menu.  I totes use that word myself, but at a place with this reputation (and price point), it totes caught me off guard.\n\nGiven the ridiculous wait, I'm not chomping at the bit to get back here, though I would be interested in trying some more of their pizzas.", "author": "Adam E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-08-02", "description": "We went here at 10:45 pm on a Friday night (with a reservation) since apparently that's the only time you can get a table for dinner at this hotspot!  With a place this popular, we expected great things.  Sadly, not so.\n\nFirst, we didn't get seated until about 11:10.  A 25 minute wait with a reservation is pretty unacceptable in my book, especially that late at night.  We were getting so tired that we almost turned around and went home.  They did offer us water and a wine list, but I turned it down - it's a small, cramped space and felt too tight to have a glass of wine standing up.  When we were finally seated, the tomato and corn salad was brought over to us free of charge, which I think was a very appropriate way to deal with the delay.  It was, truly, delicious.  I'm from the midwest and long for the kind of fresh produce that you Californians get year-round.  Those tomatoes, oh lord, so delicious!\n\nWe also ordered the peach and pistachio salad, which I thought was delicious as well.  There were slivers of marvelous salty cheese on top, and the flavors were a perfect match.\n\nWhen we ordered our bottle of wine, the server presented us with an open bottle, and said that the bartender opens all bottles and sniffs the cork for us.  She put the bottle down on the table and said something like \"Here, everyone pours their own wine, nice and casual just like at home!\" and walked away.  We poured the wine for ourselves, smirking a little that she needed to explain and validate this service by saying \"nice and casual, just like at home!\"  I don't blame the server for this, but I do think that at restaurants with these prices, servers should pour the wine for you.  Isn't that kind of a basic restaurant expectation?\n\nI was really underwhelmed with my entree, which was so disappointing to me since it sounded so delicious.  I got the corzetti stampati with a pesto and summer beans (something like that).  The pasta was clearly fresh, and did have a marvelous texture.  Credit where it's due.  The pesto was tasty, and the beans had a nice crunch.  However - there was hardly any pesto on the plate.  I had to spread it so thin just to ensure that it touched every bite.  They were so conservative with it that far too many of my bites just tasted like pasta in oil.  I felt like I could not even really get the feel of the pesto because it was there in such a small amount.  The dish could have been improved so much if they were more liberal with the pesto.  Otherwise it was just nice pasta with a faint flavor that is vaguely reminiscent of pesto.  \n\nAlso, another service point - the server removed our knives and forks from our salad plates, taking the plates and leaving our used silverware for us to use again for the main course.  I know this happens in a lot of restaurants, but it never should - especially not a restaurant that prides itself on its fresh ingredients - how can you really taste something if your previous course is still lingering on your fork?  And who wants to put their silverware on the dirty table and then pick it up again to use?  Seriously, I expect that from a chain, not here.\n\nAnyway, some of my dining companions may have tacked on another star.  My boyfriend enjoyed his pasta with brown-butter giblet sauce (I know, right?  but it was very good).  Based on my experience alone though.....this is what they get.  Sorry - but way too much hype for not enough good things.\n\nHOWEVER - they serve food until midnight, which is apparently very rare in this city, so props to them for filling a niche that needed someone to step up....even though they don't fill it as well as they ought.", "author": "Meredith A."}

Rather than ordering the Margherita pizza, which everyone else was ordering, we opted for the Melanzana pizza, a spicy offering sprinkled with egg plant and chile. The pizza was fine, however, 40% or more of the crust was burned.  While the baking style is suppose to result in a charred crust, I was surprised that so much was burned.\n\nMy meal followed with the Maltagliati pasta, a acid reflex inducing dish that was swimming in grease. What should I have expected when the ingredients included \"giblet ragu\"? I paid for it later that night when the undigested pieces of giblet tried to make a run for it at 1:00 am. \n\nWe had also ordered a side dish of oven roasted beans, but never received them. As our dinner began to wind down, we decided not to ask the waitress for them, since our overall experience with the food we ordered was just, well, ok. When the check arrived, we pointed out that we had not received the beans and after checking with the kitchen, our waitress came back to apologize, blaming the kitchen on sending our order to another table.

Totally ok, although it was a shame that the bar gets taken up by diners so we left to have a drink elsewhere. \n\nService was efficient, but not particularly friendly.

I should have went to Zero Zero instead but you won't know till you try.\n\nWe got here at 5pm since many others on Yelp have advised us to get here early or you won't get a table.  When we got here, there were several groups ahead of us.  My gf got out and waited in line and luckily she did because the line got longer.  We waited half an hour and finally at 5:30 the doors opened and we were allowed to go in.  By the time they got to us, they didn't have anymore tables for two left and so we had to sit at the bar.  There were a limited amount of appetizers, pastas and pizzas on the menu.  We had the salmon crudo which was actually pretty good yet small.  We had two pastas, a pacherri with braised pork and a ravioli with pork heart.  The former was better but both were okay to decent, nothing that wowed me or made me say that this is the best pasta in the Bay Area.

There were generous pieces of sausage and olives but nothing stood out.  Dessert didn't entice us so we just skipped on it.\n\nService was decent, nothing great but not bad.  I thought dinner was a bit over priced.  For the two of us, it was $100 without dessert and one cocktail.  I don't mind spending $100 but for the food we got, I don't think it was worth it.", "author": "Pierre L."}

Our friend ordered the skate and raved how well it was cooked. \n\nThe only disappointment of the evening was a side of brussel sprouts.  Diners at the table felt it was too salty (unsure if it was the salt or capers). Our waitress quickly apologized and whisked it away.  Unfortunately it was the last portion of the evening so she couldn't replace it, but she handled the situation well.  \n\n The dessert menu was so original we couldn't say no. We had an amazing rosemary panna cotta with fig compote, a unique blend of savory and sweet.  The chocolate budino with espresso caramel ice cream and sea salt was super rich with an unusual texture (similar to Nutella).  The desserts were amply portioned and perfect to share.

It's very unassuming on the outside with just a small sign amidst a residential background (right across from Cafe Gratitude if you know where that is).  Inside has a wonderful home-y, laid back feeling to it.  Lots of natural wood and colors, it invokes a feeling of relaxation....a place to just chill with your friends with good food and good drinks.\n\nThe menu has a variety of salads, pizzas and main courses.  We opted for a corn salad with basil, aioli and stuffed squash.  It was refreshing and delicious.  They have a great selection of Italian wine as well.  It being a hot day, we opted for a glass of wine.  I tried the Trebbiano d'Abruzzo which was fruity and sweet without being overly sweet.  We moved on to the Prosecco (Sorelle Bronca) which was amazing!  We shared the Margherita Pizza (according to my friend, this is how you judge pizza....he was judging against A16) which was very good but I preferred the Melanzana (eggplant) pizza that had eggplant, capers, chili and olives.  It definitely had a kick to it!\n\nDespite being handed the wrong bill at first (be sure to always check!), the service was friendly and efficient.  I think this little place will do well (we got there around 6:30 and managed to be seated right away but I would suggest getting a reservation).

In addition, there was a lot of hype surrounding Flour + Water, so everyone was pretty psyched we managed to get a reservation that's NOT at 5PM or 10PM.  \n\nFortunately they significantly exceeded everyone's expectations - the pizza was great (we had margherita with extra egg on top), but the pasta was P H E N O M E N A L.  I know it's only pasta, and I know restaurants make insane margin on something that is made out of flour and water, but boy the pasta was good.  \n\nThere were six of us and the best way to enjoy Flour + Water is by sharing the meal family style.  We got to try almost every pasta dish on the menu - our favorite was the strozzapreti with braised pork, capers & horseradish, but the rest is pretty solid.  The farro radiatore with roasted hen tastes like fancy chicken soup and the cappellacci dei briganti with rabbit sausage was tasty (once I get over the guilt of consuming wabbit).  \n\nWe were stuffed at the end of the meal, but not stuffed enough to skip on desserts.  We went with the people's choice - chocolate budino with espresso caramel cream & sea salt - orgasmic.

Oh and did I mention, is anyone sorry? Can we buy you a drink/dessert/appetizer for your trouble? No! Which brings me to,\n\nManagement: Claims to know something about the restaurant biz yet they behave like the faucet of nonstop looky loo's will never stop and take the locals for granted.\nWorked in the biz many years; #1 rule, acknowledge, value and appreciate your customers, send a drink, appetizer, dessert, do the right thing!  And sorry, the fact that you're busy, overwhelmed, whatever is not an excuse! Shameful really, they should know better.\n\nOverall: Portions too small for the money, better experience, quality at Delfina or Beretta. Small portions, inconsistent quality from day to day. The last pasta entree we ordered, when it came we thought was an appetizer but the $18 price tag told us it wasn't. Let's not even get into the 3 smelts with 3 slices of Meyer lemon for $10! Salumi plate comes with pencil thin bread sticks. Huh??? I'm sorry, obviously my misunderstanding but I thought they would serve bread at a place called Flour + Water??? But sometimes if they feel generous they give you some bread other times they say they have none.... \"Please Sir may I have some more?\"\n\nAnd the pizza: Depending on which you order you can expect soggy, spongy, doughy. Certainly not crispy, definitely not flavorful. Have had the Margherita 3 times now, soggy each time, sauce is thin/watery/not very flavorful (that's why it's soggy-duh), crust on the edges is spongy and too thick and also tasteless.\nSorry better pizza/food in general at A16, Paulines, Beretta, Bar Bambino or Delfina for equal or less. Pizza should really be left to the professionals-Italians-not Irishmen that have visited Italy and think they can cash in on the latest trend.\n\nIn today's economy there are other restaurants that are struggling that deliver a better experience that deserve my/your business, please support them, not Flour + Water. F+W apparently doesn't think the money will ever stop coming in, so they don't need to make an effort for my/your business. And when I say effort I don't mean staying open until midnight to serve everyone that you've kept waiting for more than an hour.  \n\nPerhaps we'll revisit in 6 months when the reviews catch up to Flour + Water and see if they've learnt the fine art of running a restaurant and customer service.", "author": "Valerie R."}

There's a lot going for this new restaurant, from the hip decor to the really friendly and knowledgeable servers and staff.\n\nBut in the end, flour + water failed the most basic \"bang for buck\" test.  Maybe this is a place for people who have more bucks to drop than I do.  The clientele certainly seemed to be a tax-bracket or two ahead of me.  And I know that good foodies aren't supposed to care about trivialities like money, but hey, these are tough times, right?\n\nHere's my complaints:\n\n1) Communal seating.  Some people love it, and yeah, it's traditional Italian style.  But I like to be able to hear what the person I'm dining with is saying more easily than I can hear the person sitting next to me (basically in my lap) talking about how he was accused of defecating on someone's property just as I'm about to start eating my meal.  But that just could be me.\n\n2) The wine service.  This has nothing to do with money, but they have what they call a \"casual wine service\" at flour + water, which means if you order a bottle of wine, they open it at the bar, smell for cork-rot for you, and then bring the bottle to your table and let you pour the wine yourself.  This is all well and good if you order a bottle of red, but if you order a bottle of white, they offer no way to keep said white chilled while you dine.  Maybe that's nit-picky, but it seems like a fancy place like this should figure out a way to keep their white wine optimized for consumption throughout the meal.\n\n3)  The portions.  Maybe we were just really really hungry.  Maybe its unrealistic of me to expect that, for a party of two, sharing an appetizer/salad and ordering one entree each should be enough food to satiate an appetite.  This was not the case.  We ordered the heirloom tomato, cucumber and avocado salad to share, and it was very good, except for the lone, sad sliver of avocado topping the salad and the four or five grains of pepper dashed atop that.  Weak.\n\nThen we each ordered a pasta entree, and yes, they were each very very tasty dishes, but ultimately they felt more like the size of an appetizer than an entree.\n\nSo we ordered a pizza because we were still hungry and we still had wine (which was now getting lukewarm) left in the bottle.\n\n4) The pizza arrived burnt on the bottom.  I know pizza napoletana is supposed to be kinda charred, but when the main flavor you get is carbon, that's a little too charred.  And the bites that weren't charred were just kinda bland in general.  Nothing special.\n\nSo.  Despite my complaints, I want to reiterate that the pasta dishes were VERY good, and the service (except for the annoying wine thing) was also VERY good.  But the bill came out to about $100, including tip, which was more than we were expecting to spend.  So that was disappointing.\n\nThat being said, if you are one of those people for whom dropping $100 on a dinner for two ISN'T a big deal, then by all means, try flour + water.  Order a bottle or red so you don't have to worry about wine temperature, and maybe you'll have better luck with the pizza, and maybe the people sitting next to you will keep their dinner conversation away from bathroom-talk.", "author": "Kevin H."}

The pasta is divine, and the starters and contorni are interesting.

It was a very very unconventional bottle, and I just don't think the server should be recommending something so totally out there unless he makes it clear that it is really that weird.  He made it good for us, and didn't charge us for it and we bought another bottle.  But I've never had to send a bottle of wine back that was recommended by the server.

However, the hostess was nowhere to be seen. Literally nowhere. I know that this place is insanely busy and can be heaving with patrons, but having to flag down harrowed looking waitress to find the hostess so we could check in after standing at the podium for 10 minutes is not acceptable. \n\nOnce they'd graciously let us report for duty, we were led to a two-top in the back, wedged somewhere between the kitchen and the bathrooms and below that god awful mural of what we believed to be some fish mingling with a butterfly. Let me add that ladies, don't wear tights here - there are some unsanded patches on the chairs that can lead to splinters and stocking runs a-go-go. \n\nMoving on, our server was nice enough, but seemed inexperienced - there were no carafe refills when we'd clearly run out of water, and our plates were never exchanged between the salad course and the pizza course - so eating margherita pizza with lemon salad dressing smashed onto the bottom of the crust definitely wasn't ideal.\n\nIn terms of the food, it was absolutely nothing special.

The space is really cool though, especially the artwork on the walls. \n\nIf I lived in the neighborhood, I could see myself coming here every now and then because it's got a great vibe and the menu has interesting options that are fairly reasonably priced. But wait another week before coming here. They aren't taking reservations for another week, which means you'll be waiting up to an hour for a table or you'll have someone breathing down the back of your neck waiting to pounce on your empty seat.", "author": "Connie C."}

She didn't give me any attitude about being late for our reservations which is unusual especially for a hot restaurant like Flour + Water. \n\nWe both had appetizers and decided to get pizza for an entree since so much had been written about the pizza. We weren't disappointed. First of all, they are huge for one person. They were nicely done with interesting ingredients and thin crust baked perfectly. We both had to take pizza home because they were each so big. Because we were feeling piggy that night, we each got a dessert. They were delicious as well.\n\nThe staff was very attentive and nice.

We stopped by on Friday, the supposed opening night. Unfortunately we were greeted with the fact that all of the tables were reserved for friends/investors. The hostess gave us the option of waiting for seats to open up at the communal table or bar or \"Maybe you should just come back on Monday?\" Not the first impression we were looking for but we decided to stick it out anyway.\n\nOne of the co-owners helped us with our wine selection - he was very knowledgeable when it came to their list and super friendly. And then, we waited. I swear I burned holes in the back of some heads trying to encourage people to finish up. We eventually get two seats at the bar for three of us (another couple tried snagging the seats but I politely informed them that we were definitely there first - they said the hostess told them we weren't waiting for food. Hmph, really?)\n\nOn to the food...for three of us we ordered the smelt fritto (good) the sweet pea ricotta (just ok) and the Uovo pizza (fantastic) I love my pizza with a burnt, blistery crust and this is one area where Flour + Water does not disappoint. What was disappointing was the fact that all three dishes were delivered at the exact same time, even though we made it clear we were sharing. \n\nA couple of other observations: loved the Riedel stemware, hated the fact that there were no hooks under the bar. Really hated the herd mentality that comes with the 'first come first served' aspect of the communal table and bar seats. Yes, I'm talking to you Mr. Champagne who tried to steal seats from a couple that had been waiting A LONG time. I really wish they would have some sort of list for these seats.\n\nOverall, a three star experience that I'm sure will improve on future visits.

Even my husband disliked all the food and he's extremely easy to please. The combinations of vegetables and the sauces were very strange, they were mixed in a way as if they just took whatever was in the refrigerator and made a vegetarian pre fixe meal out of it all.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-10-21", "description": "We (2) arrived at opening, which is 5:30, without a reservation -- our mistaken reading of  the website which indicates that there are no reservations for more than 6, rather than fewer than 6 or some number that is more the norm in places that don't accept reservations.  It's a counter-intuitive reservation policy compared to most places.  We were offered a spot at the communal table or at the bar, and chose the corner of the bar.  Seats are not especially comfortable, and eventually the then empty bar filled.  The owner or someone in authority brought his laptop over after we were seated to show us the reservation policy; I was rather over it by that point.  \n\nOrdered a mid-range bottle of wine and when it was arrived were told that it was \"casual service,\" which turned my head: what does that mean after they have opened it and placed it in front of you with two glasses?  Struck me as odd in that it is so little added effort to pour the wine. Sure, I can pour my own glass of wine, but why?  Give me the corkscrew and let me have at it if you are going to call it casual.    Pour they did not, until the very end of the meal when they were all to eager to start pouring out that last glass.  I waived them off at that point, in that the whole policy seemed transparent and self-serving at that  point.  It wasn't a suble hint, and it wasn't well rec'd.  Geez, we'd arrived at 5:30 on a Weds evening, nose pressed to the door; I hardly felt pressure to vacate the BAR before 7:00.  \n\nFood was fine, but nothing special compared to what's available in the general vicinity.  The pasta (tagliolini with 'shrooms) by far outshone the pizza, which was limp in the middle and a far cry from Delfina or other local pizza haunts (e.g.,Piccino).   I ordered the roasted turnips, and now realize that I actually rec'd the brussel sprouts, both of which I will eat any day.  They were good but a bit too salty with the capers, which were an unncessary addition.  I like them both, and hence didn't pay attention to the misdelivery, but Delfina does a better job of each.    I think that the roasted veggies and the pizza suffer from an oven that is not hot enough.  Perhaps the oven is not hot enough at opening time?\n\nWhile the bar waiter seemed to imply that the salad would come first, then the pasta, then the pizza and the roasted veggies, everything came as we were still working on our salad, which itself had arrived rather quickly after ordering.  It all felt rushed and as if I was lucky to be there, which I didn't feel that the place deserved given the alternatives.  Yes, it's a diverse and showy crowd, but, frankly, that's secondary to the food as far as I am concerned.  \n\nI really wanted to like it, had driven by and lusted for it, and it was a birthday treat from a friend for me.   Felt kind of bad that she had spent so much on something so mediocre.  If I went back and was seated at the bar or communal table, both of which I would consider inferior to a table, I would slow down the service by insisting that the food be brought in courses or ordering by the course.  In my book, I'd much prefer to take my chances at snagging a table or counter seat at either Delfina Pizzeria (18th) or Delfina, La Ciccia or Piccino.   And if that fails, pick up something at BiRite, either to-go or to cook at home; you can't beat Bi-Rite for all-around friendliness, quality or shopping vibe.", "author": "Jean A."}

Most definately do not wait 2+ hours for a drop in.  Also, doesn't Flour + Water = Glue?  \nWhere do I start?  First off, we arrived for 7:15 PM rezzies and we were immediately informed by the greeter that the party occupying our table was winding down.  This took 30 minutes.  No problem, the greeter was very sweet and apologetic and as it turns out, was the best part of the evening.  We had a beer and scooted to the corner to check out the vibe.  When I was able to sit back and take in the entire restaurant, I must say, I was a little confused.  What overall vibe are they going for?  If I had to guess, I would say 70's swinger party with attitude.  The music was loud, the restaurant was decked out in the type of raw wood you only see in 70's porn movies, and there was a definite air of aloofness about the place.  \nNow for the patrons.  It was an interesting mix of trust fund hipsters and what I can only describe as the baby boomer opera set.  So in a nutshell, hoodies + beanies and those who are waaay too dressed up for the outer mish.  Confusing.\nOn to the dinner.  Our server never even looked us in the eye as he spouted off the menu.  WTF?  It reminded me of our dinning experience at Gary Danko, were we spent the entire evening making fun of all the pretentious attitudes.  Just because you turned Steve Jobs away, it doesn't all of a sudden make your restaurant the French Laundry.\nWe ordered the marinated artichoke & shelling beans with tonnato sauce & bottarga for an appetizer.  The portions were far too small, and their were only a few artichokes to be found.  Despite this, I found the dish to be very tasty and complex.  \nFor the second course, we ordered the whole wheat farfalle with anise braised pork & spigarello.  OMFG, it was good!  The pasta melted in your mouth and the pork was sweet and salty and not too dry.\nFor the final course, we ordered the margherita- tomato, basil, fior di latte & extra virgin olive oil.  I must say I was very dissapointed.  The edges of the crust were very burnt, which I find extremely unpalatable and downright annoying.  The sauce and cheese were also unremarkable.  I would MUCH rather have a margherita pie at Defina (Yum).  \nAll and all, if I had it to do over again, we would have just ordered a couple of apps and a few pasta dishes.  Skip the pizza.  \n\nSo, in a Nutshell:\n\nVibe: Weirdsies\nWaitstaff: Pretentious with a hint of arrogance (except for the greeter, she rocked)\nFood: Apps, good but small portions.

I opted for gluttony by ordering so much food (we also had a smallish, forgettable heirloom tomato salad and pizza, see below) but I am glad we did. The chantrelle and taglierini(?), wild boar stuffed pasta and pesto ribbon pasta dishes were cooked perfectly, fresh, and just mind-blowingly delicious. The sauces made me forget my manners as I was wiping them up with whatever bread I could find. \n\nHowever, that's not to say there were some failings. After we ordered a bottle of wine, our server brought us an open bottle, two glasses, and explained this totally ridiculous policy called \"casual wine service,\" as if that's some sort of industry standard. Basically, it means pour it yourself, bub. Like that requires so much effort? Lame. Oh, and apparently they already tasted it...? Um... fail.\n\nAlso, the pizza, while solidly good, took quite awhile to come out (apparently they like to hatch them in litters and have a smallish oven).

I know it's not entirely their fault that some of their patrons want to sit and chat for an extra hour after their meal but if you know that someone has a 10:15pm reservation, they probably don't want to be told that our table will be ready at 10:15 when we arrived at 10:00pm just to make sure that our reservation wasn't given away, only to come back at 10:15 and have to wait another 30 minutes. \n\nNow, my even bigger gripe.  We have a group of 4 sitting right beside us that were completely rude.  Normally at a nice establishment like this, screaming and laughing like a hyena is not acceptable.  We looked around the room and there were at least 3-4 other tables giving this table seated right beside us dirty looks.  I'm usually pretty tolerant of noise, I understand that people talk and laugh and want to have a good time, but I couldn't even hear the person directly across the table speaking to me.  While I understand that the restaurant probably doesn't want to embarrass or anger certain patrons, when it is clearly, and very visibly ruining other people's dinners, they  need to be proactive and tell the people next to us to lower their voices.\n\nThe food was pretty good, but I couldn't enjoy it since I had a pounding headache half way through dinner.  We got the margherita pizza and pasta with whey braised pork shoulder (which was a great dish).

This was my second time there on valentines day where the first time was ok, so i gave another shot after hearing the continued hype.  This time time like the first was fine as to unique taste, but with all the hype, I expected more.  I hope management reads these and not diminishes them, but the reviews here are mixed which should tell one something.  The wait staff was good, the atmosphere  interesting, the food tasty but not great once I found it on my plate as it was so small...so maybe I was wrong in expecting out of this world like some of the hype.  In the end with a few glasses of wine for my date and I,the tab was almost $300.  So way over priced and the wine selections were not that good.  When I mentioned the bill and lack of value to the cashier, she got defensive and got snotty for only tipping $20.  With all the great restaurants in the Bay Area, I will just look elsewhere as I found this one oh-hum with sticker shock at the end.  So after two visits, much thought, even held off reviewing the first time as I asked myself what am I missing, I now give only  2 stars regardless of price.  My bet is either they change or in the end, the market will change it for them as you can't fool all the people all the time.", "author": "Tim M."}

Unfortunately Flour + Water does not bring anything new to the SF pizza scene.  As I was eating my pizza my friend commented that the pizza tasted almost identical to A-16, right down to the sauce.  However unlike A-16 there is no delicious hot chili oil and yummy bread.  There are only four different pizza selections, and most of the menu is filled with pasta and main courses.  \n\nThese guys clearly have a very hot oven because the crust has those great charred bubbles on the outside, but the middle of the pizza is very soggy - fork and knife are a must here.  The brown-butter giblet pasta I tried was very rich and tasty, but boy was it tiny.  I shared it with one of my friends along with a pizza and we were both so hungry afterwards that we ate all the garnish that came with the pasta.

The hostess was very friendly and told us there was about a 45 minute wait for a table.  This didn't surprise me, considering how much buzz this place has been getting.  It was a lovely evening so we decided to wait on the bench in the entry way.  The hostess came by with a wine menu and asked if we'd like a drink while we waited.  We ordered and she quickly delivered our wine with a smile on her face.  She was great.\n\nWe were seated within 30 minutes and the service was great for the remainder of our dinner.  The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  We split a pizza, the pork belly and leg dish, and dessert.  Having recently been to Delifna Pizza, I'll admit I think the pie at Flour + Water was delicious, but not quite as good.  Definitely no complaints though.  It was very fresh and tasted great.  The pork dish on the other hand was out of this world.  I was surprised how refined the flavors were, and how perfectly cooked the meat was.  This was a high quality restaurant dish.  We were very pleased.  Dessert was also great.  Chocolate budino is a must for chocolate lovers.  Very rich, but oh so satisfying.\n\nOf course while we were waiting for a table outside, some snobby woman came by complaining that there was a wait.  \"Oh it's so frustrating every time I try to eat here there's a 40 minute wait!\"  What a princess.  Anyone who regularly dines out in SF should know, new restaurants, along with old favorites, especially ones with great food are ALWAYS busy.  Get over it people.  You're not special and nobody cares.  I have a feeling a lot of the Yelp haters are in that princess category.  The food is amazing, the ambiance was great and the staff was friendly as can be.

We only had to wait about 20 minutes outside before we were seated at the front communal table that seemed to be shared by 2 other parties of 3-4.  It was a bit awkward, but we made the best of it.   An interesting note, they wouldn't take our name when we arrived.  Instead, they insisted we wait just outside the door way on the sidewalk if we wanted to make sure we got in as walk-ins and they will come outside and find you to bring you in instead of calling out your name.  I hoped that I was memorable enough that the hostess would find the right asian chick standing outside.  There were 4 of us, after all.\n\nThe restaurant has a cool interior with very flattering lighting, but the noise was insane!  It was difficult to carry a conversation and even harder to communicate with the wait staff unless they were standing within 6 inches of you.\n\nWe had the fritto, braised pork cheeks, the margherita pizza, and the uovo pizza.  Everything was satisfactory.  The pizza crust and all the toppings  were fresh..  The egg on my uovo pizza was perfect and totally lived up to my expectation!  The pork cheeks were delicious, but was a bit pricey considering it did not come with vegetables or salad and thus was rather a small portion.  My favorite was the fritto... a fresh made to order portion of breaded and fried onions, smelt, and lemons.  Perfectly seasoned and the flavors and texture was spot on.   I would go back simply to order that appetizer again! \n\nIt seemed to take much longer than it should have to get our food and water service was a bit spotty, but I think the wait staff were doing the best they could to keep up and check in now and then.\n\nI think this place has real potential once they straighten out service and such.

So i couldn't even hold it up unless i had a knife.  \n\nMy personal preference is to always eat pizza with your hands and never a knife.  But even so the bottom of the pizza was very soggy.  \n\nOverall for flavor a 5 star vote.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-21", "description": "During a spell living in Manhattan my wife and I became accustomed to lofty standards of pizza.  Since moving out west a couple of years ago we've found rather thinner pickings, so we're always on the lookout for places purporting to produce a premium pie.  When we heard about another new offering in the culinary hotbed that is The Mission, we had to give it a look.\n\nFlour and water is not a pizzeria, rather it's a contemporary Italian restaurant that includes pizza on its menu.   But the pizzas that they have are of a standard that earns this place a mention in the San Francisco pizza conversation.  This is a stylish restaurant - designer Sean Quigley (of Paxton Gate fame) brings quirky, fun designs to the dining room, with references to his work (natural sciences, taxidermy, sea life etc) throughout.  Some of the objects on display in the bathrooms are reminiscent of Damien Hirst, and I particularly liked the science lab beakers that hold the candles on each table.\n\nAnyway, back to the pizza: they have a selection of four pies on the menu, which - for the moment at least - are rotated on a nightly basis.  We went with a couple of friends and tried all four that were on offer and were impressed.  The pies conform to the Neapolitan tradition - thin crusts, relatively light on cheese, and with those outrageously tasty crispy bits around the outside of the crust.  The combinations of toppings were varied and interesting and the ingredients of a high quality.\n\nBut everything here smacked of quality - the antipasti salads are as delicious as they are intriguing: a warm potato and lamb's tongue salad with poached egg, summer squash with duck prosciutto & toasted pistachio stood out.  And a delicious thyme ice cream with strawberries and candied fennel finished things off nicely.\n\nOur visit came shortly after the place opened, and the service still seemed to be finding its feet, but with these friendly and knowledgeable staff members it will surely hit its stride.  We can't wait to head back and try their pastas!", "author": "Dom B."}

Maybe it was the bland interior, or the overly casual servers who looked like they just rolled out of bed and into last night's skinny jeans so they wouldn't be late for class at SF City College. Look, I get the casual vibe you're trying to sell here, but come on! Even the waitstaff appeared too uninspired by the joint to care. Or pour my wine, apparently. \n\nThe menu is small but inventive, at least when you view it on paper. We decided on the roasted squash with pistachios, watercress, and lardo to start. It was ok, but the texture - mush - made it so you didn't really want to have more than one bite. The pasta we ended up with was definitely the stand out dish, but it's hard to go wrong when your dishes main ingredients are tomato sauce and pancetta. The pizza we chose - the melanzana - was a too salty combo of eggplant, capers, garlic, gaeta olives, and tomatoes. We picked at it, asked them to box up the rest, and we never saw it again. We just didn't care enough to ask about where it ended up. \n\nThe chocolate budino dessert was delicious. But again, velvet-y desserts with flavored creme topped with sea salt are being done, and done better, all over this town. Maybe it was the items we chose, or maybe I was in a particularly salty mood, but I left Flour + Water totally wishing I'd gone to Beretta.", "author": "Sarah M."}

Flour + Water is like the new hip cousin of Delfina, sure it's a little bit harder to get to, and sure, you can't be \"seen\" eating at one of the sidewalk tables, but in my opinion, flour + water is by far the winner of the two. ( but who said it was a contest?) \n\nThe restaurant itself is cute, clean and modern looking, and despite what the S.O. claims, I do not believe it has a nautical feel to it. There is a large communal table up front with mostly two person tables in the rear. The tables are pretty much reserved for those with reservations, which you need to make far FAR in advance. I've eaten at both the communal table and reserved tables and have enjoyed both. The only possible down side to the communal table is that all the good smelling food right next to you is actually off limits (unless you're willing to steal a strangers food). I really liked the earthy feel to the place, the tables are all solid wood with few embellishments to distract from their beauty, and who couldn't notice those iconic kitchen napkins with their green stripe (as I embarrassingly looks in my kitchen drawers to see a pile of them stained and dirty).\n\nAs for the food, it is simply divine. When we go here we generally will order one pizza and one pasta and share. The pizza has a distinctly salty crust which is complimented by a delicious creamy sauce. I couldn't get enough of the crust. Of the pastas, I have had ravioli both times, pumpkin and the most delicious mushroom ever. friends have ordered the meat and claim it is delicious as well, but I'll let them be the judge of that. The S.O. and I love any restaurant where there are enough vegetarian options where we are not stuck ordering the same thing, and this place definitely fits that bill. On top of a cozy atmosphere and knock out food, the wait staff has always been courteous and helpful in pairing wines and recommending desserts.\n\nOverall, if you have not tried Flour + Water yet march yourself down there and experience what can only be called one of SF's best new restaurants.

Unfortunately, they weren't met.  \n\nFirst let me start by saying that the dining room is beautiful and the current photo exhibit on bees, is spectacular. Unfortunately, the music in the dining room is too loud, and it increases the overall noise factor causing everyone to yell at each other to have a conversation.\n\nThe wait service is great and while it's not advertised on the menu, we were given the option of ordering half orders of pasta. \n\nAs for the food, it was good but not spectacular.  We started off with one of their more popular items, the boar raviolini. Sadly, this dish totally lacked pizazz. There was very little sauce, I couldn't taste any horseradish, and to top it off and the pasta was raw around the edges. Crunchy ravioli is not great.\n\nThe other pasta dish was the capellaci with rabbit polpettini and it was great. This pasta had good flavor and was cooked to perfection. Unfortunately, the dish had a too much salt for my liking. \n\nThe next course was the sausage pizza which was delicious. The caramelized onions were sweet and a nice compliment to the sausage, and the crust had good texture and flavor. \n\nFor dessert, we had the chocolate budino with espresso caramel cream and sea salt, this too was a disappointment. The budino and cream were good but the sea salt was too coarse and there was too much sprinkled on top. \n\nThe wine list is good albeit expensive considering the small servings. I would suggest ordering a bottle. My friend and I don't usually drink a full bottle of wine at dinner, but given the small servings we ended up spending just as much on a few glasses as for a bottle.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad I went but don't think I'll make an effort to go back.

We'd heard the Flour + Water hype, so we set out for the Mission......\n\nAnd it was a typical chilly SF night.  We had done what everyone does - tried to make a reservation and when we couldn't - we decided we could 'walk-in' and have a glass of wine at the bar while we waited.  NOPE.  There is NOWHERE to stand, let alone sit, and enjoy a glass of wine while you wait for your table.  There is very little room at the bar, so you have to be on the list and seated there in order to be there.  I was crammed up against the wall next to the door (where a cold draft blew on me every time someone opened it) for the roughly 45 - 60 minutes while we waited for our table (8 or 9ish on a Friday night).  If we'd wanted, there was a small entry way outside we could have waited in - again though, it was a chilly SF night!  Regardless of the space, we were offered a glass of wine by the hostess which was much appreciated.  \nAt that point, we believed the waiting and circumstances surrounding it would be worth it and looked forward to our meal.\nWe ordered one of the pastas, a pizza, and a salad to share.  Can't even remember now which ones.  They were good.  Not what I was expecting though after so much hype and waiting, so a little anti-climactic, especially when it came time to pay for dinner.  \nFortunately, they had some decent wines to choose from, and the service was good.\nA little disappointing overall.  \nGood friend + good wine saved my Friday night!", "author": "Amie W."}

Part of the reason the wait was so tolerable was the hostess and service staff were very accommodating and allowed us to take our wine right outside of the restaurant where there was space.  Without being asked, they also brought us bread and a complimentary half of pizza probably because we weren't constantly bugging the hostess asking when exactly we would be seated.  \n\nIf you are planning to eat at Flour and Water, I recommend you be patient and know that if you walk in, you will have to wait quite possibly for a very long time.  Don't be rude and impatient and you will be very well taken care of.  \n\nWhen we sat down, we asked the hostess and two different waiters what pastas they recommend and we got 3 different and helpful answers.  You basically can't go wrong as every pasta we tasted was amazing - in particular the wheat pasta with Italian sausage.    \n\nOverall exceptional food and I strongly recommend getting a handful of pasta dishes to share with your table so you can taste different dishes.", "author": "James H."}

The host told us that we had a long wait before we could be seated, but we were welcome to hang out at the bar.  No problem there.  Furthermore, the bar only had about 6 people sitting at it when we got there.\n\nSo, we stood, and waited, and waited some more.  The bartender did not even say hello, despite our repeated attempts to make eye contact.  Now, when an older, distinguished looking man stood next to us for only a minute or so, he got immediate attention.  Luckily, he lived up to his debonair appearance with politeness and pointed the bartender to us.  This must have really disappointed her, but she then took our order.\n\nNow, my girlfriend and I are blessed with youthful appearances, but, I really dislike getting this sort of treatment.  Anyway, we had ordered a pizza to hold ourselves over, it was a tomato pie topped with egg and pancetta (called uovo).  Not a bad pizza.  My complaint here is the lack of interesting choices.  The egg was good, but was really a poor substitute for cheese, and I don't feel as though it added anything.\n\nAnyway, enough criticism, the rest of the meal was quite good.  My girlfriend got the pork cheek, which I thought was bland, but she liked.  I had cod, which was good.  Still, my favorite part of both dishes were the sides, which were simply bursting with flavor.\n\nWe ended with a dessert: mine was the chocolate espresso budino, and it was really delicious.  My girlfriend had the cornmeal cake, which I did not like nearly as much, but I am very partial to chocolate.\n\nNo hard feelings.  I would go back if they changed thier menu, which leads me to my final complaint: I just wasn't that excited about anything on the menu, esp in the appetizer and the primi sections.

They\nhave this huge vacant space near the windows, but there are no seats or\neven a shelf for your drink, and there is no seating outside either (HUGE\nsidewalk tho).  So you just have to stand around and try to look relaxed.\n\nThe whole 'no seating at the bar' rule also bugs me, Baretta did this as\nwell and it defeats the point of the tall community table.

The scene was quiet and inviting with the candles everywhere and natural wood. It took awhile for the hostess to appear, she was either setting tables or getting people's drinks because it was several minutes before she appeared.\n\nWe started by sharing the warm potato and lamb's tongue salad with poached egg. I thought the taste was good but a little overwhelmed by the amount of mustard. My husband didn't like the textures.\n\nIt was tough to decide between the pizzas, pastas, and meat dishes. The pasta servings appeared to be reasonable size from what I caught of glimpse of at other tables. I ordered the pork leg and belly while my husband requested the pasta with duck and mushrooms. While I'd say the taste was decent, I had a tough time with the pork legs because of the tendons or whatever unchewable strings were woven within my slices of meat. It didn't taste bad, it was just frustrating for me to have to deal with the chewiness. It could have been just my teeth as my husband didn't have as much of an issue with it. His pasta was simple with a clean mushroom flavor.\n\nFor dessert we shared the chocolate budino (similar to pot au creme). It was a surprisingly big portion. It was very chocolately and the sea salt and espresso creme were a very good complement. Personally, it was so rich, we couldn't quite finish. Very tasty, but I would only order this to share.\n\nThis was an anniversary dinner for us, so I have to say I was a bit underwhelmed. It's fine, but I'd rather be at Delfina.", "author": "Px C."}

I liked the crispy fried nettle sprinkled on the soup, gives it a nice touch. \n\n- pizza: I think we got the muscle pizza and some other pork pizza. both pizzas are really really good. I love the thin crunchy crust.\n\n- seafood tortellini: I loved it, just wish there were more in the plate. you can definitely taste the the fresh seafood and the funnel it's cooked with. my husband didn't like the dough so much, but I think it's a personal preference. \n\n- seabass: this was good. I can't say it was really spectacular, because seabass would be considered more of a normal food compare to everything else in the menu. I do like the vegetable, onions and beans that came with the plate which makes it a great combination. \n\n- chard: pretty good. did't think chard would taste good, but it did. \n\n- chocolate budino: very very good. I couldn't have enough of it, the espresso and caramel are in perfect harmony with the chocolate budino. the sea salt gives it a great contrast. \n\ndinner was finished on a high note due to the dessert. the service was awesome. here's the thing, this place is not your typical restaurant with conventional food. I give it credit trying to be different and original. You can just close your eyes and point at some dishes on the menu and it will at least be pretty good. lots of surprises.

After deciding on F + W, we had this crazy idea that we would show up and be the first people there.

We managed to snag 2 seats at the communal table but were somewhat amazed to hear that all the tables were already reserved. \n\nWe placed an order for a margherita as soon as we sat down. The waitress tried to explain that it could be problematic for coursing out our meal if we ordered pizza first b/c it would come out really fast. Yes, this was the point! I think ours was the first pizza out of the oven and it arrived about 3 minutes after our order went in. We requested a funghi to follow it up, no salads or wine, but lots of water please. I loved that the cheese and crust were salty enough, bland pizza is the worst. The funghi with hen of the woods mushrooms and a surprising blended, bright green, and garlicky gremolata was brilliant! Blistered, wood-oven crust as it should be.\n\nI would definitely go back, as the pork shoulder and belly secondi sounded like meaty succulence (sorry Joy!), but the pizzas were great.

Actually a lot that I wasn't really familiar with. The bartender, really the sommelier, was awesome. Super friendly, super knowledgeable and really helpful. I told him I really like Chiantis and Barberas and he said , \"ok you want something with acid.\" Yup, I'd heard those terms used before, he poured me a taste of the suggested wine and I was like perfect! He did the same for my girl when it came time to order her a glass. I usually like to order a bottle, cause thatz how i roll, but our bartender\\server\\sommelier was so knowledgeable it was more fun and educational to go by the glass.\n\nOK, so the food was awesome! We shared the following: for the appetizer we went with a frisee, arugula salad topped with duck prosciutto and shaved Parmesan , - delicious and fresh with just enough dressing; next we had a pizza with mushrooms(something like cremini or maybe porcini?) - perfectly toasted crust, really flavorful sauce; finally we had the local rock cod with escarole and Jerusalem artichoke with the bagna cauda sauce(butter, garlic, olive oil...yes i had to look that up) - the fish was cooked perfectly not dry at all!\n\nWhen we first sat down, desert had already caught our eye, cornmeal olive oil cake with honey thyme ice cream! so unique and sooo good!\n\nWe've already eyeballed some of the other appetizers, pizzas and pasta dishes for our next visit  ;-)\n\nRecommendations: sit at the bar, the bartender guy is awesome; yes it's crowded; yes it's a new place and they haven't ironed out all the details, but thatz to be expected of a new place.", "author": "isaias J."}

But the atmosphere was casual but nice, the list of Italian wines by the class was a welcome sight, and the pleasant servers where on top of things. \n\nThe pizza we ordered was good. But in a city where good pizza is as ubiquitous as strollers on Chestnut Street, the same or better can be found at many other places (such as Delfina, but you know that already).\n\n\nNow the \"Meh.\" The real story came with the dull mushroom pappardelle pasta (they make it themselves), and the weak side of wilted/roasted beets and greens. My friend ordered a crab and citrus salad that she'd heard about. She liked it, but I thought that the dressing was a bit out of whack. She also had a dessert that was excellent.\n\nShould I go back, I will try the entrees--they looked good.

My friend and I were at the restaurant for a total of 2 1/2 hours including waiting time. The entire time we were there a Latin family of four, including 2 young kids, were there waiting to be seated. They had been there before we arrived. It was very upsetting to watch everyone come in after be seated eat and leave and the family was still waiting to even get a table. When I approached the hostess to ask what's up with this she said she told them three hours which is crazy. When I mentioned why don't you let them order a pizza for the young kids she said that was not aloud. Clearly flour and water doesn't respect their true neighbors and don't understand the history of the mission district. I will not go back to a restaurant that will serve their white yuppie cliental before their true neighbors.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-05-29", "description": "I won't give this place a lame review, because I think unless a place really deserves it, that is, well...lame. I'm not into giving overly negative reviews lately, maybe it's my belief in karma, I don't know. I think places that suck will not make it, especially with negative Yelpers on the net, so I will likely continue to review places that I think are good to great, at least until businesses can fend for themselves (some Yelpers are simply ridiculous and shouldn't be taken seriously by anyone, much less a distraught business owner facing smaller numbers because of some third world commentary on their business to which they have no rebuttal)...\n\nAnyway, tried the hot flour + water tonight. Not bad, to be sure. Surely a slightly skeptical review won't lessen the wait there, so here goes (yes, I'm sure of this).\n\nI wanted to try the pizza because I read that they brought the oven over from Italy and cook the pies at a mere 800 degrees. Nice. I tried the mussel and garlic pie. It was about what I expected. Super thin crust, light sauce, and hardly any cheese at all. I guess that's the main problem I had with it. I am sure that this is truly authentic Italian pie. The difference between this and A16 or Delfina though is that I couldn't see or even taste any cheese at all. It just seemed like crust, light sauce and a mussels and garlic. The mussels were good and a nice topping, which I had never tried before. The garlic was also good, not too strong and in a moderate to light dose, always good for the romance prospects for the evening.\n\nI also tried the asparagus + split pea + mint soup (served cold). It was nice. No complaints, but not great. I had a similar potato leek soup at Harris' earlier this week that was much better. So, I'm not writing home about this soup. Good, but not great.\n\nI don't like to reveal my favorites in my reviews for fear of larger crowds, but let's be realistic. I don't think anyone will actually go to a place I prefer over their fave anyway, so I'll go ahead and reveal my sources for comparison. \n\nI think A16 is much better. Something about it. Almost the same pie with the same wood burning oven, but it's somehow much better.\n\nI also think Delfina is better. Their appetizers seem better, although I admit I'd need to try a few more of F+w's to judge appropriately.\n\nI also think Beretta is better. Just a better all around experience (foodwise, I don't care much about the atmosphere or the service, unless it's truly horrible, which none of these places are).\n\nSo there you have it.  I don't think this place sucks, and if you're in the market for real Italian I think you'll like it. Enjoy.\n\nUPDATE: A fellow Yelper informed me that the pie I ordered does not come with cheese. My bad. I'm still leaving it at 4 stars because I prefer the other places I mentioned, but that is only my preference, and I suggest any true Italian pizza lover try this place.", "author": "Matt H."}

Luckily we were the last two to get two of their Margherita Pizzas (Fri @8PM--sit down time).\n\nPizza: Crust was fabulous and perfectly seasoned (Better than Gialina's).  Unfortunately, the pizza didn't come straight from the oven and the sauce (which was good) had a chance to slober all over the bottom of the pizza.  Overall, it was the best neopolitan we've tried in the city.  We asked for olives to be added to one of the pizzas - cost $2, which was pricey once we noticed there were few placed on it.  I wish Flour+Water read into trying to make a D.O.C. pizza !!!\n\nSalad: Had the apricots, greens, parmesan salad which was tasty but nothing you can't find in a foodie's SF.\n\nDessert: Semifreddo with pistachios served with crushed biscotti and poached cherries.  Semifreddo was great (just like Aquarello).  I didn't care much for the biscotti and poached cherries - presentation was nice, but didn't get it.  Biscotti uncrushed would have served better.  Placing the crushed-pistachios on top of the semifreddo isn't my favorite since you can't enjoy the semifreddo's delicate texture (which is what you'd really want to appreciate).\n\nBeer: Pilsner rocked.

However, I can think of other equally good restaurants that don't require a six week wait so for me it's not worth the hype and not worth the hassle of a return visit, but I would return if it were more user friendly or I lived in the neighborhood.", "author": "Mike W."}

They're happy to bring you drinks while you wait and just add it to the bill in the end.\n\nWe got seated at the bar (my fave) after a less than expected wait and ordered a salad, pizza, pork belly and side veggie.\n\nImagine our surprise when the pizza came out first. Oh well, we were hungry. And the pizza was.... eh? The crust was decent but the toppings lacked flavor. The tomato sauce was just OK. It was a cheeseless pizza (by design) the really needed something else. Disappointing.\nThis was followed by a peach salad that was IMPOSSIBLE to eat. Green stalky veggies that were too long to get in one bite but too strong to cut easily. Oh well. This salad also lacked cheese -- not by design. The cheese was so scarce it shouldn't have been listed as a menu item.\n\nOn to the pork belly. Uber crisp and on a bed of spinach, beans and plum. Great bottom but the pork belly wasn't prepared properly. Bits of it were and they were tasty, but the rest had unrendered fat that tasted like, well, fat. \n\nThe highlight was the fried little peppers. Most of them were properly blistered and tasty.

OpenTable showed it as having no reservations available at all that day (Monday), but we decided to wing it and just show up. The restaurant is on the corner of a plain residential building, so you really should watch for the sign. However, I knew exactly where it was, because I drove past it the other day, so I just walked in at around 6:30 and the pleasant hostess said we could have half of the community table upfront until they needed it for a reservation a couple of hours later. Win!\n\nWe ordered white wine, to cool down after the hot day. I chose Anselmi -I believe San Vincenzo -but in retrospect I should have gone with Melanie's Trebbiano d'Abruzzo, because it was drier and more refreshing. Gene X won by ordering Sorelle Bronca prosecco, which was so good that we got a whole bottle.\n\nThe food was delicious as well. The starter was a small appetizer, a corn salad with stuffed summer squash, basil, and some other tasty bits. Since flour+water's reputation comes mainly from its Neapolitan-style pizza, we ordered two: margherita (you know what that is) and melanzana (eggplant and olives). They had a nice thin crust with pillowy edges and were very good, but I do have to say that A16 does a better margherita pizza (especially with their chili oil that you drizzle on top, yumm).\n\nThe service was fairly nice, though I do wish that the complimentary bread consisted of more than 1 slice per person, and we did have to ask for olive oil additionally. Also, they brought us the wrong bill on the first try, but corrected it after we pointed it out.

Each item brings meaning to the dish and complements the croquette perfectly.  Three came on our dish.\n\n*Funghi pizza - This was the BEST pizza I've ever had.  I thought I had it at Zero Zero, but f+w give ZZ its run for the money.  The crust was crunchy, chewy and had a touch of salt.

We were in a celebration mood and fully intended to order multiple courses and wine.  When we arrived, we were told by the hostess, in a snotty and dismissive tone, that the wait would be two hours.  Ok, fair enough; we had no reservation and this is SF, after all.  We waited the time at the vegan restaurant across the street, which we actually enjoyed very much.  We returned twice to check on the wait time and make sure the hostesses knew we were still waiting.  \n\nWe returned at 9pm, at the close of our quoted two hours.  The hostess, giggling nervously, told us that she had \"completely messed up\" and given our table to someone else, and that the wait would be another 45 minutes.  This was, of course, completely unacceptable.  At the same time, another group was being told the same thing, and they promptly stormed off into the night.   It was clear that either the hostesses and management were completely disorganized, or that somebody had invested $20 in a shorter wait time - and that either way, they didn't value our business or that of the other party.  We promptly hailed a cab and left, and ended up at Incanto in Noe Valley - who welcomed not only our $400 but ourselves as well, and we had a wonderful meal with a helpful and friendly server.  F + W probably lost $800 worth of business that night. \n\nFlour + Water's management clearly regards customers as expendable, and that attitude has been amplified and projected by its arrogant, twenty-year old hostesses.

Went in with no real expectations except liking their web site and knowing that it was a popular restaurant.\n\nArrive at 5:40 without a reservation. Friendly reception. Given a choice of seats at the bar or at the communal table.  Chose communal table. \n\nRestaurant relatively quiet and pleasant for first half hour except for the rather loud coversation of the group of  young women sitting next to us at the table. Can't blame them, but reveals the downside of sitting at a communal table with strangers.  The tall seats at the table were uncomfortable after about 15 minutes.  Too bad.  Made the rest of the evening a bit of a physically uncomfortable affair. \n\n30 minutes in the crowd descended on the place like locusts and the room was unpleasantly noisy and crowded, particularly around the communal table where folks waiting for a table are shunted to stand, talk and drink.\n\nFirst few dishes arrived quickly.  Timing after that was truly terrible.  Trying to feed to many people at once.  Servers were fine.  Tried to be pleasant but not much they could do if the kitchen isn't producing the goods.\n\nSoup course (sunchoke with chanterelles and pancetta) was unbelievably salty.  (And I love salt.)  So salty that it is hard to imagine that it was created by a professional chef.  Too bad, because it had potential and probably would have been delicious if it weren't so oversalted.\n\nSardines were, ironically, not salty enough.  And more fishy than I expected.  And the additional flavorings on the plate were not terribly flavorful or interesting.  Hard to eat, to be honest.  Not a good dish.  \n\nBeet salad was relatively good.  Pretty to look at.  Nicely composed.  But it had two elements in it that were questionable:  chunks of blandly flavored clear gelatin that didn't add (or subtract) much and sprigs of a green branching plant (not sure what type - looked a bit like pickleweed) that were salty and that didn't mix in well with the citrus and sweet elements of the rest of the salad.  Lose the \"pickleweed\" and you have a winner.\n\nPizza (salsiccia) was OK but nowhere near as good as others I've had - Delfina blows this away.  Once again, the pizza was unacceptably salty.  Parts of the pizza crust were burnt (not a big deal, but less than ideal.)  I give the pizza 5/10.\n\nPasta (pappardelle with hen and mustard greens) came too late for us to eat at the table as a result of the long delays out of the kitchen.  Didn't want to be obnoxious, so had them box it up for us to take home.  Once at home, found it to be, once again, unbelievably salty and relatively heavy handed in its flavorings.\n\nOverall impression:  mediocre food for a restaurant with obvious pretensions of being a \"serious\" restaurant, overextended kitchen trying to feed too many people at once, excessivsly noisy space, poor customer management, suboptimal seating (lose the communal table and put in a few more tables).  The chef really needs to completely recalibrate his/her use of salt - doesn't seem to have a clue how to use it properly.  Shocking, actually.\n\nI've eaten at lots and lots of excellent restaurants, some fancy and pretentious, some friendly and low key.  In a city with lots and lots of outstanding choices, there is little room for an operation that can't execute in the kitchen and that doesn't have a professional front of the house operation.  \n\nCan't believe that it is as popular as it seems to be.  No accounting for taste I guess.  I can't see this place lasting very long without some serious changes.  If you're in doubt, forget it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-11-14", "description": "I actually had a reasonable experience dining here once long ago, but the front of the house staff they currently employ make the experience totally unbearable and not worth attempting.  I guess the good folks who manage/own this restaurant haven't heard that gourmet pizza/pasta restaurants are popping up around San Francisco like mushrooms after a rain shower, with great food and many of them actually treating their customers as though they want the business, which is a much more compelling offer than the snotty Paste-i-tude emanating from this place.\n\nLast night, in honor of a special occasion, some friends of ours who live around the corner stopped in at 6 to put our names in for a reservation.  Being literally 90 seconds away on foot, they asked if the restaurant could call us when the table was ready.  Hostess:  \"we don't do that.  Come back around 8:15.\"  Friend arrives back at apartment ten minutes later (6:15).  Phone:  \"brrring, brrrring! (okay, that's creative license.  He has a Nexus One so I'm sure the ring tone doesn't sound like that.)  Hello, this is Flour and Water (herewith referred to as \"Paste\").  We have a table right now.  Do you want it?\"  Friend:  (confused pause).  \"I thought you didn't call people when you had tables?\"  Paste: \"do you want the table or not?\"  Friend: \"No, since you told me there wouldn't be anything before 8:15, the rest of my party isn't here yet.\"\n\nCut to 8 pm.  We gather outside for the inevitable wait.  We realize that we are pawns on their chessboard - clearly having groups of people waiting on the sidewalk adds to the buzz factor.  Once we arrive they assure us of a table around 8:20, so they seem to deliberately have people who've reserved or put names on a list show up 15 - 20 minutes in order to amass hungry crowds.   The evening is warm, and there's plenty of sidewalk entertainment, all is well.  At 8:30, the troops start to get restless.  When I present myself at the hostess station to check on the status, the hostess ACTUALLY SAYS:  \"teehee, I made a terrible mistake and totally screwed up the order of seating.  I gave your table away.  Go ahead and yell at me, it's all my fault.  Tee hee, tee hee.\"  \n\nWhat the *&(^^*I?  \n\nWe wait a couple beats for her to add \"and we'll be comping you some drinks to make up for it, first pizza is on the house, etc., etc.\" but no such offer is forthcoming.  She does offer to \"move people around at the communal table and make some room (because they gave away the only table for six in the place)\" and we wait another 15 minutes for this to happen - which it doesn't -  at which point we realize the Paste folks think we are total tools and probably have a webcam streaming to the back room where the management is making bets on how long they can get people like us to wait.\n\nThe best part was when we gathered ourselves to leave, realizing that no food on earth could be worth the indignities we had suffered, the hostess chirped \"I'll go ask my manager if I can comp the drinks you had.\"  Umm - you thought we were gonna pay for those?  Actually, even better, I heard her deliver the same \"sorry, gave away your table, silly me, tee hee\" to another party that had been waiting at least as long as we had - and they had the same reaction we did.  So that's ten lost covers for one night (that we knew of, there were probably others), thank to the lame-o front of the house staff who can't keep (computerized) seating orders straight.  I guess Paste must be doing incredibly well if they can afford to lose that much business - although when we left at 9 pm on Saturday night there was no more line, so I guess they aren't doing as well as they used to be.  As one of my friends noted - great food, decent service from the actual servers, but totally not worth putting up with the bulls*&*t required to make it to the table, especially with all the great restaurants in the area.\n\nOn a brighter note, we walked around the corner to Universal Cafe, where all the staff from host to busboy to server seemed very happy to have us there, where we were seated promptly and with an outside table as we requested, and where we were treated really well throughout the course of the meal (which was totally outstanding, by the by).  Great service + great food - now there's a model Paste should consider!", "author": "Katy M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-08-05", "description": "I MADE A RESERVATION!  WHERE IS MY TABLE?\n \nFlour + Water is legendary for having a really long wait.  That is all you ever really hear about it honestly.  People are generally excited about the possibility of having dinner there so 3 weeks ahead of time I called and made a reservation.  I called and confirmed my reservation twice before our dinner for 4 people.\n \nThe four of us arrived to an empty hostess table and a packed restaurant.  We waited a few minutes to check in, not a big deal.  But once the hostess was back she explained that they \"had our reservation but for some reason didn't have a table for us.\"  No real apology and a rather glazed over look from the hostess.  Thank god another hostess came over to try to mend my nerves. She was nicer at least and seemed to care more, but I had to ask her to buy my friends a drink since they were all starving and we were told it would take 20 min to be seated. Its the least they should offer right?\n \nCUT TO 45min LATER WE ARE SEATED EVEN WITH A RESERVATION!\n \nOf course we inspected everything more carefully after having horrible service.\n \nThe Food\nThe portions are too small, unless you are having pizza.  All the food is good but nothing to write home about.  We even had a contest to see who would have the least amount of food once our meals arrived.  I won!  I had 8 pieces of raviolini (that means extra small ravioli - its a little larger than a quarter).  It was supposed to come with olives on top, I counted one olive.  Mind you with ravioli you can put whatever quantities of filling you want inside without anyone knowing, I wonder how much vitello was actually in mine?  I know I paid the same for my vitello inspired meal as the guy next to me who had vitello with pasta and I am almost certain I had less protein than him.\n \nThe Wine\nIts nonsense. The restaurant is supposed to be all locally sourced food but the wine list is entirely foreign.  One has to wonder what the margin is on the wine list.  When you don't know any of the brands on the list you can't guess at what the retail cost is so how do you know what the restaurant bought it for?  I wonder what their margins are here?\n \nOverall, this place believes its own hype.  Its packed lumberjack hipsters.  It is understaffed and they really push the envelope on getting the highest margin they can out of the food and wine.  Basically, its a sweatshop - few employees, very little food inventory - maximize your profits.\n \nIts an all around waste of time and money.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-06-02", "description": "Between the TV exposure and the reputation, there is alot of hype surrounding this restaurant which can always be a difficult thing to manage. We arrived expecting alot, especially given that we had to reserve over a month in advance. For those who aren't planners, they do reserve half of their tables for walk-ins. We were seated at a great table in the middle of the restaurant. It was mobbed on a Thursday night at 9pm. The space itself is beautiful and the restaurant is very lively. I started with the crispy smelt with asparagus etc. This was actually really good-  nice and light. The ingredients were very fresh. For my entree I had the Rigatoni with braised pork, onions and horseradish. I was so excited for this dish, but it fell flat. I could not detect the horseradish (which i love and was really what made me order this dish) and the pork had a bit of a slimy texture to it. It was also over salted. That being said, it was not inedible - just average. I finished with the panna cotta, which I would recommend - I just wish they had more of the candied olive. Service was ok for the most part. Hostess was great- server seemed disinterested. Overall, I had a nice time here and a good meal,. but I think the hype had you believe it was going to be life changing, and it simply wasn't.

For someone who doesn't like the wider sized pastas, the pappardelle was very well textured and flavorful. Pork shoulder that was in the mix wasn't over salty and was fine.  The yams were well toasted and were well done with butter. The pear soup served as a nice antipasto that complemented the complimentary bread well.  Overall, it was much to the liking of my palate with lighter flavors that didn't make me feel like I'd been making out with tomatoes, cheese and garlic.\n\nI had the chestnut cake with ice cream and that was very good. A nice flavor for the cold evening with the warm apples, pomegranate to complement brown butter ice cream and cake. I'm not a fan of chocolate, and had a tea spoon sized portion of the chocolate budino. It was a chocolate over-sensation and I definitely did not like it...I'm guessing if you like chocolate, it'd taste good.\n\nService was very nice here and everyone was very attentive to make sure everything was taken care of.

There was a line, but it moved quickly enough. Score 1 point for crowd control.\n\nThe atmosphere is definitely outer mission hipster, and I can't say I didn't enjoy it. We sat at the large table in the front of the restaurant by the window. They made it into a communal table to help seat more people, which was fine with us. The height of the bar stools are a little disproportionate to the height table, but I got used to it. Also, the front window needs some shades to block late afternoon sun - we baked in those seats until the sun went down.\n\nThe reputation of this place lies on the pizza. That is what we heard about before they even opened. They have a brick oven which only allows 4 pizzas to cook at a time, so your pizza order might take a while if it is crowded - but the pizzas are supposed to be artisan so I guess that is better than mass production.\n\nI found the pizzas to be just \"ok\". They have potential to be fabulous though. I think as a new restaurant they just need some time to fine tune and work out the kinks. We ordered the Margarita (sp?) pizza and it was good but there wasn't enough pizza love on it. For every one bite of love, I had 2 bites of bread.\n\nWe also had the pizza with prosciutto and  arugula on it. Not the first to make that combo, but it's a winning one. The only suggestion I had was to crisp the meat and greens on the pizza a little. I felt they were just layed on top after the pizza was cooked. Cut up the prosciutto, crisp it, and that pizza is a homerun.\n\nWe also ordered the beet salad, pork cheek, and squid pasta. I'm not a big fan of anything with squid ink in it but that pasta was actually quite wonderful. I'd get it again. We shared everything we ordered amongst each others, which is advisable here.

We received a positive surprise, though, when we got a table within ten minutes. The bar only has beer and wine, which is perfectly fine for fine dining, though, where in my opinion no hard liquor is needed. The food came at a good pace, was beautifully served, and tasted heavenly. From the 10 days I spent in California, this is definitely my best meal, and also at a very good price. I had expected a much higher bill for the experience we had. Thank you flour + water, and thank you to my friend who recommended it! The spring salad was a great start, pasta as a main, and then the chocolate dessert - delicious!!!", "author": "Miriam B."}

I asked my San Fransciscan hosts to direct me to one of the best restaurants in the City. flour + water was an immediate answer, and so I booked a reservation for Thursday night. I was more curious than hungry; before I head out to dinner where the actual dinner is slated to be the highlight of the night, I prepare myself for an other-worldly experience during which the food on my plate speaks to me and tells my stomach that I was in for undeniable pleasure.\n\nThe decor: Nothing I haven't seen before. The elevated table at the entrance is a nice touch, but the smaller tables were a bit too ensconced for my liking. Started off with the duck appetizer, which was insanely small, and moved on to the pasta. I had the agnolotti dal plin, which came in a sauce way too buttery for its own good; I dragged each piece along the edge of my plate to wipe off excess sauce. My dinner-mates chose the farro radiatore and strozzapreti, which were considerably better.\n\nStill hungry by the end of the pasta dishes, we decided to finish the meal with cozze pizza. The chilis overpowered the flavor profile and the mussels limply fell off each slice and had to be eaten with a fork.\n\nThe actual eating experience: I wasn't stopped in my tracks nor did I pause myself to think \"what did I just eat?\". My conversations with my friends went on uninterrupted and by the end of the night, we had \nforgotten what we had eaten just a few hours ago. \n\nThe saving grace: the outstanding service.", "author": "J K."}

Crust is perfectly light and thin, with just a little bit of crispiness to it. \n\nThe quality of the actual pasta was very, very good. Loved that they were homemade. We had the magliateli (?), which was super yummy, and the bucatini, whose sauce fell a little short. It was way too garlicky, making it taste like someone had accidentally thrown in a pinch of dish cleaner instead of a pinch of salt. Bleh.\n\nWe were rushed. I know, I know-- Flour + Water is a brand new restaurant and all they want right now is turn as many tables as they can. I get it. But with the exception of the hostess and the lady bartender, we were not impressed with the service. The hostess happened to be standing with her manager when I went to let her know that the rest of our party had arrived. Before I even finished my sentence, the guy curtly tells me that they'd be right with us. Ooo-kay. At least the hostess managed a smile. Table service was fine: attentive, but speedy in the wrong way. Having my plate cleared before the rest of the table is finished drives me nuts, and having the check dropped onto the table before asking if we'd like anything more is even worse.\n\nWith the exception of the art, the wooden tables, and the awesome cabinet of curiosities in the bathroom, the decor is kind of gross. Everything feels way too new and little bit cookie-cutter. Besides the bustling atmosphere, we felt like we were in some hum-drum suburban restaurant that should have been catered toward those in search of surf 'n' turf and not Italian cuisine. \n\nThe art on the walls by talented SF painter/printmaker Jessica Niello and the pizza are what saved this place for us. Two stars for pizza, one for the artwork.\n\nGood luck, guys. Hope your 'tude and your improves with age.", "author": "F H."}

The bartender has to tell nearly every person who excitedly hops onto an empty bar stool, poor girl.  Shouldn't the hostess tell people that as they arrive??\n\nSo, we waited about an hour (arrived at 10:00p on a Sat) and about 40 min into our wait I checked w/the hostess for our spot in line.  'there are only 2 more parties before you'.  OK, so we watched 2 parties be seated and then my date went to check with the hostess once more.  'there are only 2 more parties before you'.   hmmm.?.   How does this girl keep track?  Does she just tell everyone that ?  grmph.  (I will add, I feel my suspicions were confirmed when I witnessed another women receive the same response from the hostess pretty much right after I had asked..)  Anyway, so finally we were seated at the communal table--after watching 3 more parties be seated. \n\nIt's hard to turn your mood around after such a long, hungry, uncomfortable, maddening wait (and add to that, the drunk guy who spilled his red wine all over us from across the communal table), but our server was darling.  She did forget the side of chard, but she had a really good attitude and i feel she was the highlight of our experience.  The food was fine.

I will just make a blanket statement that the interior design/layout, staff professionalism and quality of service, and atmosphere were all above standard. We were pleased.\n\nNow the food. Here are all the things I was able to sample:\n\nAsparagus Salad: \nQuite tasty combination of flavors. Tangy, Salty, Crunchy and Tender. I liked how the asparagus was cut (ribbons). I'd recommend this if you want a fresh starter.\n\nPea Soup\nA cold soup made with fresh peas and mint, little cheese on the bottom. The soup base was extremely smooth and refined. Tasty and worth trying if you like cold soups. Unfortunately for me it was very oily and all that light refined texture started to get lost in the oil. Perhaps it being a cold soup amplified this effect. \n\nProsciutto Pizza\nThe new classic that I see all over the city since the early Pizzaiolo days. F+L did it right - pizza was quite good, especially the crust. We finished the whole pie fast and while speaking and watching others, I think the pies were a hit. I would try the egg pizza if I went back again. I would encourage the chef to add a couple of more innovative options in this section of the menu however. It felt like they were meeting the high standard of pizza in SF, perhaps copying some, but not expanding on it with new items.\n\nCorzetti Stampati pasta\nThis was a squid ink pasta that came in big medallion-shaped sheets with squid and beans. Excellently done. Smokey and rich flavor that worked well with the squid. They make the pasta in house and I think their pastas were the most stand-out item on the menu. Unless you are craving pizza, I would definitely order pasta if you order only one thing here.\n\nBudino:\nA decadent chocolate pudding with a bit of crunchy salt. Also very tasty and recommended. I am used to a budino that is hot and more like a molten cake rather than literally pudding, but this version worked. If you are into chocolate you won't be let down.\n\nWine: \nWe just got glasses of the Calabria for dinner that paired well and was very tasty. I'm not too versed with Italian wines, but when it settles down a bit at the restaurant, I would definitely go back for just after work drinks and explore the menu more with friends.", "author": "Shane W."}

The pasta dishes came in tiny portions and had no distinct flavor.\n\n1. I ordered the Ricotta caramelle with morels hoping I would have a mushroom-licious taste sensation. This did not happen. The thing oddly tasted like potatoe and parsley and failed to impress. It tasted ok although the morels where tasteless and dissapointing.\n\n2. I also tried my friends dishes at the table. The mussel pasta for one did not have much flavor and I could probably do better myself at home without paying $16 for a tiny plate.\n\n3. The Margarita pizza with added arugula was ok, nothing spectacular at all an not worth any raving reviews. I know for a fact that making my own pizza with dough from Whole Foods I can do so much better.\n\n4. As a dessert we got the chocolate bolino with seasalt.

Napolitana is cooked for a very short time -- no more than 90 seconds -- and as a result it stays chewy. \n\nThe pappardelle were perfectly al dente and the sauce tasted exactly right. The small amount of duck that was there had been broiled and had crispy bits, which were delicious. \n\nUnfortunately, there were only a few little shreds of duck and almost no pieces of mushroom, and this is the reason they lose two stars. At $17 for this pasta, it ought to have a good quantity of both duck and mushrooms. \n\nFor dessert we had the chocolate budino and it was great.

There is a walk-in communal table that seats five couples if you really gotta get in without a reservation.\n\nThe service is really good.  I'll agree with some reviews that the wine service is almost nonexistent, with the casual pouring thing, but I can't complain when the corkage is $10.  I'll pour my own wine rather than pay more than double at some places.\n\nLet's get to the food... excellent, excellent pasta!  It's really fresh and you can tell right off the bat that everything is fresh and homemade.  The Bigoli with Fresh Butter Beans, Tomato and Pancetta was out of this world, easily the best pasta I've ever tasted.  No, I haven't set foot in Italy, at least not yet, but I now have a measuring stick for when I do visit.\n\nAs for the pizza, it was good, even above-average.  (see my Pizzeria Picco review for my favorite thin crust.)  The crust had a nice crust and crispy, but it was missing that authentic wood-oven flavor that I'm always after.  Even so, everyone around us seemed to enjoy they Margherita.  We opted for the Parma (ricotta, fior di latte, cerignola olives & prosciutto di parma.)\n\nOverall, a winner.  I can't wait to go back and try some of the more daring options, like braised goat pasta or lamb tongue salad.  Definitely recommended.", "author": "Adrian G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-22", "description": "Thursday we found ourselves in the Mission, looking for dinner a little on the late side. We stumbled, soaked and shivering, into Flour+Water, where we were treated to one of the best meals I've had recently. Of course I had heard the hype, the great things from people who would know, but as a result I almost expected to be disappointed. Happily, my preconceptions did not get in the way of enjoying a stunningly good dinner. \n\nWe were seated immediately by a fairly pleasant hostess, but had to wait a bit before seeing our otherwise friendly waiter. They've done a great job using candlelight and warm woods to create an intimate but casual atmosphere, although I suspect at peak times it might feel crowded. At ten pm on a Thursday, it was relaxed and welcoming. \n\nWe were offered still and sparkling water, both on tap and complimentary (as it should be). Perusing the wine list revealed a good selection of hard to find Italian wines at very accessible prices ($30-$90). By the glass the choices are fewer, but well curated so that every dish and palate can be satisfyingly matched. Their beer selection is small but includes some standouts, like the Linden St. Brewery Black Lager I drank with my meal. \n\nWe decided to start with pastas, skipping the admittedly tempting pork trotter appetizer. I had to have the squid ink spaghetti with clams, squid, watermelon radish and chili oil. I had not had a squid ink pasta since a sublime experience at Rafael, in Lima, so ordering it was my challenge to Flour+Water. The spaghetti was beautiful, dark as night and fragrant with brine and the musky depth of the ink. The texture of the pasta was a perfect al dente, just firm enough to slightly resist my teeth, and the each noodle was silky. It tasted like wet earth and the sea, as poetic as that may sound. Despite being a seafood pasta, it was quite rich. The minimal sauce of ink and seafood juices was just enough to coat the pasta without obscuring the extraordinary flavor and texture of the pasta itself. Perfectly cooked clams and squid provided a nice textural counterpoint to the noodles. The one element that seemed to get lost was the chili oil, since I did not detect any spice whatsoever. It would have been nice to have a bright chili taste to cut the richness just a little, but to be honest I only thought this after the meal. While enjoying the decadence of this phenomenal dish, I thought of little else but my pleasure.\n\nMy friends had rosemary pappardelle with braised veal and a prosciutto, braised cabbage, fontina, potato and red onion pizza. The pappardelle was again texturally perfect, further evidence of Flour+Water's clear mastery of pastas. Paired with the veal, the dish was light but incredibly savory. My first impression was that the rosemary was overpowering, but as I chewed and swallowed the mild, almost sweet veal created a perfect balance with the astringency of the rosemary. My mouth felt completely alert after tasting this dish, and I would order it again in a minute. Unfortunately for this review, I did not taste the pizza, but it looked delicious and my friend quite enjoyed it. \n\nWe all split a root vegetable gratin, which was everything gratin should be: creamy and loaded with butter. The root vegetables added a twist to the usual butter and potatoes gratin, making it more complex and even richer in flavor, if that can be believed. I felt like I could hear Thomas Keller extolling the virtues of butter in the background with every bite I took. Trust me that this is a good thing. \n\nWe ended with a good macchiato and chocolate budino; a dense, almost fudgy pudding. This was explosively good, with just enough sea salt to make your mouth salivate and just enough bitterness from the chocolate. It was topped with a coffee caramel whipped cream that would have made me happy on its own. The flavors were perfect, though I would have preferred a slightly less dense consistency for the budino itself. Ultimately it made my mouth so happy that this small concern was just that. \n\nIn conclusion, I would like to dispel the idea that this restaurant is somehow overpriced or does not provide value for money. Neither of these assertions is true. The portions were plenty, neither precious nor grotesque. I was honestly surprised that the bill for three people's meals, a side, dessert, coffee and five beers came out to a modest $30 per person. Considering the stellar quality of the food, good service and elegant surroundings, Flour+Water is one of the more affordable choices at its level. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates perfect pasta, a good glass of wine and that uniquely Californian aesthetic of well-executed casual elegance.\n\nI loved Flour+Water, and I will be returning as often as possible.\n\nBuon Appetito!", "author": "Sofia O."}

They had been here previously and my husband and I were interested in checking it out during a walk around the neighborhood earlier in the day. I was amazed to learn that if you did not have a reservation, the wait can be quite long. Even during the week. We all met up around 6pm and the wait was well over an hour. Or maybe an hour and a half. But we killed time at a spot not too far away for happy hour. They send you a text letting you know 10 minutes before your table is ready which I thought was interesting. Anyway, this place was packed. But not so cramped that you're on top of everyone else. Very cool space and lots of natural light. Service was good and attentive. My husband and I got a salad and we also shared a pizza. We really enjoyed our meal and our salad was probably the best part of it. The pizza was good too and the portion size was perfect enough for the two of us to finish. But that salad was amazing! I was intrigued by the pastas and how different they were.

That experience was  positive although we weren't wowed with the food.  We decided to give them another chance as they are close to home and judging a place by their first weeks in business doesn't always present a true picture. \n\nWe arrived shortly before they opened to find a line already a dozen people deep.  The hostess was annoyed that we were only two.  Do they not get couples on dates?  She insisted we share a table with strangers.  We don't mind doing that sometimes but neither of us were in the mood, so I suggested we sit at the bar instead.  Ms Hostess person couldn't contain her dismay that I suggested something that wasn't her idea, responding with \"if you must.\"  \n\nThe food this trip was just ok.  Not great and certainly not consistent with the prices charged.   The pizza was a soggy mess.  Enough said.  \n\nWhat was intolerable was the service.  Our server was arrogant and extremely condescending.  Husband ordered wine.  He didn't review the list in depth and simply asked for a cabernet.  The server gave an eye roll and proceeded to lecture him about wine instead of just suggesting the wine closest to his request.  Husband grabbed the list and just picked one at random.  The servers failure to suggest a choice is in my opinion shirking his job, especially since we were seated at the bar and he could have easily asked for assistance from the bartender if needed.    He then looked at me and asked \"a bottle?\"  I said no I wouldn't be imbibing.  He huffed and walked off without asking me if I'd like something else.  I had to obtain my beverage from the bartender.  The kitchen took forever to produce the food and when it was delivered the server dropped it unceremoniously and bounded off.  We didn't see him again until we asked the bartender to obtain our check.  It too was dropped off with a huff.  \n\nThere are just too many restaurants in this town that are hollow food hype and zero service.  We could have forgiven the food ... it wasn't terrible. The service isn't forgivable. I find it interesting that most negative restaurant reviews are less about the food and more about the quality of service.  We won't be bothering to wait in line for Flour & Water again.  The food simply isn't good enough to put up with the crappy service.  We often return to restaurants where the food isn't five star simply because the service is friendly and our patronage is appreciated.

I ordered the side of roasted persimmons with chanterelles and found the persimmons were quite bland. It seemed like a seasonal kitsch menu item that they didn't put much into. I think A16 is the best and Pizzeria Delfina is the best bang for your buck.", "author": "Sophia L."}

The staff here is so friendly and although the wait for a table can be a bit long on busy nights (which is every night), it's definitely worth it and the atmosphere is so cozy and lively that I never mind waiting - even if it's for an hour or more. The food really is THAT good. It's flawless. I go here often and always continue to be impressed.

Scurrying along the Jr. Yelpers and the rooster to get out of the house while shouting, \"Hurry up, hurry up, we have reservations and it's hard to find parking in the Mish\". \n\nWell, parking was a breeze at 5:20PM. Because it's so popular, F+W leaves you no choice but to dine at the geriatric hour. We could tell we were near the restaurant as a line of patrons were snaking out the door, around the corner, waiting for the restaurant to open, at the geriatric hour. \n\nThe front door staff were very friendly, even the girl with multiple facial piercings, 2 on her lip/chin. \nThe biggest compliment I have about this place is that they have the most wonderful staff working here, hats off to management for their training and hiring skills. Can you teach the folks at Liguria Bakery about manners too? \n\nThe ambiance is quite casual. 2 very long community dining tables up front, against the wall and clusters for 4 somes stretching to the back. They seem to only have 1 toilet for the women, I tried to get in to check it out but with 2 in queue for \"a long time\", I left. \nOur waitress, Samantha was so sweet and attentive. She checked back often. I didn't have the heart to tell her when I didn't like a dish as I didn't want her to take it personally. She was that nice. \n\nWe started off with 2 pizzas: the carbonara was the best with crispy bacon, hen of the woods mushrooms (Jr Yelpers didn't like, citing \"these aren't  the mushrooms we're used to\"), pea tendrils all draped with a thick saucy egg emulsion, $17. It was different, but good. The osso, which the other waiter delivered to our table and said it was his fav, was not a hit with us, $16. The fontina cheese was good but the rabe leaves and horseradish gave it a very peculiar taste. I had to beg the JYs to try a piece of the circular marrow scattered over the pizza which they said tasted like \"fat\". We didn't finish this one but took it home. \n\nThe food is shared family style. I didn't like my black cod , a 3x2inch piece of oversalted, crispy pan grilled fillet, so moist and cooked just right, but as soon as it was placed on the table, I was overwhelmed by the fishy odor. \"Not fresh\" I said to myself, shouldn't smell like that, not for $12. \nJY's maltagliati (flat, triangular pasta) served with pork sausage and kale was the hit, $16. We all wanted more. Hubby's roasted pork w/chard, potatoes (they loved the potatoes), chanterelles and cherry (they liked the tart/sour cherries too) was OK, $24. It was cooked with some pink (the table next to us sent theirs back for well done) was very tough. I couldn't cut it w/my knife and it was chewy. I'd skip this next time. The contorni - sauteed spigarello w/chili, lemon, sprinkled w/ricotta, $6, was like crunchy long watercress, spicy, salty, was good. \nThey finished off the baby oven roasted carrots/fennel, $6. \n\nWe shared the infamous choc budino, topped with a large dollop of espresso-caramel cream, sprinkled with sea salt, $8. The choc was wonderful, like a thick pot de creme. The chunky salt particles were a distraction to the dish, finishing your palate with a salty taste when your brain tells you it should be sweet. We'd probably ask them to hold the salt next time, not good for your blood pressure anyways. \nHappy Father's Day!!", "author": "Ry T."}

We were 10 minutes early for our reservation and got seated right away.  The staff was friendly and personable.  We didn't know where to start, so the waiter helped us out and made recommendations.  (That is becoming my favorite way to order, ask the waiter - they know what's good!) The food was delicious.  The ingredients were not simple, some I didn't know what they were, but they were assembled with a simplicity that allowed you to taste each item.  For example, taleggio scarpinocc with aceto balsamico - it was a simple pasta with some sort of balsamic sauce.  Yum.  I asked for bread to soak it up.  My husband had the sunchoke and mushroom soup - also wonderful.  The pork trotters were a nice appetizer, too.  We also tried the cappellacci dei briganti with rabbit polpettine & mustard greens and it was delicious, too. We finished up with a margherita pizza - tomato, basil, fior di latte & extra virgin olive oil.  It was so fresh and delicious.  We took two pieces home and had it for breakfast with an egg.  For dessert, we had the budino and I also thought it was good.  It was pretty rich but it ended the meal very nicely.  \n\nWe lucked into the 7:15 reservations.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-09-14", "description": "Disappointing experience in nearly every respect.\n\nA couple friends (husband & wife) came to S.F. for the weekend, and at their suggestion, my wife & I joined them for dinner at Flour + Water (two married couples = 4-top).\n\nPrior to arriving, our friends reserved a 2-top on the mistaken assumption that we had conflicting plans.  After learning we were indeed free for dinner, our friends asked us to join them at F+W, and we phoned the restaurant to ask if we could revise the reservation. Our first call to F+W rolled to voicemail, so we left a message outlining our request and asked for a return call to let us know yea or nay.  After receiving no reply, we phoned again the following day (the day of our dinner plans).  Again our call rolled to voicemail, and we left a similar message asking for a call-back with a quick yes or no (or maybe).  For reasons as-yet unknown, the staff at F+W never bothered to return our call.  We would not have been upset had they phoned to say they could not accommodate our request.  And we likewise would not have minded had they phoned to say they wouldn't know until dinnertime whether they could accommodate us, but inviting us to turn our reservation into a walk-in visit.  However, absent a responsive phone call, we adopted an optimistic attitude, and headed over to F+W to meet the initial reservation time (9:00 pm).\n\nWe thus arrived at F+W shortly before 9:00 pm last Thursday.  Upon checking in with the hostess, we were informed that F+W had no knowledge of our messages, and that a 4-top was not immediately available, but that if we wished to wait, we would be seated when a 4-top opened up.  The hostess indicated that our table would not be available for 45 minutes or an hour, and invited us to step outside to wait; or in the alternative, we could stroll to a nearby bar for cocktails while waiting.  [I should note that waiting in the bar at F+W was not possible, as the actual bar is used by walk-in diners, and the remaining space was full to capacity.]  We accepted the reality with equanimity, and told the hostess we would kill time at a nearby bar, and be back in 45 minutes.  And in case a table opened sooner, we left a mobile phone number for the hostess's convenience.  We thus killed 45 minutes at a nearby German bar/restaurant.  We returned at the designated time, and the hostess informed us that a table had just opened up, but since we weren't present, she'd given it to another group of 4.  By this time, we were annoyed, but having invested the time we opted to wait for the next table.  The bar had cleared out enough that we could stand inside and have drinks.  \n\nThe hostess kindly offered a wine list, and I perused it for a decent bottle of red wine.  I browsed the wine list in search of a recognizable bottle, but to my mild annoyance, found that F+W stocks only Italian wines, and rather obscure ones at that.  I don't want to be petty, but c'mon folks, we're minutes away from one of the finest wine producing regions in the world.  Is it really too much to ask that F+W offer a few California wines for the benefit of local wine-lovers?  I understand F+W is an Italian restaurant, so it is entirely reasonable that their wine list would heavily feature Italian wines.  But to feature only obscure Italian wines (wines that even a well educated wine drinker will know nothing of), and zero California wines, makes sense only if the owners of F+W are deliberately seeking to push wines that they're confident most guests will not recognize, which in turn enables the restaurant to extract a heftier markup on each bottle.  \n\nWe were thus obliged to seek advice on a wine suggestion.  The hostess (apparently there is no sommelier) was equally ignorant of F+W's wines, but we ultimately settled on a tolerable bottle of red.\n\nWe were ultimately seated at a 4-top (an hour and a half after first arriving), and our server promptly introduced himself.  The introduction was helpful, as the waitstaff is apparently free to dress as they see fit, so they are indistinguishable from the guests.  Our server seemed aware of our ordeal, and made a genuine effort to improve our experience (to the extent there was a highlight, it was the server's attention to detail).\n\nThe food was mostly good, but unremarkable.  The capresso style salad was surprisingly ordinary.  A sausage & pepper pizza was interesting -- until I bit into a large anchovy that  I didn't notice in the description (nothing against anchovies, it was just a surprise, and it didn't really work with the other flavors).  Next was a bland strozapretti pasta.  For dessert, I ordered the boudino w/ sea salt, which I'd seen praised in reviews.  It was so heavily laden with salt as to be inedible.  At a proper restaurant, a dish this obviously wrong would not make it out of the kitchen.  \n\nBottom line:  San Francisco has far too many great restaurants to bother with a place like F+W.  The experience was disappointing in virtually every respect.", "author": "S. K."}

I figured I'd go back and review places that have either blown my mind, or left me wanting more... Flour and Water - I want MORE. Like others before me, the wait is outrageous to get a reservation.  We booked 6 WEEKS out to get a Saturday night reservation for 4 people, and even then it was 8:45 PM. Fine, but I was expecting some \"blow your damn socks off pizza and pasta\".  The only thing that was blown was our food budget for the month (OK, our friend's budget - since he treated us), but the bill was over $300!! including our 2 bottles of wine.  I don't know about anyone else, but I think that is outrageous considering we got 2 pizzas (both were good, but no better than Delfina or even Beretta), a pasta with mushrooms (I admit was tasty but really salty) and some pork entree with 3 different kinds of pork (Since when did a little a$$ sausage count?), and a salad with fennel that was too small to share for 4 people.\n\nI say, Bleh - not worth the wait, or the calories.

After reviewing the menu, we were ready at least to order an appetizer (the rabbit shoulder with chicories, saba, and walnuts)  This had a distinct flavor and tangy isn't quite it, but comes close.  We were pushed to order our main course immediately, which made me feel like our waiter was more concerned about turning our spot over as fast as possible as opposed to making sure we enjoyed ourselves.  We ordered the margarita pizza when prompted, and unfortunately it came out to us just a few minutes after the appetizer.  We had little time to enjoy the pre-dinner taste.  \nThe pizza was great, very good, nice size, very tasty sauce, and the crust was perfect.  \nThe wine we had with dinner was a Tempranillo, and was quite good with the pizza.  \nDessert was had by both of us.  I chose the ricotta Meyer lemon cake and he had the chocolate budino with caramel and sea salt.

I pulled up and my girlfriend ran in to see if their was a wait. It was our anniversary and we had a reservation elsewhere, but wanted to see if maybe we were in luck to get into flour + water, a place we had been waiting to try for a while. The hostess said that she had two seats for us, so I parked, called to cancel our other reservation, and ran in not 30 seconds later, but apparently the restaurants owner had asked for the two seats at the bar to be saved for them to come by and eat dinner. So we lost our seats, but were told that it would be less than 20 minutes to get seated again. We waited for 45 minutes, the whole time the seats at the bar that were originally going to be ours, stayed unoccupied. We started getting hungry and were getting up to leave, but then magically, a table opened up! We were seated, given some water and our menus, and then were left unattended for another 15 minutes. We looked around and waved, but no waitress ever came by to speak to us. It was frustrating, but eventually a very friendly server came over and took our order. The frito misto was really good, highly recommended plate of fried things with a delicious aoli sauce. next was the pasta, which i think lives fully up to the hype. we had strozzapreti verde with braised quail, roasted apple & rosemary that was beautiful and light. the pasta was perfectly done. we also had the garganelli with braised pork, red russian kale & celery root which was a bit heavier, but the garganelli looked like fern tips and tasted delicious and chewy. the pizza was disappointing and very salty. we had the formaggi with 4 types of cheeses. the crust was burnt in parts that made it inedible, and this is coming from someone who used to live off of coal oven pizza in new york, so i like my pizza with a char, but the crust just didn't hold up. we passed on dessert and left. the service was nice when it showed up, but circumstances really soured the experience and the exceptional pastas.", "author": "Michael J."}

Food is definitely 4 stars, appreciate it, but I fully understand why Yelp has a 3.5.\n\nLet me preempt my comments on portion with: 1. I don't mind small portions and 2. I love to order lots of dishes to dry different things and almost always over order and I don't think this restaurant is too expensive, price range is fine. \n\nI think it isn't that the portions are small that is the problem, it's more so the inconsistency to your expectations.  This is what I mean, pizza portions, completely normal compared to other places like Delfina or Beretta.  Pasta portions, one of the smallest I've ever seen.  Because the pasta dishes are smaller than what you expect, you end up getting tricked into thinking all dishes are small.  That's how we felt after our first pasta dish came out and we thought it was an appetizer!!!  Even though the whole meal ended up being not expensive at all!!!  We actually talked about this at dinner how your reaction to portion was normal/tiny/normal/tiny the whole night as the dishes came out. I think this is a terrible tradeoff the restaurant is making because when a portion deviates a lot from the norm in your mind, it psychologically makes you a bit less satisfied and it permeates to your enjoyment of the actual food. Reading the rest of the reviews, most complained of small portion + bland food, when in reality it is okay to good food and inconsistent portions.  \n\nWe had 7 dishes total: 2 apps, 2 pasta, 3 pizzas for a group of five.  Our original plan was 2 apps, 2 pasta, 2 pizzas and 2 desert but as I said, after our first pasta came out looking like an appetizer, we got the \"oh shit every entree will be tiny\" syndrome and got another pizza, and ended up not finishing and skipping desert!\n\nNow the dishes: out of 7, I was impressed with 1, meets expectations with 4, 1 meh, and didn't like 1. \nLoved - Eggplant & treccione mezzaluna, but was literally 8 pieces of pasta, we each had 1-2 pieces, but I loved this pasta\nMeets expectations - fig salad with lardo, squid and melon salad, mushroom pizza, sausage pizza\nMeh - eggplant pizza: olive flavor overwhelms, can taste some eggplant but the mesh of flavors not impressive, very meh\nDid not like - tagliarini with braised rabbit, pasta too infused with meat flavor, too gamey for me (of five of us, 1 did not like, 2 meh, 2 likes but not loves)\n\nOverall, I prefer Delfina pizza to here.

The blistered peach salad was wonderful...we tried it with and without pancetta and it definitely loses something without the meat, according to my dinner companion (sadly, as I am a pesceterian).  \n\nThe pasta is also perfect....elegant delicate noodles with lovely, creative sauces.  The eggplant cappelletti is fabulous and my friends loved the maltagliati with giblet ragu.  The bigoli with beans and pancetta was also a hit.  The servings are a bit small, though.\n\nThe pizza was far from perfect.  The thin crust has one dimensional taste, and was partially burned (some people like it that way, I know I know).  The margherita pizza was soggy, actually...kind of floppy, and light on the cheese.  We also tried the squid pizza.  The toppings were creative but really, they didn't cover the crust properly.  \n\nWe did not try dessert.  This is a must return for starters, salad, and pasta (dessert next time).", "author": "Thelma Lee G."}

The combination of glowing / mixed reviews I had seen made me think it could have been a sham; that the trendiness factor had taken over the buzz and that the food wouldn't deliver.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nWith the exception of the starter gorgonzola / arugula thing (which was still good), each dish we had was absolutely stellar. The pizza's dough was seemingly a combination of all textures- rough on the outside, set beneath and almost sticky on the inside. The pork on top was full of flavor but not overly salty.\n\nThe pasta dishes we had couldn't have been more different from one another. The first, a farfalle with duck, or whatever, packed a major punch with the rich flavor. The pasta, which functioned more of a casing for the meat, was just warm enough to the taste. There was an earthiness to the meat that was very exciting.\n\nI don't want to sound weird, but I swear I had like an evolutionary flash-back to men eating meat in caves. I mean the thing almost tasted alive.\n\nThe second pasta, some tomato w garlic thing, actually matched the first in terms of flavor, though I still don't exactly know how. All I can say is that the pasta itself was thin and the tomatoes brought it big time. It was lighter, but it was great.\n\nThe dessert was a chocolate pudding with some type of salt placed on top. They complimented each other very well. Very light.\n\nOne last thing about the food:\n\nI feel like a lot of the trending upscale Italian restaurants, like Delfina and Farina, do a really good job at keeping things light and fresh, but can sometimes lose a little bit of the oomph that some of the more classic spots offer in terms of flavor. What I loved about Flour and Water is that it offered very unique, tasty and memorable dishes and did so without being overly heavy. A noteworthy feat.\n\nService was attentive, great. They managed to seat us without a reservation in an un-obscene amount of time and were cool about offering drinks even though they were busy.\n\nBravo.", "author": "Matt T."}

With each successive visit, the experience gets progessively worst.  \n\nThe pizzas are pretty good it you eat them right away.  Because the crust is too thin to hold the sauce and toppings, everything falls apart if  the pizza sits for longer than a few minutes.  The bean appetizer was overly salty to the point of being unedible.  The raviolis were so undercooked that it was like chewing gum.  The other pastas were lackluster.\n\nThis latest dinner was hosted by my sister.  When she saw that F&W added tax to the corkage fee, she deducted the tax and tipped accordingly.  The owner thought the tip was too small and stated such to my sister.  He even followed our family out to the street to complain about the tip.  Talk about rude!  My whole family was shocked by the owner's  surly and condescending behavior.   There are so many  restaurants in SF with better food  where they will actually treat their customers with graciousness, SKIP THIS ONE! \n\nF&W is an over-hyped, overpriced, underwhelming dining experience.

This place is still totally booked on OpenTable, but we managed to get one about a month ago. It was for 8:45, but we didn't get seated until 9:10ish. By that time we were starving and starting to get cranky, but luckily Julia, the hostess, saved us. She was sweet enough to give us updates on how the table was coming along, and she comped us the first round of drinks when we were seated late. She was a doll and literally saved our evening. The server wasn't quite so friendly, and it appeared that she was serving half the restaurant as her tables were all over the place, so I sort of understand her abruptness. But the food was delicious, and we really enjoyed it. I had a beek cheek orechiette that was off the pasta tasting menu, and it was glorious. I would have taken a bath in there if I could have.

I was sad to find out that they had no vegetarian pasta on their menu and they refused to customize it. Anyways, since my husband eats chicken, we ordered a margarita pizza and \"hen\" pasta. The pizza was bland, no flavor. Pasta was ok. It was stuffed with chicken and came in a broth. After that we ordered their famous dessert with chocolate, expresso cream and sea salt. I didn't like it that much. Overall, for me the food was not good. I was comparing the food with Zero-Zero which is another Italian restaurant in SOMA that I often go to.

(It's Flour + Water. You'll find someone.) That's what I did the first time I came here.  \n\nSpeaking of reservations, this place is super pretentious. Most popular, higher-end restaurants will call you and, if you don't answer, leave a message saying they want to confirm your reservation and to please call them if you can't make it.  Flour + Water calls you and makes you call them back, regardless of whether or not you still plan on going. When you do that, you have to listen to a 5-minute answering machine message before you can finally \"press 3\" (or whatever) and leave them a message saying you can still make it. Minus one star.\n\nOn my first visit to the restaurant, we had reservations for 7pm. We got there around 645 and were told that the people were finishing up and our table should be ready at 7. Sure, no problem, we're early anyway. At 715, we go up to the hostess and ask about our table. She says the people still aren't done and motions toward the table we're waiting for. She says it shouldn't be more than 10 more minutes. It looks like two people on a date. They're done with their food, have paid the bill, and the guy is just sitting there drinking water. Fifteen more minutes pass and the guy is still drinking his water. Meanwhile, all sorts of tables for four are getting up, and all of these groups with later reservations are sitting down because they all have parties of three or four.  (Okay, I get it, there's just two of us, so you don't want to give us a table for four.)  All of the other tables for two have pretty much just started their meals.  At 8, an hour after our reservation, I tell the hostess, as politely as I can, that our wait has been pretty much bullshit. The couple has been done with their food for over 45 minutes and are just taking up a table in the tiny-ass restaurant. She agrees, but says there really isn't anything she can do about it, and points out that the waiter has stopped refilling the guy's water glass. Finally, at 815, the asshole couple gets up and leaves. I'm tempted to trip him on his way out. Minus another star. (I understand that there really isn't much the restaurant can do with regard to asking the asshole couple to leave, but they could have given us one of the larger tables ,or a free glass of wine, or something. An extra hour wait is ridiculous.)\n\nThat trip, at least the food (and service) was good, even though the portions were/are tiny and my cousin, who eats like a bird and always has a ton of leftovers, finished everything.\n\nThe second time I went, my friend had made the reservation, and invited me after her boyfriend was called out of town last minute.  Again, we were seated after our reservation time, but only by about 10 minutes. (I think I would have thrown a fit if it had been any longer.)\n\nThe food wasn't as good this time.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't spectacular. And our pizza was burned.  Not just a little charred for crispness (like you see at a lot of places)--burned enough that you could taste it and it made the pizza taste bad. We mentioned it to the waiter, and he said that was the way they cook their pizza. Well, the first time I was there, we had the pizza, it had burned spots on the crust, but you couldn't taste it. Minus a star.\n\nAs difficult as it is to get into this place, and considering all the hype surrounding it, I just don't think it's worth it.  The pasta's just as good at Delfina.  And the pizza is better at Pizzeria Delfina and Pizzetta 211.", "author": "D E."}

Not really what you want to list as the best things, but oh well. The appetizers did not even look good enough to order one. Then we ordered the Margherita Pizza. The results...an overpriced pizza. It was a thin crusted pizza with zero flavor. The best part of the pizza was drizzling the delicious olive oil over it. Then we ordered the Nettle Triangoli. I realize mushrooms are a key in this dish, but the taste was too bland. Maybe more cheese or a little truffle taste would have added a nice variation. I don't know. The brussel sprouts were very nice. Added with some cheese and peppers for heat made these little veggies yummy. Too bad they came as a very small side. Then for dessert...nothing. I love dessert and could not find something I would enjoy. Overall the staff seemed lackluster in their jobs, which just made us bored. The price was almost $60. Should have spent the money on sushi or shabu instead. It would have been more enjoyable. I hate spending money for food that is nothing special. I'd at least like to enjoy it.

It wasn't a surprise when the hostess told us an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes.  We discussed going to Shotwell's down the street for a few cocktails, but settled on ordering a bottle of wine at the restaurant and either sitting on the bench out front or hovering in the bar or front window area.   After killing a bottle of red between the 3 of us, the hostess told us our table was just about ready; thank God - - we were STARVING.\n\nWe sit down and I immediately noticed that latest Yeah Yeah Yeah's album playing in the background.  I'm a sucker for restaurants/cafes that play awesome music!  Right off the bat, we asked for bread and one of us orders another glass of wine.  It took a good 10-15 minutes and asking another server for our bread.  The wine then arrives later.  \n\nOur server was nice and made plenty of recommendations, but she was SUPER slow.  We decided to order everything she recommended:\n\n-Local yellowtail with radishes, meyer lemon aioli, avocado and blood oranges.  (just okay, tasted okay if you took bites separately of all the ingredients, but didn't blend well together at all. Fish was a bit too fishy and not so fresh tasting either)\n-Topinambur pizza  with spicy ham, sunchokes, taleggios, hen of the wood mushrooms, and fior de latte. (Delicious, probably the best pizza I've ever had; didn't even think about ranch dressing for one second)\n-The pasta special, which was basically stuffed shells with some pork ragu and a lighter green-ish pesto sauce (pretty good, but definitely not the winner of the table) \n-Seared chicken breast & stuffed leg with saut\u00e9ed \nspinach, soft polenta, green olives & pinenuts (OMG, cooked to perfection, it was a juicy and delicious piece of chicken, stuffed with the most amazing polenta and olives and the pine nuts gave it a nice crunchy texture.

People should come to this restaurant expecting simplicity and authenticity, but executed beautifully.  The restaurant has garnered national attention as a finalist for the James Beard award for Best New Restaurant (winners have yet to be announced as of press time).  Raise your expectations.  The restaurant reserves half the restaurant for reservations and half for walk-ins.  Be prepared to wait awhile or place your reservation WAY in advance.  Or reserve for nonstandard times (i.e., 10pm), which is what I did on my first visit here.  \n\nFood:  5 stars.  If this is your first visit, you have to try the pizzas and pastas.  Flour + water arguably makes some of the best in the City.  The menu changes daily, so it'll be hard to ever pull yourself away from the thin crust pizzas and house made pastas to try one of the entrees, as I found on both of my visits.  I would agree with La Bauer's statement that chef Thomas McNaughton is a \"master at pasta and wood-fired pizza, and the desserts are just as good.\"  The osso pizza (roasted bone marrow, fontina, rabe leaves and fresh horseradish) will impress you with the exuberant flavors created by the marriage of such nonstandard ingredients.  For pastas, the seafood stuffed cappelletti verde with prosecco, fennel and mussels is soft, delicate and delicious.  The minted tagliatelle with english peas and tendrils is ribbon after ribbon of creamy goodness.  For dessert, the chocolate budino with espresso-caramel cream and sea salt is a must - a perfect balance of salty and sweet.\n\nService:  4 stars.  La Bauer mentions that \"the staff treats everyone like family.\"  If that were the case, the hostess must have forgotten the memo.  She wasn't rude or anything, but perhaps she was just too busy that night to exude warmth.  However, the rest of the staff were friendly and the kitchen seems to be having a good time.  I also thought our server was knowledgable and gave us spot on recommendations - I probably wouldn't have ordered the osso pizza if it weren't for her, but I'm glad I did.\n\nAtmosphere:  3 stars.

There are certain whimsical elements (i.e., the biology display in the restroom) that give the space a little personality as well.

I didn't really get an \"Italian Restaurant\" kind of feel from it, but it was it's own style and I appreciated that. Some better lighting would have been good though, but maybe that's just me.\n\nThe service was excellent. The staff knew the menu well, our waitress was appropriately friendly without bothering us, and although the young man who served our food seemed under dressed in his t-shirt he was quick and always found a haven to set the plate between us all.\n\nThe food.\nAntipasti, salumi di giorno. A very nice starter, and it really helped set the mood for the meal. It was light but refreshing and the portion size was pretty decent.\n\nPizza, uovo. I've never had egg on a pizza before but although it was a bit gooey for me it was definitely a good topping. And the crust was soft but crunchy, it held together nicely but wasn't a workout to chew up. However what completely ruined the pizza was the fontina cheese. Maybe it's just because i'm not Italian but it just seemed like the wrong flavor for the pizza, and my entire table agreed. I only had once slice, and I had really been looking forward to trying the pizza.\n\nPasta, ox tail pasta. I can't recall the exact name of this dish but ox tail always catches my eye so I ordered it. The pasta itself had a nice flavor but could have been a little thinner or a little softer. Luckily I enjoy a nice chewy pasta, but I know it's not for everyone. The sauce was too thin. And i'm not talking about the consistency, the flavors were just too thin. Also, very little ox tail, there were maybe three decent pieces and there were four of us so it was quite a battle.\n\nSecondi, chicken al mattone. The shining star of the entire meal, easily. Not only was it red hot when it arrived at the table but the seasonings were just amazing. Our bird was moist and juicy but the skin had a light crunch of flavor that just exploded in my mouth. It could desperately used some more potatoes however the entire dish was still my favorite.\n\nDessert, olive oil cake with honey thyme ice cream. I'm going to be honesty, I love ice cream so we ordered this as one of the desserts, however overall it was just not worth it. The cake was dry, far far too dry. And the ice cream wasn't flavorful to me at all. I kept trying to taste it but I may have been eating ice.\n\nChocolate budino with caramel espresso cream. If you go to Flour + Water for only one dish make it this one. If we had known how good this was before we ordered we would have bought one each rather than sharing one between us. The actual budino alone is spectacular. I have a good amount of experience working with chocolate and I just don't know how they put so much chocolate flavor into such a smooth and creamy dessert. Somewhere between a ganache and mousse it simply melted inside my mouth. The caramel espresso cream was seasoned with salt and I just adore that.

Really?  \n\nA friend and I decided we should brave the lines and give this place a try after all the hype.  Too bad hype was all it was.  Don't get me wrong, nothing was terrible, but nothing was amazing, either.\n\nWe arrived at 5:45 and were just late enough to miss the first seating.  So, we sat in the sun for over an hour chatting with other waiting-list patrons.  I did appreciate that the staff made sure we had a glass of wine while waiting and they checked in with us occasionally to see if we needed a refill.  \n\nFinally, it was our turn to be seated.  We were placed at the bar, which is cozy and a beautifully dark slab of wood.  Our waitress was very perky and friendly and made good wine suggestions to pair with the food.  \n\nUnfortunately, the food is where it all fell apart.  For my appetizer, I ordered the goat cheese crostata with shaved lardo.  It was okay--nothing amazing, a bit mushy, but fine.  This was the first point where I noticed that salt and pepper was lacking--a theme that continued throughout the night.  My friend had the sturgeon appetizer and, again, it was okay, but a bit bland and nothing special.\n\nFor our entrees, we decided to split one pizza and one pasta.  We ordered the chestnut maltagliati with braised pork and mustard greens, as well as the osso pizza with roasted bone marrow, fontina, rabe leaves, and fresh horseradish.  So, let's break this down one at a time.  For the pasta dish--the pasta itself was tasty.  The pork was perfectly tender and delicious--super flavorful.  Unfortunately, the dish together lacked depth, which was solved by adding just a touch of salt and pepper.  As for the pizza, the crust was so thin and became moist from the cheese and it just fell apart the second you tried to lift it up to bite into it.  The greens were the most predominant ingredient, with just a small bit of bone marrow.  And, horseradish?  We never tasted it--made us wonder if they even remembered to add it to our pie.  The crust is huge--goes 1/3 of the way into the pizza, leaving little actual pizza pie with topping.  I was, again, disappointed by the lack of salt and pepper and needed to add my own to bring the flavors together.\n\nWhen it came to dessert, we just gave up.  I've heard a lot about the chocolate budino, but after our meal, just couldn't justify spending another dime here.  I don't feel like I missed a thing.\n\nOverall, a less than amazing experience and I'm still baffled by all the hype.  The food is ok, and just ok.  The staff were friendly and the ambiance warm and inviting.  But, one bathroom for an entire restaurant?  \n\nIt's Gialina's for me.", "author": "Jessica L."}

The staff are extremely friendly and we were allowed to sit outside w/ a bottle of wine while we waited. They kept us updated and I was overall impressed with them. We got a great table and I would love to give this place 5 stars but I have to go with 3 b/c it is SO overpriced for what you get. \n\nThere were four of us and we started w/ a salad, then a pizza, then ordered 4 pastas. The pizzas serve about six slices total and it was delicious. The pastas were also very good but just such small portions, we each only got 1 or 2 bites. At $16-17 per pasta, there just wasn't a lot of food. Then one of us got the Rabbit for $24 and it was also extremely small. We were still hungry so we ended up ordered another pizza. We spent $300 including tip there and weren't full (this also included 2 bottles of wine). \n\nThey either need to price their pastas down or up the portions b/c that just wasn't worth the money. Plus it is in the middle of nowhere (deep in the Mission) and so I probably won't be back. A more convenient and affordable and just as amazing option is Zero Zero or Beretta or Delarosa. They offer more for the money and are fantastic. \n\nThe scene is VERY hipster. I think I saw one guy w/ a hankerchief tied around his neck. LOL", "author": "E G."}

Lovely.\n\nFood: \n- Appetizer of grapefruit & avocado with carpaccio ($10) was light and refreshing but not outstanding. Portion was also tiny. \n- We LOVED the pasta though - Chestnut maltagliati with braised pork ($17). This was delish! Fresh fresh pasta triangular slices, with soft tender pork chunks. Just wish there was more of it. I would definitely come back for the pastas.\n- We went with an untradtional pizza, the Osso - roasted bone marrow with brocolli ($17). The crust was great - obviously fresh, light, thin but not ridiculously so, held it's form so you could pick it up by hand if you wanted to. But the osso just didn't deliver enough flavor so overall was a bit bland. It had potential. And honestly maybe we just picked the wrong flavor here.\n- Dessert was the upside down pineapple cake ($8) which was very tasty. My dining companion RK couldn't get enough and almost licked the plate clean. Pretty good - not overly sweet. Enjoyable.\n\nOverall good meal. Long wait despite arriving at 6:20p.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-03-29", "description": "We were really looking forward to our visit to F+W after hearing and reading so much about the quality of the food here. We originally booked a table for 8pm 2 months in advance, but had to change our booking a week earlier and the only table we could get was 10pm. This was not a problem - we had a lazy morning and a late light lunch in anticipation of the evening treat.\n\nUnfortunately we were very disappointed. Maybe the chef was having an off day? Here's why I was disappinted:\n- The music was very loud . . . too loud\n- The service was bad. The waitress did hover and ask if we needed any explanation, but ran off halfway through talking to me. It was hard to get her attention through the meal. She spent a lot of time chatting with other waitresses and was very inattentive.\n- The food was all over-salted and flavors lacked the balance of flavor one would expect from a place with this reputation. Here is what we ordered:\nMy husband had the brodetto de parmigiano ($12) to start, which was a chicken broth with trumpet mushrooms and asparagus shavings and fennel and 6 tiny polenta and parmesan croutons. Tiny was the main problem here. The serving size was very small. The broth was OK (I had a taste and liked it best out of everything we ate), but not amazing. There was less than one asparagus thinly shaved onto the soup and less than one mushroom.\nWe shared the seafood stuffed tortellini verde with prosecco fennel & tarragon ($17) next. The pasta was OK - allegedly stuffed with a halibut mousse. The texture was very un-mousse-like - it was very firm and dense. My husband liked it more than I did. I thought the pasta was a bit too al-dente for my liking. We both felt that the sauce was really salty and lemony and buttery and did not work with the pasta.\nNext, I had the funghi pizza. Nice crust, but painfully salty mushroom topping with huge dollops of very salty green garlic sauce that completely overwhelmed everything else and made me eventually feel nauseous. I managed to eat 2 piece of the pizza because I was VERY hungry.\nMy husband had the osso pizza. He thought it was too salty and there were too many flavors fighting with each other. He loves marrow and said that the bitter broccoli rabe and salt completely ruined the delicate flavor of the marrow.\nWe did not have space for dessert, but looking at the yelp reviews I'm starting to think that the desserts are probably the best things at this place. Unfortunately I will not be going back to try them. There are many other better restaurants in SF. Next time I have a pizza craving I'll stick with Beretta for their divine thin crust pizzas or RNM, who do an amazing Truffle Mushroom pizza.\n\nHere are the positives:\n- Ambiance - dark and atmospheric. A great place for a romantic dinner.\n- The restroom was one of the most original restrooms that I have experienced in SF. It was very reminiscent of Paxton Gate. There were mottled glass display cases filed with what looked like bones, dried corals and a plaster of Paris hand. Very strange, but kind of cool as well!", "author": "Writer G."}

We started with the Alaskan halibut cheek that was served rare on this super yummy sauce and spring onion and caper berries...sooooo good!  Fennel crusted yellowtail was next, served with roasted fennel and artichoke. Tasty! Ordered the margherita and carbonara pizzas to share.  Margherita was good, but the carbonara was dang tasty.  There was an egg emulsion on top, I'm sure it was hollandaise, but it brought all the flavors together and gave it just the right amount of richness.  The crust was chewy and thin, perfect!  I shared the maltagliati with pork sausage with my fiance, and it was hard to share. It was tossed with a light tomato sauce and arugula, the sausage tasted like salami.  \nDessert was a chocolate budino with a caramel espresso cream and sea salt.  This was so good!

My friends and I ordered a lot of food and had it family style.  For antipasti we got the cured duck breast which was good. I liked the contrast of the cured duck with the apricots though I didn't taste the pickled ramps. We also ordered the taleggio with a balsamic reduction, the cappellacci with rabbit sausage and the last pasta was made with squid ink and served with pork sausage. All their handmade pastas were really good but the hands down favorite was the balsamic one. SO freakin' amazing. It literally melted in my mouth and the contrast of cheese with the sweet balsamic was to die for.  And of course we had to order a pizza so we had the margherita. I guess it depends on how you prefer your pizza but I thought it was just OK. The crust was just a tad too thin for my liking. The middle of the pie was really soggy.

There were no drink refills nothing just pulled the empty glasses and walked off...We sat and waited for a bill to arrive after everything was cleared for at lease 20 minutes. The wait in between courses got long as we had no wine to sip :-( \n\nSecondly the food, while the pizza is what should have been the star it was the pasta that was the winner. While it was complex, delicious and fresh, the 18.00 price for such a small portion was nuts. The pizza was just OK I prefer Pizetta 211 or Tony's in North Beach. \n\nIn the end we left starving as we thought the pasta was an entree turned out to be an appetizer, and the cost was outrageous and we were ignored by the bartender.

In SF, you open a new place that's not bad with the right vibe and they line up.  Some nice reviews and folks making a fuss about the pizza and you have demand. Ahh, San Francisco.  Foodies....\n\nWent on a Sunday at 5:15 ( fifteen minutes before opening) and stood in line.  no reservation.  opened the doors and we got the last table in the dining room. \n\nNice modern but casual atmosphere.  Not to loud, not to soft.  Just right.  This is a 5 star for sound.  Good going guys!\nMusic.  Liking it.  Kinda cool instrumental stuff.  nothing recognizable but not the clubby untz untz shit that would make me want to beat a waiter with a baguette.  Good going guys!\n\nSeats.   Bad going guys.  Straight up back and seat.  hard wood .  not comfortable. I don't like my ass to hurt during dinner and be shifting around.  Maybe it is how they get you to leave quickly after finishing so they can flip the tables.  Bad for you.  Good for them.\n\nService.  I go a 5 .  friendly, not pushy, right amount of checking.  fell off a bit after we finished entrees but not anything to ruin it.  Manager./owner ( i think) was helping out to.  Something I like to see.\n\nNow finally the food.  Cold heirloom tomato soup.  Not quite gazpacho but really good.  A bit of heat with the sweetness of really ripe tomatoes.  Just enough different to make it a winner.\n\nSea Bass.  Really a 5 for sure. Great \"lobster mushrooms\" glazed with god knows what but boy were they great.  fresh corn sauteed and mixed with some type of creme.  All went perfect together.  Fish however was just a tad overdone, but not ruined. \n\nPancetta/squash pizza.  Now if you read my reviews you will see I am a pizza snob.  So this place is on the pizza map so it gets my full attention.  Crust is more Neapolitan style than they would care to admit.  A good saltiness, burnt bubbles and char on the bottom.  Light and crispy on the outside.  But the middle of the pie was a soggy mess.  I'm blaming the fresh mozz.  Although it tastes great, it has way to much water in it which will mush up your crust if your dough formula cant handle the moisture, which this one cant.  Pizza was drizzled with a lemon scented oil which I liked but was maybe a touch heavy on the lemon.  Pancetta was thin sliced like bacon.   Not much of it.  I have a beef to pick.  When there is a topping it needs to be EVENLY distributed.  Fuck this artisan \"throwing the toppings\" on the pie.  They land where they land.  A fucking 3 year old makes a pizza like this.  A pro should be able to take an extra 1 minute and make sure toppings are laid out evenly. i want a taste of my toppings on every bite/piece.  You know you go to a good restaurant and the \"plating\" is almost as important as the dish.  How its presented.  But for some reason most of these high end places serving upscale pizzas haven't figured this out.  It's not pretty , it's sloppy.   OK, OK... topping rant over.\n\nHad a chocolate bundo? desert which was some of the densest darkest chocolate in a tureen I ever ate.  Some espresso whipped cream on top and drizzled with salt.  Problem was way to much salt and it was some huge chunks of salt.  So when you got some in your mouth it completely overpowered all the other flavors.  A touch of finer sea salt would have been perfect.   \n\nSo there you have it.  The pizza almost pulled this rating down to a 3.  You want crust that knocks you down then you have Mozza in Los Angeles.  It is by itself a fine artisan bread unlike anyone elses pizza crust.   But this one is pretty damn good tasting but the soggy thing really pulls it back to a 3 at best.  But everything else and the other food takes it back up to a 4.\n\nFlour + Water = almost great pizza...+ sore butt.  Still a good way to eat fresh flavorful interesting foodstuffs (other than pizza)...  Close but no breadstick.", "author": "Bruce M."}

We did not have a reservation, so we called earlier in the evening to see what they thought about walk-ins. As stated on their website, they said that they reserved 50% of their tables for walk-ins and the wait was usually about 45 minutes. We went to the restaurant and were told we would be waiting an hour and a half. We decided to wait, but immediately felt like we were in the way, and annoying to the hostesses. I will say that they offered to get us a glass of wine, which we did appreciate, but about an hour into our wait, we asked if they knew how long we still had to wait and were told, \"it hasn't been an hour and a half yet\". Sort of a rude response. I've been to many nice reataurants and they will often offer you bread or an appetizer if your wait is excessive. This would have been greatly appreciated. Finally, we got seated at the communal table. The service was slow and we were waiting for water refills many times. We asked for bread and did not receive it until we asked again. When the food came I will admit that it was quite good (minus the burnt spinach au gratin). Our bill was presented before our dessert even arrived. It was obvious that it was time for us to move on. Flour and Water is a great concept with good food. I was really turned off, however, by the feeling that this restaurant thinks it's \"all that\", when it really is just another \"good\" restaurant with potential. Make your guests feel importantant and welcome, rather than making them feel like they are lucky to even be allowed inside. That would go a long way. If you can't accomodate walk-ins, that's fine. But don't encourage walk-ins when customers call, if you aren't going to accomodate them.", "author": "Liza S."}

Too bad they sent us the wrong dish first.  After waiting 45 minutes for a seat we wound up waiting another half hour for a drop of food.  frustrating.\nWe had the nettles pizza.  The crust was crisp and thin but bland - tasted like fresh matzoh on Passover  (not  Mozza LA, which is delicious).  In all, the pizza also over salted, the nettles were burnt, and the cheese tasted...well, cheap.  The salami on it was delicious though.\nNext up was the duck breast which was overcooked with a confused flavor. It had an Asian tilt but was generally bland.

One pasta was tossed with wild boar meat, another stuffed with rabbit liver--not your average pasta at all. The service was unusual in that instead of an individual server, whoever walked by the kitchen picked up the food and brought it to the table, and whoever walked by your table checked on you--still it was prompt, professional and friendly. We could see the kitchen from our table and the cooks were clearly enjoying themselves.  I would happily eat at Flour & Water all the time. \n\nWe reserved a table at 9:30 on a Tuesday night and were seated immediately. I have heard that it's very hard to get reservations for the more \"normal\" dining hours of 6:00 to 9:00, and that if you try to sit at one of the tables that they don't reserve, the wait is hours long and  you can't have a drink while you wait in the bar because there is no room--you must stand outside, drinkless. I saw no nearby bars or coffee houses where one could wait.  I suspect that long wait is the reason for many of the \"slams\" on Yelp--anybody would be grumpy after such an ordeal. \n\nAlthough we enjoyed Flour & Water immensely,  I cannot give it an unqualified recommendation. \n\nFirst, the music was so loud you had to yell to converse with your table-mates. Not my favorite dining environment.\n\nSecond, the decor was OK but not special--SOMA/Mission industrial hipster cliche about sums it up. The high ceilings and hard surfaces made the restaurant that much louder.  \n\nThird, there are few vegetarian or vegan options. \n\nFourth, it was not that warm of a night, but we were surrounded by bare skin and tattoos--not just the customers (I supposed you have to suck that up at 20th and Harrison) but the servers. Not little tattoos, but huge, all-over-the-arms-and-back murals, with some leg tattoos on the women thrown in for good measure. I think tattoos are repulsive and found myself having to focus strictly on my plate and my table-mates to avoid losing my appetite.

Went there with a group and while there was a long'ish wait, it was not a surprise and we all had a good time waiting. \n\nFrom the delicious appetizers (sardines were amazing) to the awesome pizzas (Osso was our favorite) to the triangoli which were tasty and cooked just right. Dessert was yummy but nothing extraordinary nor unusual -- solid, well executed options. The food is the star but the wine list is deep and intelligent -- we loved it all. \n\nReminds us of Nopa (and we're big fans of Nopa) although we thought flour + water is tastier. Great food, service to match and a strong wine list. Wish it was a bit quieter, wish it had a bit more space, wish it had a sommelier on duty but these are minor nits.", "author": "Joe S."}

Granted, we did not have a reservation, but we called ahead and were given a time that we could arrive and not have more than a 30 minute wait.  When we arrived, the 30 minute wait was confirmed, yet it was two hours before we were seated.  We were with good company and the wine selection here is really good, so there was no reason to leave.

The location and ambience is lively and engaging and the food is compelling if not inspirational. We had the sardine salad which was one of the highlights of our meal with fresh sardines in a light oil and herb dressing accented with roasted peppers. The pasta dishes were excellent. We shared two dishes, a ravioli and meat based flat-cut pasta. Both were cooked to perfection and nicely balanced. The pizza was a bit of a let down. The crust though tasty was a bit doughy for my taste. For secondi we had a pork dish with beans and sauteed greens. The roasted meat was nicely prepared and the dish worked very well together ... flavorful yet distinctive and clean! The dessert the chocolate budino was yummy.

We got a great seat by the wall, ventilation is great in the restaurant, you never smell the food around (from the kitchen from other tables) unless it is on your table. \n\nI got the oxtail soup, and sea bass and chocolate budino (as recommended by yelp reviewers).  The oxtail soup was very nicely done, it was perfect.  The sea bass was very large and also perfectly done. So, was the dessert.  But none of these  screamed euphoric, they were just all.. perfectly cooked.\n\nI tried some of my group's dishes.  There was this liver pasta that was horrible.  A pork stew typed tortellini was was the best pasta of the table, I thought.  Everyone raved about the pumpkin ravioli that I did not try.\n\nOur waiter was delightful and nice.\n\nI think it is a really good restaurant but the fuss of a 2 month long reservation was definitely not worth it, I would have been happier going elsewhere cheaper and less fuss.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-02-07", "description": "My friend and I waited a long time to get the chance to eat here and we were really disappointed. We fully expected the long wait so that part is forgivable. We were treated nicely by the hostess who suggested we order a glass of wine and allowed us to squeeze between the communal table and the window to wait (it was very cold out that night). A party of 6 never arrived so they turned a large table into a second communal table and we were seated 15 minutes earlier than expected. That was the last positive experience of the evening. \nWe began with the Steel Head Crudo which was a schizophrenic mess. There was so much happening on the plate (fish, golden and red pickled beets, aoli, and it seemed to go on and on). that I couldn't discern one flavor from the next. I LOVE crudo but this one gets a C minus.\nNext we had a pasta dish but I can't recall the name. It wasn't so much al dente as it was oddly chewy. It was served in a small pool of lukewarm brown meaty juice that reminded me of low sodium beef broth. I was really surprised that this was allowed to go out of the kitchen.\nWe were thrilled by the description of the Osso Pizza (bone marrow, rapini, fontina and horseradish). It was actually pretty bland. The rapini was fibrous and turned out to be an odd addition to a pizza. The bone marrow was okay but lacked salt and I forgot that there was supposed to be horseradish on the pizza at until I was reminded. The crust was the best part for me. I understand that certain reviewers dislike the charred pieces but that is a plus for me.\nOverall the food wasn't worth the wait or the price.", "author": "Rob C."}

The tables are close to your fellow diners, but intimate enough, plus it's kind of nice to glance over at what your neighbors are dining on for that moment. Well, ended up getting a lovely appetizer, equally lovely looking/tasting pasta and pizza, gorgeously crisped. I think it's still rather hyped up for what you get. They are lovely servings, as well as great quality, but the service is kind of lax. Our waitress that started with us, was kind of negligent, but luckily, she had a great backup...I just hope that she ended up getting the tip we left rather than the first...probably not.

So, what we ended with was an extremely dark restaurant (I had to use my phone light to read the menu) in which we couldn't hear each other talk (so it wasn't romantic).  The waiter didn't come to take our drink order for about 15-20 minutes, and then returned to deliver the drinks about 10-15 minutes later (from 5 feet away).

If you're flexible with your dining options for the night, I would recommend checking Open Table several times in the days coming up to the day you are interested in going.  We were able to get a reservation the day before using that trick. We started with the beet salad and then I had a cocoa infused tajarin with pork sugo and my wife had a pumpkin tortelli.  It was all excellent.  Yes, some of the pasta options are a tad on the smaller side, but if you weren't expecting that going in then you were kidding yourself.  The idea is to celebrate the freshness of the ingredients, the creativity of the chefs and the excellence of the preparation.  If you want big heaping servings of run of the mill \"Italian\" food then go to Bucca di Beppo.", "author": "Ben S."}

(And here I thought I wouldn't be lining up for dinner at 5pm for another 40 years, when I plan to be all over the early bird special at the local buffet near my retirement castle.)  In any event, by the time the place opened at 5:30 it filled up instantly and thankfully we were part of the lucky few who got a table right away.\n\nWe shared a bunch of dishes as a group, and I'd say the overall food quality was 3.5 stars.  We shared the ramps pizza (ramps are garlic-y scallions) and duck antipasti to start, then had the squid ink and pork shoulder pastas and a lamb dish that was a combo tenderloin and belly.  Then we finished with the budino.\n\nThe pizza was top-notch, and I highly recommend the ramps if you're a mushroom fan (it had hen of the woods shrooms on it).  I wish the server or menu had been more clear about what the duck app was - because it ended up being a fairly small salad that wasn't good for sharing.  The pork pasta was very good, but the squid ink disappointed.  We had some squid ink vets in the group who said they'd had better and I thought the chili powder was a bit excessive.  The lamb dish was excellent, and our group was split 3-2 on the question of \"salt or no salt?\" on the budino.  I was part of the slim pro-salt majority, but to each his own.\n\nOur server was pleasant but I felt a little rushed when he seemed overly anxious to take our orders.  Another big pro was the reasonable $15 corkage that is waived if you buy a bottle from the nearly exclusively Italian varietal wine list.\n\nI'd say the price-value equation was just about right, but count me among those that doesn't quite get the hype around Flour+Water.", "author": "Nate B."}

We ordered a bottle of bubbles to keep us preoccupied while we waited in a small (and a bit cramped) area close to the bar.  The owner came out with our bottle of wine which he poured for us.  Apparently they have someone at the bar taste each bottle before it is served so as to ensure none of them are bad.  One of my friends was trying to start up a conversation with the owner but he wasn't very interested in talking.  (The owner also said he doesn't \"Yelp\" - minus brownie points!!)\n\nWhen we were finally seated towards the back of the restaurant near the mural, we had an idea of what we wanted to order but also wanted some suggestions from our server.  We decided to go with the verzada pizza (recommended), agnolotti pasta (recommended), paparrdelle pasta, roasted pork leg & belly, and a side of sauteed turnips and spigarello.  I thought the food was very delicious.  My favorite dishes had to be the paparrdelle and pork leg/belly.  The paparrdelle were tiny dumplings filled with pork shoulder in a very flavorful tasty sauce.  I thought it was absolutely delicious.  The pork leg and belly was also impeccable topped with glazed yams.  I loved the texture of the crunchiness against the softness of the pork belly.  This dish is very rich and fatty (super thick piece of pork belly) it is definitely a dish you should share.  I thought the sauteed turnips was also very good; a nice light side to compliment the heavy dishes we ordered.  The agnolotti pasta was very good though it wasn't my favorite.  Lastly the pizza was also good, yet again not my favorite dish (felt I can get a similar type of pizza at Pizzeria Delphia and other such places).\n\nFor dessert we ordered two orders of their chocolate budino with espresso caramel cream and sea salt.  My friend was insistent that we order more than one which was a good call.  It was heavy but good.  The sea salt was a nice contrast and they were much more aggressive in the amount of salt they put into the dessert.  I've tried my handful of sweet/salty desserts but I thought this one was a bit edgy in the amount of salt it had.  Again, good dessert but not my favorite.  A couple of us also ordered some dessert wine.\n\nOverall I thought the food was very good, the ambiance very warm and rustic, the wait staff was friendly...the only drawback was the not so friendly owner.

The first time I went, it was like fate paved the way. My girlfriend suggested we try it. We were out and about early on a drizzly Tuesday night and were promptly seated at the bar. We had a terrific tender who was attentive and knowledgeable about the wine and the food. We weren't so knowledgeable however, choosing the lambs tongue salad (I think I imagined this was a lettuce varietal?) Even though I don't typically eat lamb--at all, this lamb's tongue salad was amazing and promptly converted me. I have craved the lamb's tongue salad since I'm almost ashamed to say. We had a fresh pasta and the pizza Margarita and a pinot nero. I was in heaven!\n\nSecond time, I tried my luck with a friend at a more popular time. Nevertheless we were seated within five minutes at the *community* table. I was REALLY hungry this time and was a little anxious about having to wait to order, then be denied bread after asking for it for three times. It eventually came, 45 minutes later, just as I was reaching for my neighbor's neglected crust. The real stinger of the evening was the wine service, or lack there of. We ordered the Primitivo and when it came, we were given a lecture, err explanation about how tasting just isn't done at F&W and that the *trusty* bar tender had *smelled* the cork already and assured our server that the wine was fit for consumption. The bottle was then presented to us uncorked already and poured into glasses. I wondered why not let me taste the damn wine since the whole explanation and trouble of pouring the wine seemed to take the same amount of time but no matter, I smelled it and it was corked, I tasted it and it was def. corked. I will say that our server was very embarrassed (too embarrassed really) She admitted that the bartender had a *cold*--great and then went on to explain how she didn't really agree with the restaurant's decision not to allow people to taste the wine. This kinda put me off the whole experience, especially since we went on to spend a fair amount of money.\n\nWill I go back? Absolutely.

The space is larger than you might think from the outside as well.\nThe bar and the large communal table by the entrance are reserved for walk-ins, and when we arrived they were full, and we were told the wait would be 20-30 minutes.  Fair enough - perfect opportunity to sample the wine list and start with a glass!\nThe list is entirely Italian - don't be surprised if you recognize none of them; I didn't, and I'm used to recognizing things on a wine list.  That said, my knowledge of Italian wines is sorely lacking... So we asked the bartender for suggestions, and she made an excellent one!  The red she pointed out as her favorite was fantastic: rich, spicy, full of bright fruit and crisp acidity, with a wonderfully complex aroma including oak and leather.  It struck me as quite similar to a good Chianti Classico - great on its own, but would be fantastic with food as well.  Glasses hover around $10-11, but the pours are quite generous.\nGlasses in hand, we made our way to the space behind the common table to enjoy the scene and await our chance to partake.\nAnd await.  \nAnd await.\nAt long last we were seated, more than an hour and fifteen minutes after we'd arrived.  Needless to say, we were famished and were desperate to dig into the food we'd been eyeing for the past hour.\nThe shaved asparagus and arugula salad was excellent - the balance of the crunchy bits of pancetta, the soft richness of the quail eggs, the bright acidity of the vinaigrette, and the light bitter of the greens worked marvelously, and all topped with shaved parmigiano.  Great start!\nThe chilled pea and asparagus soup with pounded mint was interesting - velvety smooth, with the dark green drizzles of the mint atop the soup adding a unique brightness to the flavor.  To me, it was slightly salty which seemed out of place, and I'm not entirely convinced that it \"worked\" for me as a combination, but I'm glad I tried it.\n\nFor pizza, we got the prosciutto, topped with fresh arugula.  (The pizzas are of good size - half of one was plenty of food for me, along with the appetizers.)  The prosciutto was tender and rich; the arugula a nice light contrast; the sauce light but flavorful, and the crust had a hint of a sourdough flavor to it, and a good crunchy-ness to the edge.  Unfortunately, beneath the crunchy was a tough chewiness that suggested it had either been overworked as dough, or needed a bit more time in the oven to crisp up more.\n\nI liked the happy, excited atmosphere (though be forewarned it's on the loud side, if that sort of thing bothers you).  I loved the wine.  I liked the servers, who were very friendly.  I look forward to trying them again in the future, trying some of the pasta dishes, and seeing if my crust experience was unusual.\n\nBut next time, I'll definitely be making a reservation.  Until they figure out how to estimate wait times better, it's not worth walking in.", "author": "Don H."}

Best things about this restaurant are the mural on the rear wall and the roasted peppers, where were both to die for.  We were pretty turned off by the service as we watched the host and hostess seat about 5 two tops before the single diner who had arrived long before they did.  The single diner was finally squeezed in at the bar (not even the communal table) when one cramped seat opened up.  Table service was non-existant (still not sure which of the 3 people that 'helped' us was our server), pizza had tasty if slightly burned crust, chicken was blase at best and if I ever have to listen to an entire Tom Petty album from front to back again, I better not be paying for my meal.  Probably not going back regardless of Tom Petty, unless it's to gorge myself on 2 orders of their roasted peppers and stare at that mural.", "author": "Lulu L."}

I have wanted to go to this restaurant for a while because every time I went by, it was packed. I can see why. The wine, Barbara, was \"Bomb bomb\" as our server described it and he was right. It was jammy and smooth, just perfection. Then our appetizer was melt-in-your mouth good. We had the crispy trotter with currant & pine nut relish & arugula. A-MAZ-ING!  Never had trotter before, but I am a fan. It is lightly breaded fish, shaped like a tiny pancake.  I can't wait to go back and order that dish again.  \n\nThe service was superior.  We had Timmy as our server and he was a pure joy.  Funny, warm and knows every dish inside and out. My friend and I do not speak Italian and had a difficult time understanding the menu. We relied heavily on Timmy for recommendations and he did not steer wrong with the wine and appetizers. As I said, A-MAZ-ING! \n\nThe first drawback was the main dishes. My friend and were in the mood for pasta, so we ordered their two stuffed pasta dishes.  One was cheese filled and the other pork filled. The cheese was better than the pork.  They were good dishes, but not great dishes. They were nothing to write home about. We should have pushed Timmy for more recommendations on the main course. \n\nSecond downer of the evening was the dessert. We had the chocolate budino with espresso-caramel cream & sea salt. It was like a chocolate muse with sea salt. They put A LOT of sea salt on it and it was almost too salty to enjoy. We had to take most of the salt off in order to finish the dessert. Again, we went on our own for this dish without consulting Timmy - mistake. \n\nTimmy was so much fun as our server, that we did not mind the bland pasta and overly salty dessert. He made the evening enjoyable for us and we plan to return to try some of their other dishes. At least we know we will have a good time.", "author": "Alie R."}

Think sophisticated dining but casual enough to allow you to be yourself. Also the prices won't break the bank. The one downside is that there is no valet parking but true San Franciscans would shutter at the idea so this downside fits the clientele. \nThe waiters are friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and wine list. I'm a big fan of the Unti barbera, which the waitress recommended. The wine comes to the table already opened and tasted which is unconventional. \nI'm not the biggest fan of Italian food but this isn't red sauce Italian cuisine, think Tuscan. The sardine app is savory deliciousness. You get two and they're just enough to enjoy but not OD on. The pasta is made daily and it shows. The pappardelle with pork is incredible and the sauce is worthy of dipping with bread and having as a dish all by itself. The pasta with pork was also very good but too cheesy for my taste. The pizzas are light and not super cheesy at all. And the cheese that is on the pizzas is tasty. The pork shoulder special for the night we went was good but the highlight of the dish was the white beans that came with the dish. \nDesserts: The semifreddo with pistachios and chocolate budino desserts are incredible. I had one bad bite of the budino but only because I got too much of the sea salt that come on top and not enough of the chocolate. \nThe menu changes frequently but something tells me you'll always find something you'll like.", "author": "Richard S."}

This restaurant had been hyped up, so I was sort of surprised to see so many negative comments on Yelp - and truth be told, it made me worry I'd have a bad experience there. This simply wasn't the case. We were seated promptly, the service was friendly and the food was tasty. Our group of three shared two pizzas and two pastas: the margherita and uovo pizzas, along with the sweet pea and mint tortelli and oricchiette with oxtail. I found the pizzas to be exactly as I like them - chewy thin crust, nice amount of cheese, and while they could have been a little more generous with the additional toppings, I think the idea is to be a little more delicate and not create a pizza overflowing with junk. Same goes for the pastas - they're handmade and delicate, and the portion was a bit small but the complex flavors made them totally satisfying. The only criticism I can offer is that they could be a little more generous with the oxtail, because for $14+ I'd like to have more than a sprinkle of tasty meat.\n\nOne area where flour + water does not fall short: DESSERT. We ordered both the chocolate budino (a delicious pot de creme with sea salt and a salted caramel/espresso whipped cream on top) and a cherry ricota tart. Both blew my expectations completely out of the water!  The budino was creamy and rich, and the tart was lightly sweet in a delicious shortbready crust. Not only were they generously sized, they were rich and delicious and a perfect way to end the meal.\n\nSo yes, it's a little pricey. The portions are small compared to other restaurants. But I left the restaurant feeling totally satisfied and comfortable, rather than bloated and carbed out. For our group, it was a perfect mix of flavors and a really nice experience.", "author": "Beth T."}

Even arriving at that time, there wasn't a line and there were still quite a few tables open. It wasn't long though when it started to fill up, so I would say arrive before 6/6:15, at least based on this night.\n\nThe service is really good, they're super helpful with the menu, explaining everything and they really take their time in general. There were times when we didn't see our waitress for a long stretch, but this was fine, we had what we needed. They were attentive, but it's amazing how they really don't rush you at all, even when the whole front is filled with people waiting to sit down. Maybe if you're trying to get in and out it would be a problem, but I couldn't see coming here to do that.\n\nWe started with the soft-cooked egg with peas, proscuitto and potatoes and it was really good. Definitely ask for bread to go with it, the bread was so good and perfect to sop up the runny egg.\n\nAfter much discussion, we finally decided on the pork belly bucatini and the squid ink tortellini. Both were really good, but I would say the tortellini was my favorite. It comes in a broth that was just incredible. They serve dishes as they come out and I think most people share every dish anyway, so this worked well. I had read about the small portions and yes, the prices are high, but I was looking forward to being able to try multiple pastas b/c of the smaller portions. Regardless, they weren't that small. Between my mom (who's not a huge eater) and me (I am), we shared the egg starter, 2 pasta dishes and a pizza, and took half the pizza home.\n\nLike others probably say, my mom said, let's not bother with a pizza. Luckily I had read about it and said, no, we definitely need to try one. We got the carbonara at the waitresses suggestion and it was so good. Highly recommend trying a pizza and a pasta. We didn't go with a main or dessert. We were full at that point. Over, with tip for the above food and a glass of wine each, it was $115. I didn't think that was all that bad. The food was really good and while I'd love to say I'd be back, it's too hard to be able to get over there and eat dinner at 5:30pm and reservations are nearly impossible to get. I'm so glad we got to try it though, it's been on my list for a while and unlike many of the other hot spots, this place actually lived up to my high expectations. My only complaint would be that the food was super salty - not that you're noticing it while you're eating but we definitely drank a lot of water at dinner and then when we got home, even the next morning I still was trying to rehydrate. I guess that's what you get when you order the pork belly pasta (there was a lot in there!) and have proscuitto and pancetta with the other two dishes! One other thing - it gets super loud in there. They have music playing that could definitely be tuned down a few notches, but with all the people talking, it gets so loud too, definitely one of the loudest restaurants I've eaten a meal like this in, in a while.", "author": "Lauren M."}

Both were good but the crust had some serious char on the bottom.The bigoli (kind of thick spaghetti) with pork ragu and breadcrumbs was exceptionally good, they make the pasta in house and the ragu was flavorful and fragrant. For an appetizer we ordered the pork trotter with pork belly. The belly was delicious but I wasn't entirely sure what the trotter was. All I saw was a fried patty of meat with carrots in it that had too soft a texture. Since they use the whole animal here, I was convinced I was eating a foot. Which is fine, I just wish they'd tell me that right off the bat. :)\n     We also ordered the pan seared bass with ceci, favas, bacon and baby fennel. It tasted perfectly good, but again, I really think I could have made that at home and for maybe half the price. \n     The chocolate budino was pretty mindblowing, however. A large ramekin of thick, almost ganache-like chocolate with a sprinkling of sea salt on top. I'm definitely a salt-on-dessert kind of girl!", "author": "Doris M."}

Should have made reservations, but we didn't and were quoted a 40 min wait.  That is what you get when you don't make reservations. This gave us plenty of time to study the menu, change our mind 15 times, make a decision, and have some beers. We sat and we ate. Uovo pizza and a pasta clam dish.  The pizza was really good: thin crust, egg, pancetta. The pasta was in disks with a sort of floral pattern on it., al dente and delicious.  The community table is cool because you get to see other dishes that people are ordering.  The downside: you have to listen to a woman vent about her lacking love life and how her drinking days are over as she consumes MANY glasses of wine.  I can't wait to go back and try some other dishes, especially since the fish looked amazing.  With a seasonal menu there is always something new to try.", "author": "Justin N."}

Best of all, you don't have to pay your bar tab separately and she just remembers who you are and it appears on your bill.

We came at 6pm thinking that we were \"in the know\" and it was pretty obvious that a lot of people are in the know of the latest openings of hot restaurants in San Francisco. \n\nWe ended up eating at the communal long table up in front. It seats five parties, up to 10 people. It's a little cozy there, so make sure that you smell good. \n\nWe ordered the beet salad, which was good but sort of small in portion.  We then shared the pizza margherita with mozzarella bufala ($2.50 supplement) and the triangole pasta ($17). The portions aren't super large and the three dishes we had were just about enough, without being super hungry. The taste and flavor though - yum yum!! The crust on the pizza reminded me like the ones I had in Italy. The triangole pasta was delicious and they were shaped like triangles.  We each had a glass of Italian wine which were around the $6-8 range.  All in all this restaurant is very delicious. Since they opened last Friday, the kitchen was catching up with the orders that had already been placed and I heard that they were holding off on taking orders while the kitchen caught up.  I noticed that by the time we left, there was a large crowd waiting and the phone was ringing non-stop.  I think SF has another great pizzeria place! \n\nThere is only one restroom in the back and their window mirror walls were interesting.

She was helpful in a wine recommendation, as well as just overall friendly and personable.  \n\nWe got the greens with poached egg and pancetta side as an appetizer, and it was delicious!

We couldn't decide which one was better.  \n\nOur entire meal with a bottle of wine was $100, which I thought was totally reasonable given how awesome the meal was.  \n\nAnd they have one of the most interestingly decorated bathrooms I've ever seen.  \n\nYes, this place is very hyped up, but my experience is that the hype is more than deserved.

Then out came two pizzas--a margarita and a tasty one with pancetta and cheese and onion and a nice tasty duck egg in the middle.  Unfortunately, the pizzas weren't what I really wanted.  There was no crispiness to the crust, the center was soggy... either they hadn't been cooked at a high enough temperature, or they were just not cooked enough period.  However, the stars of the show were the pastas.  A pheasant tortellini in brodo was delicate and soul-satisfying, but the celery root tortelloni were RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME.  I'd come back and order three of this dish just for me.  The creamy filling of the tortelloni was covered in silky fresh pasta, cooked to perfection.  Little tasty cubes of celery root added a different texture, and the whole plate was covered in butter, with some aged balsamic vinegar drizzled on top kind of like the way drool is hitting my desk right now... \n\nSorry.  Wrong picture to be painting.  Anyway.\n\nUnfortunately, we couldn't eat all the delicious sauces accompanied by the pastas because our requests for more bread were ignored by the waitress who was clearly anxious to kick us the heck out of there.

First of all, we were sat at a \"community table\" which was actually a table for 4, and the couple who sat down next to us basically listened to our conversation the whole time. Annoying. The food was good, but I really didn't appreciate the foodie vibe. I was really looking forward to a PIZZERIA in my hood, and this does not fit the bill. I will probably not be back, which is a bummer, given that it is two blocks from my house (and a very cool space inside).", "author": "Heather H."}

The shrimp and green bean app was light, fresh and perfectly seasoned.  The tortelloni with peas and mint screamed summer and was a perfect size.

It was\" Love at first listen\" for me.\n\nI heard about Flour + Water about 2 months before they opened and was floored over the concept. I knew it was bound to be a success. Why?\n\n1) They bake their own bread, cure their own salumi and make their own sausages. I love how they have a hand in so much of what they serve. They also have a wood fired oven for their Neapolitan style thin crust pizzas.\n\n2) Casual vibe w/ cool art pieces that are painted by local artists. The materials used to build the place are definitely unique, creative and interesting from the front of the restaurant all the way to the restroom.\n\n3) Flour + Water. Love the name!\n\n4) They incorporate Humphrey Slocombe ice cream into their desserts w/ flavors specifically designed for Flour + Water.\n\n5) They serve Coffee Bar coffee. It's neat seeing these all-star neighborhood businesses collaborate.\n\n\nSo, I came by earlier tonite since I heard that they just opened last week, and fell in love w/ every bit of it. \n\nSince I had a bit of a tummyache, I thought I'd start off w/ something light, so I went for their cute salad per our server's suggestion, which included butter lettuce, avocado and thinly sliced radishes perfectly coated w/ a delicious dressing & a spritz of lemon juice. I then shared a Margherita Wood-Fired pizza (w/ Bufala Mozzarella added) and enjoyed every bite of it from the soft & chewy crust, to the sweet red sauce. I was pretty surprised by how soft & lightly crisped the pizza was since wood-fired pizzas tend to come out charred w/ bone dry crust. I also shared an order of their Bucatini, which was DEE-LICIOUS and had me wishing I had ordered it all for myself! The pasta was cooked perfectly w/ that lovely aldente bite and the red sauce, savory. I noticed that our server and chef didn't bat an eye when we requested to have the pork served on the side for the dish (since there was a vegetarian in the group), which is a rare reaction when ppl custom order!\n\nService was really friendly, from the sweet hostess who brought us water while we waited, to our server who was patient when we asked several questions about the menu.\n\n\nFlour + Water is my new favorite go-to spot!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-07", "description": "Hit up flour and water for a pal's birthday last night. I was excited to give it a try since I'd been hearing good things.  We split a couple appetizers and dishes so we all got to try a couple things.  Most of our party got there a few minutes after our scheduled reservation time, but we were seated right when they all arrived. Some of the other groups with reservations were kept waiting a bit so I was glad we got in and seated. I had a black lager from the linden street brewery in oakland, which was a great beer. We started off with the dungeness crab appetizer with fennel. It was really bright, tasty, and interesting appetizer. It is pretty small and expensive as others have noted, but c'mon. You're going out for a kinda douchey-fancy dinner. Of course it's going to be small and expensive. We all thought the crab deserved a thumbs up, great taste and beautiful presentation. We also all shared the roasted cauliflower aformato and the trotter. The trotter was A++, fried perfectly, beautiful presentation, and balanced. The cauliflower aformato...... well, the cauliflower part was good. The cake-gratin-aformato bit was just sort of rich and not very interesting or enjoyable.  The main dishes we tried were the orechiette, the celery root tortelli, and the duck strozapetti, as well as the calabrese pizza.  The pizza was good - thin crust, cooked perfectly. The sauce was spicy but not too spicy, but the salt cured olives and the capers made it an extremely salty venture. The orechiette was the other big winner at the table - delicious and perfectly cooked, and the rabbit sausage was amazing too. The tortelli was a little butter saturated for my taste, but the duck strozapetti was another big winner.  So overall we felt like the food was worth it, but not as knock-your-socks off as we were hoping. Maybe we had inflated expectations but it is what it is. You go partially because the hype and then it doesn't live up to the hype? I'm pretty sure that's a first world problem.  A side note: we didn't have good service at all. Our waitress seemed too busy for us - she stopped by frequently enough but didn't really discuss the menu or any of the dishes. When one of our party (the birthday girl herself) asked some questions, the answers were very brief and not very helpful.. got the sense that she didn't know the menu very well. And then she forgot the egg on our pizza, which was mildly lame. When we told her, she pretty much accused us of not ordering it and then stood there double checking her notes to prove that she hadn't written it down. Not gracious or cool at all.   \n\nTL;DR version:\ngood-great but not amazing food, mediocre service, salty!", "author": "amanda l."}

There were four of us at the table having a good dinner and drinking a couple of bottles of wine and when it came time for dessert we decided against it and opted to have another round of wine... I guess this is frowned upon there because even after asking our waitress if it was okay to order more wine and stay at the table (she said yes) the manager came over and said that she had people waiting for our table and that they would let us stand in the bar area and have another drink. She mentioned something about honoring other people's reservations.\n\nummmmmm...... no.\n\nMy first point is if we had ordered dessert we would be sitting there anyway.\n\nWe also asked our waitress if it was okay if we ordered more wine at the table and she said yes.\n\nWe had a reservation as well and if they were really worried about \"honoring reservations\" then they would have let us finish ours out. \n\nEven after doing this you would think that maybe since they were kicking us out of our table and they knew we wanted to have another drink that perhaps comping us a drink at the bar would have been the right thing to do..... again.... no.\n\nOur waitress came over and said how sorry she was (not her fault) and did a good job with our table through the night.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-12-27", "description": "I tried to contact the manager of this restaurant to report on poor service, but after two calls on my part, I never heard back.  \n\nLike many people, I was eagerly anticipating my first visit to flour + water and three girlfriends and I made a date for a Wednesday night. Our plan was to meet just before 6, put our name in for a table and hopefully be seated by 6:30.  \n\nMy critique of the restaurant is with the hostess and her service which overshadowed the food. When the first two friends arrived, just before 6 p.m. they were told that they couldn't put their names in on the list until the entire party was present  (I've never heard of that practice).  They were then shooed away from the hostess station and stood over in a corner.  I arrived at 6:05 and by that time, the message that we wouldn't even get to put our names on the list until we were all there became a miscommunication within our group with our fourth attendee feeling too guilty about holding us up. A spot opened at the communal table and the hostess seated the three of us with an open seat to my left.  There were parties to the left and right of us that had been seated at the same time, so the table wasn't suddenly going to turn over and it wasn't the type of arrangement where another party could sit there - unless they wanted to join our conversation - it's a communal, cozy table.  Seeing that my friend could now join us and round out our 4th as planned, I mentioned this to the hostess (as I am a huge rule follower) and was told \"no one could be seated after the party sat down\".  It made NO sense. She wasn't going to show up in 45 minutes and start a new tab - we would still finish at the same time.\n\nOur server came, he was delightful and encouraged our friend to come, but the damage was done and the tone was cast over the dinner as the 4th guest didn't show and we all felt that we let the snooty practices of a good restaurant overshadow our night and friendship.\n\nFood was good - very good - reminds me of Berretta or Zero Zero or Bar Bambino.\n\nOn the way out, I almost took a picture of the seat next to me that remained empty for the hour and a half that we were there.  People were standing drinking wine where we had been sent away from and the very same hostess went to seat a group at the communal table - when they expressed that they'd rather wait for a table she actually ROLLED HER EYES as she turned from them.  Seriously, I haven't seen that at a functioning restaurant - who needs that, ever?\n\nBut what sent me over the edge was that another host went up to a couple and announced that their table was ready.  The said that they were still waiting for one more and were told to let the host know when they were all there - now THAT is a common practice. But it seemed that they were allowed to put their name in and wait for the mystery friend to arrive when we weren't  and, as a result, our lovely dinner was followed by my moping up the damage of flour+water's wait-list policy.", "author": "Cheryl L."}

They take reservations for only 1/3 of the tables, the rest open for walk-ins.  The hostess was super kind and we didn't mind waiting for a much anticipated meal.\n\nTo begin we shared the Osso Pizza - it was pretty awesome.   Of the three main courses ordered - the least exciting was the tacconi verde with fennel, tarragon & prosecco braised mussels & clams.  The tortellini didn't taste freshly made at all - they were hard and tasted like something you could have gotten from a grocery store.  \n\nAside from my less than memorable meal - I have to say the other two were pretty great.

My aunt had the Ricotta Caramelle which was also melt-in-your-mouth amazing.  \n\nThe service was great and the atmosphere was nice.

The wait was long, but I don't understand why people get so worked up, if you come without a reservation then you wait, and if you don't want to then you don't and go somewhere else.  After our wait, during which we enjoyed a glass of earthy, not so sweet rose, we were seated at the communal table in front.  I would not suggest sitting here because the stools were so uncomfortable, my legs fell asleep dangling and propping them up meant my knees came up above the table and I had to sit sideways (in a skirt).  I feel like comfortable seating is a must, especially when the bill is going to be over $100.  Also, the decor is beautiful, with the signature oddities that Paxton's Gate specializes in and incorporated into the design, but the fish theme is a little confusing.\n\nOur server was friendly and knowledgeable, which was appreciated navigating the interesting Italian varietals on offer.  For two we shared the lamb tongue and warm potato salad with a perfectly poached egg and mustard dressing, the margarita pizza and the pumpkin tortelli.  All were very good, the salad was better than I imagined and my boyfriend had to defend his portion of tongue.  The pizza was thin, a fairly large pie and I'll defend the charring as part of the process which doesn't detract from the flavor of the beautiful, freshly food milled tomatoes and melted fresh mozzarella, and the high heat creates the crispy crust and tender bottom.  To say it's burnt is like complaining about the crispy bottom of a paella, or the browned top of mac and cheese, and misses the point.  The pasta was all about texture, smooth creamy, the fresh pasta very light and not over worked.  Our friendly neighbors shared their dishes with us, and every bite i had was memorable, thoughtfully prepared, both elegant and rustic--a hard parallel to achieve.  I would return, and look forward to it, but would make a reservation and sit a little closer to the floor.", "author": "Kathryn M."}

Boy, was the place packed.... The hostess told us she wasn't going to be able to seat us until 9:00 so we waited and had a drink. Finally we were seated after a hour and man it was worth the wait. Since we already were kind of full from the crap meal we had before we decided to order only 2 appetizers, a pizza and a pasta. the melon salad and the pig jowl appetizer were both tasty and flavorful. The squid ink pasta was packed full of seafood goodness in every bite. The pasta was with the egg in the middle was one of best pizzas I've ever had, the cheese was gooey and together with the peppers  made it so awesome. The only thing we didn't think was anything special was the chocolate espresso dessert we had. Everything else was great. I would definitely be back but i know there will never be a table available no earlier than 10pm every night unless you get lucky.

The pizza was well-executed, similar vein as Delfina but ten years from now I will not remember it.  Also had the peach salad and one of the pastas, also both good but not to die for.  Yet something about this place makes me want to come back.   My companion thought the service was \"wierd\" but I don't really know why she felt she had to be so critical.  Sure, they could use someone like Annie Stoll to whip them into shape, but the intentions are good.   After eating here we stopped at Gialina to pick up a pizza to go (they don't do to-go orders here), which I sampled and found to be much more of a taste delight.\nP.S.

Under the best conditions that may work but here it caused one issue after another.  Each of the waitstaff were nice enough. But it seemed like no one actually took responsibility  for our table and our order. After we shared a salad we waited for the pastas each of us ordered. but only one appeared. Apparently they thought we were sharing the pastas and were waiting for us to finish the first before bringing the second. So one of us finished eating while the other waited 20 minutes for their meal to arrive. All in all seven different individuals came to our table.

The pizza is one of the things they are known best for and while it was good, it wasn't anything special and definitely not worth the wait.

The pasta's are all very fresh and flavorful and some of the appetizers were very good, but there were just too many dishes that completely forgettable.. I didn't care for the wine list and the service was just OK. I guess the best way to sum up Flour + Water is this: if you can get a reservation easily, walk in and be seated at the time of your reservation, it is worth trying, but having a reservation and waiting an hour to have a forgettable meal isn't my idea of a fun Friday night. I do agree with a lot of other reviews that mentioned the potential that this place has... if they could just bring some of the creativity and outstanding execution of a few of their dishes (Steelhead Crudo appetizer) to the rest of their menu Flour + Water could justify a 3 day wait, but until that happens, I don't see my self returning.", "author": "Nick C."}

The wait was definitely ok because I think we expected to wait (especially since we didn't arrive until after 8pm). The hostess, while a bit pretentious from the exterior, actually made a point to remember our faces and our reservation name much after we first arrived. That was definitely impressive. The con however was that we were told we had to stay within the \"waiting area\",  otherwise they could not hold our name on the wait list. They eagerly put the wine list in front of us, but we resisted. It was a bit pretentious that they expected you to wait within the confines of the restaurant and drink until you were seated. \n\nTHE WINE: We had a bottle of Italian wine (I can't remember the name) recommended by the bartender. I asked for a dry red with a medium body and he was definitely right on with his recommendation. It was mild at first, but when paired with the food, it definitely provided a great compliment. \n\nTHE SEATING: There's a large community table and the entry, scatterings of small tables throughout the restaurant and a bar with stools. We sat at the bar and I highly recommend sitting at the bar as opposed to the tables. We received some serious one on one attention compared to other yelpers reviews about bad service. The bartender was knowledgeable, friendly, yet didn't overwhelm you with unnecessary conversation during your dining experience. \n\nTHE FOOD: We had the bolleta butter lettuce salad with pancetta mushrooms and egg yolk. This was definitely a great starter salad and the egg yolk, interestingly enough provided a good contrast to the salty pancetta next to the sweet and natural mushrooms. Next we had a margherita pizza and the maltagliata pasta. We heard much about their  pasta surprisingly enough, but it definitely lived up to its expectations. The pasta had a great sauce base and the flavors of the ragu, the homemade pasta, and zucchini were very complimentary. We'll definitely be back to explore some of their other pastas. As for the pizza, it was definitely good. We had to ask for a side of cheese and peppers, but we were fairly satisfied. The crust was good, a little bit too soft but I usually don't complain much with the Neopolitan style pizza. I think I like the crust at Gialina just a tad more. For dessert we had the chocolate budino with espresso cream and sea salt and the olive oil cake and ice cream with fresh strawberries and candied fennel. YUM. The desserts definitely left us on a happy note. At the recommendation of the bartender, I had the olive oil cake and he gave us a complimentary glass of champagne to go with the cake. It was an amazing pairing and really made the olive oil flavors come out in a very special way.  \n\nGreat new restaurant if you have the time to wait.", "author": "Julie C."}

This was the most scattered, inconsistent and slow service I have seen in a long time.  \n\nI thought the wine list was great.  All affordable bottles from Italy and some really nice choices.  However, to quote my boyfriend, \n\"yeah i liked the wine list too...luckily i know a little about italian wines because no one in there knew their ass from a chianti\"\n\nThe food was well above average.  Some of the table favorites were the Margarita Pizza as mentioned above - we ended up ordering two, the Maltagliati and the Young Chicken which was so moist!  The Lamb was also amazing.  The pizzas beside the margarita were ok but I think they switch these around.  The only issue with the food was the sardine appetizer which came with one sardine on it...for $10?  \n\nThe restaurant was also really nice inside.  \n\nThis place needs to get their service on track.

Cute place--rustic meets contemporary sleek. Pork loin fork-tender but not all that flavorful. Funghi pizza with green garlic nice but every other place in the East Bay serves wood-fired pizza topped with the usual suspects of nettles and farm-fresh eggs, and so far, no one has crust to write home about.

But beware of this pitfall: the roving eyes of the random couple who is bored and boring and looking for a buffer! Two such ravenous beings with nothing to say to one other desperately sought our eye contact in the blind hope of joining our little party. It was kind of spooky. The solution: avert your eyes. Focus on the food and your fabulous friend. Everything here is yummy, and I do mean everything. The sweetbreads (so I heard) were to die for. The tortellini with celery root almost had me in the throes of a \"When Harry Met Sally\" deli moment. Almost. It was that first spoonful of chocolate Budino with sea salt that really pushed me over the edge. I was in multiple states of bliss. If people gawked, I did not care.

For starters, the hostess was snippy and super fake-perky, not to mention grossly overestimated our wait (\"The wait is about an hour and a half!!!\").  Luckily, we only had to wait around 20 minutes to be seated, but were not offered any wine while we milled about at the front door, which would have been a nice touch.  Our waitress was nice but inexperienced, and seemed way too young.  Everything we asked about was \"FANTASTIC!!\"...no distinguishing any of the menu items or adding any nuance whatsoever.  The staff did not seem well-trained or gracious, particularly for a place that is expensive for what you get, I would not expect the junior varsity team to be running the place.  We were seated across from one another at the asymmetrical community table, at a part in the table that was extra wide, which was awkward and forced us to yell to hear one another (I was twice as close to the woman sitting next to me than I was to my boyfriend).  Not a particularly romantic set-up for a Friday night.  We finally asked to move (we later noted two couples who were sat in the exact same spot, and also wound up moving).   Our waitress was super slow, and we sat hungrily for over a half hour while the people at the table who ordered long after us got their food before we did, and our pasta came before our pizza (which seemed odd, considering the pizza comes first on the menu and makes a more appropriate appetizer).  The pizza was completely average (way too few toppings--a few blobs of cheese, which left half of the slices naked, more like eating lightly oiled flatbread for $18), and the pasta was completely flavorless and desperately in need of salt.  An anemic pizza, bland pasta, three under-poured glasses of wine came to a total of $80.  The waitress overcharged us for two of the glasses, but because we were so sick of the place, had no interest in waiting for her to actually correct the bill. Oh yeah, and the menu is trying WAY too hard--we're \"foodies\" and all, but \"braised goat shoulder\" and indecipherable pasta dishes is just pushing it.  Stick to Range and Maverick, everyone.

We ended up coming on a Monday night and it was jam packed. After our name was taken my wife and I ordered some drinks and hung out around the communal table. Spacing was really tight and it was a little uncomfortable shifting and moving for 30 minutes while we waited.

Very dissapointed. Then we got the roasted brussel sprouts, aged goat cheese & almonds. I thought they were pretty good; my wife loved them. Our pizzas were hit and miss: The margherita was very good but the salsiccia - nettles, garlic white wine sausage & bagna c\u00e0uda was pretty gross. Overwhelmingly gross.

I've had so much better. For dessert we had a polenta cake with blood orange reduction and honey thyme ice cream, by far my favorite of the night. The service was slow...and it seemed like everyone was working together but it was packed. The female server with the boy short hair rocked though...suggesting perfect pairings for dessert wines and being super friendly, helpful, and informative.  All said and done, it's worth a try but not in my top 10.", "author": "Michele M."}

So glad we made reservations (2 months in advance on open table), because it was a 1.5 hour wait for walk-ins when we were seated at 5:45 pm.  We got some sort of crab appetizer, which was tasty though little more than lump crab meat in a crab broth with celery root.  For our entrees, we got the salsiccia pizza and a pasta with rabbit dish.  We agreed that the pizza was better than the pasta, but this could have been because of our choice of pasta.  We rounded out the real with some lattes and the chocolate budino.  OMG, the choc budino was amazing.  By far, the hihglight of the meal.  Still, we had high hopes for the pizza and pasta and were a little disappointed.  Next time, we might just stick with Delfina.", "author": "Natalie A."}

We had the cucumber salad, pancetta pizza and the summer squash as a side dish.  All the food was really fresh and the flavors worked well.  We lined up before they opened at 5:30pm on a Saturday and got seats at the bar without a reservation.  I think I like the Beretta experience a little bit more, except Beretta can be a little too noisy.  flour + water was actually nice and quiet because they have some sound deadening panels on the ceiling.

I love osso buco or anything topped with bone marrow (try Ray's Hellburger in DC area) so I was pumped to see this on the menu. When it came out I almost forgot what pizza I ordered coz all I saw on the top of it was rabe and shaved fontina. Looking closely, I was able to detect some brown bits of marrow. They burst my bubble after seeing how skint they were with the marrow. Don't get me wrong it was still good, I just set my expectations too high. Regarding the crust, I was expecting more of a Napolitan style, chewy semolina but it was more floury tasting. Although the pizza is definitely overrated here, the roasted pork was the best I've ever eaten in a restaurant. If I could describe how good it was in one word, it would be \"orgasmic\"! I almost ordered another one so I could have it all to myself but thankfully I have a loving wife who shares. It was so good I don't even remember what came with it. Polenta and kale maybe? For desert I had the chocolate bundino and she had the blood orange upside down cake. The bundino was good. It wasn't the first time I had sea salt and chocolate together and I like that combo a lot. I still preferred the upside down cake though. Overall my rating was based on how amazing that pork was. After standing around holding a bottle of wine in the corner for 45 minutes, waiting on a table (we just walked in, no rez) , it still was worth the wait eating that.", "author": "Carlo X."}

We are a group of great food and wine lovers (some are restaurant owners). Although it was very busy the staff was friendly and we did not have to wait too long to get seated at the community table! Everything we ordered was delicious, savory and fresh!!! Naturally I could not wait to take some other friends there in order for them to enjoy the same experience we had. And it finally happened, we went back two weeks ago and even though we did not have any reservations, the friendly staff :) seated us after an hour wait and I find that sipping good wine with your friends on a Saturday night while waiting for a table is fun. The table we got was great and sure enough we were not disappointed with the food. I loved their autumnal menu, their dessert menu and they make a pretty mean cappuccino! :) I could go on describing what we liked, but will limit myself to saying that I would and will recommend Flour and Water to all my friends.

Neo-Asian meet pizza and pasta? Not feeling it. Anyway, lovely staff, very kind and attentive, but zero communication as so many times we were asked the same questions by the revolving cast of characters. \"Water? Can I explain anything? Wine? Oh, I see it's already been ordered. Here's your bill. Hi, would you like to see a desert menu? Ah, I see you've already paid your bill.\" Still, they meant well and were lovely. The food was nice, although a bit curious in some circumstances - the pork cheeks at first had an odd rancid grape seed oil smell but after that dissipated I was able to appreciate the dish which was quite excellent and beautifully prepared. The fusilli was just ordinary. My dinner date (by far the best part of the whole experience) commented, \"Well there's some good stuff in there, you just have to do a lot of stirring and get to the bottom.\"  The shaved asparagus was nice with a great caper vinaigrette, but the pancetta smelled off. I have HEARD they serve lovely bread with the entrees, though it never hit our table even though we had two very saucy dishes. On the bright side the kitchen is open until mid-night. I'd certainly go back, but next time I'd try a range of the pizzas which looked great and seemed to be what most people were ordering. In the end of the day it's certainly no A-16, but then again you don't have to go to the godawful marina either, so that's a BIG plus.

The food was lovely and the wine was great, but the service is RUSHED.  Our whole meal (appetizer included) lasted about thirty minutes.  We hardly had time to pick a bottle of wine before our first dish came out and then we ended up sitting at the bar for twenty minutes after we finished the meal simply because we hadn't had time to finish our wine in the 15 minute frenzy in which our food was brought out.  I was pretty disappointed when I realized that we had spent longer waiting in line than we did actually enjoying ourselves and our dinner.  I understand that they are busy and want to efficiently wait tables (which they do very well), but sometimes it is nice to have time to relax and enjoy each course before the next one arrives.  We found ourselves eating quickly to keep up with the pace of the service.  Had they given us more time to finish our food and savor the wine (that we had chosen specifically to go with our food), we definitely would have enjoyed our time more.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-07-30", "description": "I finally made it to Flour + Water after anticipating its opening for weeks and canceling my first reservations due to an overwhelmingly busy schedule. We called 2 weeks in advance and were only able to secure 8:45 reservations on a Tuesday, so be aware that people are still elbowing each other down to get in. We arrived right at our reservation time and were told it would be just a few minutes and were invited to fortify ourselves with a glass of wine, but we chose to huddle in the corner and dodge the other waiting patrons and wait staff until our table was ready. We only waited a few minutes before we were lead to our seats by a cheery hostess. Our waitress popped up about 5 minutes after we sat down, but since my dining companion and I had not seen each other for some time we were deep in conversation and needed a few extra moments to look over the menu. The menu needed a fair amount of decoding and interpreting since I don't speak Italian and I don't eat meat. The waitress was super helpful explaining the dishes to us and pointed out the dishes that could be modified to suit a vegetarian palette. We decided on the roasted corn, tomato and fried squash salad to start. We shared, and it was the perfect size to get us going but not fill us up before the main event. The tomatoes, as my dining partner commented, 'tasted like they were grown in an organic garden out back the second we put our order in.' The dressing was a light balsamic and didn't compromise any of the flavors.  It came topped with a big piece of deep fried squash on top, which of course was delicious, but when I say it was deep fried, I mean it was deep fried. For mains, we chose the margherita pizza and the corzetti pasta. The pizzas are rather large, they definitely hang over a regular sized dinner plate, but the crust is super thin, so you don't get filled up on tasteless bread. The majority of the pizza was the sauce with about 6 large chunks of fresh mozzarella melted on top. The sauce tasted like it was made from the same magical tomatoes on the starter salad. It was sweet and fresh and flowed with all the other flavors. The seasoning was subtle, but not bland. The corzetti pasta was also subtly flavored, but delicious. It came topped with chopped walnuts, which added an interesting taste and texture. The portion was the perfect size (keep in mind I am a bitsy little girl). The wine choice was decent, but options for glasses was a bit limited. Splitting a bottle is more the way to go, but alas, my companion was not drinking and apparently it is socially unacceptable to consume an entire bottle yourself (but what happens behind closed doors is no one's business but your own). The service was great. We were never waiting for anything and the time between the salad and the mains was perfect. A man who I assume to be the owner came to our table to check in on us as well. The space is very small, but well put together for what they had to work with. There is a big communal table at the front and group tables at the back. The website says parties larger than 6 are not allowed, and I definitely wouldn't try bringing more than 3 other people with me anyway. Prices weren't bad, pretty comparable to any other place just like it in the city. Flour +Water is a good restaurant and I think it will come more into its own as it gets older, but they must have had some damn good PR connections because it definitely got hyped more than it deserves. I would go back again, but I'm not going to fight for reservations the next time someone suggests dinner. I gave 3 stars because on its own, Flour + Water is decent, but I had to try to even out the overzealous 5 star ratings.", "author": "Breanna L."}

Perhaps because I was expecting zing! boom! pow!--I was dissapointed.  The food was good, sure, but not THAT good.  Not out the door line every night good.  I had the mint tagliatelle and even the waitress admitted that the taste, along with most of the pastas, derived it's principle flavor from butter.  That along with the razor clam crudo appetizer (I really wish she had just said \"fried\" instead of \"misto\" when describing the dish- didn't think it would ALL be fried!)

It's all fine and dandy that you wood fire it, but be a little creative.  A margherita with barely four spoonfuls of bufula? Throw me a bone here.  I know Italians don't put a ton of cheese on their pizza, my family is from Naples and I've been there many times.  But they're also not lactose intolerant.

The crust was so tasty and chewy, crisp and thin and from a wood fired oven (probably why the wait- too many ordered at the same time).  The only thing I could suggest is that they actually use more basil (only a few bits were visible).  My partner had the braised pork cheeks and although I'm a vegetarian, I had to try the borlotto beans and chard that came with.  I definitely overlooked the fact they were touched by swine...DELICIOUS!  I had the triangulotti (a triangular ravioli) filled with nettle and caramelized onions and served with roasted artichokes in a butter sauce...HEAVEN on a plate and not a huge portion which was great given the pizza starter.

After about a 40min we were seated at the bar area so it really wasn't that bad of a wait. We started off by sharing their osso pizza and WOW... i normally don't get that excited about pizza, but this was amazing. Thin crust with just the right amount of bite, melted fontina with rabe (pleasantly charred) and bits of roasted bone marrow. I could've had the entire thing by myself.  We then shared a taglietelle with fresh peas, morels and trumpets with just a touch of a creaminess, and a fat spaghetti like dish with slow roasted pork chunks in some kind of a herby-olive oil ragu. Both pastas were fresh made, perfectly al dente and so flavorful.  We saved room for dessert and shared the chocolate budino and upside down blood orange polenta cake.  I can see how if one comes with huge expectations or had listened to months of hype, one might find this somewhat anticlimatic...but if you appreciate freshly made pizza dough, freshly made pastas perfectly paired up with equally fresh, unique and flavorful ingredients then I'd say this place is worth the  trip and the wait.", "author": "Beverly C."}

We ordered the oxtail terrine appetizer w/ chanterelles (yes it's delicious! ok i get excited about anything w/ chanterelles, but c'mon it has fried meat patties in it!), bianca pizza (anchovy, olives, chilis) - overall good, but not really stellar or my favorite - next time I'll try the heirloom tomato pizza, pasta w corn & w/ bitter honey and it's leaving my head the real name, but it was delicious and seasonal,  and the lamb roast special - probably my favorite of the night. Unfortunately we didn't have any dessert because we were meeting up for bi-rite, but looking over to our neighbors at the communal table everything looked delicious!\n\nThe only thing else I'd say is beware, there will probably be a 1 hr wait (at least), but grab a bottle of wine and start pre-drinking. :) Bon Appetit!", "author": "Jeannette L."}

This was a couple weeks ago, but they definitely seem overwhelmed (crazy crowded even at 6 pm on a Tuesday and apparently it's been like that since they opened) so that could be part of the overall experience falling flat, but the pizza was too doughy and had too much crust in proportional to toppings which - if you are going to serve wood oven Italian-style pizza - is a big no-no in my mind. Good wine selection - including a number from one of my favorite regions (Alto Adige), so I'd give it a go again, but it wasn't anything to rave about in my book. The mullet starter was interesting with deep fried lemon slices, onions and the fish, but not stellar and the cold pea soup with basil which is something of a signature dish wasn't quite right either. Seems like after buzz dies down would be good for apps and wine at the bar type thing, esp. since literally around the corner from my house.

The servers are all nice and tatted up to the max, the bathroom is chock full of weird Paxton Gate-esque doo-dads and the mural on the back wall is cute, if not totally trendy.  \nHowever the point of this review is the food and service, so here goes- we were seated right as we walked in and greeted promptly, I asked a million questions about the pasta dishes which were all answered in a straight forward, non pretentious manner.  After ordering the asparagus and quail egg salad with bacon and arugula, the pizza biancoverde with ricotta and squah, and the puttanesca pasta, our food started arriving almost immediately.  The salad was stellar, overflowing with salty goodness like olives and capers.  I definitely reccomend this dish.  Next was the pizza which was your average thin crust, wood fired, gourmet pizza with coins of squash and an ample amount of cheese.  I dug it.  The puttanesca was probably the least impressive of all the dishes but by no means was it BAD.  It was served with a bucatini noodle which my father found a bit too thick.  However the sauce had a good bite to it and again, olives make me happy.  The dessert was just alright to me, but I was so stuffed it didn't matter.  We ordered the chocolate budino with sea salt and espresso cream based on hear-say and near by tables doing the same.  I thought the salt was a little much, but the chocolate flavor was outstanding.  Coffee was a french press, always appreciated.  Our server was attentive throughout the whole meal and delivered our check promptly.

The pizza was Italian style. Think Delfina Pizzeria. I had the chicken which was perfectly cooked. Tender and spicy. The dessert was unbelievable. A wonderful combination of chocolate, espresso, toffee and salt in a mousy delight. For two glasses of wine, 1 pizza, 1 order of chicken and 1 dessert it was about $60 and we were full and extremely satisfied. The atmosphere was also nice. There are some table in the back that have a romantic private feel and and in the front there is a bar and a large communal table. All very nice, clean and fun feeling. My only complaint was the predicted wait time. We there at about 8pm. We were told that it was a 2-2.5 hour wait for a table for two and that we could not put our name down and return later. We left. 5 min later we came back, mostly because I had my heart set on trying it. We when we returned we were told it would be a 1.5 hour wait for a table. We ordered a drink and were seated about 45 min later. Which was GREAT, but I thought it was strange that they had such a hard time predicting the wait time. Alls well that ends well.

Heading there with an already positive attitude based on every review I had read may have helped but I was still blown away. We were only able to get a 9:15pm spot and got there a bit late so had to wait a little while (our fault). Fortunately the lovely hostess brought us the wine menu and we decided to enjoy a glass while we patiently awaited our table. \nUpon sitting down we then had the tough decision of ordering. After a few recommendations from our delightful waitress we eagerly waited for the magic to being. I was very impressed with the heirloom tomato appetizer (somewhat small but so flavorful) it was delicious. Being there with 2 friends we opted on \"family style\" and ordered 1 pizza and 2 pastas to share. The pomodoro pizza w/ fresh arugula and garlic was incredible and the lobster mushroom pasta dish was my favorite. Since the portions aren't oversized we had room for dessert (yay!). The chocolate bundin was AMAAAAZING!! So rich and like fudge I hadn't tasted something that delectable in a long time :) \nAlso we really enjoyed the ambiance because as far as I'm concerned that can make or break a restaurant experience...it was wonderful. Dimly lit but not too dark....nice background music and the interior was just designed with the right taste. On top of that it was very reasonably priced for the food quality. We spent $130 with tip for 3 of us with wine, an appetizer, 3 entrees and 2 desserts-not bad at all! I highly recommend this place as long as you can get a reservation.

We were a party of 3, and we arrived at 5:45 pm (opens at 5:30) on a Sat night.  Poor timing.  We were told that the wait might be 1.5 hours.  We ended up waiting almost 2 hours, while parties of two just went past us in line over and over again.  I was nice about it, but in retrospect it wasn't really well handled.  Several couples only waited 15-20 minutes or even less, because they have few tables for 4.  However, they have a large communal table and a bar, but as couples left those seats no effort was made to rearrange or hold the seats empty for a few minutes for parties of 3 or more.  In Tokyo, the fairest place in the world where people wait in line for everything, this would never have happened as it would be considered dishonorable to let people just walk in while others had already waited for over an hour.  The waitress and owner who were there were pretty nice and clearly knew what had happened to us, but unfortunately not much was done about it. \nOtherwise, the food was very good but not exceptional.  The pizzas were good, but we live a few blocks from Pizzetta 211 and I would consider the pizzas very similar in quality.  The pastas were excellent. We tried all 3 desserts on offer and they were all good, but nothing outstanding. The prices are posted on their website, so no surprises there, but it isn't particular inexpensive for such a rustic experience.\nOverall, if we hadn't been passed over by droves of 2-party diners we  would have had a positive experience.  As it was poorly handled and the food was not exceptional, I don't expect to return.", "author": "Craig F."}

Yes, the restaurant was really packed. There's no waiting room so pretty much everyone who's waiting for the tables had to wait outside in the cold. There's no heat lamp or anything. We ordered bottle of wine to the waitress who seemed to be the only waitress in the whole restaurant. Of course, she forgot to bring us the wine. This red hair waitress looked really overwhelmed  and did not look any apologetic about forgetting our wine. I just don't even remembered this woman ever smiled the whole night we were there. She comes by to our table to ask \"Are you guys ready to order?\" We were about to order and say something to her and she was already gone to the next table....And that wasn't only time she did that. After we finally manged to order with the red hair waitress, our appetizers came at least 45 minutes later. This is unbelievable. I hope the owner of this restaurant is reading my review because that is not the way to treat your customers. If your workers and your kitchen are not equipped to take many customers, you need reduce number of tables or make it work so that you can feed your customers before they die for hunger! Your place is a famous for pizza and pasta. And you can only make 4 pizzas at the time? \n\nOk, let's talk about food because I'm very healthy eater and I love eating and cooking. So for me, going out to dinner, I expect a lot from the restaurants.  This restaurant use local organic ingredients. That's great. I love that but why do we have to make every sauce made with a lot of butter? All sauce is so over-powering that you can't really taste the actual food that you are eating.  That really bugs me. My food theory is if  you have great organic ingredients, don't mess with complicated sauce. Every dish is too rich and so heavy. Never get chicken entree. Chicken has no taste but they put a lot of panchetta with the heavy sauce so if you don't like beacon taste, this will be the worst dish you can get. On top of that, mustard greens were not washed properly so they were very sandy. \n\nFinally after our dessert, our waitress came with the bill and asked us to leave the table as soon as possible so they can still seat people after 9:30pm. Amazing...\n\nThis restaurant has gotten many good reviews and I can't even believe what we experienced that night. Food was below average and we've spent $70 per person. Wow, very expensive for poor service and food. I can definitely don't need to go back to that restaurant again.", "author": "kumiko m."}

Are we comfortable with the prices we pay at very casual restaurants (even if the food is good) only to be abused by the staff? What privilege are we paying for? I own a flat in the Mission and am always happy when another good restaurant comes to our neck of the woods, so I was very excited to hear that this recently opened, chic eatery has been getting great word of mouth, locally and in national magazines. I've been several times and the food is quite good. I'm not sure it's $20 for a plate of pasta good (it's only flour and water, right?), but it's good. In the past, I've received good (again, not great) service from the bartender, hostess and wait staff. But I have an issue with my last visit. \n\nA friend was visiting from out of the country and the decision was made by her and another friend to go to the cool new place. We were unable to get a reservation but were seated within about 20 minutes of arrival (8:50 pm). We ordered three $9 tomato salads, requesting them without onions. All three arrived with onions. One was sent back, the other two of us ate around them. We also ordered a bottle of wine. We were a little surprised when it arrived open. When I asked the waitress to let one of the others in our party taste before pouring, she told us that they \"don't do that\". In other words, we ordered the $42 bottle and to cover their end of the bargain, the bartender opened and tasted it for us. Since she was satisfied that it was potable, we were stuck with it, no matter what we thought. After my friends and I looked at each other with dismay, I asked the server to pour. She wasn't having that either - apparently that's not in their mission statement. We had to pour ourselves. \n\nNow, while I feel fortunate to be able to splurge occasionally on a fairly pricey bottle of wine and dinner in this economy and may seem like I'm whining, I feel that on the other end of this deal, service providers should provide a modicum of, well, service, regardless of the economy. As I said, the food was good, including three pasta dishes and wonderful pot-de-creme with homemade coffee ice cream that we shared.

We also got a pizza (salaccia: sausage, fennel, peppers). Lets just say I think someone accidentally spilled the jar of salt in the dough because we couldnt even finish we became instantly bloated from all the salt with one bite. The desserts were good (basil panna cotta only OK, chocolate budini thing was good) but nothing to come back for. Lastly, the wine list was completely unimpressive. My boyfriend is somewhat of a wine snob, especially when it comes to Italian wines. Italian wines are meant to be paired with food. The wine list did not pair well with the food and people were drinking glasses while waiting... that kind of rubbed him the wrong way (but I know that is a very particular statement that is unique to him... just throwing it out there). I am really sad to say I was not impressed. The worst part about the whole thing, is when I came back to work Monday and talked to one of the doctors about my experience, he said the same thing... he doesnt really like it, doesnt think its worth the ridiculous wait and never goes there anymore... so why did he recommend it?!

In lieu of the art, it definitely has a warm feeling to it.  I was craving pasta and silly my, I figured it would have plenty of it given the name.  For a place named flour + water there should be more than the measly 5 pasta dishes on the menu.  Perhaps a name change is in order?? Service was very friendly and they were packed.  We didn't have reservations so the wait time was around 45 min.  They told us that from the get go though so no problems there.  They should at least let you order some appetizers though for the wait.  It would go a long way to appeasing the hungry.  Or serve some bread, or serve something to snack on.  when we sat at the communal table frankly there wasn't much community conversation.  everyone was pretty much coupled up and doing their own thing so bit of a let down on talking it up with some new people.  we ordered the sheep toungue appetizer, the pork shoulder paperdelle, and chestnut pasta with duck.  Everything was good, I would call the tongue probably the best dish but it was served as one piece sliced down the middle steak style and usually I don't like to see exactly what I'm eating used to be.  they should have sliced it up a bit.  It was akin to getting the chicken head served on the platter in a chinese restaurant.  That's cool there cuz I'm not paying top dollar and I'm expecting it.  It was a bad call by the chefs at this joint.   Finished off the meal with the Chocolate Budino.  This was a fantastic tasting chocolate treat but it would be better served as a pot of something to scoop up or on top of something substantial like a cookie or hell even a piece of bread, perhaps a waffle.

I read all the negative reviews with my mouth hanging open. I was horrified that most of the negative reviews were from people who had never even eaten the food! You have to understand that this restaurant just opened a few weeks ago and hasn't had an opportunity to maneuver the enormous popularity it received so immediately! I make my reservations and have never had to wait. The staff has been amazingly friendly and polite, knowledgeable and helpful. I've been to the whole list of comparable restaurants (A16, Delfina, Beretta, etc.) and found Flour + Water to outshine them all (well, maybe on par with Delfina :). The appetizers are all perfect; the pizza is awesome; all the dishes are interesting and utilize impressive ingredients. Make a reservation like you have to do at any other fabulous restaurant, stop complaining, EAT THE FOOD, and update your opinion. You'd rather have prompt food instead of good? Domino's has a 30-minute gurantee.", "author": "Jasmine d."}

Pizza was forgettable, really, though i hear its what this place is known for - we had the margherita with anchovies.. - Ideale in north beach is actually similar but better pizza.  overall - if i could i'd do 3.5 stars.", "author": "hary n."}
