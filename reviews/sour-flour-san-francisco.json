Cat is clearly experienced, and we all had a ridiculously fun workshop with her! She answered all our questions with a smile. We had a range of experience in our class, from people who have never baked before to amateur bread bakers. \n\nThe workshop itself was efficient and productive. I never felt like she was wasting my time, but still felt that I got my money's worth. And we also got to take our own starter bread home! \n\nOh, and the sourdough flatbread we made was absolutely delicious. We added arugula, olive oil, and parmesan cheese on top, as well as some sesame + poppy seeds. \n\nLike many of the reviewers here, we bought our tickets off of Groupon which made this whole experience a great deal. \n\nNote: This place is inside La Victoria Bakery -- just go inside and all the way to the back. There should be a sign-in sheet. It gets pretty hot inside (as it is a kitchen), so make sure to wear layers so you can peel them off when you get sweaty!", "author": "Christine L."}

Friendly instructor, Cat Shimizu, who is full of knowledge on breads and baking.\n\nThe follow-up e-mail is fabulous and so detailed.  I followed it but I'm guessing that I didn't use the right flour or lacked the right temp for optimal living yeast survival.  \n\nIt had been 3 months since I took home my starter (after this class) and fed it on a monthly basis.  Unfortunately, I killed it right before Thanksgiving and had to compost it.  Maybe I will buy some in the near future?! Then again...I don't have the best luck with bread...at least not at home.  (I know, it takes practice, but I'm plumb out of surface area to practice and clean up that many times...)\n\nHighly recommend this class.

We also did it to celebrate my friend's birthday and it was such a fun experience!\n\nCat is a great teacher. Whether you're an avid cook/baker or novice, Cat provides the right amount of explanation to satiate the cooks who want to know more of the science or technicalities involved yet also makes it simple enough for the non-cooks. She e-mails you all her explanations in a hand-out afterwards, so there's no need to try to remember everything or take notes.\n\nThe class is small - about 10 people and we all got our hands dirty and got into the mix. Since there's time involved in making a loaf of bread, this class focuses on the starter, the ratios needed to make a loaf, the stretch-and-fold process - which we were able to do three times, so that we could make our own pizza flatbread! We had a little party afterwards - which was a nice surprise! You don't make the actual loaf (not enough time in a two-hour class), but you get to go home with your own starter, and make a loaf at home!\n\nWe were so happy after this class that we immediately signed up for Cat's Bread 2 class next month. I highly recommend this class!\n\nAnother big plus....the class is held at La Victoria Bakery in the Mission - so you get a real taste of what it's like to be in a working, large commercial bakery. It's awesome!", "author": "Ning R."}

Cat's class was a fun and relaxing afternoon, providing insight into the daunting and previously elusive realm of long-fermentation bread making! \n\nThe course is taught out of La Victoria Bakery in the heart of San Francisco's mission district. Class size for the beginner 2 hour class was 10 people- the perfect size to get a great hands on experience. Cat started by introducing us to her 9 year old starter Dolce, whose \"grandchildren\" were gifted to us at the end of class, and named on the spot. Cat walked us through the scientific aspects of the maintenance of a yeast & bacteria colony in a way that was fun and approachable. We sampled the starters, and were taught not only how to make a dough, but how to rest and stretch a dough to build up gluten strength.\n\nClass was ended with the aforementioned take home starters, and a delicious freshly baked sourdough flatbread lunch! Cat followed up class with an email blast of her favorite recipes, loaded with personal insight and tips- truly a great touch.\n\nThe most profound thing about the class, however, had to be Cat's overall demeanor in the kitchen and clear love of all things fermented- especially bread! Our starters are at home, and we cannot wait to start a long relationship with homemade bread making! This class would make a fantastic present for anyone who loves bread, fermentation, or fun!\n\nCheers to Sour Flour- and Cheers to Cat!", "author": "Lauren S."}

I saw this workshop on Yelp and I couldn't imagine a better class for Binky and I to take. The class definitely lived up to all of its wonderful reviews! \n\nBinks and I have taken one class at Sur La Table (fun, but kinda elementary for Binky who loves to cook). This class was VERY different from the Sur La Table class we took in the past. There seemed to be more people in this class with an ACTUAL interest in baking bread (i.e. people asked VERY technical questions, had baked bread before, worked in the culinary industry, etc.). For me (avid bread eater, no experience baking bread), the class did seem a little intimidating and advanced (I didn't even know what a starter was before taking this class...). However, the class was kind/friendly and I felt mostly at ease, despite my lack of experience. \n\nCat, our instructor, was lively, fun, passionate, calm, cool, collected, wild, and wonderful. There really aren't enough adjectives in the English language to describe her as an instructor. Not only is she incredibly knowledgeable about the bread-making process BUT she was also able to make us LAUGH during the instuction (so much fun). The class was very interactive (not just with the dough, but with the other participants) and everyone in the class seemed to enjoy each other and the class (I definitely agree with other Yelpers -- this seemed like a bunch of friends getting together to bake, rather than an actual cooking class). In the end, everyone left with little, individual flatbreads (all personalized with our own seasonings and toppings). \n\nSome tips: *class is in back of La Victoria bakery -- just wait around in the seating area until Cat comes out, Cat came out a few minutes AFTER 3:00PM (Binky and I were confused and almost walked into the kitchen) *dress in layers/comfy clothes (clothes can get a little flour-y/sweaty) *germaphobes might take problem with the fact that EVERYONE is squishing, kneading, playing with the same huge mound of dough -- don't be surprised with other people's fingers in YOUR bread *no sitting for ~2 hours -- my feet were a little sore by the end of class *other chefs in kitchen cooking (class isn't the only thing going on behind La Victoria's!) *handout is emailed after class with detailed instructions -- don't worry about taking notes!!", "author": "Christine H."}

We took home a container with ~110 grams of starter (8+ years of flavor in the making!) as well as our own piece of sourdough flatbread (or whatever was left after snacking on it at the end!).\n\nFor more detail:\n- A friend found the Groupon for the Starter Workshop Bread-Making Class which offered two spots for a total of $79 - how could we pass it up?!  (Options for one or four were also available.)\n- We walked into La Victoria just before 3:00pm to find a sign for Sour Flour with a sign-in sheet and nametags in the back seating area. Cat came out a little after 3, probably to allow people to straggle in, to greet us and take us to the back where we would be working.\n- Just like the email said, it was WARM back there, so dressing in layers was great advice, seeing as how it was chilly and drizzly outside. There was a bin for bags/purses and rack with hangers for jackets, all right near the work area, so they were safe.\n- Cat had us wash our hands, and then gather around a large work table so she could teach us some of the history and basic science involved in sourdough preparation, and then we got into working some dough! Questions were welcome and encouraged throughout the entire session.\n- The rest of the time was a mix of us working the dough together (first half) or individually (second half), and Cat giving us more information about how to care for, nurture, develop, and use our starter.\n- We ended up with our own small rounds of dough, which we formed as flatbread in shapes as we pleased and topped with sesame seeds, poppy seeds, and salt before Cat set them in the oven.\n- Once they were done, we regrouped out in the back seating area (where we began) and feasted on our flatbread with spinach, arugala, olive oil, and grated cheese!  It was great!\n\nI would highly recommend this to anyone who's curious about making bread and/or to anyone who just wants to broaden their culinary experience!  Cat also sends out a handout to recap what she taught, along with a few other online resources.\n\nALSO - $$ because you DO spend more than $10 per person, but for a workshop like this, it is definitely more like $ when compared to other workshops and classes! It's a two-hour session packed with information, demonstrations, hands-on activity, and tasting. With the Groupon, it's SUPER affordable!", "author": "Greg L."}

I think I'm a fairly advanced baker (that or I am not that critical of my own shit), so all the kneading and rising wasn't all that exciting. To be honest, I really wanted to do the starter workshop, but I was only in SF for two days and it wasn't on a Monday. I had found a deal via google offers for a $40 class.\n\nI had a lot of fun - Kat was super nice and knowledgeable and showed us techniques. The other students were nice and the class was maxed out at 8 people, and that's about all that fit at the table. It was fun to see other people just as nerded out on bread as I was. There was an older couple and the gentleman had brought in his own starter and a loaf that he had just baked. We may not have been on the same political spectrum (telling him my job had a chilling effect), but once the convo veered back to bread, he was really friendly, inquisitive, and even offered me some of his starter to take back to the OC.\n\nI'd recommend going, though make sure you read which class you're taking since it may be info you already know if you've already handled bread. I prob wouldn't pay full price for them though.\n\nI got to bring home one baked loaf and one thing of dough which I baked at home. Fun fun!!", "author": "Christina K."}

She reminds me of an acupuncturist I know, which is a good thing because when it comes to baking, I need all the therapy I can get! She gives each person a bit of individualized attention but also doesn't call anyone out when they're struggling. She provided lots of encouragement and I liked her \"chill\" attitude. I liked Cat's explanation of the science behind dough kneading, moisture and mixing. She was very knowledgeable and I would love to learn more from her. At the end of the class, she walked around socializing and even had a bagel, which I think shows that she still loves this job. \n\nLa Victoria bakery is in the Mission District, which was quite a ways from Fisherman's Wharf where we were staying. The bakery itself is not the nicest, so it isn't the first place I'd think would host a baking class. No matter, the kitchen is big enough for classes of 10 or so, and it has the well-worn appearance of a long-running bread bakery, complete with a slightly leaky roof. I felt like I was intruding a bit when we had to go through adjacent work space areas to get to the class space.\n\nBagel instructions are emailed to participants, which was alright, but since I'm a novice and I love instructions, I like following along to see what's happening. On that note, the flow of the class was not the best, in my opinion. For example, I would have liked to go over ingredients before jumping in and starting to mix the pre-measured ingredients. It also would have been good to have a little bit of background on why we were using certain ingredients before starting. Again, I'm a by-the-recipe kind of person and a novice baker so if you're alright doing things on the fly, then disregard this point. \n\nBagel feast! At the end of the class, everyone gets to sit in the bakery eating fresh bagels, cream cheese and jam. Since we were from out of town, I was especially grateful for this step because we wouldn't have been able to go home to our own toppings like the other people. At the end of the day, we ended up taking home 3 additional bagels and some sourdough starter. \n\nIt's a shame that the classes aren't offered more frequently/fill up so quickly. We wanted to take the sourdough starter class but it was full until May :(", "author": "Reid K."}

Mr. Piano has since become quite adept at making flatbread and I've made a couple of batches of sourdough pretzels using a modified version of the King Arthur Flour recipe (which uses your starter straight from the fridge, so this is where the \"discard\" for my starter, Bianca, goes when I feed her). I'd tried to keep \"pet yeast\" as a kid with my dad, who enjoys baking bread as a hobby, and it didn't quite make it, but so far my starter (and Mr. Piano's) are both doing well! I'm hoping to be able to pass some of this authentic SF sourdough starter to my dad next time he visits, assuming Bianca survives that long :) The class is really fun and informative, and Cat is really patient and even paused to hold things so the guy with the iPad who was photo documenting just about everything could photograph the various stages of the dough as we went. The notes she gives you cover most of what was covered in class, though, and make an ample refresher to the hands-on experience, so I don't think photo documentation is necessary--stop getting dough all over your phone! :P\n\nI will definitely be interested in taking another class once I get more comfortable with what I can make with my starter, and will absolutely be recommending the class to my friends!

You learn the basics of making bread, get to take home your own starter, plus sample warm Sourdough bread (not yours, theirs) and then eat your own flatbread (complete with toppings of your choice, from lavender to sesame seeds to rosemary).  \n\nClass went at a good clip and is limited to 8 people.

I was so excited about taking the class and so disappointed after the class. I think that Danny is very knowledgeable about different types if bread. The main thing that I had a problem with was the level of cleanliness that were used while making the bread.\n\nAt the beginning of class Danny had everyone put on an apron and go wash their hands. He made no mention of having women pull their hair back or taking off jewelry. Then as class started Danny passed around the starter and told everyone to stick their clean finger in the starter and lick it so they could taste it. After everyone licked their fingers he had us knead the dough that we all shared. There was also someone taking pictures of the process using her cell phone in one hand while she had a coffee in another hand, then she would put her hands right back in the dough! Also during several steps the dough is quite sticky, so people would be scraping the dough off their hands into the dough we were making. At one point I pulled a woman's long black hair out of the dough we were working with. At this point I was so disgusted I couldn't even think about eating the dough. We also saw a mouse running through the kitchen. \n\nAt the end of the class we each get a small piece of the dough from the communal pile and are told to shape this into a flat bread. I was hoping to actually learn to shape a small loaf or something. And since the flat bread was all shaped differently and put in at different times everything cooked at different rates. My dough was put in the back and was thinner than most, so I had a cracker by the end.\n\nConsidering that the bread is made of flour and water I am a little surprised that we each couldn't have made our own small batch of dough. And if he wants to have a community batch of dough there needs to be some changes made to the way the food is handled.\n\nThe class is 2 hours long with approximately 14 students and 1 instructor. I paid $40 by using a deal site, but the full price is $80. I think $40 is on the expensive side for what you get. But I would have been very unhappy had I paid $80 to make a cracker with strangers hair in it.", "author": "Miranda R."}

I try to be kind and give businesses the benefit of the doubt for having a bad day, but this class was totally not worth it.\n\nFirst off, the pet peeve I have with hands-on classes is no handout at the end.  Especially cooking classes, i can't remember all the aspects of it if i am doing hands on tasks. This class did not provide a hand out or recipe for bread, etc. Also, most of the measurements were very vague and as someone who has no experience making bread, i need a bit more structure to be comfortable to try making bread on my own at home.\n\nSecondly, the instructor told everyone to wash their hands prior to starting the class.  That's cool with me, i totally get wanting to start off with a hygienic environment.  However, when the instructor wiped his nose with the back of his hands a few times and coughed into his hand, i thought surely he'd wash up before getting in with the dough.  Nope, he didn't.  I might have been ok with it too if we all had our own dough, but he was mixing dough for the ENTIRE CLASS.  I am not even that big of a germophobe and I was completely put off.\n\nThirdly, although the instructor knew his stuff, it was hard for me to retain what he was saying. It was almost as though he's done it so many times the information is very easy for him, but he was not the best communicator of this information.\n\nFourth, we had a starter that we made--we weren't really told how to maintain it.  So now I just have this thing festering in my house.  I am sad because i think i may have to throw it away. \n\nLast but not least, the oven for the class didn't heat up enough so the bread we were supposed to make and take home wasn't even done!!! He said we can bring it home and bake it some more.  For real? Oh hells no.\n\nThe class also started a bit late because of Carnaval--it would have been nice to give the people coming to the class a heads up that it might be day to take public transit if possible.  But that's the least of my concerns.  \n\nI am bummed about the class because my friend got it for me as a gift and I feel like her money and our time could have been much better spent elsewhere.", "author": "Lu E."}

There were twelve people who attended, including another mother-daughter pair, two younger couples, a pair of friends, and some singles. We gathered round a huge wooden table in the hot bakery, wearing our Sour Flour aprons, and began learning about the ingredients and the components. Within a few minutes of beginning, Danny worked his magic and spread the ingredients all over the table, having us get started working the water into the flour and salt, working the starter into the wet mixture, and getting our hands \"dirty\" with the sticky mess. We had a fabulous time, and it was completely a hands-on experience, with a lot of practice seeing how the dough changed, techniques to handling the dough, comparing the desired outcomes of flatbread (which we made) and loaves (which we sampled). \nI would highly recommend this two-hour workshop for visitors and locals alike.

Unfortunately, I didn't pick up much of that knowledge. The class was very disorganized, jumping from topic to topic. There were no recipes, formulas, or handouts to help make sense of the pieces of info we were given.\n\nI understand baking can be an art, but there is always a base formula that can be used for someone who is just starting out. Once you get the hang of that, you can start to play with it and see what you like. But no formulas were given, no set instructions to make us comfortable enough to want to do this at home. Answers to questions were always \"do whatever feels right\" or \"it depends on a number of factors\", but those factors were never listed or explained on HOW they effect the bread. \n\nIn the end, I left with a starter that I know how to feed, though I'm not really sure how often or how much. I'm also not entirely clear on how to make a new starter, should I need one, or even how I really make bread out of the starter I have.I bake a lot, and have some great books to reference, so I'm sure I'll figure it out. But the point of the class was that I was paying them to teach me how, and they did not.\n\nWhile the class was hands on, which I appreciate, I learned very little in the 2 hours I spent in their kitchen. The class seriously lacks structure. I would not recommend it to anyone who actually wants to make bread at home. There are many other baking classes in the city that will help you do this.", "author": "Kym G."}

I revel in trying all local bakeries and the smell of fresh baked goodies wafting through the air. One of my simplest pleasures is spreading a bit of butter on a well made piece of bread that was obviously made with intention and experienced hands. Sour Flour made all of my wildest bread dreams come true. \n\nI walked into the workshop loving the end result of many a hardworking baker, and I left with a better understanding of how what i mindlessly consume can be made by my own hands. Danny (the guy who teaches the classes) not only has a passion for baking and getting the community involved, but has a good technical understanding of the bread making process. \n\nThe workshops are held on Sundays from 4-6 in the community kitchen of La Victoria Bakery in the mission. It's a two hour class which starts off with piling cups of flour in front of you, and slowly mixing starter dough and water into it with your own two hands. You knead and shape your bagels and then take a little break while they have a chance to rest. It ends with you taking your uncooked bagels (about half a dozen depending on how much flour you started with) home with you. He gives you instructions on how to boil them and then bake them the next morning after they have a chance to \"proof\" (rise).\n\nFor people who are extremely technical and like to follow exact instructions, this class may not be for you. It's laid-back and fun, and you definitely get answers to all your bagel related questions BUT there are no handouts, no exact measurements, no snooty teachers and there's no way you can feel like an out of place bagel making noob. It's more of a get-together with friends of a similar interest of making bagels...hanging out, learning and getting inspired. Oh yeah, don't wear something you don't want to get flour all over. Errr, maybe i'm just messy.\n\nI would highly recommend taking a class or ordering a bag of bagels and giving them to random people you come across on the streets! Share them! Throw them outside your window! Give them to your cubicle neighbor. Eat half of them and then let pigeons eat the rest. Trade all your cookies and donuts and other round shaped pastries for them.

I also grind my own flour at home, and Cat gave me tips and advice on how to address both issues with using my starter.  \n\nI tried to make a starter years ago and failed.  As I suspected, this class was great to learn how the starter should taste, look and feel at various stages of its cycle.  I can't learn that kind of thing from a book, I need to experience it in person.  Cat had us taste a bit of a \"ready to be fed\" starter and a \"ready to make bread\" starter and the difference was really noticeable.  We also got to see how the dough's appearance changes as it hydrates and the gluten chains link up and strengthen.  I really feel so much more confident about baking with a wild yeast starter!\n\nI took my starter home and baked my first bread with it today.

The class size was small (5 people) which made it more fun and interactive.  Danny knows his stuff, the instructions were clear, engaging and to the point.  He pretty much covered all the basics in a few hours and gudied all of us for a hands-on feeding session.  Highly reccomended to anyone who wants to learn more about fermentation and making real bread!", "author": "ebru t."}

Both classes were just as wonderful as the 1st class. These classes provides you with hands on experiences, samples to munch on, my own bagels made in class so I can take home to finish, and a loaf of artisan bread I made in the other class also to take home to finish. My expectations was to grasp and understand the bread making process using the starter I fed loaded with wild yeast. What else can I say other than I'm glad all the classes I've attended so far was attended by a great group of people and of course our fantastic Instructor, Cat. Its been such a positive experience that I want to take the Pizza class next. I recommend these classes for those who want to experience the world of bread making. Please note that these classes are 2 hours each and the time flies by so fast.", "author": "Mailene T."}
