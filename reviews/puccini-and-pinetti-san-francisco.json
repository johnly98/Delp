We also wanted to tour Union Square after, this restaurant was within walking distance. Usually I don't like Italian food, but the lunch menu was so extensive with lots of good choices. \n\nStarted off with a glass of refreshing mimosa, they gave us a pitcher of ice water, it was much needed for rehydration! We ordered burger, warm spinach salad, chicken Marsala, chicken panini and seafood pasta. The table bread and dipping sauce was one of the best, sister and I couldn't even help but to have a few bites despite our gluten allergies. All the dishes were fantastic, everything was delicious with a lot of flavors, lunch prices and portions were fair too. \n\nOur server was friendly and attentive, it was just a bit slow for some reason, but the lunch experience was pleasant enough for us. A good Italian restaurant in Union Square, and it's adjacent to a boutique hotel so maybe we will stay there next time!", "author": "Mimi L."}

Delicious Italian aroma with the sounds of clinking glasses and upscale Italian vibes. We were in heaven! \n\nWe ordered the bruschetta with this delicious goat cheese and arugula, a caesar salad to share and the Capellini with plum tomatoes, garlic, basil, fresh mozzarella - my friend the vegetarian was already in heaven and I just added meat to mine. We split these items and it was so tasty and filling. I loved it! \n\nThe service was awesome. Our server had so many stories about the city and all the amazing things she has seen over the years of living in San Fran. Such an amazing experience, and really tasty Italian food.", "author": "Josi H."}

I wasn't in the mood to search high and low for a restaurant, so I figured this place would do. \n\nThe place was decently busy, especially for a Monday night. I was seated almost immediately, but was a bit disappointed by where I was sitting, as I was sat by the bar area tucked in a corner. This was probably because I was a party of one (yes, I was by my lonesome). \n\nI ordered myself a cocktail (treat yo self), and was given a small basket of bread. The cocktail was pretty delicious and so was the bread. The bread tasted like it was infused with rosemary and olives, which was delish! \n\nFor my main course, I was torn between ordering a steak or a pasta. Although my initial thought was to go for a pasta, especially as I was at an Italian restaurant, I had a change of heart at the last minute and ordered a steak instead. \n\nAlthough not mind blowing, the steak was pretty good. It came with a large portion of fries, and filled me up just right. I definitely had enough food to take home to eat for a later time. \n\nThough maybe not my favorite Italian place, I don't mind it. It has a decent amount of options on the menu, and the food is good. The service is decent as well.", "author": "Margaret P."}

SO and I went for dinner on a weekend around 9pm. This place seems like it might be ok for happy hour drinks and finger food. I would not recommend eating here. Our meal was something that would be served on Nightmare Kitchens. We had a really terrible experience. I found out only after that this is a restaurant associated with a hotel, so take that as you will.\n\n-- Service --\nOur waiter was really rude from the beginning. I know every one has a shitty day, but his attitude was more than that. The restaurant was basically empty and service was terrible. Our waiter was usually no where to be found. It took a *really* long time to get our plates cleared and to get the check. \n\n-- Drinks --\nSO ordered whiskey on the rocks, which tasted watered down.\n\n-- Food --\nWe started with olives, which weren't great, but weren't that bad. The serving of olives was quite large though compared to other Italian restaurants so that was nice. SO had calamari and enjoyed it. We were brought what looked like focaccia and a questionable and oily sauce.\n\nLooking now, entrees on the Yelp menu have half-size prices available, but on the restaurant menu, these were not available. Full size portions are really large. I had the Capellini which is described as \"Plum tomatoes, garlic, basil, marinated fresh mozzarella.\" SO had the Linguini and Clams which is described as \"Littleneck clams, Calabrian chili butter, garlic, tomato, white wine, parsley, crostini.\" \n\nI've had meals where the food wasn't really great, but never inedible. The Capellini was inedible. It's a really simple and classic pasta dish, so it's quite sad. It did not come with plum tomatoes. Instead it came with sun-dried tomatoes? maybe fried tomatoes? I honestly don't know what they were but they were really gross and definitely were not fresh. They came in this oil sauce which covered the pasta so I couldn't even eat the noodles. The mozzarella was covered in oil and not soft. It took effort to cut through it. SO had a similar experience with the Linguini and Clams. The linguini was overcooked, covered in oil, and under seasoned. The clams were bland but not terrible.\n\n-- Price -- \nSO EXPENSIVE. I enjoy eating out, and this is not worth the money. Capellini alone was $22, which is expensive even for SF. Total we paid $120. Maybe it's because of the Union Square location and owned by the hotel.", "author": "Cristina E."}

Unfortunately, they decided to screw with my leftovers. \n\nTabletop focaccia with sundried tomato and capers tapenade = delicious. \n\nCaprese salad = heirloom tomatoes, burrata (need I say more) and basil.  Tangy, sweet and refreshing. $16.00.\n\nSpaghetti with meatballs = moist, flavorful meatballs with al dente pasta.  Hearty portion.  He enjoyed this. $26.00.\n\nChicken Marsala = thin pounded chicken breasts with thinly sliced mushrooms over a bed of spinach and mashed potatoes. Heavenly moat surrounded by a delicious wine sauce. Slightly sweet, tangy, and full of flavor.  So many layers.  I truly loved this dish. Hearty portion. $27.00. SEE NOTE BELOW.\n\nSweet corn polenta side = good.  He enjoyed it a lot more than I did.  It's a bit coarse with corn kernels throughout and definitely cheese/cream flavor. $7.00.\n\nGelato trio = vanilla bean, chocolate fudge brownie & butter pecan (flavors vary) were all very good. I preferred the vanilla bean and he loved the butter pecan. However, the gelato was a bit icy--I literally was eating pieces of ice with some bites.  $6.00.\n\nService = good. They were a bit pushy about drinks...we stuck with ice water. And my water glass was empty for a while before someone finally refilled it. \n\nPrices = moderate to expensive. Dinner for two came out to $92.53.  However, we had an $80-dinner-for-2 Living Social voucher to use.  So we paid $12.53 in taxes and SF mandate fees.  \n\nSeating = plentiful.  \n\nNote: I am LIVID that they packed the leftover chicken marsala and did NOT include the sauce. What the hell is the point of having this dish without the marsala sauce?!! The dish was $27.00 and they kept the sauce for some reason?  UNBELIEVABLE.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-01-30", "description": "Overpriced, mediocre food, bad service, limited/boring menu.\n\nWe went in on Saturday night and there was absolutely no wait - oh, well, except for the wait for the hostess to come back up to the the front from whatever she was doing for 5-10 minutes while we stood ignored by all of the servers who passed by. \n\nPuccini has a large wine list, but they are unwelcoming of giving tastes.  I ended up ordering a Rose that I didn't like very much, just because I felt uninvited to have a second taste after I didn't like the first wine I tasted. Our server knew absolutely nothing about the wine list - so huge list, no offers of tastes and servers with no ability to recommend wines makes for an unsuccessful wine program. \n\nWhat's more, our server (Amy B.) was so awkward.  First, she carded my girlfriend, who is over 2 years older than I, but didn't card me.  When you are serving a table with only two people and they are obviously similar in age - you don't card one person and not the other.  My friend exclaimed, \"she's YOUNGER than I am!\" because she was insulted for me, so the server awkwardly was like \"alright, gotta see yours too that's just the way it is\" or something weird like that. I almost objected to being further insulted by her pretending to scrutinize my ID, but handed it over with discomfort written all over my face.  Yes, my friend does present as really young because she is tiny and shy.  But I'm in my 20's and get carded ALL the time.  I was recently carded to enter an 18-and-over establishment. This was just rude and thoughtless: Server 101. \n\nOther tables were being brought table bread, but our server didn't bring it to us.  I'm not convinced that she didn't like us, rather, she was preoccupied with standing at the computer in the middle of the restaurant texting on her phone and talking to her co-workers the entire night. \n\nNothing on the menu sounded good to me.  The decor, service and ambiance were unrefined, so why do they have $9 olives on their menu?  My friend ordered a pizza listed on starters section, so I followed suit because literally nothing sounded good. The only item that was slightly appealing was a mushroom risotto, but I'm glad I didn't get it because knowing what I know now, it wouldn't have been good and certainly not worth the almost-$30 price tag. \n\nThe Margarita pizza ($15) was floppy and soggy and had literally 3 shreds of basil and barely any cheese.  The liquid from the skimpy-even-for-a-margarita-pizza amount of cheese mixed into the tomato sauce and made it a soggy flaccid round of dough with a pool of milky tomato sauce.  No dice. \n\nThe Persimmon pizza ($18) was just OK.  It had too many sweet components (caramelized onions, balsamic and persimmons) and WAY too many persimmons on it  The pancetta was the perfect salty reprieve, but there were only about 5 tiny chunks of it on the whole pizza.  We asked for to-go boxes for the leftovers (she had half left and I had three-fourths left) so they brought us two extra-large size pizza boxes.  I asked if they had smaller to-go boxes and they said they didn't.  So we consolidated our leftovers in one box, but then we had to take turns carrying around the huge box.   \n\nOur 2 water glasses and 2 wine glasses were empty and our food untouched for over 30 minutes so I kept turning around to look for our server and she was still standing at the computer, chatting away. I finally had to get up and approach her to ask for boxes and the check.  We put down two credit cards and she brought them back with one pen. It's just these little things that make you think: \"have you EVER dined out before?\" Why make us take turns using the pen?  \n\nI left a 10% tip which I would never do, but she honestly deserved way less in my opinion. Not because of the pen, the ID debacle, the lack of wine knowledge, never coming to check on us, and my having to go fetch our check - but because of ALL of those things combined with zero redeeming factors.", "author": "Emma H."}

After looking at what was nearby on yelp, we picked Puccini and Pinetti.  It had a decent amount of stars and Italian sounded lovely.  \n\nSF has been full of customers and diners recently due to the Giants games, so we were hoping that it wasn't booked up.  Though it looked busy, we were able to get a table near the window.  This restaurant is very bright and has nice paintings on the wall.  From the pictures, it looked higher end with their plates and drinks, however it has more of a fancier-version-of-Olive-Garden feel.  Not to put that down, I still had a nice time, but don't expect something out of haute cuisine magazine (is that a real thing?).\n\nThe bread was fantastic! It was a focaccia-like bread that was super soft.  The dip was also full of flavor -- it tasted like sun dried tomatoes, olive oil, olives, garlic and other misc herbs.  I really enjoyed the bread. \n\nThe prices are a little high, so we decided to split the Chicken Marsala dish and ordered two beers.  I had the Amber and it was pretty good.  Nothing to blow me away, but I really enjoyed that beer after a long day of work.  This place also seemed more of a cocktail and wine kind of restaurant anyways.  The waiters were very nice and the wait for the food was neither too long, nor too short.\n\nSplitting one dish does not give you much.  I had also hit the gym after work and could have used some more grub.   The chicken was relatively thin over a decent portion of mashed potatoes and spinach with mushrooms spread on top.  The sauce was savory, but it had a strong sweet flavor.  The chicken was a little dry to be honest, but I really enjoyed the mushrooms and potatoes.  Seeing that these items weren't the star of the dish, I would give it a 2/5.  I think I enjoyed the bread more.\n\nIn the end, we had an ok time.  Though it was a bit disappointing, it was nice to grab dinner in the city.  The area is also not great.  I do understand that SF has some not so nice areas, but this restaurant was located in a more rowdy sort of neighborhood (at least from what I know of - and I've lived in DTLA and Oakland.. just sayin'). At nighttime we felt a little uneasy walking to the car.  \n\nI probably wouldn't recommend to a friend or return. The food is bit overpriced for the quality.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-01", "description": "Located in the heart of Union Square, Puccini and Pinetti is unsurprisingly located within a hotel.  Due to this location, this establishment caters to out of town guests.  \n\nWhen we (local SF city dwellers) visited it was pretty apparent that the restaurant was filled with business travelers and families visiting out of town.  Now, of course there is no problem whatsoever with that, it's just a fact that should be stated to depict the \"vibe\".  The dining and bar area isn't decorated in artsy or trendy decor like most SF restaurants, in fact, I made a statement while sitting down that it reminding me of \"a very upscale Midwestern Chili's\".  \n\nThe wine menu was more than sufficient and the dining menu is sweet and succinct, offering appetizers, pastas, and main dishes.  We ordered a little gem salad, truffle fries, and chicken marsala.  Our food came out very quick-- not once did we feel as though we were waiting.  The salad was very fresh and tasted like a warm summer day.  The fries were excellent and also contained a fair amount of garlic-- I appreciated that!  Also, we were impressed with the very generous portion here.  Our main dish was good, but nothing too notable.  \n\nOverall, Puccini & Pinetti got the job done.  If I were a guest at a nearby hotel, or in need of a family-friendly dining experience, I would certainly visit again.

The concierge from our hotel across the street suggested this place because it was close. We gave it a shot. \n\nUpon walking in, we were informed they had a special holiday menu and that they were doing something \"special for Thanksgiving.\" As we were hungry, we said that was fine. \n\nRather than seeing any items having to do with Thanksgiving, i.e. turkey, stuffing, cranberries or ham (as it was Thanksgiving Day), the menu was a limited version of their regular menu, EXCEPT the prices were COMPLETELY hiked up!!! I guess that's what they meant by \"special!\" \n\nOur waiter suggested the spaghetti and meatballs ($35 on this day) and the chicken marsala (also $35). As we were hungry and had not checked Yelp, we went with our waiter's recommendations and the waiter further sold the spaghetti and meatballs by informing us that it was the \"family's secret recipe since the restaurant first opened several decades ago\". I thought: \"Wow! How could anyone go wrong with that?!?!\" \n\nIt all went wrong. The spaghetti and meatballs were bland and tasted like hospital food. For $35 and a promise of an old secret family recipe, I expected something special. Nope! It was just a very dry spaghetti and 3 meatballs (with no tomato sauce, garlic or anything one would expect from a \"secret family recipe.\" In hindsight, it was an absolutely absurd statement!!!\n\nThe chicken marsala was tastier than the spaghetti, but DEFINITELY not worth $35. In fact, it's not even worth $25. Maybe at $15 it would be worth a shot for what you get, which is just two very very thinly pounded chicken breasts over mash potatoes and drenched in a super sweet brown sauce. Again, nothing \"special\" about it except for the price that day! Haha. I almost have to laugh to keep my wits... \n\nMy daughter got a cheese pizza from the kids menu for $8. Again, nothing special. \n\nThe overall meal with the two dishes and my daughter's pizza, tax, tip and the \"SF Mandate\" tax came out to over a $100. \n\nIn all honesty, this meal was worth $50 AT BEST.

The restaurant was pretty empty upon arrival, so we were seated right away. Our waiter was nice, but a bit too soft-spoken and didn't carry much presence whenever he was around. However, the staff that we encountered were pretty nice in general.\nThe brunch menu here is very limited and the food is over priced to be extremely honest with you. For 3 people, our bill was nearly $80 (prior to them taking the $10 off because of the coupon). The portion sizes are basically a joke here, especially for the amount of money you're paying for. I ordered the $14 Belgian waffle breakfast, thinking I'd have at least two large waffles with the toppings from the description; however, I only got 1 waffle with a sliced banana, toasted walnuts, and butter on top. What a total rip off! The food was decent, but it wasn't delicious, which made me feel like I wasted my time and money at this restaurant.\nThe food here met the basic need to be satiated, but I would only dine here again if this place were my last resort.

I had walked by this restaurant before on the way to Kin Khao and thought it looked enticing. I like the atmosphere. The lights are really bright, maybe too bright. The menu is Italian, but also just expensive overpriced American dishes like salmon and pork chop. It reminded me of Nopa, but a more interesting Italian menu. There's also a food menu for the bar with crab cakes and pizza. We got the bruschetta. \n\nI got the frutti di mare and my friend got the chicken marsala for like the third time. The bruschetta was different. The tomatoes were roasted and had long slices instead of cubes. It came with 2 scoops of goat cheese and 8 toasted bread slices. We had to order more bread slices for a $1 because we had extra tomato and cheese. I liked the frutti di mare, which was a seafood dish with a light serving of pasta. The seafood included fish, clams, shrimp, and mussels. It wasn't the best dish I've ever had, but nice. My friend loves the chicken marsala there and hasn't had any other dish at this restaurant the three times he has been. The chicken marsala reminded me of Cheesecake Factory. \n\nI also got a lemonade, which came in a jar. There were free refills. We were at the bar waiting and my friend ordered us \"bitters and soda\" which didn't taste good to me because it wasn't sweet. I had never had that drink. Oh and we had a problem when we got there. A hostess told us that we would have a 5 minute wait and that she would come and find us at the bar. We went back after 5 minutes and the host/ess said that they didn't remember and that our name wasn't on the list...and also that we would have to wait 10-15 minutes. That SUCKS!\n\nWould I come back here? I might come back here to try something else on the menu, but I am not dying to. Our total came to $90 for two including tip.", "author": "Denise C."}

Our waiter, Angel, welcomed us and mentioned the specials of the day. Our order:\n\nHouse Focaccia Bread: First, the tapenade of sun dried tomatoes, olive oil and herbs was delicious. Too bad the bread was not soft and was on the stale side\n\nMinestrone Soup with seasonal vegetables and ditalini pasta. The soup was on the thin side and it needed more seasoning. At $9, this was pricey. \n\nCaesar Salad:  Romaine was fresh with a tasty Caesar dressing.  Like the fresh shavings of Parmesan cheese.\n\nChicken Marsala:  Two thin slices of chicken breast with mushrooms on top of mashed potatoes and some spinach. The sauce was tasty that had a sweet flavor, probably from the marsala wine. Since the chicken was thin, thought it might be dry, but it was not. For $26, this was on the expensive side. \n\nSaffron Risotto with rock shrimp, frisee with cherry tomatoes and agrumato topped with freshly grated Parmesan.  Had a taste of the risotto and it was tasty. \n\nProfiteroles and Pistachio Gelato topped with dark chocolate fudge and whipped cream and nuts.

A large Italian restaurant, near Union Square, could easily be a tourist trap. However; we did not have all that many options when we finally decided there to go and how wrong can one go with Italian?\n\nIt started out quite ok, we had a drink at the bar, whlist waiting for our table. A vibrant setting is great for a Saturday night, although being just three people, we were struggling to hear each other properly.\n\nAt the table we all started having a carpaccio, which we all found tasty and delicious. The waiter was nice and helped choosing a bottle of wine to go with our orders. The service was efficient. However; we discussed around the table how we just never get used to the fact that the waiters start clearing the table plate by plate before everyone is done with their dishes. \n\nFor main I had the frutti di mare pasta. It looked good and based on the ingredients, it should have a lot of flavours. It didn't. And concidering the prices, it was straight out disappointing in its overcookedness. A way to big chocolate cake for the dessert did not lift the impression. \n\nNot recommended if your after food experiences.", "author": "Hildegunn N."}

Calamari tasted great. I ordered Spaghetti with Bolognese as I am such a big fan of that sauce from my first time tasting it in Italy. It didn't fail. I ordered the half order and still too much. It was as how I expected it with lots of flavor. My wife got the linguine with clams. She loved it and finished the entire half order! \n\nLesson learned by me and to you, my fellow Yelpers, give a place a try despite of bad reviews. You can't please everyone and SF is such a competitive place for any type of business but more so for restaurants. \n\nRate the service but most importantly rate the food! Don't expect to be pampered just because you're paying a lot of money. Everything is relevant. When you come to SF, expect everything to be expensive as SF itself is imposing so much fees from businesses.

I thought you were the land of good food?  =/\n\nI was on crutches, and the bf and I wanted to make this our last stop for SF food before we had to get on our plane.  It was almost lunch time on a Thursday, but the hostess was able to seat us with no problem.  Once we sat down, our waitress came by, introduced herself.  While we were still deciding, glasses of water and a basket of bread with butter appeared.  Quietly munched on our bread, while waiting for the waitress to come back.  Bf ordered the chicken marsala, while I had the lunch-sized linguine and clams.\n\nWaited probably around 15 minutes for the food to arrive, which wasn't a problem.  It was a little weird that tables that were seated way after us was able to get their food first, but I wasn't sure what they got.  Bf's chicken marsala was around $25 and was as big as my lunch-size portion of linguine and clams, which was not very big.  We were actually still hungry after the meal.  =/  \n\nTaste-wise, the bread was soft, and not bad.  The capers in the marinara sauce for the bread was a bit of a red flag for me.  I mean, I think capers are great and all, but it feels that the restaurant is cheating or being lazy by putting that in their marinara sauce.  Are they trying to hide flavors in the sauce?  For my linguine and clams, it also came with capers, which wasn't bad, but I felt that other spices probably would've made it so much better.  For the bf's chicken marsala, it was edible, but I felt that he could make a better meal.\n\nWhen considering the high prices of the meal, the bf and I probably won't come back.  I understand that it's downtown SF and the place needs to compete with other restaurants in the area, but it wasn't that great or worth it.  Will try and just do Little Italy for Italian food next time.\n\nService wasn't bad, but there weren't too many people when we sat down.

Happy hour is one of my favorite activities and let's just say Puccini & Pinetti does not disappoint! I love that their happy hours are 7 days a week, which includes $3 beer and champagne. Ummmm, yes please! Their crab cakes are also amazing and something I highly recommend. I also love how they are located near major stores so it's the perfect spot for a shopping break or just a place to meet/catch up with friends. \n\nTheir bruschetta is good, and comes with spreadable goat cheese and tomato paste (instead of the usual diced tomatoes, etc.) and their calamari makes a great snack as well. You will receive a generous amount of wine, beer, or any other beverage of your likings which is something I really appreciate. I've been here on Tuesdays, Sundays, Thursdays, pretty much at different times and seasons and this place is always packed. I can't say I have anything negative to say about this place, but one thing they could work on might be improving their health score rating-- I think right now it's in the 80-something range, which I was told was considered uncommon for restaurants.

Good rating, gluten-free, \"good for kids,\" and a block from our hotel. \n\nUpon arriving at 6:45 on a Wednesday, we were given a table for 2 adults and 2 kids, but told that our server might be running a bit behind.  Our host gave us one coloring sheet and said he'd bring another once it was done printing.  Keep in mind, we walked right in and sat down, so while it was busy, it was not packed.  Not once did I see people waiting in the doorway for a table.\n\nSome 15 minutes later, we were finally able to get some attention from our waitress, to ask about the other coloring sheet and ask for a gluten-free menu.  5 more minutes to get these two and we were then asked for drink orders.  My wife couldn't decide which GF option to try first, and said we might have to come back to try more.  I got an e-mail at 7:12 and that was when the waitress came back to take our food order.  Grilled salmon, a gluten-free burger, kid's grilled cheese, kid's cheese pizza.  \n\nI took a sip of my son's lemonade, it tasted funny.  There was something fizzy mixed in, and it had a bit of an alcoholic taste to me.  My wife took a sip and and agreed that it tasted a bit like champagne.  Now, to be honest, I'm not positive that it was champagne or anything more than some kind of spritzer, but there was definitely more than lemonade in there.  We set it aside, no rush, because we try to avoid letting the kids drink anything but water before the meal anyway, so they don't fill up.  Somewhere in the next 30 minutes, our waitress replaced it.\n\nAt 7:55, our waitress stopped by to tell us the kitchen got backed up but our food was coming.  She said they had a bunch of \"pork chops\" come through and it slowed things down.  Our food arrived at our table at 8:04.  52 minutes after we ordered it.\n\nNow I can understand the gluten-free burger or salmon could maybe get backed up. But you mean to tell me they can't cook a f*cking pizza in the wood oven and slap a f*cking grilled cheese on the grill for a minute so the kids can eat in under an hour of walking in the f*cking door and being seated immediately?  Seriously?\n\nThe manager stopped by to ask how it was.  I told him that we just waited 52 minutes to get our food, and with hungry tired kids that is not a pleasant experience.  \"I'll check on it,\" he said.  I saw him strolling around the bar, but after a few minutes he was back to standing near the entrance to welcome guests.\n\nMeanwhile, one of my kids fell asleep in the f*cking chair (I'll attach a pic to this review if I can).  I foolishly threw down the $45 we had between us so I could carry my sleeping kid back to the hotel.  He went to bed hungry, but too tired to eat.  Thanks, a$$ hole.

However, I asked for rare and they hit it on the nose. My steak was served with potatoes which were cooked PERFECTLY (nice crispy skin and soft inside) and a side of broccoli which was also cooked well. \n\nMy favorite part of the whole meal though was the bruschetta. It was served with warm tomato marinara-esque sauce and goat cheese, and the bread was drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette. YUM. I would go here again, but preferably on someone else's dime.", "author": "Christopher S."}

It's located on a busy corner of downtown. The interior has a hip look too it. Luckily I had made reservations and avoided the long wait, otherwise I would have passed out.\n\nThe host quickly seated us at a booth. The ambiance of the joint is quite alive. The waitress handed me a wine menu. Odd, no food first, got it drink first then eat.\n\nThey had a good variety of wines available, started off with resiling. Then ordered a spinach salad, the taste was savory. Enjoyed the sauce used mixed in with the greens.\n\nAs for the entree, it was a pasta dish that reminded me allot of lasagna. Yet it had a little spice that gave it a different taste. The flavor was good. \n\nFinally dessert, you can never go wrong with creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. They added a bit of citrus, different but digged it. Why the mediocre rating, well as much as I love Italian food, the food was alright. Maybe it was the notion of spending over $100 per couple.

It met my expectation! I had the citrus olive appetizer and there were plenty of tasty olives of all varieties! The capellini  \n Papodora  with basil was excellent, there was enough to take home for dinner. The Cesar's salad had just enough dressing and it wasn't to overwhelming. The spread for the bread was excellent with tomatoes and capers and the tiramisu was light and perfect. The coffee was a bit weak but I like my coffee strong. Last but not least, Angel, the server, was the best!  Very professional; he waited with perfect timing to serve my different dishes and thought of everything. He asked me what I needed often, but not to often and immediately brought whatever I asked for! Excellent! The other server/bus person was helpful also!

When we got to the restaurant\n  we were 30 mins before our reservation time the lady who seated us informed us that is was no problem to be seated early we asked for a booth which was available across from where we were sitting and she informed us it was reserved for a party of 4. We sat by a wall at a very small uncomfortable table with no view of anything. 2 minutes later a couple was seated at the exact table I had requested hmm I wonder why they got the table. Whatever though. We were brought waters that were shoved onto our tiny table with no straws. I requested a straw my parter didn't mind not having one. I thought this was a simple requested 20 mins pass no straw she checked every other table but ours I finally had to ask a second time as though we had been forgotten about.

A friend and I were just looking for some place to have a drink and chat and this place had some open seats at the bar. Nice atmosphere, service was great. The guys at the bar were very nice, and very fast. Drinks were good, and like I said, fast. \n\nI was really impressed how fast the food came out. I ordered a small Caesar salad and got it within 5 minutes and then ordered a pasta dish later and got it within 10 minutes. Both tasted really good with good flavor and nice presentation. The pasta had fresh thick slices of fresh mozzarella on top, it was really tasty and I haven't seen it like that before. \n\nThe thing that most impressed me about this restaurant and made me want to write a review was their closing procedures. Like I said, we were sitting at the bar and the amount of cleaning they do at the end of the night is unlike what I've seen before. They cleaned everything, from every rubber drink mat to each tap, to covering every liquor bottle, everything was cleaned and then wiped down, and everything was sealed for the next day. They were cleaning for a very long time and were extremely thorough. I even asked them if this was a Sunday cleaning to start the next week and they said no they go through this every night. \n\nWhen you watch shows like Bar Rescue or anything like that on Food Network, you assume anyone cleaning twice a week would suffice compared to how bad some of these other places are, but the amount of effort the staff puts into cleaning every night made me feel great and very confident about returning and about recommending it to others.

Please pay attention to the order you're taking. The food, overall was very good. The bacon COULD have been cooked just a touch more, but it was very tasty, Applewood smoked is my guess.

My friend who booked the reservation made sure they offer some gluten free options, but who would have thought it was an entire menu of options.  I know this doesn't sound like a big deal to all the gluten eaters out there, but let me tell you that when I can order several options from one place it feels like I am the Queen of England.  Seriously, crazy as it sounds.\n\nMy friend and I opted to split the seasonal green salad with sliced apples, spring mix, ricotta salata, shaved radish and a champagne vinaigrette.  It was lovely that the restaurant split the salad before bringing it to the table.  It is a small effort but one I appreciate so much when restaurants pay attention to details like that.\n\nThe specials here that are the tried and true's and what they are famous for is the spaghetti and meatballs, chicken marsala, fruitti di mare (seafood medley pasta).  I was on the fence to try the seafood medley with a saffron broth, but I instead opted for one of my favorite dishes - the classic pork chop.  It was served with roasted brussel sprouts and butternut squash, and creamy corn polenta with a mustard vinaigrette.  Overall my chop was cooked beautifully medium, but it was lacking sauce.  While the chop was juicy the dish felt dry next to the polenta and veggies.  Personally I am a pork chops and apple sauce kinda gal, so I'm used to a sauce to accompany my chop.  \n\nThe girls I was dining with ordered the chicken marsala, meatballs, and short ribs.  Everyone ate their dishes with no complaints and happy bellies at the end.  We closed our meal with the cr\u00e8me brulee.  It was huge and plenty for the four of us to share and not be left wanting more.  \n\nThe restaurant is just off the main drag of Union Square, but still in perfect walking distance to the excitement of everything.

We needed to eat so badly so we passed the HH and were seated in the dining room. Boy we were wrong.\n\n*The Working Lunch set ($18) allows you a choice of soup or salad, a main course and a dessert. Nothing was really bad nor was it impressive. Minestrone soup was lukewarm. Chicken Marsala is okay, the sauce is a bit too sweet.  The best part of the meal was the tiramisu. Two of us got this set and we both agreed that portion is small. That piece of chicken is like a deli slice.\n\n*Asparagus Salad with Shrimps ($19): Crispy asparagus with five sauteed prawns. My partner was underwhelmed by this skimpy portion. He thought it's a bowl of salad with mixed greens topped with asparagus and shrimps. It's small even for an appetizer.\n\nOverall I am not impressed. Food is just not amazing for what you pay. I settle for mediocre food if it's diner price.

Fruitti di Mare or linguini with clams. I gave the choice to the bartender and he did not hesitate to punch in the fruitti di Mare. It did not disappoint. Nicely flavored and sufficiently messy enough to splatter my shirt and give me something to clean when I get home. \n\nAll in all, one of the best experiences for dinner I have had in the couple of weeks I have been in San Francisco.", "author": "Christopher S."}

To be honest, I could have made a meal of just that focaccia and relishHearty!\nThe service was OUTSTANDING. Have to say, one cannot go wrong with an authentic Italian restaurant.

The seafood was cooked well and the shrimp sizes were generous but the dish was just so bland.\n\nBistecca ($32) - New York strip steak. This was ok. My cousin commented that the steak wasn't cooked as he would like and the meat was fatty. But really, for the price point, this dish was just so simplistic. No intricate flavors.

It's always been packed, and we hadn't made a reservation.  This time we made a reservation for 6 @ 7:30.  They take your name and cell number.  Due to the uncertain nature of trolley car waits, as luck would have it we were stuck at Hyde and Beach for well over an hour, missing our reservation time.  Not only did they call, they kept bumping our time, calling twice to follow up.  (The last time we were on the trolley).  \n\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant it was quite busy, with people waiting.  Imagine my surprise when we were promptly seated, at our table that they had been saving for over 30 minutes on a busy Saturday!  That's service.\n\nThe food is outstanding.  We ordered the bruschetta, and margarita pizza as an appetizer.  Both were excellent, the pie was hot, thin and delicious.    Strongly recommend.\n\nFor dinner we had the Chicken Marsala, Scallops, and Spaghetti and  Meatballs.  The last seems rather simple, but don't be fooled.  It was incredible, as well as the others.\n\nWe didn't think we had room for desert until they brought the menu back out...we did.  I had the Cheesecake w/peach, we also ordered the cr\u00e8me brule, and the chocolate panache.  \n\nAll in all the food was outstanding.  In a city filled with awesome restaurants, I would certainly dine there again.", "author": "Collin M."}

Manager/owner (?) made her rounds throughout the restaurant to greet diners which I appreciated. However I can't ignore the fact that their risotto wasn't just al dente, it was waaaaay undercooked! It wasn't soft like it's supposed to be, it was actually quite rough. However I'll admit their broth was decent. The hubs didn't mind his short ribs but at $26 at this restaurant he expected slightly better. \n\nWell, I gave it a shot after passing by a bazillion times. I never felt the desire to try however we were in the area one evening after Christmas shopping and it started pouring out. We were hungry but knowing the area is lacking of great eateries and restaurants we weren't expecting much for dinner and pretty much chose P&P purely out of convenience.\n\nThis restaurant is fine as a standard \"tourist restaurant\" where the majority of the patrons probably still refer to the servers as \"waitresses\" and \"waiters\" in this day and age. With hiked up prices to reflect the Union Square locale for mediocre (in my case undercooked) Americanized Italian fare I think I can safely say I won't be returning.

We should have walked out but ....\n\nWe were already here and we were hungry so we decided to stay and eat. The menu was decent if unimaginative. The kind of food that Oliver Platt's food critic character in the movie, Chef, criticized Jon Favreau's chef character for cooking, technically OK but with no soul.\n\nWe experienced drive-by service. It seemed like our server only stopped by our table on the way to another. Only the busboy exhibited some vestige of personality. I don't expect obsequious service but I also don't want to feel like part of a faceless crowd. \n\nDrinks:\nAce Pear Cider: similar to a wine cooler.\n\nFreebies:\nFoccacia bread with red bell pepper and caper tapenade: bread was soft but cold. The strange thing was that our bread was cleared along with our appetizers. We didn't say anything since we thought we were getting more bread with our entrees. \n\nAppetizers:\nFrito Misto: calamari and rock shrimp battered and fried was OK but nothing to write home about.\n\nWhite Pizza: pancetta, feta, arugula, parmesan cheese. Dough was yeasty and pancetta was chewy rather than crispy.\n\nGrilled Asparagus Salad: asparagus, proscuitto, balsamic vinegar reduction. OK but I don't know how they got food that sounds like it should pack a flavor punch taste so bland.\n\nEntrees:\nGrilled Salmon: salmon, asparagus, wild rice, aioli. I've enjoyed wild rice in a pilaf, a soup, a pancake, etc. but can you honestly tell me of anyone who enjoys eating plain wild rice with no seasonings, mire poix or anything else added to it? \n\nVeal Piccata with plain mashed potatoes, capers and shaved asparagus: I will say the server allowed my friend to substitute her sides since she was allergic to some of the ingredients. Veal was very tender, if a bit too lemony.\n\nDessert:\nValrhona Truffle Cake warm chocolate truffle center, topped with vanilla gelato: I don't care what Oliver Platt's character said about molten lava cakes. They're delicious if done right. There was certainly enough gooey chocolate in this cake. Yummy.\n\nCr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e with Tahitian vanilla bean: dialed in\n\nCherry Cheesecake: also dialed in\n\nFive star prices for two and a half star hotel food.

The omelette was not an omelette in the formal sense - it was more like lightly scrambled eggs with veggies. The toast was rather delicious, perhaps due to the sweet, soft butter, and the potatoes were well fried & crisp, though not oily whatsoever. Served with peppers and onions, they actually were quite scrumptious. Generous juice portions, as the orange was delicious and fresh squeezed. Otherwise, their bagel and eggs benedict were pedestrian, but to provide room service to clients that aren't even directly yours is a big boon for both the restaurant and the hotel. Good for them.

I couldnt have been more pleased with my experience that evening. Fast service, amazing food, well poured wine...heaven perhaps?\n\nI would give this place 4.5 if i could. The only reason its not a 5 is because parking is not that easy.

We were looking for a quick dinner before a show, and Italian sounded good, so we decided to give it a try. It definitely caters to out of towners, and I wouldn't be surprised if we were the only locals in there that night. We ordered the bruschetta to start, which was good but nothing special. We also shared a caprese salad which was mediocre. We then shared the saffron shrimp risotto. I was actually impressed by how they were able to create a risotto with so little flavor. Usually when you put shrimp, rice, and saffron together good things happen. But this risotto was so bland that if my mouth wasn't moving I wouldn't have known there was food in there. It was also about $30, which is outrageous for the amount of food we received. I definitely won't be back.", "author": "Diana G."}

Our actual time in the restaurant was not bad, but that part that followed was not so good.  We had a group of 7 people on a Tuesday night in early September.   We had some appetizers, some meals, and some beers.  Normal night, nothing special.  However 4 of the 7 people had scallops.  I puked my guts out, and two of the other scallop eaters spent the night on the toilet.  Net, the three of us were really sick for about 24 hours.  Coincidence? You be the judge.  We had one thing in common ... the scallops. We didn't drink a lot.  As you look at other reviews, you'll see I'm not the only one that has had this experience.  \n\nBTW, this is not necessarily a nice, quiet restaurant.  It is very alive, loud and not a great place for conversation.  There are lots of good restaurants like that.

This was walking distance with Parking across the street so I thought it would be a good place for a family dinner.  I read the mixed bag of reviews on Yelp and thought it was still our best bet.  We had seven people and they set up a nice table towards the back near a street window.  We had some wine and a cocktail.  The waiter was on us and made sure we all had drinks when we came in (not all got there at the same time).  He was very attentive as were the support staff.  I had read how poor the service was, but I didn't see any of this on our visit.  Our table ordered a myriad of dishes and salads, soup.  I think everyone seemed pleased with their meal, and my son go a special dish (plain pasta with chicken) which thy had no problem doing for him.  I had the Chicken Marsala.  And as noted in other reviews the chicken was dry and the plate was $25 dollars.  It was served with mashed potatoes and vegetables.  My cup of minestrone was very good to start, but the meal was a bit off.  The chicken is cut very thin (makes for fast prep, but can be over cooked as seems to be their issue here) and served with a dark marsala sauce.  Although I did enjoy the sauce, it was very heavy and maybe a bit overburdened making overly rich than I prefer.  Plates were picked up promptly, almost overly eager at times (so don't stop and chat with a \u00be quarter completed plate in front of you), but they tended to the table well which I like.  The restroom is in the adjoining hotel next door.  You meander through a long hall until you enter the small lobby that had well maintained, clean, and rather posh restroom.  Changing tables available for those that need them (in both his and hers).  \nThe prices are high.  The glasses of wine were $12 and up a glass and plates around $25 to $30.  But, you are in San Francisco, and near Union Square where everything is expensive.  Not to mention the generous tip they add on, and SF Mandate fees to pay for whatever dole that that's for.  Anyway, the net net is a good location, nice vibe, close parking, good for informal family dining, adequate food.  The negatives, were cost, and value for the dollar, noisey.", "author": "Jim M."}

Though the vibe here is relaxed and casual, there were tons of people dressed up, as well.\n\nOur server, Kirk, was extremely friendly and attentive.  He offered suggestions for his favorite dishes and even helped us when we were going back and forth between options.  What I also liked was that I didn't have to flag someone down once to clear our table or refill our drinks--the servers were on it. \n\nWe couldn't decide on our appetizer so we ended up ordering half portions of carpaccio and mussels.  I have to admit, I loved these 2 dishes more than my entree!  This was my first time having carpaccio; so for those of you who do not know what it is, it's basically thin and raw beef, mixed with parmesan cheese and arugula...Mmmm!!  I was really craving salami and they didn't have that on the menu...this was a great alternative!!  As for the mussels...they were the best tasting mussels I have ever tried in my life--plump and juicy goodness!!  \n\nMy entree was a half portion of spaghetti and meatballs.  The noodles were a little too al dente for my liking.  The sauce, however, was light, flavor and tasty.  My boyfriend had the prime rib cooked medium rare.  He said it was good but some parts of it were cooked more medium than rare.  \n\nOverall, I'd definitely come back...perhaps, to try out the happy hour that many of the previous Yelpers rave about!", "author": "Lisa Marie R."}

Surprising considering the other comments about slow service. \n\nPeople in my group had the Chicken Marsala, the short ribs, Fruti di Mare; I ordered the Grilled Salmon and a house salad. Though my salmon had great flavor, it was a little overly salted for my taste. The salad, also had great flavor, but just a touch too much dressing (I like very light dressing) The rest of the group devoured their food and gave it a thumbs up.  Go in hungry because portions are pretty large!\n\nFor me the real star of the night was the dessert. I ordered the pumpkin cheesecake to share; others ordered the sorbet trio and dark chocolate bread pudding. Though all desserts were good, the cheesecake was fantastic! Light, creamy, great pumpkin flavor topped with fresh whipped cream and roasted slivered almonds. It was the table's favorite!

Came back here the night before Nike Women's Half Marathon 2012.  My reservation was at 8:30, because that was the earliest that they had an opening.  I called the day of the reservation and asked if she could give us a call if they could fit us in earlier.  I was told by the hostess that their \"policy doesn't work like that.\"  Fair enough...well, imagine my dismay and irritation when we walk in at 8:30 expecting a full restaurant and saw at least 3 tables that could had seat five open in a half empty restaurant.  Our experience only went downhill from there.\n\nAtmosphere: \n The reason I keep choosing this restaurant is because I really like its atmosphere.  It's dimly lit with cozy booths and tables.  \n\nService:  \nI waited tables for 11 years of my life and can confirm that our waiter was a jerk.  Things he did I thought were rude:  Upon asking if we could have 3 separate checks, he answered \"If I'm not too busy.\"  Seriously, guy?  Either yes or no would have been sufficed.  While taking our order he cut one of our friends off in the middle of an order, and just walked away.  We had to hunt him down to give the rest of her order.  We got the wrong salad.  No apologies were made.  Gratuity was put on a party of 5.  Perhaps because he usually gets crappy tips because he's a crappy waiter?  \n\nFood:  \nComplimentary focaccia bread with olive tapenade: Good, but the bread was cold and slightly stale.\n\nChicken Marsala:  Our friend seemed to like it.\n\nLasagna with sausage:  A carnivorous male actually said there was way too much meat in the lasagna.  Where he was tired of tasting just meat.\n\nFig pizza without bacon:  Our friend enjoyed it.\n\nBeet Salad:  Very very good, with golden and red beets.\n\nMargherita Pizza:  Maybe we're spoiled with the pizza we usually get, but the dough was like cardboard.  Charred cardboard.  Bf stated it tasted worse than frozen grocery store pizza.  The cheese just tasted like bland goop.  There were about 3 ribbons of basil on the pizza.  It was like a cheap $5 frozen cheese pizza.  Ew.\n\nRisotto:  It was supposed to be butternut squash, pureed cauliflower, and arugula.  It tasted like under cooked rice a roni with hard bits of squash.  It was gross.\n\nOverall:  I was displeased with the bad service we got here, and most of the food was so poor in quality, taste, and preparation that I can't justify ever coming back.  I am only embarrassed that I recommended this restaurant to my bf and friends.  Save your money and go elsewhere.

The odd thing was I could make a reservation for 4:45 or 9pm - nothing in between. We arrived at 6pm with no reservation and we were seated within about four minutes. Oh well. I don't understand reservations I guess. Arrived at Morton's ten minutes early for our reservation once and we were asked to wait in the bar. There were only two tables sat in the entire restaurant and no others waiting. But I digress.\n\nOur waitress Veronika was terrific right out of the gate - asked if we'd been there before, explained some things on the menu, the specials, etc, then left us to our devices for a bit, after taking our drink orders (I started with a nice glass of Pinot Noir - quite good - but then I changed gears to a Pinot Grigio, which I prefer with seafood). My Mom had the Frutti di Mare, and I ordered the linguine with clams. Both were passable. Maybe it's just me, but I like a more garlic-y flavor. I'd say that's what was missing - just more flavorful and robust. But again, that might be just me.\n\nVeronika had dessert to us quite quickly (tiiramisu - very good) along with some very good, coffee. I found it to priced well for SF - the Fritti was $23, if memory serves, and the linguine $20. If not for the flavor issue, it'd be top notch.\n\nBottom line - pretty good food, excellent service (ask for Veronika), and not terribly priced.

I'm sure it was no coincidence that the beers he was suggesting were the most expensive on tap. I guess we fell for it because we went with his suggestions and not one of us liked the flavors. We knew that Puccini & Pinetti was a more upscale place, this is why we chose it, but honestly $9 for a bowl of olives?! What are you, nuts!? I settled on the cannelloni that featured house made sausage, ricotta, corn, basil, tomato & sweet peppers, pomodoro, mozzarella, and grana padano.

He being Italian and me growing up on Italian food, we have a lot of experience with this cuisine! We rarely have mediocre Italian food when we are out - which is a lot because I rarely cook.....so we were disappointed to discover that this somewhat upper scale restaurant was just \"meh\". \n\nWe ordered the antipasto appetizer platter which featured some provolone cheese and assorted sliced meats such as prosciutto and salame. It came with slices of plain, toasted bread and olives. Nothing special about the platter, it's about as Italian as it gets. But I didn't come to a restaurant for what I routinely could put together at home. It would have been nice if they had included some seasoned bread or some kind of special spread..anything to show some effort or make it worth how expensive that plate was.\n\nMy husband ordered the spaghetti and meatballs with steak. While the spaghetti was cooked correctly, I was not impressed with the sauce, flavor, and the tough steak. As another Yelper stated, the food is on the bland side. Meatballs were gigantic but flavor didn't really stand out either. The consistency of the meat sauce was just \"chunky\"... and I mean extremely chunky. Alright I guess but with the steak and the meatballs and the chunky spaghetti sauce (consistency of thick chili) not much of it was able to co-mingle with the spaghetti (cuz it fell right off).\n\nI had the lasagna. It was probably the worst lasagna I've ever had. The proportion was humongous (it better be for $25!), it was cut out of a pan in almost a perfect square which is unusual for lasagna! Why? because it SHOULD be cheesy, and saucy, and slightly sloppy with cheese oozing out from all over the sides. I couldn't believe how dry it was. There was barely any sauce, barely any cheese...just 20+ layers of dry lasagna noodle sitting in a perfect square on my plate. I only had a few bites before I begged my husband for some of his spaghetti sauce. It was a shame because again, the lasagna noodle was cooked perfectly (al dente!) but it was bland and plain.\n\nPerhaps the one thing that I would come here for is the excellent bruschetta and spread that came with our meal. It was RIDICULOUSLY good and tasty. But our server never offered to bring us more. The lasagna, spaghetti, and appetizer cost over $70. Rightfully so, I expected much more for paying $25 a plate. While there, I made a comment to my husband about how the ingredients didn't taste fresh and possibly were frozen as another Yelper also noticed. Perhaps the one thing that saves this restaurant is their happy hour which most people seem to rave about.", "author": "Carol A."}

The lunch menu does not have many traditional Italian options.... Very few pastas, there are more salads and sandwiches. I ended up getting a \"grilled cheese with prosciutto\" which was more like a toasted (not pressed) panini. My dining partner got the margherita pizza and it was good. It certainly did not satisfy my craving for Italian.", "author": "Jennifer S."}

So many places in Union Square, but P&P always is reliable and fun.  Calamari Fritto, Warm Spinach Salad, Pappardelle are favorites. Orecchiette comes in at a close 2nd to Pappardelle I do wish they could figure out how to add just a bit of MEAT in the Orecchiette, but it is tasty as a VEGAN dish, and a hint of meat would incite the vegan crowd !  The Short Ribs make up for the lack of meat in the Orecchiette. While not boasting an extensive menu, all is good. \n\nAlways have found the service to be attentive and competent.\n\nLike sitting near the front windows, makes for good \"watching the world go by\" (1st , 2nd and 3rd world - \"variety is the spice of life\" oh yah, but there are some spices that one hopes to never taste.).\n\nAnyhoooo, its a friendly, fun, reliable place to grab a bite.", "author": "Matsuo U."}

Our server made all the difference, and it's because of her that I give them my full recommendation. We went here for my wife's birthday (she is Sicilian, so does not suffer poor Italian...) and had one of the best meals we've had in SF in a very long time. The food was great, the ambiance was nice, and the service kicked it.\n\nPros:\n- OUTSTANDING service; fast, friendly, efficient, accurate, accommodating. Wow\n- The menu is diverse and interesting -- not too fancy, yet very authentic\n- Very nice drinks menu; the Cab I had and the Chard my wife had were both great\n- Value: very good; this is NOT a $40 entree restaurant\n- Kid Friendly: our two daughters enjoyed their entrees and were \"part of the meal\"\n\nCons:\n- None, really. The decor is more casual than \"5-star\" but it was very comfy for us\n\nIn truth, I had originally planned to go to Kuleto's, our long time favorite. Not to take away from Kuleto's, but with our kids and wanting to be casual, P&P blew them away. I'll be hard pressed not to choose P&P the next time I'm going for dinner off Union Square.\n\nHighly recommend you give them a try if you are looking for dinner in the area.\n\nSpecial bonus: since we booked with OpenTable, they gave us a complimentary bruschetta, which, amazingly, was THE best thing on the table.

However, we were completely blown away by Puccini & Pinetti! Felt like a New York style Italian joint. Bustling and a little noisy, but a lively atmosphere with great service. I am extremely gluten sensitive and our waiter was very kind to help me find gluten-free options (they even have a gluten-free menu!). I ordered the mussels as an appetizer and the salmon for an entree and was extremely pleased. The mussels were cooked in a white wine butter sauce that was the perfect amount of salty and brothy. It included spinach, garlic, and roasted red peppers as well. The salmon was cooked perfectly and included a delicious aioli on top. My husband went all-in and ordered the margarita pizza to start and the dinner special - fettuccine carbonara - for his entree. The pizza, as he tells me, was perfectly crispy and thin with a great ratio of cheese to sauce. His fettuccine was also extremely flavorful and decadent. All the food was paired with delicious California wines. A fantastic experience all around!", "author": "Kelly T."}

It was savory and delicious, plus a great compliment to my glass of red wine. Although the fritto misto and meatballs were forgettable, I really enjoyed the mussels with fries. The mussels were small, but tender and very tasty, steamed in a white wine sauce and topped with tomatoes and capers. The fries were crispy, too. The charcuterie meats were all good, too, but good thing I asked our waiter if we could get some grilled bread to eat with it. There was no accompaniment with the meats (i.e. no fruits, nuts, breads, jam, etc.).\n\nAs for the service, our waiter, Kevin, was welcoming and friendly.

Now, I'm all grad-u-m-educated and no longer forced to follow the draconian schedule of academia.  My schedule is now the ho-hum dull-drums of 9ish-to-5ish.  With exceptionally less pay.  I have to do something about that.\n\nToday I met up with a friend who went to the same school.  We have this once-every-two-week event where we meet up for some opulent-to-us Happy Hour bites, and then we go try on shoes.  There's no harm in just trying them on.  And with shoes, it's ok to eat dinner first and not feel fat.  \n\nI got here around 6pm after trying on a massive failure of a skirt at Forever 21.  From that experience, I learned that I am no-longer-21.  AT ALL.  Especially around the waist area.  The bar was starting to fill up.  There were still a few seats at the counter but the majority of the bar tables were filled with happy people imbibing inexpensive libations whilst the sky opened up the heavens and poured.  It was really loud.  REALLY LOUD.  I could hardly hear my friend.  But the ambiance was really hip and happy.  There was not a grumpy drunk among the crowd.  \n\nMy signature drink now is the Virgin Mary.  Yes.  No alcohol.  It's like spicy tomato soup, except cold and tart from the lime juice.  My tongue is salivating just thinking about this drink.  A Virgin Mary costs $3.75.  The bartender made it spicy, just the way I like it.  And there were 2 olives AND a pickled onion!  I love pickled things.  \n\nWe ordered the crab cakes, garlic fries, mussels w/fries, bruschetta and ceasar salad.  \n\nThe crab cakes looked and tasted like they had not changed since the last time I had them about 2 years ago.  Sized between a golf ball and a tennis ball, these crab cakes had a uniform consistency throughout.  This means there was no lump crab.  Too bad.  I make the best crab cakes.  \n\nThe garlic fries were a very decent sized portion.  About the same volume as \"large\" size fries at McDonalds.  There was some fresh garlic crushed on top.  It could have been more flavorful.  I read somewhere that these used to be garlic-parm-fries.  The parm would have been a much welcomed addition.  \n\nMussels w/fries was a paltry serving!  for $8, there were 8 mussels in a small soup bowl on top of a kid-serving of fries.  Not worth it.  The broth was decent but not drink-with-a-spoon fantastic.  The mussels at Nordstrom Bistro is much better.  \n\nBruschetta: the burrata was amazing.  Burrata is the new mozzarella now.  Everyone and their mom's uncle has burrata on the menu.  It was delicious here.  The reduced balsamic drizzle was much too sweet to be taken seriously.  It tasted like it belonged on top of ice cream.  And the stewed tomatoes are a major NO.  I will not order this again.\n\nCeasar salad: also a skimpy serving.  It was about a cup of romaine served on a bread plate.  It used to be much bigger.  How much can salad cost?  It's just lettuce.  And 4 croutons.  NO ANCHOVY FILET.  I feel cheated.  This was not worth ordering.\n\nNext time I want to try the fritto misto.  And I really wish that they would bring back the fried mozzarella balls.  I love me some hot salty balls.  Please please please bring back the fried mozzarella balls.  \n\nIn conclusion: festive, jolly atmosphere.  Very loud so don't try to carry on a conversation.  Delicious Virgin Mary.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-10-21", "description": "As folks who read my reviews know - Service is always the most important thing for me.\n\nOn recent business travel, I chose Puccini & Pinetti on a week night for dinner.  Time was probably a bit after 8pm.   My decision was informed by the reviews here on Yelp, and the fact the place was across the street from my hotel.  The restaurant and bar was somewhat busy - the tables were mostly full, but no one was waiting.\n\nI asked for a table and was told they were really busy at the moment, that I could have a bar seat overlooking the kitchen, or I could wait 5-10 mins for a table.   I said fine, I'd wait (I despise eating at a bar)\n\nAs I waited, a woman came in behind me with a problem with her take-out order.   \n\nAs I eaves-dropped on her problem, I noticed a nice little booth had been sitting clean and ready to go...   so, after the hostess finished with the take-out woman, (told her to wait for manager) I asked about that table.\n\nI was told, \"Oh, we have a policy that we only put 4 people in booths...\" and yet, as I pointed out to the hostess, \"Well, the other 2 booths have only 2 covers in them...\"   \"Well, sometimes we make an exception\" - so I waited a second for \"the exception\" and after she didn't respond, I said, \"So, you won't seat me there?\"   \"No, restaurant policy\"\n\nThe take-out woman snorted and I said, \"Well, then I guess I need to see the manager.\"    The hostess hustled off to get manager.  Take-out woman said to me, \"Jeez, where do these people come from - of course she should've seated you....\"    She went on to explain that her take-out order was prepared totally wrong - all the shrimp was excluded from her shrimp entree...\n\nSo this manager-type approaches and hollers over his shoulder to a server, \"I've got three fires to put out...\"    (apparently we were on fire?)  He then approaches us and says to me, \"I'm going to take care of her first, because she was here longer...\" - Take-out woman rolled her eyes and I was gracious and yielded.\n\nWhile Manager talking to her, two larger parties arrived, and hostess seated them right away, one group at the table I wanted.   Now I'm pissed...\n\nManager assured take-out lady he'll have a fresh order made - would take 20 mins...   and he'd toss this one.   Then turned to me.  I told him that I was frustrated, and they'd seated other folks at my table.    He says, \"We do have a policy that we can only seat 2 or more at the booths...\"  I indicated I felt that silly, I was frustrated, and would be writing a review on Yelp.\n\nHe said, \"Well, what can I do, you're already going to write a bad review...\"  and I paused, giving an opportunity...   he didn't get it right away, then he said, \"Well, we can feed you...\" and waved toward the bar (feed me?   what am I, the family pet?!)....\n\n\"No, I'm going back to your competitor a block away, who welcomed me as a single diner last night, even though they were busy.\"\n\nHis response was, \"Here's my card.   Call me on your next trip and let me know when you're coming and I promise you will have a great dining experience...  I promise.   Just don't write a review until then...\" \n\nI took the card and left. \n\nI debated a few days before I decided to go ahead and write this review.\n\nHere's my position:  Yes, anyone can ensure a diner has a \"great\" experience if the diner calls ahead and says, \"I'm a critic, and I'm coming over in an hour, per our arrangement...\"   That would be a bogus experience that would not accurately represent the Service practices (or food prep practices) that the restaurant has in normal service.\n\nSo, here's my review.    It is clear to me that this place is not focused on the customer experience.   The staff doesn't understand what it takes to be great servers.  They chase covers instead of focusing on providing a great experience.  Management is clearly over their heads and unable to monitor staff behavior and reinforce best practices.\n\nFurther, being surrounded by hotels in Union Square, they don't really care about taking care of business travelers who, while only a single covers, tend to be on expense accounts, often spend more than the average tourist, tip better, and tend to look for places that are reliable so they can give them repeat business.   I thought most restaurants learned this lesson in the 80's...\n\nI intend to stay in the neighborhood on my monthly trips to SF.  I certainly won't be taking advantage of that manager's offer.\n\nI am not the only reviewer here who has indicated this place has serious service issues.    I would recommend avoiding this place - unless you're only looking to be \"fed\".   There's plenty of great dining experiences in the neighborhood.\n\nOh, and Take-Out Woman?   Five minutes later, a cook showed up with a take-out box that looked suspiciously similar to both of us... when she asked if they'd just dumped shrimp in the box, he stuttered a bit, then said, \"No, we had another ready for another table, so I just took that one...\"    Neither of us really believed himh", "author": "Jeffrey F."}

Yes, it is in the middle of a very touristy part of the city, however, the food was above average for this type of neighborhood and the restaurants that surround it.  \n\nMy advice, stick to the \"mom and pop\" Italian items and you will be very pleased. The Spaghetti and meatballs were outstanding. Being an Italian girl I have no doubt that those meatballs were homemade, never frozen and prepared that day.  The sauce had a bit of a kick, which I do in my own kitchen. The penne arrabbiata was great as well. Sausage in the sauce was out of the casing and pasta cooked to perfection.  Both dishes came out piping hot and did not disappoint. The salads are fresh, great and huge.  \n\nThe atmosphere was clean, cozy and a bit predictable, but it was fine. Service prompt, friendly and attentive.  If you want fancy/forced Italian, go around the corner for food that is not as good. If you read the reviews from the 3 stars and below people on this thread, you will see that many focus on themselves or a particular incident. Do not let that ruin your opinion of this place, and accept it for what it is, a solid Italian restaurant in the midst of Union Square.\n\n Reservations needed but you can get them the day of if need be.", "author": "Meg M."}

It was an arugula salad with blood oranges and feta cheese.  The feta cheese was the best part about the salad.  I'm not sure what it was but the salad just didn't feel like it went well together.  For the entree I had the short braised ribs and these were very good.  The creme brulee was also good but nothing over the top.  I was very happy to hear they had sazeracs and I ordered one and it was perfect.  My only issue with this place was that it felt very rushed.  We were here for a business dinner and had planned to take our time and talk and go over things but everything came out so super fast it felt like they were rushing to get us out of there.

It isn't the kind of food that I am really interested in. However, two of our party of 7 are in the middle of a gluten free diet attempt and this place was recommended since it has a gluten free menu.\n\nSunday, 1PM and the place is mostly empty. We made a reservation, just in case, and when we arrived our table was not ready. Nothing major really, but the antenna went up, if for no other reason than there wasn't much of anything else that the servers had to do. OK, so maybe they have had some unpleasant experiences with groups not showing up and they wait until you do before going through the work of setting a table up.\n\nNow to the important part, the food: Burger order was a burnt tire, grilled salmon was still partly frozen in the center and obviously raw. I guess they left the burger cooking while they tried to defrost the salmon; unsuccessfully.  Meanwhile even though the place was less than 5% filled, we waited almost 45 minutes from ordering to being served. \n\nWrong salads arrived, including an all important gluten free version that we had ordered. Grilled bread with the salmon order wasn't there.\n\nSo, I guess you get the drift. As i said when I started out, I knew this wasn't my kind of place, but I figured that I could at least enjoy a simple grilled salmon and have fun with good company. Sad to say this place just does not have a clue about how to do that -  simple, easy to prepare dishes that are almost impossible to ruin, all on a day where there was absolutely no pressure from starving hordes. I can't imagine how the kitchen can cope with crowds!\n\nThe prices were on the really high end too, for basic meals!\nDo yourself a favor and spend twenty/30 minutes getting out to the Mission, Sunset or Clement and get a decent meal for a lot less.\n\nFor those who  are just dying to know.

This place is a must go Sunday- Tuesday for Happy Hour... which, by the way, lasts till 10PM! ENOUGH SAID! Wine and champaign is $3! Must tries are the garlic fries and the margarita pizzas ($5). The bruchetta  is so-so.  Not enough tomato for me. The cheese balls- only had once but were a little greasy. \n\nThe staff is always super friendly and the place is booming so be prepared to wait for a bar-top seat or a spot at the bar!\n\nNote- the bathroom is in the hotel portion. \n\nSee you there.", "author": "Jen E."}

One might think we are alcoholics but really we are more in love with the appetizers and low prices.  Wine and champagne only $3?!  Gourmet snack plates ranging from $4-8??  Yes please!!  \n\nThe bar area is small but we are usually able to find a spot no problem.  The energy is good but it isn't ever too loud so we can still have decent conversations.  The staff is always super friendly, attentive and on top of things.  \n\nNo matter how many I throw back, or how much I stuff my face, I never seem to spend more than 25 bucks.

It seems to be a great deal, but by the time I arrived, all the seats in the bar were taken and nobody appeared to be budging.\n\nInstead, I was seated at a cute table by a window, which allowed for some people watching. And it was nice to have a little nook to myself.\n\nThe service was fabulous here. The waiter was kind, engaged, attentive, and knowledgeable. Need a recommendation? Sure - he'll give you one or two and tell you why he likes it. His support staff was also great - keeping the table neat and tidy, removing dishes in a timely manner, re-filling water glass, etc.\n\nThey serve focaccia as their bread of choice. Not my favorite, but theirs was flavorful. Instead of butter or olive oil, they serve a lovely caper-olive-sundried tomato tapenade. It was *delish*. \n\nI started with the Caesar salad. The dressing seemed more to be a hybrid of creamy Italian and Caesar, but was good nonetheless. Huge shavings of parm adorned the lettuce leaves - big plus in my book. It was a good salad - not perfect, but hit the spot.\n\nThe pizza was the star of the show. I ordered the Margherita pizza. It came out with a super thin crispy crust and wasn't over-sauced. In fact, the sauce was super-flavorful, with a hint of spice from the crushed red pepper flakes. Was a nice touch to cut the richness from the fresh mozzarella. Quick tip: rip off a piece of that crust and dip it in the tapenade. Oh. Yeah. Baby.\n\nI really didn't want or need more to eat, but the dessert menu came out and I had a lovely chat about the gelatos with Kirk, my server. They had butter pecan gelato, and I just couldn't resist. Instead of the trio, he was happy to just bring me a scoop. All I can say is: Heaven. Evidently they have an adult milkshake with this butter pecan goodness and bourbon that is out of this world. Next time, for sure!!\n\nI can be a bit critical and high maintenance, I admit it. So it was nice to be surprised by great service and a lovely meal! I  was so  impressed with the service, that I stopped at the host stand on my way out to have a bravo message passed along to the manager. \n\nAnd next time I'm in SF, I will definitely be back!", "author": "HAnne D."}

I love the location especially since it's just around the corner to Urban Outfitters. \n\nYesterday was my first time at Puccini & Pinetti and I was skeptical of the touristy location, but ended really enjoying my meal. The service was unusually good! From the order, to the water, to the checking back, to the food, to the good byes, they didn't miss a beat. \n\nPuccini & Pinetti might not be the BEST Italian restaurant but it's definitely good. I made a last minute reservation on opentable.com (love the website) for a table at 730pm. I arrived 30 minutes early but the restaurant was kind of busy so the Hostess suggested my companion and me to come back in 20 minutes, so we end up walking around Urban and walked back to Puccini. Right when we walked in, the Hostess seated us quickly. \n\nI love the Focaccia bread they serve w/olive oil before your meal. I recommend the Bruschetta, Marisa Chicken & Lamb Chops (cooked in medium rare please). Many people ordered the spaghetti with meatballs, it looks good but I just don't like eating a lot of carbs for dinner. Prices can range from $11-25.00 a plate, the portions are just right but if you feel your food wont fill you up, you can always ask your waiter for more bread. Our food came pretty fast. One thing I enjoy most about Puccini is their open kitchen, so you don't have to worry about the chefs spitting in your food if you accidentally or purposely pissed them off. \n\nThe wait staff was very professional, friendly and tentative. I give my waitress 5 stars just because she kept coming back with our refills and I drank at least 5 cups of water. I wonder why the glasses are so small when they could just serve us bigger glasses so the waitress doesn't have to keep refilling. \n\nTip: Always try to find FREE street parking after 6pm. All the yellow zones are for free, there are always empty spots near Nann and Curry or if you are lucky you can always find a spot along the street across from H&M. Never paid for parking on a weekday!\n\nhmmm...and for desert -- Coldstones is right next door! :)", "author": "Carol Y."}

A buddy of mine and I were searching desperately downtown for a place to grab dinner after a long day's work when we happened upon P & P.\n\nThe place is nicely decorated and was full of people and pretty lively (for what, I recall was a Sunday night).\n\nI had a nice chianti with my *gasp* spaghetti (yes, it's like ordering fried rice in a Chinese restaurant) and the bread was quite tasty so that made up for my order.\n\nThe spaghetti was actually pretty salty (specifically it was the meatballs).  I usually have a huge salt craving and will add it to almost all my foods...but in this case the meatballs seemed to be saltier than the SF bay!  It was almost like salt was used in place of the usual bread crumbs or garlic....ack!\n\nI will not be too harsh since the service was good and I'd have to give it another try to confirm (could be a fluke).  I should have requested a different meat so it's partially my fault.\n\nMy buddy had what could have been mistaken for \"cioppino\" but was actually \"frutti di mare\".  Basically the pasta and seafood dish was extremely soupy which to me is a huge turn off because if I wanted soup and noodles I'd go eat some ramen or won ton soup.  I'm wondering if that's they're \"style\" or if they just didn't drain the seafood after boiling it....it's supposed to be saucy enough to dip your bread but it just looked like soup.\n\nWorth a try if you're ever downtown SF.\n\n\n\n(on a side note...the atmosphere was almost completely ruined by some cackling chick/yeti/hyena-lady who was WAYYY too amused by her two friends and voice seemed like it was about to make the paint fall off the ceiling into my food - if I ever get that loud after some wine...just throw me under a cable car please!)", "author": "Richard C."}

They had a sign on their windows advertising Happy Hour $3 beer and wine, and it's false advertising! They have a special menu for their happy hour drinks which I'm not mad about, but just don't advertise falsely outside to lure people in. We sit down at the bar around 9:50 and the host recommends us to order before last call. The male bartender was super nice and friendly, offering different recommendations about beer and cocktails. Appreciated the service and strong drinks! The place was still packed even though it was 10PM on a Sunday! \n\nSo we're drinking, enjoying a nice night in SF being from out of town, and a guy sits down a few seats away at 10:10pm and the nice bartender happily served him anyway. We hear him order a margherita pizza and a house cabernet off their happy hour menu. The nice bartender who was serving him was super accommodating, got him the cab right away but came back a few minutes later and regretfully but kindly informed him that the kitchen had already closed. The man literally yelled and cussed aloud \"That's f$^%ing bulls&*%!!\", and the bartender kept his cool and still felt bad! He offered the man the Cab on the house and again reiterated his apologies. My girlfriend and I felt bad for the nice bartenders, and were angered at the insanely rude customer. It's not their fault! They served him anyway! The guy was rude, just rude. Needless to say, we finished our drinks quickly and left right away..", "author": "Adam Z."}

This is the only reason why I remained poised during my dinner experience. \nThe waitstaff was friendly but unattentive and incompetent. The reservations specifically noted that 2 very young children would be on the party, yet we were seated at a table close to the hustle and bustle of the kitchen.  On to the food...marginal at best. I ordered the chicken Marsala and my spouse ordered the Fruiti de Mare.  My dish was doused with an overwhelming amount of very salty Marsala sauce. Perhaps the sauce was used to mask the artificial texture of the chicken and take your attention away from the overcooked spinach.  My husband's dish looked soupy and the pasta was clumpy.  He picked at his food and merely moved it around on his plate. The children's order was only partially fulfilled.  We had to remind our server multiple times for a simple glass of milk so the mother could refill their sippy cups. The children's food, when it finally arrived, was too hot for adults to eat, yet alone children.  The server then proceeded to place the steaming plates in front of the youngest child, who immediately recoiled from the visible steam.  Finally, onto dessert...I ordered gelato. Or should I say ice cream from the supermarket presented in a fancy bowl with a high mark-up.  Overall one of the most disappointing dining experiences ever.

I cannot help myself but to think that it's so effing racist of him. I'm Filipino, I was with my Bolivian co-worker friend and his Mexican girl friend. We went to your place to wait for my \"Mexican\" friend to have sushi dinner somewhere. When my friend arrived, he decided that he would just have dinner there because he's really hungry. He asked for the bar list and dinner menu. \"That\" waiter came and asked for our orders. (We've been drinking Peroni, which is on their happy hour list.) My Bolivian friend ordered calamari, garlic fries, nachos, and the meatballs which are all part of the happy hour menu. My Mexican friend (who's really fancy), ordered  white wine and a chicken burger, both are not part of the happy hour menu. He took our order and left. My fancy Mexican friend went to the restroom. \"That\" waiter came back and said, \"the wine (he mentioned the name that I cannot remember) is not part of the happy hour, and the burger too\", I said \"Okay\". He said \"I just want to make sure.\" One time is okay, but really? He asked again my  fancy Mexican friend when he came back from the restroom saying, \"Excuse me, I just want to tell you that the wine you have ordered is $9. Fancy Mexican said, \"Yes I know\". He could just have left and get the effing wine, but no, he said, \"Well, I was just asking because, I mean $9, and happy hour wine is $4, you know you can get 2 glasses...\" I said, \"you've asked me already\", he said, \"oh I just want to make sure because sometimes a lot of people would be (making a face and irritating voice) oh, we didn't know it's not on happy hour, blah, blah, blah...\" REALLY?!?!?!

My boyfriend and I came in around 5:30ish and only had to wait about 5 minutes (score!).\n\nWe started out with the bruschetta - slices of bread with stewed tomatoes, basil, and goat cheese, all drizzled with a little bit of oil and vinegar. It was definitely different, I'm used to more traditional bruschetta. Still this definitely hit the spot and was really yummy.\n\nFor our main course, I had the capellini and my boyfriend had the bistecca. The capellini came with tomatoes, basil, and huge pieces of mozzarella cheese....sooo good! The bistecca came with a small salad an some mashed potatoes - my boyfriend said it was delicious.\n\nFor dessert I ordered the chocolate cake with vanilla gelato and my boyfriend ordered the creme brulee. Both were so yummy and a perfect ending to a very filling dinner.\n\nOverall, this is a great dinner spot and very close to Union Square if you are staying in the area.", "author": "Stephanie C."}

Also had the hot chocolate truffle cake with ice-cream which was OK. \n\nPlenty if wines by the glass, half bottle or full bottle and they let us taste a few before deciding.

Within walking distance to Union Square, and very open feeling as it has large windows looking out onto either side of its corner location. This made for good 'people watching' on a Saturday afternoon, as the streets were crowded.  \n\nFirst off, the wine selections were wonderful. They offered a McMurray Pinot Noir for $7 a glass.  This is a deal, considering we've seen it sold for almost $14 a glass elsewhere.  We ordered the bruschetta, and I would not say it was my favorite.  The portion was a bit small, but the goat cheese and sauce were very flavorful. However, the bread and tapenade they serve when you sit down were outstanding!  I'd skip the bruschetta next time and just order more of that awesome bread.  \n\nThe spaghetti and meatballs were really savory. Not the typical red sauce you'd expect to find in an Italian restaurant.  Heavier on the meat, less on the tomatoes.  Delicious, and the portion size was generous.   There was shaved parmesan cheese on top. Just enough for taste, and not over-powering. \n\nOur friends had the Frutti di mare, and raved about it.  I sampled one of the mussels and it was fresh and very tasty.  \n\nThe service was wonderful.  Attentive, and friendly.  We were surprised to notice later that our waiter was also the bartendar.  He did a great job keeping up with both, and we didn't even notice.  As we left, the restaurant was filling up, so I assume there was probably more staff at that time.  They had the classic t.v. show \"The Streets of San Francisco\" playing at all times in the background (silently with sub-titles).  Nice touch.  Very retro.  \n\nI'd recommend this place for sure.

We selected a corner seat in the bar area and settled in. After a couple of minutes a waitress went to the table next to us and made a large gesture to us with both thumbs over her shoulders to a waiter at the bar. Uh oh. My take was that she was frustrated that she had to tell her colleague that he needs to notice his new customers. \nThe waiter came over, and we placed our order for drinks and a carpaccio. The drinks came, the carpaccio did not. Eventually, the waiter came by and said, \"Uh, did you order something to eat?\" We reminded him of the carpaccio. He apologized, and it came shortly thereafter.\nMy husband's mojito did not taste very good. He asked the waiter if he could trade it for another drink, and the waiter agreed readily. We were not charged for the icky mojito. That was good.\nOverall, despite the somewhat clueless but nice waiter, I really liked this place.

Ordered the bruschetta, margherita pizza, warm spinach salad and capellini - the complimentary bread was not warm and we were a bit concerned how the rest of the meal was going to be. The dip that came with the bread was delicious though. The Bruschetta arrived next - toasted bread slices drizzled with balsamic glaze and served with a generous heap of chunky stewed tomatoes and a large dollop of warm goat cheese spread - just awesome!  The pizza was good, though it left a slight aftertaste. The spinach salad was warm with roasted peppers and fresh spinach - simple and delicious. We saved the Capellini for later. Our server Saul was nice, kept checking on us and kept our waters filled. Not long of a wait for the food to arrive, reasonable prices and good food.

I come in my suit, and in my jeans and T-shirt, and I'm still treated like they want my business either way.\n\nThe appetizers are decent. The calamari are better than any calamari I've tasted in any other restaurant, and that is saying a lot. The entrees are also good. If you want something that is not on the menu, like say, Tilapia, they will make it for you if they have it in the kitchen. If you don't like the vegetables or sides that come with your entree, they will also be open to replacing it with something you would rather have, as long as it's in the kitchen. Everyone likes the spaghetti, and although its an okay dish, I don't like spending that kind of money on something I can make at home for a buck. If you want something safe, the pizzas are AWESOME. I've had dessert here a couple of times, it's nothing special, so don't waste your money. The coffee also is nothing special, so just get your check after the entrees arrive. \n\nBottom line- nice safe italian restaurant that has a user-friendly menu that anyone can read, that is nicer than Olive Garden and costs about the same.", "author": "Daryl Y."}

Wow!  I was impressed at the variety of small bites and appetizers that were on the menu for anywhere between $3 and $7.  The white and red wine is $3 a glass and the champagne is $3!  They also have various beers averaging about $4 a pop.  \nWe each ordered, ahem, about 3 glasses of red wine, which was a decent cab.  We also ordered the cheese plate, the crystal hot sauce chicken tenders, the house marinated olives and the Italian meatballs.  My favorite was the crystal hot sauce chicken tenders, because I'm partial to Crystal Hot Sauce.  But, seriously, for the prices, the food was a good value and tasted really good.\nOur server was super-friendly and very attentive.  We weren't waiting at all to get refills on our wine!

I've always like their menu and casual but kind of funky decor. \n\nThe night we went, it was crowded which I expected becaue it was happy hour and on certain nights (like Tuesday) happy hour goes from 3 p.m. to closing!  I managed to get us a great corner window table in the bar section within about 15 minutes (by talking to the guys still at the table into telling me when they were leaving) which meant we didn't have to wait for 45+ minutes to be seated in the restaurant section (as we forgot to make a res).  Once we sat down, or should I say swooped into that table and chairs once the guys left... we were promptly greeted by a friendly waitress, given menu's and she took our drink orders. We ordered three appetizers (2 of each) from the very affordable Happy Hour List.  We shared brushetta, crab cakes w/salad, and meatballs as our dinner.  The crab cakes were very tasty and had a great aioli sauce, but they didn't look like the traditional shape/size of a CC.  These were more the size and shape of golf balls.  Regardless, they were good and one of my nieces (who never had crab cakes) liked them, so that was a plus.  The brushetta and meatballs were also good.  Two pieces of brushetta per plate and a lot of meatballs in each bowl with a sufficient amount of tasty red sauce.  With 4 drinks and six appetizers the bill came to about $70.  Since we had planned to get pedicures (at $60 a pop ea) and decided to have drinks and eat instead, I was happy to pay only $70!   Best parking is the Ellis/O'Farrell Garage.  Their address is 123 O'Farrell, but I believe you enter on Ellis and exit on O'Farrell.  For the 2+ hours one niece was there, she only paid $6 to park just a few blocks away so that was a plus.", "author": "Debra G."}

I chose it specifically because I have celiac disease and  it was listed as a gluten free restaurant. They even had a gluten free menu online with a variety of pastas with different sauces. I thought it would be great. What a joke. When I got there they said yes they had gluten free pasta although they only had it in spaghetti noodles. Sure is difficult to make the ravioli on the gluten free menu with spaghetti noodles, therefore I chose the spaghetti and meatballs. I asked if they meatballs had wheat as a filler, since they usually do, and was told no. I asked about the minestrone soup on the gluten free menu since it should have pasta noodles in it. They said it did have noodles and that they weren't gluten free. Glad I asked. Why is it on the gluten free menu??? When I got my sphagetti the waiter said he double checked and that the meatballs did have wheat as a filler so he left them off. In the end I got spaghetti and marinara sauce. Not quite what I'd expected. This restaurant kind of decided to jump on the gluten free bandwagon wihout any understanding of what they were doing. Lucky if they don't make someone real sick someday. I talked to the manager about all this and he said he could understand my concerns and would see what they could do in the future. I won't hold my breath.\n\nOh, the other people in my party weren't gluten free and they were under impressed with their normal items.

Meat was tender and seasoned just right... worked really well with the pesto mashed potato. It didn't last very long on my plate.

It is standard fair mid range turn and burn Italian restaurant attached to a hotel.  My portabello house made ravioli with a cream sauce and frise was delicious.  The house pinot I got was, \"ok\".  Our server was an honest, shorter woman with glasses and a spunky attitude.  She was awesome.  The pistachio cheesecake was... interesting.  Better than I would have thought, and I can't judge as neither of those hit my palette well.  \n\nHere's the rub... It was valentine's and a group of 5 of us had no reservation.  My partners asked, and management said they didn't have room.  He must have seen them miserably ambling about in the rain, looking confused... because he ran back out 15 minutes later and said, \"We can do it!\".  They set it up, took care of us... it was fantastic.  We ordered a dessert that was 86'd *AFTER* we ordered it.. and he was apologetic about the gaffe.  We cancelled our full round of desserts, yet he still brought us a couple comp treats, partially for the mistake, but mostly because \"[he] couldn't let us leave without dessert.\"\n\nThe food was fine.  I don't know if I would venture back anytime soon... but I am downtown often and this will stick out in my memory.\n\nIt has been a long time since I have seen this, and I have worked in the industry for almost two decades....  \n\nbut the management of this restaurant \"gets it\".  Like... REALLY REALLY get's it.  This was one of the first times in a long time I saw service take potential gaffes and mistakes and turned them into solid responses that were customer centered and kindly deferential.  It was a pleasure to be in that experience.\n\ncheers bald headed smiling gent.... you did a fantastic job on that \"in the weeds\" busy night.  I can rightly assume you have your management and staff in line the same way.\n\nA consummate professional experience, it made me miss running a well honed restaurant.  Of course, they might not think it is... but I never saw \"the man behind the curtain\" and the fourth wall was completely contained.  Whether it is a well run restaurant or not, they handled it such that it obviously seems to be... which is sometimes... on some nights... all that matters.", "author": "Uncle Fishbits Aeneas X."}

The salad was your average, decent mixed green salad, the pasta was pretty bland (some kind of pasta with oil, sun dried tomatoes, and garlic type thing.). Dessert was pretty good.

Big open dining room with nice wood, yellow sponge paint on the walls, and tourists in t-shirts with their kids.

Please don't eat here.\n\nUpdate: I just looked at the pictures and their menu online. They have an appetizer called \"pasta nachos\". Wow.

The soft goat cheese in the middle of the plate look like a double scoop of ice cream, and with the balsamic vinegar drizzle swirling around the entire plate resembled a chocolate drizzle found on a Sundae. \n I had the Bucatini Arrabiata which was a hardier serving than what I was anticipating. I can't say enough about this dish other than I will need to go back for another. The heat was enough to warm you up, while the rest of ingredients add a wonderfully fresh finish to each bite. \nIf you find yourself in DTSF with a bit of an appetite do yourself a favor and stop by and give this place a try.", "author": "Edgar P."}

The executive chef along with the sous chefs were very playful with each other and answered any questions we had.  \n\nOur food was fantastic.  The squash soup was incredibly delicious.  It was sweet, which was an unexpected surprise, but we couldn't put it down it was so good.

But Puccini & Pinetti seated us immediately anyway with no issues. Major, major points for that. \n\nThe restaurant's Italian-by-numbers and brightly-colored interior might seem about as authentic as Disneyland to San Franciscans, but it turned out to be wildly exotic to the Midwesterners. \"What's pomodoro sauce,\" they asked the waiter. Seriously. God bless them. But they ordered two bottles of wine and gobbled down all their food, and they thought their crazy liberal nephew was a genius for taking them to such a great place. \n\nIn all fairness, the calamari were pretty damn good, and my scallops with asparagus/prosciutto risotto was totally tasty. It probably gets made better at 20 places in North Beach for half the price, but that's not the point.\n\nWe all agreed the chocolate creme brulee was pretty bad, though.\n\nSo, San Franciscans, when sweatshirt-wearing relatives come out for conferences and want to go our to dinner and you don't want to bother with a cab and stuff, P&P is a great bet. Plus, now you can enjoy listening to them talk about wanting to emigrate.", "author": "Ben G."}

I would go back just to have those two items again.  \n\nMy best friend used to work here and I suggested this place because Mom possibly would eat there and two the staff has always been amazingly good spirited and friendly.

I was impressed with the staff and their support because of it. \n\nWe met the owner that night and she was delightful and really personable.

I think we had high expectations and then were highly disappointed.  Both my friend and I were perusing through the photos on yelp and the menu deciding what we would order the night before. \n\nI honestly rushed out of work today because I couldn't contain my excitement for the delicious sounding food. The portions are small. The truffle parmesan fries were a dud. My other friend got the burger with regular fries. We couldn't really tell the difference. We also got the italian 3 cheeses with candied walnuts and apple slices - personally, I did not like this at all, but if you're a big cheese fan...it could be awesome. I would say it's because it has a VERY STRONG flavor that I'm not used to.  We also got a pizza, crispy calamari and breaded cheese raviolis. The raviolis were pretty yummy, but you only get 3 for $5.\n\nPoints for:\n-really good calamari and garlic aioli dipping sauce. No rubbery taste there.\n\n-$4 pizza.\n\n-a table at a relatively quick speed. (This is probably because my friend went there early to beat the crowd.)\n\n-good company and funny stories alongside cheap beer.\n\nPoints off for:\n-not having the pasta nachos.\n\n-disappointingly small portions.\n\nI would give it 2.5 stars, but they don't have halves, so I just rounded up because I'm feeling generous.\n\nOverall, it was okay, nothing spectacular. I'm not sure I would come back, maybe for dinner because of other yelper's raves of some of their dinner menu items.

Whoever invented this version of bruschetta is a genius.\n\nThe arugula salad was fantastic as well. Nicely crisp peppery-spicy baby greens, roasted corn, cherry heirloom tomatoes, chunks of avocado, onions, cucumbers, slivers of cheese, soft pesto croutons, and a lively sweet dressing. An ideal arugula salad!\n\nBy unfortunate contrast, the beet salad was pitiful. It was a pile of off-color, bad tasting lettuce leaves, some chunks of goat cheese, and surprisingly few pieces of beet, which were unpleasantly vinegary.

We'd just driven in from LA and it was so noisy so I asked if we could be moved to an open table that was across from the kitchen a few steps down.  The host said that we had to wait because the server had too many tables.  He brought us back to the front of the restaurant so we could wait.  As we were waiting, we glanced at the Happy Hour menu.  I also looked at the regular menu.  The Happy Hour menu was much less expensive so we chose that as we werent that hungry.  The food was good, and a total bargain.  My partner had meatballs( 5 bucks for a huge plate), a cheesy bread which was more like a grilled cheese panini with a pomodoro sauce and a pizza margarita( both 5 bucks).  I had crab cakes that seemed to be deep fried.  Those were served with some greens that were a bit too salty.  I had the shrimp cocktail that was served with a bloody mary cocktail sauce.  There was way too much sauce for 5 shrimp.  The shrimp were great, perfectly cooked.  I could have eaten 10 more.  The sauce was too spicy and didnt really taste like cocktail sauce. My partner loved the meatballs.  To me, those were a deal since spagetti and meatballs on the regular menu was 20.00. Not sure why pasta costs 15 dollars.  We didnt drink, so with 2 sodas, our bill was 38 and change and we were full.", "author": "Randi M."}

First off, some day I'm going to open a restaurant where every person, particularly female, who walks in by herself, is going to get the best seat in the house, and all the couples are going to be relegated to sitting outside the kitchen, near the serving stations, etc. This was the vow I made to myself after once again, being seated by the hostess at Puccini & Pinetti in the worst seat available. What is it with restaurants? Don't they think that women eating by themselves would like a nice view? Don't want to listen to or smell the kitchen, or be constantly assaulted by wait staff reaching for this or that? So, so tired of this ongoing trend. I eat out a lot by myself, particularly on business, and gosh I'd like to be treated like a first class citizen for a change. \n\nOkay, after that little rant, I still wouldn't recommend this place. I ordered the beet salad appetizer (too cold so the ingredients didn't meld, could have been canned beets, really), and the osso buco....which was very tough, served over risotto, which was nice. I had a glass of wine. I left, because, hey, who wants to stick around and watch the wait staff putting together salads and grabbing silverware to give to other more fortunate diners seated near the front of the restaurant or the window? I was pleasant. I left a great tip. I'm a nice person, even attractive in my own way.

For dessert, we opted for the chocolate cake (sort of a souffle) and the marscapone cheesecake. Everything we had was definitely decent. But nothing was great.

The dish was excellent- and I was pleasantly surprised that the Yukon potatoes held their own distinct taste even with the marsala sauce nearby.  JOnah had the risotto- one of the best I've tasted (yes, I ate some of his food)!  We had a warm truffle dessert a la mode and a mocha- a great paring indeed! They kept our beverages full and multiple staff members checked on us to make sure we were having a delicious experience. \n\nThe place was clean, with nice huge windows one can use to people watch while eating- a great thing to do in downtown SF.

No doubt the recommendation was because of its ownership, but we took it at face value.  The hotels are great and the food at their neighboring restaurants has typically been very tasty as well.  This was definitely an exception.  \n\nIt took us an hour to get seated.  The waiter seated numerous parties before us, even though we were there first and requested to be seated at the bar to save time.  When we finally were served, it took them 10-15 minutes just to get us a menu.  When we did receive the food, it was subpar.  The selection was mediocre as well.

Decided to come here after my gf strongly insisted we try it out. Went there without reservations with party of 4 and got seated at a table in the bar section after half hour wait. \n\nWe were given menus after 3-4 minutes of waiting around, wondering if we'd be serviced. The prices range from $10-25. Typical \"mid-fancy italian restaurant\" prices. \n\nOrdered calamari which was good. I also liked the bread and the special olive oil + whatever \"flakes\" stuff it is they put in there. \n\nI won't bore you with all the details so let me get straight to the point. I ordered a $20 plate of Frutti di Marre that was absolutely good, pasta with a red seafood broth yum yum. Only problem is me and my gf decided to split. This plate is not one you can split. For $20 I expected a looot more pasta, but obviously this wasn't Buppa di Becca (sp?). Heck, I could go to Sbarro's and buy a $5 plate and get twice as much pasta. Sure I'm comparing apples to oranges but for $20, I expect a lot more pasta. If I ate this plate alone, I probably would still be hungry. I ended up eating bread to get myself full. \n\nAnother problem - I ordered ice tea, emptied it in 15 minutes, and did NOT get a refill throughout the rest of the meal. What made it worse was my friend got a refill for his root beer, so I felt singled out on not getting a refill. And WAIT, that's not it. His refill wasn't even free, it was one of those damn \"oh here's a refill, and we'll charge u later on the tab, sucker\" refills.\n\nI read the previous review that said the brought in their own cake and got charged $3/person.

Every time she served us anything, she said \"It looks delicious...I'll come back later to make sure it tastes delicious too.\"  Anyone that worked at the restaurant who walked by our table was very courteous and friendly, saying \"hi\" and asking how we were doing.  Superb!

The potato and leek soup was yummy but the parsley on top, although aesthetic, added a gross parsley taste to the soup which I did not enjoy.  My friend and I ordered the chicken marsala, a sauteed chicken breast on top of spinach and mashed potatoes in a mushroom marsala sauce.  The sauce ruined the entire dish; it did not taste like a marsala sauce..maybe it wasn't reduced enough?  I tasted too much wine and it was very watery and swallowed my entire plate.  It was disappointing.  My other friend got the butternut squash gnocchi and said it was very dense but tasty.  He got about half way before he felt too full to continue.  We ended with the tiramisu that came with a vanilla cream sauce that tasted like melted ice cream.

Kinda stumbled upon it, and I wasn't sure why we stopped here, with so many restaurants stacked within the 4 blocks radius of here. But we went.\n\nA playoff game was on so bar area was filled. Not too big of a bar area, so it didn't take away from the ambiance. It never got loud or rowdy. Had a lounge-y feel to the place (especially the front bar area). We were seated towards the back of the restaurant. Open kitchen along the side of the restaurant space (long floorplan.). So you see the action if you sit close enough. They have some beers on tap (anchorstein, bud light, the standard stuff..) and others in bottles. Pretty good wine list. \n\nActual menu is focused and not very large. This is perfect! Restaurants who try to offer everything usually doesn't do well in anything. Puccini has a mission- to offer seasonal italian meal, with home cooked feeling- and it does it well. The people in my party got: Short Rib with pesto mashed potatoes (the person liked it a lot, noting that it wasnt heavy and the meat had a nice tenderness without losing texture), lasagna bolognese (before i checked in, the person already wiped the plate clean.. the portion was good too! so he must have enjoyed it!), home made parpadelle with prociutto, spinach and asparagus (I got to try a little. It needed more \"umph\" acid, salt or some kind of seasoning. the cream sauce was ok. the pasta was well made. Very home made looking. the person in my party liked it, but wished there was more meat/ prociutto and not as much greens). I had the Frutti de Mare (seasonal seafood stew, tomato based saffron flavored broth, served with linguini and crostini). Good healthy portion. Generous with the shrimp and calimari and mussels. The broth was delicious to soak up the crostini with. But i do wish i had a little something in the broth. While the saffron was nice (without overpowering) it lacked a little acid to cut it, and some kick (maybe a little pepper?) Overall it was delicious. I would order it again. \n\nEntrees were between $20-$30. It wont break the bank. The place is good for business lunch/ dinner, as well as dates actually.

The clams and linguine was a rather large dish and I had a difficult time finishing. The dish was prepared well it just was not my favorite. I liked the clams just not the rest of the pasta, cause of the large kick to it. Not a fan of spicy dishes, but if you like it go ahead and have it. \n\nThe soup though was amazingly well done, butternut squash with a hint of maple syrup or whatever it was that sweet.

VERY efficient.  \n\nWhen our waitress finally showed up she non-chalantly asked me if I WAS WAITING FOR HER...hmmm...what the fuck else would I be doing exactly...my  plate is empty, I've been waving at your for 20 minutes and I want some tea and dessert.  In any case, she finally took our tea and coffee orders, never offered a dessert menu and just seemed aloof the whole time.  She was a nice girl but either distracted or inexperienced.  The place happened to be out of earl grey so instead of asking me what I wanted as a substitute, she just brought me some other random black tea.  Luckily enough, I like breakfast blends and took what she gave me but WTF...\n\nThe speed of food deliver is a major plus for any restaurant but it has no bearing on the QUALITY of your service or the food itself.  I saw other tables being taken care of much better than ours so give this place a shot, however, understand there is a chance your meal will be a disorganized mess.", "author": "Sean M."}

We'd made a reservation requesting a specific table which is out of the way and quiet. We told them we were having a meeting and did not want to be seated near any large parties. When we arrived we were seated next to a 10-person party at such close proximity we were practically sitting in each other's laps. It was extremely unpleasant. The wait-staff were very kind while explaining there was \"nothing they could do\" but the cloyingly nice attitude while staunchly refusing to seat us where they said they would (the table we wanted was open when we arrived, by the way) was EXTREMELY LAME.\n\nThe food -- as indicated otherwise on this site, is uninspired.

Our entrees were tasty, too-- we had the short ribs with pesto mashed potatoes (the star of the dish), lasagna and spaghetti & meatballs (perfect if you're craving pasta), and a warm spinach salad (I heard no complaints).

We were both visiting Frisco and wanted some Italian near by our hotel.  The wine selection was nice with a choice of some nice italian half bottles.  The starter Misto salad was very good.  I ordered the Butternut Squash Gnocchi and my friend ordered the Bolognese Lasagna.  Her's was like a squared hamburger.  There was way too much meat in it.  My gnocchi came out like a plate of roasted potatoes and cubed butternut squash.  When I first saw it, I thought...hmmm, interesting but probably tasty.  Not.  It was very bland and dry.  Gnocchi should still be light and fluffy, but instead it was hard and starchy.  I had to ask for a side of marinara, just to add some flaver.   So, we both weren't fans of our meals and we're still craving something, so of course we had to gander at the dessert menu.  She got the Lava chocolate torte thingy, which was more like a brownie topped with vanilla ice cream.  I got the trio Gelato...more like watered down ice cream.  \nThe costs of the meals are higher than the quality.  Next time, we'll be hitting up North Beach.", "author": "Diana D."}

It was the most buttery and delicious nectar of the gods that I have ever had.  The steak was tender and delicious.  The breaded eggplant with garlic spaghetti was fa-boo.  There was so much minced garlic in the noodles that you could see the smell vapor radiate out of our mouths.  Normally that could be bad, but hell, being single has its benefits occasionally.

I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. I do think I saw an advertisement once when I went to watch David Sedaris at the War Memorial Opera House, that said if you attended a show at the Opera House you could get 15% off for dinner at Puccini if you brought your ticket with you.\n\nEither ways, $18.95 for spaghetti and meatballs (their signature dish, and not a big serving either) is just not a good deal. It tasted really delicious though, and had a relatively overwhelming garlic flavor, which I happen to like :) I still prefer Chow's spaghetti + meatballs (and their portion size and price). I've also tried the frutti di mare (a big serving, and it looks like ciopinno and comes w/ crostini), grilled chicken panini with pesto (their lunch special of the day), ahi tuna appetizer (humongous portion, might as well be an entree, and it also comes with crostini and eggplant), and the complimentary bread and dipping oil (complete with sun-dried tomatoes and peas).\n\nThe first time I was here I had a terrible dining experience, really not the restaurant's fault though. We were sitting next to a group of overweight, over-aged, overly-drunk wierdos from the Sunset area, and they were drunk and screaming about their lost youth. Seriously they all had a story to tell or something to vent about but they didn't seem to understand the concept of waiting for someone to finish their story before beginning theirs, so instead everyone just yelled over one another until the loudest person won. The person that won repeatedly was a woman who kept screaming \"B*tches and HO's! B*********tches and HOOOOOO's!\" for no apparent reason, until another woman won over by yelling at the top of her lungs \"METALLICCAAAAAAA BAABBBYYY!!!!!\" until another woman beat her and yelled \"RENEEE IS A F*ING B*TCH@(*#&$@!!~~!!!!!!!\". That same woman ended up tripping (on nothing) and falling on her ass right next to my seat and looking at me and screaming.\n\nIt was amazing... I felt like I was watching a sad sitcom.

I got the chicken marsala which taste fine but seemed like it had was frozen at some point and then just re-warmed.  The BF's pasta was bland - it was the fettuccine with the prosciutto and I guess nice that it wasn't drenched in a heavy creamy sauce, but some flavor would have been OK.  \nIf you are going to go - seems like it is a good idea to make reservations, I think a lot of tourists come here because it was crowded but not really like crowded full of SF peeps.

We went onto opentable.com to find any Italian restaurants in the city that still had reservations for that evening, and this one did, so we just went.  We only had to wait 2 minutes for our table once we got there, and our server was very nice. The bread is fantastic, and the water guy could tell we were starving, and kept bringing us more, I seriously think we ate like 3 loaves...ahahha.  They had a special lobster and shrimp pasta special, so I said what the hell and ordered it.  \nIt was freaking BITTER! Like there were grapefruit seeds mixed into the sauce, and the entire dish tasted sooooo gross and bitter!! I didn't want to cause a scene, but I kindly told our server and she was soooooo sweet and brought me an entire new dish w/o the grapfruit seeds, and she freakin piled on the lobster...yummmmmm!!!!!!!\nWasn't my favorite Italian restaurant, but did the job.  Extra points for the bread. It's close to  Union Square, so I think tourists must hit it up. Probably wouldn't go back again, but wouldn't be opposed to it if someone really wanted to go.  It's not really that \"Italian\". I was expecting lots of ravioli's and such, and there really weren't that many. Kinda an American/Italian restaurant more than straight Italian.", "author": "Lauren G."}

We came around 6pm. It was a little busy, but not full, and we were seated right away. I like the food here, but the service last night was definitely not up to par. The food came out very fast. However, ALL of our dishes (appetizers AND entrees) were brought out at the same time. Plus the bread and bread plates were still on our table -- this created A LOT of clutter. The food was tastey. At the time, I didn't really enjoy my burger -- maybe because I was eating it at the same time as the bruchetta or maybe because I just felt so claustrophobic at my table... I dont know, so I only ate half. (Side note: I heated up the leftovers for lunch today and it actually tasted a lot better than last night.)\n\nWe finished our food and some of our plates were cleared from the table. I looked around for our waitress and noticed her wiping a wine glass by the bar. Service actually wasn't too bad until this point. I waved at her to get her attention (because we wanted to order tea and dessert), she looked blankly into space as I continued to wave and wave. My boyfriend and mom tried to get her attention as well, but were also unsuccessful. A few minutes later, another busboy came by our table and we asked him to please tell the waitress to take our dessert orders. He said ok, but walked in a different direction. After more waving fifteen minutes later our waitress arrived * Halleluiah! * and asked us if we were waving at her! HAHA! We told her we wanted some tea and coffee. She took our orders and proceeded to walk away without offering us any dessert. Great. She brought out our teas but the cups and plates were all wet. Yuck. \n\nI will definitely not be coming back here for a long time. \n\nOh I also have to mention that as we were leaving we walked by the front window of the restaurant. There were these two ladies with their two entrees on a two person table with their bread and bread plates there as well... AND they had their appetizers ON THEIR LAPS!!! Well actually, one had one empty plate on her lap and the other one had her half finished appetizer. LOL!! Are you f*cking kidding me?!? I wish I had taken a picture.", "author": "Andrea G."}

I was lucky enough to get a small table to myself, tucked away from most of the happy couples and college kids. I came here for the cioppino...which I've ordered on many occasions in the past...ah, the past...\n...the past - when, in happier times, I use to come here more often with my ex...and sometimes with Big Frank, his father, who was like a big scary Mob dude.  A lot of the employees knew him, and seemed to cater to his every whim.  Big Frank could usually drink two carafes of table wine by himself. He was a big fan of their  'The Godfather Dinner' ...he could put most of the food away by himself, nevermind the fact that it was to be shared by 5 - 6 people.

As a family, we have a long history of eating great Italian food in the City and this restaurant did not measure up in multiple areas.  Union Square location or not, their food is overpriced (pasta over $22 and Chicken Marsala for $24).  The mashed potatoes did not taste real and their ingredients are quite inexpensive and nothing special.  The bruschetta toasts were soggy due to the pile of canned diced tomatoes on the plate.  Since they operate on a system in which multiple servers bring food to each table, our salads arrived before our drinks and appetizer.   If you are from out of town and not familiar with quality Italian cuisine in the City, this restaurant might satisfy.  If you are looking for a traditional SF experience of rich flavors, white tablecloths and crusty fresh sourdough, you will be disappointed.  I would characterize this restaurant as a tourist spot which can survive because of location and a great deal of foot traffic.  It is unlikely that this restaurant could attract \"regulars\" who are locals.", "author": "Lindsay P."}

Went there for Happy Hour on a Friday night (btw, the \"happy hour\" is only on drinks, those bar food prices that you're seeing are available at all times...had I known that, I probably would not have come here since I was mainly looking for a place w/ happy hour food specials)...it was crowded but not the point where we couldn't find anywhere to sit eventually.  Like ppl have said, service is subpar here as they really seem to not really care much about their customers.  We ordered the calamari, cheese plate, sausage pizza, truffle fries, and breaded raviolis and I tried hard to enjoy everything since I picked the place for the 6 of us but it was difficult.  The calamari was good but really small.  I found it to be a little overcooked but the aioli made up for it.  The cheese plate was pretty useless.  There are two crostininininis (emphasis on how small they were) with like half a thumb-sized wedge of 3 different cheeses and none of them stood out to me.  Sausage pizza was ok, didn't expect much there...Truffle fries taste like regular fries.  Maybe my palette is not refined enough but every single person tried both regular fries and the truffle ones and we couldn't really tell the difference...also small portion and yes, I realize that I paid $4-$5 for it but it was still small.  Finally, the breaded raviolis were mediocre.  They were about as good as something I could buy frozen.  2 stars all around and I won't be back.", "author": "Derrick C."}

It was busy, but not crowded, just the right amount of energy in the bar.  Our server was friendly and chatty.  Though the bar was definitely slammed and drinks were a little slow to arrive to our table... next time will have to remember to order multiple rounds at once.", "author": "Frances L."}

On my last trip to SF, I stopped by with a group of 7 for an early dinner which was about 5:30.  The bar area was packed during happy hour.  Since we had a party of 7, we had to wait a few minutes for them to set up our table, my friends and I bought a drink and took it to our dinner table once it was ready.  The waitress came up to the table and said bringing drinks back to the table was not allowed.  A - O - K...we'll take our drinks to the side walk next time (as there was NO space at the bar/area whatsoever.  Anyhow - the food just wasn't the same...felt like it was totally over priced for the quality received.  Thumbs down on the service and thumbs down on the food this time.  What a bummer.  Sorry - P&P just lost my business and all the groups of people I bring to this place.  Please tell the waitress with the tattoo on her chin to be nicer.  OMG - she was SO rude.  She gave us daggers at every request.  I mean, c'mon - if we order appetizers - do we really have to ask for plates?  Do we really need to ask for bread and butter??? Plenty of other restaurants around in nicer areas - sorry.", "author": "C L."}

I would definitely recommend not having the Cioppino or the lamb chops. hindsight is 20/20, and only a stronger screwdriver would have made those bad tastes go away.", "author": "Patrick M."}

I thought for the price I'd be getting something super good, but I guess it's only cause it's in downtown. The service was alright. She gave us everything we needed and was pretty efficient, but she was spacey and more concerned with getting things done so she could chat up with her friends at the bar asap (we were sitting next to the bar so of course it was a little awkward). I'd say go here for happy hour if you're in that location. Definately not worth going out of your way for, but the happy hour is a good deal.", "author": "Haim C."}

We have been going here for a few years now.  The place has this really warm feel to it and the  food and service were always good if not excellent . I have always liked their nacho cheese and  hamburgers.  Although there were a lot of people, the place wasn't necessarily packed so were were seated right away for a table for 4.  There were also a lot of people in the bar area.  Last night, the service was terrible, it took about 15 minutes for the waitress to even come and ask us what we wanted.  We ordered several appetizers and a bottle of wine to share and the fwine and food came quickly after, which was good since we were all starving.  But the nachos were slightly burnt and not as I had before as golden brown.  The bruschetta looked overly soaked in  oil (hopefully olive oil)... so I didn't even touch it.  The burnt nachos were also hardly eaten, what a disappointment.  The hamburger and fries filled me up, but the bread was a little stale.  Going back to the service, we had to keep \"waving to our waitress\" just to catch her attention.  The waitress and the busboys were  totally spaced out.   And judging from the food, the cook was probably not having a good day too. Overall last night the food and service rated a one-star for me, maybe this was just a bad night but I don't think I'll be going  there again in a very long time.", "author": "Tess G."}

I love working here.. the employees make the place and our mission statement and ideals are right on the mark. We strive for excellance all the time but a reservation definitley helps on a Fri or saturday night when it gets crazy (because people like us:D). I have never worked in a place that works so hard to personalize things for their guests. There are a ton of Italian places to eat in North beach but I have not found them to be as friendly or customer service oriented as we are. We are also in the heart of downtown and no one will cat call you to come inside(as in NB)..ladies.. Plus, for those of you that work near by the powell/market area, we provide a neighbor discount during lunch and have a great lunch club where you earn free meals. I work lunches.

They have several tasty wines by the glass for around $8 and delicious menu items for under $20.  The hostess was delightful and our waitress had lots to say about the various dishes which was really informative.  They even brought us a sample of the appetizer special which was a cheesy risotto-like ball that had been fried and topped with marinara sauce and parmesan (mmmm).  Between that and the fabulous bread that comes with olive oil, peppers, and capers, I was almost too full to eat but managed to share a couple things with others.
