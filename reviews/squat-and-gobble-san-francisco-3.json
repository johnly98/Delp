The roommate wasn't, but he likes feeding me, so we decided to order breakfast on Sunday, July 23rd at 11:53am from Squat & Gobble. Our brunch delivery order arrived via DoorDash at 12:57pm. We live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Breakfast Burrito: Eggs, chorizo, onions, peppers, avocado, pepper jack cheese, ranchero & green tomatillo sauce, Mexican salsa, served over black bean chili & topped with crispy tortilla strips, no jalape\u00f1o sour cream ($12.95)\n*Milan Scramble: Italian sausage, spinach, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes & parmesan cheese, topped with pesto sauce, Served over potatoes with your choice of toast ($12.95), Everything Bagel with Cream Cheese (+$1)\n*Mini Pancakes: Five silver dollar pancakes, strawberries, powdered sugar & whipped cream ($6.95)\n*French Toast Fingers: Strips of French toast, strawberries, powdered sugar & whipped cream ($6.95)\n\nI actually really liked my scramble. All the ingredients melded together really well. I'm not the biggest potato person, so I was a little disappointed when I saw there were so many potatoes. It was hard avoiding them. The most disappointing thing was the bagel I paid extra for. They ended up giving me a plain bagel instead of an everything bagel. I don't really like plain bagels, so I wouldn't have ordered it if I knew that was the case. Not sure who's fault it was, but I told DoorDash and they never really got back to me.\n\nThe roommate enjoyed his breakfast burrito. I had a bite of his chorizo and it was tasty. I liked the kid sized french toast and pancakes. It was perfect for sharing between the two of us. The french toast pieces weren't exactly sticks, but you could peel them apart into sticks. The whipped cream in both dishes did suffer from transport as they more or less melted.\n\nGood place to grab breakfast delivery.

I ordered for a party of four, but only three orders were delivered to the table.  When I inquired as to the fourth order, I was told by the cashier that I only ordered three items (this argument pissed me off since I would never have short ordered my lunch party, and surmised the mistake was due to the cashier talking to his co-worker during the entire time I was ordering.  Yet, he still BLAMED ME for the mistake).  \n\nI submitted an order for eggs benedict and our entire party waited until the fourth order arrived (food obviously getting cold).  However, what arrived was eggs Florentine. I complained again, and the cashier's response was \"that's what you ordered\".  When I emphatically told him it was NOT what I ordered, he responded with \"so what do you want me to do about it\".  I was stunned at the horrifically rude treatment we all experienced.  I left without any apology, and paid about $75 for the ruined brunch trip.  I later called and emailed the owner, but one week later, have still not received a reply.

It got a little warm while we were sitting out there, and we moved around to stay in the shade as much as possible. One of the servers came over and asked us if it was too hot and then pushed a button to extend the covering above us. That was a really nice gesture! I'm glad that they had the covering - it really cooled it down for us. I felt like I was in some little European village in the patio. There was a nice little fountain running on the side and they played soothing music in the background. \n\nFor 3 people, the bill came out to about $45 with a lemonade. Pretty average for the area. The Marina is a very nice area of San Francisco and there's free parking on the streets adjacent to Chestnut on the weekends. \n\n Glad we came across this place!", "author": "Andrew P."}

We had one goal: brunch.\n\nO. M. G. I never say OMG, so that is saying a lot. This place had me immediately at the word \"crepery.\" Let that sink in: CREPERY. In this bright and open restaurant, you order your food at the counter and they bring it to your table. I doubt I will ever, anywhere find a place with such personable and fast brunch service. From the time we sat down to eat, it had maybe been 10 minutes. The restaurant is bistro style, with plenty of natural sunlight, indoor seating and an outdoor patio.\n\nThe crab cake florentine is a dreamy, creamy plate of brunch goodness. The hollandaise is so rich and bold, that when combined with the juicy crab cakes, literally melts in your mouth. The portion sizes were incredibly generous, and while the prices were a bit higher, they are completely justified. We also split a strawberry nutella crepe, which was served with fresh whipped cream. The crepe is as big as the plate, so be prepared to fall in love.\n\nI will be dreaming about this brunch all the way back to Cleveland!", "author": "Lauren K."}

It's definitely a poppin' spot as all tables were filled and there was a line to order food. The wait wasn't long, and by the time we ordered our food we only waited a few minutes before some kind souls offered their table. Indoor and streetside seating available! The restaurant opened out all its windows so it had an open-air vibe. Only downside was that some of the outdoor seating areas did not have an umbrella or some way to provide shade.\n\nThey have a lot of options to choose from, but I ultimately choose the bourban omelette and a lemonade. The lemonade was on the lighter side, which I liked since it didn't feel sickly concentrated.\n\nThe omelette now... let me tell you now that they don't skimp on food. I knew they were generous as I saw the size of the steak salad that was brought out for another customer. I am a big eater, and I typically eat until I'm stuffed up to the neck. I couldn't finish my food though, as delicious as it was. I struggled to eat half of the omelette, and the potatoes - as bomb as they were, I barely finished. Maybe it was the grossly hot and humid weather that messed up my appetite. \n\nThe omelette was stuffed, and almost the size of two fists. The potatoes were seasoned really well, to the point where I didn't need my usual ketchup and tapatio. \n\nI would come here again to challenge the omelette.

It was so delicious the first time, I had to order it again a second time.

I was probably better off with more veggies than noodle carbs, but I was disappointed about the missing shrimp. Broth was consistent to the prior order and I still enjoyed the dish. So not deal breaker. I look forward to returning to order this a third time. \n\nOh, I should mention that this restaurant does not have a liquor license so we couldn't enjoy margaritas.

Today it was cold inside - they didn't cook it enough time to heat up the ingredients. \n- My wife ordered a Mexican dish with side of fruit however they brought potatoes instead\n- we ordered Teriaky chicken for my son.

You always hear this from older people about restaurants that used to be great ect. At one time I considered this the best breakfast in sf. The last few times I see them getting cheaper and cheaper and cutting corners more and more. The last time was the last straw. They don't slice green and red peppers anymore their perfectly cubed from a can like dennys. The amazing fresh squeezed orange juice they used to have from hasn't been around in a year they used to have small dark orange Cali oranges now they don't even have the machine running. They have it \"already squeezed\" when you come in and it's yellow and watered down very acidic obviously cheap Florida oranges!? The aqua Panna Italian water no more now they have the cheapest plastic bottled water from a local wholesaler. The French toast and pancakes come out without butter and if you ask they brink little individual butter packets that are cold so you can't spread it instead of spreadable butter in a suace container from the kitchen like any good restaurant. The English muffins are burnt on one side and raw on the other have had to send them back multiple times. This sucks because like I said this place was amazing hopefully the owner sees what is happening here and puts a stop to it before it's too late because this place now is the same as eating at the hotel or dennys.", "author": "Mike S."}

Don't think English is the first language of some of the staff because each time they would deliver a different Asian-style dish that wasn't chicken stir fry (like Kung Pao chicken), each time I would re-explain what I actually ordered, and each time I would get a bad attitude from the person delivering the (wrong) dish. I was even accused of changing my order three times!  Right, I love waiting 3 times as long to get my food after watching my friends completely finish their meals--it brings me such joy to starve myself by changing my order 3 times in a row. Great customer service, guys.\n\nSaddest part was that the manager was the one who originally took my order and he also never bothered to come over to my table when I directly asked to speak with him after this comedy of errors. He was apparently \"on break\" for 45 minutes despite awkwardly sitting 15 feet from us at a different table, avoiding eye contact. It was very weird. Maybe he was too embarrassed to at least apologize? It's fine, my friends and I won't spend our money here any more.

They all ordered similar menu items as each other and I ordered something very different. Their food was served to them the second they sat down and my meal ended up coming out much later. In minutes, they were finished eating and to my understanding, in a hurry to leave town for plans in Marin. So I asked some of their staff members if I could get refunded for my food because I couldn't eat with my friends by the time my food arrived.\n\nThe man who I believe was the manager, as well as their cashier Makayla were extremely helpful to me and didn't guilt me out about my cancelled order. They refunded me and I went on my merry way.\n\nMy friends enjoyed their food and my food coming out later than there's was just a case of us not having all our food in the same order like a regular sit-down restaurant.

I only found out about the back patio when they asked  me where I would be seated when I placed my order. I saw the patio's exit after I ate and it looked very nice. Probably would sit in the back next time since my friend had to sit in the front to watch his bike.\n\nSo I was here for brunch on Memorial Day since it was the last day of the Mark di Suvero Exhibit in Crissy Fields.

They have the orange juice machine right behind the cashier so you could see the oranges beings squeezed of it's yummy juices. They were sweet as well so even though it was $4 for a cup of OJ (a tad pricey but you're in the Marina), it was worth it on a warm sunny day. For the mimosa, since they use the same fresh OJ, you could barely taste the champagne (which is how I like it but also dangerous because you'd keep drinking them!).\n\nI hadn't eaten in about a day, so I didn't feel so guilty eating my Crab Cake Florentine. It was definitely very rich and filling with all the starch but oh so good! The eggs were cooked perfectly and the spinach soft. The Hollandaise wasn't too tart but creamy. The English muffin was toasted just enough and easy to cut apart (generally a pet-peeve of mine when I have difficulties cutting into my English muffins). The Rosemary Garlic Potatoes had crispy skin and soft potatoes on the inside. Lots of rosemary (which I liked) but hardly tasted any garlic (bummer because I'm a huge garlic fan as well!).\n\nMy friend had the Marina which he greatly enjoyed after a long morning of biking around the bay. Though he did mention the crepe was a bit on the thick side he was starving so didn't care too much. Oh and if you don't like olives, be forewarned, they put a lot in it (but I love olives so that's a plus for me!). \n\nService is barely there as they just drop off the food.

The staff (but most especially-- Cas!) were wonderful to my family and me.  My cousins were in town from Chicago and we decided to have a little mini-reunion.  Gathering 12 people and getting them to agree on a brunch spot is hard, but with Squat & Gobble it became super easy.  \n\nI loved their streamlined process.  Take a peek at the menu, order at the register, and Cas (to the rescue!) set us up with a great table in the patio area.  After perusing yelp and their online menu, I was pretty sure I knew what I wanted.  I ordered the Crab Cake Florentine (basically a crab cake benedict with spinach) and a mimosa.. Yum!  \n\nThe patio was gorgeous--so homey and with beautiful sunshine and a little SF chill.  Its heated and has a roof (if necessary) so need to worry about rain or what not.  The wonderful staff brought out all of our food, drinks, and utensils and we just dug in.  My crab cake florentine was WONDERFUL.  I loved the Hollandaise sauce and the crab cakes just melted in your mouth.  They were served with a side of house potatoes (which I requested to be extra crispy!) which were super yum.  My mimosa was the perfect treat for brunch.   Our water was consistently refilled and Cas himself came out to check on us repeatedly.  Again--wonderful service!\n\nMy only real qualm was with the food size.  Once I saw the crepes on the menu (and my cousin-in-law ordered the berry nutella crepe), I was craving one badly.

Maybe it was just my experience I'm not sure, but my cousin and I finally got our food when my sister and her boyfriend were already half way eating there. Usually in this situation, my cousin and I felt as if we had to rush eating our food since my sister and her boyfriend would soon be done eating there's. Another note, we didn't get our food until we had to ask them about it twice. Hence, the drop in 1 star.\n\nSquat & Gobble has a variety of great food -- wonderful place for brunch (crepes, omelettes, eggs, breakfast specials, salads, sandwiches, pasta, and others). You just go up to the cashier and order, they give you a number, and you find seating for yourself and your party (extra seating available in the back patio).\n\nMy cousin and I both ordered the same dish - CHICKEN PESTO CREPE (sliced chicken breast, mozzarella, onions, pesto and sun-dried tomatoes). The crepes are served with choice of rosemary garlic potatoes or mixed baby green salad. We both chose the ROSEMARY GARLIC POTATOES.\n\nThe CHICKEN PESTO CREPE was absolutely amazing. It was gush full of strong flavors (especially from the sun-dried tomatoes, which were a good size and not small). The cheese was fully melted which is a must for me whenever there's cheese and it's a hot dish. The ROSEMARY GARLIC POTATOES were cubed and still had their skin on. They were very crunchy at the edges and soft when bitten into. The spicing was perfect and really helped bring out the potatoes. If you ever were given the choice of having these potatoes or mixed baby green salad, choose the rosemary garlic potatoes. They're more carbs, but you can get mixed baby green salads anywhere. \n\nMy sister and her boyfriend got CRAB CAKE FLORENTINE (Two crab cakes, two poached eggs & saut\u00e9ed spinach on an English muffin topped with hollandaise sauce. Served with potatoes or fresh fruit) and a BREAKFAST BURRITO. I didn't have a taste of them, but I did get pictures (in the Photo section) and the dishes were gorgeously done with a variety of pretty colors and what not. \n\nWouldn't mind coming back and trying something new.

I usually try to give stores, restaurants and service the benefit of the doubt because things do happen and sometimes it's really beyond their control but in this case.. absolutely not.\n\nMaybe I just have high expectations.. but when it comes to food, is that really a bad thing?\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity to find parking on a busy Sunday morning, we decided to get brunch before strolling around. The menu is huge and easy to read, detailing exactly what you were going to get and sounded delicious. I immediately noticed that this place is open seating and you have to get your own table. They give you a number and you can sit wherever is free. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes of waiting in line to place our food orders, we were finally next and the line stopped moving. They were apparently too backed up or having some sort of computer issue where the orders couldnt be processed properly. Given there were 2 registers, it made no sense that it was not in use since the line had increased to almost out the door. instead, one of the servers was standing there counting the same stack of cash... starting over and over every so often..Use a calculator if you can't add. -___-\n\nWe ordered the Fillmore Omelette, Prime Rib Melt and Mimosas. Up to this point, everything I just brushed off but now is when it gets ridiculous. The couple who had sat down next to us, was actually behind me in line. Not only did they get their food first, which looked more complicated to make. They were finished before we even got our food. It DOES NOT take 30 minutes to make an omelette and a sandwich. Especially since the tables around us also had ordered sandwiches. I had to request that a server check on our order multiple times before our food was finally brought out.\n\nTo add to my disappointment, the food was subpar. Given the wait time, I would've expected something tasty. My boyfriend makes better food than they do and I wouldn't have to pay him $30 for the meal. The fruit wasn't ripe and my omelette was mediocre. His Prime Rib Melt tasted more like a Grilled Cheese Sandwich with onions. I was surprised the food wasn't cold. As you sit and wait, you see all the servers wandering aimlessly all over the restaurant looking for the order numbers with no luck. We saw them walked around the restaurant and to the patio three times with the same set of food. On a misty rainy day.. that's just gross. \n\nThe only perk was that the mimosa was made with fresh squeezed orange juice. And the servers are nice.. slow but nice. Can't completely blame them on how inefficient the restaurant set up is.

Squat and Gobble is no exception.  The pahd thai was a complete disappointment, it was watery and lacked the proper balance of hot, sour and sweet that is normally the jewel of this dish plus the noodles were more in the line for pahd prik king being very wide and overdone. They also dump an inordinate amount of tofu to pad out the plate with only a slight smattering of peanuts. The sauce that makes this dish was so soupy most of it failed to stick to the noodles.    The south of the border omelette was terrible. Basically a thick black bean stew spiced with cumin, oregano, chili powder, bay leaf, powered garlic and other assorted spices that was also exceedingly unbalanced. There was no chorizo and the beans clashed with an avocado crema like sauce that gave the overall dish a decidedly bitter taste. The accompanying potatoes were almost burned and over salted.

I appreciated the thought though.\n\nPesto Chicken Crepe with Potatoes\n- the whole dish was very plain tasting considering it was pesto\n- the chicken breast was juicy even though it is supposedly grilled - which surprised me - very impressive if they really grilled it. good portions too\n- crepe was thicker skinned than crepevine\n- cheese was melty\n- sun dried tomatoes could have more of a kick to it, because they were not as tangy as i had hoped\n- potoatoes were fried and crispy on the outside, would have gone perfect with some ketchup if remembered to ask.\n\nOverall, a perfectly a-ok place to get some food.  it is not bad at all!  but it's not too amazing either.  I still prefer crepevine to squat and gobble and I probably will be exploring the area more and trying out different places before i come back here.", "author": "Tina A."}

I came thirsty and I sipped up my water quickly and then a busser did not come around with a pitcher for a bit. Sure, the pitcher had lemons in it and it was super hip, but I still don't appreciate having to wait that long.\n\nIt should also be noted that lots of attractive people dined here while my friend and I were here. It can be seen as a detriment if you find yourself intimidated around pretty people (especially when gobbling) but I felt like it was cool and it made me feel cool for being here, like I was in some hot people who like good food club.\n\nIt's a really cute ambiance, but it's very loud on Sunday mornings.

Surprisingly, my friends and I found this place quite charming.  There are large blackboards on the left side of the restaurant that holds the menu..  The tables are festive with those Thanksgiving like centerpieces.  There were only 2 larger tables for bigger groups (8) like mine and the rest were 4 or smaller.\n\nAs for the food, Everything was fine by my book.  I ordered eggs benedict, but with sausage.  I thought it would be porky and delicious, but it was healthy (the opposite of what I wanted).  That was my fault. i should have asked what kind of sausage they would use.  It came with roasted potatoes with fragrant rosemary.  Good meal overall.  \n\nThe rest of my group had crepes.  We could agree to call them really thin pancakes.  They all enjoyed their \"pancakes,\" whether it was the savory or sweet.  I was lucky to try a sweet one with chocolate, whip cream, and strawberries.  Delicious.  I found S&G through yelp.  I was far from disappointed, but I would give them a 3 stars. Breakfast was good, but not top notch.  \n\nOn a side note, my friends and I had a wager that if the waiter didn't come back within 30 seconds to refill my water, I would give S&G a 3.

I asked for a refund and they said they couldn't find my order. Every time I asked about my food, they said it was coming. Not once did I get an apology about having to wait 40 minutes for my food.

The crabcake was decent but nothing to drool over. The potatoes were half cold like half of it was sitting under a heating lamp and the other half not.

My B.F. ordered there Mexican grilled chicken salad.\n\nService was not spectacular. They give you a little number to put on our table when you order. It took a while to get our dish, my b.f. food came first which looked fantastic, presentation was great. My food finally arrived  which seemed to be about 10 minute s later. Though despite the aggravating wait and mediocre service, my crepe was fantastic!!!Crepe was cooked perfect- light, soft and fluffy, sausage, mozzerella cheese, olives,and  spin age all came together wonderfully (could have used a little more flavor) though it was overall very satisfying and filling. The Fruit which was a mix of Honeydew, Cantalope, Green Apples and big plump juicy grapes Fruit absolutely popped with flavor and complemented my meaty tasty crepe perfectly.\n\nService not so good, Food tasteful and satisfying.

A few months ago I stopped in after the gym because a crepe with nutella sounded good and I discovered they actually have a pretty extensive menu with several salads, pastas, sandwiches, and of course several varieties of crepes. \n\nI got my nutella crepe to go (which was okay, but I don't think crepes to go is a good option...they should be eaten fresh), but I was curious to come back. \n\nWell, I came back this this past weekend with friends and really liked it! I will say though, I didn't really try anything all that new this time. I had a strawberry nutella crepe, which was yummy! The strawberries tasted fresh, and the crepe was hot. There crepes are a little thick, which I actually like (I'm no crepe expert, but apparently if you are, I guess thinner is better?). The reason I got a dessert style crepe is I'm generally not a fan of savory crepes (don't know why but I never have). However, one of my friends had whatever the Mexican style crepe was, and I had a few bites. It was really good, and something I'd get when I come back! \n\nI also like that this place has some really interesting drink options. I went with a standard mimosa this last time that was really good, but I also noticed that had a pomegranate mimosa as well as a mango martini (or maybe that was a mimosa as well...I forget)! \n\nAs far as service goes this is one of those places where you order at the counter, they give you a number, and then bring you your food. We didn't have to wait long for our food and drinks and the place was pretty crowded. Both times I've been here all the employees have been super nice (the first time I came here for the to-go order, one of the workers practically insisted I sit down and brought me water while I waited!).

I used to work across the street from the S&G on Haight and would get breakfast there frequently. I most certainly don't remember it being anything as nice-looking as the one on Chestnut is.\n\nOf course, this was 12 years ago when I lived in SF, and this is the Marina location and not the Haight one. So yeah, maybe it's just perception, but I sure feel like S&G has fancied up a bit over the years -- and their prices have gone up accordingly.\n\nAll that aside, it's a great place for breakfast/brunch. A menagerie of savory & sweet crepes, and all the usual breakfast staples. I appreciate that after all these years, my basic crepe, easy onions, with bacon & a side of rosemary potatoes is just as tasty as the first time I had it.\n\nAs noted, it is a tad on the spendier side -- around $10 or so a person -- but hardly out of character for the Marina. And as you'd expect in the Marina, lots of folks in their running gear (who don't look like they've been running), lots of folks and their kids, and not so many of the hipsters you'd expect at the Haight or Castro locations.

So I voted with my feet and decided not to come back. \n\nWell I've been there three out of the last four Sunday mornings and the food has been tremendous.  The service is still slow,  IMHO due to the fact that they have a complicated menu on a large blackboard, and everyone stands in line and places their order one at a time at the register.  And, the software used by the POS terminal is painfully slow since it appears to be a serial process and requires the order taker to put some things in a particular order.  I don't see this changing to much, but they should find a way to make this better.\n\nNext, pet peeve time:  I hate getting coffee with (a) a spoon in the cup, or (b) the spoon outside of the cup but with nowhere to set it except the tabletop.  At least put napkin holders on the tables.\n\nBut, the food was tremendous.  End of story.  Five stars.

The place wasn't really too crowded at the exact time of the midday, but parking in the Marina was a nightmare, even with his work car. He had a large bowl of the Vegetarian Black Bean Chili. The $4.75 large bowl of spicy Chili was very tasty and filling. \n\nMatt enjoyed the restaurant so much, he took the rest of the Fantastic-4 members for breakfast the next day, before Matt goes off work. (Yes, Matt actually works on Saturdays) A very surprising scene for a Saturday morning in the Marina; the restaurant was also not too crowded either and we were seated immediately. Matt ordered the Fillmore Omelette. The specialized Omelette, which contained shredded cheddar cheese, sliced ham, mushrooms, & bell-peppers, is very similar to a Denver Omelette you get at any breakfast joint. Matt's meal, which costs $8.95, also had a Rosemary-Garlic Potatoes and a toasted plain Bagel. There are 5 specialized omelettes at this place, and each of them have locations of each Squats and Gobbles named after their omelettes. Matt and wife also ordered a endless cup of needed coffee. \n\nWife, who was hungry, ordered the Crab-Cake Florentine. The $9.25 meal had 2 crab cakes, 2 poached eggs on a English-Muffin smothered with a creamy, but salty Hollandaise Sauce on top and the same roasted spuds on the side. Her meal was very tasty, but needed to drink a lot of water after the sauce. The kids order OJ ($2.50),split a bowl of Granola w/yogurt and a Bagel and Cream Cheese. The $5.00 granola was very fresh and crunchy, and complimented well with the yogurt. It was so crunchy that most of the patrons can hear them crunch loudly from their mouths. The $2.00 Bagel w/ Cream Cheese was nothing too special, but just a plain toasted bagel with cream cheese. \n\nOur meal was good. In the future, we would like to check out other items .i.e. specialized crepes at this restaurants and visit the other locations. Sadly, Matt's time with family was brief, because he has to go to work.", "author": "Matt G."}

Maybe I am just used to brunch places in Sacramento that allow you to have a glass of water while you wait for your table. I went to the Squat & Gobble after the Men's Health Urbanathlon. My party went up to the counter, placed our order, and went to the patio entrance, where we were told that we would have to wait for a table. Next to the patio entrance, we noticed that there was a huge water station with dozens of glasses of ice water. We also saw that a couple people who were also waiting to be seated had glasses of water. So we assumed that it would be no problem grabbing a glass of water to drink while we waited to be seated. We were wrong. Well, two members of our party of five had good timing and grabbed a glass of water without being detected. But when I went up to the water station and grabbed a glass of water, a busboy grabbed my arm and removed the glass from my hand. I said that we were waiting for a table on the patio and wanted a glass of water while we waited. The busboy said no. Water would be brought to us after we were seated. Undeterred, I removed my arm from his grasp and picked up another glass of water. He grabbed my arm again. I said: \"Really? We can't have a glass of water while we wait to be seated?\" And as I was starting to explain that running 10 miles with obstacles makes a person thirsty and irritable, I found myself surrounded by two busboys and someone who appeared to be the manager, all of whom were telling me to \"put the water down\" like it was a weapon. I believe I said something like: \"All I want is some f*#@ing water while we wait for our table.\" I had other things to say, but the manager-looking man kept interrupting me with: \"Sir, please. Sir. Sir. Sir, please. Sir. Sir. Let go of the water. Sir. Please, sir. Sir, please. Sir. Put the water down. Sir. Thank you. Sir. Sir. Put the water down.\" Meanwhile, the busboy was still holding my arm. At this point, the incident had become so funny that I started laughing, put the water down, and returned to the patio entrance to wait for the table. As promised, water was brought to our table when we sat down. But why not let us have a drink of water during our 20-minute wait? The whole thing seemed ridiculous. \n\nAside from the water incident, the food was good, not extraordinary, but good. My coffee was great, but it took way too long to get a refill. We were seated next to a service station with a coffee pot. I considered refilling my cup on my own, but after what happened with the water, I decided against it.", "author": "Nicholas M."}

My husband and I came here for Sunday brunch on our anniversary weekend, as I recognized the name from having been here with a friend in the past. \n\nWhen we walked in, we were greeted by a wall of noise and a line to order that was almost to the door. The line was moving fast though, so we assumed that the food would be too. Boy, were we wrong. It took fifteen minutes for me to get my iced tea, and then only after asking for it twice. Our food took another 40 minutes to arrive, and then only after asking about that, too. \n\nWhen it did arrive, my salmon salad was dry and lukewarm, while my husband's omelet was warm and fresh. Very clearly they'd forgotten our order until the waitress asked about it, then quickly made the omelet and sent both out. No apologies were made for the tardiness of the food, and when we ordered a mimosa to calm my very hungry and annoyed nerves, they didn't offer to comp it. \n\nAll of this would have been fine except we were sitting in a room so noisy and crowded we couldn't hear each other talking.

Anyways, it's got a decent ambiance, casual setting, and is quick. As it's strengths are dessert crepes and purportedly, breakfast (omelettes and crepes), my friend and I came in for a Sunday brunch to recover from the weekend. It's one of those joints where you order at the counter and then self-seat, and they bring your food to you. The service was really okay, and no one really checks on you, but delivers your food. They are nice, just not overtly service-friendly. \n\nFirst of all, portion size is HUGE! I had enough left over from breakfast fro at least two more subsequent days. My friend had the Marina crepe (Cheddar, onions, pesto, eggplant, Feta, olives, red peppers, artichokes and tomatoes) which was okay,  but nothing to write home about. I had the South of the Border omelette (Jack cheese, black bean chili and avocado topped with salsa and sour cream) which had WAY too much egg. My mistake was to not order egg whites, because there was so much egg, I was full within the first 4 bites. I was saving my stomach for the strawberry nutella dessert crepe, anyways! \n\nPoint of clarification - there is a regular \"nutella chocolate\" crepe, a \"strawberry nutella\" crepe and a \"fresh strawberry\" crepe. If you are desiring of a nutella crepe with fresh strawberries, which would you order?? If you said \"strawberry nutella\" you are correct. It comes with smatterings of nutella (yum!) and fresh strawberries baked within. I'm sure we thoroughly confused the girl at the counter... and the freshly squeezed OJ??? Is it just me, or are oranges not in season?? They have a juicer which is viewable at the counter, but the oranges were so bitter...

We found out this place was near-by and decided to give it a try based on the name alone!  I couldn't be happier!  I ordered a cappichino and the banana-chocolate-walnut crepe and my BF got the rueben with roasted potatoes and a caffe mocha.  We decided to sit in the back patio since it was so nice out.  The patio area is gorgeous and I highly recommend sitting out there if it is remotely a nice day.  My crepe was fan-tas-tic.  It was cooked to perfection with some extra crispy sugary pieces.  I got it with vanilla bean ice cream and it came with a huge dollap of real whipped cream and the combination of it all was too good for words.  Only one thing I had topped my crepe and that was the potatoes.  Oh. my. lord.  Those potatoes are some of the best things I have put in my mouth.  Rosemary, thyme and garlic and again, they were cooked to perfection having just the right amount of crispiness on the them.  I have nothing bad to say about this place.

So I finally stopped in.\n\nThe service is fast casual and the menu is written on a chalkboard above the line. I like this homey and casual touch. It's a neighborhood place after all. The service was polite and they were accommodating as I remember seeing a tiny server moving a large table from one end of the dining room to the other after accommodating a larger party. The food, however, is lacking a little bit. Mostly due to seasoning. Wll, lack thereof. I ordered a breakfast burrito with chorizo and my girlfriend had the veggie bendict sans hollandaise. \n\nThe burrito seemed uneven in distribution of stuff. For me, when I have chorizo, I love the oil. The greasy, spicy, garlic that oozes into everything is the reason I love chorizo. I would use it for salad dressing and to make puff pastry for savory treats is I could ever stop sopping it up with warm tortillas and my fingertips. Sadly, for me, the burrito did not have this sexy oil. It was bland and egg heavy. I get it, it's a breakie burrito. Eggs are the main ingredient. But not my taste.\n\nThe veggie bennie (spinach florentine) was fine. For me I liked that they used bloomsdale spinach instead of baby. It has more flavor and the heartier stems give it some character. I know that my chefs all wanted me to pick off the stems since they're \"inedible,\" but screw it. I think they're lovely.

When we had one more guest arrive, his food took FOREVER to come.  We were all finished with our food and had to sit and wait.    I noticed several other tables waiting for a long time looking bored.  \n\nWhen the food finally came, it was good.  My cobb salad was really tasty with chunks of avocado and egg and there was plenty of food to split on one plate.  A side salad was good enough for people who were not extremely hungry.  I have eaten their crepes before and I like those as well.\n\nIronically, when I turned on the TV a day later, Jay Leno was doing his Headlines and when he came across a sign that said \"Squat and Gobble,\" he laughed hysterically.  I didn't laugh as hard as he did.  Hey, it's a local place.  We're used to the name.", "author": "Stacey C."}

It used to be a place where local professionals could eat, work and hang all day  -- and invite people to meet them, work, and then share meals. SnG had a cafe culture all its own. It supported nomadic workers and local software developers. Simply: was a nice clean professional place to get shit done. \n\nNow it's a pricey omelette at $10, given the other close by options.

After signing our lease on our new flat in the Richmond District, we decided to do some noshing. A couple of weeks ago, after biking from downtown to the Golden Gate, my husband popped in here. So, he decided let's eat here again.\n\nCute place. Yeah, you order at the counter then it is sorta full-service. My hubby ordered the blueberry pancakes, scrambled eggs and the chicken/apple sausage (same thing he had last time). I decided to have a more traditional dinner, for $19.99 you get an app, entree, and a glass of wine.\n\nWhat was cool, is that they had quite a few choices for all 3 options. So, I decided on the soup of the day (tomato bread); the half chicken, mashers w/ mushroom wine gravy and the squash; and a glass of sauvignon blanc. The soup was quite tasty and rich. Not real sweet and nice spice to it. However, there were a few stems from the herbs which was odd.\n\nChicken was nicely seasoned, but a little overcooked and the bones broke a bit too easily. Mushroom gravy was nice, 'taters were good, but tasted like they had Gorgonzola in them (not a huge fan of the latter). The squash was nicely done, but I don't like squash much, unless it is grilled.\n\nHubby's pancakes were tasty and the sausage is nice (as long as you are not hoping for traditional breakfast pork links). \n\nWhat was most impressive about this meal, the amount of food was huge. After the soup, I was not that hungry and only ate a small portion of entree (did the rest as take away... always fun taking leftovers on the BART back to Oakland).\n\nWe are used to Austin-area prices in Texas for food, and it's funny I cannot recall, in the 14 years that I have lived there, having a meal of this caliber (not super nice but decent) w/ a glass of wine for $20.

It was a good group, nice day, and everything was great until we realized 30 minutes had gone by and some of us were still waiting for beverages (long after the food had arrived). My friend had finished her entire meal and was still waiting on a soda. The waitress stopped by several times, as did the manager, and each time we were assured the soda was coming. It didn't. Even as tray after tray of drinks came for other tables....Finally, on the waitress's umpteenth visit, my friend said, \"Any chance I can get that soda finally? It's been 30 minutes and you keep saying it's coming...\" The waitress assured us her manager was bringing it, and we returned to our conversation. \n \nTwo minutes later the manager - mid thirties, dark hair, goatee, storms over (SANS SODA, I might add) and berates us for upsetting his server so much that she started to cry. He iniststed they were doing their best, and our rudeness was completely uncalled for. Um, what?? You are yelling at a group of customers for asking - not yelling, not swearing - for a drink they paid for and expected half an hour ago? My friend apologized for upsetting the server, but he kind of brushed it off and was standoffish for the rest of our visit, which wasn't long.\n \nWe were a mixed group of mostly girls in our mid twenties, and we are polite and friendly people with experience in the service industry.

Anyway, when I was there I tried the \"french toast indulgence\", which LOOKS amazing. I don't remember what exactly is in the filling, but I do remember something about Italian cream or something. Upon tasting it, everything was good EXCEPT the filling. I liked the first bite, but after that it just tasted like molasses, cinnamon, and cream cheese. Ew! All that for around just under $10? No thanks. My friends each got different things; one got pancakes that she was very happy with, and the other got a breakfast burrito that looked amazing! (it's on a special menu board right under what I got, and seems to have pretty much everything in it!) If I get the chance to come back, I would like to try the burrito....without chorizo, of course.\nMy friend who ordered the pancakes also got a Screwdriver (I'd like to mention that they squeeze their orange juice fresh, and everything that contains OJ has fresh-squeezed in it....definitely a plus) but this drink tasted like a floral perfume might taste. I've never had a screwdriver before, so idk if they all taste that way, but it was really nasty.\n\nIf you go, I recommend sitting on the covered (and heated!) patio. It's a nice atmosphere, takes you away from the crowded front area, and has vines and fountains and stuff. Even the little bathroom is neat, and has tile that looks like grass. \n\nI can't say I had a BAD experience, but I would certainly order something other than the french toast indulgence, as I had better stuffed french toast at IHOP.", "author": "Devin H."}

Very fresh, but it had cilantro in it and I'm not a fan of cilantro - so a bite was all I had. \n\nI ordered the eggs florentine and it comes with either a salad or potatoes. The eggs florentine was delish. Everything about it was just great. The runny egg, crispy English muffin, just the right amount of cheese (at least I think there was cheese) and lots of spinach.

I don't know if it really matters, but I had mentioned to the boy (my lunch time company) that the place looks like the breakfast area in a Days Inn or something. Although, the back patio was much nicer.\n\nThe food is fine, really. I might even go so far as to say it was good, but that's a stretch. Perhaps it's good in the same way sushi at the grocery store is good: it's not, really, but it seems appealing at the time. And after wards, you wonder if you should have gotten something else.\n\nI had a Greek salad, which was really a pile of rabbit food with some feta cheese and olives on top. Not awful or anything... I never said I DIDN'T like rabbit food, after all. But while standing in line, I joked to boy about ordering only a crouton, after listening to him bitch about the prices listed on the menu. But then, when my salad came, I was given a thin piece of focaccia bread about the size of a large crouton. No, I'm not exaggerating. Suddenly the crouton joke was a lot less funny after it actually sorta happened.\n\nAnyway I guess what really locks in the three star award is their prices. $8.50 for a mediocre pile of leaves, and although their omelets looked good (and were definitely more substantial than the salad) they were nearly $10. I can't say the food is bad, but I can accurately claim that it's overpriced.", "author": "Andrea B."}

I sure hope they can get by on the cafe part.\n\nLet me explain. To make a crepe - a real crepe - you don't slam all the fruit into it and throw the whole thing on the pan. That's exactly what the kitchen did to our crepes. They came out gross, tasteless and hideously soggy. The contents were basically massacred and all color and flavor cooked away. If S&G can't get a crepe right, they have no business calling themselves a crepery. (This is the part where I restrain myself between drawing a non-flattering linguistic parallel between the word \"crepery\" and my opinion about the food I was served on my visit.)\n\nI honestly have no idea why this place is getting the kind of ratings people are giving it. While the atmosphere is nice (albeit a bit of a place to be \"seen\"), the food simply isn't any good. If I was there on an off-day, that's one thing. I'll give S&G one more chance, but if it's anything even remotely like my first experience, I'll never return here again.

I was truly disappointed by my experience there when they first opened in 2007.  The food was heavy and the service was embarrassing.  I recall one time when one of the waiters sat down at a table near us and complained to his friend that he had just been fired.  AWK-WARD... Anyway, we moved to San Diego and that was that.\n\nFlash-forward eighteen months when we came back to SF for a visit with our son.  I wanted to give S&G another chance - I love crepes and maybe I was delusional before. Um, not so much.\n\nAgain, the service was embarassingly poor.  We waited 25 minutes for our crepes.  Our friends, who had ordered just minutes before us, had finished their dishes 10 minutes before ours even arrived.  \n\nOur three dishes (all crepes) arrived luke warm, and mine was wrong.  After taking a small bite, my husband sent it back to the ktichen stating that 1) it was wrong, and 2) it was cold. The same crepe returned to me with the appropriate topping splattered across the top.  I think they must have re-heated it in the microwave. Nice.\n\nSo, the service was bad, the kitchen staff were idiots, and to be honest, the food just wasn't that good. Their crepes are so heavy - hardly authentic of true crepe legacy.  \n\nIf you want real crepes, go to the little crepe cafe on Union Street.  They're delicious and lite, and the atmosphere is so much better.  \n\nIf you want a family-friendly restaurant in the Marina, go to Mel's, IHOP, or Johnny Rockets. The service, at least, is always good at those spots.", "author": "Love Z."}

I'm sure that the fact that I am not particularly religious added to the annoyance, but personal religious beliefs aside, it is pretty distracting to hear this awful music and it killed the experience for me.\n\nIf you like the whine of contemporary christian music to go along with your brunch, then you can add a couple of stars.

We ordered Huevos Rancheros and the Mexican Chicken Salad. Both were delivered to our table in under 10 minutes - speedy service and our waiter was really nice.   The Huevos Rancheros were good but nothing overly special. The Mexican Chicken Salad was special - it was huge and full of great ingredients and flavors - a yummy dressing, lots of spicy chicken and a very generous helping of avocado on top (my favorite).  \n\nI'd give this restaurant five stars if they would rethink the decor.  There is just too much going on and I felt like I was in a Vegas buffet.

Even though there seemed to be an adequate number of busboys, some tables were left unbussed with old food and plates on them.  I found this to be quite unpleasant.

Actually, your establishment is trying to scam me. His response was \"well its just weird because it's for 2 different charges.\" Doofus! The errant charge is exactly double the legitimate charge.

I give the potatoes 3 stars, the chicken apple sausage 3 stars, and the pancakes were nothin' special ...the food gave me the carbs I needed but was definitely not worth the wait....I was a little disappointed because I had been here once before and remember it being a better dining experience then.", "author": "Dove F."}

NOT GOOD! \n\n- Nutella with chocolate crepe was too sweet...mouth explosion of chocolate. I had to scrape off plenty of goobs of chocolate off the crepe and just eat it cause it was money spent. But thank god I ordered it with vanilla ice cream cause it washed off the chocolate.\n- Apricot almond crepe was more refreshing and clean. Try it!\n\nEntrees?\n- Spaghetti Bolognese was mediocre but not awesome! But it is better than most cafes that serve \"spaghetti with meat sauce\"...which probably means it is \"Prego\" thrown in with some ground pork.\n- Salmon Fettucini(sp???) was alright...the salmon bites were a tad fishy, the sauce was too creamy and sweet, could have lighten up about the sauce.", "author": "Club G."}

We weren't expecting Chez Panisse mind you, but we were expecting them to be cooked.  Yes, cooked.  What we got was breaded chicken a light golden brown and 100% raw on the inside.  Our son ate one before we could stop him and the whole afternoon we were waiting to see if he would get food poisoning.  (He managed to survive.)\n\nWhen I called over a manager, he sheepishly refunded me our money and asked if we wanted another plate of chicken.

Tons of people in this place and line out the door.  Figure with this much people it cant be bad. Saw a few people leave the line probably cause it took a long time to order. We finally ordered and found a seat.  This place is setup so you order your food at the counter, find your own seat and they bring the food to you. I think it's setup this way so they can get tips.  More than a few time I seen the waiters walk back and forth with your food looking for your number.  No reason to bring the food to your table since they don't know where you're sitting.  Just call your number and get your food. Wait... there's more to this story.... as we're sitting there for the longest time waiting for our food. The waitress accidentally drop a glass of beer on my daughter!  Luckily it didn't hit her but spills all over her sweater and chair.  Enough that she has to take off the sweater and the need to mop her chair up and the floor. They apologize and ask if they can bring anything.  My girlfriend ask if they can give both my daughters a muffin.  I don't think that's asking much.  They reply back with I can give you one and they can split it!!  WTH!!  I'm not asking for a free meal.  Just something to show good customer service and a sorry gesture.  Anyways the food was OK but I won't be back.", "author": "Tony Y."}

While the concept is totally unoriginal (it looks like every other breakfast/creperie in SF, right down to the colorful chalkboard menu)  its hard to find anything wrong with the place.  Crepes, salads, sandwiches, bagels, morning cocktails (and even some Soju concoctions as well).   I ordered an eggplant sandwich and greek salad to split with a friend, and everything was perfect.  Slices of eggplant thicker than you thought possible, cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly...its the eggplant sandwich I dream of (despite being on Foccacia...my least favorite bread).  The greek salad dressing is perfectly tangy.  The portions are good for the price, and you'll end up with leftovers for sure.  A solid establishment!", "author": "Cathleya G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-02-14", "description": "Food is strictly average-- I would rather go to Crepevine on Fillmore. But my biggest  gripe about this place is waiting for a table! The restaurant is small, space is tight and you would literally have to hover over someone to guilt them into leaving their table. The service is non-existent and it takes forever to get your food. Not a relaxing, enjoyable experience at all.", "author": "Mama L."}

I think their eggs and pasta is pretty good. Their salads are not too great. I often come here when I can't get a seat over at the Grove across the street. The greatest thing about Squat and Gobble is that they have FREE Internet with good coverage, which can sometimes be a little frustrating at the Grove. The one thing I wish they had at Squat and Gobble is more snack foods.", "author": "Chanli S."}

The food is delicious and the service was fast.  I first thought this place was one of a kind until I saw the menu and noticed they have other locations in San Francisco.  The potatoes are delicious and I love the chalk board menu.", "author": "P L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-09-16", "description": "decent food, for decent prices, though allot a considerable amount of time to dine here.  i get a savory crepe every time, and it's just OK; nothing special.  seemingly low in flavor/salt, so that may be good for the sodium-conscious.  we sit outside every time, and there's great people watching, and the servers are nice to our dog.  if you're in a rush, however, i wouldn't recommend squatting & gobbling here.  average wait time for simple dishes (chicken salad & a crepe) is approx. 30 min.", "author": "Meno T."}
