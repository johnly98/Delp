The siu aap (duck) was tasty. The meat fatty and tender. I'm not a huge cha siu (barbecue pork) person as I find it a little too sweet for my tastes, but everyone seemed to enjoy this.\n\nSolid spot for roasted meats.

The way they marinate their duck is some kind of sorcery, it's just so delicious.\nAnother dish that is yummy is their green beans. It is a bit on the oily side, but it's so delicious to have a veggie dish on the side to balance the meal (even though duck itself will suffice :D)\nI have been eating their roast duck since I was a kid, and my parents drive all the way from the Easy Bay to SF for this duck.

For the roast pork, you have the choice of getting it with belly meat or lean meat, and I chose the belly meat, which made it taste amazing, but it was very rich and felt quite guilty. It was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside though which was amazing.\n\nThe duck was excellently flavored as well. It is a bit on the fattier side in parts, but it was still delicious and the duck had a rich and amazing flavor, while still being crisp enough on the outside. Not as amazing as the ducks you get in Beijing, but I guess this is a solid Cantonese style duck.\n\nYou can also request plum sauce on the side if you want something to dip the duck in.

When we reminded them we are still waiting for our food, the waitress shouted back \"have to cook\"! Then she turned to the other 2 waitresses and made some unkind remarks in Cantonese. They didn't know or couldn't care less we understood Cantonese. My sister couldn't resist answering them back and they actually came to the table to argue back! OMG!

So, I dropped my groceries and walked on over.\n\nThe first thing you notice when you upon this place is the poultry hanging in the window. The roast duck and chicken looks phenomenal. This is definitely an eye catcher to those passing by on the street or sidewalk. I saw ribs as well and knew I had to get something from here. \n\nOnce inside I noticed that the seating was very LIMITED. Actually, there are signs posted to just take a seat at a table if you want to dine in. Also, the seats are reserved for those that want to dine in as well. The signs come off as a bit aggressive which was a somewhat of a turn off. When you walked in you see the menu to your right on the wall. I thought initially that they only offered to poultry by the pound but I did see a menu at the end of the counter. Fortunately, I knew I wanted BBQ ribs and that was my aim in coming here. After placing my order I was considering buying more food but that seemed to be a bit much for just me, I like to eat but this would've been excessive.\n\nWhen I finally placed my order the butcher began to chop up the BBQ ribs. He was rather aggressive and excited while he was chopping. I don't know if that is how most butchers are but he was really into it. The cost for the pound came out to $8.70 total. All things considered that was a bargain in my opinion.\n\nWhile I placed my order the female cashier and someone in the back were yelling back and forth to each other. It was a bit odd and confusing. I could tell by her face that it was not something good. Because I could not understand what was being said I just waiting to get my food rung up. But, when I finally got ready to pay she seemed upset and frustrated. I just got some bad vibes from here. Not very welcoming or inviting. Oh, I forgot to mention that out of the maybe 5 or 6 tables here there was only one table that was occupied and that was by the staff who happened to be taking a break. My guess is that eating here is not the best option.\n\nAfter paying for my food I grabbed a menu and headed out. \n\nWhen I finally got home I had a chance to review the menu. There are some really good options for food here but I am not sure that I would want to come back to such a unstable environment. I would like to try the running chicken with rice but we'll have to see.\n\nAs far as my food goes, it was OK. Good sweet ribs that I mixed with some steamed rice. I did feel that the ribs were cut into pieces way too small but the flavor was still good. I was able to save some for tomorrow because the pound was actually more than what I needed. Good ribs and a good meal. \n\nIf the workers here could get along and customer service improved I could see this place getting a lot of good reviews. \n\nI am satisfied with what I ordered but I hope that next time I come here things have improved for the better. \n\n#bbqribsIgotdibs", "author": "Robert F."}

At Cheung Hing, DUCK DUCK DUCK!\n\nProbably among the most cost-effective duck, because you are neither forced to get an entire Peking duck nor restricted to fine-dining-portions of fancy duck confit. The duck rice plate at Cheung Hing is perfect in terms of taste, portion, and price to satisfy duck cravings. The place is very hole-in-the-wall, almost like street food, but to be optimistic I guess that gives a more authentic feel. Since it's gained some popularity, it's perhaps not as cheap as truely unknown hole-in-the-walls, but everything is still very reasonably priced.\n\nWhen in doubt, I suggest not straying too far from the famous duck. We tried some other items and though not bad, in my opinion I've had better BBQ pork and chicken at fast food in HK:\n- Chicken: It was authentic yellow-feathered chicken (yeah that's a direct translation so it sounds funny), but it was extremely scrawny \n- BBQ pork: Always a safe choice, and the server was kind enough to ask us whether we had a preference for the lean or fatty cuts. Maybe the more popular fatty option would have been better, because we got the lean one which turned out very dry and had a funny texture.\n- Roast pork: Pretty good!

We chose 3 dishes from the slightly sticky plastic menus and the food was served fairly quickly. Sesame chicken - yuck - dried out breaded chunks of mystery meat. BBQ dried rice - ok. Fish with greens - good! Would have liked to had more fish in the dish though. The wait staff were nice about refilling our water glasses too (that will always earn points with me) \nMy recommendation is get the food to go.

It's a story of a young ugly duckling who was constantly bullied by her friends because of her appearance. But as we know, the duckling eventually blossomed into a beautiful Swan, admired and revered by all.\n\nBut you never heard the epilogue.\n\nWith beauty, fame, and power by her side, the Swan vengefully sought for all the ducks who had bullied her. Swan roasted each duck until their skin were crisp to the touch, and then she would send them off into a place known as Cheung Hing. To this day, it is said that one could walk by Noriega and 30th and still smell the roasted skin of the duck bullies....\n\nAs a Yelper investigator, I had to check out the legendary Cheung Hing myself. True to the tales, the aroma of roasted duck found me almost a block away. Mesmerized, I followed my nose all the way inside Cheung Hing. \n\nAs I was ordering my plate of Roast Duck Over Rice, I saw Natalie Portman sitting with a plate of her own on the side table. I am a big Star Wars fan, so I was very excited to see Padme in the actual flesh. I handed the cashier my $7.50 and immediately sat across from Padme at the greasy table. \n\n\"Wow Padme, it's so great to finally meet you! You know, Anakin actually turned out okay in the end, and Luke and Leia are doing great. Hey what are you doing here anyway?\"\n\n\"The same reason why you are here.\" She pointed to her plate of Roast Duck Over Rice.\n\nIn my rush to meet Padme, I had forgotten to admire the beauty of my plate. The glaze of the crispy skin reflected the bright lights of Cheung Hing. The oils and fat, full of flavor, were leaking from the duck and into the crevices between each grain of soft and fluffy rice. It looked spectacular, and smelled even better. \n\nIt must have tasted even better than that because Padme was attacking her plate with ferocity. She licked the juice off her fingers after sinking her teeth into the tender meats from the duck leg. The duck was delicious, yes. But it was still very uncharacteristic of her to savagely devour the duck in that violent manner. \n\n\"Hey Padme, maybe you should slow down. I know it's delicious and all, but you're still a Hollywood actress and there are paparazzi everywhere.\"\n\nWith half of her face still buried in the plate, her eyes rose to stare into my own. Her eyes were beginning to turn red, and her pupils dilated into utter blackness.\n\n\"You keep calling me Padme...\" she hissed.\n\n\"I...I'm sorry, would...would you prefer Qu-Queen Amidala?\"\n\n\"Can't you see...?\"\n\nShe stood. Black feathers sprouted from her sides. She fluttered her arms fluidly and cocked her head. Her black pupils fixed onto me without expression.\n\n\"I am the Black Swan.\"", "author": "Ringo M."}

During peak hours, there's always a line of hungry Chinese people going out the door, but it tends to move at a decent pace. People inside are all yelling out their orders, and the butchers somehow collect everything and channel it into boxes full of roasted goodies. For how disorganized it is, there's some sort of chaotic efficiency. Just know what you want before you reach the counter, and don't be shy. It also helps to speak loud Cantonese. However, all of this is pretty easily avoidable if you pick up food during off peak hours.\n\nAs for the food, you can't go wrong with their venerated roast duck. Rich, savory, fatty, juicy, it hits all the right notes. The spices and seasonings they use give it a really bold flavor. The skin could be crispier, but it's still really good. The leftover salty and fatty juices can be used like bacon grease. It makes anything taste great. On rice, noodles, bread, eggs, vegetables, or other meat, it's all good. Lips feeling chapped? Lather them in delicious leftover duck fat. Ming Kee is also one of our favorite places for take out roast duck, but it's been a little inconsistent since they moved back to Ocean.\n\nI also like the Cha Siu (BBQ Pork) here. It's tender, juicy, and sweet. In addition to the glimmering sweet glaze, the burnt edges also add a lot of flavor and texture. Ordering half lean half fat doesn't seem to change the composition of the pieces much, but it's all still tasty.", "author": "Nei N."}

Got half an order of steamed tofu, fried tofu in some pork sauce (sorry I'm not chinese, I just saw and pointed), and sticky fried rice with Chinese sausage (according to a helpful lady trying to fix my puzzled face).\nThe total was $19.50. They charged for a plastic bag, hot sauce packets, and to go boxes. But there was enough for 2.5 meals. \nI took everything to go as the place was crowded and that just seemed like the right thing to do. \nThe food was ok. The steamed tofu had some kind of mixed meat overpowered by chives with a sauce that looked liked watered down soy sauce. The fried tofu was pretty good and it had pieces of pork in it so I didn't feel completely like a vegetarian. The pork was soggy, but added flavor to the dish. Sticky rice was really good, not too salty and had a good chewy texture. Finally the reason for the line - bbq pork. It was...ok. I had it, I can cross it off my list, I can move on. If you closed your eyes and couldn't smell, you can definitely taste that it was pork. It was chewy, a bit tender, not too salty, and the outside bbq sauce was what made it good.

There was always a line out the door during meal times. Since the place is tiny, having a line form wasn't hard to achieve. It only takes 3 or 4 customers to look busy.\n\nSo on my trip back to SF for business, I am again staying in the Sunset. Trying to capture some memories, I dropped by Cheng Hing to grab a quick bite. Inside, there's a counter with pre-cooked dishes, from diced chicken with peppers, to fish, fried tofu...etc. Hanging by the window in true Cantonese fashion are whole golden, glistening roasted ducks and slabe of BBQ pork. There are also a few tables for customers who don't mind eating next to a line of shouting customers ordering take-out. \n\nAs I recalled (and read on Yelp) they are known for their duck, and I had to have it again. I also chose a 2nd item, fish filet in black bean sauce over rice. I was never a fan of Cantonese BBQ pork (char siu) so I passed as much as they tried to convince me how good it is. \n\nThe two items rest on a pile of rice with a few pieces of cabbage, which I suspect was to fill the box and make it appear fuller than it really is. The fish in b.b. sauce was decent. It's salty, tender (as fish should be) but lacked anything exciting. It's a \"filler\" The duck pieces were extremely fatty. I'd say 50% of the pieces they threw into the box was not edible, unless you actually enjoy chunks of oily, fatty, greasy duck lard covered by an equally fatty skin. The pieces that actually had meat was good, but the flavor was often covered by the taste of grease. \n\nAfter eating half of the order, I began to feel.... not right. That was my cue to stop. Perhaps it was the heavy amount of grease that stealthily leaked into the rice but I felt weighed down and had an urge to drink hot tea to rinse out the grease from my intestines. \n\nThinking back, the duck I ordered years ago were much leaner and didn't make me feel sick in my stomach (sorry belly, I'll make it up to you with some 'good' food) Now that I relived my memories, I no longer want to go back. \n\nFor 2 items and a plastic bag (I assume they charged me for the bag, since they spilled sauce on the box and I really didn't want duck grease on my leather seats) it was $8.60. Hardly a bargain, and definitely not worth the price. I now have the urge to detox. \n\nAs for the people lining up, perhaps the Cantonese elders have grown immune to this level of cardiac causing oil. Not me.

A bit less sweet, and a bit more medicinal. Probably would not get this the next time around.\n\n* Roast Duck - Definitely the star of the three, with great flavor, and deliciously wonderful duck skin.\n\nWhile there were some misses, the roast duck alone is worth coming back for, especially at these prices!\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - Seating is pretty limited, but most people seem to show up to get orders to go.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-23", "description": "Are you looking for some of the tastiest Chinese barbecue meats in San Francisco? This place is a pretty good choice. \n\nCheung Hing is the Cantonese Chinese pronunciation of \u7965\u8208. I have no idea what it really means, but \u7965 itself supposedly means \"auspicious\" or \"lucky\" and \u8208 itself supposedly means \"prosper\", \"rise\", or \"become popular\". Well, I was lucky enough to get some of the best Chinese barbecue in San Francisco and this place looks really popular. \n\nThis is probably one of my relatives' favorite place for Chinese barbecue in San Francisco. I stood in a somewhat long queue with my relatives, and the queue consisted of mostly elderly Chinese people that spoke either Cantonese Chinese or Toisan Chinese (\u53f0\u5c71\u8a71). When you see a queue of elderly Chinese people, it's possibly a good sign that the Chinese barbecue is really good. The wait was not bad, probably less than 20 minutes. \n\nWe got more than 2 lbs. (more than a kilogram) of \u71d2\u8089 (siu youk, crispy roasted pork) and \u71d2\u9d28 (siu ngaap, roasted duck). These refer to the Roasted Pork (#3 on the sign, \u8106\u76ae\u71d2\u8089, Cheui Pei Siu Youk) and the Roasted Duck (#1 on the sign, \u660e\u7210\u706b\u9d28, Ming Lou Fo Ngaap). We then went out, got some toothpicks and began to snack on them while watching the San Francisco sunset nearby. \n\nThe crispy roasted pork was excellent. The crispiness had a really good crunch, and the pork had the right amount of tenderness. However, the roasted duck was even better. It was so freshly cooked, very juicy, very tender, and every piece was very meaty. The taste was almost heavenly after each bite. It was definitely one of the best Chinese roasted ducks I have eaten. \n\nIf I had some freshly cooked white rice and some freshly cooked and somewhat seasoned vegetables with either the duck or pork, I think I would have the most ideal Chinese dinner or lunch. The prices are pretty good and almost cheap. It costs $6.75 for a pound of \u71d2\u8089, and it's enough to feed 4 people. As for the duck, it's about $8.75 for half a duck, but $14.95 for the whole duck. If you could only get one item off the menu, I recommend you get the roast duck or a dish that contains a generous portion of roast duck. \n\nOverall, if you do not mind the gritty setting and you are looking for some of the best Chinese barbecue meats in San Francisco, this place is a pretty good choice. I thought I had some of the best roast duck not only in San Francisco, but possibly in the USA.  I can't believe I am giving a somewhat gritty place in San Francisco a really high rating, but I thought I had the best Chinese barbecue style pork and duck in years.", "author": "Ambrose C."}

In hindsight, it was probably a bad idea since it wasn't great for the braces, but I do remember it being delicious.  There's always a line out the door which has got to mean that this place does something right.  That something, is their duck.\n\nWell, of course I had to have their duck, and I doubled down with some roast pork over rice.  We also ordered the beef stew over chow fun as well.  The duck is delectable, and the skin is perfectly crisp without too much fat.  The pork was the same way and was a bargain for $6.50.  The chow fun was piping hot and paired well with the beef and veggies, and a great deal for about $6.\n\nTheir most popular dishes are their roasted meats and that's what you should come for.

I haven't yelled that loudly since I was married. I had to yell every dish name three or four times, and then yell the quantity I wanted another three or four times.

Cheung Hing has been a staple on Noriega throughout my childhood in the Richmond/Sunset until I made that leap down to Los Angeles for college then work.  The quality of food is better than say a Panda Express and prior to this last time, I've only been a standard wait-in-line/place an order customer.  It is a no-frills, quick eat place.  I understand that there may be new management.\n \nI experienced my first (and last) catering ordering here as I returned to SF for my nephew's birthday.   I'd advise that you DO NOT CATER from here if you want your simple but large catered orders to be 1) prepared on the correct date, 2) ready at the time stated on your invoice, and/or 3) handled with any modicum of service.   \n \nA large order was placed for over $400 with a cash deposit.  According to the employee, Jessica, my college educated Vietnamese sister-in-law who does not speak one ounce of Cantonese, but speaks perfect English called and had the date changed from the party date to the day before and the time was changed to 10:30 pm (yes pm) (I have a picture of the handwritten changes to the invoice).  The party was at a fixed venue reserved 2 months in advance and no the restaurant does not open past 9 pm.  After some basic reasoning, Jessica later acknowledged that either she or the employee misunderstood my sister-in-law and incorrectly changed the date and the time.  That mistake was obvious.  \n \nThis mistake by the restaurant led to some unnecessary chaos the day before the party as the restaurant thought it was supposed to prepare the order the day before.  Allegedly that was fixed.  However, we receive a call at 10:30 am the day of the party informing us that the food was ready (the food was supposed to be ready at 12:30 pm). Yes, this really happened even after confirming the correct date and time the day before when dealing with the prior fiasco.    I also suspect that this may have been a deliberate \"misunderstanding\" so the food would be ready pre-lunch rush, rather than the agreed upon time stated on the invoice. We scramble to get there early at 11:30 am and NO ONE helps to take the remainder of our balance (cash of course) or to give us our massive $400 order.  After some time, Jessica helps and yes some of the food, including the fried chicken is already COLD since they cooked it early at the incorrect time.    We wait for them to re-fry the chicken and load the car with the re-fried chicken and other trays of somewhat warm food.  Total time in since entering the restaurant to pick up our allegedly ready order - approximately 40 minutes (and one double parking ticket).   We ask to speak to the manager to discuss the various problems with our order- and the MANAGER REFUSED to COME OUT TO SPEAK TO US.  \n \nIt is unbelievable to experience such dismissive customer service (or lack thereof), particularly with respect to an order as large as ours. \n \nI grew up in the Richmond/Sunset area and I am very familiar with the way Cantonese establishments are run.  I did not expect Michelin star service, but I did expect bare bones-pride in your work and accountability for mistakes, particularly when a large order exceeding $400 is so blatantly and incompetently mismanaged.  \n \n \nAlso, I could do without the middle aged female worker at the take out counter who would not stop making snide comments in Cantonese as we futility waited to speak to the manager shouting things to Jessica such as \"there is no one to blame for the error\" and \"we can't do anything for them\" (yep, I understand Cantonese), As I told her, she didn't even know the half of the problems and yes there is a party at fault (several times over), the restaurant.

The windows showing the roast duck, chicken, pork hanging and the kitchen staff busy chopping up takeout orders (a unique Cantonese restaurant scene), and they also have some tables and chair for eat-in but the majority of the business are takeouts.  Every time I am craving for some greasy roast duck, cha-siu (roast pork), crispy siu york (roast pig or bbq pig with skin attached) or deep fried tofu, I come here.  They also have a variety of cheap Cantonese comfort foods that can be ordered by weight.  This place reminds me of back home in Hong Kong and things are pretty authentic.  Gosh, my mouth is watering while writing this review.\n\nDue to the volume of business they do, many dishes and takeout orders are really fresh as the cooks are churning out trays and trays of them.  They also cater with large trays of yummy foods, like chicken wings, chow mein and fried rice.\n\nCash only!", "author": "Frank C."}

I first wandered here while going grocery shopping at the Safeway across the street - it is impossible not to notice the line of people going out the door. They have the standard Chinese BBQ fare, like crispy roast pork, char siu pork, roast duck, soy sauce chicken etc. All the meats here are fantastic, and if you order the meat, you get to enjoy the sight of a large Chinese man wielding a cleaver and slicing through connective tissue. Though the BBQ joints on Irving are a bit more convenient to get to, Cheung Hing is my first choice when picking up takeout. Plus the parking here seems to be less of an issue than on Irving.\n\nThe reason that I cannot give Cheung Hing five stars is that the dine-in experience is pretty mediocre.

So my plan was to get some of the deli counter items, which are plentiful, and take it over to the park or maybe even home.\n\nCase 1: the fried rice incident. there's a huge vat of fried rice right behind the counter. Well wait..\n\nCase 1: the screaming. When a person is quietly pointing to items she is interested in purchasing, the woman behind the counter repeats the request, only screaming at the top of her lungs in Chinese. \n\nI don't really see the point of this as no one is farther than 36 inches away, and its very distracting.\n\nThen, with a huge vat of fried rice clearly visible, she hands me a menu and says \"what kind\". Uhh..how about that kind? Points.\n\nStill screaming, she vanishes in a vortex of noise and goes to the kitchen to place a menu order for the rice. Uhhh...No.\n\nI ask for some fresh vegetables. She sort of carelessly tosses an almost empty vat of old cabbage in my general direction. Nope\n\nMy  gf, who is right on her game, cleverly orders string beans from the menu. This is the last we hear of it for awhile.\n\nFeeling that we have, under the most incredible duress, managed to order rice and a vegetable, and buoyed by a foolish self confidence,  we move on to the meat. Now, this is where their money grabbing techniques really shine.\n\nIn most chinese delis, they understand that 2 people are probably not ordering for a family of six or eight. Here, that is the assumption. So, when I ask the butcher for a half duck, a \"little bit\" of roast pork and a \"small order\" of spare ribs, this is what he gives me, and I swear to God, I thought I was watching him prepare someone else's order.\n\nHe gives me a 2 meat combination rice plate consisting of 1/4 duck and a little roast pork on a huge bed of rice, with a couple of tablespoons of the used cabbage. I'm thinking, gee, glad I am not THAT sucker.\n\nThen he cuts a half pound of said meats. Each. Now, all of this is happening with a busload of people who just got in line, with a steady volume of unrelenting screaming. I seriously want to get out of there.\n\nFinally our order is packed. We're 2 people in a chinese deli, how much could it cost?\n\nForty seven dollars. Yup. $47.00\n\nAt this point I'm thinking whatever, I need to get out of here. We'll have leftovers, lots of them.\n\nWe get to the car and take the food out of the bags, and that's when I see that we have the rice plate, pounds upon pounds of meat, and no string beans.\n\nTo their credit, they took back the rice plate and lo and behold, there was our order of string beans. When everything was changed out, we still had way more food than we wanted and spent way more money than we planned to.\n\nSo, how was the food, Sharon?\n\nThe fried rice tasted like ass, I kid you not. Worst. Ever.\n\nThe duck, their claim to fame, was actually quite good.\n\nEverything was so over salted that  9 hours, an ice cream sundae and several bottles of water later my mouth is still burning. Is salted food supposed to make your throat and tongue hurt?\n\nAnd I have a fridge full of this over salted meat that I will probably save a bit of to throw into a soup or a pot of greens, and the rest will probably be tossed.\n\nThis, from someone who can make a $20 order from Tsing Tao last for 3 meals and a snack. Who always asks for low salt.\n\nI'm actually quite irritated that I find the meat inedible, it was a huge waste of money. Whatever I paid for the rice, it was too much.\n\nIf you are courting high blood pressure and a stroke, this would be the place to buy food. I promise, there is no way you can be prepared for the screaming, the crowd and the whirlwind of over cutting by the butcher. \n\nNo way I am ever going back there.", "author": "Sharon J."}

The roast duck is awesome and quite possibly the best in San Francisco.\n2. The lines are crazy long and if you want your duck you're going to have to wait for it.\n\nSo our family has had their roast ducks and their Chinese BBQ on many occasions, but at least once a year we depend on Cheung Hing to cook up party trays of some of their other foods in helping our extended family celebrate my dad's birthday.  My dad is the typical home body.  He doesn't like eating inside a restaurant, and he finds it a lot more comfortable to gather up friends and family and have a feast at his house.  Over the years our gathering has taken on a sort of pot luck style with mostly everyone bringing a favorite dish to share, but we always order extra food from Cheung Hing just in case.  Besides, good food to take home after the party is a big bonus since my dad hates leftovers.\n\nAmong the four dishes we ordered this year and based by the popularity vote from the guests were:\n\nBeef Chow Fun with Bok Choy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sAh7HSFXR9qnuH3kT3koeQ?select=2TCjsiYasxiW6nKc8VDcLA) - This has been the favorite every year because both kids and adults like fun (flat rice noodles).  The fun and the bok choy were very good.  I was the last of the nearly 20 guests to fill my plate, and most of the beef was already scooped up.  The bok choy was cooked up just soft enough to bite into cleanly.  It must've been good because the little kids all wanted seconds.\n\nBraised Tofu with Mushrooms & Carrots (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sAh7HSFXR9qnuH3kT3koeQ?select=182sHWyFewOWVabJrSv7qA) - I love tofu, and this was my favorite.  The silky, soft melt-in-your-mouth tofu squares were lightly fried and the light brown gravy that it was served in was gentlely seasoned.  The mushrooms and carrots were mostly gone, although my sister and my niece each managed to find a hidden mushroom submerged in the gravy.  I just loved the tofu and that's the dish I went to for my seconds.\n\nGreen Beans with Chicken Sauteed in Garlic (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sAh7HSFXR9qnuH3kT3koeQ?select=9XG79mYN_F3MM4F2b5jNeg) - There was lots of minced garlic and crunchy green beans and just a bit of soft white onion.  I noticed the kids didn't really get into this dish, but the adults loved it.  Lots of boneless chicken pieces although I found a little corn starch residue on a couple of my chicken pieces.  I loved the minced garlic and the beans.\n\nChicken and Pork Chow Mein (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sAh7HSFXR9qnuH3kT3koeQ?select=MYcCO-_n5vpetRFHp7-F4Q) - This has usually been a favorite, but this year the noodles seemed a bit more starchy than normal.  Most of the noodles were clumped together, but they gave us lots of shredded chicken and pork and very little bean sprouts, onion and green onion.  The kids didn't really go for this which told us something was not right about it.

Their duck is so flavorful!!  No one else comes close in flavor as Cheung Hing.  My dad told me that's because it's Macau style. \n\nINSIDER TIP: \nIf you're not going to eat the duck right away, don't let them pour the duck au jus on the cut meat.  Ask for the au jus on the side.  By the way, it's the au jus that makes it taste so good NOT the plum sauce, so don't let them skip you out of the au jus!!\n\nBe careful they'll charge you extra for the au jus.  I don't know why, because it was already in the duck before it's cut so why do I have to pay extra, right?! \n\nI remember when the duck price was only $8 and they NEVER charged you extra for the au jus, but now it's $15 and they charge you extra for au jus.  Really?!!!  You'd think they'll just give you the au jus instead of charging you extra for it.  You know they're just going to throw that away at the end of the day.\n\nI forgot to mention their BBQ pork is one of the BEST I've ever had as well.

This review is based on my latest and perhaps only dine-in experience\n\nThis store is the perfect example that once a store has become popular and famous, they can basically do anything and the people would still continue to line up.  My wife and I were craving for some roasted ducks, so we decided to dine in and ordered wonton soup and roasted duck.  the waitress told us that it's going to be a FIFTEEN minutes wait.  Then she explained that they only do their wontons in batches, I guess to save their time and pots, but whatever, we ordered beef brisket and BBQ pork noodles instead..  \n\nIt was a long wait for a simple basic order (the line is long, but that's only for the outside to go food... but whatever).  I noticed another dine-in customer is complaining, and the waitress was saying something like they'll only do something if there are two or more orders, and the customer finally said \"fine I'll have two orders\", and then the waitress said, \"but we can't we do it now because we are too busy\"... the customer was like forget it.\n\nfinally, our orders have come.  I was thinking since it was a long wait and such a famous place, and cost $7.50 each, the quality has to be good.  Well, the duck is good, but both of the noodles tasted like crap. there's not much difference between the broth and the tea.  the pieces of beef briskets are WHITE and some are even COLD as if they just chopped some right from their freezer and dumped in the soup and served to us immediately.  the waitress did give us some \"roast duck sauce\" to dip the beef briskets in... BBQ pork is Ooookay, but we only got the skinny dry parts, I guess these are the unwanted parts they throw in noodle soup as they wanna save the juicy crispy parts for to go orders.   Anyway, I've had MUCH better  noodles for cheaper (even ABC, or the other Chinese BBQ place two blocks down the road with no customers) at cheaper price... heck, I could have made better noodle soup myself and faster.\n\nsafe to say, we would not consider dining in ever again, to go only...  and even then, it's getting more tempting to just go to the other place and skip the line.  the duck there isn't that bad either.", "author": "gswfan .."}

There's a reason why people drive out of the way for their barbecue.  Lines are out the door at times as I always wonder how the heck they keep up with demand when the going gets tough. \n\nHave you been here, seeing the line, thought to yourself whether to wait or not?  I have.  Peering down at my watch while not even wearing one, I shake my head and always end up waiting.  \"This line is keeping me from my soy sauce chicken?!\"  \n\nUnlike Chinatown, you won't have to yell over three not so friendly four foot tall older Asian ladies that'll cut into the line like a running back; the crowd is less rowdy and there probably be only one.  Here's a little trick that may be obvious to some yet not to others.  Cheung Hing offers a range of steam table items besides their barbecue.  Most of the selection is derived from various meaty delights.  To bypass that line, go to the front where the steam table dishes are and simply order something from there.  At the same time order any of the barbecue goodies you want along with that steam table order.  This'll expedite things immensely.  Apparently, this is a \"separate line\" to the barbecue line.  To the naked eye, a cluster of people calling and pointing crowded around the front doesn't rub off as a line to most.     \n\nPERSONAL FAVORITES TO ORDER FROM THE STEAM STABLE:\n*Deep fried tofu - Let me see...I don't have an official record, but I swore I have eaten 25 of these bad boys in one sitting once.  I highly recommend these tofu delights, but not making eating records out of it like me.  Filled with a meat paste and served up with thick dipping sauce, these make for a good side or appetizer.  Falls under a MUST TRY outside any of the barbecue.\n \n*Braised tofu with mushrooms - Seeing a theme?  I like tofu.  How can such simplicity be so good?  Deep fried tofu braised with mushrooms, some napa cabbage, and carrots.  The gravy may be overwhelming and fatty (probably zapped straight from the meat fat).  There's a simple solution.  Add an extra cup of white rice, always fixes the problem.    \n\nAll the stuff here are greasy, artery filling, heart stopping, and really delicious.  Nothing says yummy than biting into a big piece of meat intermingled with a chuck of well flavored fat.  Besides the adverse health features, having an aching for some barbeque pork or roasted duck, hop on by or better yet, jog on by.  The cardio will help what you'll intake (not really).

Now that I don't live in Sunset, I get mt Chinese poultry elsewhere. But anyways, I notice the service here is typically Chinese. Yeah I said it because I grew up around Chinese people and being one myself. The butcher would ask my mother which bird or meat she wants. My mom would pick the most suitable one and the butcher would tell her that he recommends a \"better one\" which is obviously the crappy one. When the customer tells you that they want that one, just give them what they are paying for! sheeesh.  So be careful of recommendations from the butchers who work there.\n\nI RECOMMEND people to come here and just order a whole bird or whatever. Buy the meat especially in the noon time, because by night it gets old. \n\nDefinitely don't eat here at night because they feed you left overs. Recently my friends and I were craving duck so we sat in and they served us crappy old duck with leftover vegetables.... It was so nasty and the duck was super greasy and fat. So I asked myself, \"what are they feeding me?\" Again... don't eat here at night because that's when they wanna get rid of the leftovers.\n\nThis place use to be so much better and they had potential.

When asked why the person before us had an unclosable box, both of the cashier ladies simultaneously responded that our duck was more lean and healthy. Fine...we also bought some half a chicken, roast pork, BBQ pork, and some of the prepared food items. Comes out to $60.

Under $6 for Chow Fun? That's hard to beat (my standard dish I judge all Chinese restaurants on). BBQ hanging in the window? Of course. The duck is really good... a lot of fat and it's really greasy, but damn, it's good. \n\nYou can order pre-made food cafeteria style. You can also get made-to-order food from their fairly extensive menu. Everything (at least entrees) is under $10, and a lot are under 8. Half a duck sets you back over 10 I think. The serving sizes are huge though. I mean, I eat a lot, but if it's supposed to be 1 dish a person, they put me to shame\n\nSure, it's kinda dirty... but you get free tea if you eat in! Or you just order it takeout and pretend like you didn't see the grease all around you...\n\nOr you can be like me, and be happy when you how much of a dive it is (ie. dirty)--when there's still a long line and it looks like this... you know it's good.

Normally their food will rate four stars.  The reason i gave them one star is their F UC ked up service.  The guy that cut the chicken up just pour the sauce right into the box instead of their usual plastic sauce container.  You guess it.  When i go back, the sauce leaked all over my car and carpet.  What was this guy thinking pouring sauce directly into the box. When i call the place back up, the person that answer tries not to understand english or difficult to communicate.  come on.  without customer service or messed up customer service like this will not work either.  \n\nTrain your workers properly to serve the public and do not try to disavow knowledge of it.

It's a chaotic, confusing Chinese deli with lots of yelling (in Cantonese) and chopping sounds.  I felt like having duck for lunch one Sunday morning so I joined the queue and the guy in front of me bought the last two ducks; 12:15 PM and they're already sold out of duck!  \n\nThere wasn't a menu in sight but the deli meats were listed overhead (duck feet, duck wings, duck tongues, chicken, BBQ pork, pork ears, pork stomach) and I asked for roast pork over rice.  What a fabulous, simple meal.  The roast pork is lean and flavorful and the skin is extremely crispy and tastes of five spice powder.  There is a thick layer of fat between the meat and the skin though, but it needs to be there to keep the meat moist while making the skin extra crispy.  They provide plenty of white rice to soak up the flavors along with mildly crunchy boiled cabbage, under $7.  \n\nOkay, I bought the roast pork again and received much fattier pieces.  I definitely recommend getting the meat over rice to offset the saltiness and soak up the juices.  \n\nAfter I ordered, I saw the menu was taped up and they also have copies for the people who dine in.  There are a few tables on the side and a fairly long menu that includes congee (I have to try the congee).  The service is brusque and efficient.  But it's still confusing unless you understand Cantonese.  Cash only.\n\nMarch 2008 update:  I was ready to award another star if their congee impressed me.  It's staying at four stars because the congee is good but watery.  I had the roast duck congee.  They add chopped roast duck at the very end.  The congee was lukewarm and I had to expend much effort separating the meat from the bones.  When I eat congee, I don't even want to chew - it needs to be as easy as possible because it's comfort food.  They should add more ginger and scallions too.  On the positive side, they give you lots of duck and the duck is extremely flavorful.  For 50 cents you can add preserved egg to any congee and they use good preserved eggs.  \n\nThe dine-in menu is actually pretty lengthy and includes rice plates, won ton soup, noodle soups, braised noodles, fried rice, chow fun, BBQ rice plates, and seafood, chicken and pork, veggie dishes.  I spotted a spicy pork blood dish that I'd like to try.", "author": "Lolia S."}

I also haven't tried a place that prepares Chinese style BBQ pork better than Cheung Hing either.  If you're to ask people in the Chinese community where to go for the best Hong Kong BBQ, I bet you they'll tell you to come here.  \n\nMy favorite was their five spice chicken.  $5 used to get me a half cut of chicken or duck.  I was pleased to learn that, five years later during a recent visit, the price has now gone up by only a dollar.  It is still an incredibly great deal.  \n\nPlaces like Cheung Hing made it possible for me to eat out for dinner every other night in SF.  \n\nThe lines get long during lunch and dinner time, so come early to get your cut of meat and then I'd recommend you leave.

A whole roast duck for $10.75 (enough for 4), chopped up right in front of you, and perfectly complemented by some veggie fried rice.  The duck is absurdly fatty and well-seasoned to boot (I definitely detected a hint of cloves).  You know your cholesterol is going through the roof but you're compelled to eat every last piece of succulent skin too.  If I had been going straight home, I totally would've taken the leftover grease with me for stir-fry.  Indeed, if I ever have to serve a Christmas dinner, it's gonna be a Cheung Hing duck all the way.  \n\nSafe to say that Noriega wins the duck round, tying things up at 1-1.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-06-10", "description": "I've been coming here forever. I couldn't tell even you how many years. I usually only get duck over rice, or if I'm taking it home, whole or half duck, since I always have rice at the house. It wasn't until this past year I tried the sticky rice and chicken wings. They were both pretty good.\n\nThis is hands down the best place for duck in the city. It's actually the best duck I've ever had. People say Win's on Taraval comes close, or that it has good duck, but I think Win's duck is awful compared to this place. Plus they sometimes give you the sauce, which like someone else mentioned, is also impossible to find anywhere else. The sauce/seasoning of the duck is what makes it.\n\nAnyway.. now for the bad... 4 times out of the last 6 times I ate here, the duck was extremely lukewarm. More on the cold side than the warm side. This is easily avoided by going when the place is busy. I don't like to bitch so I usually just took it home and heated it up. I understand it's not cost effective to keep the cooked duck warm during slow times.\n\nOK now this is the real bad part: the last time I came here, after the butcher was done with everyone's orders, he took a mini break. Well maybe not a break, but it was the first time I ever saw him not behind the counter. Around the end of his mini break, he starts picking his nose and blowing it. Using nothing but his two hands, no napkin, no tissue. Real good too. A good 4 times, getting up real good in those nasage passages.\n\nI have worked in food before. I don't mind the place being a little dirty. I know about all the nasty shit none of you want to know about. I know how hard it is to follow health code every single second of your shift, and how annoying it is to have to wash your hands all the time, especially when you're busy. But it wasn't busy at all. I mean he was clearly taking a quick break. After he was done with his break, he just slowly returned to his post behind the counter towards the window. Didn't wash his hands, didn't put gloves on or anything, just got right back to chopping some meat. I have never ever seen the butcher with gloves on. The ladies I have seen wearing gloves before, but never the butcher. I wasn't even worried that much, since I already got my food, but my friends were. They watched him the whole time and couldn't believe he didn't wash his hands. Great first impression for my friends who don't know anything about Chinese food. They were glad they hadn't gotten anything.\n\nBut anyway.. strike one picking your nose in front of customers. I wasn't the only one eating there. Strike two, not washing your hands after doing it!!! It still didn't really bother me all that much, my review would probably just be a 3, since the duck is still amazing. I've eaten for weeks in a third world country before with flies flying everywhere touching every surface in the kitchen. Got a little minor diarrhea but not much worse than I've had in the US. But what really bothers me is thinking about all these years my family has come here. It has to be at least 10 years. And all these years these people probably didn't have the respect for their customers to wash their hands after doing any kind of activity with a chance of contamination. I haven't been back since, and I don't think I will for a while. That duck is damn good though.", "author": "Steve R."}

I've gotten duck multiple times, so I know what a half duck should look like.  Other than the leg, we didn't get any pieces that had much meat on them.  There were lots of pieces that was almost all fat with a very thin layer of meat or connective tissue over bones.  And there were other pieces that were less fat, but still only a sliver of lean meat over more bones.  I guess he must have been angry that I only got half an order of duck.  The roast pork pieces that we got were also very fatty, but I'll admit that it tasted amazing.  It was tender and juicy and not at all dry like some other places.

Inexpensive, too! Whenever I feel like some Chinese BBQ, this is the place I go! I have discovered this place about eight years ago and been a fan since! The dimensions of this little BBQ shop is quite small...it's a hole-in-the-wall. I think it's really only suppose to fit about three tables at the most but they somehow made it to five tables...of course, all crammed together though. More than once before, I had to squeeze through between two tables to get inside and I felt bad for the person at the other table because my butt was literally in their face (and I ain't fat!)! Lol. But to me this is just something minor for the price I was willing to pay for their delicious roast duck. Their service? Fair. It is a hardcore traditional Chinese Restaurant, so I did not expect much service. Like many other Chinese restaurants, their theory of good service for you is to get u in and out ASAP, which I really do believe they do a great job at. It's like no BS...order, get food, and leave...done. My dinner there usually takes less than half and hour. As far as cleanliness, it's one of those places that I do not wanna know about...I don't wanna what goes on behind those kitchen doors. I will never use their bathroom. I love their food and I'll just leave it at that. Usually, I do try to keep myself from touching their tables and chairs as much as possible though...it doesn't look spotless clean, that's for sure. This place is really off the hook though as far as business flow. It's constantly nonstop! Their phone rings about every five minutes and there's always at least five ppl in line! It's usually the same two Chinese ladies that serves and they do work fast, just not fast enough in comparison to the flow of traffic though. A plus for those servers is that they are able to speak at least three languages: Cantonese, Mandarin, and English. A side note worth noting is that they do serve already-cooked dishes too and those do sell fast as much as their BBQ items do.", "author": "Winnie L."}

The person in front of me ordered exactly what I was about to order which was half a duck. I could see one duck hanging above the counter and below it. The person in front of me got half the duck that was under the counter and I knew there was enough left for me. When I gave them my order they looked at me and said no duck. I could clearly see there was more left so I told them. They turned around started speaking in their foreign language and then told me to leave. As I was leaving I saw the person behind me ordering the same thing only they were Asian and got the duck. AWFUL SERVICE they should be shut down for their unsanitary business and racism.I would give -1,000 stars if I could", "author": "George M."}

Get take-out food for kids' dinner\n3. Get my arse over the Legion of Honor for the exhibit (see LH review)\n\nCheck off 1, where to go for #2?\nOh. Look.  Cheung Hing across the street.  Hmmm, Yelper Charlton L. wrote a recent review of this place.  I've tried their deli stuff, let's try the take-out:\n1.  Won-ton noodle soup - kid says it was OK but better than Win's on Taraval.  CH's won tons are larger (still 5-6) with more shrimp. (noodles & won ton and broth in separate containers)$4.55\n2. Bok Choy chicken chow mein - pretty good with a nice flavor, healthy portions of bok choy and ample chicken breast pieces.  $5.00\n3. Five Spices chicken over rice - the chicken was really good, you get about 1/4-1/3 a small chicken, lots of rice compared to amt. of chicken.  The 5-spice rubbed nicely over the crispy chicken skin with moist meat with the flavor infused into the rice and a dollop of cabbage. $4.95\n4. Gai lan vegt/beef - she didn't hear me say \"fon (rice)\" so, we ended up with just the vegt/beef.  It was swimming in gravy & leaked all over the plastic bag, like a puddle of rain. $5.95.  It was OK, the vegt was very crunchy, not overcooked with slivers of carrots.  Not sure I'd consider this dish again even if it's over rice.\nIf you're going to dine-in, they only have 2-3 small tables.  One is used for the staff to hold the huge aluminum trays of food that people are ordering for parties.  During dinner time, you have to go early or put up with the queue from the doorway.  Definitely the most popular Chinese deli in the neighborhood.  Check off #2.", "author": "Ry T."}

First, credit where it's due: excellent Cantonese BBQ, the ducks, cha siu and other BBQ items are very, very tasty, some of the best in town. The rest of the menu is OK, not distinguished but lots of variety and good-size portions for the money. But the last time I was there I ordered one of my comfort food favorites, fried chicken wings. After ordering I went down the street to use the ATM and when I returned I was told that I couldn't have them because they had already shut down the fryer. (Actually it was a patron who translated this information for me since the cashier didn't have enough English to explain it herself.) \nThe place is open until 9:00PM. I ordered at about 8:35. In my book, either you're open or you're not. Or, one could at least put a notice on the menu that certain items might not be available after a certain time. So I had driven over there for this specific item and they weren't out of it, and they didn't inform me when I ordered that they couldn't fill the order. \nBut that's not it. I have been to lots and lots of restaurants and takeout places and when they disappoint a customer many, if not most, try to make up for it in some way. For instance, there were still three or four barbecued ducks hanging in the window and it was fifteen minutes until closing. If they had offered me a half duck or at least something for my trouble I would have felt very good and well taken care of. Instead what I got was a perfunctory \"Sorry\" and that was the end of it. \nIt's one of the few things I find unforgivable in a restaurant: a lousy sense of hospitality. It's the one thing that any restaurant in any price range can offer if they care to. \nI'm done with Cheung Hing.", "author": "Jerry M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-06", "description": "I never understand why some people peel off the skin when the eat a duck.  All the flavor's in there.  OK, maybe not all the flavors but most of it.  It would be like eating a burger without the meat patty.  People who peel the skin off their ducks before eating them shouldn't be eating ducks, OK?  OK!\n\nWhen it comes to eating the roast duck in Cheung Hing, it should be sacrilegious to peel the skin off.  Skin-peelers should be thrown out the street on their ears.  Maybe that's why most customers who frequent Cheung Hing buy their birds to go.\n\nCH is likely the best cantonese roast duck in the Bay Area -- that crown used to belong to Kwong Shing on Clement but unfortunately they closed a few years ago.  CH's roast duck has crispy skin and the marinade has penetrated into the meat of the bird.  The subcutaneous fat (prized by the way by French cooks, you fat avoiders out there) has mostly dripped away by the slow roasting.  The skin is crisped up, I'm guessing, by a final half hour of higher temperature roasting while the meat is kept tender by a steaming/boiling process via the hot water in the body cavity.\n\nCH's roast duck has changed flavors slightly though.  The marinade used to flavor the duck is now with less sugar/molasses and is more savory.  I liked the older formula better.\n\nCH's char siu is pretty good too but believe it or not the best char siu in the city is at Yank Sing.", "author": "Dave M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-07-07", "description": "It's funny reading some earlier reviews of this place to see how high some expectations can be overall. I believe that giving an honest opinion is best when it comes to telling others about how a place is rather that use language which doesn't even resemble English. The restaurant in question is a small hole in the wall type place that can only fit about 25 people within max. It's more of a take our joint more than anything but I can easily say the best thing on the menu is their BBQ pork. I've seen countless times where people ordered BBQ duck and get ripped off with the lower parts of the bird. Since my folks and I go maybe once every couple months the people who work there know us already so there isn't a problem when it comes to getting the better meats. However with that said I am disappointed at the rising costs and smaller portions of the meal. Sometimes it seems like there's always more cabbage and rice with less meat.\n\nAlong with that, it's also annoying when your ordering out something that the people will always give you more than what you want. If i ordered 1/4 pound of something they will always give me 1/2 a pond and so forth. Sometimes I can really care less but at other moments it gets dull fast always having too much. I've never found service to be an issue but I can see where others have complaints. I don't usually order anything different from the norm but take my advice and just order the pork. Get the leanest meat possible and you wont be disappointed. Avoid the roasted duck over rice and buy the whole thing instead if you want the real experience of this place.", "author": "Jason Y."}

While waiting in line, I look over some of the cooked dishes they had and decide to get some tofu.  They had three different types on display and I wanted the deep fried tofu stuffed with meat.  The lady helping me asks how much I want and I said half a pound but she kept insisting I get a whole pound.  She spoke in Chinese.  I ordered in Chinese but it doesn't mean I understood everything she said.  Anyway, after she kept insisting, I just took the pound.  I think she was just trying to get rid of it since there was only a bit left.  Then I got a small box of green beans and my half pound of BBQ pork.  The guy in front of me was ordering a duck.  He was not Chinese and ordered in English.  They had chopped up a duck and gave it to him but then he complained and said they didn't let him pick the duck he wanted.  The people behind the counter, who didn't know English very well, opened the box with the chopped up duck and said it's a very good duck but he kept on insisting he didn't get to pick his duck.  Eventually, they gave in, and let him pick his duck and chopped it up for him.  Then they tried to sell the guy behind me the chopped up duck.  Anyways, the whole time I was there, the lady behind the counter kept asking me if I wanted anything else.  I think she asked like 10 plus times.  Seriously.  It was around 5pm so I guess they wanted to make sure they sell all their food.  So after paying $12 for green beans, tofu and BBQ pork, I discover upon returning home that I lost $5.  And I'm pretty sure I dropped it as I was paying.  I was carrying my son in the left arm and had a little trouble getting cash out of my wallet.  Anyway, so I am $17 poorer since that place does not take credit card.  That would be all fine if the food was good.  The BBQ pork and green beans were fine but the deep fried tofu I had was gross.  I ate about two pieces of it and noticed it tasted kinda funny.  I gave two cut-up small pieces to my 16 month old son and he ate the first piece that had no meat in it but immediately spit out the piece with some meat.  My husband had a piece and he said it tasted funny and he's really not that picky about food.  So I heat up another piece thinking maybe it tastes funny because it's cold but I end up spitting it out .  The meat was gross tasting and the tofu tasted old.  In the compost bin the rest of it goes.  It was definitely not fresh.  No wonder she kept trying to sell it and pass it off to me.  Ugh!  I will not return.  There are other places I can get BBQ pork from that has much better service.", "author": "Christina H."}

On the other hand, it had too much juice, and was lacking the crispy skin that I usually enjoy with roast duck. It also seemed a little under cooked. The service at this place was horrific! They told me there were no plates even though there was a stack of plates right behind the woman who was telling me there are no plates. When I asked for chopsticks, you'd think I had insulted the waitress from her reaction. Absolutely ridiculous. I had some veggies on rice for $6.95 which seemed like a lot and some of the veggies were smothered with a very sweet sugar like sauce which ruined the taste. Overall, I wouldn't return.", "author": "Eater S."}

I came here under recommendation of a friend who once served me steamed chicken with ginger sauce. It was soo good that I had to know where he bought the chicken. After feeling so ill 2-3 days in a row, I dreamt of eating the same chicken, made a trip down this small hole in the wall place only to find myself standing in line for close to 30min. The chicken was cheap 6-9 bucks for a whole chicken (cost is equivalent to weight measurement of the item). I was stunned to find a line, then again it may just be the day's event. The chicken tasted just the way I had it last and i will definitely come back again for another because of the price.", "author": "Ateh M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-01-11", "description": "Upon arriving at this crowded little sit in restaurant, we see a bunch of ducks hanging in front of the window.  There was one duck that was particularly smaller than the rest.  It was about 2/3rds the size of the rest of the ducks.  The people ordering the ducks to go while standing in line didn't mind, because they had a watch over which duck they were receiving.  \n\nThe menu for the sit-in price is a dollar more than the to-go price for the barbeque, but  that's no big deal since one assumes that they're paying for the use of the dining table and utensils.  The problems with this setup however is that you don't see that they serve you the smallest duck that no one wanted in the to-go line, so you're essentially paying more and getting one third less.  The lesson here is, don't order the duck while sitting in.\n\nNow the real problem comes from another dish that we ordered.  We had a shrimp dish with vegetables.  One of the vegetables was broccoli.  This one broccoli we had was so bad that it look like mold was growing in it.  This is the reason for the one star.", "author": "Cheng X."}

For my first time here, my friend said to order the roast duck and BBQ pork over rice. It comes with some cabbage. Yep, my friend was absolutely right because every time I have come here, thats what I have ordered, nothing else. It is that good. I have had roast duck from just about every where in San Francisco and this place stands out as number one. I want to try other things on the menu but I can't pass up the roast duck.\n\nFOOD:\nThe roast duck and BBQ pork is outstanding and irresistable here. I have not tried anything else. I will update this review if I try something different.\n\nSERVICE:\nIf you dine-in, service is hurried because they are busy and they have a very small staff to serve many customers. People can mistake this service for rudeness. Know what you want and order everything at the same time. Don't expect too much here.\n\nAMBIANCE:\nA small place with only about six tables with seating crowded together. Tables and floors are sometimes sticky and greasy. Roast duck and BBQ pork can be seen hanging in the window. For some people from different ethnic groups, seeing  the duck or a roasted pig's head may cause you to lose your appetite. Customers waiting in line to order take-out stand along side the tables.\n\nPRICE:\nRoast duck and BBQ pork over a bed of cabbage and white rice with a soda will run you about $7.50.\n\nFINAL NOTES:\nThis a busy place with a steady stream of customers. There are metered street parking in front if you're lucky to get one. It is directly across the street from the Safeway supermarket.\n\nTHE ROAST DUCK IS TO DIE FOR AND YOU WILL BE IN HEAVEN!", "author": "David D."}

The Beef Chow fun was barely adequate, chicken wings had a strange odor, the Spring rolls were tasteless and the scallops in the Seafood chow fun had a weird taste.

Put on your game face, get what you came for, and go eat it.  What about the food?  The duck.  The duck.  The duck.  Did I mention the bomb duck?  This is what keeps me coming back.  They have the best roast duck around, and never second guess that.  Just read the reviews of other Chinese BBQ joints.  Inevitably, they all get compared to Cheung Hing.  The roast pork with crispy skin and BBQ pork are also great.  If you're feeling a little more adventurous, then order some of the BBQ duck livers.  I haven't really had the other dishes there, just the BBQ.  If you're going for duck, get there early and wait in line.
