The hostess kept me informed about our wait, and I really appreciated it.  \n\nThe food is not your typical Italian restaurant - there's no chicken parm on the menu, but more nuanced specialties.  I had the pork medallion special, sauteed in madeira sauce with artichoke hearts, and my bf had the gnocchi in a tomato cream sauce. A glass of red wine and a Caesar salad completed the meal. \n\nThis was the second time I've been here, and never been disappointed.", "author": "Jenn C."}

I chose it by reviews on here and we weren't disappointed. It is right on the edge of Little Italy and China Town. The awning on the outside worried us. The outside of the restaurant needs TLC, but once you're inside, you forget that. \n\nOur server was so friendly and knowledgeable about wines and the menu. He made the experience so wonderful. Inside, it looks like an old school place with white table cloths and it's quaint, dark, and cozy. The food went along with this theme and that's a good thing! We shared a veal/eggplant special (our favorite), the gnocchi's-award winning and awesome, and cannelloni. The cannelloni had a flavor in it that I wasn't super fond of, but that's my fault because they're filled with chicken and prosciutto and I took a chance on liking the prosciutto. The sauces on our dishes were so flavorful, we just couldn't stop soaking it up with our bread. The focaccia bread they serve is phenomenal! It was baked with fresh herbs and was so light and moist.  \n\nOf course we saved room for dessert and you should too! They have at least 12 desserts! We got the spumoni-of course and the Tartufo. They were both worth saving room for!", "author": "Karen S."}

But let's start with what was good. \n\nThe kid at the next table had spaghetti with tomato sauce and it looked and smelled awesome. Simple dish done right.  There is an artistry to getting easy things right, and there it was. Poor kid though, she was bored to death. She kept looking at me with \"please, please pull the fire alarm\" all over her face.  Sorry little one. You're gonna have to save yourself. \n\nThe wine list was low end and we should have just had cocktails.  Won't make that mistake again. Instead we ordered what turned out to be a very pedestrian bottle of chianti. Whatevs. Not a tragedy.  We shouted over the incredibly loud noise of the dining room and agreed it was drinkable if not notable.  Did I mention how loud it was in there?  It was very hard to hear each other speak. \n\nWhich reminds me ... Italian. I dont speak it except for polite greetings, responses and inquiries. So to me it sounds like it has two settings, making love and having a fight. Just an observation. \n\nThe food we ordered - the award winning gnocchi and the special ravioli - were both entirely fine, but not special. Satisfying in a red sauce kind of way. We passed on desert. \n\nTo summarize: okay food, meh wine, too freaking loud.  Too many other options to give this one another try. \n\nThe waiter, though. Five stars.", "author": "Quinn A."}

I usually don't love gnocchi, but it was really good in the tomato cream sauce and not too doughy. The pesto was also creamy, yum yum.

After doing some searching we came across Firenze. We called to make a reservation about 30 minutes from the time of the call and had no issues. When we arrived we found ourselves in a classic Italian type of setting. A bar immediately when you walk in and a dining room to the left. The dining room is filled w/ numerous tables for seating. It's decorated w/ bottles of wine along the walls.\n\nOur server quickly greeted us and shared the specials. He, along w/ the rest of the staff, would continuously check on us throughout our meal. We had some trouble making choices of what to eat, but had a good idea. When we asked what some of the best options were, our server mentioned two of which we were leaning towards.  \n\nPAPPARDELLE TOSCANA - Large Noodles in Rabbit Sauce \nI was REALLY excited about this due to loving rabbit. Although this states on the menu 'award winner', I didn't taste it. I felt there wasn't enough of the sauce to noodle portions. I had to even ask for more sauce. \n\n\nGNOCCHI FIRENZE - Potato Dumplings in a Light Tomato Cream Sauce\nAgain another 'award winner', however my girlfriend who absolutely LOVES gnocchi wasn't feeling it. She said although it was like little pillows. They were larger pillows than what she's had before and it too lacked flavor. \n\nIt's easy to get lost in a corner of this place w/ your sweetheart.

Both noodles were far from al dente and the pappardelle were falling apart at a lift of the fork. I wish I could say that the mushrooms and tomatoes redeemed the rest of the dish, but they were not special either. I've had better sundried tomatoes from Costco.

My boyfriend had family and friends in town, and they wanted to get dinner, so we left the restaurant decision up to them. I would have just Yelped something, but it's nice to be the one who goes along with someone else's suggestion once in awhile. And what a suggestion this was! Firenze by Night was a fantastic choice, and even though we were baffled by the usage of two languages in the name, we thoroughly enjoyed our experience there.\n\nReservations were made, which I believe is necessary based on how crowded this restaurant was. It's best to arrive close to on-time since there isn't much room to wait around. There's the bar, but if you have a large group of people, you'll probably be in the way. Anyways, we were eventually seated, and our suave Italian waiter wooed us with his knowledge of the food and beverage menu.\n\nWe started with an excellent red wine and eventually ordered our food. The bruschetta was alright, but the gnocchi was to die for. So good! Perfect to share amongst everyone at the table. For my entree, I was torn between a few dishes but ultimately got the Linguine Alla Paolo, which has garlic, anchovies, red chili flakes. WOW. I would venture to say that this is one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. It was definitely on the salty side with the anchovies, but I would highly recommend it. In fact, everyone seemed to enjoy their food, so I don't think there's a \"wrong\" decision when dining at Firenze.

This isn't a place that will give you earth shattering and creative flavors (think Barzotto or Flour + Water), but it will deliver those time-tested truly Italian sauces in a warm environment :). \n\nWe stopped here on a Wednesday night and found it wasn't particularly busy, so we didn't face a wait. Our server was so friendly and attentive and boy did I love the decor! Dangly Christmas-like lights all around that provide little warm glows amidst the dim ceiling lighting. (Pretty solid vibes for a date night!)\n\nThey started us off with fresh focaccia bread served with olive oil in which you could add crushed pepper and salt to make your own blend. The bread was warm and heavenly. Just be sure to not eat too much or you will fill yourself up before you get to the delicious pastas!\n\nWe ordered three pastas and decided to stick to classics: the Firenze Gnocchi, Capellini Pomodoro, and Pesto Fettuccine. The gnocchi is definitely their star dish. As other reviewers describe it, it really does consist of little pillows of love. It is perfectly light and served in a heartwarming tomato sauce. I loved this dish and found the portion size to be great. The Pesto Fettuccine was also fantastic, with a more creamier Pesto sauce and Fettuccine cooked al dente. I'll describe the Capellini Pomodoro using one word - fresh. The sauce tasted like it was just made, with ripe tomatoes and a good amount of basil. \n\nWe left Firenze by Night feeling satiated - tummies full and heart warmed.

On a summer episode of Check Please Bay Area, this old time restaurant (since at least the '90s) serves quality pasta in SF's famed North Beach for over twenty years and counting.  This was my choice for a  birthday dinner in late August for our rousing group of twelve on an early Friday evening.  We were given a long table in the rear dining room and were the first diners in the restaurant.  Being a big party gave us a better opportunity to try more things, but here's what I tried:\n\nAppetizers (all shared)\n1) Bruschetta (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=5G7E_GwdEDduaqhmgFJWPg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Spoiled by living in the Bay Area, we have year round fresh ingredients such as tomatoes which were the star of this app.\n\n2) Risotto ai porcini (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QKK7eQIf_L1Nl4AnIIE3AA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - You know it's good when you wish this was your entr\u00e9e instead of an appetizer.  The mushroom flavor shined!\n\nEntr\u00e9e\n3) Gnocchi Firenze (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=dvLF6OKprAEUFdcvRiFIwQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - The most famous of their award winning pasta dishes, this did not disappoint.  Simple ingredients but, as so many diners aptly stated, literally \"pillows of love\".\n\nOur waiter was enthusiastic and helpful in guiding us in ordering our dishes so that we could enjoy their more popular dishes.  Since it was a birthday dinner, he also brought a candlelit dessert that we shared.  Since everyone was very health conscious (including me with another dinner party the following day), this was enough to satisfy us.  \nBy the time we prepared to leave, the restaurant about seventy five percent full with many locals, given the greeting from the waiters and host.\nI later saw the above episode rerun and learned that their Caesar's salad was touted by one guest as \"best I've ever had\".  \nGuess there's yet another reason to come back.", "author": "Mike C."}

We went during the dinner rush on a Friday and were seated immediately in a cute room with pretty murals and little string lights making the setting very romantic. The waiter brought out complimentary bread (focaccia and French) which were both good, even better that they were free ;). We ordered the gnocchi ($19) and the papardelle with rabbit sauce (both creamy red sauces). I believe the gnocchi was house made because of how tender and fresh it was, the most authentic gnocchi I've had in the states. There was also the perfect ratio of sauce to pasta which rarely ever happens. The papardelle ($19.50) was cooked al dents and the rabbit sauce was actually pretty light and delicious. Finished everything with the ricotta cheesecake which was completely worth $9. It was very light and creamy, perfect ending to a pasta filled dinner.

Entrees were\nstuffed trout, veal, Quail in Barolo Wine Sauce and Roasted Chicken with Mushrooms, Garlic, Rosemary and White Wine. We ordered a selection of deserts all excellent.

Let me start off by saying that this experience was the highlight of my trip to San Fran.\nI have never - ever - had authentic, gourmet, Italian food, that got me in and out of there in less than an hour and a half! We were in a rush, so it was perfect.\n\nMy group of 5 came in just at the right time, as we had no reservation and they literally had 1 table available to fit us. As we were seated, we were in awe of the atmosphere. Romantic, yet perfect for an evening out with friends.  Our server's name was Michael Pacini and he was immediately very warm, welcoming, and his Italian accent was adorable! So accommodating!\n\nTwo of our group ordered the Special Meat plate of the day (of which I, of course, forgot what it's called), which was basically veal wrapped in proscuitto, served with veggies and polenta, and also the seafood pasta special, equipped with clams and shrimp.\n\n The special meat was aromatic, very delicious, and melted in your mouth. Those flavors!\n\nThe seafood pasta special was...ok. it definitely need a little more seasoning but it was edible.\n\nThe rest of the group ordered the two award-winning plates to share: the Gnocchi and the Papparadelle Toscana (Rabbit Sauce). Oh man....one bite in and we immediately knew why they were award winners! The flavors were bountiful, the texture superb, and I just couldn't believe all this was prepared in less than 20 minutes. \n\nI swore I would come here, every time I was ever in the Bay from here on out. If you've never been, you'll definitely want to. All this and our bill only came out to $88! For 5 people to get stuffed!!\n\n5 - stars for Firenze all across the board. I can't wait to come back here!", "author": "Michelle M."}

This restaurant is not just a business he owns, it is an extension of himself.  He's naturally hospitable, too.  If you come in more than once, he'll remember you, perhaps shake your hand or sit at your table for a moment, & make sure everything is to your liking.  Who doesn't want to be treated like that?\n\nThe steak.  Italian style meat & potatoes is a must here.  Remember this is old school, though.  It's different from, say, a steak at Alexander's or Boulevard.  This is more on par w eating at your nonna's house.\n\nThe gnocchi.  Sergio nailed this dish decades ago.  They are pillowy, tasty, creamy, perfection.  An indulgent dish to revel in.  Worth every calorie.  Diet tomorrow.\n\nThe escargot.  Ooh la la.  The garlic, olive oil, & caper sauce they are prepared in is fantastic.  I eat extra bread just to sop up every bit of these dreamy drippings...a lot of extra bread.

I lived in Italy and have Florentine relatives and I know that this food just wouldn't pass muster with them. The \"ribollita\" soup, which is an absolutely delicious classic Tuscan dish -- just wasn't at all ribollita. The waiter confessed that it was actually a \"minestrone\" but it tasted like it was out of a can!  On the other hand,  the pleasant surprise was the gnocchi and its flavorful sauce -- very delicate and tasty. The seafood with squid ink pasta was overly fishy  -- not great.

I had seen it before on Yelp and it served typical dishes that we tried in Firenze so we booked it. The owner was really nice and since I know Italian it was a pleasure to speak a few Italian bits with him, he reminded me so much of my dad - filled with energy. What a character. We had booked a table for four (this place is only open for dinner by the way) and we arrived 15 min early but the owner wouldn't sit us until the full group showed up hahaha - I thought this was very original because most places will usually make you sit right away. But we didn't mind waiting. He saw me being a bit tired so he decided however to make us sit before our friends actually showed up (which was like 5 min later). We had a nice table. The interior design is really beautiful and not pretentious at all. Nice decor, art and tables have space between them which is nice. The place was absolutely full and buzzing. Between the four of us we ordered the bruscheta (which was normal but heavy on the garlic a bit), a Chianti bottle of wine (which was bit vinegary but I guess most chiantis are like that, suggest to try a different wine) ravioli della mamma which were really nice, risoto porcini (which was fabulous, my God the taste of porcini was insane), veal saltimboca ( a real winner) and sadly I went for the pappardelle toscana with rabbit sauce but have to say it was a let down - the ratio of pasta versus sauce was not in balance, there was way too much pasta and way too little sauce and it felt watered down in terms of taste. Overall I had a lovely experience so will definitely be back to try more dishes. We ended it with the truffle chocolate ice cream which was soooooooooooooooo good!!! Bon Apetito :) The staff was very friendly and the owner came to check on us couple times during our meal and at the end so that had a nice touch since the place was so busy.

Much to my delight, they didn't insist I take a seat at the bar and did offer me a table. I asked the host about the gnocchi and she told me about two sauce choices that aren't even on the menu and raved about the tomato cream sauce. My server was quite attentive and nice and when I asked him for his gnocchi recommendation, he immediately said the pesto sauce. It's all homemade, along with the pasta so I gave it a try. My server even recommended a wine to pair with my gnocchi. Sold!\n\nAll in all, I didn't feel rushed and everyone was great, checking in on me to see how I liked the food, etc. Even the host got in the mix when she saw the sauce I'd chosen. \n\nPrices are reasonable.

It was a little difficult to eat as the ice cream kept sliding away from our spoons. \n\nService: we had such an affable, affectionate waiter.

The hostess chased my girlfriends and I down a block after we left the restaurant claiming that we \"never paid\" and left only \"$5\". \n\nHold on! We used 3 debit cards to pay, left three signed receipts, and showed our own receipts that we paid. The hostess did not sincerely apologize for the mistake... or the fact that we felt embarrassed as passer-bys stared at us. We went back into the resturaunt to speak with the \"manager\", and the same hostess greeted us with a \"whats up\". WHAT DO YOU MEAN \"WHATS UP\"? You just chased us down and made a scene. Way to treat your customer. She claimed she was the \"manager\" as well, and was very defensive about the situation. Great. More reason to call her out-- Her name is Nadia.\n\nHere's why I think they chased us down: Because we left a $5 tip for our waiter. Our waiter (1) forgot to bring us complimentary bread (even though tables that arrived after us were given some) (2) when we asked for garlic bread (since we weren't being served ANY bread), he adamantly said they don't carry any with an attitude (3) he would splash water all over us when he refilled (w/o picking up the glass) (4) he seemed to rush us out of the restaurant as he put the check right in the middle of our 4-person table. Weird. \n\nHe anxiously stood by our table as we left to pick up the check book. Obviously the waiter wasn't too happy with his tip, told the \"manager\" we ditched on the check, and she claims it was a \"mistake\" that they couldn't find the THREE signed receipts that was left IN THE SAME CHECK BOOK AS THE $5. Yeah right. \n\nWe're 4 girls, in our mid-20s, with well-paid jobs. I've never left such a small tip before. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS. \n\nTo Nadia--- A customer should never leave your restaurant feeling embarrassed, or even have the entire dinner party go onto Yelp to write such bad reviews; I wouldn't have done this if you didn't make a scene-- Double check before you accuse your customer!!

Very Italian. Says bye to every group leaving like he knows them. Each time I asked him about my reservation or the menu he got closer to me and more physically intimate. First he held my hand and rubbed the inside of my wrist. Next time he put his hand on the small of my back. Next time he got a little too close for comfort. \n\n3) The decor! Ugh! Tacky tacky all the way. Reminds me of those Carnival cruise ships that haven't been redecorated since the 70's. There's a painted blue sky, a fake Michelangelo statue, a fake skyline of Pisa or some Italian town, and fake vines running along the ceiling. My eyes were in pain.\n\nI guess I'll talk about the food, though they really didn't make up for the ambiance at all.

My friends and I had an overall \"fine\" experience at this restaurant, but I expected a lot more based on the Yelp rating and everything I had heard about North Beach dining. Unfortunately, we left extremely underwhelmed.\n\nCraving Italian, we had decided to find a cute spot in North Beach. We did some walking around and 'menu shopping,' and settled on this restaurant, glad there was no wait. Not knowing anything about the spot, I asked the host (half joking) how he felt about the restaurant and if we should eat there. His response? \"Well, you're here now - might as well sit down.\" Without another word he plopped our menus down on a table and walked off.\n\nFirst impressions: The ambience is kind of boring and outdated. The tables are a little close together for comfort. And everything feels like it hasn't been updated in forever. Sure, they may consider it part of the old-Italian charm - but when your menus are printed pieces of paper under torn, dirty plastic... I'm not sure I'm buying into it.\n\nOur waiter was nice enough, and had a very authentic Italian accent. Definitely scored some points on that front, however he was not particularly helpful with the menu and his visits to the table were infrequent at best. Several times throughout the meal we were left waiting, searching for refills on water, parmesan cheese, and we waited especially long after our plates were cleared before he came back to offer dessert or the check. In fact, he didn't actually OFFER us either of those things - we had to flag him down eventually, signaling we wanted to leave from across the room.\n\nThe food is FINE but very overpriced for what you get. I paid $8 for a salad that was a few bits of mixed greens, a couple shreds of carrot and 2 quartered grape tomatoes. I expected more from the pasta dishes, but they were cooked 'just alright,' with nothing memorable about them, except for the fact that my fettucine with tomatoes and mushrooms kind of tasted like Chef Boyardee. My boyfriend's artichoke chicken was overly salty, and the other two dishes we had were decent - the gnocchi and the melanzane both worth eating but small on the portion size, and the eggplant (melanzane) really should have come with a side of pasta or something.\n\nIt is possible I'm spoiled by Boston's North End, but I certainly won't be back to overpay for a mediocre Italian meal at this spot. In fact, I'm a little jaded on North Beach in general... but I'll keep exploring.", "author": "Catie F."}

Firenze by Night seemed a good fit.\n\nWe stopped by one evening for dinner and the place is cute, cozy, with some nice indoor lights. We were seated at a small table too close to the kitchen (noisy corner). I asked the host if we can be seated somewhere else and he said \"no\", they were waiting for bigger parties.\nWe realized that this place is better for bigger parties, not for couples out on a date or smaller groups.\n\nWe weren't thrilled, but stayed. Got some bread from the house (nothing great) that we dipped in olive oil and a couple of glasses of Chianti ($8 a glass). The waiters are Italians, that's nice. \n\nI ordered the Tortellini Alla Romana (w. peas and prosciutto) and my husband got the Cannelloni Biagio (pasta stuffed w. chicken and prosciutto, ricotta in a marinara sauce). The waiter told him that his dish would take longer to make (30 min.) since it's made from scratch. We were cool w. that. No rush, we were on vacation. But they brought the food very fast, too fast. So, way less than 30 min, maybe 10?  \n\nThe food was good, but nothing outstanding. We skipped the dessert. The waiter was lingering too much around us, but when my husband wanted to pay the check, somehow the host picked it up. The host gave us the wrong change (less than was owed), when my husband went to ask him, he was denying he took care of it. Then some manager (I guess) got involved, the host came back with the explanation \" these new bills stick together\" and brought the actual change (more).\n\nThe meal was the most expensive that we had while we were in San Francisco (this place is the only one that is more expensive than their online menus- with 2-3 dollars more for each item) and it was the least satisfying meal we had on our trip. It wasn't bad, but we didn't enjoy it as much as we hoped. The place lacked  atmosphere, we didn't feel welcome and felt a bit hassled, taken advantage of rushed out and didn't enjoy the \"bill incident''. I wouldn't come back to this place!", "author": "Jo S."}

My brother had the veal which was paper thin and flavorless. \nSince we were there celebrating a birthday we got a piece of Tiramisu. We all dug in and we all made the same face. It was so fucking disgusting I had to spit it out. \n\nService is another area that was just bad.  10 guys running around and they seem really busy but we didn't get much attention at all.  We had to ask for things like butter for bread multiple times. When we sat, the server over us bottled water or pelligrino. We declined and one of us ordered clubs soda and we were charge $3.50. I know it's not free but a little insane, especially when we paid almost $30 an entree for jar quality Italian food. \n\nThe owner was also very strange, drinking at the bar.

Since this is Holy Week I ate here tonight the day before Good Friday. In Anthony Bourdain's pilot episode of \"No Reservations\" he asked if you were on death row what would you last meal be. My last meal is already mentioned on my Yelp profile however in keeping with the Italian theme I know what my last Italian meal would be.\n\nI browsed through the website and knew what two I wanted to order: 1) gnocchi firenze 2) bistecca alla fiorentina. When I got there the waiter mentioned one of the specials tonight was the swordfish steak. I've had their swordfish steak here before and it is the best I ever had. I had to be disciplined and stuck with my original choices. And of course I had to have a glass of Chianti. \n\nIf you are craving for meat and potatoes come here for the Italian version. Their gnocchi heads down the best I ever had. Most gnocchis I've had in the past were heavy. Not here as the gnocchi is very light. It is like eating small pockets of pillows. Use your bread to wipe of that red sauce from the gnocchi because it's delicious. The only downside was the bistecca alla fiorentina but that is my fault. Most of the time I like to order my steaks rare. This time I ordered medium rare. Maybe it's been a while since I ordered a steak medium rare because I felt the steak wasn't red enough for me. However the steak was tasty and moist. Why do I like my steak rare? It's because you can really taste the flavor of the meat. The one pet peeve I have is when people order their steak to be cook well done. Having the steak well done kills the flavor of the meat. In addition if you are going to have your steak well done you might as well eat out a GILF. \n\nOverall I had a very good \"Last Supper\" dinner.

Now, I've eaten in various establishments in North Beach many different times during my visits to San Francisco but I had never heard of Firenze by Night so we decided to give it a shot. We are sooooooo glad we DID!! When we arrived, the place was super busy and, since this was a last minute suggestion, we didn't have a reservation. We were greeted warmly by Nadia who was able to secure a table for us relatively quickly. Fausto was our server and he was awesome. He helped guide us through the menu as well as the wine list and was patient and courteous. Fausto was SPOT ON with his suggestions and we savored every delicious bite! As busy as the place was, you wouldn't think Sergio, the owner, would have time to spend with a couple who lives about 1,800 miles away but you would be WRONG to think that. It was almost like spending an old school Sunday Italian dinner at my mother's house!

My fiancee found the place as we were told in SF, Little Italy is the place to go for real Italian food. We did a yelp search and this looked like a great place to check out.\n\nMy fiancee being vegetarian and the carnivore I am, the menu was pretty well balanced for the both of us. We ordered the Insalata estiva, AMAZING! The salad was soo amazingly good...and the waiter was nice enough to split it for us on plates, rather than us doing it ourselves. For dinner he ordered the Gnocchi that was award winning -- and it WAS award winning. I think I ended up eating more of his plate than I did mine. :-) I ordered the tortellini dish. The pasta was okay, I didn't think there was anything special about it, but the cream sauce and the prosciutto  with it, was solid. I probably would order another dish...probably the Gnocchi if I'm back in town for a visit. \n\nThe atmosphere of the place is cozy and inviting. You can definitely dress casual or dressy here and not feel out of place. The staff is super friendly, which is so refreshing!

You walk in through the bar area to get through to the restaurant and it looks like a place straight out of a Spike Lee movie.  In the bar area, they have autographed pictures on the wall of all of the stars that have come through.  I saw photos of Sophia Loren, Robin Williams oh, and I actually saw Dustin Hoffman in person, he was there!!!  He peeked in the restaurant area from the bar area when we were having dinner.  It was packed!  I wanted to take a picture, but I didn't want to be \"that\" person, lol.  \n\nThe waiters speak Italian as do most of the customers, I noticed.  They turn the tables over as soon as the customers leave, so there's always new people coming in.  It's a well-oiled process they have going on there.  The food, oh the food.  Now I didn't take any pictures because it seemed like people put their phones away in there, was weird.  I was even looking to see if there was a sign prohibiting the use of phones because we didn't see any being used.  The iced tea was freshly brewed and already sweetened and it was delicious!  I could sit there all day and drink it.  Then they bring out the bread, sourdough and focaccia.  The focaccia was different and I hate to keep using the word delicious but dammit it was just that.  It had little bits of green onion and it looked like a pound cake.  I ate one piece and my honey ate the rest.  I was analyzing it and he was munching away.  We should have ordered more, but then the food came and omg it was... well, delicious.  I had the Tortollini alla Romana which was tortellini with peas and prosciutto in a cream Sauce.  This by far, was the best tasting pasta I've ever had.  Wow.  My taste buds were having a party!  It was a healthy portion, and I ate ever last bit of it, em hmm, sure did.  I thought I was going to take a little sumthin' sumthin' to go and eat a late snack later, but this wasn't the case.  The cream sauce was perfectly balanced and the prosciutto was stuffed in the tortellini and scattered throughout the dish as well, along with the peas.  It was a perfect combination of ingredients.  Willie had them fix a dish that was not on the menu, Fettucini with Bolognese Sauce.  He demolished it too, but he savored it and took his time eating, where I was speed eating I guess.  Shoot it was good, it is, what it is.  For  dessert, I HAD to get the Tiramisu and I was so happy I did!  It was so good.  The lady fingers were tastefully drenched in rum, and it held that rum!  He had the Spumone which, of course, is the Neapolitan Ice Cream.  The meal was spectacular, I loved this night, good food, great company and super romantic!  It has become my favorite Italian restaurant in the Bay Area.\n\nParking is scarce, but our hotel was in the financial district which is close to Chinatown, Little Italy, and Fisherman's Wharf, so we walked everywhere.  They also have all sorts of transportation available, cable cars, trolley, bikes, cabs, etc.  The ambiance is romantic and the wait staff was very kind, accommodating and quick!  Definitely will be back, great experience!!!", "author": "Lina F."}

These seem to be the two dishes they are known for so I would expect them to stand out a bit more.

When we asked again, the waiter pretentiously says they have bruschetta and not garlic bread. It's the same thing!!! All night we felt rushed, and had a very rude waiter.

He went on a little longer about how clean the cloth was and proceeded to run his hands over the stain. What I couldn't believe was how long he decided to spend with this cloth instead of acknowledging that it is dirty and simply removing it.\nNo apology and no offer to move us to a clean table. We were later offered to have the wait staff replace the cloths, but forget it. We're already seated, let's just make the best out of this and move on.\n\nAt this point, we've ordered our food and were chatting with one another.

He ends up spilling sauce all over my friend's jacket/back. - To be fair, they were quick to apologize to him and tried to clean my friend up quickly with dry towels.

The food at Firenze was good - we devoured it so fast that I can't even remember what we ordered. I am just left with a thought of that was tasty...But you should probably also know, we were starving.\n\nOverall, if I was already in the area and did not want to wait for another restaurant, I wouldn't mind giving Firenze another try.

Then I ordered the \"award-winning\" gnocchi, which was truly amazing. Each individual gnocchi was huge (the gnocchi I've had before are usually a little bigger than soy beans), but theirs are probably 3 times as big. However, the gnocchi was so soft, creamy and savory.

If I didn't get a Bloomingspot deal, I would have regretted spending that much money on the food. Each main dish is usually from $15 to $25, plus appetizer and dessert, you do the math.

I gave it a 1 star rating to contribute to bringing the overall rating closer to where I think it belongs.  There are so many places like this on Yelp in San Francisco, which show decent reviews that are totally unjustified.\n\nIn this case, the price to quality/value is misaligned.  It's way too expensive for the quality you get.  The tiramisu we ordered was previously frozen and had that freezer flavor and a stale crust to it.  Totally unacceptable.  The waiter was energetic and friendly, but when I brought this up to him he simply said it was fresh and didn't offer us another option, not did he remove it from the bill, which by then was already inflated with mediocre food.\n\nI regret going, and hopefully this review will help another person avoid this place.  There are just so many great places to try in the city, and it's a shame if you end up here because of these inflated reviews.", "author": "Salar S."}

We ordered the clam and mussel appetizer and the mussels in particular were incredibly fishy smelling and tasted like I licked a day old fish. The server noticed I was picking only at the clams and when asked, I told him the mussels were too fishy for me and he insisted on replacing the dish even though I was okay with just eating the clams. \n\nSo, of course, I was totally surprised when the server brought the dish to the kitchen and kitchen staff immediately began to talk shit in spanish LOUDLY about us!!!  My boyfriend even called out loudly, \"Hey, I speak Spanish, okay?\"\n\n\"Why did she order it if she doesn't like mussels?\" and then proceded to hear everything from \"P*ta\" to \"F*ck your mother\" in Spanish. My boyfriend speaks fluent Spanish and could hear every word from where we were sitting. \n\nWe were horrified and when the server returned, my boyfriend asked dryly, \"Is there a problem?\" The server denied the hostility profusely, and went back to tell the guys that we could understand every word they said. They stopped cursing, but kept on complaining!\n\nOur dishes came out and we just sat there in disbelief at what we heard. We were both horrified at our meal and what could have been done to it, yet unsure if they would mess with our food. Maybe they were just venting? Then kitchen staff kept coming over to glare at us, silently! One particularly bold one stared down my boyfriend from the little window and we decided then and there our dinner was over.  \n\nScrew this place with it's AWFUL people and bland food.

Next, for starters, we tried Antipasto Della Casa ($14.50) and Prosciutto e Melone ($9).  No premium quality stuff here.   Everything tasted like something I could get at Safeway.  Then comes Gnocchi Firenze ($13).  Award winning?  Which award?  It was not bad, but not that great.  One item which was pretty good was Linguine con Vongole ($13.50), which had the right amount of clam sauce with perfectly cooked pasta.\n\nAs for their decor, which looks like a half-hearted effort to create a scene in Italy, it reminded me of decor at Goood Frikin Chicken (http://www.yelp.com/biz/8TSk-heAZkXC2vO0yV0CQg).\n\nI am starting to wonder if it really is true that the best Italian Restaurants are not in North Beach.

The view of the city as we were driving around trying to find parking was amazing though. \n\nWhen we entered the restaurant, they happily greeted us and seated us promptly. Initially I thought the place would be moderately decorated - judging from the photos on yelp - but the ambiance was surprisingly really nice and romantic. My friend couldn't stop spazzing over our waiter's accent and all she wanted was for him to continue talking haha! Our waiter was really nice and funny. He was also very patient and took his time explaining everything to us.\n\nI ended up getting the Penne Mare E Monti and substituted the light tomato sauce with pesto sauce and ohhhhh myyyy goddddd!

They didn't tell us this, but after standing around and seeing others get seated that arrived after me, I caught on. Once we were seated, we could barely hear anything the waiter said since the main dining room was so loud. He got our orders of wine wrong and scurried off before we could correct him. I ordered the pappardelle with rabbit sauce since it boasted being an award winner. The presentation was simple and had small pieces of meat throughout the sauce, and the taste felt under seasoned. My boyfriend's chicken dish was nothing spectacular, and I also sampled some of the porterhouse steak which seemed more like an overly charred T-Bone in my opinion.

She want to have the gnocchi and we split everything, they even split the gnocchi into two different plates for us. The snail dish, though tasty, not worth the $11, since it was only 5 pieces of snail....\n\nStill attentive and still a big flirt, our server brought over  our main dishes came. I ordered the linguine with anchovies, red pepper fakes and garlic; my friend ordered the special of the day, a seafood linguine. I liked my dish, it was good, but i dont really think it was worth the $15. I tasted my friends dish, it was a little to fishy for me, the mussels were frozen not fresh, so it had a saltier taste than normal. \n\nWe skip dessert just because we were full, and neither has a really big sweet tooth.

Placed on the outer reaches of Little Italy, and tucked between a variety of other establishments this one may be easy to miss. But I must say it is worth seeking out. The front signage is simple, and when stepping inside it was quiet, fairly plain but oozing with charm. The dimly lit bar area is the first thing you see, but beyond that the cozy little dining room will call your name. The tables, covered in white linens and adorned with a bottle of olive oil that will eventually call your name. It was that good....and that was just the olive oil. Can you imagine? The three in my party ordered veggie lasagna (which was claimed to be the best mean in San Fran over the course of five days by my sister) the Gnocchi, and an amazing carbonara stule pasta. All three were packed with flavor and clearly made from scratch. The best kind. It feels like the place could have a mob meeting going on right in the back at any given moment.

The olive oil and capers were fine but I found the dijon mustard on the side to be too overpowering for the delicate raw meat.\n\nPappardelle Toscana:  One of the house specialties and lived up to being a decent dish.  Very hearty and satisfying noodles.  The rabbit sauce was full of flavor but light on the meat chunks.\n\nGnocchi Firenze: This was another house specialty, though not sure why on this one.  The gnocchi were limp and bland.  I'm beginning to favor the way some places pan sear the gnocchi to give it some texture (which is not done here).  The creamy tomato sauce also lacked any pizazz.\n\nTiramisu: Satisfactory.  Lived up to having the creamy zabaglione and moist savoiardi.  Could have had a stronger soaking on the savoiardi though.\n\nLimoncello: I asked if they had any house made limoncello and received this.  Wasn't chilled enough to really hit the after dinner spot.  Also, nothing wow about the flavor.", "author": "Adam B."}

Our hotel concierge recommend this place because he hadn't heard of the top two restaurants on Yelp.  So we decided to try this place, what the hell.\n\nWe were seated promptly-it was a rainy Monday and the restaurant was about 1/4 full.  \nWe were served by Giuseppe. He was wonderful. He took great care of us. Since our GD was very hungry he rushed an order of ravioli for her which was very nice.\n\nThey served us foccacia and sourdough bread with olive oil.  Have not had foccacia in a long time. Very soft and flavorful.\n\nI started with  the tortellini soup.  The tortellini were very good and the chicken brodo was flavorful\n\nI tried my wife's insalata Estiva which was basil, cheese, tomatoes, oil and onion. It was ok but not for me.\n\nLately I've been rating restaurants by the quality of the risotto.  I tried their risotto with porcini mushrooms. Very well prepared, the right texture just below al dente.  GREAT flavors and such a simple dish they did a wonderful job.\n\nI tried my GD's raviolis which were good. Spinach and cheese in a meat sauce.  The sauce was slightly bland but good. I just like a spicier meat sauce. But still good just the same.\n\nI got to try my the tortellini alla Romana which is a white cream sauce. I didn't try the torts again since I had them with my soup.  The cream sauce was excellent I would order that again.\n\nFor desert we had the chocolate mousse and the tiramisu.  The mousse was  great good flavors. The tiramisu was too sweet for my taste.\n \nOverall, this was an excellent experience. The server was great.  The majority of food I tried  was wonderful and we will be back to this place when in SF again.", "author": "Ralph T."}

It took me this long to finally write a review because I simply did not have as grand a time as I had expected.\n\nIt was a rainy night and we were afraid that parking would be a doozy but the owner/manager of Firenze was so nice that he signaled to my friend to park at their loading zone. V.I.P. bitches!\n\nWe had a party of 12 and we were seated in the back along with 2 other big parties with only one server. So understandably, the server was having a hell of a time taking orders, bringing water, etc. We got snapped at a couple times for asking for balsamic vinegar for our bread. I'm sure he didn't mean it - he was probably just overwhelmed.\n\nI was really looking forward to trying their food based on the great reviews. We started off with appetizers: carpaccio, 2 orders of bruschetta, mushroom something, and calamari. The servings were decent though not as big as I had anticipated. But they were good enough to get us looking forward to our entrees.\n\nI ventured off Yelp recommendations and ordered the veal since I'm a big red meat eater (there's a joke that I must've been a T-Rex in my last life because I have a big head, short arms, and only eat meat). I should've know I'd chosen the wrong dish for me when the waiter didn't ask me how I wanted my meat cooked. When the dish came out, I realized my veal was not a thick cut slab of meat but rather thin slices of meat that only had taste because of the sauce. At least it was a big serving. :/\n\nThere's a reason why they're known for their gnocchi though. It was deeelicious! Soft, big, delicate, and fresh. I would totally go back for a plate of that on a cold day. The other pasta in rabbit sauce that they're known for is pretty good too though my friend didn't like it. I think it's because she was plagued with the thought of bunnies being slaughtered. They were nice enough to take back the dish and whip her up something else though.\n\nThe dinner turned out to be quite pricey. I mean I didn't have to pay, being the birthday girl and all but still. I don't think I'll be coming back unless it's for the gnocchi.", "author": "Linh V."}

No one told me about the time constraint when I made the reservation in the first place, so they were RUSHING to get us out of here. And when I say rushing, I mean, throwing plates of desert on the table (this was the manager actually) and busboys were spilling water and ice on our meals because they were pouring water for us very quickly.\n\nDid they think we didn't notice? I expected an apology along the lines of \"We're sorry we're rushing to clear your table, yet this is the situation...\"\n\n2) We had a large group and spent close to $900 on the dinner, so you'd think they would have been more attentive and appreciative. Apparently not.\n\n3) I got up to use the restroom and I could have sworn some waiter or busboy whistled at me. Pardon me, but am I at a construction site or an Italian restaurant?\n\n4) Soon after we left, I realized they didn't serve one of the preordered appetizers, but they DID charge us for it. I guess they forgot to put it on the table.\n\n5) Looking around, I could tell the waiters were rushing with other customers too. It wasn't as noticeable because most tables had a party of 2-6 people.\n\n6) When we ordered tea, they brought 'warm' water and tea bags (I almost thought I was at a diner). They also forgot to bring tea for several guests until I pointed it out.\n\nIt saddens me to write this review because I loved this place. I really did. =/\n\n\n***PROS***\n- Good food\n- AMAZING waiter, he really tried to make it a nice evening for us, yet I guess he was pressured by the manager and the staff to hurry up and get us the heck outta there.\n- Pretty restaurant", "author": "Narina A."}

We arrived at 7:00pm on a friday night and were seated promptly.  We started with the stuffed mushrooms and the carpaccio.  The mushrooms were actually tender little meatballs stuffed into a mushroom cap in a dark sauce.  Not bad, but not that memorable either.  I regret to say that our order of carpaccio was the worst carpaccio was the worst ever tasted.  No flavor, completely tasteless.  I had the prosciutto melon, which was quite good.  the three others ordered the spinach and bacon and dressing salad that was simply that, a handful of spinach on a plate and drenched with warm bacon grease.  The kitchen must have forgotten all of the other components that should have been in the dressing (no pinenuts or brandy) seriously it was just warm bacon grease.  YUCK YUCK YUCK!\n\nMoving on to entrees, my friend had the gnocchis with pesto.  I have to agree with everyone else that they are the best gnocchis I have ever had.  I had the pappardelle and rabbit sauce which was good however the pasta was overdone.  Another friend had the cappellini pomodoro which he seemed to enjoy (he never shares).  My bf unfortunately ordered the pasta special which was a salmon bow tie pasta in a champagne sauce.  He did not enjoy it at all, it reminded us both of tuna noodle casserole with salmon instead.

As you can see by the following comments, the reviews are mixed. It is easy to take faith in a high number of good reviews; and make the plunge. With all of the amazing choices in the City, we should have selected another spot. The decor is outdated and in need of some refreshing. Based on the reviews, we were looking forward to a great welcoming atmosphere, superb food, and outstanding service.  None of our hopes were realized. With advanced reservations, we were seated on the bar side, and on a high traffic path. We waited twenty minutes (20) for water, and another fifteen for the wine to arrive. No, they were not particularly busy, as there were empty tables near us. Two patrons arrived well after us, (and even quite late for their reservation, according to their conversation with the server). Yet, our server began to take their order. Meanwhile, we were still awaiting the water. Our server was inattentive and absent throughout much of our meal. We had to make requests for items that should have arrived customarily at table. The bread arrived late. With the fame of delicious sourdough bread in the City, we were served dry and less than tasteful bread. The admired olive bread, was just ok, at best. Our server made no mention of the specials, which both of us would have made our entree selection. In his defense, he did help with an entree request. Most surprising, the owner, so praised during the TV review for his attentiveness, passed our table seven (7) times throughout the twenty (20) minutes, and made no inquiry as to what was occurring, or if we were in need of anything. Was his inaction, on our behalf, due to him being so busy? No. He allowed ample time to visit, at some leisure, at the bar with those whom he presumably knew. It appears if you are a friend/patron, seated at the bar, you will garner special outgoing attention. When we gently raised our concerns with the server, he simply giggled and blew us off, while making merely half-attempted excuses for being so blatantly remiss. The meal was average to good, but in no way was it exceptional, nor near the level of quality and skilled preparation comparable to other dining experiences we have enjoyed in the area. Oh well, on to the next. No doubt, this eatery has had stellar moments in its history. Unfortunately, it appears the owner has reclined--simply resting on his laurels.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-09-01", "description": "It was date night with the wifey. We were going to see a show down the street and I needed to find a good place for a delicious, but still romantic dinner. I read all the review exclaiming the authenticity here and decided to give it a try. I have refrained from eating West Coast Italian because I am very loyal to my East Coast pseudo-Italian-American roots. If you want authentic, they got it. But all in all, it really doesn't matter because the food is fantastic regardless. We had a reservation on a Friday night, so we just had to wait 5 minutes or so for the host to notice us. We were seated promptly by an extremely friendly and helpful American waiter (I point that out to say that we did not have an Italian speaking waiter as others have mentioned, but that did not detract from experience nonetheless). \n\nI immediately trusted our waiter for some odd reason. Maybe he just looked like he ate well, but I felt that I could take his opinion with confidence. He recommended the Italian sausage stuffed mushrooms over the mussels to start, which was an excellent pick. He recommended the Syrah, which was another hit. My wife couldn't decide between the gnocchi and the tortellini alla romana, so he suggested doing a split plate of both (still for $16!). I was trying to decide between the saltimbocca alla romana or the braised lamb special and he recommended the special for the hungry patron. Honestly, he was right on all counts. \n\nThe stuffed mushrooms were actually not greasy and came in the amazing savory and flavorful jus. The sausage was great. I am by no means a gnocchi connoisseur, but they were very soft and I believe I saw them aptly described as pillowy elsewhere. The tortellini were of course delicious and the sauce, to die for! However, the ginormous braised lamb shank was clearly the star of the show (even at $26). It was, as described, falling off the bone and so flavorful with a sort of mushroomy gravy. the polenta that came with it was very good also, although I did not get to eat much of it. \n\nWhat really set this place apart for me other than the food was the ambiance. It felts very homey from the moment we walked in. I felt like I was in a family-owned Italian restaurant, not some tourist trap with white table clothes and blue glasses. It felt very sincere. We did not have any complaints about the noise and carried on a casual conversation without any problems. All in all, this is a great place for a nice night out.

WITHOUT QUESTION!\n\nI've wanted to try Firenze by Night since some girls mentioned it on the Dirty 30 bus ride back to the Marina. I logged it on my \"places to try list\" and hadn't given it much thought since....BUT\n\na) I spent 12 days in Italy over the summer and have really been missing the entire experience- especially the cuisine AND\n\nb) Bloomspot had a coupon- $40 of food for $20 SO\n\nNaturally, the boyfriend and I decided to give it a shot on Friday night!\n\nUpon entering Firenze, I immediately felt like I was back in Florence..Well ok, not entirely. Firenze is on the brinks of China town, so it's more like eating Italian food in China...but the mural on the wall of Florence certainly added to the ambiance, as did the twinkling lights and the wait-staff saying \"Prego\" \"Bueno Serra\" etc... I loved it! Our server was friendly and attentive, and the ambiance is \"nice\" without being stuffy. Environmentally speaking, there's nothing about this place I don't like.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nPeju Sauv Blanc (Love, love, love Peju!)\nCeasar Salad (Good, but pretty standard as far as Ceasar's go)\nRibolitta (sp? Vegetable soup- this was delicious! I liked it more than the order I got in Florence. Apparently, this soup is a Florentine special.)\nPenne Pasta with Shrimp and Chicken- (this was delicious! the right amount of sauce, shrimp, chicken, and oh so flavorful!)\nLinguine with seafood special (I didn't have this but the boyfriend insures me it's his favorite pasta dish- EVER to date)\n\nWe will absolutely be back to Firenze!

The company's put us up in Rube Central down in Fisherman's Wharf, and we're desperate to avoid the overpriced seafood-huts on the waterfront jammed full of tour-bus hordes.\n\nOur previous venture into North Beach by foot led us to a slick-looking joint with undercooked pasta and a dining room with lots of empty seats.  To be perfectly honest, we were a little leery rolling up on Firenze by Night's old-school and slightly worn decor.  Our fears, however, were neatly dispelled.\n\nThe wine list is serviceable, with solid Italian offerings.  We made good with a not-unreasonably-priced bottle of Vino Nobile di Montepulciano.  Starters consisted of a nicely flavorful bruschetta, which was a pleasant surprise after having plenty of bland tomato topping on toast in the past, and a gorgeous plate of shaved Bresaola (cured beef) and arugula.\n\nAs an entree, I ate a dish of veal cutlets in a creamy pesto sauce.  The veal was perfectly cooked and tender, and the sauce was rich and flavorful without overwhelming the meat.  Roasted mixed veg and a bit of penne rigate with tomato sauce were served on the side, and were pretty forgettable.  My coworker's dish was a risotto with mushrooms, herbs, and roasted chicken that garnered high praise.\n\nService was good, even with all tables full.  We neither felt neglected nor rushed.

I made a reservation to be on the safe side for 8 pm after reading a few other reviews. \n\nWe enjoyed a leisurely trolley ride over from the hotel and walked around the area a bit, it is a very cute neighborhood in San Francisco's Little Italy. One thing my bf commented on is why is the Little Italy always next to the Chinatown? Of course we only have this opinion based on being from NY but I thought it was a good observation.\n\nI was very glad we made reservations, this place was packed by the time we got there. We were greated by a stylish older italian gentleman with a gray ponytail, pointed italian shoes and a $30,000 wrist watch...so I figured this might be the owner. He was extremely friendly as was our waiter, they seem to import these guys straight from Italy because you can tell english is not their first language.\n\nI asked the waiter a quick question about one of the wines being spicy he gave an enthusiastic \"YES\" and said that I didnt like spicy so then he said well itsa not so spicy and itsa very popular. I really don't think he understood what I was asking but we got a decent bottle of California red. One thing I did notice, the pricing of the food to the wine is disappropriate...they should have more of a variety of wines in pricing. It was either on the low end or the high end so we ended up getting a $45 bottle which wasn't to terrible but I would have preferred to pay $10 less considering the entrees there aren't over $20.\n\nWe decided to get two pastas and split an entree since we can't be normal and just get an appetizer and two entrees. So I had to get the famous gnocchi and he got a pepparadelle toscana which is just wide ribbon pasta in a rabbit sauce. We decided to split the veal saltimbocca after some hand signals the waiter understood what we were trying to do. \n\nThe pastas come out and at first we didnt opt for any cheese, after tasting both of our dishes we felt having some cheese would help it out a bit as both of our dishes were a little on the bland side. After adding a little bit of cheese to give it a bit of saltiness I thought my dish was great. The gnocchi were very light and fluffy and not dense so they had more of a melt in your mouth consistency, the sauce wasn't to bad either. My bf's pasta was good but mine was better, he didn't care for rabbit but the pasta itself was cooked perfectly. \n\nWe both enjoyed the veal dish which was not bland thankfully, I'd be a little worried after having proscuitto and fontina cheese in a dish and it still being bland. They split it for us and it turned out to be two good sized portions, the veal was pounded thin with a small layer of cheese and tiny slices of proscuitto, it came with a side of steamed veggies and some polenta which was very buttery.\n\nAll together the meal came up to about $100 without tip which isn't bad since half of that was the bottle of wine and we technically got three entrees. We enjoyed the ambiance of the place and the service so if we are in the area again we would go back.", "author": "Angela M."}

Good food, great service, fun atmosphere. Me and Hot Mike were trying to figure out where to go for date night and decided to give it a 2nd go around here.\n\nFor the most part, it was a fantastic evening. We were seated without much of a wait, the staff was really friendly and animated, lots of ciao bella's and italian which made me feel right at home. We had a corner table which was fine because we didn't want to be in the middle of the fray. Ordered a plate of antipasti, stracciatella, insalata di spinachi, gnocchi and a veal dish...oh and tiramisu.\n\nFor me the star was the stracciatella soup which was light and perfectly seasoned. The gnocchi were great as well but the problem came when the chef plated both the gnocchi and veal on one plate (we were sharing the two dishes so we each got a plate). They were separated by a very sad pile of over cooked vegetables (the usual suspects, broccoli, cauliflower and carrots) and the plate wasn't hot which gave us about 5 minutes to eat everything before it started getting cold.  The veal was completely forgettable and that sucks because veal isn't cheap.  Really disappointing actually :/\n\nTiramisu was great and I'm glad we ended on that instead of the veal.  All around, Firenze by Night was A-OK.  We had a fabulous time because it was cozy enough where we could easily hear one another, our waiter was really nice and we were the last customers to leave after closing (meaning we were having such a good time we didn't notice).  The food was okay.  I know there are better places to have a great italian meal in SF and I intend to find them the next time around.", "author": "Rachael B."}

My dining companion and I had a reservation for 8:30p on a Friday night. Since we anticipated it would be busy, we arrived 15 minutes early to check to see if the reservation would be honored and have a drink. We walked into the restaurant and it was extremely noisy. Not good. We checked with the host. Our table would not be ready at 8:30, we were told. They were running late. We took one look at the bar area. It was so crowded there was nowhere to even stand. So with that, I decided to use the ladies room. I walked back to the ladies room only to discover I was walking upon a very sticky floor. Then I discover the ladies room to be less than clean. This is getting worse, I thought to myself. Why would I want to eat here? I walked back up the hallway on the sticky floor, grabbed my dining companion and we walked out. That was the end of that. With all the wonderful restaurants in North Beach, we had no trouble finding another restaurant where we enjoyed fabulous Italian wine, delicious Italian meals and absolutely wonderful service in a very nice setting. And to top things off, the prices were much better than Firenze's prices which, by the way, are incorrect on their website. Those prices are way off. I don't know why they wouldn't post a current menu with current prices for their customers. In any event, that was how our evening turned out.

The Pappardelli and Gnocchi are both award winning dishes - and that speaks volumes in the streets of Little Italy.  The servers are very accommodating, they split up the pastas and didn't charge for any extras.  My favorite dinner item there is the Prosciutto and Chicken Cannelloni.  It couldn't be more flavorful, each time I bring a new friend to Firenze, I suggest the Cannelloni and they praise this dish every time.\n\nFirenze also has some unique dessert dishes.  Their sorbet is served in a frozen, hollowed out version of that fruit.  I've had both orange and peach.

OK, let's go!\"\n\nMatt made reservation (which is highly recommended) for the both of us, because the restaurant is constantly busy, especially during dinnertime. Matt had one of the specials, which is 24 oz. Porterhouse Steak Combo Meal. The meal comprised of a thick 24 oz. Porterhouse cooked medium-rare, like Matt wanted on his steaks; grilled vegetables and baked potatoes. The succulent steak was very juicy and teamed well with buttery and tasty sides. For $30.00, the meal was quite possibly one of the better meals Matt had in a while.\n\nWife had the other special, which was the Firenze Gnocchi. The $15.00 potato-dumpling dish was covered in a creamy and rich Tomato sauce and a side of tasty Garlic-bread with her dish. As evidence proved, the garlic-bread was loaded with garlic, wanna kiss her? (wait in line, damnit). She also had a very mild glass of Italian red-wine, which paired well with her meal as well.\n\nAnd yes, we can't conclude our meal without any dessert from this place, according to her suggestion. We wanted the Dessert special for the day, but the restaurant was out of that particular seasonal fruit in order to make the dessert. So we went right to the dessert menu and we split an order of the Cream Caramel Pudding and Ricotta Cheesecake. Both of the desserts were very appetizing, but extremely rich for Matt's sweet taste buds; so wife ending up eating 75% of both treats.

Luckily we got there a little early and they were able to squeeze us in (went to another local place for drinks - their bar was packed) a little later.

We started with the carpaccio, which was really good.  My friend and boyfriend hadn't tried it before and both liked it.  We also liked the mustard it was served with - I haven't tried it this way before and it was nice.\n\nFor dinner I had the veal saltimbocca - delicious!  Also loved the creamy polenta served with it.  My friend had the gnocci that they are famous for (never tried gnocci before) and loved it.

It was ok, I was hoping for some nice tomatoes since they are in season, but they were beefsteak hot house version.

Eating Italian in North Beach is like eating Chinese in Chinatown - tourist trap hell.  I know there had to be a few gems in the area and I think this is one of them.  First of all, it's off the main strip - blending in with its surrounding Chinese markets.  The service was very friendly - although, the waiter was hesitant to advise me on dishes to order - they even covered up the naked statue man's yoo-hoo (my direct line of vision...I didn't mind, really) with an Italian flag.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the gnocchi - omg, it was delicious.  I don't eat Italian too often so I don't know what \"bad gnocchi\" is but the sauce and texture was amazing.  The carpaccio (my spelling is atrocious) was cut very thinly - plain, but good.  I had some of my friend's linguini & clams...really, really good.  Their vegetable soup was just \"alright\" but why in the world would you get vegetable soup *unless you're my best friend Yi, who also orderd the tomato salad...which consisted of slices of tomatoes...hrmm*.  \n\nNow, I'm not usually a dessert person - but their tiramisu was insanely good as was their ricotta cheesecake.

The food arrived quickly and was very hot, and even though I was a to go order, they gave me bread (: \n\nThe reason why they get 3 stars, though, is because the food is not SUPER STELLAR. I should preface this with the statement that I just lived in Rome for half a year, so perhaps my idea of 'good' isn't fair for America. It's good, don't get me wrong, but I paid 33 bucks (not including tip) for tortellini and the ravioli, and they were both normal tasting.

The Ravioli (stuffed with spinach and cheese served in meat sauce) is probably the best Ravioli I've ever had. You can definitely tell that the chef hand made the shells and the way it melts in your mouth tells you the ingredients are slow cooked with TLC. Best part? We didn't feel like passing out or throwing up from heavy sauces afterwards - good sign.\n\nBad parts? I think most of this was personal preference, but I didn't expect the calamari to be served in a ceviche-style - raw and lightly sauced with a squeeze of lime served cold - I'm definitely used to the fried and battered kind.\n\nOverall one of the best Italian food experiences I've ever had. Definitely come here and enjoy some of the best authentic cuisine and a great atmosphere.", "author": "Jon H."}

The caprese salad was no different from me buying the cheese and tomatoes from the safeway and making my own. They didn't bother to refill my water (and there were 6 waiters and 2-3 busboys in a not so busy atmosphere) for 25 minutes.  The first dish I ordered, the \"special\" pasta with shrimp, clams, fish of the day, etc was disgusting. I could taste that the fish had been frozen for a few months. I sent that back and tried the famous gnocci. Ok, it was obviously microwaved as the center was hot but the surroundings were not. Also the sauce tasted exactly like Ragu with some powdered parmasean on top.\n\nBTW, I've had better gnocci in Edmond, Oklahoma. Yes people, OKLAHOMA. What is wrong with you that you think this gnocci is \"amazing\"? \n\nI would have been better off ordering pasta from a pizza hole in the wall. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  The Pelligrini place on Filbert and Columbus across from Da Flora (assuming you can't get into Da Flora) is much better.

YOU ARE WORSE FOR ITALIAN PEOPLE THAN JERSEY SHORE!\n\nYelp failed us on this one. Even with a discount voucher from Bloomspot, dinner at this place (we've walked passed it hundreds of times and will resume RUNNING PAST IT in the future after the fiasco of a dinner they served us last night !) couldn't muster up enough of a real meal with any flavor whatsoever for the two of us last night. \n\nWe knew we were in trouble when the $12 stuffed mushrooms caps arrived  - 5 tiny (and I mean tiny mushrooms - the kind you'd cut up for a salad) not actually stuffed but with an even smaller lump of tasteless meat (I think ground pork?) balled up on top - in a thick and tastless sauce. In most real restaurants 3-4 of these would count as a single properly prepared and stuffed mushroom cap ! Is it possible that they don't use garlic, oregano, grated parma cheese or pancetta? How else could these little turds on a plate taste sooooo bland and icky !? Yuck. \n\nAs we tried to figure out what these were I was left to face a wall with spackle all over cracks and uneven plaster that appears to have been a half-assed repair - yet it remains unpainted and ignored - so as to \"blend in\" to this tacky, and truely awful clip joint. The unpainted and plastered wall, right where the waiter kept placing a serving dish of grated cheese (apparently used to mask the poor quailty and lack of flavor of the food they will serve you here) was sign number two we were in DEEP Trouble. The entrees sealed the deal - making this the  CRAPPIEST MEAL we've eatten in a Long Time. Quite the award.\n\nEntrees included a \"special\" (anything but) of what we were told would be \"assorted seafood on linguini ($18)\" and then there was my \"veal and mushrooms\" ($21). The mussels on the seafood pasta dish (all 6 of them) were LONG PAST THIER SAD \"PRIME\" and NOT APPROPRIATE TO SERVE (read that as gummy / smelly / chalky and tastless except for the off flavor and texture they imparted to the whole dish) sitting atop the pasta and except for a few itty bitty bites of unknow seafood floating in the off-tasting, thin and TASTELESS red sauce - the rest of the shellfish (3 clams) were also off and spoiled tasting. My sad looking veal dish consisted of three of the thinnest portions of meat (they claim it was veal - it was hard to tell given the wierd texture due to pounding it so thin these lacked any firmness and flavor, absent mushrooms (there were stems only !?) and a smear of hard crusted over polenta - lacking any flavor whatsoever.\nOnce again - no seasoning whatsoever ?! HAVE YOU GUYS HEARD OF GARLIC, OREGANO, SALT ? \n\nThe good news - we didn't have to head to the ER this AM and except for the idiotic tourists that seem to fill this place - it is a SAD EXCUSE for italian food.

Tony's pizza nearby was too long of a wait so I wandered over to Firenze based on the good yelp reviews.  That was a really bad mistake.  Despite many good yelp reviews, I had a extremely bad experience.  The dining experience was so bad that I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.   \n\nLet's start the review on food.  We started with mushroom with italian meatball and clams and mussel in marinara sauce.  The mushroom with italian meatball was excellent and probably one of the better ones I have had.  The clams and mussels came with great reviews but was very disappointing.  The flavor was bland and the mussels were not fresh.  Moving on to the main entrees, we ordered the pasta with rabbit sauce and gnocchi with tomato cream sauce.  Both the rabbit sauce and the tomato cream sauce were good.  However, the pasta and gnocchi were overcooked and had no texture.  Good Italian restaurant usually serves pasta al dente and it was close to mush.  Minus 2 stars\n\nThe dining experience is also made up by the service experience.  As a rule of thumb, good service is judged by the waiter's attention to need.  If the patron asks for something, please do not make them ask multiple times.  One of the gals in the party asked for balsamic vinegar to go along with olive oil for dipping.  This may not be the Italian way of life but please don't make weird faces and have her ask again and again.  When the waiter came by to fill out the water, a baby cockroach was poured out from the water jar.  F=ING DISGUSTING!!!  I pointed out to the waiter and he said oh a bug must feel off from the tree.  Last time I checked this was indoors seating and there were no tree.  I was disappointed to how the waiter handled the situation.  There was NO apology and the issue was not addressed.   Life goes on.  When the main entree was served, one of the dish was missing.  When we asked about the salad, the waiter said there is no more salad.  Really?  Sounds like the waiter forgot to put int the order.  No apologies and gave a bad cover up for his mistake.  As soon as we finished the food, I wanted to leave.  Had to ask the check on several occasions and the waiter finally came after 20 minutes.  Minus 3 stars.\n\nMy overall experience was so bad that I would not come back again.

They also know some haunts I've never really noticed. Given how long they lived in San Francisco, I am surprised we've never made a ruckus in Firenze by Night. The place has been around since the '80s. The night we went, we met up with some old family friends who've been going there since it opened. This time they drove from Sebastapool for the occasion. \n\nWe arrived at 6pm on a Saturday before the place got slammed. The waiter had time to spend with us describing the dishes and point out who on staff that night was part of the family. \n\nI concur with the reviews which say the gnocchi and pasta are great. I truly have never had such good gnocchi in a restaurant. They were semi large, redolent of potato and semolina, not too chewy but not soggy and textureless either. Toothsome may be the right word. I loved them in their slightly creamy tomato sauce. The papardelle with a beefy ragu was also delicious. Five of us shared two plates of pasta as a primi and then had our own entrees. The osso bucco was very nice - fork tender and flavorful. The chicken with funghi was also very good. All entrees came with sides of tasty polenta and julien squash and carrot.\n\nI have read that a lot of tourists are sent here by local concierges. The place was packed with families and kids. Packed to the point, in fact, that our waiter actively discouraged us from getting dessert due to all the people waiting. The Italian family restaurant feel was evident in the crowd, the standard sides on the entrees, and the very good but - at the end - rushed service. On one hand it's nice to see a still-affordable good Italian restaurant that isn't \"trendy.\" On the other hand the only thing that would discourage me from returning is that I like to sit around talking for a long time after I finish my dinner with friends or family, and this is more of a turn 'em and burn 'em place. \n\nDefinitely stop by to try the pasta though - it really is worth it.", "author": "Roxmarie M."}

He wasn't friendly or flirty (which I almost would have preferred to deadpan) He was just blah, along with all the other bus boys waiting on our table.

We ordered the Antipastidellacasa (salami, a bologna-type meat, tuna with tomatoes/capers/onions, kidney/garbanzo bean/mushroom, pickled eggplant, pickles, frutti di mare), the award-winning gnochhi, the pappardelle con agnello (lamb), and a glass of chianti. Dinner was delicious! While the gnocchi wasn't as good as what I ate in Florence, it was no less delicious. The lamb ragu was delicious light and not too heavy. \n\nFor dessert, we opted for two cappacinos with a homemade tiramisu, and a dark chocolate tartufo with white chocolate in the middle. It was all very good.\n\nWhile it's not quite Italy, the ambiance was delightful.  We had to resist our urges to order acqua naturale, to say \"grazie\" everytime they said \"prego\" and \"buon appetito.\"  It brought us back - and that was all we could ask for.", "author": "Annie Y."}

The bruschetta as an appetizer was superb. Simple but perfect. Salads were good (nothing to write home about, but well-prepared) and cocktails were delightful. I had the gnocchi which was soft, pillowy, and generally delicious. My dining companions had the vegetarian lasagna, the eggplant dish, and the seafood penne. I will say that I thoroughly appreciate the number of vegetarian options.\n\nAnyway, my main complaint is that the service needs a bit more work to be truly great. We were seated right next to the bar, which was full of loud and already pretty drunk patrons. There really shouldn't even be a table here. When we were first seated, one of the members of our party couldn't actually sit down because there was a woman standing where his seat was. Basically, we got the worst seat in the house. And we had reservations! The door was also open and a freezing cold wind was rolling in until I got up to ask the host if we could shut it. Our waiter was very sweet and energetic but was not at the top of his game. He forgot a few things we asked for and there were a few otherwise awkward moments. It's not that he wasn't trying... but it just wasn't extraordinary service. \n\nFrom the other Yelp reviews it seems like this place suffers from inconsistency in service. Some people seem to love it, while others like me were a bit disappointed. I think this place has real potential -- it just needs to make sure diners' service and ambience is as great as their food.", "author": "Rachel S."}

This is part of the draw. It is a \"family\" operation. Everyone working there may not be related (I'm not sure) but they may as well be. It's always the same staff, and after coming in a few times - they'll remember you. They clearly take pride in their work and in servicing their customers.\n\nEnough about the people, how's the food? Spectacular! I can't say much for the regular menu because I always order a special. Sergio (owner) comes up with at least 5-6 unique specials a night. Last night I had Linguine in a garlic white wine sauce with mussels and scallops. Sounds ordinary, and it is a classic, traditional Italian dish - but executed to perfection. Fresh fish, properly cleaned shellfish (no grit), savory sauce, and fresh homemade pasta. That is what you can expect...traditional Italian dishes executed well. Any pasta dish on the menu is a homerun!\n\nOther classics are the gnocchi, quite possibly the best in the city! Not into pasta? They always have other meat or fish dishes on the menu, most memorable for me are Ossobuco and Braciole.\n\nAtmosphere is casual.

Each employee we interacted with was very happy, chatty, and clearly enjoyed working at Firenze.\n\n I went with my boyfriend and mom on a Wednesday and there was a short wait so we got 3 martinis from the bar. The bartender was great (Michael? I could be making that up)- really funny and a good guy. Of course my Russian vodka-loving mother complained that the martini glasses were too small but Michael made sure to make our drinks strong enough to satisfy her. The host (an older Fabio) was super friendly and sat us shortly after we got our martinis. He and my boyfriend got into a conversation and were laughing for a good few minutes- also seemed like a really good guy \n\nOur server greeted us right away and told us about the specials- they all sounded amazing so we all ended up getting specials instead of ordering off the regular menu- except for the clams and mussels in marinara sauce that we got as an appetizer. The app was probably my favorite part of the meal- the shellfish were very fresh and tender and we scarfed them down. For our entrees, my boyfriend and I split the swordfish and the beef wrapped in veal with mushrooms. Mom got linguini with mussels and scallops. All of the portions were huge and decently priced- but the food was definitely more in the 3-4 star range. The swordfish was incredibly overcooked and served with some bland broccoli, cauliflower and carrots. The beef wrapped in veal was decent, but I expected it to be on the rarer side and it too seemed to be overdone. Mom's pasta and shellfish were pretty good- she loves scallops and there were lots to go around in her dish. Our server was absolutely wonderful- just really light-hearted and attentive. My boyfriend kept telling me that he wanted to \"be his best friend\"\n\nService- 5. Like I said, everyone we encountered was absolutely awesome. The service was definitely unbeatable\nAtmosphere- 4.5. The place was really cozy and we loved everything about it. Just a really good place without any gimmicks, great place to go with friends or a date.\nFood- 3.5.

The ambiance and food combine to create one of the best restaurants in town.\n\nAs we entered the compact eatery, the young bartender was holding court, lubricating customers while locals dropped in for a quick, momentary pop at barside. The patter and joking ebbed and flowed naturally, comically, boisterously.\n\nWe joined the crowd in cocktails and waited patiently for our table - we had reservations for 8:30pm, but this was a Saturday night and the place was packed. We were seated by 8:45pm and the charming Sergio must have apologized to us 4-5 times during the course of the evening for our having had to wait and thanking us for our patience.\n\nAbout the food: We started simply with bruschetta -- it was good. I would have liked the toast crispier, but the topping was elegant with hints of lemon, balsamic vinegar and chives. Garlic was present but not overwhelming.\n\nNext, to the salad - She had Insalata estiva and I the classic Insalata alla cesare. Both were great. I wished I'd ordered the Insalata estiva after trying a bite of hers, though my caesar was spicy and tasty. Like creme brulee, I use caesar salads as a beacon -  a marker or buoy. If you make a good caesar, I'm happy. If you deliver a great creme brulee, you're going to see me again.\n\nEntrees were Pappardelle toscana (large noodles in rabbit sauce) and for her, Gamberoni pizzaiola (Jumbo prawns with fresh tomato and garlic) with a side of linguini. The rabbit dish was like an open-faced ravioli with a brown sauce of shredded rabbit. It's listed as \"award winning\" on the menu and i could taste why.\n\nBoth dishes were sumptuous, satisfying - like home cooking, not manufactured. \n\nWe finished the night with espressos and my wife tried a chocolate mousse pie/cake thingy that I thought was disappointing when I had a mouthful, but she wanted chocolate. IMHO, we should have gotten a tiramisu.\n\nThe wonderful food, combined with the atmosphere of this family restaurant packed with enthusiastic diners, perfectly attentive waiters and the very charming owner/manager/chef, compels me to give this place 5 stars. I will come back here again and again and again.  \n\nGrazie, Sergio!!", "author": "Don W."}

Anyhow, It was supposed to be dinner at Albona, the Istrian place way at the end of Columbus. But they were full, so the owner called the owner at Firenze by Night, who did have room for us. Welcome to Old Skool Italian.\n\nFBN is just off Columbus, on Stockton. Owner Sergio greeted a friend passing on the street as he ushered us in past the bar, to a table near the window in the carpeted dining room. I'd forgotten how much noise control carpet provides, you just don't see that too much any more. Yay Carpet!\n\nOnce we got situated, the waiter came and took drink orders, gave us the specials, and left us to ponder. The menu has all the classics, caprese salad, saltimbuco, pork scallopine, steak florentine.\n\n2 of us shared the calamari appetizer, a nest of baby squid marinated in vinaigrette on a bed of baby greens. It was a fresh alternative to the usual fried calamari. The specials sounded good we ordered a pasta with scallops and mussels, a beef bresaola? special, a petrale sole special, and from the menu the pork scallopine. I was hoping we'd share bites, but that didn't happen. The pasta with the shellfish was super yummy in a white wine/olive oil sauce with herbs. Everything else looked great and everyone said so.\n\nService was nice. We didn't have to wait to place our order, bread appeared without fuss. Our waiter was friendly and helpful with suggestions.\n\nThis could have been a 5 star review except for the wines by the glass. Because our entrees were all over the menu, ordering a bottle for the table made no sense.  There are so many quality imports that cost less than Californian wine, that where price point is an issue, still allow the wine manager to put together a thoughtful wine list.

I managed to secure a reservation, but I screwed up in calculating how long it would take to  a. get into the city, and b. traverse from the excelsior to north beach.  I hate traffic.  Anyway, despite being ~40 minutes late (and apparently with other people waiting for a table), we were seated within five minutes.  This included the time we spent waiting to speak with the host (who, I believe, was the owner).  The only downside was that we were seated *very* close to the kitchen, and thus our dinner conversation was accompanied by the inevitable clanging of dishes, pots, and pans.  Our server was awesome.  It seemed as if he knew we were on a first date, and  he gave us enough space to converse, and yet timed his appearances perfectly so that he was always there when we needed him.  I had the swordfish special, which was seared and seasoned perfectly, although the vegetables were slightly cooler than I'd like.... this could be due to the fact that I was entranced by my date and our conversation, so it took me a bit to get to my food.  My date had the gnocchi, which, according to her, were very, very good (as they should be as their signature dish).  The wine was slightly overpriced for what you get, but you can't expect anything more than that in sf.  We didn't have a chance to try any dessert (despite a two hour allowance on my part) as we had tickets for cobbs, and had to leave, but I've heard good things.\n\nAll in all it was a wonderful experience, although, again, my date was wonderful and definitely colored my perception of the evening.

The sauce is nice to dip bread in, but can be unappealing if you have a lot of courses coming.\n\nAppetizer #2 - Insalata Estiva (Tomato and Mozzarella salad) - Very similar to a caprese, the heirloom tomatoes, small chunks of mozzarella, basil, onions, and olive oil made this dish simple, light, yet elegant\n\nEntr\u00e9e #1 - Pappardelle Toscana (Large Noodles in a Rabbit Sauce) - This award winning dish is a must try.

This is definitely true Italian and my veal saltimbocca was amazing; however, the ambiance factor ruined my experience. It's cold and musky in there, almost even moldy. It looks like the place hasn't been refurnished in decades. It's really dark too, and not the romantic kind, as there weren't any lit candles. If you're going to pay $30 for a plate, you have some expectations. I want to believe LIttle Italy has the best Italian restaurants in the Bay, so I'll keep searching around the area. Until then, if you're toting around your Italian family, drive up to Marin and check out Fradelizio's or Sorella's in Fairfax. They are both equally the best Italian restaurants I've been to.", "author": "K M."}

I've made much better pasta sauces myself, but all in all the pasta was good and a decent price for a place that didn't seem as touristy as most of northbeach. My friend got the veal, and though the basil pine nut sauce was good, I felt they pounded the meat too thin until it was unrecognizable. Veal is supposed to be tender to begin with... it doesn't need to be paper thin with a veil of sauce so you can't see the quality.

Well, in this case, the reasonable conclusion is the right conclusion. The body of evidence supporting my love of this place is far too strong to ignore.\n\nFirst, let me start with people. Firenze is family owned and operated by some of the most welcoming people I have ever met. The staff and owner are genuinely invested in the patron (you) have an enjoyable experience. One time, during a power outage, the staff escorted would-be-guests to nearby restaurants. I was witness to this because the bar was still able to serve drinks.\n\nNow, about that bar. It is small but its primary purpose is to entertain you before you are seated so for that purpose it is perfect and if you are just a few and don't want to bother with a table because all you need comes from the top self then you may as well just plop yourself down, order some grub (read: very fine food), and shoot the shit with the bar tender (who is also excellent).\n\nFinally, the food is excellent. Anyone who says that Firenze has \"just ok\" Gnocchi likely doesn't know dick about great Gnocchi. But, the Gnocchi is far from the only thing on the menu. All of their fish dishes and pastas stand out of the crowd and I understand the veal is excellent as well although I have never been a fan of veal myself so I cannot speak from experience on that one. Also, if you have room, the deserts are a must.\n\nI have taken many of my friends here and I have yet to hear a complaint.", "author": "Peter F."}

We were 10 minutes late for our reservation and they still held our table for us! (a first for me!).  The entire team was very friendly and happy to have us dine in their restaurant.  The restaurant was filled with both regulars-right out of the Sopranos- and tourists. The three of us ordered the special of Sole (x2) and the Veal Marsala. All I can say is it was one of if not the best Sole I have ever had!  It was light, fluffy, juicy and flavorful without overwhelming the fish itself!  I even ate all my farm fresh vegetables and I all I could leave from the large portion was a small bit of the polenta.  They served nice wines - even turned my dining partners off their regular wine they drank at home...  We were worried about being late, but the meal was fast, perfect and service was not rushed or in anyway pushy.  The only negative was that the regulars felt like were intruding on their place a little and weren't friendly-- but I can understand not wanting to have their local turn into a tourist trap.  All in all the best meal out I have had in years!!", "author": "Sara K."}

It was a Wednesday night and upon entering, there were folks at the bar and the host was missing.  While we were looking around and thinking maybe we should leave and try next time - an older man with a ponytail in kitchen uniform came and asked if we've been helped then lead us to a nice corner table. \n\nOur waiter was new and was really not very good - he doesn't remember the menu, can't answer any questions and couldn't recommend a bottle of wine.  For his sake, I hope he learns fast.  Anyway, he got the seasoned waiter over and you can tell he has worked there forever and probably part of the family by now.  He recommended a bottle that was not on the menu but it was good although not as full body/bold as I wanted.\n\nWhat we ordered:\nBresaola con Rugola - aged beef w/ arugula - $10.25 - small portion and it was ok, not very tasty.\n\nPappardelle toscana - large noodles in rabbit sauce - $14.25 - this is one of their award winning pasta.  It was very delicious.  I loved the large noodles and the sauce was very tasty.\n\nPasta of the day - risotto - $14.50 - it was ok, the risotto wasn't creamy but more like rice.  \n\nWe were too full for dessert.  When we were leaving, we came upon the older man who lead us to the table again.  He asked if everything was ok and if we enjoyed dinner.  We told him yes and I asked if he was the owner and he said yes.  That explains it and because of his friendliness and the delicious pappardelle, we will return...perhaps try their other award winning dish, gnocchi.", "author": "Gloria H."}

This was supposed to be a fantastic surprise dinner and it turned into a stressful evening. The food tasted good, portions were very miniscule, but the lying staff makes this place the last time I will visit. This is located in North Beach area of San Francisco and believe me there are many other Italian restaurants up and down the same street for three blocks which I should have chosen instead. Most of the other ones offer free wine and appetizer just for having dinner but not Firenze. I never received a wine menu or a happy hour list. This place is way understaffed. The only drink I got was water as I never did have my drink order taken by our waiter as he was serving the entire restaurant himself. The place was packed. It took 2 hours for us to get our meal!!  We had made reservations ahead of time. A friend of ours made reservations as well for his own table right next to ours. When we got there is clear that they hadn't done what we had asked as they were about to seat my husband and I at a table for two and then our friend somewhere else in the restaurant. When I informed the hostess/apparent manager he said oh no your friend said he was just meeting you for \"drinks.' That was such a lie I was dumbfounded as our friend doesn't \"drink\" and specifically said he was having dinner for a party of 1 next to our party of 2. He takes blood pressure medicine and wouldn't touch a drink otherwise he would have a heart attack. I couldn't believe this lie and excuse they came up with. I chalked it up and tried my best to rectify this. Finally they asked would you like to be seated at a table together, this being their idea, we said okay as that would free up another table for some other couple to be able to eat, so we thought we were being generous! We were wrong. We each had a coupon that stated one per table and reservations required so we followed their rules to the letter. We informed the waiter that we had coupons and he said, \"Oh, I will get that at the end.\" With this coupon our friend had $40 to spend on himself for food and was looking forward to it. When the bill came they would only accept one coupon trying to make us pay over $56, when $40 was our friend's food that was supposed to be paid with his coupon. In front of a whole restaurant we had to argue this problem out with not one but two people to try and get this resolved. On our way up from the table we got lectured by the staff again about this problem and it truly was quite embarrassing to have everyone staring at this scene taking place. How rude this service was. The fact that we did or did not use coupons shouldn't have been broadcasted to the entire restaurant. We shouldn't have been put on the spot like that for following their rules. I will never go back here again!! Beware I do not recommend this restaurant at all! This wasn't even an upscale restaurant. Firenze by Night Ristorante sucks! Remember, this was my husbands birthday dinner and it ruined our evening and was the conversation for the car ride home about how they could have done this and dealt with this in a much better way had they known how to run a restaurant or cared about customer satisfaction. We followed their rules and were treated like trash for it!\n\n If you want good upscale with a wonderful staff, plenty of food--- huge portions, and nice atmosphere then go to IL Postale in Sunnyvale, CA. ilpostale.com/", "author": "Allexus Q."}

I ordered the Peppardelle Toscana - large noodles with rabbit sauce.  This was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had.  I've had rabbit before, but this was unlike any other.  Others at my table ordered the Gnocchi, Ravioli della Mamma, and Fettuccine Pesto, all of which were also excellent. \n\nAll in all, I highly recommend Firenze by Night Ristorante.

I usually go for the Pasta Mare e Monte (pasta with chicken and shrimp) and every time I do, I try to savor every single bit, because the al dente pasta, light tomato sauce and tender chunks of meat are DELICIOUS. My boyfriend has tried the rabbit and the quail, and been very pleased with both. I recall him loving the sauces they were served in, as well as the tenderness of the meat. The waiters are helpful with wine suggestions, and the bruschetta is very good. Mmmm delicious tomatoes. If we have room, we try to finish off the night with cappuccino and the ricotta cheesecake. LOVE IT. \n\nThe service is superb. We're usually served by old Italian men who have probably been in the business for decades. And they always take care of us so well. \n\nThe decor is a little kitschy, sure. But it's also unpretentious and welcoming.

The bartender informed us it'd be 5-10 minutes, as another table of six had just finished dessert and would be leaving soon.  Thirty minutes later, they were still there, nursing their lukewarm light beers and dishing about who knows what.  The owner (Sergio, I think) came out and apologized for the delay and brought us a plate of bruschetta to tide us over to dinner.  After a total of forty five minutes, the waiters gave up and opened up the banquet room just for our group.\n\nOverall, a pretty reasonable experience.

We wanted to order appetizers right away and the server told us that the food comes out really fast so we should just order everything at once. Whatever.  We ordered mozzarella for appetizers and we both got the \"award winning\" gnocchi for dinner.  The mozzarella was good, but came without balsamic vinegar.  I prefer it with balsamic vinegar but my friend prefers it without so she was happy.  There was also none on the table for mixing with oil for bread.  Maybe that's authentic Italian, I dunno.  The food was hot when it came out, which was definitely nice.  The gnocchi was good enough - I inhaled mine, but it wasn't award winning good.  It was very soft, but the sauce wasn't that great.  Also the server asked if we wanted Parmesan cheese and I said yes.  But it was powdered! Not the fresh kind.  \n\nThe service was fast and our server was really nice and friendly.

My wife had the petrale sole special and I had the osso bucco. Once again they were both excellent, well cooked, sauced, and hot. The polenta which came with both entrees was perfect. The only complaint I could have was no time to breathe between courses. As soon as one dish was cleared the next was ready. I was hungry so I didn't mind too much.\n\nThe coffee and desserts were very good. The tiramisu was sweet & light. We will definitely go back, but ask to be seated anywhere but adjacent to the bar.

It seemed like any other Italian restaurant from the outside and wasn't expecting much, but I was impressed. The decor is like any small restaurant you would find in Italy and the food is authentic home style cooking! That's not too common in the states since everything is usually \"Americanized.\" The tables are a bit close to each other, but who cares? Just try to keep the X-rated topics for after dinner. Service was excellent and our server was quite funny and charming. \n\nMy friend ordered their award winning gnocchi and it was delicious! It was a perfect doughy texture and the sauce was great. I had the other award winning dish, papardelle toscana, which was good too, but the noodles tasted a bit too eggy. Their rabbit sauce was amazing though. My other friend's risotto was huge and it was just a big plop of risotto with nothing else. They should really serve it with some vegetables or some kind of side to go with it. Other than that, our whole party was pretty satisfied with everything. Oh and the wine menu wasn't too overwhelming with a decent selection of wines by the glass. I would highly recommend this place for some good old authentic Italian food. Can't wait to come back to try other items on their menu.", "author": "Linda C."}

My favorite Italian in the city, though admittedly I haven't tried many. This was the first restaurant I ate in San Francisco - maybe 5 years ago?? I moved here 3 years ago, and this place has really become a spot for me. There is plenty of buzz and noise. You'll be immediately greeted by either Chris (the bartender), Sergio (the owner) or Paolo (the owner's son). \n\nMy favorite dish is the pasta carbonara. It isn't on the menu, but it is the best I have ever had. Not soupy, like I find so often, but dry and delicious. On Saturdays and I think Sundays as well, they have a Ossobucco (lamb shank with a brown gravy) that falls right off the bone - which happens to be the first meal I had at my first restaurant in SF. I was with a friend and his girlfriend. We both ordered the ossobucco, his girlfriend didn't. I remember giggling after my first bite, like I had been told a clever secret and was trying to keep it to myself. I looked up and my buddy was doing the same. Needless to say, I recommend it.\n\nThey make their own lemonchello, which you must have with the homemade tiramisu for desert. Oh, and the gnocchi is also outstanding.

We had originally booked at another restaurant (Fior d'Italia) but after reading the reviews we decided to bail and go to Firenze by Night and boy are we glad we did!.  My wife and two kids and I had actually eaten at Firenze when we were scoping out picnic sites for the big birthday weekend.  \n\nWe had our hotel concierge call at 4:00pm for a 6:00 reservation and they were able to accommodate our group in their back room.  Major kudos for their fitting us in on such short notice on a holiday weekend!  The staff at Firenze is so friendly and accommodating and they really delivered on the service.  \n\nWe only had one waiter for all 30 of us, AND he was handling two other tables.  Even with just one waiter he handled everything extremely well and got everyone in our party served quickly.  We had several appetizers for both tables to start off.  We asked that they get food out for the seven children in our party first.  They served the kids and all of the fish dishes first and had everyone else served within short order.\n\nThe bus boys kept our water and drink orders coming quickly and we didn't have to ask or remind them for water or bread.  We had eaten at the Lauren Court (Allegedly a 5 star restaurant) at the Fairmont hotel the night before, and I have to say that the service at Firenze blew the Laurel Court away! \n\nDesert was delicious and everyone in our party absolutely raved about how good the food was.  My aunt who has lived in the Pacific Northwest for the past decade stated that her salmon was \"the best she has ever had\".  I highly recommend the Gnocci as it simply melts in your mouth, but the fish and pasta dishes are excellent as well.  They do not have a kids menu but they will cook any type of pasta with veggies and grilled chicken which all of our kids gobbled up.\n\nThe bill was very reasonable and a good value for a party of 30 people.  (Our bill was half as much as the Laurel Court at the Fairmont hotel and the food and service were much better at Firenze!)\n\nMajor kudos to Firenze by night for an absolutely fabulous meal!", "author": "Mark H."}

It is a GREAT place for groups.  Two of the times I went here were for birthday dinners.  The service was pretty great for a group dinner on both occasions.  The bread was fresh, the entrees were out of this world and the whole dinner in general was reasonably priced.  The gnocchi is awesome.  My friend who had studied in Italy couldn't believe how authentic this place was.  But then I took my boyfriend there....\n\nSo the third time I went we sat up front.  The service was still pretty good.  I just felt like the waiter pushed us on appetizers/dessert and was kinda slimy.  The bread was not very good at all.  It tasted a day old.  Our appetizer was this stuffed mushroom thing and it was pretty good.  Both our entrees however were amazing once again.  I still do think this place is one of the best Italian restaurants in North Beach (that doesn't take too much though).  However, after I discovered Ristorante Milano, it'll be hard for me to come back (Unless it's a group event).", "author": "Rachel S."}

Service was a bit slow, and I believe all the waiters are Italian, so that was suppose to give it an authentic feel. The host and bartender were funny and supper nice. They has a cheesy backdrop of Italy, only wish the front was as cheesy.\n\nBesides the decor and feel of the wait staff I have to give them 4 Stars for food. Watch out for the bread, ours was a bit hard! Make sure that someone orders the gnocchi, it is award winning, or whatever they mention on the menu, it was really the best gnocchi  I've ever tried. I went with the Ravioli, which was really good, but the next time I go, I will be all over the gnocchi!!!\n\nDefinitely worth a try and worth going back for.

We had one order of the Gnocchi, one order of the Fettuccine Pesto, and one Insalata Di Spinaci (warm spinach salad) as an appetizer that we split, and all were very good.

I had made a reservation and even changed it and they were very accommodating. We were seated promptly and were asked our drink order fast as well. The place was very busy and seamed to be a great experience. We ordered wine and bruchetta. We were given bread while we wait. It took 20 min to get our wine. Then we had to ask for more bread, which they said they weren't sure they had, but then it miraculously appeared. Next thing we know our meals arrive. They totally forgot the bruchetta. And when my dish arrived they left out the chicken. Then I had to wait another 20 min to get my dinner. By the time I got it everyone else was almost done. The server apologized but never apologized about the bruchetta. Then, at the end of the night, messed up how we paid and almost over charged us $40.  Glad we noticed it or we would have walked out without catching it.\n\nI have to say that the food itself was absolutely amazing. Very delicious. I would definitely go back, despite the problems.

It's the kind of place I could imagine my mobster grandpa patronizing (maybe he did?), and was very american-italian old school authentic. We really enjoyed the atmosphere: it's tucked away on a side street in an unassuming building, but the interior is really fun, with frescos on the ceiling. \n\nThe Good: My sweetheart said that the gnocci were like little potato clouds in his mouth  - the best he had ever had. He says, they deserve their 5-star, award wining reputation. I had the veal with what appeared to be a creamy basil sauce, and what I hoped was not made with roux. \n\nThe Not so Good: We had the melon with prosciutto which was good, but sort of bland. It had never had this before but was keen to try it. It was even featured in photos on the webpage! I was disappointed because I felt like I could have cut up melon and laid prosciutto on it at home and saved myself the time and money. \n\nThe Ugly: Even though the dining room was beautiful and well decorated, it was packed on a Wednesday night at 9pm, and it. is. small. The couple in the table next to us finished their meal, and then three other people (The owners? Friends?) came and stood at their table and talked to them. Oh, I mean YELLED AT THE TOP OF THEIR LUNGS IN ITALIAN FOR AN HOUR. Because apparently Italian can only be spoken at the top of one's voice. Oh yeah, EVERYONE ELSE IN THE RESTAURANT HAD TO YELL TO BE HEARD TOO. Not exactly the romantic atmosphere we were planning on. \n\nGluten Free Review: Seeing as it was an italian restaurant and our waiters seemed to be of the old-school, italian speaking type, I didn't even try. I knew that they probably wouldn't know what I was talking about. I took a chance on the veal with the cream sauce, and it turned out to be gluten-free (whew!), but not everyone is as brave as I am.

Their gnocchi is superb, the pappardelle ala Toscana (rabbit sauce) is, too. Ensalata estiva never fails to please and they have the best tiramisu that I've ever tasted in or out of Italy. From time to time another menu item will be exceptional but mostly they're just consistently good. \n\nOwner/maitre d' Sergio Giusti is charming and the rest of the staff, from the bartender to the busboys, is professional, friendly and caring.

However, after the bartender insisted on a bottle of wine recommended by the manager in the very well-tailored \"pimp-stripe\" suit...I knew my friend and I weren't driving anywhere.  After that bottle and a few offers for free drinks from a table of men across the restaurant, we were hardly equipped to walk unassisted, let alone drive.\n\nMy dinner friend had spent a year in Naples and once she revealed that her pretty face could also communicate in beautiful, melodious Italian, we were constantly flocked and fawned upon by adoring servers.  I've discovered the fixins to a perfect evening out - find a native speaker of the restaurant's mother country, make sure he/she is attractive, sit and smile and nod along.  Eat/drink perks as they appear.  Life is tough for the sidekick.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-12-28", "description": "I luuurrvve gnocchi.  It's my litmus test for pasta.  Good gnocchi is like an out of body religious experience involving fluffy pillow-y pasta in a simple sauce that plays off the delectable starchiness of the potato complex without weighing it down in excessive salt or grease.  Bad gnocchi is like rocks dropping down your gullet.  Since gnocchi is so rich in its starch level, a light marinara usually does it for me, any cream sauces are so overwhelming that I usually go into a food coma mid bite.  Needless to say, the gnocchi were light & fluffy & the marinara with a touch of cream highlighted the starchy goodness of the gnocchi.  I'm so addicted I can't seem to try anything else when we come here.  Capt Hook loves a cooked down sauce & is enamored of the Pappardelle toscana.  Slightly chewy wide ribbons of pasta with a savory, tangy, rabbit rag\u00f9.  Sometimes the sauce seems to be thinner than others but when it's dense & cooked down, yum!\n\nThe staff are efficient & professional if not very personable.  Much preferable to Johnny squatting down next to you to invade your personal space & see how many fillings your molars are sporting.  The decor is campy but I'm all about the food.  Always seem to find some other friendly guests to chat with or share foodie spots which is priceless.", "author": "Cam T."}

They serve one of my favorite pasta dishes called Penne Allo Zenzero which is made with sun dried tomatoes, garlic and shallots.  I was all fired up for that when we got there; but, the seafood special was Petrale Sole.  Another favorite; so, I went with that instead.  I was not disappointed.  It was cooked perfectly and the sauce was so good that I cleaned the plate with onion foccacia bread they provided when we sat down.  My wife had the seafood linguine, the pasta special.  It was good; but a little rich for her taste.  It had a lot of salmon and not enough clams, mussels, shrimp and calamari.  Anyway, the food and service is good and the ambiance is nice.

The atmosphere is lively, the decor is warm and totally unpretentious.  I started with the warm spinach salad with bacon and pine nuts, and I've got to say that this is pretty close to being the best spinach salad to hit my belly.  The spinach leaves were still firm (not wilty) and the dressing was the perfect blend of vinegar and hint of sweet.  I couldn't decide between the gnocchi and the linguine with mussels and shrimp, so our server suggested we get a plate of gnocchi to share between the four of us.  Brilliant idea!  Prego!  My entire crew was in pasta euphoria.  The soft gnocchi melted in our mouths bursting with delicious goodness.  If I wasn't in a public place, I would have licked that plate clean.    The linguine with mussels and shrimp in white wine sauce had the right amount of garlic in the sauce.  This was exactly what I needed after the heavy gnocchi as it was a beautiful light sauce with perfectly al dente linguine.  By the end of our meal, the four of us thought we could have a bite of something sweet.  That was not the case....we were in a food coma.  Grazie!  God, I love this place!", "author": "Beth H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-03-06", "description": "Firenze by Night Ristorante is now one of my favourite restaurants in San Francisco!  Let me tell you why!\n\nThis past September I spent many months searching for an affordable, quality restaurant in San Francisco that would be able to accommodate a group of 20 to 28.  This was not an easy task!  Most restaurants I inquired at either could not or would not accommodate such a large group.  Many were rude when I called to inquire!  And the few that could take our group were either too expensive, or too \"funky\" for the kind of event I was planning.  So finally I posted on one of the Yelp forums and Firenze by Night was one of the suggestions.  I did a bit of research and then I called the restaurant.  Everyone at Firenze was very nice!  They were easily able to accommodate our group and even called to confirm a few days before.  They reserved the special back room for us, which was lovely.  They also gave us the option of placing orders in advance, or ordering at the restaurant.  We chose the later, and they happily accommodated our wishes.  As an extra benefit, I pleased to find that there were a couple of inexpensive late-night parking garages within a block of the restaurant, so no one would have to worry about trying to find street-parking on a busy Friday night.  One of my friends went to Firenze before the night of our event, and reported that the food and service were excellent, which of course was encouraging.  \n\nWhen my guests arrived at the restaurant on our chosen day, they were immediately greeted and offered drinks at the bar.  When I arrived they took us all to the back room and offered us appetizers while we waited for all our guests to arrive.  They cheerfully served drinks, and when two guests couldn't make it, they re-arranged the tables for us to accommodate our new group size.  They did an excellent job of serving all our food - for 24 guests - nice and hot at the same time!  They let us stay late and were very respectful of our entire group, and even went out their way to accommodate our tired six-year-old.  They were especially respectful of me, the young host, and continually checked in with be about our tab and how I would like to time dinner and desert, etc.\n\nSo, the customer service was exceptional, but just as importantly... so was the food!  Between the 24 of us we sampled the menu thoroughly, and not one of our guests had a single complaint!  In fact, everyone was so pleased that several of my guests later told me that they subsequently took out-of-town guests to Firenze, because they knew it was sure to be a good experience for everyone!\n\nI can't recommend Firenze highly enough.  I was just about to give up on finding a great, affordable restaurant with delicious good that could accommodate such a large group, and Firenze came through better than I could have expected.  So visit Firenze with confidence, and let them earn another great review!  :)", "author": "Jai K."}

We were so excited to read the menu and compare to everything we ate on our tour de Italia.  I knew a lot of people liked this place and we wanted to go for the good stuff.  The place filled up quickly with regulars, preparing themselves for a Friday night on the town.  It was crowded and the layout is really crowded/claustrophobic, especially on an odd warm night in May.  I swear my legs were stuck to the booth because I was sweating in there.  \n\nWe got some pretty tasty foccacia bread and ordered a Riesling.  It took us a really long time to decide on a main dish because there are so many excellent choices.  We were debating on the linguine and clams, the florentine steak (which we really loved in Florence), pesto, and the rabbit pasta.  Maddie tried the famous gnocchi and I tried their special tutto mare.  My husband, who also loves the real Italy, came with us and tried the giant shrimp with mushrooms.  We thought the gnocchi was definitely the best and totally deserved that \"award winning\" title on the menu.  It was definitely the best gnocchi I've ever had, and I'm not a huge fan of the stuff.  My tutto mare was also excellent with shrimp, mussels, fish, and some other stuff, in a white wine sauce.  I'd probably pass on the shrimp dish that my husband got.  It was filled with heavy cream and pastas are probably a little bit better than just the shrimp.\n\nWe left the restaurant without getting dessert since we were so full, although the wine still got me a tiny bit buzzed.  The waiters were very attentive.  Such a classic italian kiss-on-the-cheek place that we will definitely go back to.  And yes, it's definitely comparable to Italy!", "author": "Stacey C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-06-04", "description": "It's been a long time since the five year stint when I lived in North Beach back in the 80's.  It was a great place to dine at hole in the wall restaurants and find bars where only the locals hung out.  We go back regularly and are to glad to have the help of so many adventurous yelpers to help discover hidden gems in a neighborhood that we don't know as well as we used to.  \n\nSo last night when we wanted to eat in a \"local\" restaurant, we made our way, with open minds and stomachs, to Firenze.  As we had reservations, we got a table right away - although at 6:15 there were only about 10 other people in the place. But, in no time at all, it filled up quickly and crowds were waiting by the time we made our way out around 8:00pm.  So, you have to ask yourself, if it fills up that quickly and people are waiting to get in, what is it about this place that makes it so great...especially given the great disappointment we felt as we departed.\n\nPrevious diners have mentioned the less than adequate service and they are right.  A request for bread had to be made three times, a glass of water more times than necessary.  When the busboy refilled my daughter's iced tea, he managed to pour whatever slime was living at the bottom of the pitcher into her glass.  Of course, this wasn't discovered until just before she drank the mysterious substance.  I mean, when was the last time that container was washed??\n\nWe waited quite awhile for our entrees even as others who had arrived after us were served their meals.  And, when they did arrive, they were wrong.  My daugher's girlfriend ordered the shrimp and calamari but no calamari was seen on the plate.  Perhaps they had run out.  I ordered the pork special and was served, instead, some beef concoction.  When I pointed out the error, it was taken away and I thought I would get my order.  Instead, I was told they were out of the pork and was handed the menu so I could pick something else.  Given that the other three people at the table had their meals, I didn't want to watch them eat and then dine alone. So, I opted for the previous beef dish which by now had been sitting on some counter in the kitchen for at least five minutes and looked like it when it made the return trip to my table.  Resigned, I decided to make the best of it and enjoy the meal.  Imagine my surprise and irritation to overhear the chef, only minutes later, present the pork special to a nearby table.  This would be the same pork that was not available when I ordered it.  Maybe he knew them, who knows.\n\nSo, can I recommend the place?  No, but a lot of people seem to like it and I would be hard pressed to tell you why they do.  But go...you might get lucky...or not.  It certainly didn't take me to my happy place.", "author": "John P."}

Light and fluffy, served with a tomato cream sauce that was not heavy. She had the vegetable lasagna and she said it was really good. When the food came, we stopped yapping and gobbled it all done. Ended dinner with a cheesecake for her, and chocolate mousse cake for me. The chocolate mousse cake was a little rich and strong for me, so I did not finish it. The bread basket came with slices of focaccia that were so good, I almost asked for more. Needless to say I fell off the diet wagon last night... :)", "author": "Charlotte T."}

Was told that it would be a 10-15 minute wait. Didn't get seated until 7PM (I had checked back with the host/owner's son (I think) for status at the 15 minute mark and he replied with \"I told you 15 minutes.\" Nice guy.\n2) Our order and bread was not taken until 730PM.\n3) I ordered the Fried Calamari appetizer and received a calamari salad (unfried)\n4) I ordered a Fettuccine dish that included garlic, sun dried tomatoes and fresh wild mushrooms. I asked if it were possible to put the mushrooms on the side. If it's already in the sauce, then I would order something else. The waiter stares blankly at his page and said, no it's ok. As you have already probably guessed, I received two bowls, one with my mushroom sauce and one with a bowl of plain cooked fettuccine. The waiter said \"uh yea, the mushrooms are in the sauce, that's all we could do.\" I had to pick up every single mushroom.\n5) The busboy packaged our leftovers, brought back the bagged boxes and dumped one sideways on the table in front of my friend. Then left it there in that position. I went to move it and after flattening it properly so that the sauce wouldn't drip out, I removed my wet hand from the bag. Who knows what was on that bag?\n\nWell those are my reasons why I probably never go and spend 2.5 hours at a restaurant that didn't even include dessert or drinks. It was just an entree with some bread.", "author": "Katherine F."}

We reserved the back room where they pushed the tables together for us so there was plenty of room for our group of 20. We had a fixed menu with the choice of mixed green salad or Caesar, I had the latter which was great, had a nice bite and was a great way to start the meal along with their yummy bread. Next was a pasta dish which everyone loved, I wish I could remember what it was called all I know is that it was fabulous and I could have eaten more. Then we had the choice of a petrole sole with white wine sauce, chicken with marsala sauce and artichokes or linguine with clams. I had the chicken which was good but I probably could have made it at home, the bf had the linguine which was also very good. The service was excellent and very attentive, the party went smoothly and everyone enjoyed it. They even cut up and served a cake we bought from Victoria's bakery next store instead of having their spumoni ice cream.\nI would definitely recommend this place for large groups or parties as well as intimate dining affairs and I look forward to returning.", "author": "Meg L."}

But once inside, there are actually plenty of seating and the place itself was very lively.  Thanks to their sleek, eye-catching wall decor you can't help but divert your attention once in awhile, but only for a couple of seconds, to appreciate the photos. We were seated promptly as we were one of the few in the restaurant just a little past 6.  But after some time, the tables filled up quickly.\n\nWe started off with the Funghi ripieni con salsiccia-  petite mushrooms stuffed with Italian sausage, flavored in a rich, thick sauce that was good enough to dip your bread in.  The insalata estiva- sliced tomatoes and onions tossed with mozzarella cheese and fresh basil- was very simple, yet seasoned carefully with olive oil, which made it a perfect light dish that prepared us for the main entrees.  In fact, I liked it so much that it inspired me to make my own.  The delectable appetizer and salad were followed by the \"award winning\" Pappardelle toscana- large noodles in rabbit sauce.  I loved the large and randomly shaped noodles, drenched in a red sauce with pieces of rabbit meat. It sounds hard to swallow, but the meat really tasted like beef.  The calamari giusti was sauteed with garlic, mushrooms, olive oil and white wine, served with side of couscous and veggies. The cous cous wasn't the best, so focus your attention to the calamari pieces.", "author": "Lisa C."}

He wanted to find a restaurant that served pasta so he could load up on carbs the night before the race.  I read about this place doing a general search on North Beach restaurants and the description sounded very interesting - surround yourself with images of Florence (I've always wanted to visit Florence).  There are so many dining choices in North Beach that choosing can be a bit daunting. We were wanting to find a small, unpretentious place with good food, and this sounded like it was just what we were looking for.  Also, the many positive reviews on yelp reinforced our decision to check out the restaurant.  Well, I am happy to say that we had a wonderful dining experience!  \n\nThe entrance is through the bar area (full bar, by the way), which also has some smaller tables for dining.  The main dining room I found to be cozy and inviting.  Some other reviewers mentioned how the proximity of the tables felt a bit crowded, but I actually didn't mind the closeness to other diners.  It reminded me of dining with a big group of family.   There were many regulars dining, talking to each other and the wait staff, and they all seemed to be thoroughly enjoying their wine and food - a good sign.\n\nMy husband ordered the award winning gnocchi - going for the starch overload - and it was marvelous.  I sampled his dish and it was some of the best gnocchi I've ever tasted.  The sauce was just the right  amount of flavor - I'd call it a \"pink\" sauce because it was between a red and white sauce - to complement the fluffy, light potato dumplings without overpowering  them.  It was very well done!  I had the special meat dish #2 which our waiter recommended I try: chicken which was flattened and stuffed with a mixture of proscuitto, sausage and savory herbs, then rolled and topped with a light tomato sauce.  A sort of chicken-eloni.  It was accompanied by a side of sauteed, julienned zucchini and carrots, along with some very buttery tasting polenta.  The entire dish was extremely tasty - I ate every bit of it - and very filling.   We will definitely be coming back to sample their other menu offerings as they did have a wide variety of pasta and meat dishes.", "author": "Lily Y."}

We were pushed around and bumped in to the entire time. \nWe were seated in the back room. The noise was unbelievable. You had to yell just so the person next to you could hear. Trying to talk to anyone any further away was pointless. \nThe waiter was awful. He rolled his eyes, was short tempered and was obviously exasperated by even the slightest hesitation in answering his questions. When he brought our main dishes he yelled out the dish \"Chicken! Chicken! Who had the chicken?\" at the top of his lungs. If we didn't answer fast enough he blew out his breath and slammed the plate down on the empty table next to us. \nFor my appetizer I ordered tomatoes w/ red onion. It came on a big white plate - 4 slices of colorless plastic tasting tomato with 4 slices of red onion. Awful. It looked like something from Denny's. \nI ordered the chicken stuffed canalloni. It was two small tubes stuffed with chicken that had been put in a food processor with some other ingredients I could not pick out. The whole thing had a strange fishy taste. \nThe dessert was something from Costco. My decaf coffee was NOT decaf which seriously screwed me up as well as my baby (I'm nursing). \nThe price was a crime.", "author": "Bernadette G."}

My mister and I are highly allergic to North Beach, so we didn't know jack. This place drew us in because my cousin wanted MEAT...and saw the porterhouse steak on the menu. The wait was 15 minutes. It was decent food at half the cost of many restaurants we saw in the area. The most expensive thing was the steak for $26.50. My cousin--a real meat eater--said the steak was fabulous. All the pastas were in the $15 range. My raviolis were $13 and fairly good. Their gnocchi is supposed to have won awards. Firenze is a casual, no frills, mid-range place. The interior could be spruced up and the service was average (the waiter never brought us an appetizer we ordered), but the food was fair for the price.

We all opted for salad without knowing it was an extra charge. It was another $10 for lettuce and dressing, a. deceptive and b. overpriced for a plate of lettuce since the meal itself was like $17.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-12-09", "description": "It was just....ehhhh. Really, 2.5 stars.\n\nAfter reading all the reviews on yelp, I was hoping this would be our new neighborhood Italian Place....where we could also host our rehearsal dinner. We LOVE Italian food and wine and live a handful of blocks away...what could be better?\n\nWe arrived for our res a few minutes early and waited at the bar for about 10-15 minutes. The bartender was really nice but grumbled incessantly about some guy at the bar who must be a skeezy regular. Ew. Both the bartender and the Maitre'D were funny and kind. But frazzled.\n\nWe got seated and took a while ordering wine. We wanted to talk with the waiter but he was buzzing all over the place...not very attentive. The wine we chose was good (albeit somewhat overpriced as we've bought similar at Coit Liqours on recommendation from their staff for a lot less...) \n\nAnyway, Prosciutto E Melone was yummy. Their Prosciutto is great (very salty and non greasy) which I was into.\n\nThe Bufala, Basil and Tomato app. was just so so. Tomatoes weren't all that flavorful and mozzarella was dry. The basil however, was excellent and very fresh.\n\nWe ordered the Veal with pine nuts, basil, \"and a touch of cream\" and the Ravioli Della Mamma.\n\nThe veal was a definite disappointment. The meat itself was tender and well pounded...but the sauce. BOO. Literally tasted like it was made with Mayo. I might actually bet some money on it. What we were expecting was a light, course chopped flavorful basil dish with elements of pine nut and light on the cream. Instead it was a very heavy creamy green sauce with pine nuts thrown in for good measure. We're talking major cream...little to no basil flavor. We were bummed.\n\nThe Ravioli was better. Red sauce was meaty and salty but not a lot of good fresh tomato flavor. Raviolis were well cooked and filling was okay (I think spinach and cheese. Not really memorable)\n\nWhat topped it off for us was hearing all the rave about the Gnocchi. I wanted to taste it, not order it...and asked for a small sample. Waiter says he will do a half order for me. Low and behold, never comes. We were already full from our mediocre other things....and thought, eh...why even ask. Of course it was on our bill though. Waiter seemed non-plussed about the fact he never delivered it, but took it off the bill no problem.\n\nWe had the spumoni and ricotta cheesecake for dessert. Spumone was really, really tasty and cheesecake was alright. Not dry, but not like \"Damn this is worth the workout I'll have to do later\".\n\nAll in all, we were bummed. Waiters were sort of sour pussed when they thought you weren't looking ( we were by the kitchen and saw the crabbiness go down) and the food really wasn't very good.\n\nWith wine, 2 apps, 2 entrees, 2 desserts....a full meal : around $130 not including tip.\n\nFor $200, you could go to Da Flora down the street and eat things that AMAZE YOU. Better ambiance too. \n\nIf you're looking for better Italian than on the Columbus Strip, but nothing special - go here. As a neighborhood local, I'd say...try somewhere else.", "author": "Lady L."}

I was a bigger fan of the appetizers than my entree, especially the antipasti.  The calamari salad was a particular favorite off that appetizer, though the entire plate was well-received by our group.  We also got the carpaccio, my first foray into uncooked beef.  \n\nIt was very tender and the lemon did not overpower it, though I can't honestly compare it to anything, as it was my first taste of the dish.\n\nMy papardelle was okay.  The rabbit sauce was very good, but I kept wishing there was a bit more sauce and a bit less papardelle.  Additionally, the pasta was just the slightest bit overcooked, although I'm pretty picky with that as I like my pasta al dente.", "author": "James S."}

That place must be great, because at 7pm on a Tuesday, there was an hour wait.  Wouldn't have made it to trivia.\n \nWe walked around looking and smelling in doors of other Italian looking spots, and came across Firenze by Night.  The menu was extensive and affordable, and they could seat 4 with almost no wait.  We were in.  \n\nAs we stood waiting for our table to be set up, a server (obviously Italian) came out making jokes about how slowly Italians do things and how maybe we'd get our table the next day.  He proceeded to entertain us with ancedotes about working in this small restaurant with his father.   Finally, our table was ready, and we were told that Uncle Eddie would be right with us.\n\nYes, Uncle Eddie was so authentic that over the noise the specials were a bit hard to understand.  But who cares?! - the man's accent and the lyrical way he spoke made it so worthwhile.  Besides, the specials were all written on a board above the kitchen.\n\nI would have given it 3 stars based purely on charm, but we were looking for really good food, and this place had it.  Generally, gnocchi ends up heavy and paste-y, and I can't say I'm a fan.  The dumplings here were really like pillows, so light and fluffy.  We also had a fresh clam pasta and a papardelle with rabbit ragu, which were both amazing.  \n\nAnd we made it to trivia on time.  and since we only spent $100 for 3 glasses of wine, 2 appetizers, and 4 pastas, we could still buy drinks at the bar.", "author": "redheaded s."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-18", "description": "Firenze reminds me a bit of the North End in Boston. The Italian influence on the neighborhood is definitely present  - the only thing that's missing is Modern Pastry with delicious on-the-spot filled cannolis. In any case, Firenze is a good restaurant for dates, casual gatherings and good food. We started with the prosciutto and melon and sausage and mushroom appetizers and they were both fantastic. The prosciutto wasn't too salty and the melon was perfectly sweet. The sausage and mushroom appetizer was tasty as well. I don't like foods when their natural flavor is over-camouflaged and Firenze does a good job of bringing out flavors. Yes, I tried the gnocchi and it was quite good. I agree with other reviewers when they say that it melts in your mouth. I'm not a huge carb-heavy fan so it wasn't really my thing, but it was tasty. The Boyfriend had the special chicken with prosciutto special and it was great. The chicken was tender and juicy, not overcooked, and the flavors complimented each other well. I had the spinach ravioli with meat sauce and was pleased. I know, a boring dish, but still yummy when you're looking for something light. The portions here are typical Italian-sized (i.e. pretty large) so don't each too much bread! While there's olive oil on the table, there's no balsamic vinegar but just ask the waiters and they're happy to oblige. Prices here are good, especially considering the amount of food you get and the taste.", "author": "Christine P."}

I wasn't in love with their veg lasagne when I ordered it, and it took forever (usually food comes up quick), so minus 1/2 star.  The gnocchi is superb.  I love me some sauteed spinach with my pasta, and while it's not on the menu, just ask for it, and they'll charge you for a spinach salad.  I get it every time, and it's not greasy, and it has the right balance of lemon and garlic.  The olive oil they put on the table to dip your bread into is the real deal and is of good quality.\n\nThe service/ambiance:\nThis place is small and the tables are really jammed together, but for a place that seems to be busy when other places are empty, it's a neccessity.  Like I mentioned before, the food usually comes up pretty quick.  Service is prompt and efficient (I really like that), and the Italian waiters are flirty without being creepy (and that's exactly what you get in Italy, so I like that too).  The decor is kinda cheezy, with a mural of the Florence skyline at night dominating the main wall of the dining room, but hey, that's what the restaurant is named after, right?  There are lots of choices for Italian in North Beach, many of them with sidewalk dining, which I love, but sadly not here so minus another 1/2 star.  I can't remember if they have valet, but there is a reasonably priced self-parking garage around the corner on Valejo (away from Columbus).  And it seems like each time I go there there is a table close by that is speaking to each other in Italian, which is always a good sign.", "author": "Amanda B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-06-28", "description": "for food, this restaurant deserves 5 stars.  \n\nfor service, this restaurant deserves 1 or 4 stars (av 3), depending on who is serving you.  i'll tell you why.\n\ni've been to this restaurant before and it was a great experience.  service is really  R E A L L Y  S L O W, but i suppose worth the wait.  \n\nso, my 2nd visit to firenze happened with myself, my girlfriend and 6 friends.  We are all lesbians.  We do not LOOK like stereotypical lesbians (we're all on the feminine side), however I suppose it could be apparent to other people that we were all gay.  ANYWAY, our dinner was good, however near the middle of our visit 3 tables behind us got sat with men in suits.  ALL 3 tables, all men in suits.  We were just eating and having a good time, when we noticed that these men (from all 3 tables behind us), were pointing and gawking at us.  Not to themselves or quietly, but as if we were a complete spectacle or freak show.  Have they  never seen lesbians before?  Have they forgotten they are in San Francisco?  We didn't know.... so we continued on with our friendship reunion.  Moments later, we noticed our waiter in the kitchen window, pointing at us with one of the cooks looking at our table as well and nodding.  What the heck?  what did we do?  All we were doing was eating, laughing and having a good time.  Not loud, not obnoxious, just eating like normal people.  A while later, we then notice our waiter talking to one of the men at the table behind us, they both look over, look at each other and laugh.  OK -- WEIRD.   This continued on for the duration of our dinner (about 2 hours), and it was extremely disappointing to be around clientele AND staff with such disrespect.  \n\nAs I said before, I've never had a problem at this place before.  The bartender was EXTREMELY nice and apologetic (he gets 4 stars), however our waiter was not and acted very defensive when we mentioned how we didn't appreciate what was going on all night.  \n\nNever in my life have I ever experienced such blatent rudeness... you  might expect this kind of behavior from a young child who doesn't know better, but not from adults.  ugh!! \n\nI'm a believer in 2nd chances, and I wouldn't want to cut this place from my list of favorite places to go either, but this was just one of the most completely ridiculous evenings I've ever had.", "author": "KL S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-03-27", "description": "This is an amazing place if you are into gnocchi or pasta or both.  Although we did not end up having the gnocchi, the pasta was one of the best i have had in a while.  They also seem to have a pretty decent collection of wine (though both my pals got beer - at an italian place, go figure).  The service was good, though there was a debate whether the waiter was just putting on an accent or was italian, not that it mattered anyway.  One thing though, the place gets pretty loud, especially if you are sitting next to a large group, so if a quiet evening with the wife/gf/[partner is your thing, then probably not the best place to be.  Overall, i was very impressed with the food, wine selection and the service.  Moderately priced (entrees were $15-$20) with large portions, and totally worth it.  We did not get the dessert (we were SOOO close to so many better dessert places) but I am sure it would have been great.  Highly recommend.", "author": "Pat T."}

One waiter ran that room like a true pro.   As for the food, we started with a nice salad of Romaine Lettuce, blue cheese, good tomatoes and a light dressing--not a caesar.  Very good salad.   We then had a pasta course and everyone ordered their Gnocchi which was everything it was hyped up to be.  Outstanding--best I've ever had.  Our main course was Veal Saltimbocca for me and Halibut for my wife.  We both thoroughly enjoyed this.  Both came with roasted potatoes and vegetables.  Very good portion and delicious.  For dessert I had a Cappucino Cake and my wife had the Tiramisu which was outstanding.  The cake was very good but the Tiramisu was better.  Great meal and we will go back.

I'm not an Italian food or North Beach specialist, so when my friends from out of town said they wanted to go there, I came to Yelp to research.  We went based on the strength of these reviews but I at least was severely disappointed.  They first sat us at a window table, which featured a somewhat dismal view of Stockton but seemed OK...until we noticed the 3 HUGE flies buzzing around the window.  I mean, literally like half an inch long.  We got reseated near the bar, which had no flies but also no ambience.  The place looked at least 30 years past its prime.  The carpet was ancient, threadbare and looked like it had never been cleaned.  There was no decor to speak of.  There were lots of movie star photos, but it was hard to believe any of them had ever been here.  We had our menus closed for fully 10 to 15 minutes before the waiter came by to take our order and we were starting to get annoyed.  This was on a Monday night and the place was not crowded at all.  The food was OK but nothing special and not particularly affordable either.  There was no pizza on the menu for my friends' little girl, which isn't the restaurant's fault but just be aware.  With all the delightful Italian restaurants in North Beach (some of which we walked by on the way back to my friends' car, which brought a comment or two), I felt like I let them down.  They were very nice and didn't say anything negative, but I will not return and would never recommend it.", "author": "Paul D."}

Best Italian meal I've had anywhere!!!

I had sole with polenta and vegetables - the sole was cooked to perfection, veggies delicious and polenta was so light and delicious - there are no words for how amazing it was. Valpolacella ripassa was one of the best bottles of wine - a tad pricey at $47 but it tasted like a $100 bottle.  My husband had shrimp and it was melt in your mouth!  Don't leave without the tiramisu - NEVER NEVER had anything this delicious!  Even our friends who said they didn't like tiramisu couldn't stop taking bites!
