A thowback to my Cambridge, MA days with the Pinkberry just outside the subway station in Harvard Square. Anyway, I digress....\n\nUnlike most of the other froyo spots in the city, you do have to ask the staff for samples, and they don't have as many flavors as the other spots, but choice paralysis is a real thing. I sampled the pomegranate, meyer lemon, and mango flavors. The pomegranate flavor wasn't that prominent, so it ended up being more of a slightly fruity tart. Lemon flavors done well are amazing-- lemon flavors done poorly taste like cleaning supplies. While this wasn't in the latter camp, I wasn't too sold on it. The mango was refreshingly standard. \n\nJust as I remember, the tart flavor is slightly sweet, and very refreshing. I'd reckon that a small with 2 flavors is enough for 2 people to share-- if you get a small with 1 flavor only, you definitely end up with less! Pro tip!", "author": "Nicole H."}

We were staying in Union Square and were craving a sweet snack, so we found a Pinkberry location and decided to get some.  I got the plain tart yogurt with strawberries, cheesecake bits, mochi balls, blueberried, and tapioca balls.  We took our froyo to-go and ate it at our hotel nearby.  It was a perfect afternoon snack as we rested in between activities on our trip.  \n\nIt was so good that we had it as a snack the next day as well!

This location is okay, the workers weren't the friendliest which put a damper on my visit. I'm a huge fan of cookie dough toppings and I was disappointed to see that the cookie dough quality has changed again, they're no longer peanut sized and circular, but they're even smaller and shaped kind of odd, like a flattened pill. It didn't taste like anything at all, not chocolate, and definitely not like cookie dough. I don't recommend getting the cookie dough topping here, I hope they change it back to what they had before. \n\nThe fruits were fresh and the mochi wasn't hard, which is good. But I do feel like it's overpriced for what I got. I had the smallest size with four toppings and the total was $5.25.

The second visit was better and my yogurt swirler piled on a reasonable amount of toppings. \n\nMy fam only gets one flavor in their cups and there's yogurt swirled at least 2\" past the rim, at least for a medium.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-05-20", "description": "I consider myself a Pinkberry fan. I don't partake of dairy, and their coconut milk coconut soft serve is what vegan dreams are made of. Oddly, my current city of residency houses a Pinkberry corporate office, but no Pinkberry stores. (What gives, people?!!) When I booked my ticket to Oakland last October, one thing I had my heart set on was visiting the Pinkberry store in San Francisco. Whether someone has known me for a day or a decade, the one thing that they can say about me is that I take my food VERY seriously. So excuse me while I go drama queen on this review. [Friend: Could you be any more dramatic?  Me: Hold my gluten-free Voss.]\n\nIt was a busy graduation weekend. On my last day in the city, we took a ferry, a bus, then a Lyft to get to this Pinkberry. I hopped out of the Lyft, hands flailing like Mary Tyler-Moore, cheesing like a Cheshire; I was uber excited to be here. I entered the store, ready to order by the pint. As I waited in line, I glanced at their flavor board to my right, even though I already knew what I wanted. I did a double-take. I cock-tilted my head like a confused puppy. My eyes focused, shifted, then glowered. The joyous sparkle in my eyes dissipated into a fuming glare. Original, Power Berry, Chocolate Hazelnut, Pomegranate, Pineapple, and Pinkie's Strawberry; these were the 6 available flavors posted on their wall.  None of them (not a single one) was dairy-free or vegan-friendly. I've been to many Pinkberry locations across the country and every one has had at least one non-dairy flavor in their daily rotation. Surely, the mistake was mine. I re-read the flavor list 5 more times, each time a little slower than the previous. The results never changed. My head snapped 90 degrees toward the soft serve dispensers. I desperately counted: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...a hope-filled attempt at turning water into wine, or in this case, inner-tears into vegan soft serve. But nope. There were only enough dispensers for the six dairy-ridden flavors and their swirled concoctions.  In vain, I made one last plea to the froyo gods. I asked the employees if they had any non-dairy options. They were indifferent to the pain with which I had been afflicted as they each offered up a simultaneous shrug and head shake. They could not have cared any less about the great lengths to which I had gone to get here, or how I had been salivating for months over their coconut milk coconut only to be devastatingly crushed by someone's brash decision to carry no vegan options even though this location's dedicated website specifically states that the coconut milk coconut is swirling daily. DAILY. DAILY? Just not on the day that I decide to take the trek across Westeros to get it! In shock and disbelief, I stood in the middle of the store contemplating my life. What was I to do? WWJD?  Nothing. Nothing that I nor Jon Snow did would bring me my precious. So I reined in my lividness, grabbed the store manager's card from an employee who was dismissive of my visible distress, and pivot-sashayed out that door, vowing never to return again.", "author": "Tigra C."}

This is the easiest to get to location for me since we always seem to be at Macy's lately. Being in Union Square, it's also BART accessible which is a big plus for me. \n\nIt's the tiniest of shops that you can possibly manage with a few seats outside. Don't plan on spending much time here beyond what it takes to place your order.\n\nWhat was different for me was that you pay by size and not by weight which is different from many of the other froyo chains. Since the folks serve it up to you instead of going the self serve route, you can easily get a large size in a medium, as well as get screwed by ordering a large, yet only getting a medium amount of froyo. Overall it kinda works and the prices aren't too shabby. Especially for this touristville downtown shopping area.\n\nThe Coconut Milk Swirl is pretty much just that. It tastes like sweetened coconut milk that's been chilled and swirled into a soft serve consistency. I'm sure there's plenty of mystery ingredients but it tastes plenty refreshing, yet with some substance unlike sorbet style froyo. It's listed as Vegan on their website so I'll take their word for it. I'm not a huge fan of fruit based froyo so this is a great alternative for Vegan folk that are looking to indulge just like everyone else.\n\nThis was the creamiest of the Vegan froyos that I've tried so far. It would be amazing to see what they can do with the base coconut milk flavor and hopefully expand to coffee, chocolate, etc. For now, I'll be satisfied with a cup of this with fresh berries, and of course you gotta throw in some mochi and popping boba to top it off properly.", "author": "John B."}

Not too shabby!\n\nDespite it being a fairly frigid night in SF (surprise, surprise), my frozen yogurt was just about perfect!  The yogurt had a nice, creamy consistency and the lychee flavor was just right - strong enough to taste, but not so strong as to be disgusting.  I could go either way with getting the Chocolate Wafers again, but the mochi is practically a must get topping.

We won't lie, we did get a little turned around trying to find it while visiting Union Square, felt a little hidden with the construction and everything going on.\n\nThe staff was pretty nice overall, one guy spotted my Jacksonville Jaguars hat and made some small talk. However one other guy didn't seem like he really wanted to wait for us to decide what we wanted(considering my wife had never had PB until now, she didn't know what toppings or flavors she was looking for) but minus this one guy our experience was pretty good overall.\n\nThankfully it was a nice night so we sat outside at their little patio/chairs area and watched people walk by, the inside we believe had a little section to sit at but looked like someone else beat us to it.\n\nEither way, with the little issues we had the wife loves it(as do I) so we will make time to come back the next time we visit SF.", "author": "John C."}

Why took them so long?\"\n\nThere should've been a Pinkberry shop in San Fran when Bush was president- \"George H.W. Bush!\"\n\nI don't know if frozen yogurt was a huge trend back then, unlike now.\n\nThe shop is busy with six different flavors to choose from. \n\nI came here and checked-in twice within the same week. My first visit, I had a small Peanut Butter flavor ($4.95) with two toppings including one premium topping for an extra $.50. I was first introduced to the Peanut Butter flavor when I was in San Diego and I loved that damn flavor. But I was surprised that the exclusive flavor was served in the summer at the new shop. I had crumbled almond roca candy and PB toffee (exclusive topping for extra $.50) with PB fro-yo. I couldn't tell you what a memorable first visit to the SF shop. I love the treat. My first treat: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I-2sRRTxnKqjozpPMhR8lQ?select=bghx9WfbItRxvFCtpQhfYw#sIKWjhaAC_jvZtNy1IkwxQ\n\nMy second visit, I ordered an Original tart and Strawberry flavor in a medium cup (I was hungry after my run). I also added chopped strawberries and a waffle cookie with my treat. Strawberry is a popular fruit in the summer. But my chopped fruit was still frozen. I don't know what to say. But I still love Pinkberry's version of Original Tart. Nice and creamy is perfected by the company. My second treat: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I-2sRRTxnKqjozpPMhR8lQ?select=lSQAoLyYmDaPIWfrJ2tYLw#RZHlSpPc124AgHojTz5j6A\n\nDon't forget to get your stamped card-buy 10, get the 11th free. \n\nNow I don't need to go to the Peninsula or San Diego to get my Pinkberry frozen treat. \n\nThe new Pinkberry is now a big hit in San Francisco.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-07-20", "description": "My excitement over a Pinkberry in SF is somewhere lost in the wayback machine since it's taken well over seven years for the ballyhooed, LA-based froyo chain to make it within our city limits. That's a long time coming in froyo years, which go by so much faster than even dog years. In the meantime, so many mini-chains have popped up serving tasty froyo that I haven't felt a recent hankering for Pinkberry, everybody's Rosetta Stone for such treats. I am reminded of the scene in \"All About Eve\" when critic Addison DeWitt told aging diva Margo Channing that rising actress Eve Harrington was full of fire and music just like her back in the day. Margo's response? \"Yes, that's me - an old kazoo with some sparklers.\"\n\nThe Pinkberry at Union Square is a bit like an old kazoo with some sparklers even though it is spanking new. It's also quite small and given that it just opened, intensely crowded with a busy crew of young Asians (or as David Sedaris would call them - \"youth in Asia\" or more appropriately, \"euthanasia\") manning the spigots and the little ladles for the multitude of toppings (see photo). Jamie W. and I were overwhelmed by the number of flavors on the board, but he chose smartly with the $3.50 small cup of the Peanut Butter and nothing else. I, on the other hand, went to town and ordered the $4.50 medium cup of Watermelon strewn with chunks of strawberry, mango and pineapple - a calorific cornucopia of tropical madness (see photo). Sure it was good but hardly distinctive anymore. Do I hear a kazoo?\n\nFROYO - 3 stars...creamier than I remembered and certainly tasty enough but frankly not all that memorable\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...clean but really cramped\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...perky youth in Asia like what you see on a propaganda poster\nTOTAL - 3 stars...is Pinkberry the La Boulange of the froyo world?", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-07", "description": "Yogurt is on point here, *snap snap* I have a high tendency to avoid any flavored froyo, so I'm only writing about their original tart. \n\nWhat I like about their yogurt is their stiff texture that doesn't melt easily like Yogurtland's. You still get to pick as many toppings as you like, sometimes they carry more varieties such as mango, raspberry, or pomegranate. I'm a big fruit, so I tend to get those toppings rather than the sprinkles, wafer cookies, etc. The fruit toppings are fairly fresh, their kiwis and strawberries are never too ripe. Their store is fairly clean since only the employees there can put the toppings on, so customers don't really make that huge mess. Even though their store is small, they have quite a bit of employees on shift, so don't get scared away if you see a line out the door. \n\nThey have a few tables outside and a standing area to the right of the store. The setup is a bit strange since the cashier is far from the standing area. So if you were to pay for your yogurt and head to the standing area, you either have to exit the store and re-enter or push your way through the people ordering their yogurt. Half the time I just buy it and go, so it doesn't bother me too much.\n\nWhat I don't really like is the consistency in service. Yea, you get those good days, bad days with the employees like any other place out there. I'm talking about topping placement. It's like making a piece of sculpture so the toppings wouldn't fall back into their bins. Some are more skillful than others and can place more than 5 fruit cubes onto the yogurt cone, but that's a bit tough to see often. If you plan to choose more than 2 toppings of ample amounts, just order one or two sizes up.\n\nOh and they do have a loyalty program. Free small yogurt when you buy 10 yogurts or for your birthday.", "author": "Connie C."}

I go to school in Berkeley and was the girl who squealed when I heard free Pinkberry on campus. I always wondered why there wasn't a location closer to Berkeley (other locations are at SFO and Santana Row in SJ).\n\nLast Thursday, I barted to the city because I needed to return something at Neiman Marcus. I am very directionally challenged and got lost walking there from the bart station; luckily my boyfriend came to my rescue. We were walking down O'Farrell when I saw the bright white lights and color scheme that I am oh so familiar with. I immediately ran into the store with the biggest grin on my face and ordered my usual (small original with fruit toppings).\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with how Pinkberry works, you first pick a size (S, M, L). Then, if you want to add toppings, you pay a little extra and you are allowed to add as many as you want that'll fit in the cup! Yum. Pinkberry's taste is unmatched by any of its competitors; it is so refreshing and provides just the right amount of tartness that always leaves me wanting more.\n\nThis location doesn't disappoint. They apparently stopped doing the physical stamp cards though and have converted to using a mobile app that will allow you to pay with it and keep track of all your purchases.\n\nTIP: Download the free Pinkberry app for your smartphone and you will be given a code for a FREE SMALL WITH TOPPINGS that can be used that same day!

My favorite from the past has been the Salted Caramel. They also have lots of great toppings, including Mochi.  The fresh fruit is always tasty and makes it a bit \"healthier\" for me, after I add the cookies and candies.\n\nThe space is a bit small, they didn't have seating for the adjoining room available, yet.

But comparing Pinkberry to some of the other fro-yo places I've been in the past - TCBY, I'm looking at you - even if it's not self-serve, reminds me of how awesome it really is.\n\nIt did take us about ten minutes to find it, because for some reason we thought it might be in the basement level. But nope, its entrance is out on OFarrell like one reviewer said - thank goodness for that reviewer, otherwise I would have been so sad.\n\nI definitely recommend the plain tart. It does have sugar, but not very much and you can taste the tangy yogurt flavor so you know it's not just frozen whey juice. Also, they don't use high-fructose corn syrup in their yogurt mixes. Staff was really nice, helpful, and talkative just the right amount.", "author": "Amanda P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-07-18", "description": "The yogurt at Pinkberry deserves 5 stars for sure.  Compared to the DIY yogurt joints where the yogurt tends to be overly-watery, PB's yogurt is thick and creamy!  There tend to be half a dozen flavors (some for a limited time) such as original, mango, watermelon, chocolate, peanut butter.  I usually sample one of the featured flavors but almost always go back to the original, which is simple and refreshing.\n\nThe prices are a little steep for the quantity that you get.  PB is a far cry from a value.  It's nearly $5 bucks for a small with toppings.  You choose your cup size, choose your yogurt flavor, and choose toppings or no toppings.  Pricing is based on size and topping vs. no topping.\n\nAnother gripe: the store is very cramped and there is very little seating inside, basically a small counter in the front window.  I was here on an overcast Tuesday evening, so I imagine that I would avoid this place like a plague on a hot weekend day...this place would be mad busy!!\n\nI'd recommend grabbing your yogurt to-go and hiking a block up to sit at Union Square or a block down to sit at the cool, new sidewalk bench and table installation in front of H&M and Walgreens.\n\nOverall, the yogurt is the best part of PB.  Everything else about the experience such as pricing and ambiance leaves a lot to be desired.", "author": "Matt S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-10-23", "description": "At the heart of San Francisco, this is a great spot to get frozen yogurt. The quality of the yogurt is richer than most of the yogurt places around (even though Pinkberry is a chain). The selection of toppings is overwhelming at times. There's just TOO MANY choices! Pinkberry is also good at switching out the flavors of yogurt so you're not stuck choosing from the same flavors all the time. Though I do enjoy the grapefruit and green tea froyo, there is nothing like the richness of the original tart yogurt. The staff here is friendly and they do give generous portions of both toppings and frozen yogurt. The only downside is that there isn't a lot of seating space. There's a couple of seats inside and a couple of chairs and tables outside. Other than that, this place is a definite must to fulfill your froyo needs. Also, if you're a frequent froyo connoisseur, get their store card to earn points every time you buy something from there. You'll get one point per order and a free frozen yogurt once you earn 10 points.", "author": "Lisa H."}

The staff was just a tad bit too perky and there was too many choices, so I opted for one straight from the poster on the wall:  chocolate, hazelnut with a drizzle of syrup. I am proud to say I resisted and got the really small size -- but have to admit I went back for a second one just a few hours later.  As long as I keep my little shift in the shoe salon, Pinkberry's may be my go to spot.", "author": "Robert M."}

She was really rude not smiling and completely rushed my order I could tell my yogurt was under it was a smaller portion than the norm ! She re weighed it and look confused and then just asked me what toppings I wanted. When she rang me out she completely rushed the transaction and was rude!

When they have it I love this place, but when they don't it becomes somewhat difficult to choose.  I've been here a few times and I've ventured into a few flavors, such as Mango and Pomegranate, but Coconut is my go to choice.  I prefer the more tart flavors than the sweet, just my preference, but I've enjoyed most of the flavors here.  As for the toppings they have a good variety and you can pretty much \"fill the cup\" with up to 5 toppings.  My usual choices involve fruit, almonds, coconut flakes, mochi.  I usually go if I'm in the area.  The biggest downfall is probably paying $6 for a medium with toppings.  That seems pricy, but that's just me.  Also they are doing away with the stamp cards, and are starting to use an App, but if you download the app and get a card you get a free small with toppings, so there's that.", "author": "Jeremaine R."}

Since there wasn't one in SF in the past, I believe I dealt with either SFO or Palo Alto.  They had exceptional customer service and were very informed.  Sadly, SF is lacking that.  I asked for all the information in regards to ordering a drop off catering for August (I emailed them back in June. I like to plan ahead and be thorough).  They gave me the prices, options, and advised me the cost of delivery.  (Which went up.  SFO or PA used to charge $15, but I'm not complaining).  Mind you, this is a small child's birthday party.  After having to constantly ask if the flavors were the same as they kept changing it (they never went out of their way to advise me of the flavor changes time to time like they said they would), I finally decided not to ask until the week of the event.  One time it took them an entire weekend to reply back to my email.  I had to resend it again.  Anyway, I finally go to inform them what I would like to order.  At that point (not 2 months ago or a few weeks ago... Literally THREE days before the event), finally decided to tell me there's a $100 minimum to order delivery.  What the hell am I supposed to do with $100 worth of frozen yogurt?  I do not need to fill these kids up with all that sugar.  Why couldn't they have told me this a  long time ago?  Why just now?  Screw that.  I'm pissed off that I have to deal with these people who just now decided to add that bit of information.  No thank you.  At this point, I will happily order from else where and give them my business and recommendations when it comes to catering, even if I have to pay a bit more.  It's the principle.  I'm highly disappointed at these people and their customer service and lack of common sense when it comes to timing.  If you want to get catering from pinkberry, make sure it's not from the SF location.  They could really care less about your event.", "author": "R. A. D."}

I got salted caramel with no toppings- wanted to see how the yogurt stood alone (like the cheese, get it? The farmer in the Dell, the cheese stands alone?) Anyway, it was pretty delicious. I also loved the way they placed the toppings on my friends orders- very artful, not just dumping a spoonful of m&m's on there- no, none of that. I appreciate aesthetics, cuz I'm an artist and all. Go, enjoy. A little pricey, hence 4 instead of 5, also because you can only sit outside.TIP* park in the o'Farell (can't spell) garage, esp. at night. 6-midnight it only costs ONE DOLLA, and PB is right across the street.", "author": "Nina N."}

I also like Yoppi Yogurt's texture, as it resembles soft serve and is not watery like other frozen yogurt places in town (that I will not name). \n\nPinkberry is however more costly then other frozen yogurt places - where price is based on cup size, but at a premium price, you are granted unlimited toppings.\n\nI tried their watermelon (which was refreshing with tartness) and their peanut butter (it was rich in peanut butter flavor). I know that the combination might sound odd and that the actual fruit and nut are not a match made in heaven, but flavor wise, it actually worked. I wish there were flavors like red velvet, taro, or even other cake batter flavors (which I suppose is fine, because if all frozen yogurt places carried the same flavor, it's not original in the long run). \n\nI also want Red Mango to come to San Francisco (bah, I ain't going all the way to Emeryville just for frozen yogurt).
