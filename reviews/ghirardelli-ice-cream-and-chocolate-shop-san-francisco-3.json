We split the Cookie Bits Sundae, which comes with vanilla and cookies 'n cream ice cream (my favorite ice cream), handmade hot fudge, whipped cream, Ghirardelli Chocolate Chip Cookie crumbles and two Ghirardelli Milk Chocolate Caramel minis. I do not know how else to describe the sundae except for that it was decadent and wonderful - oftentimes the simplest ingredients are the best. The ice cream is rich and creamy, the hot fudge is made from their own chocolates (no artificial aftertaste), the chocolate chip cookie crumbles provide a delightful crunch, and the milk chocolate caramel minis add a burst of flavor. We finished the entire sundae in one sitting, even though I'm pretty sure it was meant for 4+ people to split! Service is prompt, and we only waited 5-10 minutes for our sundae to come out.\n\n Unfortunately, as it is located at the heart of the city, it's not as charming as the Ghirardelli Square location is, and there are constantly people entering and exiting the store simply to browse. If you are a tourist in SF for the first time and want to get the truest, most authentic Ghirardelli experience, I would recommend making the trek to Ghirardelli Square near the Embarcadero. I also visited Ghirardelli Square during my summer in SF, and the ambience & ocean views are incredible. Especially because there is an outdoor seating area / patio, Ghirardelli Square is the best place to share an ice cream on a sunny day!", "author": "Claire L."}

Sometimes there's someone there that is super enthused to help you find the right gift items for your occasion, others, there's a person who comes off as if that day is the worst day of his/her life, so you shouldn't even make eye contact, much less ask them a question about a product, because it will just end badly/sadly. \n\nI definitely try to shop during non-peak hours, early morning or later evening so I can mix and match baskets, or check out their new gift items without having to dodge a lot of people there to order hot beverages or giant ice cream creations. There are great items wrapped up in pretty packaging or SF-themed if you're looking for family gifts, holiday treats, or corporate packages. \n\nThe shop is definitely adorable, it's in the corner of the historic Palace hotel, and the set up is like an old fashion soda fountain. Definitely one of those tourist traps when it comes to the $10-$12 ice cream sundaes, but it's a festive experience and you can sit along the windowsill making passersby/foot commuters jealous with the massive ice cream creations. \n\nSuggestion: espresso-based drinks/coffees are often on the weak side, so save your caffeine trip for the coffeehouses, and keep your visit ice cream and chocolate-focused.", "author": "Alison A."}

It's busy and expensive, but the wait is usually worth it. Try to get your hands on one of the paper menus so you can decide what you want to eat while you're waiting. There are several specialty sundaes but I think the build your own is the way to go. It's not widely known that they offer sugar free vanilla ice cream. I usually get that with their delicious hot fudge (not sugar free) and marshmallow topping (also not sugar free) on top. I realize I am a walking contradiction but I don't care!\n\nIn the back there's a chocolate machine with melted chocolate that smells so good and is fun to watch. It's a self-guided \"tour\" and seems to really intrigue children. \n\nMake sure you pay a visit to the adjacent chocolate shop too: you'll be given a free sample square (individually sealed) of a delicious Ghirardelli chocolate candy!

And there we go, the secret to this treat was the nice thick and creamy consistency of real dairy. Of course there was whipped cream, sprinkled with chopped nuts, along with chocolate syrup.

I do wish they were less heavy handed with the whip cream though as the entire first bite for both of us was all whipped cream and strange that they do not remove your # after they serve you your order.  That meant having to pick up the sticky number tag and return to the counter yourself.  \n\nBut overall, enjoy having an easier to get to location for a decadent Sundae fix.", "author": "Joyce Z."}

The store is small with limited seating, by there is additional seating outside.  Today was actually a super hot day but still this place was hopping with a line and seats were full. Many people also enjoyed their purchase to go and walk and enjoy the area around the water.\nWhen you walk in they served us their today's choice of chocolate, as my husband stated, wow this is actually super good!  He thought it was just a huge hype because of the name and now gets why people love it.  So smooth and tasty it makes you want to buy everything in the store.  That small start of a teaser can get you to want more and before you know it you bought ice cream and chocolates to take home to family.\nSomething about buying the chocolate from the store makes it more valuable then buying it from the grocery store. \nIf you are close to this store you gotta check it out, it's one of popular San Fran things to do while in town.", "author": "Sanaz M."}

We were kind of hesitant about ordering because we weren't sure if we would find a seat since it's self-seating.\n\nAfter we placed our orders, a few tables became available so we took a seat and waited for our desserts.  My nephew had the 2 scoops of ice cream on a waffle cone.  He actually asked for one scoop of chocolate, but I wanted to try the butter pecan so I just added that extra scoop to his order.  I went with a large cup of sea salted caramel hot cocoa minus the whip.\n\nFor a pretty expensive chocolatier, I was expecting the food to show up in a more presentable manner; the ice cream on the waffle cone showed up lying down on a platter, which definitely made for an ugly photo op.  At least the ice cream tasted better than they looked.  Their butter pecan is probably one of best that I've tasted.  The chocolate wasn't too bad either.\n\nHowever, my hot cocoa was extremely sweet.  So sweet to the point that my throat started to hurt as soon as I took a few sips.  I had to ask for ice water just to wash all that sugar down.  My hot cocoa was supposed to be served with a side of milk chocolate square, but I guess they must have forgotten because I never got one.\n\nI'll probably never come back being that parking is already a pain, and to top that off, the desserts just aren't worth the extra trip.  I would've been happier with my Godiva soft serve at this point.", "author": "Sivilay T."}

Went here today around 3-4ish with a couple friends visiting from out of town. One was severely allergic to different types of nuts so we double precaution and asked for no nuts(almonds from the twin peak sunday). \n\nWhen we got our sundae we didn't taste the almonds until we were halfway through eating it. Honestly I didn't want almonds anyway. I quickly went to the people making it and asked if they could remake it because there was nuts in and my friend was ALLERGIC to nuts. \n\nFor some reason, one of the workers came back to us and asked if we had chocolate in our sundae(yes?!) and  even though I kept saying yes and that I got the twin peaks one, she sounded hella confused acting like she didn't know what was on the menu when the menu specifically said there was chocolate in the twin peaks sundae... AND THEN SHE SAID \"there's almonds, not nuts in this\" and in my head I'm like ??? Isn't almonds a specific nut? And even if I was wrong I still meant that I didn't want almonds in my damn sundae anyways. Idk why she even telling us this.. cus obviously someone can be allergic to multiple nuts...\n\nThe order comes back and the top icecream is fine but the middle part HAD ALMONDS AGAIN. I'm assuming they didn't even remake it but added new icecream to the top without almonds. We didn't even finish it once I ate it again and found almonds STILL IN IT. Next time inform your staff that if someone says they're allergic, don't freaking question it and make a freaking NEW one because you're gambling with people's LIVES. He might of not been severely allergic to almonds specifically, but someone else could of been and because of your careless, lazy employees(there was like 5 behind that counter) they could of died or had to go to the hospital.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

They are currently selling 80 minis or 80 of their regular chocolates (which are heavier) for about $27.95 which is really worth it for so much chocolates!\n\nThis environment is very open and has plenty of seats for those who would like to sit down for a sundae or a drink. We got the brownie sundae (treasure island) in a waffle bowl for about $13.50. The brownie was delicious, it was chewy, with a lot of fudge beneath it. The ice cream was alright, well of course, Ghirardelli specializes in chocolate, so I wouldn't expect their ice cream to be amazing. Their waffle bowl was dipped in chocolate, usually in other places, you would need to pay extra, but I suppose for a chocolate shop, chocolate dipped waffle bowl is the only option. It had a little TOO much chocolate in my opinion, I would like it if it had less chocolate, so I can have a taste to the waffle bowl, or I would hope that they can give an option of a waffle bowl without chocolate.\n\nThe staff are really friendly as one of them kindly let me know that she will be right with me to open the washroom door (code) for me as she was finishing up checkout for another customer.", "author": "Kristy N."}

I came around 4:30pm on a Thursday, and while relatively busy, there were plenty of seats/tables open. I ordered the salted caramel brownie sundae ($14.50) and a vanilla latte ($5.95). The sundae was absolutely gorgeous and delicious, but I was defeated about 1/4-1/3 in, so bring a few friends with you! The latte was also made well, and I was a fan. In addition to brownie sundaes, they also serve regular sundaes, sorbet, ice cream scoops and cones, shakes and floats, hot chocolate, and other types of tea/coffee. The price of their sundaes is definitely a bit higher than I expected, but it would be very difficult for one person to finish it, and worth it as a \"treat yoself\" moment. There is also plenty of chocolate in their gift shop- I bought a few gifts (including a SanFran-themed chocolate box) for friends, but they also had their square chocolate in every flavor. While waiting in line to order, I was also given a free square of chocolate, which made me happy. Overall, I'm really glad I tried this place- it was fun!", "author": "Lisa S."}

However, I'm not feeling that much electricity about the place, especially on a quiet, wintry weeknight when barely a soul could be found in search of a chocolate fix.

With the holiday we had fewer choices than normal.  We were both late meeting for various reasons and she wanted to warm up so I simply headed to Ghiridelli's at 2 Montgomery street.\n\nI consider the price high more like at the Wharf than for downtown... I wound up spending almost $30 for basically 2 brownies with ice cream and coffee for the gal and a medium shake for myself.\n\nThe service was exceptionally poor in my opinion - greeted at the door then left hanging.  It would appear you order at the counter near the door but don't -- you have to go to the back register. \n\nMy medium shake was too dark and bitter for my taste.  I would have preferred the McDonald's $4 shake which tastes better and is not so dark.  For the price and quality I think it was too little and too tasteless.  I also resent them charging 10% sales tax including the 4% for healthcare.  If they take an order at the table and bring it to the table OK, but when you have to stand in line to order and only have a person slowly bring it to the table and set it down this does not merit in my opinion and additional 4% on the tab for people just doing their jobs.  Tell the cheapies at Ghiridelli to pay up for their employees health care your prices are high enough to cover it already.\n\nIf some dumbo just off the boat or just in from SFO thinks this is great welcome to suckerville San Francisco wants to fleece you.  I guess this works at the wharf but the real joke is on the tourists because real San Franciscans never go to the wharf.

Wow, they sure are everywhere, as Ed U. mentioned in his Yelp! review. I remember this location at New Montgomery and Market used to be a bespoke/custom shirt place. Bespoke shirts made-to-measure and order.\n\nI was definitely in the mood for a hot fudge sundae even though I had lunch. When I walked in, I was ambushed with an offer of a Ghirardelli chocolate and caramel sample by a sales associate. I declined the offer and asked if they had any samples without caramel. Unfortunately, these were the only samples being offered that day. I then stated I was only stopping by for a hot fudge sundae. I was then directed to the till to place my order. \n\nWhen I got to the till, I inquired about the hot fudge sundae sizes to the young woman at the order terminal. She told me I could get either a one scoop or a two scoop. I opted for a one scoop. She then proceeded to explain taking the number to the table and that my order would be brought to me. Pretty cut and dry.\n\nAs soon as I selected a table and sat down, the ambushing sales associate brought me my hot fudge sundae. Wow, that was pretty fast. It was not crowded at all, not that busy, that's for sure. There were two tables already occupied and one person sitting at the window counter. It started to get a tad bit busier by the time I left. There were two women getting ready to sit down as I was leaving. I asked the sales associate now performing the role of server as to where to put my dirty dishes. He told me to leave it on the table.\n\nWell, this one is A-OK. The service was all right. It just does not have the ambiance of the original Ghiradelli Ice Cream and Chocolate Shop in the Fishermen's Wharf area. With the chocolate being rolled back and forth and back and forth. . . .

The sundae tasted pretty bland without it, especially the vanilla scoop, since there weren't enough cookie pieces to flavor it without the fudge.\n\nAlso my friend ordered two scoops of ice cream and they only gave him one scoop. When he questioned them about it they said it was hidden in the waffle cone under the first scoop and he just couldn't see it. He was skeptical, but went ahead and ate through. Once he got to where the second flavor should be, it wasn't there.

Upon entering, like any other Ghirardelli, you're treated to a complimentary piece of chocolate. This chocoholic's heaven is lined wall to wall with perfectly stacked, wrapped, and packaged containers of chocolate. Honestly, who knew that a company that produces only square pieces of chocolate would find so many ways to package their product? \n\nAnyways, I come here pretty much only for their house-made treats: ice cream and drinks. Pick up a menu near the check-out counter and feel free to peek at the tables of other sweet-toothed patrons along the way. There are plenty of seats here to sit and enjoy your dessert! Best part is since they offer coffee to the early risers, the rest of the shop is open early too for crack-of-dawn sugar emergencies. Bathroom requires an employee to unlock for you, a little annoying when you're in a rush or the employees are busy. Don't be afraid though - they're pretty friendly and can get the job done.\n\nIf you're here you probably already know what Ghirardelli chocolate is like - if not go ahead and take a bite of that freebie you got walking through the door. Yeah? Silky sweet. Okay, imagine that in ice cream/shake/hot chocolate form... Whatever you're thinking will be pretty accurate. You can never outgrow a good hot chocolate, but even the small size packs quite the diabetic-punch. I opt for the Sea Salt Caramel Hot Cocoa to try and get a little more balance, but the sea salt usually all ends up at the bottom so it's all in vain. Ice cream is oh-so-delicious, even on the coldest and windiest days. But their shakes? To die for.

It's more geared towards the locals and they do the same things at every other Ghirardelli: hand out free chocolate, sell bulk chocolate, and have hefty portions of ice cream and sundaes without the crowds, long lines and fighting for a table to sit at.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-27", "description": "I used to work at this Ghirardellii, so I can probably provide some fairly descent tips for all of you who want to improve your Ghirardelli experience ;)\n\nTip #1: Firstly, I must strain that Ghirardelli uses DREYERS icecream. If you come into the store and buy a single scoop of ice-cream with no toppings, you are wasting your money. THE TOPPINGS ARE WHAT MAKE THE ICECREAM.\n\nTip #2: If you order a sundae, such as the Ghirardelli famous Hot Fudge sundae, I urge you to ask for your hot fudge ON THE SIDE. Otherwise, the Hot Fudge will melt the ice-cream, and you will be left with a puddle. It happened all the time while I worked there, and it left a lot of people unhappy.\n\nTip #3: There are a lot of specialty sundaes/beverages that are not provided on the menu. Ask about the Domingo, the Marina Sundae, the Muir Woods, the Seacliff, and the drinking chocolate.\n\nTip #4: Customize your order! One of the best parts of Ghirardelli was that anything in the menu could be customized to your palate. Add butterscotch, a second cherry, marshmallow syrup, dark chocolate fudge, pineapples, and a variety of other savory treats to really improve your experience. \n\nTip #6: For all of you coffee lovers, i recommend you not to waste your money here. Ghirardelli beverages are not as good as its ice creams. The coffee, espressos, lattes, and cappuccinos are fairly average quality and fairly high costing. The Hot chocolate can be good, but it is very sweet, so you must keep that in mind. ALSO, While the brownies and cookies are delicious, they are NOT made in the store, but rather shipped in frozen. They are also VERY sweet, so keep that in mind. If that doesnt bother you, feel free to try them :)\n\nTip #7: My final tip is basically just some of the sundaes which I liked most. Unlike most of the yelp reviews on  here, I have been able to try every single flavor of ice-cream, topping, milkshake, chocolate, and sundae that the store has sold. \n\nFavorite icecream: plain Icecream is really nothing special at Ghirardelli. Id say that the mint and blackcherry have the most accurate flavors though.\n\nFavorite topping: All of Ghirardellis toppings are shipped in pre-canned except for the fudge, which is made right in the store, and because the store specializes in chocolate, I highly recommend it. \n\nFavorite milkshake: the Quake shakes are by far the best milkshakes in the store. My favorite is the seasalt caramel quake shake, but you cant go wrong with any option.\n\nFavorite Chocolate: All of the Ghirardelli chocolate is delectable, but each has an important characteristic. For dark chocolate lovers, its important to remember that the higher the cacao percentage is, the more bitter the chocolate will be. 86% dark chocolate is very bitter, while 60% is typical dark chocolate. As for the flavored chocolates, I dont recommend the brownie fillings. They are too sweet (which is a common flaw in the store). You can never go wrong with sample chocolates. Typically, caramel chocolate and Sea Salt Almond are the most popular, as well as my personal favorites.\n\nGood luck! Enjoy the store. It has a lot to offer ;)", "author": "David D."}

When I think of Ghirardelli ice cream shops, I think of the best-ever cookie sundae in the best-ever waffle bowl.  The Colossal Chocolate Chip Cookie lives up to its name--if that massive piece of baked goodness is only half, I don't even want to know how my stomach would feel if I hate the full cookie!  The cookie is delicious, and I'll leave it at that.  \n\nThe ice cream is very good--quality, but nothing fancy.  The vanilla knows its role is to only complement the cookie and waffle bowl, which is does with remarkable ability.  The fudge is, of course, outstanding; however, the real standout here is the waffle bowl.  Perfect in every way and only enhanced by Ghirardelli's delicious chocolate coating the edges.  It is so good that I think it would be perfectly reasonable to order just the waffle bowl, maybe with a glass of milk on the side.  Though, I wouldn't that.

Born & raised in this city, paying the ever growing rent, you have to imagine days off are spent recovering And getting ready for the next work day. I cAme to ghirardelli to reward myself After a very arduous work week.\n\nThey ran out of numbers during my transaction, when the cashier(Wendy) was offered a number to assign me she passed on it. She informed me that they would \"scream out your name from the middle of the bar\" and swiftly told me that my sundae would come in glass. I look forward to these events for myself. The cold ice cream, hot fudge, sweet cherries, and light whipped cream are what makes the nostalgia come over me as I savor the flavors.\nI finally find a seat and patiently wait only to see the few patrons in front of me receive their confections in glass, metal dishes, real spoons. So, when I heard my name being called out I happily made the trip to the bar only to be carelessly handed my dessert in plastic. I took what I paid for and enjoyed it. I then see patrons that were behind me receive their dessert in glass, with a smile, and friendly service.\nAll I got from the server, James, was a sort of \"take your sundae, be happy we made you one, and get out\" service as he joked with his co worker. I saw James prepare a sundae for 2 young ladies very very carefully. And here I was 2 bites into my sundae and my fudge was frozen over, hard to chew, and running over. Plastic does not hold the fudge over as glass. As I struggled to eat with my plastic spoon I just felt sad. Here I am, working hard to make a living in the city and the one time I feel to reward myself I get looked over on the one thing I wanted to enjoy that day.  I will not bring my money back to spend here.  The managers really need to take into consideration that consistency in service and what they put out remains in the heads of people who frequent this establishment. Why wasn't I given a number? How come I didn't get it in a glass? The supervisor, young Filipino man with a pony tail And the manAger,  should see the value in consistency and coming thru on what you say.\n\nWendy.... If you say something is going to happen AND you take the customers money right after, it's better you don't lie. And when you see that your word wasn't enough, correct it. That's great customer service.\n\nJames... Next time don't rub your face and hair without washing your hands before assembling food.
