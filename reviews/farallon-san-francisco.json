But part of me cerebrates it could have been because I took so long to get ready.\n\nA short romantic getaway to San Francisco turned into a tragic novel. I wanted to take her to a memorable dinner. Goal achieved. After spending an inordinate amount of time researching romantic restaurants I conclusively made a calculated risk and culled this well reviewed establishment. I made a deplorable cull. \n\nTactfully authoritatively mandated a bottle of Qupe Syrah and was brought a bottle of Krug Champagne. Our precious time was wasted as I wanted to seduce her shortly after this repast and commence a night full of zealousness and smooth jazz.  Erroneous.\n\nCommenced with the shrimp cocktail. Prawns were astronomically immense and chilled as expected. She gave me the last one on the plate which told me that so far things were going well. I optate I could have prehended this moment because the turning point was expeditiously approaching. \n\nWe then injuctively authorized the Octopus appetizer which tasted as though I was licking a BBQ that had not been cleaned and accumulated years of salty burnt charcoal. There was additionally a minuscule filet of fish to the side which was cooked medium rare. Why? I haven't the slightest conception. Erroneous.\n\nShort Ribs were our next excursion. I can't explicate the taste because I was diligently asking myself why this course was marked with a steak knife. The taste we experienced perpetuated to be a component of both our breathes the rest of the evening and into the morning. I stared off into the distance and found a painting of a jellyfish to divert me so I wouldn't ask her how everything was. Additionally, spaghetti squash. I'm skeptical. It came with swiss chard too right? It was like a bundle of spinach mated with an arugula plant then proceeded to bathe in the excess juice from canned corn. Again, I do not know.\n\nThe coffee was good and so was the bus boy.  \n\nLet it be known that there was no seduction, no zealousness, no congenial breathe, just inelegant silence the rest of the evening. I held in my emotions until I flew back to Los Angeles and entered my habitation. I immediately ambulated into my restroom, divested, turned the shower on and spent a good portion of my evening crying while sitting down in the bath tub.\n\nI am now single but optimistic about what the future brings. These events inspired me to commence a 5 year plan in order to monetarily increase my value as a human being. Also never trust CitiBank with your money, they are a bunch of willy nilly clowns. \n\nIf any half asian women are reading this please feel in liberty to drop off an application, I am currently not looking to hire but will ecstatically prehend a head shot and resume for future reference.", "author": "Tim A."}

It's offered daily from 4:30 to 6 pm and includes a selection of food and drinks at either $5 or $7.\n\nI arrived a little after 5 pm and the lounge was pretty empty. There were a couple parties there but I was able to snag a spot pretty easily. It never got full over the course of the 2 hours we were there.\n\nThe decor is done beautifully here. As a primarily seafood spot, Farallon goes all out to add touches of marine life everywhere. I particularly enjoyed the jellyfish lights and the columns designed to invoke the image of marine plants.\n\nFor drinks, I had their classic margarita and the Hemingway daiquiri ($7 each). Both drinks were okay, but my daiquiri was way too sour compared to my friend's which was much sweeter. I had to send it back to the bar to have them fix it. I was a little bit disappointed that the same drink could taste so different when made at the same bar.\n\nFor food, we split the fish 'n' chips ($7) and also a dozen oysters ($14). The fish and chips only comes with one small piece, which was a little disappointing but reasonable given the price point. I forgot to ask where the happy oysters were from, but they were small and briny. Not my favorite type of oysters, but hey oysters are oysters. I still enjoyed them.\n\nIt was pretty quiet in the lounge, which made it easier for my friend and I to chat as we slowly sipped and ate our way through everything.

Bf and I stopped by on a random Sunday night and managed to get a last minute reservation an hour prior. \n\nI will say the interior is very interesting - like an upscale version of a Little Mermaid-themed restaurant lol.\n\nOn to the food... everything was shockingly good. Maybe I had low expectations coming in, but I was taken aback at every dish. Oysters were fresh and creamy, a nice contrast to the tangy champagne mignonette. The abalone chowder was ADDICTING. Bonus points if you save some bread to eat with it. Lobster was very simple yet tender - falling off the shell. Sole was flavorful and cooked perfectly... flaky and juicy on top of these AWESOME cranberry beans. Plus, their Snickerdoodle pudding dessert is to die for.

Would forego the half lobster (tiny) next time at the price of $42.50, but to be honest, we got that one for the photo. \n\nOrdered a few cold and warm appetizers. Very non-traditional is how I can explain them. Escargot wasn't in shell but was accompanied by pasta. Bone marrow wasn't in bone but was fried to crisp. Loved the fried shallots (?) on top of the scallops.

It felt authentic and genuine and every detail was perfect. The oysters were delicious and they had a great variety. My favorite was the Olympia from Washington (small, huge flavor) and my mom's was the wellfleet from Cape Cod. We also shared the Dungeness Crab Louie, so good! \n\nAt dinner we had the best seat in the house, overlooking the whole restaurant. The octopus chandeliers, the mosaic tiles on the ceiling, down to the handrails that looked like octopus tentacles, it is a feast for the eyes!

Sadly, this is a hard pass for me.  Perhaps we came on an off night...I'm not quite sure.  \nWe arrived about 45 mins to one hour before our reservation to sit at the bar and enjoy some cocktails before dinner.  We checked in with the host to let them know we had arrived and sat down.  Our waiter came to take our drink orders and didn't return with our cocktails for about 15 mins.  This seemed to be a bit longer than one would have expected...the service at the restaurant, from bar to table, was definitely slower than we would have liked.  There was quite a bit of time between courses and as a result, our entire dinner took nearly 4 hrs! Not to mention, we arrived early for our reservation, yet our table was not ready for about 10 mins after our reservation time.\nOnto the food:\nWe ordered the cheese plate while we had our cocktails...we sampled all 5 cheeses and 3 of them had almost zero flavor.  The cheese choices were very underwhelming, which was disappointing considering we paid $25 for it.  This was also the case for the cocktails.  We ordered the blackberry cocktail which was supposed to be their specialty, and it tasted like watered down mezcal.  The blackberry color was there, but it had very little flavor.  We also ordered the Sidecar and that too had an off flavor...VERY tart and almost undrinkable.  We had hoped dinner would be a better experience.\nWhen we were finally seated at our dinner table, we ordered the Oyster flight to start(2 to be exact, since only 6 come in 1 flight at $21 a pop).  There were 3 different types of oysters...2 of which were terrible, literally tasted like dirt.  In addition, they were not shucked properly and had a ton of tiny shell pieces in them.\nWe also ordered the foie gras mousse as an app which was delicious, but was literally about a tablespoon size on the plate, if that, and it was $29!  \nNext, was dinner...two of us ordered the salmon dish, both of which were not fully cooked.  One of the pieces was actually completely raw and mine was not cooked on the side that was opposite the seared side.  We sent it back to ask for them to be cooked a bit more and the wait staff graciously did so.  When they came back, they were cooked perfectly.   I also felt that the flavor choices featured on the plates were a bit strange and didn't really mesh together.  With the salmon, they had red and golden beets with some sort of grain, perhaps barley?  I don't know...none of it seemed to make sense together and $49?  Completely overpriced.\nFor dessert, we had the lemon verbena creme brulee...now this was interesting.  It was flavorful and creamy, but the flavor was strange.  It didn't taste like natural flavors, it actually tasted like fruity children's cereal-think Fruity Pebbles or Trix.  It was a very artificial tasting flavor.  Not bad...just not what I expected. \nI didn't dislike this restaurant, but nothing was remarkable or something I would choose to come back to order, especially for the price.  For the amount we paid for a dinner for 4 people, we could have gone back to Gary Danko's and had an outstanding meal instead.  I say save your money and go somewhere else for a great seafood dinner.", "author": "Merri P."}

If you love seafood, this is not the right place to go because their fresh seafood quality is below average and all their cooked dishes are bland and lack originality. \n\nIn addition, the service was also really mediocre. Most of the time, we can't even find our waiter. When I asked the other waiter to bring us some water, he said:\"I don't serve your table, you have your own waiter.\" WTF??? Are you serious?\n\nThis is probably one of the worst restaurants I have been to in sf. It's not worth your money and time. There are so many other better places in sf.

The jellyfish chandeliers hang above, the ocean-themed murals surround you, and the sloping, deep-colored ceilings make you feel like you're in an aquarium! The \"booth\" we sat at was even reminiscent of a clamshell, making us feel like characters in the Little Mermaid as we dined.\n\nWe started with a chilled seafood platter \"fruits de mer,\" which came with creamy oysters with a champagne sauce, juicy claws of fresh lobster, grilled and chilled shrimp with cocktail sauce, juicy raw clams, and crab with a honey mustard aioli. Our server explained that the seafood here never sees the tank, and the lobsters are flown in live! Amazing!\n\nWe continued with the melon/lobster/burrata salad, which had an interesting contrast of sweet, tart, and creamy. The grilled local squid was filled with a rice-based stuffing and served over beans, and one of my favorite appetizers was the gnocchi and oyster--the gnocchi were pillowy and tender, and they made for an interesting pairing with the cooked oysters, the creamy sauce, the caviar, and the shreds of fried potato skin on top!\n\nFor our mains, we had the perfectly grilled scallops with chanterelles, served over a bean puree. We also had the local sablefish (cod), which came with beautifully crispy skin, fava beans, and sliced potatoes, but the entree I liked the best was the duck breast. It was cooked to medium rare, sliced, and served with bing cherries (what a seasonal ingredient!), tender turnips, hericot verts, and a delicious duck jus, which simply brought the entire dish together. Though some of the duck slices were a little bit tough, overall, the flavors of this dish just worked so well together!\n\nAnd then came dessert--we opted for the light strawberry-rhubarb pavlova, which came with a creamy center, macerated strawberries, and was topped little dollops of meringue. A great finish to the meal! We really got the full experience at Farallon. Overall, the food is a little bit on the pricey side and is not the absolute best seafood I've had in the Bay Area, but this is the place to come for great wines, friendly, knowledgeable service, and a beautiful atmosphere.", "author": "David K."}

I had the tuna main and the wife had the main lobster - both were cooked to perfection.  We did several half-bottles of wine per the recommendation of the sommelier, who I believe was one of the best I've encountered ever.  We shared parts of our mains just to get a good sample of the dishes, those plus the starters, plus the half-bottles were really fabulous.  The service was outstanding, from the host to the waitress to the sommelier to the management - I've fine dined before, so I was expecting the 'relaxed' pace of the courses - I can see where that type of pause would feel slow to others though.  This is not a get-in and get-out place, this is traditional fine dining at a much slower RPM than silicon valley spins at.....  We had follow-up reservations at Bar Crenn for Champagne and desserts so we passed on the after-dinner treats at Farallon.  BUT having self-medicated with waves of drinks, app., mains, wines, we were feeling the food coma approaching like an oncoming freight train... so we ordered espressos at Farallon and asked the waitress for the check.  The coffee was excellent, and she brought us complimentary chocolate / sea salt / caramel squares from the kitchen that I don't know were laced with what type of crack - but whatever that thing was BLEW ME AWAY.  I could eat a pallet of those things.... best \"chocolate\" square I've had in my life hands down.

They have a great oyster HH (6 for $7), but the sliders shouldn't be missed either!\n\nHow to Dine at a $$$$ Restaurant for $$, Featuring Farallon\n1. Go during HH, 4:30-6PM in the Jellyfish Lounge\n2. Order oysters - 6 oysters for $7!\n3. Order beef sliders - 2 sliders for $7\n4. Order more oysters\n\nAmongst all the overhyped restaurants of SF, Farallon is definitely one of the more underrated ones in my opinion. I'd never heard of it until I was looking for $1 oyster happy hours, and probably would have never visited otherwise as it's rather expensive for a normal meal.\n\nThe restaurant is very close to Union Square but easily missed since the front is rather unassuming. Walking inside though, you're immediately taken into an underwater world with beautiful jellyfish lamps hanging from the ceiling. The Jellyfish Lounge is where they have their HH specials; normal dining is in the back. Classy, upscale ambiance.\n\nMy friend and I got there around 5:30PM and snagged the last spot for 2 at a table by the door. Not a great spot for a large group. 2-3, maybe 4 people max, would work well here. Good spot for solo diners too. We ordered 3 orders of oysters (18 total), the ceviche and the sliders and thought that was just the right amount of food for us. The oysters were good, but not gonna lie, those sliders were better!\n\n* SIX FEATURED OYSTERS ($7) - 4/5\nFresh! More on the briny side than I would've liked, but I still enjoyed them.\n\n* MEZCAL CEVICHE ($7) - 3.5/5\n[w/ avocado mousse, spiced tostada]\nJust okay. Not sure what makes it mezcal.

Draw in unsuspecting patrons with the BEST happy hour in San Francisco, then entice them with incredible service and cuisine. My friend and I came here for happy hour because we couldn't resist the idea of sitting in the Jellyfish Lounge. When we arrived, however, we chose to sit at a small table by the window instead of at the bar areas under the jellyfish shaped chandeliers.\n\nWE ATE SO MUCH. It was supposed to be an innocent happy hour, but we seriously feasted, and I hardly had room for actual dinner when I went home to my boyfriend. We started off with two dozen oysters, chicharones, and some cocktails. The oysters were mid sized and sooo fresh and delicious! My favorite were the chicharones, which are made in house. They were a bit salty for my friend, but they added variety in flavor and texture throughout the rest of the items we ordered.\n\nFor round two, we got more oysters, in addition to the sliders and ceviche. This was all on the happy hour menu, somewhere between $5 and $7. And I got a refill on my margarita. The sliders were amazingly juicy and filling. For such good happy hour prices, I half expected the food to be subpar, but this was some high class stuff. I'd actually love to come here for a fancy dinner sometime. Or just another happy hour adventure.\n\nThe best part was our smiling and hospitable waitress. I think the staff here was blown away by how much my friend and I could eat. They checked in on us regularly and cleared our dishes in a timely manner. I'm already excited to come here again, either for happy hour or dinner. Tourist or local, come check out this upscale and welcoming Union Square restaurant!", "author": "Stefanie C."}

The seafood was very fresh.  \n\nI came here with a friend/coworker after a long traveling workday on a Friday night.  We had made reservations and arrived a bit early so we enjoyed happy hour drinks in the lounge area and started off with oysters ... there were selected varieties and each one was very fresh - oysters are a must try here! My friend isn't a big fan of oysters, and even she really enjoyed them. \n\nDrinks: \nThe Roxie: it had an interesting smokey flavor to the tequila...you could really taste the tequila, and I'm not a fan of tasting the alcohol in my drinks, but after a few sips I started to enjoy it more :) ... it went really well with the oysters.\n\nThe Parisian: (I think that's the name) and it was a delightfully refreshing fruity flavor. \n\nHemingway daiquiri: stronger and less fruity than expected \n\nChardonnay (Dento?): smooth and buttery \n\nFood: \nOysters - so many varieties and very fresh; definitely get some to try...some of them are a big saltier and brinier than others, but most of them have a sweet flavor to them (e.g. Tomales bay) \n\nFruit de mer: this entree is perfect for sharing; comes with two good sized lobster claws, 2 oysters, 2 prawns, 2 clams, and a lump of crabmeat\n\nCrudo of halibut: very light and refreshing with a hint of tartness and saltiness from the berries on top\n\nBaratta and lobster with melons: very light and a nice balance from the sweetness of the melons and the buttery richness of the lobster \n\nAmuse bouche: I don't remember what was in it but it was a very delectable bite of a bit of sweetness, crunch and creaminess to it ... I just know I licked the spoon! \n\nSablefish: light, airy, and buttery ... reminded me a bit like Chilean sea bass; there was a perfect amount of fava beans and fingerling potatoes - I like the fact that the potatoes were sliced to match the beans \n\nBone dry scallops: I did not taste this dish, but my friend said it was perfectly cooked - nicely seared on the outside and perfectly soft on the inside \n\nDessert: \nChocolate mousse something - was just ok to me; there was a nice crunch on the outside chocolate dome and the mousse on the inside was very airy \n\nCan't remember the name of the other dessert, but I did like it better then the chocolate mousse \n\nService: \nExcellent.  The staff were all very pleasant and friendly Our server was very friendly and patient with us...she reminded me of Anne Hathaway :) \nThey bring you bread (two pieces each) with salted butter and more upon request ... both are sooo good - just be careful not to fill up on just the bread because it's very easy to just keep eating that!", "author": "L C."}

From top to bottom, the restaurant is unapologetically decorated in \"under the sea\" meets old school SF. Shades of blues & greens, jellyfish-shaped chandeliers, a Neptune Palace-esque mosaic -- your senses are bombarded with this oceanic setting & it's fun, if not amusing, to behold. \n\nHowever, we were underwhelmed by the food. We started our pre-theater meal with the Grand Platter (chilled crab, lobster, oysters, & shrimp.) Even with the various condiments & plentiful portions, this platter paled in comparison to others we've had throughout the years. Everyone at our table ordered filet or ribeye (yup, I brought a bunch of meat lovers to a seafood restaurant!) I was the exception; I ordered a cod & lobster dish that made me wish I'd picked either another item or another restaurant, entirely. Farallon's been around for two decades, perhaps it's time they revamped their recipes & freshened up their menu, as everything on my plate was quite humdrum. \n\nI'd been hesitant to visit this restaurant for years.

We started in the Jellyfish Lounge, figuring we would just eat off the bar menu, and didn't have reservations.  Well, after we saw the place, we decided to eat in the restaurant, and were able to get reservations - luckily it was a Wednesday and we were willing to eat early - not sure that would have been possible other nights.\n\nThe Jellyfish Lounge - what a cool room.  The floor looks like the beach, there are jellyfish chandeliers.  One side of the room is an oyster bar with someone constantly shucking oysters.  And a bar on the other side.  The oysters on the bar menu were tiny local oysters and very good.  The waiter and bartender tried to replicate the drink I had at another bar.  (They didn't get close but what they made was very good.)\n\nDinner:  We were seated at 5:30.  Things started off with an amuse bouche of truffled goat cheese, slice of olive, and almonds along with some excellent bread.  The waiter explained some of the menu items to us.  I chose the Gnocchi and Oysters appetizer, and hubby had the Sablefish.  I hear that the fish was the best he'd ever had.  I know my plate was excellent - soft pillows of gnocchi with an excellent sauce, soft sauteed oysters, caviar, and deep fried potato skin curls for some texture.  Dessert was a blueberry panne cotta.  \n\nService was excellent.  Waiters were very knowledgeable about the menu.  The table behind us got an in depth explanation of every menu item.

One star is removed by our waiter, Jeremy C.  What the hell was wrong with him? Patronizing and condescending are the words to describe him.  Oh and ASCERBIC, like he didn't want to be there and had a terrible disdain for the guests.  Well, don't come to work then but honestly, even my guests noticed his attitude.\n\nMy guest wanted to know if they had \"sherbet\" - well, that's what it's called in some places and my client is also of another generation who knows the dessert by that name.  Jeremy, our reluctant waiter, snapped, \"no, we don't have sherbet but we have s-o-r-b-e-t\" and opened the dessert menu.  I felt so embarrassed as my client felt humiliated in public over a pronunciation as minor as that.\n\nThere were also other things he did but I am not going to bore you anymore.  The maitre d' was great when I interacted with him, his demeanor and service was what you would expect from an establishment like Farallon.\n\nI had the Little Gems Salad with goat cheese, pecans and pomegranates - very refreshing and well dressed.  Other guests had the same and one had the salad with the sardines and that was delicious as well.\n\nThe entire table pretty much voted for the scallops and it was clean plates all around.

It was as if he were not important enough for this waiter.  Sucked!!!\n\nThe bread guy brought around some bread, two different kinds.  Both were yummy.  The bread guy came around a 2nd time later and asked if we wanted more.  He was better than our actual waiter.  Two of us started with the red romaine salad.  The salad was a bit deconstructed when the mascarpone cheese smeared along the inside of the bowl and the lettuce leads laid out in a fan shape.  My friend though the portion was a bit small.  I liked it though and it seemed plenty big to me.  I loved the fresh nectarines in it.  My friend's mom had the Dungeness Crab & Melons appetizer.  She really liked it - good crab pieces in it.  We also did the chilled shrimp.  It was 5 big prawns with a very spicy cocktail sauce, almost two spicy.  \n\nFor entrees, my friend and I each had the sablefish.

However, even with a reservation, we were asked to wait as our table wasn't yet ready. A hostess walked us to our seats, and we met our server for the evening. Our server greeted us warmly, welcoming us to the establishment. He explained the menu and the special Valentine's Day tasting menu. He stated we could swap out items on the menu in favor of creating our own tasting menu, but when we asked to substitute a similar-priced appetizer for another, as the entire table must order the tasting menu and we wanted to increase variety, the chef denied us this option, stating the low stock of main course ingredients as the reason. This didn't make sense to us, but my dining partner and I went with the flow. \n\nThe dungeness crab and beets (on the regular menu, as well) was well-designed and executed, with succulent crab and crunchy beets to highlight this dish. \n\nThe sablefish had the skin in-tact, blackened and crispened such that it complemented the white, flaky fish well. \n\nThe clam chowder, however, lacked what makes clam chowder clam chowder: clam. and bacon. and oyster crackers. I had to ask for this to be delivered, as it was skipped, and when finally presented after the main course, it was explained the dish had to be hastily made, as they had run out of the original batch. My dining partner was looking forward to this dish, and was left sorely disappointed. I wish they had offered another soup in its stead. \n\nThe beef rib was tender and juicy, and made for the heaviest of tasting menu components. We didn't leave the restaurant hungry, but we did leave disappointed. The greatest disappointment was the dessert, with the delivery of a sour sorbet in an overtly-sweet sugar-based meringue casing. Props for presentation, but zero credit for quality. Given that Farallon is known for their service, I felt intimidated to even point this out. When I did, one of the servers told our server and he came back with the same plate of half-eaten sour sorbet and explained nicely that he was also providing me a new scoop of sweet sorbet. This is where I cannot recommend Farallon. This is not how a fine dining restaurant should have handled this. This is where the server or the host should have offered a replacement. Especially when taking my plate, one server noted, almost in solidarity with me, \"TOO MUCH SUGAR, I KNOW.\" \n\nOverall, I would recommend following Yelper Jessie L's instructions and come here solely for the oysters and sliders during HH. I cannot bring myself to recommend this restaurant for a full meal, having had a sub-par dining experience on a special occasion.", "author": "Jen B."}

Our server was lovely and trying really hard, but it just didn't seem like the back of the house (or bar) could figure it out. \n\nThere were two times during our dinner where we didn't have drinks we ordered (I didn't get to drink my final glass of wine because it arrived AFTER we were totally done with our dinner and my husband had finished his wine).\n\nWe got the picked crab to start - which was fine.  \n\nWe then got two scallop appetizers (they only come with one scallop so our server recommended we get two).  \nI LOVE scallops.  This was the strangest scallop dish I have ever tasted.  My scallop was cooked just fine but my husband's was rubbery (and not seared on top) but the strange thing was that there was a super sweet corn/popcorn/blueberry mush around it that did nothing to compliment the scallop (only overwhelmed it).  It did look pretty though.\n\nWe ordered the filet to share and this was fantastic, but we sat for at least 30 minutes waiting for it (and we ordered all of our food at once). \n\nThe restaurant didn't seem that full though?

My husband does not love seafood, and the couple dinners we had there when it opened just weren't special enough for me to overcome his lack of enthusiasm.  But, after this month's trip, Farallon is back on our fancy restaurant list.\n\nThe seafood choices and preparation were outstanding. He actually liked and told others about the halibut tartare, and I was in bliss with fresh shrimp cocktail starter and a main course of seafood & baratta accompanied by an order of crab chowder. That was plenty of food, and the birthday dessert ice cream sandwich didn't weigh me down too much.  \n\nEach dish had an uncommon and appealing taste. Preparation and presentation were top notch, too.\n\nWe especially appreciated the customized service we received. Many of the other diners were obviously tourists and had Things to Do. We didn't. Chase, our server, adjusted the pace of the courses and food delivery to the retarded slowness we requested. We were allowed to linger without being molested by helpful table clearers or intrusive questions if we wanted more of this or that.\n\nThe space is interesting without being weird. The acoustics mute most stray sounds and the tables are just far enough so you feel some privacy. \n\nThis 20-year old has improved with age.

Perhaps this place was in its prime 10-15 years ago, but I've now dined here on multiple occasions and it's simply disappointing.  The ambiance is great, service is good, but the food is below average.  On top of that, it's extremely expensive.  I am not sure how this place will survive in San Francisco with so many good restaurants here by serving expensive, mediocre food.  \n\nI had the amberjack, and it basically was raw and disgusting.  I also had the dorade, which was burnt to a black piece of charcoal on the outside and over-salted on the inside.  The amberjack was $36 and the dorade was $45.  Total rip-off on top of not being tasty. One of my dining companions had the filet for $49. It was okay, but certainly not better than an average piece of steak. For $49, it should be a really good to excellent piece of steak.  \n\nI have dined here a year ago, and I felt the same way.  The food is mediocre.  It's unfortunate because San Francisco does not have a great fine dining seafood place, and Farallon could potentially be that place.  However, I find Waterbar much better. In fact, the seafood I have had at Sutro's Cliff house (yes, Sutro's Cliff House by the ocean) is better than the seafood I have had a Farallon.  Farallon has so much potential, but it really falls short of being the \"star\" seafood place in San Francisco. Instead, it is simply mediocre or below, and I will not dine here again.", "author": "Gunnar F."}

He asked if we had any particular time constraints up front and after he found out that one of us had a tickets to the basketball game, he made sure to be right on top of getting us our appetizer an entree ASAP. We sat down at 5:30 and we were probably out on the street by 6:15. Not rushed, but definitely expedited. Gotta give him credit for making things happen quickly.\n\nHe described each item on the menu in excruciating detail which was nice. \n\nThe portions are somewhat small so you'll at least need an appetizer plus an entree or a 'small' plus an entree in order to leave feeling satisfied.

It was kinda the whole reason I wanted to eat here.  sigh.  Instead we were seated in a section close to it.  It's like going to a concert and paying the same ticket price as everyone else, but getting stuck in the nose-bleed section of the theater - so you're not quite getting the same experience, BUT still paying the same price as everyone else. \n\nI remember first hearing about Farallon as a child while reading the classic Farallon cookbook (yeah, even back then I was a food-obsessed kid). \n\nLike a lot of classic restaurants, Farallon feels a little dated.  The seafood-theme verges on being a little cheesy with the jellyfish chandelieres and seashell columns; however, the service is top notch.  The prices are definitely modern day prices.  We left here with a $300 bill for two people.  Definitely keep an eye on the entree prices. \n\nFor appetizers:\ngnocchi and oysters with spicy nduja sausage - found the spiciness of the sausage to be a little too strong in contrast to the delicate oysters\n\nCaucus Abalone -  served on garlic bread which I think was supposed to be eaten like a crostini.  Not sure that was the best way to serve the abalone. \n\nFor entrees - Sablefish from the Farallons- AMAZING!  This is definitely THE dish to get here. I don't really branch out when it comes to fish, but the sablefish was buttery and not fishy at all.  Great flavor. \n\nQuail & Sonoma Foie Gras - should have stuck to seafood.  This dish was just ok.  Didn't really feel the qual and foie gras meshed too well together.  Also one of the more expensive dishes. \n\nSides:\nSpaghetti Squash Carbonara - probably one of my favorite dishes.  It comes with a fried egg on top that you mix with the spaghetti squash and bacon.  So good! \n\nBottarga French Fries - great as an appetizer. Loved the bottarga aioli. \n\nBrussel sprouts - decent veggie side. nothing special. \n\nTry at least once and make sure you specify you want the main dining room and will wait for it!", "author": "Hieu H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-08-06", "description": "My husband and I planned a weekend getaway in San Francisco and really wanted to go out to a really nice place with excellent food.  We researched for a few weeks.  Originally we had reservation's at Gary Danko (should have kept them), but due to being short on time (went to a concert after) we cancelled and made reservation's at Farallon.  We were staying at the Kensington Hotel, which literally has a private door from the hotel to the restaurant.  I did a lot of research on Farallon before as I wanted to make sure we were going to have a great \"culinary experience.\"  \n\nWe arrived about 15 minutes early and sat at the bar.  The bar is fairly small, especially when they open up the bar area an hour prior to the dinning area.  You would think there would be more seating available.  The bartender's were very nice.  We ordered an oyster platter, caviar and champagne.  Oyster's were good, small but good.  We got caviar as well.  My husband has had it before but I have not.  It was good but but over powered by the potato chips they served it with.  I also thought it would have been nice if the bartender/waiter could have provided us with some knowledge about the caviar we ordered, especially them knowing it was my first time. \n\nThe champagne was delicious!! So I looked it up online as I wanted to go out and by some in the near future.  Well.... I was disappointed when I saw the price!  What I paid for each glass (two) is how much a whole bottle would be.  This unfortunately made me skeptical for the rest of the meal as it happened again.  \n\nOur reservation was at 5:30 at about 5:50 the hostess finally came up to us and seated us.  I we were then a bit disappointed as I saw other people drinks carried to their table for them and ours wasn't.  Call it snobby but we are paying the same as everyone else and would like the same experience as them.  Especially since I was having to carry my belongings and now my drink.  \n\nFor dinner we had a delicious mixed green salad with figs and goat cheese.  Delicious... probably best part of our dinner.  The bread, which I was warned about, was not good at all.  It was not fresh and it was actually cold.  As we were looking over the wine menu, a gentlemen walked over and began talking about their wine selection.  I told him we wanted to get a bottle of white wine preferably from Spain.  He was able to talk us into another bottle from Italy.  The way he described the wine seemed to pair well with out plates (plus it was within our price range of how much I wanted to spend on a bottle of wine).  NEXT PART REALLY DISAPPOINTED ME.  He came up shortly after we decided on a bottle and stated he was going to bring us a different wine and to not worry it was within our price range.  This was a first.  We didn't know what to say.  We were confused.  We weren't sure; if he ran out of that wine, assumed we wouldn't know any better or if he truly wanted us to get a good bottle of wine.  \n\nWell... I again researched the wine after he brought it to our table.  I paid $55 for a bottle, when I could have purchased it for $22 at Target.  As for the wine it smelled very fruity but the flavors did not match up.  I felt as if he took advantage and didn't want to spoil a good bottle on us.    \n\nFor our dinner plates.  I ordered scallops with risotto and my husband the sea bass.  I ALWAYS finish especially if it's a small portion like this was, but this plate I did not.  The scallops were under seasoned and the risotto tasted like canned corn and rice.  My husband's was over powered by what seemed to be canned beans that the sea bass sat on.  \n\nFor dessert we ordered the peaches and cream.  Nothing spectacular what so ever.  The vanilla chiffon tasted like they made it the day prior.  As we were paying our bill they brought out small pieces of chocolate with sea salt on top.  That was probably the the best tasting thing out of our entire experience there.  We were so disappointed that I actually had to write a review on this place.", "author": "M E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-29", "description": "As a surprise for my boyfriend's birthday, I brought him here. We Barted into the City, and once I lead him to the entrance of the restaurant, and announced, \"Here we are!\" he exclaimed, \"Woah! Hey, there's jellyfishes!!!\"\n\nFlashback to the prior evening, when another restaurant I had booked had to cancel my reservation due to the weather, forcing them to close the restaurant for safety and repairs on a short notice. Oh well, Farallon was another dressy restaurant I had been eyeing. I made a reservation through OpenTable, and also gave them a call to ask questions. I believe the gentleman I spoke to was named Alex. He was very nice! I told him it was my boyfriend's birthday, and I wanted to know what the seating was like in the restaurant. He asked me if we preferred to sit across from each other (table option) or next to each other (a booth option). I instantly chose the booth option. As for locations within the restaurant, there's an upstairs and a downstairs. I chose him to pick a booth in an area that would be the most romantic. I also asked if \"Happy Birthday\" would be written on his dessert, and he said yes, that it would be written upon the dessert of his choice.\n\nThe next day, it was Monday. As we Barted into San Francisco, we were running late for our 6:30 reservation. I called the restaurant, and asked them if it was possible to push our reservation to 7:00. It was no problem.\n\nOnce we got into the restaurant and claimed my reservation, the ladies at the front asked if we needed to check in any coats or belongings. That was nice of them to ask, but I said no, and instead asked where the bathroom was. It's right on the first floor, by the stairs, and before entering the dining area. It was a very clean, though kind of small bathroom with a few stalls, but it's well-lit. And emphasis on cleanliness; ladies, I'm sure we all know the feeling of going to a restaurant and going to the bathroom to switch out of our street shoes into our heels. \n\nThe entrance and the restaurant decor, by the way, is wonderful. Once you step in, you instantly notice the jellyfish chandeliers hanging above. They're beautiful and unique. We were lead to our booth in the main dining hall, which is dimly lit, and has tentacle chandeliers (my boyfriend thinks they're coral, I think they're tentacles). As a pleasant surprise, a happy birthday card in an envelope was sitting atop our table, waiting for us.\n\nWe were instantly served water upon request. For drinks, my boyfriend ordered the Rose of Cinsault, and I ordered the Sake (I was intrigued by the name Bride of the Fox). His Rose was very refreshing and not overly bubbly, like some Roses that I've tried. My Sake was sweet, but not too sweet.\n\nAfter ordering, we were each given a small plate of bread. There were two types of bread: one was a piece of a croissant, the other seemed to be walnut bread. The butter was sprinkled with Hawaiian salt. My boyfriend and I dislike butter on its own, but with the Hawaiian salt, the flavor was wonderful. I didn't know it was Hawaiian salt until I read another review.\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered oysters. We ordered two of each: Drake's Bay, Kumamoto, and Kusshi. I'm not an oyster connoisseur, so I can't comment on the subtle flavors and textures, but we both enjoyed them very much.\n\nFor entrees, he ordered Local Sablefish, and I ordered Reichardt Farm Duck Breast. We also shared our entrees. The sablefish was delicious, and the crunchy, crispy skin was the best part. The mashed potatoes (yukon gold potato puree) were creamy, the smoked mussels were delicious, and the lollipop kale was the best kale I've ever eaten. I think the sauce from the potatoes was what made the kale so delightful.\n\nThe duck breast was divine. I'm used to Peking duck, and the slices of duck were very tender and delightful. I guess the sauce was Cinderella pumpkin? \n\nFor dessert, he chose Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, and I chose the Pumpkin Spice Sundae. His dessert came with \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate, and a lit candle. We also shared our desserts, and enjoyed it all very much.\n\nWhen the bill came, it came out to $165.01. Not bad! Especially since other reviews said to expect to spend over $200 for a party of two. Food is definitely pricey, but that's to be expected for a high-end dressy restaurant.\n\nI'm impressed with how we were treated as well. My boyfriend and I were the youngest ones in the restaurant, but the waitstaff treated us with respect as they would with any other older diners. I've experienced service elsewhere that treated younger individuals more rudely, so I was impressed with the professionalism here. They refilled our water glasses, they checked in on us without being invasive, they brought out our food and drinks in a timely fashion, and were kind to take photos of us on our phones upon request.\n\nWe both want to come back, especially for the oyster happy hour!", "author": "Jo W."}

I picked this restaurant out of convenience as it was close to my hotel..BUT...to my surprise this is restaurant is actually pretty good!\n\nI think we were the only asians in the restaurant and probably the youngest too, not that it's a bad thing or good thing but just a general observation. Noticed that the average crowd were in their 50s and it seems most of them were celebrating something special that evening as most of them were couples.\n\nIt looks like a very themed restaurant as it should be since they specialize in Seafood and it's actually not cheesy at all, to a certain extent I think it's pretty cool.\n\nNow back to food..the food was good and exceeded my expectations for sure. It's not like they invented any super unique dish or flavor but they did everything properly and the results were great food and great flavor. I'll let the pictures do the talking.\n\nOh right, oysters are a must order and I suggest trying different ones. I ordered the platter with lobster and all but I think the next time I visit I'll just use the money and order 2-3dozens of oysters.", "author": "Jive O."}

When I asked for a table I was told I would need to wait an hour and twenty minutes as they were all filled up for the night. I was directed to eat at the loud bar. I sat down and booked a reservation online using OpenTable. I found a reservation open 15 mins later. The host didn't believe me and was very rude about the entire thing. I alerted the manager who could careless and likely rewards the man for his rude behavior. It was as if they wanted to create an exclusive feel to the place. \nThe food was nothing special either. I ordered the Dungeness crab (which was over priced and not worth it at all)  which was burned and overcooked. It tasted awful. My wife had a great meal and really enjoyed her food.

One valet guy and many hangry customers with their double-parked along Post St, just one block away from the busy Union Square, calls for a disaster. Already running late for a holiday dinner in December of last year, we saved ourselves the trouble and parked in the public parking lot below Union Square. But aside from that issue which initially ruined the night, my dining experience at Farallon was quite pleasant.\n\nThe holiday party was held in the Beluga Room, which was spacious enough for a party of ~70 people plus a DJ station. The undersea themed room was fitting for Farallon, with walls painted with all imaginable sea creatures and their famous jellyfish lamps immediately outside the room.\n\nPrivate functions held in Farallon's private dining rooms have a set menu. We had two options to choose from for first course, entree, and dessert. As Farallon's specialty is seafood, I stuck with the fish options. \n\nHawaiian kona kampachi with radish, arugula, and almonds (first course) -- The fish was delicious, light and fresh with a peppered crust, but the arugula was overpoweringly bitter and I wasn't too fond of radish flavor either. \n\nCast iron roasted sea bass with potato pur\u00e9e, pancetta, and pomegranate reduction (entree) -- The sea bass was very moist and well-seasoned, and the skin delicious and crunchy. The potato puree was very smooth and creamy, and the pomegranate reduction added a bit of sweet and tart notes to the dish. I was very pleased with this dish and highly recommend it.\n\nMarzipan galette with pear sorbet, almond brittle, and pomegranate (dessert) -- This was very light and enjoyable. The pear flavor was distinct and refreshing in the sorbet. The galette was flaky and the pear butter marzipan filling was good, yet not too overpowering with almond.\n\nOverall, the dinner service was good and well-timed in between the courses, and the open bar staff and waiters were friendly. The food was delicious, but overpriced. But you dine at Farallon for the undersea decor anyway. Just take into account the traffic time if driving here, especially on the weekend.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

BF chose the sablefish, and I went with the albacore tuna. Hollandaise was a bit of an odd pairing with the tuna since it was super heavy and rich. The sablefish on the other hand - perfection. \n\nDesserts were all at $11 and were neatly and artistically plated.

Though on a solo vacation, I had made a reservation for one and was seated in a lovely comfortable area where I could enjoy watching the activities throughout the dining room, and the open kitchen. Service was prompt and attentive without being 'hovering'. My cocktail order was taken almost immediately and I was presented with the evening's 'gift' from the chef, 2 small portions of truffled aioli garnished with crushed hazelnuts and pomegranite. Fresh warm bread and butter also arrived instantaneously. I chose the bone marrow with sea urchin and truffled steak tartare as my appetizer, beautifully presented and impeccably clean in flavor. For entree I chose the buttermik-poached Petrale sole, beautifully garnished with vegetables. Service was at the pace I chose, a luxury solo diners don't often discover. And while I was much too full for dessert, they were happy to package their chocolate mousse for me to take back to my hotel. In planning this vacation for several months, this was the meal I was really waiting for. And it surpassed all of my expectations.

For me, it just makes me hungry for some seafood, and if that's their goal, they've succeeded for the most part.\n\nThe Happy Hour offerings like most places are offered only at the Bar and Lounge area at the front of the restaurant.  Here's what I had:\n\n$6 Sliders w/ Fries for Happy Hour -- http://bit.ly/1LG7fmG\n\n$6 Half-dozen Oysters for Happy Hour  (2 orders) -- http://bit.ly/1J4sDmA\n\nBoth are really good deals if you're looking for a cheap dinner.  The best deal is the Sliders w/ Fries.  They're not the best sliders I've ever had, but they're pretty good regardless and the fact that they come with Fries is always a plus.  The Oysters were pretty much decent for $1 oysters.  Still a good deal though, and why wouldn't you want to have oysters with the underwater decor??

Don't get me wrong, our server was amazing. She was really helpful and made it a great experience. The food was okay, it could've honestly been better. But what made our great night a bad one, was when one of the servers at the end of the night came up to our party and said \"I just wanted to ask you...was the service bad, because the tip was very small?\" Woooow...I mean....WOOOOOW, did he seriously just come up to my best friend and ask that? First of all, we split the bill 3 ways, so he probably got it mixed up and didn't see the rest of the tip. Second of all, we tipped over what was necessary. So for him to say that was totally uncalled for, even if customers weren't to tip well. I used to be a server at a restaurant myself and that isn't something you ask customers. That was totally RUDE! How dare he?! He was an Asian guy with blonde streaks in his hair. Just so everyone knows how rude he was. Okay, so my bff and I tried to let it go and not make a big deal out of it, but it really bothered us even the following day so I decided to call the manager to let him know how rude the employee was, and get this, he didn't seem to care much either. He was very careless in his tone and said he'd buy a drink for me because he would like to welcome us back. A drink?? Thanks but no thanks Brian.

In some oysters, the taste were way too strong, even lot of lemon and sauce couldn't cover it.\n\nBaby Beets & Dungeness crab salad next, the dressing was interesting and taste was good but not great.  Main course was Sablefish.  I liked the taste of the fish and it's hot but the broth on the dish was a little bit cold.  The serving potion might be a little bit small for a big guy like me.  It's about 4 or 5 oz, I guess it's standard for a fancy restaurant.  Too bad the broth was so tasty but lukewarm was not that great.  Also it's priced at $38.  \n\nBest part of the dinner was desert.  I ordered Bergamot Angel Food cake.  Loved the earl grey ice cream with the cake.  I would say that's the star of this meal.", "author": "Eric L."}

When I said we have a reservation at 7:15, he seemed surprised and said oh well never-mind and quickly left.   I asked several times for the head host to ask the waiter to tell him what he met by that because I was still kind of upset, he never did.  At the end of the night I asked for the manager and told him the story and he assured me that I was mistaken and that he never used the word respectable, and that the waiter was just  trying to \"make lighthearted conversation with me'.  I let it go but the next day I was still upset by now with the manager just dismissing my concerns. After a heated conversation with him by both sides, my bad, he agreed to check it out and get back with me the next day. Nicely enough he did, and he said, \" I talked to the waiter and he now remembers that he did use the term RESPECTABLE in reference to my having a virgin Mojuito.\"  So just to  put it out there so I can let go of it,   THAT JUST IS NOT TRUE.

With that being said, the lobster was good. The sauces served with the lobster were just ok. Avocado mousse was more like a pudding than a whipped avocado. And the drawn butter was cold. It's my understanding that lobster is to be served with warm drawn butter. \n\nThe Louisiana Prawn appetizer was nothing special. A total of 4, one inch long prawns served abed ordinary cocktail sauce. For a \"high class\" restaurant such as Farallon I was expecting huge prawns and scrumptious sauce. The \"prawns\" we ate could have easily been categorized as shrimp. And the sauce seemed semi-store bought, semi-homemade. Disappointing. \n\nI had the cod entree with mussels, bacon and fresh cracked crab. Sounds good, right? Not. My cod was cold. The plate, fish and sauce were all cold. I didn't want to send it back since my friend received her entree and I didn't want her to wait for me. Looking back on the experience I should have sent it back. It had the potential to be terrific. I wish the server had noticed the plate was cold and therein, the food as well. \n\nWe had a reservation for dinner at 5pm. We arrived a few minutes early and waited 15 minutes before being seated. We weren't given a booth even though the restaurant was empty. Our server seemed like a nice enough guy but was a bit pushy about purchasing an expensive bottle of champagne. And the first question he asked me was if I was a tourist or resident of San Francisco. It made me feel like he was trying to assess how much tip he was going to receive before we even got some water. Farallon is known for spectacular service but from start to finish it all kinda fell short. \n\nNothing stellar.

Not great, just good. The gnocchi with poached oysters appetizer was my favorite part of the meal. The abalone chowder appetizer was also tasty. My BF liked his sablefish main course. I had the ribeye, which was unremarkable, and served with fries, which drives me nuts, especially at fine dining establishments. I find it lazy, cheap, and uncreative. I know, first world problems. But really, nothing blew me away at all. \nAs a side note - and this is not really the restaurant's fault, but it was very annoying and distracting nonetheless - there was a family at a table next to us that made a HUGE production out of their teenaged son supposedly consuming some ingredient in his meal that he was \"allergic\" to. This family commanded a great deal of the staff's time and attention over this matter, while the kid continued playing on his iPhone obliviously the whole time. I think it's safe to say he'll live to see another day. To this family, and you know who you are: Please get over yourselves. Anyways, back to the dinner review. I'm sorry to say that the service at Farallon needs a good deal of improvement. At the price point to dine here, service should be a symphony, and it was far from it, which was disappointing. The service was not warm nor very attentive. For example, our server repeatedly brought us the check prematurely, when we intended to order more. We were not checked in on during the meal, and the server did not thank us or say goodbye/good night prior to us leaving. He just disappeared. I will say that there were two staff members that were very nice - the gentleman serving bread and water, and the young man downstairs in the jellyfish lounge who took our drink & oyster orders while we waited for our dinner table.

The hosts were nice and I was glad that they moved us to another table.  The original table was right in front of the doors where the servers come out.  This was my parents first time in SF over 20years so I wanted to treat them to some really good seafood.  They moved us to a nice private corner table in the main dining area which was great.  We ordered the soft Shell crab appetizer which was good but a little salty.  We also order the cold oyster, shrimp cocktail, crab and lobster combo and that was delicious.  The main dishes were the scallop plate which was a but in the fishy side and overly salty but had a good crisp sear on it.  The steak was NOT good.  I thought we were getting a nice juicy ribeye but it was pounded kind of flat and it wasn't juicy despite it being asked it to be cooked \"Medium well\".  And it was served with a pile of fries.  Was not impressed considering they charged $39 for the steak.  I had to ask multiple time for a refill of hot water.  At the end, I thought it was tacky that the server reached over my table setting to grab the check bill (after I paid and did the tip) before we left the table.  If it was really a nice restaurant, the servers don't take the bill until after you leave.  That was tacky.  Also be aware that they charge 5% city tax on top of the regular tax BEFORE they calculate the whole amount for the sales tax.  Which means you're paying 13% tax total at the end.   I felt disappointed and ripped off in the but I tried not to show it since my parents aren't so picky with fine dining and didn't expect much.  I'm used to fine dining and nice restaurants so I was quite disappointed.  I would only recommend ordering the lobster and the oysters here.  That's it!

Our least favorite were the clams and oysters which were a little on the briney side. \n\nWe washed it all down with a small bottle of 2012 Joh Jos Prum Wehlener Sonnenuhr Riesling Spatlese, which tasted amazing with all the seafood! I liked it because it was slightly sweet, light, and just delicious! If you're generally a Riesling fan, you'll like this one for sure. \n\nGreat service and overall a wonderful place for a romantic date and fresh high quality seafood! It's on the pricey end but you get what you pay for! Supposedly they have a great Happy Hour as well! :)", "author": "Diana I."}

We had made a reservation for 2, but it turned out we made it for the wrong date, but thankfully, they had a table for us nonetheless :)\n\nThere are many hits and misses here. You have to know exactly what to order, or it would easily be a disappointing experience. \n\n1/2 oz American Paddlefish Caviar with traditional accompaniments - Yummy! Recommended!\n\nOysters on half shell on ice - The oysters were mostly fresh and yummy. Our favorite was the kusshi oyster from washington.\n\nSterling beef tartare - They originally served us the tuna tartare, but quickly corrected the mistake. Wish we had stuck with the tuna tartare instead since the beef tartare was extremely disappointing. The beef was slightly hard, the creme fraiche drowned out the fragrance of the black truffle. Everything tasted bland. Give this a PASS :(\n\nSeared Georges Bank diver scallop - YUM. Scallop was seared beautifully and cooked to perfection. This is the first time  I had beef tongue together with scallops and it was a great pairing. Loved this dish!\n\nMediterranean shellfish bisque - Yummy!! Strong cognac and shellfish taste. Love it!\n\nSeared rare hawaiian ono - BOO :( This dish was a little on the bland side. The side of \"sauteed\" spinach tasted raw, unseasoned, and was generally unappetizing. Overall presentation was also lacklustre. Definitely rated bottom of the list.\n\nPan roasted Alaskan halibut - Yummy. Love the corn soup base, went very well with the perfectly cooked halibut. Definitely recommended.\n\nMy dining experience was probably 3 stars due to the many hits and misses. But +1 for the wonderful service and for seating us even though we made a mistake with our reservation!", "author": "Christina N."}

We found out from one of the staff the room is the top of the pool decor, and the pool is right below!\n\nReservation is a must, because even on a Tuesday night, the place was packed.\n\nWe opted for drinks first and the smaller shellfish platter. The lobster was amazing! I'm not a huge lobster fan, but this tasted like butter. \n\nWe only chose two courses each, only because the second course options didn't really stand out much. \n\nI ended up with the spinach salad and the Hawaiian Ono, while man friend ordered the citrus halibut and the trout.\n\nBoth starters were great. The salad had a sweeter dressing, but still solid. The Ono was done well, and tender. \n\nThey do have a very extensive wine list by glass and small or large bottle. \n\nMy only two complaints are:\n1. The turn around time for each course was particularly long. We waited for a while for our second course. Thank god for bread and butter!\n2. The staff knew it was a special night for us, so end of the night, I expected some kind of small token of dessert, but, nothing. I didn't order dessert either because I didn't find anything that was a wow factor on the menu.\n\nOverall, its nice to see an open kitchen and the staff hard at work, and the staff was pleasant to talk too.

We were celebrating, not only the fact that we didn't get seasick, as many on our boat did, but also our 28th wedding anniversary.\n\nWe walked in a bit early for dinner but just in time for Happy Hour in the Jelly Fish Lounge. We were lucky to get the last empty stools at the bar which gave us an action view of the Jelly Bar where seafood is prepared and oysters were being shucked, as well as other eager guests streaming in the door and awaiting a table.\n\nThe happy hour menu was ample and reasonably priced at $6 a selection. The oysters were some of the freshest, tastiest ever! We ordered a dozen and even considered a second dozen but got side tracked by the lively and engaging conversation with bar neighbors. We also enjoyed the Wild Mushroom Strudel (very small but tasty serving) and the Charcuterie. Even the bread and butter was unusually good.\n\nThe best part was our hostess for the evening, Renee, was a delight and she really made the evening special. She was knowledgeable, personable, charming and a very efficient bartender. We had been there at least an hour enjoying the bubbly and small bites when she overheard us mention in conversation that it was our anniversary and quipped \"You're just telling us that now?\" with a smile. Of course our dessert was served with fanfare and chocolate font. Renee is a gem; it's the first time we met but felt like old friends by the time we left. Can't attest to the service elsewhere but at the bar, service is excellent!\n\nI highly recommend the Happy Hour but check the hours before you go.

The host and hostess greeted us warmly and with smiles. Our waiter was incredibly attentive, polite, and brought everything out with perfect timing. Our glasses never got empty and empty plates never lingered. There was even a birthday card waiting for my boyfriend at the table, which was a very thoughtful gesture. \n- Oysters were fresh and we loved the champagne sauce\n- The amuse bouche (a ricotta and seaweed combo) was the most interesting and surprising mix of flavors. We really enjoyed it.\n- Halibut appetizer with the three garlic oil was amazing. The best halibut that we've had in a long time!\n-Pea ravioli with scallops were cooked perfectly, and made me fall in love with peas.\n- My boyfriend ordered the duck and he loved everything on the plate.\n- Our desserts were lovely. I got the almond, pear, strawberry sorbet trio (substituted out the chocolate) and my boyfriend got the eclair. It had 'Happy Birthday' written on the plate which he appreciated. He said it was the best eclair he's ever had.\n\nThe good: \n- We didn't know what to feel about the decor. It definitely felt dated, but we kind of liked how unapologetically over the top it was. \n- The smelt appetizer was tasty but didn't excite us.\n\nThe bad:\n- My Lassen trout entree was outright bad. There was a pool of watery liquid that everything was sitting in, and I couldn't tell if it was intentional or not. It washed out the flavors, and made the skin soggy and unappetizing. The carrots were the best thing on the plate.\n\nOverall, we had a great experience and were really surprised at the complex flavor combinations. Nearly everything felt innovative and was delicious. One of our pet peeves is when it feels like a place is trying to be innovative for the sake of being innovative, but at the expense of actual taste. It didn't feel like that here. \n\nI think the decor is actually detracting from the menu. Since it looks and feels so old school, it automatically made us expect the menu to be old school and taste dated. That wasn't the case, but it set our expectations in a different direction. \n\nAside from the trout (which may have been a fluke) everything else we had was fantastic. If I had ordered something different, I probably would be giving this review 5 stars.", "author": "Jenny I."}

The interior decor is pretty and I liked the vibes inside -- but I felt like I was paying for a \"bougie vibe\" and not so much because the food was good. I personally really dislike restaurants that serve mediocre tasting food and charge you for a nice inside vibe. I feel like for the same price range there are a few other restaurants I would rather go to that I've been to in SF.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-10-02", "description": "I chose this restaurant because it was right by the theater so it was ideally located-- I guess there is a reason why Farallon is still standing after all these years-- their food is very good-- they don't screw it up- and... well... it doesn't offend anyone. The atmosphere is very cool, I got a kick out of the retro 80's jelly fish hanging from the ceiling. It was probably super avante garde back in the day, now its a bit dated but cool dated-- like whats old is new again sort of. \n\nI would not say it was the most memorable dinner (food wise) but I also can't say a single bad thing about it. Its the kind of place you can bring your boss, your grandparents and your client. Its old school enough to be retro cool but has typical classic upscale continental food that never goes out of style. The pre theater meal is a pretty good deal, although the salad could have been more interesting- it was mostly salad leaves (there may have been a sliver of beet and a bit of walnut in there). It was the kind of salad I used to make when I did wedding catering and they would put me, the least experienced culinary assistant- on salad prep-- because it was so easy. Easy can sometimes mean fabulous, but in this case it was just what one would expect from a pre theater salad-- inexpensive, quick and easy to make- not super flavorful. \n\nThe bread was not GREAT, it was warmed but a tad bit on the hard side. There was also rye bread which I don't like but at least it was softer. The butter with red sea salt on top was nice in a continental way. My ahi tuna entree was tasty, but again-- not super exciting. The tuna was not UN fresh-- but it tasted like it had been frozen. The fries were crispy and upon request, they brought me some (low brow!) Heinz ketchup. \n\nSorbet dessert was pleasant-- The chocolate scoop was quite decadent- not memorable but not offensive either. So I guess I can't complain but I can't necessarily rave about it. I DID like the atmosphere- it WAS filled with grandparental types (older, rich theater going crowd) it is not a young, cool, underground hipster scene but again- its the whole retro continental making a comeback. I almost expected aspic jelly molded desserts! \n\nWould I go back again-- yes I probably would, especially if I was heading out to the theater which is right next door. I think they could maybe jazz up the menu a bit, try out a few interesting new flavors like black garlic or Harissa or anything exciting and new- they could combine old and new perhaps-- like familiar fish with a flavorful twist. \n\nThe pre theater dinner is a decent deal- it really is- and if you don't drink (as I don't) its an even better deal. If you DO drink, their cheapest glass of white was like $14- so thats not a good deal.", "author": "Rachel Z."}

It's quirky alright! \n\nService: prompt... the servers didn't like to smile... or maybe they were just having an off night but for the most part, no one gave us a genuine smile, it was one of those \"fake\" smiles.\n\nFood: oooh la la! \n\n- 1/4 OUNCE OF AMERICAN PADDLEFISH CAVIAR = perfect size, perfectly made, left my mouth wanting for more!!!\n\n- LEMON SCENTED JUMBO ASPARAGUS slow cooked egg, sausalito springs watercress, brioche croutons  = DELICIOUS!!! The whole dish was just perfectly made, perfect taste! The size was just right and everything literally just melted in my mouth. Wow. Definitely, highly, recommend this dish!\n\n- SEARED MEDITERRANEAN BRANZINO butter braised king trumpet mushrooms, sweet snap peas, wild mushroom consume = ordered this b/c I never had a \"branzino\" before... and now I have.

Long white plate with 3 jaggedly sliced dollops of tuna. Nothing special $19.5\n\n3) Little Gems Lettuces - 4 Whole lettuce leaves piled on top of each other, lightly dressed. $14\n\n4) Roasted Heirloom Beet Salad -lavender ricotta, petite arugula, pumpkin seed emulsion - I am not sure about those other ingredients but I am sure someone sliced exactly one beet with a razor and served it to me. $15\n\nI don't want to speak for my friends but the Trio of Shellfish included what appeared to be popcorn shrimp, lobster tail that was so tough it had to be forcibly released from it's shell, and approximately the amount of crab one might spike a deviled egg with. The grilled Tombo tuna was not terrible but also completely unremarkable.\n\nI am ok with small portions and higher prices when there is care, creativity, and excellence in the food.

The crab chowder had good flavor, but about 1 bite of crab meat. The scallops had good flavor with butternut squash puree and balsamic reduction, some of the brusselsprout leaves were raw (intentionally) and just too tough to eat. One of us had the petrale sole and was very disappointed, she didn't even want to eat it. The presentation was awful and it lacked flavor all together.

I have neither.\n\n*Furiously starts sugarbaby4u.com profile*\n\nI. Am. Just. Kidding.\n\nThankfully Farallon has one of the best Happy Hour deals with a \"Six Until Seven\" menu available every day from 4:30pm -7pm that will allow you to experience the enchanting atmosphere and get a taste of the delectable seafood offerings without Mr. Amex giving you the one finger salute at the end of the month. \n\nFor 90 minutes, Mr. NSS and I sat at one of the three tables in the Jellyfish Lounge (bar and seafood bar seating also available) and took advantage of the $6 HH specials. Do note that the crowd is mainly comprised of tourists and older elites as to be expected in Union Square. No eyecandy, go figure.\n\nWe started HH indulging into the BEST $1 Little Skookum Oysters (http://bit.ly/11RPig2) I've ever had. They were so deliciously creamy and sweet that my mouth begged for another dozen but we were ballin' on a budget here so I reluctantly resisted. Like a fresh gulp of the ocean, the Steamed Little Neck Clams (http://bit.ly/UjbpEx) were amazingly plump and sweet. The buttered grilled levain bread was perfect for sopping up the savory white wine broth with smoky bits of chorizo. I can never say no to truffle anything so we also ordered the Truffled Kennebec Fries (http://bit.ly/ReuMEe) which could have been crisper throughout but the heavenly earthy aroma was intoxicating and the taste addicting. If seafood is not your thing, there's also Beef Sliders, Potato Croquettes, and House Made Charcuterie on the $6 HH menu.\n\nNone of the 4 cocktails or 4 wines on the $6 HH menu tickled my fancy so I ordered The Aviation (http://bit.ly/UKeIZX). At a pricey $13.50, the gin based citrusy cocktail with maraschino liquor was small but packed a great punch. After just one, I forgot about our ballin' on a budget and ordered another. Bad idea.\n\n$93 later (for two) no longer were we \"ballin' on a budget\"... we (I) were just B-R-O-K-E.\n\nOh well, I guess I'll have to do some re-gifting for my Secret Santa gift (Kinda NSFW): http://www.shopinprivate.com/kitty-carpet-merkin-blonde.html.\n\nI hope they and their partner like a black kitty. *Fingers crossed*", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

You lure me into your fancy seafood joints for your lower than should be happy hour prices in your overly touristy districts.    And sometimes, sometimes, you don't tease.  Farallon, you delivered.\n\nCame in here for Happy Hour.  $1 oysters and other cheap fare to be had.  Now, again, in this area a $1 oyster is nice, but not uncommon.  Unlike it's peers, Farallon shucks your oyster to order.  Yes, that equally fancy place by the Embarcadero pre-opens the oysters and sits them in the cooler for a bit till you order them.  Not here.  Crack and open when you order.  \n\nNow, you should note, you might not get this if you go now, but go now just in case.  Their happy hour oysters when I was there were from Drake's Bay.  Those never go on deep discount.  But, they are having some community issues and need to clear out their stock.  The winner is you, here. If you catch the wave.\n\nIf you don't, ask about the oyster list.  They had Olympia oysters too (not on special).  Olympias are hard to find and are also one of the only native west coast oysters you'll ever encounter...or did you think Kusshi and Kumamoto were old Chinook or Miwok names?  There's a restoration effort in Seattle and in San Francisco to bring back the locals (so to speak) after they were over eaten 15 decades ago. \n\nAside from that, the sous chef who was passing by suggested a few things...all of them amazing: line caught ahi, domestic shrimp, delicious & perfect fries, and yummy pastries.

This is my 2nd poor dining experience recently at a prior \"favorite\" restaurant and I don't like the trend.\n\nMy GF and I were seated in an odd alcove in the main dining area surrounded by large tables.  This was fine until those tables were filled, after which the noise in the dining room became almost deafening when combined w/the noise coming from the kitchen.  My GF and I were able to carry on a conversation w/o shouting but the noise coming from throughout the room was distracting and not conducive to an intimate setting.  I prefer to be seated in the balcony over lobby, which is much quieter, but it was not open this evening.\n\nThe other problem w/the table we got was that our waiter also had to serve several other large tables near us - I counted 2 tables of 8 each - which understandably distracted him from taking care of us.  We were not ignored but because our waiter was almost always busy elsewhere we were served by a variety of other servers that reminded me of a wrestling tag team. Our water and champagne glasses were constantly filled but it was amusing to see who would be doing the job next.\n\nAs for the food it was a huge disappointment, which was a first for me.  My GF wasn't hungry and only ordered a kampachi sushi and a lobster salad.  Those dishes were ok but the portions were so small that it wasn't even filling for her.  The portions were so small that I would have thought that I was eating at the old Michael Minna at the St Francis but for the noise and the less than elegant plating of the food.\n\nI ordered the scallops for an appetizer and the snapper filet for the entree.  The scallops looked good but they were WAY to salty.  Didn't want to make a fuss and ate them anyway.  The snapper was also WAY too salty and also had a vinegar dressing in the dish which was as startling as it was unappetizing.  The dish also had a mound of finely chopped mushrooms on it which I had to dissect in order to figure out what it was.  My GF liked it but I found it tasteless and incompatible w/the fish.  For desert we shared some sorbet which was ok. \n\nThe final amusement of the evening came when we were about done and our original server mysteriously appeared and then tried to fill our glasses w/some wine belonging to an adjoining table. We were having champagne and the champagne glasses were still on the table but he still tried to pour a regular white wine in them anyway.. He should have known the difference on sight.  Stopped him in time.\n\nNot sure what to make of this experience.  Maybe it was just a bad night but at the price of $250 for a modest dinner for 2, I'm not inclined to give them a 2nd chance.  $200 dinners like $200 theater tickets unfortunately are the norm now but my expectations for dining and entertainment at these prices are now also much higher and, at least based on this experience, Farallon unfortunately longer meets mine.", "author": "Martin C."}

Arriving in the lounge and oyster bar area, you're treated to the floating jellyfish lighting and quirky artwork (a hard-hat diver sketching a duck--ridiculous but I love it).  Custom cocktails do nothing but enhance the dreamlike atmosphere.  For dinner, be sure to sit in the back room, which feels like a whole other world; it was previously a spectacular interior pool room for the Elk's Club.  The floor is now elevated over what used to be the pool, so the stunning ceilings can be enjoyed up close.  The food gets a solid B rating, well-prepared but not world-changing.

Decor was stunning and the lighting and ambiance excellent. Service was mediocre and that is being generous. The waiter, Paul, tried to upsell on everything. How about a glass of Champagne to start the evening? No Paul she wants a glass of Chardonnay. As he attempted to leave the table I said are you taking our drink order because we didn't tell you the wine we want? he says....that's no on the champagne? We thought huh? Does he have a hearing problem and is this comped because we told the restaurant  this is my wife's bday? Finally we relented only  to learn that it cost an extra $43, He still left without taking my drink order, and upon ordering he asked us if we wanted crab on our entree. We said no. Are you sure he asked? So that's no? Do I really have to repeat myself constantly with this guy? I said no. My wife received crab on her entree and we thought, screw it, let's just get through this. The bill showed another $25 for crab bringing her entree to $62. The back waiter brought the food and stumbled through a description of the entree before Paul interrupted him. Ugh, is this the B team tonight because it is Sunday? We passed on dessert even though this was my wife's bday. To their credit there was a card on the table when we arrived announcing her bday.

We had reservations but still had to wait for a lil, no big deal. Got seated, our server was David. Started with cocktails; I got the bone marrow and my Bf got oysters as apps--both were decent. Then my Bf ordered the filet mignon and I got the half moon bay fish for our entrees and the sole pie for dessert. Our appetizers came, we finished them as another couple right across from us got their entrees. As time passes by we noticed the other couple already finished their entrees and our's were nowhere in sight... I said to my Bf I'm gonna wait another 10 mins and if no one comes by and it's not almost ready I'm gonna ask to cancel as we have been waiting for a while and it's already getting so late. And yes 12 mins passes by my Bf got our severs attention and we noticed he was standing there talking to another employee, so the other gentleman who happened to be the assistant manager came by our table. My boyfriend said to him \"it's been a while do you know the status of our entrees?\" Scott the assistant manager rudely responded in very confrontational and CONDESCENDING manner \"um how long is a while?\" Then my Bf said \"it's been a while\" he then interrupted and said \"well what does a while mean\". He didn't even apologize but just started questioning us instead. I was perplexed by his demeanor and response. So I said, \"it's been longer than 30 mins since we've finished our appetizers at least and I've been looking at my phone non-stop awaiting for an acknowledgement or update.\" Then he put his hand up and said hold on let me check then walked away.  When he came back and said they're finishing up and it's coming out shortly. I was very disturbed so I told him I did not appreciate the way he responded to us and that it was extremely rude, condescending and disrespectful. \n\nWe go out to eat a lot and travel very often. We are pretty easy going and not the type to complain; however, this is extremely unacceptable. I have never been to any restaurant that would talk and respond to customers the way the assistant manager Scott at Farralon did. I did bring this to our server David's attention and he did apologize for it. I also want to mention the fact that when we told Scott about the delay of our food he never once apologized. I get it we all have bad days but responding to us the way he did was beyond disrespectful. \nOverall the food was great, but unfortunately I am distraught with the experience and that has ruined it. We talked about it for the rest of our time there and the next day and I'm still upset, disturbed and offended by it. \nWe're in sf all time and are frequent guests with The Grand Hyatt and was really hoping that Farralon would be a reg place for us, but unfortunately our experience at Farralon has left the worst bitter taste my mouth.

The service was also top notch. We went to Pinot Days at the Metreon and walked to Farallon afterwards with a group of 8 people on our reservation. \n\nThe service was solid again but something seemed to be different this time. The dishes seemed a lot smaller overall and the food, although good and made well, didn't live up to the super high price. I know this is in a tourist area so maybe that is it but it seemed like a VERY expensive meal for what we got. If I'm paying 50 dollars for a steak, I would like a slice with a certain proportion. \n\nI always try and not ding a restaurant simply because a waiter was slow or if a dish was not as hot as I would like it. I understand it's tough to be 100% all the time BUT, I will speak up if a policy set by the owners affects my experience. \n\nOne other thing that bugged us is that we had 5 bottles of wine for the large group and when we sat down we were told we could only bring in two of our own bottles. Even if we paid corkage on them, they would only allow us two bottles thereby forcing us to buy their marked up wine. \n\nNot a great experience and i likely won't be back as there are so many options these days.", "author": "Donovan M."}

This place is located in Union Square. We dined here before going to see a play.\nMost of the drinks and plates were $7 for Happy Hour. Happy hour was a little crowded though and it was hard to get a table. Luckily we had reservations for dinner and were seated at the bar to enjoy discounted HH. We enjoyed some champagne , seafood bisque, and raw oysters on the happy hour menu. The service at the bar was much quicker than trying to wait for a server during happy hour to get to you. The bisque was well prepared and smooth in texture with a nice rich flavor profile. The oysters were a little small but delicious. I tried a few different types including the Drakes(on HH $1 AN OYSTER), Blue point $3.75 each, and Kusshi $3.75/each. \nWe arrived a little early to our reservation so they seated us at 5:30pm. Our waiter David was very friendly and offered up suggestions for what to order. We tried the 1/2 chilled Maine lobster which comes with Lemon Aioli, Avocado Mousse and Salsa. All three of the sauces paired nicely with the lobster but the Avocado Mousse was by far my favorite.It was creamy and smooth with a little spice. The lobster comes de-shelled from the tail and the claws are cracked so not much work for delicious meat which I appreciated. The cost was $24. \nFor our main entrees we tried the Ono with fennel and Shallots and the Arctic char on top of smoked bacon, cauliflower puree and brussel sprouts. The Arctic Char was perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked. I did ask for it to be more medium than medium rare though. All fish is cooked medium rare here unless otherwise specified. We also tried the lemon hair pasta which was a special. It was nothing special but the flavor profiles were nice. \nFor dessert I had the Eclair- presentation was beautiful with the choc curls . The dessert was nothing special although it was good and had the right components to make a well thought out dessert. \nFor two people with drinks we spent about $196 for 2 glasses of champagne, seafood bisque,oysters, lobster app, 2 fish entrees, side of pasta dessert and a bottle of sparkling water. \nThe presentation on all of our dishes was on par with the prices and quality of seafood we received.

We've always had reservations here so I can't comment on walk in wait time. The restaurant has been around for decades, and you can tell by the interior design of the restaurant, definitely old school.  I can't really remember what I've ordered, but looking at their menu I probably ordered the Grilled Sterling Filet of Beef which is an 8 oz steak with marble potatoes, broccoli rabe, and black garlic maggi butter for $49.  We would usually order a bottle of wine for my suppliers so the bill is usually a lot. I don't usually order dessert so all I can comment on is the food which was pretty good from what I remember.  The service was also excellent and I don't recall any problems.  The price however is a bit excessive, but from what I've heard, they have one of the best value Happy Hours with scrumptious oysters.  Maybe if I am ever in the city during Happy Hour then I might check it out.", "author": "Dean S."}

It was nice that it include tableside service with every course, however, it primarily consisted of dividing and serving the dish from the single plate it was served on.

In a rush, I tried making reservations at a couple other spots, but to no avail. I made reservations here after a friend recommended it for it's cool architecture and classy feel.\n\nWe had late reservations (around 8:45pm) and once we checked in, we waited a few minutes to be shown to our table. Here's the breakdown:\n\nService: Our waiter did an excellent job. He told us the specials and gave us some time to look at the menu. We eyed a few things, but when he returned, we asked for recommendations. We basically ended up ordering everything he suggested and we were not disappointed. He was attentive, friendly, and totally on par.\n\nFood: We ordered a couple appetizers to start (please pardon my poor memory, since this was closer to 5 months ago). They were pretty good, but nothing that blew me away exceptionally. For our main course, I believe we had the sole and the striped bass. Both were good and nicely done. For dessert, we went with a classic chocolate cake, reminiscent of a molten cake. Everything was solid, no complaints.\n\nAmbiance: When anyone asks me, I compare this place to the interior of the giant sea snail in Dr. Doolittle -- the old classic version, not the Eddie Murphy one. It's like you've been transported under water. There's glass jelly fish hanging from the ceiling and a spiral staircase.  It's definitely more well lit than other date-night places and lingering on the edge between classy and cheesy.\n\nWould I return? For dinner, probably not. I'm definitely glad I got to experience this place with such great company, but it's on the expensive side and I don't think the food was quite worth it. I have heard great things about their happy hour, though.", "author": "Leana L."}

I had no idea that a couple decades later, I would find myself in the dead center of this palace. Guess where it is! The heart of San Francisco, and it's called Farallon's! The chandeliers at the entrance have jelly fish lining the bar. Wait they are not just lining the bar. They actually serve a purpose and light the bar as well, and they look so realistic!  Every lighting fixture looks like it came from a tide pooling excursion, but then it's huge and life sized and elegant all at the same time. \n\nMy friends and I made reservations here on the night prior to doing our Nike San Francisco Women's Half Marathon. We couldn't have any alcoholic drinks since we were running the next morning, but the sommelier had the bartender whip up some wonderful refreshing non alcoholic drinks to enjoy the night. The drinks were very mojito-like with ginger beer and hints of mint leaves. \n\nOur waitress, who had run the Nike Women's Marathon several years in a row, was very excited for us so she was very animated and very informative about the run. She spent so much time with us and treated us like we were the only guests of hers in the restaurant. Of course, that was not the case the entire time, since the restaurant was a \"full house\" that night. She was so talented and I almost wanted to ask her if she was an actress because she seemed to adapt so well to each restaurant patron at each table. (The table next to us had two older couples and she seemed to tone down her energy and act more professional with them). Yes, I understand every waiter or waitress at each restaurant must do that, but she was different. You almost had to see it for yourself! She is part of the reason why I think the service is close to impeccable here. \n\nThe portions are smaller, so it is recommended that you order at least a couple of \"courses.\" I ordered the molasses glazed pork belly, which came with a white corn cake to start. It was tenderly cooked and almost melted in your mouth when you ate each bite. \n\nFor the main course, I had the seared local petrale sole, which was served with Yukon gold potato gnocchi, roasted butternut squash, and lobster consomm\u00e9 (a soup or broth made with lobster). The gnocchi is what sealed the deal for me on this choice since I needed some \"carb loading.\" It's robust flavor and texture was harmonious with the thin flaky soft simple sole. I really enjoyed this course. \n\nIn between courses, the chef offered a small amuse bouche sampling of a fire roasted tomato soup. It was one of the best tomato soups I've had. It wasn't too thick or watery, but the flavor was so strong it was almost overwhelming for some of my other friends. I love when the flavor is spicy and robust though!\n\nI cannot wait to return to San Francisco and bring my husband here! Not only is this restaurant breath taking inside, I love the quality of food and attention to detail and service.

They are known for the gorgeous underwater theme, and the jellyfish light fixtures in the main dining room are still beautiful, although you can see the age of some other parts of the restaurant. However, I think they run the risk of losing clientele based on the quality of food I had on my first visit- my dining experience was really disappointing, and I would not be inclined to eat here again. I made reservations for a 7:30pm dinner on a Thursday a couple weeks in advance, and they were very accommodating when we ran half an hour late, which was a plus. We were seated at one of the tables right by the open kitchen, which was interesting since you could watch the chefs work. However, our experience went downhill from there. We tried:\n\n-Complimentary Baguette, Sourdough, & Butter (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/farallon-san-francisco?select=dztRLDQnxIdTifVoZ7qNgA#dztRLDQnxIdTifVoZ7qNgA): Delicious! I love when a restaurant has good bread and butter, and it was difficult to stop eating this.\n-Cornmeal Crusted Monterey Bay Calamari (Piquillo Peppers, Balsamic Poached Artichoke, Green Goddess Emulsion, $16, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/farallon-san-francisco?select=dztRLDQnxIdTifVoZ7qNgA#RK_5MRzrJonc1Mp1j6HK4A): Good, but the portion size was on the small side. I also wish the actual calamari pieces were larger, since I felt like you barely had anything to chew on. I would consider ordering this dish again since the green goddess emulsion was really flavorful, as was the cornmeal crust.\n-Maine Lobster Salad (Scallop & Prawn Sausage, Farro, Cippolini Puree, $21.50, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/farallon-san-francisco?select=dztRLDQnxIdTifVoZ7qNgA#2wPO_BHqLI1GW3g9HjDjNQ): Good, but not amazing, and I thought the portion size was small for the price. Although the lobster was cooked really well, I wouldn't order this dish again.\n-Steamed Alaskan Halibut (Porcini Spaetzle, Organic Baby Artichokes, Roasted Maitake Mushrooms, $28, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/farallon-san-francisco?select=dztRLDQnxIdTifVoZ7qNgA#87zP1A86WYRPsrfna5HcQQ): Yuck- the entire dish was super bland and not good at all. To boot, the halibut was overcooked! Our server asked how we liked this dish since it was something new they were trying, and we gave him this feedback. Although he apologized that we didn't love the dish, they didn't comp it for us, which was disappointing.\n-Whiskies of the World Tasting Flight ($27, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/farallon-san-francisco?select=dztRLDQnxIdTifVoZ7qNgA#8ildEPvyrdE-q2AwsntrjA): This was one of the best parts of dinner. If you're a whiskey/scotch aficionado, make sure you ask to see their list! They have a selection of whiskies throughout the world to choose from, along with rare scotches. This particular flight was ok- you got to try whiskies from Belgium, Germany I think?, and Tasmania. Although it was interesting, I wouldn't order this again.\n-Salted Peanut Caramel Sundae (Popcorn, Peanut Brittle, Hot Fudge Sauce, Vanilla Ice Cream, $9, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/farallon-san-francisco?select=dztRLDQnxIdTifVoZ7qNgA#h-PaCfSgjwTutWKfhCC75w): Yum! The flavors in the sundae work really together, and the fudge sauce was delicious. Recommended!\n-Carrot Cake (Burnet Orange-Wild Turkey Rye Ice Cream, Turmeric Candied Carrots, Pecans, $11, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/farallon-san-francisco?select=dztRLDQnxIdTifVoZ7qNgA#EXt5iUSYmnI8llXWYvdHAg): Although this was on the 7x7 100 things to eat before you die list for 2013, I thought it was just ok. The carrot cake itself was fluffy and moist, but the cream cheese frosting layer overpowered the cake, and we didn't like the rye ice cream. I wouldn't get this again.\n-Complimentary Grapefruit Pate de Fruit (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/farallon-san-francisco?select=dztRLDQnxIdTifVoZ7qNgA#GwdYu-_8AQ7JwiCbcpjlEQ): Yuck. I'm not a fan of pate de fruit, so take this review with a grain of salt, but neither of us liked this.\n\nThe negative part about sitting next to the kitchen is that we heard some harsh words exchanged between the staff a couple of times, which made it a bit awkward for us. The service was also lackluster- when our server was around, he was very helpful and attentive. However, he would disappear for long periods of time (we saw him at other tables, so he it seems like he was overstretched), and it was difficult to flag anyone down at times. I think it took over 2 hours to finish dinner, since the food was also slow to come out, which I thought was a little ridiculous. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, based on the slow service and mostly average food, I doubt I will be back to dine at Farallon again. The portion sizes are also on the small size for the prices compared to similar restaurants in SF. Parking in this area can be very difficult, but limited street parking is available.", "author": "Amy D."}

They called me the day prior to confirm but each time I called, no one answered. It was frustrating. Finally the next day I called very shortly after their reservation line opened and was able to get through. I'm not sure why the confirmation is even needed or why they can't do it online. The calling system is tedious and annoying. \n\nThe restaurant itself is absolutely gorgeous and very interesting, I've really never seen anything like it. However, the tables are kind of cramped. My friend and I are over 6 foot tall in heels and we were trying not to play footsie because there was just no room. It kind of takes intimate to a new level. \n\nAnyway, this is one of the only restaurants that actually give you water without asking. In the Midwest, the first thing you get is water on the table but it seems here you have to ask for it or you don't get any. That was not the case here which was welcome. Their wine list is absolutely insane, it's like a novel. Luckily the waiter was very helpful and I cannot complain with his service in the least, he was great.\n\nI ended up getting the endive salad and the lobster entr\u00e9e. The salad was good but the parts didn't seem to fit together. The salad itself was kind of messy to eat and not overly flavorful. It was served with a large slice of a very mild cheese which didn't necessarily complement it well. The brandied cherries and the plum slices were awesome though. \n\nThe lobster was already taken out of the shell and was served with a potato and sweetbread hash. The lobster itself was great, though slightly overcooked. I'll honestly admit I've never eaten sweetbreads so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like but it made the potatoes insanely salty. \n\nMy friend and I split dessert which was a bittersweet chocolate tart with sassafras ice milk. It was pretty good, not too heavy and it was kind of salty and sweet. The bill came to $210 without tip so while the food was pretty good, I probably wouldn't come back. I want to be blown away for that kind of cash. Also, they charge $40 to open a bottle of wine for you, FYI. I didn't know that and it deterred me from buying a bottle.

Imagine my surprise when my Search for a seafood restaurant for a Good Friday night dinner directed me right around the corner from my Union Square hotel, listing the Farallon Restaurant, (named for the windswept islands off the coast of San Francisco) just a block away at 450 Post Street. The restaurant's history gleaned from the website intrigued me: located in a historic building that was originally built for the Elk's Club, and featured in the first issue of Architectural Digest in 1922, it sits on a floor built above the original salt water swimming pool, still in use a level below, but now using the original ornate ceiling that had been built two stories above the pool. And what a ceiling this is! Originally created to simulate a seascape scene, it has been recreated by the current owner restaurateur/designer Pat Kuleto in a whimsical manner to recreate sea urchins, jellyfish, coral, seaweed, shellfish, a nautilus cross-section and sand...\nThe visual feast on entering the restaurant adjacent to the Kensington Lodge Hotel (also an Elks Club property) and being shown to your table in the Jellyfish Lounge or the Pool Room is only an entree to the gastronomic one to follow, what has been termed \"coastal cuisine\", artistically created by Executive Chef Jason Ryczek and Chef/Owner Mark Franz. We (very briefly) considered starting with an indulgence in an ounce of Imperial Osetra Caviar, but at $280, took a pass. We weren't disappointed in the alternative with the Nicosia Valley (http://nicasiocheese.com/, an hour north of San Francisco in Marin County) Dairy-supplied delicious Locarno cheese (discovered by Chef Ryczek, on a weekend outing with his wife), melted into toast, topped with mixed greens, pistachios, and rhubarb-fernet dressing. We complemented this with an order of Pappardelle Aglio E Olio, consisting of smoked hedgehog mushrooms and bottarga, topped with a slow cooked egg, that I gently broke the yolk in order to garnish the pasta! \nThe Farallon offers an extensive (24 page) wine list, ranging from less than $100 bottles, to the Bourgogne Rouge La Tache Domaine de la Romannee-Conti 2012 at $3650. I, as always, opted to bring my own. After leisurely slow-dining over the appetizers, sipping down a lovely bottle of Le Monferrine Piemonte Barbera ($30/bottle corkage charge, 2 bottle limit), we (slowly) savored the Local Ling Cod, wrapped in smoked pork belly and purple pozole, served in a huge black deep bowl with artistic swoops of \"avocado puree\", colorfully topped by greens and radish sections. The artisan breads, topped with butter sprinkled with Hawaiian sea salt, gracing the meal could have been a meal unto themselves, accompanied by the blood-red Barbera wine, for this Good Friday Eve meal. \nThe Dessert menu was tempting, with one ounce Artisan Cheese portions (including Ewe Calf To Be Kidding Wisconsin Bleu) cheese with wine pairings, served with freshly baked walnut bread, to Bergamot Angel Food, Panna Cotta, Fennel Pollen Flan, White Chocolate Mousse Cake, Carrot Ice Cream Cake, Nutella Chocolate Bar, to Sorbet Trio. Fully sated, albeit tempted, we passed, aiming for dessert back in our Grand Hyatt room. \nAs we concluded our delectable seascaped culinary sojourn, we enjoyed visiting with Executive Chef Jason Ryczek, and complimented him on his creative, imaginative, and both visually as well as gastronomically artistic offerings. This restaurant is worth at least several visits, even for out-of-area diners like us. I eagerly look forward to my next fine dining experience at Farallon!", "author": "Kim S."}

They have a beautiful 'jellyfish lounge' downstairs, which is a lounge area underneath large jellyfish-shaped chandeliers. It's very comfortable and great for a small group of people. The bar is also fun -- and you can sit at the oyster bar or the wine bar right across from it. Perfect for a drink and appetizers with a friend, a date, or coworker.\n\nDRINKS: A\nThe happy hour menu had 4 cocktails, 3 wines, and a beer on it. For $6 each, it's an amazing deal in this town. I really enjoyed the Manhattan personally, but you could also get a Moscow Mule, a Daiquiri, or a Margarita. Or a wine of course.\n\nFOOD: A+\nThe food here is fantastic and the happy hour prices are unbelievable. Every day 4:30-7pm, they have the SIX UNTIL SEVEN where everything on the happy hour menu is $6. Highly recommended are:\n- Oysters (6 for $6 and delicious)\n- Seafood Soup (daily special which might vary),  this bisque was to-die-for.\nI wouldn't recommend this place for steamed clams unless you're a big fan of salty food (the chorizo adds a great bacony flavor, but it also makes it way too salty instead of buttery and steeped in white wine). \nI can't wait to come back for a 5-course chef's specials dinner. \n\nSERVICE: A\nVery prompt, very professional.", "author": "Natalia S."}

Yesterday I happened into Happy Hour and was very happy indeed to get an ounce of caviar at half price. However the cava being served for happy hour was flat and undrinkable, so I ordered a real champagne to do the caviar justice.  The cavier is served nicely on a bed of ice and traditional accompaniments included sour cream and chives but no chopped egg or blinis. Instead they serve it with toast points, which were good but kind of thick. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it immensely at half price but would not have liked to have paid full price.  I ordered an entree off the regular menu of john dory over seasonal vegetables (which consisted mostly of onions) as suggested by the waiter, and it was served nicely with a foam and sauces smeared on the plate and a dab of bearnaise sauce. The fish was nicely pan seared. Unfortunately the whole dish was over-salted even for a salt-lover like me...not enough to send back but enough to dampen my enjoyment, though I ate it all with a great pinot noir off the regular menu. Dessert was fanciful and creative and tasted good but the presentation made me laugh. Pretentious and outdated.  The decor at Farallon is unchanged over the years and is still fun and silly but I like it.  There was a nice crowd but not too loud. The wait staff was superb.", "author": "Pam B."}

On a recent Saturday evening, the place seemed to be mostly filled with tourists seeking a great meal in San Francisco and locals out for a special occasions like birthdays.  I'll round my review to 4 stars even though I feel it is more of a 3.5 star experience.\n\nThe interior is designed to look like a Disney-esqe version of the Sea with Jelly Fish lighting and sea shell dining tables.  I would categorize the ambiance as Retro Fantasy.\n\nThe service is outstanding, the service staff works hard to ensure that each diner has a great experience.\n\nFor starters, the seared duck breast was tasty.  The heirloom tomato salad was simple, fresh and delicious.\n\nI had the grilled lobster and found it to be well prepared.  Veggies were served in the lobster shell alongside the tail and claw meat.  I would order this entree again.\n\nFor dessert, I had the grape pie serviced with peanut butter ice cream.  The pie was served warm and was very tasty.\n\nThe wine list is also comprehensive with many options by the glass and in half bottles.\n\nNext time that I have a special occasion or friends visiting from outside the Bay Area, I'll consider Farallon again.", "author": "Lance W."}

I went there last night for an early dinner without the Mr who was still slaving away. I haven't had dinner alone in a fine dining establishment in a while, and really wanted to just be alone so I opted out from sitting at the bar. \n\nSince I was dining alone, I was able to take as many photos as I wished which I excitedly did so! And they are here! :) \n\nI started with the duck liver mousse, they give you a lot of crostini to go with it, pickled baby vegetables and a spoonful of mustard with seeds. What I did first was I ate the mousse with the crostini first. Then I topped it off with the pickled vegetables, then I spread a bit of mustard over the mousse and topped it off with the vegetable. I liked eating all three together best. This definitely could have been shared between two people. I did not finish. \n\nThe second course I picked the diver scallop. Yes you read that right, you get one. But it's AMAZING!! It could be that because there's only one that made it taste all the more amazing and leaves you wanting more but nonetheless I highly recommend this. The gentleman sitting across from me who came afterwards also ordered the scallop. \n\nThe third dish for my entree I had the striped bass. The skin was very crispy and the filet was about half the size of my palm, I loved the little sunchoke that accompanied the dish. \n\nWith a glass of wine, everything came out to about $100 for me alone.

The jelly fish chandeliers are lovely -- they get 5 stars. And,the wine list is extensive and great stair step in pricing...you don't have to spend a lot on a good bottle at Farallon.\n\nThe service was just so-so.The staff was super nice and attentive but not quite as efficient as other SF restaurants (yes, we are spoiled and have high standards in this city) I was dismayed that our shellfish appetizers arrived before we had the proper utensils and plates to eat it with. We actually had to request the shellfish forks, crackers, and plates --- they must have forgot that we needed them! My champagne was delivered sometime after the appetizer as well even though I ordered it at the same time as the shellfish.\n\nOur dinner entrees included Lingcod, Sablefish, and a side of the squid ink pasta. All were very good. But, the fish portions were considerably smaller than other places we have dined in SF. I wasn't wowed by the Blueberry marble cake dessert either. \n\nPerhaps Farallon gets most of their business from tourists....but living in San Francisco there are just too many fantastic restaurants with better service and food to recommend Farallon to others or ever personally go back.", "author": "Katie S."}

We had actually tried going somewhere else (they were closed on President's Day) but we really wanted a nice seafood restaurant so we took the concierge's advice and came to Farallon.  Aside from some of the tacky interior (a bit too much of the seafood theme) the food was really good.  You don't eat the interior.\n\nWe called here on our way back from our failed first attempt at getting dinner to make a reservation.  We were quite happy when they said they could accommodate us when we arrived.  As soon as we arrived we were seated in the large back room.  Upon walking into the restaurant, I honestly thought the front room was the entire restaurant.  That is not the case.  The back room is pretty spacious and that is where we ended up sitting.\n\nWe started out with the Roasted Baby Heirloom Beet Salad ($14) which the split in half for us.  This came with dungeness crab, gremolata (a chopped herb condiment typically made of lemon zest, garlic, and parsley) and curry cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.  This was a very nice dish.  It was difficult to taste the beets and the crab at the same time, but separately they were very good.  I think we both wanted more of this dish.\n\nFor mains Sue had the Grilled Double R Ranch Petite Filet of Beef ($36) which came with hedgehog mushrooms, fondant potato, haricots verts and a b\u00e9arnaise sauce.  Ordered medium rare and it came out medium rare.  I tried a bit and you could cut that meat with a spoon.  I had the Cedar Grilled Cascade Mountain Arctic Char ($27) with braised dino kale, roasted turnip and celery root remoulade.  This char was similar in color to salmon with a taste somewhere between salmon and trout.  I decided on the char as it is a fish I don't have very much experience with.\n\nFor dessert (save room for dessert) we had the Milk Chocolate Hibiscus Mousse ($10) which had dark chocolate-zinfandel ice cream, candied kumquats and hibiscus cake.  What a phenomenal way to end a meal.  Possibly one of the best desserts I've ever had.\n\nOur server (Leyla) was very attentive to our needs.  She was very knowledgeable about the food as well as the wine that Sue ordered.  She was very friendly and very good at her job.

I grabbed a beer. This rude-as-f!@# staff woman went around shaming us in front of coworkers for doing it.\n\nNote to Farallon: I get that dealing with drunk people sucks. But as our office admin pointed out to me later, you could have just charged us for the individual drinks instead of reaching for the embarrassment card. Our company would have paid for them.\n\nHaving said that, staff was very patient on another visit when my group went for oysters. They're $6 for six oysters during HH. We got a TON right before happy hour ended, and the waiters were perfectly accommodating. Good oysters, too. Nice atmosphere. Decent drinks.

Disappointed the hotel recommended this place out of all the seafood in this city. We still can not get the horrible taste out of our mouths.

The food is of excellent quality (and priced accordingly; expect the bill to exceed $100 per person if you enjoy alcohol). Service in our case was excellent and the waitress was spot on with her recommendations.\n\nTheir kusshi oysters from British Columbia are so delicious that ordering a variety of types feels completely unnecessary - none of the others compared. The black bass was probably the best I've ever tasted, though I'm less impressed with their tombo tuna.

There is nothing ill to say. \n\nFor a special night out we started at the bar to take advantage of the Jellyfish Bar happy hour menu. Extremely well-rounded (not to sweet and not to briny) oysters and cocktails welcomed us (and for a price we would jump for again). The Oysters and the Hemingway Daiquiri were the winners of the happy hour.  But alas the menu of inspiring cocktails wooed us off of the six dollar page. They had clever little names that I can't recollect but the best one (peach blossom?) was simply divine with gin, peach, herbs and sparkling wine. \n\nOn to dinner, where we shared the Paprika Octopus which the menu claims to have been braised, but it was so tender and velvety that I began to doubt their description. \nThe octopus was so plump and soft that it compared in texture to the plump raisins. \n\nNext we had the Gnocchi and Sweetbreads. Both were a great take on comfort food. The gnocchi was supple-soft and earthy delicious with crunch from the pomegranate seeds. The sweetbreads were like chicken nuggets from heaven. Softly fried and silky with an apple puree as a compliment. At this point we were close to being full, but we had yet to try the pancetta wrapped rabbit and yes it was as good as it sounds. And came with a to-die for rabbit liver mousse on a crostini. The herbed faro and sauce rounded it out into a great ending note. \n\nMy only regret was that we were too full for desert (the first and second plates aren't all that small).  \n\nJust look at a few pictures and you can see that the atmosphere transports you into an underwater realm (I recommend the google tour if you need further proof).

We asked the front desk attendant for a recommendation on a good seafood place and she recommended the Farallon.

Although this might not sound that bad you might want to think twice once you see the pricing. I'm not at all opposed to paying top dollar when the food and service are spectacular, which this wasn't. If you're looking for a decent meal with under whelming service and over extended wait times for your dinner than this is the place for you. When you receive your meals they are prepared as ordered, or at least we did. The manager also seemed to care and apologized but the server blamed the order on a miscommunication.

In the past 10 years, thousands of other restaurants have popped up and are so much better.  \n\nOnly went here because my brother had his birthday dinner here.  It was one of the only places that could take 7 people with a week's notice.  When you look around, you won't see any SF locals.  Mostly tourists.\n\nWe started with the royal platter and caviar.  I love caviar and this was pretty good.  As for the platter, it was ok for $130.  It had lobster, shrimp, crab, oysters, clams, etc, but only had cocktail sauce and the vinegar sauce you typically get with oysters.  Come on, I'm not dipping my lobster or crab in cocktail sauce.  Should have asked for butter but our waitress was absent for a while.\n\nAs for appetizers, we ordered linguine with clams, salads, gazpacho, corn risotto, etc.  The waitress raved about the linguine so a few people ordered it.  It was on the salty side and just ok.  The gazpacho was also a little salty.  The corn risotto with truffle oil was the only thing we liked.  \n\nAs for the entrees, we ordered lobster, filet mignon, salmon, and pork cheeks.  Lobster had holladaise sauce on it, don't think anyone enjoyed it on their lobster, plain butter would have been a million times better.  Most of the side dishes to the entrees were salty and not memorable.  The waitress raved about the corn tortellini with my lobster, they were not that great and sprinkled with something unidentifiable, in a bad way (like plastic fake bacon bits).  Pork cheeks were ok, a little dry.  But, my husband did enjoy his fillet mignon but didn't like any of his side dishes.\n\nAs for dessert, we ordered the smore sundae and chocolates.  The sundae was good but the chocolates were not that great, a few tasted stale.  How can you mess up chocolates?1?!\n\nAs for service, on the slow side.  There was about 30 min wait between our appetizers and entrees.  In addition, it took 30+ mins to get and pay for our check after dessert.  It was a 3.5 hour dinner that really should have been shorter.  \n\nIf you are a tourist staying in Union Square and don't want to travel far, this might be the place to go.

The over priced menu was not the issue, I have no problem spending money on quality but this was not quality. We started with the sea urchin as the appetiser, it was far from the best I've  ever had, good thing we have a sense of humour since it was about $90. Then came the main course, I had the tuna, it lacked any type of flavour and was dry. My wife had the steak and lobster, with a side of some sort of undercooked flavourless potato au gratin that were literally raw. The lobster tail was the size of a tootsies roll, however it did have flavour and was cooked well! The steak was by are the best part of the meal, it was cooked perfectly and was very tender and delicious. The server Jeremy I think was a broadway theatre actor or just had a incredibly snobby attitude! But ever that we were able to roll with and don't blame him for his lack of personality. Thank goodness we can afford the $400 dinner for two and laugh about the experience, just wish we went in here with no expectations, if we had done that we would not have been so let down.

The decor inside is beautiful. They really outdid themselves with it. I cannot think of another restaurant that has put so much effort into a thematic ambiance. The paintings, light fixtures, sconces, chairs, everything is sea themed. For drinks, my partner had the Wolf Family Cabernet Sauvignon and thoroughly enjoyed it. I had a couple of drinks. The first was on their cocktail menu, and I believe it was called a Saint Benedictine. It was a slightly sweeter version of a Manhattan, and, while it was delicious, came in a glass that was half the size of a martini glass. Then, I decided to have a Manhattan and it was pretty good. For food, we shared the a Abalone with Chestnut Ravioli, Lobster Tail with Burrata and Beets, and the Lingcod with Rustic Ratatouille. The Abalone literally came with three tiny ravioli... for the price of $29. It was delicious, but the portion could have been bigger. The ravioli is filled with chestnuts in brown butter. It was really small, though. For $29? At least add a few more ravioli. The lobster tail with beets was a good portion, but bland tasting. We would try something else next time. The lingcod with ratatouille was a great portion and delicious. I highly recommend it. For dessert, we had the grilled banana bread with coconut ice cream and caramel. It was good, but it didn't taste like it was fresh. The banana bread was dry, but the portion was good for two. Our server, Kirsten, was great!

He tried to tell us that a type of wine we were looking for was only used for blending. He returned several times to \"answer any questions\" and try to rush us into ordering before we were ready. After choosing two reasonable bottles--one red and one white--which we asked him to open and leave on the table so each could pour what he or she wanted with whatever course he or she wanted it with, he said \"No Miss, that's my job\" and removed the two bottles to the other end of the table, pouring too fast and heavily and completely inappropriately, again, rushing us and clearly trying to encourage us to buy more wine. At the end of the meal he told us that the restaurant did not have any herbal teas, but could serve us chamomile, he insisted that chamomile was not an herbal tea (?) in a brusque and superior fashion. The final, unforgivable offense was that our check was brought to the table...without requesting it. It has been so long since this happened to us at any restaurant above the level of fast food, that our jaws dropped. \n\nTruly, for a dinner for 7 costing nearly $100 per person, we should have received friendly, competent service, rather than the egregiously rude treatment we did receive.\n\nThe stunningly poor service is truly the only reason for the low rating. I wish it were possible to rate separate aspects of the experience separately, because the food was truly excellent. The Branzino, the gnocchi with chevre-based sauce, and other items were all well prepared. The oysters were delicious. \n\nIn addition, the decor at Farallon's is wonderful! There are glass jellyfish fixtures hanging from the ceiling, tiled floors in the rest rooms, lamps formed like sea urchins, furnishings which looked like Ariel herself would have been at home there. For this reason alone, it's worth a visit.", "author": "Ann S."}

We took their Valentine's special with wine pairings, plus a small seafood platter. The ahi tuna poke was my favourite, it was so delicious. The seafood were all fresh, I loved the oysters and the crab meat. The snapper was also great.

We grabbed a seat on the cushioned benches and were pretty quickly greeted.  We were given water a few minutes later and then put in our orders:\n\n-Hemingway daiquiri ($6): my boyfriend and I just wanted to try out one drink and we wanted to just share.  The waiter was nice enough to split it into two glasses for us.  This was a pretty tasty drink with plenty of flavors (but not the typical super sweet syrupy flavor of most daiquiri's we imagine).  \n\n-Beef sliders ($6): two small sliders and a fair portion of fries.  It's not enough for a meal, but definitely a nice snack.  The sliders were topped with some arugula and a nice creamy aioli.  The bun was very soft and a bit sweet.  As my boyfriend put it, the fries resembled in-n-out fries (just simple potato slices) and were pretty tasty.  \n\n-Half a dozen Drake's Bay Oysters ($6):  I don't usually eat oysters, but I believe this is considered to be quite a deal.  I think that usually they are about $3.50 each.  The oysters were nicely plated on a giant plate of ice and served with a couple of lemon wedges and some vinegar mignonette.  The oysters seemed fresh and I didn't gag (as I have in the past when attempting to eat oysters).  Honestly, I don't have much to say because oysters just aren't really for me.  But the table next to us seemed to like them a lot.  After finishing their first dozen, they ordered another dozen.  \n\nOverall, this seems like a nice bar to have a drink and get away from the bustle of Union Square.  The staff is pretty helpful and the place is \"pretty\" to look at.  They have some jellyfish lighting fixtures and some nice metal (wrought iron?) accents throughout the restaurant/stairways.  It seems like happy hour is a good deal if you like oysters, otherwise it's so-so.  I think I prefer Morton's happy hour (which is next door).", "author": "Samantha L."}

In last week, we had decent service from the waiter (although I wish they'd ask if we need something when there's a natural break in the conversation, versus when someone is in the middle of speaking). The cocktails are still frou frou, the dessert even more, and while I'm not sure it's entirely fair to judge the restaurant based on one night's menu, I wasn't overly inspired by the last menu we saw. The food was good, it just didn't seem up to the ideas/previous experiences I'd had at Farallon. We'll give it another try in a month, and see how it goes then.\n\nI will say this though. The rye whiskey ice cream that came with the carrot cake should be an item all by it's lonesome on the menu. We ordered 4 different desserts, and that ice cream was by FAR the best of the 4. \n\nFarallon - what's up with the 2% only milk?

I wasn't so sure what to expect but everyone we asked confirmed that it was going to be good. \n\nWe arrived on time and our table was ready just a few minutes later. We walked in and I was very impressed with the the dinning area. The decor and the layout was different than other places. It definitely had a nice feel and great ambiance. Our waiter was super nice and helpful. My boyfriend wanted oysters for himself so he ordered half dozen. Two each of 3 different kinds. Drakes bay, blue points and olympias. I ordered the Cornmeal Crusted Monterey Bay Calamari for an appetizer.  Just the perfect amount if time later they arrived. My calamari was really good. Not too greasy although it was fried. It was perfectly done and the sauce that was underneath was called green goddess emulsion. It was garlicky and different than any other tomato based sauce I've had. The dish also had small peppers and a nice slice of artichoke. The artichoke was a nice balance with the friedness. \n\nFor our main course my boyfriend ordered the Roasted Karlonas Farms Quail and I ordered the Steamed Alaskian Halibut. I asked if there was any way they could grill the Halibut instead and they did! I was very happy that they did and it was just perfect. My halibut came on a bed of porcini spaetzle which is made in house and just delicious. There was a little more in the plate that I feel was needed because it's so rich in flavor but too much is better than too little. It also had artichokes that were prepared perfectly and added a nice fresh event  along with the arugula. Also,it had maitake mushrooms with the arugula. Nice touch. Everything came together and was just delicious. I personally am not a fan of quail. Haven't really tried it and don't really care to order it. My boyfriend has me try a bite and it was scrumptious. Cooked perfectly, flavors were on point and the presentation was good  \n\nIt was my birthday so my lovely boyfriend requested to bring out a dessert and knew I wanted the carrot cake so he requested the that instead of the standard chocolate or whatever it is. They brought it out with happy birthday written and a candle. First bite. Show stopper. Light, fluffy and moist. My experience with carrot cake is typically heavy and thick but this was done just right. Right enough that we ate the entire thing. I'm not a dessert person so that's saying a lot coming from me! \n\nOverall. Great place. Not a super high fine dining place but just as good as other fine dinning places and the price points really are fair.

I ordered the Hemingway daiquiri, cornmeal crusted local calamari and cast iron roasted Maryland striped bass. He had the Maine lobster salad and the grilled Hawaiian tombo tuna. The waiter brought out fresh bread with a thick square of butter, sprinkled lightly with \"volcanic sea salt\" (amazing...). Let's start with the appetizers:\n\nCalamari: green goddess emulsion was so flavorful. The calamari was fresh and the cornmeal coating was perfect - light, crunchy, and well seasoned. The balsamic roasted artichoke heart was so tender, even the stem was edible! Incredible flavor composition and very aesthetically pleasing.\n\nLobster salad: holy cow. The sweetest, freshest lobster I've ever had the pleasure of eating. The scallop and prawn sausage was so darn good, and definitely had the consistency of a *soft* sausage. Farro was well cooked and the cioppolini puree was great.\n\nTuna: melt in your mouth seared tuna, with just the most delicately marinated miso mushrooms. Best mushrooms I've ever had, they picked up the flavor of the miso broth so well. Amazing.\n\nBass: I don't know how they do it, but the outside was potato chip crispy, while the inside was soft, moist, flakey, and tender. The pearl onions gave a nice sweet crunch and the sunchokes were flavorful and chewy.\n\nHemingway daiquiri: Fallaron can definitely make a drink. This is a must have when we come back. Tasty, tart, and easy to sip. The daiquiri came in a martini glass and was accompanied by a petite cherry (at least that's what it looked like, I didn't eat it).\n\nWe were so impressed with our appetizers and entrees that we absolutely were dead set on trying their dessert menu. Here's what we had:\n\nEspresso Sambuca: like an espresso laced black liquorice fire shooting down your throat. Not for the faint of heart. We both enjoyed this one.\n\nCarrot cake: beautifully creamy frosting, moist and thick carrot cake. Small dollop of vanilla ice cream. This was the winner of the desert round!\n\nIce cream sundae: crispy crunchy peanuts on a bed of vanilla ice cream, lightly drizzled with fudge. The fudge was the best part, in my opinion.\n\nTotal bill was $150 for two.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-12-17", "description": "If it would not have been for the cold and snooty hostess, our dinner at Farallon would have been enchanting. \n\nTHE HOSTESS:\nFour women who arrived on time separately. One similar experience of cold treatment by the hostess.  I arrived first on time for our reservation. The hostess at the door \"greeted\" me without any eye contact, no smile, no \"Hello\" or \"Good evening.\"  She handed me over to a server like a piece of unwanted Christmas fruitcake.\n\nOne of my gf arrived next and she looked her up and down. Our two other friends received the same cold-shoulder reception.\n\nWe are a group of appropriately dressed young professional women with nice manners to match.\n\nHer demeanor would have set tone for the evening if not for the great service we received.\n\nTHE SERVERS:\nOur main server was a delight!  Very professional, genuinely friendly and patient.  The busperson was the same as well as the rest of the service team.  He gave my friend a complimentary drink after her drink spilled a couple of drops.  \n\nWe received a second order of complimentary amuse bouche when he thought our order was taking a little bit too long. He made sure that my vegan friend got vegan amuse bouche and entree.\n\nUNDER THE SEA:\nDecor is \"Under the Sea\".  I do not know how to exactly describe it but if not for it being in SF and given the fine dining status of Farallon, it would have been on the gaudy side. However, Farallon pulled it off. It was classy despite the \"coral-inspired gray spiky\" ceiling mimicking being \"under the sea\". However, the open kitchen, elegant leather booths and white linens gave the restaurant an elegant look and feel.\n\n\nSENIOR SET:\nMy friends and I are no longer in our 20s but we do look young. We felt like students in our Catholic school days -- being surrounded by a much older crowd in their 50s, 60s and up --and  were expected to behave, be seen but not heard.\n\nAt first the ambiance was stuffy and we were afraid to make any noise. Luckily the restaurant got noisy as it got crowded and we felt more comfortable to celebrate the holidays.\n\nATTIRE:\nEverywhere we looked were debonair grandpas and elegantly-dressed grandmas. \n\nWe were here our our annual girls' holiday party and luckily we were nicely dressed. Attire is definitely business-casual. \n\nDRINKS:\nI  only had one cocktail which was the  \"Diabolita\". It was well-crafted, delicious and strong. Too strong that I could not drink another one. Between my 3 friends, they had NINE cocktails including La Paloma. I had a sip of their drinks which  were good but not the best I've had. \n\nFOOD:\n2 complimentary amuse bouche of salmon tartare and phyllo triangles and  1 vegan soup\n\n2 Winter Salads (14 each) which were just simple greens.\n\nSTUFFED MONTEREY SQUID ($15) roasted maitake mushrooms, petite frisee\n*My friend and I shared this. Our server was nice enough to serve this to us on 2 separate plates. We got 2 stuffed squids each and they were delicious!  This was a better value than the small winter salad.\n\nOVEN ROASTED ALASKAN TRUE COD (29.5) dungeness crab, linguisa,  kale \n*My main dish. The skin was perfectly crispy while the fish itself was fresh. Overall it was salty and was one dimensional in flavors although not in texture. It was good but not memorable.\n\nMy friends had the AHI TUNA (29), STEAK (36.5) AND SCALLOPS (28).\n\nWe were given a complimentary dessert of fruit gelatins which were very yummy. We skipped dessert but ordered an expresso and latte.\n\nOur final check was $400. \n\nPARTING WORDS:\nI believe that every staff of an establishment is the face and representative of that business. Either re-train your hostess whose function is to put every patron at ease or replace her with a friendlier face with a kind personality to match.\n\nBusinesses do not gain anything by being arrogant or unapproachable. As much as I found the food at Farallon to be just fine but not exquisite, the impressive service and nice ambiance would have been an incentive for me to return with my partner and other friends. \n\nHowever, I do not want to experience again nor subject my loved ones to the same cold treatment we received from the hostess. Nobody wants to feel like they were being looked down upon most especially if you are dropping hundreds of dollars for a meal.  It makes the mind wonder: is it because we are young, women of color, or we are just not cool enough?  \n\nLady, we are cool. Too cool for your attitude that we did not let you ruin our evening. \n\nIt was still  a lovely dinner and cheers to those who made it possible -- our server and those who assisted him.", "author": "Foodie F."}

Sadly the meal will only be memorable for the price. That's not to say the place is bad in fact I think this place is quite good and has many positive aspects to it. \n\nStarting with the ambiance this place is gorgeous, a bit like little mermaid meets Ritz Carlton.  Really an amazing space, our seat by the open kitchen was awesome and we enjoyed the din of the staff and the chef as they prepared the orders.  For some strange reason this place has a dump for a bathroom.  For as much money as was lifted from my wallet at this place I want to be transported when I tinkle.\n\nOnto the wine; wow what a list.  Our server pointed out his favorite $200+ bottles of wine that I am sure he's not actually drinking, although he seemed quite knowledgeable about them and he's likely making a grip serving an overpriced experience to tourists like myself.  When I asked for him to point out a less egregiously priced bottle we settled on a 2009 Beaune which I thought was fantastic even at $100.00.\n\nThe food was all over the map here, the prawn cocktail had 4 shrimp [not prawns] with heirloom grape tomatoes; sounds good; it wasn't.  Stuffed calamari was quite good and the pork belly with caviar lentils was excellent.  If your going to do a three course meal I would highly recommend just ordering three of these.  The lobster sounded good \"Warm Half 2 lb Maine Lobster\", try 3 ounces of slightly overcooked lobster on a bed of the coulis of the day I am guessing.  Desert was one of the best parts of the meal. \n\nThe service was quite good, lots of teamwork and some friendly staff.  The chef was burly and regal as he masterfully controlled the kitchen. Our waiter seemed a little more busy than the other staff impressing the customers with his knowledge of pairings and such.   Lots of good stuff about this place but for the money there just needs to be more.", "author": "Leonard S."}

We sat at a nice sized table with comfortable chairs. We ordered their smaller of the two chilled seafood platter as an appetizer. (About $70, but worth every penny). It was DELICIOUS. The oysters were fresh, the lobster was juicy and succulent... Not one bad thing to say about it. Then came the entrees..... Everyone tried a different fish, and we all shared a little with each other. Everything was cooked perfectly, with excellent texture/flavor. After all of that, we decided to go for some dessert cheese platter action.... Every cheese we had on the platter was excellent and plentiful.

It's literally just a pile of crab meat (which isn't bad at all anyways).\n\n4. SECOND COURSE: Perigold Black Truffles\nThe chestnut risotto is to die for, and the truffles weren't too overpowering, so overall a very well-balanced flavorful dish.

THIRD COURSE: Seared Australian Barramundi\nThis was my favorite dish by far, and I wish I skipped second course just so that I could enjoy this course more than I already did. The butternut squash added the perfect warmth to the dish, and the fish was delicious as well.\n\n6. DESSERT: Pear Sorbet\nFreaking. Delicious.\n\nIf you make reservations, make sure to request a table in the main dining hall.

My friend really wanted $1 oysters for happy hour and we came across this place from a list of restaurants we found on the internet. We didn't know much about the place but when we arrived we were like uh... O.O is this the right place?!? The restaurant decor and environment is super nice and we were definitely not expecting that. \n\nThey serve oysters by the half dozen but it's pretty much $1 per oyster. They don't have much variety in their drinks list for happy hour, just a couple cocktails and a beer. Each happy hour dish is $6 and the dishes all sounded super tasty and I was thinking to myself like \"Wow for such a fancy restaurant, they have pretty good pricing on their happy hour dishes!\"\n\nMy friend and I ordered 2 dozen of oysters, the sliders, the potato croquettes, and a couple drinks. The oysters were really fresh and yummy. I'd definitely come back if I had an oyster craving. The potato croquettes and sliders were also really good, but what bugged me was that the servings were TINY. So I guess it really wasn't a great of a happy hour deal as I thought it was. So..do not come here hungry for happy hour! \n\nI also don't recommend coming with a large group, I'd say come with maybe a group of 2-3 because there is very limited seating and the tables and bar area is not that big.", "author": "Ann N."}

I decided since it was my birthday we would try a variety of things. \n\nWe started off with getting a half of a lobster with 6 oysters randomly suggested by the server. I have never tried lobster and I wanted to experience it at a nice restaurant. The lobster and the oysters were served cold, and they were served on an ice tray. \n\nThe oysters and the lobster came with a variety of sauces and spices, which complimented the oysters and lobsters nicely. I can say however I would have enjoyed the crab better, however the lobster was really well done, and fresh. All the tools came to crack the lobster and get all the meat out. \n\nMy girlfriend had the clam and seafood stew, with bread. It came out sizzling hot, and everything tasted fresh and wonderful experience eating. \n\nAfterwords I ordered the fettucini pasta and it was nicely arranged on the plate. Everything was beautiful and nicely decorated.  \n\nWhat made the restaurant stand out was the ambiance of the place. We sat in the booth. It looked like we were under water. It wasn't done in a cheesy restaurant style way like on the fisherman's warf. My favorite part was the artwork on the walls, and the jellyfish as lights, each one being different. \n\nThe bread was made fresh and delivered with butter and everything was delicious. We had the best seat in the house. \n\nThe waitress was really friendly and positive, and knew what we would like, and offered suggestions and had a good smile. She even took our picture with our camera. \n\nAfterwords we had dessert which was a white chocolate mousse, and some cake with some little eggs on top of the cake. \n\nThe restaurant was expensive, however the prices for fresh fish and seafood are comparable to other restaurants i've eaten. I left full. \n\nI went to another seafood restaurant in San Francisco and paid $25 for a little square cube of fish.

He wanted to binge.    When I called for my reservation I asked him about the tray. It was after all 130. I wanted to find out if it was worth it. The woman I talked to a shirred me that it was enough for 5 people as an appetizer. There were shell fish crab shrimp lobster and so forth. When we got to the restaurant we again asked our server about it and he assured us that it was enough for an entree and perhaps a small salad for two people. Let's just say there wasn't. We were disappointed in the lack of opulence and after spending $130 on that went back to look at the menu to see what else we want to have.  \n\nWe both ordered the soup which was a seafood bisque. I thought it was a little too spicy, it really covered up the wonderful seafood flavor. But I did like the smokiness. They topped it off with a little bit of virgin olive oil and a cognac Chantilly which is just basically heavy cream and cognac and was a great touch.\n\nI ordered the saut\u00e9ed salmon with mashed potatoes and saut\u00e9ed gypsy peppers.  The peppers were so spicy that they overwelmed the salmon (which was obviously farm raised).\n\nThe chef ask me how I liked it, & I told him about the peppers and he told me that the batches of peppers very on spiciness. It's hard to maintain the flavor because of that. The struck me as just wrong. If you can't maintain the flavor of the dish because of seasonal ingredients then you need to change the dish.\n\nWe did not order dessert because of the stream of the flavor combinations. There was nothing we recognized except for a somemore ice cream sundae and a peach sorbet. The desserts were complicated. I'm a pastry chef and instructor, and I've been doing it 30 years. I teach my students that in creating a pastry menu you need to push the envelope, but you also have to keep its familiar.    I wanted chocolate and creamy, my husband wanted custard, there was nothing recognizable as such.  Chocolate with cardamon and wafer...\n\nAlso wanted to mention that the salad dressing was all vinegar.  Very unbalanced.\n\nI understand why Farallon does not have a star.

I got the Dungeness crab meat with Bone Marrow and side of bread to eat with, I get my Bone marrow, scoop my spoon in, the bone marrow was like cutting into cold butter and was truly disgusting!! The Crab meat was on top of it so I did not notice that it was hard underneath. It seems as they did not cook that marrow. I have had marrow many times and I was surprised that they would allow for this to come out of their kitchen. I SENT it back and our server who was great, totally understood. While my husband was picking on his meal they served me a small taste of soup to keep me occupied while they cook my food. We spoke with the manager and he said that we were not the only customers who have complained that evening. Why would he even say that, it made us feel worse by choosing this venue for our date night,  not a good sign for us , really made me lose confidence with the restaurant. I finally received my dinner 15 min later, it still was Awful!! I just sent it back and we ended our time with them. They did Comp us for our meal as I did Not have a Meal!! We have been here many times for over 8 years, this restaurant has gone Down Hill and will not be back again! It literally gave me a bad taste!!", "author": "Vivian C."}

The bar area servers were all really kind as well. \n\nAfter we were finished in the bar, they seated us for dinner. Here is where things became worse. Our waiter was not necessarily rude, but seemed very distant and not interested. The food was also sub par. They bring an amuse, but it wasn't anything memorable. The snapper dish was flavorful, but make sure you avoid the ono. The dish had absolutely no flavor. The fish was also first served WAY underdone and two of us had ordered it so we had to wait for them to recook it. This took a lifetime and everyone else at the table had finished their meals long before the ono was brought back. It was also clearly overcooked by this point and very dry. We were very unsatisfied by this dish.\n\nFor dessert, the black velvet cake is rich and pretty good, but wasn't enough to save the mistake from the entrees. So after some serious $$$ we left not very satisfied. If I were ever to go back, it would only be for happy hour.

Our server was very helpful and attentive, we told him we had no idea what to order and he accommodated us very well. He suggested the 5-course dinner they were offering that night and explained to us that they were all perfect portioned and that we would not be in a food coma afterwards. My bf and I have a bad habit of ordering half the menu and half the appetizers. He also suggested the wine pairing that came as an option, we decided to go for it for and be civilized people for once. We also had already ordered cocktails and liquor beforehand... Bad idea. Haha. \n\nSorry, I don't remember the exact names of the dishes but here goes..\n\nFirst course - sashimi assortment with some ceviche. Yummy! It was very fresh. My bf is from out of state and land of the better sushi so he knows his stuff. \n\nSecond- some kind of pea risotto with giant prawns.

I need it. \n\nFifth- some kind of chocolate cake paired with dessert cognac. Yummy to the cake! \n\nIn total there were 5 glasses of wine/cognac with the 5 courses. I am not at all a wine person but I think they went well with the food. My bf is also not a wine drinker, we just wanted to give it a try. By the end of the night, our tummies were filled just right.

Seared and rare... it was lovely.\n\nI wasn't familiar with the specific wineries, but I found it interesting that as lovely and professional as the wait staff were, they were completely upside down on the wine recommendations.

I was happier with the Russian River originating first \"by the glass\" I chose, which was the kind of \"meaty\" red I enjoy.\n\nWhen each course arrived... a parade of well dressed staff set the plates down simultaneously... that was lovely.  Excellent dessert selection, although the one I chose had the poached pair featured in the description but arrived featuring the cheese tort with just a tiny garnish of the fruit.

Then I had the tasting of ahi tuna, which was disappointing.  They had three different (small) preparations and none were that good.  It was almost as plain vanilla as the appetizers at the Cosmopolitan in Soma.  \n\nThe entrees were all very good but not exceptional.   The seared black bass with pea sprouts and tempura spring onions was very tasty and the best of the entrees we tried.  I ordered the roasted striped bass with mushroom gnocchi, shiitake, and a porcini fondue.  Flavor was really good but it just didn't taste that refined.  Last we had the Dover scallops with lentils - again very good , just not amazing.   Our wines were fine. \n\nWe really liked our server although were disappointed not to be in the main dining room.  At least we weren't in the front area near the bar.  But the first table we were seated at was very distracting as I could see the kitchen door swinging open every  few seconds, so we moved to a different table still in the area outside the main dining room.  Decorations are whimsical - personally I'm not a big fan of the decor but all my friends love it.  The restaurant is way too loud to be really romantic. Felt a bit like a family style restaurant.  The main dining room is darker so that's better than the other rooms which are far too brightly lit to be romantic.  \n\nWe had trouble parking and even getting to Union Square because of the Chinese New Year festivities and a number of streets were blocked off.  In fact Farallon wasn't even operating valet because Post Street itself  was blocked off, and you couldn't easily get to several of the Union Square garages.  But when we called ahead to say we would be running late (before our scheduled reservation time) the hostess was unaccommodating - she said they knew about the traffic and parking issues but would only hold our reservation for 15 minutes.

I was here on a dinner date (which we made a reservation for) and was seated at a table close to the kitchen area and under a bothersome glaringly bright light. We saw open tables and asked our waitress if we could move, but she said no rather curtly, and that they were reserved for other people. I'm not sure what that even meant, did guests call ahead and specify which table they wanted? Luckily another waitress dropped by and acknowledged the bright lamp, and said she noticed we looked uncomfortable. She promptly seated us at another table and became our server. Thank goodness, or else my date would have to stare at all my face pores illuminated by that stadium light throughout dinner. Our new server was very friendly and knowledgable about the food and ingredients. She even complimented me.

We were a party of 4 with reservations and were seating quickly.  The decor is super cool, as I understand it's an old bath house that was converted.  But the sound does weird things in there.  Somewhere near us, there was a rather tipsy woman with a horrible and loud LOUD laugh.  Due to the way sound travels in the restaurant, we could not figure out where it was coming from, but it sounded like it was right next to us.  It was so loud and distracting for so long, that we finally started talking about asking our server to ask the woman to please keep it down.  Eventually the party left (after about an hour).\n\nEverything we tried was delicious.  Two of us had the lobster.  We all had dessert.  FANTASTIC!  Would go again!", "author": "Denise B."}

We enter the small, intimate restaurant, adjacent to another structure under renovation - still, just happy to be there. Hostess asks for reservations, we have none but says 1 of 3 small 2-person tables at the window is available so we 'bite.'\n\n3. Waiter, seems normal at first. Menu is normal with a few neat items. Strange, no chowder dish. Not sure why. \n\n4. Problems really start with waiter number two/assistant, who hits my phone with the plates he sets down. It came out of the blue from my side and he did not warn me, then hit it, then said nothing. Not okay. But moments before he wiped right in front of me and my wife - without telling us he was reaching right in front of us. Strange. Simply say 'excuse me' or similar.\n\n5. We order a recommended soup, white bass, and basically schnitzel or lightly-breaded pork chops, with water and iced tea.\n\n6. The white bass was 4 bites in size - very minimal. The schnitzel was a normal portion size. The bass was okay. The pork was normal.\n\n7. But before it arrives, we wait, and wait, and wait -- 45-50 minutes before we receive our main entree. To be fair, we did receive the soup after 15 minutes. So for 1/2 an hour, nothing, literally. No service, no bread with the soup, no water service. No ice tea refill.\n\n8. Deep into the wait, maybe around 38-42 minute time frame, I got up and tracked down the waiter. He says literally the cook just said it coming out in 2 minutes - okay. At 50 minute mark, finally, we get service, and some ice tea and water refill.\n\n9. Apparently bread is reserved for certain people. We were never provided/offered/suggested any but again, noting other reviews, it's a draw. \n\n10.

The customer service as always is great here, this was my 2nd time dining here. We started out great with the sommelier recommending a great Chardonnay Stony Hill 2009. We placed our orders and the 1st course was the lobster bisque. Now I have eaten lots of lobster bisque in my time but when my 11 yr old states that it is too salty there is a big problem. Of course he was right both my wife and I tasted the same thing it was way over salted hence my reason for not giving 5 stars. However the tasty bread and the 2nd course/ entree made up for the soup. We all had the Salmon and Sea Bass Pillows which were Phenomenal. Then we followed that up with the 3rd course/dessert, 2 of us had the strawberry shortcake and 1 had the blueberry cheesecake.

A special request made at the start of the dinner was not forgotten but executed exactly as requested.\n\nCocktails were made promptly, correctly, and as requested. Prosecco served at a proper 45 degrees.  The star of the show was the busboy - water glasses full, bread replenished, not a crumb on the table cloth.

Make reservations and ask to be seated in the main dining room which features a high dome-shaped mosaic tiled ceiling which dates back to 1928.\n\nI've dined here twice now and both encounters were outstanding.\n\nThe bar features a mixologist who puts new spins on old fashioned drinks.\n\nOur service was impeccable, the food was supremely tasty, and our wines were a perfect match for our meals. The most notable wine we sampled was a 2011 Falanghina Marisa Cuomo Furore from the Amalfi Coast of Italy which reminded us of vanilla creme perfume with lavender.  Stellar white wine paired perfectly with our seafood.\n\nI've said this in another review and I'll say it again. At a restaurant like Farallon patrons are not buying a quantity of food. An experience is what is for sale here highlighted by preparation with focus on  flavors that compliment each other, and ultimately,  presentation of culinary skill as art. \n\nWe had the 6 pack sampler of oysters which varied in taste from mild to strong - all enjoyable.\n\nI went with a 3 course meal to include lemon scented asparagus, warm dungeness crab on a bed of truffled Yukon gold potato puree & butter accompanied by a touch of alaskan salmon caviar. The crab dish was served in a real sea shell and the combination of flavors was superb.\n\nFor an entree I went with the grilled scallops which pretty much dissolved in my mouth, no chewing required. Likewise, my wife had seared Mediterranean Branzino which proved equally tender.\n\nDessert was a confection perfection milk chocolate hibiscus mousse which included a  dark chocolate-zinfandel ice cream and candied kumquats.

It was a bit of a risk too, knowing my girlfriend was not the biggest seafood fan since she has never really been blown away by seafood meals. But she absolutely loved the food here and proclaimed it to be the best seafood she has tried. I have to agree, this was some top notch food. \n\nFor parking, we actually parked in the structure for the Westfield Mall, and after hanging out around Powell and Union Square for a bit just walked over to the restaurant.\n\nThe ambiance here was great. We were seated upstairs so it was rather romantic, but the ocean theme of the restaurant makes the place feel fun and not overly romantic as well (thank you jellyfish lamps). Our service started off great, but I have to dock some points since by the end of the meal our service was rather slow and our waitress seemed stoic and unhappy. Maybe she got some bad news mid-meal...not sure.\n\nWe decided to stray away from the prix fixe menu, and ended up ordering a lot of food. But the portion sizes were perfect for us to be full enough by the end of dinner so that we did not want dessert, but were still able to walk and not feel bloated. As a starter we ordered the grand platter, which included some of the freshest raw shellfish I have tried. The lobster was very juicy and fresh, and came with a champagne dip that complimented it nicely. The oysters and shrimp were also amazingly fresh and delicious. The crab was probably my favorite, though as far as shellfish goes.\n\nAs an appetizer we ordered the truffle linguini. The pasta was well cooked and not too hard or too soft. The truffles were a wonderful compliment to the pasta and its garlic sauce, and overall the dish tasted buttery but not too salty. My girlfriend and I really enjoyed this dish, and found ourselves using our bread to soak up any remaining sauce on the plate.\n\nOur entrees were the pan seared local petrale sole and the roasted Alaskan true cod. The sole came on top of a risotto and some melted leeks. The sole was perfectly cooked, crispy skin and a very light crisp on the top side of the fish, but soft, flaky and not too chewy otherwise. The risotto, though, was a little heavily salted and really needed the vegetables to be balanced out. The cod was also perfectly cooked like the sole, but had a weaker flavor overall than the sole did. However, the chowder that the cod rested on top of included some pancetta and corn, and complimented the fish a lot better than the risotto did with the sole. So overall, both dishes were delicious, and at this point I am just nitpicking. \n\nI only hope that the service is a little quicker next time, since our service was a bit slow. I definitely recommend Farallon to those who enjoy seafood and have some money to spend (the meal isn't exactly cheap but not unreasonable either).", "author": "Eric S."}

The Grand Platter (one lobster tail, two crab legs, 6 shrimp) was pretty good (crab legs especially) but was pricey at $65.  The Striped Bass was good (white bean side was very tasty) but the arctic char was a letdown.  The cocktails (Manhattan, $17 and Pinot Noir, $17) were good but overpriced.\n\nThe Service:  3.5 Stars - The Tale of Two Servers....\nDuring our wait for the table, we sat at a small lounge table and had a drink.

From the food to the ambiance to the staff, Farallon is just wonderful.\n\nThe decor of the restaurant is definitely unique. It resembles an underwater fantasy and the exquisite jellyfish hanging throughout the restaurant really help Farallon stand out. Even though the restaurant is not decorated in a modern style, Farallon exudes a classical feel and upon walking into Farallon, I was immediately immersed in a different world with the dim lighting and \"shell-like\" seating.\n\nFarallon has amazing seafood. The baby softshell crab is a must-try and if you like risotto, you're going to love the sweet white corn risotto. The lobster, scallops and salmon are tasty but if you like meat, the quality of the filet of beef matches the quality of Farallon's seafood. Finally, for dessert, I personally prefer the panna cotta but I have heard that the lime sorbet and chocolate bites are scrumptious as well.\n\nDefinitely try Farallon if you get the chance! Every dish comes out beautifully plated and the staff at the restaurant are more than friendly and nice. Farallon can become a little loud at dinner because of the number of people who dine there/business meetings that take place there so be a little prepared for that! However, this should only show how popular the place is. :) Oh - Farallon is conveniently located around Union Square so definitely park under Union Square if you choose to forego valet.\n\nI hope you enjoy Farallon as much as I do!", "author": "Erica J."}

She recommended the sliders, in which I was already going to order, nice.  \n\nThree of us ended up having one Hemingway Daiquiri - very good, three Old Cuban drinks - extremely awesome.  One order of Truffled Kennebeck Fries - pretty good and one order of Sterling Beef Sliders (2 tiny burgers & fries) - hella good.  Mom asked a question and bam, we were on a tour of the restaurant (it was slow) --- Fun Fact: The restaurant is above the Elks Club pool from 1925 still in use. --One good earthquake and your going swimming. \n\nHope you don't have a fear of jellyfish or empting out your wallet, it's worth it. \n\nAlready placed reservations for a dinner in December before Christmas.", "author": "Eric H."}

Nothing at all about our experience was really bad, but nothing really amazing enough to warrant the whopping bill at the end. The Yelp definition of \"Meh. I've experienced better\" seems pretty spot on.\n\nWalking into the restaurant I felt transported to Disneyland. I don't mean that as a bad thing -- the underwater theme made the place feel fun, though maybe a little bit cheesy. We ordered an assortment of oysters, soft shell crab, tartare for starters; lobster, branzino, salmon, halibut, and bass for entrees. The soft shell crab was yummy but tiny, but again, nobody was really blown away by their entrees (and yes! we love seafood!). \n\nWe did, however, really enjoy our desserts and the service was great. \n\nIn all, we chose the restaurant for the convenient location to celebrate and chow down after the movies; we probably won't return.", "author": "natalie n."}

Your really feel like you are under the sea.  It is fun to look around the restaurant and look at the cool lamps and mosaic ceiling. \n\nHowever, the food was very meh.  The restaurant was busy, but the food was just passable.  I started with the bisque and my boyfriend had the foie gras.  We both liked our starter, but he thought the accompaniments to the foie gras were unnecessary.  The other in out group had oysters which they enjoyed, but all of them seemed to be on the larger side which were not their preference, but were the smallest they had.\n\nTo finish we had the pork chop and the snapper.  Pork chop was on the dry side and snapper was well cooked but not so flavorful.  The gnocchi on the side was bland.\n\n\nWe had a fun meal here, but the food wasn't that great.", "author": "Katharine A."}

We had a reservation and were seated right away.The man I am assuming was the maitre de asked us what we wanted to drink. We told him water and we wanted to order wine, and asked for black napkins as we were wearing black. We waited quite some time for water. The sommelier, who was very knowledgeable, came over to tell us about the wines. We asked our waiter what he recommended and we did choose a couple of those. We chose the dry scallops and bone marrow with sea urchin apps. The dry scallops were sitting on something that looked and tasted like mud. Awful. The bread was not good, it was hard. They did something pretty with the butter, but the bread was so bad. For our main courses we chose scallops with green curry and sable fish. I liked the green curry dish a lot. It had a lovely bite to it, and the scallops were cooked to perfection, as well as the shrimp and sticky rice. The sablefish needed salt overall, but the items were cooked well. So the negatives to this restaurant was service. Why do we have to ask for water repeatedly? The whole napkin thing, they just handed us the black napkins. I've been in restaurants half as expensive that would automatically know if you are wearing black you need a black napkin and then place it in your lap. Then after I filled out the tip (generous) and wrote a note that we should not have to ask for water, and signed the $300 bill...the waiter picked it up! Service 101! Tacky. They apparently read the small note and started filling our water constantly. Awkward. The only person who spent 2 minutes with us was the sommelier, and on reflection, he could run a reality show called the jaded sommelier. The rest were distant, aloof, my daughter is reading over my shoulder and said snobby. As we were leaving there were a group of young people chatting at the hostess stand. They stopped ever so briefly to look at us, but said nothing. By comparison, other restaurants at every other meal we had besides Chinatown, which is a cultural difference, said 'thank you ladies' and 'have a great evening' etc.  I stopped and asked the young man up front who the manager was. I planned on maybe sending an email to tell him of our experience . Much to my surprise he said he was the manager. That actually made me quite angry. You turned and looked at me, and instead of saying 'Thank you for dining with us', you dismiss me? I gave him a bit of a what for. I wouldn't go back. I hate that that was our last meal on this trip to SF! If we wanted brusque service we could go to Chinatown and spend a fraction of what we spent here and had what we know is fabulous food. I do not recommend this place at all. I know my expectations were very high. The more I am spending the more I expect service wise. The three stars is food, so there you go.", "author": "Nancy P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-13", "description": "As part of our honeymoon coastal drive southwards, our stop in San Francisco brought promises of Sourdough, Clam Chowder, and most importantly extremely fresh seafood. The concierge at our hotel around the corner suggested and then made reservations for us at Farallon stating that it was some of the best in the area and that we should not miss it. I am glad we did not.\n\nFrankly, I'm confused by the negative reviews of this place. Was it pricey? Yes. Were the plates small? Yes, but not exceptionally so. Not unreasonably so. The plates were masterfully prepared and were like little works of art as far as I'm concerned. And this place had a lot to live up to. Only a couple days prior, we had dined at one of Seattle's finest, Altura, and it was quite literally the best meal of both my wife's and my life. This place took and easy second place for our entire trip and that's saying quite a lot. \n\nNow, we are foodies. We like food. We like eating food, we like talking food. We like everything about food. Our server (I think his name was Bill), was a real foodie too. We had a few questions about some of our dishes and he was so happy to indulge us. I'm pretty sure he went on for a full 2 minutes about where the tomatoes for the tomato salad came from and why they are so delicious. Now that might not be for everyone, but we were salivating with every word. So thanks Bill! You made it an extra special evening.\n\nWe started with some fresh local oysters, which I had never had before. Bill put me at ease and gave me some direction and made the whole experience much more enjoyable for me. They were delicious! What a great way to start things off. We continued with the Tomato salad, which was just as delicious as Bill described. And then moved on to the bisque. The bisque was the star of the whole night for me personally. It may have been the most decadent thing I have ever eaten--so rich, with such depth of flavor. Just incredible. My wife had salmon with an asian black bean sauce which was fantastic, cooked to perfection and I had Halibut, which was flaky and crispy and delicious. We finished the meal with chocolate mouse, goat cheese cheesecake, port and sherry which were paired to our desserts by the in-house somalier, which was a nice treat. They knew it was our honeymoon so they made it an extra special night for us. \n\nI honestly could not have asked for more out of my experience at Farallon and I hope to return one day soon. It was a pricey meal, for sure, but one that I will not soon forget.", "author": "Gabriel W."}

Service is negative stars. \n\nI came here for my graduation dinner with my parents and my boyfriend. My mom and I have been craving oysters and this place had a decent selection of oysters.  At first I was hesitant to book here because of the price range. My parents encouraged me to go for it since it was such a special occasion. \n\nUpon arriving the host completely butchers my name. I know it is Chinese, but can't you just call me by my last name if you really have no idea how to pronounce the first? Then he brings us to the wrong table because he obviously confused me with someone else. I say to myself, OK, bad start but the inside is pretty unique and ambiance seems right. \n\nAfter we were finally seated it took the waiter FOREVER to come by to serve us water. By that time we were ready to order and also hungry! He drops off the water, does not say a thing or make eye contact, and leaves.  It of course took another forever for him to come back to take our orders. My boyfriend hadn't arrived yet so my mom and I decided we would order two platters of oysters. One for us and one for when he is here.  The waiter was nice to give us recommendations but at the end I thought, why not have several of each kind and then order what we like the best for our second platter? Waiter was obviously NOT HAPPY that I rejected his idea and became very condescending all of a sudden and acted like we knew nothing about oysters. When he was taking the menu away my dad asked him to just leave one for when my boyfriend is here. It was so loud inside so my dad said it twice in case the waiter didn't hear. He turns to my dad and says in an annoyed tone, \"I know, I have worked in this industry for many years.\" At that point I was like WTF! Wow, I couldn't believe the kind of service we were getting. Then the waiter walked away but he left like 4 menus on my boyfriend's seat. I mean, what were we going to do with all those menus? We said one and he left us 4! Unbelievable! \n\nThe food was so so. One of the oysters tasted like soap. The fish was overcooked. Salad was meh. I was talking to my parents about the unbelievably bad service and my mom said, maybe he thinks we are the nouveau riche!

Our food was elegant and service friendly and attentive. This is a very pleasant restaurant in all respects. The impressive entrance into the \"Jellyfish Lounge\" is a nice touch with weird, jellyfish light fixtures; strange, but creative.\n\nMy only complaint is that our food portions were practically microscopic is size. I don't expect super-sized, Midwest diner portions in a upscale restaurant, but my delicious halibut main course was just a tease and should have been at least twice its tiny size. \n\nI started with the LAURA CHENEL CHEVRE TART which was good but not quite what I expected. My guest had the spinach salad which would have been a better choice and certainly more healthful than the somewhat too-rich tart. \n\nThe halibut was served on a bed of lentils and there were small carrot pieces and a few snap peas on the plate, too. It was a very fine dish but gone after too few forkfuls.\n\nI'd suggest ordering 3 courses as offered on the menu because unless you eat like a sparrow you'll leave here hungry. Would have been best if I'd added a pasta dish along with the other 2. Fortunately, a friendly person came by frequently to offer us bread which was fresh and much appreciated.\n\nTo summarize, Farallon is a fine restaurant and ideal for special occasions.

The only one to mention is the tuna very good the others OK.  Good thing we ordered 4 apps the main dish's are small and again ok. For the price and the reputation of finest seafood restaurant in San Fran it fell way short . Wouldn't go back. Price doesn't bother me  but it better be worth it and it by far was not worth it.", "author": "DR M."}

So my boyfriend decided to take me here for my birthday.\n\nThe hostess here was very sweet. I really wanted a picture with the jellyfish chandeliers, so she helped us take a picture right underneath it. \n\nThe food here was pretty good. I actually do not really like seafood but my boyfriend does, so I had some of his. We ordered Beausoleil oysters and they were okay. \n\nMy boyfriend and I had two courses each. I got seared rare hawaiian ahi tuna, and the petite filet of beef. While my boyfriend got the steamed price edward island mussel and  the striped bass.\n\nThe seared ahi tuna was pretty good but I didn't like the taste of the lentils that the tuna was on top of. It tasted okay when you eat it with the tuna, but not alone. I actually liked the mussels more... actually, the soup that came with the mussel. I don't really like the taste of mussel and I thought the soup have a strong mussel taste, but it didn't. \n\nMy filet of beef was really good, I loved it. It was really tender and cooked just the way I like it, medium rare. And the mash potatoes that came with it was delicious. The only thing that I did not like was the vegetable that came with it and the sauce under it.... I completely left that side alone after one taste.\n\nI tried some of my bf's striped bass and tortellini, and that was pretty good too. The tortellini skin was a bit thick, but my bf said it is suppose to be like that. The striped bass was okay, but I like my beef better.\n\nFor dessert, my boyfriend had banofee sundae and I got the bittersweet chocolate malt gateau. I thought the gateau was a bit too sweet, the texture was amazing, but it was too much chocolate. I actually like the banofee sundae more, it was delicious and not too sweet.

It was simply the best seafood dinner in my life. Every dish had an explosion flavor made with healthy proteins. I had the oysters, ahi tuna, crusted calamari, and ono. All the dishes were memorable and exciting.\n\nNOTE TO MANAGEMENT, and CAUTION TO FUTURE DINERS:\nThe Service we received was absolutely awful for the price point. It started right from the beginning when they forgot to note a very specific instruction made via telephone reservation. Unacceptable. It continued with a server that was absent for extended periods of time. To order another bottle of wine, I had to raise my hand like a child in school. We sat for 20 minutes before finally waiving someone over to order desert. I poured almost every glass of wine. Apologies were given multiple times for lengthy delays, but they somehow continued. I love a long, drawn out dinner, but the absolute lack of attention we received was severely disappointing.\n\n18% gratuity was automatically added to our party of 5. I hope this was not the reason that we received such terrible service.

Nope. At $18 for one scallop, I expect decent service and good food in the very least, and Farallon failed to deliver on both. \n\nMy BF and I are seafood lovers and couldn't wait to dig our greedy mitts into some of San Francisco Bay's finest. I had walked past Farallon on previous trips and knew my BF would be into the over-the-top undersea decor, so we checked out the menu online and were surprised to find so many good choices and daily specials. \n\nOur reservation was for 9:30 and we were sat rather quickly. Maybe it was because we had a last minute reservation, but they sorta shoved us in this small table in the \"clam room\" (doubt that is the official title, but I felt like I was eating inside the old submarine ride at Disneyland.) The main dining area was much more open and pleasant, and I was disappointed to be shoved in the little offshoot of the bar area ... but we were there for the food so we enjoyed what we could see of the amazing jellyfish lights and theme park decor. \n\nThings started off well with a fabulous amuse bouche sent over by the chef. A creamy goat cheese with tomatoes and onions. The first appetizer (heirloom tomatoes done three ways) was amazing and topped with a warm, creamy buratta that melted in my mouth.\n\nWe should have stopped there.\n\nThe next appetizer was a \"shrimp parfait\", which was essentially a bay shrimp cocktail with little flair or flavor. Definitely order something else. The BF and I had studied the menu well beforehand, and I was saving my appetite for the scallops. I LOVE scallops and agreed to share just one of them with the BF since this $18 entree was going to be my main meal. Well .... the scallops came out and to my surprise there was ONE scallop on a bed of indecipherable meat shreddings, that I assume were some sort of brisket ragu. Yes, ONE scallop. All I could really do was laugh at the absurdity of eating one scallop, and popped that plump little bugger in my mouth. Was it good? Yes, it was excellent.... but it would never order it again simply on principle. ONE scallop?\n\n\nThe next entree was a decently-prepared white fish that didn't wow or offend. Just average seafood fare.\n\n\nWe had debated ordering dessert, but at this point we were bout 2 hours into our meal and had spent at least 75% waiting for service. The service was slloooooww and not especially pleasant. It felt a bit like cafeteria service, \"What do you want?\"  and \"Here you go.\" To our servers credit, she had a heinous harpy of a customer right next to us. A wrinkled old bat who screeched at the waitress that she had been waiting \"5 WHOLE MINUTES\" for her coffee. It was understandable that our sever wasn't as chipper as she could be, but it didn't make up for the pace of the service. We actually sat for a full 20 minutes before anyone came to take our drink order.\n\nThe total bill was a little over $150 without tip, ad we left hungry. \n\nFarallon is nothing special and I felt like we totally got suckered into a tourist trap. It's prime location on Union Square probably lures in more than it's fair share of out of town fools ... I just hate that we were one of them. Skip Farallon and try the Mexican eats at Colibri up the street, or Lark Steak House on Market.", "author": "Maija G."}

The staff was clearly overwhelmed - understandable during the holiday season, but the rudeness was unforgivable.  It just spoiled the night.  We arrived at the same time as the 3 people beside us.  We all ordered at the same time, but their fries and oysters arrived within 5 minutes.  They were on their second order of oysters when our waitress was telling us our order would be ready soon (with quite a bit of exasperation in  her tone.)  We watched her go over an place the order - it was clear she'd forgotten.  A few minutes later a guy brings us a plate of oysters!?  When we said we were waiting for Fries not oysters he actually rolled his eyes!   I did not touch the fries when they finally arrived.  When we received the bill the waitress mumbled \"no charge for the fries\".  It was really disappointing because I love this place. It is hard to describe the bad energy and poor service in such a way that will help the reader understand why I will never go back.

During a recent business trip, my colleagues and I decided to spend our last night at Farallon where the unassuming storefront gives way to a pretty impressive and opulent interior that looks like was someone's mansion many, many years ago. We sat in the back room in the first floor and it looked like that was someone's indoor pool once upon a time.\n\nI didn't expect the courses to be large but I didn't understand why it took four hours to serve three courses to 8 people on what appeared to be an average Friday night. I started out with a scallop carpaccio, which was OK, it tasted like scallops but just sliced thinly so it just felt kinda gimmicky. Then came the ravioli and again, considering the amount of time it took and how many were in each serving, I have to assume the pastry chefs were hand-assembling the ravioli? I was drafting a Yelp review in my head until my third course came and that's when Farallon entered the gates of my taste buds' heaven.\n\nA pork chop, seared just a touch above rare with enough marbling to get a nice mouthful combination of meat and fat with each bite, flanked by sauerkraut and beets is bestowed upon me. How could I say 3 stars to what's likely one of the best porkchops I've ever had? For dessert, the apple and cheddar pie intrigued me but was underwhelmed as I did not feel it struck a good balance between sweet and savory.

And boy were we disappointed! \nFirst, the food. \nFor starters we ordered the poke appetizer. The chunks were very large- not small like typical poke- and the sauce was way too sweet. We opted to go with several a la carte entrees instead of the tasting menu. \nWe got the halibut, tuna and a trout trio dish. The halibut was decent, served over pork belly. It was moist and had a nice smoky flavor. The tuna was bland but edible.  The \"trout trio\" was horrible. It consisted of a raw, gelatinous fillet, a tough and chewy trout skin (leather laced with salt) and a half dozen tiny trout eggs. It was inedible. \nThe kids had pasta and fries. They took few bites and only ate the fries. Although, the fries came with some oddly flavored mayonnaise-type sauce that did not go over well with the kids. \nOn the positive side, our cocktails were quite good. \nThe service: Overall, it was just mediocre- not up to the standard one would expect from such an expensive place. \n\nThe water glasses came smelling like fish. Don't know if the glasses were dirty or they just decided to use the oyster shucking water for our drinking water. The waiter conveniently had allergies so couldn't confirm the smell- and didn't offer any assistance. We had to ask for butter for the bread. \n\nIn general, everything took much longer than it should've - especially since the restaurant wasn't that busy. \n\nWe decided to skip on dessert and went to North Beach for more but satisfying dinner.

My bf asked me where I wanted to go for my birthday dinner, and I chose Farallon.  It pains me to give a 2 star review but here goes.\n\nUpon arrival at the facade of the restaurant, we waited for the valet in one of the two lanes on Post St. who was no where in sight.  Since, there was no actual open space in front of the restaurant, we circled around once more not to idle on Post St. blocking traffic before calling to ask if there was an actual valet.  We were advised if we waited long enough on Post St. a valet would come to our aid.  So we gave it another shot.  They eventually rushed to park our car once several other patrons piled up behind us.\n\nOnce I entered the into the oceanic opulence of Farallon, I assumed the rest of my experience would be just as expected.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.  We were several minutes early for our dinner reservations and decided to marinate at the bar until our table was ready.  Two Grey Goose Dirty martinis please!  I was taken by surprise.  These dirty martinis consisted mostly of watered down olive juice.  How do you screw up a dirty martini?  Needless to say, we refused to order any more cocktails during the rest of our wait.\n\nEventually, we were led to our table which was next to the rail in front of the exposed kitchen.  As we were seated, a booth table to our left was vacant, and I asked the hostess if it was possible for us to be seated there instead.  She advised me that table was reserved.  Once we were seated, I expected four people to be seated in that booth.  However, only a white couple was seated.  I sat there pondering what the difference between their reservation and mine was.  I could only gather that either they paid extra money to be seated there or simply, we were an ethnic couple, and they weren't.  Nevertheless, this was a minor component of the conglomeration of disappointment to come.\n\nAdditionally, the adjacent table received bread and beverage before us!  (We asked for bread twice:  once to the server and the second time our requests were answered via the runner.)  Once, our bottle of wine arrived, I was mildly impressed when the wine director came to our table to discuss our wine.  (At this point, I had a glimmer of hope left for Farallon despite the sour taste of seating arrangements and initial service.)  As the night proceeded, our server was fairly attentive by removing our dishes full of shellfish discards and maintaining her affable personality.  We enjoyed  the Grand platter, baby spinach salad, caviar and grilled octopus.   At the end of our meal, she brought me a tiny dessert with a candle and \"Happy Birthday\" drizzled in chocolate syrup. I enjoyed the baby spinach salad with strawberries, thin radish slices and bits of parmesan.  I couldn't help but to be amused by Chef Franz's smile when he smiled catching me snapping pictures of his tasty culinary creations.  Undoubtedly, the experience at Farallon must never relate to his culinary skills.  His food is quite exquisite.  \n\nUnfortunately, I anticipated greater things here prior to my visit.  My visit did not satiate the fine dining standards as expected according to existing Yelp reviews.    My bf must have eaten a bad oyster or something on our Grand  Platter that evening.  He spewed it and everything else into the  porcelain god that evening, but I, luckily, evaded a similar misfortune.\n\nI did not expect Farallon to disappoint so much.  Unfortunately, I can't say I will return to be a glutton for further punishment.  $300 is too much to spend  and have an experience like this.  :(", "author": "Elizabeth S."}

He asked if we would like to move over to a bigger table and we agreed but he never offered to cover the cost of the spilled wine he dolled . He also never wiped or dried the seat area , they just sat someone else there 10 minutes later ?? We ordered a shellfish plater that was very average at best !

The undersea theme was really nice but it's hard to find parking at union square so it's best to be very early when you make your reservation.

Next time we'll skip the potato croquettes, which were pretty forgettable. Also really enjoyed the soup of the day -- seafood bisque, I believe. Great ambience as well (who doesn't like feeling like they're dining under the sea??). \n\nHad to take a couple stars off for the service -- our waitress seemed frustrated with us as we began to order (even though we had been nothing but patient as we waited several minutes for any of her attention once we were seated), and then, for some reason I have yet to figure out, walked off as we were still ordering. No, really -- I had just ordered some small plates and a drink, and then she left before my boyf had a chance to say or order anything! She returned a few minutes later with my drink and then continued taking our order as if her behavior was perfectly normal. Our bill was also higher than we expected because she'd added crab legs to our order; however, since we'd eaten them (we naively thought that they were part of the 1/2 lobster we'd ordered as well since they came on the same platter), we didn't say anything. \n\n...but all in all, this place is a solid destination for a full meal at (slightly high) happy hour prices.", "author": "Justine M."}

We ordered two salads (all of the salads come with some type of seafood but my son was able to get his without) and the venison. My oldest son ordered the butter lettuce and I ordered a kale salad, both the salads were just ok and on the small side. The venison was very good.

It is a perfect place to take a date, a important business client or, even have a fancy spoiled girl's night out.  So often, I go to nice restaurants and though I enjoy the meal, I feel letdown from the cost to worth comparison.  This is not true at Farallon.  There, you have your cake and eat it too (and yes - one should definitely order the carrot cake).\n\nDecor - how do you get a sophisticated, wacky and old tyme feel all at once?  I donno... but whoever decorated this place did the job.  It mostly gave me an elegant Poseidon under the sea feel but, then some random artwork kept me guessing. lol  All in all, it worked.  Maybe it was my mind of the night but, I even liked the 'conch shell' feel of our seats.  \n\nService - flawless.\n\nWine - extensive list.  I enjoyed our selection though we only got 2 individual glasses.\n\nFood - Excellent.  We started with the butter lettuce salad that they automatically split for us.  The green sauce dressing under the lettuce was delish and the orange slices were a perfect touch!  We went from there to our entrees... ahi tuna and striped bass.  Both were perfectly prepared and amazingly tasty.  I'd recommend the tuna if you'd like a lighter taste and the bass for a more savory palette.  We finished with the carrot cake... it was SO good.  The cake was most and packed with goodness and the cream cheese ice cream that accompanied it was weirdly good, I couldn't stop nibbling at it!\n\nThe portions were much healthier than expected which was a nice surprise.

We also ordered the Seared George's Bank Diver Scallop, NY strip steak and the striped bass. The steak and striped bass were fine, not impressive; the scallop was overly seasoned and the whole dish was so salty to a point that I could not take a second bite. So of course, I waited patiently for the server to check in with us on our food to see if I can have something else but I suppose our dinner reservation was too close to their closing time, everyone was rushing in the restaurant, running around. The next thing you know, someone came,\ntook our plates and started to wrap things up. I asked for our server and told\nhim that I am a little disappointed that my dish was overly seasoned and taken away, and all he had to say was 'I'll take it off the check'....right and what about the fact that I was still hungry?

And given your purported position at the top of the SF food scene, that's just not the expectation.\n\nWe started the evening waiting for our reservation for a few minutes in the bar. Our cocktails (at $12-13 each) were standard at best. I think a top notch restaurant would have creative, top notch bartenders to provide an intro to the evening ahead.\n\nWe were shown to our table on the 2nd floor by a very nice and efficient host (best employee interaction of the night). Sliding into the banquette covered with velvet while negotiating your way past the extra long tablecloth, without the whole table setup crashing down on you is challenging. When they do a refresh of the restaurant they should consider making the seats of the banquettes over with a pleather (or other slick) material. It would make seating, cleanup and cozying up to your tablemate a LOT easier.\n\nOur waiter was just odd. He tried to be helpful but just kept wandering off in the midst of discussion saying he had to take care of something or other. And I would expect waiters in this caliber of restaurant to be able to memorize an order for 2 people (it was 3 items total), rather than having to walk away again to get a pen and pad? Not sure if he was high or just not a great waiter - but it made for a very uneven service throughout.\n\nThe decor could use some updating. The covering of the columns upstairs looked a bit like a set for Disneyland circa 1990 and they had a shadow box on one wall filled with shells that looked like someone's DIY mom made it after returning from a beach vacation. Again, nice idea but odd execution for what is aiming for a lavish space. \n\nThe food itself was ok. We started with the iced shellfish platter (crab, lobster, oysters, shrimp). The flavor/freshness were good but the 1/2 lobster and the dungeness crab legs were pretty tiny as shellfish go. We followed up with a ling cod and a striped bass main dish.  The ling cod was very tasty, but was served on a pear(?) slurry that had a baby food texture that didn't pair well with the fish in my opinion. It would have been significantly improved with a broth-based sauce or even a light butter sauce. My SO did enjoy his bass quite a bit. The timing on delivery of the courses was also pretty uneven, with 20+ minutes prior to/between courses. I am all for having some time to sit, sip and chat but when folks at the table find themselves asking if there's a problem, then your kitchen is moving a tad too slow.\n\nI am SO sorry this review isn't full of accolades and fawning over the dinner and experience at Farallon - I really, REALLY wanted to love it, but sadly it just lacked too many things for me to run back.", "author": "Elizabeth E."}

Understandably making a reservation on a Sat. night for a party of 5 is difficult in the city on short notice. Farallon as always has an amazing ambiance. The decor it self will make you feel as if you have been transported strait to a scene of the little mermaid singing \"under the sea\". we should of stopped at the lounge taken a picture & left.\n\nYou would expect that a beautiful environment would create a beautiful experience from start to finish, this was not the case.\n\nOur reservation was for 8:30 pm Sat Feb 18. We sat in the lounge enjoyed some oysters & cocktails & were seated about 8:45 PM. The hostess forgot to bring our drinks to us & the server tried to double charge for the missing cocktails.\n\nOur table was upstairs next to the bathroom. The round table was far to large for the space it had been moved to. From the beginning we had to constantly move our seats to keep out of the way of traffic. \n\nOur server had about as much appreciation for great service & was as engaging as a piece of cardboard. I say this being a 10 year veteran of the service industry.  we were sat at 8:45 we did not see out main course until almost 10:30. the only app we order was oysters. I understand a kitchen can be in the weeds & orders can take awhile if the kitchen is backed up.\n\n I ordered the filet my boyfriend the lobster. My dish was presented cold & his was over cooked and resembled something out of the rubber family. We ordered a round of drinks (Grey Goose) soda lime ect. My boyfriends dad takes one sip and says(\"This isn't Grey Goose!) One can argue that you can not tell the difference between Vodka's. I & the whole liquor industry would beg to differ. We were served the wrong drink.\n\nAs you can see this was not the best experience. I would say the food is decent but not for the price point their serving it at.

I thought the place was a bit on the chilly side. \n\nThe waitress was really friendly and everytime we ordered something she said it was really good. I wonder if she just says that or they are indeed very good to her. \n\nWe ordered oysters. Two each of different kinds only to get two of one and only one of the other. The bf tried both and he said they both tasted the same. I figured as much. \n\nThe complementary bread came with butter with sea salt? on top. I liked the salt. The bread was alright. \n\nWe also got crab cakes to share. It was pretty good. I wished they gave more than two pieces of toast.\n\nWe also got a glass of fermented grape juice to share. It was realllly good. I normally don't like grape juice but this was sweet and not sour.\n\nI got the shrimp ontop of rice with green curry coconut sauce. The shrimp was good but I didn't like the sauce. I felt like I was in a Vietnamese restaurant. I don't like coconut but I also don't like fish which was ALL their other entrees. \n\nThe bf got some trout with mussels and garlic potatoes.

We know what we like and we didn't know if we'd have another opportunity to come back.

Cooked with the crust perfectly browned and I could've swam in the mushroom consumme of deliciousness.\n-GRILLED ALASKAN KING SALMON- There is something in the salmon.. like drugs, because it truly was the most amazing salmon we had ever had.\n\nSad to say, but just too much butter...\n-POACHED NANTUCKET BAY SCALLOPS- Early girl tomato fondue was more like super buttery tomato bisque.  A bit much.\n-1/4 OUNCE OF AMERICAN PADDLEFISH CAVIAR- caviar was delish!  The brioche it sat on was soaked in butter.   \n\nDESSERTS\nWe were tipped off not to skip on desserts and I have never seen such an extensive menu.  Two pages!  So how could we pass it up?  \n\nBUTTERSCOTCH PEACH SHORTCAKE  SUNDAE- Tasty, but did not like the buckwheat shortcake.  I should've known.  It was hard and tasted too healthy to be mixed with my butterscotch goodness.\n\nYOU MUST GET...\nBLUEBERRY PIE PIE- I know, it's pie.  But it's really amazing!  Why?  Not only are the blueberries so warm and round and the ice cream is so creamy, but get this... the pie is made of puff pastry!  Brilliant!  This was meant to be buttery.\n\nOverall, a delicious meal.  Would I go back?  Shockingly to just try happy hour.  The service was great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-12-18", "description": "So, admittedly, we went on a Monday night, which might not reflect the restaurant at its best.\nOn the other hand, I rate restaurants based on, \"Given the ingredients they used, could I have done better?\"\nI've never been formally trained, but I've been cooking for my family and friends for 35+ years now.\n\nThe staff was exemplary, as expected, as was the decor. The appetizers (a mushroom bisque, a shellfish bisque, ahi carpaccio, and a little gem salad) were all excellent. My only major initial complaint was my wine selection: I chose a light merlot, and it was fine on its own, but clashed horrifically with the acidity of the carpaccio and my salad. Considering the sommelier himself opened the wine for us, you'd think he would have warned me that my wine selection was poor. I don't appreciate a brown-nosing sommelier; I want someone who knows what the heck he's doing, and warns me when I've made a horrific choice (as I had).\n\nThe main course was the first disaster. My black sole was quite good (better than I could have made), but my wife's cod was out-and-out mediocre, and made significantly worse by the fact that they had clearly left it sitting while my sole was completed. To call her dish \"lukewarm\" when it was served would be generous. At the level of quality I would expect of a restaurant like Farallon, serving one diner's dish cold is utterly unacceptable. Similarly, the bacon-and-Brusssels-spouts side I ordered was quite good, easily as good as anything I produce in my kitchen, but my wife's truffle-and-cheese cauliflower was utterly overwhelmed by garlic. And I *like* garlic! There was no flavor beyond the garlic to be found in the dish.\n\nBy the time we ordered dessert, we were already thoroughly underwhelmed. The staff  was utterly impeccable, the decor was delightful to look upon, but the food had so far been worse than a dinner I could have cooked at home. \n\nDessert was another disappointment. I got the Devil's Food cake with cherries. I would have appreciated either a deep chocolate flavor or a cherry counterpoint to the chocolate there was. I got neither. My wife got the dessert riccotta. It was perfectly adequate, but nothing to make one's eye's widen.\n\nIn short, the staff and the decor were excellent (at least 4.5/5). The appetizers were good (another 4/5). The wine the sommelier approved was terrible (1/5). Dinner was mediocre to poor (2/5 at best). Dessert was another horrific disappointment (2/5). Given the reputation and the price point, I cannot in good conscience recommend Farallon to anyone who appreciates fine dining. There are too many places that are SOOOO much better at the same price point.", "author": "Joe G."}

We needed the Westin St. Francis valet to get us an early mid-week reservation. The restaurant was empty when we arrived and buzzing when we left.\n\nWhile I greatly enjoyed my meal, several factors kept Farallon from being a five-star experience.\n\nFirst, the highlights. Farallon's decor is magnificent, transforming a barrel vault into an opulent bathysphere of a dining room. The wine list is judicious. Most of the food is unimpeachable, and I especially enjoyed my entree of rare seared Oho. Desserts were excellent. I would be satisfied dining here for any occasion, and was especially pleased to be able to impress colleagues with my choice of dinner venue.\n\nBut there are some inconsistencies at Farallon. My martini was weak and not served in an icy glass. An appetizer of mushroom and truffle ravioli was merely adequate -- and, most unfortunately, featured exactly the same ingredients and flavor profile as the mushroom-and-truffle soup a muse bouche. Such an obvious sequencing flub should not take place at a fine restaurant with a nightly menu. A fine restaurant also should not take its orders out of place, resulting in every course served first to the wrong person. In fact, the service overall was mismatched to a restaurant that demands ties and pearls. Our waiter, though very attentive, was altogether too informal even for San Francisco, and we never met the floor manager.\n\nSince my favorite seafood fine dining spot is now closed (Aqua), I will likely seek out Farallon next year on a future San Francisco visit. Get a babysitter, bring your expense account, and enjoy a fine experience at Farallon.", "author": "Stephen F."}

My husband and I had our Christmas dinner here.\nWaiter was always in a great hurry, talking to us while holding dishes for other tables and standing sideways to the table or at a distance as if he is was half way here and half way on the way out to the other guests.   Diner kind of experience in service.  Rush, rush, rush. \nI had dungeness crab risotto.  It was an average risotto but not 'upscale seafood' that the restaurant clams to be.  A little too loose for my taste and missing a flavor that would bind it and differentiate it from any other risotto that I had elsewhere.  My main dish was grilled Tombo Tuna.   I do not like totally raw tuna seared for 30 sec on each side, and that is what I told the waiter.  I asked if the chef can hold it on a grill a bit longer to sear a little deeper, so I still have a raw inside but less of it.  My tuna was easily two inches thick and thoroughly cooked to the very middle of it.  White all the way though.   They called it medium rear.  There was not a millimeter of rear meat in it.  In a good restaurant a chef knows what a guest means when they ask for a little more grill but still raw in the middle, especially that it was such a thick chunk of meat.   I guess they tired to teach me a lesson.   My husband had Alaskan cod and he said it was OK but so to speak, nothing to write home about.   The vegetables that came with cod were OK, just potatoes.  I did not get an impression that I am in one of the best sea food restaurants.   \nTo prove their tackiness they added a tip to our bill for two people. \nIn overall it was an unpleasant experience because of the shabby service and average food.  \nIn the last 150 days I ate at about 210 restaurants (I travel a lot) so I do know an excellent restaurant with good properly cooked food from a shabby pretentious restaurant.", "author": "Julia Y."}

The interior is expansive and I really liked the unique balance between a modern and \"Fisherman's Wharf\" feel.  The sashimi trio that I had was very fresh (I wish I could remember which fishes it consisted of!) and all of my friends enjoyed their seafood dishes.  \n\nWhat really stood was the sommelier's wine recommendations for the evening.  We had the 2006 Hartford Zinfandel and 2005 Robert Sinsky Merlot.  The Hartford was and continues to be the best Zinfandel I've had BY FAR.  It has an intense, yet balanced fruity character that just engulfs your taste buds and lingers oh so pleasantly after each sip.  The Merlot was also very good with just the right balance of tannins.  \n\nIt was a thoroughly enjoyable meal and I'll have to come back again sometime for further wine recommendations!", "author": "Eric F."}

The ambiance and fruites de mar grand platter were the highlights for me. I loved the underwater theme, I almost felt like I was in a sophisticated Little Mermaid movie. There were jellyfish lights hanging from the ceiling and booths that looked like shells and coral - though it may sound cheesy it was far from.\n\nBecause Farallon is known for its seafood we decided to start off our meal with the Fruites De Mar Grand platter (oysters, shrimp, crab legs, lobster claw) - 2 of us finished off the whole platter and could have easily eaten more it was so tasty. More legs and claws please! The seafood on ice comes in 2 size portions, the Grand which is what we got and the Royal which is meant for 4, each has a side of onion sauce and butter. \n\nFor a nice restaurant the Farallon had pretty big portions. I got halibut with chantrelles and an arugula salad with lemon vinaigrette. My favorite part of the fish was the crispy top crust, yum, and it went great with the mushrooms that had a subtle sweet flavor. I'm a huge fan of arugula so I scarfed that down right away. My aunt and uncle got stuffed lobster (the lobster meat was removed mixed with veggies and a sauce and stuffed back in its shell) and a beef dish (my uncle was having some seafood allergies so he opted for this plate which was 1 of 2 non-seafood items on the menu) - both seemed happy with their entrees.

Thanks to the yelp reviews knew they had a special happy hour menu at the bar.  They said our table was ready but I wanted to take advantage of the discounted prices at the bar as I knew we would be dropping serious coin.    Started with the crabcakes and fried oyster.  While the crabcakes had very little filler, it was overshadowed by the cornmeal crust.  Husband summed it up, \"hushpuppies.\" That said, the fried oyster on top a spoonful of lobster was pretty tasty along with a south beach mojito that was the best mojito I have ever had.\n\nOnto the dining experience....the sommelier was very impressive in that he had two different years for the wine we ordered and he brought out both years to ask which one we wanted.  Most would pawn off the one they thought they needed to dispose of first...so that was a nice touch.  We started with the grand seafood platter - straightforward fresh chilled seafood - the jumbo prawns were the best.  \n\nBut what really stood out was the thai snapper.  Wow!!  There were about 6 flavors going on but they were all subtle and it all worked.   Portions are pretty good size here too.

But my recent trip on 11/10/14 made me think twice about this place.\n\nIt was my mothers birthday and decided to make the trip to SF and enjoy a nice dinner at Farrallon. We were greeted and seated immediately. Our server was outstanding and we ordered several things. 2.5 stars for service and accuracy.\n\nThe bad; I get places need to change menus around to have fresh ideas but maybe it was the time of year or I just ordered the wrong thing. The menu itself was limited and the choices did not look or sound very appealing.  The appetizers were also in the bland category as well. My father and I ordered the shellfish bisque and what a terrible bowl of flavorless soup that was.  The presentation and look was awful a brownish yellow color. It tasted pretty much like buttered crab and shrimp shells, I do not recommend it, the worst part about it was the gas it gave afterward, yikes!! My girlfriend order beef carpaccio and had to stop eating it because it didn't taste right to her (she's a big carpaccio fan). I ended up ordering the spearfish because nothing else looked appealing, other items were tuna, lobster, fried pork, cod and one other item I can't think of. The spearfish did not taste very good, it was more tough than I anticipated and can not recommend to anyone. I had my sights set on something simple like salmon and was let down that they didn't offer it, but sure enough they had cod and was shocked they didn't have catfish (sarcasm).\n\nNow since I work in the food and beverage industry I normally won't bitch to the waiter about how bad something is and rarely send stuff back, I take my punches and avoid going back.

Reason why I'm just giving two stars is because of their portion sizes.  \n\nTotal bill was approx $300 for a five course meal for two people.  I walked out of there still feeling hungry... as if all I've had was just an appetizer.  \n\nFirst two courses were tartare and scallops.  2-3 bites of tartare and a single scallop... Both were great and i figured these two to be the beginning appetizer type of courses so the fact that they were both real small wasn't a problem.  The main courses should be better right? wrong.\n\nThird course was called \"Warm Maine Lobster\".  What I was expecting was a lobster tail.  What came out was a plate with two very small pieces of ravioli. On top of it was about 3 TINY TINY shreds of lobster.  It's as if they took a single lobster tail and told themselves that with that one tail they would make that dish for everybody that ordered that same dish that night at the restaurant.\n\nFourth course was filet mignon.  I figured since all the other courses were disappointing in size.  This main course had to be a decent size so that we wouldn't walk out hungry.  Boy was I wrong.  When my plate came out, what was on there was a 2 OZ sized piece of filet mignon. Tasted great but I finished it in about 2-3 bites.  Geez... How much more would it of costed them to give us a decent sized piece of meat??  This is a $300 dinner!!!\n\nFifth course was desert, which actually was a decent size.  The biggest dish out of all 5.  I normally just take a few bites out of dessert since I'd be full from dinner already.  However, I was still so hungry i finished the whole thing.\n\nNow I'm not the type that takes a whole lot of food to fill up.  I'd say I'm about average.  A 6 oz pc of steak with a side of mash potatoes would normally suffice.  Had the portion sizes been decent I probably would have given this place 4-5 stars.

But I'm really glad to got to experience it at least once.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is sooooo cool! There are arches and domes and cool light fixtures (some shaped like sea urchins, some like jelly fish) and ocean-themed mosaics everywhere!\n\nHere's what we had:\n\nFIRST COURSE: My friend ordered the \"Hawaiian Hand Line Caught Ahi Tuna Tartare\" (with \"hickory smoked hearts of palm, roasted asian pears, [and] toasted sesame seeds\"). I ordered the comparatively tame \"Star Route Farms Mixed Lettuces\" (with \"sierra beauty apples, toasted pistachios, [and] cider-whole grain mustard vinaigrette\"). We each tried a bit of the other's dish, but I'm not a big fan of raw fish and my friend's not real big on salad, so we mostly stuck to our own orders for the first course.\n\nSECOND COURSE: My friend ordered the \"Mediterranean Shellfish Bisque\" (with cognac chantilly, chives, [and] extra virgin olive oil\"), which she didn't really care for. She said it was sort of dull, that she couldn't taste any \"edges\" to the flavors, that it was sort of a mishmash of different fishes that resulted in a muddled flavor. I ordered the \"Champagne Poached Nantucket Bay Scallops\" (with \"celery root flan, petite sierra beauty apple salad, [and] cara cara orange fondue\"), and my friend and I both wondered what in the world \"cara cara orange fondue\" might be. To be honest, I don't even remember what it looked like or tasted like, because I was more focused on the scallops, which were delicious. The flan was just kind of bland and mushy. The apple salad, however, was terrific.\n\nTHIRD COURSE: My friend and I were both torn between the same two dishes, so we just ordered both and split each in half and shared them equally. We ordered the \"Grilled Sacramento Delta Sturgeon\" (with \"artichoke heart puree, balsamic glazed brussel sprouts, [and] brown butter hollandaise\") and the \"Grilled Creekstone Farms Petite Filet of Beef\" (with \"olive oil crushed new potatoes, crisp parsnips, roasted cipollini onions, [and] red wine jus\"). The real winner (with both of us) of this course, though, was the crushed new potatoes. They were an interesting consistency -- not quite mashed, not quite diced -- which we both really liked.\n\nDESSERT: Again, we were both torn between the same two options, so we shared them equally. We ordered the \"Gingerbread Caramel Apple Sundae\" (with \"vanilla bean ice cream, Aspall cider caramel sauce, gingerbread, [and] roasted Sierra Beauty apples\") and the \"Sticky Toffee Pudding\" (with \"banana-date ice cream, candied kumquats, [and] eggnog creme anglaise\"). Both were wonderful, but the banana-date ice cream was a favorite for both of us, though we disagreed on the candied kumquats. My friend liked them, but I thought they were a kind of disturbing chewy texture that didn't go well with the rest of the sticky toffee pudding dessert elements. \n\nThe presentation of every dish was truly stunning, just beautiful, which we both appreciated.

Makes me feel like I'm walking into a theme park rather than a fine dining establishment.  The service was great.  They were knowledgeable about the menu, very attentive but never made us feel rushed.  \n\nThe food was not that impressive.  We started with the dungeness crab, which unless its gone bad you can't go wrong.  I liked the fact that they provided additional utensils to help extract the crab meat.  For main entrees we got the dorade and branzino, Both fish on their own were excellent and well prepared, but they were overwhelmed by the accompaniments.  The sauce de poisson served with the dorade was all you could taste, and the crab and bacon hash served with the branzino seemed pointless since all you end up tasting is bacon.\n\nComing from out of town this is not someplace that I would put on a list of must visit.", "author": "Christina K."}

They thought they were being classy, but their gesture could have resulted in us just having to turn it away. Another glass of the wine we were already drinking would have been a much better gesture.\n\n9) Finally, when the bill came there were two extra desserts on the bill, totaling four desserts, for a table of two... just sayin...\n\n10) Throughout the server was either absent, distracted and not very apologetic...\n\nOn top of it all, the food was not the great, for a meal that cost $250, my mother and I should have left dazzeled..

We started with the seafood platter which had crab legs, half a lobster, shrimp and oysters; delicious but pricey.  My main was a moonfish which I wanted to try for the first time.

I had called ahead to request a table in the pool room & got stuck upstairs in an alleyway banquette, staring at the back of people's heads - yeah nice \"decor.\" thanks uglier-version-of-anna-wintour hostess. Are the menus THAT dirty that you are so compelled to wipe them down like it's a religion, while ignored patrons pile in aimlessly? No one appreciates your simpering sweet \"eye\" smile. Quit wiping and start greeting and seating. We got to watch the servers kiss a table of the chef's friends butts while we were ignored the entire night. Here are the major complaints:\n--Drinks took 30 minutes, placing our order another 15 minutes on top of that, \n--had to ask twice for a second round of drinks, \n--no amuse bouche as we watched the \"special\" table of 6 get served their amuse by 4 servers, and finally\n--our entrees came out 2hours and 20mins after we sat down and we only had one other course!! AND as expected on a night with such terrible service, when our food finally came out it was COLD. \n\nDid I mention it was supposed to be a birthday celebration? What makes it more maddening is that two tables who sat after us got their food before we did. \n\nOur server was a sweaty, uncomfortably awkward mess. \n\nThe food was OK, nothing great. Duck first course was overly sweet. The spinach salad at least had some good stilton in it. The tombo tuna was cooked well and was very fresh however the supporting side dish of lentils and beets was bland. The filet mignon was also cooked well but like I said, COLD. No offer of dessert. Nothing but a nervous stare once we asked for our check - yeah dude, we ARE pissed. It's not the first time we've been here but it was our last.

Both very tasty dishes.  The corn stuffed tortellini was different then what we are normally used to.  For our third entree my partner had the halibut and I had the Hawaiian Ono.  The ono was cooked like Ahi tun, rare on the inside.  Both of the fish dishes had very good flavor.  The Ono not as tasty as Roy's but almost there.  \n\nFor desert my partner opted for the Baked Alaska and I went with the Strawberry Buckwheat Shortcake.

I like that it is fancy but not pretentious, like some other expensive seafood joints in SF (Ame). You can get away with wearing simply a t-shirt & jeans or go all out with a suit & tie. Pretty much anything goes at Farallon. \n\nMy hubby & I went for our anniversary on Monday night (13 years thankyouverymuch!) & also to celebrate my new job. Since I hadn't dined here in years, I was worried that maybe it wouldn't be as good as I remembered. I am happy to report that it is still an incredible dining experience. \n\nWe went all out & ordered 5 courses. I know that's the norm in these restaurants, but really, when was the last time I had a 5 course meal? I can't even remember. We started with a dozen oysters. I like that they give you a list with the name of each oyster. I never remember them anyway, but it was a nice touch nonetheless. \n\n2nd course: Little gems salad. This was one of my faves of the night. A small, simple salad with sliced radishes & the most delicious smoked trout. I tried to savor every bite & vowed I would order this for dessert (can you do that?). My hubby had the Summer Melon Salad which was totally unexpected. Chopped up pieces of honeydew topped with a sorbet-like lemon ice on top. On the side were thinly sliced pieces of duck prosciutto. Fan-cy! \n\n3rd course: Braised octopus. I have to say this was a bit of a disappointment, only because I am an octopus fanatic & have been spoiled by the octopus they serve in Greece. This dish was slightly overcooked and of course, the portions were small. I would have liked to have seen multiple tentacles on my plate instead of just one, but I'll just have to wait until I go to Greece in a few weeks. As I said, I'm spoiled. \n\n4th course: Maryland striped bass & Petite filet of beef. I was thoroughly enjoying my fish when my hubby offered me a bite of his filet. O-M-G, I forgot all about my dish. That beef was amazing, and I don't even like beef. My hubby said that was the best filet he had ever had in his life. In a seafood restaurant! Maybe I should order the filet for dessert? \n\n5th course: OK, I went with actual dessert. Of course I had almost no room in my tummy for it but when you decide to go all out on a meal, you can't stop short at dessert. I ordered the Blackberry peach pie & coffee (decaf please, I don't want to be up all night). The coffee guy was cute & kept kidding that he was going to give me regular. Anyway the dessert was also amazing & was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.  I practically rolled out of that place. \n\nIf I were rich, I would eat at Farallon every night of my life.", "author": "Erin S."}

I ordered 3 types 1 was outstanding, 1 was mediocre and 1 I though was old and I might get sick from. I had the soft shell crab appetizer which was small and flavorless.

Courses:  foie gras, shellfish bisque, grilled dorade with house-made linguine, tuna tartare, maine lobster with sweet bread, and petit filet of beef.\nLocation:  Near the heart of Union Square. Beautiful interior, Parking is a headache especially on a rainy day. Valet: $12.00...darn pricey!  If you can arrive earlier and circle for parking, do it and save yourself the money and get a cocktail. ;)\nTotal incl gratuity: $426.00\n\nThis was certainly a good choice for New Years Eve.  The restaurant is beautiful, service is good, and food is memorable.  We came here to end 2010 with good company and good food.  It was a little pricier than we expected; it was NYE so they had special prix fixed menus.  The oysters we had were fresh - the three we chose were very good.  My favorite would still be the kumamoto.  The dungeness crab was also fresh.  The meat came right out but my only disappointment was the size - it was quite small.  I was pleased with my three course meal.  The foie gras was so delish!  It is a huge round of pate.  They give you three pieces of toasted brioche to go with it and it is not enough.  Our waitress Leila read my mind when she came by our table and saw we were brioche-less with more than half the foie gras left so she ordered some fresh ones for us.  If you like foie gras, this dish is a must order!  I enjoyed my shellfish bisque although it was a bit rich.  I think it pushed me over the edge and I was so full by the time I got to my third course, which was a shame because I felt like I couldn't fully enjoy it.  I had ordered the dorade and it was grilled to perfection.  the fish was moist and the flavor was very good..like a moist saba.  We, unfortunately, had to rush through the last half of our meal since we had to hurry over to another party.  All in all, our experience definitely got two thumbs up.  I'd love to return for more food and of course their foie gras.", "author": "Jess C."}

When I walked in I was amazed, it was beautiful with a killer seafood / under the ocean theme. The seafood (crabs, lobsters & oysters) by the cook's station looked amazing as well. I was psyched for an killer time with a terrific meal. \n\nWell the first thing you should do is if you have a babysitter watching the kids, tell them you'll be an hour late. The service was super slow. A 3 course meal took 2 hours. The Atlantic Salmon Salad was nice. Not terrific, but worth a try. It kind of reminded me of a plate of lox with some special seafood spread. The meal was OK. I had the Sea Bass. The skin was too thick and a little overcooked. After I peeled it away, the meat of the fish was a little better than average. The best part was the dessert. I was really impressed with booth the Hazelnut Pear tart (see the picture of the pear on the tan tart) and the Chocolate \"something\". Both were delicious! \n\nI would give this place 4 stars if the service was better. I would give it another star if the meal was much better. Overall, the 3 stars was for theme more than anything else. \n\nEnjoy.", "author": "Andy G."}

I generally have the stomach to handle fatty foods (especially foie gras, which I love!) but it just didn't want to take it.\n\nFor my other dinner companions, all of whom are HUGE foodies, the food was just okay. Not really worth the price. One ordered the scallops as the main dish and halfway died of starvation. One ordered the special dessert (I think it was a rum cake, kumquats and banana ice cream?)

Someone called to confirm the day before and requested a callback... then I knew they meant business!\n\nThe parking situation is tough since you're right next to Union Square but since it was the weekend and after 6pm we lucked out on street parking. They do have Valet. \n\nBeautiful decor and they seated us immediately. It has a very cozy feel but still upscale. I'd like to know if there's a story behind the faded tile look to the ceilings. The kitchen is out in view of most tables which I like - adds to the anticipation. \n\nThe waitress was very knowledgeable and energetic. We had the following:\n\n- Sweet corn and shellfish bisque - I'm a sucker for bisques esp the creamy velvety ones and this was no exception! Just delicious!\n- Shared the Prince Edward Island mussels - took a bit long to come out but I think it's part of the experience as the menu is set up to enjoy 3 courses. So don't come to dine in a hurry!\n- My companion had the prawn and scallop quenelles - kinda like a poached seafood dumpling without the shell if you had to equate it with a Chinese food item. Topped with fried matsutake mushrooms which added nice texture but I just didn't like the feel of the quenelle - it's a personal preference thing. \n\nFor entrees, we both had the Pan Roasted Mediterranean Branzino which is a light flakey white fish and the skin was left on and pan roasted to crispy perfection. The celery root puree was silky smooth. I was surprised at the nice personal touch of the Chef de cuisine coming out to present the entree to you. \n\nThey made note of the special occasion and were nice enough to remember.

We both enjoyed our dinners very much. I had an all seafood meal including:  a blue point raw oyster on the half shell (the best!), a half dungeness crab on ice, and diver scallops. The raw oyster was my favorite! It's unfortunate I only had one. I highly advise avoiding the crab if you don't want to get messy. This dish required a lot of work. I made a mess and had to get a fresh napkin afterwards. I also indulged in my friend's bittersweet chocolate malt gateau which was amazing! It tasted like the malt whopper candies, but much more decadent.\n\nThe service was amazing and timely. Our server was very helpful in helping me decide on which oyster to order (they have quite the selection) and was necessary when I had no idea what the difference was.

Ok, moving onto the food.\n\nDelciious, fresh, and new ways to have seafood!  We opted on the 5-course tasting menu.....SPLURGE! LIVE A LITTLE! these are the words of encouragement I said to myself as I reasoned that I should spend the money I can't afford....WE ALL NEED TO EAT, I said, with trepidation...this better be good.\n\nAnd it was. The tuna tartare was a new take on the concept, with smokey hearts of palm and asian pear. The crab thighs with rouget was delicious. The sweetbreads and lobster was OK...but too many beans and I am just not a sweetbread person. Next up, the filet....and at a seafood restaurant you probably wouldn't order meat, but let me tell you, it was some of the best cooked meat I've ever had....with an amazing broth and handmade mushroom raviolis that I could of eaten 20 more of.  Amazing, the best part of the night by far. \n\nOur server was really cool and brought us 2 different desserts to try. By this point we were pretty stuffed but I remember liking them both.

Made a reservation through OpenTable while standing out front and went to the bar.  We were seated about 20 minutes later in a round banquette in the main room.  Beautiful, beautiful place to eat.  \nTook a loooong time for our server to take drink orders, etc-about 15 minutes.  That's long past my normal 'get up and find someone or walk out' limit, but the atmosphere was nice and it was pissing down rain outside.\nDrinks finally came and orders were taken.  Two of us went with a Mediterranean Shellfish Bisque and a cast-iron baked Alaskan Bass for our entrees.  G had a beet salad and the bass, and JJ had the Alaskan True Cod.  Hers was probably the best, but it was close.  Really, every bit of the food was delicious, even the halfshell oysters at $3.50 a pop.  \nThe only downer was service-our server, while knowledgeable about the menu, etc., was scatterbrained, bringing the wrong foods, forgetting parts of the order, and generally making excuses to us, as well as his other tables.  The busser had some kind of creepy thing after my 16-year old daughter and would hover and then disappear for several minutes.  At one point, he stood behind me and refilled my iced tea every time I took a sip...\nSo, 90 minutes and $375 later, I was happy with the flavor and presentation of the food, but somewhat less than impressed with the service.  \nIf you go, don't sit in the section served by the guy who looks like an older David Carradine and you'll be fine.

The menu has been recently restructured so that they want you to order at least three courses to get a meal and that's not counting dessert. This is less than 90 days old. \n\nFor my first course, I had a shrimp parfait that was very tasty. My second course was scallops. Ooops. I mean it was a single (non-giant) scallop. Good, but not really enough. My third course was a striped bass. The piece of fish was about half the size of my cellphone. Tasty, but not really enough. After three courses, I was still hungry and ordered the three cheese plate for dessert. That was delicious and filled me up. My point, however, is that after three courses, I was still hungry. At this price point, I don't buy it. \n\nMy dining companion had a worse experience. At least mine was all good. His first course, a few slices of paper-thin sashimi, was overly smokey. His second course, gnocchi, was rubbery. His main of coconut curry shrimp was excellent. And the mini-sundae he had for dessert was good as well. \n\nService was professional as it always has been before.\n\nAmbiance depends heavily on which part of the restaurant you are seated in.

Nathan, our server, was excellent as well. I started with the prawns which were more like (4) 25/30 shrimp, which is small for those who don't buy shrimp. Unfortunately, a little bland and not worth $19. My wife started with the Buratta and heirloom tomatoes, which she loved. \n\nMy second course was much better than the first (sweet corn risotto). My wife had the scallop with polenta (I insisted we share as hers was as good as mine). \n\nMain course: she went light with the chilled half Dungeness crab while I had the pan-seared sole. I was so glad that I took Nathan's suggestion on the Sole. It was seared well with a nice crisp served over corn pur\u00e9e and a tomato vinaigrette which added a nice acidic hit to the dish. Bacon kept the sweetness from the corn in check. It was a fabulously balanced dish, which I highly recommend. \n\nWe finished off with the blueberry pie and the triple-chocolate budino. I loved the cocoa nib ice cream. You must eat this first as it lost flavor after eating the budino & chocolate creme (bittersweet and delicious), so heads up. \n\nWhile the meal started rather weak with the \"prawns\", I quickly forgot about it with each course.

Our recent visit continued to prove worthy of my first impressions.  \n\nThere simply is not a more lovely atmosphere in which to dine on fine seafood than this room.  It feels as though one were transported onto Jules Verne's Nautilus deep in the sea.  I find it peaceful and very inviting which is always a nice way to start a good meal. \n\nI've never had a bad thing to eat here period.  So I won't go into a lot of detail about the menu specifics.  The food is very good, very fresh and always well presented.  No disappointments ever. \n\nI will comment on their service.  This is one area in which they have always excelled.  Several years ago a date and I spent a lazy three hour lunch here.  The kitchen sent us an uneven number of oysters.  Only 17 not the 18 we had requested.  My date exclaimed to the waiter it would simply ruin our \"marriage\" if we were to become uneven.  He chuckled, winked and said he would be right back.  Next thing we know the chef himself is at the table, 7 oysters on a plate with a personal apology and his best wishes for our continued love.  Yes it was tongue in cheek, but a lovely and gracious gesture I have never forgotten.  It's a rare to thing to say that on many subsequent experiences I've found the same spirit of service to be present each time.  Always relaxed, efficient, well spoken and polite.  It's such a rare thing these days.  \n\nYes, it's a Union Square, tourist, expense account restaurant; and yet still quite unique, welcoming and delicious.  It's absolutely worth a visit if for no other reason than to say you've dined 20,000 leagues under the sea beneath glowing jellyfish.", "author": "Russell D."}

I didn't think there was any distinct difference between 2nd and 3rd course, so I'm going to suspect that's a marketing scheme, albeit they all taste pretty good. \n\nOne thing I also didn't really dig was the halibut, it had fried seaweed slices on top for seasoning, which did not come out to be nice and crispy in my mouth, thank god the chef didn't over do it. The fish its self was nicely cooked and that saved the dish.\n\nSmall things like that along with the cheesy \"under the sea\" decor eventually took away the 5th star.

I put this place just below my favorite restaurant, Gary Danko if that says anything.  I have been to Farallon about 6-10 times.  Every time I go it is the same quality of food just a different menu.    The menu is broken out into three courses.  I usually get one in each section. Last night I had the beat salad (which was perfect), Butternut squash Ravioli (very delightful), and the Sea Bass (so much flavor that i know it had to be a calorie bomb but worth it).  I also always start off with their fresh oysters.  They are amazing!!!  The desserts are also worth the calories...I had the Chocolate Napoleon with a cup of their fantastic coffee.  Now you would think I was a huge, fat slob for ordering that much food but the portions are just perfect so I left pleasantly full.  I am only 175 and I don't eat a lot I promise. \n\nMy Tips:\n\n1. Reservations are a must!  Quality = People.  It is also located in Union Square so the tourists seem to make their way here too. \n2. Use the valet.  They only charge $12.  It is a long meal so no matter where you park you will spend more at that lot then here.  Although the lot by Macy's may be cheaper.\n3. You will spend money.  Average tab is $120 per person with wine.  Be prepared but know that it is worth it...you are worth it damn it.\n4. Ask for Luke the sommelier.  He is awesome and knows his wine!\n5.  It is a long paced out meal.  Relax and enjoy.  However that does mean you should like the people you are with.  First Dates...mother-in-laws that you don't get along with, etc. should be avoided.\n6.  Ask for the corner booth in the back if it is available.  The restaurant can get loud so if you really like the company you are with this is the best table to be able to chat with them at.

As someone with several years of restaurant experience (in both the back and front of the house) I'm a stickler for service (and willing to tip extra for good service).\n\nI had the chef's tasting menu with the wine pairing.  My wife chose from the rest of the menu.  I've tried to remember everything, but sometimes it was difficult to hear and/or remember everything exactly.\n\nWe were brought an amuse-bouche which was a spoon of a \"soup\" of some sort made from snap-peas.  It was perfect size for an amuse-bouche and was delicious.\n\nFor the first course, I was served lobster atop a pea risotto garnished with some edible flower petals.  My wife had 3 of the fresh oysters on the half shell.  My course was served with a glass of Taittinger champagne.  My course was very good, although I wasn't happy with the champagne (can't blame them for that, I don't like champagne to begin with.  My wife finished it and reported that it was wonderful).  The oysters were very fresh and tasty.\n\nThe second course was black cod.  I can't remember the exact preparation except that it had bacon and was delicious.  It was served with a \"french chardonnay\" (I'm presuming Burgundy, but he didn't say that) that went nicely with the fish.  (My wife had nothing with my second course)\n\nThe third course was artic char.  It was charbroiled and served over a bed of black legumes.  The char was served with a Pinot Noir described as from \"the Sonoma Valley\".  I didn't recognize it (I grew up in the valley) and had to look it up.  It was actually a Skewis Pinot from the North Coast.  Nevertheless, it was delicious.  I was **extremely** satisfied with this course, being that arctic char is one of my favorite fish and the wine was so wonderful.  My wife had the cornmeal fried squid (which was served on the same risotto as my lobster.  The squid was perfectly cooked and very tasty.\n\nThe fourth course was a filet of beef served with a Corison Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley).  Somehow, I thought the server told me it was 4 ounces, but there's no way the small serving (delicious, BTW) was 4 ounces.  My wife had the halibut, which was sizable (ordered off menu) and perfectly cooked.  She was so happy with it, it was the one thing I didn't taste!\n\nThen came the cheese course, which was a Wisconsin cheese called \"Marisa\" (not sure, that's what I think I heard).  It was served with a piece of walnut bread and a candied green tomato.  The cheese was described as similar to pecorino, but I found that it was a little softer and creamier, with a great level of saltiness that totally complimented the green tomato and walnut bread!\n\nWe then ordered dessert.  My chef's menu dessert was a creme brulee with a sweet wine whose name I didn't catch (sounded like \"taiko\").  My wife ordered the tiramisu sundae. The sundae was amazing.  We're not tiramisu fans (big ice cream fans though), but this was GREAT.  I have to say I was a little disappointed in the Creme Brulee.  After several very good courses, this one fell short.  I was expecting the chef's menu to close with a big bang, but it fizzled short.  If the tiramisu sundae was the dessert, I would have given 5 stars for sure, but it's probably the single thing I was disappointed in that evening.  Other than that, our dinner was great.", "author": "Daniel I."}

Okay, my friend is about 6'3''.  Poor guy could barely fit in the booth.  Anywhoo, he made the best of the situation and we began to dine.  \n\nWe started off with our salad and entree, accompanied with a delicious bottle of red wine.  I got the ahi tuna and though it was tasty, my friend got something with leeks...and that was SUPER YUMMY.  Ever since then, i've been wanting leeks.  I'm sure they were doused with yummy butter, but they were tasty.  \n\nWe didn't do dessert, but we did do a cheese plate.  It was amazing.  I love cheese.

Oysters are $6/half-dozen, which is pretty cheap considering how expensive the dinner menu is. However, the oysters are so tiny I can barely pick them up! The champagne mignonette that it comes with is realllyyy good though so that makes up for it. I also LOVE the truffle fries here, although it can be a bit salty sometimes...but still, love love love. The beef sliders you can skip, they're not that great.

After initial drink arrived (slowly) we had to request bread from another server and flag down the waitress for more drinks. We discussed with waitress about our excitement to have soft shell crab as we heard it just came in season this week. It was not a conversation had in passing, rather a length. Between 4 of us we ordered 3 sides of crab. After about an hour waiting (we did have appetizers in the meantime that were wonderful... Oysters for some and bone marrow with sea urchin) the dinner arrived. No soft shell crab, just shredded crab that tasted like it came out of a can. The one in our party who didnt have crab had a pasta dish that arrived somewhere between cold and room temperature. Explained to manager and he did take off the cold pasta, the oysters, and anything related to the crab. The part of the meal we expected was good but the test was a failure.

We got our drinks pretty fast--my boyfriend ordered wine, which was poured from a great distance and with very little care, so it splashed on my skirt and his shirt. No apologies were offered, if anything, our waiter was annoyed with us. We'd ordered oysters and 20 minutes later, i finally asked another server, a very friendly guy named Jeff, if the oysters were ever coming. He checked, and our waiter hadn't ordered them. Again, NO APOLOGIES were offered. Jeff, in the meantime, took great care of us--bring us water and candied nuts, while we were waiting. The check came to a $100 and all we had was 2 drinks and a dozen oysters. We were having a good time and didnt pay attention until the next morning, when i looked at our bill.

The decor was actually pretty awesome (albeit a tad on the old fashioned side, but I was quite fond of it, fake \"ancient\" mosaics and all).

It has been exactly two months this weekend since I visited San Francisco and I was shocked when I was looking through pictures this afternoon and realized that I had not reviewed this fantastic location. Since Farallon was connected to my hotel and naught but a door stood between us and a happy hour menu, my friend and I decided to stop in for a quick visit at the bar before heading out to find a good Japanese or Chinese restaurant to walk to for dinner. Well, not only did we get a killer recommendation on a nearby sushi joint, but we got to peruse the Farallon bar bible (actually, their full liquor/cordial menu) and even made a pact to return after dinner to further explore all that they had to offer. The happy hour special is definitely worth checking out as an inexpensive way to enjoy the feel of Farallon, but if you are going and can spend awhile I would recommend nothing short of putting yourself at the mercy of the bar, letting them know what you like and simply trusting them to make your visit memorable.\n\nSince we were counting on having to wait for seats at the sushi restaurant and were anticipating a fairly tame dinner, we were obliged to indulge in a tasting flight of three different selections of Glenmorangie and a small pour each of Hibiki (a Japanese single-malt that I had been lusting after) and of Ardbeg Uigeadail (a peat-tastic Islay under the influence of former-sherry casks). Let me reiterate... Farallon has great happy hour deals, but this is NOT what the bar at Farallon is really all about. Let them show you what they can do and it will be well worth the price!\n\nAfter filling ourselves past bursting with various types of roe and raw fish, edamame, restrained amounts of rice and even a little soft-shell crab, we changed into some stretchier pants (at least, I did) and headed back downstairs to Farallon to work on further celebrating my graduation day. As promised, Mark was still manning the bar and was quick to resume his position as our bar manager/bartender/mixologist/spirits expert extraordinaire. In a relatively short amount of time I had discovered my favorite gin (and I often claim not to like this juniper-centric distillation) and had totally fallen for a no-less-than-angellic, well-aged Armagnac. Now, I am a beer geek and I work in the the wine (as well as beer) industry, but I could be happy for a night without beer OR Champagne if these libations were invited to the party. My fellow graduate and drinking partner, Robin, was overjoyed with Mark's  top-shelf take on my ginger liqueur-spiked Dark & Stormy and I learned about the smoothest, most flavorful, best-balanced orange liqueur (specifically a blood orange liqueur from Sicily) that I have ever encountered.\n\nI cannot wait to go back to San Francisco to enjoy the City by the Bay, but I really cannot wait to get back to the bar at Farallon to enjoy the lounge under the sea. From the oceanic decor to the beyond-phenomenal staff to the fantastic spirits program, this is the best bar that I visited while on the west coast! Thanks, Farallon team!!!", "author": "Abby M."}

But, in our opinion, the Farallon  stands out as the best. The owner, executive chef, and general manager are yo be commended. Our server, Eva, was on top of her game. Her service was equal to and added to our phenomenal dining experience. She assisted us in ordering and recommending the best method of preparation, pairings, and she was on point with her recommendations for everything--appetizers, entrees, and desserts. She was attentive and professional. Her assistant servers brought our meals out on time, and our food was served at the right temperature. From appetizers to desserts, our dining experience at Farallon was enjoyable. I mean, the food is absolutely delicious. We have dined at Farallon since it opened--more than 20 years. It is one of the few high-end restaurants, not only on Post Street, but in the entire City, that has consistently delivered quality in food and service.

It isn't a tough gig.  All you need to do is smile, seat people at the correct table, and pay attention to their requests.  You didn't do any of the above.  if you were working for me, you would be fired.\n\nFirst, do not rush the customer. Our table was not going anywhere.  You did not need to make it crystal clear that you were annoyed with our party for taking the time to great each other at the door (and for one person, a senior citizen, to use the loo).  Sweetie, three of the guests flew in from Europe the previous evening.  We hadn't seen each other in years.  So quit your toe tapping and buy yourself a sense of humor because, in another year, not even botox is going to be able to erase those frown lines.\n\nSecond, when a party of six indicates that a table near the staging station isn't what they had in mind, you accommodate their request to wait for another table -- no ifs ands or buts about it. (There was an empty table for six within my sight line, so your claim that you \"had no other tables\" was clearly BS).\n\nIf I had been in charge of this party we would have made a hasty retreat based on the hostess's attitude.  Thankfully, however, I was out-voted because the remainder of our experience was top notch. \n\nOur waiter was perfect.  He knew the dishes and the wines like the back of his hand, was able to make appropriate suggestions, put together an off-menu vegetarian meal for me (which included sweat corn ravioli with an onion au jus and pureed sweet peas) that was easily the best meal I have had all year (and one of the very bests I have had in several years), drummed up a crab cocktail for one of our guests even though it was not on the menu (poor crabs), and provided excellent service that was attentive without being intrusive.  The wine he suggested (a 2008 Ancian carneros chard) caught me off guard because I do not like chards and did not expect to enjoy this one.  Boy was I wrong.  It was bold, juicy, complex and refreshing -- not words I normally use to describe a chardonnay.   (My main word is usually \"yuck\").  Thankfully I saved room for desert because the chocolate malt creation I selected left my taste buds doing a happy dance in my mouth.  \n\nFarallon is expensive and the portions are small, so be prepared to spend some money if you want to leave feeling satisfied (and full).  It is, however, money very well spent.  I can't wait to return.", "author": "Caisa S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-09", "description": "My evening at Farallon began normally enough. My friend called my office from Union Square and invited me for a drink before he had to meet up with his divorce lawyer. We met at the bar. Word has it they've got the best gin ever. I'm not a gin person, but I thoroughly enjoyed their citron vodka - it was some kind of organic brand which is rather cute. It cost $11. That's what I call priorities.\n\nIt was fun having a looksee. I haven't been to Farallon in years. I noticed they've removed a lot of tables from the front and added an oyster bar, which was very slow. I was intrigued by the changes. The first time I dined here was under the original Pat Kuleto design when the business and restaurant were flourishing. I often recall the appetizer I had that day - three kinds of smoked fish each with a pile of their roe atop, accompanied by a glass of champagne. Barbaric, delicious, divine! \n\nAside from the oyster bar, they've sort of \"beigewashed\" a large part of the front and middle of the restaurant. This decorating decision, I feel, was a mistake. Because as we sat on the banquette surrounded by the beigeness blending into the light mosaic floor, I just couldn't shake the feeling we were sitting in the bottom of an empty swimming pool. They need to go with a darker color to offset the beautiful floor and fixtures. I'm no designer, but it was obvious to me. \n\nMy confidence wasn't bolstered by the presentation of the menu. Two short pages of not very imaginitive seafood offerings including \"idaho trout, \" which just screams \"farmed\" to me. And something very bottom-of-the-barrel sounding called \"Wreckfish,\" so-named because it likes to swim around the wreckage of ships. The waitress told us this factoid as part of the menu schpiel. Swim around the wreckage of ships? The first thing I thought of was Robert Shaw's bloated face bobbing inside the submerged hull of his boat in the movie Jaws. Or maybe that was a different underwater dead guy, but you know who I mean. His eyes might have been nibbled out by Wreck Fish.\n\nThese were the grim thoughts that were going through my head at Farallon before I ordered. But we forged on with guts of steel and decided on four kinds of oysters for three of us, the artichoke/panko stuffed calamari with white bean, and three entrees which we hogged to ourseves. \n\nThere's nothing like juicy oysters over an even juicier conversation.  The oysters were great - we asked for recommendations of small ones, and the four kinds we ordered were all perfect in size, and uniquely textured and flavored, and presented beautifully. Heaven. All of the food was delicious. The dayboat scallops, the seared ahi, the asparagus with the tiniest pommes frites and rich, melty duck egg. My initial cynicism dissolved. \n\nMaybe this place is on some kind of pedestal in my memory. That, combined with the fact that parts of its interior were changed in such a heavy-handed way started me off badly. Maybe there's an old-worldness about it which I'm not used to with these particular friends. There were mostly tourists in the place, which as a San Franciscan I'm appreciative of, but my snob button got pushed or something. I'm trying to say I was wrong! \n\nAfter dinner we strolled around the closed dining room with our apertifs - what kind and patient waitstaff! - genuinely interested in looking around but also making fun of some of the paintings - can I sound like a bigger asshole here? Looking at a rather pedestrian one, of people emptying fish on a pier, my friend said \"That one's from the Nebraska school of the landlocked.\"\n\nHopefully they'll have us back someday.

Everything was grand, but the high point was the halibut. As the saying goes, that piece of halibut was good enough for jehovah. Really, once of the best servings of fish I've had in quite a while. Service was first rate (informed, attentive, but never annoying) and the wine list is impressive.\n\nThe crab cakes were also a delight, but the GUINNESS MILK CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM SUNDAE was to die for (all caps courtesy of the Farallon website).\n\nIt is of course a pricey place, but very memorable for special occasions.\n\nMost highly recommended", "author": "Richard P."}

The decor is gorgeous-you feel like you are in a lush underwater cave. Sea anemone/jelly fish glass chandeliers,  fresh seafood sprawled across huge crystal bowls of ice, beautiful wall decor, and the best part was our booth. We had the best seat in the house-an almost completely private banquet that opened up over the whole dining room-fab.\n\nthe bread they generously passed out upon arrival was ok-def not worth breaking a low carb diet for-but the sea salted butter was delish.\n\nOur server was very good intentioned, but a little odd. They have a specialty drink menu, and when i didnt find anything on there I wanted and asked him to recommend a vodka cocktail done martini style that was not too sweet, it was like I was asking him to explain the meaning of life. He went on this whole diatribe about what a martini is, what it is not, why my request made it difficult to suggest something, etc etc. He finally asked the bartender and brought me some lemoney charmbordy thing that was ok. The Duck Farm chard we followed it up with was great though.\n\nI started with ono, char, and tuna sashimi trio-very fresh, but a little too much oil on the char (I like my sashimi with just an accent of added flavor to not overpower the fish, but it was good) \n\nNext came the main of branzino, in a lobster broth with artichoke hearts and wax beans. Lots of fresh perfectly cooked veggies, and they filleted it beautifully. Branzino skin was perfectly crunchy.\n\nFinished with an amazing dessert that had all of my fave things: warm chocolate cake with caramel and vanilla cream in the middle, topped with dulce de leche sauce, salted peanuts, banana sorbet (out of this world) and fresh vanilla bean whipped cream. \n\nMy only reason for not giving 5 starts is the service-they guy spent waaaaay too much time talking and really didnt seem to know what he was talking about (which created some funny moments for my dinner date and i, but was a little annoying none the less). However, the food runner  was unbelievably cute-wished he was our server.\n\nWas a great CA dining experience-I come out here craving delicious fresh fish in a beautiful setting, and thats what I got!", "author": "Meredith M."}

If you like to eat bread and drink wine for two to three hours, this is the place for you. The manager did give us a 15% discount.

After checking in 15 mins late because Downtown was full of cars and people for the holidays, we followed the maitre d' into the Pool Room with huge sea urchin light fixtures, so very aquatic.  There's a 3 course prix fixe menu for $50 daily before 6:30 PM.\n\nWe sat midway facing the kitchen and could watch the action. I commented to our  friends that the wait staff is well -trained,  waiting and watching patiently for the pick-up while the open kitchen chefs prepared their customers' dishes. \n\nIt's a fairly extensive menu with appetizers and entrees in one menu book, another for the wine and a 3rd for the oyster bar specialities.  I started with a vodka oyster shooter.  It was OK, the heat from the Worcheshire sauce and something spicy really gave my nostrils a hit.  Like innocently shoving a lump of wasabi into your mouth thinking it was guacamole.  Wow,  I can breathe again!\n\nThe bread consisted of a slice of crunchy French bread with soft interiors and a crispy piece of bagette and butter sprinkled with chunks of pink sea salt.  We received a complementary taste of chilled carrot garlic vichyssoise in the tiniest of cup and saucer.  It was very tasty with a tang of ginger. \n\nMy appetizer, the Delta smoked sturgeon served on top of a crispy potato cake and finished with Paddlefish caviar was delicious.  There were 4 decent-sized squares, really enough to share.  I could've have eaten several of this order all night long for dinner.  There are several choices for the oysters on a half shell.\nHubby had the Hudson Valley foie gras which was sweet and pate'-like.  It was such a huge serving, simliar to a small round of brie cheese and was served over paper-thin slices of persimmon with plenty of toasted brioche.  Just wonderful.  \n\nMy entree, a deliciously pan-fried and finished in the oven pike was even better.  I'd never tried pike before and the white meat was sweet and tender, reminded me of a smooth black cod.  It was served over a deliously crisped polenta with a wonderful sauce. Everyone at the table said that dish was good.  A big bite of the osso bucco was dry and bland, I could not taste any of the red wine it was cooked in. The rack of lamb was very tender.  The seared ahi tuna slices was not memorable and could be had at any other restaurant.  It was served over tiny green lentils which was good.\n\nWe had a bottle of French Merlot for $48.  The sommelier offered us the 2001 bottle for the same price which was smoother.   I passed on dessert because I could eat no more but had bites of everyone else's.  The honey roasted pear was quite good. Even better was the pecan ice cream which was served with the petite apple turnovers which tasted just like apple turnovers.  The early autumn fruit with Pippin apples, persimmon, dates and Satsuma mandarin oranges were good but pricey for $11.  It came with a container of natural honey dripping off a square of honeycomb full of honey!  Absolutely divine!\n\nThe restroom is 2 stalls, with a large wheelchair access and tiny tiles on the floor similar to the ceiling in the Pool room. The restaurant is housed in the historic building where the ElK Club lived.  My friend told me the pool is below the level of the restaurant and the ceiling of the restaurant is probably the original pool ceiling with miniscule tiles.  Our waitress was nice, attentive but not as attentive as the service at Gary Danko's at the same cost. \nThe bill included 4% health surcharge for the staff.

For those who haven't been, Farallon remains one of the city's classic restaurants, specializing in coastal cuisine, and it's sea fantasy-like interior (think jellyfish chandeliers and and illuminated caviar staircase) is still fresh.\n\nThe addition of an oyster bar is especially exciting to me, because it means that I might be able to enjoy Farallon at a more reasonable price (relatively speaking), and thus more frequently.\n\nSo, my friend and I arrived around six pm, figuring some oysters would be a fun way to start out the evening (we ended up going to Morton's down the street for dinner). We sat right at the bar, with full-on view of all sorts of raw crustaceans: lobster claw, crabs, clams, oysters, shrimp, all gorgeously displayed.\n\nYou can order off the bar menu, or ask your knowledgeable server for some ideas. I don't know my oysters that well, for example, but our waitress suggested a few that all proved to be delicious in their own way. I also tried the jumbo shrimp cocktail, which defines all three of the words in its name quite well. Since I knew we were having dinner later, I opted to sadly pass on what is surely a treat - the Maine Lobster roll - knowing that Farallon would most definitely will do right by this New England comfort food. Next time, ah next time.\n\nSome items I know I'll try on that next time will surely include their grey goose oyster shooters, and if my appetite prevails, their 1/2 cracked dungeness crab with drawn butter. Oh, I might wash it down with their black peppercorn infused vodka Mariner cocktail, a nice compliment to any raw dish.\n\nBy all means, go to Farallon for the full experience if you can. But being able to sit at a bar like this makes for a somewhat more social, impromptu and casual experience, and I don't think the lobster will know the difference.", "author": "Nish N."}

It had an amazing balance of sweetness, spiciness and texture.

There's lots of curves and not many right angles to be found in the restaurant, evoking a wave or ocean-like feeling.\n\nFor dinner, my wife had the $50 prix fixe menu consisting of dungeness crab cakes, seared halibut, and creme caramel for dessert.  The crab cakes were 3 2-inch diameter, very moist, with large chunks of crab.  Seared halibut was also prepared well, not dry.  Creme caramel had the right amount of sweetness, and was a good ending for the prix fixe.\n\nI started with the cornmeal-crusted squid, on top of squid ink risotto.  The squid was nice and crispy, yet still soft on the inside.  The squid risotto with the pesto sauce was creamy, yet a little tart from the sauce.  Next, I had the English Channel turbot pillows, which was turbot chunks with a lobster and scallop mousse wrapped around with lettuce then poached.  This was finished with  chopped vegetables and a foie gras sauce.  The turbot were indeed soft and light like pillows, and moist, and the foie gras sauce was very light as well, and did not overpower the fish.  For dessert, I had a German chocolate sundae.  Perfect for me, vanilla ice cream, pecans, caramel, coconut, topped with a vanilla bean cream...gooey, yum.\n\nService was efficient and unobtrusive.  As with previous visits, we had a nice dining experience, and would probably visit again in the future.", "author": "Steve L."}

Actually, we will essentially being staying at sea level. Not even near the water but at a restaurant in Union Square. And while it is a nautical themed restaurant I didn't get to see anyone wearing a self contained underwater breathing apparatus, but the guy sitting next to me at the raw bar was wearing shorts. Shorts. That's a rarity in the city even more so at an upscale restaurant on a Saturday night.\n\nSpeaking of raw bars, I know they are haute cuisine and the \"cool\" thing right now but I just don't get it. I am going to assume my palate isn't developed enough to understand the big deal with ordering oysters, which we did. It was cool, just seemed kinda pointless. Grab oyster, slurp, and swallow. No chewing involved...\n\nWe were a few minutes early and seated at said raw bar which was great because it did give us some time to explore oyster cuisine and to try The Mariner, a drink made here specifically to accompany oysters. The Mariner is made with sherry and peppercorn infused vodka, this being the highlight of my oyster pit stop. \n\nAt the exact moment when our reservations were supposed to be the hostess arrived, grabbed our drinks, and escorted us to our table. You can't really tell from the outside, but the restaurant is huge. There is the Raw Bar, the Jelly Bar, the Nautilus Room, and finally the Pool Room where we were seated. Each having a different design. The Pool Room is gorgeous and the ceilings have an aged European tile look about them. Hanging from the ceilings thoughout are light fixtures replicated to look like sea life. What I thought were sponge lights in our room were actually sea urchins. I thought sponges were a weird choice because it made me think of IUDs. Then I thought it was weird that I was thinking of IUDs at a nice restaurant. Then I wondered if a sex themed restaurant would go over well in the city. Thankfully our waiter appeared soon after. \n\nThe service was top notch. I can't believe how many different people visited our table throughout the night either taking orders, busing, or delivering food. It was a well oiled machine. And the food... Easily one of the best seafood meals I've had. California Sturgeon over warm potato salad. Absolutely phenomenal. We ended dinner with a warm chocolate pudding cake and salted peanut ice cream. Mouth watering good, so good that it almost makes you want to fight your date for the last bite. Almost.\n\nWe picked Farallon for a celebratory dinner and couldn't have been happier with our choice.", "author": "Bucky K."}

I'd heard Farallon has among the best seafood in SF and, while I'm always skeptical of claims like that, I walked away believing the hype.  Not to mention the desserts were fantastic.\n\nBut it was the service that was exquisite.  First off, our waiter whisked away my companion's water glass without explanation.  He returned with a new one, explaining that he thought he saw a crack in the first glass.  Plates were delivered and cleared at the same time -- sadly, a bygone tradition.  \n\nAlso, our waiter was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and, when confronted with a question about the oysters, he didn't hesitate to go ask the chef instead of making something up.  When I asked which of the two bottles of Vouvray he'd recommend, he sent over the sommelier.  Too often, waiters opine and make recommendations instead of asking the experts in the field.  Indeed, I asked the sommelier to surprise me with a selection and he picked a perfect bottle that matched his description perfectly.\n\nSo it's pricey and the Under The Sea ambience is a bit strange, but this really is a great restaurant.", "author": "Geoff K."}

Obviously, it's not under the sea, but the visually stunning decor when you first walk in certainly gives you that dreamy undersea feeling.\n\nFarallon is the exact polar opposite of a horrible tourist trap seafood restaurant at the wharf which actually does offer true dining under the sea...Forbes Island.  I'm chuckling right now since a former coworker of mine just called to tell me about dry heaves and severe cramping after dining there.  Normally, I wouldn't find it funny, but this is the same cocky guy who read my review and told me he was going anyway.  (Sorry Jim, but you need to stop lurking and start reviewing)  The last time I was there, I didn't get sick, but I was so disappointed that I was glancing around for Swanson TV dinner boxes to see if they were defrosting the pre-made tasting dinners at Forbes Island.\n\nAnyway, sorry to get sidetracked...back to Farallon:\nThe amazing undersea decor has been gorgeous since day one, but even more impressive is that it has stood the test of time and aged beautifully. \n\nI dined here twice the first week it opened back in '97 and have been coming here ever since.  Despite all the changes over the years, this place still makes me happy.  I just took my GF here for her birthday and was happy to see that the food and atmospshere here is still going strong.\n\nAlthough this is a seafood restaurant, for those of you that prefer something else (I admit it, I love steak), their filet of beef is tender and a surprisingly decent alternative.  The striped bass I had this time was succulent and perfectly cooked, as was the halibut.  \n\nService was extremely professional as everyone was obviously very well-trained.  Unobtrusive, yet always very much aware and attentive.\n\nThe quality of the food and artistic presentation combined with first-rate service made for a most memorable, almost surreal dining experience.\n\nAlthough we didn't have it this time, the three course fixed prixe menu at $50/person is a bargain, so we'll definitely be going back there soon.  Ordinarily, that would be impossible since it's only until 6:30PM, but now that I've taken some time off to enjoy life, it's perfect!\n\nIf you're looking to impress a date or just show someone special some love, you could do a lot worse than this place. \n\nInteresting trivia - I hear there used to be a swimming pool in this historic building before it became a restaurant, somewhere in the main dining area.", "author": "Roy N."}

We had some interesting cocktails at the bar and then sat in a booth in the back.  My ahi tuna dish was probably the most forgettable thing I've ever eaten in such a nice restaurant - overcooked, bland, and surrounded by mushy vegetables.  The more raw apps were much better.  Dessert was heavenly - I had the chocolate malt gateau.  \n\nOur waiter was VERY detailed in his descriptions of each and every item on the menu, which was a little much, but I guess was helpful.", "author": "Sarah S."}

I said my favorite was Grand Cafe, but that was before I went on a theater night (craziness) and found a hair in my house salad (mm... tastes like Salon Selectives). Now we're back to Farallon being my #1 most beloved. It never disappoints. Never.\n\nThe staff is outstanding. It's rare that I rank the service above the food, but these folks know how to treat you right. I've gone about 6 times in the last few years, and this last trip was equally exceptional. The wait staff are professionals... they're not disgruntled artists/writers/slackers that just couldn't find anything better. They take pride in what they do and it really shows. \n\nWhen you make a reservation - and DO make a reservation - make sure to request seating in the back room. You can even put this in the comments section on OpenTable.com. The upstairs is pretty (and the bathrooms are up there) because you're eye-level to the jellyfish lamps, but it doesn't compare to the underwater decor in back.\n\nThere's no valet for lunch which is a bit of a PITA, but that's a very small complaint for such a memorable dining experience. Perfect for a romantic date, a client lunch/dinner, any type of celebratory event or just to eat deliciously fresh fish fare and feel fancy.", "author": "Bernadette D."}

I've toyed with the idea of going before, but honestly it's a bit too pricey for me and guests always want to try places I've eaten already.\n\nI had the Crusted California White Sea Bass with fingerling potato hash, asparagus, orange, Dungeness Crab, & bone marrow.  The sauce was basically clarified butter with a whisper of orange.  The potato hash was heaven.  The fish was good, although a little rare in the middle, which is I think not the norm for sea bass (but I am not sure...).  Very rich meal.  The chef certainly likes his butter.  The sweet corn soup starter was lovely and lighter than the entrees and was presented excellently.  Not your everyday corn chowder.  Everyone liked their meal, but only the lone duck eater was truly blown away.\n\nThe desserts were decadent.  We had the boysenberry cobbler: not too tart and tasted like it had been homemade for us--the cobbler topping was really a warm, buttery, cakey biscuit atop a mound of stewed boysenberries and garnished with lemon buttermilk ice cream (not too great on its own, but amazing with everything in one spoonful).\n\nWe also had the German Chocolate Cake with coconut ice cream.  The was tasty and rich but the milk chocolate and caramel sauces that garnished the plate didn't match well with the coconut and dark chocolate goodness of the layer cake (at least for my palate).  Don't get me wrong, the cake itself was to die for!\n\nWhile I am giving Farallon four stars, I probably won't be going back.  The decor is nice, but this restaurant is too loud, too pricey, and too buttery (maybe a plus for some people?).  There are better options in the Bay Area I'm sure, but I'm glad to have been there at least once.", "author": "Sarah L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-11-26", "description": "Holy crap, this place is sh*tty! Farallon would never survive in a city like NYC...Let me break it down for you:\n\n1) Decor -- it's like walking onto the set of \"The Little Mermaid.\" Must a seafood restaurant have jelly fish hanging from the ceiling? Must the booths be shaped like clam shells? I'm surprised they didn't have \"Under the sea\" playing in the background.\n\n2) Menu -- for a \"seafood\" restaurant, Farallon's menu offers very little seafood options. The few fish they did list didn't seem to appetizing so I opted for the ribeye.\n\n3) Food -- holy crap. I swear, I am not at all exaggerating when I say that my hand started cramping when I tried to cut into my ribeye. At first sight, I was impressed by the size of the steak they brought over, but on closer inspection, I noticed that there was a huge circumference of fat all around the thing. And to top it off, my \"rare\" order of ribeye was so tough, I could barely pierce it with my fork, and it was exhausting trying to cut and chew through the thing.\n\n4) Service -- crappy much? When your menu's entrees are $36+, you shouldn't come around to the table every 5 minutes while people are still actively eating and ask if they're done or if they'd \"like to box that!!\" I couldn't believe how unprofessional the service was here. Not only were they trying to kick us out while I still had about a 3x4in piece of the ribeye still left (of course I didn't end up finishing it, because my jaw was in pain enough), but the waiter always had this, \"Huh?\" sort of look on his face anytime we asked him for his opinion on things like wine pairing and meal choices.", "author": "Joyce S."}

This place really treats you right and it's hard trying to be budget minded here.  Our bill was over $400 for two of us at the end of it all.

We sat in the bar a good 20 minutes waiting for our table and couldn't get a drink. \n\nThe food and wine made up for that in no time. From the fresh bread brought around by a woman with a basket to the wine selection- everything was great. My fish was cooked to perfection and NOTHING was lacking in the flavor department, which I loved. I do not like bland food.\n\nThe ambiance was cute with an under-the-sea type decor.

My mouth is delighted and ready to party when I see and taste their ever-changing menu.  The chef's are very creative and are able to exploit the full flavor of the different types of seafood.  For non-seafood fans, they also serve land animal food as well.  Beyond a great menu, they also have a very good wine list with a superior white wine section - which is a perfect match for nearly any fish dish.  The decor is also pretty neat as well.  From the moment you walk in, you'll notice the jelly fish lighting hanging from the ceiling, iridescent colors, and comfortable, natural wood tones.  \n\nThe reason why I'm knocking this one star is because for the same price, I do like the food at Aqua much better.  The decor is much funner at Farallon, but the food at Aqua is superior (which is not a testament to bad food at Farallon, its just that Aqua has some amazing chefs).  Nevertheless, check this place out.  For sure, if there was ever an underwater civilization, and a Merman was going to take out his Mermaid, Farallon would probably be an exact replica of that spot.", "author": "Herman N."}

I find the interior soothing and comforting, even on the dreariest of San Francisco eve's. Once seated, I always go for a Tanqueray Martini, up with olives -- goes perfect with a selection of their always fresh and tasty oysters. \n\nI usually go here with 3 or 4 people, so we'll generally share a dozen oysters, and one or two other appetizers. This accompanied with a solo entree leaves just enough room for dessert :-). \n\nOne of my favorite dishes which I've had at Farallon is their Halibut over Crab Hash... (droooooooooool). SO GOOD. They have an extensive wine list to accompany any item on their menu and then some. \n\nSure sure, let's be realistic. It IS expensive, but I think it's worth it. From the exemplary service when you step in the door, to the moment you step out and they help you get into your coat/jacket (if you can still fit in it after eating!)

In trying to be more sophisticated and also sort of celebrating a new job, I decided to go try out Farallon. I heard good things, and also I had a gift certificate that I embarrassingly never gave to my friend for her wedding present (TWO years ago! - note to reader, don't invite me to your wedding). anyway, I thought it would be good to try it out and get rid of this gift certificate that's just been sitting around.\n\nIt's not that farallon is bad, in fact, it would be pretty good... had we paid about one-third of what the total tab came out to. The appetizers were just so-so. I tried the seared scallops with a mango sauce. the scallops were decent, but the mango sauce just didn't belong. Also, we tried the foie gras on a grilled pineapple. Again, the foie gras was okay - i've had better - but the pineapple was completely out of place. For whatever reason, they were really feelin' the tropical fruit, but unfortunately they were the reasons I didn't enjoy the appetizers... the $20!! appetizers.\n\nMy lady-friend ordered the pike, and I ordered the barramundi. the pike was meh, served with a crab fondue which sort of went well with it. The barramundi, which I'd never had before, was veritably delicious. It was served on top of corn ravioli which were just okay, but I liked the idea. Both entrees were peculiarly devoid of tropical fruit.\n\nWe also gave in and tried their mixed berry bread pudding. Also, just okay - a bit too syrupy.\n\nIn the end, the service was good, though it had a bit of a cult-like feel. sometimes it's just a bit uncomfortable when people check in with you every 5 minutes... however, never ONCE asking how the food was (did they KNOW something?). I was not a fan of the decor nor the crowd, but I sort of knew about both going in, so I can't really fault them for that. In the end, it was an okay meal, but it was just not even CLOSE to being worth what I paid for. Sadly, I'm gonna tell you pass on Farallon if you were thinking about it.

It was delicious and got us off to a good start. \n\nWe were served dinner less than 5 minutes after our one bite. my salad was great and my husband thought his food was great until.... \nHe offered me a shrimp and I gladly accepted and broke the news to him that the shrimp was on the verge of being bad because the texture was a little on the soft side.

I remember saying to myself, \"when I make it big in this town, I'm goin' to Farallon!!\"  \n\nSilly me...\n\nNowadays, I am fortunate enough to enjoy some of the comforts that life has to offer and I've become a jaded and cynical food snob.  I am an embarassment to all that San Francisco represents:\n\n- I can be accurately labeled as a \"Yuppie\" (although I believe this term has fallen out of favor).\n- I drive an SUV.\n- I point my pinkie out when I hold my coffee cup.\n\nIn short, every fiber of my being should love Farallon.\n\nBut I don't.\n\nPerhaps it's the jellyfish light fixtures that creep me out.\nMaybe it's the stifling undersea theme.\nHow about the lackluster and overpriced dinner menu which averages nearly forty bucks per entree?  Yeah, that's it...\n\nWhatever the case, my experiences at Farallon have triggered an acute case of self-introspection.  Why am I here?  What is the meaning of life?  Where can I get a decent goddamned burrito in this town?\n\nFrom now on, I promise to be a man of the people... as long as those people don't scratch the paint on my car.", "author": "Gracie-C Y."}

I did a lot of research as I wanted to pick a great place for my boyfriend's birthday. The decor is fun & we got a nice booth.\n\nWe ordered the 1/2 lb lobster for an app, really it was only 2 good bites. I ordered the Ono and he the lemon fish.  Both were average, not bad, but nothing special. For dessert we had the Sunday Brunch Apple Spice Sunday and Bittersweet Chocolate Malt, again nothing special. The waiter also forgot my boyfriend's b-day even though I was very clear about it on the reservation. For a pricy SF restaurant, they could do way,way better. If you're a foodie, definitely not your place. While I would never pay for a meal again here, I would go to the bar. Their happy hour bar bites are fun and tasty.", "author": "Liz M."}

I had let the staff know ahead of time that this would be her first visit and they certainly made it a remarkable evening for both of us.\n\nDue to the holiday traffic we left early and arrived about 45 minutes before our reservation and found the bar area packed, we waited a few minutes and gained two seats at the bar.   We soon began talking to the bar manager Craig and found that he was very knowledgeable of the liquor and recommended the Octopus Confit as and appetizer as we sipped on our drinks.  I can not remember when I last enjoyed an appetizer so much, it was tender, tasteful and just a delight to the palate. \n\nWe were soon called for dinner and had a table overlooking most of the dinning area, Our server soon appeared, discussed possibilities and removed himself quietly as we perused the menu.  I selected the sturgeon and she selected the seabass, both were presented well and extremely well prepared.  We shared the the chocolate dessert and enjoyed coffee at the end of the meal.\n\nI should mention that my daughter is a bartender in a high end restaurant and is super critical of service, food preparation and ambiance.  She agreed with me that all were superb, she got an extra kick out of the jelly fish chandeliers.\n\nI would highly recommend dinning at Farallon.", "author": "Kenneth G."}

(To refresh your memory, my husband and I, and a friend of ours try out one restaurant every two weeks.  The rule - it should be a restaurant that the three of us haven't dined at before).  \nThe moment we entered Farallon, I felt as if I was inside a cruise ship.  The d\u00e9cor will give you this \"under the sea\" feeling.   You may also feel a little claustrophobic with the restaurant not having any windows in the dining area.  Thank goodness the food made it all worth it.\n\nOur dinner started off with the chef's compliment - cauliflower soup with caviar.  I'm with two people who are not too fond of veggies but they liked this one.  We ordered 3 appetizers - Octopus Carpaccio, Soft Shell Crab, and Assortment of Oysters.  The octopus carpaccio was just okay.  It has this jelly-like taste and unfortunately the flavor didn't sift in.  If it wasn't for the sunflower seeds, I would've given this 1 star rating.  Loved the oysters - fresh and flavorful.  The soft shell crab was the best - crispy, well-balanced flavor.\n\nNow the main dishes... FRESH! FRESH! FRESH!\n\nI had the English Channel Turbot Pillow Foie Gras - this dish was very filling!  Fish was fresh, and the foie gras sauce gave it a lot of flavor, just yummy! If there's one downside with this dish it was the carrots.  I think it would've been better without it.\n\nMy hubby had the Halibut with Pancetta - another nice dish.  The danger with ordering a halibut dish is it could turn out dry and bland.  This dish was not dry at all.  The fish was fresh and the pancetta just balanced the flavor.\n\nOur friend had the Pike with Gnocchi - he gave this dish a 4 star rating.  He liked the crispiness of the fish and the gnocchi was superb!\n\nAs for desserts - well first, to clean our palate, they gave us this Meyer Lemon Lavender - it was a nice touch.  We ordered the pound cake - awesome! , cheese plate - just okay, and the small landings - nothing special here.\n\nThe service was great!  Our server was very friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, and just really took the time to explain the menu.  Of course, we left her a pretty hefty tip! \n\nOverall, this restaurant was a good pick!  I only have two minor complaints - bread was not warm and I wish the chefs in the kitchen (we were seated facing them) wore caps/hairnets.  I hate to see hair strands in my food!  \n\nBut hey, Method hand soap in the bathroom - not bad at all!", "author": "Elaine C."}

Our waiter explained that the 1st and 2nd courses were portioned like a tasting menu and third courses, like small entrees. This was accurate.\nWe started with the chilled Dungeness crab legs, w/ lemon aioli, drawn butter and cocktail sauce.  Delicious, six small legs, like a tasting course.\nMy husband had a salad - good. I chose the American paddlefish caviar on buckwheat blinis, with a dab of creme fraiche and chives sitting on a pool of melted butter... divine, though a tad less melted butter would not overwhelm the other more delicate flavors of the dish....but it seems petty to complain as it was heavenly. \nDH had the seared scallop (large scallop) on a generous bed of truffled polenta, kale and crisp pancetta - I am not a scallop fan, but he was thrilled with it.\nThird course for him - Hawaiian Tombo tuna with trumpet mushrooms, baby book Choy in a red miso broth. Also wonderful, and more \"entree\" sized.\nMy third course: seared sole with truffled sweet potato raviolis, saut\u00e9ed crispy baby artichokes and brown butter. Truly lovely and more than enough for me. \nAll in all, a wonderful experience. Check came in at just under $200 (without tip) for three cocktails, crab app, salad, caviar and blini app, scallop, and the two entrees. \nWe would go back in a heartbeat.", "author": "Marcia G."}

I had some time before a downtown meeting last night and I grooved on into Farallon cause I love me some seafood and had heard that despite the bizarro Disneyland decorations, the food here is quite good.  I plopped myself down at the bar with the Wall Street Journal as my date and perused the menu.  \r\n\r\nI must admit, that at first I was like, holy shit balls this stuff is expensive, but then once my eyes became acustomed to the large numbers it all seemed much more reasonable (assisted my rather scrummy viognier).  Anywho, I got the Lobster \"Roll\" which isn't really a roll but rather a pile of succulent goodness on top of some fantastic brioche with a little pitcher of butter.  I poured that crap onto of the \"Roll\" and went directly to heaven.  Do not pass go, seriously, catapulted straight outta the cannon into heaven.  This is the best starter I've had in at least a year....\r\n\r\nI then progressed to a lovely sea bass on a bed of sweet corn ravioli and was again impressed.  This time I remained on my seat, but it was still phenominal.  \r\n\r\nThe staff was wonderful and accomodating, stopping to chat so I wouldn't have to resort to the painfully boring MarketPlace selection of Wednesday's WSJ.  They also managed to smile and seem pleased to serve the horde of overweight tourists who arrived just as I left, screaming about cab fares and hills.  They all sweated over to the bar seats and managed to pull themselves into upright positions while fanning with napkins, apparently the walk from the St. Francis is really aggressive, or so I was told. \r\n\r\nGotta give this place a super shout out for making me feel so welcome on a lonely Wednesday night after work, and rocking my tastebuds' world.

But, why?  Because Farallon meets all of our requirements for an exceptional dining experience: wine pairings we have never tried, ingredients you can't buy in stores, exotic preparations we have never seen or read about, and a great staff of people (we have had the same two Sommeliers for the last three years and Luke our waiter on Saturday was VERY knowledgeable about both the menu and the winehe had tried most of them, so he deserves a special thanks for making the meal memorable).\n\nI would save your pennies and go to Farallon if you are prepared to go all out so that you can do a nice selection of wine parings.  I recommend doing a glass of Champagne with the raw bar and two half bottles, one white, one red.  The list has a wonderful selection of half bottles, and because a lot of the appetizers are fairly delicate but the entrees can stand on their own, you can pair the appetizers with a nice white and the entrees with a good Pinot without over powering any of the dishes.  PS, I like chardonnay just as much as the next guy, but they really over power a lot of the dishes so ask the sommelier for an alternative, such as a Grner Veltliner (the latest craze to come out of Austria--and you heard it first on Yelp.com ;). \n\nOther recommendations if you plan on going this season include: the tasting of marinated fish (some of the best credo ever, especially the one with the quail egg mixed with caviar), the lobster salad (it comes with a vat of butter, you pour over the lobster and brioche awesome with Champagne), and the Roasted Hawaiian deep water \"Lehi\" snapper with ros Champagne poached manilla clams, buttered leeks, potatoes, chervil.", "author": "Rosie F."}

When you walk in you feel like it's a little \"enchantment under the sea\" with fake jellyfish hanging from the ceiling and other amazing decor.\n\nNow for the bad news, the food is....well.....not good. My boyfriend ordered the lobster bisque (absolutely no flavor, a can of campbell's soup would outshine this by far) and the beef fillet (mediocre, not worth the price). I ordered the artichoke salad as an appetizer (please just take this off the menu, it tasted absolutely horrible, dry with no flavor....and I LOVE artichokes) and the california yellowtail for the main dish (couldn't even finish it, the flavor was just all sorts of wrong). \n\nThe only food that actually tasted good from this place was a side order of fries that had to come from the bar area because it is not on their regular menu...they topped it with parmesan cheese that made it very tasty. So perhaps the bar food is the way to go when visiting Farallon?\n\nAnyway, if you don't want to be out almost $200 for a lack luster meal for two, don't waste your time. BUT, for the atmosphere, perhaps a stop at the bar and an order of their parmesan fries (I can't remember exactly what they called them) with a cocktail might be worth it. Other than that, don't order from the main menu.... your wallet and taste buds will not be happy with you.", "author": "Natalia H."}

I had an entree of rabbit prepared two ways -- sausage and wrapped in bacon. Both were quite good, but not as striking as the salad. Dessert was, well, pretty darn good given the choices.

The ambiance is supurb and one would be hard-pressed to top it for an underweater themed seafood restaurant. The tiled floor, the jellyfish lamps, the paintings and murals, the clam-styled seating - all very nice and well done. This decor gives Farallon most of its stars in the ratings, the food was so-so, the cost was astronomical. \n\nI had the Hawaiian ono, my wife had the prix fixe- neither were all that impressive. It was good, but nothing popped or stood out from other seafood restaurants. With the price, you'd expect it to compete with the tastes of other perennial seafood places in SF and other coastal cities (Boston, Miami, Seattle), but it really didn't. I was trying to convince myslef that it was really good, but I hate lying to myself, and my wife told me to stop. The dessert was actually really good, so Farallon saved itself from complete mediocrity.\n\nThe service was very good. Coat check, reservation in tact, superb wine list with helpful advice, though I wish they hadn't advised me on an unlisted 11 oz. bottle of beer that ended up being $13 per. They were very personalble and a good wait staff though, makes SF looks good.\n\nAnd really, that is what Farallon is. It is located off Union Square and attracts a lot of out-of-towners. It's decor and service helps tremendously meet the image of San Francisco others may have, and for that we are lucky to have Farallon. And just like the coffee in Paris tastes that much better to we Americans, Farollon in San Francisco may taste that much better to those travelling from, say, St. Louis.

Mark Franz, who opened the once-famous restaurant Stars with Jeremiah Tower, is the Executive chef.  Mr. Franz opened the restaurant with restaurateur Pat Kuleto, who created the outrageous \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\" dcor, with  hand-blown jellyfish lamps, kelp bedlike backlit columns, glass clamshells, sea-urchin light fixtures, a sea-life mosaic floor, and a tentacle-encircled Jellyfish Bar.\n\nI started off with a \"Original Mai-Tai\" on a velour couch in the bar area.  It was an odd rum martini that lacked sufficient sweetener, but the whimsical dcor and friendly service made up for the disappointment.  We were seated upstairs in a comfortable intimate booth.  Service was both friendly and hyper-knowledgeable (responding at length with a blow-by-blow of how crab are caught and hauled in after a concern about the oil spill).  \n\nWe ordered the Fruits De Mer Royal Platter as both an appetizer and main entre for two.  This iced  tower consisted of one whole lobster, one crab, two kinds of ceviche (citrusy ono and a sesame salmon), raw scallops, clams and oysters, several crawfish and jumbo shrimp.  It was a delight.  It came with cocktail sauce and a delicate champagne mignonette.  However, I had to request drawn butter.\n\nNext we tried the seared Maine diver scallops, which were plump and fresh.  They came with seared bacon braised Swiss chard and short rib tortellini.  Farallon also offers meat and game items, such as pheasant, lamb and steak.  Our dinner was thoughtfully paired with an Oregon Argyle \"Nuthouse\" Chardonnay.   The wine list was its own book, offering more than 400 by the bottle and 30 by the glass.  There was also a whole book of cocktails.  \n\nFor dessert we could not resist trying the Cocoa Nib Beignets, which are Southern fried donut holes sprinkled with sugar.  These came filled with melted bittersweet chocolate, and two sauces: vanilla bean and cocoa nib anglaise.

We had sardine, shrimp and scallops quenelle, lobster lamb crepe as starters. The crepe had a wonderful texture; it was light as air and tasty. The sardine and the quenelle were both disappointing imo.\n\nThe entrees were both awesome: branzino (brazillian bass) and trout with green curry. The bass is crispy and tops some delicious grilled vegetables. The trout was tender and the curry was surprising, since the only curried fish I've had are really salty and spicy ones in Indian restaurants. I thought it was good.\n\nWe didn't have any shellfish or lobsters this time, but I would say the fish dishes warrant 4 stars at least.

I had very good memories of my meals here, so I was pretty disappointed...  While I'm sure the ingredients are of the best quality (the beausoleil and kumamoto oysters we had were the best I've ever eaten), and our waiter was very helpful and gracious, the lobster bisque was kind of soul less, as was my main dish.  I ordered the branzino because I'd recently had it at kokkari and decided it was my favorite fish ever, and this one had none of the butteriness and complexity of flavors of the one I'd had before. If I could do it over again, I would probably just get one of the crazy seafood plateaus they have. We saw one pass by and it looked amazing, and as I said, the oysters were pretty good.\n\nWe also ordered a $150 bottle of burgundy, just because we could (it wasn't our money), and I have to say, it was totally meh.  I've had better 30 dollar bottles of california pinot.

I really hope the flavorless, over cooked, BORING dishes was just a one-off encounter. We were a party of four and were all VERY disappointed. The Ahi was sent back since it was delivered well done.

The food was in very small portions but was mostly excellent -- subtle flavours, well presented.  We loved the soft-shell crab with fried green tomatoes, the walleye pike with mushrooms, the branzino with snap peas, and the chocolate malt gateau (AMAZING).  We were not so impressed by the shellfish bisque (boring) and the baked alaska (decent, but nowhere near as good as the chocolate malt gateau).  The amuse bouche was oversalted, as was the butter.  Our service was polite and attentive.  My main sticking point is the price -- we had a $100 dinner credit from my date's work, but without that, the bill would have come to over $150, even without wine.  I've been to restaurants that might be worth that price -- Farallon is not.\n\nSidenote: My date thought the decor was cool.  I thought it went over the edge into tacky.  Either way, it was certainly different.", "author": "Sarah B."}

The service was quite good, although my server had the unappealing habit of spitting profusely when he talked. But everything else about the restaurant - from the gaudy octopus and squid chandeliers down to the food - impels me to recommend so many other SF restaurants above this one. \n\nThe meal got off to a promising start with the dungeness crab gratin served on bone marrow with black truffles and toast. This was a stunning piece of work - such a triumph in mixing together unlikely ingredients. The seared scallops with white bean ravioli, on the other hand, were what had me thinking that perhaps things weren't going to go my way. The scallops were either not fresh or not properly cooked. Either scenario is unacceptable for a restaurant that purportedly specializes in seafood. \n\nThe whole roasted tai snapper with clams and heirloom tomatoes was good although far from delectable. Finally, the grand finale failure was the grilled ono piquillo pepper sauce and sweet corn. I could've eaten something comparable at Chili's. \n\nThe grape pie with creme fraiche ice cream and orange caramel sauce was thankfully palatable and worth the splurge to the waistline, but good dessert does not make a restaurant exceptional.", "author": "Baochi N."}

The Foie Gras was good (great texture, simply presented, well paired/flavored), but not the best I've had either. Both of the above are geared toward more earthy, subdued flavors, and I prefer a shot of excitement when eating (intense flavors with great complexity). I switched it up this time and went for the Tai Snapper with Gnocchi. The gnocchi was perfectly done, as was the snapper. Perfect texture for both, excellent flavors, but small portions. My lady had the scallops which, again, had an earthy, subdued taste, but still very good. For dessert we had the honey roasted pear, which was a new one for me but a delightful surprise. The mascarpone went perfectly with the butter cake and roasted pear, and it was a very clean, simple, tasty way to end the meal.\n\nService -- Excellent! The staff were very professional, helpful, and attentive without being cumbersome or annoying.\n\nSetting -- The setting is unique, and there are several tastefully themed rooms. Albeit a tad loud due to conversation, it was an inviting, pleasant setting. The chairs, however, had very little cushion in the seat and wore down my hind end as the meal went on. If you're assless like me, consider yourself warned.\n\nVerdict -- Great location (right next to our hotel; next to union square; lots of shopping and food nearby); above average food (especially if you prefer more calm, earthy flavors); excellent service; great setting; small portions, so don't come too hungry.

Still a stunner after all these years. \n\nGreat friendly service from the valet to the hostess to the waiters, it's obvious a lot of training goes into this destination restaurant. \n\nOK, the food: the bear started with seared ahi tuna and I had the butternut squash lasagna. Great tastes with the only detriment being that the pasta was a little too soft for my taste. \n\nFor main courses, the bear had half dungenesse crab served with butter and a lemon aioli while I ordered the perfectly grilled fillet of beef with Stilton cheese, spinach puree and twice baked potatoes. I guess I could take the time to pull up the menu and go for the complete description but just go to the Farallon site, take in the sights, and read the menu completely...that gives you the options of what is served there. \n\nAs my dinner companion says, you don't end a meal like this without a decadent dessert and Farallon again delivered: he had the chocolate blackout cream cake with salted peanuts and I had my standby carrot cake with kumquat marmalade. Yummy! \n\nA fantastic setting, great food, excellent service...go grab a date and head over!", "author": "TJ T."}

We all opted for a separate appetizer..I had a wonderful Mediterranean dungness crab dish with a wonderful white sauce. Two had the Lobster bisque, and one had a scallop dish. All were very happy. We all then shared the royal iced platter of seafood. Was pricey ( $125), but all of the seafood was wonderful. It included 6 oysters on half shell, a whole lobster, dungness crab legs, 3 clams, ceviche, scallop dish. All were served cold with a choice of mignonette or cocktail sauce. Cocktail sauce was full woth horseradish.  It was plenty of food for our party of four. We all had desert as well. I can't remember what the others had, but I had a sticky toffee pudding that was wonderful as well. I don't have a bad thing to say about this place.

I've always wanted to try this place out and I was fairly please with the results.\n\nSome people would say the decor is gaudy or overly done, but I thought it was nicely laid out.  I love how there are so many SF places that look small from the outside and entryway then open up into a large open space.  The lighting was perfect and the seats comfortable.\n\nThe appetizers were great.  I didn't really think much of the salad at first since it looked like they just quartered a head of iceberg lettuce, however the dressing along with a light goat cheese and figs made it absolutely wonderful.  Very refreshing and tasty.  The Smoked salmon was perfectly cooked with a very heavy smokey taste along with a hint of orange citrus.\n\nThe main dishes were equally as tasty.  The stuffed sole was fairly light, but the lobster stuffing was very flavorful, albeit probably due to a generous amount of butter.  The Hawaiian Opah was seasoned and grilled to perfections.  It was described as a fillet, but the tenderness was done like a steak.  The thinly sliced fried onions made it even more delectable.\n\nDessert was a chocolate mouse cake topped off with a butterscotch/toffee ice cream.  Very sweet, and both flavors complimented each other very well.\n\nThe service was absolutely wonderful.  Our waiter was very cordial and attentive.  i was very impressed with how prompt everything was, the patience with explaining the dishes, and the friendly smile.  I really didn't feel we had to ask for anything as he seemed to just know when we might be needing his something.\n\nI'd definitely go back since I fell into the eying everyone else's dish mode.  The fillet looked incredibly good, the tomato bisque is something I crave for, the grilled salmon and halibut looked equally as appetizing as well.\n\nI wish I lived closer to this place, as I'm sure it'd be a great after work place to meet for a drink or some after work oyster shooters.", "author": "Yehoy L."}

Decor is classy and fairly unique - nice and plush seats, jellyfish hanging from the ceiling, romantic atmosphere. Table service was good - timely water refills, polite and warm waiters (albeit food took forever). Seems like it was tough to get a reservation here too - we got a 9pm dinner seating on a Saturday night. The food however, was a far cry from the review we read. We came here because it was recommended by a renown travel book as one of the top 10 places to eat in San Fran. We had a table of five so I would say we ordered enough food to be objective in terms of variety. Salmon was overcooked and I didn't like the fact that bacon bits was served with it. I did not feel the combination was complementary and adding bacon to any kind of food seems like a cop out. Hawaiian ono was served with black bean sauce which I found a little overwhelming in taste. Black bean sauce was overpowering and the fish lacked texture. Seared ahi tuna appy was served with ginger slices - unexciting, to say the least. Entrees took more than a hour to arrive and at 10pm, I can assure you the restaurant was not busy. I am unsure what took them so long but we finally finished dinner at midnight and I didn't even asked for a dessert menu. Overall, quite unimpressed. I will not return - expensive fine dining but rather disappointing in terms of taste.", "author": "Amelia Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-21", "description": "So here is a review for a seafood restuarant from a person that DOES NOT EAT SEAFOOD (except clam chowder). I'm sure I'm not alone and I'm sure I won't be the last of my kind that goes here because a close friend or spouse loves the place or celebrates a special occasion.\nIf I remember correctly, and I do, besides salad there are three items on the menu I had to choose from. Two items were steaks, the other was lamb. Yes, that's it, no chicken, no soup of a non fishy nature, nothing else. One of the steaks was sold very well by our waitress. It was the american kobe beef steak (I forget which cut) with lobster layed on top. I mean she made this piece of meat sound like it was made of gold and since I know kobe, I ordered it. There were only a couple of tiny pieces of lobster on top and if I was a lobster lover I would have been pissed, but yay for me less lobster to choke down... The meat itself was just ok, I've had better american kobe than this so I think it may boil down to you don't go to a seafood restuarant and expect great steak, the cooks just don't prepare enough of it.\nOverall the service was good, especially the seperate bread guy. I asked for an end of the french bread and for the rest of the night he was sneaking ends on my bread plate. That was very cool. The place is also pleasant to be in, nice decor, strange acoustics though as I could hear several conversations from tables in places I wouldn't think to hear anything from. I also thought the little seafood bar up front across from the alcohol bar was cool and different. Only if I liked seafood...", "author": "Chris M."}

The staff seemed like a well oiled machine, one that really worked like clockwork and coming from the F&B industry I really appreciated that.

Once seated I had already gone through the bar menu while waiting for the table was getting pretty stoked (not like I didn't research the heck outta the restaurant before hand). So sat down, and was immediately greeted by the server and had to get another mojito cause I'll say god damn!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-01-19", "description": "After eating at Boulevard on a trip a couple of years ago and having a great meal, when we found out that Farallon was also Pat Kuleto's restaurant, we were pretty excited to try it. I made reservations about 3 weeks in advance and asked for a table in the \"Pool Room\" and wrote in the comments section that my wife and I were celebrating our 19th anniversary. A a couple of days before the trip, Farallon's reservationist called to confirm our reservation and told me that they had reserved us a booth in the \"Pool Room\". We arrived a little early for Happy Hour, and I ordered a margarita and my wife ordered their Hemingway Daiquiri. Mine came out in a glass, hers in a beat up copper and tin cup. I though Hemingway was a pretty rugged guy, so maybe that is their homage to him. Mine was fine, hers was awful. It tasted just like the pickled ginger you get with sushi. Don't get me wrong, with sushi it's a great taste, but I don't think you want to drink a whole cup of it! Come to find out later in the evening after looking at their cocktail list, that the bartender had given her a Moscow Mule. \n\nWe were seated in a booth upstairs overlooking the bar and my wife commented that it looked different in the pictures. After looking around at the cheesy pictures, the slightly dirty resin sea stars stuck on the columns, and the really dirty window covered by fishing nets, I came to the conclusion that this restaurant is really just an upscale Rainforest Cafe. They must not do their cleaning during the day because there were dust bunnies covering the sloped ceiling behind us and covering the air grate right above us. The whole effect is kind of dingy and outdated. \n\nWe were trying to decide what we wanted for wine, and my wife wasn't sure what she wanted for dinner. When I asked our waiter,( who was about 6'4\" and had an annoying habit of standing as close to the table as possible so we had to strain our necks to look up at him), about a particular glass of wine pairing with the black cod. Of course the $8.50 glass I asked about wouldn't pair well with it, but the two most expensive glasses at $18.50 and $24 respectively would go nicely! I decided on a $42 bottle of A to Z Pinot from Oregon and It paired nicely with our selections. \n\nFor dinner we received an amuse of smoked sturgeon mousse with a fried caper and citrus sauce. It was okay, but a little too salty. We split a beet salad with was a little odd. The cheese on it was like cheddar shaved with a vegetable peeler, and then there were quartered beets and a beet \"duxelles\" which was slightly gritty, like the beets weren't washed correctly. \n\nFor entrees, my wife had the black cod and I had the dorade. Both were prepared nicely, but the portion size was 4-5 ounces for both. \n\nFor dessert we had a poached pear which came out kind of shriveled and dry, with a brown butter cake that was also slightly dry. It did have Happy 19th anniversary written in chocolate on the plate though, which was nice. \n\nAll during dinner, service was technically good, but very robotic. There was no warmth, no personality, no effort to make the experience a memorable one. \n\nWhen paying the tab, I put out my credit card and my Passport card. Now, in the interest of fairness, I own a restaurant, and I take Passport. It was my decision to take Passport because I felt it was in the best interest of my restaurant. The owners of Farallon take Passport because, I assume, that it is in the best interest of their restaurant. When our card was picked up,( by a manager I might add), \nshe kind of gave us a weird look, and then was gone for about 10 minutes. When the check came back, I went to total the payment, and the gratuity had already been added. HMMM...what if I didn't feel the service deserved 18% gratuity. There was a section to add additional gratuity, but no place to comment or explain why you felt service didn't deserve an automatic gratuity. I have always tipped at least 20% in the past, but that really stuck in my craw. If the house thinks that their restaurant is so good that they will automatically add the gratuity then so be it. \n\nAs we were leaving we walked through the rest of the restaurant , we saw the room we thought we would be seated in. I asked a server what the room was called. \"Oh\", she said, \"this is the Pool Room\". \n\nKind of figures, doesn't it?", "author": "S. C."}

I had a lovely work dinner here, where every item we ordered was perfectly prepared and full of unique flavors. My usual qualm with ordering cooked seafood/fish is that it is too bland, or uses spices/sauces that I could easily make at home. Not here! My spearfish had a very tasty garlickly coconut sauce accompanied with mussels, and my ceviche trio contained just the right amount of citrus, salt, and accompanying vegetables. We also received outstanding service. Granted, we were a group of almost 20, and we had reserved the semi-private balcony (which I recommend for a group!), but our waiter was very attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu and appropriate wine parings. Our group has some new favorite wines, based on his suggestions.

We were in the city to see a play, two doors away from Farallon and we luckily stopped in to get a quick bite before curtain time.  We were seated at the fresh seafood bar, so we watched the preparation of some GREAT seafood.  Lead chef Robert was working this prep area and was very willing to chat with us as he worked and supervised.  Each of the small dishes that we ordered from the happy hour menu were fantastic.  Six small oysters on the half-shell, for example:  $6.  Nice!  The woman who waited on us was very attentive and informative about the dishes.  This was a VERY wonderful experience.  We have relatives coming to visit, both of whom are foodies and we want to introduce them to this charming 'find'.  BTW, the play (at The Playhouse) was exceptional, as well!  After the play, we walked around Union Square, watched outside ice-skating on the outside rink....and felt like tourists, though we just live across The Bay.   What an evening.  Thank you Farallon.  Thank you, San Francisco.", "author": "Robert E."}

Waitress was very nice, not too \"in-our-face\" neither \"where-the-hell-are-you\". It got a bit loud at some point but common, give a brake to businessman after half a bottle of wine :) Restaurant became full in a blink of an eye. By 8 I did not see open tables. \nWe set in front of the kitchen where minimum six chefs at any given time were running around and creating their magic. See food bar had quite a selection of ocean creatures: lobsters, oysters, muscles and that is at least in few varieties of each. Platters that they make are to dye for... look wise:) amount of seafood wise - hm.... - lets just say that they looked Supper nice  What else would you expect from a very nice restaurant. He he  \nMenu:\nMenu, at the first glance, seemed to me too small and too expansive as well as the wine list seemed too long and even more expansive :) BUT: after few minutes looking around I got more comfortable with the atmosphere and accepted the fact that it is not a fast food restaurant. \n\nFood: \nBack to our table: my wife got their prefixed menu (3 courses) and I went with \"KONA BLUE KAMPACHI TATAKI\" for salad + \"SEARED NEW ZEALAND TAI SNAPPER\" main dish (recommendation of our waitress) \nKampachi: that was my first time trying the dish - Loved it!!! Somen noodle salad was excellent with the fish.  Nice, clean, fresh taste of all ingredients. Nothing was blending or overpowering. Yum!!!\nSnapper:  supper tender, excellently accompanied with coconut curry, without any fishy taste and with one hell of a crust!!! Bravo and compliments to the chef!!!\nI have tried the halibut that my wife got: it had more of a home-cooking-like taste, which I would not like in such restaurant. It was okay when it was hot, but when it cooled down - fish got dry .... \nWe also shared her dessert \"BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE CUSTARD CAKE Gianduja sauce, vanilla bean chantilly, hazelnut crunch\" - yeah - too many words: it was very tasty. It was not too sweet but chocolaty enough to make a finishing point at it's highest.   \nTo finish all up:\nAt first it looked a bit small amount of food but I got out of table full, satisfied, happy and feeling glad that I chose this place.\nDefinitely would come back and definitely would recommend the place.", "author": "Alex S."}

The prefixe menu was absolutely magificent, it started with a trio of fish, the salmon melted on our tongues, the ceviche was absolutely perfect and the ono, which we had never had before was absolutely one of the best fishes we've ever had.  The second, a warm crab cake on top of a roasted heirloom tomato was just delicious, but the star of that course was the duck fat fried crouton, we could have eated a dozen of those!  The third, a perfectly cooked piece of seabass, nothing exotic, but miraculously, the cooks pulled off an outstanding dish and made the seabass the absolute star of that course.  The fourth, a med rare piece of steak, perfectly done, then before dessert, we were treated to a cheese course with a wonderful cheddar, a walnut bread, with baby grapes and almonds, then of course, dessert...wow..., a beautiful buttermilk strawberry shortcake, with an \"over the top\" chantilly cream.  All of the wine PERFECTLY matched each course, these guys really  know their food.   What can we say about the staff?  Friendly yet very professional, knowledgeable and unpretentious.

He went on and on about this incredible restaurant and how it had been the highlight of their romantic evening.  I was envious and dreamed of a day I would be able to eat at great restaurants like that.\nFast forward several years and lo and behold, I ended up moving to the bay area.

From the first moment I entered and took in all the wonderful under-sea decor, to the exemplary service, to every mouth-watering bite of each course, it had all been worth the wait and worth every penny (and yes, this place does cost a pretty penny).  No, this isn't a place I can come to every weekend, although I wish I could.  It's a special place for a special occasion, at least for most of us who still have to work for a living.

But only some of the food was as good as it should be for this price and with this reputation.\n\nThere were four of us so got to taste a lot of dishes. To my surprise, the star of the evening was the soft shell crab, something I don't think I'd ever order but one of my tablemates did. Presentation was great. Served on a coaster-sized duck crouton, stacked with a slice of broiled tomato, it was so perfectly crisped on the outside and delicately flavored on in the inside, it was a revelation. Too often, soft shell crab just tastes fried. This had great depth.\n\nLittle gems salad with smoked trout was very good but a really paltry portion (Waitress warns up front that portions are \"petite,\" but c'mon, we're talking mostly lettuce here). My octopus appetizer was very nicely cooked, very tender and toasted pine nuts were a nice complement. Summer melon salad was just OK.\n\nMain courses were a bit of a letdown. Halibut was in a pretty unexciting sauce. Both the accompanying shelling beans and squash were very bland. Fish was well cooked, but overall dish was a bore. Salmon was also ehh. The sweet corn ravioli on the side was richly flavored, but the apple smoked bacon just didn't go with the salmon. Maybe pancetta would have worked better, but those two tastes together just didn't work for me (even though bacon usually improves everything!). Friend's sturgeon kept up the trend. Nicely cooked fish in an environment that didn't take the dish to another level.\n\nSeeming to find a lot of places these days where the appetizers outshine the entrees. Kitchen offered no specials on this night, which was disappointing. A seafood restaurant should always be finding something amazingly fresh every day to offer as a special.

It's an interesting mix of people that were all dressy hoochied up like me, and people who are just going to have a casual expensive dinner.\n\nAccording to our waiter that evening, the menu changes frequently, with a focus on what is fresh and seasonal.  We had the lobster \"roll\" for an appetizer, which was probably my favorite course of the evening - lobster on a brioche round with a ridiculous amount of melted clarified butter on the side.  I dream about that lobster brioche with a little saliva pooling at the corner of my mouth as I write this.  The squash apple soup was quite good, as was my filet and the bf's very fresh Thai snapper.  The side dishes and flavor pairings with the entrees are interesting and tasty, the Thai snapper coming with chorizo and creme fraiche, and my steak served with a delicious potato gratin (thinly mandolined potatoes meant lots of creamy layers) and foie gras, which I avoided completely but my boyfriend happily gobbled up.  Service is a little slow, but it's nice to have a relaxing dinner in a large booth without being continuously pestered, too.\n\nSpecial note must be made of Farallon's exceptional bathroom lighting.  Forget the jellyfish lighting fixtures.   You go into that bathroom and you will never look better in your entire life.  Remember that video where Vanessa Williams was saving the best for last and you watched it and were like, damn, that bitch has some fantastic lighting?!  Preternatural beauty that she is aside, I wanted those little reflective light-y things in the pupils of my eyes, too.  The bathroom gives you those elusive pupil circle things as well as a soft golden glow.  Go in and you will find it hard to return to the harsh lighting of reality.

I had to ask for more napkins several times.  They didn't even offer to cover a round of drinks or maybe throw in coffee or anything.  They pretended like nothing happened.  Than, we ordered a wine tasting coarse where they poured 5 different wines and gave you a taste of each.  The glasses had so much lint on them it was disgusting.  You could choke on that much lint.  I'm not just saying a few pieces of lint, it was covered in lint that you had to shake it off.  We had to ask them to send them back and get us some glasses with less dust on them.  Overall this place was pretty bad and very expensive which is a deadly combination.  OK food, horrendous service, rude and inconsiderate wait staff, high prices....but other than that it was fantastic!!", "author": "V C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-30", "description": "Farallon, named after the islands off the coast of San Francisco, is a premier, albeit expensive, dining destination for seafood lovers.  I parked south of Market Street and walked down Powell Street to get to the restaurant.  I immediately remembered why I generally avoid this street.  It is saturated with tourists, which attracts the freakshows.  I nearly got accosted by this scary-looking girl walking in the opposite direction.  Her mangled face was covered in piercings and chains, accompanied by a Fiona Apple \"this world is bullsh*t\" expression.  She sorta reminded me of that freak that appeared on the first episode of this season's American Idol (the one with glitter all over her face who shared a studio with her mom).  I merely glanced in her direction - she took immediate notice, stopped in her tracks and glared back at me, as if ready to start a fight.  I just pretended I was looking at something else and kept walking....faster.  As if I weren't already edgy enough, I had to keep dodging bums left and right, including one that yelled \"BEEP BEEP!!!\" as I crossed the street in front of him.  \n\nFood:  4 stars.   Don't bother coming here for the $45 prix fixe menu, which is available before 6:30pm.  You don't get a choice and what they offer seemed unappealing (port poached red d'anjou pear, wild rice stuffed sonoma quail, and sticky toffee pudding) compared to the rest of the menu.  Be prepared, however, to pay through the roof for an a la carte meal (entrees are priced in the $30's).  For starters, we had the seared kona blue kampachi (very nice and hearty dish, accompanied by a tasty truffle potato raviolo, lambs lettuce and caramelized onion jus) and paprika braised octopus (nice texture and blended well with the garlic vinaigrette).   For main courses, my friend had the tasty seared hawaiian butterfish, cooked to perfection and garnished with Maine lobster relish and Meyer lemon brown butter (she had an upset stomach afterwards, but it was worth it - more on that later).  The fondant potato that accompanied it reminded me of eating a baked potato (skin and all), only slightly crunchier. I had the hearty roasted maryland striped bass, which had a subtle taste but combined well with the flavors from the butternut squash galette, wilted escarole and pinot noir gastrique.  For dessert, I was blown away by the warm pear butterscotch bread pudding with vanilla bean ice cream, almond butter crunch, and Maraska maraschino cherry syrup.  I couldn't get enough of the little bits of almond butter crunch.  My friend had the gateau royale (flourless chocolate cake, chocolate crisp, and milk chocolate mousse), which was a little too rich for my taste.\n\nService:  3 stars.   Service was a bit disappointing given the restaurant's caliber.  My friend arrived first and was already seated by the time I arrived.  When I checked in, the hostess told me that someone would be here shortly to take me to my table.  I waited 5-10 minutes, which seems like an eternity when you're hungry.  This is generally not an issue if the restaurant was busy, but the hostess could have gotten one of the idle servers to take me or she could have done it herself.  When we asked our server for recommendations, he made it a point to suggest not ordering the butterfish because it doesn't sit well with some people digestively (then why is it on the menu?).  When we told him that we've had butterfish before (at Roy's) and never had problems, he asked us if the restaurant actually called it butterfish because some people get it mixed up with walu (which we've also had before at Aqua).  At the time, I felt a little insulted because we mentioned to him that we had tried butterfish and felt like that message was falling on deaf ears.  Now I understand that he was trying to watch out for us because he's done some heavy research on the fish.  I guess it would have been better if he just gave us a minor disclaimer about the fish and let my friend order it without having serious reservations about it....  Plus it planted the seed in her head, which is why she probably felt sick later.  Additionally, the timing of the service was off.  Our first course was served before we even finished our amuse bouche, while there was a long lag between the appetizers and entrees.  The sommelier was kinda funny and endearing at least,  even mentioning at one point that he would hop on one foot for us if we asked him to.  \n\nAtmosphere:  5 stars.  The grand decor, accented by the jellyfish chandeliers, kelp columns, and caviar-embossed stairways, epitomizes the seafood experience.  Given the high-priced menu and older look of the restaurant, I expected the clientele to be older.  I was not disappointed.\n\nHits:  Paprika braised octopus, seared hawaiian butterfish, warm pear butterscotch bread pudding.\n\nMisses:  Gateau royale, inconsistent service.\n\nIf You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like:  Aqua, Nick's Cove", "author": "Keith C."}

The scallops were really good but the risotto rice was undercooked and hard. The waiter claimed it was al dente but I know the difference between that and raw rice.

I enjoyed the fruits of the sea plate and the heart of romaine salad, but was disappointed with my main entree of pan seared striped bass. The fish was a bit over cooked and was under seasoned, but the hand cut paperdelle that accompanied the dish was delicious.

We tried some amazing cocktails to start with then some very reasonably priced & delicious California caviar, then moved onto a delicious butter lettuce salad, then had some yummy softshell crab & grilled octopus which was so delicious! The only part I wasn't crazy about was my main dish; branzino with a bacon hash, which sounded amazing but for my taste, was way too \"bacon-ey\"; I just thought it made the fish, which was simply seared & would have been great, but then the bacon hash made it too greasy for my palate. My husband loved it though so it was all good. The wine was amazing! My waitor recommended a delicious pinot noir to go with the fish & it was perfect. The dessert was probably the best part, I had panna cotta with what seemed like candied mango, so delish! Our friend tried this amazing Japanese style cheesecake, which was so light & airy it was unlike any cheesecake I've tried, so yummy!

We were initially seated at a small table adjacent to the kitchen which got a bit noisy as much of the staff hung out around the area.  This irritated me a little at first, especially since there were many open small booths that were much more private and intimate which is what we were looking for.  Normally, I'll acquiesce to the determination of the host/hostess of where my party should be seated, but this time I requested of our attentive waiter that we be moved to one of the more intimate booths which was a good decision.  The decor and ambiance throughout the restaurant were appealing and unique with its custom jellyfish chandeliers.  It is definitely a nice date spot if the food were better.  The trouble we both had with the food throughout the entire meal, appetizers through dessert, was that the flavors were either overwhelming or did not have the right balance.  (Although, there may have already been a slight bit of bitterness in my mouth due to the fact that I was missing out on Super Bowl XLII.  J/K!)", "author": "Erich D."}

The restaraunt was once an underground, indoor swimming pool.  One almost feels like a sea urchin in an enchanted underwater landscape.  However, I would have liked the menu to be less complicated, contrasting the intricate decor.  Dishes seemed to have more layers than urchins have bumps.

If you've read any of my reviews before, you know I'm not a seafood fan by any means, and in fact, I'm such a carnivore--it's ridiculous!  I did, however, quite enjoy my dining experience at Farallon.  My boyfriend and I met his friend and his friend's parents for dinner at 5:45pm.  They were seated though the entire party had arrived...I like that cause I hate to keep the entire party waiting when we're late.  \n\nThe ambiance was sweet.  As you enter their jelly fish floating from the ceiling, a seafood bar with fresh crabs, clams and other shellfish, and lovely, welcoming hostesses (which by the way had my boyfriend in all a twitter...all tongue tied when he told them we had reservations).  We sit in one of the booths that appears to have a clam or oyster motif.  The seat is plush and comfy.  \n\nI checked out the menu beforehand, and knew that between my boyfriend and I we'd get the steak and the ahi tuna.  The other fish such as the halibut seemed very interesting though.  For an appetizer by boyfriend and I split the seared Mediterranean rouget, which our waiter had the kitchen split on two plates.  The rouget fish is apparently a small red fish that gets its color and taste from all the shellfish it eats.  (Our very knowledgeable water told me this.)  I enjoyed the buttery texture of the fish fillet, the simple taste of the zucchini blossom and the zestiness of the Himalyan red rice (or did the zestiness come from the sauces that were drizzled on top of the fish?...hard to tell because I make perfect bites of the everything on my plate).  The ahi tuna I ordered as an entree was only okay as it wasn't seasoned enough and the olive topping was too strong of a flavor that I soon became to dislike. I enjoyed the baby arugula salad for its simple vinaigrette dressing was a nice addition to my palate.  The fillet of beef was nice (glad my boyfriend gave me half)--tender and well seasoned...though it came w/ a shrimp paste that I wasn't crazy about.  \n\nBy this point in the meal, I was stuffed, but we had time to kill before our movie, and who am I kidding I can't resist dessert and coffee!  I could have been fine with sharing, but no one wanted to share the summer berry pudding with me.  I was very pleasantly surprised by it as it appeared as a bread pudding, which I adore!  The drizzle of raspberry sauce, fresh berries atop, and the scoop of vanilla ice cream made it a dream--perfect combination of tastes.  With my coffee to accompany it, I nearly ate the entire thing, forgetting how stuffed I was even prior to dessert.  \n\nService was excellent.  Water glasses always filled, wait staff checked up on us frequently, fresh bread served twice during the meal, knowledgeable of the menu, and overall quite friendly.\n\nI left the restaurant three pounds heavier; my pants closures almost busting!  Again, I'm not a seafood fan, but with good fish done right (and desserts and wine too), I could be...or maybe it was just Farallon.", "author": "Marie B."}

Our orders were taken as soon as we sat down and there was hardly any wait for food or drinks.  The fish we had was some of the freshest I've ever eaten, and that to me completely justifies the price on it's own.  We had the shrimp and scallop shu mai for an appetizer, and had the striped bass and halibut for the entrees.  The only thing I must say is that the bass had a little more of a smokey flavor than I prefer, however no one else at the table that sampled the dish had any complaints.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-06-15", "description": "Farallon delivers a truly unique dining experience; they treat you like a king, and complement their exemplary service with excellent seafood dishes and a memorable dining atmosphere.\n\nI went to Farallon about two years ago for a birthday.  The hostess held a few gifts I had brought in beforehand, and delivered them at the right time.  This was the first of many very memorable interactions with the staff.  The food was incredible; I had the Ono and was able to steal a taste of the Halibut.  \n\nWhat really stood out about our dinner was Farallon's top-rate Sommelier.  Even though this experience was years ago, our Sommelier's attention to detail and impeccable customer service is still memorable today.  I brought in a few bottles of special wine for a birthday party; we started with Krug and then went to a Havens Albarino that a friend had given me.  As we were enjoying our wine, the Sommelier brought out a few tastes of a Spanish Albarino from Rias Biaxas (where most Albarinos are from, as that is the original locale of the grape), and described how each Albarino was different, and how they would go well with our different dishes.  Now I've seen good Sommeliers before, but an on-the-fly complement to two whitefish dishes, with a unique varietal nonetheless, was remarkable.  Not an impossible task for a stellar Sommelier, but taking the time to really think about your clientele with that level of detail is the mark of a true professional.\n\nWe ordered a taste of Chateau d'Yquem to finish off the night.  Given the hefty price tag for a two ounce taste ($50...which is reasonable for a good year of d'Yquem), we decided to split it two ways.  He arrives with two generous \"tastes\" clearly surpassing two ounces each.  Sure it cost Farallon a few bucks to do this, but the end result of creating a story I'm still telling years later makes the small cost more than worth it, and will be \"accretive\" for Farallon in the long run.\n\n\nP.S.  Why doesn't Yelp's spell checker have \"Sommelier\" in the dictionary?  Are you guys serious?", "author": "Nate H."}

I really loved it and was excited to go back last Tuesday. The restaurant itself is gorgeous, I love the mosaic tile ceiling. We had a concert to go to so we only had time to get apps and desserts. We told our waiter and he was totally nice about it. Sometimes you get a little attitude when you tell staff something like that but ours was super nice about it and made some excellent recommendations to help us save time. Lou, our waiter even gave us updates on what time it was. He totally rocked! One of the best waiters I've ever had. We got two shellfish bisques and the butter roasted lobster with english pea ravioli and fennel to share. The soup was good and came with a cognac cream. The only thing I didn't like about the soup was that the cognac was really strong in the cream (that might just be me though as I tend to really be able to taste alcohol) and the soup really tasted like shellfish. Like the actual shell on the fish. I still finished it though. The butter roasted lobster was amazing. The lobster was really good and pretty tender and my favorite part of the dish was the english pea ravioli. SO good. The pasta tasted really fresh and didn't have any of that gummy taste you often find in pasta. Delicious!\nI was SUPER excited to try the desserts here. We got the garnet cherry cheesecake and I was ecstatic to find that they had fried banana cream pies. I love fried bananas and I love banana cream pie, sign me up! Both desserts were really good. I particularly liked the pistachio tuile on the cheesecake. The fried banana cream pies were heavenly, with a delicious dulce de leche and an el rey chocolate sauce. The desserts were definitely the best part of the meal. Overall a really good dining experience.", "author": "Cathy T."}

While the decor in the bar area up front feels a little bit like the entrance to a Disney undersea ride, it opens up into a elegant dining room in the back with large, vaulted ceilings.  My salad with beets to start was very nice, though a little on the small side.  My salmon entree was excellent.  Their wine list was expansive and expensive - I hate it when nice restaurants gouge you on wine.  My boss, who was dining with us, thumbed his nose at the somalier (and shredded his local wine credibility in the process) by ordering a bottle of red from Long Island.  As in Long Island, NY.  Frankly, it wasn't very good and I'm surprised they had it on the list.  Anyway, on to dessert - my sour cherry sundae was off the charts good.

I notice that other reviewers have remarked on irregular service; yet the serious problem here is the inconsistent kitchen.  Overcooked fish is a sin, especially at these prices, and dishes ordered together should be delivered together so you and your friends can eat together, which is why you're there, sharing a meal, and yet Farallon is not managing to do these things well.  The management isn't managing; the wait staff are out of their depth, and the kitchen is not under control.

I am so happy to report that this place absolutely did not disappoint. When we fist arrived, were seated immediately (which I love). When we sat down, we were able to take in all the beautiful decor. The restaurant is wonderfully circular shaped, which makes for a unique and surprisingly serene experience. Our very learned and attentive waiter suggested a wonderful Rose, that complimented everything we ate, with perfection. We started off with a smoked salmon moose amuse bouche and from that first bite, everything was a glorious adventure. For our first course, we ordered the calamari and the ahi tuna. Both were amazing and left me wanting more. For the main course, we had the scallops-- were honestly the best scallops I have ever had, and the striped sea bass--which was served with purple potatoes (I love anything purple!) and left me with a big smile on my face. Usually I am not a dessert person, but because the portions are rather small, and the desert items were raved about in other posts, we decided to give one a try. As our waiter had done such a wonderful job with his previous selections for our meal, we asked him for his recommendation. He told us to go with the grapefruit and rhubarb pie with white chocolate ice cream on the side. He explained that he did not like grapefruit OR rhubarb in general, but that they all married together and went with our wine perfectly. I felt that his distaste for grapefruit alone was reason enough to trust his choice and I am SO glad we did. The dessert was phenomenal...and the white chocolate ice-cream; let's just say I will still be dreaming about that tonight!", "author": "Tiauna G."}

The service was TERRIBLE, and the food was not much better.  For the very large amount of money we spent, this place should have been off the charts in every way.\n\nWe went on a weekday night, and I think we might have been the only women in the place.  The entire resaturant was filled with large tables of guys in business suits.  I felt like we were at a convention.  We barely ever saw our server the whole night.  I think we were well into our third round of small plates before we got any wine.  We had to ask three times for some Pellegrino.  The special, a steelhead ceviche, was so fishy, it was almost rank.  We had to send it back because none of us could stand to eat it.  The crab bakes were deep-fried balls that could have come from Long John Silvers.  The single scallop that you get when you order the scallop dish was cold and sitting on a pool of sauce that tasted like pure congac--it was horrible. They did manage to remember to bring us our coffee, but not until after the bill had been paid.  To top it all off, they gave my friend a hard time about getting her coat because she'd left her coat-check thing at the table.  I don't recommend this place to anyone--there are so many other seafood places in San Francisco that are SO much better.", "author": "erin r."}

We were sat in a hole in the wall area near the kitchen doors. The place is dim but when I looked up into the light, I basically saw what appeared to be fruit flies flying around above our table. Nice, huh? I don't even remember exactly what we ordered, but I'm pretty sure it was fish of some sort. We had some cabbage type soup I think it was.

Overall, I'd like to give them 3.5, so I'm going with 3. It's really quite average overall. We had a nice round table in the middle of the dining room all to ourselves, so that was quite comfortable. But, the place is noisy and a bit overwhelming with a lot of activity. We had the green salad with cheddar and croutons which was quite good, and actually the best part of the meal. For my main course, I had the Dover Sole cooked in parchment and the bf had the Filet Mignon. They cut open the parchment paper at the table and \"dumped\" the contents on the plate. It honestly didn't look very appetizing. And, the \"crab sabayon\" that the waiter wanted to pour over the fish just tasted like a cold sauce of butter, wine and bits of crab. I think a sabayon might actually have and/or supposed to have eggs in it. Anyhow, it wasn't anything special.  The fish was really bland, and I wasn't a fan of the artichokes and/or parsnips that accompanied the fish. The filet mignon was apparently pretty good, but the creamed spinach and onion rings (!) were very average. The meat was also nearly bloody and it was ordered \"medium\". Overall, it was an average meal, but for the huge price we paid (close to $200 for 2 of us), I'd say we didn't get our money's worth.

I've always enjoyed their food and ambiance, but never had a chance to really enjoy dessert because I was always too full.  So, when my dinner companion and I were looking for a dessert, our concierge at the Grand Hyatt suggested we go to Farallon since the pastry chef had received numerous accolades and awards.  What a GREAT suggestion!  I had the chocolate malted crunch dessert (forgot the name, but can't forget the taste) and my dining companion had the carrot cake.  The chocolate dessert was ethereal and rich at the same time.  The chocolate ganache was scrumptious and in combination with the mousse and vanilla quenelle of ice cream with flecks of gold leaf and crystal sugar, it was a feast for the eyes and the palate.  The recommended carrot cake was just as scrumptious.  It was moist with a rich, but not cloyingly sweet icing.  It paired wonderfully with the cream cheese ice cream, salted pecans and kumquat marmalade.  At $10 each a pop, it was worth every single penny.

The raw bar is great and the ceviche constantly changes- I had the petrale sole that night, which was very light and refreshing.  GF had the mushroom & crab bisque, which tasted like Thanksgiving thanks to the wonderful truffle oil!  A little heavy though, so if you are going for a light meal you might want something else.  Great presentation though- they bring a bowl of crab and a pot of the bisque, after which the waiter pours the bisque into your bowl for you.\n\nHad the thai snapper for dinner, which was the highlight of the meal for me.  It was crisp and buttery, but not overwhelming.  Good sized portions, but won't make you sick.  Lemongrass leeks & potatoes made a nice side to compliment the snapper, similarly light and buttery.\n\nGF had the petrale & beef ravioli, which both were good but not great.  Ravioli was probably a bit better; the sole was very well-prepared, just nothing really popped out for me with the dish.\n\nPassed on dessert, but they all looked great and smelled even better.\n\nService is superb- the waiter was very helpful with getting us comfortable with all the different dishes.

My last trip had me scratching my head.  I ordered the sashimi plate(18.00).  It was thin slices of sashimi, three of them and very thin, a garnish of greens(wasnt sure what they were, and little dabs of fresh sardine.  I assumed that if different ingredients are put on a plate, they are meant to eat together.  Well, the Sardine bits completely over powered the sashimi and the greens did nothing to enhance the sashimi. That dish was nothing short of a disaster.  Im baffled as to how that plate made it to my table.  It was that bad.  My second dish was the fresh monterey calamari.  Another disaster.  The calamari is sauteed in a slightly smoky broth, with some english peas and some nyoki.  The peas were very overpowering, I could not even taste the calamari, and some red pepper flaked were added which again, were too over powering.  Another dish that shoud never have left the kitchen.  Im not sure what is going on with the chef at farallon, but there is a serious lack of attention going on in the kitchen.  My duck entree was delicious, as was the fettucini and linguine appetizers,  The seabass entree and chicken dishes were also very tasty.  Service was a tad slow but efficient.  I like this place and hope they get it together in the kitchen.  When two out of the three plates you order are terrible, something is amiss.", "author": "victor j."}

I sat at the oyster bar, inquisitively staring at the coquillages on display a bit everywhere and happily chatting with another customer, a charming young lady, who was sitting next to me. Wild mushroom bisque to start: simple, creamy, light, perfect compound of flavours. Seared Georges Bank scallops, truffled potato ravioli, shaved fennel salad, black truffle-lobster brodo followed. Perfect texture of the scallops and tasty fishy brodo, but I was a little disappointed by the three-but-large ravioli which were a bit overcooked (1 star less, inexcusable for a 27$ dish!).   The dessert, a warm Bolzano apple custard cake accompanied by delicious fior di capra ice cream, was awesome, fully worth its 10$. The total amounted to 70$ (beer and tax+tip included), definitely not cheap but justified (a part from the overcooked ravioli, grrrrr).

However, if you've decided to splurge, I mean, REALLY splurge, and enjoy every bit of it, there are few establishments that are as fanciful as Farallon.  Let me show you how to really have fun at this place and really, really indulge.\r\n\r\nAs you're seated, order a bottle of Billecart Salmon Rose.  Mull over the hors d'oeuvre menu, but be sure to indulge in a large platter of oysters, at least a dozen per person, or if you order the little Kumamoto or Olympia, two dozen per person.  Alternatively, you can get a platter of seafood appetizer that gives you a heap of shrimps, crabs, lobsters, oysters and such.\r\n\r\nThe soup and main dishes seem to change daily, so I'd ask one of the highly knowledgeable wait staff for advise and recommendations.  If you have run out of the champagne, order another bottle, or move onto a different bottle, a richer one like Roederer Cristal.\r\n\r\nFor dessert, choose from one of the most decadent dessert wine list around.  This is one of few establishments which pours the venerable Chateau d'Yquem by the (small) glass.  For a while, they were pouring the vintage 1990, which is considered one of the finest in the recent years.  If you have a good-sized company, order a whole bottle, or better yet, bring one in with you.\r\n\r\nThe menu also apologetically includes some meat dishes and vegetarian dishes.  However, if you are ever afraid of seafood, this really isn't the kind of place for you as the decor itself, about which enough has been said, will cause you to break into hives, anyway.\r\n\r\nStill, for those who love, no, I mean _adore_ seafood in a fanciful setting, there really is just no place other than Farallon.  Sure, if you follow my advice, it's hard to go below $200 / person, though its prix pixe with paired wines is a very good deal.\r\n\r\nI too have to warn you that, there is no point of going to Farallon and be stingy about it.  Perhaps some of the less than wonderful reviews at Yelp are a result of that.  This place is about fanciful indulgence in all senses.\r\n\r\nFor one of these special moments with a good reason to celebrate, with a comfortable credit limit, it's just an experience like no other.", "author": "Anonymous M."}

For my friend, he had the branzino (They give you an entire fish, not just two bits! Generous portion size).  The first branzino we had to send it back because it was under cooked. The second one, they did it right and it was fully cooked. The fish was great. For dessert, I had the frozen tangerine sorbet and this dessert is out of this world. As for wine, our waiter was very helpful and picked 2 bottles out for us. One white and one red. Both delicious. \n\nWhat does this mean? If you go to Farallon, Try the following:\n1.

Not a typical crab cake in that there was no breading - all crab meat.   We also shared the hot smoked alaskan salmon - nothing like \"lox\" and it was delicious.  The portions are not large, which they tell you, but are of quality.  We then shared the scallops for a main course which we also thought were  very good. The flavors are not overpowering yet accent the food.  Also the food tends to be very rich by nature so the smaller portions and lighter flavors worked well for us.

In my humble opinion it is fun and adds a great deal of character to the whole experience, but I can see how it could be perceived as verging on if not totally on the kitsch side. \nDecor aside we had a very pleasant dinner here, enjoying wine and fish alike, with a cocktail to start as we waited to be seated at our table. \nAtmosphere is certainly not lacking here, and there is the fantastic ability to go dressed in your shopping clothes or to dress it up in the classic little black dress, always a big plus in my eyes - sometimes you just want to eat and sometimes to make a night of it! \nBeyond the personal dinner, I have also dealt with this restaurant for work purposes, hosting a rather important dinner for some of our top clients in one of their lovely themed rooms. While there is a set menu, it is set by you, and plenty to chose from as you can limit or add to the choices at your leisure for a price, and a bar or simply wine menu is also an option. It was a good choice and our clients (many from the east cast and midwest) enjoyed it immensely. So for personal or business purposes, this is a restaurant well worth checking out.", "author": "Michelle C."}

We rushed out of my place and had more then enough time until we hit the bay bridge valentines traffic, or \"love traffic\" as i like to call it. My GF called the Farallon and told them we were running a behind, the hostess said \"no problem\". After getting the car parked, we finally arrived at 6:30. It was valentines, the place was packed, i was certain we had lost our tables and was already starting to review my choices at mcdonalds. I told the hostess my name, and she said \"good thing you called and told us you were running late, and that makes all the difference!\". Next thing i know, we are seated at our tables and enjoying the awesome under the sea decor. Our waiter was extremely helpful and agreed that since we had a show at 8, he would make sure we got our food quickly. We had ordered the stuffed calamari, AWESOME!, I had the petrale sole, my GF had scallops, and we split the blood orange creme brulee for dessert.

The service has always been impeccable and the seafood is perfect.  I don't get the last comment that this is supposed to be a french restaurant....I think of it as a seafood restaurant.  And as a seafood restaurant there is nothing 'Disney' about it, except for maybe the decor?  The decor is whimsical (light fixtures shaped like jellyfish, paitings of sea turtles swimming through the flooded restaurant) but I enjoy it and think the decor is beautiful.\n\nMy last visit we had drinks at the bar before sitting down to dinner. The bartender offered to make me up a cocktail (ie., one not on the menu).  That's how I tasted the 20th century - a retro cocktail named for a train that used to run on the East Coast (back when train travel was sophisticated and classy).  It was delicious and I really enjoyed that the bartender took the time to suggest the drink.  This restaurant employs real bartenders and I appreciate it.\n\nIf you like shellfish I recommend the seafood platter.  The 'grand' size would serve 3 or 4 as main course, the smaller size is good for 2 or 3.  This platter has yummy shrimp, crab, lobster and oysters. \n\nI've also enjoyed the wine selection and dessert.  All in all this restaurant makes for a lovely celebration dinner, even when all you want to celebrate is 'hey, it's Thursday'.\n\nIt is a bit expensive.

Also, the manager was nice, but other than that the food was tasteless and expensive and very very salty. NONE of us could eat it. In addition, my cake at the end was cut and thrown into the box and was so smashed that we couldnt even eat it afterwards. it was destroyed :( In addition, one lady server was mean through out the entire night. but i figured, the restaurant cant  control that...anyway, this is the reason why im giving it a two star. it is expensive, but the service and the food we ate wasnt that good. the only reason i chose this place was the simple fact that it was romantic and cozy and classy....other than that my food experience wasnt good at all...", "author": "Ladyinred D."}

From the moment you enter, your eye will be delighted by the magnificent and whimsical Jacques Cousteau meets Disney interior decor, and amused by the jellyfish chandeliers. Servers who are on top of this culinary pampering enhance the flow of the food to your table. I was there for Dine About Town on Saturday for lunch (aka Rain About Town), a nice 3 course prix fixe bargain at $21.95, considering that Farallon can run you about $58. No choices here, the starter was a butternut squash soup with pumpkin seed oil, which tasted quite nice and perfectly suited the rainy, cold weather outside. The entree was a roasted Hawaiian mahi mahi with almond and meyer lemon relish, flageolet (immature French green kidney beans, the name comes from the French word for a small flutelike instrument, pronounced fla-juh-lay) beans, and arugula pistou (a French vegetable soup). The relish made the whole dish, which was very good. Dessert was outstanding: a pumpkin upside down cake with bourbon vanilla bean caramel and vanilla chantilly (sweetened whipped cream). The caramel was drizzled in a circle around the cake, and it was amazing. It almost matches the dessert I had at Farallon two years ago, which was so good I wrote it down: an apple cake with calvados (an apple liqueur) caramel, vanilla anglaise, and vanilla chantilly, one of the best desserts I have ever had. The other items that year were a sweet potato soup with hazelnut oil, and a seared Hawaiian mahi mahi with French green lentils (du Puy I hope), braised red chard, and mushroom duxelles jus. Executive chef Emily Luchetti is amazing, and her desserts outshine even the elegant fin fare of Chef/Owner Mark Franz.

This was my third visit to Farallon.\n\nPat Kuleto's under-the-sea/art nouveau decor reflects a very strong vision, with splashy jellyfish light fixtures over the bar and  a sort of coral reef approach to the structures dividing the booths and tables. Some will love it; others will find it crosses the border to Disneyfied kitsch. The booths are comfortable and the lighting adequate but romantic. During our visit the restaurant was full and lively without feeling overcrowded or overheated. We could hear each other without raising our voices. \n\nThe hosts were accommodating about our party's staggered arrival. Once we were seated, the  service did not miss a beat.  It was smooth and professional without being stuffy. \n\nI had read many reviews asserting that portions were small but did find that to be the case myself. Compared to a truck stop pancake breakfast or the massive piles of mediocre food some of the restaurants at Fisherman's Wharf serve, yes, the portions were on the small side. I thought they were more than satisfying and appropriate to the type of restaurant, and I  am no size 2 supermodel. \nMaybe I felt so full because the bread and butter so were wonderful that  I ate a lot of bread--and they were constantly refilling our bread plates. \n\nMy husband and I shared our dishes so I got to try six items plus the complimentary amuse-bouche plus dessert. The food was never less than highly competent, but a couple of the dishes really did not hit the \"wow\" level you hope for at these prices. The menu changes constantly so comments on individual items are of limited value, but here goes: The beet puree (that's the best term I can find for it) came out on individual tasting spoons and brought great promise with it--a gorgeous golden color and wonderful explosion of flavor, and I dislike beets. The dungeness crab salad first course was bland in color and flavor. My husband's shrimp parfait with avocado was much more attractive and tasty. The second course hickory smoked salmon was quite nice, with strong but not overwhelming salty, smoky flavor and pleasantly moist in the middle. The crab cakes (not to be confused with the crab salad) were also good. The Hawaiian Ono the third course was served with beautiful vegetable accompaniments and a nicely flavored sauce. This was the strongest dish of the lot to my taste. My husband had the Mediterranean Branzino and we both enjoyed that as well. I ordered the Baked Alaska to share with the table and was not thrilled with it: the meringue was rubbery rather than airy on the inside and crisp on the outside, and the combination of extremely rich chocolate ice cream and extremely rich chocolate cake was excessive. \n\nWe drank a bottle of Roederer Estate Brut Rose (sparkling) $56) and a bottle of Domaine Vacheron Sancerre ($65), both entirely satisfactory. \n\nThe lively surroundings, professional service and overall good food made for a very enjoyable evening, but I would want to see Farallon kick some of the food up a notch before giving it five stars.", "author": "Susie L."}

The food is usually very good, however on this visit, I ordered the Ahi tuna that is served seared and rare in the center, which I would normally like. In this case, the kitchen did not cut the fish properly. The connective tissue was impossible to cut, and I had to leave a good portion on the plate after struggling with my knife and fork.

I have no problem throwing down some skrilla for a good meal, but I have a major problem with service that comes with an attitude. I've ordered other things here before, but mainly I recommend the royal platter and their desserts.", "author": "Jade L."}

I live just a few blocks away from this spot and about once a month I get the itch to wander in and feast on a variety of immaculate sea food dishes! Forget going to the Warf or the Pier for sea food, Farallon is where it's at. The waiters are always extremely kind and eager to help a patron out whether it be finding the perfect wine match for your meal or educating you on how the flavors in a particular dish titillate your taste buds. My personal favorite experiences here have been sitting at the bar, snacking on a variety of appetizers and guzzling down oyster shooters made with tequila rather than vodka. The decor of this spot is spectacular; it makes you feel as if you are sitting in an elegant underwater world. I would recommend Farallon to anyone looking for great sea food in a fine dinning setting who is not afraid to spend a little bit of money!", "author": "Bri C."}

We have always enjoyed eating and entertaining there. Our east coast friends are never disappointed due in part to the underwater feeling. If you only have time for a drink and appetizer it is still rewarding.", "author": "elizabeth d."}

It was my graduation dinner, and I will say that I had the best service because I knew our server.  Next time anyone decides to try Farallon, please ask for Marla.  She is so knowledgeable and will guide you through your entire meal.  My boyfriend and stepdad had three different types of oysters and they loved every single slurp!  The feta croquette salad was amazing, I wish I could have that every single day...I would be happy.  I have never tasted octopus before, and I really had no desire.  However my boy order the octopus carpacchio and I must say, it was quite tasty. For my entree I enjoyed the char, and I have to say one of the best parts of the meal was dessert.  I had the cheese plate.  I ordered 3 and I was given 6!  I am a cheese lover so as you can imagine I was in heaven!  Thanks Marla and Farallon for making my graduation dinner so special and memorable.  I intend to come back that for sure!", "author": "Samantha R."}

The food is really good, interesting and unique but not always I have to say.  I had teh ambrosia salad.  The lemon ice was an interesting touch but you end up with cantaloupe soup if you don't eat it quickly.   The crab salad was nice but not sure it was anything more than crab. what about seasoning etc?  I like simple but simple can be outstanding.", "author": "Misti L."}

You'll get a kick out of the fantastic oceanic-themed decor: hand-blown jellyfish lamps, sea-urchin ceiling light fixtures, tentacles wrapped around the bar, etc. Lots of people dressed in cocktail dresses and what not, but also plenty of people wearing polo shirts and khaki type outfits. Kind of loud and noisy, but the hostess accommodated my request for one of the high-backed booths, and that helped with the noise level somewhat.", "author": "A. T."}

You know that pirate ship restaurant in Disneyland?   Decor-wise, it kind of felt like an upscale version for adults.

Don't hate us because we are from Chicago, but our seafood was bland and my Sole was just bland fish and chips.  But, the Carrot Cake dessert was amazinggg.  The place is cool...and maybe there are better things to order then the waiters rec of Sole and Scallops.  Wine was delicious.", "author": "natalie m."}

Letting the host know it was the first time for my parents visiting SF, we were sat in one of the grand booths that made us feel like royalty. The waiter seemed to know each dish personally and lead us through a tour of amazing tastes starting with the seafood platter that included the best lobster I have ever tasted. Everything so fresh and delicately prepared. And the wine steward, paired us with wine that perfectly suited the meal and without any heavy handed guiding towards expense. And then there was the 4 courses and amuse bouche - which it was. We left so full and happy as I am sure you will too.", "author": "dominic p."}

Lobster claws and sardines to start were fine.  I don't know how you'd mess up a steamed lobster though.  Sardines were under-seasoned.  I had the Dorade, which was good, not great.  My parents both had the beef cheeks, which were all jacked up.  I finally got my Dad to send them back.  The entree is almost $40, it shouldn't be tough, crispy burnt (how did they even cook this thing) and impossible to cut.  The waitress sort of lectured my Dad that he should've sent it back immediately and was quite rude even though he was extremely apologetic and clearly uncomfortable sending it back.  This was not a $15 entree, this restaurant is in the Michelin Guide for God's sake, you should give a crap if you're serving, well, crap.  She did bring him the bass in exchange, which was sadly under-seasoned again.   On the up side, the sommelier was fantastic and thank god, we had good wine to pull us through.", "author": "Deidre A."}

We went for a special occasion to celebrate (my birthday) and had 4 courses that complimented each other so well.  The decor was lovely.  It had an antiquey elegant sea theme that wasn't overdone and not understated either.  I couldn't stop looking at the light fixtures.  It was one of the best special occasion meals I've ever had.  I especially enjoyed that it didn't feel packed the way some restaurants can get.  Even though every table was occupied they were well spaced so you didn't get stuck rubbing elbows with strangers or trying to talk over other people's conversations who are too darn close to your table.  I would give it even more stars for the intimacy, noise level and lighting if I could.  That's just want makes a nice restaurant in my opinion - quiet enough to feel comfortable but still lively enough not to feel like you're completely alone.  They were also good enough to accommodate us when we called to say we were running late due to traffic.  Overall this is an experience to remember and a class act of a restaurant.  The price is steep but worth it for special occasions.", "author": "Natalie B."}
