She loves the company, she loves  Her staff, and she loves cookies\n\nAh but I thought they were amazing.  There is  just a little taste of honey in all her cookies. The miracle is she doesn't use honey as part of her secret process. And the selection is really good too. It might sound odd, but you must try the milk chocolate blueberry. Never would have thought to mix these 2 flavors. Not in all of my baking days. I'm a believer, and tasting one will make you a believer too.", "author": "Stephanie G."}

They have interesting flavors. My favorite is the Campfire Cookie if you love s'mores than you are in for a treat. The Matcha Madness was interesting not too sweet. Was disappointed with the Potato Chip Pecan cookie. Dry, a little bland and I honestly did not taste the potato chip. The Bananarama is another cookie you can pass on. I love bananas and was expecting to love this but it did not stand out. \n\nYou can't pass up trying the good 'ol Chocolate Chip Cookie. To me that is a test of a good cookie place. If you can get your basic chocolate chip cookie to stand out than I'm sold. Also liked the Oatmeal Apricot. Definitely worth the checking them out. They have traditional flavors, gluten free options. Pretty reasonably priced for all natural handcrafted cookies!", "author": "Maria M."}

We all ordered a treat from Cookie Love on Wednesday, January 31st through Caviar. Our delivery order arrived around 1:15pm.\n\n*Sugar Cookie: Rainbow sprinkles and whole ground vanilla beans ($2.50)\n*Potato Chip Pecan: Potato chips in a cookie ($2.50)\n*Peanut Butter Cup: All natural peanut butter topped with peanut butter cup ($2.50)\n\nI got the sugar cookie. The cookie itself was okay. Chewy, but a tad crumbly. The sprinkles actually made it better as I adore sprinkles. Gave it a nice sweetness and texture. A coworker got the peanut butter cup and gave me half. I didn't really like his cookie as it tasted a touch burnt. Plus there wasn't enough pb cup in it. I didn't try the potato chip one, but another coworker seemed to like it.\n\nI was expecting more from their cookies as I was impressed by the selection.

Anyone with a sweet tooth can come here often.  Me, I'm not the kind who eats at least a batch of cookies.  Before I come home, I found the right time to stop by Cookie Love and try just one piece of cookie.  That's right!  JUST one, for $2.50.  Doesn't make any difference when I buy one expensive cookie.  None of them are vegan; however, at least one is gluten free and dairy free, the Triple Chocolate Decadence.  I never take it for a walk and eat later; I eat to try.  As I take a big bite unto the heart shaped chocolatey goodness, superb!  But it almost fall apart because it feels thin.  Every bite doesn't stick to my teeth like toffee.  After three big bites in a couple of minutes, why settle for another when the sweetness level is enough?\n\nThere are different flavors and designs to choose from in every cookies.  No matter how they're baked, here in Cookie Love is how the cookie crumble.  Oh and one more thing I need to add here.  When I ask about a type of cookie made with cricket flour, it'll take half hour to bake for perfection.", "author": "Jimmy C."}

I came on a Saturday afternoon and no one was there--the place just seemed dead. I note that because, while the sole employee was doing cookie things, the Cookie Love machine just wasn't spooled up and running smoothly. Here are more specific reasons I am not giving this place for than 3 stars:\n\n1) I ordered coffee and it took a while to get everything together (just didn't seem streamlined).\n2) Ordered some milk and it was nothing special (straight elementary school milk cartoon)--if you're going to be in the heart of SF, make it some organic hype thing that people like to pay more money for--not $1.50 for school lunch milk.\n3) Small flies walking on the cookies (point is more that the cookies are sitting out for a while, not that there are actually gross flies on it).\n\nOn a positive note, the cookies are better than average. I tried 4 different types and the only one really worthwhile is the Matcha Madness. I thought the lavender in the Lavender White Chocolate cookie was too strong. I do wish they all tasted more fresh and chewy.\n\nI honestly would not recommend Cookie Love unless you're Cookie Monster going nuts without your fix.

The marshmallow in the middle is everything. Super gooey and just so perfect. Just when I thought that I've had the best cookie ever, I eat the matcha madness and that one just blew my mind as well.

I am honestly getting tired of the cupcake and ice-cream stores aplenty and it's refreshing to see a shop selling cookies that have unique flavors. However, for me personally, I would rather go to a shop selling amazing basic cookies than a shop selling unique flavor cookies that lack in quality.\n\nI was in the Nob Hill area and was craving dessert, so I stopped by here to get some cookies to go. I thought that $2.50 per cookie was steep but reasonable given the unique flavors offered. I believe I got the pumpkin snicker doodle, campfire, peanut butter cup, caramel apple, and potato chip pecan. Almost all of the cookies tasted a fraction above grocery store-grade quality. I was pretty disappointed considering I expected these cookies to be some of the best I ever tasted. I was also starving so it's a little strange that given how hungry I was, I wasn't wolfing down these cookies like I normally would. The best cookie for me was, ironically, the potato chip pecan, which had a really great taste/texture.\n\nI honestly don't know if I will be rushing to this place anytime soon...

I went in at 3 pm (they close at 6) and they were out of most flavors including basic chocolate chip which was disappointing to me and the people behind me in line. I ended up getting their triple chocolate and snickerdoodle cookies. It's $2.50 a cookie which is what you'd expect for a small shop renting in San Francisco. The triple chocolate was good but the dough was overworked so they were a bit more gummy than they should have been. Snickerdoodle was ok but wasn't very flavorful. I noticed that the cookies were not all the same size so they give you more of a homemade feel than buying from a bakery which I would keep in mind if I was purchasing cookies to bring to an event or for a special occasion, especially for the price. The cookies were all right, they tasted pretty good, the place could work on presentation as well as having a greater variety available 3 hours before they're closing on a Saturday though I understand they are closed on Sundays and may not have wanted to bake a whole lot before closing shop.", "author": "Lily R."}

Great lavender essence that wasn't overpowering. \n- BLUEBERRY CHOCOLATE CHIP: nice blueberry flavor but nothing amazing. \n- CHOCOLATE CHERRY: I liked this one! Recommend for chocolate lovers. \n- BANANARAMA: per mom banana-loving mom, this was \"so so\". \n- CHOCOLATE CHIP: my typical go to, but I wasn't a fan of this one. Had a funky after taste imo but not sure if that was from the flavors from the other cookies infusing into this one. \n\nOverall, the texture and freshness of Antoine's beats this place. But come here if you're craving unique flavors and don't mind spending a lot more. \n\nWould've been really nice if they had an extra worker there too. We waited over 30 minutes for cookies that we were told would be ready in 10. Totally not the employee's fault though when you're handling a ton of delivery orders as well..by yourself!!

Just by the looks of it, the cookies looked unique, tasty, and fresh! Sad to say, that was not the case. The cookies are 2.50 each so I got two to reach the $5 credit card minimum. Got the double chocolate cherry and the campfire smores cookie (apparently a new creation). The double chocolate cherry had sea salt sprinkled on the top and added a nice salty touch to the bitter sweet cookie, but the cookie itself was close to stale, wasn't soft/chewy/crispy in any way, and was super thin. The campfire smores cookie was better in that it was less stale tasting, but the cookie itself had the same sad texture as the double chocolate cookie and the marshmallow on top make me feel like I was eating taffy. \n\nIt would be awesome if the cookies were less stale tasting, had a better flavor and texture, but from what I've had, I won't be coming back anytime soon.", "author": "Elaina W."}

I thought the plain half actually tasted better than the overwhelmed chocolate-coated half.  If you like the potato chip chocolates from ROYCE' (Japan), then you'll love this cookie.\n\nPeanut Butter Cup:  3.5 stars\nBetter, more moist and interesting than the regular CCC.\n\nGood Ole Chocolate Chip:  3 stars\nThink the salt was a little out-of-place here.  I've had better CCCs.\n\nOatmeal Apricot:  3 stars\nIt was just okay, slightly salty / slightly meh.

I ordered 12 cookies for some office friends, one of them having a birthday.  I ended up with cookie flavors I didn't order, only received 7 of the 12 cookies and was charged for 9 cookies.  I tried to contact Postmates, they are only contactable thru e-mail and delivery person wouldn't answer their mobile after they delivered.  Cookie Love just wouldn't answer their phone after multiple tries.  This completely ruined the surprise of cookies for the office.  Hopefully someone will respond to my email about being overcharged.  It is unfortunate but I will not recommend ordering cookies from Cookie Love, or ordering any other items through Postmates again. \n\nBesides being overcharged, which would make any food not taste good, the cookies were just okay.

The good ol' chocolate chip is also good and I thought the pecan potato chip one was also good too!\n\nWhile I had a really great experience with the excellent service and cookies I would say that you might want to plan if you have a budget (cookies are $2.50 each), but I think it was well worth it since these cookies are delicious and obviously made with love ;). Great place, great service and delicious cookies!", "author": "Caroline L."}

The thing about matcha is that so many bakers tend to be afraid of using it in sweets because it's so bitter. CookieLove was like, \"w/e\" and made an entire cookie with matcha...and also my other favorite flavor in the world, black sesame. This made for a very smoky, almost savory cookie, which was broken by the super sweet white chocolate chunks in the middle. Amazing. That is how you blend flavors together.\n\nThey also have Humphrey Slocombe ice cream. Next time, I'm going to get my matcha cookies as an ice cream sandwich with black sesame ice cream. Oh my God.
