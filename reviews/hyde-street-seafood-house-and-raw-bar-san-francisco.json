Finally on Friday, March 9th, we made it happen. I made a reservation for dinner at Hyde Street Seafood House through OpenTable about a week prior for a party of five at 6pm.\n\nHappy Hour is 5pm-7pm, so luckily, we made it in time for $1.25 oysters! You do have to order them by the dozen at $15 a pop. The oysters come with mignonette and cocktail sauce. (Note: You can sit at a table and order their HH specials, so feel free to make a reservation if you want to guarantee yourself a table.) With our group, we were able to finish three dozen. That night, they were offering: Skookum (BC), Quilcene (Wa), Hammersley (Wa). I'm into smaller oysters since I find them sweeter and cleaner tasting, so my favs were the Hammersley. We ended up getting two dozen of all varieties and one dozen of just those. For HH, they also have $4 draft pint beers and $1 off certain glasses of wine. We just stuck to bottles of wine, so didn't take advantage of the drink specials.\n\n*Seafood Salad: mixed greens with fresh crab meat, bay shrimp & smoked salmon ($16)\n*New England Clam Chowder ($9)\n*Lobster Bisque ($10)\n*Escargot with garlic herb butter ($13)\n*Sauteed Mussels with fresh herb butter, onion & white wine ($14)\n*Shellfish Combination En Papillote: mussels, clams, scallops & prawns baked in parchment paper with fresh herbs, julienned vegetables, potatoes, white wine, butter & lemon ($25)\n*Garlic Roasted Prawns: served with rice or thyme roasted potatoes & vegetables ($23)\n*Pan Roasted Corvina Sea Bass: served with scaloppini potatoes, vegetables & kalamata olives, tomato, basil garlic sauce ($25)\n*Fettuccini Pasta: with rock shrimp, bay scallops, smoked salmon & chardonnay cream sauce ($25)\n\nWe did our whole dinner family style, so shared everything. I always need some kind of vegetable, so the salad was a great palate cleanser of sorts. Since more than half our group wasn't eating meat, we kept everything seafood centric. I adored the pasta. The cream sauce was so comforting and there was a good amount of seafood. I'm a huge fan of garlic butter, so I enjoyed the escargots. Make sure to dip the complimentary bread in the extra butter. So good! The garlic prawns were also super tasty. Meaty with great flavor. I think my least fav dish was the en papillote, but I'm actually not a huge fan of this style of cooking. We just decided to order it since it was a signature dish of theirs. It's good to note, for those not eating meat, the clam chowder does not have any bacon in it. I made sure to ask before ordering.\n\n*Chocolate Cheesecake ($7.50)\n*Creme Brulee ($7.50)\n*Secret Coffee: topped with whipped cream and shaved chocolate ($6)\n*Presidential Tawny Porto: matured in wood for ten years ($10.50)\n*Taylor Fladgate Tawny Porto: matured in wood for twenty years ($12)\n*Prosecco Extra Dry La Marca DOC, Italy N/V ($39)\n*Cabernet Sauvignon Kunde Estate Grown, Sonoma Valley, 2013 ($43)\n*Petite Sirah Michael-David, Lodi, 2015 ($50)\n\nTo end our meal, we decided to get two desserts. I just had a bite or so of each as the port was basically my dessert. I did enjoy the 20 over the 10 year. I believe the secret coffee had some alcohol in it, but I had a fair amount to drink by the end of dinner, so not 100% sure. For wine, we actually stuck to three bottles. Started with the bubbly for the oysters, the cab for the apps, and the petite sirah for the entrees. They all paired nicely since we're all red wine drinkers. And all bottles were reasonably priced.\n\nService was amazing! Our waiter was awesome. We were actually here for over four hours and never felt rushed. Even though we closed out the restaurant. A great, very affordable neighborhood restaurant. With all the food and drinks plus tax and tip, we each paid under $100. That's a win in my book!", "author": "Elena N."}

It could be the smell of the ocean in the air? IDK. I yelped Oyster bar and Hyde Street Seafood House and Raw Bar felt like a good choice. The main draw for me was the Happy Hour Oysters priced at $15 for a dozen (5-7pm)! Anyone in the city who loves oysters knows that's a damn good deal!!\n\nThe hubs and I were staying at the Hilton in Union Square and decided to walk to dinner since it was a mile away. Not too sure that was a great idea. A mile anywhere else would have been easy peasy, but a mile in SF could be taking you up several inclines that will leave you breathless and a little sweaty. Down hill was by no means any easier. By the time we reached the restaurant we built up an appetite for dinner. This excursion was just supposed o be about appetizers and small plates, but what the hell... we made it there! We might as well enjoy ourselves. We of course took Lyft to get back.  \n\nWhat we ordered:\n\n1. 2 Dozen Oysters: It was $15 and the when the waiter asked us if we wanted another dozen we were weak to his suggestion. Plus it was like 5 minutes to 7pm and we've already had some wine and between the ambiance of the space and the delicious first dozen it was hard to say no.\n\n2. Escargot: I don't think there is a restaurant in Sacramento (our home base) that offers escargot, and when we saw it on the menu we had to have it. Not often do we get that option at a restaurant. Plus, the hubs and I have had it before liked it and wanted to try it again. Pretty tasty! Texture was chewy and it was covered in butter and garlic. \n\n3. Cioppino: SF is always cold and what better way to warm up then to have some cioppino. I loved how they didn't skimp out on the good seafood.  Large chunks of fish, several pieces of prawns, large scallop, and mussels made it heavy on the protein side. The warm tomato based sauce was flavorful and the noodles were a nice touch!\n\nGreat cozy/intimate place for a quiet dinner with someone special.  I think they have a large table for maybe one large party, but other than that, that's all you get.  Tables are close together that you can hear another person's conversation, but you should mind your own business and focus on who you're with and it's not a problem.\n\nI had a great time!

We had to flag someone down after 20 minutes because we assumed they didn't know we were there. She assured us she knew, and set the ball rolling for sub parties service for the rest of the night. To the point where we got up to fill our own waters after asking twice for a refill. They push the wine and beer more than the water, to the point it is insulting. The food seems to be cheap ingredients and taste nothing special. Looking into the kitchen I saw nothing to disprove my suspicion. Cheap cans of chicken stock, and yellow tubs of butter, please say that is not margarine. For 30 dollar Cioppino you expect more than a small portion of seafood in really bland, tastes like it is out of the bottle marinara sauce. Same goes for the parchment paper salmon, dull.

Eating a spawning oyster won't make you sick, but it's not a pleasant experience, either. When fertile, their texture is soft and creamy (and not in a good way like cheese or ice cream). As water temperatures rise in warmer months, oysters spawn, or release eggs and sperm into the water, so once oysters begin the process, they don't stop.  When we advised the elderly Asian manager (\"Madame Gao\"), she was very apologetic, but in no way empathetic or professional, and even after shown the nasty substance on the shellfish, had no intention of removing cost from our bill, and no clue of this phenomena. This was quite a shock foe a so-called \"Seafood House and Raw Bar\", as you easily can tell an oyster is spawning, as spawning oysters look foamy, milky, and even a little slimy. A good restaurant would never serve a spawning oyster. Most places train their staff to spot spawning oysters (or at least they should).  This is obviously NOT a good restaurant!

Daily. As in, E V E R Y D A Y! Ogni giorno, quotidien, taglich! \n\nWe were set for the next hour enjoying 3 dozen oysters, lobster bisque and warm French bread.  Their wines by the glass aren't overpriced (get the Sauvignon Blanc and Sparkling Rose) and beers like Anchor Steam, Sierra Nevada, Guiness are available. \n\nOysters are one of my favorites and the ones served here are super fresh.

I started out helping myself to my partner's bowl, and then I pretty much ate the whole thing. You will not regret ordering it for your appetizer. \n\nBesides my low key obsession with the lobster bisque, I've tried everything from the little neck clam appetizer, the hot saut\u00e9ed clam app,  crab cakes, garlic roasted prawn entree, and the garlic roasted Dungeness crab to name my favorites and I have not once been disappointed.   \n\nMy best friend and I went here when she was visiting the city and she had the stuffed prawns in a B\u00e9arnaise sauce entree and she was thrilled with her meal. \n\nThe staff does a great job being attentive but not on top of you, and the pricing is so so reasonable for a seafood restaurant in the city. \nLastly the decor is so fun, it's all nautical maps on the walls and decor, and your food comes out from the kitchen in a real porthole! \n\nI highly recommend Hyde Street Seafood (and my food loyalty is not easily won)!", "author": "K C."}

It's very quiet.  \n\nIt makes up for that in oysters though.  I ended up eating 2 dozen, a basket of sourdough bread, and having 2 Anchor Steams.  My check was $38 after tax.  You can't beat that with a stick.  The oysters they featured were of three varieties; local, Steamboat out of Washington, and Henderson Bay out of Washington.  They were all good but the Washington types were the best.

I was traveling on business and was trying to avoid the plethora of overpriced subpar food on the wharf. Basically if you have a restaurant and serve a bowl of clam chowder and some frozen fish you can get $20-$35 a plate because your audience is mostly not ever going to repeat. \n\nAfter a mile hike uphill I ordered takeout at Hyde. The process was easy enough although they seemed tired and worn out but polite. The restaurant was half filled, although the half that was filled were lively and seeming to have a good time. I had hope. \n\nI asked the bartender / slash manager what was local caught and fresh - after all they are a mile away from the ocean so you figure they would take advantage of the their best resource.. Not so much. Exactly two items on their menu were locally sourced. Uh oh, not a good sign. The Ocean and plethora of fresh catch is a MILE AWAY!\n\nI ordered the stuffed rainbow trout and a bowl of clam chowder to go. Rainbow trout is an easy to cook fish that is really hard to screw up unless you overcook it. When I tried a bit of the trout it was soggy and wet, seemingly previously frozen, no shock there. What did shock me was that they didn't de-bone the fish! This is an extremely lazy and amateurish thing to do whisc shows a total lack of preparation and commitment to the safety of their clientele. \n\nThe clam chowder was decent, but I have to investigate if they make it locally or buy it pre-made from a distributor. For now they will get a push on that one. \n\nThe one star comes from a previous frozen fish, their lack of safe food preparation and lack of locally sourced food. I guess in San Francisco if your in a tourist location you have license to offer sub-par food and skip on basic safety like removing pin bones from a fish. \n\nMy advice to the restaurant and most restaurants in the area. Get some passion back. Source some local offerings, pay attention to your clients. It's only so long you can serve crappy food at ZAGAT rated prices. \n\nI'll be back and hopefully caught them on an off night, but for now the one star stands.", "author": "Sean G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-09-22", "description": "Quite an ordinary place.  I honestly do not know why it gets so many good reviews.  Perhaps it was a bad night for the restaurant.\n\nFirst of all, the setting is drab.  It's a super old school, divey place, with unframed, paper maps on the walls, and kitchy maritime chach-kas for decor.  Really bad.  Also, the entire restaurant is too brightly lit, and to make matters worse, the light is a dingy yellow, like from dusty old light bulbs, making the place look like a faded sepia print from someone's' attic.\n\nSecond - they only serve beer and wine.  Super disappointing.  I should have done my homework so I'll blame myself a little for this but they should really think about a proper liquor license.  Accepting our fate, we ordered a Fume Blanc, which was fine, but kind of pricey for what it was.\n\nThird - the bread was sub-par: papery, bland, institutional in quality, like something you would get in a hospital. I should have seen that as a foretelling of what was to come.\n\nFor our meal, we decided to start with some local and adjoining state sourced raw oysters, and those were sublime, but it was all downhill from there.  For a main course,  I ordered seared scallops in a ginger cream sauce with potatoes and string beans.  My companion ordered the sea bass wrapped in parchment, which is evidently a signature dish of the place, with similar starch and veggies.\n\nThen we waited, and waited, and waited. 45 minutes with no other food, except for the overly earnest water boy who kept topping off our water glasses.  Our wine was running low too,  Perhaps this was a tactic to get us to order another $40 bottle of pretty average wine.  We started to notice that other tables were in the same plight.  \n\nThen suddenly, ALL the waiting tables started to receive their orders simultaneously, or more accurately, serially, since there seemed to be only one waiter, and the owner who decided to chip in, tending to the entire room and they could only carry two hot plates at a time.\n\nAnd it wasn't worth the wait.  The starch and veggies were, again, of institutional quality, like something that would be served at an old folk's home: overly steamed, wilted, bland, bad.  My scallops were just OK.  My partner's fish in parchment was totally unexciting.  Again -- BLAND.\n\nI became annoyed and lost all interest in the meal.  We collected our check, left a minimum tip and departed, vowing to never return.\n\nForewarned is forearmed!  Diner beware.  This place is highly over-rated.\n\nP.S. - SUPER hard to find parking around there (Nob Hill).  Allow 30-45 minutes to accomplish parking.", "author": "Presley A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-05-08", "description": "So my family wanted a good seafood restaurant to try while they were visiting.  I saw the reviews so I made a reservation for 7 people.  When I called ahead, I asked what the restaurant was known for.  I was told the lobster bisque and few other seafood dishes.  I asked if there was music and was told there was soft jazz music played.  My family Uber-ed to the restaurant.  The experience was awful. When we arrived there was no host to great us, but the very friendly bartender told us we could sit at one if two tables.  There was no music and the atmosphere of the room we were in was compared to that of a funeral home.  It felt cold and dark and none of the staff smiled or seemed happy.  I looked around the rest of the restaurant and ran into a few of the staff members working. I've never felt so un-welcomed.  I had to ask for music even though, I was told there would be some over the phone when I called.  She proceeded to explain that she had to turn on the CD player.  I would say don't share this information with patrons.  It makes you sound old school and to cheap to buy a sound system or network.  We were offered water.   When we agreed, the waitress proceeded to the sink (in the same room we were in) and filled the pitcher with tap water from the sink.  The odd thing was that the waitress filled everyone's glass, 1/4 of the way and went back to the sink 3 times to finish getting our water.  It felt cheap and is there only one water pitcher for the restaurant (bring two since you have a lot of people)?  Maybe fill up your water vessels all at one time so your guest don't see you literally holding the pitcher over the sink during their service.  No one drank the water; we order a bottle of wine instead.  Why did we have to order wine? There is no real bar there.  They have a few beers on tap, wine, but no hard liquor for cocktails. Disappointing.  Next, we ordered oyster for an appetizer.  Those were very good and everyone enjoyed that.  Two people in my party order the lobster bisque.  Both said the soup was cool and I could see that the consistency was that of watery oatmeal.  Bisque is not suppose to be curdled.  My family was trying to be polite but I wasn't about to let them eat it.  I told the waitress.  No apology or explanation was given she just took them back and offered a different soup.  She seemed so bothered. Everyone passed on a second soup.  By this point, I was completely embarrassed.  I pulled out my phone, made a reservation at another restaurant that I know had great service and great food.  When I told the waitress we were not staying for the rest of the meal, she didn't ask why or send over a manager, she said okay and gave me the check.  I paid and we left. Hmmmm... So, I guess you are okay with not knowing why I won't be back or why you lost a party of 7.  We went to the other restaurant, where we were not afraid to drink the water, we ordered drinks, appetizers, entree's and desert and had a great time.

If a restaurant serves lobster bisque, then I'm bound to get it, it's one of my all time favorite dishes and to this day, THIS IS THE BEST I've ever had. It was so creamy and delicious. I think often times it's the seasoning that ruins the bisque at certain establishments, but it's seasoned to perfection here with chunks of lobster.\n\nHalf dozen local ray oysters- 4/5. Nothing much to say, pretty fresh though not huge. But good.\n\nEscargots- 4/5. Deliciousss. My friend tried it for the first time and she loved it also. Not the best I've had, but the best I've had was somewhere in Paris so I guess that's not a fair comparison -_- haha \n\nCioppino pasta- 4/5. lotsssss of seafood in this pasta, must try for all seafood lovers. I'm not too big on seafood, but my friend loved it and she loves seafood. It's pretty heavy on the seafood meat so you'll def get really full from this dish. The sauce was light enough not to overpower the seafood at all, which is good in any seafood dish.\n\nCajun combo Prawns & Scallops- 4/5. Has quite a bit of flavor and it was really nice. Recommend for the stronger palette. \n\nGood experience overall, although I feel like inside could do with a little renovations.

EXCELLENT!\n\nIt's so great to find a $1 oyster happy hour on the weekends, especially in a free parking area like Nob Hill. It's only open for dinner from 5pm and on so don't bother coming here for lunch. It's a family-owned joint and the service is very friendly and personable. \n\nThe food details: \nTechnically, it's $12 for a dozen oysters (so no you can't actually order one oyster for $1) but that's good enough right? There's three types that go on during happy hour:\n1. Diamond point (east coast)- The first one I had was pretty good; creamy and the biggest sized. However, the rest of these ended up tasting very subtle. Not bad but weird that there wasn't a huge taste to it\n2. Marin bay (local)- salty and grainy. Probably my least favorite but not horrible\n3. Fanny bay (bc)- Mid-size oysters that are definitely meaty to say the least. \nWe also tried the Lobster Bisque since there were so many raves about it. It's pretty good. Creamy with bits of chunks in it. I've never really had lobster bisque so I don't really have anything to compare it to but I guess it was okay.\nBeers during happy hour go for $2.50 each. \n\nOverall, I like the place. The oysters aren't anything amazing but it's still $1 oyster so how can you really go wrong right? It's definitely worth a visit if you're really craving oysters but don't want to chock up full-price at other places.

The sign out front says they've been open since 1985 and it is quite evident in the decor. It appears to not have had any renovations or redecorating since then.  I reminded myself that I'm going to a restaurant to enjoy the food, first and foremost so I tried to keep an open mind.\n\nWe waited at the front of the restaurant for a few minutes, and no one greeted us.  I know, a few minutes doesn't seem like a lot of time, but the restaurant was pretty empty, so it was a bit awkward to wait there for what seemed like an eternity as the two parties that were there just kept looking at us.  Not a good sign for a Saturday night in SF's bustling restaurant scene.\n\nFinally, the waiter came by and I guess he was doing double duty as the host.  He was very nice and sat us at our table.  We ordered a prosecco and a kir and unfortunately, they were both flat with barely any bubbles.  We informed the other server, and she apologized and provided us with new drinks that were from a new bottle and this time, they were full of bubbles!\n\nThe menu is quite overwhelming with about 20 cold and hot appetizers and 15 entrees.  For such a small seafood restaurant, I was a little concerned that they had so many options.  How is it possible to have so many items with fresh ingredients and execute the dishes flawlessly?  We ordered the crab cocktail and the calamari salad.  Both were okay but rather forgettable.  For our entrees, we had the sea bass en papillote and the stuffed prawns with bernaise sauce.  The sea bass was extremely disappointing with barely any flavor and it was just served on top of a bed of shredded vegetables a' la 1970 and plain potatoes.  I ate most of the fish because it was $26 and left everything else.  The stuffed prawns were okay but the presentation and flavors were nothing special.\n\nDespite the nice servers and charming Russian Hill location with views of the cable cars going by, the restaurant was a huge disappointment and I will not be returning.

I also found out that they have some great happy hour specials, which I'll take advantage of the next time I visit. The lighting was perfection, and cable cars drove by every now and then. The service couldn't have been more perfect, and they called me immediately when they realized my friend accidentally left her credit card! I will for sure be back.", "author": "Uche I."}

Having eaten here earlier this week I agree that the quality has gone down and I think it's closer to a 3 now.\n\nThe food was hit or miss. The escargot was good (hard to mess that up with so much butter) and the oysters were fresh. However the \"prawn\" \"cocktail\" really disappointed - instead of coming in a traditional cocktail bowl we were served 4 shrimp on a regular white plate surrounding a dollop of cocktail sauce. They were rubbery and mostly tasteless and definitely looked more like shrimp than prawns. Also, the bread was stale. Why?\n\nI got one of the daily specials which was mahi mahi en papillote and the fish was way overcooked. This was really disappointing because mahi mahi is usually such a nice fish. \n\nThe service otherwise was good as was the bottle of wine.", "author": "Alex V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-02-15", "description": "First time here, last time here. \nI brought my girlfriend in for Valentine's last night and had a table reserved for 9pm.\nFirst to note, there is barely any parking around. We found a parking garage 3 blocks away which cost $20 for 2 hours. \nWe get inside the restaurant and while in line we're handed a pre fixe dinner menu by an Asian lady who doesn't speak clearly. We decide on the filet mignon and lobster tail. It was a 3 course that included salad for starters and choice of dessert at the end.\nWe were seated 10 minutes later by the window which can only fit two people side by side. We hadn't originally planned to sit this way but after about 10 minutes began to think it was kind of nice. \n30 minutes go by and noone has taken our order. We couldn't understand why it was taking so long to be noticed when our table is seated directly next to the reservation desk and computer. The same Asian lady who handed us our menu is standing right beside us but seems to be ignoring us since she is heavily concentrated on the computer screen.  \nI finally get her attention and ask if someone can come take our order and she magically becomes our server. Really? So at this restaurant, the customers need to go to the servers instead of  the other way around to be waited on. \nAnyway, our first course comes out - a crab caesar salad. It had lots of real crab that tasted fresh but lost points due to being mixed with iceberg lettuce. Then as we're eating our salad, our server tells us they are out of the filet mignon. WTF???IT'S A PRE FIXE MENU!!! \nJust as I tell the server we're going to pay for our salad and leave, she offers us both NY strips instead. I ask if there's a change in price for the inconvenience and she ignores us and walks away to tell the cook we want the NY strip. \nThen our main course comes out and this is where everything went downhill.   \nBoth the lobster tail and NY strip portions were very SMALL and PATHETIC. It was the most minuscule of portions I had ever seen for a dinner. So now I'm wishing we would've left after we finished our salad. \nI bite into my steak and find it's under cooked. I ordered it medium but it was raw. I tell our server/reservation assistant/whatever the hell she is that it's raw and she takes the plate and brings it back 5 minutes later. I immediately see the piece of meat I spit out originally that's now been microwaved and think to myself, how tacky. They try and make up for this by giving me some breaded shrimp but guess what?? IT'S COLD. There really isn't much to say about the lobster tail. Although it tasted good, there was no butter sauce and only took two bites to finish. It was THAT small. \nIn the middle of all this there is barely any real service although the same Asian lady is standing an arm lengths away. They weren't even busy. \nWe get our dessert and I get a cold pudding-like clump of what's supposed to be chocolate souffle with a cut in the middle which I guess is supposed to resemble the crack when it comes out of an oven???? My girlfriend gets a sliver of store bought key lime pie. \nOverall this dinner was over priced ($63 per person for the pre fixe) not including the bottle of wine and 1/2 dozen oysters we ordered and very disappointing. \nThen as we were ready to leave we again had to flag our server down who again was standing right next to us to ask for our check. \nHorrible service, horrible portions that make you feel like you've been ripped off. I would never come here again nor would I recommend this place.", "author": "Jamie A."}

But, maybe that's because I hadn't dined at Hyde Street Seafood House and Raw Bar yet.\n\n#1 rave: OYSTERS - Hyde Street has $1 happy hour oysters from 5-7pm.  They pre-select 3 kinds of oysters and serve the oysters with 2 sauces: a mignonette and a cocktail sauce. I don't recall the other 2 types of oysters we had because the Fannie Bays were OUTSTANDING. The sweetness and lightness of a smaller oyster (like a blue point), but with the richness and creaminess of a larger oyster. We ordered another round of the Fannie Bays because they were so good. \n\n#2 rave: Seafood salad with smoked salmon, crab, and bay shrimp - We ordered the larger salad, with portions for 2 people. The amount of seafood in the salad was very generous and the freshness of the seafood was very apparent.  The salad greens were lightly dressed in a simple vinaigrette and were the perfect foundation to the sweetness of the seafood. \n\n#3 rave: Lobster bisque - The seafood stock used to flavor the bisque was excellent, not too briny. The sweet lobster flavor was amazing and perfectly complimented by the smooth cream base. Most bisques are too heavy or rich, but this lobster bisque was creamy, but light. \n\nThe ambiance is dimly lit, intimate and classy.

Needless to say, parking is a problem but it's kinda interesting to take a walk around the neighborhood. Old San Francisco architecture along with cable car running in between is very enjoyable.\n\nBack to the restaurant, I would say it's very old school. I found it to be very comfortable with the wooden deco. The servers have that \"whatever\" attitude but yet very attentive and professional. They know their offerings well and recommended the perfect dishes to us.\n\nOk, three dozens of oysters at $14 each, great deal! First order, Fanny Bay, Sister Point, and Skookums. Everyone has their own favorite but the winners are the Sister Point and the Fanny Bay among the group and I totally agreed with them. Quotes from friends: Sister Point has the sweet after taste and the Fanny Bay is creamy. Again, at $14 a dozen, I wish I can do this each and every day.\n\nAfter that we had a dozen of escargot, a couple of baked prawn, scallops dishes, steamed clams, and some sort of seafood salad. The escargots were... can you taste what an escargot tastes like? I'm not sure but I can tell you the texture was great and the sauce was pot on! The baked... seafood dish was yummy. There were a pool of sauce/oil left and we loved to use it as bread dipping. Sorry, the steamed clams were way too salty. Maybe we need to pair it with a stronger wine. As for the seafood salad, it's very refreshing and did its duty to wake us up before attending a performance at 7:30.\n\nA little over two hours of happy happy happy hours with three bottles of wine, five dozens of oysters, and dish dish dish of apps.

They were fresh and beautifully shucked. No pieces of shell in the oyster juice. I couldn't believe there was no one on line for this place or the fact that it was so cheap. Maybe Swan Oyster took all their business? \n\nThe decor is pretty formal - there are tablecloths. However, I was dressed in jeans and a t-shirt and didn't feel too out of place.

My boyfriend made reservations for 8pm but we got there super early cause we thought it would take us FOREVER to find parking, but we were lucky. Usually parking around this neighborhood would take a good 30 mins to find.. Good thing they were nice enough to seat us even though we were about an hour early for our reservation.\n\n**We were seated at 7:10pm.\n**7:25pm - the waiter finally came to take our order.. that's pretty long considering they really weren't that busy. We ordered the oyster mixed plate to share - I had the lobster bisque and the white sea bass, the bf had the clam chowder and the pork chops.\n**7:45pm - the oysters came. there were 3 different kinds but our waiter never told us which one was which so I had no idea what the oyster I liked was called.\n**8:10pm - our soups came. the lobster bisque was decent, not the best I've had though. The boyfriend's clam chowder tasted like over-priced progresso.\n**around 8:30pm was the highlight of my already disappointing experience.. another lovely waiter knocked over a glass of water while trying to clean the table next to us and how lucky am I to have it splashed all over my shoes and feet? GUESS IT WAS MY FAULT, SINCE THE WAITER DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO APOLOGIZE.\n\nAt that point, I just wanted to leave.\nWe took the entrees to-go, paid for our check and left.\n\nMy entree was supposed to be a \"herb marinated white sea bass and vegetables wrapped and baked in paper\" the waiter told me it was delicious, he lied.\nI got paper, burnt vegetables and a bitter slab of fish.\n\n1 star for the oysters, they were at least decent.\nThe only thing I would come back for would either be to try out their happy hour oysters or maybe if my feet needed a little splashing.", "author": "Lily K."}

We were really lucky and got the last seat in the restaurant, and it was right by the window so it was great for people watching and the cable car goes right by us. \n\nWe started off with the lobster bisque and that was SO GOOD. It was nice and creamy, with lots of lobster meat, and it was just an explosion of yumminess. \n\nOur waiter was super nice. Our water glasses were always full and the basket of bread was never empty (and we were starving so we ate a LOT of bread. ps the bread with the lobster bisque, soooooo good). \n\nWe got 3 entrees, the best one was the seafood fettucini (I can't remember what it's called) It's got chardonay white sauce and tons of seafood. The pasta was well-prepared, the sauce was flavorful and creamy. It's got loads of shrimp, scallops, salmon, lobster, and crab. The shrimps were amazing, they were perfectly cooked. The scallops were small and chewy, and there were way too much scallops. It would've been perfect if there were more shrimps and less scallops. The really nice thing they did was that they brought it out to us in 2 plates, portions pre-separated and everything so we don't have to do it ourselves.\n\nThe other two entrees were kinda disappointing, it was a good thing that the pasta was delicious. \n\nThe Baked Stuffed Rainbow Trout (lobster, scallops, shrimp & crab meat stuffing). The trout was really tender, but on the bland side in my opinion. The stuffing was nice.\n\nThe Cioppino (clams, mussles, scallops, fish, crab meat & prawns in marinara sauce) was okay. It wasn't as tomato-y as we were expecting. \n\nOh and we got some margaritas. They were awful. Don't get cocktails here.\n\nOverall, it was a nice restaurant, nice ambiance, nice service, I would go back and try their oysters!", "author": "Erica L."}

I'm going to write this review in bullet point style b/c I have a lingering feeling that tells me a second trip is imminent.\n\nPOSITIVES\n\nNice Waitstaff\n- Our waiter had good knowledge of the menu and when we finished the meal and brought the check, he thanked me by using my name and asked if we needed a cab.\n\nDecor\n- The decor was nautical, which is great as I'm from New England and quite enjoy a good nautical vibe.\n\nMusic\n- They had some good golden oldies playing.  Lots of Sinatra.\n\nNEGATIVES\n\nFood\n- The food was meh.  The Caesar salad was very average.  I got the Blue Nosed Bass (recommended to me), which I had never tried before.  It had a tough consistency, almost like lobster, that I wasn't expecting.  Perhaps that is how BNB is though.  My girlfriend got the Salmon and said that it was bland.  I actually liked the light seasoning.\n\nEffect of the food\n- As stated above, I recently got off the toilet.  It was a little rough in there.  It kind of took me back to childhood b/c I experienced the type of gas pains I used to get when I was a kid.  The kind that you would call your mom in for to rub your belly until the feeling passed.  I asked my girlfriend to come in and give the ole constitution a rub, but she wouldn't do it.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI'm a little bummed that HSSHRB wasn't better.  I just moved into an apartment a half block away and it would've been rad to have a good place close by.  I may go back, but it may only be to get drinks at the bar, which looked cool.

It was nearing dinner time, and we had been walking all day. We could not find a place to eat, and we were walking up and down Hyde Street in search of a place for dinner. \n\nWe were both in tennis shoes and hoodies (and I was sporting a backpack), so we were initially leery about dining here. However, once we were seated (we did not have reservations, and only had to wait about 15-20 minutes on a Friday night), all of that worry melted away.\n\nI ordered wine. I never order wine. Call it the curse of Napa, still sticking with me . And my husband ordered a delicious beer. Our meal was already off to a banner start, as far as I was concerned.\n\nA few days earlier in South Lake Tahoe, I had discovered seafood bisque. Still carrying that craving into the Bay area, I ordered the lobster bisque for dinner. Between the bisque, the served bread, and the wine, I knew I would be set. And boy, was I. This bisque was so fantastic, I couldn't get it out of my head for days after. It had a fantastic, semi-thick consistency with small clumps of succulent lobster... oh boy, if you come here, you must indulge (calories-wise) in the lobster bisque. It's a can't-miss culinary experience.\n\nMy husband ordered a fish dish. At first it tasted bland, but somehow, later, my second bite was infused with buttery, citrus flavor.\n\nYum.

The first one, which I'm sure isn't the right name, were the largest but probably least tasty.  Hog island were smaller but much tastier, but the smallest steam boat ones were the best in my opinion.  Next time I go back, I would skip the first.  Complimented my oysters with some beer and you can't really ask for much else!\n\nThe restaurant was nice and clean.  Pretty simple decor with a nautical theme and the service was nice.  The dinner menu looked pretty pricey so I don't know if I would come back for that, but I'd definitely stop by again for another HH get together!", "author": "Tom Y."}

It came with your choice of fresh vegetables and potatoes. They were accomodating of my request for all veggies.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-04-10", "description": "Cemile A. is right about the wait time. We had reservations and wejust stood there while people scrambled around us. They need to figure out how to work the door a little bit and pace the seating...the way they sat the tables  was totally Chinese restaurant style (\"Everybody down! You ready to order everything now?? No? Ok, See you in an hour if I remember you're here.\") and led to our poor experience there.\n\nSo yeah, we got sat. I noticed that they had sat 2 4-tops a 3 and three more deuces along with us at the same time in an effort to clear their door. That's nineteen menus up, for all of you at home who are counting, and that's bad. Sometimes that just means everythings going to go wrong at one table, but usually it just means something goes kinda wrong at every table.\n\nNote to readers: when you see a bunch of tables get dropped at once in a *seafood* restaurant, LEAVE. You may feel inclined to think to yourself, \"Oh, great, they're really doing their best to move the line here/minimize the wait-how hospitable!\" and although that is a pretty natural reaction, it actually causes big problems. When a bunch of tables get sat at once, it means the kitchen's about to get punched hard. That usually leads to your seafood being undercooked (almost always). Trust me. As an ex restaurant manager, I was far more willing to have people get in my face about a wait because I was pacing the kitchen than to have them get in my face about raw fish. No one remembers a wait if there's great food at the end of it. Everyone remembers f'ed up seafood, no matter what the wait was.\n\nFrom the beginning we were rushed. We waited 20 min at the door with reservations and then another 15 min at our table just to be acknowledged. When we were, it was \"You ready to order?\" How about selling me a bottle of wine? And I knew it was going to be one of those dinners because at this point -of course- everybody's freaking slammed. \n\nAnyway, we got some oysters...they were good. We wanted another round of 6 but, our waiter never returned to see if we liked the first six. Finally (I think he was a manager) noticed my bobbing head and he put another oyster order in for us.\n\nFinished our wine, no one's coming back to find out if we want more, I finally have to go back to the door to get a wine list. Ended up getting a glass instead of a bottle because our meals will be half done by the time we order and get it anyway.\n\nMy wife and I both got fish en papillote (the specialty here). They're both totally raw in the middle. No one even bothers to ask if we're enjoying them (but the catch 22 of seafood is that the undercooked part is never the first 3 bites, so even if a server had come back to check on us we wouldn't have known). In fact our server never came back at all. The person who came back to take our plates just asked \"You all done?\" and took our plates, ignoring the chunks of raw fish left on our plates with everything else eaten. \n\nTo be fair, we probably should have gotten up and grabbed a server as soon as we noticed that, but we were both getting full, and what we had was pretty good. We considered the business of the place and what we had experienced up to that point and decided it wasn't worth it because we both already knew we weren't coming back. There's too many great restaurants in our neighborhood to even stress on it.\n\nFinally, we asked for a check and waited for 15 minutes. I honestly figured that we could have walked out and no one would have noticed that we didn't pay and in the chaos probably assume that we had. Thought about that hard but finally asked again and it came...then when the charge came back, there was no pen! Total DIY dining experience.\n\nI know, I know, I should put it on whitewhine, but seriously...the kitchen is able to cook good food, that much is clear. It's the service that is killing it. Bummer...won't be back ever.", "author": "Sbicy Meatball J."}

It also comes with two dipping sauce (cocktail and house vinaigrette) along with the usual lemon and tobasco.\n\nAnother favorite that my friend swears by is the lobster bisque.  I haven't had lobster bisque too many times outside of this, so no point of comparison.  But every time he offers me a spoon, I find myself hard to not go for seconds.  That must count for something right?  \n \nOnly drawback: the bread.  Just skip it.  Don't even touch it.  I know it's tempting, in between your beer and oysters, but please.  You'll just regret it.  \n\nThe best part about this place is that due to its location, barely anyone seems to know about the oyster deal, so its never packed (unlike Hogs Island, where you're practically hovering over strangers).  Parking can be hard, but it's never been too bad.  From the server's attire and ambiance, the place seems to normally draw an older neighborhood client\u00e8le.  But I'm just here for my oysters and beer, so who cares.", "author": "Christina D."}

Don't savvy tourists know to avoid those things and try to pick up flavor from locals instead?\n\nAnd the second warning flag is that it's next to the cable car line. I mean, that's no automatic disqualification, but it sure makes it easy to become a tourist trap, no?\n\nYes, we went in sans reservation, but they seated us quickly! That was the last quick thing all night. It took - wait for it - 14 minutes from when we sat down until got our first acknowledgement from any server. We ordered and waited - wait for it - wait for it some more - 26 minutes for the food. Is that unreasonable? I don't know, I'm hungry!\n\nThe bread and butter were offensive. Cold, hard, and - in the case of the butter - slightly rancid. My goodness. It's not hard to get bread and butter right.\n\nMy dish? \"Potato Crusted King Salmon with pinot noir sauce\". Sounds great! When it finally arrived, it looked pretty good, too. At first glance. I've seen dishes with sauce under the food instead of on top - yeah, it's a presentation thing - but here, the (delicious! wonderful!) sauce was daintily spooned around it, which would become a problem.\n\nAnd the crust? Yes, hash browns. Except the part on top wasn't brown, it was limp. Limp and soggy. The fish? Overcooked to the point of bone dry. I was nearly begging for more sauce by the time I got to the end of it.\n\nThe vegetables on the side were simply steamed (broccoli and carrots) and roasted (potatoes). Good, but lacking in a certain department...\n\nThe worst part about the plate was that I had to do something I haven't done in a restaurant for many years. I reached for the salt shaker. Because my dish didn't seem to include any.\n\nReally, the place isn't so bad for what it's trying to be, but the experience I had there was just such a load of failure.

We get there right at 9, the place is about 3/4 full. \n\nWe wait for about 15 minutes to be acknowledged by a server or host. Several walk by multiple times, but no one looks at or says anything. At that point two seats at the bar open up and we sit down to wait for a table. Bartender does not acknowledge us or offer water, even though we're the only ones at the bar. I brought a bottle of sparkling wine with me and I ask the bartender if he could chill our sparkling for us. He brusquely tells us he'll put it in the fridge and send it out in a bucket when our table is ready. Not sure why he didn't start chilling it right then. . .   \n\nWhile sitting at the bar, I notice that the two servers, bartender, and manager are all bussing glassware to the bar, carrying dirty glasses from above with their fingers inside. Not ideal. Quite disgusting, in fact.  \n\nAnother 10 minutes, our table is ready. I ordered the clam chowder and the stuffed shrimp bearnaise. My girlfriend orders the caesar salad and the potato crusted king salmon. \n\nOur server brings our bottle of sparkling out in an ice bucket. I look inside, and there is only about one inch of water and ice in the bucket. They have some pitchers of water sitting around, so I top it up. \n\nThe clam chowder is good. The caesar had no actual caesar dressing. Instead it was a tasteless mixture of oil and vinegar with lemon. \n\nAfter another 10 minutes, our server offers to open the bottle. He pulls off the cage while talking to us, we duck for cover as he points the uncaged bottle around the room. The wine is a 1999 Schramsberg reserve- 10 years old. \n\nWhen opening old bubbly, it is very dangerous not to keep your hand over the cork at all time. Due to age, the corks lose the flange that keeps them tightly wedged into the neck, and can shoot out immediately. I've opened many bottles of 10-year old bubbly that would have done just that if I had not kept a firm grip on the cage and cork. \n\nHe then manages to break the cork off, with the bottom half stuck in the bottle. Rather than twisting it gently, he had yanked it over to one side and it split. He brings out the corkscrew at this point, and I tell myself that if my $120 bottle of wine fizzes everywhere due to his lack of wine training, I'm going to lose it. \n\nThankfully, he manages to get the cork out and we resume our dinner. \n\nOur food arrives. My stuffed shrimp is not in a bearnaise as on the menu, but rather straight-up clarified butter. The potato crust on the salmon is limp and greasy, and totally bland and unsalted. \n\nMoral of the story, I will never go back to this place. Between the unsanitary conditions, lack of basic service, the general indifference of the manager, and the mediocre food, there are far better places to spend my money.", "author": "Michael H."}

It was a super cute, kitsch little place and even though his reservations were at 7:30, we arrived around 7 and they gave us our table early.\n\nSuper cute and kitsch on the inside as well - the walls were papered with old maps and there were nautical decorations around the room.  There was a candle at each table and it wasn't too dim or bright.  Great ambiance, and my only complaint was that the tables were somewhat close to each other, which doesn't really make for good conversation.\n\nHe had the ahi tuna, I had the snapper en papillotte (wrapped in paper and baked) - it was absolutely amazing.  The fish was amazingly tender and very well-seasoned.  The jullienned vegetables were also tasty, although the potatoes were a bit dry and unflavored, and I had to swirl them around in the juices in order for them to be somewhat palatable.  We also shared 6 raw oysters (which I think gave me the food poisoning, ouch) ..oh so delicious.\n\nThe dessert menu was meh, so we opted to walk a few blocks to Swensens for ice cream.

As it's been said before, oysters are a buck during happy hour. We were there for dinner but we still took full advantage of the happy hour oysters! We got 3 different kinds & I loved them all. The folks weren't big oyster fans so they got the crabcakes that looked delish. We also had to try the lobster bisque since everyone raves about it. I'd have to say they are right! \n\nFor dinner I had the New Zealand seabass en papillote. It was cooked to perfection with fresh, crunchy veggies. Not a lot of seasoning, but I liked it that way. The portions are huge as fish portions go but everything was so light it wasn't overfilling. Everyone else had different types of fish (the halibut was the best in my opinion) and we ate it all. Topped it all off with a bottle of chardonnay. I have to say that the desserts were nothing to write home about so go elsewhere for your sweet fix. We were going to head to Ghirardelli Square for some sundaes but it got too late. Wah! \n\nThe service was great, no need to ever flag anyone down for anything. It may be difficult to get to this place by public transport unless you take the cable cars (they go right by the restaurant). But since they cost $5 these days you are better off taking a cab.

I'm telling you, this is not a 5 star place. \n\n1) We had a reservation, but they made us wait at the bar for 10-15 minutes because no table was ready.\n\n2) The bartender was so rude to my boyfriend! My boyfriend was trying to order a drink, there was some miscommunication about the availability of the drink, and when my boyfriend politely asked -to clarify- if they were out of the beverage, the bartender replied snidely, \"Yeah. That's what I just said.\" It was totally unprofessional and I feared my boyfriend might punch the little a-hole in the face. \n\n3) The food: Not so impressive. The best thing I ate was the Cajun shrimp and scallop appetizer, but it was coated in butter and totally overpriced, which tainted the experience. I am not an idiot- I can tell when a scallop has been cut in half- so we were paying $8 for 1 scallop and 2 shrimp. At this place? \n\nI read so many good things about the bisque, so I figured, \"when in Rome,\" and ordered it. (Normally I don't like cream as an appetizer) Anyhow, it was not as good as everyone makes it out to be. It's far from an authentic lobster bisque and sure, it's heavy on the cream and filled with bits of lobster meat, but the meat tasted like surimi (fake crab). If this is the best lobster bisque you've ever had, I need to take you some places! \n\nOur main dishes were alright. I liked my boyfriend's parchment papered sea bass, but my escolar special tasted like it was bathed in bottled chili sauce. It wasn't refined or amazingly well-executed, although neither of the fish dishes were fishy. \n\nFinally, my boyfriend had the creme brulee, which was super melt-y and apparently tasted like a vanilla milkshake. Either they gave it the blow torch for too long, or it was not chilled long enough. Whatever the cause, it was a definite fail on a rather easy to prepare dessert.\n\n4) Overall analysis: Skip it.

He said DEFINITELY the salmon, and that it was similar to hash browns...hmm..not too appealing being that i dislike hash browns and am not wild about potatoes.  I decided to try the stuffed trout, although ive only tried a stuffed fish once before (which was amazing, in nola).\n\nThe presentation again was subpar--the plates looked like cafeteria style, and my stuffed fish and side items (potatoes. yet again. with green vegetables--which i avoid) were both very dry.

The two sauces that they serve (horseradish/cocktail sauce and red vinegar/garlic sauce) are a great addition to the mollusks.\n\nTheir current selection of happy hour oysters are: Steamboat, Fanny Bay, and Hama Hama.\n\n- The Steamboat oysters are by far the best tasting oysters.  The best way to describe them, as the restaurant does, is \"creamy\".  They are large but very smooth.\n- The Fanny Bay oysters are also a good alternative.  They have a little more texture and flavor.\n- The Hama Hama are a little on the mediocre side.  Even if they were good, they are so small that you barely even get to taste them.  They are disappointingly small and some are really runt sized.\n\nIf I were to get a dozen, I would say get 8 Steamboats and 4 Fanny Bay.  Skip on the Hama Hama, they aren't worth it.  If none of these are in stock, just ask for the \"creamiest\" oysters.  I know, it sounds a little weird, but you'll thank me later.\n\nOh yeah, $2.50 pints.  Stella, Anchor Steam, Sierra Nevada, and Spaten on tap... they are all PERFECT to wash down some quality oysters.\n\nThe staff is also very attentive.

It's not accessible by rail (so you'd have to bus or cab it).  Parking is also fairly horrendous in the area.  We once got a $250 parking ticket for blocking a wheelchair ramp on an extremely steep hill next to a deserted park in the middle of the night.  \n\nIf you do happen to be in the area, though, you can't go wrong with the happy hour oysters and beer.", "author": "Leslie L."}

On our last night in SF, my husband and I decided we really needed to get some seafood before returning to our own landlocked home.  I am so glad we came to Hyde Street.  \n\nFirst off, the decor is awesome!  Dark wood, booths, and tons of vintage maps wallpapering the walls.  Nice and sunny, not too spacious, not too cozy.  Loved it. \n\nThe food.  We started off with dungeness crab cocktail and clam chowder.  The clam chowder had lovely bits of clam swimming throughout, and the crab cocktail was pure crab heaven - it was simply a portion of shelled crabmeat served with cocktail sauce.  Yum! \n\nOur main meals were thus:  He got the Fijian escolar, and I got the stuffed shrimp.  Please, forget the stuffed shrimp (a bit tough, salty, oily), please get the escolar, or something cooked en papillote, their speciality.  I didn't follow my own advice, but my husband's dish was divine.  The escolar (also known as butter fish, similar to a sea bass) was wonderfully cooked - not tough at all, and just simply the best fish I think I've ever had.  The vegetables served alongside both his and my dish were very nicely steamed, and a great accompaniment to our dishes.  \n\nTopped off with a beer and a glass of wine, our meal was reasonably priced ($100 with tip).

Do we want italian, steakhouse, seafood, chinese, Mediterranean? Fine dining, casual, kid friendly, tourist trap? So many choices, not enough time.\n\nWe chose seafood for both nights. Our first night in the city, I decided on Hyde Street Seafood House and Raw Bar, thanks to a recommendation & Yelp. A few things that made my decision easy, PRICE, LOCATION & RECENT REVIEWS. Practically everything on the menu is under $20. And yes, they have an amazing Happy Hour 5-7(even on weekends).  Our reservation was at 6pm, 12 pick n choose oysters for 12 bucks. We ordered them by the truckload. Our party consisted of 14 and our bill was $400 with beers. Unbelievable. The absolute best Ciopinno, I've had. The broth wasn't watery and spicy like other places I've tried in San Francisco. It was thicker, more flavorful and the seafood was cooked perfectly. The lobster bisque wasn't too creamy like the other reviewer described, it was perfect. Every spoonfull packed with shredded lobster, just the way I like it.  The scallops, steak, butterfish, shrimp and salmon were all cooked per-fect-ly  and tasted delicious. The only 2 complaints on the table were the caeser salad and my friend didn't care for his sturgeon fish.  The waiter forewarned him and recommended other fish, but like a stubborn mule, he ordered it anyway.\n\nThe location was a $6 cab from the wharf area. We would've taken the cable car straight up Hyde, but we were late. Hyde Street Seafood House blends right into the residential area with charm. Nautical theme carried throughout the restaurant  and the dining area is very cozy and romantic.\n\nOur server was perfect. Attentive, funny, quick & personable. \n\nThis was not the BEST seafood I've ever had but it was very very good. For under 20 bucks an entree and a 400 buck tab for a big party, this was the BEST seafood restaurant I've ever been to.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting San Francisco with a large or small party.

I really appreciated their friendliness though when he chased us a mile down the street with my wife's handbag after she left it in the restaurant.  \n\nThe `en papilotte` option - fish cooked with potatoes in a paper bag is absolutely delicious and left the fish really tender.

Tonight they had three varieties, all which I had never tried before (but alas, no Kumomotos).  Each type of oyster was excellent, with varying degrees of sweet and mild or salty and metallic.  I made the mistake of ordering their sauteed cajun calamari (blech) and had to order another dozen oysters to refresh the palate.  I doubt I'd come back for their dinner menu, but their raw bar is a good deal.  \n\nOne beef: Someone in the kitchen needs to take a refresher course on shucking 101 because all the oysters came out with too much shell attached to the meat and the juices were a bit grainy.  This, sadly, slowed down my ability to just gulp one sucker after another.  \n\nAs a comparison point I would say, despite the request for better shuckeres, Hyde Street is on par with Hog Island because here they offer you bread and butter so you don't leave really hungry, and you don't have to eat your oysters standing or rushed by the hairy eyeballs of those waiting to take your table.", "author": "Helen C."}

We were early enough for happy hour, enjoying a dozen oysters for half the normal price.\n\nClosest we've found to the atmosphere of a small french bistro, with attentive staff, great food, a decent wine list, and the unique atmosphere away from the tourist spots, all at a very reasonable price.  \n\nOnly complaints are that parking is next to impossible (we tried, gave up and went back to our hotel, then jumped in a cab for a wild ride back in time for our reservation), and the same abandoned Mustang convertible that was sitting out there in December (thought everything in SF got ticketed 2 seconds after the meter expired; guess it's different on Hyde.)  \n\nReally enjoyed this place and intend to make this a regular stop after our move into the city.

The place/neighborhood is extremely cute, the service was very friendly...it's just that the food was just ok. The lobster bisque was pretty good - it was great that it had chunks of lobster - but you couldn't really taste the lobster over the cream. Tried the lobster ravioli as well...tasty, plump raviolis, huge serving...didn't think the onion pieces were necessary in the sauce. Fiance had the stuffed prawns which were pretty good but drowning in butter.\n\nFrom the reviews, it sounds like this place would be much better for HH versus dinner.

I went to Hyde Street last night with a few friends and left with mixed emotions...\n\nThe food was tasty. I started with the soft shell crabs, which were a bit small, but delicious and served with a perfectly dressed mixed green salad. For my entree, I tried the special lobster ravioli, served with crab meat, shrimp and scallops and once again, I was pleasantly surprised. Dessert let me down though. I had the bread pudding, which was prepared in a way I've never seen it before- essentially chunks of break doused in a super-sweet, marginally banana flavored  sauce. It was so sweet that it was almost painful...and I likes me some sweets. Some pretty decent wines and tasty english breakfast tea rounded out my experience, landing them a 4-star rating from me for food.\n\nOn decor, I think others have nailed this. Cute place, good for a date night, but not so overly romantic that you couldn't go with friends and family.\n\nService, however, was a whole different beast. When I drop $70 a head for dinner, I expect 4-star service and here, our friends at Hyde Street greatly disappointed. We had a 7:30 reservation and weren't seated until almost 8:30, only to wait another 15 minutes before being acknowledged by a waiter. When all was said and done, we left the restaurant at about 10:45. I'm sorry, but I just can't see spending 3+ hours at a restaurant that you had a reservation at unless you're being served 5+ courses or have a party of 10 or more. The amount of idle wait time we experienced was truly unacceptable and will likely keep me from going back, despite the tasty food.

It's like a postcard. It looks like a cozy neighborhood restaurant, and with the cable cars going by, it's very San Francisco (or at least, what tourists think of when they think of San Francisco).  The interior was as nice. Yes, those are old maps on the walls, and I saw (but did not sit in) the plank wood booth seats. It's not a brand new building, and it looks like they did the best with what they had.\n\nI strategically arrived in time for the end of happy hour, and got a dozen oysters and a beer. YUM. The oysters were fresh and briny. I did have a few pieces of shell in the meat and liquid though. My wife doesn't eat oysters (I know!!) so she had the lobster bisque which was equally divine. Oh, and they brought us bread & butter, which they were not stingy about refilling.\n\nFor our main course, I had a whole steamed crab, and she had seared scallops in a ginger cream sauce. Both were yummy, and the steamed vegetables that came with our meals were fantastic. There was a great cream cheese & chive sauce with our potatoes. \n\nFor dessert, she had the key lime pie and I had the creme brulee. Again, both were really great.\n\nWe got out of there for just over $100 with tip for two. Ironically, it wasn't my beer that drove up the price -- my wife (who doesn't drink) had three cokes and they charged her individually for those. That's such a downer for a restaurant that is clearly making bank from us.\n\nAs we paid our check, the server asked if we would like him to call us a cab. I have never been asked this before and it was quite a nice surprise. A DeSoto cab (my favorite) arrived within 5 minutes. \n\nThe place was about half filled with tourists, but I would not call it a tourist trap. We're locals and felt just as much at home there as we do at some of our other favorite restuarants.\n\nEverything was good, but it wasn't over-the-top fantastic for 5 stars.

Finally somewhere you don't walk out of feeling cheated.\n\nHyde Street has all these things in abundance. They have $3 beers, $12/dozen oysters that are fresh and grit free, one of the greatest interiors in San Francisco, warm, well mannered and welcoming staff, oh and the food is pretty good.\n\nWhen friends come to visit, one of my best tricks is to sight see and then end up here for happy hour.

The vibe was too quiet as the restaurant was virtually empty on a Saturday night at 9 p.m. While we were there, two more parties were seated, but there was no excitement.  The meal started with off-the shelf stale bread (not even heated), that was so bland we chose to forego it. The second course of  lobster bisque was barely warm enough to eat and bland. The best course was the entr\u00e9e of mixed fish (monk, shrimp (2), and scallops (but just 1) in a creamy lemony sauce.  The other diner had grouper in parchment, which was well-seasoned but missing salt.  Dessert looked promising - fresh berries and cream, until we tasted it and immediately put our spoons down. The cream seemed to have absorbed all of the tastes in the refrigerator. When we told our waitperson that it wasn't fresh, she protested that it had only been there \"for two days.\"  REALLY?

A few other yelpers have mentioned it, but the place is rather chilly even though I was in a super thick sweater, I was freezing by the time I finished.

Started with the oyster sampler, and my oh my, were some of them small!  They weren't as cold as I would've liked.  Another downside was that every time I swallow an oyster, there would be bits and pieces of the shell with it.  It'd also be nice if the person shucking the oysters would cut the muscle out for us to eat too.  Compared to Tomales Bay, these are incomparable, but I guess these will suffice if I want a quick grab.   \n\nNow the escargot... was NOT WORTH IT.  They were overcooked and was just soaked in oil.

I'm a sucker for sitting at a bar, sushi or otherwise, and being able to order food as my appetite demands is perfection to me. This place is one of those unique restaurants that you can order one dish at a time and not feel guilty.\n\nCome early, around 5 or 5:30, deny the table, and sit at the small bar and chat it up with one of the friendly employees. Go a few times and you'll be family. Ask them for suggestions, they won't steer you wrong.\n\nAs for ordering, start with oysters. During Happy Hour (5-7 Monday-Saturday, I think) you can get a dozen for $12. They rotate their oyster offerings, but always have three to choose from. It's rare that their oysters aren't up to snuff, so go for gold and get a mixed plate. Then, when you get seconds, you can choose your favorites.\n\nI rarely order anything other than appetizers. Although solid, the entrees don't have the same appeal to me as eating a bunch of small appetizers. Try the cajun seafood combo, a bowl of clam chowder, or a salad. Check their daily menu for what's in season. You can get a bunch of small plates for the same price as one entree, plus it keeps your taste buds fresh and allows you to build a perfect meal.\n\nI highly recommend the lobster bisque. This creamy soup along with a beer and a dozen oysters is almost enough to act as a meal. It's rich with lobster and perfect on a rainy day.\n\nAfter you've had your fill of dinner, please try dessert. They have an amazing banana bread pudding with enough butter to stop your heart, though surprisingly easy to enjoy. If the banana bread pudding sounds too rich, they also usually offer fresh berries with whipped cream which is a much gentler ending.\n\nIt's easy to imagine this place as a fairly ordinary place if you do the three-course-sit-down thing, but if you like eating small plates, this place is extraordinary with one of the most enjoyable Happy Hours in the city.", "author": "Timothy P."}

The sauces they came with were pretty basic but good.\nI ordered the stuffed shrimp which were competently prepared but not original either. They had a b\u00e9arnaise sauce over the top which unfortunately \"broke\" because it looked like it was put on before being set under the broiler. They were moist, buttery and good.\nMy friend had the crab en croute. I thought it was a bit soupy inside and too rich for me. It was buttery and creamy with a hint of nutmeg in the sauce. Perhaps if I was eating it with the puff pastry the sauce wouldn't have been so overwhelming. He enjoyed it so I think I may be judging it too harshly.\nWe ended with the chocolate torte which was dry and not well prepared. I assume they do not have a pastry chef on staff and it shows. I can forgive them for this.\nOverall I would return for the oysters and to try the selection of fish prepared en pappillote.", "author": "Rob C."}

They include:\n\n-Bread wasn't that great for being a somewhat nicer restaurant.  Some nice sourdough would be better.  Or a good baguette. \n-We got oysters to start.  While the oysters were good, many of the shells were cracked, indicating the person shucking was not doing a good job.

For my entre I ordered the potato crusted king salmon with pinot noir sauce. It was excellent.  I've tried several potato crusted fish dishes in the past and I've had the same issue with each of them. It's a difficult technique to cook the fish properly while keeping the potato adhered to the fish and cooked all the way through.  Often the dishes are under-seasoned or just plain boring b/c of that fact.  There was absolutely nothing I could complain about with my dish.  The potatoes were slightly crispy on the outside and the entire package was perfectly seasoned in a way that worked wonderfully with the slightly sweet pinot sauce.  My vegetables were cook al dente - just the way they should be.  The waitstaff was attentive and polite.

The three of us were seated right on time with a nice table in the front room. I chose this place because my sister is somewhat of a picky eater but loves seafood. The hook for Hyde St. Seafood House was the \"En Papillote\" preparation...parchment baking of fish with potatoes and veggies. Sister and gf both had snapper and salmon that way. I went for the seafood special of Scallops, Shrimp, and Escolar/Butterfish. The food was fantastic and reasonably priced too. This is a perfect place to get your seafood fix (and the oysters hit the spot too). One gripe I had was we sat with our finished dinner plates in front of us for 10-15 minutes which is a pet peeve of mine.

We recently went to Hyde Street Seafood based on a recommendation, and I have to say, without a doubt, this was the worst seafood meal I have experienced outside of the midwest. Where to start?\n\nThe appetizers. For me the lobster bisque, which was surely unlike any bisque I have ever experienced before, but in a decidedly bad way. It tasted like the bisque equivalent of Campbell's Clam Chowder, compared to the really great chowders you have tasted. My wife suffered through some crab cakes that were short on crab, barely warm, and of a gooey texture reminicent of mochi. 0 for 2.\n\nOn to the main courses. I was served some sea bass covered in a very sweet cranberry sauce, alongside some basic steamed brocolli and green beans (seriously? is this 1982?). The fish was overcooked but edible, but the sauce was completely overpowering and way too sweet. 0 for 3.\n\nMy wife's dish was quite a bit worse - various seafood cooked in parchment. Again, severly overcooked. The scallops were as hard and rubbery as hockey pucks. The halibut was bland and dry. The herb mix was not enough to disguise that this was low quality (likely frozen) seafood that was cooked at least 5-10 minutes too long. She barely touched the dish - it was simply that bad. 0 for 4 with 4 swinging strikeouts.\n\nAt this point, we decided to cut our losses and pay the bill, skipping on the weak offerings of dessert (key lime pie? - again is this 1982?). Overall, this was quite a bit worse than what you would receive at a Red Lobster, and appalingly bad for a city I assumed to have good seafood.", "author": "Ryan A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-08-16", "description": "I suppose I should preface my review by stating that until 2009, I'd never really been to San Francisco before, perhaps a remarkable thing for being 24 years old and a native of California.  Anyway, I ended this 24 year drought torrentially, visiting SF three (3) times in a span of six (6) months. During each stay, I visited Hyde Street Seafood House.  \n\nFittingly, I found Hyde Street Seafood House on Yelp, when my friend and I were on what was essentially my maiden voyage into SF while on a cross-country road trip to Boston.  I'm a big seafood fan, and I simply wanted to eat some good seafood during my first stay in SF, and after scouring Yelp recommendations, I settled on Hyde Street Seafood House.  I had the salmon en papillote, and about nine (9) or ten (10) glasses of ice water.  The king salmon was awesome, and the food and dining experience made the approximately one mile walk to this place worth it.  \n\nThe second time I visited this place, three (3) months later, I'd driven up to SF on short notice for a job interview and figured I'd return to the only place I'd ever eaten at in SF, even if I was going to be dining solo.  The salmon en papillote was great, but the service was second-rate this time; even though it wasn't that busy, simple things like bread and water refills took forever.  I also noticed that they apparently raised the price of the king salmon en papillote in the three or so months since I'd last been here, which vexed me a bit.  Still, my meal was good.  And this time, I took the cable car to and from the restaurant, which made for a decidedly San Franciscan experience, at least in my mind.\n\nThe third time I visited Hyde Street Seafood Cafe, I did so in the company of two high school friends and a mere month after my second visit. We made the same mile or so walking journey to Hyde Street Seafood Cafe that I'd done months earlier.  For the third time in a row, I ordered the same entree (king salmon en papillote) and wasn't disappointed.  Same solid meal.  And this time, the service was considerably better.  Both friends seemed to really enjoy their meals and the experience, and one of them said so explicitly.\n\nAnyway, after three visits here, I think I've gotten a pretty good appreciation for Hyde Street Seafood Cafe.  The bottom line, at least in my mind, is that this place serves really solid seafood and is in a great, picturesque location.  Service is generally pretty good but occasionally mediocre.  Anyway, next time I'm in SF, I'll head to Hyde Street Seafood Cafe again.", "author": "Lance M."}

She kept telling me to forget it, it is not worth going there.\n\nFinally she gave in one evening.  \n\nWhy  didn't  I  listen to someone that lives 300 ft away from this place!!!

What tourist could resist jumping off for a seafood dinner at such a quaint looking place?\n\nAs a dining experience, well, forget about it.  There are hundreds of better places to go...anywhere!!!\n\nThe interior is tacky, no big deal, but the food shouts out 'frozen and cheap'.   The fish I had (snapper) was bland - En Papillote because it is an easy way to cook frozen fish which they probably have a freezer full of.  .   I can see it now... order comes in for snapper en papillote, no problem, grab a frozen stack out of the freezer, get a knife, wedge it in between the fillets that are stuck together, bang bang bang, ahhhh, separated!!! Wrap it in foil with a dab of butter and toss it in an oven (or steamer for all I know) and voila!!!...off to the fool at table 12.\n\nVegetables?   So over steamed  they were like mush. \n\nThey may be better than the meals at the Pacific Medical Center hospital on Castro & Duboce, but if you ask me I say it is a toss up.  If you think highly of Red Lobster or Olive Garden, I would say give it a shot, but I would never recommend this place to anyone - I would get voted off the island if I did that!!\n\nI guess my gf figured that the only way to get through my thick head was to let my find out for myself.

Meaty, clean, and delicious.\n*lobster bisque: I've never had lobster bisque. Infact, my tummy rejects cream in a most uncomfortable way and yet, I could not stop eating the stuff. This is a MUST-ORDER. \n*crab cakes: lovely crab flavor. A little softer than I prefer, but I do not regret the order.\n*prawns bernaise: prawns swimming in melted herb-butter stuffed with a puree of scallop, lobster, and crab (I believe). Rich and heavy. Not as unbelievable as it sounds, but the prawns were cooked perfectly.\n*shellfish en papillote: I guess I forgot how appreciable the true flavor of seafood is. I was thoroughly impressed with this simple dish, and savored the taste of clam, mussel, prawn, and scallop. The julienned veggies that accompanied were nice, steeped in all the shellfish liquor. \n-- All with a few glasses of white wine. Good service.

Our server attempted light small talk but seemed to tire of that before finishing his sentence.  Then with a weak smile he enticed us with happy hour specials before we touched the menu.  Smart move.  For having dinner on an early Sunday evening we were rewarded with a selection of 12 oysters for $12 and a $2.50 pint of Stella and Sierra.  A soft, \"Cheers\" was whispered as he dropped of our pints then gave us a brief explanation of a couple dishes.\nNot to be ignored, and not on happy hour, were the garlic steamed clams.  They were tender and garlicky with plenty of sauce to soak my bread.  We were full before we ordered dinner, but the gluttons we are, we ordered two more dishes, cioppino and a fettuccine Alfredo.  \nThe cioppino was delicious with mounds of luscious seafood, crab, scallops, shrimp and clams.  Each cooked to perfect buttery firmness.  The tangy and slightly spicy broth warmed my tummy on a blustery summer evening.  The creamy seafood pasta was slightly smokey with similar perfect seafood atop.  \nI was extremely happy with everything about our dinner, from the nautical atmosphere to the full window view from our table to the reasonable prices ($19 for cioppino).

It's nestled in a predominantly residential neighborhood so parking is pretty tough. Their service is friendly and helpul. The waiter even went so far as to tell me what NOT to get, as well as his favorite dishes.\n\n So this place is supposedly famous for a particular way they prepare their fish, which is wrapping the fish and some veggies in parchment paper and baking it. This is supposed to retain flavor and moistness of the fish. So we ordered the halibut and the fish was very moist, not dry by any means. Other than that though, the fish was ok. It tasted fresh, but was pretty bland in flavor. The veggies in the parchment package were also not very flavorful. \n\n Their seafood salad was good with really fresh tasting baby shrimp, lump crap pieces, and smoked salmon. A pretty small salad for ~12 bucks though. Their lobster bisque was pretty good...it tasted like their base was pureed corn, and the bisque was yellowish in color. It didn't have a strong lobster aroma to it...the pieces of lobster were almost like the consistency of crab since it was a lot of little itty bitty pieces in the bisque. Tasty, but not amazing. \n\n The stuffed shrimp was pretty good; a little salty and quite buttery. The cioppino was good. The soup was tasty, the shrimp in it was ok, the mussels were pretty good, the big scallops were good, but the baby scallops weren't so good.\n\nOverall, good ambiance, good service, great oysters, everything else is pretty standard for a seafood place. Their menu is pretty eclectic from cajun style scallops and shrimp to steak to their french preparation of fish. Wouldn't mind coming back for the oysters. Three people with three entrees, a salad, a soup, oysters = $100.\n\nP.S. Happy hour between 5-7. Dozen oysters for $12 (SO WORTH IT) and a few types of beers for $2.50.", "author": "Christine L."}

As an entree, anything ordered 'en papillote' - the traditional French technique of baking julienned vegetables, fresh herbs, white wine, and a selection of fresh seafood in parchment paper to seal in the food's natural flavors and juices - is guaranteed to be outstanding. The cioppino is a delicious blend of clams, mussels, prawns, fish, scallops, and crab meat in a rich marinara sauce. Your carnivore companions will be satisfied with pepper-crusted New York steak or pan-roasted pork chops with sauteed onions.

It felt like an old school cheesy fishouse divey restaurant - something you would find down in Fishermans Wharf.  And thats how the menu read too.  Is this place trying to be \"french\"?  a french seafood restaurant?  sounds like that could be charming... but SO not.  I did get my glass of wine and that took the edge off a bit.  I wasnt super famished so just ordered the escargot. Usually, that and some bread can be just fine for a lite dinner.  I have never been so grossed out - the snails (yes - snails, not escargot) were garden variety - litterally. They tasted like something my mother could have wrangled up from her yard. They were soaked in oil with no seasoning AT ALL. (UGH... just thinking about it...i think i just threw up a little in my mouth)  They were so nasty that i actually had the waiter take them away. He didnt bother to ask if everything was ok or wonder why i requested he take them away.  I guess,  to be fair, i could tell from the moment we walked in that service was not going to be stellar - just a hunch - and it proved to be correct. Although the guy next to us was getting the red carpet treatment. All through our \"meal\" it was \"oh how is everything Steven\" and \"what can i bring out for you Steven\" and \"would you like another drink Steven\" and so on...  and EVERYTIME the server/manager/owner? went to \"Stevens\" table, (which by the way, they had to squeeze by ours to get to),  she didnt even glance our way.\nJust really bad bad bad... dont go people. dont go.", "author": "nicole w."}

Not only is the food consistently fresh, innovative, and delicious, but the wonderful owner often visits the tables personally. Surprisingly, my fiance and I can get a table at 8:00pm on most weekends - it's a true neighborhood gem.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-09-15", "description": "Yesterday afternoon (9/14/2011), I realized just how powerful my craving for lobster bisque had become.  And so, I convinced a friend to join me for dinner at what was said to be (so says the Googleweb) the best lobster bisque in San Francisco.  We enter the restaurant near 6:30 p.m., which was apparently early for their dinner rush; as we were one of two tables seated.  The interior of the space felt clean and did not at all smell like fish.  The dining room is separate from the waiting and restroom areas, which made me feel even more confident about the cleanliness.  I ordered a glass of Prosecco, my friend a white wine; and both of us order a bowl of the lobster bisque.  Soon, a bread basket with an ample amount of butter (in a small dish) arrives to the table.  The bread is served at room temperature, and tastes fresh.  It is not chewy or too moist like a dessert bread (which was nice!).  On the table is a candle in a small decorative storm glass.  The candlelight makes me notice that the linen table cloths are actually covered with a white butcher paper square, which doesn't really make sense when you are at dinner at an expensive seafood restaurant.  At any rate, the soup arrives and is served in a white stoneware bowl with a typical soup spoon.  Upon my first spoonful, I am delighted to find that not only could you taste the lobster, but you could see the pieces of it throughout the dish.  The temperature of the soup cooled-off quickly, which is my only complaint.  The temperature of the restaurant was comfortable to me as I wore a short-sleeved blouse.  By the time we left, each of us paid about $20 (including tip) for the meal, and the restaurant was full.  I would feel comfortable taking a client to this restaurant, and would be interested in going back for an entree.", "author": "Alisha F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-02-09", "description": "I don't like raw oysters, but I had them here, and they were good. \n\nOk, so I'm a foodie, so I will review the food 1st, and service, ambiance, convenience, etc. later. \n\nFood:\n-- Raw Oyster Sampler of 6: Came in a silver tray filled with ice, a center cocktail sauce topped with something yellow (ginger?) which we did not get around to eating, as the waiter recommended we use the alternate dipping sauce of what looked like red wine vineagrette with shallots (can't be certain on the sauce) which was such a good complement to the fresh oysters, we dared not overpower the oysters with it. But, it's nice to have the choice. 3 types of Oysters were on the menu... so we sampled them all. Our favorite ended up being the \"Washintonian\"-- very plump, rich, and juicy. Two other types- one from the Bay Area was very briny/sea like...still good if you like that, and the other from British Colombia was more neutral, ok. My friend said,\"Should have trusted the waiter and gone with all Washingtonian... \".   \nAppetizer: Ahi- Sesame Seared: fresh, on a bed or greens, with a cheerful cherry tomato garnish, and pink ginger. Slightly chewier than I'm used to, but then I ate the more cooked ends and my friend ate the more raw middle. (Note: I actually don't really like raw fish, so maybe I'm not the best person to review this dish.) Good, but I've had better. \n \nSoup: Clam Chowder... creamy, perfect, with chunks of potato and clams, a good aroma, garnished with a sprig of parsley, artfully placed not so that it looked like I had a small tree or piece of moss in my soup-- like most places have-- but like a welcoming coat of arms resembling the \"Fleurs de Lys\". It was also first class delicious. I have had MANY clam chowders, and this restaurant has THE BEST CLAM CHOWDER very. My friend tasted it too, (she didn't want any at first... said she was stuffed) but the chowder was that good that she ripped off a piece of the bread from our bread basket and dipped it in for a few more tastes. \nMain course: Shrimp Bearnaise- 5 BIG shrimp topped with a lobster/crab/scallop cake type thing in a tarragon sauce accompanied with potatos, cute little carrots, green beans, and yellow squash. Exceptionally unusual, and rich. Yummy.\nThe sea bass with tomato and jalapeno pepper baked in parchment paper, their specialty, was well presented, and came on a bed of julienned squash and various vegetables and a side of potatos. It was mild, not as rich as what I'm used to having sea bass taste like, and healthy. Some yelpers have complained that the fish in parchment paper is bland or tasteless...mmm, sort of... I would call it 'healthy'. What you see is what you get... the fish was fresh, portions generous, and it was a good match for the shrimp bearnaise which was a bit too rich.\n\nAmbiance: Cute, cozy. Good for a date or special occasion or for happy hour oysters (I've heard, but not yet made it to happy hour) We went for my friend's b-day. Mellow, not uppity. \n\nService: Really nice, generous, friendly waitstaff. They let you taste the wine if you're not sure what you want.  Let us sit in a comfy booth in the back with room for 4 instead of a small table in the middle of the room for 2 upon request.  \n\nConvenience: Easy to book a table on opentable.com Also, they were friendly and took my restaurant.com certificate. This made up for the fact that street parking is pretty much nonexistant in the Russian Hill Neighborhood and the closest garage at Pacific and Polk costs $10. That's fine, but lest you circle the block in vain, and in pain, trying to find an open space, the parking garage is about 2 blocks way, is actually for a Sports club, and if you want to eat late,( when we went they said they locked the doors at 8 PM), you have to go over to the nearby Paint store parking lot, pay for a ticket to some guy in a jacket, and then cross over the street again and park at the Frame store's parking lot.  \n\nSo... in summary:\nFood Highlights: Excellent Raw Oysters and the BEST CLAM CHOWDER in the world. \nService: Excellent\nAmbiance: Charming\nParking: A bit of a headache.. but the cable car also stops near by. \nWould I go again? Yes.", "author": "Karen W."}

While we sat at the bar, the bartender began to chat with us about what we had planned for the evening. After my boyfriend metioned where we were eating( a decently expensive restaurant) the bartender said, \"oh you must be doing the dine about town,\" ( a month long pre-fix speical that restaurants do in the winter to generate business). Now, there is nothing wrong with dine about town, it's a great way to eat at great SF restaurants for less, but it put us off that he would just assume that we could only be going to this restaurant if they were having some kind of deal. Then, a few minutes later the manager/ owner came over and joined the conversation. After mentioning we were students she said her daughter was comming into town and wanted a cheap place to stay. She went on to say that we must know a bunch of cheap places to stay. Umm no, sorry lady.

We were at Hyde Street Seafood Restaurant.  2 of the girls do not like raw oysters so the 4 dozens of oysters were split among the three of us.  Yum!  I could have more of the oysters if we did not decide to have dinner at the same spot.  I think my record was having around 60 oysters at Hog Island in the Ferry Building.  That was a company event so everything was free.  I guess it is true that people tend to eat a lot more if it's free.  Anyway, besides oysters, we also had the scallops wrapped with bacon.  Everything with bacon tastes super delicious!  For entree, I had cioppino, which is not too bad.  I did not enjoy it that much because I had way too much food before the entree was served.  I had some fish baked in the parchment paper at this restaurant before.  It was really really tasty!\n\nI wondered why the restaurant uses soju for the cocktails instead of vodka or any kind of hard liquor.  The bartender told us that was the ordinance of the City.  All restaurants along the cable car line, from California to Lombard, cannot serve any hard liquor because they don't want some drunks cross the street and hit by the cable car.  Funny, huh?  Some people get so drunk from drinking champagne...  Anyway, I learned one thing by dining out and had a great girls' night out.", "author": "Michelle H."}

Maybe yelpers are inexperienced with good seafood or maybe they're \"sucker[s] for restaurants on this tree-lined portion of Hyde Street,\" as one yelper put it.\n\nI've been to the restaurant twice, once with a friend and her family and once on a date.  The first time I remember thinking that the fish was okay, but nothing special.  The second time I was looking for oysters, it was late at night, and I didn't want to go far.  The restaurant is conveniently located in relation to my apartment, and I'm also magnetically drawn to the restaurants on this quaint block, so I figured I'd give it another shot.  After visiting, it's been decided that the fish is reliably mediocre, and not worth the price.  The restaurant isn't ridiculously expensive, but it still isn't worth it.  It's worth noting that the oysters were delicious, and I would go back for the happy hour.  I believe it's 5pm - 7pm every day, with $1 oysters and cheap beers.  My date liked her clams, so maybe you're safe if you stick with the appetizers in general.  However, the caesar salad was no better than one you'd pick up pre-made at Trader Joe's for $4, the bread is white, (read bland), and the fish is boring.  Stick with the raw bar and you'll be ok, but avoid the entrees and anything else between the appetizers and the drinks.\n\nI give the place points for friendly service and, again, for the oysters, but that's about it.  The christmas lights out front in the trees are cute, but the cheesy decor inside contributes to my assertion that this place could be much better, if only the owners strove for a more substantial dining experience rather than relying on the cuteness of the location to bring in customers.", "author": "Michael F."}

They have a DAILY happy hour for the oysters at a buck a shuck and they usually offer you whatever amount (1/2 dozen or dozen) with mixture of the 3 kinds they have. I'm a bit picky about the kind of oysters I like - I'm not into creamy big ones, I like small, light but a tad briny ones like (gasp too expensive) those Kumamotos! Unfortunately they didn't have any of those but they did have some light ones and were nice enough to let us have another 6 of just that kind since the other 2 kinds were creamier. I appreciated that adjustment and their cocktails were ok but they were only $6 so can't complain (we had margarita and appletini) but did taste a tad watered down.

Nice horseradish sauce accompanying the crab, although for those with low heat tolerance it might be wise to ask for it separated from the cocktail sauce.\n\nI got the Halibut en papillote and my girlfriend got the stuffed prawns, and we were both very impressed.

I read the reviews before visiting and honestly I agree more with the negative reviews more than the positive ones.  Lobster Bisque was NOT the best by any means.  I think the bisque at the Nordstrom bistro was a far better bisque.  The one here was a decent soup - but it was more of a mixed seafood (maybe crab?) creamy chowder than a bisque.  The halibut special was dry and not flavorful.  The seafood salad was a tiny little plate with many shells mixed in with the seafood.  Someone else in the party had the seafood fettuccine which was so disappointing - the sauce tasted exactly like the jars of pre-made alfredo sauce that you can buy yourself.  I had the mixed shell fish in parchment paper which flavor wise was ok but out of the 4 mussels that were in there 3 was completely clammed shut.  All the clams had something crunchy in there - either sand or parts of the shell.

I eat out probably ten times a week between lunch and dinner, and this was the very first time EVER I simply could not eat both my starter and my entree. I mean, not a lick. Usually I'll just pick at bad food and avoid returning to a place, but the arrogance, bad service, and bad food were so egregious i had to comment to the manager, when i finally found him. Turns out he didn't care. It went like this: We started out loving the neighborhood and feeling lucky we found such a nice, charming place with an amazing menu. It was Monday night and not very busy, and we were seated right away. That's when it went bad. The host/server/manager disappeared for 20 minutes before taking our drink order. OK, that was a long 20 min. but not the end of the world...my date ordered the seabass, i ordered the roast dungenous crab, and we split a green salad. After another 20 min. or so, the salad came without much dressing, so i asked for more on the side. It came about 10 min. later, and i quickly dumped it on my salad as i was starving. Too bad it was not dressing, but pure oil. Salad ruined, I tried in vain to get ahold of someone to get a new one. Never happened. The next time we saw anyone was after another interminable wait and they were delivering our entrees. I mentioned the salad but the server was 100% unconcerned. No apology, no offer of a replacement or refund. Nothing. Now we're really starving, and I feasted my eyes on the $35 crab, which was about the size of my hand. No kidding. It honestly looked like a slightly oversized soft-shell crab, and worse, had been \"roasted\" so long the brittle shell and rubbery \"meat\" would not have appealed to a starving alley cat. I was really hungry but this was ridiculous. Another long wait and finally the manager is tackled, but merely looks at me like i am crazy and cannot see anything wrong with the speciman before me. He takes it away, without apology, and says he'll take it off the check. What a sport. My date's seabass is ok, a little dry, but the whole service experience has soured her by this time as well and we ask for the check. The guy is just shaking his head and disappears, during which time an asian lady appears and tells me she checked the crab and it was fine. They were actually arguing with me during service (or lack thereof) about my perception of how a crab should be cooked! Again, I have never rejected an entire meal in my life before...and even with the worst service never have left less than 10% tip. Check came ($40, for what? I didn't even look...) left 5%, and joined yelp. I know places have bad days, but really, at least apologize to the customer for a bad experience. One star for location.", "author": "justin w."}

Since she likes raw oysters, searched on Yelp for suggestions and good eats and finally decided on Hyde Street Seafood House and Raw Bar.  And it was a great choice!   We started with raw oyster and clams and they were fresh and sweet.  We have a party of five and decided to order a few Starters to share first.   We ordered the Lobster bisque, Escargot with Garlic Herb Butter, Steamed Clams, Garlic Roasted Petite Maine Lobster Tail, which were all DELICIOUS.  Afterwards, we ordered three more Entrees to share.  I got to admit, the Entrees were not too impressive.  The Starters were a lot more appetizing and tasty.   Thus, I give it an overall four stars.", "author": "Maggie L."}

One word...HORRIBLE...to describe the food, service, atmosphere.  My fiance and I felt like we were in some cheesy eatery at Fisherman's Wharf.  We would have been able to overlook all this if either the food or service was decent...BUT we ended up spending $160 for cheap, 'can' tasting lobster bisque, soft-shelled crab that was overly fried and sat too long before coming to us that it was soggy!  It took us over 1 HOUR to get our appetizers and the waitstaff was ambivalent to it all.  Finally we just asked to wrap up our main course and dessert to go!!!!  This place is maybe one of the WORST places I have ever eaten and will NEVER go back...would rather have a big Mac at Mickey D's!", "author": "Marsha L."}

Draft beers for $2.50 and a dozen oysters for $12.  Can't really beat that.  Especially when there are tons of seats and live jazz!  There were lots of other things on the menu, but we just had oysters and soup.  Fellow yelpers did not steer me wrong, the lobster bisque was DELISH!  One of my friends said it was too salty for her, but I disagree, I thought it was perfect.  Another friend had the clam chowder, which I did not taste but she said it was great.  The bread was yummy too.  The only thing I would skip next time I go is the baked oysters.  I was really excited about them, having had yummy ones at the Buckeye in Marin, but these did not taste all that great to me.  The raw oysters however, were fantastic.  All three types tasted super fresh, and the selection of different types was fun.  I tried to see if I could actually taste a difference (I could, and preferred whichever ones were the largest).  A great, and relatively inexpensive, way to gorge myself on oysters - I will def be back here!", "author": "Lindsay B."}

The atmosphere was great, but not for a romantic date for sure.  It's really loud inside..especially when people had too much wine they started yelling and clapping. Anyway, despite all that noise, we enjoyed our lobster bisque, lobster ravioli and sea bass en papillote. The lobster bisque was on the heavy side, but the bits of lobster meat was a pleasant surprise. Not sure if it's a good idea to order lobster bisque and lobster ravioli on the same night, but the ravioli was equally delicious.  Sea bass was moist and cooked just right, the veggies on the side were pretty good.  I regret not trying their oysters, as my friend doesn't eat anything raw.  Waiters were polite but they're definitely short of waiters.  Would highly recommend large parties to make reservation and be prepared to spend a good 20 minutes to find parking.\nP.S. Skip the bread. It's not that great.", "author": "Winnie Y."}

After reading all of the yelp reviews, we decided to give it a try and found the experience about average. The food was decent - we both had the lobster bisque though it was super rich in a heavy cream sauce with generous bits of lobster (I am not big on heavy cream). We also each had one of their signature paper wrapped dishes. I was a bit disappointed when 2 of my 4 mussels were closed up (you should not eat mussels or clams that have not opened up). Though the shrimp were huge and very tasty (this was the shellfish plate). He had the escarole (butterfish), which was very rich and filling - you will not leave hungry. The wait staff were a bit inattentive as well and the time between dishes was a bit longer than usual as was the wait for the bill. The ambiance was great as other yelpers mention. Overall I give this restaurant a 3 - food was not to-die-for, prices were OK ($80 for 2 with a glass of wine each), service was so-so, and ambiance was good.", "author": "Shannon W."}

Considering what they had on the menu, it was a great deal- I ended up having the caesar salad with dungeness crab meat, filet mignon and jumbo shrimp, and key lime pie while my bf had smoked salmon, whole maine lobster, and creme brulee.  Everything was tasty, came out promptly, service was great- I think there were only 3 servers for the whole restaurant so they were running around, but they were attentive enough for my liking.

We happened to be celebrating our anniversary and they brought us out a surprise dessert which I really wasn't expecting, but remembered I had mentioned it on my OpenTable reservation.  I feel like this never happens anymore -- genuine and real service that makes you feel good that you walked into a place.

If you did not have to wait to be seated and were only ordering oysters and wine, this could be a decent neighborhood place.  However, a sit-down dinner here is a bad call.  We were seated well after our reservation, and they seated two other parties before us that waltzed in late for their reservations.  None of the entrees were anything to write home about and the waiter accidentally plunged his fingers in my friend's beer and had to pause and think about whether or not he should offer to replace it.   And when I say pause, I mean a good, long, silence-creating, glances-exchanged pause.  Not my idea of stellar service.

An anniversary dinner my partner and I could only laugh about at the end of the meal by concocting make believe stories about the possible reasons for such sub par food and the restaurant's history.  The oysters were good, the shell pieces, from improper shucking I imagine, added texture which is different.  We then shared the petite, like Kate Moss petite, lobster tail which had a wonderfully chewy consistency.  The garlic butter sauce that came with it made for great bread dipping!  The prawn/ scallop app was over done and doused with cayenne which actually complemented the wine nicely.  While waiting for entrees, all we could do was smile. Another DING! romantically resonates from the kitchen indicating our final course was probably ready.  We both accept our fate like Romeo and Juliet, because despite this tragedy, we were still in love.", "author": "mystery m."}
