Whoever purchased the building for Tlaloc was smart to build up, not out. Well, they also built out since there's lots of outdoor seating in the alley it's located in. Came here for lunch with a friend and arrived around 11:30 AM before the big rush. \n\nI ordered a carnitas quesadilla, which was delivered to our table upstairs. The salsa was fresh and tasty. Lots of variety for different taste buds. Whatever they used for the tortilla was the best part. Super soft, crispy, and surprisingly flavorful. There was a good amount of carnitas as well. Very filling.\n\nWe came here because my friend is a vegetarian, and I love how the menu is divided accordingly. I'm a huge fan and would come back here again. Other Yelp reviews mention the long wait. I don't like to wait a long time for ANY lunch place in FiDi on the weekdays, so I would just say to plan ahead and get here early.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

We picked different chicken for our tacos but I couldn't really tell the difference.  We paid up front and decided to go sit upstairs on the second level.  Our food was delivered quickly, which was good since my friend had only a small break from work.  The corn tortillas were really good and not too greasy.  The chicken was tender, tasty and all the toppings were fresh.   \n\nTlaloc Sabor Mexicano Resturant's interior design and layout is very unique and decorative.  They have 4 levels and at each level they have a salsa bar with several different types of salsas.

Located in an alleyway, it is not apparent to passerbys unless you had an intent on visiting Tlacloc. \n\nFirst impression: I liked the hustle and bustle of this place. You first walk into an open kitchen and then you are met with two cashiers. You place your order and wait for your order number to be called. \n\nI ordered the Chicken Mole Plate along with a horchata (to-go). I must admit, even for FIDI, this was a super pricey meal (~$19 :( ) \n\nTo be honest, I didn't like that they didn't have plastic sauce containers readily available on the side. The cashier handed me two and it felt weird to ask her for more especially with the huge line of people waiting. I also waited a while (~10 mins) for my food while I saw people that ordered after me get their food first. I'm going to assume the delay was due to this other party having a huge order.\n\nMy chicken mole was good, but it was definitely on the spicy side and less sweet. I thought that they would simmer the chicken in the mole sauce, but I could definitely tell they just scooped the sauce of the chicken. It tasted good, but nothing something I would get again from here. My tortilla was delicious and had a slight chewiness to it. However, the horchata was a tad watery, but it really depends on your taste. In the end, it satisfied my horchata craving. \n\nSurprisingly, I really enjoyed their homemade salsas. The mango salsa was extremely tasty and the salsa verde complemented their chips extremely well! I wish I could just sit their and have their chips and salsas all day long. \n\nWhile this place is on the expensive side, I think it would be nice to actually go up to their 2nd and 3rd floor to have a sit down lunch with friends. I heard that they have salsa bars on each floor, so no need to fight for the salsas on the main floor. :)", "author": "Eva L."}

So glad I did! A friend and I grabbed lunch and we were definitely not disappointed! \n\nFirst, the line moves incredibly fast, which was SO nice! Second, there is a lot of seating for a casual lunch place (upstairs and cute tables outside)!

From managements decision to price tacos so high, to the negligence of the person making the tacos this has been a disappointing experience.  In addition they have no signage telling you where to order, so I am standing there being ignored until I waive someone down to ask where to order.  Be warned this is not a well operated taqueria, a simple visit to any other taqueria in SF will show tacos are cheap, there is an 'order here' and 'pay here' sign, and they use a slotted spoon to serve beans so the bean juice drains away.

Fully operational, the farm itself grows produce for all of Sabor Mexicano restaurants as well as the brand's food products such as their fresh salsas and homemade corn chips. Rows of all different varieties of rich tomatoes and crisp peppers are organically grown to perfection, as well as cucumbers, squashes, watermelon, cilantro, purslane, broccoli, spinach, corn, apples, cabbage and much more, all carefully cultivated with no GMOs, pesticides or harmful chemicals.\"\n\nThis is the best mexican food I've had during my lifetime here in the bay area. I rate this place so highly not just because the salsa is legit authentic, (yet the menu offers items for those who can't handle \"super authentic\") but the because the quality of the ingredients goes above and beyond anything I can find in the South and East Bay Area.  \n\nWhole Foods carries the tortilla chips that are made here, and those are just as delicious as well.  There's a true \"Farm-to-table\" sustainable farming/ ranching /harvesting / consciousness and the meat that's selected for this restaurant is just top-notch.  \n\nI live in the South Bay and have plennnnty of \"flavorful\" mexican places to choose from, but none of them match the quality and care of the ingredients that go into my meals here.", "author": "S A."}

Crispy taco has great texture and flavor but if you let it sit for too long, the sauces seep through the shell making it messy to eat later and significantly less enjoyable in terms of texture. I kind of wish they had drained the ingredients in the taco a bit more so that this wouldnt happen. I could always add more salsa for wetness if desired from their huge selections of salsas. They have a salsa bar on each level so you don't need to stock up just on the first floor.  \n\nOverall, wasn't blown away by the flavor but found it perfectly okay.

And, while that might be (okay, I know it is) fairly incorrect, it wasn't really off from the truth here.\n\nI ordered one of their pollo abodabo burritos, picking up some of their spicier salsas (the green tomatillo and red mango ones) to accompany the burrito and chips. And while the burrito was not bad, and was far better with the salsas, the chicken was on the dry side, and the entire thing was just a bit less flavorful than I'm used to with my burritos. For those of you who are into healthier lunch options though, the burrito definitely felt... healthier (and perhaps that was the issue!).\n\nIf we're just talking about the food, I'd give them a solid 3, but knowing that I can get far tastier Mexican elsewhere, at half the price, I can't bring myself to come back this way.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - I can't speak for seating inside Tlaloc itself, but there's a bunch of outdoor seating out in the street in front of the restaurant itself. Getting down to a table is a bit more difficult, because the lack of spacing between tables means you'll likely need to jump a curb to get to where you want.

The employees are moving so fast to fill orders that the food was flying off the serving spoons in every direction. It was a Mexican food cesspool behind the counter; Black bean juice was pouring off the serving spoon into the rice. Salsa was all over the counter and sneeze guards, avocados were covered in other foods, the preparation station looked like it had been stricken with a salsa bomb, and hadn't been properly wiped down for at least several hours.\n\nI ordered the Ensalada Roja (steak salad), thinking it would be a bit safer than any of the burrito ingredients I saw forcibly co-mingling.... The salad was almost inedible. The cucumbers were limp and yellowing, the other veggies were wilted, the tomatoes were hard and juiceless, and the lettuce tasted unwashed. The meat was way over-cooked, pounded to oblivion, gristly, and stingy. The salad consisted of about 3 oz of steak on 3 pounds of lettuce in a massive bowl.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly, and their salsas were actually pretty good.

The line can be pretty long sine it is close to a lot of skyscrapers. \n\nThe first time I went with a standard burrito (not super, here is why). Although there is only meat, cheese and beans, the salsa bar is so extensive that you can spruce up your burrito. Unless you want the rice, the avocado mild salsa is creamy enough to replace the guac and sour cream. Spiciness, add the different salsas. Mango mix with the Spicy Garlic make a mean sauce. Either dipping in chips or smothering it over your burrito, it will be flavorful. You can opt out and just get the super burrito., but paying 12 for a burrito is not cutting it for me.  The meat isn't very flavorful and there isn't that touch of the mexican style burrito you would get from the trucks. The regular is already close to 10. Save yourself a couple bucks. \n\n1 Crispy Taco is a good choice if you are not too hungry but not full either. It is in between a lunch and a snack. Meat is lean loaded, however not very flavorful.  I believe with tax it was around 5.50.\n\nI had Tlaloc today, and wanted to try something new. Tostada. I did not like.

Not the grease-stained taqueria with the orange-tiled floor, the blaring Tejano music and the glassy-eyed patrons eating bowls of menudo Sunday morning, but a more upscale taqueria that appeals to a wider audience. And I don't mean wider as in wide load; Tlaloc promotes their food as natural, local, blahblahblah we're in San Francisco.  And you can definitely taste the difference. \n\nI know that \"healthy\" isn't always synonymous with Mexican food, but don't be frightened. Nothing suffers; the flavor is still great, but you don't say to yourself, \"damn, that was kind of salty\" as you guzzle your ninth glass of water. \n\nI usually get the chorizo (either pork or chicken) burrito and it's great.

This place certainly has a line at 11:40 am that spills out into the sidewalk. I had never been nor heard of this place prior to yesterday. An ex-coworker would always rant and rave about this great place that does shrimp in the burritos and I was always curious. Finally she took me! \n\nWe thought we were being smart by getting there early but nope, like I said there was still a pretty massive line. I suppose the trick is to call in your order ahead of time, and then you can bypass the line and head directly inside to pay and pickup your food. First I noticed that the inside of the restaurant went up about 2 more additional stories, all floors have additional seating and a salsa bar (which is FANTASTIC btw). There is also cute seating outside in the alleyway. We ordered our food and sat down on the third floor. I went with what my coworker recommended which is the tierra maria burrito which contains your choice of meat (steak or chicken, and I chose chicken) with shrimp, sour cream, rice, black beans, and guac. I thought it was going to be too much to finish but the portion size was actually perfect, or maybe I was just starving! \n\nLet me start off by talking about the salsa bar. It's another thing my coworker kept talking about, and let me just tell you their salsa bar is EXTENSIVE and delicious! They have just about every salsa you would want with every different spice level.. I sampled the mango (mild, with tomatoes) and the avocado. Even though the mango stated that it was a mild sauce, it certainly has a kick to it. The avocado was my favorite because it was very light and creamy and surprisingly packed with flavor. The burrito came out at last with a perfect portion of chips. The chicken, the rice and the beans in the burrito were all ridiculously good on their own but the added flavor of perfectly cooked grilled shrimp REALLY made that burrito a straight up home run for me! I devoured that baby like I was never gonna eat another burrito again. No regrets! Shrimp is expensive, man! You gotta finish all of it! I should mention, I also got the watermelon (juice?) which had chunks of deliciously sweet and refreshing watermelon bits floating in it. \n\nOverall, you really can't ask for a better lunch choice, especially when you're craving really good, really authentic Mexican food.

The guy that answered the phone was kind of difficult to understand so I was skeptical as to whether I would get my food right. We get there to pay and pickup the food and the cashier whom I presume may had taken our order read our order wrong. I think he was new because he needed help from a lady standing next to him. He finally reads the right order and I pay. I give them a small tip. I get back to the office and my order was wrong. I ordered a crispy chicken taco and I got a crispy taco which I think was vegetarian. When you're craving something and it's not right.......stomach is not happy!! Then I realized that he gave me the wrong change as well. He shorted me $1.00. The bill was $35.76 so I gave him $100.76 to get back $65.00. I thought he gave me three $20 and five $1.00. My mistake for not checking. Not the end of the world....but when your order is wrong and given the wrong change plus you tipped, now it's irritating. It's worrisome when the register tells you how much you owe the customer and you still get it wrong. That just tells me you're not paying attention. I would suggest them training this guy more on taking orders and on giving change back to customers. The food is tasty here but they get one less star.", "author": "Tinker B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-09-19", "description": "There are few Mexican options in the Financial District, so already Tlaloc has bonus points for that. The mariscada burrito was quite tasty, studded with moist shrimp and flaky, sweet fish. I appreciated the variety of drinks available and enjoyed the unsweetened green tea. It's rare that a restaurant has chilled drinks which have neither alcohol nor sugar. Some patrons don't want to guzzle empty calories but would prefer a beverge other than ice water. The complementary salsa bar is a nice touch, with the mango (mild) being a standout. \n\nSo, yes, there are good points but also some bad ones to counterbalance them. First of all, the food has a tendency to come out lukewarm. I once ordered a shrimp and nopales burrito and the entire burrito was tepid. The shrimp was also slightly translucent and undercooked. Thankfully I didn't get sick, but it was vaguely unsettling. And while the mariscada burrito was delicious, filling, and not too greasy, it was missing the calamari that was advertised on the board. And speaking of the board, the pricing is not only high but obfuscated. What kind of menu board doesn't show the cost? There's simply an ominous dot where the price would usually be. Two burritos and two drinks totaled over $30. The sticker shock was not cool. It seems prices have gone up since I was last here too. \n\nI do not unreservedly recommend this place but I wouldn't avoid it. My opinion on Tlaloc is as tepid as their burritos sometimes are.", "author": "Busy B."}

They have dining areas outside, interior street level, and 3 on the upper level. All interior dining areas have their own salsa bars which is very convenient. Especially when you come to know your salsas very well and need to see them often. From these levels and below, you can see the cooks prepare food. How cool is that? Always a plus when I can see and feel good about how my food was prepared.\n\nOne con - the metal chairs. I always get my coat stuck on a corner as I pass, and they are not very comfortable. They do have a small area that has more comfortable chairs . I suggest you sit there if you find available seats.\n\nDefinitely one of my favorite spots.", "author": "Shell I."}

I noticed that \"rice\" wasn't listed in the list of ingredients for the regular meat burrito but assumed it was a menu mistake because rice was includes in ALL other burrito descriptions (fish, vegetarian & super meat burritos all have rice).  So I accept that I probably should have known it wouldn't have rice, but how can you call something without rice a burrito??  My chicken & bean WRAP was pretty good, but without the rice it wasn't very filling.  For me, burritos are almost always two meals worth of food but this one definitely was not.  \n\nIf you are on a low-carb diet, then definitely check out Tlaloc.

However, it is fresh and they get 1 star for that.  Nothing extraordinary.  I have tried about 6 different things hoping each time would get better, but it does not.  So the best summation would be:  They did not ruin anything nor did it suck.  It is solidly, consistently, average-ly decent.  Not great.\n\nBut what I hate about Tlaloc is I always feel ripped off by them.  They always short the meal, like they are cutting corners to save a buck.  they charge $2 extra for the chile quiles plate because it includes potatoes.  The cashier says if you want the potatoes you must order the plate not the burrito.  Fair enough.  I like their Chile quiles.  Not bad. Fresh.  You can't fail with fresh.  I pay $2 extra and no potatoes.  In their place was a tiny amount of tomatoes.  She just said pay $2 for potatoes then does not serve them!!! really?  not even a subtle rip off that I would miss.\n\nToday - not my choice, I insisted on sushi but my husband wanted Tlaloc (we work together), the fajita plate was supposed to have corn and the salad advacado.  Shorted on both accounts. So they list all these things on the menu, charge you for them and then short you.  $11.75 for an average size salad mind you.  Has the obligatory 6 shrimp but all other ingredients we have at home - romaine, tomato, cucumber.  Not a great value.  BUYER BEWARE.  WATCH WHAT YOU PAY FOR AND MAKE SURE YOU GET IT.  I hate that kind of dishonesty.  Its condescending and sneaky. Don't be cheap, change the menu if you do not mean it.  If you are out of something, say so. I might not order it then.

However, there's slim picking for Mexican food, and you don't see to many suits always eating at Mexican food places. \n\nI went to Tlaloc today to meet a friend. Been wanting to try this place, and what better excuse to meet half way of where we both work than Tlaloc!! \n\nI was warned they had HOT salsa bar.....I love all hotness!! Wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be, but maybe my friend has a sensitive palate and didn't pick anything spicy. Good excuse to try again! \n\nHuge selection of amazing burritos, tacos, etc. There's low carb options as well. They claim they farm their own organic food. It definitely is as fresh as it comes. \n\nthere's plenty of seating, three levels worth as well as outdoor seating in front. The line moves quickly during lunch rush and service is amazing! Eat outside, enjoy the fresh air, and watch one of the workers \"shoo away\" the pigeons when people are done eating and walk away. \n\nToday I ordered a regular chicken burrito. My friend ordered their prawns burrito. My next visit I want to try their chorizo because its their own recipe....I LOVE ME SOME CHORIZO!!! \n\nIf you're looking for some good Mexican food that uses fresh ingredients, this is your place.

The first thing I noticed was the plethora of spelling errors on the menu (the menu literally spells every word wrong: Pallo Adabada Burrtio\").    Also had to wait about 15 minutes to get my burrito for takeout and it wasn't even that busy.  This is nearly inexcusable for a service business catering to a predominantly corporate audience.\n\nFood:\n\nThe best way to describe my burrito is: \"the sum-of-the-parts is much greater than the individual pieces\"  (like most burritos).  Norcal-people (I understand Socal burritos to be slightly different) like to jam tons of things in their burritos (guac, sour cream, etc), and because of this, subtle flavors tend to get lost quite easily.  I really enjoy good adobada (tacos el gordo :), but here it didn't taste any different to me than a standard pollo asado since all the other ingredients pretty much drowned out the flavor. If this was a $5 burrito place, it would be stellar, but I paid nearly $10 for a burrito and a small portion of chips.\n\nWould I come back?  Sure, the food is actually quite good, just nothing to write home about.  Next time I hope to try something a bit simpler to get an \"honest\" taste of the flavors, especially since FiDi has a lack of good mexican food.", "author": "Hannah C."}

The prices are a bit on the high side for a burrito and sometimes they run out of sangria.  It kinda sucks when you walk all the way there and they dont have sangria.\n\nOverall I highly recommend it.", "author": "Samantha S."}

Every now and then you find a special one, like the super authentic ones you find in San Diego, and I am sure are hidden in the Mission or somewhere (message me if you know of any!).  And this place.  It's greatness does not lie in a couple of handed-down-from-generations recipes, but rather in their execution of the standard Mexican fast food items.  They grow thier own vegetables -- who does that?  And they use the finest Bay Area meats, I believe Neiman Ranch.  Everything is crazy good.  And healthy.  And doesn't feel like a brick in your belly afterward.\n\nThe people are also really friendly.  As friendly as people can be with a line of customers out the door to serve.\n\nAlso, on the employees, the faces there NEVER change.  So either it is a family place with a huge family of people all around the same age, or the owners really take care of their employees.

I understand that, like me, everyone else thought today would be a great day for Mexican food - it's Cinco de Mayo!  And I figured they would be a little busy. But this was inexcusable.\n\nI faxed in my order for the office (9 items) and they called back relatively soon. I had asked for food to be ready 12:00p, but that was cutting it to close so they asked if 12:30 was ok. I agreed, and asked Cupid Courier to be there at such time. I got a call, not from the restaurant but from Sean to inform me the food would take an additional half hour.  So that puts us at 1p. 1:30p rolls around, I have hungry staff and I'm kinda over this whole celebration thing. Sean arrives food in hand - but asks if everything is there, seems kinda light. I go over the receipt and they have left off one item. Turns out, half the order was missing! \n\nNot wanting to burden Cupid with standing in for the angry customer I have now become, I hop in a cab to straighten this out. When I walk up to the register, I ask to speak to the manager. I watch as she brings my order to someone (I assume the manager, but who knows), they point to a bag sitting on the sidelines, and she starts double checking to see if the items I said were missing are in the bag. Turns out that the item not on the receipt was not being offered, so they replaced it with a burrito. Hmm, no phone call? Oh, right - no phone call that the food is going to be late, no phone call that half the order was not given to the courier, and no phone call that they replaced an item. Does anyone else see a pattern.\n\nI used to order from Tlaloc for company lunches. I used to eat there somewhat regularly. They have now lost a customer.

Great vegetarian choices too which was a plus. My main gripe was that NO prices were posted on the menu for some reason (just said AQ, or \"as quoted\"). What's up with that? It's not a seafood place! \n\nI ordered the grilled veggie burrito that consisted of a spinach tortilla, black beans, cheese, guacamole, salsa, rice, and chunks of veggies. It was one of the better burritos I've had...wasn't laden with cheese nor overstuffed. The components were spread out nicely so that I wasn't just eating beans or rice in a bite. The salsa was amazing too! It also came with a side of fresh tortilla chips that were perfectly crunchy.  Overall I thought the meal was delicious, filling, and healthy!\n\nI LOVED their wide selection (7-8) of salsas too but be warned...their \"mild\" was pretty spicy in my opinion. The flavors were pleasantly robust in the 2 that I sampled but I thoroughly enjoyed the mango salsa. Having salsa as toppings makes a world of a difference! They also delivered our plates of food to where we were seated and provided clean utensils.

It's a bustling kitchen area you see as you walk in with all sorts of meats, sea food, fish, and veggies being prepared to order.  Once you make a selection - and there is plenty to choose from here - you order.  I chose the Crispy Prawns Tacos (2) loaded.  Each taco is around $5, and you will need to order at least two for a meal.  They are worth the cost.  They fry the corn taco shell like I have never experienced before with a generous scope of prawns that were cooked to perfection.  Add in the sour cream, guacamole and salsa and these babies are good to go.  You can also chose from a wide variety of home made salsas, and when I say homemade - these look to be someone's secret recipes...everything from mild to XXHot - didn't get to that one, but the garlic mild has a nice kick to it.  I also tried the Guacamole salsa, which looked like a puree version - but very light and a nice contrast to the Garlic mild.  Each order comes with house made tortilla chips - these are great.  The fountain was down a couple of choices, but I made due with a nice root beer - free refills!  Seating is on several locations and the waiters do their best to find you either inside or outside as quickly as possible.  i don't envy these guys and gals that have to figure out where you picked to sit.

The food is a bit expensive compared to the average prices of regular Mexican food, but they care about their ingredients. So, to get the organic items or free range chicken, you have to pay the premium, but this stuff is probably way better for your body anyways. So, the price didn't phase me. \n\nI really wanted to get the carne asada super burrito, but I decided to try something new because I always get that every place I go. After discussing with the cashier, I decided to get a Pollo Adobado Burrito with a garlic tortilla. I usually don't get chicken too, but hey, I was trying something different, so might as well go for the whole nine yards. \n\nThe chicken was very moist, and it was marinaded in this red sauce which gave it a ton of flavor! The red sauce was a little spicy, but so delicious. The garlic tortilla was very flavorful as well. It complimented the burrito very well. I think my favorite part was the salsa bar! It was... AWESOME. So many different kinds!! There was a mango salsa, avocado salsa, pumpkin seed salsa, inferno salsa, and more. I tried the avocado salsa and a medium spicy salsa (I forgot the name). The medium spicy salsa was not my favorite. I didn't really like the smokey flavor, but to someone that likes that type of flavor, I bet they will love this salsa! The avocado one was so delish! It was kind of creamy, spicy, and had a kick of cilantro. That was my favorite out of the 2. I wanted to try each kind, but there was about 8 kinds, so I guess I will have to go back! The burrito also came with a side of chips which was nice. \n\nI am definitely a fan and will come back again.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-03-04", "description": "Hmmm . . . reviews like this one are the most challenging for me.  I am torn as there are many factors why Tlaloc deserves a bad or mediocre review.  As you read on, you will understand my point.  \n\nMy coworkers and I decided to go on a hunt for Mexican food for lunch since Pancho Villa closed on the Embarcadero.  What a sad day that was!  We had to look for a second option . . . therefore; my coworker did a search on Yelp and found Tlaloc.  \n\nWe entered Tlaloc and it immediately gave me a sense of a Tex-Mex type of restaurant.  Think Chevy's but nicer.  You order first and if you are going to be sitting in the restaurant to eat, they will give you a number.  Tlaloc has three floors for seating, which is GREAT!  You find a seat and place your number on your table so the waiter/waitresses can bring your food.  Tlaloc's salsa bar isn't anything to rave about.  Their selection of salsa was the standard unlike most Tex-Mex influenced restaurants.  There was no fancy corn salsa or roasted tomato salsa.  *boo*  The food was simple and you get what you order.  I ordered a super burrito with carne asada.  From a 1-10 scale, I would rate the burrito as a 5.  So far from my review, I bet you would expect me to rate Tlaloc a 1 or 2 star rating on Yelp.  Well, this is why I'm torn.  \n\nTlaloc receives a mediocre review because:\n1.  The service was fast (which is a huge factor during lunch hour in the FiDi*)\n2.  The workers were very kind\n3.  The restaurant was very clean\n4.  The ingredients were fresh\n5.  There isn't a good selection of Mexican restaurants in the area\n\nI would definitely choose Pancho Villa among other taquerias over Tlaloc, but since I'm on an \"island\" in the FiDi, I don't have much of a choice.  Hence, they will receive a 3 star rating as the \"lesser of two evils\" Mexican restaurant in the FiDi.  \n\n\n*Financial District", "author": "Manton R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-02-13", "description": "When I told my friend that I had lunch at Tlaloc yesterday, he gave me this puzzled look and asked \"Why?\"  You see, he loves Mexican food, and the company he works for (rhymes with Schmoracle) is located in the building right next to Tlaloc.  He said: \"if it were any good, I'd eat here three times a week.\"  He doesn't.\n\nAs soon as you walk in, you learn that Tlaloc food is \"natural\" and \"organic.\"  Yet, there's something unnatural and non-organic about its ordering process, prices, seating and service.  Let me elaborate.\n\nFirst of all, we came in right around noon, and the line was literally out the door.  We grabbed a menu and began studying it.  The menu offerings looked pretty typical for a Mexican restaurant, the prices were not.  The cheapest burrito on the menu was $7.95.  Ouch.\n\nThere were three cash registers open, but the line was still moving slow.  One of the cashiers was working from a spot behind a pillar, and people had a hard time locating him.  He had to yell \"next person in line!\" a couple of times to get someone's attention.  After 5-7 minutes in line, I ordered my chicken super burrito and a small Diet Coke.  I was charged $11.68, including $2 for a small fountain drink.  Again, ouch.\n\nThe cashier gave me an order number stand to put on my table, since at Tlaloc they bring your food out to you.  I heard that Tlaloc is known for its salsa bar, so I knew I had to try at least a couple of varieties.  I grabbed two small salsa cups, my soda in a paper cup and the number stand; it was time to find a seat.  Actually, there were three of us at lunch, and my friend had already grabbed a table, so it was time to find him.\n\nTlaloc has three tiny seating areas, each on its own level.  It looks like balconies in a theater or tiers at a stadium.  The only difference is, the Tlaloc tiers are only accessible by walking up a steep, narrow staircase with obscure signs while tripping over people along the way.  The tables on the balconies are scarce, and the space between the tables - virtually non-existent.  At lunch we were talking about what a fire hazard this place must be.  I wonder what the fire marshal would say about that . . .  By the way, you know what they have on each seating level?  A salsa bar!  Do you think they could have put up a sign saying \"tasty salsa available on each floor?\"  At the very least, we wouldn't have had to carry 37 things up the stairs, like a gypsy at a train station!\n\nAnyway, we sat down at a table and set our 3 number stands on the edge.  I got my chicken burrito first and one of my friends got his pork torta (sandwich) a minute later.  Our other friend, however, wasn't so lucky.  She had to wait at least 7 more minutes before someone finally showed up with her whole wheat, no rice burrito.  No apologies, nothing.  At least I made $1 at lunch: I bet one of my friends I'd get my food first.  Call it a hunch.\n\nMy burrito was very bland and tasteless.  I had to add a lot of salsa (which was very good, by the way) to make it marginally better.  The burrito was pretty small with just a little bit of chicken, rice and beans.  The tortilla was very thick and doughy.  NOT a good value.\n\nIn the city where good, inexpensive Mexican food is abundant, there is just no reason to go Tlaloc.  Its overpriced, mediocre food, coupled with confusing, frustrating customer experience, will not help them with repeat business.  I will not be back.\n\nP.S.  The second star is for their salsa only, and nothing else.", "author": "Yan G."}

In fact most people in Mexico assume you are talking about little donkeys, not the fast-food bastardization of their cuisine, when you ask where to find a good burrito.  Why does that American want a little donkey they wonder.  This is pondered until they come to the only logical solution - you are a pervert.\n\nThat being said, why is every review about Mexican food a discussion of burritos?  Yes Tlaloc (and Cancun in Berkeley) serves a pricey donkey, and probably not the best one at that.  So what?  \n\nWhat Tlaloc does have is a very nice daily special,  usually featuring a regional or specialty fare that you don't get at Taco Hell or from a truck in a parking lot.  They have delicious Aguas Frescas: I go for the Horchata and Strawberry offerings.  They have a fresh salsa bar too. \n\nI love Tlaloc; I go all the time.  The specials range from Sopes (my favorite), to Birria (so good), to specialty tacos and much, much more.  I've never regretted ordering a special.  \n\nIf you want a burrito, go to a burrito shop.

I've only ever had the vegetarian super burrito there and I like it a lot.  Some of the other reviewers have complained about portion size and it's absolutely true that you're gonna be paying more than you would for a mission burrito for a lot less food but ask yourself whether you really need a fifteen hundred calorie burrito for lunch when you've been sitting behind a desk all day.

I've tried the various Mole burritos, and I just don't think they're that good.  I'd rather go to Chipotle, or something half the price in the Mission.  The salsa bar provides interesting options (beyond mild/medium/hot, they have an avocado salsa, a cucumber salsa, etc), but I don't give extra stars for condiments, when the main meal is vastly overrated.\n\nThis quality of the food probably deserves three starts, but I'm subtracting a point for a) price, and more  than that, the indescribably annoying \"A.Q.\" that resides to the right of every item on the menu.  What does this stand for?  \"Ask Question?\"  \"As Quoted?\"  Are prices being adjusted based on the current market value of the tortilla?  This discourages me from trying anything new on the menu, for fear that the going rate might be $23 for a Shrimp Mole Burrito.\n\nMixt Greens is in the same alley, and clearly displays a set price, no matter the seasonality or wholesale price on Arugula.", "author": "Joe K."}

It is always packed at lunchtime, but the service is really quick and I can always find a seat inside. I'm not a burrito guy, so I usually get the daily special, which could be chicken enchiladas with molle sauce, tamales, sopas, or some other dish. Always good. The tamales are best, and I wish they had them more often. So tasty! When the special doesn't rock my boat, I go for the carnitas plate. Some of the best I've ever had.\n\nCan be a little pricy for the special, and I expect the burritos are a lot less. Special is usually 12 bucks. Add a drink and you're up to 15. A bit much for lunch, but OK for a once a week treat.\n\nThe cashiers are super cute.\n\nOne suggestion, and I've heard other people complain about them too: Cut off the little tabs on the top of the chairs. They are covered with rubber (presumably to keep people from impaling themselves) and if you brush up against them they catch on your clothes. In the tight quarters it means you are constantly bumping into them. If no one is sitting in the chair you tend to drag the chair in the direction you are walking. If someone is sitting in the chair you'll get a dirty look. REALLY annoying. Get some guy with a grinder to cut them off and smooth off the edges. Everyone will be happier!", "author": "Luke E."}

Almost half the price of the nachos but definitely filling enough and none of the extra stuff I don't even want.

Having not been for awhile, I was about to open my mouth and suggest E&O, when he opened his mouth first and suggested we try this taqueria he had mentioned before.  Taqueria?!?  I am not planning to take a long lunch and Bart into the city for tacos!  That thought and the long trek from the Bart station was enough for me to dislike the place even before arriving.\n\nWhen we did get there, we saw that the line to order was already out the door.  That was enough time for me to check out the large menu on the wall.  We ordered the tostada costena, mole burrito with prawns, and a horchata.  OMG, that was the yummiest seafood salad (with a tostada buried beneath it)!  The mole burrito was good too, I am not much of a burrito fan, but this one was nice and tasty.\n\nOne thing we found interesting was that the lady who took our order at the counter also ended up bringing our food to us.  Why?  I haven't a clue, but I wish she had just stayed behind the counter taking orders, because she ended up dropping the basket of chips on my lap.  She said she would bring us another, but as soon as she disappeared down the stairs, we pretty much knew we would not see her again.  My hubby flagged down another server and asked for chips.  He brought us back this tiny little basket.  Too bad, because the salsas were really good.\n\nThis place is pricier than your average taqueria.  Each of our dishes were $10.  But as we got up to leave, and I brushed chip crumbs off my lap, I had to admit it was well worth the trek.", "author": "Angela O."}

Seriously, if my face is not melting by the time i'm done eating, you have not done your job. Thanks to their xxhot salsas, I can say \"mission accomplished.\n-they are right outside my door. It's a 35 second walk from my office to Tlaloc. Can't really beat the convenience. \n\nNow, I have to hate a little:\n-Tried the crispy tacos today and, while yummy, they were so messy and greasy, there is no way to eat them without knife and forking it. Also the taco shells tasted really stale. \n-But the #1 kicker for me is always the price. I mean, really. $12 for 2 tacos? Surely, you jest. This is mexican food. the whole appeal is that  cheap cuts of meat + cheap beans + cheap rice = cheap food. I realize we're paying a premium for ORGANIC cheap meat and beans and rice, but still.

One, they don't have the prices up on the menu board and sure that is some type of volition, or maybe not but still annoying.  Two, the tortillas they use are only steamed and not grilled or put on a fire, that is more like what taco bell would do.  Three, the salsa cups seem to always be gone and have to wait and ask for more or use plastic cups.  The worse part is that I got a very bad upset stomach from this place a few times.  Not sure if it's the salsa or what three time knows.  I was not sure if it was this place but now I'm sure.  I usually get the carne asada burrito and different salsas.  Past three times I've been there, I've gotten an upset stomach.  Thus, I'm not going here as I think it's the salsa and I'd need to use it on other food I'd eat there.\nThe good part was before I was getting these issues, I'd enjoy the food, minus the steamed tortilla, as well as the good price for the mean.

I was so shocked at how inexpensive it was, but after tasting it, we understood why.  Tons of juice, and not much alcohol, but we really enjoyed the fresh bits of strawberry and watermelon.  Although no lunchtime buzz, it did leave me with a very full bladder!  Overall, despite slightly higher-priced Mexican food, I would undoubtedly come back for the carnitas quesadilla and delicious salsa bar, and if the weather gets warmer again, you'll definitely find me enjoying a nice lunch outside Tlaloc.\n\nFunny story: While picking up my pitcher of sangria, the nice lady asks me, \"How many cups? Three? Four?\" and I sheepishly say, \"No, just two\" and her eyes bug out and she exclaims, \"Two?!?! Haha, okay.  I'll give two big cups.\"  Then she proceeds to hand me two chilled beer pint glasses from the refrigerator, instead of the typical dainty glasses they give customers for sangria.  Yeah, I'm not ashamed to say I like to drink during working hours!", "author": "Diane L."}

I've been there 3 times so far and have been impressed by only one thing; their salsa's. Their salsa's kick ass---seriously exceptional. But a super carne asada burrito will cost you $9 plus tip and it'll be small and my personal pet peeve, cold. Why are the vast majority of burritos lukewarm at best? If you order cream in your burrito, forget it, you'll have to hold it with mitts. If you're in the FiDi go to Orale Orale. It'll cost you the same but the meat will be more tasty and the burrito will be the size of a baby---not the size of a baby's forearm.", "author": "Mario T."}

They've got lots of mild salsas for the gringos as well as some spicy ones.  The cucumber salsa is amazing, but is too spicy for my friends. Too bad for them.  SALSA TIP: Mix the hottest salsa with mild salsas to give them a kick.\n\nThe burritos are very good, although on the small size for a San Francisco super burrito.  The meat is very fresh and juicy.  The beans and other toppings are standard, while the rice is below par.  Still, when it comes together, it's delicious, especially with their ridiculous salsa bar.\n\nChips are included. They are freshly made.  Sweet.\n\nThis place is three stories tall and they deliver the burritos to your table.  I love this part of the place too because you can relax at your table while waiting for your burrito instead of nervously standing in the place.   It's probably San Francisco's only multi-level salsa bar, although the one on the first floor usually has more variety of salsa.\n\nThe only cons about this place are 1) price and 2) hours.  Burritos are financial district prices, which means it will run you $10 for a burrito and soda.  The hours are NOT until 3:00 a.m., that is just plain wrong.  This place isn't even open for dinner; I think they might close at 3 pm.

I've changed jobs and am no longer within walking distance of Tlaloc......probably a good thing for my waistline!", "author": "Karen S."}

There we people running to shelter, or so it seemed...but reallly they were running to get a delicious meal from this place. The frist time I went here I was overwhelmed with all the choices. Their huge menu board is cool, but i opted for the paper menu so that i could make my decision carefully, not over looking anything. I got the carne asada quesadilla. It was awesome! melted cheese on a flour tortilla(you have a choice either corn or flour, the friendly cashier recommended the flour for its size) rolled up almost like a taquito with lots of yummy toppings mounted above it. This was not only warm and soft but great with their homemade chips. I actually loved the chips so much that next time i got the nachos and boy was i in heaven. They give you just enough for a filling lunch and the carne asada is always fresh and never over cooked. This place is starting to become one of my all time faves. The only reason I gave it a four was that I think the prices could be a little cheaper...on that note...load up on the garlic salsa! its unique and addicting!!", "author": "Rhea A."}
