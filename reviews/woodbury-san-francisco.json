After reading the reviews, I decided to come here and was not impressed. The drinks are very expensive, and not very good quality. I asked for a Long Island, but it tasted like straight mixer and was dark brown. Long islands do not look like that. If you are gonna charge me so much money drink with little to no alcohol then it's not worth it. SF always has high prices, but the quality should be there. \nI asked for my fried chicken sliders to be plain without anything on it because I am allergic to some of the ingredients. The first time it was brought out it was exactly how the menu stated so I asked again for them to make it. For a second time they brought out the same thing. I was only charged for one, which is okay I guess, but I was unable to eat the food. Also it took forever to bring out the food, even though the bar wasn't even half full. I didn't eat it instead I just paid and left. The food may be good or not, I don't know because they repeatedly got my order wrong so I couldn't eat it. We then went to a different bar across from the stadium with cheaper and higher quality drinks. Because of the terrible service we received here and needing to go somewhere else, we missed the beginning of the game and was still starving.", "author": "Raphael K."}

Drinks were delicious and food was not too bad. The tots, tacos and Brussels sprouts stood out! But the ribs, chicken sliders were both dry.  However given what you're paying, you would think that they could serve the food on real plates rather than disposable plates/paper containers.  I understand that it's \"bar food\" but for $8-15 per item I would expect real plates. Also it took 30 minutes for the food to come out (!!!) and we had to ask our server 3 times for water.

Definitely didn't taste strong but half way through I was feeling it.\n\nCHICKEN WINGS ($10) - house dry rub with ranch dipping sauce. I noticed everybody getting the saucy wings but I'm not into saucy kind of wings. I initially asked for the hot wings with sauce on the side but they gave me the house dry rub. The dry rub was good but a bit too peppery and salty to my liking. I had to dip the wings in a lot of ranch to lessen the seasoning flavor. There were 8 pieces per order so it is definitely worth your dollar.\n\nBACON POPCORN ($3) - Topped with Korean Chili Flakes. I live anything bacon and to have bacon flavor on my favorite snack was a bigger positive. It basically was popcorn with some kind of bacon butter grease drizzled on the popcorn and a few sprinkles of chili flakes on top for heat - which I didn't really feel.

The lighting were dim with lights hanging around the place. \n\nYou had the option to sit at the booths or the tables which were pretty high up. They had two bars which one was for the beer& shots and the other as the main bar. \n \nI found the menu interesting with their choices of drinks paired with shots. If you were in that kind of mood to start of your night with one mixed drink or beer with a shot. \nI decided to order myself beer which I can't recall the name. But all I could assure are good. \nThe presentation of the drinks were unique, the beers and mixed drinks my other friends order came out in mason jars, giving that urban vibe.\n\nWhat I found it unique about this place was that they had an area to play video games and not just your regular ones. The old fashion games you would find if you were born late 80's and early 90's\n\nFood were finger food which are great for something light and just enjoying your drinks. My friends orders the sliders and the tator tots that just looked and tasted delicious. \n\nOverall I would definitely come back. The vibe, service, food and drinks were great.", "author": "Jacqueline T."}

Although Woodbury can get quite loud and busy, I haven't noticed any difficulty finding bar (standing) space or a table or two to claim for groups. The drinks (cocktails!) are good, and the staff are friendly - and helpful, if you're not really sure what to order. And did I mention the games? Nostalgia alert, if you were ever a fan of Super Nintendo ;) It's has a casual, cool vibe that's great for post-work happy hours, hanging out with friends, girls nights, you name it!

The chili didn't have beans which was great for me since I hate beans. And the cheese was ooey, gooey and comforting! The rest of the dishes were okay. I didn't care for the poutine though.

Located a few blocks from AT&T park, this place is perfect for an after game celebration or a chill night with some good drinks and food.  \n\nAmbiance:  The bar itself has a really awesome look and feel to it with lots of hardwood furniture, walls, flooring and two decently sized bars to order from.  Spacing is very generous since most of the tables are along the walls allowing for more standing room in the middle.  They have old-school game consoles next to  one of the bars so you can play games like Super Mario while having a drink which is awesome.  I loved Super Mario as a kid so this just takes me back and gives bonus points for Woodbury.  \n\nFood & Drinks:  Their menu has your typical gastropub choices and a great selection of drinks for everyone.  We ordered the loaded tater tots, beef sliders, a few dark and stormy's and a Dogfish IPA to wash the food down.  Our food and drinks came out super quick which was nice because its never fun to wait too long for your drinks at a bar.  The tater tots were absolute heaven with melted cheese, bacon and green onions.  The beef sliders were cooked perfectly, served with a sweet onion jam and crispy bacon.  The dark and stormy was made very well and you can never go wrong with a solid IPA.  Overall I really enjoyed my meal here and will definitely be back for more food and drinks.\n\nService:  Service here was nice and quick with our orders/requests.

It is much better use of space with ample booths, standing tables and seating along both bars. The decor makes it feel very rustic/hipsterish...stuffed animal heads hanging on the walls, unicycle looking chairs at the bar and to my surprise, the coolest thing I've probably seen in any bar was an original Ninetendo game console with Street Fighter playing. Whaaat?! I'm sure the rest of you 90s babies would go crazy for this as well.\n\nMy coworkers originally were supposed to go the The Alchemist bar next door but since they weren't open yet, we decided to grab a drink here and check it out.

It's gross\n\n-snap your fingers, make loud noises or raise your hand.  They see you and because they're not making vodka redbulls and making cocktails that take a freakin' minute it's a good time to practice patience and level up a bit.\n\n-close the door without permission.  I'm talking to you Sk L, would you lower the volume of a music venue if it were too loud for you?  Would you go to someone's office and lower the brightness of their computer monitor because it was too bright?  There's somethings for which it's okay to do when you're at home or your own place of work but you'll be surprised by how many business owners prefer to keep the door open, because it shouts to the world, 'WE'RE OPEN!'.  Bring some layers, SF gets cold.\n\n-get caught up in 1st world problems.  So what if Kanye was on Pandora.  Bartenders' hands are wet and they can't run to change the station every time Pandora's algorithms start fucking up and playing Kanye.  \n\n-complain about not tasting the alcohol.  Here's the thing about a well-balanced cocktail....lean on in.....closer....clooooooser.  Ok, a well made cocktail blends ingredients so well that it doesn't have to taste like a Long Island Iced Tea.  That's the whole point of a craft cocktail... \n\nWith that said, remember that it's important that you DO:\n\n- Have a good time\n- make some new friends\n- crack a few jokes\n- try something new\n- learn the bartender's name(s)\n- tip your bartender.

The girl behind the bar (I'm assuming she's a regular bartender there because I've seen her before) took our order for food and drinks. \n\nI ordered a Ketel Greyhound while my friend ordered a Ketel Soda. Basic stuff. Not going to lie but the drinks weren't strong at all and you can barely taste the alcohol. \n\nWhen the food came, I asked for hot sauce or something spicy to go with my Fried Chicken Burger. Reason for the 2 stars are for the FOOD by the way! Anyways, asked her for extra Sriracha and napkins with some sort of utensils (which should be given if you order food at any given restaurant I would think) and she made this face as if we're bothering her. We had to flag her down once again because we wanted another drink and even though I swear she saw us waving (it's a Monday for God's sake, it's not that busy and the bar is NOT that big or long), she kept talking to a guy down the bar.

Some people may not think that's important but maybe because I work in the serving industry, you SHOULD ALWAYS make sure they get the itemized receipt so people can make sure they know what they are getting charged for! \n\nSorry if I may sound like a [beep] for writing this but I hardly ever writes Yelp review unless the place is extremely bad and in need of a reality check or it's excellent beyond expectation.

I have rarely experienced that kind of outright rudeness, apathy and just plain indifference... it was as bad as a United Airlines flight. I have loved Alchemist for some time as do many of my friends. In fact, many of my startup clients and students are in your area and host Happy Hours and events at your place. I will not be recommending this to them moving forward. \n\nI went to close the door because it was freezing and the wind was blowing. The rude brunette bartender (Saturday night shift) walked right past me, went right to the door and opened it back up... no explanation, no communication, and even an annoyed rolling of the eyes. WOW, are we 12 years old and do we even understand BASIC CUSTOMER SERVICE? Seriously? \n\nSo, I walked up to ask for the water that we requested and had not yet arrived. I politely asked why we couldn't close it because it was cold... logical question. At first she just ignored me as if I was annoying her and she didn't have the time to address me... but the bar was not that busy. I asked again. \"We just do. Owners rules.\" A TON of attitude and again another opportunity to just politely address the issue. \n\nIt would have been perfectly fine if she had said, \"Oh, it's just our rules, but if you'd like to move to a back table, I can help you do that.\" I GET THAT! No problem at all! I would have been happy to do that! Instead, her friends at the bar (who were getting free drinks) started yelling at me that I was \"givin' attitude\" and even had the classiness to flip me off and go and open the second door... for what reason I still don't comprehend. CHILDISH, RUDE, CLASSLESS. Of course, the bartender did nothing to communicate to her buddies at the bar that this kind of behavior is reserved for middle school and NOT a cool bar in the in SOMA.\n\nI was shocked and incredibly disappointed and request that you please address this issue.

The atmosphere is super nice -\u00a0a bit dark, with dark wood everywhere -\u00a0just looks really nice. One look at the menu and again, awesome - they have beer and shots in one drink, or pair them up based on what goes well together. And then, I saw the video games! Who doesn't love a place that has Mario Kart on Super NES at a bar? Sounds great, right? \n\nWell, I've now had two service-oriented issues that took my 5-star rating down to 2 -\u00a0a shame.\n\nLong story short, the first time I was there, my friends and I were ready to pay up, but were told that the POS is down and they can't take credit cards. I get it, that happens... but to wait until we're done and then tell us is super inconvenient. I told this to the bartender (instead of just running home to post it on Yelp), but he could have cared less.\n\nThen... this weekend... I went back. Arrived at 6:45 and the door was locked (which was odd since we were there at the exact same time the week before -\u00a0and, Yelp showed the opening time as 6:30). A couple of seconds later, an employee opened the door and let us in, saying they just opened. Great! Well, we sat down at the bar, and the bartender refused to serve us until 7 -\u00a0he made the comment that they're closed and just ignored us until 7:01. A couple of other people walked in and didn't know what to do. They asked if they could at least sit down he was ready, and he just kind of shrugged and said \"I guess, but I'm not serving anyone until 7\". Sure enough, we sat there and watched him peel oranges and stock fridges. Then at 7:01, he asked us what he can get for us -\u00a0almost as if we just walked in the door. It was odd, and was very poor service. I get it -\u00a0you don't open until 7 -\u00a0well adjust your hours online, and at the very least, tell your doorman not to let people in the bar.\n\nHopefully this can be addressed.

The guy before me yacked everywhere in the restroom. Unfortunately the bouncer happened to walk in one person late and blamed me for the mess. I denied the incident and he proceeded to escalate and kicked me out. How about instead of worrying about throwing people out who just spent an arm and a leg on your disgusting drinks, you worry about cleaning up your restrooms? Wasn't going to continue to argue so my group of friends left. If I'm going to yack, Id own it.

After leaving the Giants game, we stumbled upon this place and hoped it would fulfill our wish for creative cocktails and a cool vibe. Woodbury was exactly what we hoped it would be. \n\nI always call myself a \"beer and wine kinda girl,\" not because I don't like cocktails, but because I'm so damn picky about them. I don't like sweet. I don't like sour. I don't like the taste of vodka. A sour apple martini basically makes me want to puke. This is pretty much what I told the bartender, Kinson. (See, my experience was so good, I made sure to get his name before we left, knowing I had to write a review when I got home.)\n\nAnyway, Kinson whipped me up something that was the perfect balance of fresh and spicy. I can't exactly remember what it was, but I know it had basil in it. A lot of drinks followed, each one more inventive than the last. Each person in my group had at least 2 or 3 drinks, and our bill was half of what we expected it to be. We walked out feeling like we hit the jackpot of all bars. Too bad I live in So Cal and won't be going back any time soon, but I definitely recommend it if you're in the area.", "author": "Shay C."}

It has a rustic-like, open wood, dark saloon kind of theme, but classy; a shabby chic. The bar area was very nice with stools for each patron, but it was really the Nintendo NES and the Atari that caught the eye of my friends and I. Next to the bar they offer both of these systems and wall mounted TVs free to play. A few beers and some video games took us right back to our childhood and sparked some fun competition in Mario Cart.\n\nUnfortunately, despite the great atmosphere, the great beer and drink selection, I have to deduct a star because of one incident. After my friend and I continuing to order drinks without providing a card or opening a tab, our other friend shows up and hands the bartender his card; all seems normal. It wasn't until about 15 minutes later, when we wanted to close out, that we're told that the card processing system is down and we need cash. The bartender admitted to knowing this since the 45 minutes we have been there. To resolve the issue, we each had to go to the adjacent building and use the ATM. While not a huge inconvenience, it could have been mentioned much sooner and avoided altogether.\n\nI will still recommend Woodbury to friends and family in the area based on everything that is great about the place.", "author": "Stephen B."}

My sister beat us there by almost an hour, and said the place was awesome when we arrived.  We were greeted by a nice enough bartender.  I saw Dogfish head 90 minute IPA and excitedly ordered.  Small mason jar, but hey, it's strong beer.  Mom didn't know what she wanted. \n\n Asked bartender for Mexican coffee... He checked, they don't have coffee.  Ok fine.  Mom looked behind the bar at the \"just the classics\" liquor, and asked what kind of martinis he could make her.  Bartender said \"well, it can have gin, or vodka, and vermouth...\", not understanding.  I ordered her a cosmo.  He made a damn good one.  Mom asked \"so what's the happy hour price for this?\". Bartender says it's not part of happy hour.  I pointed out that we ordered a well cosmo, and well drinks are discounted.  Female bartender stepped in, easily  and confidently saying it's $2 off.  Fine, cool, whatever.  Maybe he's new...  \n\nMom ordered mushroom sandwich, she said it was tasty. Her salt and peppered fries were awesome.  Sister and I ordered loaded poutine.  Mushroom gravy was overseasoned with a mystery ingredient, but overall yummy.  I had a full conversation with male bartender about my desire for jalapenos, and after confirming he had some, they never came.   Sister also ordered the bratwurst sausage, which she was looking forward to, but never came.  Isok, half order of poutine was enough food after all.  Food was good, little overpriced for what we got, and no happy hour food specials like we had hoped for.  \n\nSister and I agreed to go back a little later next time, as it started to fill up as we were leaving, and just drink beer, eat fries, and be open to the scene.", "author": "Katie H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-09-10", "description": "Casey U. muses on the formula to make a new bar in San Francisco sucessful:\n\nA new, popular bar should focus on fancy-ass liquor, and pour beer for a dollar or two more than anywhere else. It should have black butte porter for seven dollars, and P.B.R. for four bucks, and bad wine, but it should be alright because they're served in mason jars. It should have poutine on the menu, and tater tots, and a burger for over 15 dollars. The poutine should be mediocre, with sad wilted fries, sad, flavorless gravy, and an artesinal cheese which does not resemble the classic curd in any way, shape, or form (which is a travesty guaranteed to offend any self-respecting Montrealer). The bar should have a SNES in the corner with Mario Kart and Super Mario Brothers for children of the nineties with too much disposable income to get their daily bath of nostalgia while indulging in their long-repressed competitive impulses. A hip bar should have meats with a pedigree, and menus printed on high-quality paper that looks like its been through a war.\n\nWalking in to this hypothetical bar, you should feel unworthy if you make less than 75k a year. The clientele should range from 21-35 (in this town, if you're any older, you're finished), and everyone should have full heads of hair. There should be conspicuous displays of taxidermy (which means the bar is edgy), and strange chairs, possibly in the shape of unicycles (which means the bar is unique), and bartenders in ball-caps (which means that the bar is cool). It should be a place in a formerly bad part of town where you feel great taking profile pictures, and using your new selfie-pole (which I just found out is not a euphemism for a beef bayonet...if you know what I mean), and Instagramming your night for the world to see. It is a place of style, rather then substance.\n\nWell, hello Woodbury. It seems I've accidentally described you, right down to the tragic Poutine.

My guy had the basic cheese burger and it was tasty - the fries - of which I stole TWO were good - crispy but not skinny. I was a fan.  Our friend had the spicy brat which she said was delicious too. We also had beer and cocktails - I love a Paloma (tequila and grapefruit) - Everything was good and fresh - some reviews say it's pricy, but it seems pretty normal for SF to me.

Really good cocktails, you can also get a beer and a shot with top shelf alcohol for $10. They also have super Mario on big screens in the back. The bar stools also have peddles - my one complaint is that they don't move so I can't work out while I'm boozing.", "author": "Ayele A."}

It just goes to show you the difference between posers and professionals.\n\nFood still needs refinement.  But it's only their 2nd day.\n\nAtmosphere....simple and inviting. \n\nStaff....still needs to pay more attention.  But, again, it's only their 2nd day. \n\nWay better than 3rd Street Bar and Grill....and you don't have to deal with a grumpy old waitress/owner with an ego.\n\nMy favorite appetizers are the beer and shots!\n\nThis place is your local hangout just to meet, eat and have fun!", "author": "Karma Is Coming 4 U."}

The staff, from the servers to the bartenders are very friendly and made me and my friends feel right at home.  The cocktails were amazing and the vibe is very exciting yet laid-back.  I was impressed with the service and also with the food, which is something I am very picky about ordering from a bar type facility. \n\nA nice touch was also the moose on the walls however I am Canadian.  I will be back next time I am in the city!", "author": "Lisa C."}
