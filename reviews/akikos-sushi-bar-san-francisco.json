{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-06-25", "description": "The food we had here was nothing to complain or rave about. The service was great. The seating arrangement was very cramped.  The sushi and donburi were tasty and had no problems, but there seems to be a mismatch between the food and price. I think for the price the sushi should be a bit more amazing or at least bigger portions than this. Practically every roll comes with avocado, too, which to me is a indication of average, not higher end, sushi. \n\n$65 for two to have a very light meal seems to be a bit high, but perhaps this is due to the exorbitant price the restaurant probably pays for rent.", "author": "Maya G."}

Huge disappointment! \n\nFirst of all, when I went in to pick up the food both of the employees (chef and waitress) were speaking Chinese. This is not a Japanese-run restaurant, it's Chinese-run. (Full disclaimer: I lived in China for over a year, speak Chinese and my wife is Chinese-American. I love both Chinese and Japanese food, but the two cuisines are very different.) Not an auspicious sign. \n\nThen when I got home (2-block walk) and we tried to eat the food it was almost inedible. The Donburi was cold (not even tepid!) so we had to microwave it, and the rice, eel and 'salad' (apparently Safeway mixed greens) were kind of jumbled together in a non-leak-proof cardboard container. The portions were tiny - a dollop of rice and 7 or 8  small slices of eel. (Yeah, I know - \"The food was terrible... and the portions were so small!\") \n\nThe combination roll was also inedible - one of the worst rolls I've ever had. The only thing that was edible was the sunomono, which is pretty hard to get wrong. \n\nAll in all, very disappointing. We forced it down because we were hungry, and I hope we don't pay for it in the night. If you want good Japanese food then go somewhere else.", "author": "David S."}

We ordered the Cherry Blossom Roll, Scallop Special Roll, a handful of nigiri, and a few basic rolls. They were okay... Nothing memorable. The rolls aren't lux or unique here, but good for a sushi fix. Decent presentation of maki and nigiri. \n\nNot bad for an average lunch in the city.

The women who was working was very accommodating for our group of seven people in a very small place. She pushed tables together and even gave us complementary edamame. She provided us with good recommendations and was very helpful to my mom who had a gluten allergy to alter any of the rolls for her. \n\nWe ordered a few of the specialty rolls. They were very tasty but not a bang for your buck. The sushi was pretty expensive and the rolls were very small.

My mom ordered a miso soup to warm up and didn't receive it until 30 minutes later, longer than tables that came after us. The sushi took 30+ minutes (for something as simple as a cucumber roll) and everyone around us was served mush faster for things that took longer to cook (they came after us). The food was HORRIBLE and the service was WORSE. The restaurant was TINY! Beware that there is a huge chance they won't have space for you and if they do you will be UNCOMFORTABLE.\n\nAdditionally, the food is a joke! For example, a spicy tuna roll is a raw piece of tuna with a little spicy mayo, avocado, and cucumber. While I understand hat restaurants make tuna dishes differently, in all my life I have always had this particular dish with the tuna and spicy mayo mixed together. Moreover, the sushi in its own standing failed. The chef did not put any spicy mayo even though it's a vital part of the recipe. \n\nOur total for everything was $150 for food that was not filling, took an extremely long time and tasted less than average. Additionally, the waitress (who gave us terrible service) added her own tip to our total. \n\nTo summarize: the space is tiny and cramped; the food will take too long, be in small portions, taste underwhelming and bad, and is overpriced; the service is the worst I've ever had and probably the worst you'll have too. \n\nBeware, I would never go back again-not even if I was paid a million dollars!", "author": "Megan H."}

There aren't that many places in San Francisco where you can consistently get good sashimi - and Akiko's on Mason (no relation with the place with the same name on Bush) is easily on top of that list.

And it most definitely is quite small, three or four tables and a bar. We walked in early without reservations and were sat at the bar.\n\nThere was just one dude rolling everything right in front of us and he was really cool to watch. Just him making sure he chose the right piece of fish to cut from each time was  so engaging it was almost hard to think about anything else. There was a kitchen in the back where the soups and other dishes were being prepared.\n\nMa girl got the udon noodles, which I thought were really awesome. She later informed me that udon noodles are actually hard to screw up. But I personally don't think that had much to do with how good those noods were. We shared that bowl and had like 6 rolls otherwise. I don't think I've ever had a spicy tuna or salmon roll made as intricately as this. The chef made the simple taste truly fantastic. Couple in the high quality of fish they were serving, and it was lights out.\n\nOther notable things from this venture were the lack of table space, and the intricacy of their wasabi delivery. When we were in there literally every seat was taken and the space became quite cramped. As homegirl and I definitely don't take our orders lightly. We easily knock out like 6-8 rolls each time we grab sushi. So we couldn't support all of our rolls with the table space available, we had to consolidate different rolls onto one plate, probably wouldn't have been a deal if we made reservations and just got a normal table. Also the wasabi came out with a special little leaf design on it and as simple as that was NO other sushi spot I've been to regardless of price has done this. I love when places pay special attention to little details like this, makes them all the more memorable.", "author": "Jim B."}

If I could give them something lower than one star, I would.\n\nI went here with my sister and friend. Let me start out by saying that the three of us have eaten at numerous sushi bars/restaurants, from low grade but fresh, to air flown directlyfrom Japan. This is not my first rodeo. \n\nOne of my sushi pieces today had a bone in it. I pointed it out to the waitress, and showed her the bone. After she told the chefs, the chefs proceeded to talk about how surprised we were to find bones in our fish - in Cantonese. \"They ordered fish, and were surprised to find bones?\" What the chefs didn't know was that I actually speak Cantonese, and understood everything they said. Anyone with a 1st grade education could tell you that fish have bones. I can also tell you that it's a chef's job to prep the fish, which includes deboning the fish, especially if the fish is meant for sushi/sashimi purposes. Note: at no point did they offer to replace the piece of sushi with the bone. (My sister later commented to the chefs that we understood them, and they just stood there staring blankly at her, speechless.) \n\nNext, another piece of my sushi had a sand-y solid piece of \"rock\" (unknown actual substance) inside the rice. It was so hard my tooth nearly chipped as I bit down, and I had to spit out that piece. Even after spitting out the piece, I had small sand-y pieces of that unknown substance left in my mouth that I had to wash down with soup. \n\nCome here at your own peril. Be prepared to debone your own sushi, check the rice you are about to bite into, and be prepared to have the chefs talk about you while you are still in the restaurant.", "author": "Sharon K."}

The staff is Chinese, not Japanese.  They were speaking Cantonese to each other.  Must have bought it from the prior Japanese owners.\n\nI just had a unagi donburi and a large bottle of Saporro.  The beer was freshly bottled and cold; can't say that each time I've had it.  The donburi came w/miso & a salad.  Oddly, the unagi was placed on the salad on top of the rice.  There were also some edamame and chopped cucumber included w/the salad.  The unagi tasted ok but seemed a bit undercooked - not raw - to me because it did not seem as firm as I am used to having it served to me.\n\nThe bathroom is located in the basement to the apt bldg in which the sushi bar is s located.  You have to access it thru the apt lobby down a narrow stairway.  It's located across from the coin op laundry under the stairway.  THAT's very Chinese.\n\nShould also note that the prices are about 50-60% higher than indicated in the Yelp online menu. The donburi cost me $15 when it's lusted online. for $10 but they do take credit cards.\n\nCan't say whether the Chinese staff affects the authenticity of the food negatively but if you're looking for an out of the way, less touristy place to eat something Japanese while downtown, Akika's may be the place 4 you.", "author": "Martin C."}

It's fairly small, seating maybe 30 people at tables and maybe 10 at the Sushi bar. We waited about 5 minutes while they set us up a table. It took another 5 minutes for a server to come over to us. \n\nThere were a handful of rolls, Nigiri, Sashimi and a few other things to choose from. They were out of Unagi, which we usually get. We ended up getting a Spicy Tuna Roll, a Salmon Roll, Salmon Nigiri, another kinf of Eel Nigiri and Hamachi Kama. \n\nOverall it was decent sushi but in our opinions not worth what we paid, especially considering they tried to put their own spin on rolls or sauces. It took a long time to get our food and we always have a few go to rolls and pieces we like, and they didn't have any of them.\n\nI'd recommend this place to try if you're open to a limited menu and don't mind spending a little more for the experience and not mind blowing sushi.", "author": "Vina T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-07-10", "description": "After hanging out with LA Yelpers Jenny B, Valerie C and Anthony N in North Beach, I stumbled upon this little sushi joint located on the edge of Union Square. From the outside looking in, the fresh wasabi-colored interior was put together with four tiny tables, a sushi bar, and quite a few attractive diners. I took interest in this place after noticing their window menu that included a 10-piece sushi combination for $11.50. Interestingly this place has a female sushi chef and her presence caught me off guard for not being critically reflective enough about the extent of gender disparities in the restaurant business up to this point.\n\nThey didn't have a restroom on premise so instead the server handed me a wet napkin that she prepared over the sink so I could clean my hands. My sushi combination came with hamachi, ebi, sake, two types of tuna and butterfish. It also came with four pieces spicy tuna roll which were buttery with crisp cucumber and green onions wrapped around the tight sushi rice and bright orange tobiko. All the nigiri were decent and fresh with the butterfish really stood out. Without knowing the amount of spicy tuna was already included in the order, I got another Spicy Tuna Temaki ($3.50) which was redundant but the Spicy Unagi Fresh Salmon Temaki ($4) was gigantic and a mouthful of buttery sweetness. The side dish of pickled cabbage was decent.\n\nService was quick but distanced without a whole lot communication about the division between nigiri and rolls in the sushi combination and the types of fish the chef was going to include. Added to the ambiguity was also a sense of inconvenience without having access to a restroom on the premise. I thought the quality of their nigiri was not ultra fresh 5 stars, but each piece ranged from decent to good. With a 3.3 stars final rating, here's how they fared in each of the categories that are important to my sushi meals:\n\n1.) Quality and freshness: 3.5 stars\n2.) Creativity and presentation: 3.5 stars. \n3.) Quantity and substance: 3.5 stars. \n4.) Accessibility and affordability: 4 stars. \n5.) Service and ambiance: 2 stars. \n\nThis place won't be able to compare to the sushi restaurants that has better ambiance and facilities in the Richmond Districts, but with Union Square full of expensive tourist traps, I'd be interested in returning when I'm in the area.", "author": "Daniel L."}

There's only 1 sushi chef, 1 server, 1 kitchen staff, 4 tables, and 15 seats. Everyone had to walk sideways to get around. Surprisingly it was very busy. The prices were moderate. I didn't want to eat too much, so I went with the Sushi Combo, which came with Miso Soup & 7 pieces of sushi. I also order Green Tea (which tasted like barley tea) and some sort of spicy tuna roll appetizer. Everything was just decent. Nothing really stood out and nothing was really bad about it. I'm not sure if they have a bathroom either. \n\nA little about my credentials:\n\nI first got into cooking & food when I was in college.

Our local spot is our spot!  But when you're out of town, and you're not sure where to go, Yelp is obviously your friend.  We wanted something walking distance that wouldn't be crazy expensive, and decided to roll the dice on Akiko's.\n\nAs other reviewers have said, the place is tiny.  It's so tiny, you feel like you're sitting in someone's living room as they're making sushi for you in their kitchen.  But, that was part of the appeal.  We arrived and there were two tables open, but the server asked that we sit at the bar.  (One group of 3 arrived for one of the tables and I believe she had a reservation - not quite sure if they stopped to put their name down earlier or if they did have a reservation, but the table was definitely reserved.)  We were fine with sitting at the bar.\n\nSushi was a little slow as only one sushi chef is working, but it was delicious.  The sumo roll was definitely my favorite, but the San Francisco maki roll came in a close second.  We always order a rainbow roll and gauge the freshness of the fish based off that, and it was delicious.  I was a little put off by the fact that the barbeque eel came out of a plastic bag - as in, not cooked in house - but we only had one roll with the eel and it was fine.\n\nAkiko's is worth checking out if you're in the area and looking for a good sushi spot.  Definitely keep in mind the size, and the fact that there is only one sushi chef working, so if there are other patrons in the restaurant, you'll be waiting a while for your sushi rolls.", "author": "Ashleigh B."}

Let me say, 7 minutes is not THAT long, but considering this place only holds four tables and a sushi bar, and there were only 6 other people in the entire restaurant, it should have been sooner. He takes our order of 3 pieces of nigiri and the sashimi sampler and leaves. \n\nThen we wait... and wait... and wait. All the sushi chef and the server talk about is how their boss has people \"after him.\" We thought the sushi was taking so long because they were putting together the sashimi sampler - but then we ended up waiting 20 minutes for 2 PIECES OF NIGIRI while they talked about their boss. Long story short, this place has horrible service, their quality of sashimi sincerely sucks, it takes forever to get served, not only were the Japanese food items spelled incorrectly, but regular words such as \"bottle\" were mispelled.

So I specifically asked for a recommendation for a traditional sushi joint with great fish.\n\nTo be fair, it was Monday, so Akiko being open was a bad sign. But the menu was great, with a lot of interesting white fish from summer snapper to amber jack.  \n\nThe biggest problem is probably the service. The service staff seemed... angry? I was alone, and asked to sit at the sushi bar. Once sat (15 min, even though there were two empty seats and infact, they sat me in one of them eventually), I had to wait 10 minutes and ask for a menu. Then, ask for the specials menu and drink menus, and when I only got one, I had to ask for the drink menu a third time. Nonetheless, the sushi chef, though busy, seemed to be skillful and friendly, and the menu was impressive. \n\nThe service continued to be horrible. This was consistent with those around me. My neighbors soy sauce was empty, and I reached to offer them mine only to realize it too, was empty. I had to flag down my waiter to order a drink. He was just rude... I had wanted to ask the sushi chef what fish he recommended, and he insisted, \"I take all the orders\". No prob, dude, but I'd still like to ask a question. \n\nThe sushi chef was incredibly nice and asked what I wanted, and as usual, I asked for omakase (whatever you suggest). He asked what I liked and didn't, I told him whatever he wanted and then I waited another 45 minutes. Everyone around me was served items, and I just waited. He routinely asked me what I liked, and I'd expect something to come, and nada. Then, suddenly, a plate full of fish arrived, about 12 pieces of fish, a relatively good assortment, including uni. But the presentation was really meh... I'm not expecting a lot, but a little garnish would be nice.  But that seems nitpicking because... \n\nthe fish itself wasn't good. The uni was actually gooey, meaning it was no longer good. It was melting on the plate. I didn't eat it. The salmon was good, but not cut right. He hadn't even cut the slices all the way through. Doing so with chopsticks is tough even for me. The yellowtail was good, but that was it. Everything else tasted tough, and a little off. It was like it was all frozen. The slices were entirely too thick, Sashimi should melt in your mouth. This was chewy. \n\nThe kitchen was cranking out typical sushi rolls and people seemed happy with them, so perhaps I was just asking too much. But, these things happen and the sushi chef was friendliy enough. then the bill arrived. \n\nFor one small plate of sashimi and a $15 sake, the bill was 68$. I'm thrilled to pay that much and more for a good meal, but this was not one of them. That number is obscene for 12 slices of fish. \n\nI paid, I smiled. I left. \n\nThe restaurant has no email address to contact them at. I'll call tomorrow to complain.", "author": "Amanda B."}

I turn to my crackberry and check yelp.  I put in \"sushi bar\", my hotel address and 4 block radius, I was tired I didn't want to go far.  Nine places popped up I immediately eliminated four of them for being 3 stars.  Of the other five one was eliminated because it wasn't open yet, it was a little after 5 pm and I wanted to eat now.  Of the remaining four I found the one closest to me and picked that one.\n\nIt was a tiny place and I had a bit of a hard time finding the front door but once I did I was glad.  Four tables with four seats at the sushi bar, see it's tiny.  Lucky for me I was able to grab one of the two a tables for two.\n\nTea and water were given along with the menu as I review the menu I drink some tea, good tea I might add.  I decide what I wanted and place my order: disco maki, San Francisco maki and eel temaki.\n\nAs I'm waiting for my order a pickled cabbage salad of some sort in presented before me.  I take a bite, I'm not sure if I like it or not so I take another and another and by the time I reach the bottom of the bowl I decided I did like it.  It was a little sweet and a little sour but it worked well together with the cabbage.\n\nThe San Francisco maki (spicy albacore and krab) was the first to arrive and it was delish the spicy albacore was joined by some fresh avocado and the two just melted together wonderfully and the krab and roe on top wasn't bad either.  I quickly ate the 8 pieces and wished for more.\n\nNext up was the disco maki (spicy tuna and eel) it looked fantastic and was fantastic and with each bite there was a disco dance in my mouth yum yum yum. \n\nMy eel temaki was the last to arrive it looked lonely on its plate so I was nice and let it meet my mouth and I don't now how it felt but my mouth sure was happy. Their eel was wonderful, loved every bite.\n\nAfter my plates were cleared they brought me a plate of fresh orange slices, they were juicy and delicious and a nice after sushi treat.\n\nThere was only one big, tiny, thing that annoyed me the music.  See they had the radio playing and there was so much static it was killing me, it kept cutting in and out I was getting really annoyed because they just left it and acted like nothing was happening. \n\nBut the three ladies working provided great service and the food was delightful and cheap, all my food was less than $20 I couldn't believe it so I left a happy girl.", "author": "Me H."}

However, traffic seemed pretty light for lunch hour, and most patrons seemed to be there for pickup.\n\nOur waiter was very friendly, and had a good rapport with the sushi chef, they kept things lively with customers while remaining polite and giving me and my girlfriend time to ourselves.\n\nOrders came with a free cabbage + furikake (seaweed, sesame seeds, sugar, salt) salad, which was a nice touch.  The waiter was very attentive and offered us extra miso soup to go with our dishes.\n\nFood was relatively authentic - the vegetable udon was light on salt and had a decent amount of actual substance, which is better than most.  Noodles were typical, but that's neither a good thing or a bad thing.  I'd recommend katanaya if you are looking for better noodles.  My tekka-don (tuna sashimi over rice) was quite good.  This is one of the few places that has served me proper sushi rice with my sashimi donburis, as opposed to most who will serve you normal hot rice (you should only get that with chicken and eel).\n\nPrice was decent for the area, but more than I would have paid for this food at a \"great price\" restaurant.\n\nCertainly a good place for a quick, quiet lunch.", "author": "Justin L."}

If my experience is radically different from others, I try to take into consideration my own frame of mind at the time. But mine is similar. The people that work there are unusual.

The woman that works there is lacking finesse, but I'm telling you, go into any of the restaurants in China town as well. That charming, pampering type of service that so many of us Americans have come to enjoy and expect, not happening at a lot of restaurants there and a language barrier makes it worse. Before anyone crinkles an eyebrow, this restaurant is not in China Town. It's easy to find. It's on Mason one block west of Union Sq. Ok on to the food! Like so many other Asian restaurants here in SF when you sit down they bring you a pot of tea. I quite like that. Similar to how some restaurants will bring a glass of water. It's no charge and I really like that, especially on a day like today, rain, chilly. I had two rolls. The San Francisco which I quite liked. A basic sake maki which I liked as well. Their miso was good and the serving is generous. I ordered a combo which is reasonably priced. It also comes with a small cabbage salad. They did forget it, but brought it right out when I asked for it. They are not polished. They have been there a long time and we go every year.

It's on my way home from work, they have just 4 tables and a sushi bar, and it exuded a quaint, neighborhood-y vibe.  \n\nBut from the start, things just did not go our way.  Because it's so small, the seating process is a little...stressful.  You pop your head in the door between two tables to tell the waitress you're there...if you can get her attention.  Then if more people arrive, you're all just waiting outside unsure of what the procedure is.  I mean, it's not that complicated: when someone leaves, the next person in line goes in.  But still, it felt a bit uncomfortable that there was no process and no acknowledgement of your place in line.  But that's cool, it's a small joint so they're light on process. No biggie.\n\nWe were finally seated and I tried to be strategic and ordered a first round of food immediately: miso, edamame, some nigiri.  Figured I'd jump in to beat the other people who sat down at the same time we did.  Well, that failed miserably.  Everyone else got served at least their first course before us and when our starters eventually came out, the edamame was way overcooked and the miso was flavorless.  \n\nThen a coat rack fell on my head.  It didn't so much fall on its own, but had help from the shopping bags some spendy Eastern European tourists had hung from its appendages.  But no harm, no foul, and the 20 people in the place all had a good laugh about it.\n\nAnd then we sat, starters finished, for about 20 minutes without any food coming our way.  We watched as everyone around us was served, ate, and some left.  Finally, the waitress came over and asked us how were were doing.  Um, well, I've been considering eating the stray grains of sushi rice that fell off my table neighbor's plate, but other than that, I'm cool.  \n\nAt last, our rolls arrive, and they were fine.  We had a hamachi with green onion, the sumo roll, and the swamp roll.  None were particularly spectacular, but they weren't bad either.\n\nThe meal ended with some nice watermelon bites for dessert.  We paid our bill, and were the last ones to leave. \n\nI feel like I'm giving this place an outlier review as everyone around us seemed to have had a great time.  People left smiling and made a special point to thank the sushi chef.  For whatever reason, Akiko's hated us that fateful Thursday night.  And so, despite this poor experience I'm totally willing to give them another shot.  But next time, I'm wearing a helmet and packing some snacks, just in case.", "author": "Eric S."}

I found Akiko's on Bush, but inadvertently walked to this Akiko's.  By looks alone, it certainly doesn't give me the impression of a great sushi restaurant, but, really, IT IS.  \n\nPROS: The service was stellar.  We asked the server to bring us her favorite rolls and to keep them coming until we said stop.  She brought us some of the best sushi I've ever had.  Make sure you order the \"SUMO ROLL\".  By far the best roll they have.  Usually when I pull the \"bring me your favorites\" routine, the bill is extremely inflated, but not at Akiko's.  It was extremely reasonable for the amount of food and Sake we ordered.  The food is fresh, the service is great, the prices are reasonable.\n\nCONS: This place is tiny.  Minuscule.  Microscopic.  One 4-top (squeezed in), three 2-tops (shoved in corners) and a three person bar (which is uncomfortably close to the 4-top).  When I was done, I asked for a restroom and the server escorted me next door to a secured apartment building, punched in the code and told me to walk downstairs.  I walked down the stairs and emerged into an apartment's laundry room.  The bathroom there made airplane bathrooms look spacious.\n\nSUMMARY: Great food, great service, great prices.  If a table isn't available, wait for one.  Just be sure to go to the bathroom before you get there!", "author": "Nino F."}

In my opinion, that's too much for this place. Why? The sushi bar is non existent. You cannot even sit in 2 of the 5 seats because there is a table too close to the horrible barstools. And the tables? Wobble. How are we going to balance 3 beers, sake and soy sauce on a wobbly table???\n\nAnd to boot, the quality is not all that.

The sushi library.  The sushi closet. \r\n\r\nYes, this place is a uniquely adorable hole-in-the-wall, with its ornate crown mouldings, wasabi green walls and storefront location.  It certainly earns back a star for setting.  Its so tiny and there are so few patrons, you find yourself having to be extra hushed, literally conversing in whispers so as not to bother those around you and to keep your conversation semi-private.  And don't try to go to the restroom which is deep in the dungeon-like bowels of the neighboring building, requiring two separate keys to get into--one for the front door and one for the restroom.\r\n\r\nThe food is good; my compadre and I had the albacore sashimi, little salads, miso and edamame.  We also would have had a california roll with snowcrab (listed on the menu) instead of \"krab\", had the waitress understood that I wanted snowcrab (as listed on the menu), instead of fake krab, in my california roll.  Even though it was clearly listed on the menu, the waitress simply could not understand that I wanted this item substituted in my roll, neither could the sushi chef, english being their fourth or fifth language.  So I just canceled that one.  We would also have had the spicy tuna roll, the yellowtail with green onion roll and the halibut nigiri had the service not been excruciatingly slow to the point where we were forced to cancel the second part of our order in favor of punctuality to our evening merrymaking.  Before canceling the order, we made sure that the sushi chef had not yet begun to prepare the order, which she had not.  But canceling the order proved to be difficult, language barrier and all.  When the waitress finally understood that we had to cancel the second part of the order because we were in a bit of a rush, she added up our tab in a huff, punching the buttons on her calculator with surprising fury for one so diminutive and shy.  \r\n\r\nSo in summary, this is a cute, one-of-a-kind setting, but overall, a somewhat disappointing and awkward experience.", "author": "Rick H."}

This place is tiny.. which is ok until you are stuck sitting alone next to an annoying talkative European tourist for an hour and a half. No kidding.. I order a sashimi sampler and a roll and it took an hour to get them both. \n\nSittting at the sushi bar made me not want to eat, seriously. I question the cleanliness of this place after watching the sushi chef wipe plates down with the same rag she wiped off the squid covered cutting board. Also never saw her wash her hands! Even after watching this slow older woman take an hour to make about 10 rolls total, I still somewhat enjoyed my sushi. Maybe I was just starving at that point?\n\nI would say skip the place and go somewhere else.. I will next time", "author": "Sarah W."}

It might have to do with the fact that I ate here after a full day of wandering all around San Francisco with my best friend and absolutely no map and having only been a few times when I was younger.  It was an interesting day to say the least.  So I was starvvvvving, and ended up having to walk about 15 minutes to get here after walking around and taking random busses and the bart everywhere all day long. Not to mention, I had been looking forward to sushi the whole day and it was about 10:00 already.  So maybe i'm a little biased because I probably would have enjoyed almost anything at that point. \n\nBut really though, it was good quality sushi.  I got some roll.. I forgot what it was called but I think it was maybe a veggie roll or something with super fresh salmon on the outside that had lemon smothered all over it.  I love lemon. And fresh salmon. So I was very pleased. And to be honest, I still crave that roll everytime I get sushi.  I have no clue what my friend got but she enjoyed it as well. The sushi chef was really nice too, which always adds to the experience.  Yeah, it's a bit tiny but I thought it was cute. But then, once again, I came at 10:00 at night so it wasn't exactly crowded.\nIn conclusion, it was pretty great for the price.  You should probably try to come at an off hour to avoid being cramped in there. But definitely give it a try. :)", "author": "Kim S."}

Akiko's was no different, me and my friend were able to score a table relatively easily, but people coming in and out throughout the night were forced to wait.\n\nThe first thing that hit me when I came in was the extreme humidity going on in the place. You get used to it, but it's quite a hit to the face after walking around a cool SF night.\n\nThat night there was only one sushi chef working behind the counter, which I feel is the usual case. So you're going to have wait a long time for your order to come out as that one lone chef is inevitably overworked. Again, this is something you have to expect with a small place. \n\nUnfortunately I didn't feel like the sushi I got that night was worth the wait. The rice didn't taste all that fresh nor did the fish amaze me either way. Maybe again, it's because the place was so humid that the fish and rice tasted a bit average, but in any case, I was disappointed with what I got after having to wait so long for the order to get sent out. Definitely okay sushi, but not worth the time it took.", "author": "Roland C."}

The menu is simply the standard temikos, nigiris and makis, with a handful of appetizers, all at standard (read: sushi bills can add up, but there's no major sticker shock).\n\nYet, despite it's small stature, it seems to have a loyal following: Every sit was filled (although that wasn't too hard to accomplish), and the stream of to-go orders was every bit as consistent.\n\nLikewise, a small restaurant has a small staff...which means it takes a while for the food to come.

Sure it was really small (it only had like what, like 5 tables and 5 seats at the sushi bar?), but hey, that added to the intimacy and it makes you feel that you're not forgotten in a big restaurant atmosphere. Whatever though about the size. The food here is great! I got the Phildelphia Roll Special (I think that's what it was...it wasn't the regular Philly Roll...) and the eel tasted amazing! I also ordered the Kamikaze Roll (which also had eel) and that was effin' fantastic! I do understand though, that everybody has their own personal preference on sushi, some are connoiseurs of the roll and some just simply get California Rolls and call themselves a sushi lover. I really have no more credibility than the next person aside from going to quite a few sushi places here and there. Regardless, personally, I think it's a great little place.

The San Francisco Maki I didn't enjoy as much, the shreds of crab on top freaked me out for some reason.   I love that for such a tiny place, on a Friday night, it wasn't crowded at all.  And the icing on the cake is that they bring you a plate of fruit out with the check to cleanse the palate!  and they give you different kinds each time, last time I had watermelon, last night it was oranges!  A thoroughly enjoyable sushi experience, one star off for the weird shredded crab.", "author": "Caleb D."}

Awkward.\n\nAte alone, took a little table against the wall.  Only had one chair - against the wall was a built-in bench.  Which was about 4 inches lower than the table....sat there first, and the table was tight against the top of my legs - would have had to bend over double to eat.  So I had to take the chair on the other side of the table, and eat while staring at the wall, while other diners occaisionally stuck their butt in my face.  Nice.\n\nI ordered a tuna roll and a california roll.  No fancy stuff here, just your basic three-ingredient sushi.  Not a busy night.  Took 51 minutes for my food to arrive.  51 MINUTES!!!!!!!   While staring at the wall!!!!   I brought a book to read while I ate, and I finished it 30 minutes in.  They only brought my food when I stood up to walk out.  For christ's sake, I don't get 51 minutes to myself in a frickin' WEEK.....I can't invest that much time waiting for food that takes less than 5 minutes to eat.\n\nAnd in all that time?  No refill on the coke.  Waitress never came back, wouldn't come if waved, nothing.  Had to eat my sushi dry, when it did finally come.  Yum.  And the waitress was CREEPY.  No noise - she didn't speak, she just mouthed words at you.  She wouldn't make eye contact, and drifted slowly across the room.  No noise when she walked, and when she poured water?  If it made more noise than she was happy with, she'd stop pouring for a second.  Dribble....dribble....drib...dribble....  For god's sake woman, hurry the fuck up!\n\nI've lived in China for about a month, Japan for a few weeks, and several other Asian countries for at least a little while.  I'm familiar with the \"quiet grace\" or whatever that you sometimes get....but I've also done a couple years as a jail guard and seen a lot of battered women, and I'll bet you $100 this is the second category.

I have eaten here 4-5 times and have been happy with it.\nPrice is not an object as it is reimbursed by the company, if I were to go on my own dime it is a little pricey. \nThe quality of the fish is consistently very good. I always order the salmon (sliced lemon in between pieces of fish) and yellowtail sashimi. They serve normal color ginger not that weird pink stuff. \nFor those who like the rolls: the spicy tuna roll is great because they don't put a bunch of mayo in it. Mayo=sickening. The Volcano roll is a wonderful pile of fried crab over a spicy salmon roll; very rich.\nThe service is pretty good. I haven't gotten to know them because I only go about 1x per month and with clients so we are talking about stuff. I typically like to get to know my sushi chef but time has not allowed it. Oh well. They are always nice.\nWe always time our arrival either by 11:45 or after 1 so we can beat the crowds.\nOh yeah, the presentation is beautiful.

The sushi bar is across street from my favorite gym, Club One on Mason. I want to give a shout to out the Club One staff, thanks for recommeding this cool sushi bar to me. The bar had a cool menu, the prices were reasonable, it won't break you. I order, the Kappa Maki, Avacado Maki, Caifornia Makki and the Spicy Tuna Makki. They were all good, but the Spicy Tuna wasn't spicy enough for me, I had to add more wasabi, to give it some heat. I will go back to try other items on the menu", "author": "Baseemah R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-11-23", "description": "A bare bones sushi experience. Very basic interior. Small room (4 tables). Friendly staff. Food was pretty good. Most of the sashimi was very good, but the tuna was slightly aged (not smelly or anything, just not in its prime). The salads are great and creative. Highly recommended. The prices are considerably lower than of the more fancy competition. Hence, if you are in for a quick dinner, this is a great place...", "author": "Mark S."}

Its just a salmon roll with slivers of lemon on top, which sounds incredibly simple, but it is just incredibly good.  Seriously, I've made so many of my friends come here just so I could stop by for this roll and some miso soup, its ridiculous.  I actually came here for my birthday with about 12 people, which you would think would pretty much fill up the entire restaurant, but they squeezed us in and left a table for 2 and the bar open... it was pretty crazy.  They do take reservations, but call the day of your reservation to reconfirm too - I called the day of and they had no idea 12 people were coming to dinner.  But hey, at least they do take reservations.  Don't expect the fastest service, because there's only one sushi chef here, but do expect good quality stuff.  Man, if I didn't have to drive so far to get it, i'd totally hit it up right now.  sushi monster want sushi...", "author": "Margie N."}
