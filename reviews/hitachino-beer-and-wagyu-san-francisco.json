I had heard this place was a BFD to come stateside, though, so we decided to get one round just to try it. This place was pretty empty on a Saturday night around 8PM which is surprising.\n\nWe were sat at a table in the bar area and could not decide what beers to order based on their short list. We asked our server for some help and she recommend the Red Rice Ale ($10) and the Yuzu Lager ($12) so we got one of each to share. Let me just say, both of these beers were unique and delicious. I definitely preferred the Yuzu Lager since it was lighter and the flavor was more subtle than the strong Red Rice Ale but would not hesitate to drink either again. The price for these beers is worth it, even if only once in a while. They were so unique and delicious.\n\nI have to say, even though we came in for drinks we got to see the food coming out of the kitchen and it both looked and smelled fantastic. I want to come back and eat here, even if it will be an expensive meal.", "author": "Carrie W."}

Yes, it's a bit expensive, especially if you're ordering the tasting menu, but if you're looking for steak, you should expect that price.  \n\nTo start, we split the Wagyu burger-- they only serve 5 per night!  They were kind enough to cut it in half for us, which worked out well because of its size (it's a pretty big burger.) We really wanted the katsu sandwich but couldn't justify spending $125, despite our desire to find a great katsu sandwich outside of Japan.\n\nFor mains, I ordered the Wagyu donburi and my boyfriend ordered the steak.

Yes, the food was that bad. \n\nHere's the problem. They are advertising Wagyu beef at Wagyu prices but, in the dishes that we ordered, it definitely wasn't Wagyu. The uni and Wagyu tempura might have been a London broil, the beef tongue skewer was unseasoned, gamey and a total mess. The other special skewers were rolled into balls of something that was indescribable. In fact, I had no idea what we were eating at that point.

With how pricy Hitachino is, I was so happy to see reasonable prices here. I've easily paid $12-15 for Hitachino elsewhere so even though it was still pricey I felt spoiled by the prices.\n\nThey had three sours on tap that I got through including a salty plum gose that was unlike any beer I've ever had. The bartender told me that it's not actually a gose by style but I definitely was fooled. So good.\n\nFor food I had the octopus sunomo, beef tongue and wagyu nigiri. They were all so good but the nigiri took the cake. So succulent and the glaze really brought it up to another level.\n\nThe bartender again was fantastic. I didn't catch him name but he was so educated in all the beers and food. You could tell he cared about his work and spent more time than I was expecting chatting me up.

One person was vegetarian and they did a terrific tasting menu for her that was very innovative and tasty (something they don't tell you unless you ask for it).  We're picky eaters and all our dishes were excellent and you get the right amount of food (the curry was a bit of a miss for me, but the other dishes more than made up for it).  The nigiri and the sandwich were to die for.  The tempura banana with a dab of chocolate ganache for dessert was also very good.  We also had a few a la carte items that were very good.\n\nDon't eat here if you're on a budget and think you're going to get wagyu on the cheap.  That ain't happening, stick to the beers and then eat elsewhere.  And I wouldn't recommend doing the a la carte.  The tasting menu has a great flow to it with good presentation, variety and flavors.  You're never going to get that experience from just one or two of the dishes.  And unless you're an expert on Japanese cuisine, picking out something by itself is likely to be more of a miss than a hit.

Our waiter gave us a taste and we were very impressed.\n\nThe time, attention, and intention put into their dishes is evident when you taste the food.

We recently came back to try out their pop-up lunch menu. My husband had the wagyu curry and I had the wagyu ramen.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-07-28", "description": "I'm disappointed to leave such a bad review for this place, but not as disappointed as I was in the food here considering how good the menu sounded.\n\nWe've enjoyed Hitachino beer before and really love wagyu and Japanese dishes, so to see that they had opened a tap room of sorts in SF was exciting for us - and it is the only one in the US, which feels really special. At first...\n\nIt was a Friday evening at 6:30 and the restaurant was pretty empty, I'd say there were two other tables other than our own and a couple bar patrons. The door was left open and it was pretty drafty, but whatever. If a place has bad ventilation, I guess they have to do that, so fair enough.\n\nFirst bad signs; they were out of two of the 10 or so Hitachino beers that they offer. One of the specials was a Hefeweizen, and that's what we ordered. Hefeweizen is one of my favorite styles of beer but this tasted so sour it might as well have been a gose. Really tangy and not in a way that suited this style. I was willing to accept that it might've been more suited to Japanese tastes and chalked it up to experience. Still, I was disappointed that the server said it had 'classic hefeweizen flavors' and it kinda didn't. It was also expensive, $10 for maybe about 10 oz. You'd pay less to get a bottle of Hitachino at a speciality liquor store. Again though, I was still excited because the menu seemed amazing.\n\nWe hemmed and hawed about what to order, and decided on a large curry and the donburi to split. First to arrive was the donburi, and the wagyu on top was (and I'm being generous) like pretty decent quality roast beef. Certainly nothing special. There were less than 10 slices, an admittedly well done soft boiled egg and oh...about 1/2 cup of rice. Rice is cheap - fill it up for $29, please.\n\nAlready kinda disappointed, but it got worse - my dining companion found either a hard piece of plastic or a piece of glass in his portion of the donburi. When the server came back we told him and he offered to take the donburi off the bill. All good there - can't fault the guy and the way it was handled, and if the food wasn't so awful I'd be giving an extra star just for this fact. I appreciated the quick and courteous service and the way the situation was dealt with. The situation shouldn't have happened (something hard and inedible in food is far worse than any little hair or anything, which I wouldn't even have complained about) but they took it off the bill no questions asked. We stopped eating it but the bowls were left on our table and felt kinda shameful, haha.\n\nThen the curry arrived and it was subpar. Again, very little rice was given with this dish (and since we hadn't ate that donburi we were pretty hungry) and the curry itself was more soupy. It was almost like a spiced beef stew. I can't fault the spice profile on the curry - BUT, homemade curry straight from roux blocks is just as good. Any quick service curry in Japan will be tastier. The wagyu in the curry was okay, a bit fatty and kinda tough but at least it didn't contain any foreign particles.\n\nWe could tell that after we found the foreign object in our food that our server felt uncomfortable - honestly, it wasn't his fault and the service was fine. When the food is this bad, this meanly portioned and this expensive however, I can't give more than 2 stars. When that happens AND we find some random inedible object in the food, I can't give more than 1 star. Sorry Hitachino, not for me. I'll stick to the bottles.", "author": "Chelsea C."}

I'm a fan of Hitachino Beer in general, so it's owl-fully nice to have a taproom in the city ;)\n\nHH special is $10 for 3 small pours of your choice. I think they were roughly 1/3 pint each. My favorite was Anbai with salt ume. The Saison du Japon was summery and pleasant with flavors from yuzu. Cherry Blossom and Red Rice ale was decent but not a standout for me.\n\nThe bar snacks were pretty good. We shared a pickle plate, which was basically just kimchi. Ordered the beef tendon stew with konyakku. The beef was super tender, though I think the broth could have been more seasoned. Chicken thigh and gizzard was probably the best.

We all thoroughly enjoyed our picks ranging from the red ale to the red wine barrel aged sour that actually reminded me of Russian River Brewing's Consecration.\n\nSo why the 2 stars?  I was incorrectly charged extra on my credit card despite having the gratuity already included in the total amount given our party size.  I called and left a message to have the manager follow up with me, but I received no return call despite clearly stating that I would dispute the charge if I did not hear back in a timely manner.

So just don't come - you'll be setting yourself and the restaurant up for failure.\n\nAlso, if you're reading a lot of the 1-star reviews from last year, those are not an accurate representation of the restaurant as it is today (April 2018) since it opened without a full menu. As of this review, there was a full tasting menu along with a WAGYU-full a la carte menu with a variety of ways to partake in the yummeat. \n\nWe decided to pass on the tasting menu, because there were a lot of fancy words that sounded like garnishes and edible flowers, and we already had our eyes on a few things that we knew would blow us away just as much as a beautifully plated, multi course option. \n\nLet's get to the meat. \n\nWe got the Wagyu Bacon Mochi, the Skewer Set (with Wagyu Katsu / Wagyu Meatball / Beef Tongue / Mushroom that I can't remember), Wagyu Nigiri, Wagyu Donburi, Wagyu Curry & Rice (Large) and the kitchen surprised us with the dessert (melon in multiple ways). \n\nThe Wagyu Nigiri was my favorite thing from the evening. The meat was soooo tender. The order comes with two pieces. We liked it so much we wanted to place another order for dessert but they started wiping down the kitchen and brought out complimentary dessert. \n\nThe Skewer Set was also top. That Wagyu meatball literally crumbles in your mouth. So delicious. I wanted an entire loaf of it (can you guys do that, plz?). Katsu, Tongue and Mushroom were also tasty but outshined by that meatball. \n\nDonburi was the most generous meat-wise, with a perfectly poached egg and super garlicky (YUM) white rice underneath. Really nice. Would order again. My dining buddy is all about the curry & rice so we ordered the large portion, which was really indulgent (our waiter warned us). It was one of the richest Japanese curries I've had... the spices, the wagyu and the heat. So much so that we had to order a side of rice (they've got their rice down) so we could finish it... but we did because it was that good. \n\nThe only thing that I would not order again was the Wagyu Bacon Mochi. It sounded really unique so we knew we wanted to try it however the rice paste was warm (maybe seared?) and therefore super sticky and much too much for the amount of meat that it came with. If I had put the whole thing in my mouth I might have choked because it was so adhesive to all parts of my mouth. \n\nI would instead slot in the Wagyu Tantanmen Ramen. We'll be back for that one. \n\nDessert was nice (and not just 'cause it was free), but let's face it, we're here for the meat and not the dessert. I'd rather have Wagyu Nigiri to close out the meal than something sweet. \n\nBeer. For beer lovers I imagine that it's a treat to be able to pair some of these unique options with the wagyu. I enjoy beer but my beer palette is pretty simple and unsophisticated so we just ordered a few of Hitachino beers: the Yuzu Lager & the Japanese Classic Ale. Really tasty and unique flavors - really nice to have with our meat picks. That's as much as I can tell you on this front. \n\nService was really chill and it seems like all of the guys genuinely enjoy working there which makes for a much nicer experience for everyone all around. \n\nOverall, I think the restaurant deserves a lot more love than it's getting and we for sure will be back in soon!", "author": "Sam P."}

Ewww, why does it taste like a golden shower?!\n\nSo much for underage drinking. \n\nI never took a drink again until I was 27 but ended up getting carried away into the kitchen at Infusion Lounge (Hi, dad!). \n\nThe first time I had a taste of craft beer was just a couple of years ago. I was at a fancy sushi restaurant when I had taste of Hitchino Nest White Ale. I was amazed at how refreshingly light, crisp, and citrusy it was. I'm still not much of a beer person and prefer the hard stuff but Hitachino really opened my eyes at how good beer should taste. Not to mention, the pink owl is cutest beer logo ever. \n\nLike many, I've been anticipating the opening of Hitachino Beer & Wagyu's first U.S. location in San Francisco. After two failed attempts to get reservations, we finally lucked out last week. After multiple people voicing complaints of trying to compete with 3,000+ people on their mailing list and possible tech bots, Hitachino now has a more equitable lottery based reservation system (sign up for their mailing list to receive the link to be placed in the lottery). Thank you to Luna, the Social Media Manager for promptly responding to everyone's messages and emails. \n\nCurrently, reservations are for their Head-to-Tail Wagyu Tasting Menu ($68 pp): http://bit.ly/2nedMCm. Optional drink pairing is +$30 pp. Beer and sake only. The bar is walk-in only with a small bites/snack menu. \n\nWhile waiting for one of our friends who was running late (again), we started with some beers and ordered some small plates from the bar menu. \n\nAs someone who loves ginger, I started with the Real Ginger Brew ($10): http://bit.ly/2mMreum. This was disappointing as it tasted more malty than gingery. The Weizen ($9): http://bit.ly/2mMmsgp was more up my alley - crisp with banana and vanilla notes. My friends really enjoyed the Rotating Barrel Aged Beers: Three-Day Aged and the Sessions ($12). \n\nOn the bar menu, we ordered the Chicken Gizzards, Pork Belly Kakuni, Spicy Squid ($8 each): http://bit.ly/2nWbqoJ. They're all prepared sous vide in a jar and poured onto plates tableside. Sadly, we didn't care for any one of them. They were very bland and had lost all its texture - tasted liked boiled meat. The Spiced Nuts ($8) were a tad better: http://bit.ly/2mMAUVq but lacked a hearty crunch. \n\nAs for the Wagyu Tasting Menu ($68): http://bit.ly/2nedMCm it was a collection of hits and items that were just ok. Portions are small so anticipate possibly needing a second dinner (we went to Halal Guys afterwards).\n\n(1) Otooshi - Wintermelon w/ bonito, 24 carat gold flakes: http://bit.ly/2mMtiCC\n(2) Wagyu Tataki w/ smoked tosazu, eggplant, chive: http://bit.ly/2mlhk6K\n(3) Kobujime, burrata, edamame, dry tomato, ginger, katsuo-bushi: http://bit.ly/2mMA2jK\n(4) Tongue, scallion, yuzukoshou: http://bit.ly/2n0Jpx0\n(5) Oden Oxtail w/ daikon, konnyaku, beer mustard (portion for 2): http://bit.ly/2nsiywF\n(6) Yakiniku w/ apple, sesame, soy: http://bit.ly/2mMJxzm\n(7) Tantanmen w/ spicy sesame broth: http://bit.ly/2mIbmrX\n(8) Soy Milk Panna Cotta w/ mandarin orange granite: http://bit.ly/2nWcbhR\n(9) Barley Tea (caffeine-free) w/ brown butter cookies: http://bit.ly/2n0JOQ2\n\nTable favorites were the meat skewers and tantanmen. The gyutan had a very light crisp exterior with an incredibly tender interior. Tongue is one of my favorite cuts of meat. Some may cringe at the thought of eating cow tongue but seriously, don't knock it until you try it. The yakiniku was meltingly tender and had a great savory sweetness. The tantanmen was the most substantial thing on the menu and was Japanese comfort food in a bowl. The umami laden broth had great depths of flavor and the noodles were perfectly al-dente. I usually don't like thin, straight noodles but these were really good. \n\nThere was nothing bad about the other items on the tasting menu. They were just very subtle in flavor and a bit underwhelming compared to the yakiniku and tantanmen.\n\nThe staff are very polite but there are inevitable service kinks for just having opened. There were long lags between courses as servers were also the food runners. We were only one of two tables when we first arrived and one of three as it got later in the night. Not sure if someone called in sick but they need more staff to expedite orders more promptly especially when they're a full house.\n\nReservations are hard to come by because Hitachino is not a large space. There's 5 booths, 1 four top, 2 two tops, and 8 seats at the bar. It will be easier for you to get in as a group of 4 than a party of 2 so plan ahead. Thank you for food porn friendly lighting!\n\nParking can be very challenging so plan to take a lyft or uber here. \n\nCan't wait until they offer an A la Carte Menu in the future. When they do, stick with the yakiniku and the tantanmen...and wash it down with several $10-$12 glasses of beer because...San Francisco!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Well I'm still wondering too because it never made it to my table and I was actually ok with that after seeing the gizzard. \n\nThe food had a decent flavor but was much too mushy for my liking.  The gizzard was so soft that I could barley feel it in my mouth. \n\nI was hoping to try some wagu but I'm happy I went with appetizers first. The appetizer should prepare you for whats coming next, but it only disappointed me. \n\nThe stout didn't taste like a stout at all. More of a dark larger, again not what I anticipated and not in a good way. \n\nThe place was pricey, so the first shot for me was a miss so I ended up having dinner elsewhere after..", "author": "Yosof R."}

It was busy on a Friday early evening but I was able to snag my friend and I one of the standing tables o the side. My friend and I got a beer each along with a couple bar bites. Beer was good and the food not bad either! All the food comes out in jars and then they pour it out into the plates. They sous vide all of their food which is really interesting and a notch up from regular bar bites you would usually get. Nothing special about the food though, but still pretty decent. Meatballs were probably the best. Would come back again if I was in the area, but there's a lot of other great places in the area as well so competition is high. I'm also not the biggest beer drinker so this review is probably a bit biased as well.\n\nWould be interested in how the tasting menu is as that seems to have great reviews.", "author": "Megan K."}

Fireworks in the mouth! Warm rice, tender wagyu, this first taste was promising. The uni tempura was next, with wagyu, beer butter, shiso, lightly battered and fried, served with matcha salt. So scrumptious! Then came the nagaimo skewer, mountain yam, with wagyu pok\u00e9 and bonito flakes. A bit salty. The tongue skewer was next, which I gave to my husband.. it has an interesting presentation, the skewer was like floating! Next came the dumplings in a bamboo basket. Two types, the wagyu soup dumpling, like a xiu long bao, and the surf and turf ( wagyu beef with crab and shrimp ) Thai sticky rice dumpling. The rice was undercooked, so it was gritty to chew. The dipping sauce was wonderful! Then came the pork belly chasyu somen noodles, in a soy milk dashi broth and black garlic oil. We ordered the truffle extra. This was so good, we finished everything, broth and all! The Japanese wagyu katsu curry rice was next, it was good, the curry was spicy. Then came the wagyu sandwich, white milk bread. Banana tempura with chocolate sauce was the dessert. I have to say the dessert was a weak finale. I would have preferred a panna cotta ( saw that in previous menu ), or even a simple ice cream. But a fried banana was just not my cup of tea after an excellent wagyu dinner. \nOur server Kevin was awesome!! He explained the menu items with great passion and great details! We can tell he loves what he is doing!! \nHope the chef would expand the dessert selection, in time for our next visit. \nWe were lucky to find a parking spot, but we saw parking garages in the area too.", "author": "lovetoeat a."}

It was their 3 basic ales (white, red, stout). You'll never have a chance to taste their rotating taps. \n\nFor some reason most of their menu is US wagyu instead of hitachi wagyu. The tasting menu had a hitachi wagyu donburi but a la carte uses US wagyu. \n\nPricing is a bit ridiculous for the dishes. \n$29 for a small donburi with tough U.S. wagyu meat. Not worth it...most expensive donburi I've ever had and most disappointing. \n$10small/$16 for curry. The stew was like water and had no flavor. For meat that's been stewed in the curry it also had no flavor and was a bit tough. The portions was laughably small. Honestly I would rather buy instant curry for $3 at a store....\n$17 for tantanmen. This was actually pretty decent but not $17 good. I would pay about $10 tops especially when the noodles are store bought. \n\nThe 3 dishes were recommended by the servers. None of them were any good. Disappointing since the tasting menu was so good. \n\nNo wonder the restaurant was empty. I for sure would never come back for the a la carte menu. \nIf you want noodles go get mensho down the street rather than here. \n\nIf you are thinking of coming just do the tasting menu.

They were all good but the portion was way too small.  Another thing we noticed was that they serve food at your table from canned bottles.  The server had to shake each bottle to get out the food inside onto plates.  I am not sure if it meant to be \"hip\" or something.  It just gave us an impression that the food was prepared well in advance and preserved for a while (Not cooked freshly for us).  The wagyu was tasty but the portion was really small.\n\nThe service:  It was okay.  Our server was nice but didn't come to our table often, which was good and bad.

We originally planned on going to liholiho for a baked Hawaii afterwards, but did not because we were content.\n\n$78 wagyu tasting menu. $30 beer pairing. We skipped the beer pairing since some of us had happy hour before. \n\nDRINKS/FOOD\nDai dai ale- pale ale with mikan (small orange) and I liked it\nUme beer- a special not on the menu, with plum, friends liked it as well\nOtooshi- presentation was pretty and it was good. Liked that they accommodated my intolerance to dairy\nTataki- the beef was tender and the jelly was very smoky! The foie gras supplement worked well with the dish, but it was delicious without it too\nKobujime- very good, texture of beef was ok, I think I got a chewy piece. Uni supplement was okay in here but the uni was very fresh, I would have enjoyed it alone more\nTongue- one of the best dishes that night, so tender. We all were wow'ed\nOden oxtail- this was tasty and served from canned bottles, it was their method of preparing the dish. Oxtail was super tender and daikon well cooked like it should be\nYakuniku sushi- probably the least favorite if I had to choose. The sushi piece was ginormous. It would have been better if split into two. The butter corn on the side was ok.\nWagyu donburi- this was tasty, we all enjoyed it\nTantanmen- my favorite of the night. The noodles were yummy, like the thinner Hakata ramen noodles which I prefer. The spiciness of the soup was good and better with the added chili paste. Serving size was a lot bigger than we expected and we all were saying how full we were but we all finished it!\nSoymilk panna cotta- my friends said this was ok but the lemon curd and the granita that it comes with was yummy. Mine had extra lemon curd in place of the panna cotta which I have no objections to. It was delicious to me\nBarley tea & brown butter cookie- perfect way to end the meal. \n\nDECOR/AMBIANCE\nVery nicely decorated place; please see photos.\nI love the small touches of the Hitachino owl on the water and beer glasses. So cute! A little dimly lit but comfortable. Sound level was not too loud either.\n\nSERVICE\nGreat service, our waiter was friendly and described everything in detail, took our orders with no mistakes. Food came out fairly smoothly except for one dish, but it didn't bother us. By the time we finished our meal, there was a line at the door. We weren't rushed to leave though. \n\nOverall, I had a great time and would return when I feel like wagyu again. It's a great place to take someone who like wagyu- a unique head to tail wagyu tasting experience with a large selection of good Jpn beer. Just need to book in advance!

Also, when I came on a Thursday evening it was pretty empty surprisingly.\n\nAlso, the food is insanely expensive and served in small portions. Perhaps they are good quality or whatnot, but when I'm at a bar, I expect affordable sliders and skewers...

Came here early after work and it was empty when I peeked in. I hesitated for a second, but went in and shortly after the place was filled and had a queue at the bar. The reservation for tables are full for a well over a month.\n\nI think the experience here will very based on expectation and what you came here for. If you're here for a drink to try out some brews, it's a great location. The snacks here are sous vide (at least when I was here) and may take a while to prep. When I was here, one of my order was forgotten and I had to remind the server to check on it almost 20minutes in. The food here was a little on the bland side, the sous vide did mean that things are very tender. But in all honesty, it's more gimmick and cool factor than taste. I do see a point in keeping the food light to not mess with your taste when tasting the more delicate flavor of their beer, however, i prefer my snacks to be more flavorful.\n\nI'd give this location a 4 star if I was just here for drinks, I probably have a less negative experience as I was one of the first ones int and avoided any wait time. I'd give this place a lower rating (3 stars) if I have to base it off the food and pricing of the snack items. I don't mind paying good a little more for snacks, but it just wasn't to my taste. Overall, I'd give it a 3 as I can imagine what majority of the folks may experience coming and having to deal with the wait. \n\nin short, stop by for a drink if you see that it's not crazy crowded.

I'll have to go with the 3-star givers.\n\nLike any good review, and like many written about this place, this restaurant brings up memories past. When I turned 21 (in 2007), I'd like to say that I was growing up in an era where brewing beer was getting popular. I was experimenting with lots of different types of alcohol, especially beer since it fit my cheap budget. I'd go to stores like Bevmo or different drinking establishments and try a lot of different beverages. I remember see Hitachino, in a bottle with a cute label with an owl on it. Oh, and it's Japanese? Must be good. Since those days, I've had random encounters with Hitachino at different restaurants and it was always delicious.\n\nWhen I learned that Hitachino Beer & Wagyu was opening, I had to try for a spot in the lottery. When I found out I was able to go, I was pretty dang excited.\n\nEverything was delicious--there's no doubt about that. However, I would say that there are lots of kinks that need to be worked out. I went with the prix fixe menu which was $68. I added the drink pairing ($30) and an uni/foie gras pairing ($30). This totaled $128. Was it worth it? No. I mean, damn they're literally charging $15 for a small piece of uni and $15 for some foie gras. They weren't even big or that tasty. I was with friends who didn't get the uni/foie and it was clear that the chefs literally just \"tacked it [the uni/foie] on\" the side of my dish. I mean, if I'm going to fine dining, I am looking for some artfully designed dishes. If something can just be tacked on (like putting jalape\u00f1os on a burger), then it's as if there's no real vision for the dish. The waitress also mentioned in the beginning something about, \"this is a head-to-toe experience\" where you'll be getting tongue and oxtail. It seemed sort of cheesy that she mentioned this and other than the fact we were served these animal parts, there was no head-to-toe theme about the experience.\n\nThere was only one dish that stood out to me, which was indeed the tongue. The small amount of oxtail I got is also worth mentioning. Everything else was just OK.\n\nSo, is it worth coming it? Not yet, at least. It is overpriced and the food could be more colorful. If anything, just come here to see if you could snag a seat at the bar and just drink some of their delicious brew that is definitely worth your while (which is why I was so excited in the first place).", "author": "Marlon T."}

I don't mind paying $10 per glass on draft, even though they were served in smaller glasses - it's an expensive beer in general. Interior was plain and tidy, I imagine closely replicating a small Japanese locale. \n\nI expected everything to be incredibly delicious considering the cost of the food. The starters we got - octopus and radish - were good, not great. I got the raw wagyu \"salad?\". It was cute and served on a nicely seasoned piece of burrata (why?) and came with a small side of uni. It was an interesting attempt with good flavors all around but fell flat conceptually, which makes me sad for forking over $28 for it. For whatever reason, our ramen took forever - it was the best part of the meal (rich broth, didn't love the noodles) and also the most reasonably priced. \n\nWe left feeling underwhelmed and uninspired to return. 2 beers each + 2 starters + raw wagyu \"salad\" + bowl of ramen + Saratoga bottled sparkling = $110 for 2 people.

Great selection of Japanese craft beers and they are definitely devoted to the art of well-marbled beef. We enjoyed every dish we ordered, especially the wagyu curry and wagyu ribeye steak. They do use American wagyu, but I honestly thought it was still some of the best beef I've had.\n\nIt is a bit of a niche establishment and it is not cheap, so I can see how maybe it isn't for everyone.   For the price you can definitely eat at some of the nicer restaurants in SF. But I don't see why Hitachino wouldn't be up there. If you enjoy Asian-style beers and love the craft of beef in general, then this place is definitely worth checking out.", "author": "Rob C."}

This place has a huge number of service staff, but only one waitress, and she's not super knowledgeable. We had a 7:00pm reservation for four on Saturday, but even though our table was ready when we got there, we were left at the bar to wait for half an hour until we asked about our table, which was empty and prepped the whole time. Not only we're so many of the taps out, but they told us that there is only a tasting menu. When we told them we didn't want to do it and were just going to drink, they gave us the a la carte menu that didn't exist. Our waitress then continued to explain to us that many of the items weren't available anyway. How's the food and drink? Beers are generally sour and tart, so not quite in my wheelhouse, but also not quite explained properly in the menus and not all available. When asked about my first two picks, our waitress said neither were available anymore. The food was whatever. Pork belly bar bite? Huge chunks of fat with almost no meat. Same flavor as you would from your Chinese mama braising pork belly, but with no actual meat. Gizzards and thighs? Extremely overcooked. Meat was springy and tasted like it had been sitting in a pot for too long. Tongue skewers? Most people who have had it enjoyed it, but honestly, it just tasted like squares of liver. The garnish on top was identical to a Chinese scallion and ginger dipping sauce for Hainan chicken. I thought this place was supposed to be Japanese? Why are almost all of the flavors Chinese? They have a lot of work to do.", "author": "Danny C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-03-29", "description": "Hitachino beers have been a favorite, but the ones tasted here were quite surprisingly terrible. The low rating, however, is due largely to what can only be perceived as pretentiousness and a failure to appreciate food for what it is. The menu had a fixed dinner option (approx. $80/person) that was available only by a lottery system of those who signed online, and they've only had several soft openings (four is what is heard as the current tally) at this point. Rather than resorting to marketing gimmicks to make themselves more attractive, might want to focus on the quality of drinks and food to draw in customers. Certain food options on their bar menu were already sold out. And our server wouldn't stop talking about how they would be adding \"foie gras\" and \"uni\" to their dishes, but couldn't explain why those ingredients would enhance or otherwise work with the other ingredients of the dish. Simply adding caviar, foie gras, or uni with no cohesion to the overall dish is commonly used to mark up prices or make them seem fancier to the ignorant. Disappointed.

I was SO excited - my boyfriend and I are obsessed with Hitachino beer, and had been honored that they were opening in SF. We got in as soon as we could! Unfortunately, the tasting menu was a big disappointment. The beer was still AMAZING - loved all the new kinds we got to try - but the food was a let down. So, 5 stars for stopping in for a beer, 2 stars for dinner.\n\nSpecifically, the food was good but very small and very expensive, the service was atrocious, and the meal took over 3 hours (lots of waiting). Our table of 4 paid $440 + tax + tip and I thought the experience was very meh - for that price, I would want something pretty special. \n\nI won't bore you with all the details of service, so I'll just describe our first beer order as an example. When we first sat down, we all got the beer/sake pairing. They asked us what drinks we wanted to start, so we ordered some, assuming that it was the full-sized drink included in the pairing. It wasn't - just an extra beer - which felt a little bad/taken advantage of, but it was fine since we were happy to drink more of their tasty tasty beer. Soon they brought us a set of beers different from what we ordered. The waitress asked us to repeat our orders and we did, and she told us they were out of one, so we replaced it with a different one. After some confusion, she took the first round of beers away (I don't know if they were for a different table or what). Then a different waitress comes to tell us that that they were out of one of the beers (which we knew already). We told her we'd already placed a replacement order. Then a new waitress told us there was a problem with the kegs, and that we wouldn't have our beer for a while. All in all it took forever to get our beers, which we were unknowingly paying extra for, and it was a really confusing and disruptive process getting them.  I think maybe they are still working on the kinks but I wanted to let y'all know about my experience in the meantime.", "author": "Maia B."}

Who doesn't love beer and meat? And not just that, wagyu! \n\nI arrived about twenty minutes early, but waited at the bar. They have a beer menu on the wall with varieties that I believe aren't readily available at most places. I have only seen a few at Total Wine, but it's never the same as drinking it at a bar when it's on tap. They had a seasonal beer, but I went with the red rice ale as it sounded pretty interesting. Smooth tasting, slightly sweet - I could imagine drinking this daily. I ordered a tongue skewer to start since I figured even after we ordered, it would still take a little time to get some food. The tongue skewer was amazing and I am now a lover of yuzukoshou!\nEven though the table was ready early, they said I could finish my snack at the bar and just let them know when I was ready. \nDinner is based on a pri fixe menu that is $78 per person. They have add ons depending on what is fresh, like Hokkaido uni or soft shell crab. If you are super hungry, they have add ons like US or Japan grown wagyu steaks (the Japanese one is more expensive, of course). \nOverall, I really enjoyed dinner. Service pretty good. The standouts were the wagyu tongue skewers, the oden, and the soy milk panna cotta (can I order that from the bar?). The wagyu dishes were good, but like a few other people have mentioned, the slices are a bit too big so it was hard for me to eat. Not that it meant that it tasted bad, but the difficulty level went higher than needed. \n\nEither way, I recommend giving them a try, even if it's just a trip to the bar.

We went during the first opening week for the tasting menu, and had a great time. To be honest the tasting menu, while conceptually interesting and encompassing a good variety of dishes, did not wow us and was probably not worth the $68.

It was really unique and flavorful, and both the noodles and broth were delicious! \nOn the other hand, the drinks did not disappoint! The white ale on draft was amazing and one of the best beers I've had (Tho I'm not a huge beer drinker) They also have a rotating selection of specialty brews and the Amber Ale was my bf's favorite among  those.

The interior and decor are nothing special, in fact it's rather generic. The value; well this is SF and you expect to pay up for a good dinner, but there's a difference between 'expensive' and 'overpriced'. Hitachino Beer & Wagyu is overpriced. It leaves you with that sick feeling of being ripped off. I've paid a lot more for dinners in this town but i've never walked away feeling like a sucker. The service; the only word that comes to mind is 'strange'. There's a pervasive pretentiousness that doesn't match the basic atmosphere and lackluster food. Lastly, the food itself; like another reviewer so aptly put it... meh. It's not good. It's average at best.

I'd like to come regularly to drink the beers; however, they are pricey by SF standards. \n\nTo the WAGYU TASTING. First off, it's not Japanese Wagyu, it's Washugyu. Washugyu is a cross breed between a Japanese and American cow. \n\nAlso, get the pairing. Beer and Sake (generous pours), it's why you're there. \n\nHighlights: \nBEEF TONGUE - Best tongue I've had since I can remember.

I was excited for the YAKINIKU course, but the piece I got was very chewy. \n\nService was great. Our 4th person was over 45 minutes late and our server never fret.

Not sure if it was an off night but I remember how hard it was to try to get into this place months ago so we were psyched to secure a spot. We were excited for the menu ... Who doesn't love beef and beer and we're talking the best of both! Neither disappointed... For beer, I stuck with my white ale while my husband enjoyed both the Dai Dai and the Classic since he's more of an IPA guy. I've always like Hitachino Nest white for its crisp slightly citrusy flavor.  I tried to focus on how the beer combined with the food but the first item that came out was the nigiri and DAMN! That just stood on its own! I forgot I had the beer right there as I just wanted to shove the 2nd of the 2 nigiri orders into my mouth ;-) A ka-pow of beefy goodness just made every one of my taste buds do the happy dance. We also split an order of the tongue (I thought this was good but slightly too \"tonguey\") and the bacon mochi. I am not that big of a mochi fan but I enjoyed how this was put together... Gooey mochi and crispy bacon.  Our final order was the 1lb ribeye steak over garlic rice. Wow!!! So much fatty goodness it was hard to stop but finally the arteries started signalling to go for the box after about 3/4ths of it. Probably could have polished it off if not for the appetizers. The rice is the perfect side for this steak, nicely soaked up all the flavors so not a drop was wasted. As mind-blowing as the food, drink and atmosphere of this restaurant were, I must admit we were somewhat disappointed by 3 things -- #1 We ordered the kobujime but the waiter completely forgot about it (not a big deal since it would have been too much already) #2 The tasting menu wasn't available that night (passable, we probably weren't going to go for it anyway) but #3 is IMHO inexcusable ... no dessert menu?!? I guess the dessert chef was out but it would have been nice to have been offered something sweet in the end... anything ... even an ounce of sweet sake to make up for the anti-climactic end of the meal.

I'm a big fan of the Hitachino Nest Red Rice Ale, so when I found out this place opened up, I was pretty interested. Overall impression is that it's a nice, hip spot, and if you're a fan of Hitachino Nest (or beef), you should check it out, and I'd be interested in seeing how the place evolves, but I'm not particularly raring to come back.\n\nWe did the tasting menu with some beers. The flight can be a decent introduction to Hitachino beers (or if you like the standard set); they also have some brews that are harder to find (like the sakura barrel-aged Red Rice Ale).\n\nImpressions of the dishes:\n-Otooshi (3 *): avocado puree. Not bad.\n-Tataki (4 *): pretty nice texture on the meat. Great eggplant vinaigrette. They offer a foie gras addition for $16; not really worth it in my opinion (just a slice of refrigerated foie gras added to the dish).\n-Kobujime (3.5 *): I liked this with the burrata, but others at the table found it a bit much. They offered a Hokkaido uni addition ($16); pretty decent quality.\n-Tongue skewer (4.5 *): Amazing texture; just a little bit salty.\n-Oden beef cheek (3.5 *): Just a little meh on the flavor. I can see why they chose to go with beer mustard, but I prefer the more traditional kind with this dish.\n-They ran out of yakiniku sushi (I think), so we got some beef in a soy-milk broth (3.5 *). Not bad, but again, a bit salty.\n-Tantanmen (4 *): I was surprised how good this was, with decent noodle texture. The broth isn't super stand-out, but a good finish to the meal.\n-Soy milk panna cotta + mandarin orange granita (3.5 *): Nice; not too sweet. A bit heavy on the granita.\n-Barley tea + brown butter cookie (3 *): barley tea is a nice touch, but this one wasn't the most flavorful; the cookie is utterly forgettable.\n\nMiscellaneous:\n-Total was about $450 for 4.\n-We had a reservation for 9:00, but didn't get seated until after 9:30; it's a small place, so you might expect these sorts of fluctuations in timing.\n-It seems that their menu can change during the night (the nigiri, and also I think our otooshi). This might be due to the aforementioned low n issue.\n\nI could see myself bumping this rating up on a return visit.", "author": "M N."}

We tried to order one of the japanese wagyu, but they were out of it??? At a wagyu restaurant with two steaks on the menu? \n\nA pound of US wagyu for $100 seemed crazy given the delicateness of the tasting menu + price + the fact that US wagyu pales next to something like A4 or A5. We passed.\n\nAbout half of the courses have wagyu in them, but there is so much going on that you miss out on the flavor profile of wagyu meat. The tongue and tantamen were both incredible.\n\nFor a Japanese wagyu restaurant in SF I fully expected A5 Kobe to be somewhere on the menu.

Staff was not informed to the level of telling me about the beef, what is different about it, etc.\n\nMy reference point: I love beer and have had lots of wagyu in Japan and have cooked A5 at home. \n\nSave some money and go find a butcher in SF who will sell you a US wagyu 1 lb ribeye for $40, and pick up a $5 hitachino white on the way home. Then go get some wagyu nigiri at Kinjo to see what wagyu really can taste like.", "author": "Scott N."}

Note, the staff was friendly and attentive, but not the best at describing the menu--we were confused.\n\nSummary: were excited about the opportunity to try Hitachino beer on tap and wagyu beef, but did not expect a difficult to discern, 8-course prix fixe menu that included only one dish containing a tooth-sized sliver of wagyu beef. So what does this mean? You must pay $106 for a 16oz Sonoma steak, or $160 for a 4oz cut of Hitachi wagyu on top of the $78 per person menu. The wait staff knows that there isn't enough food on the set menu to satisfy an adult, so they offer either uni or foie gras @ $32 per plate extra--so your choice is to either spend the extra $ or go home hungry after dropping $78 a head + drinks.\n\nIn hindsight, we should have walked out--like the table next to us did--but ended up staying (for over 3 hours!), biting the bullet, and ordering the 16oz Sonoma steak, which earned a solid 4.0. The eight-course menu of primarily bite-sized servings earned a 3.0, totaling 3.5. However, we both became ill when returning home, which only added injury to insult. \n\nIn short, there are far better options all around the City where the ownership shows appreciation for its customers. We will not be back.", "author": "P. C."}

The Wagyu isn't even from Japan.  I wish this restaurant and all of it's employees luck.  I don't think it will be around for long if they don't switch things up.  If you want Wagyu, head over to 5A5 or Alexander's.  If you want slivers of Wagyu from Wisconsin, this is your place.\n\nDespite what others might say, this is nowhere near Michelin level.", "author": "Rick N."}

Ok, lets be fair, I was excited when I heard they were opening a Hitachino joint and Wagyu as well? A must visit! They charge a premium price for premium beer, understandable, but the food leaves a truck load to be desired. Sorry, but I expect my wagyu to be served teppanyaki style, with a variety of different regions to choose from (Kobe is overrated trust me, and it isn't even the best. My friends from Japan tell me to try Akita or Matsusaka beef). Maybe consider serving what they serve at izakaya's in Japan? Yakitori? Robatayaki?", "author": "Panchali S."}

And helpful ...and we liked the folks at the bar, and we saw some cool food being consumed at the bar ... it started well.  When we got to the table we were told our only choice was the tasting menu, which we could supplement or add on to. Despite the fact that we repeatedly told our server that our one friend was very particular and would not eat half the tasting menu and that my husband only wanted his own steak, we were told we (the whole table) all must order the entire tasting menu. There was no other alternative.  So we did ..and my husband ordered the $95 steak ON TOP of it (which was so fatty that 10 out of the 16 ounces was unrendered  inedible fat. Our friend only ate 1/3 of the courses..... and at the end of the meal we heard from a different waiter that there was an A LA CARTE menu that was never offered to us ...which would have solved all of our problems...and we were PISSED!!! As foodies, as San Franciscans who dine out ..as customers...we were totally disrespected and taken advantage of...and sadly...we will NEVER eat here again.  Happy Anniversary & happy birthday to us... our gift was a kick in the teeth....Had they listened to us at all, and given us the option of  a la carte menu that we asked for repeatedly ... and not treated us so poorly ...we might have tried again..,, we remain really upset and deeply disappointed.  I actually feel defrauded...", "author": "Heather S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-03-11", "description": "Went for the soft opening, so I guess I should leave a review. A party of 4 went for the tasting menu ($68), each couple shared a beer and sake pairing ($30), which was two small pours of beer and one small pour of sake, plus your choice of full-size drink at the end, so not a bad deal, but not a different drink for each course like you might expect with other tasting menus.\n\n4 stars for the food. Highlights for me were the burrata, tongue, and tantanmen. Only one dish really missed, the oxtail soup, which was bland and under-seasoned.\n\n2 stars for the service. The weirdest thing that happened was during the dessert course, where I was excited to find lemon curd underneath the panna cotta. I pointed it out to the people I was eating with and they said \"What?\". They didn't have any (my wife may have had a small bit, but the others didn't). A waitress noticed us inspecting our desserts so asked if anything was missing, so we told her. She came back five minutes later and said that the chef admitted that he forgot to put the lemon curd in two of ours, but asked if we enjoyed it anyway (which we said yes, because we're polite, I guess). So we sat and finished our meal, expecting something to come out as an apology -- maybe a replacement dessert, or a comp or something else since we missed out on one of three ingredients in the dessert, but nothing happened. Kinda a bummer when you're spending $100/person to have the kitchen admit to a mistake and not try to make it right. Other weirdness can be chalked up to the soft opening, like the waitress not really being sure of what was in each dish when describing them, and the hostess completely ignoring us when we walked out (I said my traditional \"Thanks\" on the way out and was met with nothing, even though there were only about 8 people in the restaurant at that point).\n\nHopefully they can work out those kinks but food overall was pretty tasty.", "author": "Ned F."}

Don't take me wrong, i have tried many Michelin restaurant and am adventurous with food combo. But every disc we had here was like : it would have so much better without food xyz... also, there was no wagyu steak in the set Menu, just different part of the beef, but no steak in the traditional steakhouse grill way. All the beef parts we had was not impressive either. There are half of the dishes that made me feel: hey I can cook better than this !", "author": "Lily S."}

We were intrigued by the tasting menu and especially the dessert with Wagyu beef in it!! I'm happy to say that, even after reading some of these reviews, we had a fantastic time! All around everything from the service to the food was awesome. We didn't get to sit in the dining room because we didn't have a reservation so we had the a la carte menu, the tantanmen, Wagyu tongue skewers, and the Wagyu dessert, o the Wagyu dessert! Were definitely some of the highlights! Very happy and we will be back just for the dessert. Also on a side note, the beer of course is amazing but most people know Hitachino's beer reputation, but the bartender let us try some of the sakes on the house and even that was amazing! They have a sparkling sake on tap, and a brown sake that is made with brown rice, WOW! Will definitely get some sake next time around as well!", "author": "Kalvin M."}
