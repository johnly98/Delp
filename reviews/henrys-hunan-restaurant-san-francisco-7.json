I started going to this North Beach location after the Sansome St. restaurant closed down. I was very pleased to find out that the food here is just as good if not better than the old Sansome St. location! \n\nMy most recommended dishes:\n\n-Ma Po tofu: Spicy tofu with Henry's special meat sauce\n-Dianna's Special Meat Pie: Henry's special meat sauce and shredded lettuce between two fried pancake \"buns.\" I would suggest sharing this dish among 3+ people, as it is not as good leftover. \n-Smoked Ham and Green Beans\n-Hot and Sour soup: Excellent and spicy.\n\nMy only gripe with this place is that the parking is terrible. It's very hard to find an available street parking spot. While this location is temporarily closed, I would recommend trying the Noe Valley restaurant!", "author": "Haixing K."}

I first ate at the original location since 1974. I **love** their Diana's Meatpie. Sadly, today the meat was dry and crumbly, not savory and moist with drippings. The onion pancakes were soggy and not crunchy. It was so disheartening. This is one of their signature dishes. Something special that no one else offers and it was repugnant to me today. (It pains me to give them only a \"mercy rating\" of 2 stars when I think they should probably get only a single star.)\n\nThe dry, braised green beans were covered in a brown, gooey, tasteless mess. They weren't evenly cooked an not at all slightly crunchy. It was like eating something from a can. I can't understand what is going on here. The Sacramento Street location is still good. Alright, not as stupendous as they were in the past. But they at least make a bit of the wonderful food this restaurant chain was revered for in the past.\n\nNo crispy pieces of rice in the chicken fried rice. No texture, just gummy rice. I could go on, but it's almost too depressing.\n\nEven their own web page doesn't mention that the Sansome location is no longer in operation. They could try to keep things up to date. It is just another detail that seems to have gone by the wayside.\n\nOverall it was a very disappointing luncheon. Made even worse by all the hype I gave my friend over what a great dining experience I'd enjoyed there decade after decade after decade. I'm sooooo sad . . . \n\nDid they not train the cooks at this location to prepare things the way they do elsewhere? I have a copy of their cookbook and will gladly send them a photocopied one for their reference.", "author": "Bruce S."}

Great balance of savory with heat and spice. Really enjoyed the combination of ingridients in Henry's Special. The shrimp, scallop, chicken, and crisp veggies come together really well and the hot and spicy bean sauce brings the dish together. Love the richness that the fermented beans bring. The Mongolian beef is really tender and flavorful too. Perhaps a tad oily but nothing unbearable.

That was a long time ago, and I had wanted to try Henry's because of that....but my report is that this is not a very good restaurant. 4 stars on Yelp? Palease. Well, the interior is nice and the menu is presentable. It all looks good on paper, but it looks and tastes like stir-fried cabbage and meat bits. Is every single dish stir-fried with greasy oil? I think so. The dishes have large servings, but it is quality not quantity after all. I know that this is not where Hong Kong people go out to eat Chinese. I must have suckered myself into thinking I'd like mushu pork pancakes. HAHA. Henry's Hunan in San Francisco. I do not feel the need to try it ever again.

The flavors from the wok, the seasonings, and the meats were divine.  After they closed we have tried the fried rice at many places but none have been as good.  Seeing as Chef Jia's was a Hunan restaurant I had high hopes for Henry's Hunan.\n\nCombo fried rice with smoked ham, chicken, beef, and shrimp.  While the chicken & beef didn't have too much flavor the smoked ham had a complex smoky and savory flavor.  Shrimp was good but there were not very many of them and they were tiny.  The rice and egg didn't have too much flavor either.

And the best part is they make their own chili oil which is phenomenal with the dumplings. (I tend to rate Chinese restaurants based on their homemade chili oil haha). Highly recommend this dish!\n\nFor entrees we shared Henry's Special and the Chicken Fried Rice and they were solid! Henry's Special comes with hunan chicken, shrimp, scallops, carrots, and oyster mushrooms in a flavorful and mildly spicy sauce. I was pleased that the scallops were cooked well and not overdone which is an easy thing to get wrong. The fried rice was excellent!

Our visit left a lot to be desired for me. \n\nAmbiance - Walked in at 7:30pm on a Saturday night...the restaurant was empty minus one couple. Pretty surprising given its prime location in North Beach. The restaurant has relatively chic furniture/decor for a no-frills Chinese restaurant. Clean. Casual. Had the Warriors game on a large LCD. Seems to cater to mainly non-Asian clientele.\n\nService - Typical Chinese restaurant service. They take your order quickly after sitting down and are prompt bringing food out, but good luck trying to get their attention other than to take your order and bring your bill. \n\nFood - We ordered the onion pancake, dumplings, sweet and sour soup, kung pao chicken, spicy & hot rock cod fillets, and spicy eggplant with meat sauce. Mostly, everything was just OK. The onion pancake was very different from the scallion pancakes I'm familiar with - it was crispy and flaky. The eggplant was visually unappetizing and lacked unique favoring. Everything else was unmemorable.\n\nPricing is decent given its location and ambiance.

About a minute later I hear my sister arguing with the staff. When she comes back to the table she informs our group that they charged the tax twice, as well as charge an additional $10 for a dishwasher tax (wtf). Basically a bill that should have been around 50, turned into 70 for no reason. Oh also that brown rice we never received? It was kept on the bill and we were told that it was just added to the white rice we had ordered. By this point we were just done and decided to leave after practically forcing the bill down. \n\nI guess the thing to take from this review is that if you decide to go here, expect to be swindled on the bill. Make sure you get what you order and check the bill before paying.", "author": "Alex M."}

The food is super authentic and delicious, and the prices are totally reasonable! We went specifically for the meat pie because we heard it was one of a kind. It's worth making a trip over there JUST for the meat pie. The only way to explain is it like a Chinese tostada. We also ordered the Mo Si soup (perfect portion for three people), the pork fried rice with an egg (my favorite dish of the night), the Kung Pao shredded pork, and the dry-sauteed string beans. The only mediocre item was the string beans and only because they weren't cooked long enough. The beers are only 3.50 and you get hot tie right when you sit down. \n\nThe only reason this place gets four stars instead of five is because of the service. It was some of the slowest service I've experienced in a very long time, and the place was not that crowded. Not only did the food come out item by item (with 5-10 minutes in between), but when we would ask for something (like a glass of water or soy sauce) our server would forget and we'd have to remind him once or twice more.

We wanted some great Chinese food, so we looked on yelp and found this place. \n\nParking: On the street where you have to pay meters\nLocation: In a cute neighborhood where some of the MUNI transit trains run\n\nOnce my boyfriend and I walked into the restaurant, we were greeted right away. We got to choose our seating. We sat in a booth where there were pillows. It was a little dimmed in the restaurant, and the booth was extremely comfortable. First thing we noticed about the menu was that the prices weren't bad at all, and the restaurant gave you  good amount off food. \n\nWe ordered dumplings (Filled with pork and vegetables. He preferred them spicy), beef with broccoli, shrimp fried rice, and chicken chow mein. All the food was amazing. The only things I did not like was that they didn't give us too much beef with broccoli, and the chicken chow mein was a bit salty to my boyfriend and I. Besides those two things, all the food came out hot and very quickly. My boyfriend and I were extremely satisfied and full. It had been a while since him and I ate great Chinese food, so we are pleased to put this restaurant down as one of the good places to grab food from. \n\nThe service: There seemed to be one girl mainly serving everyone. She was a bit inattentive. She didn't notice I even needed water until I was fully done with my meal. Also, my boyfriend and I couldn't flag her down for some sweet and sour sauce, so we ended up disturbing another waiter. \n\nConcluding, the food was pretty good besides the chow mein being a little bit salty. The meal portions were pretty good for the price you pay. It was the right amount of portions for my boyfriend and I that is. Not sure if their portions would be big enough for a group of 4 or so depending on how many orders you get. We got 4 different ones.

Finally a young girl came over and dropped of some water.  I will tell you, drink it slowly... You aren't likely to ever see more. They found out there was a large party coming in, and we were no longer thought about.  We were just furniture at that point. There was an older lady who FINALLY came over to take or order after we worked to get her attention.  She was about as friendly and helpful as one of the tables.  She said little, and smiled less (than the table).  We certainly seemed major bother to her for daring to come to the restaurant.  She did manage to take our order, despite her lack of helpfulness or conversation. The soup and food showed up all at once. So much for pacing.  We asked the young girl for two forks since my wife and son aren't good at chopsticks.  She thought I wanted cokes.  I repeated..no.. forks... f... forks. She nodded and repeated forks.  She showed up several minutes later with forks...and cokes.  We ate the rest of the meal never having anyone come to see us.  Good thing the cokes came out accidently...

We had the Hot and Sour Soup, Dry Sauteed Green Beans, Kung Pao Chicken, and Henry's Special (chicken, shrimp, and scallops). All amazing. Zero Complaints. Green beans still tasted fresh yet wok charred, the proteins were all cooked perfectly, and the veggies still crisp. Nice sticky white rice to support the dishes. Warning, if you order the soup, be prepared for about 8 bowls worth of soup to come out!\n\nThis is not run of the mill Chinese food.

We were both excited to have Chinese food and we were seated and our order taken promptly. \n\nMy partner ordered the chicken and string beans, a standard dish that's one of his favourites, and a good way of comparing some of our other preferred Chinese restaurants to here. I picked out the hot and sour vegetables and we also ordered a plate of white rice, plus a glass of wine and a beer. We didn't have to wait too long before our meal came out (although separately, with about 2 minutes between each plate but whatever). \n\nI was a bit surprised that the hot and sour vegetables came in a pale sauce, I was expecting something reddish or orange at least but no matter, I piled rice on my plate and a few spoonfuls of veggies and dove in. The heat of this dish was intense, far spicier than I'm used to, but the sweetness of the bamboo shoots and the glass of wine plus the plainness of the rice helped dull it a bit. It was delicious and I ate about half easily. The rest I took home for later since it was that good, I didn't want to let it go to waste.\n\nMy partner noticed the chicken and string beans came with a chili black bean sauce, one of his favourite sauces. He thought his dish was amazing and ate every last bit of it.\n\nService was a tad slow but there seemed to be a large family gathering in the central table, we're talking 20+ people, so I can forgive them for it. Because of the layout of the restaurant, the noise of the large party was practically deafening, so be warned that this place can get pretty loud if there's a lot of people in it. Overall though, we'd happily return here, there were quite a few things on the menu that looked delicious and I would love to try more.", "author": "Cassandra J."}

Dumplings came out first and they were ok- not much flavor. I put the table side chili oil on them and their was no spice to the oil whatsoever. My asian friend said it's because the oil was mixed with bean curd? Entrees come out and everything is salty.

I did some research this time, no shooting from the hip rash decision making without thought. I looked upon Yelp to show me some good Chinese. After looking through many reviews, I came upon Henry's Hunan. It's a hole in the wall Chinese place in between the financial district and Chinatown, a stone's throw away. \n\nThe place looked kind of dirty as I've expected Chinese restaurants to be. Chinese places aren't known for aesthetics, if you want ambience, you go to PF Chang's. I look around, just a bunch of low-end office worker types. This was a mission to find some decent, good, cheap Chinese. And I thought this was the place. \n\nI sat down and saw about 10 cooks in the kitchen all yelling and getting loud. So far so good. Then I ordered from the menu. I carefully decided upon a beef and green bean lunch. After about 3 minutes, my lunch came to my table. It wasn't beef. It was chicken. I guess I must look stupid to these guys. Or maybe they're just stupid? Ok, didn't want to push the issue because I know how these folks can get. So I decide to take a leap of faith and try their chicken and green bean lunch. \n\nFolks, I can't stress upon this any further. DO NOT COME HERE. The food was so terrible. It was just downright inedible. So awful. It was a misadventure into the worst tasting Chinese food ever. With 10 cooks in the kitchen, not one of these mothers know how to cook a meal. I can't say anything good about the place. It's just horrible. The owner of the restaurant was yelling at this young Chinese girl who really looked lost. She could likely be someone in indentured servitude that you always hear about but never act upon because you think, no, not here, not in America. \n\nIF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE, DO NOT EAT HERE. The food is tasteless, mushy, nasty and just downright crap. Even the rice was crappy. I mean seriously? Chinese people not able to do rice right? How do you screw up rice? That's like French not able to bake a good loaf of bread. Really sad. This has to be the WORST CHINESE restaurant in the City.

The beef and broccoli was cooked to perfection. The sweet-and-sour pork was excellent, as was the chow mein.", "author": "Josh H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-14", "description": "Here are my \"bona fides\":   I have been a fan of Henry Chung's Hunan restaurants since 1979 when I first moved to the Bay Area and I used to go to his original little place on Kearny Street (man, I miss that place).  I've eaten a million times at the big place on Sansome over the years, which is good, but not Kearny Street good.  I've also eaten at virtually every Hunan restaurant from SF to SJC.  I dined at the new Henry's Hunan on Grant Street for the first time last night.  I give it 9.7 Kearnys out of 10!  I'm honestly not sure if it really deserves to fall short of a full 10 Kearny rating.  It may just be that nothing will ever be able to match my memory of the Kearny location.   You're probably getting the idea that I liked it.  Not only was the food the best Hunan cuisine I've had in a long time (and compared with some pretty fine food at other places), but the restaurant is really nicely appointed, and located on a really cute little section of Grant Ave.  It is North Beach, not Chinatown, but if you are looking for a fun place to walk around before and after dinner - or a real authentic old San Francisco atmosphere for your tourist friends, take them here.  It is, of course, spicy.  But we asked them for 'medium hot' because one of our party was not into ring stingers, and they hit perfectly.  Go.  Go now.  This is my new favorite Chinese restaurant.\n\nUpdate upon latest visit: ..and this is mostly in hope that the restaurant will read it.  Two things:  First Hunan Smoked Ham might be my favorite food in the whole world.  I have it at every Hunan restaurant I visit.  I've made it myself from the recipe of Henry Chung himself.  I'm actually eating it right now as I write this - take out from a little place in San Jose (8.8 Kearneys), but I digress.  Second I love salty food.  I salt food that other people think is too salty.  I love me some salt.  But, on my last visit, the Hunan Smoked Ham was INSANELY salty.   Not so salty that I couldn't eat it, but nobody else at the table could, and I didn't enjoy it. Seriously, you need to find a way to cut down on the saltiness because it was nearly inedible the last time.  Maybe it was just a bad night, and i'll try it again, but it would be a deal breaker for me if it is always that way.  Everything else was delicious.", "author": "Vernon M."}

The cold noodles were good but I found the peanut sauce to be a little too overwhelming (i.e. there was too much of it).  We also got a spicy tofu dish that I.  could.  not.  handle.  So spicy.

It wasn't too busy so we were able to get seated right away. While they do have lunch specials on the menu, there was not a lot of options to choose from so I decided to just get a regular dish. I ordered the spicy eggplant with meat sauce and an order of brown rice. Our server asked how spicy I wanted, which is always nice and I said mild. After everyone ordered, we all got complimentary hot and sour soup! =) I'm usually not a big fan of this type of soup but it was surprisingly pretty tasty and not overly spicy like some can be. Food arrived fairly quickly and everyone's dish was pretty big, including my eggplant dish! Our white and brown rice came in 2 big bowls for everyone to share. The eggplant was really good!! It was perfectly spiced and seasoned, and the sauce it came with was pretty yummy. It paired really well with the brown rice. By the end of our lunch, we were all so stuffed and almost all of us had to doggy bag our leftovers back to the office! For the price, portions, and quality of the food here, I would definitely  recommend this place to anyone who is craving some good Chinese food! =)", "author": "Mary C."}
