The food is incredibly fresh and unique (for as unique as a burger place can be). They have two types of sauce that you can choose from; Shack Sauce which is a mixture of ketchup, mustard and mayo; and an aioli with garlic (I believe...?). Onions and pickles are upon request, and upgrades are $0.50-$1.00 each (avo, grilled onions, etc.). The burgers and chicken were both cooked to perfect - hot, moist and tender. The bun appears on the big side, but is not doughy or too chewy and is a great match for the insides. The fries are also my favorite type: the standard 1/4 inch thick cut crisp and golden. So many places fall short on fresh and crispy fries that Burger Shack should get some extra points for the quality here. \n\nThere is limited seating, but I have not had any issue finding a seat. The staff are warm and friendly, and geared toward providing excellent service. The food arrives quick too, especially considering it is not started until ordered. The right side of the restaurant features a full bar and few taps with standard beer options. I will likely pop in before I head home from work in the near future. \n\nAll in all, this is all one can ask for in a a local burger spot. Excellent food, service, clean atmosphere and decent prices! Burgers range about $8-10 after tax. I hear they are new to the area, so I hope they continue to get more business. They are a great addition to the neighborhood.", "author": "Neville V."}

It isn't steamed or grilled like other places. Instead it's deep-fried in the same oil as the fried chicken! It's extra crispy on the outside, dry on the inside, and tastes like chicken grease throughout.\n\nNot only was the burger overcooked, the curly fries were undercooked. One of the fries was even still raw on the inside. When I returned the food the staff first suggested I take it home and cook it more, then proceeded to tell me I was wrong and that it was supposed to be line that. I was excited after seeing several positive reviews, but I won't ever be coming back. Oh well.\n\nEdit: Second star for partial refund.", "author": "Nick W."}

Yelp sent me up Bay Street and right to Burger Shack.  So happy I came!\n\nI walked in around 2pm and was the only customer, but within 20 minutes it was packed and the flavors are why.  I ordered their 1/2 lb burger ($8.75), and side of french fries ($3).  What'd I think?\n\nThe 1/2 lb burger came with two patties lettuce, tomato and house mayo.  I also added cheddar cheese ($1) and there's ketchup and mustard pumps if you're not done with condiments.\n\nThis burger was a mouthfull, was cooked to order, and filled me up.  Admittedly, the patties themselves were not seasoned, but I enjoyed this burger.\n\nThe french fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and these were nicely seasoned.  I'd order both again.\n\nCustomer service was nice, quick, and stopped by to check on me from time to time.  Interior was clean and while there is a bar, I will say there aren't a large amount of tables.

I saw very positive reviews on Yelp about their burger and I can confirm it doesn't disappoint. I ordered the 1/4th lb Shack Burger with Swiss cheese and curly fries.\n\nShack burger: A+\nThe keys to a good burger are the thickness of the patty and texture of the bun. Burger shack does these two keys justice! The burger is thinly pounded and the bread is very soft like a brioche bun. In terms of taste, the burger has an outstanding umami flavor especially with the cheese. It's very easy to bite into and doesn't fall apart. I'd recommend getting the 1/2lb burger if you really like meat. The shack sauce is comparable to in&out sauce and adds a nice flavor compared to just mayo.\n\nCurly fries: B\nNot the greatest curly fries ever but they still taste good and are a bit crispy. They give a decent amount too. Fries are not included with the burger so it's $3-4 as a side.\n\nService was mediocre, the lady seemed to be working double duty as she was busy dealing with orders, making milkshakes, and sorting out Togo orders. Food came out very quick though and the prices aren't too bad for a really delicious burger.

The burger looked like something out of a magazine. It wasn't falling all over the place and sloppy. It had a tooth pick holding it together in one place. The fries were fries, they came hot, not salted, but they were fine. I think they could scale back on their pricing being that they are new to the neighborhood and need to fill the seats.

They were very nice to ask one customer sitting by himself at a table of 6 to move to a single seat table  so our family of 8 can seat there.

I'm normally not a fan of any of those sauces but love 'thousand island' on a burger. This was very similar and worked great on the burger. I wasn't asked how I wanted the burger cooked but it was a perfect medium and tasted quite delicious.

It's really a let down to all fried chicken sandwiches. It tastes like a McChicken. It's really underwhelming in terms of presentation and taste.

As she delivered the next order (also ordered after me), she did say it would be out soon.

A honest, clean, friendly place with good prices and the buger was spot on. The two things that make a good burger/sandwich is the meat and the bun/bread.

They cook the burgers on a flat top, not a grill. I'm a flat top man because of the great caramelization you get that way. Bonus points. I got the 1/2 pound burger, which was a bit of a mistake because it was HUGE. And delicious. But, it showed me how they assemble. \n\nThe 1/2 pounder is actually 2 1/4 pounders. If you get cheese and bacon like me, they spread it around. Each patty was topped with cheese and bacon and then stacked. Decadent, to say the least. Well seasoned, too. Hate it when places don't salt the meat since ground beef on its own is bland. Finally the bun - it wasn't an off-the-shelf hamburger bun but had a little more density to it that I really liked and helped it hold up to a juicy burger without getting soggy. \n\nOh, and the \"Shack Sauce\" is a mustard, mayo, ketchup and spices blend. I liked it (I do something similar at home) The fries were crisp and fresh and not oily so you know the frying oil is fresh too.\n\nI'll definitely be going back! Enjoy!", "author": "Chris R."}

A 1/2-lb Shack Burger is $8.75. It has two 1/4-lb seasoned patties, lettuce, tomato, and grilled buns. Add a two slices of cheese for .75 and perfectly crisp slices of bacon for another $1.50. Get your fingers ready for a dirty, delicious onslaught because you're going to need loads of napkins. This place is shining bright after its dirty predecessor went down. The clean tables, kitschy designs, and makeshift bar remind me of Daly City restaurants, but the price point hurts a little more. Garlic fries set you back $4, and at first, you'll think it's weird to have shredded cheese on top of fries with garlic sauce, but it just works. Add a fountain drink for $2.25, and you have a whole meal. Word hasn't gotten out yet that this burger is killer, so come while there are no lines. I just wish the prices were a little lower. For a burger that pricey, I would expect to at least have fries come with it, but it's still a damn good conglomeration of patties and buns.", "author": "Danny C."}

Assuming you're coming from the touristy pier area, the walk down bay street alone is a great way to get away from the busy noise by the water. The burger quality is a great quality, and will fill you up with a quarter burger. I got the 1/2 pound, not realizing it's a double patty, but it was a great mistake to make. The only issue was that the burger began to fall apart in my hands, so if you have smaller hands just be aware. The garlic fries were amazing because they actually have an even coating of garlic taste. Many \"garlic\" fries lose the taste when you run out of the fresh garlic topping, but they remain tasty throughout. Rounding out the meal were the onion rings. The taste reminded me of burger King onion rings, which I enjoy, but they can feel a bit bready.

Burger needed some more flavor/sauce, but good beef, well-cooked, with fresh toppings. Can't wait to try a Twinkie shake sometime soon. Will definitely be my go to burger joint in the wharf.", "author": "David O."}

My family ordered two 1/4 shack burgers, one 1/2 shack burger, onion rings, curly fries, and an oreo milkshake. We all added grilled mushrooms to our burgers as well. The patty itself is soft, juicy, and lightly seasoned (a plus because you won't be thirsty hours later!). The special \"shack sauce\" was slightly tangy and mayo-based. The onion rings were sweet, not oily, and the batter was sinfully crispy. The curly fries were also not oily and not over-seasoned. Lastly, the oreo milkshake was heavenly and the perfect treat to conclude our dinner.  As a San Francisco native, I hope that this family run restaurant succeeds because it is a great addition to the neighborhood.", "author": "Alyson S."}

If you're looking for a great burger place that feels comfortable and welcoming, we definitely recommend going here!", "author": "S D."}

I've been looking for a good burger place for the past 3 years in the area, and this place is pretty good.  The bread is a little thick which takes away some of the tasty favors of the burger meat, I prefer the sesame buns that super duper uses that makes a burger really tasty, but overall still a good tasty burger.  I would definitely recommend and eat here again.", "author": "T W."}

Great place to grab a bit at 9:45 pm or so any day of the week (not sure what time the kitchen closes, but I haven't hit that time yet)!\n\nThe kitchen is insanely clean and everyone is very nice.\n\nThere is a section that's the full bar, if you want beer, wine, or whatever... I stick to the same beer each time.\n\n1/4 burger with normal spread, plus grilled onions, extra pickles, fried egg, bacon, and cheddar all on a brioche bun = = so much happiness!", "author": "C B."}

This location was previously a Chinese restaurant, which didn't have good Chinese food, but now the burgers and other items are great. I ordered a turkey burger, husband had a half a pounder with bacon, cheese and grilled onions, my son had fish and chips. We also split a thick strawberry milk shake. Everything was well made, fresh. The decor inside was clean and bright. There is a bar area, which doesn't seem ready yet, but may be fun later paired with the big screen TV. The price was a bit high though...especially if you add additional toppings to the burger, the cost quickly adds up. Overall we will definitely be back.", "author": "Lesty L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-10-23", "description": "My friend and I both enjoyed the double stack w/ shack sauce. They go for $8.75 but you need to pay more for each topping (bacon, grilled onions, cheese, etc). A very, very juicy, tasty burger on a solid bun that doesn't fall apart. Curly fries were average. Service was prompt (order at counter, they bring to table) and friendly. Food is a bit pricey but an above average burger so I didn't mind.", "author": "Foodie S."}

It has a greasy vibe but with an elevated bite. I hope this place makes it as the neighborhood needs something like this space! We haven't expanded much beyond the burgers and fries. Hopefully they get on a delivery service soon to help keep them going! They have a bar in there too, selling beer.  Burgers are moist and juicy, veggies are fresh and cheese and bun are tasty.", "author": "Traci H."}
