It's cash only and from my experience these are the places in San Francisco that know they are not losing business by being so. \n\nThey're recently remodeled! There's now bright yellow walls and colorful traditional flags lining the ceiling. There's a couple communal tables that would comfortably seat six, a couple booths, and some two-seaters. A clean, and fun face-lift T. Cancun!!! \n\nI'm ALWAYS blown away at how scrumptious the food is. This past time I got a chicken taco, which was juicy and delicious. But previously I've gotten the shrimp burrito special, and a classic carne asada burrito. All of which made me forget about how frustrating it was to scramble cash bills. This is a Mission staple and I will one hundred percent be returning.", "author": "Navila H."}

I had a super chicken burrito. My Cousin had the carnitas and my daughter had a cheese quesadilla.  Not going to lie... Anna's Taqueria in Boston has this place beat for flavor but this burrito is a little bigger.  It needed more flavor but kudos on the real deal cheese here.  My daughters quesadilla had so much cheese if she had eaten it she would have been backed up for days!  A little much.  It was ok but did not knock my socks off.

There was a bit of a line, but it went by relatively quickly. The cashier was a young guy who seemed indifferent about the line but moved fast enough for me. We had:\n\n-- Vegetarian Burrito (minus cheese and sour cream) // Ok I know this may sound basic since this was essentially just beans, rice, pico de gallo and avocado wrapped in a tortilla but thaT'S WHY IT WAS SO GOOD. (Another disclaimer: I was also low-key buzzed and starving at the time of this meal), but regardless! Everything inside was perfectly executed and the salsas provided alongside the basket of chips were clearly homemade, beautifully balanced, spicy and a great addition to the burrito. I don't think y'all fully understand the value and difficulty level of making homemade salsa that white and Latinx people alike will enjoy. But I digress. \n\nServers were busy since there were quite a few people hungry for burritos and tacos. Still, they handled it all gracefully and refilled our salsas with no complaints when we asked, regardless of having multiple orders in hand at the time. \n\nI might just make this my new go-to late night spot regardless of it being a bit out of the way on my way home - the atmosphere is just what you would expect from a taqueria and in that sense, it feels like home to me.", "author": "Alex K."}

For $6.00, I get the grilled steak with rice, beans, salsa, avocado, sour cream, Mexican cheese, chopped onions and cilantro in a large flour tortilla. All the key interior ingredients were fresh and tasty and the grilled meat was grilled very nicely. But the cook burnt my tortilla while cooking it on the grill. I don't mind the tortilla being a little burnt, but it was overly scorched (see my picture and would you eat that?).\n\nI've been eating here about forty times, but never had any problems here until today.

I get cold sweats thinking about how I ate there once and had a derelict yelling at me for not giving him some change. It was not a dining experience I ever wanted to repeat, and I sprint just a little faster every time I pass by it on the way home. \n\nSo it was with trepidation that I suggested to Jamie W. that we go to the one in the Outer Mission after noticing that El Zocalo was closed (yet again!) Wow, what a difference a neighborhood makes...so bright, open and colorful with a conscientious server and lots of seating. The menu is full of bargain-priced food, enough to thrill a truckload of illegal migrant workers... IMMIGRACION!... IMMIGRACION!!\n\nOr even an overweight Asian-American looking for a cheap meal. But is the food better than my memory of their sister operation? Oh yes. I ordered the $4.99 Carnitas Torta, melty goodness in a French roll with plenty of pork, cheese, refried beans, and avocado along with tomato, onion and sour cream (see photo). Because it was cheap (a bad excuse), I also ordered a simple $2.99 Quesadilla that used the same cheesy goodness (see photo). Delicious.\n\nJamie ordered the hefty $7.99 Super Nachos platter, an extravaganza of corn chips, melted cheese, refried beans, sour cream, guacamole and salsa with chunks of al pastor (marinated pork) and slices of avocado and jalapeno on top (see photo). Like I said, hefty... and awfully good. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...really good Mexican on the cheap \nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...Surprise!... clean and spacious, especially on a weekday night \nSERVICE - 4 stars...certainly fast enough for my considerable appetite \nTOTAL - 4 stars...OK, the good sister lives in the Outer Mission and her evil twin lives off Sixth...got it?", "author": "Ed U."}

That's just it though...they're good, not great. \n\nI've had a couple other dishes, like tacos and super quesadillas but my go-to order is always a burrito. A vegetarian burrito runs about $6 here and gets you a HUGE burrito filled with rice, pinto beans, cheese, tomato, onion, cilantro and avocado. I can never finish the whole thing in one sitting, so their burritos are perfect for leftovers since they're so big! \n\nAlso, their chips aren't my favorite and I feel like they're kinda stale. They give you two different kinds of salsa - pico de gallo and salsa verde. Salsa verde is pretty spicy but definitely my favorite out of the two.\n\nWith so many other taquerias in the Mission, Taqueria Cancun isn't my go-to place for a burrito but it's still a good choice if you're in Bernal Heights.\n\n*Cash ONLY!*", "author": "Stephanie C."}

(I know, I know, like being an agnostic in the Bible Belt.) It's just...why do I need soooo much relatively flavorless rice and tortilla and cheese and sour cream? Why not skip the fillers, stick to the good parts, and just order tacos?\n\nThen I moved a few blocks away from Taqueria Cancun, and finally understood the purpose of the burrito. What made the difference? Largely the big chunks of fresh avocado where most places use guacamole, but the fresh-griddled tortilla and restrained hand with the sour cream and cheese don't hurt either. \n\nI personally think the beef and the chorizo are the best meat choices, but the al pastor was the only option I've tried that genuinely disappointed.", "author": "Amy L."}

I went with the super which gives you all the fixings including avocado , and well... it just wasn't that good.

It was also lacking in terms of guacamole spread and salsa in my torta. The meat itself wasn't as juicy and tender as I had hoped, but was sufficient.

After pushing the taco to the side, I started on the Burrito. I couldn't find any meat in my burrito, until I was about half way down. Where's the meat?!?  Where's the flavor? Where's the Salsa?\n\nI concur with Tom R. and agree that there are a lot of other places in the Mission that are way better.", "author": "Robin K."}

Then a group of young Mexican guys all leaned on my car or looked like they were about to, because they were drunk or just losers.  This car is black and brand new and the last thing in the world I need is some losers leaning on my car.  So I hopped back into my car and took off because it's not worth it to me.  Sure, I get a cheap taco, but the cost of the damage to the car is much more.  Paint costs a lot.\n\nAnyways, the food is always good and cheap.  Not too long ago (a few months) there was a viscous stabbing there.  A woman stabbed a man because she didn't like what he said.  Not exactly a safe area you know?  \n\nSo tonight I went to the Lexington and afterwards i told my friend let's go to El Farolito.  She wanted to eat before driving, which is a good idea.  So we went to Cancun.  I have ate there a lot in my life...because I am poor and I love Mexican food.  The veggie torta I had tonight was delicious, but not nearly as good as El Farolito.  \n\nCancun always has friendly and efficient employees.  Must be a hard place to work at.  those employees deserve purple stars.  The place needs a security guard like they have at El Farolito and so many other late night restauarnats.\n\nIn a nutshell.......great prices, fast service, yummy food, dangerous area.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-12", "description": "just stumbled in on a late Wednesday night, happy anything was open, scanned the menu with my friend Alexx, turned to him and decisively said, \"how bout we get the super nachos to split.\"  With meat?  yeah, with chorizo!  I know this seems like a bad idea at first, a misstep on an otherwise pleasant, lightly intoxicated Wednesday, but it just seemed like the right idea at the time.  One of those instances where at least 85% percent of the time its the wrong idea, but this time, well just this time it worked out; like instead of, \"oh that night was just going swimmingly until we ordered fricking chorizo on the super nachos.\"\n\nWhat's great about super nachos is that it takes like all the supporting characters from Mexican food  and makes a fairly solid stand alone meal out of it.  Like typically if you tried this in any other genre of food, it would fail miserably; like oh, I'll take hamburger meat, pickles, onions and tomato and put on a tray, bake it, slap some ketchup....you get the idea, like a clown in the kitchen basically.  And yeah, nachos are kind of like low-brow bachelor food, but that's only if you make it at home in your microwave, where as when you order it from a taqueria/restaurant it takes on a much classier appeal.  The kind of classy that only a taqueria on mission street that's open until 3am can provide.\n\nA few caveats about ordering the super nachos with chorizo after midnight on a weekday (a weekend you have plenty of time to recover).  One:  Ask for the sour cream on the side.  Don't get overconfident.  You know that sour cream can do damage at that hour, but what is worst, is that when they smother the nachos in it, it not only turns a layered platter of beauty into a soggy, sloppy mess, it always (at least for me) makes me kind of feel depressed after eating them.  I can't really explain why (in this forum), but it has something to do with regret, gluttony, and disillusionment.\n\nThe second caveat is:  don't be foolish and try eating this by yourself (again with the overconfidence), or don't try splitting it with someone who pecks at food like a bird or who's too interested in talking about themselves and loses sight of what is most immediate and important, which is tearing through some kick-ass super nachos.......I mean c'mon people, you gotta live!  You could split this three ways and it would still carry its weight.   Godammit, I just made myself hungry.", "author": "James W."}

On the fence between a Salvadoran pupuseria  or tradtional Mexican fare, we walked past Can-Cun.

The server brought them out after a short wait, and handed each to the wrong person. I bit into the carnitas and was like \"wow\" this is great. Veggie bit into my prawn, and my man bit into the veggie and exclaimed how good it was (and he is NOT a vegetarian). I knew mine was not prawn, but I was almost not going to hand it over it was so good. The seasoning was yum, if not a tad too salty, but calmed down by the sour cream (and the Mexican Coca-Cola). When we finally sorted it out, I enjoyed my prawn burrito, though I wished the seasoning on the shrimp was just a notch more like the carnitas. I tasted my pal's veggie burrito and it was quite hearty and tasty.  All of our burritos had been toasted on the grill before and serving, so they had a nice hot toasty taste.\n\nWhile I am sure there are equal or better places in the area, this was good inexpensive and fresh tasting. \n\nChips are salty and clearly not home made.

They do happen to have a really good horchata probably the 2nd best int he city behind the El Farolito in the Excelsior.

I wasn't all that hungry nor in a mood to spend money, so although I wanted to try the burrito, I settled for a cheese quesadilla with avocado instead (it came out to $4.07 - not a terrible price). They gave me some chips which were pretty average then, pretty quickly, my quesadilla came out. Up until this point I was a fan. But after I first bit into the quesadilla, I began noticing little bits of beef throughout (and trust me, it was definitely beef), hidden between the tortilla's layers. It probably wasn't intentional, but as a place that claims to have the best vegetarian burrito, I was sorely disappointed.

When my husband and I used to live south of Market we would frequent the Market location, but we would never actually eat there. I much prefer the bernal heights/mission location. There isn't that fear of a crack addict coughing on your food while you go  to enjoy your first bite or the fear of wearing open toed shoes because of the used needle littered streets just around the corner on 6th street. This is a much calmer environment. I enjoy the whole chunks of avocado in the burritos and the flavors  are just right. \n   The last time I was there the taco jockey went hefty on the cheese and the meat. How can anyone not dig those perks? ( apologies to the vegans of the world, you suffer enough without it being rubbed it your face) On the subject of meat I do find it a bit disappointing that they do not have carnitas. That's like a cat without fur, sure it is still a cat but who wants to cuddle it? It's missing something. The chips are also my other complaint. Invest in a fryer, that's all I have to say. \n     On a good note though, they make tasty horchata and salsa, and the tortas are pretty kick awesome as my brother would say. Overall the people are always friendly, the food is  always tasty, and the price is right!", "author": "Esa Y."}

We probably eat here approximately twice a week.  Personally, my very favorite place for carne asada burritos remains La Taqueria.  But that's a 15 minute walk and this is 5 minutes.  And aside from LT's carne asada burrito, this Mission St. location of Taqueria Cancun gets my vote for everything else.  The al pastor burrito or quesadilla is to die for, and I usually do as I end up overeating.  The sauce is just delicious.  My son could literally eat their bean/cheese/avocado burrito three times a day if we would let him.  Hidden gem on the menu - the tostada de ceviche.  Super cheap and tasty.

I asked the nice guy working behind the counter what he recommended:  \"I like the chicken\".  Can't argue with that.  I ordered a super chicken burrito.  I really liked the two salsas that came with it, especially the creamy green one.  The chips WERE stale as many other yelpers have noted.  The burrito was good.  Loved the pieces of avocado, the beans, rice, cilantro parts.  The chicken was just okay.  The flavor was good but some of the pieces were the bad rubbery/chunky parts that shouldn't have made it into the burrito (only a couple).\n\nAll in all, a pretty good burrito.

I am now convinced that most people in SF have no clue on what constitutes good Mexican food. How many times have you heard some drunken Marinaite tell you that the restaurant has to be filthy to be good Mexican? Why? So you can get sick? This place is fairly dirty, bad score from Health Dept., but it's really the boring food. Carne asada is dull and rubbery, and the burrito are way too crammed with the overly oniony salsa. A hint to serving chips and salsa: chips from a bag are not authentic, and don't taste good. Keeping the salsa in the fridge where it absorbs all the other stale flavors is not a good idea. Skip this one. Go to La Cumbre, Pancho Villa, or El Toro. La Corneta is awesome as well, and yes my pasty-faced friends, IT'S CLEAN.", "author": "Michael F."}

Most San Franciscans only refer to the first one on \"the mile\" drag of Mission Street. People who think vegetarian burritos are legitimate. ;-)  In my opinion that location has always been a bit overrated, although I do enjoy their Alambres and the classic Ranchera jukebox. Nothing like Lola Beltran belting \"Cuccurrucucu Paloma\" or Vicente Fernandez wailing \"Volver, Volver\" to enhance the ambience of a casual Mexican meal. The Cancun closer to the Bernal Heights side of south Mission is vastly superior in food quality, cleanliness, and general atmosphere. Ideally flavor is the only thing that matters in a taqueria though, and I've never been disappointed by this location's goodies. You can forget about the Cancun on Market Street unless you need to drop in for convenience. Perhaps the issue is size. The less crowded the kitchen, the better the food seems to be in this chain. Let the masses go to the perfectly fine La Taqueria down the street. It has its superb tacos, but if you want a less hectic, less noisy taco/burrito experience, consider walking several blocks up Mission to the Bernal Heights Cancun. It's one of the \"best kept secrets\" of the area.\n\nYes, the chips suck. Oh well. The salsas are very good and the \"entrees\" are tacqueria-perfect.\"", "author": "Dean E."}

The food is truly mediocre when compared to many other taqs in San Francisco.  I will concede that the prices are a little lower than many other Mexican joints, but the food is reduced in quality (by just a little).  Cancun boasts that they have the best vegetarian burrito in the city.  This I will unequivocally refute: While the veggie is well-priced, it is substantially smaller than other burritos around town, and is mostly tortilla wrapped around itself a bunch of times.  It tastes just OK, but Castillito's (in the Loin) veggie is much larger and more delicious.  This place has a lot of hype surrounding it, I guess it is due to its location near a lot of bars.  Drunk people can't tell their ass from their elbow, let alone discern truly quality Taqueria food.
