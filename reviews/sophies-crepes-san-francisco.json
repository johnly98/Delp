Small place with a few tables and chairs. \n\nThe cashier was nice. My boyfriend pointed out that no one was wearing gloves. The man who was making the crepe was touching the spreading knife or whatever it was, with his fingers like fondling with it. I didn't see if they washed their hands before starting our order either. Then a girl, also gloveless, putting the fruits in it and wrapping the crepe up to be placed inside the paper.\n\nOverall it tasted really good, the fruits was fresh. Mines had kiwi, banana and strawberries. I never had a crepe like that before, usually it's just banana and Nutella or something. So the strawberry ice cream made it really delicious!", "author": "Yee W."}

There's an ATM there in case you forget. \nI've only had one kind of crepe here and it's the only one that everyone should get. Nutella crepe and add gelato!!!! They use Fiorello's gelato and it's the best gelato out there. I love Sophie's crepe above all the other crepe places in Japantown because something about their batter causes the crepe to crisp up and the crepe becomes crispy yet still soft, not soggy. Not the traditional soft crepe, but for wonderful reason. \n\nI always get the mixed fruit Nutella crepe (banana, strawberry, and kiwi) -- but you can choose any combo or fruit you desire. Whatever you choose, you MUST add gelato. It's extra money, but very very worth it. Highly recommend green tea gelato, hazelnut gelato (nocciola = hazelnut in Italian), or black sesame gelato. They're all good to be honest.", "author": "Audrey D."}

The chicken salad pesto filling was delicious. And this is similar to eating a large sandwich. I was FULL after finishing this!

Waiting in line gave us ample time to peruse their menu of savory and sweet crepes, which I was grateful for as I was super undecided between a couple of crepes. \n\nAlso note that they have an additional menu of sweet and savory crepes both at the counter. My friend was planning to go with the egg melt crepe until he saw the veggie crepe on the separate menu.\n\nI ended up going with #13 mixed fruits (strawberry banana, and kiwi) and whipped cream with a scoop of green tea ice cream. The crepe itself was the perfect thickness and its bland flavor provided a good contrast to the sweeter fillings inside.

They're delicate and fancy, but the minute you start adding in crazy toppings, these dainty desserts become every kid's sweet-tooth dream. Even though I was incredibly full from a hefty lunch, there was no way I was going to say no to a fresh crepe.\n\nTugging the hubby alongside me, we stepped into the shop and instantly smelled the crisp batter. There were so many choices, making it hard to choose just one. I knew for sure I had to get one with Nutella, and after some contemplation, I added vanilla ice cream to it too. \n\nI will say that the little parlor has A LOT of rules. There are no cameras or pictures allowed. No credit card or debit card, cash only. No exchanges or returns of food. And you need to count your change BEFORE you leave the shop. I honestly felt as if I had to be on my best behavior. \n\nSo perhaps the parlor isn't the most customer-friendly, but the crepe itself is so good that I'm sure you'll forget all about it. The smell of the Nutella and the warm crepe together was delicious, and the generous scoop of vanilla ice cream on the inside was incredibly creamy and decadent. The contrast between the warm crepe and the cool ice cream, then the combination of the hazelnut and vanilla made for one of the most addicting desserts we've ever had. Even the hubby had to come back for a few more bites. This crepe is also very car-friendly, due to the thick wrapping and how neatly the crepe is layered. Absolutely mess-free!\n\nThe crepes may be a bit on the pricey side, but it will be a treat you'll enjoy in every single bite.", "author": "Quyen L."}

They were fast and efficient with getting them out, however, so I can't really complain that much.  Another thing that bothered me was that it was cash only.  That's very inconvenient when your main food items, crepes, are all at least $6 or more.  Luckily I had cash on me and was able to make a purchase here.\n\nThe crepe itself tasted great!  It wasn't the most amazing thing I've ever had, but it doesn't disappoint either!  I liked the ice cream here, it was supreme and sublime.  In fact, I liked it even more than the crepe itself.

It's so addictive and it's been one of my favorite go-tos in Japantown since I was a kid.  Anytime I've been in Japantown, I've visited the bookstore next to it, browsed through the shops with their beautiful trinkets and teas, and I've enjoyed a crepe.\n\nNow some warning for those who've never been here:  Get your order right and make sure you check what you get before you accept it.  Once you take a bite, any errors are on you for not voicing your concerns.  There's signage that says a much predominantly displayed. Not that they've screwed up an order for me, but I've seen very indecisive people here switch and babble through an order that sometimes what comes out doesn't fulfill their final requests.  However, if you catch an error and speak up immediately, they'll fix it.\n\nWhat I go for here is a sweet crepe.  They make the crepes right at the front (you can even watch through the window outside the store).  They offer both savory and sweet varieties of crepes as well as have an option for you to create your own.  On top of that, they offer shorbets and ice creams with toppings galore.  Today, I made my own crepe with fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and a dollop of vanilla ice cream.  Between the crunchiness of the crepe, the creaminess of the whipped cream and ice cream, and the slight tartness of the strawberries, I was so in heaven.  \n\nThis place will continue to be my go-to for desserts whenever I'm in Japantown.", "author": "Angela K."}

Unless you are a xenophobic trumpster, there is no denying a huge crepe cone filled with ice cream, fruits, and whipped cream, that you can blissfully carry around like carnival food while window-shopping all the kawaii paraphernalia of Japantown.\n\nIt's fun to watch the crepe being made behind the counter: the batter is spread out and smoothed with the ladle which doubles as a crepe-flattener (for lack of a better word). The result is a paper-thin, crispy crepe which contrasts well with the hearty dessert toppings. One could argue the crepe is a bit too dry and papery, but I guess this is what makes it most fascinating; the concept reminds me of Japanese stationery with all its precision and eccentricity.\n\nMy favorite combination is black sesame ice cream, green tea sauce, and red bean paste--the trifecta of Japanese desserts. Yes it is a bit pricey for a dessert, but rather standard for the SF price range.\n\nThe store itself is down-to-earth, with sufficient seating, ice cream on display, and the magic circular crepe grill. It's no-frills and functions as an ideal pit stop during Japantown excursions.\n\nThe verdict? Sophie's crepes are photogenic and almost endearing in a sense, bringing out your inner child over the joy of simple desserts. Caution crepe purists: do not expect authentic French-style crepes with that fine balance between buttery and airy, the delicately precise velvety texture, and bouge toppings such as housemade compote. Sophie's are in the true spirit of Japanese crepes, light and thin with basic toppings.\n\nPro tip: for Japanese crepes with *cute animal faces*, check out Belly Good in the same plaza!", "author": "Edna C."}

But the man who was working was giving us so much attitude. Overall I would come back once in a while only because it's pricey and the service is just meh.", "author": "Carissa C."}

Both were delicious. The serving size looked adequate but felt tiny in our tummies. No matter, it was delicious! The wait did get upsetting and the fact that the 5 \"kids\" behind the counter were laughing and playing around did not help the mood of those waiting.

There are many crepe place in the same mall structure but Sophie's Crepes is the best in my opinion.\n\nI like their black sesame, hazelnut and green tea ice cream. It is always difficult to narrow down the flavor I want... I recommend the Japanese crepe, which is kind of far down near the bottom of the menu as one of the special items. It is basically a crepe with green tea ice cream, some red bean and matcha sauce. The matcha sauce is SO amazing! It is strong in matcha flavor, while the ice cream is more on the 'green tea' flavor side. However, you can get a green tea ice cream crepe with less the price, which is equally good. I am still on the fence about whether the matcha sauce and red bean is worth the extra few dollars, but if you haven't tried it you should! \n\nI would say all their ice cream flavors are pretty good, so you can't really go wrong. If you do want ice cream, it is best to get the ice cream with crepe instead of just ice cream in a cup. With about the same price, you get a bigger scoop of ice cream AND the crepe so it's a better deal. I can't wait to come back for more Sophie's Crepes!", "author": "Karen C."}

Unfortunately, I thought Sophie's was probably the worst of the three. Don't get me wrong - the crepes themselves were pretty good. It's just that in comparison to the other crepes that I've had, it wasn't as amazing as it could have been.\n\nRegarding PRICE, I think other places have had more reasonable prices. I paid over $7 dollars plus tax for a strawberry & whipped cream crepe with added black sesame ice cream. It's an additional $2.50 to add an ice cream scoop, which is very expensive compared to other locations. If you don't want ice cream in your crepes, the price is much cheaper, but I personally think that ice cream adds a lot.\n\nRegarding TASTE & TEXTURE, I think that the crepe texture was part soft and part crunchy. I wish that it could have been crunchier, but that might just be personal preference. The crepe layer was very thin though and didn't leak, which was super impressive. The mixture of ingredients was really good, and the gelato assortment has a lot of asian flavors (i.e. matcha, red bean, black sesame), which is great.\n\nRegarding SERVICE & ATMOSPHERE, Sophie's is more of a take-out crepe place. There is very limited seating inside, so most people get their food to go and crowd around the square benches outside. The workers inside seemed to care a lot about efficiency and were not super friendly to me... if anything, they were quite cold and wanted me to order as quickly as possible, making for not the best experience.\n\nI think that my experience at Sophie's could have been made better in many ways. However, if I am in the area again, I would get another one of their crepes because they were pretty good. I just think that there are better crepe experiences elsewhere in San Francisco.", "author": "Sheila D."}

I've been coming for years & this place never disappoints me. The only disappointment I have is if I leave Japantown without stopping by here! I always appreciate the size of the crepe because it is big so it's really filling or good to share as a dessert after a filling meal. The crepe batter tastes so simple yet delicious. They always manage to make their crepes nice & crispy on the outer layer yet warm & soft in the inner layer. Personally, I love having a crunchy factor in my crepes as opposed to an all soft one. I'm a pretty simple person so my usual order is letter E which is a crepe with strawberries, chocolate sauce, vanilla ice cream, & whipped cream. Sometimes I'll add an extra topping or substitute something here & there to change it up a little bit!\n\nThe customer service for this place always depends on how busy they are because there are some days where they have long lines. I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 because this place is not cheap! I always order the crepe combinations that are on the menu instead of creating my own crepes because the toppings here are pricey & they add up really fast!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-12", "description": "Woo, Sophie! What is the secret to your delicate crepes!?\n\nSophie's Crepes is located inside the Japanese center. You might be able to easily find it if you start to follow all the people that are checking it out. I was actually surprised that even on a Thursday mid afternoon, people were coming in and out. My partner and I were looking for something to snack on and when I saw that this place had nearly 1500 reviews, I knew that there must be something special about this crepe place.\n\nNow we've had our share of crepes at a wide variety of places. Whether they are on plates, in boxes or in a cone to hold, crepes are popular everywhere. So what makes Sophie's Crepes so special?\n\nWe decided to find out. They have a savory menu and a sweet menu like most places. We chose the sweet path like most people do. I saw one crepe that really made my heart beat. It's called the Japanese and it comes with green tea gelato, matcha powder and red bean paste. If you are a green tea lover, your jaw should be dropping now. You aren't going to find a crepe like this on a menu everywhere. However, my partner isn't so much of a green tea lover like I am and since I was too full to consume one of my own, we decided to go with the mixed fruit crepe. This crepe comes with strawberries, bananas, kiwis and whipped cream. Most of the dessert crepes come with some sort of fruit, whipped cream or nutella. You can also add a scoop of ice cream into your crepe for an additional cost if you want.\n\nThis place is CASH only so bring money if you want a crepe! We paid 6$ for ours and got a bit of change back. They give you your receipt with a number and you can watch your crepe being made.\n\nThe batter that they use for their crepes seemed slightly different and the crepe size seemed a bit bigger. The best thing is that they take time and effort to make sure your crepe is filled nicely and has the perfect look. They put plenty of whipped cream (almost too much!) and enough fruit so that every bite would have a piece. On the very top, they garnished it with a piece of kiwi, strawberry and banana. Now this place does place it in a cone like shape for you to hold. Most places the cone is very circular at the top (base), but Sophie makes it flatter. Surprisingly, it works better that way so that each bite can actually fit into your mouth.\n\nFirst bite, woah. The batter is special. Most crepe places have too soft of a crepe that is absorbs all the moisture and starts to get soggy towards the end. Not Sophie's Crepes. These are crisp on the outside but soft on the inside! They maintain their shape very well and don't absorb much. The whipped cream tasted homemade and the fruits were very fresh. Definitely a scrumptious dessert crepe.\n\nSo far this is one of the best crepe places I have been. Out of all the ones that put them in a cone shape, this is the best. Sophie, you're doing something right. Keep the secret of your batter to yourself so that people can continue to love your crepes.", "author": "Liz C."}

For my first time, I was pretty full from dinner so I just got a crepe with a scoop of ice cream. It was kinda disappointing how dinky the thing looked. It had like just one tiny scoop of ice cream so I was kinda just eating crepe with a bit of ice cream. I wasn't very impressed with it.\n\nThe second time, I wasn't quite full from dinner and I sampled both the sesame ice cream and the mocha chip. Both were delicious! But the sesame was too good to pass up. If you've had sesame flavored tang yuan (the little mochi dessert balls in a sugary type soup dessert), it tastes just like the sesame from it! So delicious! I got it with some strawberries which didn't really go with the ice cream too much, but it was still quite tasty. The crepe itself was on the softer side. \n\nIf you're in Japantown, this place is definitely worth checking out! Make sure you get some samples of the sesame and green tea ice creams!", "author": "Angel K."}

Unfortunately, it seemed like it was a \"must try\" for every other Japantown visitor as well! The lines and the crowds were pretty intense when we arrived around 6 PM on Saturday. So we decided to get dinner first and come back afterwards for dessert, at which time the lines were... way worse!  They told us the wait would be about 15 minutes, but at the time they were servicing numbers in the 30s and our number was 66, which should've told us something about their estimation accuracy. In fact, it was 30+ minutes before we got our crepe.  \n\nWe split a Japanese green tea gelato crepe with added whip cream. Although this is not your traditional type of crepe, we were in Japantown, so why not try a local specialty we thought. The crepe itself is shaped like an ice cream cone held in place by a paper cone on the outside. Odd, but it works. We both enjoyed the crepe, although this was my first ice cream crepe, and it's probably an acquired taste. The whipped cream however just didn't mix with the ice cream flavor, and next time I'll just save the added dollar. The crepe itself also was a little different, sweet enough to even eat plain, not as soft as some crepes I've had, a little on the firmer side, with a texture.  Again, different but good.\n\nStill, although the crepe was tasty, I have to subtract a star for  the hassle of getting it.

The other stand in Japantown, however, the crepe is still floppy and soft. But as for the INGREDIENTS, hands down Sophie -- yes, JUST because of the lychee gelato. \n\nThe ONLY crepe combination I get is the one with strawberries and nutella with a scoop of lychee gelato.

This is a popular crepe/dessert shop where the workers make the crepes fresh and on display for all to see.  It's neat because you get to see the batter poured onto the griddle and then smoothly skimmed flat.  While photos and video recording is forbidden, I did find a very good video of Sophie's crepe-making process on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM-qPLN09Vk.  It's interesting to watch.\n\nSophie's offers both savory and sweet crepes.  Most customers tend to go for the sweet crepes.  The shop also serves gelato and sundaes.  Most of the savory crepes run about $5 each and include ingredients such as cheese, ham, turkey, egg, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  Most of the sweet crepes run about $4-5 each and include ingredients such as chocolate, Nutella, fruit, and gelato.  Yes, you can gelato in your crepes (win).  Examples of other toppings include whipped cream, butter, sugar, cinnamon, brown sugar, honey, and fruit jam.  There are about a dozen savory options and almost 20 sweet options.\n\nI recommend the #8 Strawberry and Nutella crepe with your choice of gelato.  Watch them make it for you on the spot.  If you don't know what Nutella is, it's a chocolate hazelnut spread.  The fruit is ripe and the gelato is dense, smooth, and flavorful.  The crepes are big (see photo: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YzWGtloh9gruoRvOjVo1lg&userid=j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg) and are an ideal flavor combination of sweet and tart.  The outer, pancake-like batter is warm, light, crispy, and soft.  It's delicious and appetizing.\n\nSince Sophie's Crepes is at Japantown, it's a nice place to stop for an on-the-go snack or for dessert after dining at one of the many Japanese restaurants nearby.  The shop isn't very big with limited seating inside.  Fortunately, there's seating outside in the common area.  Plus, the crepes are neatly packaged in a paper cone, making them easily portable.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-23", "description": "Before you eat one of these crepes, it's important to understand what a \"Japanese crepe\" is. It's fairly similar to a French crepe, but served more casually (in a triangular paper cone, for example) and is thinner and crispier on the edges. It's also slightly sweeter and slightly less buttery and \"egg\"-y. In some ways, it tastes a little bit like a high-quality Fortune cookie.\n\nNow that you know what to expect, I can tell you that Sophie's serves up a very standard Japanese-style crepe. It is everything I described above, served with whatever sweet or savory filling you choose. There's often a pretty long line but it moves fast so you'll have a hot, delicious crepe in your hands in no time. It's cash only, but a lot of the crepes are under $5 so you don't need too much cash on hand!\n\nSophie's is a great place to grab a quick snack or a dessert after shopping or dining in Japantown.

There was about one slice of deli turkey mixed with a huge leaf of lettuce (that took half the volume), cheese melted on one side and then some tomato and avocado bits here and there.\n\nTo be fair, the French people I've spoken with have lectured me not to have more than two ingredients in any crepe, but this was a menu item (and the avocado definitely didn't ruin it) where I expected some QA. \n\nAdditionally, it's cash only, and they have several weird signs prohibiting photographs (why would people necessarily *want* to photograph a crepe place, and why would it be a big deal if they did?) and warning people not to change their order after they've paid.

Located on the second story of an inside mall, Sophie's Crepes had a good stream of customers around lunchtime on a Thursday. \n\nThere are two or three small tables inside and some additional bench seating outside (not sure if those are actually part of the crepe restaurant though). Photos and videos are prohibited inside the shop, which I found interesting since I've never seen that restriction before. Service was efficient and fine.\n\nChocolate crepe with light chocolate chips:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sophies-crepes-san-francisco?select=ZhVeO9ilESwKeelJR80HmA#UuZR-hy_185IIaf5UTh-YQ)\nI opted for just a chocolate crepe, and the cashier asked me whether I'd like the chocolate in the form of chocolate syrup or chocolate chips. I like that they offer the option, and I chose to get light chocolate chips. The crepe itself was more crunchy than chewy, and while I felt like the first few bites were good, towards the end it just got a little hard. With the other fancy fillings, I think it takes the focus away from the actual crepe and allows for the crepe to become softer and soggier as the ice cream melts. With just the crepe and chocolate though, I could really taste the crepe itself, which was fresh but a little bland. I could have used more egginess, and even though I don't like desserts that are too sweet, this was on the blander side even then. \n\nI might come back and try one of their fancier crepes when I'm not so full, but this time was nothing special. Also, this is probably just me being nitpicky, but it bothers me a little bit that the cooks flip the crepes with their bare hands.. no gloves or utensils or anything. I'm sure it's clean enough, just like sushi chefs handle food with their bare hands, but I noticed that one of the girls had chipped nail polish on her fingers, and that was a little worrisome to me.", "author": "Maggie X."}

Their crepes are decent, it tends to run on the softer side and doesn't have much taste to it. More like it's there to hold the ice cream, fruits and topping as well as adding some texture to it. They're fruits tend to be pretty fresh and usually ripe (or at least the times I've had it). They're ice cream is pretty good and you can't go wrong with nutella.\n\nNow it can be hard to find, it's on the second floor in the mall in Japantown. You can either test your luck by trying to find street parking, but there's also a garage if you're unlucky. Or if you live nearby like I did, you can walk.\n\nThey also have tables and chairs for you to sit and enjoy your crepe.

If you don't order gelato in the crepe, you are forced to have regular Smart and Final vanilla ice cream filling. I personally don't like the texture of gelato mixed with crepe so I went for the plain vanilla. Wasn't bad....just could have been better. The serving of fruit could have also been bigger.\n\nOne thing I didn't like was that the bottom of my crepe got really soggy and ice cream started dripping out of the end.

I ordered two crepes...\n1) Strawberries, Nutella, and whipped cream\n2) Bananas, Nutella, whipped cream, and banana walnut gelato. FYI adding whipped cream or gelato to a crepe is an upcharge, nbd that's fair.\n\nI paid the cashier, all was well, but then I noticed the guy making the crepes did not add bananas to the second crepe. It looked like strawberry sauce, chocolate sauce, and gelato. I told him it was supposed to be banana Nutella, and the cashier came over and asked what was wrong. I told her what the order was supposed to be and she apologized and said she entered it wrong into the computer. She then told me she needed to re-enter the order because there would be a price difference. \n\nThe cashier re-enters the order, I pay her an extra 1.35, the dude remakes the crepe and packages it to go. I get outside, and guess what, no gelato this time! \n\nThe fact that I had to pay an initial upcharge for the gelato and then a price difference when the cashier messed it up, and they still screwed up the order...come on. I could understand if this place was busy and this happened, but it was dead.

Slipped into the ultra corner of the mall in the general area of Pika Pika, Sophie's sometimes have lines out the door because their place is small and only has about three tables inside to sit down in. \n\nSimilar to every other crepe place, they have set combinations on their menu where you can choose which ever sound appetizing to you, OR you can customize your own crepe. I usually get the usual strawberry ice cream on original batter with strawberries topped with nutella. I think the crepe came out to be on the crunchy side. They sliced the strawberries into think slices which I like because most places have the entire strawberry or half of it which is way to heavy and makes my crepe collapse fast.

We waited about 3 minutes in line before we could order, but the cashier was friendly and patient despite the crowd. I ordered a crepe with banana and Nutella, and was asked if I wanted whipped cream with it. I answered, \"Sure,\" but realized later that they charged me an extra dollar for it. Oh well. After we ordered we waited another 10 minutes for the crepes, but we spent the time watching the guy make them and guessing if he was making ours so the wait wasn't that bad. \n\nWhen we finally got our crepes, I was surprised by the amount of whipped cream on mine! The whipped cream was fresh and tasty though (I guess the amount was worth the extra $1), but I probably wouldn't order a crepe with whipped cream again since the first few bites were mainly just cool whipped cream. My crepe was also slightly crunchy, and I wished it had more nutella. My sister got a crepe with green tea ice cream, and since the crepes are served in cones the ice cream kept dripping out the bottom. My cousin also had ice cream with her crepe and hers was pretty messy to eat too. \n\nNevertheless, it was a fun stop during our visit to Japantown, and we all ended up really full!", "author": "Stephanie L."}

Obviously, with over 700 reviews this small crepe bar is pretty famous, and for good reason.  They provide an array of both savory and sweet crepes to satisfy any taste bud.  Normally I get turned off by long lines that stretch outside the restaurant, but I knew then that these crepes were going to be worth it.\n\nThe restaurant is located in the second part of the plaza, with a couple of small tables and seats to sit at.  However, it may be uncomfortable to stay inside if it gets too busy.\n\nThe crepe Yvonne L. and I shared was delicious!  Filled with a generous amount of red beans and green tea ice cream, the flavors made it a refreshing dessert on a hot summer day.  Between two people, the crepe was more than enough, so if you're down to share with a friend, I would definitely recommend it.  You can also take your crepe to go and explore the rest of what Japantown has to offer.\n\nThe next time I return to this wonderful community, I will be making another stop at Sophie's Crepes.

I ask if I could substitute the banana for a different fruit because I 'm not a huge fan of them, and they said I have to pay extra which I felt was weird.

I've never eaten there before and didn't know anything about their rules, and she was being rude about. I just told her to leave the bananas then. (I don't hate bananas I would rather have to eat it with the fruit I like). I went to pay( I was going to use my card). Then she told me in an annoyed voice they don't accept card and they only accept cash. Luckily I had some cash on me, but I don't remember seeing a sign saying that....maybe they do, but I really didn't see one. They do have a sign saying not to take pictures in the shop thou....I thought that was weird. Also, no one working there was wearing gloves which is just unsanitary. I there's only 2 table inside which makes it kinda cramped. I don't think I'll be going there again. Not trying to bash them the food is good, but I think you can find a place just as good.

I took the ham, cheese and avo with a dob of Japanese mayo. The cr\u00eape was cooked to perfection-- a tad crispy on the edges but moist and spongy throughout. The real litmus test though was the avocado. Attention to detail or lack thereof can make or break a dish especially if the avo is too ripe and begins to taste like fetid, rotten bacon. But in my case, the avocado was perfectly ripe, firm enough to have the pleasant avo texture yet soft enough to blend in with the other ingredients upon a bite. I must have devoured the entire crepe in five minutes or less as the attendant didn't believe how fast it was gone.

I definitely felt like they could have given me more ice cream and strawberries for the price I paid.\n\nOn another note, the ice cream in my crepe started to melt so I asked for a plate. They told me they didn't have any plates... which is a little unusual for a dessert cafe.", "author": "Victoria L."}

They have a slight crunchy texture, which I personally like, and there are lots of options to choose from, from savory to sweet. On the weekdays, they aren't usually busy, but there can be long lines on the weekends.\nThe spoons are, and have always been, really flimsy. Back then, the edges of the spoons made my lips bleed, but I haven't noticed that recently. Don't know if they changed the spoons though, since they're still super flimsy.\n\nAlso, it's cash only, which can be annoying, but whatever.\n\nThe real reason I'm deducting 2 stars is not because it's cash only, or because of the spoons, but because of this one rude cashier. They don't wear name tags, so I hate to describe her, but if the employees or management are reading this then they really should be aware. The rude employee was a slightly chubby Asian girl with a blue bandana (but they probably all wear bandanas?) who wears/wore her long black hair in a low ponytail. She couldn't hear my order so she asked me to repeat it, which was fine. But when I wanted to double check that my order came with a crepe (as opposed to a cup), she was like \"uh... yeah...\" with a face and voice that told me I was stupid. My boyfriend even agreed that she was pretty rude to us. I work in customer service and this was appalling!

I came here again last Saturday and thought it was pretty good, but not as good as I remembered. We were pretty full from lunch, so four of us split the nutella & mixed fruit crepe and the green tea gelato sundae. A main thing is that I find it hard to justify the prices, everything is a bit overpriced in my opinion. Also, I don't like that it's cash only, it's inconvenient. \n\nThe crepe was decent (anything with Nutella is good, let's be real), but I wanted more fruit - there were a few pieces of banana and strawberry and maybe one piece of kiwi. It was smaller than I expected and difficult to split, but that's mostly due to the nature of a crepe itself...\n\nThe green tea gelato sundae was absolutely delicious but also way smaller than I expected. It was layers of green tea gelato, red bean paste and whipped cream - such a magical combination. It had really yummy flavors and a good balance, wasn't too sweet at all.

While my girlfriend is spending hours at Ichiban Kan or Kinokuniya Stationery and Gift, I head over to Sophie's for a afternoon crepe. So, which crepe should you get? Lucky, there is two of us so I can get a savory and sweet crepe. Eat some and then trade off. Best arrangement ever. Or eat sushi and then grab a dessert crepe. \n\nThe biggest problems is waiting in the long line. It always goes out the door on a weekend afternoon.

I can't really say much about the other flavors, but I think based on the texture of the crepe the rest will do well as well! \n\nA few things I don't get about this place: why no pictures allowed to be taken in the store? and why is adding whipped cream an extra dollar with a few squeezes of it?", "author": "Christine B."}

My brother made his own: chocolate sauce, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream (~$4.75). Prices were on par with other crepe places I've been to.\n\nThey run an efficient service here, with each crepe being made in less than 5 minutes.

My Japanese was everything I could have asked for; the crepe had a crisp consistency; the red beans were perfectly sweetened; the matcha sauce added a dense, bitter flavor that complemented the green tea ice cream perfectly.

The egg salad crepe is served with 1 heaping scope of egg salad with lettuce. The egg salad itself can be on the heavy side from the mayo if eaten all at once. It's a good thing I chose to walk it off that day while visiting the city with friends from Sac. The ham & cheese crepe has the right amount of crunch with an equal amount of ham & cheese together. \n\nThe dessert crepes I had from this shop include the gelato crepe, the fruit with gelato crepe, the fruit crepe covered with nutella, and the fruit crepe with gelato covered with nutella.

The crepe itself is really what I'm sold on. It was thin and not overbearing in relation to the rest of the ingredients (simple: strawberries, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream), had a crispy outer layer that felt good to bite into, and it wasn't too sweet.

When it's soggy, it sucks. Sophie's has just enough crisp and it's perfection! Also, the way the toppings(fruit/ice cream/etc) are arranged inside are made so you could bite it all together! ..And the toppings are there throughout the whole crepe. Some places put the toppings so that it's only on the top which I don't like because later you'd just be eating batter!\n\nGo to sophies!", "author": "Tammy N."}

I've been here so many times with friends and family and it's just delicious. Whenever I'm in Japantown, I would always have to stop by this place even if I'm really full after a big meal. It's a must.\nTheir fruits are so fresh and delicious and their thin pancake is always crispy, crunchy and soft. I just can't explain how delicious this place is. I tried a different crepe place around here and I didn't like it as much. I think this will be the only crepe place I will keep coming back for.\nThe only complaint I have is that it's always crowded and the place is small, so there's no room to sit inside or outside that area. There's always a lot of people walking around and sitting, so there's really no where to sit anywhere, unless you walk while you eat or just wait for someone to leave. Other than that, you guys have to try this place and get order F, which is strawberries, kiwi, bananas and vanilla ice cream crepe. You can always ask for a different flavor, but the only 2 ice cream flavors I've tried (and liked) with this order is vanilla and green tea.", "author": "Vicky L."}

So I managed to walk around the mall with my crepe in my hand.

In fair assessment and lack of size, the crepes did tasted ok.\n\nMy fifth ever crepe and I was hoping a crepe would be the same size of a super burrito.

Nothing to complain about.\n\nThe crepes at Sophie's are always thin and crispy with just the right amount sweetness. Hence, the title of the best Japanese crepe~ Unlike the traditional French crepe, the Japanese style ones at Sophie are thinner and ends up with a nice crunch near the edge. Mixed with the ice cream and fresh fruits, this makes a cool delightable and portable dessert. Personally I like the ice cream to melt a little first so that it runs down the crepe and since the crepe is a little crispy, the ice cream does not make the crepe soggy at all. Moreover, probably due to the thinner crepe, the chef makes them super fast, but this is negated by the usual long line that seems to always be present. The service is fine as I really only interact with the cashier who took my money in an orderly fashion I suppose. I do advise against the savory crepes as those are obviously not their forte.

I never knew what it was until I had it on a crepe, and now it's become a staple of my pantry at home. All the other dessert crepes are pretty good also, although I've never tried one of their actual meal crepes. \n\nFew gripes about the place though, although not enough to knock off a star.

It cost $5.25 ($5.70 with the tax), which may sound pricey, but it'll all make sense to you after you take a bite of it! The crepe is crispy and thin, so it doesn't distract from the complementary flavors of the creamy green tea gelato and the red bean. I seriously wanted to run back into the store to get another one after finishing it haha! \n\nThey also have the make-your-own crepe, where you can start out with the crepe at $2, and then add as many toppings as you desire, with prices ranging from $0.25 to $0.75 per topping. Their gelato selection also looks fantastically delicious; they have enticing flavors like lychee, pistachio, plum, and banana walnut which I would like to try one day! \n\nOne setback is that it only took cash! They have an ATM right in front of the place, just in case you did forget to bring some cash, but it charges $2 for withdrawing. Also on the particular day I went, the lady who was taking my order was a bit rude while waiting for me to decide on my order, but it didn't really bother me too much. \n\nOverall, definitely a place I will come back to every time I'm in SF!", "author": "Kristi L."}

All the other materials are already made, so the only real interesting part is to see how crepes are made. Think of it as if the crepes are European strippers and the only way to get your hands on one of them is to purchase them. But if not, you're only going to be able to satisfy your eyes visually and not orally. I suppose the smell will also entice you but I wouldn't advice smelling a European stripper (they'd probably smell sticky)\n\nWhen they make the crepes, they cook them until they're crispy so that when you bite into it, you get the warm, flaky crisp along with all the yummies on the inside. Be sure to use a spoon as well as it makes things a lot cleaner! Don't be a dirty hoe making a mess. Be a little refined please.\n\nI suppose to be fair, there's another creperie in the same center that I would prefer ONLY if I wanted to be more visually enticed and if in the rare situation that I would want to get my hands on a softer version than a crispy hard one. But most of the time I'd rather have that crispy and hard sensation in my mouth so I more-often-than-not opt for Sophie's.\n\nIf you're going to Japantown, this is definitely one place that YOU MUST stop by. Forget the cupcakes and the ice cream that you'll see along the way (and no offense, especially forget Andersen bakery. It's delicious but seriously,  you can get that anywhere..).

The cr\u00eape just didn't compare to true European counterparts and there weren't enough Japanese-customizations to justify this as a true fusion food instead of simply a mediocre knock-off.\n\nJapanese Cr\u00eape: Not served like a traditional French cr\u00eape, but folded like an ice cream cone with the filling in the center.  This was many times better than other ice cream cone I've had, but doesn't stack up to traditional cr\u00eape texture.  The top of the cone is light and airy, but the bottom has so many layers I felt like I was eating a flaky cookie and felt dry mouthed at the end.

A couple days before, I decided to get a whole big jar of nutella for finals. \n\nAnyways, we came here after a little walking and dinner. Japantown is nicely decorated at this time with Christmas lights in the Peace Plaza. It's a nice little restaurant with very little seating inside, but a couple of benches right outside. \n\nThere's a nice little window to watch the production of crepes - they are actually really efficient about it. It's super cool to watch other people's getting made and your own as well. \n\nFood:\nStrawberry and Nutella Crepe: Oh my. I love nutella and strawberries together. This was a great combination. \nMandarin Oranges and Ice Cream Crepe: I loved the ice cream part of it. Mandarin Oranges were not the best part I think. \n\nParking sucks around here, but sometimes you can get lucky and find street parking.

The individual crepe makers might be pretty quick and dedicated to what they do, but two specific things pissed me off. The first issue is how the cashier handled the situation between a friend and me regarding whom was going to pay for our Crepes. I placed a $20 bill on the counter next to the cashiers hand and told him I was going to pay for our Crepes and the cashier acknowledged. My friend snuck his cash payment that consisted of a $5 and $1 bills and the cashier said, \"Oh, I can use the change\" as he handed the $20 back to me. What the fcuk was that about? I'll bet the cashier thought I was kidding when I told him they were losing a star off my yelp review for how he handled the situation. The second issue was, their inability to get two Crepes finished on the same order, in a consecutive manner. Basically, they finished one crepe and set it aside, then another few Crepes for other orders, before finishing the second crepe, while the first cooled off and lost its crisp.\n\nQuality - Four stars.

If you decide to come here, you're probably going to spend at most $10 for a crepe, and don't be discourage about the price but keep in mind that Japan Town is a  tourist spot, so of course whenever you go to a hot area, it will be jacked up a few dollars.

Theirs is evenly dense whereas a good crepe must be alternatively light and crackly. I get that they tweaked the recipe to make it easier to eat on the go but frankly the end result is not only not an authentic crepe but not very good on its own right. Too chewy and dense. \nAnd what about the taste? I managed to bite into the filling-less tail end and the crepe has a nice sweetness to it but it is not nearly flavorful enough. I wouldn't call it bland but very very clearly they have not managed to recreate even a tenth of the goodness of a crepe done right.\nAnd then there is the filling. Now I ordered a strawberry whipped cream crepe which seemed classic enough. Well, they filled the crepe with whipped cream as if it was a cream puff. Whipped cream inside. Then some more. Then on top. Whipped cream whipped cream whipped cream everywhere. All you taste is the whipped cream and worse yet all you feel under the tongue is the whipped cream. I don't need to tell you that it quickly becomes sickening to eat. Completely marred the whole experience and I couldn't finish the crepe. It didn't taste bad exactly (and I will give them credit that, in sync with their slogan, the strawberries did taste fresh and not watery) but just unpleasant to eat.\nOverall I just can't recommend Sophie's Crepes.

Tucked behind the bamboo bushel's of Japan Town's most sacred building is Sophie's Crepe. Who is sophie? and what is a crepe? you may ask. Well a crepe is a desert plate made of batter, and Sophie, I can only assume, to be some sort of taste god. Similar to that of a very thin pancake, it is freshly made in front of your eyes with a creamy blend of batter. Within seconds, the batter solidifies into a circular crepe. Ingredients that are prepared for each unique desert are wrapped within the crepe before it is ready for finish. You can either pick a savory crepe or a sweet crepe. A savory crepe is more like a breakfast/brunch/lunch kind of entree whereby one can get salty ingredients on their crepe such as ham or other meets. Desert crepes on the other hand will have ingredients such as sweet fruits, sugar, ice cream, whipped cream, etc. \n\nFor me, the first and only thing I ever get from here is the Butter and sugar desert crepe with a scoop of whatever icecream I am feeling for at the time. I usually pick vanilla, but recently I have chosen cookies and creme. Anyways, this crepe is the bomb. It is the ultimate best choice for desert crepes, and I have yet to find a crepe that can beat the quality, texture, crunch, and sweetness of the perfectly made crepe. I have been to tons of crepe shops around the bay area and middle california, but have continually failed when it came to finding good, quality crepe that one can simply taste. The only alternative to Sophie's Crepes would be Genki Crepes on 4th and clement. That would be the only place that could possibly rival this place but it doesnt even have the butter sugar crepe.\n\nAnyways, if you like crunchy on the outside, soft and sweet on the inside, ice cream, and a perfectly well balanced, well-made crepe for around 5 dollars..... come here and get the butter and sugar + scoop of ice cream desert crepe!", "author": "simon k."}

The flavor combination of bananas and nutella is good, with ice cream butter, but you can put those things together by yourself. So why would you need to come here? For the crepe, the final ingredient in this assembly, the key to unlocking the perfect blend of the flavors. The starchiness of the crepe was an excellent compliment to the crepe, and this style you can only get here. Just order and you get all you need, easy, fast, and portable. \n\nThe price is really reasonable for $3 you can get a basic crepe and for no more than $6 you can get it totally decked out with anything and everything you might want. It is also extremely portable and so convenient.\n\nFellow yelpers go here! Bring cash or you won't get anything :( \n(it's cash only but there's an ATM machine right there)\n\n\nThe GF got the \"Japanese crepe\" and she adds:\n\"The green tea gelato was good. It had the flavor and texture. The maccha sauce complimented the green tea. The red bean paste was very delicious and also complimented the green tea gelato. And the thin crepe made everything taste betterm, it was like a waffle cone with crepe flavor and thinner and crispy. It was really a Japanese crepe.", "author": "Christopher D."}

We went to the counter and explained the situation and the people are SC wouldn't have any of it! They insisted that we ordered whip cream.  WTF, since when does whip cream and honey sound alike? And they commented that I ate the crepe (yes two whole bites). I explained to one person that I scooped off the whip only to find more inside, but I guess they could only focus on the fact that the crepe looked eaten. \n\n It's annoying to be accused of ordering something that you really didn't and how much does it really cost them to make a banana nutella crepe?

It is very popular for the young crowd after the movies or dinner at Japantown. I stop by over here whenever I visit SF for some dessert crepes there.  So far the crepes are the best I have tasted so far.\n\nMain reason is the crispness of the crepe.

Next I don't feel like eating something sweet that often. If I'm in Japan town, and I feel like something sweet, and whoever I'm hanging out with feels like a crepe as well, then I get a crepe.\n\nOnce you get close to Sophies you'll notice a big crowd of people hanging around. There's a definite procedure so get it right. Do not get behind the people waiting for their crepes, you have to get in the order line first. While you wait your turn in line you'll see a board behind the counter with most of what they offer. Take a good look at the menu but reserve final judgement until you've seen \"Sophies specials\" on a laminated sheet by the register, IMO the specials are the best choices. After you order and pay they give you a ticket with a number.

The different ingrediants they use: avocado, cheese, turkey, ham, egg salad, mayo, and more! I never heard of egg salad in a crepe so I decided to be adventurous and I ordered the egg salad and avocado. Good choice! However, the crepe this time was a bit crunchier than expected.

They leave the crepe on to cook a bit longer, so it ends up being crispier and staying crispy instead of getting soggy. 5 stars for that because there's nothing I dislike more than a soggy crepe.", "author": "April L."}

Ever since they opened way back when and I used to hang in J-town all the time, I would frequent Sophie's for all types of crepes: savory and sweet. \n\nThey seriously make the best crepes because the actually crepe part is perfectly made. The guys working that crepe making machine are experts at what they do. I've been to other places to have crepes and nothing is like this hand held treat you get from Sophies. \n\nI more often than not always get the mixed fruit with ice cream. I had this treat over the weekend and it was still as good as I remember from years ago. Most other places make their crepes too thick and therefore not crisp enough on the outside. They become soggy and don't taste good. \n\nWhats worse is that some places will pre make their crepes. Um, who's ever heard of pre-making crepes? No thanks. I want mine made to order with freshly cut fruit and yummy ice cream. This is exactly what sophie's is. \n\nI think I need a crepe after work now... Savory one for dinner and a sweet one for dessert.

All the fruit was very tasty and fresh. The crepe, maybe it is because I'm from LA was very crispy.

In fact, I think I've lied about not being able to make it to dinner in Jtown and gone over to Sophie's for a crepe instead. Hee hee. This joint is the best place for a crispy crepe. That's right - CRISPY, not soft and fluffy like the crepes you're used to eating. Sophie's makes a thin crepe filled with savory or sweet goodness and rolls it up like a waffle cone for your consuming pleasure.\n\nExpect a LONG LINE (at least 25 minute total for queuing, ordering and waiting) to get your crepe on. Don't expect any nice tables and chairs or serving ware for you to sit down and gingerly cut into your crepe. Your dining experience choices are comprised of three sets of plastic tables and chairs you'd find fraternity guys sitting on while barbecuing in the backyard of their fraternity house and a sad, over-painted and worn out \"courtyard\" area for the three dozen other crepe-mongers to huddle together and eat their crepes. Sophie's crepes were designed for eating on the go so get your ass up and out of the store!\n\nMy fave crepes are the banana and nutella, the California (think of a Cali roll wrapped in a luscious crepe) and the avocado turkey. The sweet crepes are my fave. Or if you think you're hot crepe stuff, you can pick your ingredients to build your own franken-crepe.\n\nSophie's doesn't offer validation for parking so grab a street spot if you can. Take some time to wander around the mall or if it's nighttime, hit one of the karaoke joints. Either way, remember to save room your tummy for Sophie's.", "author": "Dawn L."}

I'm not saying that they're not great because they are. It's that San Francisco crepes do a lot for me.\n\nSophie's, which happens to be one of my San Francisco friend's crepe place of choice, is one of those places why San Francisco makes the best crepes for me. So many choices to choose from and you'll want to eat them slowly to get as much savory moments as you can.

While the crepe was very good, the wait for it was RIDICULOUS. As we were not in a rush, we decided to wait it out. I don't mind waiting for good food, but this wait was horrific in the mall. The line barely moves, it's packed with tons of people, and it was soooo stuffy you can hardly breathe. Do they not believe in fans or air circulation?\n\nAnyways, the crepe was amazing. Definite 5 stars for the crepes. I had the strawberry with nutella with ice cream. The crepe was thin, crispy, and perfectly lightly sweet. I also love the fact that it's portable in a wrapper so you can walk around with it and eat. \n\nThe wait sucked, but the crepe was amazing. My boyfriend's crepe got very messy as the ice cream started to leak out the bottom of the paper wrapper. My friend's crepe was made wrong: she ordered hers with nutella that they forgot and gave her cream instead.

This place seemed cooler when I was a little asian boy from Arizona and visiting and learning about Asian culture, but now that I moved here this place just seems old and the place smelled like bleach. After some dinner in SOMA we ended up here for some dessert.  If you come to a place named \"Sophie's Crepes\" you might want to order a crepe, but I was so full from dinner I didn't want to order more carbs. \n\nSo instead I ordered the Japan Town Sundae which was green tea gelato and some red beans with whip cream. It was decadent and delicious and it almost made me forget how full I was. I almost wanted to order another one but my abs wouldn't appreciate that very much. \n\nOne more thing - cash only.", "author": "James T."}

I double-checked on Yelp - says Post and Webster. Finally it dawns on me that it must be somewhere INSIDE the mall. So today I finally found it. And my reaction is - what's the big deal?\n\nI walk into what seems to be an ice cream shop, only they also have crepes. Or a crepe shop with ice cream? I order the banana-and-Nutella variety and prepare to wait, anticipating some kind of heavenliness. They give you a little slip of paper with a number on it, and I hear my number called in like two seconds. WTF? Did they just grab a ready-to-consume crepe out of a box? It came in a little triangular cardboard sleeve, and it was... a crepe with sliced banana and Nutella inside. The crepe itself was dry and tasted like paper.\n\nIn short - I came. I ate a crepe. I walked away uninspired and wondering what all the fuss was about. And fondly remembering the crepes I bought from a little street corner kiosk when I went to Paris.", "author": "Froggy V."}

The savory crepe we went with was the cheddar cheese and avocado crepe. It was good, but I felt it needed one more ingredient like tomatoes, hot sauce or something. The sweet crepe we ordered was nutella and strawberry.

I came here and got the mandarin ice cream crepe. (Ice cream costs a little extra, but it's worth it!) Of course like most crepe places, the crepes are made to order and you can even watch the guy or gal making your crepe (No pictures allowed though!).  You can sit down right inside the store or sit down in a little plaza right outside to enjoy your crepe. Take your time, they're delicious! They have \"savory\" crepes which consist of meats, like a sandwich. I've yet to try those, but I'll stick to the sweet crepes.", "author": "Tito S."}

It was good, but not up to par. The flavors didn't meld well, and seriously lacking in the red beanage. nuh-UH. \nThe other day, I just had a regular crepe with black sesame gelato.

But the crepes here are a standard to set... a different standard from that of, say, a French crepe purist, but a standard nonetheless. \n\nThe crepe itself is cooked to perfection for its use -- a little dryer and hardier than most crepes, but better-equipped for on-the-go eating (which Sophie's makes mighty convenient with their cardboard sleeve style). The crepe strikes an ideal balance between slightly crispy, but with some al dente chewiness.\n\nHave yet to try anything else, but really, what's not to love about strawberries and Nutella? From what I can tell, they use fresh strawberries (if they're canned or frozen, at least they are devoid of that horrible syrupy goop), and they're generous with the Nutella. Even if everything else sucked, I would still go back for the strawberries and Nutella crepe. My only complaint is that the prices seem to get a little steep when you get into the ice cream and/or fresh fruit territory, but otherwise, just consider it a small price to pay for a little slice of heaven.", "author": "J C."}

I used to go there pretty often, whether for one of their delicious \"lunch\" crepes (turkey and cheddar equals yum) or for a scrumptious dessert crepe - the Japan crepe is awesome. The menu isn't all that extensive, but it has some variety there for those that are picky. Mostly their choices range from fruits (strawberry, banana) and sandwich ingredients (meats, cheese, etc.) to gelato and Nutella. Good stuff to be sure.\n\nOne thing I don't like about their menu - and it's the big thing that keeps me from giving Sophie's a full five stars - is that some of the extras cost way more than they should. For example, while the Japan crepe is around $4.50 (give or take a few cents), the Japan Special, which adds whipped cream, is almost a whole dollar more. Uh, why? Not only do the extras tend to cost more than they should, but they're usually not very generous with them either. Heck, sometimes they're like that with the regular ingredients too, and when you're paying about $4-$5 for an already thin crepe it just dampens the whole deal.\n\nAtmosphere-wise everything is great. Though Sophie's is a tiny place with only three tables inside, there's lots of seating right outside next to Kinokuniya Bookstore. You can also watch the people making the crepes from the large window outside, which is usually what a lot of people and tourists tend to do. The service has never been much of a bother either, so kudos to them for that.\n\nAll in all Sophie's is one of those places you just have to try at least once, especially if you're in the area.

So last weekend i decided that it was time to get a crepe, man i couldnt wait! \nI remember the last time i went the owner was making the crepes herself and they were delicious\nBUT this time i went and there was this guy who was making it. He broke more than 5 crepes and had to throw them all away. I was so mad because there was a ton of people in line and waiting for the crepes and he just kept messing crepe after crepe. I knew immediately that his problem was that he tried to be all quick and flip the crepe over, when he just poured the batter on, so the crepe was STILL STICKING ONTO THE GRIDDLE! oh cmon dont you understand that you are doing something wrong when 5 crepes in a row  have holes in them?! its because you need to wait for them to harden!\nso as he was messing up the crepes, the person who was supposed to fill the crepes obviously had nothing to do and basically the whole store was stalled except for the people who only wanted to get ice cream.\nWell i finally got my Mixed fruit and nutella crepe after a good 25 min. The outer edges were crunchy but the middle was still very soft. I think that says that he needs to keep it on the griddle for a little while longer.\nI dont know if that day the owner had an appointment or if they actually hired this guy to make crepes long term (HE CAN\"T MAKE CREPES!)\ni gave sophi'es a three just because i remembered how it used to be before i went there last weekend (or else it would have been a two)\ni definitely enjoyed it before but i was really disappointed at how my crepes turned out that day.", "author": "Lesley T."}

I'm not even going to attempt to sugarcoat *(no pun intended)* this review just because of the average of four-star rating that this place gets.  Sorry guys - the crepes are three stars.  The 40-minute wait while watching the staff moving in slow motion is negative one.  \n\nSimply put - the No# 17 (Japanese crepe with red bean paste, green tea ice cream and matcha) was tasty, but not blow-my-socks-off phenomenal.  I couldn't have told the difference between Sophie's and Genki if I were to do a blind-tasting, and frankly, I prefer the limited edition Haagen-Dazs green tea ice cream (3 one-pint containers for $10 at your nearest Safeway, get them before they take them off the shelf...) over the one here.  \n\nWatching the process of making the crepes can only be entertaining for 5 minutes.  At 5 minutes and 1 second, the novelty started going down almost exponentially and you are, frankly, left with no option but to twiddle your thumb waiting for your number to be called.  Another 35 minutes later, the process of consuming the highly anticipated crepe took place in less than 2 minutes. \n\nI've never had to work this hard for a dessert.", "author": "Ange L."}

There's thin pancakes with whipped cream, fruit, chocolate syrup and ice cream all served in folded paper. This dessert ice cream cone/fruit sandwich is just the right kind of goodnness after a great meal. If you want to change it up a bit you can always spring for a cup or cone of gelato. Something different like black sesame seed gelato is always a fun try when you're feeling weird or have just had bad indian food for dinner. Or you can go more conventional with cookies n cream or vanilla gelato amongst other flavors. Best thing is that it's quite inexpensive and very good. Although I do feel bad for these folks making the crepes while the people waiting outside for their treats gawk and stare at the skill to make these thin pancakes. It's like who's the caged animal here? The crepe specialist or the folks standing outside salivating in anticipation.

Went here on a Sunday afternoon and there were quite a few people frequenting the place.  There's only three tables, but it spills out into the mall plaza with more seating, so it wasn't crowded.  The staff was friendly enough, and they were quick to take our orders so there was no wait.  I ordered the banana and nutella sweet crepe with vanilla ice cream ($1 extra).  It only took a few minutes for them to produce my order, but my crepe was not warm at all. They advertise \"FRESH CREPES\" but this made me believe otherwise. The crepe is very crispy and they shape it in a hand cone.  It makes it a bit more difficult to eat, and mine felt heavy on the nutella. (I know, who complains about too much nutella??) Because of the shape and the crispiness, you really only eat the top half of the \"cone\" crepe and then the rest just goes in the trash.", "author": "Ellie L."}

It looked like they were very satisfied with the product.\n\n I had the crepe with ice cream (lychee) which pleasantly surprised me.   They had a range of dessert crepes as well as the savoury ones.  I would come back again - it is slightly expensive - my ice cream crepe came out to be about $4+.   I would say it was worth it - loved the texture of the chewy crepe with a hint of a crunch at the edges.  I would recommend it.", "author": "y y."}

It's a pretty small place to eat at as there is probably 3 tables inside.  I heard that this place gets pretty packed and queues can stack up.  We got there at an off time so we just walked right up to the front.  There's an assortment of different types of crepes that you can order.  They also have a full sized gelato parlour in house.  I went with the banana crepe with vanilla gelato.  I was a bit bummed because if you want a different flavor gelato, it cost an extra $2, which is a ripoff.  Anyhow, the unique thing about this place is they serve their crepes in a cone-like shape.  It looks delicious.  The only problem is that it's quite hard to eat.  It also gets pretty messy.  I had the gelato melt and drip as I tried to maneuver it out of the paper dispenser to eat more.  As far as flavor, it taste really good.  The combination of freshly diced bananas with the vanilla gelato and outer crusted crepe is a perfect combination.\n\nMy only gripe about this place was how messy my crepe got when eating.  It literally started to drip off the paper dispenser that they wrap the crepe around (think like how an ice cream cone has a paper wrapped around the cone).  It could just be bad luck by my part that I got a flawed crepe.  I'm down to try it again and probably would do so if I'm back in the area.", "author": "Christian M."}

I thought this place was going to be as good as people said and considering the crowded line I was excited to get a crepe from there. The price was pretty expensive ranging from $4- $6 and additional toppings cost from $1- I don't know ( it depends). I don't think their crepe was that good...I've experienced better. I had a little bit of raw dough ( or whatever that gooey paste they used to make the skin of it) so I had to throw that part away..", "author": "amandaaa s."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-08-20", "description": "I am really picky when it comes to crepes because I used to eat crepes all the time when I stayed in Paris with my family. In Paris its typical to just get a crepe with butter and some sugar, so when I saw the large selection at Sophies, I was a little overwhelmed. So me and my friend decided to share one savory crepe and one sweet so we can try two different crepes. The first one had chicken, tomatos, and avocados. It was pretty good the hot crepe combined with the buttery avocados was a nice change from the typical sweet crepes. But the avocado was soo slippery that it kept sliding to the bottom of the cone, so it was hard to get the perfect bite of chicken, avocado, tomato and crepe. We also got a sweet crepe with whipped cream and berry jam. It was real simple, but I love the combination of whipped cream and berries, and the blackberrie jam was really good. But again, the toppings kept falling to the bottom so it was almost like eating a pastry bag and all the cream and jam would squirt out of the bottom. Next time, I will just take it out of the cone and refold it so stuff doesn't leak out the bottom. A pretty good crepe, but a bit expensive for what it is.", "author": "Samantha T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-23", "description": "I LOVE Sophie's Crepe... and it's a must-go for me when I'm at Japantown. They carry high quality gelato that can be put in the crepe. They have flavors like: red bean, green tea, pistachio, vanilla etc... My favorite is their fresh strawberry with nutella crepe... (with a scoop of red bean gelato if I want to indulge myself that day)! Keep in mind though that you cannot change your order once you place it... so double check your order and receipt before you walk away. The price is a bit steep for a crepe... It can cost close to $8-9 for a crepe. The lines are LONG during the weekends. I remember having to wait close to 40 minutes once for a crepe! (*I was told the wait would be 15 minutes) Normal wait time... is close to about 15-20 minutes though. They have only 2 crepe pans... and normally about 2-3 workers trying to put together the crepes. There isn't much of a seating area inside the restaurant (about 3 tables)... but you can enjoy your crepe outside (there are benches) outside and by the bookstore.", "author": "Loretta T."}
