I had such high hopes for the venue and event; I challenge yelpers to find any kid of the 90s who wouldn't be excited for a 90s dance party.  I mean there's such great dance hits as \"Groove is in the Heart\", \"What is Love?\", \"Rhythm is a Dancer\" ... I could go on and on.\n\nSadly, I didn't hear many of the great 90s dance hits and in fact, I'd say about half the songs were actually from the 00s to the present (not the 90s).\n\nMy disappoint was compounded by the fact that I experienced the first thing I've ever experienced in my life: a bartender refusing to make a drink for me on the grounds that the bar is a \"dive bar\" and then walking away.  Well excuse me.  Last time I checked, dive bars do NOT have dance floors.  In any event, I consider that to be so incredibly rude and disrespectful of a patron.  Thankfully, there was another bartender who very politely made my drink after I reminded him how to make it. For those of you wondering, it was a Harvel Walbanger (OJ+Vodka+Galliano - all of which they had).\n\nAt the end of the day, I doubt I'll be going back to the underground but you never know, time makes crappy experiences seem somehow better.", "author": "Banana S."}

It's small, it's divey, it's unassuming. But perhaps I like it because it's a gay bar outside of the ever-straightening Castro. \n\nUnderground SF hosts a lot of weekly or monthly parties. For me, the nights to go here are definitely Saturdays. 1st and 3rd Saturdays are for the ever-popular Cockfight, where the bar is FILLED with MEN-- and very few annoying drunken Castro queens. Go-Go boys takeover the bar and stage-- usually one has a panda head.\n\nThe second Saturday was reserved for Mall Madness-- a bubblegum pop night with music and drag, although this will be going on hiatus post-June. Currently, newish party Indie Cent is thrown on the fourth Saturday, with indie-electro music and drag.\n\nThe bar itself is narrow and long, with the bar to your right. The bar tenders are mixed in taste but almost always shirtless. There are a few short stairs that lead you to the dance floor-- depending on the night there is a stage. There is a smoker's patio in the back (albeit small) and the line for bathrooms can get ridiculously long, since there are only two single-stall bathrooms. \n\nNeedless to say, this bar has quickly become my Saturday night home and it's definitely a place I recommend people go when they need to escape the mess that is the Castro on Friday or Saturday night.", "author": "Bryan B."}

Drunk and Horny seems to be the current party pulling for this bar.  While it was fun sometime about last year in 2005. It's evident that this event has outgrown this venue.  Getting drunk is a challenge within itself...pay the $5 buck cover then get crammed into the narrow bar as if you were getting shoved onto a commuter train in Japan.  Seriously, pushing your way to the bar takes some mad skill!  A couple of spilled drinks, getting your feet stepped on, and some aggressive shoving gets you to the equally packed dance floor.  \r\n\r\nDance or just attempt to or just stand there and get unintentionally groped to the campy 70's-90's music.

But kudos for doing something outside of the Castro mold...looks like you got em' where you want them!\r\n\r\nWhat began as Drunk and Horny has transformed itself to Sober Horny and overcrowded, and the crowds seem to grow larger by the week.

Your liver is telling you no but do you ever listen to it? NO! You walk through the entrance which leads into a small dive bar with music blaring and the smell of vodka, funk, and old wood comes at you in great force. You look around and notice everyone is wasted and having a great time. You pause to take this in because you love getting wasted in Dive bars. \n\nTo the bar you head where you start off with the first drink. The drink being 99% vodka and 1% red bull, you will not earn your wings. You will be drunk and joining in on the crazy scene which introduced its self moments ago. Up two steps you go and head to a dance floor packed with people. Its rather small but just enough room to get in and show the others you can move. \n\nNow hot and ready for some air you head to the back where an enclosed patio greets you. The patio is packed with smoker, a few people who are passed out, and tons of patrons sharing stories. This dark gloomy bar has won over your attention. You head back to the bar 5-6 times and repeat the steps above. \n\nThen you come into work with 2 hours of sleep and yelp about it!\n\n\n\nThe Top.. oopps Underground SF..", "author": "Jay D."}

I don't, in any way, consider this bar to be maintaining the status quo. With that being said, let's get into it.\n\nI used to go here when it was still a kept secret and not the crowded hole it is today. Back then it was fun. A lot of cute boys having their mai tai's and cosmos talking about nothing I care to hear in the front of the club. People getting down on the dance floor as you go towards the middle and then the cool crowd of hipsters, hippies, you get the idea....hanging in the back. Never crowded but just enough people inside to make it feel like it was still a good night to be out.\n\nLet's Pan over to Late 06' - Current 07'.\n\nFun as this club was/is. I don't envision myself coming back here for a while. I was charged a different cover for entry than my friends in front of me were, it's too crowded on the inside and people really should learn to tread lightly, or at least say excuse me...Rude. It takes half the night to get a drink in this fucker, only to have them make it wrong and have to stand in line again-The latter happened to me twice. Another time I came in there was this black guy chillin in the middle of the stairwell with 3 or 4 snakes on him, not my kind of party. Apparently the danger of 4 wild reptiles doesn't bother Underground SF....thats whatev. To make it all worse. This place has it's bathrooms right in the middle of the dance floor. It is hard to dance with someone when you have a long as line dividing you. \n\n3 stars for awesome memories. -2 stars for things I'll never forget.

Let me tell you someone should have called the Fire Marshall. All of Castro was in that one tiny space.We were able to make it to the front of the bar after much grabbing and rubbing. Then it took the bartenders a good 10 minutes to get us a drink although we were right there. The crowed was so cute it wasn't cute anymore. It was so pretty even I couldn't stand it anymore. This is one place were they should have a crowed control and not let in more people than they accommodate.   My friend and I stood near the front of the bar finished our drinks and were out with in 5 minutes.  I don't think I will go back there again.", "author": "Teddy d."}

This place should not be considered a \"Gay Bar\" It does have a gay night on Saturday nights and also one of their monthly parties but the rest is various themes.\nThe themed parties are definitely the strength of this place. It totally depends on the party as to how many and what kind of people will be there.  They do also have weekly clubs like the Tuesday night Drum and Bass which is always good.\nThey have a Dub Step party once a month which is pretty good. It's basically like drum and bass and the crowd is cool. \nThe best thing about the place is a monthly party called \"Die, Die, my Darling\" which is the name of a Misfits song. As you can guess it's mainly horror punk and death rock, 1 dollar drinks that look like you're drinking blood, and Blood Wrestling!! That's right. Not mud wrestling. Blood Wrestling!!! Which is pretty much unprecedented as far as I know and for a $5 cover charge it's WELL worth it. \nAlso I'm in agreement with the other reviewers about the bathroom setup. Being a guy, it's not too bad because the door is over in the corner of the dance floor, but for the girls their door is right in the middle so they have to wait right in the middle of the dance floor to go to the bathroom. Other than that it's a cool place and the bartenders there OWN!!", "author": "Dave C."}

I made the mistake of coming here on a Saturday \"Drunk and Horny\" night - purportedly the biggest gay party in town - with four gals and two gays.  I got pretty much what I expected: sweaty men without shirts (and, in some cases, pants) rubbing up against each other on the overly-crowded dance floor.  If that's your thing, you should be all over it, but it was all just a little too much for me.  No, wait, a lot too much for me.", "author": "Rachel B."}

You best sweat out your beverages, b/c the goings on in the bathroom are vile. However, being the only female there of a Saturday night is not a bad thing, trust me.", "author": "Gretchen T."}

Who knows.\r\nAnyway, the first time I went it was a blast. Good music, HOT boys and crowded in the good way. Drinks are on the strong side - to say the least. The only downside was that the line for the bathroom is basically on the dance floor. No very convenient for the dancers or the people in line.\r\nOn a side note, is anyone else afraid that those big rotating cubes are going to fall on somebody?\r\nThe second time I went, even more fun. More of a crowd, HOTTER boys, better music..blah,blah,blah\r\nThen, as with all good things, word seemed to get out. When I say get out, I mean that they must have put up a billboard in Fremont. (No offense to those people in Fremont - what am I saying? They don't have computers in Fremont so no one is going to read this anyway :) )\r\nThe last few times I went it was TOO CROWDED. Where the hell is the Fire Marshall? I mean you couldn't walk...literally. I waited 30 minutes - 30 MINUTES! - for drinks. Talk about a buzz kill. Strangely enough, I still managed to have a good time. Haven't been back in a while. Maybe I'll check it out again, but next time I'm wearing an asbestos suit in case the place catches fire. God knows, no one will ever get out.", "author": "Jamie M."}

I like that i trip either on the stairs to the smoking area or to the dance floor or on someones feet. I dont know why. I also like that it is in a small space, and yet I dont feel claustrophobic like i do in bar which is a big space. I go only for Drunk and horny and yet find that people are neither, or the fact that I dont register when people check me out, which I dont, can I get some ass grab people? I will give you the evil eye if I dont like you but I still appreciate the ass grab. mmm ass grab.

It gets four stars for the time warp. I go here to support my friend III (pronounced Three) cuz he does fucking dope visuals for trance music. Granted, his visuals and many beer make trance tolerable. And thats the time warp. I was never a raver, but i made the beats and crap rolled up DJ's would spin. But dude, this was like 1994, before i had ever heard of dark drum and bass, which is the only electronic shit ill listen to. The inside is pretty well cut up, and has a pretty sweet, but creepy patio. Kinda looks like the patio  Corbin Bernsen and the snakes get you cornered in, in your dream. Funny story, there was this party in Baltimore, B'More as the kids call it, and this kid is hard trippin in X, and ...who the fuck am i kidding. Nothing about Ravers is funny.

I had only been once before, 2 yrs ago, right after I moved to sf. I think it was during drunk and horny. It was totally crowded so crowded I couldn't move, and I left approx 5 min later.  so coming back now, it seemed like a whole new place. Parking is horrible around here. That is the worst drawback. Other than that, the club is a small but comfy space...bar in front, a lil dance floor at back, slightly elevated dj booth at the side. The sound system is better than the transfer, where that club nite had moved from.  This is definitely not a fancy club, but I like that type anyway. Oh, and water was only $2!! CHEAP!!  Oh and the other bad thing was although it wasn't packed, the club was HOT. I was wearing a skirt and tank top but was still dying of heat (hence the water). Don't come wearing a lot of clothing.  The coat check was charging a couple of dollars but the only thing I could see where the coat check sign was, was a bench with people's jackets thrown onto it. I wouldn't pay for that.  I know a lot of different club nites are moving themselves over to this venue, so you should be able to have a good time.", "author": "Merredith L."}
