That's how you know this place is legit yo. \n\nYou order at the counter from a congenial Italian dude and pay at the register. Then, you will be given a number and escorted to a vacant table where the server will bring you your food. The basic concept is that you can customize your pasta any way you like - (1) choose your preferred pasta (linguine, ravioli, spaghetti, etc.), (2) choose your sauce and (3) choose your add-on's (like meatballs which were a tad too salty for my liking).Voila - you got pasta magic.  \n\nService was quick and attentive. Vibe is casual with a customer based comprised primarily of couples and families. There isn't much seating and it does get cramped at times but they manage to get people in and out fairly quickly. Price point is very fair for SF with most pastas starting at $10 and the portions are huge.", "author": "Laura Y."}

Freshly cooked pasta just tastes soo much better. My first encounter with homemade pasta was Pasta Sisters in LA, then Il Corvo Pasta in Seattle, and now, The Italian Homemade Company! My friends and I made the trek out to SF on a Saturday through some pretty horrible traffic and I must say, I wasn't too upset about it after seeing and tasting my Taglitalle Pesto dish. \n\nThe pasta was about $13-14 dollars and for the portion size, that's a great price! The pasta had a nice bite and chew to it and there was plenty of pesto sauce to coat each noodle with just the right about of sauce. I'm sooo glad that there is a closer location in the East Bay (Oakland). \n\nThis restaurant is a self seating type of spot. Place your order at the front, take a number, and find a table. The food comes out really quickly. They offer several noodle shapes and sauce types. Definitely check this spot out if you're a pasta lover! \n\nP.S.

I know the next time I'm in the area I'm planning on having a meal here- I actually really just want to try their pasta with just a bit of the spicy oil the have available next to the cheese and pepper. \n\nBut for what we actually ate when we visited: gnocchi with pesto and tagliatelle with bolognese.

You can purchase pasta by the pound and make it at home too.\n\n2. You order at the front and sit yourself down. They bring the food to you but you have to get your own water and napkins. It's a very causal environment. Great for quick eats or a quick bite with friends. \n\n3. I went around 1-2pm on a Saturday and it was pretty empty. People started to fill in a little once I sat down. But no wait.\n\n4. The interior design is lovely. It's very hip and you can watch people make the pasta right in the front. It's nicely decorated but does still a little crowded with the furniture set up (even when its empty).\n\n5. The service workers were kind and helpful.\n\n6. The food is pretty good. The noodles were a little on the uncooked side. I'm not sure if that was intentional or not as my friend said that's the way they eat it in Europe.\n\n7. The prices are well-priced. Very affordable, especially in SF. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this place to a friend or a co-worker who is looking for a quick, reasonable-priced bite.

The shop is pretty casual--order at the register and the they will serve it to you at the table you sit at or order to-go. Pick your pasta type, and then your sauce and add the price together.

I got the meatball bolognese with noodles, my husband got the lasagna, my friend got the meatball platter with flatbread and we all shared a pesto gnocchi. I definitely enjoyed my bolognese. It was delicious, although the ratio of sauce and noodles were a bit off. There was too much sauce and it sorta drowned the noodles. The meatball platter was equally good with 7-8 gigantic meatballs. Great flavor and I'm sure very filling.\n\nI had really high hopes for the lasagna as my husband and I are big fans of it. When he got the lasagna, there was definitely too much sauce. He could barely find the noodles. Needless to say he wasn't impressed with the dish. He said the flavor is there, but they need to tweak the ratio of noodles and sauce a bit. The pesto gnocchi was ok. I think the pesto had too much basil as opposed to Parmesan cheese. I would have also preferred the gnocchi to be somewhat browned as it adds more flavor.\n\nBUT the biggest disappointment of all is that they were out of their famous panna cotta. I was so bummed so we opted for the tiramisu which turned out to be quite amazing. The cream was so light and fluffy.

Guess you gotta come here early for their specialties! \n\nIn terms of location, wish it was closer to Bart, but there's lots of shops and restaurants to check out around the area. \n\nMenu was pretty simple. Pick a pasta and pick a sauce. You order up front first and then find a place sit. And they'll bring the food over to you. We ordered the gnocchi with butter and sage, the ravioli with pesto, and the lasagna with meat sauce. We got the ravioli and lasagna first, but the gnocchi took a little while longer to come out of the kitchen. \n\nYou could really taste the homemade sauce and pasta. The pesto was really similar to the ones I've made at home. It was really flavourful and delicious. Same with the ravioli. The stuffing inside was mixed well, and well seasoned. I was not a fan of the butter sage though. It was quite bland. It tasted like the sage had not steeped into the butter enough. It was definitely flavourful around the sage leaves itself, but there wasn't enough of it throughout the whole dish. The gnocchi itself was a nice chewy texture. Though, I would have preferred it to be pan seared as well for some crispiness. I started dipping the gnocchi into the meat sauce for the lasagna as there was quite a lot of it and also because it was really good.\n\nOverall, I really liked 2 out of the 3 pastas we ordered.

Everyone loved their dishes and portions are much bigger than what it appears in pictures. It's so cool how they make the pasta right there too!\n\nWe started with the meatball platter. It tasted so delicious! It was more than enough to share as an appetizer among 5 people. I even saved the sauce to add to my leftovers the following day heh heh heh. \n\nI ordered the fettuccine with Bolognese sauce and it was incredible! Super fresh, perfectly cooked pasta. And the bolognese sauce was so rich, flavorful, and satisfying. Perfect dish on a cold SF day. \n\nOther people got the pesto, which also tasted really great! Good balance of light, garlicy flavors. \n\nWill definitely be back for more fresh pasta at very reasonable prices!", "author": "Carolyn L."}

However the pappardelle was clumped together at some places so it was still partially raw and flour-y. The parts that were cooked were good though. Doesn't seem too hard to cook pasta nor does it take that long. The pasticciata sauce is a creamy Bolognese (tomato meat) sauce. I could swim around in this sauce. My dining companion had the meat lasagna with an extra meatball. I had a bite of both and they were both pretty good. But the wait and service is so slow. We decided to come here for dinner one night. It was around 8 on a weekend. We waited a while to put in our order, even though there were only 2 groups in front of us. I don't know if it was a lot of questions or just too much small talk. We stood around for 10 minutes before a table opened up. Then we waited another 25 more minutes for our food to come out. No, that's not right. We also ordered a full order of flatbread. That came out a few minutes after we sat down. So we got to enjoy it before our food actually came out. I really would've liked it with my food. But just ate it because it was hot. They also have a weird way of serving you. No numbers. They take your name and will kind of call it out. Or you can do what we did and leave your receipt with your name on the table and they're look for it. Seems time consuming. I would like to come back and try their gnocchi and have more of that pasticciata sauce. But maybe I'll have to call ahead and get it to go.", "author": "Alison W."}

I ordered the b\u00e9chamel sauce on top of the lasagne and the sauce laid on top like it was frosting. I felt like the order I got was sitting there maybe somebody else ordered and didn't pick it up and I ended up being the Shum that ended up getting it. I wish I took a picture of it before I tore it apart to examine the rest of the lasagne. It was really dry, and you can tell cause when I opened up the lasagne you could see the old oil. I'm so disappointed what a waste. I know they could do better and are better but my order today was terrible, I will never order their  takeout again.

I was hoping it'd have more flavor based off the rave Yelp reviews, but it fell flat and I found myself adding red pepper flakes and salt. If you are hoping for Olive Garden-esque taste, you won't find that here. There was little to no garlic flavor in the sauce, and while it was very creamy, it didn't taste much like cheese either. More like a milk cream sauce. BUT - the fresh pasta was pretty darn good.\n- Boyfriend ordered some tagliatelle with Bolognese; this was okay and definitely had more flavor than the white sauce, but still didn't have the boyfriend scraping the bowl for the leftover sauce.\n- Side of meatball: This was probably the best part of the meal, very hearty and yummy\n- Truffle Burrata Salad ($16): Way overpriced for a salad without any truffle flavor. I was disappointed. Also could have used a lot more dressing. I will give the burrata credit - it was fresh and creamy\n- Mozzerella salad: Was okay, nothing special, could have easily made this at home for way cheaper and, again, it was underdressed\n- Wine: We ordered the Sangiovese for the bolognese dish, and some other lighter red for the white sauce dish (the cashier recommended this, I would not go with it again as usually white wines pair better with white sauce). Serving sizes of the wine were also very small considering how much they cost.\n\n\nAmbiance: 4/5 stars for casual dinner spot\n- HOLY COW, those bar seats are SO uncomfortable. We ended up getting up and moving to a table. Nothing like having a notch in your crotch.\n- The dining area was fine, nothing special, just some tables, very casual. Might be a good spot to grab a quick lunch with a friend.\n\n\nValue: 2/5 stars\n- We walked out of here with a $100 bill. Was the food worth $100? Definitely not.\n- We both ordered a pasta dish and a salad, and while we were pretty full, we would have still been a bit hungry if we had only ordered the pasta.\n- I probably won't return unless to buy their fresh pasta to take home and mix with my own sauces.", "author": "Amanda R."}

I came here with my friend on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't packed at all. Two other people came after us, seeming like regulars at this place, and I'm sure if I lived around here, I'd come regularly as well. \n\nFOOD:\n1) Pappardelle with Pesto (4/5) - This is a thicker pasta, and the texture was chewy, almost a bit too perfectly cooked for me. I think I would have preferred it a bit more cooked. The pesto sauce was very fresh - it's not those all green pesto sauces you normally get. Instead, you see the bits of basil combined with olive oil, allowing you to really appreciate the fresh pasta. Although when the portion comes, it might seem like not that much, it was very fulfilling and satisfying by the time I finished since it's quite a rich dish. \n2) Meat Ravioli with Parmigiano-Reggiano White Sauce (5/5) - My friend got this dish, I took a bite, and was quite blown away! First thing that came to my mind was the sauce - it's soooo smooth, but the cheese flavor was just amazing because you could really taste it. But at the same time, it wasn't overwhelmingly cheesy in my opinion as even when the dish cooled, you didn't see the sauce becoming denser. Then biting into the ravioli itself, you experience the chewiness of the pasta combined with the very soft, finely processed meat. I've never eaten ravioli like that - most that I've had contained your traditional ground meat texture. I thought it was great, but my friend said she preferred the ground meat texture. \n\nPARKING:\nCan be a bit of a pain. There's a lot of street parking, but I also saw a parking lot nearby.

Last time I checked, I paid for my food and if I say that is salty, is salty. I don't care if anyone else hasn't complained. Food was disgusting! And customer service was even more disgusting. I speak Italian so please if you're going to talk bad about your customers in front of them also make sure they don't speak Italian. Ignorance at its best!!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-04-02", "description": "It pains me to write this review; I've been a loyal customer since 2015. My boyfriend and I have had many memories here, even bringing friends and family. Food-wise, the quality has gone down and it is way overpriced for what it is, but we kept going for food in the same style of the region of Italy that my bf is from. However, after our experience last night, we will never be back. Upon ordering, you receive a paper with your name on it to put on the table. The servers call out your name and find you. Usually my bf orders, but I ordered for the first time last night. The paper has my korean name (Minjung) and when the server came out with my order, she walked around the restaurant twice with an angry face, not even attempting to call out my name or look at the tables. She went to the back and I saw her show the receipt with my name to two other Italian guys. She then made a disgusted face and said my name \"minyuuuung???\" like \"ew what is this name\". Unluckily, we were seated by the back and saw this happen. Later on, my bf told the staff that if a name is too hard for them, just say the last name or something but don't make a face, and they said something (I couldn't fully understand since it was all in Italian) about pronunciation. I came in and said that it isn't about pronunciation, I don't care if you mispronounce it, but you shouldn't make a negative face at anybody's name. A male staff member then proceeded to FOLLOW ME OUT OF THE RESTAURANT while arguing that I was wrong, I can \"believe what I want\" but that didn't happen (note that this guy was not even present when the incident happened) and that the server is just very expressive with her face. I said yes, she is, which is why she clearly made a NEGATIVE expression regarding my name. He then proceeded to loudly tell me that they are not racist, he has known the server for years and she is not racist, and they serve many different people of \"other races\" all the time. I didn't even mention racism until this point, I simply stated that she made a negative expression at my name, which my boyfriend and other people around us also saw firsthand. You can make your own conclusion as to why he had to be very defensive about being \"not racist\" when I hadn't even mentioned it, but to me it's very clear. There are many other great Italian restaurants to support (Bella Trattoria comes to mind); we will never be back.", "author": "Sally P."}

While the food is the same, the experience is so different. \n\nThe vibe at the location in North Beach is charming and is one of the reasons I love going there. They use paper plates and is set up in a way where quality homemade pasta is the focus. \n\nThe Marina version fits the neighborhood. It's a little louder, a little more upscale, and a little more dressed up. (The prices are the same though which is good!)\n\nIf you're equidistant from both locations, I'd go to the location in North Beach for the ambiance but if you're much closer to the location in North Beach and all you care about is the eating part of the dining experience, you'll be happy at either.", "author": "Charles L."}

We ordered one of the special salads - arugula, walnuts, pears in a very good vinaigrette and a garden salad - greens, cherry tomatoes, radishes. The first was very good, the other fine but s bit overdressed. Then my wife had fettuccine with bolognese - the pasta was good but the sauce salty. I had the vegetarian lasagna. It was so salty it was almost inedible and I only at half of it. Five hours later my mouth still feels parched. There is no reason for food to be this salty. And it is a shame because if not for that big flaw it was the best lasagna I've ever had. \n\nAnd the food wasn't inexpensive - no drinks and it was over $40 not including tip.

We were all excited to try it because we'd never had fresh pasta before!\n\nI ended up ordering parpardelle (long, wide, flat noodles) with pasticciata sauce (bolognese + bechamel). Like I said, this was my first time having homemade pasta and I was so impressed! The noodles were chewy and had a texture that is incomparable to boxed pasta or even pasta you get at most restaurants (which is probably boxed pasta, now that I think about it haha). I don't think you can go wrong with any of their pasta choices. The sauce was really good too because the bechamel added a certain creaminess to it. They also have parmesan cheese and pepper flakes in little containers so you can add more to your dish!\n\nMy friends got their pastas with the meatball sauce and the pesto sauce, and I liked both! The meatball sauce seemed like the most worth it, price wise, because it came with the most meat! Definitely give that one a try if you are hungry. The pesto was also very noteworthy because you could tell how fresh it was. Definitely not from a plastic tub, probably made in a blender in the back or something. Delicious!!!\n\nThe portions are pretty big. I ended up saving half for another day! Service is also especially friendly.

I ordered tortellini, a personal favorite, with pesto sauce. My food was so bad I had to force myself to eat it just because I didn't want my friend to know I hated this restaurant she loved. The pesto was so greasy, and yes I know it's made with olive oil, and the flavor overpowering, not balanced at all. The worst part of the experience was my tortellini which were still raw. They were chewy and had that line through the middle of the dough that tells you it's severely undercooked. I tasted my friend's food to see if maybe it was just what I ordered. She had a meatball which was not good. It tasted like the meat in Moussaka, which I thought odd considering it's an Italian dish and not a Greek dish. Her pasta was still tough, but at least it was cooked more than mine. (And I like my pasta with a little bite, just not a leathery one.)\n\nI still desperately want to like this place, because it is run by an Italian family and has authentic cuisine.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-09-07", "description": "Ah, I hate to be that one, but I wasn't blown away... My friend chose this place specifically because it had 4.5 stars and the experience was just very underwhelming to me, which makes me sad because I was pretty excited. \n\nUpon entering it's very easy to see that this place is a little more on the modern side. As with most places the struggle for space is real. A lot of small tables and a sign asking you to not save seats, but wait until you order. Although the person behind us didn't do that and ended up taking the seat we were going to go for... \n\nTortellini was sold out that night as was a specific sauce, disappointed that I couldn't try the tortellini but I had other options. \n\nMy friend got the meat ball ravioli with meatballs and I got the Gnocchi with white sauce (bechamel/cream/butter). \n\nService from the cashier was nice, nothing to complain about or praise. Although do not expect any other service really, this is like a hybrid of a quick serve type place. Aside from a worker/manager over hearing my friend ask my opinion of the place and attempting to see if we were satisfied no one will refill things or ask if everything is alright. It's a get in and out type of system for them to provide the most turnaround for their tables. \n\nI'll start with the positive. \n\nMeatballs: Really good. It was my favorite part of both our meals and I didn't even order it. Very savory and good flavor. They weren't as juicy as I think some would expect, but they weren't dry, overall most enjoyable part. \n\nMy friend said his ravioli was okay, he wasn't as blown away as he thought he would be by the reviews and this was exactly how I felt about my gnocchi. \n\nI love gnocchi and I know the texture it should be and mine was mushy. Even my friend who doesn't eat that much italian said it was on the softer side. There was a lack of firmness that made it taste very mashed potato-y. I could obviously have had it sent back and asked for a new one, but what if that was just how they made it? I also didn't want to wait again for a plate of food considering the line of people, so I ate it. Now I'm not saying it was awful, but the plate was just very underwhelming compared to what people say. The sauce for me was too light and the gnocchi was too soft. Adding salt and pepper helped with flavor, but the texture was a big disappointment. \n\nPerhaps it was bad luck or maybe we didn't choose the right dishes, but I had higher hopes unfortunately. I don't know if we will be back, but I'm glad to have tried the place out at least.", "author": "Jay K."}

Everything is priced a la carte. They also have sandwiches, salads and lasagna. Everyone seemed to order pasta which was what I was here for too.\n\nI got the gnocchi with brown butter sage sauce. The gnocchi was light and fluffy and the sauce was well done. The sauce was nice and rich, though maybe a little more sage would have been nice. I also paired it with a sangiovese and my friend and I split a garden salad.\n\nJust a warning, the flatbread with meatballs etc isn't a flatbread sandwich. The flatbread is very thin, more like a tortilla. My friend was surprised but not displeased.\n\nThe prices here are reasonable but can add up. The gnocchi and wine plus tax and 15% tip were $27.

You can tell the pasta is fresh and the sauces handmade. I've tried four of their dishes now. All amazing. I felt a wave of melancholy during my final bites.

It's decorated simply but strike a clear note as a modern Italian kitchen. Not a ton of seats but enough for a reasonably busy night. \n\nThe only ding was that the waiters struggle to handle busy crowds. We asked for Parmesan twice and never received it and someone else's flotsam decorated the table we took the entire meal. Not a biggie, as the waiters were polite and reasonably attentive.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-01", "description": "4 stars based on how legit these noodles were! I got the lasagna (meat) and my favorite part was definitely the noodles. Lasagna can be a gamble for me because I don't really like ground beef and prefer sausage or sometimes vegetarian more. But the reviews were good and I always like to try a lasagna the way it's suppose to be made at least once, in hopes of finding the best one out there.\n\nThere were reviews saying it's too salty and I can see where they are coming from. It is on the saltier side, but for someone who is sensitive to salt, I wasn't too offended with the salt level. The amount of meat that was on this dish was insane though. More than I cared for, so I scraped some off. It also wasn't as cheesy or saucy as I would like. Most of the flavor came from the meat, and it was in fact sitting in a puddle of grease from the ground beef.\n\nYet, I am still giving this place 4 stars because I knew what I was getting myself into when I ordered this dish. And I know for next time whatever I'll let myself order something that is sure to please.\n\nA little about the experience:\n\nThere was a long line, but it's not ridiculously slow or anything. You can watch the pasta dude roll out long sheets of pasta while you wait! Prices weren't bad. $10-15 for pasta depending on the noodle and sauce. Carafes of wine were in the $21-25 range and only served 3 (somewhat small in my opinion) glasses.\n\nAfter you order you find a table, which can be a tad tricky but the food comes out reasonably fast so people are in and out. \n\nIt seemed like all the workers were legit Italians too, so that added to the authenticity of this place!", "author": "Kelly G."}

The menu is simple, you choose your noodle, sauce, and any other add ons.  They also have other entree options to choose from.

And we communicated our excitement to each other using only wide eyes & dancing eyebrows when we heard two separate Mommies ahead of us order frozen pastas & ready-made sauces for dinner tonight. This place had to be good.\n\nWe each ordered a special: mushroom with a rigatoni-shaped pasta for him, puttanesca for me with a spaghetti-like pasta. (My apologies, I can't recall their carbolicious names.) \n\nWhen the plates were brought to our communal table, we noted the skimpy serving size first & the fishy aroma wafting off of the puttanesca second. I ordered it knowing there were anchovies in the recipe, but wasn't concerned because I'd had this dish (& other dishes containing anchovies) before. Offensive to the point of not being able to take more than two bites; I got a fishy, greasy taste with both forkfuls. I took several bites of his pasta just to get the taste out of my mouth. His dish was simple & good, but the one-note flavor profile was not exciting to him. \n\nMy order was definitely a mistake; I should've stuck with ingredients like butter, oil, or marinara knowing how picky I am. I'd give them another try because I like the idea of creating my own pasta/sauce combo...pappardelle with butter next time, perhaps.", "author": "Fancypants X."}

Choose from a selection of fresh pastas made onsite by hand and tossed with one of a handful of sauce options. I was glad to be here with my parents and brother, everyone open to sharing. We tried the special of the day- spaghetti with cacio and pepe (cheese and pepper, very good), the talgliatelli with marinara sauce (fine, but not my fave), and my fave the paparadelle with butter and sage sauce (yum!!!). The pastas were all perfectly cooked with just the right amount of springiness when you bit into them. \n\nWe also split 3 salads. First least to most fave (1) the roasted tomato salad which was basically a single piece of tomato topped with toasted breadcrumbs over mixed greens, (2) the special of the day- arugula salad with chunks of asiago cheese and lots of sliced red pear. Unfortunately, they loaded it with pine nuts (yuck) instead of the promised walnuts, but I was able to pick around them, (3) definitely do not miss the burrata salad- mixed green salad topped with a good size chunk of creamy fresh goodness. I asked for dressing on the side since I find places typically put too much for my taste, but the small dishes of oil and vinegar provided were tough to stir into a dressing. No matter, the greens were fresh and though a splash of vinegar would have been great, the salad was actually fine without. I didn't love the flat triangles of bread that came with the salads- we ended up leaving most all of it behind. There wasn't enough sauce for dipping and we were all pretty full by the end anyway.\n\nSeating is pretty limited, but we were lucky to grab a table just walking in on a Friday night around 7:00.

What you get for the price is more than enough and tasty!

It comes with sauce you can dip it in. They put the utensils and paper napkins in the bag which helps because I usually forget to put those in there. I always ask for more parmesan cheese for our pasta. The one thing I wish they would do is make pizza. But you need a brick oven for that to do it right. \nI am so glad they opened up so close by.

Both the pappardelle and ravioli were cooked really well, and the sauce was rich and hearty and coated the pasta in a delicious, velvety, meaty coat. The sauce that comes with the meatball is bolognese, so you basically pay an extra $1 for 2 medium meatballs. Both dishes were served piping hot with freshly grated parmesan on top.

Not those dried pasta noodles from a box. But this review is to rave their Panna Cotta dessert. I was lucky enough to be able to order a dessert from Caviar deliver service-menu and saw the dessert section, between Panna Cotta/Tiramisu. Decided to give myself a treat, since the same amount of gas is required to deliver my main entree. I'm SOO glad I decide to try it. It is probably the best Panna Cotta I've had, from any dessert menu (better than some 5-star's dessert menu). It was lightly sweeten, very creamy/cream flavored - topped with a smokey caramel. So many other panna cottas have failed me where it either tasted like vanilla jello or creme brulee mix. Not this one!

As soon as you walk in, they are making the pasta in front of you and it looks amazing. The service was great. We ordered a sandwich, ravioli with the white sauce and the thicker noodles with meat sauce (I don't remember the names). I really liked the white sauce while it was hot, although it tasted like 30% butter and 70% heavy creamer. Once the sauce got cold it seemed to thicken and taste really gross. The ravioli hardly had any meat or anything in it. You could barely see anything.\nThe meat sauce was very dull and plain to me. \nThe sandwich was extremely salty. \nThe drink choices were very limited. \nWould not come back again.", "author": "A M."}

The pasta and ravioli is cooked al dente.... And the perfect al dente! \n\nI had the crab ravioli and it was simply amazing. It didn't taste overly crabby and the sauce was not overwhelmingly rich.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 had the pappardelle with the pasticciata sauce. His sauce was creamy not greasy and tasted like heaven. It was savory but not rich! No tummy ache from greasy foods is always a plus for us (: of course we had to try a side of meatballs and they did not let us down. Super tasty meatballs and we were glad we got them on the side. \n\nOur entire meal cost $33! Such a steal for legit homemade Italian food. I've never had anything like this before!!! \n\nWe bought a pound of prosciutto for $22! Machine cut. Cheapest prosciutto ever!!\n\nWe have found our new go to place for pasta and prosciutto (: you can even buy their pasta and sauce and just make it at home!!! So yumm!!

My order took more than an hour to arrive, only the pasta was included and it was cold. The container was completely smashed, there were no utensils, napkins, NOTHING. The receipt that was stapled to the bag listed both of the items that I ordered yet somehow one of them didn't make it into the bag? How do you miss one of only two items?? On top of all of that... the pasta was basically inedible. 100%, completely flavorless.

One of my \"GO- TO\" straight pasta joints in the city (there is another place,  but it's not JUST pasta. That review is coming.) TIHMC is consistent,  tasty, good price, and portion size and friendly service. The shop on Union is my choice because it's easier to park if you drive (other is on Columbus).

Pesto,  marinara,  butter & sage or Bolognese(meat sauce) Nice variety, without being overwhelming. Go early afternoon or during the day and watch the pasta being made. Pasta is cooked just right,  quite filling and the sauce is satisfying (though I've had it once when it came out a bit salty) The Cassone (aka calzone) are hand made and are a good portion,  with ample filling. Tasty! One other thing is,  they do have veggie options for those who prefer it (veg ravioli, lasagna) When you're in the Marina or just want good pasta, check this place out. By the way,  grab a passion fruit gelato on the way out,  if you find you have room left.", "author": "R A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-10", "description": "My friends like to make fun of me for eating dinner early.  Like 5 PM early.  Grandma status.  I always argue that when you go early, 1) you never have to wait, 2) you get better service, 3) your food doesn't have to sit in your stomach, trying to digest when it's bedtime.\n\nAfter an afternoon of volunteering at the SPCA, Husband and I walked from Pac Heights to The Italian Homemade Company to have a nice hearty pasta dinner.  Though we'd passed by and knew this was open (used to be the American Cupcake Kitchen), we just never had the chance to actually go in.\n\nIt was just before 6 when we walked in, and all the tables were actually full already, but the bar seating (not really a bar, but it overlooks their refrigerator where they store fresh pasta for sale) was empty.  There were a few people ahead of us in line, so that gave us time to peruse the menu.\n\nThe choices are simple: pick a type of pasta (all homemade, including fettucine, tagliatelle, pappardelle, lasagna), then pick a sauce (marinara, bolognese, cream-based etc).  Then if you're sitting there to eat, you pick a spot, and they bring your food out to you.  You can also buy the fresh pasta and pre-packaged sauce to go to cook at home.\n\nAs soon as we ordered and sat at the bar, the line developed, and by the time we were done eating, the line was almost to the door, and it wasn't even 6:30 yet.\n\nWe both went for meatballs (2 + bolognese sauce), and I had the fettucine while Husband got the tagliatelle.  Both plates were piping hot, the noodles were perfectly al dente, the sauce was DELICIOUS.. but my meatballs were super tough, dense, hard and dry.\n\nHusband thought his meatballs were fine, so maybe he got a different batch?  I ended up giving mine to him, and he ate it without complaints.  Maybe I'm just used to meatballs that are super tender and fall apart easily (Dobbs Ferry's, for example).\n\nThis place is no doubt one of the best places to get fresh pasta for a decent price in the Marina, if not the city in general.  It's not fancy, but it's a cozy, laid-back spot to grab a quick bite.", "author": "Tori S."}

The sauce is thick (almost like a alfredo sauce) and pairs wonderfully with the tortellini. \n\nMarinara Sauce on anything - I have been pretty disappointed with the sauces at a lot of italian restaurants in San Francisco, but Italian Homemade has created a perfectly simple marinara sauce that tastes fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the gnocchi or the pappardelle. \n\nMeatballs - grab a side of meatballs drenched in a large portion of the meat sauce.", "author": "Matt S."}

The line was pretty much out the door and stayed that way the entire time we were there. Seating is limited and we counted ourselves lucky to find three adjacent bar seats. \n\nThis place is cool in that you can watch the pasta being made from scratch, which means the food is super fresh (we assume anyways). In addition to pasta, ravioli, and lasagna they also make closed panini sandwiches!\n\nA minor disappointment though was when we ordered, they had run out of pasta -_-. So I ordered ravioli with meatballs instead. I also ordered a sausage, onion, and cheese panini but later on when they got around to making it, they realized they were out of sausage! So in the end I didn't get to eat the things I wanted to try, but the food was still all right nonetheless.\n\nI also didn't think the meatballs were as good as they were hyped up to be. They were really, really dense which I wasn't quite expecting (but maybe that is what authentic Italian meatballs are like), and they weren't really hot on the inside, probably because they are quite large and dense. \n\nI will say the pesto sauce looked super, super green, in a good way. I wished I had gotten that instead of the bolognese sauce. \n\nAnyways, definitely would come again to try more of their food.

My boyfriend and I were looking for someplace to eat on Union St the other day and came across The Italian Homemade Company on Yelp. The owners here are very nice (and actually Italian!) and knowledgeable about ingredients which is important if you have food allergies/dietary restrictions. \n\nI'm vegan and was informed that none of their pastas are vegan as they are handmade and have egg, but that the gluten free pasta was an option. Apparently they are working on adding some vegan pastas in the future which is good. I settled for the gluten free pasta with marinara sauce. I feel like it's fair to judge an Italian restaurant by their marinara sauce - it's one of those things that's hard to screw up but also hard to do well. Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by their marinara...it just didn't have enough flavor compared to Zero Zero or Delarosa, to name a couple.\n\nMy boyfriend had the meat ravioli with butter and sage sauce. His feedback was that it was good but nothing to write home about. My other issue with this place is that each pasta was $14. I know that it's Union Street but $14 for a plate of pasta at a quick service restaurant is a bit steep (especially a basic pasta with marinara, no meat).\n\nIt sounds like the owners are making modifications to their menu and this place is right around the corner from me so I would be up for giving it a second shot in the future.", "author": "Sarah S."}

You pick your sauce, type of pasta.  The pasta is handmade, cooked well and delicious.  We tried the pasticciata sauce (probably spelled it wrong sorry) on gnocchi.  The gnocchi were really solid, the meatballs-tender and delicious and pesto on tagliatelle.  The pesto was flavorful.  Also had the meat raviolis, interestingly the edges were a bit tough and the filling did not standout perhaps overwhelmed by the bolognese. Probably the weakest part of our meal were the red sauces.  The Pasticciata and the Bolognese were both flat, it wasn't a salt issue but rather a lack of any other flavor.  The bolognese had quite a bit of oil floating in the dish...which detracted from the dish.  We had the burrata salad also...plenty to share, salad was a touch overdressed.  I would comeback though and try different items..the pasta itself was a standout.  This for me is a soft 4 star.

I'm so glad we got to try so many of their dishes plus have a few of their desserts. The decor of the restaurant is totally hip and I love the idea of ordering at the counter and paying. Everyone that we spoke with was clearly Italian, they had really thick accents and were really sweet explaining the menu and different types of pastas and sauces that were made. You can actually watch someone making pasta all day long it seems because we ate there at different times of the day yet there was always someone making fresh pasta. It was great and the food was great. My marinara sauce was so light and delicious. And the tiramisu!!!Awesome sauce! make sure you pronounce it correctly or else they won't understand you!! Tttt tiramisu with a t. Now I've never been, but they make you feel like you're in Italy!", "author": "Cheefong J."}

Our friends were visiting all the way from Vallejo and had a craving for pasta so we decided to go here due to its pretty good reviews. We came here on a Saturday at 7pm and a direct quote from the manager as we stood in line for about 15 min was, \"We are 70% out of our menu. You only have the option of to go.\" How is anyone 70% out of their menu on a Saturday night during peak dinner hours?? We still decided to eat here since we were the next ones up at the register. The cashier was very rude and told us that we couldn't order anything but salads, raviolli, gnocchi, lasagna, and this gnocchi roll. My friend inquired about the gnocchi roll asking her TWICE if it contained pork because he couldn't eat pork. She confirmed TWICE that it only had spinach and cheese.  When paying for our meal, she was hovering over us like an eagle ensuring that we give the restaurant tip making us feel extremely uncomfortable. After waiting for another 25 min to get our food, low and behold..there was pork on top of his gnocchi roll. I'll give a star to the manager who came by and said he'd make us another one, but seriously, we asked the lady twice..how does she not know?! What if it was a deathly food allergy!\nProbably won't  be coming back here EVER again. The employees are very rude and not worth my time.", "author": "Kristen T."}

A great little Italian escape right off the route from wine country to San Jose when you take the city route.  Lasagna was fabulous.

It was good and would come back especially to try the gnocchi roll, which they were out of, and the pesto. \n\nI like the idea of being able to buy pasta by the pound to cook at home. \n\nI have a critical comment, but this is easily fixable. well-made and fresh pasta needs to be topped with fresh-grated cheese. Mine came with the ancient powdered Parmesan, the kind you see in shakers at hole in the wall pizza places, like the kraft sawdust shaving stuff, all sprinkled on top. This took the meal down a star for me. Just didn't make sense with a place with such a focus on fresh ingredients.", "author": "Megan N."}

I have had the pleasure of experiencing many meals prepared at the restaurant and also a Private party catering by them on Telegraph Hill.   The pasta, the sauces, the sandwiches and, not to be forgotten, the tiramisu, were all extraordinary.   The Italian couple that opened this space not long ago are committed to genuine Italian cuisine using the finest ingredients and a commitment to technique that is all too uncommon in restaurants of any sort in this country.  While local politics have made it difficult for them to obtain a liquor license, they have continued to produce the finest Italian cuisine in the extraordinarily competitive market situated in the North Beach area. Bravo!\n\n In particular, many of the Italian sandwiches are simply unavailable elsewhere on the west coast and perhaps only available in this country on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx or a short list of other truly Italian neighbourhoods.  You will quickly become an aficionado of Italian sandwiches by dining here!\n\n If you seek and utterly authentic, professionally prepared food and with he warmest of experiences, the Italian Food Company is the place for you. Highly recommended.", "author": "William D."}

At about $14 per pasta dish, I found the portions to be small, and the seasoning to be bland. I'm pretty biased, as I've enjoyed many home-cooked Italian American meals with family. Pasta or a serving of the flatbread with meatballs and sauce is their best dish I've tried, but I found it needed to be spiced up at home afterwards.  The pesto and salad were both deeply disappointing. I hope this new branch improves as time goes by and that the value rises those SF price points.", "author": "J B."}

I ordered to go a MORTADELLA (thinly sliced meat)  sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes and onions.   The place was not busy and the owner took my order.  He said it would take 5 minutes.   In about 2 minutes a server brought me a small box and told me it was my sandwich.  I questioned her and said \" are you sure it is a Mortadella sandwich\"?  and she assured me it was.   I got home and when  I unwrapped it, there was no Mortadella in it and instead it had MOZZARELLA (cheese).  Not only did the owner screw up the order, the lettuce was wilted and the bread was soggy.   And, all of this \"joy\" was at a cost of $14 and change.   Suggestion if you order to go.

My wife got the meat ravioli with the butter & sage. She really liked it, & it wasn't my favorite. So I'd say each dish has a district flavor, which I appreciate, & is authentic.

The sandwich with tomato sauce and mozzarella was bland/messy, and there was grated cheese inside (which put me off) and none of it had melted.
