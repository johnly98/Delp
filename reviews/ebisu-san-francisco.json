My latest visit for lunch was still great, but not as stellar as previous times. \n\nWe usually would get one roll then some nigiri, but this visit we were more looking for rolls. We got:\n- Gyoza appetizer\n- #29 roll (Deep fried Salmon, Yellowtail, Shrimp, & Scallion wrapped with Fresh Tuna)\n- Family Affair roll (Unagi, Crab, Avocado, Tenpura, Shrimp and Cucumber)\n\nWe really loved the family affair roll, but weren't impressed by #29. The salmon inside the roll was very dry. And unfortunately, my boyfriend got a huge bone in one of his bites. The gyoza was fine, but not super flavorful. \n\nThis was more of a 3-star experience, but giving 4 stars as every other time I've been it's been much better.", "author": "Jessie K."}

We got the gyoza and miso soup to start but they ended up coming out at the same time as the sushi. The yellowtail nigiri was delicious and really crisp, definitely a highlight of the meal. We got the Behind the Green Door roll which was also tasty.  Ordered Kobe beef kushiyaki and it was amazing. \n\nThe service was also very fast, which is always a plus in my book.

You either park close and pay, or risk having your window broken. Ebisu is close to the park, which has lots of parking, but it's at your own risk. The bums can be sketchy.\n\nFriends from Vegas were in town. They wanted seafood, but nothing raw. So the safest bet was sushi. Ebisu got great reviews, so we decided to meet here.\n\nDinner scheduled at 6:30. Our friends put their name down for a table around 6, and the wait time was about 30 minutes for a table of 4. The seating is very cramped inside. I'd suggest sitting at the bar if you're alone or just a party of two.\n\nI personally love raw fish and was eyeing the omakase, but nobody wanted any and I didn't think I could finish it all myself. My boyfriend and I ended up getting an order of mixed tempura and 2 rolls. \n\nThe tempura had a good mix of veggies and shrimp, but the batter was too thick. That plus not frying long enough resulted in uncrispy tempura. \n\nThe two rolls we got were the dragon and Tokyo tower. The Tokyo tower was disappointing because it only came with four pieces. I'd have to say that they do put more shrimp tempura than most places, but I couldn't get past the size of the roll. The dragon roll looked really nice, but taste wise, it's what you would expect from a dragon roll. \n\nI guess I came here with high expectations because of the reviews, but it fell a little short. Maybe because everyone raves about the omakase and that's what we didn't get! Definitely something to consider getting if I come back.", "author": "Tiffany N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-14", "description": "I could go to Ebisu once a week for the next year and it would not be enough! This is quite possibly my new favorite restaurant in San Francisco. I almost didn't go to Ebisu as my friend asked, but then my Hinge date bailed on me so I didn't feel guilty about trying a new Asian place near where my friend lives. \n\nFirst off, location: good location in the Inner Sunset, near UCSF Parnassus and some Metro Muni lines. I haven't spent much time in that neighborhood but really liked the vibes I got from walking around before and after dinner. \n\nSecondly: lines. My friend and I got there just before 6 on a Friday night and were seated immediately. Shortly after, a large line appeared and people were waiting both inside and outside! Luckily there's lots of cute shops to explore in if you have to wait. \n\nThirdly, the food: the best part. There were so many cold and hot appetizers to choose from, so many entrees, so many sushi dishes, and specialty rolls, my friend and I spent a good 15-20 minutes figuring out what to order. We decided to split everything: the 49er roll, kakuni, 1-2 person Omakase, and matcha creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \n\nThe 49er roll had salmon, avocado, tobiko, shiso, and lemon. We were hesitant to try it due to the lemon but it worked! It was a thin slice and brought a unique tang to the roll that I wouldn't recommend for everyone, but I enjoyed it. We did not try the Dexter Carter but had considered it. \n\nThe kakuni appetizer was TO DIE FOR. The fatty pork belly tasted caramelized, and, like the 49er roll with lemon, fruity due to a satsuma sauce. 10/10 would recommend the kakuni. \n\nThe omakase for 1-2 people was plenty for us! It came with tuna, salmon, butterfish, yellowtail, amberjack, and halibut. The butterfish and amberjack were surprisingly perfect (they were the pale-colored ones I think), but they were all good and fresh and hearty slices. I believe each one came with 3 slices each. It was filling and well-worth $28! \n\nEven though my friend and I were stuffed, we went ahead and tried the matcha creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The wait and trip out to the Inner Sunset would be worth it just for this unique dish. There was a thick layer of mousse beneath the crispy burnt top layer. The bottom layers were colder than that layer on top. It came with a thin shortbread-like cookie with matcha filling that was alright--the main focus was on flipping matcha creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e! A must-order. \n\nLastly, service: some other reviews here said service wasn't very good or professional, which was the opposite of my experience. Everyone working there was calm, knowledgeable (I asked which sashimi was what at least three times), warm, and kept filling up my water cup! They politely and discreetly tried to get us to leave to flip the table by giving us the check early and asking if we wanted dessert when we still had some sashimi left on our plates, which is to be expected. \n\nBathrooms could be cleaner but they are gender-neutral. \n\nTLDR: amazing restaurant with great service. Order the kakuni and matcha creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, as well as a specialty sushi roll. Well worth the cost and trip to the Inner Sunset.", "author": "Lizzie S."}

Given we rarely venture into the Richmond and or sunset we were presented with a wonderful opportunity to venture outside the city (while still definitely being in the city, but you know what I mean). \n\nArrived at around 5:30 on a Saturday and waited about 30 minutes for a table of 4 (not bad at all). Service was quick and sushi was delicious, this place is definitely worth the hype for a mid to high end sushi. Everything was fresh and completely delicious. \n\nItems of note:\n- Oysters- seriously amazing, you must. Large, covered in tobiko, and definitely something I will be thinking about for days to come. \n- Agadashi Tofu- I personally just love it, the order was huge, 8pieces, perfectly friend/ breaded (prob the wrong term). \n- nigiri sampler- delicious, as you would expect and the maki roll was great, light fresh, clean (salmon, cucumber, shiso) \n- Romeo and Juliet roll- I personally loved it. Not a fan typically of mayo on rolls but coupled with the scallop it was delicious and the perfect creamy bite!\n- uni nigiri- pricey at $18, but delicious and don't for a second regret it\n\nWe had other things, but the takeaway is that everything was delicious and prices are reasonable.

Regardless, they served sushi insanely fast. Another perk was the atmosphere. The inside of Ebisu is swanky- floor to ceiling wood, with no windows, yet bright lighting.\n\nAll of the sushi is standard price. I ate a King California roll with real crab, a tuna cucumber roll with malleable fish and thinly sliced crunchy cucumber, sake sushi, and one piece of syrupy tomago for dessert ($25.50 in total) Each roll was cut into eight pieces, and a little shorter than a traditional six piece roll. On the outside, extremely sticky rice with loads of (almost excessive) vinegar produced an acidic tang. A hint of lemon mixed with the sweet king crab was another interesting flavor profile that I experienced, in addition to very salty salmon in the sake sushi. It tasted as though the salmon had leap from the ocean onto my plate, salt water and all. Even the simple rolls possessed complex flavors. I can only imagine how the special rolls must taste!", "author": "Cecily T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-07-06", "description": "disclaimer: 4 stars for appetizers, 2-2.5 stars for the sushi experience. This will be a super long review since we went all out :)\n\nCame here on a Saturday around 6:30pm, waited about 45 minutes for a table for 4. The hostess in charge of the waitlist seemed grumpy (at least she was equally indifferent to everyone I guess....).\n\nOnce seated, the food was served very quickly after we ordered and the waitresses were really nice and friendly. \n\nAppetizers:\nKobe (Beef) Sashimi -3.5 stars- always heard about this raw beef sashimi but never actually tried it, wasn't sure if I would able to stomach raw meat but it was fine! The meat was unsalted, soft and chewy. It came with a small plate of soy sauce, which was good, and three types of spicy sauce, which I did not like so I skipped.\n\nSake Steamed Mussels -4 stars- I really liked this appetizer but it was very salty. I liked the flavors in the soup containing a leafy green (spinach?), shiitake mushrooms and dried scallops in a sake/soy sauce soup base I think. Glad we made the switch to mussels based on the waitress's recommendation, she said it has a bigger portion than the clams.\n\nGindara (Sake kasu marinated black cod) -5 stars- almost missed this gem! Very tasty, the fish practically melts in your mouth, the smooth garlicky (sake kasu) sauce was also very good. This was definitely our favorite appetizer/dish of the night. The only unfortunate part was the small portion size since it was an appetizer, we had to savor every last piece \n\nOyster Dynamite -4.5 stars- YUM! Oyster and sea urchin covered in tasty mayo and tobiko sitting in shells that rested on top of mounds of salt, be careful not to accidentally eat some of the salt on the bottom! I think that may be why my family complained that it was \"too salty\".\n\nHotate (Bacon wrapped scallop) -2 stars- just as simple as the description says, nothing special. Can be skipped.\n\nSeafood salad -2.5 stars- was just okay, just sashimi pieces and imitation crab mixed in with seaweed salad and some type of balsamic vinaigrette. Would not order again.\n\nSushi:\nDespite this being a sushi bar, sushi is NOT what I would recommend at this restaurant. Sushi rice is bad quality and the quality of the sushi got progressively worse with every dish presented at our table. \n\nFamily Affair -3.5 stars- this was one of the better rolls of the night.\n\n49er -2.5 stars- We usually go for this roll when it's an option at sushi places because we like that sour, refreshing lemon taste that goes well with the salmon but the slices of lemons on this roll tonight was TOO RIPE and a little bitter/salty- ruined the roll for us.\n\nRomeo & Juliet -3 stars- nothing special.\n\nCherry Blossom -1 star- this was the last sushi dish that arrived, some of the pieces of salmon sashimi was starting to turn grey and it was just nauseating. We were so upset that we had to bring it up to the waitress, who listened but didn't offer anything to make up for it.\n\nDessert:\nMatcha Creme Brulee -3 stars- I had expected this to be a hot or warm desert but the creme brulee was a bit cooler than room temperature when it arrived at the table. Nothing extraordinary about this green tea-flavored creme brulee, it was okay but not something that I would highly recommend. It comes with a thin wafer cookie that had green tea cream filling, which was pretty good.\n\nMochi ice cream -4 stars- packed with flavor! We tried green tea and mango flavors.\n\nIn conclusion, YES to appetizers and NO to sushi here.", "author": "Amy T."}

It's not my favorite place as there aren't too many things on the menu that stand out, BUT I've been here half a dozen times and have never been disappointed with anything. The fish is always incredibly fresh and their Omakase sashimi is truly a work of art. I've never seen a more beautiful and creative presentation. And I love how they take away the shrimp head and bring it back all fried and crispy. Yum :) The bento boxes are also great if you want something filling and affordable. Definitely try the uni if you're a fan and the toro ain't too shabby either. \n\nThe decor is earthy and modern with beautiful wood paneling and strikes the perfect balance between casual and intimate. The servers are all very friendly and if you snag a seat at the bar, the sushi chefs will strike up a conversation with you.\n\nI have recommended Ebisu many times to friends who want quality sushi and a pleasant atmosphere.

An oyster with uni, quail egg and ponzu? Yes please! But was it worth $17?! Absolutely not! Way too pricey for one oyster. Even if it does come with uni. The clams were actually a pretty good serving. I believe I got about 25 clams. But they were super tiny. Not much meat. The sauce it came in had great flavor, but I found it a touch too oily. The sashimi platter was okay. I got three small slices each of 10 varieties of fish. Not the freshest I've had, but okay at $28.\n\nI had asked for an itemized receipt so I could see the prices of each item. There was something listed as a Special item: Box at $2.93, so I guess they charge extra for takeout items? I wasn't quite sure what that was for, but whatever.

My boyfriend had me decide between Mokutunya and Ebisu and I chose Ebisu because I figured it'd be cheaper than the other place. Hopefully?\n\nEbisu is located on Irving St and it's on a pretty busy part of the street and parking is all on the streets and metered till 6pm. Because my boyfriend and I came here so late at night we were actually able to find parking on the same block so no hassle there. \n\nEbisu looks small. Once you walk in, you're in a waiting room that has one table and 3 chairs. Odd. We walked up to the hostess table and luckily we didn't have to wait for a table either. The overall atmosphere and look of this restaurant was pretty nice. \n\nThe menu itself is quite a read. There was a lot of options to choose from whether it was noodles, sushi, or appetizers.

The fish could have been fresher, it was borderline slimy.  The Louisiana Hot Link roll lived up to it's name surprisingly.  It hardly tasted like fish and moreso like meat.

I saw some of my friends get the Omakase sashimi which I had been skeptic from ordering.  It wasn't worth the $28 price tag.  Most of the fish seemed like very small cuts, and it didn't seem too special at all.  \n\nFor a place that got a Michelin recommendation in 2014, the place doesn't seem like it has kept up with SF standards.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-03", "description": "Been going to Ebisu for over 20 years. This place is always crowded for dinner and they normally do not take reservations. So either you arrive early for the first seating or expect to wait up to 1 hour or more. In its early days Ebisu was definitely the only game in the Irving side of town and one of the few good Japanese restaurants actually owned and managed by Japanese in the City. Now Japanese restaurants are all over town, but most are run by Chinese or Koreans. It's like there are almost no Italians left in N. Beach these days behind the Italian restaurants.  Despite the increased competition Ebisu remains one of the top goto restaurants in the City for sushi and Japanese cuisine over the years. That in and of itself is impressive as most restaurants do not last so long under the same owner. Fortunately there are now many more high quality Japanese restaurants in the City for those of us who no longer feel the need to wait in line. Even if the food is good , it's no longer worth the wait when there are other choices now. For me It is more enjoyable to do lunch at Ebisu. The food is the same, entrees are slightly cheaper, more specials during lunch and better access to a table or bar seating, and you can have a normal conversation without the noise in the evening. Chirashi is a good deal for lunch. The fresh live uni and scallops are always delicious when available. All the nigiri sushi selections are always fresh and the fish sliced consistently to a thickness that goes well with the rice. The rice is one of the things that distinguishes this and any other Japanese restaurant in my opinion. Here the sushi rice is usually well prepared with the right level of starch and vinegar content and the texture of each grain of rice can be individually appreciated. Most run of the mill joints run by Chinese or Koreans don't serve authentic sushi rice. As for rolls, Ebisu is one of the originals in town. One can't go wrong with any of their rolls. My understanding is that rolls, other than Tekka and cucumber wrapped in nori, however, are not indigenous to Japanese sushi cuisine but invented here like pizza or burritos. You will not find rolls in a real Japanese restaurant in Japan. Thank goodness for the evolution of rolls, however, as they are beginning to catch on in Japan. Ebisu makes some of the best originals and new ones keep coming over the years. I would probably give Ebisu 5 stars for being around  for so long and maintaining consistent quality over the years, but the long dinner wait generated by the hype in general takes one star off in terms of overall dining experience.", "author": "Giovani T."}

It has great food, very good service, and the ambiance/buzz you'd want for a first date or to impress someone on any occasion. \n\nIt's just more high end than I'm looking for. That's a compliment, basically. It's at a level you could imagine -- and people do -- come to this area just to eat here. The places we prefer are more local; you probably wouldn't drive to get there.\n\nAnyway, Ebisu is probably the single best Japanese restaurant in the Inner Sunset. That would be a consensus opinion. I do eat here for lunch, because the other options at that time are clearly a full level below Ebisu. If I were dating, I'd come here for dinner.", "author": "Frank W."}

My bf use to hate sushi-he's tried it many times from different places, but for some reason started eating it after I took him here. There is always a long wait on the weekends, so be prepared for a wait. I usually come here during slower hours because I don't like to wait to eat.\n\nThis place is amazing. Great quality sushi for an affordable price. My go to sushi spot in the city. I would definitely go out of my way to come to this place.\n\nI've tried everything here from the rolls to the bento boxes to the Chirashi bowls. Their steamed sake mussels is a must try as well. It's really good! You can't go wrong with anything off the menu.\n\nWill be back again and again.", "author": "Jessica S."}

The quality of the food here is on par with places around town that cost way more.The fact that their prices are reasonable makes this place a great value. It's in a small place in the inner sunset but definitely worth the wait. The service here is good, the wait staff typically are running around the place because its usually busy but I've never had any issues. If you get a chance I'd recommend sitting at the bar with the sushi chefs, they always provide excellent service and can really direct you to the best fish they have for that day. They serve other Japanese dishes which aren't that bad but if you're coming here stick to the sushi and you won't be disappointed. Most of the rolls here are on par with other places in terms of creativity, variety, and size. My recommendation is to get the nigiri. They have an extensive list of fish which are always of high quality and be sure to ask about the specials of the day which can really be a bright spot. My favorites are the sake toro (salmon belly), unagi (eel), otoro, and waygu. The sake toro and otoro just melts if your mouth. The unagi is cooked just right with the perfect balance of sauce. The waygu which I don't see everywhere was something I tried on a whim was a pleasant surprise and is one of my favorites as an interesting change of place to regular sushi, wagyu itself melts and tastes amazing but definitely different from sushi. I haven't had any sushi or rolls here that I didn't like and for the prices they charge you'll want to come back for more.", "author": "Peter P."}

Let me fill you in :)\n\nDespite the wait, my friends and I were able to get the much coveted seats at the bar. We also enjoyed quick and attentive service from both the sushi chefs and the waiters. Everyone is so friendly here! My friend recommended a lot of dishes to try out because she's been to the place many times before.\n\nWe started off with the Hamachi Toro, the Salmon Toro, and the Monkfish Liver. WOW. The Hamachi Toro was my favorite of the night, because it was such a smooth texture and fresh flavor. I felt like my mind was blown, it was so good, like I've never had anything like it. Mind you, I've had my fair share of rolls and just begun my Chirashi mission at Japanese restaurants...\n\nThe monkfish liver was by far something that surprised me. My friend described this dish to me as something like foie gras, but from monkfish. It tasted like caviar! With a super subtle hint of lemon as well. I would order this again! \n\nWe also got mussels, which were good as well, and it came out as a soup, and there are so many mussels! WORTH. The broth was also very flavorful, a bit of spice to it but not overpowering at all, very well seasoned.\n\nWe got a couple more dishes as well, but I unfortunately can't remember their names :( But let me tell you, it's so refreshing to find such a gem. I haven't ventured out to the Sunset area too much, but I will definitely be returning again! \n\nI'll be dreaming of that Hamachi Toro, yum!!", "author": "Amanda L."}

I personally found the 49ers and Romeo&Juliet rolls my favorites - the salmon is very fresh. Also highly recommend the Kobe beef skewer. Not sure if it is actually Kobe beef (as I have tried that in Japan), but nevertheless, still very savory!\n\nFor set menus, I highly recommend the shioyaki saba -- the mackerel is so juicy and tender, and salted to perfection.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-18", "description": "Let me first start off by saying that every sushi aficionado is entitled to his/her opinion on what the best sushi place is...\n\nThat said, I have found incontrovertible proof that, in my honest opinion, Ebisu is perhaps the best sushi experience I have had thus far. To make things short and simple, here are my 7 paths to Nirvana that I experienced.\n\n# Path 1: First Impressions\nBecause of budget constraints, I have never really taken the time to explore fancy sushi restaurants, so I am not well versed in the vibe of what a true sushi bar looks like. But stepping into Ebisu, I felt like I was in another world. Immediately after you step across the lavender curtains, you will feel like you have crossed into another part of SF that you have never seen before. On top of the aroma of tempura and the lovely interior decor (i think they recently remodeled), I felt right at home. \n\nThe menu is very lengthy and exquisite. Don't be turned off by the prices (it's not that bad), and but be turned ON by the wide selection of sashimi, rolls, appetizers, etc. After a long debate with my friend, we ordered the Okasame, Toro (albacore belly), Family Affair, and Romeo and Juliet. Now, here goes...\n\n# Path 2: Okasame. \nIn Japanese, Okasame means \"I'll leave it to you,\" which is a fine and beautiful name. The Okasame, is basically a chef's selection of sashimi for you and possibly another person to eat. My friend and I got the $25 one, which included, halibut, skipjack, escolar, tuna, salmon, hamachi (I think that's all?). It's definitely safe to say that each one had its one unique, fresh, flavor that I have never experienced before at any sushi bar/ restaurant. The hamachi and escolar in particular were very fatty and mouthwateringly delicious (melts in your mouth).\n\n# Path 3: Toro\nOMY, THIS IS THE ONE. Even though this one was a bit pricy, YOU HAVE TO GET THIS ONE. Sometimes it's not offered or they're out, but ask! The taste, texture, and everything in between is too hard to describe, so please do yourself a favor and check it. You get two pieces, so share with a friend!\n\n# Path 4: Family Affair\nFirst of all, I usually don't get rolls (yuck, California), but the descriptions on Ebisu's menu, on top of their fancy names, caught my eye. The Family Affair -Tuna, Avocado, Albacore, Maui Onions, Negi,Tobiko and Spicy Aioli- was definitely something I have never experienced before. So many flavors in one!!!\n\n# Path 5: Romeo and Juliet\nCan it get better? YES. Romeo and Juliet-Scallop, Salmon, Avocado, Tobiko and Japanese Mayo- definitely stole the show for us. With every mouthwatering bite, you not only taste the soft, fatty, texture of the salmon, but you also experience the chewy goodness of scallop. That... plus the mayo! \n\n# Path 6: The Atmosphere\nIf you ever have the opportunity to sit at the sushi bar, make like Shia Labeauf and DO IT. I had my initial hesitations about sitting at the bar (less quiet), but it's safe to say we had a blast. Our chef (forgot his name :( ) was so funny, kind, and everything in between. He answered any questions that we had and made our time a memorable one! And next to us was a funny drunk couple who was served by Sazuki, apparently a sushi chef who rivals that of Jiro. We're definitely checking him out next time. \n\n# Path 7: The generosity. \nHowever, what really made our experience was the generosity and kindness of our chef. Seeing that we were curious about a lot of the items, he generously let us try some! For example, we got to sample this roll (i forgot the name omg) but best yet, he let us try Sazuki's famous kobe beef. Even though we only had a small slice, I think I was in heaven haha.\n\nOverall, this place is THE PLACE that I have been looking forward to. Maybe you have found better, but I honestly had a blast and felt really bad leaving. In the end, the total was about 69 (add another 13 or so for tip), which was a lot less than my WTP (I was thinking it'd be 100). But check this out yourself.\n\nEat well and prosper my friends,", "author": "Bryan W."}

The sushi rice on some of my other nigiri pieces were also quick to fall apart when picked up with my chopsticks- definitely a no-no for such a highly rated sushi spot. The hamachi kama was super dry and needed to constantly be dipped in its accompanying sauce to be edible. Additionally, with the restaurant closing earlier than their 11pm posted time, we were rushed to order any additional items before the kitchen closed. The servers became sloppy and looked like they just wanted to get out of there and go home. They were also busy just chatting amongst one another. Due to the time crunch, I was unable to order any dessert, and the server didn't bother to ask me. It was only after the fact that they told me that it was now too late to order dessert. Geez! Plus, the server forgot to pack some of my leftovers as I had requested. Overall, sloppy sloppy sloppy. There are truly better sushi restaurants to spend your $$ at in San Francisco.

This experience, however, warranted taking the time to share my thoughts.  I'd been to Ebisu for sushi once prior to my last visit and thought the sushi was great.  I went for the second time on Saturday and the experience was quite different.  While seated at the sushi bar I saw a cockroach crawling along the bar.  Our waitress just killed the roach in our presence and acted like it was no big deal.  She didn't seem concerned. In fact, her lack of concern indicated to me it was not the first time with these creepy crawlers...at the sushi bar! \n\nHaving witnessed an insect crawling next to an area where food is located reflected poorly on the sanitation and cleanliness of this restaurant.  The unprofessional reaction only made things worse.", "author": "Maggiebui B."}

However, this time I decided to come and put my name down and just wait because I'm a good friend. And then they immediately called my name and oops my friend was like 30 minutes out. I think if you're flexible with seating and come in a small group, 2-4, you'll get a table quickly.\n\nWe splurged on a bottle of sake, some sashimi obviously and it was pretty fantastic. They have a pretty big menu, so if you want miso cod, etc. they can def make your dreams come true too. Also, I saw o-toro on the specials menu..... $18 I believe they said for the nigiri.\n\nFriendly, effortless service, which is amazing considering how busy this place is. On the pricier side, but it's worth a splurge sometimes especially when your friend decides he's going to take you out for flaking on you the other night. :D", "author": "Vivian H."}

I'm disappointed, SF yelpers!!\n\nI got a good variety from the menu and each item was mediocre at best. The sushi rolls were minuscule with barely any fish and mushy rice. It tasted like rolls from an AYCE sushi buffet place.\nWe got ankimo (monk fish liver) and it was crumbly. We order ankimo often and Ebisu's quality was quite bad. It needs to be like pate: creamy and flavorful. This was definitely not it.\nOrdered the hamachi collar. You canNOT overcook this baby, it needs to be just right to capture the buttery, softness of the meat. We got a tough, seemingly days old product that tasted like something from a chain restaurant.\nGot the unagi don. Holy jamoly, the unagi was oversauced, mushy, and BLEHHHHH. The rice was mushy too -- how do you screw up rice?!\nSame with the edamame , seemed old and mushy -- how do you screw up edamame?!\n\nAll of this mediocrity cost us close to $90...wtf.\nSo sad to have wasted my trip to SF on my day off here.\nAlso, it's nice that the sushi chefs are light-hearted and have fun but at certain times, their jokes and rowdiness were at the brink of unprofessionalism. One of the sushi chefs was claiming loudly, almost in a proud manner, that they were still waiting for their fish delivery and trying to get rid of their older fish. He was also eating pieces of sashimi in front of us as well as tossing pieces of fish to the other sushi chef across the bar.\n\nNot coming back.", "author": "Sharon C."}

The tempura was freshly fried, perfectly crispy on the outside and the veggies/shrimp/yams thoroughly cooked on the inside. The maki rolls and maguro sashimi were just okay.

We found this place in my bookmarks on Yelp and made our way here. As you walk in you can't help but notice the flying purple strips around the entrance of the door. Just a nice touch.\n\nAs you walk in there are a few paintings on the wall. Seating very prompt. There is a counter just as you turn left in entering. The tables are nicely laid on inside. You have a choice of sitting at a table or near the sushi bar. The first thing I noticed was all the fish being cooked and the aroma of spices. This is a familiar smell for those who eat a lot of sushi or go to a lot of sushi restaurants. \n\nThe waitresses here are very nice. They can answer all questions about the menu and the different types of sushi. I know my sushi pretty well but everyone once in awhile I see new sushi rolls on the menu. But, on this day I let the lady order the food. She likes sushi a lot and it was my TREAT so why not order what you want. She was pleased with that.\n\nI think we wound up getting 3 or 4 items from off of the menu. She was very excited to be here. I think she had heard about this place from one her co-workers. \n\nThe meal was exquisite. Just enough portions to fill both appetites. \n\nGreat time, great service, and even better meal.

I've been a fan for more than 20 years and Ebisu has consistently remained my favorite sushi restaurant. They have the freshest fish and very talented chefs.  The only downside is that parking is very tough in the neighborhood and that the wait times are usually 45 minutes to an hour. \n\nBe sure to check the board for the night's specials - they change nightly. Usually they have several different types of toro (fatty tuna and salmon belly) which is my absolute favorite. If you're an uni fan, be sure to get the live uni if they have it - it's very special and is much better than the regular (but still very good) uni. Other favorites include the XXX roll and the double hamachi roll. If you're lucky, you'll be able to sit at the bar and be served directly the the chef in front of you.", "author": "Allen T."}

If you have a great restaurant you can't just sit back and rely on a good reputation. You have to keep working for it, that is to say bring your A game to Friday night rush. Total fail. \n\nThe quality of fish, the quality of service and even the portions have suffered (the size of the cut has decreased significantly over the years). I think Ebisu fails to stand up to the test of time. I feel bad for not having put in a good review when I should have years if not even just 6 months ago. \n\nWhen I spoke to a manager about it she was receptive. Then she had a total fail as well. She told me that the server took my criticism personally and that every one makes mistakes. I never spoke to my server about the issues I was having, I spoke directly to the manager, whatever she said to the waitress I don't know but I never said a harsh word to her to make her cry. I feel like the manager was trying to make us both feel bad. \n\nWhen people regard your establishment as a place to come for a celebratory meal at a one of the most busy times you should live up to it. Never going back,  ever.\n\nNext fail, she offered us desert, I declined. She served it to us anyways. That really pissed me off, I can't eat ice cream and I already promised my daughter desert. So then my daughter had 2 desserts. \n\nOur server sucked horribly. The service was disjointed, some stuff just didn't even show up. The wrong thing showed up due to the fact that the server didn't understand what I ordered and then just decided to bring something else. The meal I ordered came out 15 minutes after my wife and kids entrees, then the appetizer I ordered arrived after that. \n\nThis experience totally ruined all the good memories I have of this place.

The 49er is a divine combination of flavors, and could have been improved by more content and less rice on the outside of the roll. \n\nXxx of the day was a bit too fishy-savory for me. Family affair was decent, not as noteworthy as the 49er. For the price I don't know if I'd come back. Maybe to try some new rolls and hopefully find one as memorable as the 49er.\n\nIf you have money to burn I definitely recommend Ebisu, if not you might consider digging up something that gives better bang for your buck.

I always thought Ebisu was pretty good but the long wait always make me not want to wait. \n\nTonight, I had the beef teriyaki ($25) and I also got some nigiri (maguro, sake toro, amaebi, & hotate). The sake toro, amaebi & the hotate was on the fresh fish specials & I thought they were much better than the maguro. So if you plan on ordering a la carte from the sushi bar, get whatever you would like, but do focus on getting the sushi from the fresh fish specials. The nigiri made me super full so I regretted ordering the beef teriyaki, but after taking a bite of the beef teriyaki, it was so good I was living. They do it differently than usual: serving it with veggies, yukon potatoes & the beef teriyaki in steak form. The beef & vegetables were so flavorful & cooked perfectly. I wasn't able to finish it but I did not regret getting it at all. \n\nWe arrived at the restaurant at around 7PM & had to wait for about 30-40 minutes. But as we were eating, I noticed it wasn't as crowded at around 7:30PM, however, we ate here on a Tuesday night, so I think the next time we come to eat here earlier in the week, we will come at around that time.", "author": "Victoria H."}

My son and I stepped in about 20 minutes prior to closing so they were in a rush to get us in and out of there.  They have a great selection of rolls and prices are reasonable.  Since I'm with child, I stayed away from raw fish and ordered cooked sushi rolls. I ordered a salmon teriyaki bento box for my son.  \n\nThe rolls are well made and service is fast and efficient.

The place was very busy considering it was a late Wednesday night but I was dining alone so I was seated at the bar right away. The employees were all very friendly including the sushi chef.\n\nI ordered the sashimi omakase and the sabagari maki roll. The sashimi omakase is more like a slightly fancier sashimi combo. It had around 25 slices of fish and was served beautifully. However the actual selection, quality, and creativity wasn't all the impressive. If you aren't looking for more less-commonly found types of fish and you want bang for your buck, this is a good deal. But personally I was hoping for an omakase that would feature their daily selection or a dish that would showcase the chef's creativity and unfortunately this wasn't it. Still for under $30 it's a pretty good deal. The quality isn't great but at about $1 a slice, you get what you pay for. The selection included seared albacore, saba, butterfish, yellowtail, salmon, ikura, etc. I'd suggest getting this platter to share. I was happy to see the sabagari maki roll on the menu. It's a great combo more places should have. I found the rice a bit mushy and the roll wasn't well formed but it was cheap and I still enjoyed it. \n\nOverall, Ebisu is an ok sushi spot. There's better options in SF but if you're in the area it's not bad.", "author": "Vivian C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-01", "description": "7PM. Weekday evening. And what?! There's people waiting outside already?? Most of them were families with small children...but still!\n\nEbisu is VERY close to Golden Gate Park and positioned perfectly right outside the heart of Inner Sunset. Street parking is bountiful if you happen to have good timing. It opens \n\nYou have many different types of \"sushi people.\" There are the \"SAKE SAKE SAKE people,\" then your \"white-folk-NO RAW PLEASE-people,\" the \"I LOVE sushi...but what they really mean is bento boxes people,\" and well...my sister and I are the \"sushi to us means specialty sushi rolls.\" Being from the South Bay, we've had our fair share of yucky sushi spots to delicious melt-in-your-mouth-raw-fish-heaven centers...so we hoped that Ebisu would be the latter. There are two other sushi spots literally right next door and across the street from Ebisu, so we figured that this place was the best because they were the only spot with people sitting around outside.\n\nEbisu is a small spot...and I'm talking about SMALL even for SF standards. They have two restrooms in the back, but the tight spacing makes you want to hold your pee until you get home. The poor servers have to constantly walk in one single-file-line to deliver the sushi plates to the back kitchen and to the customers' tables! It's pretty much a tight-spaced disaster waiting to happen. BUT the intimate ambiance is consequently increased tenfold and the vibes would be described as Asian-modern with a hint of sleek and a dash of zen. The cute old lady who we thought owned this spot is easy to see on any dining occasion. And the servers are a diverse bunch from Caucasian (shoutout to our chill server!) to Cantonese.\n\nAs an outsider and not an inhabitant of SF, I did not think the prices were too high at all! In fact the $9.50 crunch roll and $13 #29 roll were pretty average and almost considered \"cheap\" as compared to some other SoBay spots for sushi. I wouldn't say this was the \"best sushi\" I've ever had, but the presentation and pricing at Ebisu gets applause from this Yelper. Food-wise though, the rolls weren't sticking together as much as I'd like and the floor plan is a bit narrow for a completely well-rounded experience. They also have sake and beer!!

The kobe beef skewer was juicy and tender, although I haven't actually had legitimate Kobe beef in Japan to make a valid comparison Pricing is on par with other sushi places and the quality of fish was quite fresh, surprisingly. The albacore, salmon, and surf clams were my favorite, and there is enough sashimi pieces to share between two people.\n\nPleasant service coupled with an ambiance that is reminiscent of good times in Japan.

We ordered different nigiris (salmon, scallop, sweet shrimp, halibut), and they were the freshest most tender melt-in-your-mouth pieces of nigiri we have ever tried. The sushi rice was warm, and vinegary. I would HIGHLY recommend the Romeo & Juliet roll because the scallop was so sweet and the salmon + avocado complimented the whole roll. The rainbow roll was also delicious. Omakase was amazing and featured different kinds of fresh fish that all melted in your mouth. The three chefs out of the four were very experienced (one looked young like an apprentice), and they were all friendly.

Just like any Japanese restaurant, they warmly greeted us. We were promptly seated when we arrived at 12:30pm. \n\nFirstly, we ordered tea for drinks and it was mediocre green tea. They have decently priced bento boxes for lunch only, and we decided to get the beef teriyaki and salmon bento combination box (Combo 3 and 4) for $16 each. \n\nMiso soup came first, in a very cute bowl and matching lid. The miso soup here didn't taste like sodium galore, and it was salted to perfection, salty enough but not like you're drinking the ocean like other places. \n\nThe whole bento box took around 15 minutes to get to our table. We were both in awe of all the food that was included in this lunch special. My bento box came with 5 raw bite sized pieces of lean tuna, seaweed salad, house salad, grilled salmon , yuka potatoes, carrots, and tempura with a variety of veggies. The lean pieces of tuna was fresh, but not the best piece of tuna I've ever had. Seaweed salad tasted the same everywhere. House salad was fresh and light. I don't prefer vinaigrette dressings, so I didn't enjoy it as much. Salmon was just okay; the first piece was perfectly cooked, as it was moist and squishy. However, the second piece was overcooked, as it was very dry. My favorite part of the bento box was surprisingly the yuka potatoes that was mixed with the salmon. It had a smokey toasted flavor like house potatoes, but it was also sweet with the teriyaki sauce that came with the salmon. Tempura was also really good, as it was light and not overbearing with the grease. \n\nLunch was overall a good experience, but it wasn't life changing.", "author": "Harmony C."}

I've passed by Ebisu several times while visiting family, but never had a chance to dine here until a recent visit to Golden Gate Park.  Given the notorious wait and the small size of the restaurant, I was lucky to be seated almost immediately at 12:30PM on a Sunday and was mostly satisfied with my visit.\n\nEbisu has an extensive menu featuring almost everything you could possibly want from a Japanese restaurant, like sushi and sashimi as well as tempura and sukiyaki.  Since the restaurant is named after the Japanese of fishermen and most reviews highlighted the fish, I ordered the assorted sashimi ($22).  Although I wasn't able to fully identify the pieces of fish that came with the assorted sashimi, I did count at least 18 separate pieces of fish / seafood, but some pieces were admittedly smaller or chunkier than others.  Generally, the fish tasted fresh and had nice texture, but didn't have the elusive melt-in-your-mouth quality that typically defines really great sashimi.  As such, I didn't think this was the best sashimi ever in spite of the overall quality of the fish, and I thought that the price was a little higher than what I would have otherwise paid for sashimi at comparable establishments in LA.  And, disappointingly, the assorted sashimi did not include salmon - my favorite fish!  I also sampled the beef teriyaki don ($12) and thought that it had a nice sauce that was both savory and sweet.  But, I would caution those who don't like having their rice drenched in sauce against ordering donburi, as none of the rice remained untouched.\n\nService was generally good in spite of the busyness of the restaurant.  (Since most of the restaurant has smaller, two-person tables, you'll probably end up waiting for a bit if you have a large party.)  Staff always made sure that our water glasses were full and used plates were removed.  And, even though we had clearly finished eating, the restaurant didn't give us our bill until we had asked for it, ensuring that we could enjoy our post-meal conversation without being rushed.  \n\nAs with most restaurants in San Francisco, parking is street only.  You're probably better off walking or taking public transit if you're not interested in circling the cramped blocks for a space.\n\nI would definitely recommend checking out Ebisu if you're looking for a decent sushi after spending the day in Golden Gate Park, but probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back unless I desperately wanted sushi in the area given the higher than average prices and the number of comparable restaurants located elsewhere.", "author": "Greg T."}

For the insane prices - 2 pieces of scallop nigiri for $15 - you would expect at least polite, responsible service. And more likely fine dining service.  But no, even a small table of three couldn't get their food to arrive at the same time. The differential between the dishes arriving was about 10 minutes. So all told, a 20 minute delay between the first entree arriving and the last. What's more the last dish to arrive was wrong and they offered grudgingly to replace it but \"you'd have to wait.\" The server didn't know the specials on the board \"what is the xxx,\" \"I don't know...I'll go ask.\" You'd think by 7pm the server's already done this at least twice.  \n\nIt was unbelievably bad service, as if we were in a cafeteria, not a fine dining restaurant. The food was extremely pricey, and just okay sushi, though beautifully made. \n\nAnd then, something I ate there had me vomiting just a few hours later. I have no signs of having caught a virus, this is straight up something I ate was not good and my body rejected it. \n\nThere are so many sushi places now, Ebisu's not kept it's game up.

However, this can be standard with tempura. \n\nOur first roll was great. It was a lobster special roll. \n\nOur second roll...oh boy. I noticed by the 3rd piece the ratio of fish to rice was almost 90% rice. There was almost no fish inside the roll. By the time we got to the middle of the roll we were literally eating rolled rice with salmon on top. I never send things back, but I had to. They made a new one for us, but the problem persisted! WAY too much rice. I eat sushi all the time and I have been to so many, less hyped sushi restaurants that have better rolls than this. We were pretty blown away that the second time around there was still hardly ANY fish inside the roll. \n\nBut, the straw that broke the camels back, there was a BONE in our sushi.

Plus the $50 plate allows you to try all sorts of fish, and I've never had fish this fresh before.

Surprisingly, or maybe not surprisingly, Ebisu caters to a non-Japanese crowd. Unless you're into frilly sushi bars that make americanized rolls and fancy fusion-y appetizers, I suggest that you don't go to Ebisu.\n\nFirst, the prices do not justify the quality of food they're serving. Although they get fresh fish like aji and kanpachi that $10 sushi bars don't get, it's a shame what they do to the fish. \n\nAnd I don't think it's excusable to get fish mixed up. Case in point: we ordered hamachi belly twice, separately. First time it came looking light pink, and the second time, more white and fatty. Any idiot can tell that they are not the same cut. Not really a mistake any sushi bar should be making.\n\nMoreover, their \"bluefin\" tuna was obviously frozen and defrosted, god knows how many times, or more likely the case, it wasn't bluefin at all.\n\nFor the kind of money Ebisu is charging, I'd rather go to Kazu Sushi and have a more authentic and intimate experience.", "author": "Sherry L."}

I'd say it's somewhere closer to 4.5, but I'm rounding up.\n\nI came here tonight (a Friday night) with a classmate close to 8:45pm. There was a ridiculous \"line\". By line, I mean you add your name to a list of names on a piece of paper. At first, I was a bit discouraged by the 10 small parties above our name, but it moved quite quickly. The wait really wasn't that long. While we waited, we looked at the menu and decided what to get. \n\nTo be honest, I've been to Kiki, Hotei, Kazu, and Izakaya Sozai and have not been impressed at all with any of the foods. Mediocre at best. Thus, I was pretty skeptical about Ebisu. However, all my presumptions have been destroyed.\n\nHere's what we got:\n++Sake Steamed Clams - Dashi sake butter broth - $9\nThis dish was probably the favourite of the night. The broth was delicious. If you've had belgian mussels, this is the japanese equivalent. Very delicious, and there were a handful of clams.\n\n++Live Scallops with fried something on the side - around $18ish\nThese scallops were like butter and melted in your mouth. It was really good. I wasn't quite sure what the fried stuff was. I asked but didn't hear, and didn't ask for further clarification. Scallops that melt in your mouth though, omg. Use the lemon.\n\n++Oyster Dynamite - Oysters and sea urchin baked in house dynamite sauce - $11\nThis dish was okay. It didn't stand out as anything special. It came with 4 pieces and were mounted on a mound of salt. It looks like mashed daikon, but don't be fooled.\n\n++Bincho Tataki - Seared albacore w/ onions, tobiko & ponzu - Small $16\nVery flavourful. A little bit too salty for my tastes, but all the other flavours meshed really well. This was a very good dish though. It was nicely seared on the outside, and very tender on the inside. Again, the inside was fresh enough to melt in your mouth.\n\n++Double Hamachi - Yellowtail, Scallion and Tobiko - $14.50\nI like hamachi. Lots of hamachi. This sushi was a standard size, with very fresh hamachi. For just the size, 14.50 isn't quite worth it, but you're also paying for the quality of the fish I guess. It was worth getting for sure, but I'll try a different roll next time!\n\nService was very good. Our table was too small for the amount of food we ordered. We tried to finish some dishes to be cleared away. Water was promptly refilled, tea was refilled, and we were checked on a few times to make sure everything was good. Towards the end, we were checked on quite often. I can appreciate the attentiveness.\n\nOverall:\n+Good service\n+Fresh fish\n+Delicious dishes\n-Long wait\n\nI am for sure coming back and I highly recommend this place. It's a bit on the pricer side, but it's worth it. I'm currently contemplating getting the $100 gift card for $85.", "author": "Kaje Y."}

I also love sushi (American and traditional Japanese), so I was excited to try this place out considering the reviews.\n\nThe ambience was nice, and the service very good (although a bit slow, but it gave us more time to talk). \n\nHe ordered the teriyaki chicken plate as a backup, and we ordered two rolls (49er and Spider) that looked appealing to him. I also ordered inari because I absolutely love it and most American sushi restaurants don't have it.\n\nThe teriyaki chicken plate is a very large portion of food as it comes with a nice serving of chicken, a yummy salad, steamed veggies (also very yummy, nicely seasoned and not mushy), and pan-fried potato wedges. Comes with miso soup. Easily enough to feed two people who are hungry but not ravenous. We should have only ordered one roll in hindsight, but we didn't realize the chicken plate would be so big. \n\nI was pleased that he loved both rolls. The 49er roll was very good and a unique combination because of the lemon and shiso leaf (they have another version of this with added shrimp on the menu as well), I wish the salmon had been fresher but for American fish standards it was good I guess. I did not like the spider roll, the crab meat might have been fake and was not seasoned well... overall, not a very tasty roll in my opinion. Inari was good enough, the agedashi tofu pouch was a bit too salty but I can't complain too much because I was just so happy to have some.

There's bar seating as well, where you get to order directly from the sushi chef instead of a waiter/waitress.\n\nIf you like variety in a meal, I recommend the lunch or dinner combo bento boxes, at $15 or $20, respectively. They're excellent deals and contain enough food for up to two people! The meal includes miso soup, rice, green salad, seaweed salad, cooked spinach salad, and three entrees. The entree options include shrimp and vegetable tempura, teriyaki salmon, chicken, or beef, fried oyster, sashimi, or maki sushi. There's quite a selection here.\n\nI've tried the Omakase dinner set, which is the chef's selection of sashimi. It's priced at $25 (serves one to two people) or at $50 (serves three or four people). In reality, if you love sashimi, get the $25 set all for yourself because it's enough for one person. The sashimi selection varies, but most of the time, maguro and sake are included.\n\nI haven't been very pleased with some of the specialty sushi options here. I tried the Boston Roll (salmon, cucumber, avocado, crab and tobiko) and the 49er Roll (salmon, avocado, tobiko, shiso, and lemon). The Boston Roll had imitation crab, which was a huge disappointment. And the 49er roll had too much rice so that the fish to rice ratio was off.\n\nEbisu offers expensive, but still considered affordable, sushi. Quality is fresh. Service friendly. Restaurant is a bit small and there can be some wait time during busy hours. Nevertheless, Ebisu is my go-to Japanese restaurant in the Inner Sunset!", "author": "Priscilla W."}

With all the positive reviews here and the 15-45 minute wait time (especially on Fri/Sat), I don't think I'm alone in this opinion. Probably best to get there early/when they open, or the later seating periods.\n\nMost important for a sushi joint, the fish is always fresh and of high quality, and the rice done perfectly. They also have quite a selection of fairly unique rolls. For the most interesting experience, I recommend sitting at the sushi bar, and (if you're open to trialing food you normally wouldn't order on your own and aren't strictly budgeting) go omakase and let the chef guide your experience. All the chefs are skilled and personable.\n\nIf you choose to forego sushi or focus on cooked foods, everything is seasoned and cooked well, and the portions are very generous for the quality. My personal favorites are the hamachi kama appetizer and kurobuta pork special (though they may not be offering that at this time). Even the beef teriyaki is above par; it's practically a steak with teriyaki seasoning. \n\nThe atmosphere's pretty casual, it's definitely close quarters and high volume. I still recommend for a casual date night, family dinner, hangout with friends, or just if you're in the mood for sushi. Groups of 6 or less are probably best, though I recall seeing a group of 10-12 every once in a while.", "author": "Mack W."}

Tried this place one night after seeing it on my Instagram feed and decided to just go for it. \n\nMy friend and I ordered three rolls:\n\n- 49ers roll: Love this. It was refreshing, the lemon was cut at just the right thickness (or thinness) and the salmon was fresh. \n\n- Family Affair: This was my favorite roll of the night! I was skeptical to try this at first, given that it comes with onions and I'm not a very big fan of onions, but it was delicious. There's just something about it that had me hungry for more after we devoured the roll. \n\n- Romeo & Juliet: not my cup of tea, to be honest. It was just not as tasty as I had hoped for it to be after reading Yelp reviews and asking our waiter about it when he recommended it to us. \n\nBut, aside from the last roll, the fish on the rolls we ordered tasted fresh - not super fishy like it had just come out of the ocean, but it was really good, cut right, and it seemed like it had the right proportion of fish, rice, and other ingredients that came with the rolls. \n\nWhat's different about these Ebisu rolls is that they don't use seaweed! Or at least in the rolls that we ordered, but it tasted great. We didn't notice that there wasn't seaweed until we were halfway finished eating. \n\nWe also ordered the Ebisu udon... Don't get it. Save yourself the money. \n\nWe left the restaurant craving for it the next day. But, you know, we had to stop ourselves.

The 3 orders of hamachi toro @$9.50 was the most disappointing.   I even asked the chef if he gave me regular hamachi instead of toro.   None of the other nigiri we ordered impressed me either.   Ebisu will no longer be a restaurant that I crave to go back to", "author": "Renee Y."}

I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and family.  \n\nSince I like this place so much, i already know what I would like to order next time.

I also ordered a few rolls, but I think that a sushi restaurant is only as good as how well they prepare their nigiri (and saba is my favorite). The saba was very fresh and tasty. The rice did not fall apart and was well seasoned with white vinegar. My only complaint is that the actual piece of fish felt a little tough (as if it was in the fridge and did not thaw long enough).\n\nThe rolls I ordered were the Swamp Roll and the Double Hamachi roll. The rolls were well made and did not fall apart. The rolls were tasty.

The waitresses were very kind and patient, but were visibly trying to clean up as many of the other tables as possible. Hence, they were a bit more forgetful and inattentive. I did really enjoy the interior decorations and the intimate setting. It's perfect for small groups of 4-5. \n\nWe tried the Dragon Roll and it was decadent. I'm definitely not a foodie, but enjoyed the balance of flavors. However, the price is definitely high for the size. \n\nI also got to try the beef sukiyaki, which the waitress recommended. Sukiyaki is essentially clear noodles in savory broth, with veggies (napa cabbage,  tofu, carrots) & meat (choice of chicken or beef with some fishcake) served in an iron pot. The dish is more on the sweet side and comes with rice and miso soup. I expected there to be more noodles, but there was only a pinch of it. I've never had sukiyaki before and did not have anything to compare it to. Anyways, the bowl is consider large for one person so share if you can and order something on the side. I liked how the beef were thinly sliced and the portion of it was generous. However, I didn't like how the pot was essentially boosted up by the insane amount of napa cabbage under it. For the value, I'd take down a star. \n\nI think I would return to try more of their sushi rolls.", "author": "Priscilla C."}

That's almost criminal in some states...  \n\nToro seemed fresh, dragon roll was well received but the quality and taste of the rolls left much to be desired...

But definitely not a turn off. It made it very comfortable. The decor is very simple and homey with high celings and minimal art on the walls. It was very cute:)\n\nTo start off, we got the oysters on the shell. The balance of tobiko and ponzu sauce was perfect! Then we ordered the live sea urchin because we noticed it at the bar and it was the best uni I had ever had in my LIFE. It was so fresh and it came on a bed of ice and it was just lovely. We ordered three rolls to finish off our meals. The first roll was the XXX roll. It was a salmon roll, topped off with more salmon, avocado, mango slices, tobiko and GOLD. Like, edible gold glitter. It was a delicious roll but the presentation really won me over with the glitter! The next roll we had was the Family Affair.I was a bit iffy about the Maui onions but it paired nicely with the spicy aioli! The last roll we had was the Romeo and Juliet(his pick. cute, right?). This roll had scallop AND salmon on it, which made it a winner in my eyes.\n\nWe ended the meal with a couple of sake bombs and we were good to go!

Prior to getting a table I took a look at their specials board and they have $1 draft beers from 5-6pm for happy hour! WHAT?! THIS IS GREAT.\n\nSo we ordered two $1 Kirin drafts (can you see how proud I am for ordering such cheap drinks?), QP roll, xxx roll, dragon roll, dexter carter roll and the boston roll.\n\nQP roll - you can order it with a level of spiciness, I don't recommend it, since it takes away from the taste of the roll.

I could hardly taste the fruit tho.\n\nDragon roll - just a typical dragon roll\n\nDexter carter roll - basically my beloved 49er roll with avocado\n\nBoston roll - possibly my favorite out of all rolls that night\n\nServers are pretty nice and friendly.

Stay for the Matcha Creme Brulee, leave because there are a ton of people clamoring to get in.\n\nEither get here early, or plan on getting here closer to closing. This wasn't my first rodeo at Ebisu. I first stumbled upon Ebisu a few years ago. My roommate at the time was trying to take me to a different spot, but the line was way too long. Approaching closing time for most locations around the area, we jumped on Yelp. 4.5 stars, 400 reviews? Not bad, let's try this place.\n\nAlmost 1000 reviews and several visits later, Ebisu still takes the top spot on my list of favorite Sushi joints. \n\nThe restaurant itself is small, but they do make solid use of the available space.If you come during prime dinner rush hour, be prepared to wait. Ebsiu has always been very popular, but appears to have boomed over the last few years. Depending on your group size, you can wait anywhere from 15mins-1 hour. Trust me when I say it's well worth the wait.\n\nEbsiu's fish is always fresh. Their speciality rolls aren't drenched in various sauces and are very creative (Hot Link roll for example. Prices, in my opinion, are fair given the quality and portions given. There is a rotating door of appetizer offerings (Kobe Beef Sashimi, Calamari Tempura, Lobster Dynamite) and a \"Chef's Choice\" selection of speciality rolls aptly named \"XXX\". \n\nHere's what we ordered last night:\n\n- Miso Soup (not overly salty like most places)\n- Spicy Tuna Hand Rolls (Probably THE best spicy tuna I've ever had.)\n- Uni nigiri (They have fresh UNI that still comes in a shell, but don't know how to order that)\n- Salmon nigiri\n- 49er Roll (Salmon over avocado with a thin slice of lemon on top.)\n- XXX Roll - Yesterday, it was a salmon mango avocado wrapped over their spicy tuna. \n- Matcha Creme Brulee\n\nEverything was delicious and incredibly fresh. The Matcha Creme Brulee is the perfect way to cap off a great meal. It isn't too sweet and and unlike most other matcha flavored sweets, you can actually taste the green tea. \n\nService is excellent. The servers aren't there to make friends (that's what the Sushi Chefs are there for!), but they'll seldom forget any request or item that you've ordered. The food comes out quick.\n\nAmbiance - My gf and I used to come here if we wanted a quasi romantic setting. That no longer seems to be case. While the place is nicely decorated with a modern feel, the surge of tourist traffic takes away from that just a bit.\n\nGo ahead and make your normal sushi selection, but be sure to save room for the Creme Brulee!", "author": "Chris Q."}

Once seated, service was very fast and friendly.  Seems more fun to sit at the sushi bar, as the chefs are very sociable and do fun tricks with the food.  It also appeared that those sitting at the bar had extra perks like sliced oranges with their meal.  Table service was just fine though.  And kudos on the free refills on the diet coke and tea!  We had the beef sukiyaki which came with miso soup and a bowl of rice.  We also had a roll topped with wakame that the menu did not specify was spicy (so I had to eat less of that one).  If you are sensitive to spice, it might be worthwhile to confirm that nothing you ordered is spicy.  Overall, I would come back in a heartbeat.  Such a warm experience and delicious food!!", "author": "Christina G."}

Since it was still early for dinner, we tried our luck here; we were able to be seated right aways...at the last 2 seats in the restaurant.\n\nSince we were sitting at the sushi bar, we ordered a bunch of different sushi role & nigiris. The California roll was decent & didn't use the kind of imitation crab that's mixed with mayo. The Salmon toro was good but it was not really all that fatty. The Kampachi was sweet but not the best that I've had in the Sunset. The Crunchy roll was interesting. I couldn't really taste the poke & I wish it was wrapped in nori instead because it could've use a little extra crunchiness.\n\nIN addition to the sushi & nigiri, we also got the $25 Omakase sashimi plat. We got 8-9 types of fish with at least 3 pieces each. The quality was not the greatest & the slices were on the small side; but it was definitely a good deal for the price.\n\nThe highlight of the meal for me was the Chawanmushi. I love this steamed egg dish but haven't had it since moving to the US 15 years ago. The whole thing was not too salty & the egg was silky smooth. The only negative is the overcooked shrimp in the middle...but that's the way it is. It does take about 15 minutes to cook so order early.\n\nEven though we got here slightly before 5:30, the restaurant was already super packed. And if you arrive after 5:30, expect a crowd or even a line out the door. There are 4 chefs working behind the sushi bar so serve is usually pretty quick. The sushi bar is a bit cramped so get ready to get to know your neighbors.", "author": "Karen S."}

The lobster tempura was okay, it's like any other type of tempura..just lobster. The Kobe beef sashimi was interesting and yummy. I've never had beef like this before. They give 3 different types of sauces to eat it with (green sauce - spiciest, red/orange sauce - medium spicy, and white - not spicy). Definitely recommend this dish!

As it came out, the fish varieties weren't too special, there was uni and it tasted sweet, but not really like a lot of uni.  \n\nWe also ordered oyster on the shell, ok to below average, I'd rather prefer the fat ones fresh from oyster farms; lobster dynamite, which was really yummy with the sauce though slightly spicy.

It had a neat modern feel to it and was different than other sushi restaurants I've been to. \n\nThe sushi was good, but it wasn't anything spectacular. The most disappointing of my evening, however, was the fact that they completely rushed us out. To their defense, my friend and I did come on the later side (around 9 or 9:15), but they were supposed to close at 11pm. We ordered some appetizers and rolls and sashimi to share, and they brought all of it out at the same time, even though our table was already too crowded. They then told us they decided to close early. They began stacking chairs on tables around us while we were still eating, and I even had to stop them twice to stop taking things off our table because we hadn't finished them.

Sushi and rolls are the way to go. Their second restaurant across the street has more cooked food options. Definitely open up your wallet for the good stuff; live scallop, live shrimp (with fried shrimp head included) and tuna belly. There is always a wait to get in.

But, the thing is I absolutely hate their salad, so I would always ask the lady to replace the salad with an additional miso soup or additional broccolini instead. However, according to the waitress and her boss, I have to pay extra if I ever want to replace the miso soup. Ok, so normally I would have no problem with paying a little extra but the fact that I have to pay an additional 2.00 just to add a little more broccolini (when I am already giving up the salad) is just plain ridiculous. The bento box is already 20 dollars and the portion size is small when compared to its atrociously high cost...\n\nTo conclude, though the food is decent. the food is definitely NOT WORTH THE PRICE especially when it comes with such POOR SERVICE. You will probably be better off dining at Kiki the Japanese Restaurant next door, as the price is pretty much half that of Ebisu.\n\nHowever, I would like to note that the younger caucasian lady and the younger japanese man whom work there as well provide much better service so if you ever decide to go here order from them NOT the older japanese lady.", "author": "Don C."}

The latter is a melt in your mouth explosion of delicate flavor that might require a cigarette after you complete the experience (figuratively speaking of course). And the selection of toro including bluefin is just incredible - and you can taste the freshness and quality\n\nPut it his way - my dad lives in southern CA and has literally flown up for dinner at ebisu and flown back the same night!?!\n\nThat's all need be said!?!", "author": "Robert R."}

Most places close at 9:30 so we were looking online to see which places were opened late and we came across Ebisu! \n\nWhen we got there the place was packed! We had to wait for 2 groups of two people before we would be called. We waited about 20 minutes until they called our party of 5. The atmosphere in there is really pleasant. When we sat down, they automatically gave us tea, handed us menus, and asked if we wanted water. \n\nThe waiter suggested their specials which were on the whiteboard, however, we didn't exactly understand what he was saying.We got the Sukiyaki, two dinner plates (one chicken teriyaki and the other with salmon), and also a bowl of udon noodles that came with tempura. The rice plates and the sukiyaki came with a bowl of rice and miso soup. The miso soup tasted pretty good, normally its tasteless at other places. The waiters and waitresses constantly came by to see if we needed any refills with tea or water. And when we needed something, they were always there. The food was a little bit more pricey but you can't expect  for it to be cheap when you go to a sushi place.\n\nOverall, this place has GOOD FOOD and GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!", "author": "Jeanette Q."}

Special thanks to my fellow yelpers for leading me to try a local spot I never even noticed.\n\nI went here with a friend to celebrate a birthday. After reading about the horrendous wait we made an effort to get there shortly after they opened for dinner. I run on Xicano time so that was like 6:30ish (they open at 5). \n\nWe walked in and were asked for our party size by a sweet older woman, who I later learned is the owner. I love sitting at the bar and it was still available. Score. We were seated immediately. Our sushi chef was Julio, he was amaze. After learning we were celebrating a birthday he def set the tone and made the experience. Oyster shots (Served with quail egg, tobiko, negi, daikon, ginger and ponzu)!!! One for each person on our end of the bar. The shots were good for the occasion but not likely something I would order regularly.\n\nRight off the bat we got a bottle of the Kamoizumi Daiginjo SAke which was a great pairing for our meal. It quickly came to the bar along with two individual edamames. To start we ordered the Oysters Barnabi on the 1/2 shell with uni, ikura, uzura and ponzu. They were crazy good. Something about the texture was great. \n\nWe decided to do omakase and added toro and had the chef serve up whatever else he saw fit. Our first plate was Sashimi and it was super fresh and beautifully cut. Then followed the Toro which was the show stealer. \n\nWe then had two cute baskets of ceviche. I was not a fan. The fish was great but I'm Mexican so ceviche just means something completely different to me. A fabulous nigiri plate followed that included some amazing Escolar. Def a must! After that we were served a special roll with spicy tuna which was amazing. \n\nThe dessert was meh! Just ice cream and fruit. Julio was great but the servers seemed a little off. We didn't have a consistent person refilling water or checking on us. Also, minus 1 star= They don't let the chefs drink with us. What? I know crummy right!\n\nAll of that food plus tax and tip came out to about $340. Overall, I loved the decor, the fresh sushi, and Julio the sushi chef. But for that price point the wait staff and overall vibe were not up to par. I did however notice that this is a very regulars oriented place so maybe the treatment was because we were first timers.

We waited for about 30 minutes on a Sunday night (labor day weekend), which I can say isn't too had a wait and it was worth the wait. We ordered several dishes, but the one that really caught our attention was the oo toro -- which was the super fatty part of the blue fin-- and the Kobe sashimi. Hands down, those were the highlights of the place. The oo toro and the regular blue fin toro literally melts in your mouth within even chewing! It was so good! As for the Kobe sashimi, I've never had such a wonderful dish. The cuts were perfect and the taste of the sauce was on point. When you add in a bit of garlic and Chile paste, it was perfect!

For $20, it seems like a reasonable deal, but am not sure about quality.\n- Gyoza (2 orders): It's pretty hard to mess these up, and I will say that this was great to share with a group of hungry adults. 2 orders was probably aggressive.\n- Family Affair Roll: This was not good at all. The spicy aioli was WAY too much. I would definitely advise against getting this if you're not a big mayo fan.\n- Sukiyaki: Also very meh. I wouldn't advise getting this either. It's definitely a lot of food, but don't be deceived: most of it is vegetables.  The amount of beef was minimal and tastes nothing like traditional sukiyaki.\n- Chicken Katsu: The parts that I had was OK, but as expected, a lot of the chicken was very dry.  Probably the \"safest\" dinner entree you could order, but nothing I'd write home about. Lots of food though.\n- Green Tea Creme Brulee: Interesting concept, very green tea-y, but I actually really enjoyed this.\n\nOverall, I don't know why people wait for hours to eat here.

We love sitting at the sushi bar and interact with the chefs to get their recommendations and have to admit Ebisu is already on our top 3 sushi spots in SF. The staff was outstanding: fast, sweet and their recomm. were spot on. We really liked the Omakase for the high quality of the fish and because the pieces were coming at a perfect pace. Special shot out the Eel and Umi Nigiri, both ridiculously tasty.", "author": "Aleix V."}

Last night I decided to order take out and much to my surprise there was a $3 charge just to get take out. They call it their \"box fee\". I'm pretty unhappy that such a thing exists because I've gotten take out at a lot of high end places in SF and not once did I ever encounter this. Like dude I'm not even dining there it's a take out order. Sigh. Also, when I got home a couple of the rolls were falling apart every time I'd use my chopsticks to pick up the pieces. The sushi still tastes good but just a suggestion I hope one day they remove the box fee. Like do you need me to bring my own box or container for you guys? You already make a lot of $ here. You have to understand from a customers perspective it doesn't really make sense especially if they're just going to pick up their order and take it home. Imagine if u were to go grocery shopping and every bag was $3......would be shocking huh? Just saying.", "author": "Diane L."}

Before we came, we called and tried to get an idea how long the wait was for two people. The lady over the phone said 'it's not too bad', so we rushed over there and only saw the line was almost out of the door.  But I was determined to try this place, so we waited for our table.  Luckily, we got to sit at the bar after 30 minutes or so.  It was a very busy evening, but I like to take my time and enjoy my sushi at the bar (especially if we are paying a lot for this meal!)  \nWe saw some special on the menu and asked the chef about it. Instead of explaining to us exactly what they had, he just said he will order for us. So we trusted him... but I wish we didn't...    The kobe beef sashimi ($15) was too much for us (12 pieces) since i wanted to try other fish.  So i was not too happy about that.  \n\nWe also tried some nigiri:\n\n1. hamachi toro: pretty good ($8.5)\n\n2. salmon toro: also good ($7.5)\n\n3. amaebi:  had better ones ($9.5).  And when i asked what options we had for the shrimp head, the chef said they would fry it. When i asked about cooking it in miso soup, he responded that they would do that too.. So when we requested for miso soup, he came back and told us that the kitchen already fried the head!  again, this should never happen at a Japanese restaurant! \n\n4. lobster tempura ($15):  never had lobster this way before. interesting, wish there were more sauces to make it more flavorful.\n\n5. ocean trout nigiri ($8): i've asked for it to be slightly torched.  not bad... but again, i wish the chef can recommend more and better choices. \n\n6. we ended up trying live scallop special at the end since there weren't any other fresh fish we were really interested in.  However the problem was it was an order of 8 pieces of scallop nigiri ($18). why would they do that again?  i just want to try one piece!!! but i was 'forced' to commit to eating four pieces if i wanted to try it..  and sadly enough, it was not the freshest or the best scallop i've had!  again, a bit disappointed!  \n\nafter all that, our bill was around $100.   Were they good sushi? not bad. I've had better and cheaper ones.  The sad part is although i was full, i didn't walk out satisfied.   Maybe I am just too spoiled by all the other really good Japanese restaurants I've been in LA and San Diego.  Come on, SF, show me some good sushi!!!  Or did I just expect too much??? maybe i should've just ordered some rolls and be happy with that.", "author": "Tiffany H."}

YES.\n\nI know there are many Japanese places that are great in SF, but I've yet to try them all. As of now, Ebisu is in my top 2. We ordered the oyster shooter as an appetizer, \"fish & chips\" which was an appetizer of the night or something, 49er roll, Double Hamachi, an order of sake & Romeo & Juliet. \n\nEverything was delicious and fresh, but my absolute favorite was the 49er roll. As I've mentioned before, it's a rule of thumb for me to try it if it's ever on the menu. Best 49er roll I've had in SF. \n\nAll in all, our bill came to about $100.

When we were finally seated our waitress seemed to have a staring problem along with a big attitude. After receiving our rolls, we asked for ginger and we did not receive the ginger for another 25 minutes. Our waitress did not ask how things were till way after (read a similar review about this on Yelp). Towards the end of our meal, the staff was rushing us (also a theme in other reviews). The waitress boxed our leftovers in front of us. It didn't seem necessary but she wouldn't let us take over.

It can be easy to miss as it has blue awning/curtains hanging over the door (a steeple in Japan). You enter and automatically are greeted by the serving staff and cooks with \"Irrashaimase!\" (another custom in Japanese culture; greeting the customer into their business). I felt like I was back in Japan.\n\nThere is both seating at tables and at the bar and it's pretty busy. But our waitress was very quick to give us menus. We decided on getting an order of tamago, unagi, and a special roll they call \"Family Affair\". Wow. This sushi was to die for good! It was so fresh and beautifully prepared. I love tamago, but you can generally tell when it's actually been prepared versus being pre made. This was definitely made right on the spot. And the unagi was warm and slipped right onto my tongue.

The fish is fresh, the service impeccable, and friendly and great selection of foods. \n\nMy personal favorites are the Romeo and Juliet, and Family Affair rolls; the Hawaiian poke, and the fresh salad. With some wine these dishes make for a memorable dinner.\n\nMy only quibble is the take-away orders seem to be smaller than the dinning in. So where a roll being consumed in the restaurant would be plenty of food, the take away order seems to leave me wanting more. However, the price is the same.  \n\nThis brings me to the reason I order take away - the long wait time for a table and inability to make a reservation. It's a small place and very popular. So, one can expect that  unless there for lunch, or for dinner at exactly 5pm or the weather is inclement, the wait may be upwards of an hour or more.\n\nThat's not to say it wouldn't be worth the wait, because I have waited an hour and despite being so ravenous I could eat my own hand by the time I got seated, I was glad I waited after the food arrived.", "author": "Shannon V."}

It came, it appeared very nice at first, but as I began to eat I noticed that the cuts of fish were done sloppily. The rough cuts were somewhat acceptable, because I wasn't expecting the finest sushi dining. But as I began to eat, I noticed several scales still on my fish. As I ate the fish, something seemed off. This was supposedly the fresh fish of the day, so I continued eating, paid, and went home.\n\nSince then (about a couple hours or so), I have been very sick with some kind of food poisoning.

When they first served it, it looked a little dry but then I opened it up and it was soooo moist! Couldn't have been cooked better. My dish also came with a really nice portion of salad which was super fresh and delicious. It was vibrant and had a light dressing which I really enjoyed. There were also little portions of other veggies on the side and came with a bowl of rice and miso soup (which was a little sweet strangely). I really enjoyed this dish because it's not very heavy, the portion was perfect, and it tasted great! I also tried a king crab & a salmon skin hand roll which were both delicious. The crab was nice and fresh. Super sweet with an avocado for a nice creamy texture. The salmon skin hand roll was nice, too. It was nice and crispy, but it was more of a textural experience. There were some, I believe, pickled veggies inside which was nicely dressed. Lastly, since it was Valentine's day, they had a special roll in honor and it was composed of spicy tuna on the inside, and avocado and tuna on the top. There was also \"gold flakes\" on top, but I'm 99% sure we just ate glitter hahahhaha. And I would have preferred the spicy tuna to be a little spicier since it was a very mellow. \n\nAll in all, I would come back to try more of their specialty rolls!

I was already running late to dinner and then it took me an additional 1 hour to find parking. It was so bad I had to pick up my date and he helped me look for parking around the area. The parking here that night was worse than trying to find parking on a sunny day at Dolores Park. What gives? So I was not off to a good start.\n\nLuckily we did have reservations to this place, but we still sat at the bar.  I wouldn't normally complain about eating at the bar, except on a first date, it doesn't allow both people to have a decent conversation since you're in that awkward position where you constantly have to turn to the side in order to talk.\n\nWe ordered a mixture of items including sashimi, nigiri, some rolls and some drinks. I thought the quality of the food was good, but not worth it for how ridiculous it was to find parking. The bill was quite expensive for two people, but the worst part of the night was that my date made me split the bill. Ouch. Needless to say, there wasn't a second date.

So the boyfriend and I meander over to this place, and he's got high hopes, and I'm hoping there will be yummy rolls for an uncultured fool like myself.\n\nThe reason this place gets a 5 is because they completely changed my mind about raw fish. We got the double hamachi. Usually, I'm hesitant. Raw fish reminds me of fishy gummi bears, and I just can't handle that. But the double hamachi was ridiculously amazing. It had yellowtail on top, hamachi in the center. After putting one in my mouth, I'm pretty sure I almost cried, because I can't believe I've been missing out on this. I've had hamachi before, but I can see why the boyfriend was always complaining about other sushi restaurants - this is the sort of quality he usually looks for, and I confess that I see the light.\n\nThe place itself is pretty tiny, but very well-decorated. The servers are super friendly, if not hurried - still, because the place is so small, you can see how busy it is, and even though it was busy, a server was never hard to come across. At one point I was staring off into space and a waitress came by asking if I was okay.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-24", "description": "I've been eating here fairly regularly for at least 10 years and have never had a bad meal or an unpleasant experience.  When I moved to SF, it was from the mid-west, where... sushi is *not so good.*  Always an experience that made me a bit apprehensive.  Ebisu was the first place I was taken in SF, the place that made me love sushi, crave it, eat it several times a week.\n\nThe wait staff is nice, friendly, and attentive in a polite way -- not hovering but there when you need them.  They pace meals well, bringing one or two orders at a time, clearing plates constantly through the meal, and checking back to make sure everything is OK frequently.  Someone is almost constantly coming through with water and tea refills as well.  There can be a long wait for a table during peak hours on weekends, but it's a very popular place, so that is to be expected.  I usually go in early or on week nights and rarely have a wait.\n\nThe restaurant was remodeled a couple of years ago, and I like it a lot better now.  It looks cleaner and more modern.  That said, I miss the tatami room in the back, which was great for larger parties. It is a bit difficult to bring a group to Ebisu now.  I find it is best suited for parties of 4 or smaller, and the dining configuration is even more cramped now that they've eliminated some of the seating space in the remodel.\n\nOn to the most important matter:  the food.  I'm easily put off by \"fishy\" smells or tastes.  I've never found that to be a concern here.  Fish is always very fresh, cuts are good.  They have a wide selection of both more conventional dishes and Westernized specialty rolls.  Some of the rolls are unique to Ebisu and quite inventive compared to other sushi places in this city.  It is true that they have scaled down the menu after the remodel, but there are still enough choices to keep anyone happy.  My \"must order\" list always seems to grow, far beyond what I can actually eat in one sitting. :)\n\nMy standard order (why, yes, I'm a glutton):\n\n1) 49ER ROLL - This is a must order.  Ebisu has ruined me. Theirs is the best; if it's on the menu at any other sushi restaurant, I order it, and then am disappointed when it's not as good as Ebisu's.  If it's not on the menu elsewhere, I'm crestfallen.  It is now impossible to be satisfied with a sushi meal if there is no 49'er roll.  Last weekend, one of my friends had to endure my attempt to peel slivers of lemon to put on my non-49er-roll at another establishment.  The combination is really *that* good.\n\n2) Sashimi - usually sake or hirame in my case, but I've yet to hear of anything that's not good.\n\n3) Kobe beef sashimi or nigiri, whatever is on the day's special\n\n4) UMESHISO maki roll - I feel as strongly about this as I do the 49er roll; not coincidentally, this is also one of the standards by which I judge sushi places.  A bit unfair, unbalanced, and strange, I know, but hey, I am all of those things!\n\n5) Ebisu Maki - I'd thought they'd dropped this from the menu, but it's just been relocated under the non-specialty roll section.  It's a maki roll with salmon and a bunch of vegetables (like sprouts, cucumber, some root veggies, can't recall exactly).\n\n6) The a la carte skewers I've tried have been quite good and I usually order one or more after failing to convince myself that I've ordered quite enough already.\n\n\nThere are a lot of other wonderful things that I don't order, because I am allergic to them, and consequently, my life is very sad.  But my friends order them, rave over them, and I drool and wish I could eat them.  For example:\n- Potato Bug\n- Dragon Roll\n- Caterpillar\n- Hamachi Sashimi, in particular, I've heard is very good\n\n\nThe portions for most items are pretty generous.  Obviously sashimi and nigiri orders are not very large, but the specialty rolls are enormous.   If I am being reasonable about the amount of food that is strictly necessary, I would be content with one specialty roll, one piece of sashimi and maybe a small maki roll (like umeshiso or avocado).  I am not very reasonable though....\n\nThe only negative experience at Ebisu, is when the check comes, and I do a double take before remembering how much I ordered.\n\nI have tried just ordering take-out to avoid this problem but it doesn't really work since as soon as I look at the menu, I find myself rattling off half a dozen items.", "author": "Heidi M."}

After we placed our order, the chefs/cooks began slangin' sushi out like it was nothin'!  Almost our entire order came out in less than 5 minutes - this is a good thing when you're hungry.  =)  This particular restaurant doesn't specialize in sauces or seasoning.  Their thing is they want people to taste clean fish.  I'm a sauce and wasabe person, so that was a little disappointing.

Our sushi chef was great; pleasant guy who could quickly and expertly form up some oblong-balls of rice and slice up some raw fish like nobody's business.

We got the Lobster Dynamite special, served in oyster shells, and full of deliciousness.  We also tried the spider roll, some spicy tuna, eek, and yellowtail.

Lately, since the closure of its sister restaurant across the street, Hotei, Ebisu has been completely full by 5:30 pm on weekends, so to avoid waiting for up to an hour for a table or bar seats to open up, I have had to get there by 4:45 (it opens at 5:00) and put my name on a list for bar seats.  It is worth the wait, though, as it has always had consistently excellent, fresh sushi.  As a long-time patron I have come to know the owner, Steve Fujii.  He has introduced me to some amazing new special dishes and appetizers which have become favorites.  His lobster dynamite, served in three large oyster shells, is fabulous.  The tempuras are fantastic, with light, non-greasy crisp batter coating farmer's market vegetables, fresh shrimp, or my favorite, squid tempura.  My dinner companion loves the panko fried oysters, cooked to perfection.  I prefer the fried shrimp heads that come with the ama ebi order, and also the pan-fried sand dab, especially if the whole fish is small enough to fit on the plate.  Other great dishes include the sake-steamed clams (also available with mussels), and grilled teriyaki scallops wrapped in bacon and served with an amazing red hot sauce.\n\nSince I always sit at the sushi bar, that is what I mainly order.  Sometimes the chefs have specials that are only available for a short time, such as house-made pickled smelt, which are eaten whole.  The last time I was there, the chef prepared halibut fin sashimi dribbled with small bits of monk fish liver and shredded shiso leaves in a mild miso sauce which was to die for.  The seafood salad is also wonderful, made with several types of fish, seaweed, and pickled vegetables, with chunks of mountain potato.  This and other sushi dishes can be modified to your specifications and the chefs will also make anything you can think of, as well as creating their own surprise dishes on the spot.  I highly recommend this great Japanese restaurant, but it is best to get there early before it opens to get on the seating list.or after 9:00 when the dinner crowd starts to thin.", "author": "Nusi D."}

The first time made me wanting more, the second time, not so much.\n\nThe first time I came with my girlfriends. We were craving some fishy fish fish sashimi! We got the Oysters Barnabi and the Chirashi! We all got the same thing since we didn't want any of those rolls. The oysters barnabi, holy smokes, was that thing DELICIOUS! I dreamt about it all the time! Everything just melted together once you slurped it up. The uni, especially, was so delicious. First you taste the uni, quail egg, and oyster melting together and then you get an aftertaste of ponzu sauce, sealing the deal. We kept gushing about it even after our chirashi came. As for the chirashi, wow, so much delicious fish! Extremely filling and definitely worth the price! The fish was all so fresh and delicious. Melt in your mouth kind of stuff too!\n\nThe second time I went on a date with my boyfriend. Since he's not too fond of fish, we got a roll. Well, we still ordered the oysters barnabi since I kept dreaming about it, as well as the Ebisu Combo. This time however, the oysters barnabi didn't exactly knock my socks off. The uni didn't seem that great and it didn't taste as fresh. Maybe it was just the day and time... But I was definitely a little upset it wasn't that great. As for the Ebisu combo, I would have to say the chirashi is much better. The ebisu combo has an extra roll and not as much fish as I wanted. We also ordered the Swamp roll, which was good! \n\nHowever, they charged us $13 each for the oyster barnabi when the menu clearly stated it was $9. They also overcharged the first time I came with my girlfriends, $10 instead. But it was only a dollar more so we didn't complain. But the second time, there was no way I was going to let it slide. One more star off for that.\n\nOverall, the second time was just average compared to the first time. I think it's just because of what I ordered.

I've had more expensive sushi in The City but there was no discernable increase in value at these places.\n\nAtmosphere: Very welcoming and intimate. Especially compared to the cold outside in Inner Suset, the service is warm and friendly. Just get past the wait, possibly by having something to drink, and get ready to enjoy the experience. For extra fun, sit in front of the itamae (sushi chef). They're quite a \"punny\" bunch.\n\nFreshness: Almost all of the seafood tastes like it came fresh that morning from the sea. It doesn't have the texture that might come from refreezing and thawing fish. If you want an extra special treat, take a look at their specials and, better yet, order the life uni when they have it. I ordered it once and it was still moving on the table when it was served to us. To this day, it's still some of the best sea urchin I've ever had.\n\nTaste: Unlike a lot of other sushi places I've tried in SF, Ebisu's flavor comes off as well-balanced. There is no heavy reliance on mayo or sauces. Instead, a careful balance of more natural flavors helps inform the dishes. For a great example of this, check out the Dexter Carter roll.\n\nTL;DR: Great taste, value, and atmosphere. If you're anywhere near Inner Sunset and have a craving for sushi, give Ebisu a try.", "author": "Kevin H."}

We waited about 45-1 hour to be seated even though they told us it would only be 30 minutes. Whatever. It happens and we dealt with it. But after finally ordering, it took nearly 30 minutes to get our food! Hello?! We ordered non cooked items and why does it take 30 minutes?! Service was so slow! And sadly, the food itself was just mediocre. It wasn't bad but it is not that great or amazing by any means either. \n\nI will not be coming back. I was so unhappy with the service and the food.

So, I usually like to order something in addition to the raw fishies.  And, it's easy to do here. Their soba noodles with a side of Tempura is huge, tasty and effing huge. \n\nTheir sushi rolls are pretty standard. I think they really stand out in their simple, sushi and sashimi. We usually ask about what's fresh and then dig in. \n\nToday, for lunch, we had 6 rounds of sushi (2 pieces per round), a big bowl of noodles, tea and miso soup for only 43 dollars!

He said that they have the best spicy tuna and also ask the chef to make me your special.  I was thinking the best spicy tuna??? Spicy Tuna is one of my favorites to order back home in Hawaii.  I tried a lot of Spicy tunas and wanted to compare.  \nWe got their about 5:30 PM and we had to put our names on the list.  I believe they have a 1st seating at 5:00 PM and it was a full house.  So we were in the waiting room in the front and offered us hot green tea.  You can also order beer to get your drink on while waiting.  A table opened up but we passed it up to sit at the sushi counter.  It was well worth it.  So we sit down and order a Sapporo.  I ask the chef for the spicy tuna roll.  Made it really fast and served it to us.  My girlfriend doesn't eat raw fish and she's not much of a sushi eater.  But she was willing to try.   It was excellent and I must say that this was at least in my top three. My girlfriend also thought it was delicious, huh, really.  Then we requested the chef to make us his special.  Wow, this was amazing, not sure what it was but the combination worked.  I believe it was a ahi roll with toro, tobiko, green onions, and bonito flakes on top and a special sauce.  My girlfriend also loved it and she couldn't stop saying how delicious it was.  If she likes it then it must've been good.

I ordered the 8 pc sashimi combo ($16) with half hamachi and half sake and 1 order of butterfish nigiri ($7.50) and 1 order of tamago nigiri ($4).

The avocado they use is so tender that it could melt on impact with your tongue. \nThe way the rolls are made, with perfect rice to other ingredient ratios, will indicate to you that the sweet family that operates the restaurants are no trained amateurs. It is an art that they have cultured over time. \n\nLast but not least, the food presentation is definitely the cherry on top of the sundae.

In fact, I even got a friendly greeting from one of the remaining staff because she know the sake steamed clams are my favorite there.\n\nAlso, I thought I take an opportunity to finally write a counter-review to (at least in my mind) the INFAMOUS AND NOTORIOUS NOBU K.  The fact that people like me come to a place that provides a spoon to go with the miso does not make us stupid, as his 2007 review states.  Here I probably got a spoon because I ordered the sake steamed clams, but there have been other places that provided me a spoon with the miso soup and I enjoyed the experience (proper in his mind or not). To me, he shows so much narrow-mindedness in most of his reviews (at least those that have not been flagged and removed by Yelp, which he must certainly hold the record for and very deservingly so) that to me is unbelievable.  I agree with a fellow Yelper who elsewhere also wrote a counter-review of him in 2009 on another listing calling him nothing more than person full of hate.

The thing about Ebisu is that the food is good. You can't knock it. There's a lot of pseudo-Japanese places in the City that are actually NOT made by Japanese hands. The majority of Japanese places in the City are run by either Chinese or Koreans..*gasp*..yes it's true. But like most white-Americans, nobody can tell the difference. It's really a sucker's bet. I've been to these places before and the food experience is quite awful. You can tell that non-Japanese sushi chefs just aren't that special. There's definitely something missing there and you can't substitute it. \n\nEbisu offers something different. It's a Japanese-run restaurant with real Japanese sushi chefs. The only drawback to this place is that it's always so damn crowded. There's really no time when you can get a table in a hurry. That doesn't exist. You sign up and wait..and wait. In some instances I've seen people wait for over an hour for a table. The place isn't bad..but during rush hour (I'm talking Friday, Sat dinner time) you could be waiting quite some time for your sushi rolls. \n\nThe last time I went to Ebisu our sushi rolls took awhile to get to our table. It was at least 45 minutes from the time we ordered. It wasn't pleasant and we wanted to cancel since it was getting late. Yes, isn't that terrible? Problem is, these guys don't do reservations..which means they don't do the Open Table business. \n\nIn any case, if you are lucky to get your act together early and get a table, order all the sushi you can before the crowds show up..because trust me, they will. Ebisu is a very popular place. \n\nWhile the wait staff aren't much to speak of, the food really is.", "author": "Tiffany R."}

The miso soup is perfection - steaming broth with small cubes of tofu and seaweed. \n\nI ended up going for the deluxe combo plate (maguro, sake, hamachi, hotate, tsubugai, ikura, tobiko and unagi). The maguro & sake were perfection - smooth, buttery, fresh. I wasn't crazy about the tsubugai, but maybe I'm just not used to eating it. The whole thing was $18, a little pricey but so worth it. \n\nSide note - the rolls looked AMAZING, tried to convince my dad to order one so I could steal a piece or two, but he went with the Combo 2 (sashimi, maki sushi, & tempura bento), which he was happy with.\n\nSecond side note - they had a Yelp check-in deal which seems to promise 2 giftcards for Southwest Air, but it's actually for a raffle (slightly misleading, but not that big of a deal).", "author": "Claire S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-10-04", "description": "It is with much sadness that I write this review.  \n\nEbisu used to be my all time favorite restaurant years ago. I have brought friends, boyfriends, lovers and everything in between to this place, sitting only at the sushi bar (tables are for squares).  I used to come here before sushi became popular, before I had my first job, before it got crazy.  (I don't know how I ever paid for this pleasure before!)  The sushi chefs and the owners would see me coming in each week with a different person.  They would greet me with a \"Hey Teri!\" and turn to greet whoever is following me in, only to realize it's someone different than the previous week.  (If anything, the staff at Ebisu must have known more about my business than anyone else!)  They would ask me about my family, mentioning they saw my sister or brother there the other day.  Yeah, our family goes there a lot.\n\nAt one point, I used to come every night, dropping almost a hundred dollars with my dining companion as we gorged on nigiri, ankimo, oysters on the half shell, and whatever we desired that evening.  I remember this one night we were across town eating sushi.  We ordered one thing, tasted it, looked at each other and said \"Ebisu?\", paid for our one order, and left.  We hauled ass back to the Sunset so we can take a seat at the bar and eat what we knew would satisfy our craving.\n\nIt's been awhile since I've returned to Ebisu, and I was bringing a friend who hadn't been there in over 7years.  She was skeptical as her first time wasn't the most memorable.  But she was willing to try again...with me.  \n\nI arrived at 7 pm and there was no wait as I sat at the sushi bar.  Drink orders were taken and hot towels came out.  Edamame was placed in front of me as I waited patiently for my guest to arrive.  I was sitting in front of a new sushi chef, new to me, and maybe new to Ebisu?  The guy next to him I've seen before, but my regular was booked up on his end.  \n\nWe ordered nigiri - maguro, amaebi, hamachi, aji, sake, unagi, and ikura.  I was disappointed with the thin slices of fish sitting on my rice.   I was used to generous slices laid out over my rice, covering it completely.  Hmmm...what happened?  My ikura eggs were so little!  Two pieces smashed together, and I initially thought it was just one piece.  When I realized it was my two order, I felt gypped!  \n\nI ordered the ankimo and our amaebi heads arrived with tempura dipping sauce.  I always ask for Ponzu sauce to dip the heads in and had to ask not once, but twice for my sauce.  Meanwhile, my heads were not hot by the time I got to them.\n\nI'm a big water and tea drinker, especially when I'm at Ebisu and I have always appreciated that my glasses have never been empty when I am there.  Usually they are pretty good with filling my glasses so I don't notice they are doing it, but that wasn't the case this time.  Maybe they cup was closer to me than usual and they had to interrupt my conversation to ask to refill it.  But I remember when they used to come around the other side and just fill it w/o any interruptions, I miss that.  \n\nI guess the next time I go, I'm going to wait until I get to sit in front of my sushi chef regulars because I think that alone will change my experience.  Ebisu brings back such fond memories.  Gosh, the screaming laughter that would evoke from my mouth when I was in great company, and that was always without alcohol involved.  How  I miss those crazy days!\n\nUpdate: 12/01/06 - Sadly, Ebisu remains three stars...barely at this point.  The service was okay.  I waited for my regular chef, but no luck! The one I had was juggling too many parties at one time, and sushi was just average.  The only highlight was the live uni - see the photo above ($17.50).  Damn good for that.  \n\nUpdate: 11/28/07 - Open seats were available in front my sushi chef and that made all the difference!  They were out of live uni though, which made me sad.  But I had the bonito sashimi with creamy sauce and I just love picking up every single tobiko egg left in that dish. It's just so good with the onions and stuff.  Yum!  Good size nigiri pieces in general, much better than my original visit for this review.  The BF was impressed with the fattiness of our amaebi here as well. \n\nService was much better this time, and more like what I was used to.  Tea and water were perfect and I didn't feel any vultures on me.  And of course, hearing \"Hi Teri!\" didn't hurt either.  Their stars went back up to a four now.", "author": "Teri C."}

If you're a fan of seafood, you will really appreciate the variety of items on their menu. Everything tasted fresh and the chefs are excellent technicians at crafting and plating the dishes. \n\nWe started with a plethora of appetizers to share, which included the fried oysters, maguro and hamachi sashimi, and three specialty rolls: the poke roll, halibut tootsie roll, and the cherry blossom roll. The sashimi was melt-in-your-mouth good, but at $2 a piece, it will definitely put a dent in anyone's wallet. The sashimi alone cost $32, but I guess that's a drop in the ocean for all the medical professionals in the area.\n\nFor dinner, I shared the Ebisu sushi dinner and the kurobuta tonkatsu. Both came with miso soup, which would later turn out to be the bane of my dining experience. I loved everything in the sushi dinner except the long neck clam. I can only describe the texture as rubbery and plastic-like, but it crunched with each bite. The tonkatsu was perfectly fried, but although it advertised premium center cut pork lion, the edges were just fried fat. The salad that came with the tonkatsu looked and tasted good. I'm not much of a salad person, but the sesame dressing made it quite appetizing. \n\nI was having a pretty good time at dinner until the waitress came by to take away the miso soup bowls. She clumsily dropped them on my back, spilling the leftover broth onto my sweater, jacket, and pants. I didn't get a single apology, only a look of shame as she responded with \"It was only miso broth, there's no oil in it.\" If that was supposed to make me feel better, it didn't because it somewhat sucks having to eat your dinner with soggy pants marinated in miso broth. Forget getting anything compensated or getting a drink on the house - It was pretty upsetting to not even get an apology. Come for the good sushi and seafood, leave before a dumb waitress drops her load of dirty bowls on you.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

At $15, there was a generous amount of meat and not too much batter. I preferred soy sauce and wasabi to their aioli, but I really liked the dish. For vegetables, the ohitashi duo was a nice light dish (spinach and pea sprouts with bonito).\n\nAs for the sashimi, it was fresh, and favorites included the escolar (butterfish), hamachi toro, and maguro. We also got a couple of rolls - the Tokyo tower was probably the prettiest one.\n\nAs for sake, they have a limited selection, but prices are reasonable. We had a large bottle of the hoyo kuro no Hana for $45.   \n\nPresentation of the dishes is beautiful. It's a pretty small place, so it's probably not the best for huge groups.

I've only been here once, but the guy that brought me here and I decided that there must be something special going on with the fish served here. \n\nWe decided the owner must be raising the fish himself. Or someone is pampering them, feeding them gourmet fish food and possibly even serenading them to sleep at night. \n\nWe ordered the Crunchy Tuna Roll which was sweet with a crunchy aftertaste and the Rainbow Dragon Roll (sans crab) added yellow-tail belly, which was very filling and completely bursting with flavor. \n\nI also had the miso soup which was delicious too (and I know why mention it, right? believe it or not I have had bad miso soup...lol) \n\nI seriously would not pass this place up if ever in the area... just to get at least one more taste of the amazingly good (possibly extremely pampered) fish!", "author": "Cassandra E."}

It's a sleepy little neighborhood joint in Sunset, but inside it's charming and neat. We ordered the \"two balls no strike\" which was balls of spicy tuna covered in avocado- rather bland- but it was with my Sashimi Sampler that I was blown away. The tuna was authentically ruby red, and the yellowtail and even the mackerel were savory and as fresh as it gets. Who would've expected that from this tiny place?? Nice surprise indeed.\n\nThe bad: The servers look a bit gloomy, but that was probably because we walked in close to when lunch time was wrapping up.\n\nThe good: If you're into those authentic Japanese appetizers like fried oysters or salmon cheek this is a great place to come.\n\nAmbiance: trendy, authentic Japanese\n\nOverall: Great for lunch and/or dinner, some of the freshest sushi i've had in the bay area. The only competitor for me is Geta sushi in Piedmont on the east bay.", "author": "Jackie T."}

Luckily Ebisu had a rather short wait time (on this particular night), so that lowered my cortisol level as we stepped into a dimly lit Japanese restaurant. \n\n~Orders were taken right away-no complaints there. \n\nOkay, so here is goes. After our orders were taken, we practically became invisible in there. We were situated in the corner (but no excuse to forget about your customers).  Our food did not come until about 30 minutes after we ordered. To add an insult to injury, the couple who were seated AFTER us, received their food way before I did. And as a hungry man you can imagine the rage filling up in me (although I kept my composure). \n\nOrder 5 dishes, only 4 came as we sat there/ my stomach lining getting ready to devour that 5th dishes that never came. So I flagged down the waitress pondering where the missing 5th dish is. Because we already finished the 4 dishes that were brought us prior, she had no way of knowing what we ate already, and what the 5th dish is. Luckily we still had the menu in front of us, and due to the process of elimination we were able to narrow it down to that elusive 5th dish. \n\nlong story short: we ate the 5th dish, it was good.\n\n\nNotable:\n+Decor\n++Short wait time (Saturday evening)\n+Presentation of the dishes\n\nRating...?\nThree starts because of the little incident stated above.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-03-07", "description": "Went on Thursday night 7:30PM. And we waited about 20 minutes. There is small waiting area outside of the dining area to avoid cold weather outside. I noticed people started their bill and ordered drinks while waiting. Place looks really modern and updated. I like it. Dining area is not that big. Has many two person cafe tables that can be combined together to make larger tables. There is also seating at sushi bar with three chefs working the station.\n\nOrdered:\nSappora Draft $5-good price!\nEbisu Sushi Dinner $25-(Tuna, long neck clam, freshwater eel, yellowtail tuna, scallop, salmon, salmon roe, hirame and flying fish roe nigiri sushi with kappa maki and spicy tuna maki )-not bad and fair price for the variety and amount. I think I would like to try the Chirashi $17.5 next time. There was too much rice after eatting this plate.\nDouble Hamachi Roll $12.95-Yellowtail and green onion inside out roll with yellowtail tuna, green onion and tobiko on top-I love Hamachi, but I was in love with this roll. Actually, I was a little disappointed with the over taste and texture of this roll. I will not be ordering this next time, eventhough I still love Hamachi.\nPoke Roll $6.95 (Chopped albacore tuna seasoned with soy sauce, Japanese seven spices and onion)-I like this. I would definitely re-order it.\n\nOn the blackboard which is seasonal items ordered:\nDynamite Oyster with Uni $10-(Baked oysters with cream).See picture. I LOVED THIS. It was so creative. Somehow they found the right receipe and wrapped the oyster juice and some kind of cream. When you eat it, you are eatting the freshness of the oyster and able to drink the seafood juice from the shell. I loved it. I am sure it was fatty, but it was such a clever dish. \n\nAfter trying this blackboard item (these are specials written behind the sushi bar), I am so going back to try more.\n\nOne more item, I think was impressive I saw other tables ordering was their fresh UNI. I am not a fan, but I saw the dish. It looks very fresh and they like to present it ontop of a real UNI spikey shell. \n\nThis place is better for two people eatting.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-04-20", "description": "Very poor experience here, would not recommend at all.\n\nFirst off, you're in for a very long wait.\n\nWe ordered a lot of food, as we had never been here before, and wanted to see how they were. We ordered sashimi, an Omakase, and a chicken dish.\n\nAte some hamachi sashimi, and was immediately disgusted by two things. \n\n1) The fish was mushy. I eat a lot of sashimi, I love the stuff. If the meat is mushy, then that means that the fish is not fresh, and may have been frozen. Considering how pricey the food is, and frankly, just food sanitation issues, raw fish MUST ALWAYS BE FRESH. That's why raw fish is supposed to be delicious, healthy, and expensive, because you only use the best quality and freshest fish possible.\n\n2) There was lemon juice in it. This basically confirms that the fish was not fresh at all. You eat sashimi for the taste of the fish, the natural subtle flavors and sweetness of it. There's only one reason you would add something like lemon to a sashimi: the fish isn't fresh, and they need to mask that fact.\n\nAnd no, it didn't taste good.\n\nNext up was the Omakase. I could not have been more disappointed by this, unless I had gotten food poisoning. In the Omakase, we only received cuts of common fish, very regular cuts of the meat, and the waitress did not tell us what fish they were. She just set it down for us and left. Which didn't matter that much, because we knew what they were. They were the most common fish you can order, like tuna, salmon, and mackeral. And they weren't even good cuts of the fish.\n\nHere's why this is the worst part of the night. If you don't know, Omakase in Japanese basically means \"I'm trusting you to take care of it/me.\" It's putting your faith in the sushi chef and give you the best he can offer you. The freshest fish, the best cuts, the most interesting foods and presentations. It means something when you order an Omakase. When I left it to the restaurant to show me what they're made of, they came back with averages cuts of common fish. And it wasn't even fresh. And this is why this review is a 1 and not a 2.\n\nThe chicken dish was fine. Nothing spectacular. Very safe flavors, and very not Japanese tasting. Considering we got the chicken dish last, it made very clear what kind of establishment this was in retrospect.\n\nCome here if you want crappy, low quality, overpriced, Americanized Japanese food.\n\nBut hey, at least I didn't get food poisoning.", "author": "Tom H."}

He was on top of his game, which is always a huge plus and he was quite entertaining. The owner was there and I just love seeing this man.

My wife found Ebisu using Yelp and saw it was close by, (a short walking distance from the Academy of Science).\n\nWe got there right as they open for dinner and were the only ones there, but it became busy about 20 minutes after we got there.  The decor was nice and the service was excellent.  The sushi was reasonably priced and a la carte, unlike most sushi place in Vegas that are all you can it.  All of the fish was extremely fresh and flavorful.  The ginger was also very fresh.

I came here with my uncle and aunt, and boy do they know how to eat! They ordered a bunch of uni that just came in that morning. It was so fresh and delicious oh my GOODNESS. SO GOOD. The chirashi was really nice and had a TON of fish in it. The poke was tasty. The agedashi tofu was a little weird (no grated daikon,... and they had fried shiitake instead?? weird)., but whatever it tasted great. We also paired it with this really nice sake... I don't even want to know how much that cost my uncle. \n\nBut what really amazed me was the service. During our dinner ,some other lady from another table projectile VOMITED down the tiny hallway of the restaurant, some of which got on my purse. I was completely grossed out, but the staff was very efficient at cleaning up the floor and my purse. Thank god my purse is plastic and not leather- I would have had a FIT if they messed up a nice one.\n\nI was able to get it well cleaned, thank god. It was absolutely disgusting. But the staff was great about it.\n\nStill can't believe some idiot vomited all over the floor. She just drank way too much and went BLEHHH. Who does that at a nice restaurant?!

Parking is inconvenient (not their fault), and the wait is pretty much LONG if you're not going to be here when the doors open. \n\nI do not recommend getting the cooked food dishes - stick only to the sushi, and basically as fresh as the sushi can get. I got the Sake Steak, shioyaki style, and the fish was overcooked (so tough), a bit flavorless, and needed a lemon - which they didn't give. The salad, fried veggies/roasted potatoes were amazing, but I didn't spend $15 for mouthwatering sides :( \n\nThe tempura is a bit soggy and average at best. On top of that, the sauce just makes the tempura even more damp and flimsy, and the flavors don't even adhere to your fried veggies. I wouldn't recommend the tempura at all, even through they give you tempura brocolini - not sure if it's the batter or the cook. \n\nSashimi (yellowtail) tasted fresh, but it was lukewarm too, which gave the fish a bad taste that made me slather it in wasabi and soy sauce. I've had a sashimi combo before and recall the fish being amazing, so maybe they had that sitting out for a while before they brought it to us :/ \n\nFamily Roll was NOT impressive. The avocado was not ripe. The sushi fell apart when we tried to pick it up, and I'm not sure how fresh the fish was either. Would not recommend. \n\nLive scallop was pretty tasty. The fried tempura that accompanied it was delicious - now that was perfectly fried, cripsy, little oil, and full of flavor - and I could tell that it was really fresh. Plus the display is really cute - I just wonder why it's called live scallop when they basically give you mini scallop nirigi. So how live was it before we got it?? Curious. \n\nHowever, the service was excellent and the staff was very accommodating. The owner even came by and apologized that she couldn't seat our table of 10 together.\n\nOverall this was a sub-par experience at Ebisu because of the food. I wonder if lunch would be better since the chefs aren't in a rush to push out the dishes. I haven't crossed off you yet Ebisu, but you're definitely not at the top of my list.", "author": "Christal Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-12", "description": "This is probably my favorite Sushi bar for a number of reasons that go beyond just the quality of the food. Don't get me wrong, the quality is fantastic here and although I have been to restaurants that offer even better quality and selection, it's the overall experience at the bar which brings me back here on a regular basis.\n\nTo be clear, if you come here with a larger group or specifically want to be seated at a table, your experience will be a mixed bag. The food is still great, but your wait will be long, the ambiance noisy, the waiters appear a bit frantic and unorganized.\n\nOn the other hand, if you sit at the bar - either by yourself or with a partner - you will have an infinitely better experience. Especially, if you develop a rapport with a specific chef over multiple visits to the point where he already knows your preferences and will customize the food for you. Of course, this is true for many other Sushi bars in general, but what's nice about Ebisu is the non-threatening, non-snooty atmosphere. All chefs here are very friendly and accommodating. \n\nI guarantee you won't just have a great food experience but a fantastic social experience as well.", "author": "Andre B."}

Sadly, it was a wasted effort.\n\nUpon arrival, we were seated at a table near the door, with one seat directly in the main line of traffic.  We asked to be seated at a table further back, but were told that they were expecting larger groups for lunch, so they didn't want to break up the tables.  Mind you, as a party of 2, we were only asking to be seated at one of the 2-person tables they had combined for parties of 4, and the table we requested was not \"reserved\", just \"held\" because they get very busy for lunch.\n\nAlthough off-putting, we decided to take the uncomfortable table nonetheless, as the place was 2/3 full and the ambiance seemed nice. We rearranged our chairs from the 12-6 position to the 12-9 position and settled in. Our server then proceeded to win us over with his knowledge of the sake offerings and his generally pleasant demeanor.  Unfortunately, that was the highlight of our experience.\n\nI should have known something was amiss when another server made a point to bump my chair (which was now out of the main line but narrowing the line between tables) as he went back and forth, finally loudly blurting out, \"Would you PLEASE move your chair back?!  You're creating a really big obstruction!!\"\n\nNormally, I go out of my way to assist servers in restaurants--they have a tough job, and have to deal with more than they should, but the volume, attitude, and the look on his face (which said \"I don't want you here\") was just too much.  We walked out.\n\nTo our pleasant server--sorry we didn't stay, order a big, expensive lunch (as was our plan), and tip you well (as we always do).

Every single time I come here, I try something different and I've been blown away with each dish.We decided we were in the mood for some quality sashimi and I decided to Ebisu because you can never go wrong here. The line was 20-30 mins long so we decided to go to Yancy's, a bar next door, to pass the time. When we got back to the restaurant, we were seated right away. We got the lobster tempura, sashimi platter for 2, Bluefin Tuna toro and the 49er roll. \nThe highlights of this meal was DEFINITELY the sashimi. Maybe we were a little tipsy from the bar next door but I don't know why we decided to get the lobster tempura since we were only in the mood for sashmi.It wasn't a bad choice though! There were huge lobster chunks that were deep fried to a nice crunchy texture. The sauces they drizzled on top was perfect with the dish. However, we could've done without that dish just because we weren't in the mood for something fried. It was around $20.The 49er roll was good. Nothing to complain or rave about. \nBut oh my gawd...was the sashmi delicious. The Bluefin Toro blew our minds. I don't even know how to describe it just because it was that delicious. It didn't even seem like we were eating fish just because the chunk literally melted into our mouths and the sweet vinegary  rice paired so perfectly with the tuna. It was SO good. However, it was a $16 dish for only two pieces...I think it's because tuna is becoming endangered. Oh for the love of God, please let there be more tuna. We need to do whatever it takes to save this delicious fish.....and still be able to eat them. *Still drooling*\nAnother great dish here was the sashimi platter. We got the $25 platter that can feed 1-2 people. It was also really delicious. The variety of fish were perfect and fresh. There are a lot of places that have sashimi platters and their fish is so chewy! The texture here is just so drool worthy and honestly, you forget you're eating fish.\n\nI love love love this place. However, because the price and quantity of the food they have here is a little bit high for me, I come here when I feel like I want to treat myself. I think eating at Ebisu has raised my standards for good sushi and I recommend everyone to try it here at least once.", "author": "Lina L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-11-28", "description": "I was so disappointed and so disheartened that this place is busy over places so much more deserving, that I'm writing my second Yelp review ever.\n\nFirst, the sushi is nothing special and overpriced. This was my first time coming to this place, and based on the wait and how busy it was inside, I was expecting it to be delicious. Nope. When my first roll came out, I couldn't believe how thin, soggy and wimpy it was. It was sad. My second was decent, but certainly nothing worth waiting for. I was with three other people, none of whom raved about their food either. I can name five other sushi joints within 3 miles with far better sushi, I just happened to be with someone who wanted to try this place. She was disappointed, too.\n\nBut, the biggest disappointment was not the food . . . it was the final impression. Not 5 minutes - - really, 5 minutes, I'm not joking - - after we settled our $90 something dollar bill, the hostess came to our table, where we were sipping on the last of our drinks and chatting, and ASKED US TO LEAVE because she needed the table, because there was a wait. Had we been lingering after dinner for 20 or 30 minutes, and after a few not so subtle hints to leave, had this occurred in a more friendly manner, I might have been cool with this. But, after 5 minutes!!!?? After leaving a sizable tip for a lackluster meal??? While we were still finishing our drinks???!!! This is unacceptable.\n\nHaving worked in the restaurant industry in my early 20s, it's obvious that this is absolutely one of those restaurants that pushes through people to just keep the tables turning. Normally these type of places just rush you through your food, but I've never actually been kicked out of my table. \n\nSushi bars are a dime a dozen in SF  . . . This one, with its so-so, but nothing special food and outrageously disrespectful attitudes towards the customers that keep it in business, doesn't deserve to be in business.\n\nI'm happy to go somewhere where I'm not treated like cattle and I can finish the drink I paid for.", "author": "Trisha W."}

We walked into a cozy restaurant with a nice newly remodeled interior. The place had an industrial/modern vibe and I was really enjoying the decor.\n\nEbisu offers a wide array of dishes. From hot/cold appetizers to bento combination boxes to barbequed skewers to sushi, their menu covers a good range of Japanese food.\n\nBetween the two of us we shared the following items:\n\nAgedashi Tofu\n*Fried tofu served in tempura broth served with negi, daikon, and ginger\n*There was a light batter around the soft, silken tofu that got slightly soggy after sitting in the broth. I suggest eating this dish quickly when it comes out.\n*I really enjoyed the broth that came with this appetizer.\n\nSukiyaki\n*Japanese style iron pot with Kobe Beef, fishcake, tofu, carrots, napa cabbage, and glass noodles.\n*Dish comes with a bowl of rice and miso soup on the side.\n*This pot of sukiyaki is HUGE and there are plenty of ingredients inside. I would recommend splitting this between two people and ordering an appetizer and sushi roll on the side.\n*The Kobe Beef was sliced thin and a little raw when the dish came out. If you like your beef a little more cooked you can leave it sitting in the hot broth a little longer.\n*The broth in the sukiyaki was even better than the agedashi tofu broth!\n\nDouble Hamachi Roll\n*Yellowtail, Scallion, and Tobiko\n*Who doesn't love Hamachi? I have no complaints on the soft, butter texture of the fish so why not double up on something so tasty?\n*The roll is fairly simple and still delicious.\n\nXXX Roll\n*This was the blackboard special roll of the day. You can select Chef's Special instead if you're extra adventurous and the chef will conjure up a mystery roll for you.\n*Salmon Hamachi Roll in Avacado Poke.\n*This roll was quite different with the poke sauce and was slightly spicy.\n\nMy friend and I probably over ordered a sushi roll and were definitely grabbing our stomachs by the end of the meal.\n\nI really enjoyed my experience at Ebisu. The sushi was very fresh and the rolls were a decent size (not too big, not too small). There are plenty of things on the menu to choose from so there's something for everyone.\n\nAs a side note, I feel this restaurant is still intimate enough for a date spot with the nice decor and good food, however it can get a little loud inside especially since the tables are packed pretty close to one another.\n\n== A MUST TRY! ==", "author": "Jason H."}

The good thing that we didn't have to wait long for our seat. \n\nWe ordered:\n- 49er Roll   8.95\nSliced salmon, lemon, avocado, tobiko and shiso\n- Poke Roll   6.95\nChopped albacore tuna seasoned with soy sauce, Japanese seven spices and onion\n- Tootsie Roll    6.50\nHalibut or salmon with green onion, deep fried and wrapped in soybean paper\n-(Hosomaki) Negi Toro  Fatty tuna belly with green onion      7.50\n\nThe sushi was okay, the one that made a long-lasting impression was the 49er roll, with the sliced lemon on top, it's very different than any sushi I've ever tasted before. Not in a bad way, but just out of the ordinary for me. \n\nService was great and friendly, the place was really busy as it got to dinner time and barely any room for people to walk between tables. Kinda tight. Will I come back? Maybe, cause I saw our neighbor's order of Sashimi and its presentation made it really yummy...", "author": "Jenny B."}

Fish fat. So, toro was my ultimate goal that night. \n\nI know parking is horrible in this area and it took me a few laps around the block until finally the paid parking lot across this place got a free spot. \n\nThinking about it now, the valet was sort of racist. He gave the other couple a tip of what to order at the place, and all we got was, have a nice night. \n\nAnyway, back to Ebisu. I was set to order the lobster tempura and the kobe beef, but mostly my mind was set to ordering every piece of toro they have. \n\nGuess what, I got distracted. I did order a lot, like the kobe beef sukiyaki. This was sort of off putting. It was a teensy bit sweeter than the usual sukiyaki. \n\nThen we had some oysters, 5 sashimi (forgot which ones), and 4 diff. toro. The one that I was craving the most, I forgot to order. Oh well.\n\nWe did enjoy some of the dishes. Oh, she didn't like the Chawanmushi. The texture was not right somehow.\n\nAnyway, I'll be back and this time, I'll know which ones to order...and a lot of them.\n\n....obviously, I liked the place.

The Louisiana Hot Link was kind of dry but it did taste like sausage so I give them props for that. The other three rolls were great though.

My friend and I stopped by here on a whim after a long bike ride in the city and we suddenly had a huge craving for sushi. Unfortunately we were about six miles from our cars at the time and couldn't exactly bring our bikes into the restaurant... so we asked if we could put our names down... then promptly raced to our cars in about 20 minutes and made it back to to Ebisu just in time to get our table. Score! :D\n\nThis place is great! The atmosphere is very quaint. We were a little bit awkward in our spandex and bike gear, but it was incredibly worth it. It is a bit on the pricey side, but the service is pretty good.\n\nEven though we weren't at the sushi bar, we decided to get the omakase (it's listed on the menu for people who aren't familiar with the concept). Would've preferred to do it at the bar, but at this point we were just happy to have a seat.\n\nThe fish was delicious! Absolutely succulent and perfectly prepared. There is a significant difference between fish served here and at other standard sushi places. Now that I've had omakase at other places I can't say this is the best, but it is definitely up there. The fish is much fresher and doesn't have a fishy taste to it. There was a good variety as well, which offset the slightly more expensive cost (a lot of it was stuff we usually wouldn't order ourselves. The scallops were amazing. We even ordered another nigiri plate because we were trying to figure out what we had eaten (the waitress forgot).\n\nDefinitely a good experience all around and one of the best sushi places in San Francisco.

I lived the that hood when they first opened and I have to admit they make some pretty wicked rolls. Creative and delicious. Pricey for what it is, but hey.\nThe terrible service started almost immediately. AFTER we were all seated someone came over picked up the place setting of the person opposite me and moved her with absolutely no grace. Then someone picked up all of my place settings and told me to move while they moved and wiggled tables to squish even more people in. Funny nobody tried that when WE were waiting.  When I order, I would like to think the wait staff at least makes a note of who ordered what. Not at Ebisu. Dish after dish arrived and we were constantly interrupted by \"Who ordered the Bento Box?\"  Over and over and over and over. Nobody picked up the empty plates and just handed the enormous Bento Box to my friend and left her holding it mid air with no place to put it. When II asked about the Sake and the wait person answered \"it's ok\"  I just thought ohhh, wow, that was helpful, N-O-T. \nThe food is fine...not the best I've had and again I remember the hand rolls as being pretty good, but we didn't have that. The noise level is insane. I mean insane. I could not have a conversation with anyone without yelling. \nAs  the owners of successful restaurants say,\"Even if the food is fantastic nobody will come back if the service is lacking.\"  Busy is great , but they need to work on some service issues. \nMy last pet peeve is after ridiculous service when a server comes back to the table after everyone has finished and asks if everything is ok.

There's not a whole lot I can tell you that you wouldn't be able to ascertain for yourself after just one trip to this place.

Some may think it's a noodle joint but little-known fact (although after these many years it might be a well-known fact by now) is that they are affiliated with Ebisu and you can get Ebisu sushi at Hotei. The line at Hotei is generally not as long, plus they also offer a myriad of donburi, noodle, and rice dishes. \n\nI still prefer getting my Ebisu straight from the source but it's nice to know there's an alternative should the wait become epic some day and a plan B is in order.", "author": "Saya V."}

I was so sad that the Omakasi option was not available so I had to go with the Chirashi option instead.  My party was mainly into the rolls and I was more a nigiri kind of guy.  The whole party raved on the tastes of almost all the items.  People were 'meh' on the 49er since the lemon overpowers the whole dish.  The chirashi was on the smaller and less variety than what I normally get.  But the quality of the fish was still there.  I actually liked their hot tea for some reason.

You get a decent amount of lobster, and it tastes great with the wasabi mayo dip.\n2. Kakuni: braised pork belly with satsuma puree and ginger glaze. this dish is sweet/salty and the meat is so tender it cuts into shreds. yum.\n3. Crunchy roll: good\n4.

One little pop carried the full force of the sea with it. The Bonito Tataki, a true favorite of mine, was the best I've had anywhere. \n\nOn the downside, no reservations, and it is a bit of a hassle to get and stay seated. Took about 1/2 hr to get 2 seats on a Friday at 8pm, not surprising. Ended up at the bar, which I highly recommend, as our sushi chef made great off-the-menu recommendations. However, us and another couple were asked to \"scoot down\" during our meal so they could shuffle seats at the bar. Not the end of the world, but not 5 star treatment.\n\nThe menu is a bit unwieldy, with way too many items. I recommend picking a few things you know and love, and then letting the chefs take control. Everything we ordered off the specials menu was outstanding. When we requested the XXX roll, our chef went off the menu, I noticed the same things going on next to us, with the chefs interacting with the customer and coming up with a tailored creation. The Ohitashi Duo was really yummy and unique, if you want some veggies involved.\n\nThe prices are pretty standard for SF Sushi joints. We blew about $100 for 2 people with 3 beers each and a belly packing meal. They have a holiday deal going on, where you can get a $100 gift card for $90. Probably a good investment before you go.", "author": "Scott B."}

A couple nights before, I'd had some mediocre sushi from Jimisan across the street, and that unsatisfying experience set off a craving for some legitimate, good sushi. I turn to Yelp for advice, and this is one time that it did not fail me.\n\nWe ordered three things: the Live Scallop special, the Crunchy Roll, and the Family Affair Roll. The Live Scallop came out to be two dishes, with the more tender flesh served as sashimi and the more toothsome muscle as strips of tempura complemented very nicely with scallion tempura slivers. Delicious. The scallop sashimi was so fresh and sweet, and the presentation was beautiful. The shell was deftly cut open with a soy/green onion dipping sauce pooled into one half, while the other half held the sashimi.\n\nBoth rolls were excellent. The Crunchy Roll was just right, with nice texture from the tempura flakes. The Family Affair was amazing, with the albacore on top melting into my mouth, and the spicy aioli melding with the spicy tobiko perfectly. \n\nThe service was very attentive; our waitress was enthusiastic and patient in explaining the specials, and our hot tea (which was great, by the way) was continuously refilled. The place is small and can get noisy, but really, it's not that bad at all.\n\nI highly recommend this place for the freshness and quality.

The fish is so incredibly fresh it makes you not want to eat sashimi from anywhere else anymore. The sashimi platter had me at the first piece (it was hamachi). The hamachi just melted in my mouth.

After have read all the reviews, I believe Ebisu should be a right spot for Sushi fans like me. My husband and I went to Ebisu for a lunch on Saturday. Fortunately, we didn't need to wait for a table. The restaurant is well decorated in a very Japanese style. I like the walls covered with woods. The light inside is dim, so it creates a kind of romantic atmosphere.  The waiter there was very nice, polite and attentive.  One of the two ladies was nice as well. She continuously checked our table and added tea for us. However, the other lady is not that warm. She was blunt when she picked up the empty plates and asked us if we needed anything else when we finished the meal. \n\nWe ordered three rolls: 49er rolls ($10), Rock n Roll ($9), Crunchy roll ($10) and a Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box ($15). 49er Roll and Rock n Roll were good but the portion was small.  I was very disappointed on the Crunchy Roll I ordered because the flavor was totally off.  It seemed like that some of ingredients were not fresh. It had a taste like the peanuts went to bad. I did asked the waiter what was the green wrapping sheet outside of the sushi and I have been told that was soybean paper. I guess that strange flavor might be from the soybean paper. We definitely wouldn't order it again when we come back next time. The chicken teriyaki bento box was pretty good. The presentation was nice and you could have many items including miso soup, 2 shrimp tempura, a few pieces of vegetable tempura, 4 or 5 pieces of sushi, salad, sea weed, spinach(?), rice, and chicken teriyaki. I have to mention that chicken teriyaki was very tender and favorable. This lunch bento box could be a highlight of the entire meal.   \n\nI think we will come back.

That said, my favorite dishes are the specialty rolls such as the Family Affair, 49 Roll and Behind the Green Door - all incredibly imaginative and delicious! The beef Sukiyaki is unbelievable - huge iron skillet filled with so many ingredients I lose count, and it's also a wonderful dish to share. The teriyaki and katsu dishes are also top notch - plentiful portions with a generous helping of salad and roasted vegetables including carrots, potatoes and broccolini, something I wouldn't have imagined at a Japanese restaurant. Feels more like an Italian presentation on the plate, but I find the veggies a wonderful contrast. If you love batter-fried anything, try the Chicken Nanban; the accompanying sauce is creamy and wonderful, similar to tartar sauce. Also love the Kobe beef kushiyaki; yes the skewers are small, but the meat is tender and sprinkled with sesame seeds. We also love the touch of the salmon row on the California rolls - what a crunchy and delicious extra treat. The servers are very efficient and friendly - Justina is our absolute favorite!

Apparently they're remodeling, and are now combined with Hotei across the street.  \n\nI've been to Hotei a few times for their ramen, so now I wanted to try Ebisu's sushi.  I like the menu because they actually have pictures of their rolls, so I can see what I'm ordering.  We ordered the Arch Deluxe, QP roll( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/4Mm42zhUeBjXyu9ixOXC0A/l ), 49er roll, Double Hamachi Roll( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/3Z-7na4vp4ih-77jCsm4Bg/l ), and some potstickers( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/XSbuN3J0uc8b0DZ2QasL8w/l ).  \n\nUnfortunately, the food didn't taste as good as it looked in the pictures.  The Arch Deluxe and QP rolls were the only ones that I thought were decent.  The other two just seemed too mushy.  Nothing really stood out to make me want to come back.  And the potstickers were burnt on the bottoms, and the skins were too thin so they'd break apart easily.  I've definitely had better.\n\nLooking at Yelp, I see alot of good reviews, so maybe I just went on an off night. I'll be back for Hotei's ramen, but I don' t know if I want to risk getting Ebisu's meh sushi again.", "author": "Patra I."}

The lady taking the names down said the wait would be around 45 minutes but we decided to stay anyways. It actually turned out like two parties from the list left which made the wait shorter. We were seated around 20 minutes. The restaurant is different from other Japanese restaurants that I usually go to. They have a lot of fancy dishes that are reasonably priced. \n\nThe menu is not like your typical Japanese restaurants menu. Let me just say that the service was GREAT. The waitress named ANITA I believe was really helpful and answered any questions we had about the different dishes on the menu. She also told us about the specials of the night. She was very informative on some of the dishes we weren't sure about. She also checked on us time to time to make sure we were enjoying our meal and to see if we needed anything. GREAT customer service!\n\nThis is what we ordered: \n\nKakuni  -Soy braised pork belly with satsuma imo puree and ginger soy demi glace \n\nSalmon Shioyaki -Yuzu soy marinated with teriyaki glaze\n\nDeluxe  sushi -Tuna, clam, freshwater eel, yellowtail tuna, scallop, salmon, salmon roe and sea urchin nigiri sushi with king california maki\n\nPoke Roll  - Chopped albacore tuna seasoned with soy sauce, Japanese seven spices and onion\n\nThe kakuni was delicious. It was cooked perfectly. The sauce was fingerlickin good. There was a good amount of fat and meat. It tasted like baby back ribs to me without the bone. Salmon shioyaki was a good deal. The marinate definitely gave the fish that great flavor. And it was actual Salmon pieces. Not a fillet like at other restaurants. And it came with two big pieces. It was accompanied with sauteed pieces of really tender eggplant slices. Mmmm. The poke roll was alright. I wanted a spicy tuna roll but they don't carry it. The waitress suggested the poke roll instead. It wasn't even spicy so I would pass on this next time. The deluxe sushi came with fresh pieces of fish and california roll made with REAL CRAB. \n\nThis was a great experience and look forward to coming here again. Most likely not during a busy day tho.", "author": "Fran N."}

I was nervous it would be insulting to the sushi chef to have a toddler sit there but I think he was actually shocked about him eating an entire real fish maki. Anyways, we tried a bunch of rolls and loved everyone. I would especially recommend the scallop. Amazing. The only thing that wasn't thrilling was the clam on daily special sushi we ordered.

This is encouraged here. I constantly have the feeling of being in a very fancy and well to do sushi restaurant without feeling the pressures of price or formality.\n\nEveryone is very friendly and there are some real sushi delicacies on the  menu.

I use to wait tables so I give them a lot of slack, but this was unacceptable. \n\nSo the awful experience: our waiter struts over with this appetizer, sets it down and walks away. I'm pretty sure we didn't order this dish, so I get his attention and he comes back. He looks at the dish proceeds to tell me the dish name and just stares at me. I respond by saying \"oh, I don't know what this is.... I don't think we ordered this?\" He opens the menu, shoves it in my face points to the dish on the menu then just stares at me again. After this weird staring contest he picks up the dish turns to the table BEHIND us and sets it on their table and tells us \"oh, wrong table\", and then just walks away. He didn't even have the decency to apologize. Unfortunately, that isn't even the end of the story. When paying  the bill we decided to pay in cash. the bill came out to around 42 dollars so we put in 60 because we didn't have change. The guy picks up the bill and never comes back with our change. We sat there for 20 minutes waiting..... I would understand if it was extremely packed and no one was able to get to the register to give out change but it wasn't even that busy. We tried to get our waiters attention, but he just ignored us. We were so annoyed we just ended up leaving.", "author": "Elle C."}

It took awhile for them to even bring us water, but once our waitress showed up she was really great, and even made some great suggestions about the menu.\n\nTheir specialty rolls are a lot cheaper (and still just as big) as other places. However, be aware that they aren't all wrapped in seaweed. They're wrapped in this pink soybean paper. Maybe I'm not as much of a sushi junkie as a I thought I was, but I've never seen this before and to be honest I was NOT a fan. The soybean paper has the same consistency as the sushi rice, so it makes the whole thing feel kind of soggy and unappealing. \n\nI did also order the Two Balls, No Strikes, which I thought would be like delicate little balls but ended up being these huge honking monster balls of fish and avocado. They actually look amusingly suggestive! And are delicious! However, I wish I'd known just how giant those balls were, because they filled me up so much I could barely touch my soybean-encased rolls. *That's What She Said*\n\nAlso, their $1 draft beers are excellent, but it requires at least $15 of food so...if you think you're coming for some cheap beer and nothing else, you are most mistaken. I spent quite a bit of money and maybe it was just my rolls, but I left feeling sort of gross. However, my girlfriends really loved all their food (Spider and XXX roll), so maybe I just need to order something different.\n\nI also really like their bathrooms.

That's right people, I came with the sole purpose of the live uni and nothing else. Eat with purpose!\n\nI came here on a weekend for lunch with a friend and the place was empty which got me a little nervous but later on, I would be glad for the good fortune as the sushi chef gave us his undivided attention the entire time there.\n\nMy friend and I ordered just 1 order of the live uni. What was incredible is they take the live sea urchin and split it open right in front of you and put the hollow shell face down on a bed of ice. So while you eat it, you can watch the spines still moving! Great show and presentation.\n\nWhat made this even more unique is when the chef put it in front of us, he apologized that the pieces were so small (I guess they were smaller than average? Honestly I couldn't tell) so he prepared another order on the house. Crazy good luck right?\n\nWell it gets better as my friend and I were saying how the uni tasted so much differently than what we were used to, as it was just incredibly rich, buttery, and slightly sweet. I think the chef was so happy that we could taste the difference he pulled out a small box of already prepared uni and told us the uni in here is the lower quality kind they use for rolls and other pieces. He gave us 2 orders of this uni (on the house) simply because he wanted us to taste the difference between fresh/live/expensive and the boxed/cheaper uni. It was night and day difference as the boxed uni was slightly bitter, darker color and not sweet at all.\n\nSo in the end, my friend and I had 4 orders of uni for the price of one, an excellent time with the chef and knowledge of what's \"good\" uni. Again, I have no idea if the other food is good as we just had the live uni. But if the service and live uni is this  amazing and excellent all the time, then they could serve pure garbage and I'd be just as stoked to come here.", "author": "Alex N."}

I wasn't expecting to get full off tonight's meal, but I ended up leaving feeling pretty much the same - semi hungry. Here's what we ordered....\n\nLive Uni\nXXX Roll \nDouble Hamachi Roll\nUmi Matsu Nigiri (Sea trout)\n\nTotal cost added up to ~$68 after tax and tips. \n\nSo the food was delicious. It really was. As a matter of fact, I haven't eaten anything that can be comparable in awhile. The food was authentic, and didn't have any of those imitation crabs or weird sauces on it. It was straight up raw fish, period. If there's avocado, there were only hints of it, not all packed up.\n\nThe atmosphere was nice. It was pretty loud, but it was packed with people. Would make a great catching up place. Or a date =]\n\nThe live uni special was disappointing. It was pretty much an uni shell on the bottom, white radish, then around 6-7 slices of uni. I was expecting more - that sea urchin was BIG. But no, it has as much as around 3 uni nigiris. It tasted like... uni. I was expecting it to taste somewhat difference since it was literally \"freshly killed.\" But oh well. I'm a fan of uni, but I think the amount they gave wasn't worth the cost ($20)\n\nThe two rolls were great. The fishes were all fresh and firm. Dipping it with a hint of soy sauce w/ wasabi and ginger was exceptional. The rice had a unique hint of flavor in it too. I just wish it wasn't so small.\n\nThe nigiri was pretty much \"eh\" I've never had sea trout before... it looked pretty much as a sake sashimi (salmon). It also tasted similar to it. But then again, I didn't get to have a \"thorough\" taste, since the piece wasn't as large as I thought it would be, and I only had one try of it. But I don't think it was worth the money. I think I should've tried Tai or Aji. \n\nAll in all, the food was great. It satisfied my taste buds, but it didn't satisfy my stomach.

With the eyes of an observant hawk, they look for gesture and cues from their patrons at the coveted sushi bar.\n\nWith a frown on my face, my sushi chef would tell a ridiculous off beat joke, pushing my sorrows off center stage.  \n\nSmelling the scent of a recent break up, a few pieces of nigir toro (buttery tuna belly w/ slice onions) would heighten my senses.  They essentially are, my food ninjas.\n\nSure, new Japanese restaurants have been springing up in the Sunset district, but Ebisu has remained a neighborhood favorite.

Almost every night, the sushi bar is filled with satisfied customers exchanging smiles and jokes with the sushi chefs.  The d\u00e9cor is meant to resemble a home, but without the smelly socks or thong ( I meant underwear) on the floor.\n  \nEbisu goes through a large volume of fish, keeping the ingredients very fresh.  With buttery texture, the nigiri toro ($7.50) exemplifies why tuna belly is a prized commodity.  Sprinkled with tobiko eggs, the double hamachi ($12.50) harmonizes the taste of perfectly seasoned rice with sea sweet fish.  Highly recommended, the uni nigiri (sea urchin -$8) explodes with tones of creamy texture.\n    \nBrushed with a sweet glaze, the caterpillar roll ($9.50) adds double layers of buttery texture from avocados and eel.  Roll number 5 (currently running a sushi contest-$10.00) is all about temperature contrast.  Filled with albacore and maguro, the deep fried roll is accompanied with a sweet 'n spicy curry mayo.\n   \nSkip the tempura appetizer ($6.25) as the vegetable and shrimp lacked crispiness. Ending the meal on a sweet note, two chunks of tamago (egg omellette -$3) sushi was a great choice.  During my eating adventures in Tokyo, I learned that it takes a very skilled chef to master this multiple layered egg piece + meant to end the meal on a sweet note. \n \nAfter graduating from UC Berkeley in 2004 with a business degree, Fuji worked in corporate American but did not feel appreciated.  He attend California Culinary Academy and receive a degree in Hospitality Restaurant and Management. \n\nAfter working for notably Nobu in Las Vegas, he took his skills and decided to dedicate his full effort to mange his family restaurants.   Eric Fuji admits that his parents would rather he work in a career that was required less hours of work, he firmly admits that he choose this path because he is passionate about the work.   \n\nDespite working long hours, Eric Fuji appreciates that his dad took time to attend his son's baskeball games and cello concerts.  His goals is to work hard to keep the legacy. Currently, the Fuji family has an additional Ebisu sushi restaurant at San Francisco International airport as well as a noodle restaurant Hotei located across from Ebisu on 9th Avenue.\n\nFuji prides himself especially since the restaurant is one of a handful of Japananese owned Japanese restaurants in the city.  \n\nIn an attempt to show appreciation for loyal returning customers, a reward program has been established.

A lot of people on the list basically bailed, so it went pretty fast. Our waitress was named Anita, according to our receipt, and she was nice.. Very helpful and friendly, while frequently checking up on us.\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the poke role and kakuni. The poke roll was alright, but tasted too much like onion and wasnt very spicy. But let me say, I loooooved the kakuni (pork belly.) Super tender and delicious. Its making me want more just thinking about it. Its definitely something you should try if you havent already.. (For those scared of the name pork belly, the meat is a bit like ribs without the bone, only way more awesomely fantastic.)\n\nI ordered the deluxe sushi, which is basically a nigiri sushi combo with california roll as well. The nigiri sushi was good, and very fresh. Even the salmon roe was good (though unavoidably salty.) My one complaint is that they ran out of uni, but let me substitute it with one of the more expensive types of fish on the menu.\n\nAnother plus is them using real crab for the california roll. I however do not like california rolls. It doesnt even seem like real sushi to me.. My fault for forgetting to ask if I could sub it for kappamaki or something.\n\nI tasted the salmon shioyaki, which was good. I thought it was weird that there was teriyaki sauce on there though..

Randomly decided to pop into Ebisu in the Inner Sunset.\n\nI've been here once before a long time ago (back when they had that awesome pork belly app on the menu) and I had loved it.  This time was no different.  The fish has been fresh every time I've dined here.  We had a miso soup and seaweed salad to start.  Many places use frozen seaweed salad that they thaw out during the day.  Sometimes this can lead to pretty slimy stuff but Ebisu must rinse theirs out with water or something because it comes out clean and vibrant not dark and mushy.  Maybe they just have a really good supplier.  I don't know but that stuff is addicting.\n\nI guess I should mention my parents used to run a sushi joint and I worked in many a sushi restaurant in my early years.\n\nAnyway, back to the food.  We had a tempura appetizer; tako (octopus), hamachi toro (yellowtail belly), saba (mackerel) with shiso leaf (Japanese mint), and ikura with uzura (salmon roe with raw quail egg on top) nigiri.  All were fresh and cut in decent portions.  Large enough to be worth the price but small enough that it didn't choke you when you put it in your mouth.  \n\nFor the rolls we chose 3: Behind the Green Door, Hanukah, and the Louisiana Hot Link.  \"Green Door\" was on the crazier side with numerous ingredients.  Still very delicious and plated beautifully.  The Hanukah was a smoked salmon/salmon skin roll which had a bit too much rice and not enough salmon skin.  The famous Louisiana Hot Link was spicy yellowtail, burdock root and bonito.  That one was an odd but still tasty flavor.\n\nThe food is fantastic.  The space is really small so there was a wait the last 2 times I was here.  Not a big deal for some good food but the waiting area just inside the front door is TINY.  Last time I was here it was winter and waiting outside was a bummer.\n\nService is efficient and friendly but they need to work on pacing.  Our waitress was very attentive but kept trying to clear plates too soon.

I don't buy ANYTHING full price.. and if I do, I'm gonna try to find a coupon on line, or bargain. So my husband who is a total opposite of me, will splurge on just about everything. He would rave and rave about Ebisu, and I'd keep saying noooo.. lets do something like Yum Yum Fish. Which is about 1/3rd the cost. Of course he wouldn't agree. Until one day I agree... \n\nWe ordered his favorite 49er roll and some deluxe roll. I ordered the vegetable tempura, and a caterpillar roll. OMG the caterpillar roll was so CUTE! I didn't want to eat it. Of course I did, and when I did it was soooooo good. The ingredients were amazingly fresh and the texture was right on. I'm not a big fan of raw fish, but I must say the 49er roll is something you have to try, even if you don't eat raw fish. The veggie tempura was standard. They included some pretty funky veggies in there. I didn't finish it since I didn't know wth the veggie was. (even after taking a bite) \n\nI've been to Ebisu 2x now. The first time was a great, the 2nd time was great BUT the sushi chef was a bit sloppy. The sushi kinda fell apart as we picked it up with our chopsticks. Once it was in our big fat mouths, it tasted the same.. so hopefully that sushi chef was just having an off day. All good, we all have our off days. \n\nWill I be back - HELL TO THE YES! \n\nP.s.

Melts in your mouth and the sauce is amazing.\n- Aji Tatake: 2 orders of small Aji nigiri and the whole raw Aji fish was stripped of it's meat, skewered, and the rest of the meat was sitting on the inside with light flavoring. The stripped fish is then fried and served back to you. Goes GREAT with some beer.\n- Hirame Nigiri: I just love Hirame\n- Dragon Roll: Very filling for the price.\n- 2 Balls, No Strike: Spicy tuna balls wrapped with Avocado slices\n\nAmbiance:\nI've been here a handful of times. Despite the large crowd it brings in, the atmosphere is wonderful. It's loud and friendly. Sake bombs going off left and right. It's a really fun environment. It gets really packed on weekends, but that only shows just how good this place is. Sometimes customers wait over an hour just to eat here. The longest I've ever waited was a little over an hour. Sometimes customers don't even bother waiting and leave once they see the crowd, but I stay every time because I just really like this place.\n\nThere's a, I believe, a 20-seat sushi bar, about 10 tables and a Zashiki Japanese room where you can take off your shoes and eat on the floor. It's not too dark or bright. Seating can get a little crowded, but it's only because they try to make room for their customers in such a small location.\n\n\n\nService:\nBeing a small and very fast-paced family restaurant, it's hard to find employees who can keep up with the pace which is why they are a little short-staffed which kind of makes the service a little slow sometimes on real busy nights.\n\nThe staff here is very friendly and they always have a smile on their face even if something goes terribly wrong. It's all about the smile!\n\nThere are two servers who stood out the most to me. I believe their names are Maname and Charlie. They both give EXCELLENT service and try their best to help you  to their full potential.\n\nThe sushi chefs are very friendly and love to make conversation with customers at the bar. Depending on how busy, you can always ask them to try and make something different for you and they will do it.\n\nThe owners are usually there so you can ask them any questions that you have about their menu and all that.\n\n\n\nPrice:\nThere are a lot of overpriced sushi restaurants out in the city, but I have to admit that the prices here are VERY reasonable for the quality.\n\nI've heard/read a lot of people giving really good ratings for high-end sushi restaurants that have great quality foods and beautiful presentations and HIGH prices. This spot can give you that for so much more less than what you would pay at a super fancy sushi restaurant.\n\n\n\nParking:\nBecause it's in the sunset, there's street parking. But there is also a small private lot right across the street that charges a FLAT RATE of $8, which is alright.", "author": "Heidi C."}

The place is small and it gets loud in there.  \n\nThe food: it's fresh and I can always tell by their Uni if the place is legit and it was.  The sashimi and nigiri pieces are fresh.  The toro was not as buttery as I have had at other places.  When I ordered the Aji (Spanish Mackerel) they didn't even include the tail/bones that should have bee deep fried and served as your side.  That's a No-No!  \n\nHad their Chawan-mushi (steamed egg) and it came out just right, but needed slightly a little more flavor.  The 3-flavor edamame was unique and different which was a good change-up from the regular salted version.  Dessert menu, well, forget about it.  The best the waiter said was their green tea ice-cream and creme brulee.  Really? They didn't even have mochi!\n\nService: quick and ready to pick up your plates, since the table is quite small.

This was my first meal here since their remodel.  The dining room, sushi bar, and restroom were fully updated with a modern decor and nice wood finishes for the sushi counters and bar area.  After being seated, we were quickly given their updated menus, considerably different from the old laminated sheets.  \nAfter studying the menu, the Bento Boxes seemed like the best choices on the menu.  At $14.00 per meal, there were five combination choices of which I chose #5.  Here's what came with my order:\nMiso Soup - Smaller bowl, but tasty and just right salt-wise.\n   ** garnish - a small plate of three different pickled vegetables was a\n     pleasant accompaniment for the hot broth.\nBento Box - five compartments\na) Wild greens salad with cherry tomatoes - light dressing mixed evenly with the salad\nb)  Trio of Japanese salad - Three small mounds of Japanese style spinach salad, seaweed salad, and marinated pea sprouts.\nc) Gyoza - Four freshly pan fried pork filled dumplings with a spicy vinegar dipping sauce.  It came temperature hot.\nd) Veggie Tempura - Battered pieces of brocolli, carrot, lotus root, bamboo slice, and Shiitake mushroom with ponzu dipping sauce.\ne) Kurobota Katsu - Fried pieces of lean pork tenderloin.  Higher qualityof meat and small sauce compartment with katsu sauce and yellow hot mustard.\nThis came with a bowl of white rice which I barely touched.  By comparison to the competing neighborhood spots, this meal is on the pricey side, but the quality of the food justifies it.  We tried to order from their new specials board behind the sushi masters, but the selections are only available during dinner.  I will miss their Sukiyaki Donburi from their old menu.  However, the new menu gives me new reasons to come here.  If you haven't dined here since their remodel, you might think that you're eating in a new restaurant.", "author": "Mike C."}

It always takes a while to find parking anywhere in the city and I have come to terms with it.  The wait was about 20 minutes or so.  There are some chairs inside where you can sit and wait  or you can just hangout outside and enjoy the crisp night air.\n\nThe decor is really cool.  The floor, tables, ceiling were all made of different types of wood that gave it a modern Japanese feeling to it.  The staff is super friendly and are on top of their game.  The lady that was taking names in the front even remembered my GFs name as we left which is pretty cool.  You don't really get that anymore.  \n\nThe food was yummy for my tummy:\nPink Cadillac:  Grilled scallops wrapped with salmon.   Good concept but a bit over grilled taking away from the texture of both.  Still good though.\n\nHamachi kama:  Grilled yellowtail cheek that was hella big and contained lots of tasty meat.  I've had this at other places where it was a lot more moist.  Maybe it's not here because the grill was too hot and was over cooked?\n\nEscolar sashimi (butterfish):  Holy crap dude!  Best sashimi everrrrr. Repeating: EVERRRR  Truly has a buttery texture and melts in your mouth.  You don't even need soy sauce and/or wasabi so don't even try to use them and ruin it.\n\nFamily affair roll & Romeo and Juliet rolls:  Random rolls that were picked based on the description and both were excellent.

There were two nigiri pieces of each type of fish. I wanted to order the albacore tuna-toro but they ran out.  The fish was very fresh, however, the nigiri sushi did not follow normal sushi convention such as applying some wasabi between the fish and rice,  Also, the rice were not packed as firmly as they should be for a couple of my nigiri pieces.  The sushi chefs were very busy with a lot of orders coming in from the tables and they certainly looked frazzled.  I finished my meal with the house salad, which was unnecessarily topped with fried noodles.  But the vegetables and dressing in the salad were tasty - I just pushed the noodles off to the side.  \n\nAll in all, the fish was very fresh but the final bill was actually pretty pricey, I guess the price you pay for quality fish.", "author": "Kai C."}

For example, I'm starved--the only reason I don't hold out for a cab to Katana-ya.

ANYONE in service knows utensils and any course changes are suppose to happen before the food gets there, so when it does the customer can eat. Ebisu on the other hand, brings me food without utensils. When I can finally get someone to give me utensils and stick a bite of fish in my mouth, another dumb girl comes by and asks me if she can take away the wrapper from my chopsticks. Again, our next chirashi bowl comes and of course as soon as I can get some food in my mouth, a girl comes by and asks if she can refill my tea. Imagine every few seconds, may I remove this bowl for you may I remove this cup for you may I remove this utensil for you may I refill this for you may I remove this trash. \n\nThe icing on the cake was when the host was freaking out that people were waiting and tried to come to my table and serve us (the poor male server just trying to do his job saw and had a WTF on his face) to rush us out.

There were such thin pieces of salmon on top of it that you could barely taste the salmon.\n\nAnd, we ordered the Cherry Blossom Roll.  Again, practically all rice, and very minimal flavor.\n\nWe ordered \"Aji\" (aka spanish mackerel), which was listed on their daily specials menu.   It never came, and when we asked about it, they said they had just run out.........strange, since we ordered it at 7:30pm and it stayed up on their daily special list until the time we left at 9pm.\n\nLastly, their regular soy sauce is ridiculously salty..... I have had soy sauce in a ton of places, but none anywhere close to as salty as what was at our table.\n\nOur bill for the two of us $50 + tip, which I guess isn't bad for subpar sushi.

My favorite was the scallop - not usually but it was sweet and buttery and perfect.  The uni was also great, super fresh and a fairly large portion.  By the time I was done I was stuffed and full.  Luckily I had my boy there and friends because it is definitely plenty of food.\n\nIt isn't cheap though, but it certaintly it worth the price.  Go for some of the specials, really interesting and great quality.  For the quality of food, ambiance, staff and presentation I would come back in a heart beat.", "author": "Sabrina A."}

Both were lightly flavorful and just enough that our mouths were watering for our main courses, Teriyaki steak.  Some restaurants will say their main course is served on a bed of potatoes, quinoa, or what have you and they mean a twin bed at best. Our perfectly cooked, tender and very flavorful steaks were served on a king-sized bed of deliciously sauteed spinach with broccoli rabe, grilled crunchy carrots and just a few slices of Yukon Gold potatoes (superfluous as there was rice, too).  \n\nOne of the specials was tempura whole lobster tail.

Goyza - savory and flavorful; loved the sesame dipping sauce.\n2.  Behind the Green Door - had to try it - loved the skipjack and the creamy aioli was a refreshing touch.\n3.  Louisiana Hot Link - looked interesting, so we gave it a try.  Yellowtail was delicious but the bonito flakes gave it a somewhat fishy demeanor.  My least favorite, but definitely not bad.\n4.  Swamp - I will never eat plain 'ol spicy tuna again.  The seaweed salad on the top gave a good contrast to the spicy poke inside.\n5.  Family Affair - best of the night.

The maui onions are a great addition, making everything taste fresh without overloading on flavor.

My chef helped me pick out some rolls and other things I could have, and he stuffed me full of fresh, delicious fish. One of the waiters initially steered me away from most of the items from the kitchen, but came back to tell me that they could make the bacon-wrapped asparagus and mochi gluten-free. It didn't take much to sell me on that one. \n\nThe fish was super-fresh and delicious, with generous pieces of fish on the nigiri. My favorite was the saba; I wound up ordering seconds.

The entire staff works as one team. It we put anything on the edge of the table for pick up, it's gone in less than 30 seconds. They're not pushy about what you order (just how it's served!). Sometimes the service hovers around the \"We just want to flip this table asap\" side, but it's still the best we get in this city.\n\nOrdering: You can either order the full meal all at once, or a few items at a time.\n\nFood: Served in the traditional sushi master style, where the sushi is made with such great balance of flavor and texture that no extra soy sauce or ginger should be needed. If you eat at the bar, they serve you just the right amount of condiments. If you eat at a table, no one will judge you for adding extra soy sauce or ginger. The seaweed salad is the freshest I've ever had. The rolls are just amazing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-09-25", "description": "I hadn't been here since they remodeled, and I must say that I'm pretty impressed. I was just expecting to come here thinking that the interior was going to look different, but they up'd the entire restaurant. Not only did the remodel change the look of the place, but they have taken the opportunity to change the menu as well, and even the way they plate food now looks nicer. \n\nThe good things stayed the same....like how it's still really family owned and operated. How Steve(husband) is running the kitchen in the back, Coko(wife) is overseeing the floor, and Eric(son) is now working at the sushi bar. They are always so personable and so many regulars come in because of this.\n\nNow, the new things:\nThey now have sapporo and kirin on TAP, people. YES!!!! Now THAT'S what I'm talking about! They also have these mixed drinks that are soooo good. I think I almost made my \"O\" face drinking their Melon Breeze that had watermelon juice, nigori sake, and YUZU (oh, i love yuzu!).\n\nWe ordered some of the classics....natto maki, tobiko, amaebi (which I think Ebisu carries some of the best around the neighborhood), 49er, and QP roll. The amaebi heads came out fried with a dab of shichimi (japanese red pepper) and green tea salt, which made the dish very classy. I think one of my favorite things about this sushi joint compared to others is that the flavors aren't overdone. I'm all about the simplicity of flavors when it comes to raw fish. Even though rolls are a completely American-invented thing, I hate it when I go to sushi joints and get rolls completely drenched in unagi sauce or topped with too many different layers of fish after fish or just way over-fried.\n\nWe also tried a new item, the Panko Fried Oysters which came out w/this chili yuzu aioli. OMG, this was orgasmic. Although, I couldn't really taste the yuzu, it was still deeeelicious! \nBy this point, we were pretty full, but I definitely want to come again to try other new things from their menu. \n\nThe only downfall was that I missed the zashiki room, which they took out and made an extra bathroom instead, but I completely understand why they did it. As a customer, it had that authentic appeal to it, but as someone who once worked there, it was a BITCH to get in and out of because you always had to take your shoes off to go in. I remember when coming out of there carrying empty plates and glasses once and ATE IT....\n\nAnyway, this place really improved....2 extra stars worth since my last review!", "author": "Emy s."}

I was craving for fish at one point cause I was generally getting tired of eating steak and having to eat stuff at the house so I decided to do a hunt to eat at irregular times of the day.\n\nWhat to expect / what I had:\n\n- Omakase\n- Chirashi\n- 2 cups Onigoroshi\n- Sukiyaki [take home order]\n\nWhen I first entered that night there was a couple that was waiting to be seated before I was. Since I am usually a solo patron and when I was waiting to be seated I didn't really expect to see this place be really busy, but it was :O\n\nThe lady that was taking the people to be seated looked really.. really worried somehow. I was pretty patient to be seated cause I didn't really mind on where to sit at the time. When my time was up and she asked me if I didn't mind having a seat at a table instead. I didn't mind but I was in the middle of everybody else at the same time Owo! \n\nA friend of mine told me that when you are seated in the middle of a place by yourself you are to be expected to be an honored guest. I didn't understand what that meant but I took it as a compliment. At first I felt odd seated at a table that's good for 4 people but I shrugged it off. The place was filled with people from table to table. I was surprised that the middle table in the center of the room wasn't taken up by more than a a few guests. Sometimes, you feel a bit odd when you're in the very middle when you're eating by yourself with no companions.\n \nThe waitress was nice and took my order right away. I just started off with a glass of water and then ordered my first cup of Onigoroshi (lit. \"demon slayer / killer\"). Then I took my order of having 1 order Omikase and followed up with an order of Chirashi. When the Omikase came out it was the chef that was the one that presented it and served me telling me what he cut. O_o~! I don't usually get that type of service out of the blue  but it was nice to have. It was excellent I had much of the wasabi since it would have been a waste to use too little of it. All I can say is whats a good sashimi meal without a cup of sake or alcohol to go with it. I decided to go with the onigoroshi this time because I didn't really feel like plum wine. After my first eat was done I pretty much did the same thing with the Chirashi set. By then I was full, I didn't have time for desert but I did want to take something home so I ordered a Sukiyaki :)\n\nMy only downside was that when I ordered my Sukiyaki to go the broth must had something special about it to eat through the paper bowl packaging. D: At least... it didn't leak past the plastic bag it was contained in cause that night was very foggy / misty. \n\nI left being full and was happy with everything afterwards the waitresses were nice and smiled back. Also the one that seated me thanked me for dining there before leaving. You know when you leave there are times it should be like this. I'll have to come back again on a special occasion.... :D", "author": "Xeirhen V."}

Ebisu should be branded as a SF restaurant institution with its 30+ years of longevity especially in this quick, fast, up, and burn dining industry in SF. The recent transformation is absolutely amazing and hopefully it buys an eternal business life, at the discretion of the owners and not the economy.\n\nThe remodel included astounding handwork on industrialist and minimalist wood cuts. The position of each piece of wood deflects harsh halogen lighting to set a balanced ambiance. The tatami room was sacrificed for 2 nice bathrooms, which I appreciate the practicality when human nature calls.\n\nThe menu kept the oldies and goodies and has been spruced up with fresh specials and omakase listings on the board. Some of my loves are fresh scallops and uni cracked right before you. The smoked salmon salad was a pleasant tasty surprise: strips of salmon tasted like an Alaskan lox bagel on a bed of salad. When I can not decide on a sushi roll to accompany my sashimi and nigiri-based meals, the Triple XXX roll with rotating fish on the specials board assists with a quick executive order. As mundane as gyoza can be at other places, the dumpling are DELICIOUS at Ebisu, definitely worth ordering! The special sake and soju drinks are lightly flavored and pairs great with dinner.\n\nEverytime I think of sushi night, Ebisu is amongst my top 3 sushi rotation. I have to admit the remodel drew me back after a few years of being MIA. The sushi is as fresh as ever.", "author": "Cathy H."}

But sadly, I need to do so after visiting Ebisu since their recent remodel. \n\nOverall, I think they did a nice job of trying to create a modern Japanese zen-like environment. The new waiting area feels more like a dentist's office or a spa, but it's nice. \n\nWe were seated fairly quickly in the main room - maybe 20 min wait, which isn't bad by Ebisu's standards. It was super loud in the main dining room. Louder than I remember. Worst thing, was that the new recessed lighting in the ceilings is highly unflattering, not to mention that one of those little bulbs was directing right into my eye. At our table, you were either blinded by the light, or it was too dark to see the food or menu. \n\nThe menu has been all jazzed up, perhaps the prices increased too? Sake flights??? Come on people - the whole thing just seemed a little pretentious to me. Our server seemed to have a personality disorder. His affect was just odd. I'm sure he was new and nervous. He barely said a word to us. \n\nI do still love the QP and Arch Deluxe rolls. \n\nEbisu definitely disappointed us since their remodel. I'm sorry to say that I doubt we'll be back.

There was a one-minute wait but it's negligible. I read in another review that the menu was exactly the same as the sister restaurant, Hotei, across the street but my sister pointed out that there was no ramen anywhere on paper. Darn, I wanted a wide variety to try out all the goodies. That's likely the distinguishing point between the two restaurants. \n\nThe atmosphere was very unique and kind of warm but noisy. The ceilings aren't very high so even if all the tables don't have hungry foodies blabbing, it'll still echo noises. The staff are very welcoming and are attentive 90% of the time, I mean they are only human! \n\nWe took a lot of time to analyze the menu but it was pretty worthwhile to do so. A few of the quick tips suggested the Kobe beef sushi so we got that, the teriyaki chicken dinner, katsu dinner, dragon roll (see pic), and the crunchy roll. Aside from the miso soup, the Kobe beef came first. It was a mere 2 piece, which disappointed me since I was hoping that each one of us could try at least one piece if not 1.5-2 pcs each. It was alright...I didn't think too highly of it and was hoping the rainbow roll would make up for that. The next dish was the teriyaki chicken dinner followed by the katsu dinner. The salad was a giant heap, good thing. The chicken had a good texture to it. The katsu was very ordinary, at least to me, even with the sauce. My rainbow roll was yummy! I highly recommend it!! After all three of us nearly finished the dishes, we still were not satiated so we ordered the deluxe sushi dinner which is composed of tuna, salmon, scallop, yellowtail tuna, clam, salmon roe, sea urchin, unagi, and CA rolls (see pic). It's a sampler dish for the amateur sushi eater with one of each except the CA rolls. \n\nOur bill was $81. High in our wallets but it was a good experience.

Though primarily advertised as a sushi restaurant, I feel like Ebisu has more to offer than just your everyday catch.\n\nI started with the Seafood Sampler.  This includes Oysters with Momiji Ponzu, Asari Clam with Sake Mignonette, Tiger Prawn Peelers, and King Crab with Wasabi Cocktail Sauce.  You can tell just from reading what's included in the sampler that Ebisu is a restaurant that likes to find interesting ways to pair seafood with classic Japanese ingredients.  The crab was a little disappointing mainly because the sauce was not as flavorful as I was hoping it would be.  The prawns were you typical prawns.\n\nThe clams and the oysters were another level though.  The clams had a really nice, subtle taste of alcohol, which was topped with a solid combination of diced scallions and wasabi.  The best, though, were the oysters.  I love ponzu sauce, but have only really had it with teppanyaki.  Using it with oysters topped with masago was a revelation.  That the oysters tasted extremely fresh only added to the already delicious bite.\n\nFor mains, I had the Ebisu Sushi Dinner and the Chirashi.  Overall, the quality of the sushi/sashimi was good, but not mind-blowing.  Both came with a wide selection of sushi/sashimi, like tuna, yellowtail, salmon, etc., but none of the seafood really stood out.  That said, the sushi dinners were still really good and satiated my craving for sushi.\n\nOverall, Ebisu is a good place to get consistent sushi, but a really great place to try newer and less traditional flavor combinations.\n\nGET:  Oysters with Momiji Ponzu", "author": "Michael K."}

After settling on Ebisu we strolled down to find a rather uninteresting facade just off of Irving st.  Upon entry however we were very pleased to find ourselves in a very nice space. \n\n The waiting area was a little small however it wasn't an issue as we were promptly shown to a table. As some other reviewers had stated, the place is really nice on the inside.  A warm yet modern vibe with bright but not glaring lighting and comfy seating and tables.\n\nThe hostess was pleasant enough and the service was prompt but the servers were not particularly friendly tho all the sushi chefs behind the bar appeared to be in good spirits and appeared to engage the customers sitting at the bar in a fun and positive way.\n\nOur food was quite good.

The fish was well prepared, the rice was of good texture and didn't fall apart when eaten.

I bypassed this place many many times because the wait was so long but people kept telling me how it was their favorite sushi place in the city.

Our sushi rolls came out on a HOT plate and they were so loosely wrapped that they fell apart and unrolled before we touched it. Taste was really mediocre. It took so long to grab the attention of a waiter to order more so when we finally waved one down we got our check and picked up some pizza on the way home.\n\nIf possible, go to neighboring Inner Richmond and experience Sushi Bistro.

Much louder than a typical loud restaurant. I'm amazed that this has not been mentioned here. \n. \nI've gone to Ebisu for years and I've always loved the place. Sitting at the bar, putting myself in the chef's hands, it's always been one of my favorites. This is why we went there on a Friday night which also happened to be my birthday. The remodel looks great and for us,  it was the first time there since the unveiling. We decided not to wait for a space at the bar and after about 40 minutes we were seated at a small table in the now very crowded room. Since the remodel the tables are packed together. Honestly, we were elbow to elbow with the two-tops on either side of us. Then we waited for service that never materialized. \n\nThe noise level was so high you could have easily landed a jet in the place and no one would have noticed. The waiter approached us but then turned to the table next to us and yelled loudly, very loudly, asking for a drink order. They were seated well after us but for some reason the waiter did not know this fact. He never turned to us, just waked away.  So... we left. The hostess mentioned that this occurred often. Unfortunately, we never even tasted the food which by the looks of the \"new\" menu has undergone a change. It seemed to have more \"fusion\" type dishes and higher prices. \n\nSince I have always enjoyed this place before the remodel, I will probably return on a slow night in hopes of less noise. I'm not expecting much though. The hard surface of the ceiling bounce the sound back into the space. It looks good but it's hardly functional for a busy restaurant. The designer who came up with this should reconsider what they do for a living....\n\nBTW: We walked around the block to Sushi Kazu where we sat at the bar and had one of the best sushi meals we've ever had. The place is quiet and more traditional, much like Ebisu once was. We made new friends and shared sake and discovered a new favorite.", "author": "Ken H."}

Hot towels came, but were then left on our table throughout the duration of our meal.\n2. We usually never order California Rolls, but the reviews said they use real crab meat.  That turned out to be false.  We got the dinkiest roll I've ever seen.  Moreover,\n3.  THE RICE WAS LONG GRAIN!  LONG GRAIN!!! it wasn't sweet sushi rice, nor was it seasoned at all.  It was also brittle and cold.  WTF??\n4. The 49er roll, also highly touted, had the thinnest slice of fish on top, and no fish inside.  If you read through some 5-star reviews (which I just did), you'll find people who say they don't like raw fish but loved the 49er roll.  I'll get to this problem later.\n5.

It's not that different from de-prioritizing a vegetarian's review for a steakhouse.  \n\nBut blindsided by the large number of largely positive reviews for this place, we apparently turned off our authenticity sensors.

Ebisu is the standard by which all other sushi bars are judged and one I rate above even Sushi Tomi because of the friendly chefs who joke and serve directly from the bar. (Sushi Tomi chefs are too busy to chit-chat at lunch). Suzuki is a grand master and the remodeled interior is great - though I hardly notice when the fish is sooooo good. Don't blame them if it takes awhile to get a table.\n\nI'd do a detailed review of all their fish but after 15+ years being blown away by the quality what can I say?

They grab away any thing that looks finished. It's a bit awkward if you want to hold onto your plate if you finished first but want to pick off your family's plates.

I didn't even mind that you said you had a gift certificate that you wanted to use.  Ebisu has a great reputation and I was very excited to try it.  I was even excited to hang out with you.\n\nI also really appreciate that you appreciate my love of sushi and have a strong love for it yourself.  In fact, I learned a lot about sushi on our \"date\" because your are so knowledgeable about Japanese food.  \n\nI was also impressed that you wanted to wait for seats at the bar in a certain section because you liked that sushi chef.  When you let the chef just start preparing anything he liked for us, I was giddy with joy and excitement at the culinary adventure that was about to begin.\n\nThe scallops were outrageously delicious, as were the \"holy trinity\" of nigiri - hamachi, sake and maguro.  I tried the sea urchin, but was not a fan.  I know that's your favorite, and I suppose it's an acquired taste.  \n\nThe food was overwhelmingly plentiful as was the sake and beer.  By the end of the meal I was tipsy and full with a general feeling of satisfaction.  \n\nThat is, until you told me that your gift certificate was for $40.  \n\nI mentally did the math in my head and, well, I'm no genius, but the total I came up with was far more than your gift certificate would have allowed.\n\nWhen I offered to split the rest with you, as a polite gesture, never expecting you to say yes and still think that I was going to go home with you especially when the rest was close to $100 because you ordered a shit load of sushi that I didn't even want and you DID say yes... well that kind of killed the possibility of you and me being naked.  Ever.\n\nHad I known that this was going to be the case I would have stayed home with my cats and some pre-made sushi from Whole Foods.  $7.99 and no awkward hugging/\"lets do this again\" empty promises/dodging kisses at the end.  Because, let's be honest, I was kind of going though a breakup and accepted the \"date\" with you because I needed some validation (and you were REALLY nice).\n\nSo you see Guy Who Brought Me Here On What I Thought Was A Date, although I never expect to be treated to dinner on a date and usually offer to split, I rarely actually have to pull out my wallet.  I mean, have you seen me?  \n\nThe next time you go to Ebisu and let the sushi chef get buck wild with your order, I would suggest you ask your date approximately how much she intends on eating and prorate.  You never know, it might just get you laid.\n\nYou can thank me later.\n\nBest,\n\nRachel G.", "author": "Rachel G."}

Parking is extremely hard to come by over there, but luckily, as soon as I arrived, I got a parking spot right in front! This got me even more excited! Unfortunately, the experience was downhill from there...\n\nThe waitress (don't know her name, some girl with blue streaks in her hair) was pretty nice noticing that my friend had her baby nephew so she gave us a booth seat. The booth was narrow so my friend felt more comfortable keeping the baby on the floor under our table and not in the way of anyone. The waitress said we can put the baby on the booth, but we politely declined and then she said if the ppl next to us need to get out the baby will be in the way but they were fine with it and we said we'd move him if they need to get out, no biggie. The waitress then proceeded to grab the baby car seat and move the baby herself. Excuse me, but you don't EVER touch anyone else's baby. If you were to drop him on accident, you'd be dead meat. My friend and I got up and said we'll just move him then, but she insisted on moving him herself, squeezing her butt in between our table and the table next to us that's not wide enough for a person to fit through and then using only one arm that looked like she didn't have a good grip at all on the car seat and placed the baby on the booth that was, in fact, too narrow but she pushed the table in so that it would be \"more stable\". If that was my baby, I would have had some strong words with management, but I kept quiet because it's not my issue, but I do see this as a big issue. I used to work in big chain restaurants and she simply should have said \"Keeping the baby under the table is a fire hazard. Can you please put him on the chair or booth\" or she could have moved us to a corner area that had more space for the baby but not touch him. So that was how it started which already erked me...\n\nFood wise...\n- Ahi Poke Salad: They don't offer it on the menu and when I asked the waitress if they had it, she was clueless to what it was. After trying to explain it to her, I nixed the idea all together.\n- Crunchy roll was one of the better ones but it was still avg. \n- Cherry blossom looked really really cool but it was doused with too much lemon, which took a lot of the taste away. Otherwise, it would have been good.\n- Ahi poke roll I was really excited about and it turned out to just be a spicy tuna roll, smaller than the size of a California roll. \n- Potato bug roll was pretty good, but more pricier at $14 vs. the other rolls which were $6-$7. It was def not worth $14. \n\nI just wasn't feeling it. It wasn't terrible though, don't get me wrong. But it was average, which is why I'd give it a 3 star but the unprofessional waitress experience made me wanna drop it down another star but i didnt this time. She was nice, I think she meant well, but touching someone's kid is just common sense, not a good idea. Venue has nice, modern ambiance and is simple and clean. Maybe the plates are better?

Here's why:\n\n1. Itamae Isa-san is the epitome of a convivial, funny chef.  I arrived at 2pm, after the lunch rush, and the place was relatively empty (compared to Saturday, when it was packed!).  He and I chatted at length about cuts of fish, the history of sushi, and obscure terms like \"jabara\" and \"shimofuri.\"  If he didn't have an answer, he dragged other members of the staff into the conversation.  Did you know that shimofuri is a term,  meaning fat-marbled red meat, that is used for toro and beef carpaccio because shimo evokes images of frost, delicate and white?\n\n2. Isa-san cured me of my aversion to escolar (because of the icky watery cuts -- post-frozen --- I'd had at Daimaru).

It was terrific, cost me nothing, and will undoubtedly inspire me to order lots more of it from them!  That's good service!\n\n3. Isa's cutting and presentation are top notch.  He served my hamachi toro and otoro sashimi plate with a couple of pieces of halibut wrapped around cucumber sticks.

I like that Isa and Tommy (my chef from Saturday) have different cutting techniques, which makes for pleasant surprises even when you order the same dishes from them.\n\nI have such high confidence in Ebisu at this point that I'm prepared to give up my specific regimen and give them omakase freedom the next time I visit.", "author": "Andrew L."}

(This doesn't mean that I won't pay!) Seriously though, I can eat sushi every day of the week. For every meal. I LOVE sushi. Which is interesting, because I didn't start loving it until I came back from Japan. I take after my mom, who didn't develop a palette for sashimi until 5 years ago. \n\nAnyhow, I love that Jessica and I have very similar taste in food. Burritos, CPK, fro yo, sushi... she's my ideal dining companion. On this particular evening, we were craving sushi and neither of us had been to Ebisu. We knew that we'd be taking a chance there because there's always a long wait, but we figured that it was almost 9pm on a Tuesday and we wouldn't have a problem. WRONG! The waiting area was packed, but we decided to put our name on the list. We nearly gave up, but when a table in the tatami room opened up and no one before us wanted it, we jumped on it.  Personally, I think it's more fun to eat on the floor. \n\nWe dove right into the menu, and didn't really check out the specials board above the sushi bar. We ordered our standbys: the spicy scallop rolls, the dragon roll, and the spider roll. Everything was tasty and fresh. The portions were on the smaller side, but surprisingly, we were totally satisfied with the amount. We didn't feel the need to order any more. When the bill came, we were shocked by the fairly low amount: $28, including tax and tip. \n\nWhile I'm not sure if it lives up to all the hype, I'd definitely go back again.

In the form of your bill.

And at the bottom it says \"live scallop\" and across from it there is a nice round figure of a couple of digits that you absolutely didn't expect, something that is about 50% of the entire bill, and makes you blush and feel like the entire staff of the restaurant pulled a fast one on you and taught you some sort of object lesson in remembering to ask proper questions.\n\nDon't you just love surprises?", "author": "Tanya F."}

Horrible suki-yaki, jive ass rolls, and nigiri.\nBack in the day this was the more famous Japanese restaurant in the area, and pre-Yelp nobody else knew where to go nearby.\n\nJessica T is right. Ebisu and San Tung are the only restaurants in the area that always have lines. The only difference with me is that I will go back, no, CRAWL back,  to San Tung in a heartbeat and am willing to line up for their five spices beef noodle soup (apologies if some of you don't like it, but this was a favorite of my late father's when we used to spend Saturdays at the original hole in the wall location), spicy honey garlic chicken wings, and of course the boiled pork and cabbage dumpling goodness.\nI've always walked out happy at San Tung, even at its current location #2 that doesn't quite taste the same as the former #1.\n\nIf sitting at the sushi bar only and getting the original old #1 sushi chef serving you is the only way to enjoy a visit here, then it is not worth my time. Especially when Koo is just a stone's throw away where Kiyoshi-san's craft and ingenuity can easily give you improvisational multiple orgasms while jazz music is playing in the background.\n\nSo anyway, I'm in a foul mood today. \n\nLooky at the restaurant's website and their online menu:\n\nAppetizer: Matzoh Ball - Fresh ground fish with spices and deep fried. Oy vey, this is so wrong. What is a deep fried fish ball with a Kosher/Jewish food name doing here? If I were hard core Jewish, I'd rather be banned from the synagogue for eating nigiri laced with crab, scallops, and oysters, than eating a deep fried fish ball called Matzoh (and not in chicken soup either). OK I take that back, deep fried fishball is ok so long as it is skewered and served in a Hong Kong style curry sauce....\n\n------OOOOOO (accept no substitutes)\n\nMud Pie 7.00  (Sea urchin tempura) - this sounds so wrong. Inside the sea urchin, inbetween the yellowy golden brown lobes of gonads are some dark black yucky stuff. Perhaps if the stuff is tempura fried then the name mud pie would be apt.\n\nLunch: \nSashimi $9.50 - Fresh raw filet of tuna | soy sauce | Japanese green mustard. I thought wasabi was a horseradish kinda thing, or a root. Japanese mustard is karashi and yellow brown. \n \nSushi:\nTORA fatty white/red tuna seasonal. I like TORO (and of course the reviews of my man Toro E), but WTF is TORA?\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TORA\n\nor is it Ebisu's Freudian slip about the Pearl Harbor attack movie?\n\nNEGIMACHI yellow tail with green onion 4.75. How cute. Re-inventing something called Negi-Hama. Maybe it is a play on \"Nihonmachi?\"\nWhat's next? Negi-rame? Negi-guro? Negi-ba? \n\nEBISU MAKI salmon with vegetables 5.50 - OXYMORON, when they explain in ABOUT US, that Ebisu himself in the restaurant logo,  holds a fishing rod and a sea bream (tai). Yet they use salmon in their namesake roll.\n\nKudos for not mentioning spicy tuna in their online menu I suppose.\n\nBut bottom line. Ebisu Ebisucks.", "author": "Ken K."}

I'm only mentioning this because the wait staff at Ebisu won't laugh or sneer when your novel solution to this problem turns out to be kind of messy.\n\nAnd while they're really nice, you might wait a long time for the crab cakes and vegetable tempura roll, even if they're really good when they get there, and you may wait quite a while for your check as well. Ebisu is popular so it's busy on weeknights and the staff appears to work at a leisurely pace. \n\nBut yes, the crab cakes and the vegetable tempura roll; check the specials on the whiteboards to see if they're there, along with a lot of other appealing stuff. The temaki are worth a try as well; the fish is fresh and the proportions are about right. It's not the cheapest sushi you'll ever eat, but it's not the most expensive either. There's a heavy emphasis on big non-traditional rolls (There's a chaunakkah roll on the menu and I don't think there were latkes or chocolate gelt in it at all) so if you're looking for authentic this may not be your place, but what we had tasted good.\n\nIf you're looking for the best sushi ever (and you're willing to pay for it) there are better options in town, but check this place out if you're in the neighborhood.

The table is probably a 3 star experience given the spotty service, but tonight I was at the sushi bar and it was such a great experience I'm giving Ebisu 5 stars overall.\n\nThe hostesses have always been friendly and accommodating, but the waiter we had the first time I was there was a bit spacey.  He left two things out of our order of nigiri and left us wondering where he was for a while.  At the sushi bar we ordered sushi from the chef behind the counter, and other items from the waitress.  She was pretty good, but a bit slow on the tea/water refills.  \n\nThe sushi chef was really great!  He was friendly and talkative (though not too talkative), and given that he liked to blow-torch lots of items he was entertaining to watch!  He joked with us that he'd burned off his arm hair, haha!\n\nEdamame was included, served cold.  Here is the other things we had:\n\nAma Ebi - served with the deep-friend heads, delicious!\nAji - we ordered a second one it was so good\nIwashi - so fresh, tasted like the ocean (in a good way)\nUni - fantastic\nSake, Ahi, Hamachi - fresh and tasty\nKampachi - least favorite, a bit chewy\nRainbow Roll - yum!\n49er Roll - I don't order salmon much anymore, but this was good.\nNegihama Handroll - premade fish mixture, but yummy!\nSalmon Skin Handroll - done with the blowtorch, awesome\nMiso Soup - delicious flavor, but I would have liked some seaweed\nSeaweed Salad - good, tastes like it does everywhere\n\nI am happy to live so close to this place, and definitely will be back many times in the future, I love sushi!\n\nOh, the room is very cool too.  Apparently the recently reopened after a remodel, and I have no idea what it looked like before, but it looks great now.  Lots of different types of wood and metal surfaces, simple tables and chairs.  I'm a fan.", "author": "Lindsay B."}

Shorty, Goose, Kid, Sushi Snob, etc.  And even though this is my first review I must start it on the write note.  \n\nFor the last 11 years I have been going back and forth with my love/hate relationship with Ebisu.  It was a real treat to eat there...   Expensive, long waits and sometimes meaningless service.  But the Fish was excellent and pieces nicely cut (depending on who your chef was), the creativity was endless. \n\nFor the first 5 years of my SF Sushi experience I had 2 favorite haunts.  Hamano and Ebisu.  Hamano changed owners a few years back and went to shit...   I fell back in love with Ebisu and quickly became friends with the entire Fuji family who have owned and opperated Ebisu for over 20 years.  \n\nDont be fooled!  The new menu with all the fancy pictures is for the tourists.  At one point in time the menu was a 1 page laminated piece of paper with limited items.  Much different was the colorful unique items hitting the Bar and tables that wern't listed on the menu.  Such as: The Sunrise, Dinosaur feet, QP roll, seafood salad, and the 49er roll (Salmon/AVO/Lemon, an Ebisu original so I was told, not a huge fan).  What made Ebisu special was you were forced to interact with other patrons and the chefs to discover these hidden gems for yourself.  It's a bit different these days...  Limited discovery but still an adventure no matter how you order!\n\nTo be honest...  I never use a menu at Ebisu... I use my eyes and my nose...  Then I let the Sushi Chef do his thing...  My favs are Jackson, Tommy and of course the master, Suzuki San.  A local legend who speaks 32 languages!  Amazing!  \n\nI am always up for a new adventure.  Come join me anytime.  No waiting and the experience will blow your mind.  \n\nOkay now my review:\n\nFish is some of the freshest in the world.  Sake Selection is decent.  Beers are all bottled and they have all the imported and domestic Japanese originals.  Make friends quickly by offering a sake bomb contest for free beer!  Live Uni when available will amaze.  Live Scallop is top notch.  Ankimo is house made.   O-Toro, Chu-Toro, BLUE FIN!!! The Aji rocks!  Steve says he invented the Miso Butterfish that Roy Yamaguchi made so popular.  It is great here!  The Unagi is crispy and the Tamago will take you to heaven.  The Sushi chefs have lots of tricks hidding up their sleeves let them mystify and levitate your sushi experience!

I moved here from Hawaii about 2 years ago where they have really great Japanese food & the best sushi! Thanks to yelp, I've found some great places to eat except when it came to Japanese food, or more importantly, sushi.  After reading the great reviews on Ebisu, I decided to give this place a try. \n\nWhen I got there, the place was packed at around 8pm on Saturday. The decor was beautiful and we were expecting the food to be just as amazing. Despite the professional looking sushi chefs behind the counter, the food was very disappointing. First of all, the rolls were a lot smaller than average and tasted very bland. Second, I don't think they added vinegar to the rice. Third, the fish smelled old, which is a huge no no in my book.  \n\nI don't understand why people think this place is good.

Sounds bounce off of the modern wall material making the place uncomfortably loud and the drunk sushi bar patron ultra-obnoxious, lights shine in customers eyes (as my brother has complained), and the overall staff have changed from friendly and warm to hip wannabe this place is so cool so we can skimp on the service. I actually think they fired the great staff they had before, and I smell a lawsuit brewing...\n\nI am adamant about only yelping when I like a restaurant but here I felt compelled and spurred on by my WHOLE family who feel like a member of our family has been killed and a piece of our family history has been stolen from us all in the name of profit and progress.  \n\nLife will never be the same and the sun has set on this iconic giant of the inner sunset.  These days you will find me across the street at the sister restaurant, Hotei, where the food is somewhat the same but also losing that classic Ebisu touch.  Like the ocean tide, time came for Ebisu to change, sadly that change was ill advised and I hope Ebisu and company realize they have lost true patrons, the heart of the neighborhood, who have been loyal to them for decades. For now it seems that Ebisu has died and gone on to Japanese restaurant heaven. Farewell my Ebisu, Sayonara.", "author": "B D."}

I really didn't think much of this place until my best friend took me here yesterday. \n\nThe venue itself is a little small and it really sucked that it was raining and we were all packed inside in the waiting area. BUT, good thing it was just us two and we ended up getting a table pretty quick at the bar. I really liked sitting at the bar.  I really like it when a sushi restaurant is somewhat authentic. The sushi man who was taking care of us tonight always spoke in Japanese when he asked for something or took in orders. He was also REALLY attentive which I really liked too because it's hard taking care of customers AND making all that sushi for the restaurant. \n\nSo, we ordered the #49 roll, crunchy roll, a hamachi nigiri and a california temaki.  I thought all was really good!  The only negative fact I had with my food was the rice was a little on the crumbling side.  I kinda don't like my sushi to break apart when eating it because traditionally, you're supposed to eat it all one bite. Every time I picked up a sushi, it kept falling apart on me. However, their fish made it all okay. LOL \n\nI also like that they have a sea urchin just chillin' on a plate in front.

It was standard fare, keeping things pretty simple for the kids: chicken teriyaki, chicken udon, and a spicy tuna roll (that was for me). The chicken teriyaki was probably my favorite of the three; they kept the skin on and made it crispy. The sauce was slightly sweet and I'm glad the chicken wasn't drowning in the sauce like in some other places. However, I was a tad disappointed to see that the udon noodles were not as thick as I tend to like them. The spicy tuna was definitely spicy. The kids were happy with their meal too... phew.\n\nAnyway, I survived this experience with children so it's definitely enough to want to make me come back with friends my own age. Crisis averted.

Not incredible.  :-(  Was I just not hungry?  Am I getting sick again?  I mean, the hamachi was fresh as was the tuna and salmon.  The eggplant stood out with its melt in your mouth consistency.  The tempura calamari was good but I couldn't help but think a heavier batter (non tempura) would work better.  Maybe I need to go there on a date instead to have the food be incredible.  \n\n\n7/8/2006\nHmm...has their quality gone down?  I dined here over 3 years ago and the food then was DIVINE.  ORGASMIC.  I might even say it was really good!  Everything just melted in my mouth.  Unfortunately the wait was long and the restaurant was always packed.  \n\nI haven't eaten there for awhile and returned a few weeks ago.  I was happy it wasn't packed and I was served quickly.  Unfortunately, that might have been a sign.  Because the food wasn't the same!  The sushi....I swear it shrank in size.  The appetizers I ordered were delicious... I don't know... maybe I need to try again but I'd hate to have another so so meal with their prices.  \n\nNo complaints about the service there.  Always prompt and welcoming.", "author": "Animal K."}

Although I don't agree with the comment below stating that Ebisu is better than sushi in Japan (being in Japan before, I have experienced the crummiest, shady looking sushi joints that far exceed what Ebisu offers), it has it's charming characteristics, though this place would be your typical run-of-the-mill restaurant in Osaka.  I went to the one on 9th street, and it was small but rather cozy place and at the time the lunch crowd was piling in so me and some friends got some bar seats.\n\nI always enjoyed conveyor belt sushi in which the sushi goes around the people sitting at the bar, Ebisu didn't have one, but it's alright.  It felt like the food I ordered did not have any heart to it.  Watching these chefs put together a roll with their depressed looking faces were saddening, like they didn't enjoy the people being there.  They had a Kobe beef sushi roll on their specials so I wanted to try it.  I know that Kobe beef is expensive to serve, but paying 12 bucks for two rolls of rice with thin paper-like meat on top of it was not what I expect.  Seriously, it was like eating wet paper, you could only taste the rice.  I didn't pay 12 dollars for two rice balls.  Other than that Kobe beef special, everything else I ordered was sufficient and filled the craving that the Kobe Beef didn't.\n\nWhat I liked most about Ebisu was it's small private rooms deeper in the restaurant.  It's very izakaya (Japanese bar) like that you must take off your shoes and sit on the tatami mats.  I guess the three stars mainly go for my like of the interior of the place more than the actual food itself.  That really explains a lot, if you want a nice, cozy place with decent sushi go here.  If you want a taste that would blow your mind, go to Japan and walk in the alleyways, you'll find what you need there.", "author": "Simon L."}

(I've had sashimi as dry as the Mojave desert and as fishy tasting as that foul smell emitted by the dead whale laying on Ocean Beach... and that smell is BRUTAL. Just imagine tasting that. BLEHK!)\n\nAnyway I already had a preconceived notion about Ebisu based on its appearance-- it looked pretty trendy, clean and modern so I decided it was safe to assume that Ebisu would have fresh sashimi. And even if I'm not a fan of assumptions, luckily mine was correct! My friend and I decided to split the Deluxe sushi plate and order another side dish of red tuna sashimi. I must say, hands down, the sashimi at Ebisu is by far the best sashimi I've ever tasted. IT'S SO DELICIOUS. Like melt in your mouth, buttery, soft, creamy, \"I'm salivating right now just from remembering that sashimi, oh my god kill me now\" type of delicious. And usually I'm the type of person who passes on the salmon roe, but since the red tuna sashimi was to die for, I thought \"what the hey, if the sashimi that I love tastes like heaven, I'm sure the salmon roe (my least fave) will probably taste just as good.\" And once again I was right! The salmon roe was bursting with flavor. It was a little salty, but deliciously salty.\n\nAlso the edemame was spectacular. Instead of serving the traditional salted edemame, the edemame here comes in three flavors-- Okinawa sea salt, togarashi lime and lemon garlic fried. Like seriously? How cool is that! The next time I'm dying for a sushi fix I already know I'll be coming to Ebisu for sure. Not only is the food delicious but the atmosphere is cozy, the restaurant itself is adorable, the prices are reasonable and the location is definitely not out of my way.", "author": "Ally C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-08-01", "description": "What you consider the best sushi is a very personal thing, so I can't say that others might not like a different place better, but I think this is the best place for sushi in the city and we basically no longer go anywhere else. For the past 15 years we've patronized this place and have come to know the owners, a really great family. \n\nThe sushi is fresh and delicious and is cut from fish bought at the fishmarket, not defrosted from shipped factory cut product. All the sushi chefs are required to be able to cut down a whole fish into sushi. This is important because many, if not most, sushi bars in the city depend on shipments of pre-cut and frozen sushi from big companies. That factory product can be old, dyed, etc., you can tell if it's dyed by examining the rice that comes into contact with the sushi and if it has taken on a lot of the color of the sushi that's a dead giveaway, parden the pun. We judge the quality and freshness of a sushi place by eating the sea scallop; if it's sweet and delicious that is fresh. If it is nasty tasting, avoid the place. If they don't offer fresh scallop and only include it in cooked rolls, you know they are buying from a factory. If they push rolls that include a lot of cooked fish covered in sauce, that's a good indicator that their fish is not fresh because they are covering up the off-flavors by cooking and drenching in sauce. None of that is true here at EBISU where the sushi is great and the scallops are awesome. They often have live sea scallop and sea urchin too, which is a whole other level of fresh. \n\nThe only caveat to the positives is that occasionally they'll get a new sushi chef that is not quite up to the standards of the others that have worked here for years, but given time they improve up to the standards of the others. Service is good, many of the wait staff have been there for years and they are excellent; sometimes during off hours they have new people that are not quite as good, but again I figure with time they fix that. If you want the best experience sit at the bar and buy your sushi chef a beer near closing time on a weekend. \n\nThe only real drawbacks here? Parking is a miserable crappy experience here, and there's a long long line to get in for dinner after 6PM on weekends. Other than that- you'll love the place if you love really great sushi.", "author": "W M."}

It's the worst when you bite into dried seaweed and it's so tough you have to pull it off. But not this one. Great seaweed and great rice and ingredients.

Although they were really busy, they managed to fill my tea cup at least 4 times so I was never left without tea for more than 20 seconds.\n\nAll in all, I've had better sashimi, but this place is AFFORDABLE for sushi that's pretty good (and has crispy seaweed!). I will definitely come back!!!!\n\nBe sure to get that tempura appetizer!!", "author": "Angela H."}

Ebisu has great ambiance, a great sushi selection, great chefs, and an even better reputation.  It is without pretense, which very important for a slightly pricey restaurant.  If you go here get the Pink Cadillac; a salmon wrapped scallop, flash fried (for about 2 seconds), and served with some delicious dipping sauce.  So good.\n\nEbisu is a great place for a quite dinner or a group.  I recommend sitting at the bar, but I am usually of that opinion when it comes to sushi places.", "author": "Phil M."}

We've heard a lot about Ebisu, the hype and reviews suggest that it's one of the best Japanese restaurants in SF. Well, if it is, then it's just a reflection of the sorry state of Japanese cuisine here.\n\nFirst impressions upon entering the establishment; hmm, ok, kinda grungy and kitschy faux-Japanese look to it - I can live with that if the food is good. Service; Chinese restaurant style service in a Japanese restaurant, hmm, maybe I'll look past that if the food is ok. \n\nWe look at the menu. It confirms my initial feeling of the lack of authenticity here. We order a combination of rolls, nigiri, and Aji Tataki. The Aji arrives first. This was noteworthy, it was fresh, and considering Aji has to be perfect to be decent, this was a good sign. \n\nUnfortunately it was downhill from there. The rest of the sushi was mediocre at best. The fish was at least fresh if not of the best quality. However, the execution was crude, the proportions all wrong, the balance of flavors unrefined. The rice was terrible, and poorly prepared, and the nori was some of the worst that I've had - it was tough and leathery in texture.\n\nAll-in-all, it was a dissapointment. We're just going to have to drive the six hours to LA every time we feel like having good, authentic Japanese cuisine.", "author": "Adrian L."}

The reason I still go there  because there are limited choice of Japanese food in the area that are decent and yet, my employer picks up the bill most of the time.  I went there today, ordered a few Rolls and two of them are just gross, the cherry blossom roll and the so call louisiana roll (spicy hamachi).   This is probably the first time that I had a Cherry Blossom roll that uses marinated salmon in the roll that tasted and smelled  like rotten fish,and on top of that, the rice was overly waterly..., yes waterly. Too much water in the sushi rice when cooking the rice.  I called the waitor and told them about the weird tasting sushi and the waitor said the fish in the center are marinated and that's why the flavor is over powering.   Why on earth would you use a marinated fish on the sushi roll that would over power the freshness of the fish, unless the sashimi used is not fresh in the begining.   I was craving for a spicy tuna roll and yet, they recommended the Poke roll which is spice tuna, and the Louisiana roll ( the spicy hamachi).  I like hamachi over tuna, so I ordered the Louisiana roll. When the roll came, I had no idea that he roll was actually cooked minced hamachi and it's not spicy at all. I am really not a spicy food eater and that roll is not spicy at all.  Both of the roll sucks  and the remaining rolls are just ok..  The only thing that I like about the Ebisu is their bento box, love the variety of the bento box and it's fair for the price,   However, this is probably the last time I would go there.", "author": "Wil M."}

One kid even knocked our table and was invading on my partner's space while we were trying to eat. The parents saw this but did nothing. I finally said to the child, \"excuse me, you're bumping our table\" and the negligent mother proceeded to make a wise crack to us and then talk badly about us with her table guests. When they were leaving she continued to bitch and talk about us, so I said out loud \"stop talking shit about us\" and she then got in my face and started to rampage and say gay-hateful comments like, \"I hope you two work out as a couple so that you'll never be able to have kids\" then her husband got up and said to me, \"are you a supporter of Prop 8?\". I told the rude people to just get out and leave us alone.  They were so disgustingly rude that everyone in the restaurant looked at them like they were crazy. \n\nThe staff was actually very nice about it and consoled us after the crazies left. That was nice. Ebisu would have received 5 stars from me had they forced the crazy couple to leave immediately and stop harassing us, but they didn't.

They forgot about my friend's dinner order until after the rest of us had finished eating our sushi/sashimi.  It wasn't an \"oops, we'll bring that out now\", it was an \"doh - we didn't put that order in, let me run to the kitchen\".  They didn't even offer any sort of compensation for that (at least a free desert, or free/discounted dinner for the one that was late).  I'm only subtracting half a star for that though - figure it's just a one time thing, but still...\n\nAnd the crowd?  Sure, it's crowded, but that's normal, but it seemed like a majority were tourists/out-of-towners.

I heard so many good things about this place from friends and was excited to find another sushi joint.  I'm a huge Japanese food and sushi fan and always love trying new spots.  This restaurant was a complete disappointment.\n\nFirst things first, the place is small and parking in the area can be tough.  It's obviously a very popular place since there was a huge wait for a table.  My friend got there early to get our table, so when I got there I only waited another 15 minutes.  We had a table for 5 and were seated at a table for 4 with one of our friends kinda sitting halfway in an aisle and halfway on the side with 2 others in our group.  I tried to look past all this since the service started off okay and I was excited to try some of their rolls.\n\nMy friends ordered their food and I (being hungry) ordered a Poke Roll, a #29 roll (Yellowtail tuna, salmon, shrimp and green onion wrapped in soybean paper, deep fried with tuna on top), and salmon nigiri.  We received our rolls at separate times, which was fine.  I received my Poke roll first and it was smaller than I expected, but was okay.  The salmon nigiri was pretty fresh and I was pleased with that as well as the #29 roll.  The sushi was good (no major complaints), but definitely not any better than other sushi spots I have been to.  We also ordered some sake.\n\nWe were okay with everything (at this point I would have given 3 stars) and then it happened.  The bill showed up.  One of my friends had ordered 2 rolls and only received one of them.  She was okay with that as long as it wasn't on the bill...and of course it was there.  We flagged down the server and let her know that we hadn't received the one roll.  The server gave us attitude about the situation and said that she would take it off.  Great, right? Well, she sent another server to say that she had brought the roll that was missing and argue with me about it.  I made it clear what I ordered and what was delivered to our table.  We did NOT receive all the food listed on the bill.  After going back and forth with these servers for about 20 minutes, they removed the Poke roll (which cost less than the other roll that was not delivered to our table) from the bill.  We gave up and just paid that bill and I promise I will never go back here again.  I plan on telling everyone I know to avoid this place.\n\nLet's summarize...parking is tough in the area, the restaurant is small and there is a long wait, the sushi is just okay and the service started off good, but ended terrible.

Not all chefs here are great.  But they're all pretty good if you communicate with them on what you want; and 2. the price is high...  so it's tricky to control that when you go freestyle.  On the chefs...  Why are some of them not up to the standard?  I think after making spicy tuna roll, roll after roll, a lot of your desire to be a good sushi chef can just simply evaporate.  How good does one need to be at making spicy tuna roll...  anyway?  It's got lower grade tuna with a lot of hot sauce.  Buy it at Whole Foods if you will.  So how should one order at Ebisu?  You have to let go the old fashioned approach of trusting your chef blindly, but not so much as to embrace everything you see on the menu.  \n\nI go there (or used to go there when my rent was cheaper at a few blocks away from the restaurant) for the guarantee on certain items I love so much.  Black cod.  Live scallops.  The entire Aji prepared from head to tail.  Incomparably fresh Uni (or live Uni from time to time, if you're lucky ).  And once in a while I throw in Kobe beef sashmi and some salmon belly.  Or any other interesting fish that is on the special board that day.  I have not been disappointed.\n\nTo be able to indulge ridiculously fresh fish that many other restaurants will just outrightly tell you that they don't have it because people don't eat that here...

Now that they've remodeled, I decided to come here for lunch after a morning of energetic volunteer work with BFF and her hubby at the American Cancer Society's annual Strides for Breast Cancer Walk.  \n\nThe interior has been nicely remodeled and appears roomier even 'tho the space hasn't changed much. There are 2 unisex bathrooms in the rear, right before the kitchen.  We were admiring the beautifully polished curly Koa wood adorning the sushi bar.  Additionally, because we were so inquisitive about the redesign, the waiter told us they used bamboo flooring and sections of the old wooden walls (other sections are bamboo as well) were salvaged  from a North Bay barn.  Yea, for sustainable construction!\n\nBFF and her hubby had the Bento Box , a good amt of food for $14 each. It had a mix of salad, seaweed salad, sushi, and your 2 entrees. She had flank steak slices and gyoza.  He had tempura and teriyaki chicken.  They came with miso soup (salty good, carrots slices, tofu and 2 chunks of potato!).  We started off with the poke roll $6.95 with chopped poke in the center surrounded by rice and hamachi nigiri ($4.75 for 2) which was very tender but lacked the wonderful flavor that a good hamachi can have.  I ordered the shrimp (5 of them) and vegt tempura ($9.50) which came with rice.  It was very good with crispy batter and a slice of lotus root, broccoli, green beans, yam, carrot.  Tea was complimentary.  I would definitely consider coming back but it can get pricey for lunch, running well over $20 per person.

We enjoyed a bff girls night at the bar: I wanted absolutely everything off the board and tried not to order menu items.  We were in for a treat.  Shared a bottle of their unfiltered Alladin sake: sweet, but drier than Sho Chiku Bai, which I always have but I wanted some new flavor.  We had the following dishes: started with oyster shooters, then Kobe beef nigiri, we wanted seaweed, so definitely got the swamp roll, hamachi toro nigiri, a special roll with habanero mixed in for a total kick in the mouth, aji nigiri, another special roll with Kobe, unagi nigiri and a taste of Japanese pork skin, aka finished sashimi skin sliced into a ling strip and deep fried in light tempura batter, served with a few slices scallion and it was all insanely delicious.  One thing I noticed is the perfect cohesion of rice to fish on their nigiri.  Rice was perfectly seasoned: no textural issues, didn't fall apart, was good rice to fish ratio (i.e. Good balance) and the fish was excellent quality.  Falling apart from freshness, clean smelling and so texturally consistent.  The aji and Kobe roll were highlights.  Never had aji and it's resemblance to Saba is only skin deep.  Eric sliced the top of the skin in diagonal slices along the length of the fish and it was the meatiest, sweetest simplest offering that had the best bite of the night.

They also don't serve tea as the default anymore.\n\nThe waiters there made me very uncomfortable, since as soon as I finished something one of them would immediately grab the dish or bowl. They constantly hovered around but never said anything or asked how the meal was.

I pulled out my phone and Yelped sushi bars around where I was. This place has over 600 reviews, so it immediately captured my attention. So the decision was quickly made. I went in around 6 on a Friday night and it was only half full, which surprised me, but maybe the crowd comes later? Anyway I was immediately sat and supplied with water.\nI started looking over the menu, and of course a snack turned into more of a meal. I was looking at an order of the gyoza as well as a fresh cold roll and one deep fried. I was looking to try something different, and my waiter was very helpful with suggesting rolls to try. I ended up with a California roll with real king crab as well as another I can only explain, can't remember the name. \nThe Cali roll was perfectly crafted and the ingredients were delicious and paired wonderfully together. The other roll was a slice of green onion wrapped in raw salmon, wrapped in seaweed paper and deep friend in tempura, wrapped in rice, the orange roe balls, and soybean paper. Delicious! I can't stress how good this roll was. It was what the waiter recommended and I can't say I would have ordered it on my own. \nThe order of gyoza was one of the best I've ever had, and I've had many. The sauce had a nice kick, and the gyoza are made about an inch long and beautifully plated. Meanwhile, all the staff kept my water glass full (BIG factor in my eating experience, since I gulp water as I eat.)\n All in all, I spent about $22. And left so satisfied I would have paid twice that. They had a huge blackboard covered in specials, a diverse menu, fantastic staff, and a very cute, chic restaurant.

The first two rolls we had were fantastic.  Then we had some oysters, which were good, but nothing to write home about.  After paging through the menu one more time I saw the Louisiana Hotlink Roll.  Now the boyfriend is from Louisiana and loves everything associated with it, so we ordered it.  And let me tell you it was amazing.  It was hot in the middle and cool on the outside and absolutely delicious.  We also ordered some sort of sampler of different rolls, it was also ok.  \n\nOh we got a bowl of miso soup that was just ehh.

We used an app on his iphone, that told us to go to 9th Ave for which ever restaurant we had origionaly chose. Once on 9th Ave, we just grabbed a parking spot as soon as we found one and decided to walk.  Well,  there were 3 sushi restaurants all within steps of our car and one another.  How would we choose?

Not overly attentive, but they were there to answer any questions we had.\n\nI usually let my husband do the ordering when we go to Sushi so he went for it.  We started out with Miso Soup because it was chilly outside.  It was good.  The Tofu was very smooth and almost creamy.  It was different and good. \n\nThen we had the 2 Balls No Strikes.... well this turned out to be a home run for me.  While we did have to ask how to eat it (smash it up into small parts) the spice was great!\n\nThey sent out a very small portion of calamari for us.  WOW!  We had never been there before!  We felt special.  The calamari was VERY good in my opinion.  It had a little spice and flavoring in it!  I would totally order that next time.\n\nWe had 2 other rolls.  The Hot Link was eh, at best.  I heard my husband order it and thought it would be spicy.... the Hot in Hot Link, refers to the temperature.  Trust me, we ate it.  But I don't think I would order it again.

I was planning on meeting friends out in The Haight for the awesome drink special at Trax tonight, and I decided to meet up with my boyfriend when he got off of work and try out this new sushi spot.  I had read some really great reviews on Yelp, and a couple that worried me, but that comes with 300+ reviews.  \n\nBut what really hooked me was their website.  I visited it and their menu really impressed me.  The had a few roll combinations that sounded delicious, and I was intrigued by the idea of three different flavored edamame.  \n\nSome of the reviews had me concerned with how long our wait might be, since we were going on a Saturday @ 7.  But my boyfriend got there just moments before me and put our name in for 2, he said I wasnt there yet and that he was going to smoke a cigarette and the hostess said she would set up a table for him.  By the time I walked there and he took his last puff, our table was ready and we were seated right away.  I wouldn't say we had the best seats, allll the way in the back of the restaurant where the runners run in and out and semi-squished between the sushi bars patrons and a wall.  But none the less the lighting as good and it wasn't very loud, no need to shout, and out locations actually allowed us to get great service, so maybe it was a blessing in disguise.  Our waitress was very nice, friendly, and attentive.  She was continuously filling our water glasses and made sure to not overload our cups with just ice, very considerate.\n\nMy boyfriend has a not-so-secret obsession with crab cakes.  So when our waitress was spouting off the specials for the night I couldn't help but laugh at his facial expression as she told us about the 2 crab cakes the had for the appetizer specials.  It was 2 very large, very flavorful crab cakes for $7.50.  Not something I would normally get, but since it was date night with the hubs I decided ti splurg and do something nice for him.  And it was definitely a good choice.  They were so hot and moist and literally melted in your mouth.  They were a little rich, but I normally think that of crab dishes.  But they were both perfectly cooked and were a great treat.  We also ordered their trio of edamame.  One with normal sea salt, one with lemon garlic spice, and one with chili lime.  THEY WERE AMAZING!!!  Not only were they delicious but they gave me so many ideas of ways to flavor edamame in my own home.  I then ordered a Tokyo Tower roll (shrimp tempura), a Swamp Roll (spicy albacore with seaweed salad on top), and the Tootsie Roll with Halibut (deep fried halibut with green onions wrapped in yellow soy paper) and the boyfriend ordered the Chicken Teriyaki dinner.  \n\nI can honestly tell you that their Swamp Roll was hands down one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had in all of my sushi dining experiences.  Beautiful spicy albacore (we're talking a very generous portion of albacore) and perfectly seasoned seaweed salad on top.  I was very impressed and eager to try the other rolls I had ordered.  OUt next was our Tootsie Roll.  This was just ehhh, almost borderline bleeehhhh to be completely honest.  It was the smallest portion of fried halibut in the inside this roll.  And very thin sice of uncooked green onion.  I wasn't a fan of this, and was rather disappointed in fact since halibut is my favorite fish.  And then my boyfriend Chicken Teriyaki dinner came out.  There was a surprisingly large amount of chicken in his dinner.  With little potato chip thingys on the top. It was more Hawaiian BBQ than Chicken Teriyaki.  And the portion was rice served with it has half of what it should be.  And for $15 this dinner really should have come with more than a smll side of rice and miso soup.  Maybe a salad?  Or some veg tempura?  That would really make it worth it.  And sadly, there was no Tokyo Tower.  When we ordered our waitress couldn't find her little notebook pad so she didn't write anything down.  And, just my luck, she forgot my 3rd roll.  She said she would bring one out, but by the this time we had already finished all the food and were beginning to be full.  So we just asked for the check and went on our way.\n\nThere were some great flavors I tasted here.  Our service was great and the prices were relatively reasonable.  Overall I had a very pleasant experience and would recommend if you live in the neighborhood or are passing through.", "author": "Chelsea C."}

We ordered a lot of food and paid a hefty bill for it, but it was worth every dime.  I would totally do it again (as long as my wallet doesn't mind!)  Between the two of us, we ordered the Kobe beef sashimi, omakase, kaki fry and yosenabe.  The beef sashimi was so soft, fatty and beefy (sorry for lack of words to describe awesomeness).  The omakase is just the chef's choice of sashimi.  We got a great assortment of seafood and all for $25.  Bf ordered the kaki fry, which was fried oysters w/ potatoes.  Came with rice and miso soup.  The sauce for the oysters was really tasty...it was reminiscent of tonkatsu sauce.  I ordered the yosenabe (seafood in broth w/ yam noodles).  The broth was a little salty, but it doesn't matter - I still ate it all.  Came with two big pieces of fish, giant scallops, couple shrimp, clams, fish cake and mixed veggies.  I wish it had more noodles though (I'm a carb whore).  Our water was great, he deserved the giant tip.  He was knowledgeable of sake and was extremely attentive.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

I have been coming here for many many years and it had a bout of inconsistent fish so I stopped going...then a few years ago I had the most incredible meal there. It was like crack (not that I know what that is like) and I was on a high after the meal - fresh scallop, fresh uni, ama ebi, salmon, aji are my favorites. Then when they closed to remodel and Hotei was doing the sushi, I thought the sushi was horrible (fish was not fresh at all) - I went twice and decided not to come back until now (a gift card helped me decide). I like the new decor, though miss the tatami room - it's still packed in, but we managed to handle 2 kids during dinner. The hostess was exceptionally helpful accommodating the kids (Melissa?) - so thank you! \n\nThe food tonight was very good - sake, hirame, kampachi, uni (they were out of live uni :(, but this was really good - super cold), live scallop (still my favorite, though their tempura of the scraps was better as a nest than a patty with the 2 little piles of flavored \"sea salt\"), aji (not the best tonight), #29 roll, and i think there were some others. They've changed around their menu a little - like trying to be a bit more of a trendy sushi place (aka Nobu) and the chawanmushi tasted different and the ohitashi was pretty horrible - well, i should say, less traditional and overly salty (the custard not salty enough and what happened to all the goodies that used to be in there?).  If you like rolls, this is a good place (not a huge fan of rolls) and their selection of more adventurous fish is good. But not quite that ephemeral meal that I remembered (could be the juggling/eating with 2 kids ;)), but I still like it and would go back....bring your credit card, it easily runs $50pp without drinks.", "author": "Cammy H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-30", "description": "Generally I am very picky when it comes to sushi. After years of trying to many places, I had narrowed it down to Sushi House in Alameda as my favorite. Since my boyfriend lives in San Francisco and I work in the city, the trip to Alameda all the time was getting too much so we decided to venture out of our comfort zone and find a place a city that can live up to our standards. After several trial and error, we decided to give Ebisu a try since it was only a few blocks away from his house.\n\nEbisu is not some where you would want to go for a quiet dinner. The quaint little restaurant is always crowded and loud which was evidence that the food was good since so many people are there to eat! The decor of the restaurant is cute and you have the option of sitting at a table or at the sushi bar. Personally, I love sitting at the sushi bar since I generally only order sushi anyways.  The first two times we tried Ebisu, we sat at a table which can get a little annoying because the tables are very close to each other so if you're not a people person and claustrophobic, then take out might be your best bet. After those two times, we decided to sit at the bar. Sitting at the sushi bar does have it's perks! When you are seated, a waitress brings you a hot towel to clean your hands. The sushi chefs greet you immediately and serve you complimentary edamame (which is not given to you if you sit at a table). The selection of sushi is amazing! They have a wide variety of fresh fish and they even serve live Uni and live scallops! Personally, my boyfriend and I are fans of specialty rolls. Although they do not have a wide variety of specialty rolls, the ones they do carry are delicious and reasonably priced! Their Boston roll is only $6.95!! The sushi chefs are extremely nice and helpful. Ricky, who overheard my boyfriend say how he wished they had a roll with his favorite ingredients, immediately made a roll to his liking! He hasn't stopped talking about it since! Now every time we go back, we ask the chefs to make a customized roll for us depending on what we are craving. The waitresses are also extremely helpful and nice. My drinks never see the bottom of the cup because they refill it before it is even half empty! Great customer service!\n\nOne of the best things about Ebisu on top of their excellent customer service and delicious food is their rewards program. They offer a \"frequent eaters\" card that gives you 1 point for every dollar you spend (not including tax). When you hit 100 pts, you get 10% off. At 1000 pts, you get a gift card for $100! Once we heard about it, we signed up immediately and have been using it since! Great way to be rewarded for being a regular!\n\nI recommend Ebisu for sushi lovers who are in the sunset area and even if you're not, it's worth traveling to for a great meal!", "author": "Amie T."}

Service was fairly good, although the hot link roll did come out 15 minutes after everything else.  I really ought to give them 5 stars, but I have realized that my heart lies more with a larger number of cheaper rolls [so long as they don't poison me] rather than fewer higher quality ones so it just wouldn't normally beat out cheaper alternatives for my attention.

Decent sushi, though places like Kabuto (previous ownership, not the current) and Kyo-ya have eclipsed it for both sushi and non-sushi dishes. I normally don't eat rolls and consider then unauthentic, but I did have the swamp roll (spicy tuna inside-out roll and seasoned kelp). Sometimes you can get a seafood amuse-bouche from the 4 master sushi chefs. For sushi, I like the toro (my favorite), hamachi, uni, and amaebi. The kaki (oysters) with lemon and ginger are nice too. No reservations, so expect a long wait. Ebisu (historically written Yebisu) is the god of wealth and the deity of commerce, somewhat equivalent to Mercury/Hermes, known for his smiling face.

I've been there a few times both before and after I became obsessed with sushi and I have never been blown away by anything.  The fish is fresh but not much of anything interesting is done with it.  The service sucks but I no longer dock sushi places for this because it usually sucks.  The difference here is that the staff has been rude.  Slow and forgetful.  Ok, it happens.  Rude, not if you want my business.  The last time I was there was for a friend's birthday.  We put our name in and waited and waited.  When we were next, I noticed there were enough spots at the bar to accomodate us so I asked the hostess if we could sit there.  I wanted to confer with the birthday boy first just to make sure the bar was what he wanted (he usually sits at the bar but I thought he might want a table for his birthday).  I don't like to be the decision maker for other people's b-day festivities.  Anyway, she told me I had to let her know RIGHT NOW or she'd give away the spots.  I said he was right outside the door and it would take less than a minute to check.  Basically, the bitch wouldn't let me take 20 seconds to ask a question and come back to her.  Once we got seated, at a table since I didn't want to waste her precious time, the meal was ok.  It was unremarkable but ok.  \n\nThe one thing that really sealed the deal for me though was the distinct aroma of cat pee near our table.  As the mommy of 4 cats, I'm familiar with this smell.  No, a cat didn't pee on one of us before we came in.  It was in the carpet.  Few smells would make a sushi dinner worse, I say.

There was absolutely now parking around this block so be prepared to walk.  We were torn between the 3 Japanese restaurants right next to each other and randomly went into Ebisu.  One of the best decisions I've ever made.  This place has a really simple menu, however all their dishes are really good.  If you have a small party, go ahead and sit at the bar because everybody wants to sit at a table.  You will also get your rolls a lot faster sitting at the bar.  Our sushi chef was new and was getting yelled at by the \"veteran\" sushi chefs.  He still made every roll really good.  He then recommended a roll to us and wouldn't tell us what was in it.  We felt adventurous and tried the roll.  Lets just say I'll be back here again.", "author": "Danny P."}

If I had instead been the latter, I would have loved it: there is a magnificent array of rolls, and the interior is bustling with many happy customers.

And no, I'm not talking about bento boxes kind of \"sushi\".  This place probably wouldn't be the best place for that.  I'm talking about the sashimi and sushi in general.  I got the Double Hamachi roll and I just simply loved it.  I might be a little biased because I like yellow tail.  If you're eating here with a friend or what not, I would definitely recommend eating at the bar, its more lively and more fun.  The chefs are awesome to talk to and they recommend some bomb ass sushi.  They definitely provide great customer service.  Overall though, could get a little pricey but I guess its a pretty average price because I'm on a student salary.", "author": "Kenneth W."}

Ebisu even seemed to give the lowly CA roll some \"zest\" and dignity.  there ya go - new word to describe sushi: zesty!  go ahead and use it, if you want, royalty-free.  the sashimi combination was a good number of different types of sushi - and they don't just stick you with the sushi that no one will order straight off the menu.  they give you some good stuff and the combination is surprisingly cheap.  probably the most amazing thing was that the octopus wasn't as chewy as old bubble gum.  maybe that's what you need to do from now on to judge the quality of the sushi restaurant: order the octopus and see if you can manage to get the thing down in less than say 7 or 8 minutes of chewing and if you can't, then that's just not good!  i've had a lot of tough octopus and was relieved that ebisu's was not nearly the nightmare i remember having to choke down at other places.  \n\nthe service is always very reliable.  i like the tables where you have to sit on the floor - although i realize that it's not everyone's cup of tea. i suppose the only thing to watch out for is the wait but i know that already and i only come here on off hours when it's not really busy.", "author": "dan h."}

My husband and I both ordered Chirachi.  The Bento box was filled in two corners with a watery mushroom mess and the other two corners with kenpyo.  After I picked out five lettuce leaves that left little space for fish.  Sure enough they filled it with fake crab.  Whatever fish was in this dish it was slivers of tuna and a few other pieces.  I understand that there might not be perfect sushi slices but this is ridiculous.  What a sloppy job.  You simply don't care for your customers.  The two salmon skin handrolls we ordered additonally were pitiful.  They fell over after 30 seconds in their holder because the Nori was too soft and the salmon skins were cold and cold oil doesn't taste good.  We were the first customers for lunch and the rolls came out too quick.  Looked like they had them left over from the night before.  Outside the Saba sushi, nothing tasted fresh.  What a waste of our money.  We have eaten in other places with better quality and even lesser prices.  Will not return to this establishment.", "author": "Brigitte K."}

The newly remodeled interior is simple, but beautiful with wooden panels on one side, loosely echoing the organic style of a Frank Gehry. Loved the genuine, super-friendly wait staff (noticed how they make good eye contact). We pretty much loved everything our waiter suggested (he's so adorable as well as our water refiller guy)- the black cod is amazing - as well as the pork belly fat appetizer (i know, the latter doesn't sound very appetizing but it's good). However, one thing I'd probably not get again is the Louisiana sushi roll - which is a bit too \"fishy\" for me. This is a very popular sushi place - so expect to be told that there will be a long wait. Fortunately we were seated sooner than what we were informed - 30-60 minute estimated wait. There's definitely little room to manuever between the tables and chairs so either be agile or suck in your stomach if you're not waif thin when passing through (kidding). Again, and emphatically, the black cod is a good way to start the main course - with saki! :)", "author": "Audrey L."}

The best rolls were the rainbow and double hamachi.  The tootsie roll was probably one of the worst rolls I have ever eaten and the 49er roll was just ok.  We also ordered 2 Oyster Furamotos which were pretty good.  The king crab handroll was ok but the yellowtail handroll was much better.  I asked the sushi chef what Ankumi was and he told us it was monk fish liver.  Being a fatty  all food sounds delicious but this one kinda grossed me out.  Of course, right when I was thiknig of this he gave us 2 Ankumi for free.  He said it tastes like a potato but he was wrong.  When I was picking it up to eat it the lobes of the liver broke apart. So now I had the right lobe in my chop stick and the left lobe on my plate.  If you have taken anatomy before its time to throw up.  But luckily fat people like me dont throw up, but if I did I would my barf because I dont want to waste food.  The taste was actually not that bad.  If you have eaten crown prince smoked oysters in the tin can then you have eaten monk fish liver.    Stick with the yellowtail and skip the salmon.  Be daring and try some of their sushi bar specials like monk fish liver and maybe they will have monk fish balls next time.  For the amount of food we orderd I thought it  the bill would be atleast $60 but it only came out to $40 even.  The sushi chef was very nice and helpful and the bill was very reasonable.  This is why I give Ebisu 4 stars.", "author": "Fatty A."}

Japanese foods should not be \"busy\" and \"chaotic\"... it should be \"simple\" and \"well-balanced\"... well, maybe it was our fault for expecting Japanese food at \"non-Japanese-so-called-Japanese restaurant\"... It is such a shame b/c people go to Ebisu thinking it's a Japanese restaurant when it obviously is not... this is not true Japanese food... I KNOW Japanese food and this is NOT Japanese food... the food was so bad that it really p-ssed us off... we don't mind paying for GOOD food, but when food is so inedible, it really burns us... We will not be going back... It wasn't busy either... And Steve (owner) was even working in the back...\nmaybe the sushi might be \"okay\"... I mean, how can u mess up with sushi as long as the fish is fresh and of decent quality? I'm sure their sushi isn't like that of Yoshi's or Ozumo, though... just thinking about spending almost $30 for two for lunch at Ebisu STILL makes my blood boil!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2005-08-07", "description": "I have to agree with some of the other reviewers; I was rather disappointed by Ebisu. The selection of rolls didn't particularly interest me, nor was there anything on the nigiri list that stood out. The prices were not listed on the menu and in the end, it came out a bit on the expensive side. I will give them credit for some of the fastest sushi service I've ever seen. However, I think you can find better, cheaper sushi at other establishments in the city and not have to trek all the way out to the Sunset to do so.", "author": "Elise U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-09-03", "description": "I was disappointed by my last visit, but all of the other visits have been fine.  The sushi is good for the most part, although it can be prepared rather quickly and thus the presentation is not the greatest.  If you sit at the sushi bar, you were be a bit squished in for space.  There are too many rolls that have spicy things in it or unagi.  A bit more variety would be great.", "author": "Brian L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-02-25", "description": "Be prepared to wait a long time, but well worth it.  In my very humble opinion the best sushi in San Fran.  Well worth the $10 taxi ride.  If you want trendy and loud, go to that hell-hole on Lombard or Ozumo, but if you want great sushi at a reasonable price - this is the place.  Afterward a stop at Yancy's around the corner for a quick game of darts and a beer is customary for us, though it's not quite as fun anymore.", "author": "Matt A."}

I usually eat at the sushi bar and haven't been disappointed.  Name the roll, they'll make it.  You can even create your own sushi perfection.  My only qualm on this place is that if you sit at the sushi bar, you never know how much they charge your for each sushi, the final bill just has the total.  One of my favorites.", "author": "Alex K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-02", "description": "Ebisu is hands down the best sushi joint I've ever been to. I love sushi, consider myself a connoisseur and have been to tons of sushi restaurants in and out of San Francisco. The most obvious factor is the superior quality of the raw fish. All the other ingredients are incredibly fresh as well--so much so that they melt in your mouth. The sushi rice is perfection as well--can't stand it when the rice isn't right. My favorite is the Cherry Blossom roll. They also have live Uni (sea urchin) sitting on a platter that will move when the chef pokes it, which was pretty interesting. In short, Ebisu has essentially ruined me for other sushi restaurants. Nothing else seems to compare. The prices are reasonable for what you're getting; portions are reasonable as well (8-10 pieces per order) Some items seem priced slightly above average, but it's so worth it. It can get pretty crowded around 7--if you get there early certain weekdays there are specials! FIVE STARS!", "author": "Melissa D."}

Been Ebisu diners for over 10 years...Sorry Ebisu, our recent experience was very dissappointing to say the least. We found the portions to be much smaller and the final dinner cost very pricey. Your restaurant could not accommodate odd tables for (3) diners within a reasonable wait time and we were not told of this. Was told the wait would be half to one hr. Waited 1 hr. 15 min and still couldn't get seated until I suggested to take the next table for 2 and add a chair although all even parties (2) got seated who came after us. This more than exceeded our expected wait time..Portion size e.g. 8 pc Himachi sashimi sliced at 1/4\" (a little skimpy!) priced at $16 is typical of other menu portions and pricing. The specialty eel roll barely had enough eel for taste...as my friend puts it, each pc in the roll was like the \"end\" pc. Sorry Ebisu, nice remodeling job, but there are other Japanese restaurants who can deliver better value ...very dissappointing.", "author": "alice n."}
