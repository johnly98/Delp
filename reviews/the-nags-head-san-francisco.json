{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-03-23", "description": "This review is solely for the rude bartender named Cat and the owner who didn't do anything about her. To start off, there's nothing special about this bar. Bf used to come here often for about 2 years because few of his friends used to work here, but ever since they quit, there was no reason to.\n\nHowever, we stopped by on St. Patty's with some friends to grab few drinks since we were on the block, and there were 2 bartenders working. One of them was a girl named Cat and the other one was a dude. My friends and I stood there in front of the bar top for about good 20 mins, but none of the bartenders noticed because they were both super drunk. The girl bartender was doing nothing but just scrambling some random papers, and walking back and forth. The guy was too busy taking shots with few girls, that he didn't bother to acknowledge other customers. Mind you, I don't care that they drink, or that they're drunk as long as they acknowledge customers presence, and provide good customer service.\n\nAfter 20 mins, we were finally able to flag the girl down and order. She took our drinks order and instead of making the drinks right away...she turned around and started scrambling MORE papers, and walking back and forth from one end to the other with an empty cup in her hand, doing nothing. So I nicely said, \"hey girl, I know you're drunk, but we've been waiting for a while\" and  she rudely looked at all of us, and said \"WHAT. YOU WANTED JAMESON RIGHT? SORRY FOR YOUR INCONVENIENCE LET ME POUR IT ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP\". \n\nAt that point, we were so dumbfounded, even the customers around us were shocked. What shocked us more was that when we tried to talk to the owner Michelle about it, she didn't bother to care and said \"oh so she felt sorry! She gave you guys double shots!\" We were so speechless... No wonder the bartender is so rude to customers. My guess is that the owner feels that she can't lose any bartenders.\n\nOne last thing that pissed me off was... before we were about to leave, I was waiting in line for the bathroom. I was next in line, and when the guy came out of the bathroom, the rude bartender Cat pushed me and yelled \"wait wait wait!\" and walked into the bathroom.....\n\nOh man, my blood is boiling thinking about what happened. We will never come back here again.", "author": "Elaine C."}

The bartender said of course and was very welcoming. Being a puppy our dog does bark when strangers come too close. We had treats on the ready and let people give our pup some to help him stay calm. This always works, but he does bark a few times until he's comfortable. \n\nUnfortunately there was a shift change and the new bartender immediately told us we needed to leave as there are other customers. No complaints from anyone, the only times our dog barked was when others approached and stayed near him to pet. Everyone liked the dog and was understanding, except for this bartender. We asked if we could at least finish our drinks, but a minute later asked us to leave again. We quickly finished up and left as we felt very uncomfortable. \n\nI understand bars not allowing dogs, but there should be consistency. This has the potential to be a good dive bar, and no reason to not allow dogs as there is no food served. Unfortunately there are some rude staff which ruin the atmosphere.", "author": "Ryan F."}

My kind of place.\n\nSo I went and while the bar did not live up to my absurd vision, good times were had. Came with fairly sized party which I woudln't suggest for this particular hot spot. Nag's isn't a large, in fact it is tiny. When there were 30-40 people inside I felt like I was in a mosh pit. They have a bunch of stools and 3-4 mini tables but chances are you'll be standing around. Doesn't take away from the merriness though.\n\nDrinks are dirt cheap and without any dirt. Think 3-4 dollar beers, 6-7 dollar shots? They do have a funky list of house drinks they make. I wouldn't be surprised if they just took old recipes and made new names but hey more power to creativity. Plenty of bartenders so ordering and getting drinks is so easy a caveman could do it.\n\nThey also got a magnetic dart board and some red mugs with 5 dice each. Very handy to start up your own drinking games or an excuse to just yell at something.\n\nThere is also a squirrely bartender named Elaine aka. Lil Cheezy, not to be confused with Elaine Benes. You should say, as my good broheim says to her, \"WaDDDuuP,\" and enjoy her timeless reaction. The real star of this place is the owner. Very warm, motherly and for reasons, on one faithful night, not to be discussed a true life saver.

I can't give it more since this place is literally about as wide as the bar itself and like many of the bars in the area doesn't need a reason to stand out. The prices are average (5 dollars for draft beer, 3.75 for well mix drinks) and there is always some random movie playing on the television and music provided by the bartenders I-pod. This can be a good or a bad thing depending on whose music is playing. (Last night was great with a bunch of mid-90's rap making me nostalgic for my junior high days.) \n\nThe bartenders here are all really friendly and must pour stiff drinks because I always seem to stagger out of the place asking myself how the hell I got that drunk. \n\nEvery time I come here something crazy seems to go on. A man tackled by the cops and arrested out front, a fist fight that broke out between two \"best friends\" on the sidewalk, a crazy lady with no teeth telling me that she has the power to talk to horses, and a random man passed out at the bar. \n\nThese are the reasons I keep coming back.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-03-13", "description": "An establishment diminutive in size but big in heart, The Nag's Head has the smallest square-footage any of bar on the Geary street corridor.  Rectangular in shape, and much longer than wide, it makes due with a well thought out and space-efficient design, starting with a bar that runs the entire length of the room.  A dart area doubles as table seating, with tables folding down on hinges to make room if a game starts up.  A mirror in back of the bar is plastered with drink specials, and a 365-day-per-year Christmas garland full of lights graces the top of the bar. \r\n\r\nThe crowd here is an older one, but the amongst the friendliest and most talkative I've seen in the city.  The bartenders name was Miles, a genuinely polite old-guard barkeep that could keep up with his pouring while exchanging idle banter with his clients, occasionally swapping jokes and joining them in a booming chorus laughter at the conclusion of each one.  Despite his humble appearance, Miles is a rare breed....he's an individual that seems content with his lot, and truly *likes* what he does for a living.  Unlike a lot of neighborhood pubs, the social scene here has a very interesting dynamic about it....particularly  how easy it is to enter and exit conversations on a moments notice.  There's no listen, plan, wait for an opportunity to jump in.  Just say something that pertains to the conversation, and people treat you like you've been a contributor for the last several hours.  Back off, and and people tune you out after a  mental egg-timer in their head runs out.  There were no sorrowful faces gazing catatonically into space while plying their sorrows with liquor.  To the contrary, topics of conversation seemed to spring from a bottomless well, with every person in the place  engaged in mile-a-minute chitchat.\r\n\r\nAn odd shaped window that looks out on Geary street lets in a small amount of natural light during the daytime....well placed incandescent lighting takes up the slack towards the rear.  The sight of a crock pot with plates on a small table near the jukebox suggested complimentary grub might be on hand....but a peeking inside of it revealed naught but a few bits of dried out potatoes, a scant remainder of some kind of stew that had long since been devoured by early-bird patrons.\r\n\r\nThough you won't find the young and the beautiful atop the barstools at the Nag's Head, you will find the rich of soul and the kind of heart.  The music is old school and not too loud, and the pick-up scene is all but non-existent.  But the Nag's Head is rich in soul.... a rare thing in this city, where the four horsemen of the economic apocalypse have a tendency to run roughshod over the traditions of the old guard. In a fast changing world, the Nag's Head is a pleasant reassurance that indeed.....some things never change.", "author": "Mike W."}

The crowd wasn't offensive or rude but they kept to themselves like young kids do but I guess I didn't care because I had all the entertainment I needed...\n\nMy friends are idiots.  When confronted with a huge list of specialty shots located behind the bar we decided that we should play a game we deemed \"pick the weirdest shot for your friend\".

If you are into obscure shots and want to get drunk (or date raped) you should get a 'stop light'.

The bar itself is long and narrow with not much room to move around. I came here around 9 pm on a Saturday and it filled up by 12 am, when I went home. \n\nI plan on coming here again, as it is a very chill and comfortable place to knock back a couple drinks.

This place is small and the older crowd holds court from about 3pm until at least 6 or 7.  What I did love is the generocity of the folks there, I think I only paid for one round and still enjoyed 6 or so drinks.  They have an interesting drink menu with things I've never heard of like a Red Headed Bitch.  I stuck to the basics of bacardi and coke.  When someone buys a round you are givin a token making me think I was at Chucky Cheese or something.  This is a place that's great as long as the company is great.

Stumble out of the bathroom and gets yelled at by the owner because you just pissed in the kitchen, take down a few more shots, start making out with someone inside the bathroom/kitchen. Take a few more beers before you hit the road, drive trying not to hit anything and wondering why there are a pack of ninjas chasing after you.(i don't recommend anyone drive while intoxicated, or having illusions about ninja assassins) Get to the door, have trouble getting the key into the keyhole, stumble upstairs, sit in your chair and................it's 7am and it's time to fill our your report for your manager.\n\nThis place has all the hot ladies, well some hotter then others......damn that's just wrong.

As for me, I'll just say that Nag's Head is a superset of what you get next door at McKenzie's--twice the ambiance, and twice the number of eclectic/eccentric regulars who are twice as outgoing (Cassandra has earned a place on my list of saltiest and sassiest bar matrons, that's for sure--and she's not even the owner!). Oh yeah, and 2 cute Asian bartenders instead of just one.  Although, to be honest, I can't remember which place has more bizarre cocktail/shooter names taped to the bar mirror (Sweet Booger, anyone?).  Maybe I was just here on a more happening night, but hey, first impressions are what they are.  At any rate, as my 6th (and seemingly final) bar in the Outer Richmond, I have to say I'm envious of the overall neighborly vibes--it's what the WP bars ought to aspire to.  There's really only one problem, which is that their geographical spread is very inconvenient for a proper pub crawl.

They are very open to new people and sometimes make food to share with anybody who is there! Great bar, pretty low key, and you can strike up some interesting conversation with some nice people that have been going there for years. (But don't start trouble, or you'll have to go down the way to gross Mckenzies, and nobody wants to do that!) Fast service, good prices, and a wide variety of strong mixed drinks. The style is eclectic, comfortable, and warm. Every time I've been there, they will have food shows on the tv at one end of the bar, and sports or news down at the other end, but they are willing to change the channel if requested. Make sure to bring some cash or swing by the Bank of America on the corner, because it is cash only. If you're ever in the area and want to whet your whistle, make sure to stop by the Nags.

Saw The Nags Head and thought \"perfect.\"  There was a handful of middle age to older guys sitting at the bar getting their drink on.  There was a spread of food in the back on the table since it was the 4th.  Swedish meatballs, chicken wings, veggie platter, salami and crackers.  The bartender was great.  He chatted it up with everyone in the place and was very attentive.  The whole vibe of the place was perfect.  The owner came in told us to make sure we got some food.  I had died and gone to bar heaven.  This place is great.  We stayed for about three hours and then the night shift bartenders came in and the vibe was not nearly as good.

The D\u00e9cor is what you would expect year round Christmas decorations, the plethora of bar mirrors to make it look bigger and on the counter opposite the bar, rows of paperback books. Interesting.  The bar back mirrors are covered with a m\u00e9lange of brightly colored pieces of paper all with different popular cocktails and the price.  I saw the standard Irish Car bombs to Flaming Dr Peppers and other strange concoctions with red bull and Jaeger it gives me the heeby jeebies thinking about it. Our bartender was a small Asian lady who was hysterical attempting to fix whatever was broken behind the bar while darting outside to smoke and argue with the regulars.  The day regulars are all older, very friendly and will buy you a drink if you listen to their story, although I think they only bought the drinks because a pretty lady accompanied yours truly. Haha.
