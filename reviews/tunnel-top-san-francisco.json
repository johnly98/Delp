It is near bars and restaurants so it's very good as a pregame or after dinner spot.\n\nGo early evening to avoid the crowds, and well, for HH pricing specials.

Since Tunnel Top was on the way, we decided to stop by for one drink. My friend and I walked in on Friday, July 14th around 6:30pm. It wasn't super busy, so we were able to find two seats on the left side of the bar.\n\nHappy Hour: until 7:30pm\n*Barrel Aged Manhattan: woodford reserve, carpano antica, angostura bitters ($8)\n*Tunnel Top Old Fashioned: bulleit bourbon, bitters, cherries ($8)\n\nDrinks are originally $10, but lucky for us, we went during HH, so we got $2 off each cocktail. I enjoyed the manhattan. It was made well and I like woodford reserve. My friend seemed to enjoy his old fashioned as well. I like bulleit, so I'm sure I would have enjoyed it too if I tried some. Our bartender was great. Very friendly. We never had to flag him down to get his attention. One thing that did bother me while here was the cleanliness of their glasses.

I recommend the watermelon gimlet and the spicy mango margarita! They have an upstairs area, where you can enjoy your drink and dance to cool music from the DJ.

So a few of my other colleagues and I walked over here after dinner on a Tuesday night. I didn't expect it to be busy, but there were a good amount of people hanging around the bar. \n\nAfter ordering drinks (vodka cran for myself), we made our way upstairs and found a lounge-like seating area - open area, comfy chairs, and tables in between. We sat in the corner and didn't really move from that spot for the next hour or so. The loft area seemed like the smart place to go because you get a good view of the outside world and the inside world. Makes for a great people-watching spot. \n\nThe bar itself is laid-back and casual, perfect if you just want to casually hang and have a few drinks with some friends. Right when we were about to leave a DJ started setting up shop. For the few songs we stayed for, it seemed like he was going for a more upbeat dancing vibe, which I could see happening here on the weekends. \n\nI'll definitely try to come back when I'm in SF next.

He was originally playing at a different venue, and I had coordinated 10-15 people to watch him in action, but he got a last minute gig here... So we migrated the group there accordingly. The bar itself is alright. Just your standard divey, somewhat trendy bar. Bringing in deejays like Hector is just what they need to liven up the atmosphere.\n\nHector was perched upstairs in a small corner overlooking the bar, with a narrow catwalk and many two-seating tables along the way. It was a little awkward constantly trying to squeeze by when four or five people were crammed around a tiny table, but after a few drinks, this errs on the side of cozy. There are larger lounge spots to hang out upstairs, but these tend to be claimed first.\n\nI wouldn't come here until a deejay like Hector was playing again. He mixes some awesome hip hop and throwback beats, and you can tell that the bar patrons enjoy the vibe he creates.

The bartenders at Tunnel Top offer generous pours from a decent selection, and the bar-and-balcony combination creates the perfect ambiance. This is an ideal venue for small-groups, as the half-tables along the walls offer the perfect spots to lean in for good conversation amidst the buzz of the bar.

It's not fancy, yet I wouldn't say it's a dive either. Just a bar with good drinks and casual ambiance. \n\nPeople rave about their cucumber basil drink, but the one time I ordered it years ago it tasted like Italian dinner. Too much basil I think? Or maybe someone grabbed oregano instead of basil? Stick with the classics here, like a Cosmo or a beer and you'll be safe ;)\n\nLike many SF bars, it gets crowded fast. Go upstairs if you can and watch everything unfold from the loft. Probably one of the coolest things about Tunnel Top is the upstairs area. A very unique experience.\n\nCrowd skews on the younger side. Pretty attractive folks, so if you're single this would be a good place to take your Tindering offline. \n\nOverall, a pretty cool bar.

So tiny, in fact, that you might be afraid that one too many people packed inside might cause Tunnel Top to teeter off its precarious perch above the Stockton St tunnel entrance.\n\nDespite the small size, the vibe is amazing.  There are two levels, with a main bar on the first and a wrap-around balcony on the second.  In the middle of it all is a giant chandelier made of old beer bottles.  Somehow Tunnel Top makes it all come together.\n\nEven on a Tuesday evening in the middle of winter, Tunnel Top was mobbed.  And I mean totally shoulder-to-shoulder mobbed.  There was absolutely nowhere to breathe, let alone sit back and relax.  (Do San Franciscans *ever* have to work the next day?!)\n\nOf course, once I saw the dirt-cheap happy hour prices, I knew why it was so busy.  Treating myself to a gin-and-soda followed by a glass of their house white wine was a no-brainer.  (FYI -- cash only.)  Drinks were strong and tasty.\n\nAll in all, Tunnel Top is a awesome bar.

Sweet tunes were spinning thanks to G for a few hours, and the sweet old school and new school jams were appreciated by all, as there were lots of head bobbing and booty shaking. I was entertained not only by the slide show of random pics of places, people, and things on the wall next to the stairs, but also the people watching down below.\n\nTT has many cocktails to choose from, and specialty drinks like the mojito-- so check the menu behind the bar. And HO, they have wine and beer, and you guessed it, HOegaarden on draft! Woot! \n\nSince it's a pretty small bar, it tends to get crowded, so I'd check out TT for HH after work, or go early on Friday and Saturday evenings.

The bartender seemed annoyed when we ordered drinks from the cocktail menu. One cocktail with fresh watermelon was okay, kinda weird after taste. The other cocktail was coconut-y and just way too milky and plain. Seriously looked like a glass of milk in a tumbler. Very minimal effort; a cherry or really anything would have made it much more appealing. We drank half of our drinks, then called it a night. The layout of the place is cool with a DJ upstairs, so I'd maybe try it again, probably more around happy hour than later in the night.", "author": "MaryKate M."}

After some careful considerations through a lengthy Yelp search, I decided to pick the closest bar possible. So I walked up this hill -- this hill with a tunnel on top of it -- to the Tunnel Top bar.\n\nOn a Tuesday night, it wasn't busy. I grabbed a bar stool and stared at the fresh fruit and herbs ready to be infused into the bar's specialty cocktails. I ordered an IPA, although I think I meant to order the cucumber vodka and basil martini. Ah well.\n\nA few fellow drinkers murmured amongst themselves nearby as a New Zealander chatted me up, eventually convincing me to swap seats so he could talk to a pretty young lass. A little creepy, perhaps, but you got to give the guy credit for trying to get a little action.\n\nBut yeah, the place is divey and dark. Relaxing and unpretentious. And they played Rappin' Rodney Dangerfield on the jukebox, which is honestly the one and only vinyl I've purposely smashed to pieces. Made me smile.", "author": "Will S."}

A dog greeting maybe it's a San Francisco thing because I have never been welcomed by a dog in any local bar. The lighting was a show stopper you could say it's very ornate it was a bird cage chandelier that had light bulbs exposed off the bottom of he cage. Bartender was a cool guy to chat with he had been an employee of this bar for over 10+ years and he mentioned being a patron before actually working here so I'm guessing he has to love it there. He was one man taking the role of multiple people jobs; he was the only person running this bar he served us drinks cleaned up after those who left and everything else he was the sole operator and everything else this night. I don't even remember what we ordered since it was kinda divy we got some domestic beers and stayed for awhile it was early so we had hours before anything seemed to get crackin.

Although labeled as a dive bar, it really doesn't have that feel to it. Downstairs, it's more like a modern prohibition-style extreme mixology bar. Upstairs, it's a small hip-hop club. Fascinating combo that actually makes for an awesome night.\n\nDrinks here are incredible. They use a variety of fresh fruits and herbs to make some of the best tasting and healthy cocktails in the game. Watermelon gimlet, berry mojito and a decent selection of beers on tap. Prices are manageable as well. \n\nUpstairs, there's two lounge areas, some chairs, and tables in the back. The small bypass between the lounge area and tables makes it tough to get through on a crowded night. Be sure to come early and snag some lounge space, or else you'll end up on their tiny dance floor. Speaking of dance floor, ladies beware. The world is full of perverts and if you're leaning by the upstairs railing, someone on the bottom floor will have easy access to take a peak. \n\nMusic is typically top 40 hip hop with some old school mixed in; DJ is always killing it.  No cover is always good. Bathrooms are large but have no stalls, so lines almost always appear. With such a small venue, it gets packed quickly. \n\nThe cage hanging from the ceiling adds a nice touch too...", "author": "Dmitriy S."}

Luckily a large group was just leaving.  In a medium sized room, there are more places for standing than sitting.  But the bar counter was readily available with a single bartender to take care of us.  \n\nThe selection is quite nice, with a handful of beers on tap (see pic) and several chalkboards with hand-written special drinks for you to try (I had the Dark and Stormy with rum and ginger beer, quite tasty!).  \n\nI didn't catch his name, but somehow through the night, I struck up a conversation with the bartender about a recent new bourbon whisky produced in NY.  I read about Hudson Whisky in a recent article in Forbes Life as something to try.  Looks like curiosity got the best of his so he brought down the bottle to try, handing me a half-shot as well.  Thanks!\n\nLive DJ was spinning some funky tunes as well that went along the lines that theme from Austin Powers mixed in with some Dinah Washington.  Don't know, don't ask, it worked.  You don't have to ask me if I'll come back because the answer is yes.\n\nLastly, I would probably take off half a star because payment is cash only.  This place didn't strike me as low funded or low key.

In any case, one thing is clear: you will not forget what happens here.

I had heard about TT for a while now from friends, but I had never gone in until we dropped in for our high school friend's farewell party.  I must say...he picked a pretty good venue to say goodbye to everyone.\n\nThe place is pretty small, but the lower level is an especially tight fit.  After you walk in, it's just a few short steps until you're already in line at the bar.  They managed to squeeze in a table or two, but there really isn't much space for anything else.  Each time we would get our drinks, we would head straight back upstairs to the couches the rest of the group had claimed.  It felt quite a bit more spacious up there, but it's mostly because it was so busy down below.\n\nSpace aside, the rest of Tunnel Top is awesome.  The DJ was playing mostly mostly hip-hop and top-40 and though there wasn't anyone dancing or anything, I'm sure there might have been if there was room for it.  As for the bartenders, I was impressed by how fast they were able to get drinks out even though there was only two of them working.  Fast, well made drinks that were pretty cheap as well?  Win.  Just make sure you come prepared though, as the bar is CASH ONLY (they have an ATM out front if you need it).\n\nAlthough parking in the area can be tough, the Stockton/Sutter garage is right next door.  Though it may suck having to pay for parking, it's convenient and the hourly rate is pretty cheap.  Since drinks at the bar won't cost much anyways, it'll all even itself out by the end of the night.

It is kind of out of the way if you aren't going for dinner at Bouche or exploring Stockton for some reason. It is a nice if unremarkable dive bar if you are looking for decently priced drinks and being squeezed in with strangers.\n\nInside of tunnel top there is one main bar to your left when you enter. There will be a max of two people serving drinks so prepare for a little wait. The place has a great selection of cocktails with some combinations I have actually never seen before. There were a lot of fruit infused drinks with watermelon and other fresh fruits that are a nice change of pace from the fifty step drinks you get at other places. The only problem though was that the bartender made these drinks in two steps. I think it might take a little more than that but yes thank you for taking a chunk of watermelon. Mashing it in a glass and pouring vodka over it. This is definitely something if not the thing I was expecting.\n\nBesides the odd drink The bathrooms are located terribly right near the bar so expect the line for the bathroom to crash into the line for the bar and play a fun game of what am I waiting for and why am I surrounded by so many people. If you can get away make your way upstairs. There isn't much room to be had up here either when things get late into the night and more crowded but it is nice to look out over the entire place while holding your drink for dear life. There is actually a lot of seating upstairs and you can bring a group of friends and have a good time. Check to make sure it isn't taken up by a party or anything though.\n\n Later in the night a DJ begins to play a mix of tunes that range from electronic to progressive. It really is eclectic and fits the vibe of the whole place in general. There are weird images being displayed on the walls and really you shouldn't expect anything different from a dive bar in San Francisco.\n\nIt's a decently good time but nothing to go out of your way for. If you are in the area check it out and have a drink with friends otherwise there are much better places to check out a little further in the area.", "author": "Nick R."}

Plus, you've got the option of being able to hang out upstairs or downstairs, in case you're in the mood for a scenery change at any point during your time here. Convenient.\n\nBut I'm docking two whole stars for the MASSIVE HEADACHE incurred here. The music was beyond too loud. It was inescapable. I blame the fact that it was a Saturday night, and blaring music seems to be the requirement at any late-night establishment, regardless of the presence of a dance floor. Whatever.

I wanted to go upstairs so I begged someone to buy me a drink (and by beg I mean I batted my eyelashes and asked in a sweet, soft voice) and left to the top. It was standing room for a moment, and then a large group next to ours left and guess who snagged it! Woooo!!! We had a place to put our stuff AND set our beers down to dance! Oh--here it comes--the reason why I gave this place five stars.\n\nTheir DJ was OFF THE HOOK. I've heard a crapload of DJ's in my short lifetime, and by far he is the best one I have ever encountered. There was this unbelievable transitioning between songs that only the master himself could do--from the stones to snoop then back to some 90's rock band--VERY hard thing to do. But he pulled it off beautifully, which is good because Drunk Jaime likes to dance. Alot. So does, apparently, Drunk Chris and Drunk Matt H's friend, which was also good because next-morning-sober-Jaime remembers the night before and would feel embarrassed if she was alone. By the end of the night, the DJ played \"Jump Around\" (or whatever the name of it is), and quite literally--we jumped. I'm surprised they didn't kick us out from all that damn noise, but hey! There was just so much fun to be had!\n\nWhen a few of us decided to leave, one random person not from our group pulled Chris aside and said \"You guy's can't leave--you're the life of the party!\"\n\nAnd Tunnel Top let us be that.

It was quite the adventure to find this place too since we didn't really know where we were going.

Easy, right?\n\nAnyway, I was so glad when we got here because there was a decent crowd inside with some good music playing from the DJ and a nice sitting area on the second floor (which is also a dance floor, but no one dancing).\n\nI got the watermelon gimlet - fresh watermelon mashed with some freshly-squeeze lemon and gin. Flavor was GREAT, but there were chunks of watermelon that were just too large and should've been strained out. But, it was only $6 for that cocktail, so it's not too bad. \n\nMy friends and I sat upstairs by the balcony where we could oversee the entire downstairs crowd.

After suffering through hours of shopping last night among hoards looking for last minute gifts, I ascended the Stockton tunnel steps in an attempt to escape the madness and find a decent drink to put me back in the holiday spirit.  I would have walked right by this place if it hadn't been for Yelp.  From the outside, a smashed, poorly lit, unreadable sign was the only evidence of its existence as even the windows are covered with blinds, creating a disguise from the Union Square weekend revelers in search of the glitzy nightclub or trendy bar.\n\nI was fully expecting a dive bar atmosphere, but was met instead with a softly lit, refined ambience that had the feel of a cozy lounge than a gritty dive bar.  Live music filled the air from upstairs and the crowd had a very local, neighborhood vibe despite being near SF's tourist and shopping ground zero. No cover charge. No pretention.  Some were there to listen to the music, others were there to relax, others there to imbibe and socialize.  It's one of those bars that pulls off being something to everyone.\n\nThe best part, however, were the excellent speciality cocktails at very reasonable prices.  $7 for a Martini in SF near Union Square?  On top of that, the beer selection was one of the most eclectic I've seen in SF as it heavily leaned toward Belgian craft brews and styles.  The toughest part of the experience here was deciding between a pint of Belgian beer and a unique house cocktail.  Oh well, I guess I'll have to return again soon.", "author": "Mike B."}

They had some old school movies playing on the wall. Not exactly the most uplifting type of atmosphere, but it really works! I immediately noticed they had a dark and stormy drink special, which is awesome because it's one of my fave drinks that they don't have at every bar I go to. My night was complete. We took a trip upstairs and there was a some room to dance and couches to chill on as well. Totally awesome.

I woke up the next morning to find corn nuts in my hair and an empty hostess cupcake wrapper under my pillow. Our garbage can and an array of artificial sweeteners were in our shower and the ibuprofen was spilled all over the nightstand.

I never would have come in here on my own. \n\nI was grouped up with a girl I met on the crawl and we came in here together. We walked in and the first thing we saw was a spiky blond haired dude wearing a super tight T-shirt that he probably bought at baby gap so he could show off the \"gun show\". I turned my companion and said, \"this place seems kind of date rapey\" and she laughed. \n\nWe went in a little further and noticed they had one of those big boards of custom cocktails but they were reasonably priced, $6 instead of the usual $9-$11. An idea went off like a skyrocket in my head! I love green apple flavor and I'd wanted to try an Appletini for years. I rarely go to the kind of bar where they'd make one of those and wouldn't ever order something like that while out with my friends because they'd razz the hell out of me.\n\nI ordered my Appletini and the bartender said \"what?\" I repeated my order and he made it for me but before he gave it to me he asked, \"Is that it?\" as if surely I wanted a beer and that girly drink was for someone else. As far as I can tell an Appletini is just vodka and apple pucker, it was alright, I'd just order it on rocks in the future to get it in a regular glass if I had the urge to try it again. The girl I was hanging out with thought the whole thing was hilarious, from me being insecure about ordering the drink to the bartender's reaction.\n\nWe noticed that people upstairs were dancing and the girl I was with wanted to check it out. I told her that I wasn't nearly drunk enough to dance but I probably could muster one of those 80's white boy dances, I showed her and she laughed some more. We went up the stairs and saw a group of the most rhythmically challenged people dancing away without a care to Reggaeton.

This was my morning.  \n\nArriving at 6:15 ish was key for last night.  We had a big group of co-workers arriving and needed the space.  We landed one of the two large benched areas upstairs which made for cozy sitting, close talking and rumors starting.  Apparently I am now making out with a co-worker.  Not that i don't love him to pieces, but a) he is not my type, and b) we were close talking cuz we were talking shit, and we didn't want the other co-workers to hear.  Oh the irony.\n\nThere is a pretty sweet upstairs that circles the whole bar, with bartops and stools lining the perimeter, and the one side with the large group seating.  I didn't take advantage of the ability to smoke upstairs till the majority of my work party left, but that was probably because i had a few more cocktails in me as well.  I started off with a pomegranate cosmo. After deciding that the fancy cocktail price of $6 was too steep at a bar like this, I stuck with my Vodka soda splash of cranberry, which were more in my price range and the less $$ spent per drink meant more drinks for me!\n\nI had a good time, got to pee in a relatively clean mens room (they are single room bathrooms), and am now the lucky lady friend of a co-worker.

When I first moved to Nob Hill, I didn't even know this place was a bar.  It just looked like a shitty old building from the outside.  It wasn't until I heard music blaring one night that I figured out it was a bar.  Since then, I've stopped by for both happy hour and late night bar-hopping... and I'm just not sold on it, which saddens me because I would love to have a great neighborhood dive bar one block from my apartment.  I think the thing I dislike most about Tunnel Top is that each time I've ordered a cocktail off the menu, they're always out of the ingredients.  So, I end up getting beer, which isn't a bad thing because they stock Chimay and Hoegaarden. \n\nThe atmosphere is pretty chill, and at night they light tons of candles on the stairs and tables.  The bottom floor has the bar and bathrooms while the upstairs mezzanine has a few tables for sitting and chatting (if you can hear over the music).  It gets pretty stuffy on both levels at night.  Hanging from the ceiling is a massive chandelier made of beer bottles.  There isn't really one \"type\" of person that hangs out here, so you get a decent mix of people, which also varies depending on the night.\n\nI guess it's decent overall.

You're there an hour, then 2, then more and you realize that he just doesn't quit. Every single song is a great one. Every single beat gives you no choice but to just move. You just haven't done the TT until you've been on a Wednesday or Saturday night, foot tappin' to DJ Tin One.\n\nThe whole formula here is just right. The cash-only bar is roomy. People are actually comfortably seated at the bar and like - actually talking to each other. The friendly bartenders mix up my Fresh Watermelon Gimlet good and fast.

But overall, I enjoyed this layout.  For the busier patrons downstairs, the bar was a good place to mingle and get smashed right into the guy next to you for an appropriate introduction.  Upstairs was for groups of friends/couples to concentrate on their special moments of social exchanges and verbal interaction.  The creep guy at the railing kept on looking back at us and perhaps it was the larger expanse of the white of his eyes bloating back at me....I told my friend that he was creepy.\n\nI had the Blackberry Mojito, which at $7.50 not a bad deal in that there were a bunch of peppermint leaves as well as a few of the tangy berries crushed in the traditional recipe.

Hardcore neighborhood patrons, business yuppies, and hip young people but never douche bags. The bar is tiny with friendly bartenders that know how to pour and make a real drink.  They only accept cash but for the amazing prices of the drinks, it doesn't even matter. \n\nThe Tunnel Top specializes in making mixed drinks from mojitos to martinis - ranging from $5 bucks to $9 bucks. But what makes this place special is the fact that they play good movies on the screen across the bar ranging from Hitchcock (the creepy, \"Vertigo\") to Kubrick (the creepy, \"Eyes Wide Shut\"). On the top deck of the bar, their are couches for bigger groups and on certain nights, DJs show up later in the evening and spin some good tunes. Even when you're drinking after work, the play list is usually playing something good.\n\nLibby - the bartender is super sweet and friendly. She knows how to make a killer drink. Her reason? \"I make my drinks the way I'd want to drink them.\" That's when you know this is the kind of local bar you go to. My strong Jameson and ginger ale - which they used real ginger ale instead of watered down sprite/coke was only $5 bucks. \n\nThe Tunnel Top makes a good drink, so bring some good friends and you'll find nice place to hang out. \n\n(Bonus: There are hooks under the bar to hang your purse/coat.

You figure you can cover the first round, since you're waiting for your federal tax return.\n\nYou get inside, and it looks a little like a club, a little like a lounge, a little like a dive bar, and a little like a living room. It's too dim to make out the details, but with the lights up, the Tunnel Top would probably be elegant, a grungy kind of chic.\n\nSo you send six of your closest friends upstairs to call dibs on one of the loungey sofas, probably one near the back, putting a little distance between the table and the kung fu movie screening and DJ. But before they go, you write their drink orders down on an old receipt. Ten. Ten different drinks. Three friends wait behind you, ready to help you carry ten drinks upstairs.\n\nSo you go up to the bartender, and you list 'em, ten drinks. You cross them off as she places each glass in front of you. She remembers every drink, no peeking. You are astonished.\n\nYou and some friends carry ten drinks upstairs--a huge round will cost you $40 before adding the necessary tip--and everyone clinks glasses. It's a little loud for conversation, though, so everyone splits into twos and threes. The bouncer, a burly man, swings by every so often to clear the table away.\n\nBut when you're ordering the next round, the bartender messes one drink up. One. She realizes her error even before she puts it in front of you. She won't let you pay for it. She gives you that drink, and another drink, free. When she isn't looking, you pay for both anyway.\n\nThe bar politely shoos you out near closing time, and your entire gang waxes poetic about how fun it was. Everyone's a little hesitant to leave, though, and that's the mark of a night well spent.", "author": "Jenn X."}

Good food nearby, close to downtown.  \n\nI'd recommend it, if you're looking to go out with the lounge lovers/club hoppers and get hammered, relaxed style.", "author": "Adam C."}

Not a dive bar, unless the phrase \"dive bar\" has been recently re-purposed to mean \"urban-hipster hangout.\"\n2. Great location - very nice view, interesting perspective looking out the windows kind of onto Snob Hill, kind of onto Union Square.\n3. Good ambiance - dark, woody, places to sit, I love the tables in the upstairs balcony area - reminds me of a coffee shop I used to go to when I was in college.\n4. After 7pm?  Impossible to find a place to sit, crowded with pretentious urban-hipster-assholes whose conversation often revolves around how much they paid for their jeans and/or purse and/or sunglasses and/or car and/or you get the idea...\n5. After 9pm?  Fucking packed (and, keep in mind that Tunnel Top is a tiny little bar) with a dumb ass DJ spinning music so loudly that you have to shout to be able to be heard... seriously, folks - lose the DJ - some nice ambient noise in the background would be much better for your atmosphere.\n6. After 9:05 pm?  Asshole urban-hipsters start SMOKING upstairs... which drifts down onto the main floor and pollutes my asthmatic lungs and makes my hair smell not pretty anymore... meh... fucking smokers, I don't care if you want to smoke - that's fine - but, please take it outside where it won't be ventilated into my lungs via downwards drift, etc.\n7. Drink prices, eh... alright - kind of high-ish.  I've only ever had a glass or two of wine at this bar (as it is usually a post dinner drink stop - since it's close to my apartment)... which was about $6... my brother, however, paid $10 for a single shot of Grey Goose over some ice w/very flat tonic in it.\n\nOverall - I WANT to love the Tunnel Top for it's unique location and general ambiance (sans the DJ, urban-hipster assholes, etc)... but, at the same time I WANT to hate it for it's crowdedness, high-ish drink prices and the fact that I always leave there smelling like (and, feeling like - *cough, cough, cough*) I smoked a pack of Marlboro Reds.\n\nIt's a love/hate relationship -- check it out for yourself... maybe it's just me.", "author": "Kate R."}

For one thing you will run into one or two yuppified patrons, but don't let this put you off, the crowd is mixed you will find a few locals, people on their way to a club, maybe even a tourist or two. There is a DJ upstairs, as well as a  couch and a handful of tables for your seating pleasure. I love this place because it feels like an  escape from some of the more rowdy, annoying union square bars. \nThis is not to say that it can't get loud or crazy in here, but the energy and vibe say San Francisco (with a touch of Europe) to me, and I guess this is why I love coming here. If you go, I recommend heading upstairs, and keep on  walking towards the windows. This is the place you want to sit with your well earned beer, or cocktail, and companion. You get a view of passersby, some fresh air, and comfortable seating, all tucked away into a little alcove of a space.\nThe cocktails are good and strong, the way they should be. I got a pomegranate martini which was delish but almost impossible to drink upstairs without having it spill on me,hence the need for a table. My favorite time to go is on a lazy Saturday afternoon, it isn't as packed as it is at night, I can grab a table by the windows, and spend a pleasant, leisurely weekend.", "author": "X marks the spot .."}

Either one works for this review.\n\nThe bar was busy, but not the kind of packed you'd find in somewhat similar bars. We ended up sitting right at the bar for most of the night, ordering $4 Newcastle pints until around 1:30 am. The bartender was pretty nice and didn't mind when my friend decided to order 4 buttery nipples one at a time because his co-workers who couldn't stop talking about their stupid jobs liked them so much.\n\nThe DJ played a lot of hip hop, which was alright. Wu-Tang was a plus.\n\nPeople seem to drop their glasses or spill their drinks when they're standing on the upper level, though. Twice someone dropped their drink, spilling on someone below. That was definitely not cool, especially when glass came raining down like death from above.\n\nI'd probably come back to this place once or twice and I'll end up giving it another star, but only if they make everyone upstairs tape their drinks to their hands and if the place doesn't smell like urine.

It is difficult to socialize with a large group unless you are lucky and snag one of the 2 large booths upstairs which are fabulous.

It seems that their bartenders are all just a bit more friendly than bartenders at comparable establishments.  We often order Fernet shots when we come here, and this last time our nice bartender gave us a complimentary taste of Averna, an Italian bitter digestif, because he thought we might like to try it.  Very cool!\n\nIt has a dark atmosphere and a cool vibe.  Another plus is that we can go there and not feel like we're too much older than everybody else.  \n\nI also like the fact that it's perched almost precariously above the Stockton Tunnel-- hence the name Tunnel Top.  It's above the infamous Green Door, right across the street from the Sutter Street entrance to the Sutter Stockton garage, and really just steps away from Union Square.  It's right near all those touristy places, but yet literally above it all.  A great place.  Just note that it is NOT open on New Year's Eve, as we found out this past year.", "author": "Dave N."}

I had been before and it was an ok experience, but yesterday they opened on their day off to take in the overflow from the Crudo benefit - even with the massive influx of drunks they were charming! The spot is adorable with a fantastic upstairs where you can canoodle the night away, of which there were plenty of couples doing.  Something about the ambiance lends itself to make-outery. When it was time to kick us out the staff were very nice, but firm (I said firm staff). We took our glasses down & put them on the bar, because I'm ocd that way, and they were really gracious about that.

We ran into this dude David Molina that we know and chatted and danced and drank one too many Jameson neats... oh yea all the smoking all the crosses... i missed this bar. I even got some peeps to trek out from bernal because of the word.... \"where you at?!?!?\" \"Tunnel\"...", "author": "o. c."}

I myself would say it was like a charming little wooden cabin in the middle of a city.  Aside from the warm interior the Tunnel Top had good music that kept me and my friends upbeat and put us in the mood to laugh.  We found ourselves not only reminiscent but totally delighted with the vibe that was going on there.  The drinks were good and not overpriced.  Despite our To Do's in SFC, the Tunnel Top was it for us...love at first drink", "author": "Niki M."}

The place wasn't crowded about 7:30-8:30 when we were there. Just a few small groups. The place is pretty dark which makes it feel a little more comfortable and intimate. My boyfriend and I were able to enjoy a nice conversation at the bar. It is a nice casual place to start the night.", "author": "Lauren H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2005-07-16", "description": "The nicest thing about the tunnel top (i'm not a smoker so I can't totally get behind the smoke thing) is that from the top floor in the back you can grab a window seat that looks down onto the entrance.  it's perfect for anonymous scoping OR (if you're feeling bold after the relatively strong drinks), the windows open and you can actually prevent patrons from leaving or entice those questionable ones to enter.  The key take away from this: strong drinks.", "author": "Anjali K."}

One of a kind, probably because it doesn't fall into a distinct polar category of a specific type of bar.  Far from sticky loud sports bar as well as far from overpriced pretentious lounge, it's where you can grab a drink with a friend from any of the diverse cliques of San Francisco. \n2. They have girly drinks and I don't have to dress girly. But I probably will dress girly, um, well girlie drinks are under $10, so I'm a happy camper.\n3. You can sit down!.\n4. You can sit down up high on the 2nd floor interior balcony!\n5. It's right near Union Square on your way to the Marina/ Russian Hill/ North Beach. So great for happy hour when you're on your way home, given it is on your way home. Yay circular reasoning!\n6. They play music at a volume that you can actually have a conversation over.\n7. I haven't experienced it to be so crowded that I can have a martini glass. I spill carrying a covered cup of coffee, it is rare of I can carry and not spill a martini glass.\n8 There is a beer bottle chandelier!\n\nEhh, not so loves\n1. Cash only, so stock up or use the in house ATM that I bet has a fee.\n2. You'll have to go up the tunnel steps and risk stepping on a bum.\n3. One of those places where the line for the bar is in the same location of the line for the ladies room. There's only so many ways you can organize a small space, but if crowded this can be a problem.", "author": "Lisa E."}
