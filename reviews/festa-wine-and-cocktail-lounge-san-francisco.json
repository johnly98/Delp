I happen to live in Japantown, and have checked out quite a few of the karaoke options here. \nIf you like the idea of paying a lot of money, renting a room, and singing in the privacy of your small circle of friends, then Festa is NOT the place for you. \nBut if you like the idea of singing in front of everyone in a small, intimate bar, then Festa is perfect! They have a huge selection of songs, including very recent ones. The staff are friendly and supportive. They make some pretty good cocktails for just $10 each, which is a good deal in many SF places. \nBest of all, I've been to Festa about 5 times, and every time, the audience is fun, kind, diverse, and very supportive.

We happened to randomly find this place when we were walking by the mall and heard a group loudly singing Bohemian Rhapsody. The inside is really nicely decorated with a city skyline silhouette and mood lighting, a stage in the corner and a bar on one side.\n\nThe staff is friendly and accommodating (the first time, we showed up a half hour before closing), and the drinks are decent - especially the sparkling ros\u00e9. The second time, we showed up at 8pm on a Saturday, and were the first ones in the bar. However, it quickly filled up - by 9, it was packed.\n\nPros: it's open until 3am!

It was about 12:45 AM. \n\nThere were still several big groups there, a lot of them were pretty drunk and singing songs and stuff.  What you'd expect from a karaoke bar at this time of night. \n\nWe ordered a few drinks and looked at the karaoke book.  I found a song and paid $2 to queue it in. \n\nAt about 1 AM, the big group of drunk people were calling it a night so there were just my friends and a couple other groups.  But at this point, a few of the staff were sitting around the bar stools, just looking at us.  You know, as if to give the impression that they're just waiting for us to be done. I asked one of them what time they closed and they said 1:30 (not 2 AM).\n\nSo I decided to close out my tab since, whatever, it was getting late anyway.  A couple minutes after I paid, one of the older women of the staff (probably the owner?) came up to my table of friends with the receipt and plainly said \"You didn't tip\".\n\nMind you, all I ordered was a bottled beer and a canned soda (amounting to almost $17).  There was literally no service involved.  If it was a cocktail or something, sure.  If they actually brought our orders to the table instead of me having to go to the bar to get them, maybe that would warrant a tip for services.  But again, there was literally no service involved.  And since we were going to head out anyway, I paid $2 for a song that I wasn't even going to do.  But whatever, I gave her a single dollar. She snatched it and walked away without saying anything. Afterwards a couple of my friends even looked at each other like, \"what the heck?\"\n\nWe weren't even the last group to leave.  It was about 1:20 AM.  Someone change the hours listed here on Yelp. \n\nOn the positive side, the karaoke song selection is one of the best and most diverse I've seen, and the books are very organized.  Also the decor is very nice.  It really is just too bad that the staff left such a sour taste.  Before the night was over, I was getting ready to tell everyone this was the place to go for late night karaoke in Japantown.  Oh well.", "author": "Daniel R."}

A place to spend a few hours here listening to above average singers while sipping on reasonably priced cocktails and beer. \n\nMy gripe with this place is more around the system. While I get the system is meant to be fair, there is room for improvement when our larger group only gets in 1 song per hour while a single guy gets in twice as many songs. We came with a group of 7 people around 9pm on a Saturday. Because of Festa's system, our first song came on a little after 10. Our next song came on around 11:30. We were there a total of 4 hours and got to sing 4 songs. Since most of the songs were either solos or duets, only about 2/3 of our group got to sing. I suppose it's not so bad if I pretend that I am at a bar drinking and listening to an entertainer.

Located on the second floor, inside the Kinokuniya Building in Japantown, this small little place is where I conquered my fear of singing in front of a crowd. It is just one room, with a stage and bar. No hiding from strangers in private rooms like many karaoke places. This place is definitely not for those that shy from singing and yet, small enough to overcome that hurdle a little more easy. \n\nAt $2 per song, you're able to belt your lungs out. There are folders of thousands of popular songs in English and Japanese. I think I've even seen a Chinese song accidentally put on once. There are two mics on stage for you to sing duets, but not enough for boy band hits :|...unless you share mics. I did find that the volume for the music is too quiet for rock songs. The one unfortunate thing is that it's CASH ONLY to sing. So make sure you bring your dolla bills or get ready to sing a few if you have larger bills!\n\nI love the decor of the stage. There fiber optic lighting above to emulate singing under the stars. The mini city back drop makes you stand out in front of the crowd. If it's your first time, you'd probably want to come Sunday-Wednesday when it's less crowded. Thursday-Saturday though.....it gets crowded. And I mean really crowded to the point where people have to stand in the hallway to wait for people to leave before finding a seat to sit. The place is small, probably a 40 crowded capacity, so if you're claustrophobic this is not somewhere you want to walk into. \n\nDrinks here are alright. $5 for green tea. Cocktails are reasonably priced between $9-10. I recommend the Lychee Mojito and Peach Bellini. Shots of spirits I believe are $12. Ordered Long Island once and it was mostly soda so I say stick with their house cocktails. \n\nBig thanks to my duet partna, Rodney H, for introducing me to this place.

Good drinks and tasteful decor allows more laid back vibe - every time I've been here I've met and talked with someone new.

The venue was right up my alley. It's a small lightly-divey lounge bar with dim lighting and a vintage feel, it reminds me of Summer Place (see my other review) but with windows. \nVenue: 5 stars\nDrinks: 5 stars. The Pomegranitini and the Blue Tokyo were both delicious.\nKaraoke: 5 stars. We watched a soft-spoken, heavy-set gentleman blast the doors off of \"Everything She Wants\" by Wham. It was giving me life!\nUniqueness: 5 stars. For a bar to be great in my book, it need that something extra that sets it apart from other bars. Festa has a bar cat (5 stars) and it is the cutest and grumpiest bar cat you've ever seen (6 stars). Granted it was a Scottish Fold so it's ears are naturally pinned down, but that cat's face said it all: \"NO.\" Adorable!!\n\nI can't believe I've walked the Japantown Mall so many times without ever going into Festa. It will be a regular stop on all future visits!", "author": "Summer M."}

Keep in mind, I am not a singer, but I enjoy singing tunes while I'm driving so this was a way to share some of my favorites to the audience at Festa.  Of course once you get used to being up on their stage, you get really comfortable and then actually want to belt out tunes on a whim.  If you're just starting out, I really recommend going Sunday-Wed when it's not as busy and you can get in more than one song.  The crowds are usually full of regulars during these times and they are really cool folks.  The song selections are pretty extensive and they get updated periodically.\n\nI don't drink much alcohol but they do have a nice menu of wine, cocktails, and beer.

My family was visiting from Puerto Rico and had never heard me sing, and had never seen karaoke. I said - is it OK for me to sing one song. This young girl working there (Caucasian) had such an attitude. She was drinking a beer, and made me buy an $8 water. After the transaction, she lectured me on how everyone has to order a drink. It was so awkward. I told her I had been there a thousand times and would be happy to pay extra to just sing - that we were full and weren't going to stay long. t could understand if the place wasn't empty, or if I hadn't already paid for the overpriced Voss water.

This place can get really packed on weekends, so don't expect to sing your songs close to closing time.  \n\nThe bartenders are very down-to-earth, sincere, helpful, and fairly quick in making drinks upon order.

It is very small and typically you get a group of really drunk people that just scream any nonsense. In between though, there are some descent singers. The beer choice is very limited though and I agree that their system is ridiculous. I read about Judy C who said that of all those at her table, only a couple got to sing. Yeah, that is so ridiculous. So if you come with friends, the chances of each of you singing are quite slim because they take only 1 song per table per rotation. YES! DON'T GO. And to make matters worse, one of the bar tenders, a skinny slimy kind of guy who admittingly has been fired from his last 2 places,  gets up and sings several times and tells the crowd it was by request...yet noone knows who requested it.

I also like the city skyline background when you sing, as it makes for great photos!  \n\nFinally, they do a decent job of taking your requests and rotating between different tables to make sure different groups get a turn.  (Of course the negative side of this is that if you have multiple people in your group, it can take awhile for you to get to sing).  \n\nBut it's a decently up to date song list (not the most current songs though),  $2 a song, and about $10 a drink.  For a few hours of entertainment it cost us $25 apiece so that seems okay.  The crowd definitely ebbs and flows - you have your regulars who sing Frank Sinatra and other oldies - but as always, the fun quotient depends on who else is there too.

The prices are a lot cheaper than renting private rooms and the stage and lounge area is intimate enough to where you don't feel intimdiating standing up on stage. I thought the sound equipment was also a lot better, although, a few additional screens (namely in front of you) would have been better than having to keep looking off to the side on a smallish screen on a shelf for lyrics. \n\nAgain, great intimate lounge with some of the best singers I've heard yet (aside from Martuni's) and at only $2 bucks a song, you truly only pay for the songs you end up singing. The drinks are obviously still pricey as with any bar/lounges are, however, since I'm not into drinker, I was able to just pay for my songs and then leave whenever I wanted. \n\nOverall, it was a great first experience here and I even made some a few fans at the end of the night! :)\n\nPS.

It's the way to go, folks. And I speak from my experience at Festa!\n\nWe had just done room-style karaoke at a random sketchy place a little further down Fillmore. The lack of English selection there was just not cutting it for us, so we peaced out after an hour in search of something else in the area. Walking on Post, I saw the sign for Festa, and remembered my cousin had always raved about that place. We decided to hop into Japantown to check it out.\n\nThe minute we walked in, I randomly saw my supercool friend Jason C. on stage singing with a drunk dude and instantly knew it was gonna be a good night. He saw me just as the next song he requested--Total Eclipse of the Heart, one of my go-tos--was coming on, and called me up to sing with him. So I did! Ain't no thang. The crowd loved it... just sayin'. That's how I roll at karaoke.\n\nBut seriously. This spot has officially won me over as my favorite karaoke bar in SF. It's a bit smaller than the other ones I've been to, but as a result there are less people and you have more chances to sing. I think the size also makes it's impossible for you to have left the bar without making new friends (maybe it was just the night I went, but the crowd vibe here is super fun). There's also a full bar with the friendliest people ever serving you huge Sapporo beers ($10). The twinkling city skyline backdrop on the stage is not as cheesy as it sounds and only adds to the magic.\n\nAnd of course, you never know who you'll run into here. Shoutout to my buddy Jason C. Til we sing together again ;). Festa forever!", "author": "Kate V."}

If you walk in and see an unidentified skyline on the small stage, you know you've come to the right place.\n\nWhat I like best about this particular karaoke joint is the fact that everyone pays $2 to sing and there's no cheeseball KJ there to sweet talk. Just write down your song selection, hand it to the bartender and they'll queue it up and add the monies to your overall tab. Brilliant! This way, it's all fair and square.\n\nI've been here a handful of times and it's always a blast. Since the setting is so intimate, it's impossible not to get  caught up into whatever song the person on stage is singing. Definitely a great place to make new friends.

I've introduced many friends to Festa and everyone has enjoyed coming here, as far as I know.  They keep pretty up-to-date on their songs, but also maintain a nice list of the classics.  \n\nSo, this is how it works: you write your song on a slip of paper, hand it to the staff at the bar, and wait nervously for your song to play.  While waiting and feeling somewhat regretful for the situation you just put yourself in, you end up downing a beer or taking a (few) shot(s) to calm your nerves.  By the time your song is up, you're too buzzed/drunk to even care; as far as you know, you rocked it!  It's a formula for a great night, if I do say so myself.\n\nDrinks are a bit pricey here; you can easily rack up a hefty bill between drinks and songs, which cost $2 each (free before 9 on M-Th, I believe).  It's always a fun time though, and the patrons here are always nice and supportive of whoever is up on stage singing, so don't be shy!", "author": "Thi D."}

No, we come here to have a good time, laugh about our tone deafness, and share our drunken embarrassment on stage in front of strangers, who are also doing the same.\n\nIt's pretty inmate here, I wish it was bigger or that they'd expand it a little. The bar area could be minimized to increase the efficiency. The same could be said about the narrow hallway as well. What's really funny is that the sound of the place could be projected out onto the streets, and delight people passing by.\n\nDrinks weren't cheap, and the bartenders had a hard time keeping track of who bought which drinks, so our tabs were mixed up pretty well at the end of the night. They have every single song you can think of. The stage is tiny as well, but we managed to fit 8 people up there, although it was a very tight squeeze.

Sure!  Will enough practice with Rock Band let you swagger up on stage and start belting them out like Bruno Mars?  It can't hurt (and for that matter, neither does a few rounds of Dutch Courage), but at the end of the day, there's absolutely nothing like singing in front of a live audience.\n\nI always wanted try Karaoke, but I never did; then I joined Yelp.

The Elite of the Elite Yelpers all have one thing in common though - they'll try almost anything once!\n\nAt the tail-end of a Winter night earlier this year, a car-load of uber-Elites and I drove to this very-well hidden bar in Japantown.  Earlier that night, we had visited Little Star for some world-class deep-dish pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz/little-star-pizza-san-francisco#hrid:pakEuBxSaTX6zgJmErQ0GQ, then moved on to Cantina for some premium pre-Karaoke fortification.  I was feeling well-fed, well oil, and ready to wrestle 'gators when we arrived at the strip mall that contained Festa.\n\nIt's a good thing Bobby L., was driving - I never would have found the place in a 1000 years, even with the nav app in my Droid; well hidden doesn't begin to describe this bar!  Bobby could have found it in his sleep (and he probably has a few times) - displaying the ease of long practice, he guided us unerringly to the door.

There are 4 huge song books which are alphabetized by song title, artist, or language.  One of my friends started leafing through the book looking for a tune; I glanced over her shoulder, and saw \"That'll Be The Day\" by Buddy Holly - I remembered most of the words (heck, there are only about six of 'em) so that was my choice!\n\n\nIt's $2 per song, and no \"official\" DJ, so watch the prompter for your song - when it starts, you're on!  One by one and in pairs (duets are no problem here) my friends did the deed; then it was my turn.  I grabbed the mike, jumped up on stage, and sang for all I was worth...\n\nWhile I probably could have scared The Dead with my caterwauling, I lived to tell the tale.

The kj last night not only was rude and dismissive but he basically told our friend that if she came outside and had a cigarette with him then he \"might play our songs\". Are you seriously blackmailing us after we paid for songs to be played? Not only do you owe us our money back for purposely not playing our songs but you are never getting a single dollar from us again. and I'll be telling all our karaoke loving friends to never come here again.", "author": "Holly D."}

They are here to take your money.  Take note.  The karaoke is there to make those of us uncomfortable enough to purchase liquid courage.  It is a means to an end.  \n\nI was so impassioned by Festa customer service - that I opened up a yelp account to write my first review.  Thanks Festa!  You are so inspiring.  \n\nThere have been two occasions where I have felt like Festa's staff took a big, sloppy dump on my face.  \n\n1.)  Last year a group of my friends and I became addicted to karaoke.   We found Festa and instantly fell in love...we went every week for a month and a half, until we kept noticing that our table was not getting as much play as other tables.  We waited patiently in disbelief, one week after another.  We were in denial that they were playing favorites with other customers, colleagues and parties.  Finally one week, I tracked that bald KJ's movements and noticed that - yes- we were getting skipped.  F-ing shameless.  So after waiting an additional hour for any one of my party of 5 to go up, I went up to ask him where we were in the queue.  He shuffled around, searching only to reveal that he had put all 5 of our requests in a stack a foot away from the queue.  That night, we all got our money back and we left there promising never to return.  \n\nThis is what I think happened:  Being that we enjoyed karaokeing, we didn't need to calm our nerves with several drinks to get up on stage.  That night there was a birthday party ripe with karaoke newbees that had entered after us, which took priority over our requests.  This is what FESTA does.  \n\nAnd we didn't go back for a year..\n\n2.)  But we stupidly returned hoping that things had changed because we had loved Festa.   \n\nTonight was my second time back to Festa, and I was once again disappointed by their GREEDY soul-less ways.  \n\nWhen I arrived at the bar I greeted my friends with hugs.  Unfortunately, I clumsily knocked over two full drinks when my bag swung forwards while leaning to greet a friend.  I immediately took the drinks to the bar and told the bartender.  She said yes.. and then made the drinks.  Then she asked for money.  And i said, \"no it was an accident. They hadn't drunk any of it.\"  She kind of smirked and went to get the bald KJ and i retold the story to him.  He just stood there with a look of \"what's your point?\".  He charged me full price.  I tried to bargain for half price.  He offered only to take full price.  I bought my friends their drinks.  Ultimately, it was my fault.  \n\nI owned a restaurant for 25 years, and accidents are part of the game.  Not at festa.\nI am really frustrated.  And I am really mad, but any type of complaint doesn't seem to matter to them.  So since they don't care, hopefully you the reader will.  \n\nI can't say it enough.  This is not how you treat your customers.  This is not how you run an establishment.  This is not how you treat people.  This is not how you treat regulars.  I would really like to see them go out of business.", "author": "Cin D."}

Firstly, it was crowded, which is good for business but I think that's a sign that the *****DJs shouldn't sing in between people.*****  It takes up room for the patrons to sing... Not all of my friends got a chance to sing and I had a party of 6 and we were there for 3 hours. \nSecondly, the song selection is very weak and you can't hear yourself sing. No Roy Orbison? \nThirdly, they start cleaning and kicking people out right at 1:30 am.  I hadn't finished my very expensive champagne and I was being ushered out!  They did try and be nice about having poor customer service saying  its the law and all this business about their license... I get it, but how is their licensing so different from any other joint in SF? Whatever..\nFourthly, this is the worst part... When they asked for my card to close my tab I did as I was told.  I bought one bottle of my favorite champagne for $80... They handed me the receipt to sign and said they added gratuity....??????????? I shared 1 bottle of champagne with my boyfriend!!!!! And they charged me 30% gratuity without asking!!!!!!!! 30% ?! ?!?!  Where do you get a number like that and why do you charge your patrons a gratuity?!! I filled our glasses each time... I shouldn't have to tip them $30 for walking a bottle 3 feet from the bar to my table, right?!?! And not have a say?!?! Of course when I try to dispute this I am ushered away and out,  not even able to finish my last glass.  Very bad service!!!\nThe readers of this review may wonder why there is 2 stars instead of 1..... Well, the fact they HAD my favorite champagne for sale at a karaoke joint is notable.

Tucked in the side pocket of a shopping mall in Japantown, I happened in here on the tip of some folks in the know for an evening of revelry and off-kilter crooning. \n\nThe best part about Festa has to be that they don't announce your track - essentially, you have to pay attention -- and even then -- once your song starts, you have to haul ass to get up there in time for the beginning (or chorus, or coda, or whatever's left) of your song. This results in more than the requisite helping of hilarity, and at some point in the night a pack of my group camped out on stage for what no doubt seemed like four and a half years.

If I'm there buying $9 whiskey cokes, I think my songs should be free. I promise I'll keep drinking if you let me keep singing.\n\nThe cost of the songs also dramatically changed our group's dynamic. People who normally sing a ton sang far less, and you had to be much more serious about your song choices, because no one wanted to wait in line and then pay $2 for something just for fun. It killed the group's spontaneity.\n\nThe staff was also far from friendly. They weren't very accommodating, no smiles, nothing. They did not seem to be enjoying their job.\n\nThe crowd towards the end of the night also got douchier. There were a bunch of guys at the bar who weren't there to sing, but were yelling out \"this song sucks!\" to people.

No drink specials when we were there Sat night, at least none that I saw or heard of.\n\nThis place is located in the Kinokuniya plaza.  We stayed at the kabuki next door, but if you need parking there's a lot in this plaza down below.  You can easily miss it if you're not looking out for it.   It's a really small spot with no actual stage.   You could basically sing a song from your table. There's some chairs and tables and maybe 8 stools at the bar.

They were rude from the first second we walked in....it took forever to get a drink and them they were wrong every time we order another round. \n\nPaying eight bucks a glass for a wine that I would not serve mass murders is a crime. Ever changing pricing is illegal and a crime here. \n\nThe wait staff was suspicious of my date and I at first, but they were making too much fun and saying disgustingly ignorant remarks about a table of women that they concluded were lesbians. When they when they realized we were gay became out right offensive. They talked about us, not realizing that between the two of us we understood fag comments in the several languages they tried to hide their barbaric attitudes. \n\nAll night long PEOPLE complained about not getting to sing their songs. That is because we found out later after some people left not getting their requests is because if you are not a friend of the owners then you are screwed. They charge $2.00 for the song request, then keep the money after not playing them and they use the money to buy drinks later. If they were an intelligent customer serve oriented business they could just keep a simple list in order to request songs and avoid the whole thing, but no they deliberately piss off paying customers. \n\nIf your WHITE in this bar, forget it, the owner and staff are going to make you pay for whatever transgression every white person has ever done to anyone in the history of the planet. And God forbid you are Asian, but not Japanese, you are even more screwed. \n\nI think everyone on Yelp should call the Mayor's Office, Police Dept and the Human Rights Commission and complain about illegal business practice, racism and hate crimes toward the LGBT community.

There were two-three bartenders working.\n\nI arrived there at 10PM to meet with my party of seven people and it was really mellow and a little bit dead.

My favorite so far has been the lychee cocktail. The Blue Tokyo is a little too strong for me, and the saketini is.. interesting.

Good oldies seem to dominate the list of requested songs.  \n\nThe downside: \nHere are some reasons why I knocked off 2 stars.\n- The price of the drinks. I know a cocktail for $9-10 isn't ridiculous, but... it gets old after a couple of drinks, and I wish they had more of a variety on their menu. They basically have expensive cocktails, cheaper beer ($5-10), and very expensive wine. \n\n- the selection of the songs. Ya, they have Japanese and Korean songs, and a great selection of older songs, but their newest page (as of March) was songs from January 2010, and even then, they didn't have any Gaga! This complaint is really only half-serious, but how could you not have any Gaga? Even just a few from her first album?? Maybe they don't wanna hear it every night. \n\n- the wait-time for your requested songs. Our group waited about 30 minutes for one song, and about an hour for our second song, even though we requested them within one minute of each other. You definitely have to come in, sit down, request a song first, and then buy drinks, enjoy yourselves, etc. If you hold off too long to request a song, your wait time will just get longer and longer.

I was excited when I walked into Festa to see such a nice atmosphere and hear an older gentleman singing some Sinatra. I thought then that I was in for a good night, but boy was I wrong.  I don't even know where to begin.\n\nI went on a Friday not expecting to get a million songs in, but hoping for at least 1 or 2.  I understand how the queuing process generally works at karaoke bars, so I had no problem putting in a couple song requests, having a couple drinks, taking in the other performances, and waiting. The cost per song here is $2, which is fine by me if that means less people will be inundating the KJ with drunken song requests.  \n\nI watched as the same people came up to the stage over and over, as many as 4 times, before anyone in my party even got a single song in.  It was not a question of the other people getting to the bar before us- I saw them come in at least 20 minutes after I arrived at Festa.\n\nAs the night passed, I realized that some of the repeat singers were friends of the owner.  They were seated at a table that we were told was reserved for a large party.  When the party came in, I was asked to move from my non-reserved table to make up for the space that the friends were taking at the table that had been reserved.\n\nIf the table moving experience wasn't enough of an annoyance, my song NEVER came up.  After 90 minutes had passed, I inquired about my song and saw it about 3 songs back in the queue atop a large stack of my groups requests (some of which had been paid for in cash in advance at the bar).  30 minutes later my song still didn't come up.  When I asked about it this time, hoping for a real explanation, the KJ said that it was the way the line worked and assured me it was all fair, and that my song was still 5 songs away.  So after 2 hours of patiently waiting, cheering on other singers, and buying drinks, I told the KJ to remove all my songs requests.\n\nWhen I went to close out my tab, I was charged an 18% automatic gratuity for being a part of a group of 6 or more people.  Granted, there were 6 of us, but we were never served as a group, and none of the others were charged this gratuity.  It seemed to have been made up on the spot.  And after 2 hours of being ignored, I was in no mood to leave a tip at all, none the less an 18% tip.\n\nThe entire night my group got 3 songs in TOTAL while EACH REGULAR got AT LEAST 2 songs in, and as many as 4.\n\nIt really is a shame, I was ready to give up on other karaoke spots in favor of the warm ambiance of Festa.  But after being treated as I was, I can't say that I will ever go back.  \n\nOnly go here if you are a friend of the owner.  Don't go in groups of 6, don't make friends with another table so they think you are a group of 6.  But better still, just go somewhere else where you won't be treated like shit.", "author": "Megan C."}

Do you think you can carry a tune even if your friends say you can't? If you answered yes to all of the above, then you are just what Festa is looking for on a nightly basis. Located in the heart of Japan Town, this karaoke bar is just what you need to prove your friends wrong. Rock the mic without shame and I assure you, the crowd will be behind you 100 percent! \n\nI'm more accustomed to private room style karaoke where the only people who can witness your shamelessness are the people in your group (usually your \"so-called\" friends). This type of karaoke should be more intimidating but once you realize that the people that go up on stage ahead of you don't have any qualms about looking like complete idiots, your confidence will take a significant spike. \n\nIt's funny how cheesy 80's and 90's songs bring everyone together. At one point, I got up there and rocked \"Semi Charmed Kind Of Life\" with some drunk sot who was up there butchering the song. Everyone in there, regardless of which group they belong to, always cheers you on and sings along no matter how off key you are. I guess that's why it's always a good idea to pair karaoke with alcohol. Can you imagine how we must sound without it?\n\nGood times!\n\n4.4 stars", "author": "Angelo B."}

I came in with a large group but had no intention of ordering anything even though other people were.  My friend and I asked for tap water, and the waitress brought us bottled water that she wanted us to pay for.  We refused it and politely clarified that we wanted tap water.  She came back with two Sapporos.  What?? Fine. We'll take the Sapporos, which she said (and the menu said) were $6 each.  (Reading the reviews I now realize there is a drink minimum so maybe that's why she did this, although that was not made clear to me).  I gave her my credit card, and she came back with a bill for $15.50.  $15.50?!  When I challenged it, she said I had to pay 18% gratuity because I was sitting with a large group.  But I was ordering as a party of 2!! I wasn't paying for everyone's drinks!  And even so, $12 plus 18% gratuity is $14.16, not $15.50.  I obviously refused to pay this.  Then she had the gall to come back with a $13 check, which was STILL ripping me off (since drinks aren't supposed to be taxed in a non-restaurant, and there's no way sales tax on two drinks is an even $1), but I was too fed up to protest more.\n\nAbsolutely appalling.

Oh well, for my one hundred and FIRST review I will write about a little karaoke bar called FESTA.  \n\nCame here for Aileen's unbirthday last weekend and it was pretty awesome.  Not only did our group of 8 make up practically 50% of the patrons, but by the end of the night we were friends with (almost) everyone else at the bar.  Yes, that includes the table of world travelers from Japan and Germany, the table of SoCal Koreans, and the brave solo artists at the bar.  It does not however, include the group of hooligans in newsboy caps and plaid scarves who thought singing as loudly and as annoyingly as possible would make everyone like them.  I guess that only works in the movies.  \n\nAll in all it's a chill place and an (almost) judgment-free zone for the performers.  Drinks are pricey but hey it's Japantown.  Also, there's a 10 dollar cover if you wanna reserve a table (comes with 2 free songs).  I think they lowered it to 8 bucks for us though because we were awesome or something.  \n\nSongs are 2 bucks each if you're buying them a la carte.  Never been to a karaoke bar where you had to pay for the individual song.  But then again I don't go out that much.  Only enough to make it to my ONE HUNDRED AND FIRST YELP REVIEW.

Now its updated, better lit, and filled with younger folks singing their hearts out in front of everyone, publicly humiliating themselves like the karaoke gods intended.\n\nThe big Japanese beers here are ten bucks.  A carafe of cold sake will set you back about thirty bucks.  Being the Asian math whiz that I am I asked my drunken buddy from LA, would you rather have another sake or 3 big bottles of beer?  Not the math whiz but a practical fellow of course he picked quantity over quality.\n\nI came here again with another friend from LA, in town for training this week.  She was dying to go out since she has 3 kids and her husband hates dancing, which is normal, doesn't drink, which is kinda abnormal, and doesn't like making a fool of himself in public singing karaoke, which hmmmm, is kinda normal.\n\nI ordered a glass of sake and she got the lichee cocktail.  Oh the lichee was incredibly good.  So I made a pact with her.  I'll continue ordering sake for myself and foofoo drinks for her.  Then I'll drink half her drinks and we'll go through the entire foofoo menu... that way I can secretly indulge in my foofoo drink passion while maintaining some semblance of my masculinity.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-10-31", "description": "This review should be prefaced by an admission:  I love Japan.  I don't mean I love Japan the way a person might love water skiing or chili dogs.  I love Japan the way you loved the girl you had a crush on in seventh grade.  About a year after I moved to Japan, I realized that if Japan had been personified as a woman, I would have either married her or gotten arrested by the Japanese Godzilla-helmet wearing police for stalking her, depending on how I did.  (And no, I didn't marry a Japanese woman as a way of fulfilling that strange desire and projecting it onto a person...that would have just been weird.)\n\nSo instead, in the many years since I've been back in America since living there, whenever I wander into places that are truly Japanese, I have a feeling of nostalgia that colors my judgment.\n\nThat would explain my behavior at Festa the other night.  Or it could be the drinks.  Both are perfectly plausible explanations.\n\nSo for starters, it's in Japantown and the bar is populated primarily by Japanese people.  I speak Japanese almost fluently (take note, Nance W. :) )  but of course, no one expects me to, so I get in what we used to call the 'language bubble' in these places.  The language bubble is a situation where nobody expects you to speak a certain language, so they feel free to speak in that language, often in ways they wouldn't if they knew you could understand them.  \n\nI knew this was a real Japanese karaoke bar for two reason:  the menu was small and had overpriced 'sunaku' (that means 'snacks') including the 'assorted plate' for $10, which was about 7 grapes, some cheese and crackers straight from nabicso and some kamaboko slices (don't ask.)\n\nThe second and more important reason is that everyone was doing what karaoke is really for:  humiliating themselves equally.  It's one of the ways of leveling society in Japan.  You bow to people all day higher or lower based on your social status in Japan, but once you're at the karaoke bar, everyone sucks equally, even the boss.  It's a pretty awesome tradition.\n\nAfter a couple of fun-loving, corn-fed midwestern gals left the place after singing everything in the Michael Bolton catalog, it was time to get down to business.  Japanese songs were sung.  French 75s from earlier in the evening were impairing my ability to read kanji, and I never got around to singing my favorite Japanese karaoke song, 'Shima Uta.'  Buy me a drink there sometime and I'll do it.\n\nInstead, I was pushed up onstage and made to sing (I forgot about this but it happens a lot) Elvis.  I decided that the thing to do was to just fully own it, so when 'Jailhouse Rock' came up, I just rocked that joint.  To paraphrase Samuel Jackson, to them I was Elvis.\n\nThen came 'Are You Lonesome Tonight?' which was fine until I realized there's about a 2 minute speech in the middle of that song.  (\"I wonder if...you're lonesome tonight...\"  Itunes it if you've never heard that part.)  Anyway, it was effective, judging by the reaction of the bartender, but after that we still had to take it up tempo, as one more sappy tune like that would have killed me.\n\nFinally, we got , as all white people in a Japanese karaoke bar must, to the Beatles.  After one rendition of  \"If I fell,\" I wanted to try it again, with my college buddy singing harmony, so from the stage, with microphone in hand, I asked them to play it again, but I spoke Japanese.  This was almost more than the room could bear.  What kind of a freak was I?  The language bubble was thoroughly popped, but the rockin' still didn't stop.\n\nFinally, at the end of the night, the bill was inexplicably a lot higher than we thought, which almost brought a tear of joy  to my eye because that's always what happens in Japan too.  Plus, I wasn't paying.\n\nDon't go to Festa (or any Japanese karaoke bar) hung up on singing well, or you'll make a jackass of yourself.  Just remember three words the local barkeep at the karaoke place where I lived used to say to us:  you must enjoy.\n\nThat's right.  You MUST enjoy.  The most Japanese thing of all is that just because it's fun doesn't mean you have a choice.\n\nFesta is definitely on my list of places I must enjoy again when I'm in SF.", "author": "Jim M."}

You have to order your drink now or else i will charge you for the water.\" I turned to my friend and audibly requested that she order the controversial H2O on my behalf. She ordered a beer and a water, and when he brought back all the drinks for the table he shot me a dirty look and ceremoniously sat the water down RIGHT in front of my friend. \nWe all sang a bunch of songs and actually had a pretty good time (although I credit that to the musical stylings of my crew).

The bartenders selected a song for us, and it was so bad that we got booed off lol. However besides that, these are definitely some of the nicest bartenders in the city- a boy kept buying me shots and drinks, and I because they could tell I didn't want any of them (or need anymore), they kept swapping them out for non-alcholic versions. That was definitely a first. The only downfall was that I almost got my ass kicked by a very scary girl. I accidentally spilled a little of my drink on her purse and she was not happy about it.

The tiny little karaoke bar was perfect for my cozy party of about 30 people.  The folks who run the place are super nice and friendly and the bar/lounge/bathroom are surprisingly clean.  They also let us bring in a birthday cake and provided a knife and extra paper plates at no charge.  \n\nThe crowd at Festa was awesome.  My friends and I pretty much took over the bar for the entire night and not only did no one complain, everyone sort of just joined in the party.  You can tell there were a few regulars but a couple of the groups looked like they just went to check it out and they were good sports and even helped us celebrate.\n\nThe best part was the cheesy backlit cityscape behind the stage which provided the most hilarious backdrop for photos!      \n\nThey charged us $10 a person cover since we were a large group and took up 80% of the bar but they also threw in 20 free songs which are otherwise $2 a piece.  \n\nDespite the extreme smallness of the place or maybe because of it, I had a great time at Festa and would definitely recommend it to people who like karaoke.  It's a change from the usual bar night and even if you're not a singer, you'll be thoroughly entertained.", "author": "Winnie Y."}

It's clean, efficient, and perfect for jeering or cheering your friends on.  Not to mention there's a fun cardboard skyline backdrop on stage, backlit with Christmas lights, and part of the ceiling twinkles with fake stars.

Come to think of it, it kinda reminds me of the karaoke bar in \"Lost in Translation\" and if I came here one night and found Bill Murray covering Roxy Music, I might only be mildly surprised.  The space is super intimate which only makes the idea of getting on stage all the more dangerously enticing.  Oh yes, I've seen many a hardcore opponent of karaoke go down at Festa, try as they may!  \n\nThe best thing about this place?  Number one with a bullet: the stage backdrop!  I think the owner, who is cute as hell and saccharine sweet, nicked it from the set of a Cars video (I'm thinking specifically of \"You Might Think\", but any would do).  It's pure 80's class, which if you can remember wasn't very classy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-02-14", "description": "I really wanted to like this place, especially after reading some good reviews about it.  I will NEVER return here.\n\nMoney grubbery - It is WAY too expensive.  My friend just had her birthday party there (weekend night) - they charged her a $10/person cover charge, my drink was $8 for a well drink, and then on top of that it was $2 PER song.  Then when she wanted to pull out her cake, they wanted to charge her an additional $20 to serve it.  So for 16 of us at the party to sing a song each (and have a SINGLE drink) it was $320!  You can get bottle service (including entry) at a shwanky night club for much less than that price.\n\nDisorganization - On top of that they are incredibly disorganized with the karaoke.  Unlike other bars, which request people write their own names down on an organized song request form, this place hands you a blank piece of paper and no one writes their own name down.  When you hand it back to them, they put it in a disorganized pile of paper.  I put in my paper upon arrival at 9p and by 11p still it had not been entered in the machine (it shows the waitlist).  My friend paid for 20 songs for her party and had only used about 2-3 of them when I left - while the table next to us had one girl who went up three songs back to back.  Their complete lack of organization means a lot of the same people end up singing multiple times, and other people never get to go - all the while paying $2/song!  Other bars will usually let \"new\" people get priority to be more equitable.\n\nQuality of atmosphere/service - \n1.  Bartenders both bartend and KJ which means they are overwhelmed (explaining the disorganization) but it means it takes a while to get a drink or submit a song.  They should delegate one person to KJ only.\n2. The microphones are awful!  Granted it's a karaoke bar not a music studio or anything, but these are perhaps the worst I've ever heard.\n3.  One redeeming quality is that the bar itself has beautiful lighting and wood paneling, and it is a small intimate environment like other reviewers say.\n4.  They do have a large song selection - which is also a plus.\n\nI strongly recommend against this place.  I usually only write yelp reviews when I love or hate a place.  I think it is not worth the money.  There are too many other great places in SF.   If you're reading this from the restaurant, I've offered constructive concrete changes that could improve your place of business.", "author": "N K."}

Holy crap.  What happened that night?\n\nThough I'm embarrassed to say I was only lucid for half the night, apparently that is the very essence of a really good time.  It seemed everyone else either didn't care, or rode the same shameless, tone-deaf bus that I did.\n\nNeedless to say, the drinks are strong.  REAL strong.  Pretty cool bartending crew.  I had reserved for a party of 12, so I had to pay about $10/head, PLUS 18% gratuity.  It's a bit steep for a kareoke bar, but given how packed it was, we were happy to have the prime real estate with a big table in the back.\n\nBy the end of the night, somehow an extra $34 got tacked onto the bill.  I'm pretty sure the final check was somewhere around $199 which already included gratuity.  That means, I had to have gotten out my little blackberry calculator and figure out 18% of $199 (the $34) - all in my totally inebriated state.  I don't remember doing it and was pretty unhappy to find that extra charge on my credit card a week later.  Now, the next part is what really made me like Festa - I called and left a message asking for a copy of the signed receipt. Masae, the manager who was out of town the day of my party, called me back personally to go over the charges.  We're still not clear on what happened that night.  Given my utter blackout, it's very possible I just made a mistake.  But she was happy to send me a credit for the extra amount to use the next time I went in - even though she said that amount probably went home with the bartenders and not to the bar.

A friend and I wanted to go in for a drink and a song (drink for her, song for me for her =).  We sat down at the bar, were greeted immediately and given an English karaoke book.  My friend comes for the Lychee martini (with SKYY) which I have to admit, is a silent killer.  Delicious.  I had... regrettably... a five dollar bottle of Crystal Geyser.  I wish I'd have paid attention to the menu, but keep in mind, I did ask for a \"glass of water, please.\"  Apparently, they do not offer water to their patrons.  The prices of drinks at Festa are astronomical, and there have been times where I felt like the large Sapporo was half water, but it all seemed tolerable when drunk and singing songs of joy and friendship.  It would have helped had either of the bartenders there cut us some slack and let us sing a song for the one dollar we had left after closing out our tab.  There's a ten dollar minimum for credit/debit card usage, and we weren't going to sit there and belt out five songs, so we had to accept the fact that rules is rules and sit there and listen to yet another rendition of Sweet Child o' Mine and the murder of All You Need is Love, while I tried desperately to convince myself I was drinking the best water on the planet.  \"Now I gotta know what five dollar Crystal Geyser tastes like.\"  Festa...

The bartenders are exceptionally nice, (Ken, Shogo, Satoshi) and Masae-san the owner treats us like family. We feel like family to them because this place is so small -- they make an effort to get to know their customers, but also it's part of their business: they depend on their customers to become regulars and support their bar. I've brought more than 30 different friends here over the past year and everyone leaves craving another go; it's just hard not to fall in love with the support always ready for the singer, the service always ready to ensure you have a great time.\n\nI think any of the disgruntled Yelps on this place haven't given it enough of a chance or don't fully understand how hard it must be to crowd control this place given it's so small -- it can get really rowdy in there, people start screaming into the microphone, get so drunk they break glasses or tip over tables, and because they do have a reservation policy for larger groups, sometimes you do have to move for folks who've paid an extra cover.\n\nI agree with a lot of the Festa regulars who've said it's even better on a weeknight; part of the \"Cheers\"-like draw. There have been many a work conflict or a friend disagreement thawed out by the incredibly fun and hilarious environment. I've never walked out of the bar without someone's email address for future karaoke nights. Also, you get to sing more often as fewer people are in the bar, and this has been the best time to bring people nervous to sing. Interestingly, every single person who's ever been to Festa with me who was intimidated by the Festa stage upon walking in never wanted to leave it after their debut song.\n\nIt's just an awesome discovery in a town where going out at night can be frosty, unfamiliar and too much of a scene.\n\nNone of that here. I hesitate to profess my love for Festa because I'm afraid it will become even more popular.

We did indeed add this spot to the JTown Crawl on Friday.  What I have only seen as a dark lounge filled with a couple of businessmen during the week, but have heard as a noisy hotspot on weekends or later in the evening, proved its hotspot chops.  But not with the crowd I'm used to seeing.  It seems to me that Silver Cloud got too crowded for some of the more SF savvy karaoksters and they've moved on to more intimate pastures.  Unfortunately for the rest of us.  \nWe perched at a corner table for just a moment before the waitress asked if we'd like to sit in the corner booth (which had a reserved sign on it).  Boy did we!  We snuggled in and placed our order and waited to watch some folks sing their hearts out.   I only made it through two lychee martinis (which were excellent, even if the lychees themselves were too sweet for me - canned it seems) and a little bowl of \"outlines\" which I ordered based on their name alone.  It's just snack mix - sesame stix, breadsticks, pretzels and nuts.  Why they call them outlines I have no idea, must be something lost in translation, but I love that they do.  It made them that much more delicious.  \nAs for enjoying the dulcet sounds of undiscovered American Idols, those dreams were shattered as we winced through our evening.  Two large groups of drunk and obnoxious white folk took turns singing, reading lyrics in monotone spoken word style, and/or screaming and grunting into the mics.   Luckily you need do nothing more than catch a bartenders roving eye and signal for another drink when you're dry.  If I had to get up and wade through the boisterous crowd and their cupcakey fingers I would've only had the one drink.\nI think I'm only grousing because I was hoping for the quieter, more singing based karaoke experience I had seen on previous stops, instead of the Marina spillover screamfest/microphone fight we ended up with.

They have a great sound system, so you actually sound good and can hear yourself, unlike other places that have crappy mics and speakers. Pretty good song selection-they actually have two different books, so you might want to check them both if you're searching for a certain song. Ken, the bartender/server, always makes us feel welcome. The vibe is cozy and the crowd is friendly and supportive. Festa wa totemo subarashii, desu!", "author": "Miya K."}

A small group of friends and I dominated here last weekend for a birthday party. When I say dominated, the place is small and it is very easy to cruise in, feel comfy and get the party started. The atmosphere is intimate and  non-intimidating, which promotes everyone to sing, even those that should keep their lyrical talents private can be found screaming their asses of. It's a good mix of people, only problem is pricey drinks and $2.00 songs and ultra long waits. So if you plan on putting on a performance, better get a few songs lined up at once. All in all, fun experience, did someone say mic check 1...2...?", "author": "David P."}

Otherwise, when there are other parties that are filled with mic hogs, you're \"Living on a Prayer\" and Festa just becomes a plain ol' bar. The service is attentive and friendly even for the \"Dancing Queens\". The faux skyline backdrop on stage makes you \"Hip to Be Square\".

I went there a few weeks back with my drunk buddette from the Lower Haight, gave the bartender a tip to bump us up the line for a song and lo and behold, my friend was too drunk to sing.    Then I went back last week and guess what...Marina folks!  A group of Banana Republic dress shirts/jeans guys and their Gap wearing girlfriends took over the right side of the bar being obnoxious and drunk.  The best part is everyone in the bar was laughing at them because they thought that they were so kool.", "author": "Christian N."}

The mixed crowed is great--from young hipsters to old fogies (like me).  It welcomes all.  I'm not a karaoke fan, but with a stage and \"city lights\" Festa is the place I could be converted.  But shaken manhattans and warm martinis at Tokyo prices don't help. With better bartenders, Festa could rock--even with an off pitch riff of Britney.", "author": "QuodE D."}

The crowd was nice and friendly and the staff was good too.  I would go back when feeling like I didnt mind spending a hunk of cash to have fun time in a low key karaoke bar.

My curiosity was piqued, and I forged through the veneer to find myself transported to a bar in Tokyo. My friend was similarly delighted with the kitschy skyline decor and fabulously modern red chairs. We settled in quickly even though there weren't a lot of patrons around, and after a bottle of delightful sake called \"poochi poochi\" we took to the mike stand and never looked back. More of the bar's regulars strolled in later in the evening, and none shied away from belting out some classic oldies as well as more current tunes. I ended up spending a pretty penny there but I don't think I can say it wasn't worth it.", "author": "Yan Biao B."}

The first time me and my friends had a wonderful time. We were enjoying our drinks and performances. But last night... wow... me and my friends (the same ones from last time) decided to come here after a late dinner for some drinks and entertainment. Boy were we in for a treat! We came in it was pretty empty which we didnt think much of because it was a Wednesday night. This man (theres a picture of him in all black wearing a hat) came to seat us, we really didnt need his help being that only 2 tables were being occupied (we were waiting for the rest of our party, but we followed him to the table. He giggled and made our party show ID. So we were looking through the book of songs from \"Septemeber 2008\" and the waitress came over to take our drink orders. 2 people in our party didnt want to drink but she said \"there's a one drink minimum\" (which we didnt have before) so they ordered drinks and we moved on. So we waited a little while for our drinks, when they came the waitress spilled one of them on my friend. I had a mojito that was VERY watery and small for $9. Before we could finish our drinks she came to ask us about our bill. 2 people were together and the other 3 were with me. She came back with 3 checks, i had my card out already so i grabbed my two checks and handed it back to her... My other friend decided to keep her tab opened. So the waitress returned with my reciept I signed it. Left no tip becuz I was planning on leaving cash after I was done drinking. The waitress took the check. After the males in our group stepped out for a smoke, the giggling man came to our table and told me \"Um, you didnt leave a  tip\"; I told him \"I know, I was going to leave cash when Im done\" He then says \"This is America, you need to leave a 20% tip!\" Um... I don't recall seeing that in the constitution, so my response of shock and laughter was understandable. When our other friends come back we tell them the story and they laugh. So Im still there sipping on my mint water when one of our friends goes to get one more drink and to close their tab. The giggling man told him \"Make sure she gives a tip\" which my friend tells me. His wife is going over their tab and they were charged extra money. So we approach the bar because we are leaving; they tell her they charged her $3 tax for keeping their tab open... Now, to me this is something that  they should had stated when they decided to keep the tab open. So, in the end they over charged my friend and recieved no tip from me because they were very rude by asking me for a tip when I was not leaving. Guess I we will have to just find a neww spot because I will never be back to this place ever again!", "author": "Jo C."}

We got here early on a Saturday night ~7.30pm. The place was almost empty, just a couple of others. We got in about 6 songs each before it filled up quickly at around 9pm. This place is small so it fills up fast and you won't be singing many songs after that.\nSound system was definately sub-par though compared to what I'm used to (7bamboo in San Jose Japantown is way superior). Mikes are sub-standard and they had the echo up way too high. Also, music level was often much too high, drowning out the singers voice. I had to ask the barman to turn down the music on some of my more quieter numbers. Place seems pretty friendly, staff OK. Can't comment on the cost as my Japanese colleagues paid but $2/song isn't too unreasonable I guess for Japantown. (7Bamboo in SJ charges $1 for a song). They had a huge collection of Japanese songs which was great.", "author": "Chris P."}

After such long wait and horrible service/attitude, who still wants to continue to sing there? \nI ordered 3 songs at the same time, 2 of them played after about waiting there for an hour. I went up there saying that I ordered 3 songs all at the same time, is the 3rd one forgotten? and put down the 4th one. I was told that she could not play my songs all the time had to play others too, so I had to wait, it would be my turn after another 6 songs. After 6 songs, I went up there and asked again, she said it would be mine the next. After another a few rounds seeing others singing back to back, we thought it was not right. I went up there for the 3rd time to ask, the gal who was in charge of running the songs said: \"see others were tipping us and you never give us tips!\" AH...there were reasons behind it...  So we explained that we had been tipping the bar tenders big time... however, apparently, she randomly throw out my 3rd song, it was no longer even in the queue any more... \n\nAt that point, we felt so sick with these rude people. We asked for refund - really rather not to deal with them... she threw the money on the counter with another one song's refund short... \n\nI will never return that place again.

The first time we went, we found it to be one of the only authentic karaoke bars in Japantown that did not serve as a brothel on the side and we had a terrific time singing with the owner and buying our $6-$8 drinks. However, we went there tonight with a group of friends and when our final tab came, the bartender took the priveledge of charging us $10 a drink, added on drinks that we paid in cash to our friends' tab, and charged us $2 a song without ever notifying us of the \"karaoke song\" charge in the first place. We will never go there again and would advise likewise.", "author": "Lauren H."}

I have been to quite a few karaoke joints and this one, I have to say, hands down, makes me feel so comfortable and at home and I keep wanting to go back. I love that it's sort of hidden, off the beaten path. It's kind of small and cozy...not intimidating for non-pro singers if you get my drift. The staff is very attentive, classy and also fun. They sometimes sing themselves! The drinks are really well done. I get a lemon drop ever time...done to perfection. This place is in my neighborhood which I love. I have had many many friends come here and we've all had the best time. Each night is slightly different of course. Weekends are more crowded and get big groups sometimes. Weekdays are nice, a mixture of people just getting off there bartending/waitressing jobs nearby, people staying at the nearby hotel and locals wandering in. EVERYTIME I have been here, what I have been impressed by is the support of the crowd. It can be all types of people, old and young, all ethnicities and we're all cheering each other on whether good or bad. It's a real confidence booster to get on stage and sing your heart out and have adoring fans around. A real nice way to let loose. I did read some of the other reviews on here before I wrote this and I almost wish I didn't because I'm saddened to see how they diss the staff. You have to know this staff deals with people yelling into the mic and getting a bit carried away in intoxication at times. They are trying to accommodate new comers and trying to please everyone. So I don't find it unreasonable that they accommodate as they see appropriate. I am so happy and proud to have this relatively new restaurant in my neighborhood. It is one of the finer new establishments to bring the Fillmore district back to life in a positive sense. I have come here for brunch, dinner dates, a company Christmas party, for the drinks at the bar and for apps and drinks in the lounge area. I love decor: the historical jazz pictures with the light behind them on the walls, the unique decorative hanging lamps, and the dark wood. I really like the way this place sections off to make it more intimate whether for private parties or if it's not that buy and they close off certain sections. Oh, the music is jazzy of course. Romantic, classic, soulful, happy and fun. The staff are cheery, helpful and knowledgeable. Ok, the best for last...the food is AMAZING! I have gotten the pork main (YUM!), the shrimp and grits app (YUM!) and the butternut squash soup (YUM again!). I've gotten a lot more than that but that's what comes to mind..haven't had anything bad or even mediocre there basically. This a really classy without being pretentious place and I highly recommend you go there NOW!", "author": "Keri R."}
