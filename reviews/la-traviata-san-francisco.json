My grandma lives in the City and from time to time, we like to take her out for dinner and let her try something that is not Chinese food...\n\nThis time we decided on Italian obviously or this would be a awkward review. We ordered a few items to share. Among them were the  \nMozzarella in Corozza (fried mozz) as an appetizer, Alla Carreras (Sausage and marinara pasta), Lasanga (you know what it is..),   Cioppino (this one too), La Traviata (Veal), Caesar, and Minestrone. The food was delicious at least the ones I ordered were. The Alla Carreras, Cioppino, and Fried Mozz was the best and worth returning for, so all 5 stars are for them. The rest of the stuff was whatever, edible, but I wouldn't order them again. Maybe you'll disagree and like them a lot. Good for you! Parking was a hassle, but it's City so that's nothing unexpected. Nice spot in the Mission! \n\nWilly's Tip Jar: Got 2 this time. \n1. When you are give then option, take whatever pasta they serve in your dish sub it for pappardele. (Applies at any place, very versatile move here!)\n2. Try their Aurora Sauce. They mix the marinara and alfredo. It's very good. I asked them to put it in the Alla Carreras.", "author": "Wilson C."}

I went with a party of 4 on a Wednesday and no wait time. Ordered the Melanzane Embotite and the All Ricciarelli for my entree. \n\nThe Melanzane Embotite was freshly made. I felt that the eggplant dish itself was slightly salty, but the tomatoes complimented it well to balance out the flavor. For the All Ricciarelli, the sauce was creamy but not too heavy.

I'll have to settle for kinda sorta liking a few things while coming away disappointed with most. \n\nWe got off to a bad start when I walked in and the place was at least 80 degrees. No AC.  This seems to be a San Francisco thing. I don't like sweating while I eat. Had I not made a 15 minute cab ride, I would have walked out. \n\nThe relatively small dining room is warm and elegant, with white tablecloths, upholstered chairs, and walls lined with pictures of opera singers and other assorted Italians. It was less than half full on a Friday night.  Service was professional but not super sharp. They play opera and other Italian music, which most Italian restaurants unfortunately don't. \n\nMy \"polpo vinaigrette\" appetizer was three small octopi over some field greens. The octopus was fine, but the whole thing was overdressed with too much heavy,  oily dressing (which didn't taste like olive oil). It needed more zip. \n\nThe Veal La Traviata entree was much better -- three fresh, tender, high quality slices of veal that had been lightly dredged in flour and cooked in a delicious sherry sauce that was probably a pan reduction, and topped with good prosciutto and melted mozzarella. Plus a side of spaghetti I asked for. This was a very nice dish and one you don't find just anywhere.  It was the only satisfying part of the experience, though it was marred when I discovered I had been charged 7.95 for a small portion of spaghetti with no extra sauce.  (They took off the charge after I complained.) \n\nThe $7.50 \"gelato spumone\" was just a big,  careless bowl of some run of the mill commercial spumoni ice cream you could get in a grocery store. Calling it \"gelato\" is fraud. \n\nThey have a terrific variety of Italian whites and reds by the glass. I had a vernaccia and a nebbiolo, both good, though the Nebbiolo was served much too warm, obviously because it was kept standing around in an 80 degree+ nook off the kitchen.  The pours aren't generous, and they're served in wine glasses that are too small, especially for a $14 glass of red.  (Unless you're at the owner's table in the corner. They had nice big, real wine glasses.) \n\nI guess I'm glad a place like this is still around, but it could have been so much better.  The place seems to be just coasting. I'm guessing it's not the original owners.", "author": "Steve S."}

We ended up eating up all the sauce with the delicious warm bread they served with our meals.\n\nAlso, we loved the atmosphere, it felt so much like the North End in Boston or Little Italy in New York.

We came here for take-out on a whim after getting pedicures nearby so this review is for that. When I walked in the place was pretty empty, barring one couple who was dining in and the hostess which was on the back texting on her phone.\n\nShe attended me promptly and went to grab my food. $38.00 for take-out is a little steep but those are the prices and one must accept what is. My husband's lasagna was *solid* and this is what carries this particular review. We very much enjoyed dipping the complimentary bread in the sauce (nammmm). My chicken \"Alla Beverly Sills\" was okay, however I was a little surprised that my sides were only grilled vegetables. No pasta, no potatoes, nada. I ended the meal still hungry so therefore I'd recommend two lasagnas next time. Perhaps we can even go in and give it a whirl in person.", "author": "Joanna R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-01-17", "description": "Gee, here's another old-fashioned Italian spot I had never heard of until recently, but I have less excuse this time since it's not in some neighborhood miles away from me but on a rather well-trod section of Mission right out of the 24th Street BART station. At first, I thought it would be a quiet spot to get some pasta but I noticed two long tables being prepared for large, socially unwieldy parties. Because I was a solo diner that evening, they had no choice but to be put me at a table smack in the middle of the two with the guests arriving in waves as soon as I sat down. No smiles in my direction, just small-mouth.\n\nYou can tell the gregarious guests wished I was dead as I was getting in the way of their cumulative frivolity as they leaned freely on my table while I tried to eat. Besides which, it was a bitch for any of the serving staff to get to me. Could they have sat me down in any worse place? Next to the restroom stall, I suppose. I tried ordering quickly. I went for the $9.95 Bruschetta del Giorno, a chef's choice as he put mushrooms and ricotta on little pieces of crusty toast (photo: http://bit.ly/2iNUe5k). It's probably a shame that I had tried a much superior mushroom bruschetta at Spiazzo in West Portal. these were skimpy with what tasted like canned mushrooms.\n\nI had better luck with the $18.95 Animella Alla Scotto, sweetbreads with fresh tomatoes, mushrooms, and onions (photo: http://bit.ly/2jvhx54). I rarely order sweetbreads, but I love them when they are prepared right which they have to be to avoid an unpleasant texture. These passed the texture test just barely, and the hearty red sauce helped complement the flavor. I decided to extend the displeasure of my presence with the parties by ordering dessert, the $8 Tiramisu, which was prepared traditionally with ladyfingers and mascarpone (photo: http://bit.ly/2jIZ567). Even though it was likely made hours in advance and refrigerated, it was likely the most satisfying part of the meal.\n\nFOOD - 2.5 stars...somewhat amiss with the sweetbreads adequate and the mushrooms not fresh tasting\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...plenty of opera paraphernalia on the walls to live up to its name\nSERVICE - 2 stars...felt ignored amid the crowds\nTOTAL - 2 stars...old-school Italian that just felt plain old", "author": "Ed U."}

There was a really amazing looking photo of a meal on their Postmates page, so I thought I would get that. It was my mistake as I should have checked the menu on the website for the full details - sometimes Postmates doesn't give you all of the same options. \n\nAnyway, I got the Alla Ricciarelli. It was basically an entire container of spaghetti noodles covered in a cream sauce that had no taste or flavor at all. I didn't want to add even more calories by adding cheese or something that would give it some taste, so a little black pepper sort of went a long way.

The entrees my wife and I have tried there include the carbonara, the sausage pasta (usually linguini but sometimes spaghetti), and the gnocci with pink sauce.\n\nFor appetizers, the fried mozzarella is great. It's covered in a delicious marinara sauce, and once we finished the mozzarella, we started dipping our bread into the sauce to not let it go to waste.\n \nI have to mention the bread as well - It's really, really good. It's always served piping hot like it just came out of the oven, and it's crispy on the outside but really fluffy and flavorful on the inside. Both times I was at La Traviata, we went through at least two baskets of their bread.\n\nAs for the service, it's always been consistently good when I've been there. They were quick to pour us more water when we were almost empty, and they'd proactively bring out more bread when they saw that we were about 2/3 through our original basket.\n\nThe interior ambience is quite nice and has a very \"family\" atmosphere, including a Christmas tree at the front when you first walk in. The owner is supposedly a huge opera fan, and so the walls are literally covered with portraits of different opera singers, and you'll hear opera music playing in the background as well.\n\nLast but not least, if you still have room for dessert, their Tiramisu is quite good, and big enough for two people. I believe they said it's homemade.", "author": "Peter S."}

La Traviata was a spur of the moment decision and although I didn't love the food, I'm still happy to have tried it out.\n\nSF is full of trendy, hip, fancy restaurants that sometimes we forget about the neighborhood gems that have been around for decades. La Traviata is certainly one of those spots that have been around forever. \n\nI ordered Linguine Alla Carrera (with sausage, mushroom, and fresh tomatoes) and felt that the dish was really mediocre. It's not any better than what I could make at home and the sauce seemed super watery.\n\nMy date ordered Tinta (squid ink pasta). I've had squid ink in dishes before but this version looked very messy and unappetizing.

I was immediately drawn in by the authentic old-school Italian look and feel to the restaurant and the extensive menu looked promising. \n\nTHE FOOD: \n\nComplementary Warm Bread: Simple and delicious, but served with cold butter straight from the fridge. I always see this as a big no-no. Butter should be room temp! \n\nProsciutto e Melone ($8) : High-quality prosciutto over four slices of cantaloupe. Simple and good, but maybe a bit too simple? I felt like I could have put this together at home. \n\nGnocchi w/ Aurora (Pink) Sauce ($14): This house special was pillowy soft and drenched in a luscious pool of creamy pink (tomato-cream) sauce. As much as I loved the texture though, the flavors in the dish were too subtle and monotone. \n\nMushroom Veal ($18): Tender and coated with a nice sauce, but I couldn't taste any of it! The dish was very bland, both the veal with mushrooms and onions, and the vegetable side dish. I had to continuously sprinkle salt onto my bites, and honestly not even that helped very much. \n\nThe prices are high, considering the portions are on the smaller side, and my terribly under-seasoned food left much to be desired. The decor is welcoming and the servers are very friendly though. You can tell they put a lot of care into their service. However, the food was a disappointment for me.

Kind gentlemen serving water and generally assisting.  Very quiet, only 2 other groups dining.  Food was amazing!", "author": "Chelsey S."}

Failing to find an open non-vegan nice sit down place, we encountered the gem of an Italian restaurant, La Traviata.\n\nAlthough my plan thwarted, La Traviata was a delightful restaurant. We enjoyed prawns, pasta cabonara with chicken, lasagna (though it was a bit fallen over, it was delicious), salad, and a tiramisu (similarly fallen over).\n\nThe decor was very classic--photos of the opera, and the ambience quite traditional. We enjoyed the meal as well as the company.", "author": "Vicky J."}

The only reason I give it 4 starts instead of 5 is because I was hoping for a $24.00 plate I'd get a salad with my meal or a bigger portion,  although it was enough and I am full. I'm from fresno, and fresno does everything big! \nThe wine selection is pretty good and reasonably priced. The bread is AMAZING and they give you plenty  of it.  I tried each of my girlfriend's meals and they were equally delicious.  It is consistent and comfortable.  The owner is a hoot, the servers were delightful and prompt.  The food didn't take long to come out, but it tastes like they spent hours making it.  Great place to dine!", "author": "Alaine T."}

And over the years, we forgot this place existed...until last night I was DYING for some good, solid Italian food in the Mission, which is overrun by overpriced gastropubs featuring \"New American cuisine\" (read:  stuff you could easily make at home, like mac'n'cheese or chicken pate or a burger, but with tiny portions for massively-inflated prices to reflect their degree of \"foodie-ness\"!), but runs rather painfully light in the good-solid-Italian-food department (sorry, Beretta, you just don't serve the big plate of pasta my soul and stomach both desire!)!\n\nAnd then I remembered La Traviata!  Now, I was already in my pj's and therefore not about to leave the house...so the spouse ran to get take-out for us (what a mensch!).  Therefore, my review is based solely on the quality of the food, and NOT with the actual experience one might have of dining-in.\n\nI ordered the Lasagna, which was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  Very heavy on the meat and bechamel, it was a very reasonably-sized portion, and I was also pleased to find that the pasta wasn't overcooked.  \n\nI also ordered a side of Cheese Tortellini in Cream Sauce, just to see what their cream sauce is like...Mama Mia, it was absolutely fantastico!!!  Next time I dine there (which will be soon!), I'll probably be getting a full dinner portion of this dish!\n\nWe split a Caesar Salad, because, you know, vegetables..this may have been the one sort of \"eh\" part of the meal.  While the lettuce was the appropriate romaine, the dressing was not the creamy style I prefer;  rather, it was more like a vinaigrette with sizable chunks of anchovies (this part I didn't mind at all!)...and because the lettuce leaves were drenched in dressing, they were a bit on the soggy side.  Also, there didn't seem to be any croutons or shaved/shredded parmesan on top...so if those are essentials for you in enjoying a Caesar salad, that's something to note.\n\nI haven't tried it yet (I was too full last night), but the restaurant very sweetly gave us a complimentary order of Tiramisu with our order...what a generous gesture!  Hmmm, maybe that's what I should have for a mid-afternoon snack?!\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this meal and will definitely either dine-in or take-out from La Traviata again.  While it isn't the best Italian food in San Francisco (seriously, try Mona Lisa!!  Just do it!!!), it was definitely very tasty, and given the dearth of good Italian food in the Mission, I'd say there's a reason this restaurant has been around as long as it has!!", "author": "Amy L."}

The place is family owned and consists of one small room full of booths and a few tables. The walls are filled from head to toe with old framed photos of the family, previous guests and famous Opera singers. The whole place is based on the Italian opera \"La Traviata\" therefore all that is played in the background is Italian opera music. Each table is placed with fresh red roses... really overall just a beautiful ambiance! \n\nThe fresh warm bread brought at the beginning of your meal is so delicious - and extremely fresh. I brought my roomie here for her birthday so we split a bottle of the Chianti Classico which was light, refreshing and perfect to pair with our meal. She ordered the gnocci with pink sauce and I had the carbonara. Both dishes were good, but I've tried better of both dishes elsewhere in the city. We finished the meal off with Tiramisu which was pretty good, nothing extremely special. The food was all good, but just not the best Italian around.\n\nThe service was great for the first 75% of our experience. We ordered right away, dishes came out really fast and service was attentive. We had to take our time with dessert because all of our courses were served so quickly after another. At the end however, we had finished our bottle of wine and no plates were left in front of us and it took 25 minutes to get our bill! Literally there were only three groups of people left in the restaurant and nobody even bothered to check in with us. That was the most disappointing part.

Yes, it's a bit kitschy with the opera theme, and the menu's a bit on the simple & heavy side (they do have salad, but it's not their best menu item), but the service is always friendly and I've never had trouble getting a seat. In fact, I walked by for years without coming in because it looked so empty I thought it had to be a front for something... but now I think of it as a well-kept secret.\n\nBirthdays are also adorable here, as they play a recording of an operatic group singing \"Happy Birthday\" over the PA system for the entire restaurant to hear. \n\nDishes are $15-25/plate, and there are a lot of options to choose from. My favorite is the salmon baked in parchment paper (I think around $22), but be advised it's pretty much a la carte. It's a decent portion of salmon served with a few pieces of broccoli, which I tore through a recent evening while my date was still working on his lobster tail pasta special. If you're *really* hungry and choose this dish, I recommend sharing an appetizer (related: the fried mozzarella covered in marinara is probably the fanciest way you could serve mozzarella sticks). However, you don't need to worry about ordering appetizers or sides with any of the pasta dishes, which are larger but also lovely.\n\nFor being a few doors down from 24th St BART and on bustling Mission street, their entryway does a great job of blocking out the noise and making a quiet dining room atmosphere. Don't expect haute cuisine or fancy gastronomics, but for a well-prepared, comforting meal served by friendly people without waiting in line, this is a great spot.", "author": "Krista L."}

So we needed to go to bank to pull cash which I also think is something they should have mentioned over the phone so we could have prepared but nonetheless we found a bank within 5min walking distance. We proceeded to go pull cash and arrived back at the store around 9:25-9:30 still well within the time limit they gave us on the phone. As we walked in another man came up and told us we could not sit down to eat because the kitchen had been closed at this point after all the going around and mixed messages we left cause they refused to serve us even after I told them about the conversation over the phone they just didn't seem to care.

There was just a sitting room, so we decided to wait there for someone to come to us. It took a while but we finally checked in. Very disorganized. I mean, you should have someone writing names down, always. \n\nAnd then we waited..waited..and waited. People kept cutting us because everyone pushed their reservation back so we were seated after all of them. \n\nFinally, we got seated and were freaking starving. The first thing they bring out is their loaves of bread. Fresh and straight out of the oven. Burning hot and so damn good. But the butter, on the other hand is a frozen stick. How am I suppose to spread the butter when it's frozen! I know the hot bread would eventually melt down the butter, but it was hard for me to spread the butter nonetheless. Just give room temperature butter like all the other restaurants!\n\nFinally we ordered our food. And when we got it, I was kinda upset. I got the tortellini and I would give the overall dish 4 stars for the quality and flavor of it. But, they give the smallest portions in the world. I paid $14 for a pasta dish, and I swear I should have just paid half of that. That's how small the portions were. My friend got the gnocchi and she was upset as well because we got around the same size portions. \n\nMaybe because it was super late at night and they were running out of pasta. Or at least tell me if you don't have enough. It could be that they just want to fill us with bread because they do give a lot of bread in the beginning. \n\nDon't fool me.

However, this almost always ends in disappointment and this time was no exception. \n\nThe bread brought out at the beginning was very excellent. It came out piping hot and well made - soft and fluffy on the inside with a nice density, and fragrant and crispy on the outside. A bit of butter paved the way to an excellent start to the dinner. In anticipation, I looked forward to my entree. \n\nI went with the daily special of lamb chops on risotto over the safer pastas on their menu. To be completely honest, I have never had a risotto I was happy with prior to coming here. While the risotto at La Traviata was better than previous ones I've had at other restaurants, it still left much to be desired.  \n\nThe mushrooms in the risotto were tasty, but unfortunately did not penetrate the risotto as a whole. Most of the body was under-seasoned and very starchy. The flavors were very isolated and as a result were overwhelmed by the rice. \n\nThe lamb chops were cooked for way too long - they came to me medium well, destroying much of the flavor and texture of lamb. To be fair, I didn't specify the temperature when I ordered, so some of the fault does lie with me. The lamb was also under-seasoned - while the char came out well, there was almost no other flavor. No noticeable marinate nor spice rub. The only saving grace was that it wasn't gamey. \n\nOverall the quality of the food was very commonplace compared to other places - nothing special, but nothing horrible for the $24.95 entree. 3 stars for average.", "author": "Lee F."}

The interior of the restaurant is very romantic and perfect for a conversation with that special someone. There are also pictures of various people who have eaten at the restaurant. We got here right around 6:30 but not everyone showed up yet. The host was very patient with us and let us wait until more of our friends arrived before we caved in and started ordering appetizers because we were hungry. I think the place is family owned because it looks like the father and son are the ones running the restaurant and working with the cooks in the back. \n\nThe first thing that they give you is fresh bread. It is sooooo good and be careful because the bread is hot and will burn your hand. It is also hot enough to melt the butter they give you. They kept filling the basket of bread and I am so grateful they did because everyone loved it. \nFor appetizers we ordered the Calamari Vinaigrette and Antipasto Misto. I'm always a fan of the antipasto and I highly recommended ordering it here, you won't be let down by the various selections of meats and cheeses. For the main course I had the Tortellini and it was freshly made in the kitchen. It paired great with the Peroni beer. I also had a sample of the veal and it was cooked very well but my friend didn't like the wine sauce that it was sauteed with. I, on the other hand, thought it was fine.\n\nThe restaurant noise level is very quiet but our loud friend amped up the volume and made everyone else in the restaurant talk louder. Good thing nobody gave us the awkward stare or told us to quiet down. It was so funny because the volume went up every time he talked.\n\nWe told the hostess that it was our friend's birthday so you know the usual tradition when that happens. They dimmed the lights, played happy birthday on the stereo, and came out with a big slice of tiramisu cake for the birthday boy. We all got a taste of it so you can tell it's really big and I do recommend it for dessert. \n\nI don't normally give 5 stars but when I do, it's for exceptional and extraordinary service. La Traviata gets all the stars for their atmosphere, food, service and most importantly, the dining experience.", "author": "Tim G."}

It's the perfect date spot for couples looking for pasta without astronomical prices, snooty service or crazy wait times. My girlfriends and I enjoyed some classic Italian-American favorites like Linguine ai Funghi and Spaghetti Carbonara, both of which were delicious. The wine list was impressive and we split a bottle of Tuscan pinot grigio that didn't break the bank.\n\nThe really fun thing about the restaurant besides the kitschy decor is the fact that if it's your birthday, they like to do a good, ol' fashioned birthday singalong, complete with dimmed lights and loud voices. It's embarrassing and entertaining all at once. Oh, and the slice of tiramisu you're given is delicious and big enough to for 4 people to share.

The walls are filled with signed celebrity pics and cheesy Glamour Shots from days gone by. The d\u00e9cor is homey and cozy and there are a few booth style tables in the front, great for a date or a small party. The menu is simple but provides every Italian staple you can imagine from Parma Ham w/ Melon to Carbonara and Lasagna. When you step inside you could swear you were in a traditional ristorante on the East Coast. Decent wine selections. The restaurant is opera themed so you will hear some borderline cheesy operatic classics like Figaro, but the music is not intrusive. If you are into this sort of nostalgia and want some local Italian food, then you'll enjoy this place. If you are looking for a hip, modern era joint, this is not the restaurant for you.\n\nFood: 3 to 3.5 stars.\nWe ordered the Scaloppini al Funghi (veal, mushrooms w/ white wine sauce) and the Melanzane alla Vaness (layered eggplant parm). Both dishes were good and enjoyable and well portioned. However, the eggplant was a touch overcooked for our taste and the steamed vegetables were run of the mill and on the bland side. To be fair, it's exactly what you would expect from a time warp. The menu likely hasn't changed since they opened in 1973 and I kind of don't mind, anything else wouldn't make sense. Highlights are the bread, like everyone has mentioned and mushroom sauce. I would come back regardless, because I get the feeling all their dishes are good and they would rarely serve a bad meal.\n\nService/Atmosphere: 4 stars.\nServers were warm and respectfully attentive. They didn't try to sell us on anything or constantly check in, but they were there when you needed them and kept a watchful eye on the tables. Their strolling around the restaurant made for a nice background ambiance. Yes, they were a little aloof, but that's what you get at old school places and I like that level of service. \n\nNote: If someone in your party has a birthday, make sure to tell the staff. They have a cute little routine with the lights and music that is adorably hokey but fun. And there's cake with candles.\n\nPrice: 2.5 stars.\nKind of hating on the price, it's true, and it's probably a bit harsh. Problem is I can get some really fancy modern food around the corner for the same cost. Prices average around $9 appetizers,  $10 salads and $18 entrees. Two entrees and two glasses of wine will run you about a $50-$55 bill before tip.\n\nOverall, I would go back if I was in the area and wanted a nice Italian meal.", "author": "Sam S."}

It was so fresh butter melts right when you put it on the bread (I'd recommend putting pieces of butter between the slices and once it's cool it's perfect).\n\nI ordered the calamari al pomodoro.

These places can so easily slip through the cracks in a city that has more restaurants per capita than any other, and it is only growing. It is a sanctuary, it is living, backed by a story that I hope you come to know and understand from your experience there. I hope to see this place continue to thrive.\n\n A pasta craving led us to the nearest Italian eatery on Mission St. An un-assuming entryway gave way to one of the more charming dining experiences that I have had in this city for at least a few months. The interior walls are covered in a lovely collection of both family photos and those of great opera stars. The intricate ceiling is backed by a story just as interesting as the fixture itself. We came with a group of four and sipped on two bottles of the Vernaccia, why order something else when we enjoyed that bottle so much? The wine prices are super reasonable to boot. Hot, crunchy bread came to our table, and I felt that with the butter knives and pre-portioned butter, there was a particular focus on traditional dining etiquette supported here that made the experience only that much more memorable. The two servers that were managing the floor missed no detail, and were sweet as well as witty.\n\nWe ordered the Ceasar salad, which if you are looking for the classic super creamy stuff, I will advise that this salad does not meet that description. The dressing, while it still had delightful anchovy flavor, was more of a vinaigrette, which I was later grateful to have saved the extra calories for our pastas. We also shared the prosciutto and melon, a classic, I love it and you can expect no frills with this one. And finished our appetizers with the fried mozzarella with marinara, think mozzarella stick big enough for the table.. Great to share! Eat it fast tho, so the cheese stays nice and melty. \n\nWe each ordered a pasta for the main course. Two house made gnocchi, very soft and creamy in texture. One came with a pesto sauce, which sadly I didn't taste, and my choice came with the aurora (pink sauce.) The other two dishes were a hearty slice of house-made lasagna bolognese, again a very classic interpretation with not-too-big of a slab. The unanimous winning dish at our table was the pasta carbonara, in all it's creamy, pancetta glory. \n\nMy only critique about the savories, is that I felt that they were lacking in salt, but luckily that is something we easily fixed, of course. And still not worth \"losing a star\" for. \n\nWe closed the restaurant down, joined at the end only by John, the restaurants owner.

I also ordered a tasty glass of Montepulciano, & before I ordered it, the excellent server Lala brought 2 other tastes for me to try. What a great waitress! I ordered the chicken picattta. The white wine-caper sauce was excellent but the chicken had a rubbery consistency I didn't care for, but the savory lemon-caper sauce was so good I didn't care. If you are looking for authentic Italian outside North Besch try La Traviata. Apparently it's been here in the Mission for years. Which I love of course. It's not quite as good as Poesia in the Castro, but then again it's half the price.i also love it because it looks & feels like Italiani restaurants my parents took me to when I was a kid.

Each of us were only able to eat half and I felt really guilty for not being able to get it to go  (we were on vacation and our hotel didn't have a fridge.)\n\nMy only qualm with my experience here is that my friend and I both ordered a glass of the house wine and it was really bad. It tasted like an old shoe. We should have said something, but we didn't so that's on us, but I recommend getting one of the more expensive wines.\n\nI would definitely return.

It comes to your table piping hot.. it's so hard not to eat this stuff before your food comes, I like to put butter in the slices and let it melt. Drool! It's an amazing complement to all those leftover sauces that need to be soaked up and eaten! I mean,  who serves fresh bread anymore?! \n\nMoving on to the Eggplant Parmigiana. It's cheesy and delicious, the marinara is sweet and acidic and pairs well with the cheese and the eggplant -it melts in your mouth. I can't take a bite without doing the happy dance.\n\nThe Lasagna is hearty and delicious,  I don't crave Lasagna often but when I do this is the place to eat it, and it's HUGE. I know a lot of regulars that come here just for this.\n\nAll the seafood here is delicious and always fresh! (I'm a seafood snob) The Seafood Pasta and the Salmon in Parchment Paper are amongst my favorites.  (other patrons will look at your table in envy as the Salmon is lifted out of the steaming parchment paper table-side) \n\nThey have a great wine list.  Circue di Vin is my go to bottle.\n\nAnd I must not forget the friendly staff!

Probably ate too much of it as it kept coming-and he allowed me to have a fresh loaf (2) to take with my leftovers. We started with the fig salad and a bottle of white. Perfect balance. Shared the Funghi pasta and the Alla Beverly Sills. Both were absolutely fabulous. Pasta was al dente and so flavorful. Chicken was moist and juicy - wonderfully complimented by the stuffings. Finished up with the tiramisu. We couldn't finish it all but still wanted more. I live in New York and know Italian food. Their dishes rival any Italian restaurant I have dined in.

My eggplant was perfect - not slimy or oily, the skin wasn't tough, the breading did not separate from the eggplant - and the red sauce was very good, not sweet or acidic but perfectly balanced. My husband's dish had ample seafood - clams, mussels, calamari, scallops, etc - and the sauce was very good, not too liquidy as sometimes happens with seafood but not thick or gloppy either. \n\nFor dessert my husband had the tiramisu, a generous and lovely serving which he rated very tasty. My dessert was great - not exactly what I'd pictured based on the description but tasty, generous and rich none the less - profiteroles in chocolate mousse (the menu simply said \"chocolate\" so the mousse was a surprise) with ample dollops of whipped cream.\n\nThe prices were very reasonable, the water refills prompt and the service outstanding, all on top of just really good tasting food.", "author": "Emily G."}

Went there on a date & not only are the staff so utterly delightful, but the food is incredible & really reasonable. I ordered the carbonara & asked for it to come with Italian sausage, which was so rich & flavoursome & delicious. My date had the lasagna which was equally gorgeous ; perfectly cooked; melt-in-the mouth delicious & the wine the waiter recommended went with it perfectly. Even the bread is amazing, & the profiteroles are so light with the most sinfully delicious chocolate, they're a must! The atmosphere of the place is lovely; it's low-key & not too formal that it's intimidating, but great Italian music and roses on the tables. Can't recommend more.

This once-awesome secret Italian delight has suffered horrifically in the past couple of years. The service and the food are unrecognizable, and worse, inexcusable. The one redeeming feature is an amazingly great caesar salad, almost worth its $9 price.\n\nFirst: the service. One not very charming waitress for the entire restaurant. Same waitress we had bad service from a year prior. The older guy with almost all of his teeth filled our water glasses and tossed a plate of butter on the table when we arrived, but failed to bring bread. When we asked for bread, he brought it, and then yanked a loaf out of the basket and fondled it in his palm to show us it wasn't too hot to touch. Yeah, please dont put your big paws on my food? Does that actually have to be something you ask your wait staff not to do?\n\nWe ordered the caesar, antipasti misto, the bass entree and an old fave of mine, the a la beverly sills (chicken with prosciutto in a wine caper sauce). The antipasti was not fresh - it had clearly sat out for some time and the meat was dried at the edges. It was also obviously from a package. The cheeses were clearly pre-sliced provolone and mozarella from a jar, and flavorless. To cap it, the entire contents of the plate were floating in flavorless olive oil. \n\nOur meals came with small pre-plates of tortellini. zero effort at plating, and one plate had twice the pasta and sauce as the other. Oh, and the pasta tasted suspiciously, no, *convincingly*, like Lucca Deli's down the street's cheese tortellini and marinara sauce.\n\nThe bass, we were informed, was not actually bass but some other fish I've never heard of, but when it came out it looked and tasted a whole lot like cheap tilapia. It was breaded and drowned in a wine-caper sauce. My date ate two bites and decided she wasn't hungry any more.\n\nThe a la beverly sills ... sigh. The chicken breasts were cooked perfectly, but they were stuffed with what appeared to be raw american bacon. RAW. Not prosciutto. Did I mention it was raw? Beverly, rest her soul, would be affronted.\n\nMost deflating is to discover that the italian chefs who used to populate the kitchen and venture onto the floor to generously chat with patrons are all gone. All that is left are local line cooks trying to churn out food they have no feel for. \n\nWe spoke to the maitre d, and he comped our uneaten entrees, to his credit. We tipped on the full amount, making it $30 for a salad, a few Safeway coldcuts, 5 Lucca tortellini apiece, and a $5.75(!)  bottled beer each. \n\nNormally I'd want to give them a break in this economy, where everyone is struggling. EXCEPT - the place was inexplicably packed. They are not suffering for clientele, so I wonder if they are just investing less in the food and service and increasing their margins.\n\nJust sad to see a great place lose its soul and its dignity.", "author": "Brooke B."}

We were seated after waiting a couple of minutes, and then given our utensils then the menu to choose. I was somewhat disappointed in the menu only because I expected more to choose from, there was only about one small side of food and the rest were wine and drinks.\n\nSo we waited for our food, while enjoying some fresh bread and a glass of Merlot, and it didn't take long for it to arrive. The food was alright, I enjoyed my salmon and pasta, and my boyfriend seemed to enjoy his chicken. The service was friendly, considering there was only one female waitress bustling from table to table, and I give her props. She even ran after me outside when I forgot my lipstick on the table! We got a reasonable bill, nothing too expensive, and all in all it was a nice dinner but I probably wouldn't be coming back again.", "author": "Ludieann S."}

The beauty of this place is that I really have nothing to complain about. \n\nThe food quality and flavor is excellent. The service is friendly, fast and not pushy.  The atmosphere is charming and tasteful.  I have eaten here twice, and I have to say that this is the best Italian food that I have had in San Francisco.  \n\nI had a salad, lasagna and dessert.  The salad was a mixed greens with figs and goat cheese with a balsamic reduction dressing.  The goat cheese was lovely and mellow and the dressing just right.  The lasagna was wonderful.  It was of appropriate size and was not ramped up with silly \"extra\" ingredients like some places like to do.  It was just simple, as it should be.  No tricks, just lasagna.  The panna cotta for dessert, which was as smooth and delicious as one could hope for.\n\nThis is a little hidden gem in the Mission and I will be back again and so should you.", "author": "Scott A."}

Oh how I hope to see the day when Yelp comes up w/ half stars! \n\nLa Traviata is cozy and romantic. It's a cute little place located right along Mission & 25th-and definitely quite a change of scenery from the busy and bustling street it sits on.\n\nThe only way to write this particular review is in Pros and Cons:\n\nPros:\n\n- The warm, doughy, straight-from-the oven, bread. Its delicious- and almost melts in your mouth.\n- The red marina sauce- fantastic! I hate chunky tomato sauces, and this one is smooth and flavorful!\n- The Beverly Sills Chicken. Tender, moist, flavorful, and oh so yummy! I would come back to La Traviata just for this dish!\n\nCons:\n- The night we went I spent the whole meal slightly chilled. When I asked my boyfriend if he thought it was cold, and he said YES, I knew it wasn't just me. (The man is never cold!)\n- One of the servers had terrible, terrible, body odor. It detracts from a nice meal.\n- With the exception of my chicken, none of the food, as a whole, \"wowed\" me. If I'm going to go back somewhere for Italian food- Firenze by Night still gets my vote!\n\nREALLY CUTE MOMENT: Two people in the restaurant were celebrating a birthday. At the end of the meal, they turned down the lights, played a opera-esque Happy Birthday song over the speakers, and brought the guests tiramasu with a lit candle. The whole restaurant clapped and wished them happy birthday. It was certainly a special customer service touch. :)", "author": "Annalise F."}

I've been to lots of different restaurants in SF, at all different price ranges, and this one stands out for two reasons. \n\n1. The food is great. I got the Tortellini with Aurora sauce, which is a pretty safe bet. The sauce is creamy and packed full of flavor. The fried mozzerella is amazing, and the Calamari in Ink Sauce was pretty unique, albeit a little fishy for my taste. \n\n2. The service and authentic feel here was awesome. The owner (who was our server) is extremely personable. I came in right when the restaurant opened and he and the cooks were sitting around at a table chatting in Italian. He got up and immediately attended to us. A couple came in after us. The woman had forgotten her glasses so she was having trouble reading the menu. Moments later I see the owner walking out, wiping off the glasses which he had taken off his own face to loan to her to read the menu. \n\nI've been here twice and I know I'll be back for more.

La Traviata has a great family owned feel to it - small, non-pretentious, and service is all provided by a staff who looks like family and friends. \n\nWhile I was here, I ordered the Alla Ricciarelli, which was a pasta dish consisting of chicken breast, caramelized onions, and cream sauce - yum, one of my favorite types of pasta dishes. The pasta was great - fresh, texture, taste and sauce was also very delicious.\n\nService was a bit slow the night we came, but I wont complain since we had a large group and they let us sit down even though half of our party showed up really late.

This place is so much bigger inside, with a very nice decor. The insides make you feel like you are in a small family-owned restaurant in Italy. It was like a spell. For one hour, I seriously thought I was not in the Mission! or San Francisco! \n\nThere are only 2 workers. Very nice old gentlemen. From the looks of it, it's a father-son gig. \n\nWe sat down and waited kind of long for the bread, but it was totally worth it because it was fresh, pipping hot, and homemade bread. Delivered straight to our table from their kitchen. It was the BEST BREAD & BUTTER I have ever tasted in my whole life! (plus when we said we wanted to take it home, he kindly wrapped it and gave us extra!! chyea) \n\nThe food was nothing less than excellent! \n\nMy favorite is their special Pasta di Mare with white cream sauce. I expected only to finish half of it cause I don't usually like creamy that much. WRONG AGAIN. Their cream sauce is creamy yet not sickeningly. everything is just right!!! \n\nand just when is everything just right?! But this place somehow did it! \n\nIf you want to impress a friend, date, boss, or whatever complicated thing you are in, take them here! Your night will be better!

I've written over 100 reviews and have only given one 1-star review and one 2-star review.  The rest have all been 3's, 4's and 5's.  \n\nBasically it takes A LOT for me to post something negative.  \n\nThis place would've probably received one less star if it weren't for the food, which was actually good.  \n\nI've worked in the restaurant industry (and in many service positions) and no matter how slammed you are, the cardinal rule in a venue that serves food is to acknowledge your table and check in whenever possible.  Especially in a small square layout of a restaurant where it's very easy to spot any table and see your patrons. \n\nHow our night went: \n\nHost (who was friendly) greeted us and asked us if we had a reservation.  We said no.  Told us wait would be 15 minutes.  We said that's fine.\n\nSo far ok, not a problem.\n\nFifteen minutes later we get seated.  \n\nStill things are alright.\n\nServer takes a really long time to get to us.  Understandably, b/c looked like there were only 2 waitstaff in the entire place.  She apologizes for the delay in getting to us and takes our order.\n\nAt this point, we're still alright.\n\nLooooooong time goes by.\n\nWe get water.\n\nLoooooooooooong time goes by.  \n\nWe get bread.\n\nTable next to us, also equally ignored, does not have salt at their table and since our server is no where to be seen, asks us if they can borrow ours.\n\nWe FINALLY get our food.  At this point we've gone through our bread basket and I ask for another one.  \n\nI think our server forgot b/c again a looooooong time goes by and we don't get it.  I then ask the only other server around if we can get bread.  \n\nAgain some more time passes (do you see a pattern here?) and we still have no bread basket.  At this point I'm already 2/3 done with my dish.  The point of asking for the bread was to dip the bread in the pesto sauce that came w/my gnocchi.  \n\nSecond basket of bread finally shows itself.\n\nBy now, me and my friend are tired and ready to go home.  It's already been over 90 minutes, and for a party of two, it's lengthy.  Especially considering all we ordered was one soup and two entrees.  We didn't order any drinks or dessert.    \n\nAgain, no sign of any server.  Try several times, as we had for the bread basket, to flag someone to our table, to ask for the check, but we continue to be COMPLETELY ignored.  We were at the point of just leaving cash on our table and walking out the door when our waitress, who has still ignored us, starts to take orders  from the table next to ours (not the table that asked for our salt, but the table on our other side), and then we're, 2 hours later, able to pin her down to get our check.\n\nThe service was not unfriendly, just non-exsistent.\n\nIf you have a lot of time, you will probably be ok with La Traviata, b/c as I said before, food's good.  But if you're like me, and would appreciate some form of service and not want to spend 2 hours in a restaurant for a simple meal, then I would definitely not go to this restaurant on a Saturday night.", "author": "Swetha G."}

Walked into a couple of restaurants by the help of yelp but unfortunately the wait was too long for impatient stomaches. We stop by Phat Phillies restaurant to say hi to his friends. One of them recommended La Triviata and boy did we hurry there (at this point we were starving). The entrance was really low key and a little endearing. Walked into a cute little waiting area where you can sit down and look at the menu until they seat you. \"Table for two?\" Said the kind host and then he proceeded to seat us onto a table. All I see around me are painting and photos of what seems to be family, mixed with cultural art. So beautiful. The waiter came to take our order but I had a couple of questions about the menu and he answered all of them with an assurance that he understood my question trying to answer it as best as he could. The service was amazing and the food came quick! Okay, here we go. THE FOOD- let me just say I'm a hint of Italian so it explains my weekly craving for the delicacies and I've had my fair share of Italian cuisine. This place, by far, hands down has one of the best, tender cooked chicken I've ever had with some bomb pasta and the creamiest sauce exploded in my mouth. Accompanied by La Rossa of course, woah party. Ah, satisfied but sadly too full to try dessert, thank God for next time. My favorite part is that it's not too loud in there. Everyone respects the quiet atmosphere. Great service, great food! What more can you ask for!

Cherise recommended this place to us, as she used to live just upstairs from the dining room.  \n\nI guess I never went in there because I was wary of the one Italian restaurant in the Mission!  When I entered the restaurant, I was immediately overcome with the feeling of being in the dining room of an old Italian couple!  There was a very inviting ambiance and the servers were super friendly.  \n\nNow onto the food...OOOHHH THE FOOD!  Well, I knew, based on the environment, that the food would be more extravagant than simple spaghetti and meatballs, but to say the food was 'better' would be a gross understatement.  I ordered the \"Chicken Beverly Sills\"...This dish was named after the famous Opera singer who ordered this dish regularly on her visits to this 38 year old restaurant.  My boyfriend had the Chicken Fiorentina...another amazing dish.  They have specials regularly that will make your mouth water at their mere mention!  \n\nMy boyfriend and I came back with his parents and little brother 2 days later and tried a few more items on the menu...the salmon and the panna cotta dessert are my personal recommendations, but everything thus far is simply delectable. \n\nSo, if you find yourself in the Mission, and want to treat yourself to an amazing, home style Italian meal, head to La Traviata between 24th and 25th streets.

Then one hungry night, thanks to Yelp, I realized I was living practically on the same block as la Traviata and had never even noticed it was there! \n\nThe interior is dark and lovely...photos of great singers and staged operas cover the walls. There is a small but attentive waitstaff...they seemed a little flustered the night we came in, and I got the feeling maybe they were down one person that night. I guess I took one star off just for feeling a little rushed through the whole dining process. But then, the food...\n\nFirst, the warm crusty bread. I was eating it and it tasted so good it felt like sinning. I looked at my handsome boyfriend from over top of my last crusty bite of bread and wondered if maybe I loved that bite more than him...\n\nEverything else was delicious too...we ordered a seafood pasta and raviolli in tomato sauce.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-02-24", "description": "This used to be my favorite place to take visitors from out of town, and the occasional in-town friend or date who has never heard of it. I will not be returning. Apparently, there's been a change in staffing, and the new folks have no idea what they are doing. \n\nOn a recent weeknight, with the place half empty, my friend CONSUMED all of his courses twenty minutes (and two or three inquiries)  before I even RECEIVED my first course. I ordered the salmon, which I had ordered many times there before, so i knew it did not take two hours to prepare. \n\nI told the waiter upon arrival that I was starving. We both told him to bring the food \"as it is ready\". Another guy (waiter? host? busboy? manager? One never knows at this place) also waited on our table, which seemed to only confuse matters. The two of them wasted way too much time making pleasantries rather than attending to our basic need: for food. After I had eaten half the bread basket while waiting for my meal, the waiter asked, with obvious expectations of a positive response, \"Do you feel better, now that you have filled up on bread?\" I wanted to reply, \"I will feel better when my dinner gets here,\" but I bit my tongue. \n\nI watched my friend eat his first course as I gnawed on bread and talked. Then they brought his second course, and I kept looking up expectantly, waiting for mine. Everyone else in the restaurant was getting their food except me. \n\nI asked three times about my entree. Finally, one of the waiters said he would get it right away. Apparently that was when he put the order in, for I waited another 30 to 40 minutes before it was finally brought to me. \n\nThe two gentlemen appeared to have no idea that anything was wrong with the way in which they served our table. I caught the attention of a third server when I was giving up hope of ever seeing my food, and she later told me that she asked the first two what had happened with my order. They explained to her that my order came so late because it was an entree, and therefore must not come until the appetizers, soups, and pastas had been consumed. They did not even consider that the appetizers and soup were being consumed  solely by my friend, and that he had not ordered an entree. They did not consider that I was sitting there, foodless for two hours after having informed them of  my hunger, while my friend ate. They did not consider that my friend then had to sit there, having completed his dinner, and watch ME eat. \n\nMy food was cold and tasteless by the time it arrived. The salmon had a fishy taste not usually found in salmon. This meal was most certainly not worth the wait. \n\nIn a city teeming with skilled servers, many of whom are probably un- or under-employed, it's incredible that La Traviata chose to hire Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee. The main idea of service at this restaurant appears to be 1. smile constantly and act as if your customers are delighted, even when it's obvious that they are not, 2. spend a lot of time conversing with customers, and 3. don't worry about the food, because probably your customers have eaten before they arrived.", "author": "Ange R."}

Our carb of choice was rice.  Until I left Jersey I thought Italian food was Chef Boyardee (which scared me because it smelled like socks and looked like bloodnguts).\n\nThe dr. and I walked in late on a Sunday night and the place was pleasantly lit, cozy and somewhat quiet with a handful of small parties left in the dining room which was covered in framed pictures of famous opera singers.\n\nIf this was Jersey, there would be red and white checkered vinyl tablecloths.\n\nBut it's the Mission.\n\nWait.  It's the Mission!\n\nMy head in all sorts of ethnic confusion I expected burritos and spaghetti.  \n\nI was wrong.  The menu was your standard Italian fare.  I went for the gnocchi (red) since it has been awhile since I've had it and the dr. went for the fungus.\n\nI'm with fellow yelpers, why is the bread burn-your-face-off hot?\n\nI ate it anyway in honor of no carb left behind.  Everyone I know seems to be on the Atkins diet. I eat my white flours discreetly and try not to tell them I've been consuming more then 20g a day.\n\nFood came and I refrained from scarfing it down.  It took some time to figure out what the interesting taste was in my gnocchi til in a moment of genius the dr. came up with nutmeg and the lightbulb came over my head too.  Ooooh, nutmeg.\n\nYou could tell the little dumplings were made from scratch which was awesome.\n\nThe lights went out in the dining room while they embarassed the birthday girl at one of the tables with an operatic version of the bday song.\n\nThe dr. and I lingered at our table for awhile awash in that glucose glow.  I like that when I reach across the table, he does too.\n\nWe walked out to a very sincere goodnight by the staff and I left feeling pretty warm and fuzzy despite not partaking of any wine.  \n\n4 stars for the experience and the atmosphere.

I want it to be my little secret.\n\nI had out of town guests from Norway wanting to get Italian food. They wanted to get something at Fisherman's Wharf. My response to them was, tell me where you are, and I'll come pick you up and take you somewhere good. (i.e. not at Fisherman's Wharf)\n\nOriginally, I was going to go to Delfina, until I was told that it's a 4 week reservation wait for prime time spots. Screw that. My preference is always to go to places not packed. There's a myth that all the good places are packed. Certainly, lots of places are packed because they are good, but the packed places have no monopoly by any means.  There's plenty of diamond in the rough in this town, and La Traviata, being right by the 24th and Mission BART station on Mission no less, is certainly in the rough. After dining there, I can say, that it is certainly a diamond as well.\n\nWell, my Norwegian friends called me back, sounding a bit frazzled. \"There's lots of people riding on bikes, and everyone is crazy and shouting!\"  Then I realized, that today is Critical Mass, and there was no way in hell I was going to drive anywhere. Fortunately, they never made it to Fisherman's Wharf and was at the Embarcadero. Quick hop on the BART, and quickly walking past some raucous homeless people,  they were there before you could say Luciano Pavarotti.\n\nDuring and after the dinner, the consensus around the table was an enthusiastic thumbs up. Tortellini with white sauce, with red sauce, veal, chicken, spaghetti ai funghi, minestrone, carpaccio, Bruschetta, tiramisu, creme carmel, espresso, chianti classico. All superb!\n\nMy 10 year-old son accompanied me as well, and the waiter was very accommodating. He offered to add a side of angel hair pasta and marinara sauce on the side as insurance in case the veal was not up to the young man's standards. Smart man! The insurance wasn't needed, but was fully utilized. The plate was the first one empty.\n\nThe ambiance is cozy, wait staff is friendly and helpful. They are not as \"polished\" as the popular places, and sure they aren't the quickest, but, you don't go here for polish or to get a quick bite. You come here to sit, talk, laugh, enjoy the food, let the wine soak into your soul. When you are full is when you are full, when you leave is when you leave. My 10 year-old has not adopted my philosophy however, so he took the liberties of tracking down the waiter to hand him the card. Kids these days. Back in my day Italian food meant Chef-boyardee, and we liked it!\n\nGreat date place. Great friends place. Will come again definitely!", "author": "Boris C."}

They've been there for 35 years, so they've seen the neighborhood change, but you can tell they haven't changed much.  The food is soooo freekin good.  Melt in your mouth goodness, I tell you.  UH!  They serve until about 10pm on the weekdays.  Ruy was our server, and did a fabulous job, even gave us free flan at the end of our meal!!  So good. So good. Sooooo good.", "author": "Kelly H."}

As he sat me and my girlfriends at a cozy booth, our waiter asked \"Did you hear about the earthquake?\" We were like \"WHAT?!?\" He said, \"Well, 3 angels just felt out of the sky.\" Rather amusing, and a pleasant beginning to our evening. That's the strange thing about cheesy pickup lines. If they're directed at a group, they are funny and charming. But at one person, they are obnoxious.\n\nLa Traviata, as many other reviewers have pointed out, is smack dab in the heart of the Mission. It's a rather unexpected locale, especially when you walk into the richly decorated foyer. The dining room is adorned with photos of opera divas, past and present.\n\nFirst, they serve hot bread. I mean HOT BREAD. The butter melts right into it. It's hard not to just scarf it all down. I maintained my discipline so I could eat the actual meal. I started with the Caesar salad, which I'm afraid to say was somewhat disappointing. The lettuce was crisp and fresh, but the dressing was anchovy overkill. I love me some anchovy-y Caesar dressing, but this was ridiculous. It was like anchovies pureed and poured over romaine. Not really my cup of tea. I couldn't even finish half of it. For my main course, I had the tortellini soup. It contained about 20 or so pieces of tortellini in a light chicken brodo. It was decent. Not bad, but not super memorable.\n\nAlthough I felt lukewarm about my food, my fellow diners seemed to enjoy their dishes very much, and due to the friendly service and cute vibe of the place, I round my rating up to 4 stars.", "author": "Jill M."}

We were told that their menu was limited that night because they ran out of other dishes. Our choices were: chicken breast, veal and salmon with a caper sauce. Period. Compared to the large menu they advertise on their website, this was a bit disconcerting. And our reservation was 7pm, so I also found it very odd that they ran out of all of the other dishes by that point in the evening. As I dislike white meat and am morally opposed to veal, I ordered the salmon (despite my dislike of capers). The food was edible (my bf had the veal and said it wasn't anything special), but definitely nowhere near 4 stars.

The occasional papered-over store front, the catcalls,  the overhanging utility wires, the scavengers rummaging around for spare cans and bottles, well this block could be anywhere in America. As I pick up the sounds of a distant mariachi band, I'm reminded that I'm in the Mission and passing the infamous La Taqueria. \n\nInstead, I veer into an oft passed-by doorway that leads to a waiting room that envelopes me in a Jersey Grandma aesthetic. Old school furniture, fake ivy plants, and pink and burgundy accents funnel me toward the dining room where my companion awaits my arrival and faint opera music cancels out any memory of the brassy mariachi band. La Traviata is deeply steeped in the old school style and serves comforting, cheese heavy, American Italian dishes that match the decor.\n\nOne can find a decent meal on the menu by sticking to breaded meats (chicken, veal ($16.95), etc) or eggplant blanketed in melted mozzarella and some of the house pastas (~$10-12). Gnocchi ($11.95) were less successful and down right mushy. Not totally unpleasant, but not the feathery light dumplings touted by the modern Cal-Ital kitchens about town. Rosy pink garlic, cream, and tomato aurora sauce did what it could to save the large dumplings, but couldn't hide their overcooked state.\n\nThe wine list is concise and provides easy drinking varietals that go down easy. Thick, stubby, balloon style stemware adds to the feeling that you're at your Jersey aunt/Grandma's house. Service is friendly and checks back often enough to see how things are going.

Everyone must try the cheese tortellini, that with each bite you want to slowly enjoy every cream filling every tasty morsel is Devinne. I would call it Og.... isc but i think that of every dish i have tried there and nothing has come close. \n\nI'm getting ahead of myself for appetizer, must try the walnut, Gorgonzola cheese salad with a honey vinaigrette. Its truly refreshing and light, excellent partner for your main entree.   \nAnother dish that is a must try (again come here more than once you will not be disappointed!) i the Gnocchi, I have never had potato dumplings that melt in your mouth.  When you put one in your mouth you are consumed by the richness of the sauce on the outside but once you bite in you just taste the softness, salivating texture and mouthwatering scrumptious the potato dumplings will be.  Two distinct tastes with one bite!\n\nYou will get your money's worth with each delicious meal. It's not just a meal its an experience.  \n\nThis is a must try!", "author": "Jac J."}

FOOD IS NEEDED!  While walking down Mission towards our home we were trying to decide where to eat when \"hey what about that little Italian place?\".  So that's where we ended up.\n\nWe opened the door and stood there like a deer in headlights for a moment wondering if we were to be seated... when a gentleman from the kitchen waves us in with a big smile and points and says 'here sit'.  So we do.\n\nNext it was the hot bread..menus and 'what would you like to drink?. We ordered the Barbera (forgot who by and vintage...but who cares) because it was deliciously gooood wine.  We ordered the appetizer special Stuff Portabello Mushroom and the Melon and Proscuitto then for our mains I ordered Al Funghi Pasta and my friend had the Gnocchi in Vodka Cream sauce.  If the restaurant had been quieter you would have heard the two girls at that table having multiple orgasms.  \n\nThen it was dessert time...our friendly waiter suggested the Tiramisu and OMG...another orgasm or two was heard.  We gobbled that down in seconds and sat back to finish our wine when I said 'you have any Biscotti?'...and to our surprise our other friendly waitperson brought out a plate of, what seemed to be fresh baked, Biscotti. If it wasn't it could have been from just across the street at Dianda's (yummy bakery). After one more plate of Biscotti and our wine finally finished...we paid our bill, excitedly said over and over, THANKS THANKS THANKS .. that's the best Italian we've had in a long time.  \n\nNo more words needed except 'EAT AT LA TRAVIATA FOR THE FOOD, THE SERVICE  ..

It feels like a location warp and a time warp, but not awkwardly so. They take a lot of pride in their restaurant. \n\nFood: The ceasar is tangy and good. The bread is freshly baked and actually quite light. This is a butter not olive oil place, and the butter comes in scooped out balls, just like at the dinner houses my parents used to take me to. There's a selection of meatless pasta which are very tasty (and meat ones, too, of course). The chicken dishes that you have to wait for are rather good, too, and we've tried both. They are very concerned that you order these on time. The one weakness we discovered is the gnocci; skip it here and go to Il Borgo or Capri for gnocci. \n\nHave not tried the desserts yet but the comp birthday Tiramisu is only so-so. \n\nI like the opera music as it's different, relaxing and not intrusive. I like all the kitshy photos. I like that we always have a waiter, who I think is French, at this Italian joint in the Mish.

The noise from an opera track and several groups of patrons remained at a low enough volume for conversations within our party to be easily heard.

The waiters were as friendly as Dean had described, very warm and welcoming and accomodating, even when Dean got drunk and shouted abuse at them (okay, I exaggerate: Dean is always as polite as can be, but it was really funny when the waiter asked if he could help us with our wine choice and Dean said \"No!  She knows what she's doing!\" which made me feel all important and Italian and conoisseur-y (and then of course I picked the wrong wine and the patient waiter gave us a better suggestion). \nThird star, of course, was for the food, which was tasty and plentiful. My minestrone was, first of all, hot (thank you for providing the obvious, and not falling prey to that dumbing down of soups for fear of horrible litigious assholes who will sue you if they burn their tongues with the soup, like their mammas never told them to blow first--and getcha minds out of the gutter).\nMy entree, the sausage pasta (do I sense  a theme here?) was very yummy: the sausage had been crumbled and was dotted with fresh parsley and garlic...the pasta was appropriately chewy and dense, and the sauce was spicy and satisfying.\nDean loved his salmon en papillote, which looked magnificent (he offered me some but I was too busy stuffing my face with the pasta).\nFourth star was for being there with Dean, who is the most charming and loquacious of hosts (even though he told me his throat was hurting and that I'd have to do most of the talking, we ended up covering the gamut from love to politics to health to books to movies to life to crushes to bodies to people to gossip...and I must say that the intimate ambience of La Traviata helped fuel our non-stoppiness).\nBy the time we left the restaurant was packed with a very interesting assortment of people: old, young, oldstyle, newstyle.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-04-15", "description": "WARNING:  This review is about to get all E. Coast authoritative on Italian-American restaurants. I understand this is off-putting to many, but honestly, I cannot take another review where the atmosphere is described as \"50's kitch.\" (Oh, madonn!) Maybe that's what this place is reduced to in CA . . . and for you, I weep.\n\nListen bitches, I'm from Dirty Jersey, North Jersey to be exact, (and no, we do not say JOISEY, even motherfuckin Tony Soprano does not say JOISEY). I grew up eating at Italian-American (WHICH IS DISTINCT FROM ITALIAN)  restaurants in Newark and surrounding burbs. The kind of places where there is always at least one table of 6 morbidly obese men in ridiculous suits.  This means, that I get deeply concerned when someone in San Fran-fucking-cisco claims to have eaten at an authentic Italian-American place.   I will give some, very slight leeway if the place is in North Beach . . . because the good places generally get the food right,  but they almost ALWAYS screw up the atmosphere. You either get 1) red and white checked table cloths and \"family style service\" - I don't know what the fuck that is, but if my ass wants gnocchi and Jimmy wants Carbonara, and Mikey wants Veal Piccata, that just ain't going to cut it 2) ridiculously stylized places with perky waitstaff  and WAY, WAY too much light - i.e. Italian food goes to California (which by the way is fine when you're up for that, I am a big fan of the Delfina's of the world, but when the Italian uncles are in town I tend to Identify these places as Italian-California or the better ones \"Italian -Italy Coastal\"  but NEVER would I call any of these places Italian-American. \n\nLa Traviata on the other hand, gets it right, down to the fake single rose on all the tables.  It has a cave like layout and a sitting area which separated from the dinning room by a perfectly tacky stained glass window set in wood. Its white table cloth (of course!), and  the service is perfect:  two man tag team, one older and one younger (son, brother, cousin?), both tremendously gracious in that slightly overstated way.  I'd have given the place five stars before I ate a thing.  I was home.\n\nSome notes on Italian-AMERICAN food, because a few people have missed this distinction (and hey you just might not like it, and that's cool), there is absolutely no subtlety involved. it should be heavy garlic on garlic and the portions should be large (if you have to add salt, they've done soemthing wrong). . . what is unacceptable in this medium is overcooked pasta, bland sauces, crappy seafood and a holier than thou attitude. SO, they lost a star on my Gnocchi, it wasn't firm enough.  The Bruchetta was very good, my date's pasta did not disappoint, (I tend not to comment on Caprese unless something goes wrong because I think that's pretty hard to screw up - and they didn't).  The tiramasu was surprisingly good (I always order tiramasu with trepidation because I've seen it interpreted in some bizarre ways). \n\nI will absolutely go back.  For one app, one salad,  two pastas, a bottle  of wine, desert and a glass of 20yr port with tip it was around $100 - which is about right.", "author": "Jen A."}

The ambiance is old-school Italian without being overly affected. One wall is covered with opera photos and portraits. The lighting is dark, with white tablecloths and napkins and faded maroon velour banquettes. Opera or Italian favorites like \"It's Amore\" play in the background.\n\nThe cushion I sat on had collapsed springs (booth closest to the door) but overall, the place had a family feel.\n\nThe little bread loaf was hot- don't know why people are bitching about the temp- just let it cool down! It allows the butter to melt. The table after me didn't get butter- the waiter told them the kitchen had run out- but didn't suggest or bring out olive oil and vinegar.\n\nThe spaghetti al funghi was good- slightly peppery, not superbland like Pomodoro. I would have appreciated freshly ground Parmesan instead of having it spooned from a bowl.\n\nThe waiter was friendly even though I was eating by myself. I had really wanted a meat sauce and pasta (and I dislike sausage, which was the other meat/pasta option). I wish there was a better variety of meat pasta options.\n\nThe waiter called me from the door of the restaurant when he saw I'd forgotten my bag of bread.

Turns out it was only two minutes from my front door, only it was hiding under some obscure facade. Luckily I was invited to  a birthday dinner at La Traviata, and now I will forever have my \"go-to-fancy-dinner-with-boyfriend on a whim\" restaurant. The atmosphere is inviting and romantic, yet fun. The waiters (or owners?) are very friendly and cracking jokes in their heavy Italian accents, while helpfully providing menu suggestions. One of the people I was eating with recommended the Salmon in Parchment, as she says she orders this every time she eats there, and so I ordered it. What presentation!! It came in this crazy puffed enclosure, which the waiter then removed it from, and placed it on my plate. It was delicious. My bf had fish cooked-picata style (can't remember the kind of fish)  and it was just as tasty. Great wine, great appetizers.\nYou can definitely spend some money here though. We paid $45 per person, which is not something I would do on a daily basis. That is the reason for only four stars.", "author": "Cyrelle D."}

The first thing that came were these side dishes, basically small plates of very addictive tortellini in either red (my preference), or white cream sauce (a bit too rich for my tastes). I ate every last one of the tortelini and eagerly awaited my dish. The salmon arrived on a large platter, as promised, wrapped in parchment, and the waited cut it open and poured the salmon and associated marinate into my plate.

While I can commiserate with SG's bad experience, there were a few extenuating circumstances that were probably unknown to her.  First, at the time of her visit, the proprietor was in Albania attending the funeral of his mother.  Ergo, the restaurant was in the hands of subordinates.  Second, the waitress who served SG was a new hire who was new to waitressing.  Nobody should have to endure what SG endured.  However, I eat two meals a day in restaurants, and have for the past 17 years.  I probably have eaten more meals in restaurants than the current team of professional critics.  In fact, I have eaten at more than half of what Michael Bauer considers to be the top 100 San Francisco restaurants.  I have visited La Traviata on a somewhat regular basis since it opened in the late 70's.  If I were condemned to eat all of my meals in a single restaurant for the rest of my life, I would choose La Traviata (in spite of its location).  That's saying a bunch, given all the meals I've eaten at all the fancy restaurants I've visited.  The place is romantic; the music (opera) is great; the food is tasty, though not Italian gourmet; and the service is typically friendly, charming and adequately prompt.", "author": "RovingGourmand I."}

The entire neighborhood is Latino, there are street people camped out right next door, gang bangers fronting not 30 feet away, and seemingly on ever other corner the birth,staving off death,then death of trendy restaurants plays itself out. And yet, it thrives. Step inside and leaving behind bootleg DVD salesmen and Pentecostal doomsayers and you enter an oasis of genteel manners and calm. Unhurried, unrushed, and trend-proof.  The food is thoroughly excellent, if not innovative - why mess with a menu that sparkles? They do all the traditional dishes, and I don't think you can go wrong. I am particularly a fan of their Puttanesca  - But I also love La Traviata for the considerate staff, the fact that on any night you can find an open table, and the ease with which you are transported to a place of civility, where once again I am hopeful about life and the world.", "author": "Nick S."}

Although the place had nice charm and great potential -- it just didnt live up to it. First off the appetizers -- we had the squid and the bruchetta. While the bruchetta was ok, the squid was down right disgusting, i couldnt choke it down! Its was very slimy and tart, maybe traditional italian but not my thing. From the entrees I noticed that they use the same cream/pesto sauce for their tortellini starter and gnocchi entree, so the chap who ordered that wasnt too thrilled. I had the namesake of the place 'la traviata' and it was almost inedible, it was procuitto and cheese melted on top of veal with a load of pesto it was like grease on-top of grease!I couldnt finish it (which is a rarity). But the worst was my wifes scallops which were supposedly fried but incredible mushy and tasted disgusting! She had 2 or 3 and just couldnt do it. They tasted like chemicals wrapped in a sponge. Worst part is that the person serving us (which I assume is the owner) muttered under his breath that he knew the scallops were bad but thats just how they came out. I couldnt believe it, how they can knowingly serve terrible food?? I definitely wont be back.", "author": "Sourav B."}

Any entree you order is automatically preceded by  a small plate of tortellini in your choice of red or white sauce (BUT ASK FOR PINK SAUCE -- THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS!): this is Old-time Italian-American good and campy and old school, and there are pix of opera singers all over the walls. You'll feel like the godfather. Tell them it's someone at the table's bday and you're in for a BIG surprise. I mean it. I went their for mine. The put the bread in the oven for your table when you walk in the door so it's piping hot when they give it to you. One drawback: the service. They don't always take orders, bring water/food/bread in the order you come in, so if you arrive with a party of six, you could watch three parties of two enter and get water, bread and even orders taken before you get as much as a nod. Complain about it -- that you've been there 20 minutes and you still don't have water, etc. -- and the attitude is basically: GET OVER IT! So go for the food and the atmosphere, but be ready to wait a while. It's almost worth it.", "author": "Emmabelle S."}

Eggplant parmesan appetizer. Awesome as well. I personally like the the Beverly Sills with the white sauce on my side plate of tortellini, but almost as good is the La Traviata Veal. Panacotta is awesome as well. There always seems to be an open table. We've rarely gone with a reservation.", "author": "Ian W."}

Besides  the food just being dead on tasty, the help, setting and warmth you feel when you enter is just wonderful. I travel quite a bit and still have not ever tasted a better Veal Parm then what is served here. The soup and white sause is to die for. So while there seems to be new \"hot\" spot listed every year , my advise, if you want great Italian food that is reasonably priced, with warmth and friendliness, then this is the place!", "author": "Ira S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2006-12-13", "description": "This place has a fun old school atmosphere with walls filled with photos, white table cloths, and intimate seating.  The room is currently dominated by a pretty Christmas tree -- a nice touch.  The server was an affable older man and the service was efficient and pleasant.  The food is the downfall.  With the exception of the very good minestrone soup the food was mediocre.  The eggplant appetizer was undercooked and had too much garlic.  The caesar salad with precut Romaine was uninspiring and had bland dressing.  The \"Chicken Beverly Sills\" was overcooked and the pancetta/cheese/mushroom topping added little more than saltiness.  The Shrimp pasta was good, but could have used a little more spice.  The cheese tortellini side for the chicken congealed into a buttery goo a little too quickly for my taste.  If you are in the neighborhood and want a quick fix of kitchy Italian food, this could be the answer.  Otherwise go elsewhere.", "author": "Mark S."}

Both of these things could be signs of a terrible diiner or an unexpected treat. At 9 PM on a Saturday night, it was about 3/4 full so we got plenty of attention, in fact when we left we said goodbye to 2 of the 3 waitstaff and the one that we missed ran out of the restaurant and yelled down the street after us: \"Have a good night, thank you for coming!\" -- truly old-fahioned hospilality. I had the salmon in parchment which had a lovely spicy tomato sauce and was delicious. My companion had gnocchi which were good, not sublime but very nice. Prices were resaonable but the atmosphere and the personality of the staff realy made it special. It has been there for over 33 years and I hope we can all keep it in business for another 33!", "author": "Dayala L."}
