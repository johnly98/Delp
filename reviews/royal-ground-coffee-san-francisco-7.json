I proceeded to the cash register to purchase my latte and sat down at one of their \"community tables\". I say \"community tables\" because the gentlemen sitting at the table mentioned it was a \"community table\" after asking if the open seat next to him was available. After about two minutes, a homeless man walks in the front door and of course sits next to me at the \"community table\". I carried on studying for my exam while he began to stare at me with eyes glazed over. I didn't give him attention initially until he grabbed my computer screen and forced me to look at him. I kept my demeanor and graciously introduced myself. He said his name was Alejandro and asked me why I'm not looking at him and told me that my race is why I will not look at him. I shook his hand and asked if I can proceed with my exam without looking at him he said yes, with the smell of alcohol coming from his breath. I returned to my exam and he grabbed my latte and poured it all over his face and clothes and started drinking it. I was flabbergasted, a complete stranger just poured my coffee on himself. I then approached the two individuals working at the cash register. One was male, and the other a female. They looked at me with a blank stare and said there's nothing we can do about it.

Before I begin my review, self-proclaimed coffee snobs and/or Blue Bottle-Die-Hards need not respond.  Royal Ground has been serving their signature blend of five different coffees for 30 years, and this local chain of non-corporate coffee shops has had lots of success.  Yes, when you come to this location you generally have to wait for a few minutes.  That said, antsy, time-crunched, oh-so busy folks whose time is of supreme importance, go across the street to Starbucks and they'll make your drink in 90 seconds instead of three to five minutes.\n\nMy husband and I have been coming here fairly frequently for about a year and a half.  Originally we started coming because we wanted to support our local coffee shop, but now we come because of the lovely people who work here, the amazing lattes they serve, and the cozy and inviting atmosphere.  If I could work from home, this would be my \"office.\"  On the weekends, we'll order our lattes and bagels (and they use block cream cheese, not the fake Philly spread from a tub!) and go sit outside with our dog.  Every time we order from Rene, he thanks us for coming and calls us \"my friend.\"  Sure, any good salesman could use these words, but he clearly is a kindhearted, genuine and hard-working man who values his customers.  He even saves the salt bagels for us on the weekends (oh well, I revealed our little secret, but I had to give an example of what a true friend he really is:)!\n\nAs for the inside space, they have a little chalk-board where customers can write a joke of the day.  \"What do you call an alligator in a vest?\"  An investigator, of course!  \"What did the fish say when he hit the wall?\"  Duh...dam!!  If this kind of humor does not appeal to you, or if you'd rather sit in plush leather chairs and couches, as opposed to furniture that was either donated or purchased from Good Will, this may not be the place for you.  And that's ok!  Just realize what a little gem this is to many people in the neighborhood, and thank the staff for treating all human beings with dignity and respect.", "author": "Spice O."}

I get the door halfway open and have started to walk in when one of the girls outside, wearing an apron, says \"We're closed!\"\n\nI close the door and turn to leave, saying, \"Oh, sorry, I just checked Yelp and it said you're open till midnight.\"\n\nSo then another person, either another employee or a friend of said employee's, says in a very surly tone, \"Well in that case, it must be re-opened!\"\n\nNo, dude, it doesn't need to be reopened. Not a particularly keen response to a would-be customer who apologized for trying to enter after closing, explaining a mistake.\n\nIf the place isn't open to midnight, they should change their online listing of hours.

It's cozy inside and I like the wall of animal photos...can I add my cat??  \n\nI would have given 5 stars but I was baffled that they didn't know what a cafe au lait was.  Isn't that a fairly standard coffee drink?  I explained it was half coffee and half steamed milk (it was getting late in the day so I didn't want too much caffeine) and I asked for nonfat milk...instead I got a full cup of coffee with with a tiny shot of steamed whole milk.  I'm not one to get my feathers ruffled easily so it was no big deal.", "author": "Lew D."}

They were both horribly shocking, the taste of the soy hot coco felt like they just used choc. soy milk and steamed  it. My latte was nasty took two sips and threw it away. they over steamed the milk and  used a perforated spoon to catch all the foam... i was saddened =( must try again i suppose.", "author": "stephen c."}

For a time there I switched to decaf, and Peet's has the only potable decaf of which I know.  For a good, strong cup of REGULAR on the other hand, this place is tops.  Very nice folks behind the counter here; chill clientele as well.  I'm a fan of the occasional double-espresso, and this joint serves one of the best shots around.", "author": "Matt W."}

Monday night scrabble is a good time, and the most awesome film critic in the world parks out there, and is available if you need some in person advice. It's like family, not a coffee shop. Just order something if you want to access the free internet - I got in trouble once for being a mooch. Overall, a great place to do some work.", "author": "Stacy H."}

Very unlike a starbucks where if you're there for more than an hour you're gonna get some dirty looks.

First stop? Always Royal Oak for a sugar-free vanilla latte (her) and a medium coffee (me).

On a quiet day, it's nice, almost like a little tavern (because it's dark with a lot of wooden tables). The drink maker is a man of few words, but he does say \" Have a nice day\" after he hands you the drink. The pastries look and taste forlorn. The fixins station is located in this little nook that only person can be in at a time. Their counter should be higher to hide the not clean looking prep space in the back.

Sometimes I get the munchies, but for some reason, this one has a smaller selection than say the one by GGP in the Richmond district.
