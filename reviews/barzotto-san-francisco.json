{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-10-30", "description": "My friend and I were looking for an affordable restaurant in the Mission District, specifically an Italian restaurant, preferably with homemade pasta. We found Barzotto on Yelp and learned that it fit all our criteria and was on BuzzFeed WorthIt. That sealed the deal. \n\nUpon entering, we were expecting to be seated by a waiter, but you actually order up front and then choose a seat. We came early, around 5, so there was no crowd at all. \n\nMany of the pastas had cheese, and I wanted to order them without it without sacrificing the flavor. I ended up ordering the one pasta that didn't have cheese at all-Little tongues.\n\nLittle Tongues (linguine-$16): Delicious! I was so hungry-I finished the entire bowl. I liked how the sauce had a lemony/peppery flavor and a lighter/oil-based consistency. The noodles were perfect and the eggplant and peppers were cooked just right (not crunchy, not mushy). \n\nSnail Shells (lumache-$12): THIS IS A MUST! Literally one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. There was sauce inside the large, curved noodles, so with your first bite, the pasta shell pops and the sauce bursts into your mouth. I hate when my pieces of pasta are not covered in sauce, and this dish ensures that you get that sauce:pasta ratio with every bite. I could seriously taste the freshness of this hand-rolled pasta. And the whipped ricotta was so fluffy! Like whipped cream. My friend couldn't finish so she took the rest to-go. You cannot beat the price for this dish-it is SO WORTH IT.\n\nAlso, what is up with places charging extra for bread. The focaccia was $4! I always look forward to the bottomless bread service at Italian restaurants-at least all the ones I've been to back home have free bread.\n\nMy service experience here was really weird which is why I'm giving Barzotto four stars. I asked the cashier which dish would taste good without cheese and he asked if I was allergic. I said no, I'm just sensitive to it and partially lactose-intolerant, so I can handle a little bit of cheese. He then went on to tell me that they take allergies very seriously and that the only thing I should order is the little tongues. I wanted a different pasta (with the cheese on the side) because they were CHEAPER than this SIXTEEN DOLLAR one. It was like he was trying to get me to order the expensive one! I just went with it. Then, he gave me a buzzer and said to find a table. But I wanted to wait for my friend to finish ordering. I was waiting for her and he again asked me to go sit down. There were plenty of open tables-I didn't need to sit down right away. He said it was so they knew where to deliver the food, but it obviously wasn't going to be ready in the three minutes it took her to order.", "author": "Megan H."}

Barzotto's payment screen strongly suggested a 15%+ tip. \n\nAside from unappealing expected tip, the dining experience was lackluster. We sat at the bar at the back of the restaurant and waited for our pasta. His pappardelle came within a couple of minutes. The pasta was half the width of any other pappardelle we've ever had. The dish was good but for $20, it was not inexpensive at all, despite the casual restaurant format. By the time he finished his entire bowl of pappardelle, my radiatore finally arrived. Sitting near the kitchen, we could tell that pasta dishes are not made based on order sequence. Instead, the kitchen waits until several orders of the same pasta are placed so they can make multiple portions in one pan. This led to one dish coming out much later than the other. The pasta I got was overcooked and unpalatable. I couldn't taste anything other than the black pepper.

Gotta say, wasn't really worth it.\n\nAfter a brief hike down to Kirby Cove, we were hit with the predicament of where to go for lunch. A quick suggestion by my friend pointed to this place in the Mission district with a casual mention of hearing of it through the comedic popular food review Youtube series, \"Worth It.\"\n\nThere wasn't a line on this hot Sunday at 1pm. Shouldn't have been too surprised. You order up front and then seat yourself. The menu is fairly simple. Each dish is already paired up with its own type of pasta. I thought all the options looked fine, but what really caught my eye was the brunch special that wasn't on the menu: the carbonara, and more specifically the soft egg on top. I'm a sucker for soft eggs, poached eggs, easter eggs, like how could I not choose it when the dish comes with a soft egg while it costs $2 to add one to any other dish.\n\nI don't remember waiting too long for the food. First impression: that's a small bowl. They served all our dishes in bowls. Interesting. But anyway, I popped that sucker open and dug right in. As the yolk slowly oozed out onto my shell like pasta, I could feel the wave of salt crystals rapidly depolarize all the Na channels on my tongue. Like give me two cups of water for that pasta, it was so salty. A bit too much cheese too. I also tried my friend's spaghetti and meatballs, a seemingly innocuous dish. Their meatballs had turkey in it too. It tasted fine, but I didn't think one could mess up spaghetti and meatballs anyway, besides giving a paltry portion--which they did.\n\nWhen I later perused the Worth It episode on this place, I saw that they featured their spaghetti and meatballs, especially the rough, amazing texture of the noodles. Didn't catch that at all.\n\nAnyway, seems to be a relatively cheap pasta option for SF, but the portions were a bit lacking for me. Definitely not worth the hype.", "author": "Hanning X."}

It's a good option in this neighborhood. \n\nThe process\nFigure out what you want to eat (the menu isn't too big, so it shouldn't be hard). Order and pay at the front. Take a number to an open table. Sit and wait for service. Go get your own water (near the front) if you're thirsty.\n\nThe food\nSpaghetti and Meatballs: Pretty solid. Nothing too fancy or amazing about it, but it's a solid dish. The meatballs are a blend of meats, so really read it to ensure you like that type of meatball.\n\nStuffed tubes: probbably could use more salt. The filling was very creamy, but not too flavorful. Pasta was baked, without much sauce. If you're not a sauce person, but like filling, this would be a good choice.\n\nRibbons: this one was flavorful enough. Almost too salty (on hindsight, if I ordered both the tubes and the ribbons, the mix of the two might work). The short ribs were really nicely done, and I like the thicker pasta ribbons.\n\nPierced noodles: This one I liked, mostly for the texture. Not sure what happened to the noodles to pierce it, but it collected some of that clam sauce well. \n\nPorchetta: I know this place is supposed to be known for the pasta, but seriously get the porchetta. Unless it's against your religion or food choices, this is the thing to get. There's a side of salad and pickles to help cut the fat. SO good.\n\nService here, even though it's not set up to be full service, is great. Yes, you get your own water. But they come by with your food, pick up your plates, and can assist with ordering dessert or something extra if you need it. Which means. TIP THEM, PEOPLE. Either take some extra bills and drop them off at the table, or pre-tip them at the counter. Don't be THAT person. \n\nI'd come in a table for 2 or 3, as there's not many spaces for a large party.

I normally wouldn't get this but you should get it if you want to get in some veggies. 5/5 \n\nWe finish all of this with the pistachio cherry gelato. I wouldn't necessarily call it gelato.

It's called, \"BARZOTTO.\" BARZOTTO serves the customers of all ages to taste their authentic, natural Italian cuisines from pastas to boards especially salads every 365 days a year! The atmosphere is very laid back and calming as I welcomed there. The concept is pretty basic thanks to their simpler menu that shows classic & contemporary Italian dishes. The interior is very modern and sleek like the marbled tables & indie furnitures inside especially the mini outdoor patio near the front door.\n\nThe employees here from counter, servers & cookers are doing a fantastic job for making the customers like me an unbelievable, exceptional friendly service! No cons!\n\nNow onto the food! Today on Saturday afternoon (8/18/2018), I ordered the signature and customers favorite dish, the Extra Long Noodles, Spaghetti. It contains fresh spaghetti pasta made from scratch with Marinara sauce, Parmesan cheese & their homemade pork & turkey meatballs (3 counts). As I ate it, that spaghetti dish tasted flawless and delightful! The pasta of that spaghetti did braised very well after boiling and it's quite eatable to bite without being too harden. The marinara sauce was simply authentic just like homemade thanks to their special ingredients of tomatoes, seasonings & a hint of mint! Finally, their pork & turkey meatballs: wowzers! That's the best meatballs that I've ever eaten in many years! Perfectly cooked without being too raw and pale. The seasonings of these meatballs are spellbound to devour thanks to the combination of ground pork & turkey including seasonings and green garnishes. Overall, not a bad pasta lunch meal at all!\n\nParking at BARZOTTO can be quite challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface street parking nor the parking lot if it's available. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nTo conclude, BARZOTTO is the most incredible & unbelievable local Italian restaurant that I've ever discovered & visited for the first time right here in San Francisco! Perfect for friends, family & co-workers gathering day & night. A well received! My rating: 5 solid stars.", "author": "William L."}

So instead I got the dish with pappardelle (ribbon) noodles instead. All of their noodles are made fresh in-house, and you can really taste the difference! I fell in love with the marinara sauce, but I didn't like the pork & turkey meatballs that much. I think it's just because I'm not a fan of turkey meatballs, but still the dish was really good! I also ordered the Porchetta (roasted pork) board, and it definitely exceeded expectations. It was delicious, crispy, fatty, so good! The pork rind part was the best, the crisp and fat from the pork was just too good. Definitely would recommend it!", "author": "Kathryn T."}

For someone who's not a huge fan of marinara sauce, I thought the sauce was good! It's not too acidic, which is good. It is flavorful without being overpowering. It comes with 3 meatballs, which were soft, tender, and savory! \n\nI wish the serving size was a bit larger especially for $15 a bowl. But it was definitely great spaghetti!

One will be a salad or a soup and the other something meat centric. Last week, I decided to get my main from Barzotto. Our order arrived via Caviar on Friday, May 11th around 12:15pm.\n\n*Porchetta Sandwich: Toasted bun, chili aioli, aged cheddar, and sprouts ($11)\n*Seasonal Pickles ($2)\n\nI got the sandwich. It had a good amount of pork and luckily, they put the greens on the side, so they held up when putting together the sandwich. (Sometimes with all the aioli, it can wilt the greens a bit.) The porchetta was nice and savory. Like a meaty bacon. I didn't really get any cheddar flavor, but I only ate the insides of the sandwich, so maybe it stuck to the bun? There was a lot of aioli, so it was hard to tell. One of my coworkers ordered the pickles and I tried some. They had a good acidity and were nice and crunchy. More like giardiniera than just straight pickles.\n\nGreat lunch spot. Happy I finally tried Barzotto. Their porchetta sandwich was definitely tasty.", "author": "Elena N."}

I really like these fast casual restaurants for their high food quality and relaxed atmosphere. \n\nWe ordered two pastas and the porchetta board. The extra long noodles was definitely my favorite. I liked the texture of the ribbons pasta with braised beef, but the flavor of the marinara with the meatballs mixed with the extra long noodles made me wishing I didn't have to share. The crispy skin of the porchetta was on point, especially when paired with their cherry mustard condiment. \n\nI liked how they had a variety of seating options, with individual tables, high seats, a communal table and seating next to the kitchen so you can watch your pasta being made. Coming for lunch was a treat and I can only imagine how busy the place is for the dinner crowd. \n\nThis can be a great place for both dining alone or with a small group.

This place would be considered fast casual in the sense that you order from the counter, get a pager, grab a pitcher of water, and wait at a table for the staff to deliver your food.

My favorite seats are at the pasta bar where you can see the massive amount of artisan effort put into making all the fresh pasta.\n\nSnail Shells: This was purely delicious!  Most fresh pasta I've had is of the stuffed ravioli or floppy pappardelle variety; firm pasta tends to be pre-made in dry form.  These shells probably came out of the extruder earlier in the day; they had the desired firmness you'd expect from dry pasta but also a very unique chewiness that must be because they're fresh.  Very eye opening.  The tomato sauce was delicious of course; ample quantity to get lost in the shell openings.  The big globs of fresh cheese were strange at first, but actually worked quite well when I mixed each glob across 4-5 shells.\n\nPorchetta Sandwich: Roli Roti is stiff competition.  Barzotto did a fine jump standing up.  Not better or worse, just different.  Main difference being that they used a creamy spicy sauce.  It paired quite nicely with the crispy pork.  Definitely a fan.", "author": "Adam B."}

It's decorated really nicely and the price point definitely suggest sit down, but you have to order at the counter and find your own table. \n\nI came here with a friend on a weekday night and we were able to find a table easily! Between us we shared two bowls of pasta (the beef parpadelle and the special of the day which was some kind of sausage ragu) and the porchetta board. I think the total for this came out to around $70, which I thought was fairly steep considering the portions aren't THAT big. \n\nThe porchetta board was my personal favorite of the meal, and I'm someone who doesn't even like pork belly! The meat paired so well with the cherry mostarda that accompanied it, and the pickled vegetables helped cut through the fattiness of the pork. The skin on the porchetta is also super crispy, almost like a chicharone! \n\nThe two pastas were good but I felt they were lacking just a tinge of flavor. Perhaps with more salt or some red pepper flake it would have stood out more; as it was it was a little bland for me. The portions aren't exactly small, but I would have expected a little more for $20 a bowl considering pasta is so cheap. The pasta texture was amazing though: you could definitely tell it was fresh because the texture was just so chewy and delightful.\n\nOverall, love the idea but I probably won't go again unless someone else really wants to.", "author": "Melissa H."}

My boyfriend doesn't really enjoy pasta or Italian food for that matter, but this completely changed his mind!  We first saw BARZOTTO being featured on Buzzfeed's Worth It and it was definitely WORTH IT! We ordered the Carbonara, the Spaghetti, and the Pappardelle for pastas.  We also ordered the Niman Ranch Porchetta board to share.  All of the food was DELICIOUS!  The pasta had the perfect amount of sauce so that the pasta wasn't swimming in it and it was so light that it didn't leave you feeling heavy and groggy.  The Porchetta was the winner for my boyfriend because the meat was juicy and tender and the skin was nice and crispy.  The board came out a little later than anticipated (we didn't mind), but they graciously gave us a complimentary gelato.  We chose the honey and sea salt and it was a party in my mouth.  The sea salt was the perfect balance to the sweetness of the soft serve gelato and the honey.  We immediately started messaging all of our friends to check out this place.  I think we found our new favorite Italian restaurant!  BARZOTTO, we will be back very soon!\n\nExtra Tips:\n- It is a type of quick service restaurant.  You order at the register right when you walk in the door.  I would suggest looking at the other reviews, the pictures, and the menu prior to going because it can be a tad overwhelming when you are trying to decide on your meal while there is a line out the door waiting for you to order.  \n- The seating is limited.  We went at 6 pm on Sunday evening and it was easy for the 3 of us to sit, but as we were leaving, the place was pretty full with limited tables.

Especially when it's just two of you, and one person's food comes out way earlier than the other's. You're left in this awkward position of trying to make the other person feel like it's okay for them to start, and the other person insisting they don't mind waiting. This happened to me and my friend, where my radiatore came probably 15 or more minutes before her spaghetti and meatballs. I know it was longer than usual because we had a lot of awkward pauses in our convo wondering where her food was.\n\nWhen both our dishes finally came, I thought the pasta was decent, but nothing to get too excited about.

Came here on a Sunday night and I saw a lot of people that got this same dish too (they only had two pasta dishes available at this time, but part of me thinks other people must've saw that Worth It video too). Noodles had a good firmness and chew to it. Meatballs were excellent. For the Bucatini with Clams, I was not as much of a fan. It had a very vinegar-y taste to it, which was a bit too much for me. It's just an acquired taste that I didn't have.\n\nSERVICE (4/5): Wait wasn't long and after paying, we got to choose our seats. I thought this was pretty effective in cutting time waiting for a waiter to order and get a check. Since the menu is pretty small anyways, it doesn't take a lot of time to choose. And though a lot of items weren't available, the food came out really quickly.\n\nOVERALL: I would come here again for the spaghetti and meatball. It's a solid dish. I would also want to try the porchetta and the desserts. \n\n(On a side note, I thought it was funny how they raised the pasta dish +$1 preemptively with the release of the Worth It video.)\n\nALTERNATIVE: The Italian Homemade Company (In Little Italy or Marina)", "author": "Wendy Y."}

No need to dress up, no need for reservations, you walk in, order at the counter and seat yourself. They dubbed themselves a pasta bar, but the influences show California ingredients. The menu isn't littered with fancy words and the pasta names maybe in Italian, but the English description is in bold and clearly tells you what you're getting.  Plus, hand made pastas always have a fresher advantage over the dried ones. If you're lucky, on a random Monday night, you can even get a ramen bowl here.\n\nNow, the PORCHETTA with its crispy crackling skin, is always a winner.  I dream about my days growing up in Manila eating lechon with Mang Thomas sauce. At Barzotto, it's a better version that's jazzed up with salsa verde and cherry mostarda or whatever is in season. A small frisee salad is on hand to make your pilates instructor happier.\n\nThe exclusively Italian wine selections are straightforward. Do you want sparkling, white, red or rose? light, medium or full bodied? Pricing is $10 a glass or $40 a bottle.

When you walk in, you are greeted at the front where you order first. After ordering and paying, you seat yourself and wait for the staff to bring your food to your table. My boyfriend and I ordered the Extra Long Noodles and Pierced Noodles. I originally wanted the Stuffed Tubes, but the kind chef came to our table to tell us that they are all out of the Stuffed Tubes pasta. We did not pay extra and the chef was kind enough to also give us a basket of focaccia bread while we waited for our order. \n\nFOCACCIA BREAD: with a side of marinara sauce\n\nFour pieces of hot bread with a side of marinara sauce to dip it in. I tasted delicious herbs like rosemary and thyme with a generous amount of oil and butter to make it crispy. It was super soft in the middle and the marinara sauce cut through the fat to give it a tangy and sweet tomato addition. \n\nEXTRA LONG NOODLES: Spaghetti and Meatballs \n\nThis dish redefined spaghetti and meatballs for me. The marinara sauce was sweet, tangy, and fresh. I loved how the pasta grabbed onto the sauce so well and it created a more enjoyable experience. The pasta itself was a lot chewier and harder than what I am used to, but I loved it. The meatballs are a combination of pork and turkey and it was just great. It was fatty, flavorful, and worked incredibly well with the sauce and pasta. \n\nPIERCED NOODLES: Bucatini\n\nI was very surprised with this dish and how delicious it was! The pasta itself was green, which I am unsure how it was made, maybe spinach pasta? Nevertheless, it was amazing! Same pasta texture as the spaghetti so it held onto the buttery and garlicky sauce very well. The clams tasted so good and fresh with a nice briny taste to it too. \n\nBoth pasta dishes had an amazing grip on my fork and I had so much fun twirling it around my fork.

We were looking forward to ordering the spaghetti and porchetta (a personal favorite of mine) but unfortunately the porchetta was sold out (we had a late dinner on a Friday night around 9 pm).  Instead, we ordered the bucatini with clams along with the spaghetti and meatballs.\n\nWhile I wish I could say I loved this place, I didn't have a great experience considering the price, and I'm not certain of the hype around it.  The layout, for one is confusing.  You're first seated, but then have to return to the front desk to order before returning to your table where they'll bring out the food.  It seems like an inefficient process and we weren't informed that we needed to order at the front, so we were waiting aimlessly at our table for about 15 minutes before we caught on.\n\nThe food also was not as great as I expected it to be.  I was disappointed to not be able to order the porchetta, which I was most looking forward to, but still had high hopes for the other dishes.  The spaghetti and meatballs were good; the meatballs were tender and the pasta was well cooked at balanced.  However the bucatini left a bit to be desired.  The sauce had capers and I'm guessing lemon juice, which left it briny and acidic.  It was a perfect balance with the clams, however they were left in the shell, making it a nightmare to try to pick out and eat together.  The dish was garnished with furikake, which I found to be a strange combination (I'm not a fan of \"fusion\" dishes).\n\nOverall while the atmosphere is nice and the dishes are relatively cheap compared to other places in SF, I don't think it's that worth the visit.

The lemon flavour of the snail shell pasta dish, just such a nice summery touch.\n\nBest pasta spot in the city. Im coming here again and again.", "author": "Devon W."}

One thing I really like about this place is that it gives you serving sizes that are appropriate. Some places just give you so much fun and it isn't very tasty. Better than any other place in the Marina. Also, service was really good. They were like done getting our food in like 5-10 minutes and the meat dish, 15 minutes. And they felt like they were late so they offered us a free serving of ice cream. I recommend getting the porcetta, the meat melts in your mouth. My favorite Italian spot in SF.

Barzotto has a really great ambience going on, with an open kitchen where you can see pasta being rolled. Their menu is limited, which I really like, because what's on there is spectacular. I'm vegetarian, and there are quite a few options. There's a cauliflower pasta, a marinara pasta and the stuffed tubes. My favorite is the marinara and stuffed tubes, although all three are pretty fantastic. The focaccia is not great, but you could get the veggie platter as a starter. The staff are not super friendly but since you basically order and pay upfront before being seated, there's not much interaction with the serving staff. Don't forget to get the housemade soft serve gelato! The one with honey and sea salt is to die for.", "author": "Sharadha R."}

Me and my friend were excited to try out this place.\n\nI came a while back with my friend on a Sunday night for dinner. We did not make a reservation and was expecting a long wait. But it turns out, the restaurant wasn't too busy so we got a seat shortly after we ordered. It is an quick dinning type of concept. Order at the counter, get a tracker, and the waitress will seat you at a table. The menu consists of pasta, appetizers, and dessert.  We ordered a salad to shared and each a pasta to try. My friend got the spaghetti and meatballs and I got the clams pasta. The salad was served first. The salad was bland and dry with little dressing. I noticed the lettuce pieces were turning red, a sign that it is not fresh. I had a taste of the spaghetti and meat balls, it was good but not amazing. The pasta with clam was.... bad. The flavor was bland and worse of all there was sand in my pasta. Most of the clams shells were closed, which usually is a sign that it is not fresh. \n\nI don't know what happened. Maybe it was just a off day for Barzotto but I can not justifying paying more than $15 for dishes that are not fresh and has sand in it. I looked through yelp reviews after and noticed that many other who ordered the clam pasta has sand in it too. Barzotto is definitely not my \"Worth It\" pick for the price and quality.", "author": "Sunny L."}

The cashier said no (this is a counter spot where they give you a number and you sit down). When I god my plate there was a raw yolk on it. I was pregnant and asked if there was a way to cook it or just not have it. The staff seemed pretty irritated that I asked for a change but considering my situation I wasn't going to risk it. Our table got an ugly look from the cook behind the counter and she proceeded to angrily take the yolk off and send it right back. I would've appreciated a substitution or at least a better reaction to my request.\n\nThe carbonara was very plain and the extreme saltiness of the pancetta did not compliment the other flavors.

Like I exclusively ate pasta as a little girl and my mom would call me her pasta girl, saying I was entirely made up of pasta, which wasn't a huge lie. So, I have pretty high standards when it comes to pasta and prior to going to Barzotto, I didn't think a place could come even close to Il Corvo in Seattle in serving ridiculously good pasta eats. \n\nUpon walking in, I was a bit surprised to see how casual it is in here! You order at the counter and get a number and then seat yourself - I honestly love that! It removes the sort of stodginess you get with being seated and all that jazz. \n\nWe decided to split the Cockscomb (cauliflower, chili, almond, and cresta pasta), and the Ribbons (braised beef, mushrooms, and pappardelle pasta) and then sat ourself at the bar counter so we could see the chefs making the fresh pastas, which was so fun to watch! \n\nThe food came out and it was GORGEOUS! I just knew this was gonna be some superbly good pasta! I took a bite of the beautiful green Cockscomb and WOW what an explosion of flavor. This one is super lemony with a nice minimal bite from the chili and some crunchiness from the almonds, and cooked perfectly al dente. I then tried to Ribbon - another home run success! The papardelle was so fresh and tasty and the sauce was creamy and indulgent, with the braised beef just pairing perfectly. Wowza. I knew I had finally found a place I could compare to Il Corvo!\n\nGo here and have yourself a good time and some good pasta!", "author": "Sabina S."}

I don't know.\n\nWe ordered the:\n - Ribbons (Pappardelle- slow braised beef, mushrooms, parmesan)\n - Radiators (Cacio e Pepe - cheese and pepper)\n - Snail Shells (Lumache - marinara, ricotta, lemon zest, pepper)\n - Roasted Half Chicken\n - House Made Foccacia\n - Side of Pork Meatballs\n - Bottle of brut rose\n \nMy favorite items were the ribbons, foccacia, and the pork meatballs. The ribbons and pork meatballs had a good flavor, and the bread was very moist and was perfect to dip in all the sauces. None of these really blew my mind, but they were the better ones in the bunch. \n\nThe snail shells are okay, and so was the half chicken. Chicken was not dry; it was, in fact, very moist, but just it was just a well-made rotisserie chicken, which is pretty basic. I liked the pickled veggies that came with the chicken. We actually didn't plan on ordering the chicken, but only did because the porchetta was sold out.\n\nMy least favorite item was the cacio e pepe. This item was also not planned to be ordered, but we were told that we didn't have enough food for our group of 4. The cacio e pepe was rather bland. I've had homemade cacio e pepe prepared by a non italian that was better than this.\n\nAll in all, I still had a fine experience because I was with good company, the service was fine, and the food was decent.

Second, they don't serve iced tea, which should be a big strike against any place, because some of us want something to drink that is not filled with sugar.  Third, the timing of food being served was bad ... they brought out one dish for my dining partner, while I had to sit there just watching him eat (I insisted he start so his food didn't get cold while waiting for mine), then was practically finished before they brought out my dish.  Then only after both of these past dishes were served did they think to bring out the appetizer dish that we specifically asked be served first.  All the servers do is hand you a bowl, and run off, and for this bad service, they expect a tip.  Really?!

It was pretty busy so before we ordered, the front desk woman worked with us to make sure we'd have a good place to sit with our kids + stroller. We found a spot in the back, and they asked the table next to us if it was OK to have the stroller, and they emphatically said yes. Then we went to sit down and a server came by and said we couldn't sit there because there needs to be enough room for everyone. Which, fine, if those are your rules we're happy to play by them. But you should have consistent rules, and a system where one person is responsible for seating. And if any servers disagree with how guests are sitting, they take it up with the person responsible -- NOT the guests. Anyway, this was a stressful + contentious start to our $91 meal.\n\nThe food had highlights and lowlights:\n- Beets: Super highlight. Absolutely delicious. And for $6, actually quite a large portion. Probably the highlight of the meal. Definitely get the beets!!\n- Porchetta: Pretty tasty! At $20 maybe it's a bit pricey for what's more or less an appetizer-style course. But the presentation was baller, the cherry mostarda was delightful + there was a smear of jam too that was quite nice.\n- \"Bells\" campanella pasta: The pasta was over-cooked, the cauliflower was mush, there was no acidity to make it pop. I feel like this could be a good dish but the execution was not good. It was a chore to eat half of it.\n- Baby lettuces: This was a bad salad. The lettuces were definitely not \"baby\", the leaves took several bites each. And the leaves were watery. And there was basically no dressing. My wife claims she tasted some but I didn't notice it.\n- Wine: Cab franc + Chardonnay. These were OK.\n- Snail shells pasta: Complimentary given the mixup with the seating! Well actually they messed up someone else's order and so they said we could have it or they were throwing it out. This was actually pretty great. It was the same ricotta as the beets but the pasta was properly cooked, the tomato sauce was on point, there was some nice acidity -- this is definitely a keeper.\n\nOverall, for $91, I'm not sure that we gained anything by going to a counter-order place vs. a traditional restaurant. Traditional restaurants know how to make guests feel at home with seating, and you'd get the benefit of food coming out in courses. They're just a lot less stressful + often less crowded. And for pretty much the same price.\n\nOne counter-order pasta place that was absolutely killer was The Italian Homemade Company up in the Marina. Similar concept but more Italian and better executed. Also \"a Mano\" and Perbacco have just insanely good pasta. I think we'll go back those places a few more times and probably skip Barzotto. But Barzotto was worth a try.", "author": "Jon E."}

My friend and I decided to take a seat at the bar, which gave us a front-row seat to the pasta-making action - needless to say, we were enthralled. \n\nI ordered the \"Radiators\" (Radiatore) which was their take on carbonara (pictured below). I added the pancetta and while I'm used to it being a bit smaller in size, the meat was excellent quality and added an interesting texture to the dish. I don't know what it was about it - the freshness of the pasta, the gooey-ness of the egg mixed with the load of parmesan cheese (idk if they dropped the can by mistake or they just blessed me with a generous portion), or the crispness of the pepper - but this was the concoction of every pasta lover's DREAM.

There's a mixed casual/sit-down vibe to the place, since you order at the front though you can definitely eat your food in-house.  While there was nothing that made me think the food would be subpar, I did wonder if the less formal dining setting would negatively impact the quality. \n\nLuckily, my friend and I were able to sample a selection of their menu, and I thought all the dishes were great.  My favorite was their porchetta, which came with a delightfully crispy exterior covering succulent and well-flavored pork.  Even though I'm not the biggest mushroom fan, their version of pappardelle with a beef and mushroom sauce was al dente and quite tasty.

High ceilings, bar seating with stools and some low tables along a padded bench.\n\nThey don't take reservations but we were able to get a table for two easily for lunch.

Nicely dressed and a variety of textures. Definitely not boring and something I'd love to try to recreate at home.\n\nRoasted chicken- very impressive spread! Chicken was tasty (slightly pink in one piece unfortunately). The accompaniments were the star of the board--loved the olives, mustard, and eggplant (?) spread it came with.\n\nCockscomb Pasta- we rounded out the table with a pasta dish because we knew Barzotto is known for their fresh pasta. This was a pretty simple dish but I really liked the sauce (focaccia was perfect for soaking it up) and the cauliflower in it. \n\nReally enjoyed everything about this dining experience!

Creamy, meaty, flavorful, perfect pappardelle pasta.\n\nRADIATORE WITH NDUJA, BROCCOLINI, BURRATA 3.75* - it was solid. The pasta itself was great and allowed for the robust tomato sauce to creep into the pasta crevices. Burrata was fresh and generous. Wasn't particularly a fan of the nduja, but ohwell. \n\nFARMER'S MARKET VEGGIES 3.5* is a platter of market veggies mostly roasted. There was a mix of brussels, squash, carrots, etc and a side of pickled veggies as well. It was plated beautifully, but the flavors were nothing special and I would have expected the portion size to be a bit larger considering this is an \"entree\".\n\nPORK MEATBALLS 4* - juicy, moist meatballs with that yummy, flavorful tomato sauce\n\nThe menu changes often- my friend that came once before said all the pastas were different than when she came the last 2 times.

But wait, you have to pay for bread that really should have come with the porchetta? I don't know about that. \n\nNow let's get to the business aspects which sadly I am giving a 3-stars...Firstly, not a big fan of the pay upfront approach for the price and the establishment. It almost makes it feel like a fast food joint but it isn't. It also doesn't make business sense because my friend and I totally would have ordered another round of drinks or some other stuff but we definitely were too lazy to get back in line to make additional orders for more food and drinks that we clearly didn't need but felt compelled to get in the moment after the first drink. So they def. missed out on more business with this pay arrangement. Secondly, the added stress of finding seats, sitting down, then walking over and standing in line to make orders, then back to your seats walking your drinks, etc...really makes you start second guessing about the price and tip you are paying for the whole experience...\n\nThe lukewarm service didn't help either. The lady at the register was pretty cold. Then the bus boy literally just snatched the plates right off in front of my friend the second she put down her fork and walked off never even making eye contact with either of us. As a former waitress my friend was somewhat dismayed. \n\nI'd definitely go back for the food. Decent pasta that's reasonably priced is strangely hard to come by in the Mission.

First the shells are the color and shape of warm larvae, but it had either a cumin or curry flavor to it and was extremely salt. It just didn't work with the flavors. All three of us have diverse preferences and agreed this was a total miss. \n\nRibbons: has to be homemade pappardelle, it was so velvety perfect like a ribbon. The braised beef was perfect, the Rosemary was subtle, and mushrooms melted together just great. \n\nPork meatballs: sauce here was classic and satisfying when you want that traditional Rustic Italian sauce and the meatballs were hearty and just the right ratio of fat to lean meat.\n\nPorchetta: see picture. Both a hit and a miss. The inner portion of pork was quite dry and should have just been removed.While the outer ring was impeccable and to top it off there was a crispy ring of fat that so perfectly crunched in your mouth.

Doesn't anyone work normal hours in SF?  Granted, there were only 3-4 tables but still.

It had more fat than I'd like but the meat was moist and the skin was crispy.  Much appreciated that they had some pickled veggies alongside, and the condiment sauce was a nice touch.  Janice's nose detected some fish sauce.  We always love porchetta and this one was a winner.  Next up was the pappardelle.  I always love this thick noodle!  They were cooked al dente and served with a braised beef ragu and rosemary mushroom sauce which wasn't overly heavy, but oh so comforting.  Last up was cock's comb pasta.  This one was light served with cauliflower, olive oil, garlic, almond, chili flakes and lemon.  Definitely for those wanting something healthier.  I was wanting more from this dish, but it was solid.  \n\nBarzotto calls itself an American pasta bar, so don't expect traditional Italian fare here.

Apparently you have to order and pay for all your food and drinks first at the counter - like a fast food place - and then find a table.  This alone is enough to not want me to hurry back.  \n\nThe menu is very small.  5 pastas.  2 salads.  No appetizers.  A few sides and a couple of boards.  Small wine list - wines are $10 a glass.  Ordered 2 glasses of wine, vegetable board, side of focaccia, snail shell pasta and the Bells pasta.  About $75 without tip.  \n\nFood came out pretty quick.  Loved the vegetable board.  Pasta was good to above average.  \n\nMay get take out in future but BARZOTTO will not be on my list if I am looking for a full dining experience.", "author": "Marty M."}

I also really love the concept at Barzotto! It felt like fast-casual dining! Order your food & drinks at the counter, choose a place to sit, and everything is brought to you! My husband and I found a cozy spot up at their counter which had a window looking into the kitchen and it was fun seeing the delicious pasta dishes being made!\n\nBarzotto offers wine by the glass & bottle BUT you can also bring in our own bottle of wine for a $15 corkage fee which is what we did. We started off with their housemade focaccia bread which was crunchy and buttery and so so good! Their cabbage & kale salad was one of the best salads I've ever had. And we shared the cavatelli and cresta di gallo pastas. The first thing I noticed when eating the pastas was that you can tell they are fresh and homemade! The ingredients they use in the dishes were creative and combined really well together! Everything had great flavor and was so delicious! We cleared every plate that we ordered! The food also came out very fast! Staff was very upbeat and friendly. The vibe in the restaurant felt trendy and energetic. Absolutely loved this place and thought the concept was brilliant!

A solid 4 stars for sure. \n\nOrder at the register, they'll give what looks like a buzzer, and you seat yourself. The device that looks like a buzzer will not actually buzz. It actually tracks where you seat yourself so they can figure out where to bring your food. Kinda neat. \n\nI had the pierced spaghetti (bucatini) with pancetta, tomato, chili and breadcrumbs. The sauce was quite delicious and I felt the pasta could've been a bit more al dente but was still good. Usually when having pasta, I get incredibly sleepy with carb overload but I still felt light after eating here. \n\nAlso shared the turkey meatballs with my gf. DO NOT PASS THESE UP! They're juicy and tender but the sauce is amazing!!!!!! I actually preferred the meatball sauce over the sauce in my pasta dish. \n\nDefinitely coming back so I can try their roasted chicken and porchetta,", "author": "Susy C."}

Straightforward happiness greets you at the door and will ask you to describe what you'd like to have for supper.  Fortunately, the menu is simple and as such the transaction in the beginning takes but a moment and isn't rushed or confusing even for me.  If you arrive at a normal dining hour and not the hour of ba where you get to steal all the sweet and low before the others arrive you'll have a few minutes waiting for the greeting and so as have time to peruse the selections.\n\nI say skip lunch and go ba, for as it's always more pleasant this way. But that's just me.  Do what you want.\n\nA pasta dish, a salad, and the pork served on a simple wooden board with pickled things.  The kitchen is right over there and the people that bring you what they make are prompt and happy you're in their house.\n\nThis isn't maybe a full on date night place.  It's a place to take that person with whom you're already acquainted to enjoy good food thoughtfully prepared served promptly and in and out and on your way you are.

If we lived super close by, this might be a place I would pick up food from. But it didn't wow enough for me to go out of my way for. \n\nThis fast casual place means you order up at the bar but they bring food to your table and help clear tables which is a weird concept for a place that tries to toe the line between somewhat upscale. The prices certainly didn't reflect the lack of inclusion of service, and I rather have paid a bit more for a better experience.\n\nWe started off with the beets and the pickled vegetables. We love a good pickled veg (I mean, hello Mission Cheese shop), but these were nothing to write home about. Beets were tasty and a good amount for the price. The snail shells were tasty but simple -- with lemon zest, ricotta and marinara sauce coating each shell. However, I was fairly disappointed by the braised beef over pappardelle. The ribbon noodles were too al dente (chewy much) and the whole dish lacked seasoning. \n\nI expected more, but found this place lacking.

Verdict? My friend definitely has good taste. \n\nAmbiance is casual and modern - perfect for a date or catch up. You order up front at the counter and then you find your own table (or before it gets crowded, have a friend find a table while you order). \n\nThey have a simple and solid menu. They offer salad, pasta, boards (i.e. porchetta, veggies, roasted half chicken), sides (i.e. meatballs, breadsticks, giardiniera), and vanilla gelato sundaes! They also have a wine and beer selection. In the back of the restaurant, you can see the chefs freshly make the pasta. Service is friendly, attentive, and quick. \n\nMy friend and I shared the Turkey Meatballs ($8) which are two HUGE meatballs covered in marinara. I thought the meatballs were just okay. \n\nI ordered the Fazzoletti Pasta ($17) which is handkerchief pasta, slow braised beef, mushrooms, and rosemary. The pasta was soft and incredibly tasty and the braised beef was tender. All of the ingredients mixed well together to make such a delicious dish. The portion size was perfect. I didn't feel hungry afterward nor did I have that heavy stuffed feeling I sometimes get from pasta. I was very impressed! \n\nMy friend ordered the Bucatini Pasta ($15) which is pierced spaghetti, pancetta, tomato, chili, and breadcrumbs. It was just as tasty (although I still prefer the Fazzoletti Pasta), the spaghetti was chewy, and the breadcrumbs definitely added that extra UMPH texture. \n\nI'm glad I got to check this cute Italian restaurant.

But those containers of organic, free range raw dog food and microbubble baths can't pay for themselves so alas, I must work. \n\nOn the weekends, I try to bring Tater Tot everywhere I can (he's the social butterfly). I was following Barzotto on FB and saw they had outdoor seating. It's just a tiny lone table outside but it's better than nothing so decided to pop in for lunch before going to the dog park.\n\nBarzotto opened last Wednesday and took over the St. Vincent space (next door to Arizmendi Bakery). It's a fast-casual restaurant - order at the counter, you receive a buzzer, grab a pitcher of water, and sit yourself. \n\nThe menu is pasta centric with 5 pastas, 2 salads, roasted chicken, porchetta, 3 sides, and soft serve vanilla gelato. Everything is under $17, and gluten-free pasta is available for +$3. Wine, beer, and low proof cocktails only.  \n\nWhen ordering with the cashier, I told them we would be dining here and sitting outside with my dog. I was told the table outside is for \"take-out only\" and that our food would have to be served in to-go boxes. I was pretty annoyed because how do you expect customers to share and slice a hunk of meat in a to-go box? \n\nAnyhow, maybe it was a miscommunication (since they're so new) or maybe they decided to change their policy because our food was served on actual plates. Thank you but that whole situation was awkward.\n\nFor lunch, we shared the Porchetta Board and the Bucatini. The slice of Porchetta ($16) was beautifully presented on a wooden board and adorned with accoutrements: frisee, pickled veggies, a berry jam, charred lemon, and a chimichurri: http://bit.ly/2bwPj77. I was a bit concerned with the mixed reviews of the porchetta but ours came out fine since we came early in the day. The skin was crackly: http://bit.ly/2bJz187 and the meat was tender. It was on the bland side but I didn't mind since the chimichurri and squeeze of lemon gave it good flavor. You can take a slice of the porchetta home for $10 (in the cold case out front). \n\nWe were going to order a salad to share but I remember reading that the chef came from Flour + Water and they have awesome pasta so we also ordered the Bucatini: Pierced spaghetti, pancetta, tomato, chili, breadcrumbs ($15): http://bit.ly/2busooq. I'm glad we did because the pasta was solid. The housemade pasta was perfectly al-dente with a great toothsome chew and the tomato sauce was robust and tangy. The pancetta was rich and fatty but not overly salty. The chili added nice heat while the breadcrumbs added great texture. \n\nFor drinks, my friend ordered the Nitro Coffee ($5): http://bit.ly/2bfNWGD. I gave up caffeine but had a sip and it was super smooth and not bitter. It was easy to drink without cream or sugar. \n\nStaff was nice and food arrived timely. Even though I was given a buzzer, one of the employees said, they'll deliver our food to us. Everything else is self-service.\n\nThe space is much more contemporary than its St. Vincent days and they've installed pretty black and white deco tiled floors. There's counter seating where you can oversee the chefs making the pasta which is cool. \n\nStreet parking was surprisingly easy to find since we got there before noon but good luck at night. It's easily accessible from Bart (one block away). \n\nBarzotto is such an improvement over its predecessor that served terrible, overpriced food...which Bauer gave 3 glowing stars to (good bathroom reading: http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/the-trouble-the-michaels). \n\nWhy is that man still relevant after a century?", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I order delivery from them quite frequently on Uber Eats, and it always arrives quickly and is piping hot / delicious.  The pasta sizes are a bit small via delivery - they don't have small / large options like in the restaurant, but everything is always great.  I tend to order the Cockscomb pasta a lot for delivery, along with the little gem salad and the meatballs.  Those are all amazingly tasty.\n\nI just ate in the restaurant for the first time last night, and it was mostly a good experience.  There were some issues with service, however, that resulted in 4 and not 5 stars.\n\nOrdering in the restaurant is a little odd.  You order right when you walk in and then you get a table.  OK - but I had to wait ages while the woman in front of me tasted wines, asked a million questions, etc.  Just seemed like there should be a better way to do this...  Maybe, if they have a guest like that, another person manages the rest of the line?  Or, maybe alcohol could be ordered once people sit?  \n\nAnyway, for dinner, we had the little gem salad, the kale and cabbage salad, the pappardelle with braised pork, another pasta dish with ham and peas (not on the online menu), a side of golden beets, and a side of seasonal pickles.  Everything was fantastic, except maybe the pickles, which were kind of meh and very heavy on the bell pepper.  We also split a soft-serve gelato with a number of delicious toppings for dessert - my only complaint is that it's served in a small juice glass, so the topping to ice cream ratio is off.  Would be better in a bowl.  I also had a glass of Lieu Dit rose.  Although their alcohol offerings aren't vast, they have a very quality selection - both with respect to the sources and the diversity.  I enjoyed my glass of wine very much!\n\nThe service issue wasn't with the people - everyone was nice, service was efficient, and the food came out quickly.  It was just TOO quick.  They operate under a mentality of - we serve the food whenever it's ready...but that only works to a point.  I understand if one person's entree is ready a little faster, they get it first....but for our meal, my boyfriend got his salad and pasta simultaneously, then I got my pasta five minutes later, then I got my salad another 5 minutes after that.  Then, the beets came out probably after another five minutes.  So, we wound up with a ton of food to eat all at once, and my pasta started getting cold as I was trying to get through the salad - so I really just ended up speed-eating.  Not as relaxing as it could be.\n\nAnyway, minus the latter issue, the food and atmosphere are awesome and I'm sure we'll be back!", "author": "Tay H."}

I normally would never order chicken at a restaurant. Never. But the host talked so highly about it and said \"if you don't like it, we'll give you the porchetta for free instead.\" Well, in that case we'll try the chicken and we loved it. The chicken was juicy and the side of mustard and aioli that came with it was perfect. There is also a hot chili oil at the table, drizzle that shit on everything. Also, don't leave without trying one of their gelato. Even if you are stuffed from all the pasta, you need to make room for the gelato. Trust.", "author": "Cindy A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-08-23", "description": "tldr; there's a lot of hype around this place right now, and I was really excited to try it out. Unfortunately, the pasta that we got was really mushy and moist... and just not tasty at all. I would rather pay a little bit more money to ensure a delicious bowl of pasta than less money for a mediocre one\n\nThis place was such a bummer for me. I thought it looked super promising on Yelp, Eater, etc. The SO and I decided to stop by on a Sunday for lunch. Barzotto offers a fast casual pasta concept that is much needed in SF, city of overpriced pasta. You pay at the table, grab a seat, and fresh pasta is delivered to you fairly quickly for a sit down restaurants. Items are priced fairly reasonably (sub $15 for a pasta dish), so compared to other more upscale city options, Barzotto is in a great range for some pretty unique, thoughtfully created pasta options relative to a simple tagliatelle with marinara or something.\n\nAnyways, we ordered the cresta di gallo, strozzapreti, and turkey meatballs. The turkey meatballs came out first and were good, though I guess I'm not a fan of turkey meatballs since the texture makes it a lot mushier and grainier than I would like. That's fine. That wasn't the problem.\n\nThe real problem and bummer for me was in the pasta. Both of our pasta dishes were cooked way past al dente. When the pasta itself isn't cooked well, it's hard for the dish to stand out. Each pasta was mushy and moist... not a combo one is looking for in their pasta. In terms of the flavors, while I was intrigued by the cresta di gallo flavors, but the strozzapreti was a real interesting one that didn't work well for me flavor wise. It seemed like the anchovies were crushed and basically baked so the strozzpreti was kind of like a pizza. It was okay to eat, but not particularly standout. Both dishes also looked a bit sloppy, but maybe I'm being unfair since this is supposed to be fast casual. I dunno. \n\nOverall, I'm just bummed that the pastas were cooked so poorly. Maybe it was because it was the lunch service? Not sure. I might consider coming back if they change their menu, but I think I'm going to wait until they're open a bit longer. Am assuming the mushy pasta was more of an operational problem rather than a technical one.", "author": "Jasmine X."}

It's a cute and charming little spot, where you order first at the counter at the front and then find your own seat afterwards. We chose a bar area that overlooks the sous chefs chopping lots of beautiful yellow cauliflower. \nI ordered a glass of the sparkling Lambrusco (aka sparkling red wine) and I'd say it was one of my favorite glasses of wine I've had in awhile! I loved it!  My husband ordered another glass of red, and then we each got a pasta dish and shared the porchetta.  Hubby ordered the extra long spaghetti with turkey meatballs - the texture and chew factor of those noodles was superb, and I loved the flavor of the turkey meatballs, which is difficult to do with turkey!  I ordered the Snail Shells which was topped with a tasty marinara and fun globs of creamy ricotta!  The porchetta was pretty fantastic - all of the accoutrements along the side were outstanding and the juicy pork perfectly complimented it's crispy exterior!\nFinally, we had the local honey and sea salt gelato, which is really just vanilla soft serve gelato topped with lottts of honey and a tad bit of sea salt. I'll be honest and say that vanilla ice cream isn't my favorite to begin with, so that might have affected my opinion here, but this was unfortunately the weaker part of our meal. The gelato was very melty so we had to eat it fast, there was much too much honey, and I was hoping for a bit more flavor in the gelato itself.

The reason why I give this restaurant 3 stars is because the pasta didn't have the normal consistency of homemade pasta.

We ordered the mixed green salad, ribbons, cockscomb, and extra long noodles pasta, and the porchetta board. The portions were just right, considering this was pretty heavy! My favorite was the porchetta, as the skin was super crispy, and I really enjoyed it with the cherry mostarda that came with it. The extra long spaghetti was good too.

Yes, the bread, it's to die for - comes toasted and warm...crunchy perfection on the outside and buttery softness on the inside.

We went with the Radiators and the Pierced Noodles. I love a good cacio e pepe and this one was fairly good! It was a little on the heavy side for me but the flavors and seasoning were great.

Flavors and textures are expressed simply, again like a home cooked meal. Each dish makes you somehow feel warm and comfortable. I noticed some reviewers are underwhelmed by the fact that the dishes aren't \"wow\" in your face. Home style pasta isn't supposed to do that.\n\nI suggest bringing some friends and going family-style, picking up a small of each pasta dish as well as a side of the beats with ricotta and veal meatballs (don't skip the beats!).

Best customer service, warm hospitality, and clean creative Italian pasta dishes makes me think this brand new restaurant looks like home!  I went inside near the entrance a few times just to look at very cute unique pasta shapes.  This time, I came here for lunchtime the very first time.  Not bad seeing the narrow walkway towards the end of the dining area.  Though the seats look and feel comfortable enough, I could see the chefs in the cooking station making pasta.  Of course, I would decide to buy a package of pasta to go for just $5.\n\nInstead of waiter service which it takes a waiter to come to my table, I get to order food and drink and give cash to the cashier.   Excellent!!  Now I have nothing to worry about paying later!  Just like back in Veganburg, except I wait for the food to come.    Let's see, I had San Pellegrino Flavored Water, my gluten free pasta dish, and Cabbage & Kale.  No need for a gelato; I'd head to Arizmendi next door for some dessert.  I thought I wanted the Italian spritzer in a tall glass, but I never thought I had a canned blood orange soda.  For my pasta dish, I had gluten free...strozzapreti?  I thought about having gluten free version of Lumache Snails, ones that are among other shaped colored pastas in the see through glass as I pictured them.  (Sigh) At least what I had is gluten free, which is way better than the egg flavored version.  Those so called \"priest stranglers\" were chewy even in tomato sauce seasoned with parmesan and topped with ricotta cream.  No matter how small the whole portion in the dish, it looked and taste good in one piece.  Cabbage and Kale looked and taste excellent as well.  With the right amount of ginger vinaigrette and some crispy lentils, these colorful greens are ready to show its edibility.\n\nI'm glad I've chosen BARZOTTO in my must-visits.  They have some varieties of unique colorful shaped pastas.  Why go for same old spaghetti, lasagna, or ravioli when I'm on a hunt for other different kinds?

You order at the counter, seat yourself, and even grab your own water from the self-serve station. For such a low key environment, I thought the pasta was still very high quality. \n\nAll of the pastas I tried (the spaghetti, the bucatini, the fazzoletti) were all fresh and perfectly cooked, with lots of rich sauces, cheese, or meats to accompany them. Add an egg on any of them for $2 extra and you won't regret it! I noticed that they also sell fresh and dry pastas and jars of sauce to take out, which I would highly recommend for those who are trying to impress someone by pretending to be a fabulous home cook. The little gem salad was also delightful. \n\nThe one dish that didn't impress me was the board with the half chicken and pickled veggie condiments. I just didn't think the chicken was that flavorful or tender. I don't eat pork but the photos I've seen of the pork board seemed much more impressive, so I'd recommend giving that a shot. \n\nThe space is very simple and clean - pretty much your typical modern, trendy SF spot - but really all you need to know about is the pasta.

Maybe, it should have been a bit expected since this was an order at the counter, self-serve type restaurant. \n\nFirst off, we put our name down on the waitlist clipboard after another party and waited just right outside. After 10 minutes, we kept seeing people walking in and being seated at a table right away by a host so we went in to inquire and he said all the tables were taken and there was only first come, first serve bar seating left... Fine, we'll deal. \n\nI was really in between two pastas and when we were ready to go up and order, I told him that it was my first time here and what I was in between and if he could make a suggestion or feel free to just surprise me. The first thing that came out of the very same person who wasn't paying any attention to the waitlist clipboard was that he was busy and didn't have time for this... Lol ok, I was so taken aback from his response that I went with the safe route and spaghetti it was. That wasn't just it though, from this particular host. My friend tried to pay with a $100 bill and the same guy said he was too busy to get change, but my friend didn't have his debit card on him. Gee, too busy to handle money at a restaurant?! What an outrageous request... Mind you, the restaurant wasn't bustling with people waiting out the door or anything...\n\nOk now... aside from that, the food was amazing. My party of 4 all got different pastas and we tasted each of one another's and it is definitely worth going back to... but, I think we'll opt out for delivery or take-out instead which they seem to be huge on. It's well-portioned, sauce to meat ratio is on point, and the flavor is just bursting through the noodles. Pricy? Kind of expected for SF, but even more so annoying with the experience we had there. It's definitely worth trying and the food itself will earn another visit from me the next time that I'm in town.", "author": "Kathy L."}

The pasta itself was actually pretty tasty but I left still kinda hungry, so for that amount of money I think that's wack.

Tip:  order a few things only and then order from the servers the noodles when you are really ready to eat them or else everything comes at once and the noodles get cold and it's really hard to enjoy food when it is cold.  The roasted pork (porchetta) platter seems to be on every table except ours.  Good thing I didn't see the yelp photos or else I would have ordered that.  What called out was the kale and cabbage salad with fried lentils, very light on dressing, the way I like it.  It was so hardy.  The beets ($7) were wonderful, reminds me of a dessert than a side with a few dallops of fresh ricotta cheese, sprinkle of pistachio (which you really can't taste).  We got two pastas:  the beef pappardelle (Ribbons. Slow braised beef, mushroom, parmesan) was so rich in flavor and the long spaghetti had very fresh clams (a bit of a spicy zing) was okay and el dente. The total bill $72.00 with tax and tips.  You pick the portion size: small or regular with a difference by a few dollars.  Get according to your appetite! We got the small pappardelle and large spaghetti. Small actually was enough, but when you are hungry, you just can't control yourself. I like the ambiance but not the \"rock\" background music, which didn't quite fit into the atmosphere.  The music rattled and was unnerving rather than give the relaxing zen enjoyment of food feeling.  They have ice cream sundaes which we skipped since we were full.

I'll update my review when I come back :)\n\nI also didn't like that they charge for bread...and you only get two small pieces of focaccia. It's good focaccia, don't get me wrong, but I guess after having dated an Italian guy way back when, I've been trained to be salty when bread is not complimentary.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-14", "description": "[Out-of-Towner Review]\n\nCarb seeking, carb eating!\n\nHeading to the City the evening before the Giant Race, we shopped until we were carb depleted. We set to Yelp to see what pasta slangin' place was near us or looked delicious! Unfortunately, SF has plenty of highly rated 'pasta' spots, so we were at a loss. I decided we should try out one that was listed under \"Hot and New.\"\n\nThis little spot is right between a corner gas station, at the end of a building on a street. It's small, don't blink, you may miss it. The vibe is really cute and laid back, dark, yet relaxed. The signage outside made me laugh, because it was too fitting for my life! As we walked in, we noticed how small this place was, another surprise. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I don't think this was it. That's not to say that it was a bad thing, just more of a preface to where my mind was.\n\nThis is one of those places that runs a little differently than a traditional restaurant. You order at the counter, you get a little geo tracker (might be a slight exaggeration), TRY to find a seat, then your food is delivered. Lucky for us, right before we ordered a couple left and ran to snag our seat, so we could order without hoping to find a seat. Our backup plan was to order to-go if we couldn't get a seat, but we did :)\n\nEven though the place is somewhat small, they have a variety of seating. They have bar style seating that outlooks the front window and also that can look into the kitchen area. They have high tables and regular tables for various sizes of parties. I think they are also set up with a few tables where parties can share the tables. We enjoyed a two top right along the wall with a cute light above us. Their purse hooks are genius, right in the middle, beneath the table. It was perfect, it never hit either of us under the table and was perfectly out of the way, not on the ground. It's the little things.\n\nLike I said, the menu is not that large. I went with the Spaghetti, side of Turkey Meatballs, and the House Made Focaccia. J was adventurous and went with the Italian Ramen. Yup, you read that correctly! They were trying something new and it seemed like a cool concept. They also had dessert on the menu and I really wanted to try it, but I wasn't sure our stomachs could handle all that food. That's the problem with pre-ordering and paying for your meal, you don't get to order as you please. Also, I think it's weird to tip on service before you receive it. Especially since I didn't know exactly how the joint was ran -- do I get my food somewhere, do they serve me and never check on our table?\n\nWe each ordered a glass of Cab Sav, which was $10 or we could have went with a bottle for $40. They don't have a large variety of wines, but they have one of each of the basics. We were splurging, so we went for it! After I paid, they poured our glasses for us and I carried them back to the table.\n\nCome to find out they hand out little trackers, that look like traditional restaurant buzzers, but cooler that also can tell the employees where you are sitting. They looked like little space age disks. There was a water station for self-service, they also had small plates and additional utensils there if you needed them.\n\nI really enjoyed the handmade pasta, it was dense and plenty in quantity. I also enjoyed that their spaghetti was a cheese base, not a red sauce base. It was simple and delicious. I will say, the red sauce that comes with the focaccia and the meatballs has some heat. Again, we all know I'm a wimp, so my mouth was on fire, but I kept eating it because it was tasty. I wanted to eat the two squares of focaccia all to myself, but I shared. J's Italian Ramen looked gorgeous, plated very lovely. However, it wasn't his favorite dish -- he did enjoy the fact that they had fired pork skin inside and the house made noodles were good. He just would have preferred a different broth, they used a chicken broth to keep with the Italian vibe. We both enjoyed the meatballs, even though their flavoring left something to be desired. More than anything I felt the heat of the red sauce, rather than any seasoning to the meatballs. Their portion size is very generous, which I can appreciate.\n\nAfter we were done, the owner, Marco, happened to wander by and ask us about our dinner. Mainly he wanted to know about the Italian Ramen. J told him the truth about how he felt about it. We also learned they are only 3 weeks new and still working on things. He took the corrective criticism like a professional and said that they might try a different broth to bring out more flavor to the dish. He did confirm the red sauce has heat, so I knew I wasn't crazy ;) I can totally appreciate how this owner runs his business. He cares about his customers, his food, and his aesthetics. It wasn't our favorite, but it was a great experience overall!\n\nIt's worth a try and it still has room to grow to become better!", "author": "Steph G."}

My pasta dish wasn't that great though. I had the braised beef pappardelle and it was bland. Salt and pepper didn't help it. My friends had the chorizo pasta. One with the regular pasta finished and she loved it, the gluten free choice did not. The best part of the whole night (and the reason it's such a high rating) is the gelato. We shared the coffee one and the caramel/chocolate. Delicious. The gelato saved the night. Would come again for salads and gelato.", "author": "Diana G."}

It's good for a third or fourth date since it's pretty quick and relatively inexpensive. Or come with a friend or significant other for a casual meal - you'll be in and out in an hour and it's pretty easy to get a table, so its nice.\n\nThey have 5 different types of pastas, some salads, and ice cream for dessert. It's a pretty simple menu, but you should be able to find something to suit everyone's tastes. You order at the counter, get a number for your table, and they will bring the food out to you. The food comes pretty quickly, usually within 10-15 min. You can also get fresh or dried pasta to go if you'd like.\n\nI got the bucatini pasta, which had a tomato sauce and pancetta. The noodles were nice and al dente, but the sauces were not overly complicated. Very similar to traditional Italian dishes, the ingredients were minimal so that all the flavors could come out. I wouldn't necessarily say it was the best pasta I've ever had, but it was a solid pasta. Portion size was fine, but slightly on the smaller side than the larger side.\n\nI didn't really care for the focaccia too much ($4 for 2 pieces, with a side of marinara sauce), but that's me. Good place for a fast-casual meal, and I'd come again if I were in the area, but wouldn't make come out of my way to come here, or wait more than 20 min to eat here.", "author": "Christina L."}

For the price point of living in the mission-- this is a fairly affordable meal. Sort of like an upscale Noodles & Company. So you order upfront when you walk in, and they give you a buzzer so they can track where you sit and bring your food to you. There's also alcohol here so it really is a great place to just sit with friends and eat and drink!\n\nDuring presidential debates, they have a special takeout package too! Also come on Sundays or Mondays after 5:30-- daily special is Italian ramen with their famous porchetta-- delicious! \n\nWe had their focaccia which I thought was a bit expensive for two pieces- but super delicious and full of flavour. Wish they offered a bigger chunk. \nMy BF and I have only had the pastas and specials here so we can't speak to the meat dishes-- however, I really enjoyed the large chunk of porchetta in the Italian ramen! It was super good, though I found that the ramen could use more broth and more noodles for the price point. Portion sizing here though is enough to satiate.

Without ya'll, we totally would've missed this place. Lol I had to keep looking up directions even though it's just up the street from my house to find it.\n\nLoooveed the ambiance of this place--rap in the background and freshly made pasta? Yes, yes, yes! Not even sure why'd you go to Flour + Water when Barzotto is around. \n\nI felt that seating was plentiful and cozy. And the food was absolutely amazing. We got the panchetta, extra pickles, baked polenta, and pappardelle. Birthday boy loved the crispy on the outside and moist on the inside panchetta. Came with two delightful sauces, one tangy and one sweet to hit all of your flavor buds. Extra pickles were a medley of vegetables with the right amount of zest. Polenta melted in our mouths combined with pesto, red sauce, and burrata. \n\nHands down, best pappardelle I have ever tried. I normally refuse to pay for pasta bc I'm just like lol why pay when you can do it yourself at home, but this is soooo worth the $$$$. Like the polenta, it melted in your mouth and was so delicious. My boyfriend thought it was boiled with parmesan and other tasty things because of how much flavor it packed. \n\nWe were full after eating half of what we ordered, but it was so frikkin' good, we ate it all.\n\nAlso loved that we got to order up front, and the food came out in great time.

I'm a salad lover but this was just a-okay. It was boring and not well-balanced. I normally devour salads if they're good. Wouldn't get this again. Too blah.\n\n2. The focaccia. 2/5. Tasty enough I suppose, but we have other places we frequent that provide much better bread for free (complementary with meal, that is). In terms of cost/value, this was really a 1 or 0 out of five. $4 for two small pieces of focaccia and way more sauce than could properly be sopped up by said amount of bread? Meh. They must be wasting a lot of the tomato sauce unless they provide additional focaccia for free (no idea if they do).\n\n3. The pasta with beef. We ordered the larger portion and although it didn't look that big, I was stuffed to the point of being in a food coma after three bites. Very tasty. 4.5/5.\n\n4. The half chicken. Aesthetically exquisite per Yelp pics and why I wanted to try Barzotto in the first place, but the flavors ultimately didn't appeal to me. It was very tender and cooked well but I wasn't a fan in terms of how it actually tasted. 2/5 for the flavor; 4/5 for presentation and tenderness. 3/5 overall. Wouldn't order again unless they change the recipe to taste better. \n\nFinally, even though I wasn't a big fan of the food, I planned ahead and ordered efficiently, unlike the couple ahead of us, who apparently were completely unfamiliar with the menu and asked umpteen questions despite the line behind them. \n\nPlease don't be those people. I'm a patient person but my patience was put to the test and them some :P. We took less than a minute to order what the couple in front of us spent 5-10 minutes ordering. Blargh. \n\nFWIW, I get the concept behind places like Barzotto, Souvla, Media Noche, etc., (e.g. fast casual/fancy), but I can't say that I genuinely enjoy the experience of going to said places.

The pasta is so good, I feel a bit weird when I just spent $17 for a bowl of what I would call... pretty exquisite pasta and I'm in and out of there in 15 mins. \n\nThis is because of their take-out style ordering system. You order at the counter and you take your tag and sit down. The food comes out usually in 5 mins. \n\nI have no problem with fast food... but I feel like the food is so good, it is deserving of a slower pace.  Maybe enjoy it with an app. Some waiter service. Slow it down and enjoy the meal. \n\nSomeone said that the chef is from Flour + Water, which is great. Because I've never been able to go to Flour + Water because I could never get a reservation.

The ravioli, although delicious, was not filling whatsoever. Come on, $1 a ravioli seems crazy to me.\nTo their credit, when pointed out, they did try to correct it by offering complimentary dishes. We didn't take them up on it, but the friendly staff and delicious food is the reason I'm still giving a four star rating despite having little desire to return.", "author": "Jessica G."}

You probably don't know me, but if you did, you'd know that I don't leave pieces of pork on the table. We left over half of our porchetta board on the table, and even dissuaded people in line from ordering it. It wasn't good, at least not tonight. The meaty bits were dry, and the fatty bits were gristly. I actually added salt from the salt shaker... something slow cooked pork should NEVER need. \n\nOur pasta was... pasty! There was a clear imbalance of flavors, or the pasta was cooked too long, it was hard to tell which. Also, all of the wait staff pronounced it guy-oh, which is the spanish pronunciation, but not the Italian. The Italian salad honestly tasted like something you could find at your run of the mill salad bar, even at, *gasp* Domino's. There was really nothing original about it.  I know it was the 3rd day, but things were not going well. The woman pouring wine seemed to know what she was doing, but the gentleman taking orders and ringing people up was just... he didn't know much about food or wine. He couldn't even pronounce montepulciano, which may seem snobbish of me to mention, except that there are only 3 reds by the glass on the menu. \n\nAlas, I hope this place survives, since I've been hankering for a good neighborhood joint since Heart Wine Bar left the space years ago.

In the latter case the pasta was not coated properly in the sauce so the ribbons stick to each other and clump up, meaning half of the bites are composed of bland, plain pasta. All pasta has the possibility of sticking together/clumping but given the large surface area of the pappardelle ribbons it is extremely apparent and really hampers the dish. In addition my dish came out about ten minutes after the rest of my table (it was a three top). The service is kind of absent for the most part but I understand the restaurant does not employ waitstaff and a host/hostess the same way most traditional restaurants do. Unfortunately this meant there was no opportunity to explain the disappointing pappardelle.\n\nI would recommend ordering pappardelle only when the restaurant is very empty, otherwise the pasta won't get the attention it deserves. I thought the meatballs were a decent value, though. I love fresh pasta and I think the concept is great so I'll probably give them another chance (by ordering a different pasta than pappardelle).", "author": "Henry T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-03-28", "description": "There is a problem with San Francisco restaurants serving tiny bowls of overpriced pasta.  I was really excited for this place which was supposed to solve this problem.   I have been twice now, and instead of fixing it, it's only perpetuating the problem.\n\nThe restaurant is \"fast casual\" aka counter service.  I actually like the idea of this - less service should mean lower prices, for still great food.  But when the restaurant just charges \"normal\" prices combined with way too small portions, the entire experience feels like a rip-off.  \n\nMy wife and I had:\nSnails - in tomato sauce with ricotta $13\nGrills - with sausage, broccolini, burrata $16\n\"Main\"- farmers market vegetables $15\n\nTo be clear - we deliberately over-ordered, expecting a generous bowl of pasta complemented by some vegetables.  Everything we ordered was undersized by about 30-40%.  Throwing extra noodles in the pot costs ---maybe---an extra dime, but instead they serve what looks visually lacking.  We ate everything and unfortunately left quite hungry.  \n\nThe total price with tax and a (small) tip came to $54.  That's not super expensive for a nice dinner out - but this isn't supposed to be that! It's intended to be a fast casual place you can grab a reasonably high quality, quick-ish dinner at a feel good price.  The reality is that it's about as expensive as a normal restaurant.  Being served tiny portions of pasta at a fast-casual restaurant is insulting.\n\nAs comparison, the large sized spaghetti w/ tomato at Delfina is $16 - and is legitimately dinner sized.  They even have a small size for $11, which is about what we received at Barzotto.  I'd rather pay $3 extra dollars for an actual dinner at an actual restaurant --- not to mention the difference in quality between the food at Delfina and Barzotto.\n\nCreating a great restaurant shouldn't be that hard.  Simple advice: underprice and overdeliver.  Instead, Barzotto is overpriced and underdelivers.  It's too bad - the potential is there.", "author": "Daniel W."}

They give you a GPS gizmo of some sort that allows them to find you and deliver your order.  You pick up water from a large tank just beyond the entry.  If this seems a bit awkward, it may well be.

You won't be able to have courses delivered one at a time in a specified order.  \n\nFazzoletti came with braised beef and mushrooms.  The pasta was a bit overcooked and stuck together.

The place is where the St Vincent, and before that Heart wine bar used to be, and they've put some nice changes into it.  You order at the counter, then they give you a buzzer and bring your food to you...fast.  We got the bucatini with pancetta and the turkey meatballs.  My son also got an orange juice.   My son said the bucatini was tasty \"but had some hard Chewy bits in it.\"  I would agree, the pasta was a little bit over cooked, but the pancetta was very chewy not crisp, ditto the bread crumbs.  I did not have a problem eating it all however.  The turkey meatballs \"were legit\" according to my 11 year old.   They were large and moist and tasty, with bits of spinach inside, which made me feel like a better mom.  After dinner we decided to split a \"gelato sundae\" which was really vanilla soft serve with a squirt of caramel and a scoop of those Callebaut \"crispearls\" in top.  It was creamy but \"kind of tasted like nothing.\"  The topping ran out almost immediately, and we were left eating vanilla.  So, was it good?  Overall it was kind of expensive for what it was.  $40 to split a small entree, side dish, soft serve and tiny oj in a restaurant that is counter service.  So I'd agree with my son that it was 3.8 stars, but will kick it to four, because there were some nice thoughtful touches in the experience.  Share plates and water you could grab yourself.  Thick napkins and big hooks under the table.  Friendly and fast service, and if you sit at the counter you can watch them making the pasta.

So I got my wine, and sat in the window to enjoy it. The windows were open and the lights were on outside, it was misty and romantic. And then the staff started turning off lights, putting chairs on tables, shutting down the place, right around me, and other customers still at tables. I get it, it's almost closing time. But we were all nearly done. 10 minutes wouldn't have hurt and would have been so much friendlier. \n\nThis made it impossible to ignore what happened last night. I stopped for takeout on my way to a resistance postcard writing party. I ordered, and was recommended to the special gnocchi. I paid: $19.44 after taxes and tip. For one dish, to take away. Which was fine, until I opened the lid and realized I was paying about $1.15 per gnocchi. They were delicious. But I was still starving when I finished. It was too expensive.

This was just disappointing- there was no flavor other than the broth. *They should put a note at the bottom: \"Tastes like chicken noodle soup.\" A positive note however, was that the texture of the noodles was excellent.

I didn't realize you order at a \"counter\" but still has a restaurant feel which is nice. We started with two glasses of wine, decent size pours for $10 which I can appreciate, and the focaccia bread. For our meals, I scoped out other yelpers orders and pics so I knew what we were getting - started with a small little gems salad (perfect splitting for two), the porchetta and the bells pasta. The salad was so delicious, perfectly dressed and I want to recreate it immediately! The porchetta was so delicious, perfectly cooked and the tangy crispy vegetables on the side paired really well. The pasta, however, was kinda meh. The bells pasta included with braised hen and radish and we both oddly thought it tasted like Thanksgiving dinner. I didn't get a lot of other flavors or textures besides the hen and the pasta. Just because I live far across town not sure if I would initiate another trip but if you're in the neighborhood I think it's a great spot for casual dining with a nice ambience.", "author": "Aryn C."}

Their portions have improved dramatically, the take out experience is more streamlined, and their rotation of seasonal pasta dishes seems to get more and more delicious each time (my current favorite is their bucatini, with a delicious and creamy sauce made of cherry tomatoes, garlic, and squash). Their salads are also really fresh, and usually with an interesting, creative twist (pickles, yogurt, sesame seeds, and radish in a salad? It works!) \n\nI also really like the dine-in experience too - it's casual, but in a sort of casually swanky way. I've also enjoyed their wine selections so far.\n\nThat said, I still think their pasta dishes are overpriced, but less egregiously now that you get more food. I'm guessing this is in large part because they make their own pasta fresh and in-house, and that labor is expensive, but I think the price is still a bit disappointing given how simple the ingredients in most of their dishes are (e.g. tomatoes, onions, and garlic are not exactly known for being the most expensive of produce). I still find it sort of tragic that they don't serve bread to your table like every other Italian restaurant I've been to, but that may be more a consequence of the \"fast casual\" style - you only ever get exactly what you ordered. I've also experienced a few off nights, where dishes that usually come out delicious came out not terribly well executed, and also a few dishes that didn't quite work for me (their \"Italian Ramen\", for instance, I thought was quite bland, and the egg they added was undercooked).\n\nBut!

Order at the counter, pasta focused, reasonably priced wine.  They're open all day, which is nice, but they don't take reservations. However, at 6pm on a Saturday, we were able to get a table without any problems.\n\nWines: 3 sparkling wines, 3 whites, 3 roses, 3 reds, mostly Italian. We went with one fro Piedmont, which was very light and easy to drink.  All are $40 a bottle.\n\nFood: family style\n- Focaccia: nice crust on top, but the highlight was the tomato sauce, which tasted liked it was made from fresh tomatoes\n- Farmer's market veggies: not cheap for some vegetables, but it's a beautiful presentation on a nice board with lots of colorful produce. I could have done without the aioli underneath, but I like the fish sauce based sauce (same as the one with the pork)\n- Porchetta board: with giardiniera, an applesauce sort of sauce, and the fish sauce based herb sauce in the vegetable board. The pork had a nice crust on it, but the inside was a bit dry. Flavor was good \n- Bucatini: texture wise, this was my favorite. It's like hollowed out spaghetti, so it holds the sauce and has a good bite. The sauce is breadcrumbs, pancetta, and tomato; definitely wipe up any leftover sauce with focaccia \n- Fazzoletti: like super white paparadelle with a braised beef and mushroom sauce, lots of parmesan. This one was nice and hearty\n- Cresta di gallo: the most interesting shape (like a cock's comb). It came with cauliflower and a creamy sauce, topped with almonds for crunch. This was an interesting pasta and was a good vegetarian option\n- Italian ramen: special of the night. The broth was legit, and it had lots of chicken and a nice soft cooked egg. The pasta was actually very similar to ramen \n\nFood comes out pretty quickly, and the servers will bus your table for you even though when you order it's just at the counter.  \n\nI'm a sucker for pasta, and I like that it's very no frills.", "author": "Marilyn H."}

Today, I decided to stop in, with a friend, and try it out.  It was just okay in my opinion.  I found nothing special about either pasta we tried.  The snail shells were a bit overcooked.  The accompanying marinara sauce was bland.  I did detect a hint of lemon zest though.  The ricotta seemed to eb added to every dish. The pork meatballs were dull as were the beets. To charge $4 for two small piece is foccacia is just wrong.  I mean, one could get an entire loaf next door for the same price.  I also objected to charge $4 for a San Pellegrino, and then to have only one flavor?  How hard it is to go to Costco and get other flavors?  I asked for a small portion but was given a large for my pasta.  I did not notice until we left that I had been charged so.  Not even in Italy does two pasta dishes and some beets end up costing $43.  I will not return to this place.  While the service was excellent, the prices are ridiculously high.  One is better off getting a slice of pizza next door.  Wish I had stayed away a little longer.  Live and Learn.", "author": "James S."}

After ordering at the counter and finding a seat for ourselves, my fellow diner and I waited mere minutes for our appetizers (a beautiful though underspoken Little Gem salad and house-made focaccia bread) to arrive, followed in short succession by our pasta (Pappardelle in a savoury slow-roasted beef sauce) and entree (half a roasted chicken accompanied by a sun-dried tomato pesto and assorted house pickles).

I came here upon recommendation from my good friend Marielisa who is  a prominent pastry chef and  Barzotto was started by one of her friends. Barzotto is in the former Saint Vincent space. \nLast night, my gf and I came here for dinner. The space is beautiful, modern with high ceilings. I like the order-up-front-take-a-number concept because it feels casual in one sense but the beautiful space makes the experience a little more upscale than say \"the grove.\" Tables are marble, lights dim,  restaurant packed with with wine glasses and conversation buzz. The experience was previously well-thought-out  as the tables are dressed with salt/pepper grinders and chili oil and servers are buzzing around and  were very attentive to diners. They have a simple but decent selection of wine (9, if I recall correctly). We ordered 2 pastas (albeit gluten free) and 2 glasses of wine. Both wine pasta paired well but I have to say the main event, the pasta was exceptional. I haven't had such delicious tasting gluten free pasta since before I developed this allergy. Its not just the fact they had the gf option, or that  the pasta was homemade and shaped such that sauce would adhere to its surface, but it was the flavors that dressed the pasta which took the cake. \nWe ordered a pancetta and tomato bucatini and the cauliflower/lemon pasta. \nBucatini: Legit, you one can taste the sweet pancetta and the hit of rich tomato. They did a great job balancing a little hit of acid to cut the pancetta fat/flavor. \n\nCauliflower pasta: excellent, it had clean lemon finish, slight hint of garlic or chive. Creamy but not heavy, great texture with cauliflower and what I think were peanuts instead of breadcrumbs. I know this sounds strange but it was awesome. (they should probably inform diners who order the GF pasta that there are peanuts on top, just a suggestion, it was OK with me).\n\n\nAll in, I'm happy this restaurant has opened up nearby and I will come again.

The food is so incredibly flavorful and fresh, and the taste of even simple pasta dishes and salads is uniquely delicious, different in the best way without deviating too much from the basics.  Lots of small details add up to make this an amazing dining experience.  Atmosphere here is fun and a great balance of casual and stylish.", "author": "Paul M."}

The pasta is fresh and amazing, the desserts divine and the atmosphere was fun with great music - and great wine!   I highly recommend this restaurant.   The chicories salad was great and very refreshing.  We also had the Ribbons - pasta with braised beef - we fought over the last bite.  The Cock's Comb -  pasta with cauliflower, almond, lemon, etc - was wonderful.   Turkey meatballs were perfectly done.  We were enjoying ourselves so much we ordered two desserts - which were both heavenly - Nitro chocolate with Mint and the Salted Carmel with chocolate.   Perfect!", "author": "Jamaize S."}

The food is insane and I love how you order first and then find a table verses waiter/waitress status. The wine lists pairs so well with the pastas. The MEATBALLS... The MEATBALLS! Best ones I have had in SF (I've had my fair share) and the bucatini is nuts. I love this place and can't wait to return!", "author": "M Q."}

Both were great, I love how the sauce is so flavorful but not overpowering. This place lets the pasta itself be the hero.  I can't wait to try all the other pastas. Plus Marko, the owner is one of the warmest and friendliest person I know!", "author": "Matthew T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-09-24", "description": "This place is very underwhelming. The service was subpar as we saw a lot of wait staff walking back and forth from the kitchen to the front of the restaurant, but not very observant regarding refills of water, removing of plates, or how they could assist customers, etc.. The food was disappointing. The portions are so small, and the focaccia bread was some of the worst I have had - it was like a dried up piece of bread. I also do not think the idea of \"bringing out food as it is ready\" works with pasta dishes. For several tables, food was being cleared while other main courses were yet to be served. And the gelato is like custard - I don't know how they can call it gelato. We will not be back. We are used to paying a lot for food in SF, but this place was really overpriced!", "author": "Jean E."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-22", "description": "Been only once. I grew up in un Rome where two of the dishes we had come from. The Cacio e Pepe was excellent. It is an astonishingly simple dish that is equally difficult to pull off and takes practice. No butter, no cream - just cheese and hot water and they got the creaminess just right. The Bucatini alla Amatriciana were also very good, maybe a little bit over sauced which is a shame as the pasta itself is what should shine.  Only disappointment was they could have slightly larger portions as one dish was not enough as an only meal. Would have been fine as a \"Primo\" but that would presume they would have a selection of \"secondi\" on the Menu and they don't. Will be going back", "author": "Alex N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-21", "description": "Tried Barzotto since it is in our neighborhood and  was pleasantly surprised. Highlights were the non-pasta dishes. The porchetta and the half chicken were really delicious, beautifully presented and the phrase \"condiments\" in no way did justice to the pickles/lettuce/ grilled lemon/ good sauces that accompanied each of the above. Given today's ever-escalating prices both seemed a very good value. \"Winner, winner chicken [and porchetta] dinners.\" We also ordered a large kale/ cabbage salad was reasonably sized and plenty for three-way sharing. Finally, we ordered the cockscomb pasta which was OK, but undersized for the price, especially in comparison to the other things. Food 41/2 stars and non-pasta value 41/2 stars. What we didn't like: The service model. You order up front either immediately on walking in or by getting back up after being seated. I realize this is the wave of the future, and that it saves on staffing costs but in a restaurant, it  really diminishes the whole experience. Finally all of us hated the lighting. It was so dim in the seating area we could not see the fine print on the menus and could not identify the yummy side bits on the plates. Next time we'll know to bring our camping headlights. There will, however, be a next time. Some of the food is too good to pass up and it is 3 blocks from our apartment.", "author": "Jim F."}

The ambience makes it look like a really nice date spot/modern-style pasta bar, but it is actually more like tech lunch room.  It is not a full service restaurant, which means you order at the cash register and pay first.  Then they give you a Red Lobster style tracking device so they can find you to bring the food.  Everything comes out at once, and the quality is definitely not up to par with the pricing (it is cheaper than other \"real\" restaurants, but not by much).  The focaccia bread looked like it came out of a box, and tasted that way too.  The pasta quality itself was good, but the sauces taste like something you could make at home with whatever spices you have on hand (we had the Lumache and the Cresta di Gallo).  The screw-top bottle wines are $10 a bottle, and don't expect more descriptors than \"light,\" \"medium\" or \"full bodied\" as listed on the menu.  And remember, you'll have to get up and go back to the cash register  during your meal if you want a second glass.  I'm sorry to give a lousy review, but with so many great options for Italian to choose from in SF, this is not one of them.", "author": "Mt W."}
