From the moment we entered and was greeted by the host you knew you were in a very classy establishment. \n\nDefinitely choose to sit at the bar facing the chefs if you can. That way you can chat with the chefs and learn way more stuff about the food you are eating and all the effort it takes to procure quality ingredients. \n\nWe had the $200 course and tbh if I was to ever go again, I would probably just pick the $150. The additional stuff you get I'm not sure I would have missed, save maybe the additional toro sashimi which was really good but the fried shrimp head and the wagyu beef sushi I could have passed on. I was so stuffed by the time we left I could barely finish my dessert which was amazing too. I felt bad leaving any of the food behind. \n\nBy far the stand out dish was the uni on rice with roe and gold flakes? I dont even know what it was called but it was amazing. The most decadent dish i have had ever maybe. \n\nHighly recommend for an occasion. The waiters and host were all very polite and friendly. Our chef was the owner and he was extremely entertaining and great to talk to learning about all the ingredients and sharing his experiences.", "author": "Chung H."}

The bff and I have been trying to schedule an omakase experience at Omakase for some time, and I'm so glad we were finally able to coordinate for a special occasion! From beginning to end, the level of service provided was superb. \n\nBut let's back track for a min. As soon as we sat down, I mentioned to the bud that I recognized our sushi chef, Chef Jason. I just couldn't pin point where I'd seen him though bc this was the first visit to Omakase. Well, turns out I'm not crazy and he'd recently come over from Sushi Hon, which was the last spot the bff and I went to grab omakase together! And the experience with Chef Jason at Sushi Hon was superb as well. Sushi Hon's loss is most definitely Omakase's gain!\n\nPersonalized, hand-written cards were ready for us before we even sat down. A lovely touch tbh. And the card was followed by a small glass of birthday sake. Color me impressed. Chef Jason took us through a journey, explaining each piece of fish's origin, the texture, the flavor profile, and his personal touches. Since he's only moved over to Omakase a month ago, he's slowly integrating some of his trainings from NYC (gave me some awesome recos to check out the next time I'm there!) into the existing menu. \n\nOur party opted for the $150 option, but it looked like everyone else went for the $200 (additional sashimi and an extra wagyu dish). We usually like to go thru the slightly cheaper option and choose a few pieces we either want to try again or try that we haven't had yet. Chef Jason ended up choosing for us the amaebi (sweet shrimp) and seared toro (fatty tuna) nigiri pieces. Both of which were amazingly fresh (perfect crunch on the shrimp and buttery goodness on the tuna). \n\nBUT I will say that the smaller sashimi platter we got vs the slightly more expensive menu was a bit of a let down. We only got two types of sashimi - red tuna (good, but nothing special) and smoked white fish (was not particularly a fan of the smoked flavor). In retrospect, we should've gone with the slightly more expensive option. The other patrons got amaebi sashimi (which we wouldn't have had to order), toro sashimi (which, again, we wouldn't have had to order - but ours was seared and AMAZING), and some sort of a whelk sashimi (which looked pretty freaking good). \n\nThroughout the meal, the wait staff was both informative and attentive. The manager also happened to be a high school classmate of ours - shout out to Gary for the wonderful service! As if we weren't impressed by the entire experience already, the staff ended the meal with a personalized dessert candle and a single rose (per person!) as a parting special occasion gift. And a chocolate truffle for the road. \n\nWas it pricey? Yes. About $200+pp. But was it worth it for the occasion? Abso-freaking-lutely! We were handed business cards to check out their other sister restaurant locations. Can't wait to come back or try out other locations. \n\nTop-notch 5 star experience!", "author": "Jennifer L."}

Instead, the sushi rice didn't hold together and fell apart when using a chopstick to pick. This is like the basic technique of making sushi. The chef saw the fallen rice and stared at me like I've done something wrong. He then said I NEED to use my fingers instead of chopsticks, which doesn't make sense. I've been to other places like Kusakabe and Sushi Ran.. I've never had this problem before. The quality of fish is okay but not as favorable as the other two places.\nDisturbing environment - based on yelp, the atmosphere of this place should be intimate upscale, which offers diners an elegant atmosphere with high-quality service. Not sure what happened the entire night. We felt like we were in a low class night club with uneducated drunk people yelling with guffawed noise. The chef invites the atmosphere instead of considering the other guests' comfort zone. On the other hand, while the waiter is very friendly, I suggest him not to get too close when talking to the guests. I could smell the breath coming out from his mouth that was quite unpleasant.\n\nDefinitely won't go back.", "author": "Steph B."}

They will spend years (!) talking about restaurants they want to try, and the amazing food they've had in the past.  I promised them a spectacular meal at a nice restaurant when I had the means to treat, which means I searched far and wide to meet their high expectations.  I knew it was going to be a difficult task.  \n\nOmakase sure delivered!  It blew us away.  Side note: I'm super picky about sashimi, and most of the time I won't even eat it but my Japanese girlfriend would eat it every day if she could.  I knew the place had to be upscale and fresh if I was going to try it, and man, it was good!  The menu is, obviously, all \"omakase style\", which means the menu changes almost daily to accommodate the freshest ingredients. There's 2 menu choices; Hideaki ($150), includes less sashimi and 10 pieces of nigiri, and Yamato ($200) which includes more sashimi, 12 pieces of nigiri and A5 Wagu beef.  My girlfriend opted for the Hideaki because she doesn't eat red meat, and the rest of us got the Yamato.  Her mom got the sake sampler with her meal for an additional $80, more on that later.\n\nI'm not going to go into each and every fish we had, because honestly, I couldn't tell you the names and it changes almost every day anyway.  However, the names of the fish, etc didn't matter, because no matter what I put in my mouth that night, the flavors were beyond memorable.  Hands down, the freshest, tastiest fish I've ever had, sashimi at that, melt in your mouth, leave you wanting more....the BEST.  And, yes, I don't normally like sashimi, but I loved this.  My sushi/sashimi connoisseur family had the same sentiments, and they've eaten at upscale restaurants in Japan.  Don't come here looking for the typical sashimi (sake, hamachi, maguro), because this is top notch in quality and freshness.\n\nMy girlfriend's mom was for sure drunk after her sake sampler, so be prepared for this.  We took little sips, and the sake was like nothing I've ever tasted.  Smooth and flavorful.  It was a good thing all 3 of us didn't order this, or we'd be abandoning the car and catching a ride home.  The sake just adds to the overall experience, but they give you a lot.\n\nThe best things about the restaurant:\n- The service is top notch.  We ate at the sushi bar and I loved the way they served us each, carefully handcrafted before our eyes, piece of nigiri. Make sure to get a seat at the sushi bar, you're seriously missing out on a huge piece of the experience if you sit at the tables.\n- There's no need to add wasabi or soy sauce to any of the nigiri.  It's pre-added so that one bite has everything you could ever want. \n- The sushi chefs.  They are so knowledgeable about the fish (and other ingredients) and they understand the flavors to the T.\n\nOf course I'll be back, everything about this restaurant, including the price, was worth it!", "author": "Ashley S."}

Shout out to Chef Jackson, Chef Tora, Gary & Kiki because they made our entire experience so memorable.

Almost every pair of seats was a little stand with a card. Our own card said \"Happy Anniversary\" with all the chefs signatures and a little doodle by them, which I thought is super sweet and adorable. The dining area is pretty small so we could watch the chefs making sushi from our table. Food was outstanding. They had a unique platter to serve their sushi on.

Came here for a friend's birthday as she loves sushi and the three of us had a great time. It wasn't just the food (which was delicious) but also our sushi chef Taka-san who made it such a memorable experience :)\n\nThere are two seatings per day, one around 5:30 and one around 8-8:30 (they're flexible with your arrival time). We made reservations for 5:30 and were one of the first patrons to arrive. It's a very small and intimate restaurant; there were maybe 12 seats at the sushi bar and another two tables off to the side. It gets booked out so make sure you make your reservation early, especially for the weekend!\n\nThere are two set menus to choose from: the Hideaki ($150) and the Yamato ($200). The main difference between the two is that with the Yamato you get more sashimi and also A5 wagyu. I opted for the Hideaki while both my friends got the Yamato, so it's nice that not everyone in your group has to order the same thing.\n\nThis is what we had:\n-Complimentary sake \n-Amuse bouche of hotaru ika (firefly squid) with mountain yam\n-Eggplant with anchovies and salad\n-Sashimi: lean tuna and amberjack (Yamato comes with pen shell scallop, chutoro, and surf clam as well)\n-Nigiri: karei (Japanese flounder), aji (horse mackerel), ainame (grilled ling), shima aji (striped mackerel), sakura masu (cherry trout)\n~Nigiri break: chawanmushi with Hokkaido uni~\n-Nigiri: kinmedai (golden eye snapper), katsuo (bonito), saba (mackerel) with seasoned sea kelp, ootoro\n-Uni with ikura\n-Tamago\n-Yamato set: A5 wagyu from Yamazaki prefecture with truffle and pickled onion\n-Asari akadashi (red miso soup with clam)\n-Dessert: Panna cotta with mango slice\n\nEverything was pretty solid, but the ootoro really sticks out in my mind as the best thing I ate from this meal, unsurprisingly. It was incredibly rich and fatty, and even though there was a giant lump of wasabi on it, I could barely taste it! The tamago was really interesting as well, as it looked and tasted more like cake but Taka-san swore that there was no flour in it. Very curious.\n\nWe all got a \"present\" of a chocolate truffle to take away. Since it was my friend's birthday, they also wrote her a happy birthday card with some adorable pictures and gave her birthday roses. How sweet!\n\nService was impeccable, as you might imagine from a place like this. They offered to check in my friend's jacket for her, and the moment they noticed I had a small purse on me, they offered a box to put it in. No detail is too small for them to pay attention to. My birthday friend is left handed, so Taka-san placed her nigiri sushi in the opposite direction on the plate so that she could pick it up easier.

We were greeted so politely and the attentive service was shown every minute during our 2 hour time slot there. \n\nWe ordered the Yamato Omakase menu which consisted of a complimentary sake taste, appetizers, sashimi, nigiri, soup, Wagyu beef and dessert.

It was worth the wait and every single penny. The omakase was one of the best I've ever had (and yes, it's even better than a lot of the ones that I tried out in Japan). Everything that came out was delicious. I'm super picky about what types of fish I like/will eat, but I even ate the ones I normally don't like - and they were amazing. The fish was super fresh and it just melted in your mouth. My only regret was not getting some of the add ons and just going for the slightly pricier omakase option. \n\nMy favorite items of the night were definitely the uni with roe, the hamachi, and the monk fish liver. Normally I hate roe because of how fishy it is, but the roe here was marinated so it was sweet and refreshing. It paired perfectly with the giant scoop of uni. Hamachi is my personal favorite fish and so having being served a piece so fresh and so soft, I just couldn't say no. It literally melted in my mouth. The monk fish liver was also marinated and paired perfectly with its accompaniments. \n\nI'll definitely be back here again to try the other omakase option!\n\nCons: \n- Will set you back a paycheck or two... but worth!\n- Not a lot of seats, so it can take up to a few months to get a seating\n\nPros: \n- Everything that was served was well thought out and tasted amazing\n- Fish was super fresh and melted in your mouth\n- Service was impeccable \n- Fun to watch the chefs make your food right in front of you", "author": "Diana C."}

Not sure if this is normal, but only one of the chefs was there when we were there and he was doing all omakese.  I didn't mind this, if it weren't for the fact that it seemed as if his close friends were sitting next to us and we were starting to feel a bit... neglected.  Hard to ask him about dishes we were eating, especially when he was constantly taking shots with his friends as the night wore on (he was a decent shade of pink by the time we finished).  Totally fine with the chef chatting up with friends, though I felt it was somewhat unprofessional watching him take so many shots of sake and pretty much only talk with them- most chefs at other sushi places I've been to had accept a sake glass and wet their lips / sip it over a long period of time and seem to have a better handling of multiple guests.

The $200 version has everything the $150 has with a few additional courses (worth it). What I really loved it they actually have $50 supplements that can be shared with the group and are more unique. On the Friday night we went they had 1. Dragonfish, 2. Uni, 3. Kobe beef ($50 per oz). We chose the Dragonfish and it was amazing!! First of all I never even knew a Dragonfish existed and it really and truly looked like a mini dragon (see picture). Like the dragon sizes of the remaining dragons in Game of Thrones when the dragons were starting to die out!! \n\nThey prepared it three ways: \n1. Sashimi (seared) - it tasted very fatty because they live in Hokkaido where the water is very cold\n2. Fried skin - basically a seafood chicharrone! \n3. Soup - very flavorful and perfect way to end of the meal. \n\nIf the Dragonfish is available I highly recommend it! It's very unique and not something you can find just anywhere. \n\nThe rest of the meal was very delicious with good quality fish.

And we did. The meal was good with some great moments. But there were also some mediocre points and quite a few that were just average and when you combine that with a $270 (w/ tax & tip) price tag, I can't say that it's a place worth seeking out a second time.\n\nCame here with a friend on a Sunday night because it was one of the few higher end sushi restaurants that still had spots open with a week's notice. We were seated at a table and service was great. I would've really liked to speak to the chefs but the waitresses were all very attentive. Our cups were never empty and they didn't mind my incessant note-taking and photographing. We decided to get the $200 Yamato option. Between this and the Hideaki for $150 I would say go for the $200 because my favorite dishes were the extras that weren't included in the $150 meal.\n\nCourses were as followed: *GBS = Good but standard cause Yelp is basically my food diary but w/ a character limit.\n1) Ankimo w/ yamaimo: Texturally great. Mountain yam's creamy crunch worked well. Ankimo was good but I've had better fluffier ones at other similarly priced spots. (3.75/5)\n2) Eggplant w/ microgreens + baby anchovies: The anchovies broke up the creamy eggplant very well. It was almost like extra mini crunches. Otherwise I found the dish a bit bland but also a bit salty at the same time. The microgreens didn't work well for me (3/5)\n2.5) Sake: A very nice freebie to \"open our appetites\". Light, sweet, very distinct fermented rice aroma.\n3) Sashimi plate w/ smoke kanpachi, smoked amberjack, bluefin akami: The smoking on the kanpachi/amberjack were nice and not overpowering. Texture/fat wise GBS. The bluefin akami was GBS. (3.5/5)\n4) Uni Chawanmushi: Well made. But also something I've had at a lot of spots for cheaper and done just as well. Was hoping for something a bit more inventive. That being said it's light-bodied w/ a very umami-filled stock. (4.25/5)\n5) Deluxe Sashimi Plate: 1st stand out item of the night. Presentation was gorgeous (it's served in a pencil scallop shell) (4.75/5)\n-Aoyagi: Best aoyagi I've had. They serve the meat +muscle. Very sweet and there's a chew but not in a rubbery way. Parts of it were like a firm scallop.\n-Chutoro: GBS\n-Pencil Scallop: A 1st and loved it. Had a konjac-like firmness without the extra kickback bite. \n6) Tsukemono w/ deep fried fish: My friend really enjoyed this but it wasn't for me. The fish was a bit dry and while I love the taste of carbs soaked in sweet vinegar, I didn't love the texture. I did enjoy the cucumber and wished there was more. (2/5)\n7) Nigiri: Rice amount was small (not a bad thing) but proportionately it didn't always work. Rice taste/texture was meh. I found the kernels a bit too separated and I wish it was a bit more compact. Flavor-wise I prefer it stronger too. For the fish, quality was good but not the best I've had and for the most part not much was done to make anything stand out.\n-Ika: Whatever they added really made it special though the ika itself was GBS. (4.25/5)\n-Aji/Horse Mackerel: GBS (4/5)\n-Greenling: A 1st. Reminded me of halibut. Very clean & soft but w/ a pop at the end & w/ more depth in the flavor. (4/5)\n-Ishidai: Another 1st for me. My friend and I both found it funky. I felt like it was smoked or at least in the proximity of some very aromatic wood. The funk lingered (3/5)\n-Cherry Salmon: A high point. Like chewing a cross between light jello + meat. Perfect amount of salt (5/5)\n-King Mackerel: GBS (4/5)\n-Kinmedai: One of my faves at most places. Wish it was torched more. GBS. (4/5)\n-Shima Aji: Bit of citrus. Firm and fatty. (4.5/5)\n-Hagashi Toro (no connective tissue): SO tender & fatty. High point (7/5)\n-Uni w/ ikura: Quality uni. In the mid ground of the sweet/buttery scale. Ikura had a nice sweet marinade. (4/5)\n8) A5 Wagyu w/ pickled onion, truffle, freeze dried fat over potato: Pickle wasn't too strong but brought just enough acidity to lift the fattiness. Freeze dried fat was like magic flavor powder. Truffle was magic part 2. Potato helped balance it out though almost wish there was a bit less of it.\n9) Red miso w/ clams & tofu: GBS, a bit salty\n10) Tamago w/ lobster: Another high point. Like a sponge cake but w/ lobster flavor swimming around your nostrils. (4.75/5)\n11) Panna cotta w/ yuzu granita: 2nd main thing that made me go WOW. Base was creamy and dense w/ a salty kick that works so well w/ the granita. (6/5)\n12) Matcha chocolate ganache: Gift for home. Ganache was good but exterior didn't have the chocolate snap. Still made me smile tho.\n\nTLDR: It's good/HQ stuff and I enjoyed it but overall nothing too special given their reputation & price point.", "author": "Vivian C."}

The name Omakase already defines what to expect with re: to food -- it's a chef's choice sushi course. When my husband and I went, there were 2 options to chose from. Yes, the sushi was very good. Not the best I've ever had, but very good. And yes, it was very expensive. Maybe the most expensive my husband and I have ever had. I just wanted to set all those expectations ahead of time to weed out the readers used to your sushi buffets and bento box Japanese restaurants. \n\nInstead of going into the sushi itself, here are my notes about the extras and details from out experience:\n- They call you ahead of time to ask if you're celebrating anything special so they can prepare a personalized card from the chefs to you. \n- Ladies get a nice wooden box to place their purse in on the floor. \n- If you're thinking about ordering a bottle of sake, go for the sake pairing instead. The cheaper bottles are around the price of the sake pairing. The pairings really go well with the courses and if you're looking at volume, you do get a good amount. \n- This probably changes with the seasons, but we didn't have any shellfish.

What makes dining here a truly memorable experience is the atmosphere and service.  We did the more expensive Yamato ($200) with no drink pairings.  \n\nI must commend Chef Takashi Song, who was serving us that night. The timing between courses was perfect (raise your hand if you've waited TOO long between each course before). Its like he has a spidey sense that tells him exactly when you're ready. He is very courteous and also possibly the nicest guy chef I've met.  While he is very serious most of the time, he will surprise you with a bit of genuine humor that's not offensive or improper (look at the photo I posted). Chef Takashi Song loves his job and it shows.  There's a small box with a truffle given to you at the end.  I jokingly asked if he could secretly put uni in there.  He smiles and points to the ceiling....I turn over and see a camera haha!  \n\nMost importantly, it is kid friendly! Your family will be welcomed here.  You may be judged by others for bringing your kids to eat something they cant fully appreciate, but to be honest...I just thought they were the most awesome parents ever. Chef Jackson Yu even cut the younger daughter one of the longest slices of tamago I have ever seen, which made her SO happy while she ate it like a loaf of bread, not paying much attention to the more expensive uni, toro, or wagyu in front of her :) It was a pleasant change from the usually more formal omakase setting.  \n\nOmakase SF's chefs, staff, and atmosphere was absolutely perfect in every way.

We were pretty set on the Hideaki Omakase ($150) and planned on ordering a la carte afterwards, but once we saw the tokusen sashimi that came with the Yamato Omakase ($200), say no more fam - we knew it was game over. It was the most glorious sashimi display I've ever laid my eyes on, so of course we had to get it. \n\nFrom beginning to end, there was nothing I disliked. We started with some appetizers (ankimo was my favorite) and sashimi (pics speak for itself) before getting to the nigiri. My absolute favorite piece of the night was the flounder topped with liver - such a flavorful, savory bite. Toro was obviously melt in your mouth status. I don't eat meat so my wagyu substitute was artic char which was just as amazing as the seared toro it was paired with (extra two nigiris that come with the Yamato). Ikura was probably the best I've ever had, so perfectly marinated.

I had heard so much about it and was excited to try it out initially. I have now been to many of the omakase places in San Francisco, including all of the Michelin star ones and Omakase was by far the most disappointing. First, Omakase was one of the most expensive restaurants on the list -- costing more than Wako and Ju-Ni at the time. Second, their fish quality did not seem to be at the same level as Wako and Ju-No. Third, and the most disappointing of all, I felt like since their fish quality was not as high as their counter parts, they relied heavily on marinades and gimmicks in order to seem \"high end.\" Think truffle infused EVERYTHING. If I wanted every fish doused in sauces I could have just gotten a roll and my neighbor sketchy sushi joint. For such a premium I definitely expect better.\n\nI would never choose to return to Omakase when there are so many better options out there in sf.

They sport a Michelin Star for a reason. They offer two levels of omakase, and of course you should go with the premium. \u00c9picurien. \n\nThey have a very good sake menu and some champagnes and a beer. Service is outstanding. The ma\u00eetre d runs a tight ship and is formal while still personable. The waitresses are formally attired in traditional dress.  The bar is very clean wood and you can see all the fish and courses being prepared. Really ideal.  Reminds me of Kabuto in Las Vegas in terms of sushi bar and quality of fish. Much are imported from Japan and the selections are premium and varied. They have a lot of oilier fish and crustaceans which is hard to find in an American market. The large Asian population in San Francisco allows for elevated sushi. \n\nThey serve a complimentary taste of sake. I extended with a delicious, clean yet layered Akitabare suirakuten. \n\n- Amuse-boche - ankimo. They open in a big way\n- Gomae with baby anchovies and nasu. Loved this \n- Sashimi course - kanpachi and akami. Wakame seaweed\n- Uni chawanmushi - Hokkaido uni very delicate \n- Sashimi course deux (premium) - perio clam, toro, aoyagi clam\n- Unagi with cucumber and wakame. Delicious. Grilled over hot coals in bamboo leaf \n- Inada nigiri - wonderful way to start. Delicious rice very light vinegary some body but still soft\n- Knife jaw - more substantial, wonderful\n- Aji - wonderful cut. Chef is an expert \n- Cherry trout from Hokkaido with fermented cherry leaf. Wow. The sophistication here is next level\n- Sawara - Japanese mackerel. Wonderful grilled\n- Hokkaido uni and ikura from Japan - premium course. Very good and elegantly served. My rote response is I miss the gunkan style \n- Baby sea bream - with caviar next level again\n- Kinmadai - fan favorite these days. Chef added that these goldeneye snapper come from 600-feet below in the Pacific Ocean \n- Shima-aji - fattiest silver fish according to the chef. Excellent knife skills on display to give it even more character \n- O-toro - from Spain. Really perfect\n- Kohada - I added this. Lovely if you like vinegary fish\n- Saba - cured with komba. I added this too. All from Japan\n- House-made tamago - so light and airy. Loved it. Just a touch sweet\n- Waygu - was a bit cool for me. They may have grilled it too early\n- Red miso soup with clam\n- Dessert - vanilla cr\u00e8me panna cotta with yuzu sorbet mango sesame and edible flower\n\nThey brought my check out with the dessert which I found odd. Potentially they were trying to squeeze someone else in but still for such an elegant dinner it was a shame. \n\nOtherwise, the chef has outstanding knife skills and etiquette.

Sawada (Japanese Spanish mackerel): with garlic and ginger - the garlic on this was great\n\nIntermission:\nUni chawanmushi: super light and smooth \n\nSushi continued:\n5. Seasonal wild cherry trout \n6. Aji with lemon and chopped chives - I didn't realize aji and shima aji were different, but aji is horse mackerel \n7. Kinmedai: golden eye snapper - torched - really liked this\n8. Shima aji: stripe jack - quite fatty in a good way\n9. Otoro: buttery, smooth \n10. Uni and house cured ikura on rice: loved the ikura; I wish there were a little more rice for this, though - I really liked their shari\n\nTo finish:\n1. Tamago with lobster: light and airy\n2. Red miso with clams and tofu \n\nDessert: \nPanna cotta with mango and strawberries, yuzu granita\n\nTo take home: \nChocolate with tea flavor in a cute box\n\nThe fish was all very fresh. Overall, I would have preferred a little more seasoning on the fish (a little under salted/flavored for me).  On the other hand, the shari was great, and the quantity of food was just right.\n\nService was very polite and on point. The sushi chefs seemed to be enjoying what they were doing, and they had a good sense of humor - the more experienced chefs were jokingly giving the younger sushi chef a hard time. It's nice that it was a relaxed and less formal atmosphere.\n\nFrom the sake pairing, my favorites were the Black Dragon and also the final one we had, which was lighter and had a hint of apple. I loved the various sake cups they give you.  That said, there's not as much sake as we expected, and it left me wanting more.  It was great to try different sakes, but I might just go for bottles next time. \n\nReservations are on Open Table.\n\nI like that most of the seating is at the sushi bar - there are 2 small tables on the side for parties of 2.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-12-30", "description": "What a disappointment. After all the great reviews and the Michelin star earned again this year, this was well below my expectations. Let's go over why it such a letdown. I got the Yamato Omakase ($200) and spent close to 3 hours dining. Time that could have be cut down easily as they were preparing things during the dinner that could have been easily done beforehand like the bamboo leaves for the tokusen sashimi display.\n\nWhen it comes to service, it was definitely Michelin star quality service. Servers were very attentive, friendly, asked if you wanted a complimentary sake shot, and made sure your table was clean after every dish. Chefs were pretty much the same, though the physical spacing of the restaurant is huge and creates a distance between you and them that makes it feel very impersonal. I will say what I liked the most was that they teach you the proper way to enjoy sushi. Hands only, in one bite, and with real wasabi - all things I appreciate as I always make my dining companion eat with me in a similar style.\n\nIt's ironic how the restaurant called Omakase is kaiseki rather than true omakase. Kaiseki refers to a full multi-course traditional Japanese dinner, which is what this was. I'd say less than half the meal was actually omakase a.k.a. chef's choice of nigiri (sashimi on a small square of rice). It was an array of appetizers and some subpar sashimi before we finally got the nigiri. I did like the surf clam out of all the sashimi, but besides that, they were all extremely fishy, not fresh, and no sushi ginger was provided. I've mentioned before that they used real wasabi, but it was so inconsistent in preparation that it took away from the meal. Sometimes you had a big glob of wasabi and it gave quite a kick in your nigiri, other times you could barely taste it at all like when I ate it with my sashimi. So like the meal order/pacing, we finally review the nigiri. It hit some high points with the flounder and torched horse mackerel, but everything else was only okay (refer to the nigiri in my photos). Nothing blew your mind, even the fish you've never heard of (knifejaw, alfonsio, wild adult yellowtail) were alright.\n\nMeal Value (from 1-10, my measure of quantity/quality of the meal compared to price): 7\nYou may be thinking well if my meal was that bad, how come this was at an average meal value? I gave it this value as they use real wasabi and fish you'll most likely never eat anywhere else. It's hard to quantify value when it's a once in a life time experience. I discussed it with my dining companion, but rare fish doesn't change how bad the ingredients/preparation were for the sushi. In addition, I found it quite outrageous that they charged for standard green tea. \n\nAt the end of the day, I would not recommend this experience to others (especially at this price point). If I were to summarize my experience in two words - inconsistent kaiseki.", "author": "Hung Yu C."}

Omakase has a table for 2 at 5:15pm.\", the only correct answer to this is: YES???? No occasion, no reason, yes I'm a spoiled baby :3\n\nWe were running a bit late as we decided to walk to Omakase all the way from Lucky Strike, so we gave them a call to ensure we wouldn't lose our table. Finally arrived and we sat on a side table - my only gripe of the night. I'm a sucker for bar seating but I accepted my fate since we only made reservations the day before. Omakase offers two menus - $150 or $200. We opted for the $150 so we could order a la carte if we were still hungry after.\n\nEverything was good but my favorites of the night were the uni chawanmushi, all the nigiri sets (heh), uni with ikura over rice, LOBSTER TAMAGO?! (this was really amazing), and A5 wagyu nigiri (ordered a la carte).\n\nVerdict: whenever I do omakase, I'm always about the nigiri/sashimi, but this time I was thoroughly impressed with all the hot dishes at Omakase that were served. If we took the hot dishes at Omakase and combined it with the nigiri at Kusakabe, made a baby, bam - we got the perfect sushi joint.", "author": "Judith L."}

The course started with some appetizers, followed by the sashimi. None of which blew me away. However, once we got to the nigiri, everything just kept going uphill. Each and every piece was unique and delicious, but they just just kept getting better and better. Everything was topped off with an a la carte item, nigiri chosen by our Chef Taka. It was smokey, fatty, melt in your mouth, deliciousness. Before I put it in my mouth, as it hovered over my tongue and my nose got a whiff, I could already taste the smoked goodness. Dessert was a simple dish, fruit, which were so buttery soft, so subtly sweet, and melt in your mouth. The freshness, quality, and skill that Omakse brings, is why they are Michelin rated. If you've ever watched Buzz Feed's \"Worth It\" series, you must've seen Steven and Andrew's reactions when they eat their top $$$ food. The love they have on their face is what you will be feeling when you come here.\n\nI made a reservation to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. We arrived promptly at 8:30 and we were seated at the bar as requested. Be sure to make a reservation at least a month in advance because they fill up quickly. The restaurant is quite small, so you might be a bit squished with your neighbors, so cuddle up with your dinner date. \n\nChef Taka and the entire team made the experience delicious, memorable, and fun. Thank you, Omakase!", "author": "Sophia L."}

Plus at the end of the meal, we got flowers! Again, went above and beyond our expectations!\n\nSo a bit of a bizarre thing happened to me and boyfriend as we were going through the set courses. Basically before the main course we were both literally busting because we were so full! Omakase staff were super accommodating and let us take the leftovers home (I think this was probably a special case as you know this kind of thing is meant to be eaten within moments of being prepared), given we still had 5 or so courses left.\n\nAll in all, I loved the service, ambiance, and food of Omakase.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-04", "description": "Came here to celebrate my birthday. I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time! This place is easy to pass on the streets unless you look up at the sign. Once you enter, you will be greeted by the waitresses. They are all very kind and helpful. We were seated in front of sushi chef Jackson. Was intrigued by the fact the he can speak Chinese which made it a tad bit easier for my mother to understand everything. Food was exquisite. You can either opt for the $150 or $200 Omakase. We opted for the $150 Omakase.\n\nHighlight of the night:Akamatsu (ruby snapper)\nAccording to the chef, this is the most expensive white fish you can get in the market. I can't even express how divine the flavor and texture were. I did not feel worthy of such a great tasting fish. \n\nArctic char: they CHARred the top of the fish with a flame thrower. I'm lame okay but the charred taste you get compliments the fish ever so perfectly. It was a great combo and I could've ate 10 pieces of these alone. \n\nWagyu A5:(had to do as an extra order since it doesn't come with the $150 Omakase) everywhere I go I always get wagyu A5 and I can never get enough. If you've never had A5 wagyu, I highly suggest you try it ASAP!\n\nHokkaido Uni: Another thing I always get when available. Uni is butter to the ocean. Very fresh here and super creamy.\n\nToro: also a must get. Toro is the belly part of the fish which contains high contents of fat and omega. Great for your hair, Skin and foodie soul. \n\nLobster tamago: this is maybe the best tamago I've had in the Bay Area. Very light and fluffy with the hint of lobster flavor. Goes very well with the red miso soup.\n\nAll in all, everything was delicious. The only complaint I would have would be two pieces of sushi I had, the rice was falling apart when I picked it up. That's definitely not expected from a Michelin Omakase restaurant. One star down because of that. They definitely made me feel super special with the birthday card and flower. Very sweet of them indeed.", "author": "Ada H."}

For us this past weekend it was a glass of sake\n\n- They no longer have 3 menu offerings; rather, there are 2 menus, one at $150 and one at $200. The $200 one includes a few more add-ons like a deluxe sashimi platter with o-toro as well as a wagyu course\n\n\nService is attentive, food is wonderful - I almost feel like the food is more authentic and less fusion than the first time I had it when it opened. They still grate their own wasabi but have simplified a lot of the nigiri - less frills/sauce.\n\nMake a reservation!

Originally we were supposed to go to Outside Lands Music Festival, but instead decided to sell our tickets and use the money towards Omakase.\n\nWe met about 1 year ago, and this was in celebration of that time. We got there a little too early, so decided to go within 1 mile radius to a bar close by. \n\nThe restaurant only seats about 18 people, usually people in pairs. And you can only dine here with a reservation. Majority of the people being seated, were celebrating their anniversaries or birthdays, which was noticeable, because of the nice placard in front of their seats.\n\nThere were two sets at different prices, from $150 to $200 per person. For a special, there was an additional $50 of an entree to share that was of local uni. We decided to go straight for the $200 set and with more deliberation, added the $50 for the special uni plate. There was complimentary sake, which was refreshing. \n\nI adore the hostess/ waitress, she was completely funny and is so nice. All the service was beyond amazing. It was a full house, and 3 chefs working on all our dishes. I think each chef had a certain amount of guests and was taking care of their sets. Ours was chef Ken, but he didn't speak much to my bf and I. I liked how they worked together and were playful, they were able to show a softer side, in which was nice for a change.\n\nOur dishes were extremely delicious! Every dish, had small bites and were executed quite nicely. The last time we had omakase, was at another high-end restaurant in L.A., and that was also very delicious. In comparison, we preferred the one in L.A. more than our dining experience here at Omakase.

I for once took a close friend of mine out as he often pays for meals and we've been discussing an opportunity for me to return favor. Plus of all the remaining and dwindling number of male friends, I was afraid that I won't be able to keep him for long: a man who I've known for nearly 20 years, who likes to eat sushi like I do, who knew me before I knew myself, they are as rare as good sushi places in the Bay Area. A meal for two would set you back half a grand but that's to be expected. I think good sushi is expected to be expensive as the fish has been flown in from Tokyo. Another place where I had this kind of uni was a Michelin 3 star place in New York. It's pretty hard to beat the quality. \n\nAllow yourself up to 2 hours. Also, expect to be fed like a dolphin, one piece of time, from mild to strong. There are two options to the patrons. The slightly more expensive version has a couple additional dishes, but I think for what I generally consume, it would be too much quantity. I think the lesser expensive version of omakase is portion appropriate.\n\nThis restaurant is adjacent to a more casual isakaya place which I'd gone before, but this was a much more intimate, quiet establishment. \n\nService was both efficient and elaborate, yet not rushed or pretentious. The silver skinned fish were my favorite, though anything with Hokkaido uni should not be missed. The celebration was for me to join a multi national firm, the largest of its kind on the planet, pre IPO, with ample opportunity to travel to Asia. As I start the count down to my upcoming, first, but certainly not the last Asia bound trips, I wondered if I could replicate my eating expedition on a side trip to Tokyo in the near future.  And if time does not permit, then perhaps I'd simply return here instead after my trips. \n\nThere is definitely something to be said about enjoying a perfect, exotic meal at the comfort of your own backyard.", "author": "Victoria E."}

Over time, he warmed up and told us about how he's from Osaka and he trained 20 hours a day for 3 years. It was interesting. \n\nThe sake pairings were fun. The volume of sake was low in the beginning so we got more. But then the pairings got larger! Lesson is to just wait. \n\nTheir otoro was amazing because they careful removed any stringy tendons and it was pure bliss. One of the pieces had a drizzle of truffle oil which was a great touch. I personally don't like clam and there were 1-2 stringy pieces that were harder to chew. Hate when that happens. Wagyu was awesome and the lamb, not so much. \n\nOverall it was great.

Restaurant is a small, intimate setting. Most seating is at the sushi bar. There are a few small tables seating 2. They have 2 omakase menus: $150 for the regular & $200 for an extra course of sushi & duck/wagyu beef.\n\nAll of the fish was super fresh & portion sizes were generous. The first dish was a soy braised monkfish liver, which was nice & earthy. Next was a veggie dish: daikon, lotus root, king oyster mushroom, and carrot. \n\nSashimi started with bluefin tuna & house-smoked kanpachi, which was nice & complex. Gorgeously plated with some microgreens & a shiso leaf. Hokaido uni & chawan mushi was a little egg custard, very smooth, one of the best.\n\nThey had some more creative dishes, such as long neck clam & lobster tail sashimi, smoked ikura over a giant mound of shaved ice. Just amazing!\n\nSteamed lobster claw with sunomono - good, but very mild flavors. Nothing exciting here, but it was likely a break before the nigiri started. The first flight of nigri included: mackerel (the best we've had), Japanese halibut (very firm with a bit of caviar on top), iwashi (fresh sardine), ocean trout, and bluefin chu toro. All delicious & not too weird.\n\nThen a mini uni-don - tiny bit of rice covered with rich Hokkaido uni & garnished with smoked house-marinated ikura. I thought it was a little too salty. They were generous with the ikura...too much of a good thing!\n\nThe next flight of nigri included: live Hokkaido scallop, torched sawara (Spanish Mackeral from Nagasaki), torched Japanese Barracuda, torched snapper (which was the best). DH really liked the torched fish, which was lightly brushed on fire and blowtorched, giving it a smoky flavor. Shima aji (striped jack) and bluefin O Toro, which was super fatty, as expected.\n\nAfter that, we were getting quite full. The duck breast with yuzu kosho was a tiny portion, not too exciting compared to the fish. The waygu beef was really good, rich and meaty tasting, alas, also one nigri sized bite. Waygu is pricey, but not sure if this was worth it. DH said next time he would go without it & order more seafood instead.\n\nFinally, it was a piece of tamago with a torch caramelized top. It's supposed to have a whole lobster in each tray, but honestly, we couldn't taste it.\n\nAfter the sushi was lobster agedashi miso soup with mushroom. It was pretty nice. Dessert was a ginger poached pear with kumquat candied yuzu. A fairy dessert that was light & relatively healthy.\n\nSince it was my birthday, they gave me flowers & a nice signed card with cute doodles on it.\n\nOur chef didn't talk much, but he did answer our questions. He was definitely passionate about the food and it was entertaining watching him work his magic. We definitely recommend sitting at the bar. Overall, a good choice for a special occasion dinner. Unique offerings, not expensive for the quality & quantity of food, flavors not too weird for an American palate.", "author": "Kari C."}

Just coming home from a few months in the Asias, it's hard not to miss the simplicity of the Japanese culture.  While all these new restaurants and groups are trying to please the thirsty visual aspect of social media, very few are bringing it back to the roots of their dishes.  When it comes to Japanese food, it's very safe to say less is truly more with pride in the details of each ingredient used.  \n\nAlthough I am fully aware that each spectator has their own preferences in tastes and flavors, I can't help but to notice the meticulous care the chefs put into each one of their nigiri pieces and dishes.  \n\nI absolutely love that the Japanese chefs know their ingredients well... where it's from, why it's good at certain times of year, and can translate from Japanese to English for us to understand why certain ingredients are named the way they are.  I always want to know what I'm eating even if I might forget later... hehe.  It nice though you know when someone can take you on an adventure to a place you're not familiar with.  Let's be honest... all foodies out there think they know it all but in actuality we don't know that much.  So it's nice to have a local of that genre of food take us on a journey in their craft.  That's what I appreciate most about this omakase experience compared to many others.\n\nThe head chef is actually Chinese.  In a place like San Francisco where the culture and understanding of food is ever evolving, it's nice to see someone like him respecting the craft and making sure we all leave happy.  I've eaten here on a few occasions and he recognizes me and the friends I send over.  Each and every single time, he would ask us if the food was great and how was our experience.  We'd always tell him it's amazing, but he always gets a little serious and asks again... \"Really... serious question. How were the ingredients and be honest...\" That's what he'd say each time.  He'd worry and tell us something like, \"Well I got a 3 star the other day on yelp and they said it wasn't good so I need a real honest opinion...\" He says I work so hard everyday and I just want to know my customers are getting the best of my team.  \n\nBescause of his studious attitude and the amazing food they put out, it's hard not to return with our friends each time!  \n\nThank you for dinner last night guys!

I tried making something conversation with him but he was very quiet/boring with one word answers so I gave up. He made zero effort in making any conversation. When he served us food, he mumbled everything super fast so it was difficult to understand anything. The other two chefs were having lots of fun interacting with their guests. I don't think it's required that the sushi chef need to be socially outgoing but, to me, omokase is all about getting to know your chef and how they mastered their culinary art. I mean, what am I paying $200+ for if not just the food? This said, I'd recommend sitting in front of Chef Jackson.\n\n2) However, Chef Jackson, the younger looking guy who speaks Chinese, seemed like he only interacts with guests if they're young/beautiful. You're out of luck if you're old and/or not showing skin--very sleazy of him. The other chef (I don't know his name) looked like Krang from TMNT.\n\n3) There was a long wait (like 20 minutes) between the first couple courses. This is unacceptable. Good omokase places adjust the tempo of your meal based on how you're doing, and if not, they don't let a long time pass where you're just confused about what's going on.\n\n4) This last point might seem petty, but the lady who initially greeted us wasn't Japanese (or even Asian)--not that she had to be, but this is the first thing that detracted to the authenticity that you're at a fine omokase-serving establishment. I mean, white/Mexican people can make great sushi too, but there's something about being served something like borcsh from a Russian mother that just makes the experience better. This fact really doesn't matter, but it also didn't help that she was always wearing dirty-looking gym socks in her slippers (fashion faux pas) and she had this wrist brace on that probably was hosting colonies of germs falling onto your food. I mean, it just decreases the elegance--something I think is required for a Michelin star.\n\n5) Overpriced--go to Kusakabe instead! The food is just as good for half the price.\n\nObviously, the food was delicious--there is no doubt about this but I do not understand why this place earned a Michelin star. Service is inconsistent/sloppy and that server looked the opposite of elegant. Other than the food, the only good thing is that there is a lot of parking.\n\nCheck out all the other great omokase places in SF before wasting your cash here.", "author": "Marlon T."}

IMHO there are a probably 2-3 other places in SF that offer similar quality.   Maybe a more discerning diner would be able to say that x or y place has better fish etc. but I think it mostly comes down to personal preference.  Kusakabe, for example, takes a less traditional approach relative to others (which some prefer or not prefer) but I wouldn't say that either is 'better'.  \n\nThe meal starts with some items that are more on the creative side (the uni in egg custard was particularly excellent), moves on to seasonal, traditional nigiri.  In August we had several  pieces - that I can remember, Aji (horse mackrel), sea bream, otoro.   The chef let us try baby ginger which was really good.

Been to most of those hip and popular omakase places in town you name it, many fall short in terms of creativity, portion, taste or variety of the fish. You may walk out with a $550 bill for two at this place, but that's the money well spent. Service was superb! I like Yamakase (in LA) a lot for abundant variety of the toro, uni and truffle, but as satisfying as freshest sashimi any place could possibly be, Omakase beats all others. \n\nOur chef Sam-san was a hilarious guy and his section was full of laughters. We had a wonderful anniversary celebration again. \n\nWell done Kash! We will be back!", "author": "CY C."}

I was shocked at how good the quality was and how close the tastes and flavors were to that of the food we had at Tsukiji market.The small chef's table bar is unassuming and next door to the more casual Okane.\n\nThere were 3 chefs throughout the evening, which kept us entertained and fed us well. Everything presented to us was super fresh and tasted amazing. Each dish was explained and the chefs gave us a little background about where it came from. I ate everything and LOVED everything! \n\nThe menu changes based on what is available from the market, but we were lucky to try some delicious rarities. I couldn't be more happy with the way dinner turned out. The intimate setting meant getting to know some of the other diners and the food surpassed my wildest expectations. Lots of food, a little pricey, but worth it for the quality and a great experience.", "author": "johnson h."}

Forgive my language because the class of this restaurant clearly needs to be handled with more sophistication, but for a commoner such as myself who saved up enough money to splurge at this two time Michelin Star restaurant, I WILL SAY WHAT I WANT TO SAY ABOUT THIS PLACE IN HOWEVER I MAY AND THAT IS THAT THIS PLACE WAS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. \nFrom service to presentation to taste, my gahd, I was impressed. The particular omakase served the day my friends and I attended was an unigasm. Tell me how you can serve uni in so many different types of ways where I could never get tired of it! My gosh, I still have dreams about that uni experience. \nFirst things first though, let me start with the beginning of our experience. Immediately upon entering, my friends and I felt intimidated by the serious atmosphere of the Michelin star restaurant. Upon seating, however, we could see that the servers and chefs cared deeply about our comfort and overall entire experience. They were not there to make us uncomfortable, but to provide us with service beyond what most humans are able to give each other. We felt cared for, appreciated, and educated throughout the entire experience. Our chairs were pulled for us to sit. Our sakes constantly refilled as we took a sip. The sushi chefs were more than delighted to share their knowledge on the food and culture they were indulging us in. As the night continued on, we felt more and more comfortable and found ourselves engaging with each and every individual around us in the restaurant. Everything was fascinating and we wanted more to be a part of the entire restaurant. That is how I felt upon eating here. I've never been catered to in such a gentle way in my life. The waitress in particular was so graceful and alert; I was truly impressed. She also showed excellent teamwork as she described the food items as well as assisted the sushi chefs in delivering the food to their customers. Every movement was graceful and that did not go unnoticed by me. \nContinuing on to the food -- this place is definitely fine dining and I believe it is so excruciatingly important to be mindful of each and every component put into each dish here. If you do not come in with an open mind and are solely coming in to devour for hunger purposes, then you will miss out on an enlightening experience. Unlike most omakase places that focus solely on the fish, this restaurant introduces special seaweeds, fruits and vegetables meant to be helpful for digestion, skin and more. Of course, the fish quality was beyond unbelievable here. Each and every piece held it's own texture -- it's own specialty -- it's own mouth drooling explosion. And the talent of the sushi chefs were amazing at preparing these rare, high quality ingredients. But if you do end up eating here, keep in mind every little detail put into the dishes. If you have any questions at all about anything, ask anyone, and they will be glad to elaborate and open your mind to what you thought was solely a plate with fish and seaweed. Take a bite of the beautiful fish, let it melt on your tongue, let it saturate your palette, think about what you're tasting, try to express it in words, and then, move on to the next piece.\nGUHH. Such an educational dinner. So glad I decided to bring my boyfriend here for his birthday. We also received the cutest signed birthday card at our reservation spot and a complimentary birthday surprise. Thank you so much for the wonderful experience Omakase. I look forward to spending more special occasions with you in the future.", "author": "Kim N."}

We did have reservations but due to our timing, we chose a day that we sat at a side table (definitely wish we got the chance to sit at the sushi bar though - try to do this!). Because we were on the side, the waitress explained every dish instead of the chef, but she was also really thorough and made sure we enjoyed our experience. \n\nThe food is absolutely amazing and delicious. Yes, the price is steep, especially if you do the sake pairing, which we opted out of. But to be honest, the price is understandable after you try these delectable dishes. They're all small but packed with flavor, and I was surprised by dishes I thought would be on the plain side. One of the dishes was a tofu and tomato dish (which I was skeptical) but turned out to be delicious and refreshing! Opting for the $200 meal, we had scrumptious dishes with premium ingredients, such as lobster sushi (first time - turned out amazing!) and Wagyu beef nigiri. We also had an o-toro that was absolute tuna deliciousness! \n\nAll in all, superb service with such an enjoyable dining experience (though I definitely recommend sitting at the sushi bar for the full experience - unless you're looking for a more private dinner). Come for the food and enjoy the sense of community as well (the other guests were kind and clearly loved the food as well, pouring everyone sake and having a good time)!", "author": "Mimi T."}

The only problem is \"picking a place\" can be hard. With so many options, it can be tough to narrow it down. In this case, it was easy breezy as we love Japanese cuisine. \n\nWe opted for the Hideaki Omakase ($150 per person): \n \n-Two Appetizers = crab appetizer and soup was spot on. \n\n- One Sashimi = great cut and fresh.\n\n- Ten pieces Nigiri = different type of nigiris. I enjoyed some of the fishes. My favorite was definitely the sake and uni. \n\n- One Owan = dessert\n\n- Kokuryu \"Ryu\" Sake = the smooth texture was absolutely tasty. \n\nIt is very unlikely for any restaurant to be giving out orchid flowers, but Omakase restaurant did and I love it.

But nothing really reminds me of home in the city. \n\nOmakase on the other hand is the closest place to home that I have ever found in San Francisco. If you ever wonder how authentic Japanese sushi tastes, I definitely recommend Omakase. \n\nFrom the presentation to the service, what you get here, is what you would get in Japan. The attention to the smallest detail is what surprised me, I dropped a little bit of soy sauce  on my table and the next thing I know one of the servers was wiping it up for me. This is the kind of service you get in Japan. \n\nA lot of people who have never experienced the real thing tend to expect the \"Americanized\" version of Omakase. Omakase translated basically means \"Up to the chef\" and there is no specific manual as to what kind of food or sushi should be served in a certain order.\n\nAnyways y'all should try here at least once, incomparable to other places in the city!", "author": "Ryo H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-06", "description": "Most of the fish they serve are rare/exotic fishes, so if you haven't had much exposure to sashimi, I wouldn't recommend it as your first experience. If you're a food explorer and want to try what you normally will not be able to find this might be it. Keep in mind that there are around 16 seats and it was about a 3 hour dining time. They have one chef attend to every four people, and will serve the dishes at about the same time. The ambiance is a modern minimalistic sushi bar, and the staff is very attentive.\n\nThere were many many dishes (~19) out of which 12 were nigiri. I'll be honest that the nigiri was more of the highlight than the sashimi and other dishes. The first 6 dishes consisted of assorted sashimi, charimushi, duck liver, eggplant, and unagi. After many pieces of sashimi, it felt like a little too much to the point where it was hard to enjoy. These dishes weren't bad, but I came here to see their craftsmanship on nigiri. Some fish really blew my mind such as the ginger baby mackerel, buri (wild yellowtail), flounder over caviar, and even the gizzard shad. One thing I noticed was that the nigiri was relatively inconsistent. The wasabi would be overpowering for some. The soy sauce would be over drenched on a few. Additionally, I didn't really feel that the rice was made well. Most sushi rice should have a slight vinegar taste and kept at an optimal room temperature. It didn't seem like the rice was well-controlled during its making. This is surprising given how much attention is typically given to rice in upscale nigiri restaurants. \n\nNow you must be wondering, was this experience worth the hefty $200 per person? Really depends how you see it. There were so many fish I've never heard of despite having been to Japan many many times. Some of the fish I knew were labor intensive to prepare such as the gizzard shad. Also, many expensive ingredients were used (especially imported) such as grade A5 Miyazaki Wagyu, Hokkaido Uni, Caviar, and El Toro. Those are foods you wouldn't find cheap anywhere. So yes, I'd say the price is fair given their expensive ingredients, labor-intensive work, and few seats they are able to serve each night. However, as someone who enjoys primarily nigiri, I'd rather go to other places whose focus is nigiri.", "author": "Angus L."}

Many sushi. \n\nThe bf and I decided to do a treat yo self weekend over Halloween weekend because there didn't seem to be any plans. We holed ourselves up at the Fisherman's Wharf Hyatt and had a full-on tourist weekend. As part of it, he made us reservations at Omakase! The way to a woman's heart is undoubtedly through her stomach :P\n\nWe arrived at Omakase a bit early, and there were already others waiting inside. The waiting area is small, so it does the crowded. One of the staff will come up to you and ask your name to confirm against the list of guests they have. The first thing I noticed was the lovely, lovely atmosphere and ambiance of the restaurant. The surrounding lighting is dim, but there's perfect lighting at the bar. All the staff wear kimono, which I thought was neat. \n\nTo start off the meal, they gave everyone a complimentary glass (shot glass sized glass) of sake. The customer service was amazing from start to finish (shout out to Lynn!). If you noted that it was your birthday or anniversary, the restaurant puts out a little card for you and at the end of the meal, they all sign it! How freaking sweet!! The chefs also take pictures with you at the end if you want :D\n\nAll the chefs were fun and friendly, and you could tell they were having a good time. The older Japanese chef was so goofy and cute! We had Chef Jackson, and he was super nice and explained stuff to us as well as gave us a demo of how they cut up daikon *mindblown*. I always thought they shredded the daikon, but it's all hand cut!!\n\nThe bf and I went for the Yamato Omakase (#YOLO) and also ordered their special, Hakkaku (Japanese Dragonfish, $50 for the whole fish), which came with 12 pieces of sashimi (dat presentation doe), soup and fried skin! We did not realize we got the entire fish, but it was delicioussssssssssss. I wasn't a big fan of the eggplant tempura-like appetizer, it was cold and bland IMO (But I also hate eggplant, so...). The Hakkaku soup was a bit on the saltier side and they may have been a bit heavy-handed with the pepper, but I still really enjoyed it. I also didn't care much for the strawberry mochi dessert...It tasted bitter to me?\n\nHighlights for me:\n- Hakkaku sashimi: The meat was...well meaty without being too tough. The texture was something between tai and tuna, if that makes sense. The fish itself had a very light, delicate flavor.\n- Ikura: Their ikura is house-cured, and SO freaking good. It's sweet and salty, and paired perfectly with the Hakaku, lobster, giant clam, and uni dishes. \n- Umimasu: Yum! The acid balanced out creamy/fattiness of the fish.\n- Aji and Shima Aji: Just can't go wrong with these!\n- Anago: Didn't get to take a picture of this, but yum! I'm not a fan of any type of eel-y meats, but twas good!\n\nOmakase is well-deserving of their Michelin star! If you're looking for an omakase experience that isn't too serious and buttoned-up, definitely give Omakase a try (:", "author": "Doris K."}

When you enter the restaurant, you are greeted by a sushi bar with a limited number of seats. The place is decorated with very traditional Japanese wood work and art, so it really transports you to Japan.\n\nI had the omakase set with sake pairings and everything was very fresh and unique. Some of my favorites were the Hokkaido uni rice and the tomato tartar. All of their fish is imported straight from Japan, so the restaurant really tries to bring Japan to its clientele. \n\nThe first course was a soup and a small appetizer: we were served a seafood soup and the tomato tartar. The tomato tartar was interesting, and it was made so that it resembled an actual, non-vegetarian tartar. We were then served a sashimi course, which was beautifully presented atop a bed of ice and floral decor. After the beginning dishes, there was a ten-piece sushi nigiri course. Each nigiri was served fresh from the chef, who placed each piece on a ceramic sushi plate that each person gets. Each nigiri had a distinct taste, with some being meatier or more tender than others. To finish the meal, we were served kobe beef, which in my opinion, was the star of the show. The beef was tender and cooked perfectly to a medium rare. \nDessert consisted of a homemade mochi. \n\nOverall, Omakase is an interesting experience in itself. The restaurant puts emphasis on giving the clientele an authentic taste of Japan, and all the cutlery, plates, and cups were very aesthetic.", "author": "Sandra S."}

This restaurant is small and only offers seating around the sushi bar where you can see the experts at work. If you are not a person who warms up quickly to strangers then take note this place probably is not for you. There is no such thing as personal space or intimate dinners here. Rather, it is a dinner with the people who are elbow to elbow with you and the chef at the front. They have 2 options on the menu: the 6 or 8 course. We opted for the 6 and believe me it was plenty of food. The servers wear traditional kimonos, with their constant attention to clearing and replenishing your place at the table from behind. For us lady's you are handed a box to store your purse under the bar. The sake is delicious and comes in fun vessels. The food is a journey, with unique flavors and some turbulence- so hold on for a ride. Completely guided by the master minds of Japanese cuisine the roads primarily lead to bliss while others offer strange turns to not so great destinations; however, it is a journey so keep an open mind. The start was with the mountain yam. It was a slimy root which I particularly did not care for. The other courses included a pickled fish which was excellent, a 10 piece sushi journey where the chef would make each piece separately explain and you would pick it up from your board with fingers. All the fish is shipped from Japan, they even offered Japanese ginger - non processed like we like here- which was splended. Sashimi was excellent and the uni custard I could have done without. The soft on soft texture with the one note flavor was not doing it for me. It then ended with a ginger pear and orange dessert which was a perfect light note to end on. It was a fun journey and even though there were a few bumps in the road it is definitely something you should experience at least once.", "author": "Allie P."}

My friends and I came to celebrate a birthday at Omakase, and we made reservations a few weeks in advance for their first seating at 5:30pm. The space is quite small, with about 15 counter seats and two small tables. They started off with a complimentary pour of a nice sake, which was very nice. Although all the ingredients seemed fresh, we all left feeling underwhelmed with the meal, especially for the price. The combination of ingredients for some of the dishes was a bit strange, such as the pairing of slimy mountain yam with the ankimo for our appetizer. Also, the dishes were on the bland side, and/or were not elevated at all.\n\nWe weren't that impressed by the nigiri selection, and some of the pieces were chewy/stringy. My favorites out of the nigiri were the flounder & barracuda (very tender), uni w/ikura. Sadly, our favorite part of the meal was the add-on of premium sea perch, which was an additional cost.

You can see the minimalist kitchen as you are seated by the sushi bar. The tasting menu is 150-200/person and well worth the experience.

Expect watered down flavorless food and boring presentation. Shredded chili, the same micro greens and/or salmon roe on most dishes, and yet somehow the result is the same : bland. We get it, the chef knows how to cut carrots and cucumber into scrolls and ribbons. But why do these same elements need to come up again and again in the same Omakase? It feels like I ate the same flavorless, soulless dishes twice or even 3 times. Aside from the very basic and under seasoned sushi, the Omakase seems preprepared, standing around and cold, nothing aside from the sushi seems freshly made.\n\nSadly, we walked out after the 6th course, we didn't finish the Omakase. Unfortunate, as it was my wonderful girlfriends birthday. As we left, our Chef was condescending and quite frankly, I have never seen my fish handled so unappetizingly and vigorously as by this 'chef'.  'Gross' comes to mind. Birthday ruined.\n\nSpent over $700.- for a few pieces of sushi, a carafe of sake and a flavorless eggplant and an ugly condescending chef. Save yourself the money.", "author": "Richard L."}

When dining sushi, I prefer being at the sushi bar because part of the experience is watching the chefs prepare the fish and the interaction. But for last minute reservations, I can't complain. \nI've had my shares of Omakase in my life and know to expect that it's just not possible for a business to give you all the great things without balancing it out with some lesser things. Because of this I usually tend to not go Omakase but always open to exotic fish that I may not know of. I thought they were pretty reasonable w the sushi overall, but I was highly disappointed w the closing, their dessert.. (which I'm big on) was three small pieces of warmed pear with edible flowers for aesthetics. Another thing I was disappointed with was their uni sushi. I love love uni, but this had an interesting unusual flavor I just wasn't too used to. It felt overly fatty but flavorless. \nI opted for the $150 Omakase and I was already getting full w 4 more sushis left (this was a\ngood thing). So if you've got a small appetite like I do, I suggest the smaller Omakase. \nI thought the staff was attentive and nice, and enjoyed the waitresss Emi, she was funny. But unfortunately a couple of things I had wanted wasn't on the menu. But overall great staff, intimate small restaurant, good sushi. Will I go back? I'm not sure bc for what was the total bill, I can't say the fish was worth that price tag. Or maybe I'm just sad mirugai wasn't a part of the Omakase!", "author": "Sandy P."}

Omakase has two tasting menu options - the Hideaki with 10 pcs nigiri, appetizers and dessert for $150 and the extended Yamato with 2 sashimi, 12 pcs nigiri, appetizers and dessert for $200. We decided to go big or go home and both got the extended omakase which was a decision we didn't regret. Honestly, I have mixed feelings with Omakase. I really enjoyed the fact that I got to try so many new and different fish types I had never tried before and I did think the fish tasted good. Service was also really good. Our chef was pretty friendly and entertaining and volunteered to take a photo of us. They also do this thing where the chefs sign your birthday/anniversary card which is quite possibly one of the cutest handwritten/drawn cards I've ever received (see photo). However, that being said, I thought for the price and the type/quantity of food we received, I would rather revisit a less expensive but still good quality sushi place (ie. Ju-ni or even Wakuriya).

We were served by the youngest looking guy. Not to discriminate but I was hoping, for such a hefty price tag, that my chef would be Japanese. \n- Said chef didn't try to interact with us at all, sometimes he did not even specify what kind of fish we were getting.

Normally it wouldn't be too bad but the restaurant was so quiet and it became such an awkward meal. \n- If you can tell from my photos below the uni they served was not fresh.

Here are the lowlights:\n\n- The minute we sat down we were offered champagne and shown the price on the menu - very tacky.\n- We ordered a few extras like dragonfish, which were presented in an interesting way, but at $50 not worth it and not very tasty of a fish. I also liked how they offered uni as a special add-on, but three of the courses in the regular omakase had uni in it.\n- There were bones in my eel that were scratching at my throat as I swallowed. I'm not a stranger to eating whole fish, bones included, but this was unpleasant. I alerted the wait staff and they offered to bring a different cut of the eel, but I was pretty turned off by then. The chef overheard and informed me that \"in Japan, they eat the bones.\" Thaaaaanks. I actually just came back from Japan, and no, they really don't.\n- One of the courses was a soup that was just broth. They warned me it may have eel bones in it and gave me a bowl, which was nice of them, but my question is - why don't they run the broth through a sieve? This is a fancy place, not the type of establishment where you might be expected to be spitting out bones.\n- We were charged for a beer we ordered but never received.\n- All the add-ons are super pricey (eg, $8 green tea).\n- Our sushi chef was kind of awkward and not really friendly. At the end of the meal, he didn't ask us how our meal was.\n- When we got up to leave, no one came over, so we just grabbed our own coats from the closet. \n\nNot the best customer service, not a luxury (one-star Michelin) experience, and not a pleasant meal overall.

Our sushi chef however barely spoke to us, only giving us the name of the each piece with no detail in between.

We had Chef Sam who was so funny and a little bit goofy. You can tell that the staff is like a little family with a lot of good-hearted teasing. With that said, the staff was very professional and introduced each dish to us beforehand and provided tips for eating, if needed.\n\nOmakase offers two preset menus:\n1. Hideaki Omakase for $150 (excluding drinks, tax, and tip)\nTwo Appetizers\nOne Sashimi\nTen pieces Nigiri\nOne Owan\n \n2. Yamato Omakase for $200 (excluding drinks, tax, and tip)\nTwo Appetizers\nTwo Sashimi\nOne Yakimono\nTwelve pieces Nigiri\nOne Owan\n\nWe did the Hideaki Omakase and found that it was more than enough food. The couple next to us got Yamato Omakase and had some pretty nice additional dishes (more nigiri including wagyu, a sashimi plate, lobster). Either way, this is not one of those omakase places where you'll leave needing to eat another meal.\n\nWhat we had:\n- Monkfish liver- so tender, it reminded me of uni\n- Japanese eggplant with baby anchovies\n- Steamed lobster with cucumber\n- Bluefin tuna and slapjack sashimi\n- Japanese cooked fish with ponzu sauce\n\nNigiri Course\n- Goldeneye snapper\n- Striped jack fish\n- Mackerel\n- Toro\n- Japanese flounder\n- Barracuda\n- Amberjack\n- Uni\n- Torched toro\n- Unagi\n\n- Egg cake with lobster and mountain yam, sugared and bruleed on top\n- Lobster agedashi with miso soup\n- Matcha green tea jelly with condensed milk, brown sugar, and sesame powder\n\nOf course, the nigiri course was the highlight. Each piece was prepared differently (both from each other and from other restaurants). Depending on the item, each piece was specifically enhanced (truffle salt, seared with a blow torch, scored across the fish) and then lightly brushed with soy sauce. This allowed for a perfectly balanced and portioned bite for you to take with your hand and put in your mouth. The blow torched pieces had a really nice and unique smoky component. My personal favorite was the goldeneye snapper, but the most visually indulgent was the torched toro where the chef separated some of the fat off of the toro, put the fat back on top of the toro and then torched it, resulting in toro torched in its own fat. O_O\n\nIt's amazing to watch chefs prep and prepare right before your eyes. You get to see the precision and delicacy that goes into making each piece of nigiri. Plus, most if not all of their fish gets flown in from the Tsukiji fish market. Omakase is also very generous with extra surprises, like the dessert and a complimentary taster of sake. Chef Sam also hooked us up with the leftover egg cake.\n\nThere are two seatings each evening: 5:30pm and 8:30pm with about 16+ seats each. All of the seats are along the bar, except for the 2 tables on the side. If possible, it's probably best to see if you can request the seats at the bar so you can watch the chefs and talk to them.

Afterwards though, I felt it was overhyped and did not live up to expectations.\n\nThe entire restaurant only seats 18 people, but not all seating is at the sushi bar, which is definitely a better experience. Service was exceptional.\n\nMy friend and I did the $150 option with $80 sake pairing. All the fish and ingredients were extremely fresh and of the highest quality - the chefs were happy to talk about how they source their ingredients from Japan if you ask. However, the courses were largely unimaginative (-1 star). Two of the slightly more interesting ones were lobster tamago and mango sorbet in sake. \n\nAs there are so many other great sushi options in SF, I would definitely pick Kusakabe or Akiko's, both exceptional and more exciting, over Omakase in the future.", "author": "Tiffany P."}

There were only two option which is 6pm or 8:30pm because the meal last 2 hours long. Parking was super easy here because its in Townsend and there were loads of street meter. But you don't have to pay after 6pm. Customer service was excellent here they made us feel very comfortable since it was our first time. From the uni to the wagyu. We went out big and chose the $200 price fix meal since it was my boyfriends birthday. Our chef Sam was very friendly and bubbly his personality. Bill Total was $450 for two people without tips included. Would love to come back again. P.s the place was really small. There were only 18 seats and two small table.

There was lobster, salmon, yellowtail, grouper, halibut, scallop, shrimp, tuna (different cuts), mackerel, uni and more types of fish I can't remember. Bottom line is you won't be disappointed with the generous amount of seafood they serve. The menu changes weekly based on the best quality fish they can source.\n\nService was incredible and very attentive. I'm not surprised at all that they received a Michelin star so quickly.

It came with about 10 pieces of nigiri and each one was delicious... Love the cherry salmon! I think that every place we go they have had it on their menu as a seasonal item, so tasty! The uni, chu toro, mackerel, Saba and other dishes were delicious as well. I would say the best a la carte pieces were the wagyu and o-toro!

The service is exquisite tho. Excellent service provided by the entire staff. The restaurant is small and can seat about 20 people.

I had the opportunity to try Omakase again and I'm glad I did. I actually came here 2 consecutive nights here! Service was great and Chef Jackson was serving us. I asked for less wasabi and he was able to accommodate. Appreciate that he remembered the next night to put less! It was actually his birthday the 2nd night I came here and helped him celebrate, unfortunately he had to work. lol Very personable and easy to talk to. \n\nThere's an option of $150 or $200 Omakase. We both ordered the $150 Hideaki Omakase (2 appetizer, 1 sashimi, 10 pcs Nigiri and 1 owan). They offer complimentary champagne/sake when you first arrive. Sake tasting was well worth as they served a good amount of different kind of sake. Fish was very fresh and enjoyed it! Dessert was surpringsly good combo! It was a fruit sorbet with sake at the bottom of the cup. \n\nHighly recommend to ask for bar seating because you get the full experience. You're able to talk to Chefs and watch them at work! Give this place a try! It's also a 1 Michelin star! They also have a sister restaurant next door as well as another option. Make your reservations early!\n\nOne thing I would appreciate is to have a list of what is being served. The Chef will tell you what fish it is and where it's from but always nice to see it so you can always refer back to it! :)", "author": "Sherry Y."}

We've been looking for some quality grade sushi and decided to book a reservation for Omakase. It's expensive especially for not having any alcohol pairing for over $200 per person. We did get this cup of palate opening sake they presented to us, but it wasn't anything remarkable. The most spectacular course was the uni special that we ordered. It was huge and beautifully presented, and it tasted as good as it looked. Overall, I felt that the food was good, but the presentation was what really captured my attention.

As the restaurant knew we were celebrating a birthday, they had left a welcome card with a personalized birthday greeting, which the chef's ended up leaving a note on towards the end of the meal as a keepsake. The chef we were seated with, Ingi, had a pleasant and calm demeanor and suited our dining style very well. The other sushi chef Jackson, serving the girls next to us, was definitely more silly and outgoing. Together, they were a very entertaining pair. If you are making a reservation, I would recommend requesting bar seating.\n\nSince it was our first omakase experience, we decided to go all out for the Yamato Omakase, which came with 2 appetizers, 2 sashimi, 1 grilled dish, 12 pieces of nigiri, and 1 dessert. Compared to the other $150 menu option, this one came with 1 extra sashimi dish, 1 grilled dish, and 2 extra pieces of nigiri. Absolutely no regrets - we loved every moment! \n\nOne of our favorite dishes was the clam and lobster tail sashimi (beautifully presented too!) at the start of the meal. Among the nigiri, our favorites were the toro (plain and also seared), the ocean trout, hokkaido sea scallop, and the hokkaido unni with ikura. It was such a treat watching Ingi prepare each piece with such care and precision; from the sushi rice to the sauces and the garnishes, everything was done to perfection. The wagyu beef dish with the various dipping spices and truffle sauce was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and I only wish we had more! At the end of the meal, they had added a candle with dessert and also provided a beautiful small orchid bundle. Throughout the meal, the wait staff was cleaning the table surfaces between courses, re-folding our napkins when we would get up, and always refilling our beverages. They even offered to take our picture behind the sushi bar before preparing for their next service. The combination of hospitality and delicious food made for an awesome birthday meal!

Definitely recommend for anyone who likes their sake dry.\n\nTheir menu consists of three omakase options: $100, $150, $200.

You never have to worry about ordering because you know you're getting the best the chef has to offer.\n\nFirst off, at Omakase, you're paying for not only the fish but also the ambiance. Each reservation-only seating seats about 10 people in all. The overall style reminded me of an authentic, upscale sushi bar in Tokyo. For a fixed price of $100 (which is the basic omakase), you get a complimentary pour of brut, an appetizer (lobster salad), a soup (miso lobster), and ten pieces of sushi.\n\nOn to the fish! Every piece was good to great. A couple standouts were the ahi horse mackerel and toro fatty tuna. My only critique is that the wasabi in my pieces were too generous. I normally do enjoy my sushi with wasabi but there were a couple times where the kick hit me a little too hard.\n\nA couple unique pointers for first timers:\n1) You're served each course one at a time\n2) You eat with your hands\n3) The last course is the tamago omelette (aka sit around and revel in your omakase experience for a bit but know that it's time to go home)\n\nOverall, it was a very good meal and the high price point was appropriate.

The cooked dishes were decent and one of my nigiri pieces crumbled in my hands which made for a nanosecond of sad Denise, but hey, it happens..right? I think the best part is that the chefs are equipped to serve whenever each party gets seated. The overall experience was great but I'm not sure if I would ever splurge on the $200 menu on my own dime. A girl has got to learn to budget sometime in her life!", "author": "Denise L."}

The food was delicious as was all of the different sake that we tried but what truly made the experience was the service we received. From the beginning each and every person we interacted with went out of their way to make the experience incredible.  Char/Charmaine (apologize if I spelled it wrong) was a joy to have as a server and she balanced the perfect level of interaction without being overbearing at all. Chef Jackson is not only a talented chef but was also incredibly thoughtful remembering the specific dishes that we did not like from last time and adapting them in a way that we might enjoy. \n\nThe atmosphere was lively and fun! The one recommendation I would make when booking is that if you can request to be in the long section of the sushi bar it seems like the experience is the best there. We did the entire $200 tasting menu and had no trouble getting through the entire thing and enjoying every last bit. It was such a fun experience that we ended up hanging out and drinking through half of the second seating. Jean from the Omakase restaurant group was also present and went out of her way to provide a hand made flower arrangement for my wife. \n\nThank you to everybody who made this experience special and we will definitely be coming back!", "author": "Howard C."}

The seafood is super fresh, but I'd say the non-sushi dishes are more interesting. The nigiri are fine, but they seem to use the same yuzu/soy sauce, and after 10 or so, all the fish start tasting the same! I'm comparing this to an omakase place in NYC where they had slightly different sauces for different nigiri; The total was more than the sum of its parts and I still think of it from time to time!

The pieces were all cut and placed in a box. The only other time I've seen it is when Safeway/Whole Foods are building their togo sushi boxes. I've been to Yume, Sushi Dai, Kusakabe, Wako and I've never seen such a thing.\n\nThe food was enjoyable and some pieces were delicious/memorable. The wagyu nigiri was not as good as Kusakabe's. One nigiri piece was a little chewy (from the tendons). There was one cooked fish dish that didn't have much flavor. Overall, I was full from the $200 option, but having experienced other omakases, I would simply say that my money can go further elsewhere. \n\nIs it a $200 meal? No, maybe $140. It was a good meal, but not $200 good. I hope they adjust their pricing to better compete or up their game at this price. Service was excellent.", "author": "Shaun B."}

This restaurant definitely deserves that Michelin Star and is probably why they are always booked. \n\nRight when I stepped foot inside I was amazed at the beautiful decor and soft lighting. I sat down and was pleasantly surprised to see a personalized Happy Birthday card from Omakase. This personal touch is a plus. \n\nNow lets get to the food. We ordered the $200 Omakase selection and it was definitely worth every penny. We usually need to order extra a la carte after the omakase is over and the bill will run you $500 or so per person. Each dish not only tasted so fresh and delicious but looked like beautiful intricate art work. We were so lucky to have the famous Jackson as our sushi chef. He was very entertaining and highly knowledgeable in all of the fish selections - his humor added to the already perfect dinner. This is the ultimate dining experience in all aspects! I love how all of the fish is fresh and flown in from Japan's famous Tsukiji fish market. Each piece just melts in your mouth and is perfectly seasoned, even the sushi rice is perfect. People may not notice but something as simple as the sushi rice can greatly impact your sushi experience. \n\nI am a serious sushi snob and not easy to please.

We both started getting into eating sashimi and nigiri the past couple months so I wanted to surprise her with an omakase. Three weeks before memorial weekend, I scrambled looking for an omakase that would still take reservations. Akiko and Kusakabe were unsurprisingly booked so I went with Omakase thinking hey it couldn't be that bad, and it has a michelin star. \n\nChef Jackson, the owner, gave us the best experience we had with fine dining. At many other fine dining, the meal is generally quite intimate and you're given all these exotic ingredients prepared in certain ways that require me to constantly google half the words! Dining at Omakase was definitely still intimate, but was a lot less laborious. In the 14 seat bar plus a couple tables, we luckily sat in front of Chef Jackson(make sure to request the same!). Whenever we had any questions about the food, he patiently taught us about the fish we were eating and why it was different from others. I even felt comfortable asking him if it was okay for me to eat the nigiri in two bits- it's not. \n\nThe highlights of the meal were definitely the striped jack fish and the jack mackerel. The former was wonderfully fatty and flavorful, moreso than high end yellowtail hence the higher premium you pay. The jack mackerel had an interesting softness to it while still retaining a slight chew and buttery flavor. I didn't care as much for the wild king salmon which had a slightly sticky texture to it. Some of the nigiri were overwhelmed by the fresh wasabi or else maybe it's my palate unable to understand why there needed to be that much wasabi. I should have asked Chef Jackson, that's how easy it is to talk to him.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about the food you pay big bucks for, enjoy a delicious meal, as well as have a great time, make a reservation at Omakase.", "author": "joda l."}

This comes with 2 appetizers, 1 sashimi, 10 nigiris, and 1 owan. It doesn't sound like a lot, but we were both stuffed at the end of dinner. BTW, you can order extras at the end in case you're still hungry.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is very peaceful and romantic. You won't find people having loud conversations. Plus most guests are couples (at least that's what it seemed like when we dined there). The restaurant is very dimly lit and decorated simply. There are 16 seats around the bar and 2 side tables for 2 people each. Honestly, I originally wanted to sit at one of the tables as I felt that it would be more private. My boyfriend convinced me to sit at the bar and I was glad. Watching the chefs prepare the meals was mesmerizing. How do they cut those fish so smoothly and evenly?! And the fire!! Well, torch. If you dine here, I definitely recommend sitting at the bar and holding a conversation with the chefs. They're pretty funny!\n\nNow to the meal. Eating the sashimis and nigiris here has spoiled my taste buds. I don't think I can order those at regular Japanese restaurants. Specialty rolls here I come! The fish looked and tasted super fresh. They're flown in from Japan! O.O Each of your meal will be delicious and served beautifully. Definitely a must try if you haven't been. \n\nThe customer service is amazing. The servers refilled my tea and always asked my boyfriend if he wanted more beer before I even realized that my cup was empty. They seemed very knowledgeable of everything served at the restaurant and were very friendly. No complaints from me & im a stickler for good customer service! \n\nAlso, if you're celebrating an event and you let them know, you get a card wishing you a happy birthday or anniversary, which is signed by all 3 of the chefs at the end of your meal.", "author": "Trina V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-30", "description": "Omakase opened up in 2015 or so, as a new Sushi only, prix fixe type tasting menu restaurant. \n\nInterestingly enough, 2015 was the year that this concept really took hold in the San Francisco area, because 3 other similar restaurants opened roughly that year, with the same concept: Wako on 2nd and Clement, Kusakabe on Washington near the Transamerica Building, and in San Mateo on 3rd street, Sushi Yoshizumi. Later in October 2015, when the Michelin guide came out with their Michelin Stars, all 3 received 1 Michelin Star. And as a result, I believe they have all raised their prices, and are harder to get reservations. The latest restaurant in the genre is Ju-Ni, opened in 2016. (Ju-Ni means 12, for the number of seats at the sushi bar.) Let's wait till October to see if Michelin adds them to the guide. \n\nOmakase started out with 3 set meals, at $100, $150 and $200. They have since dispensed with the low end, and when I went months ago, they offered expensive Krug Champagne with the $150 and $200, which they have since jettisoned as well. Michelin Stars can help the bottomline! \n\nThe same owners of Omakase have opened up next door in early 2016 a more casual (but still higher end) Izakaya (small plates) type restaurant, called Okane. (\"Money\" in Japanese.) It does have a more casual, small, 4 seat sushi bar, and sushi at tables. \n\nMy international dining partner and I couldn't get the sushi bar at Omakase, which I always prefer, so we sat at one of the tables and was served by the waitresses, who were polite, attentive, and well trained, but not necessarily Japanese. Jackson Yu, the head Sushi Chef isn't either, but he is very well trained and has a lot of experience he brings to the menu, offerings, and sushi. His assistants are mostly Japanese. The General Manager of Okane is Justin Goo (From Alexander's Steakhouse) and I believe he is GM for Omakase now, too. So trust that you are in good hands. \n\nWe went for the $150/person Omakase, and had a lovely meal with great dishes and very good service. You will have to look at the pictures to see each dish, as I ate there longer ago than my memory can remember the multi-course menu. \n\n\"Omakase\" is Japanese for \"Chef's Choice\" for sushi. Similar in concept to a Chef's tasting menu at higher end western restaurants. However, in the traditional sense, in a small Ma and Pa Sushi-ya in Japan, \"Omakase\" would mean that you trust the Sushi Chef with preparing things. But you would interact with him on what is fresh, and he would observe your tastes for his offerings and adjust accordingly with each next offering, through careful observations. But these restaurants like Omakase and others mentioned, are larger and more formal, and more similar to a Chef's Prix Fixe tasting menu of seasonal delights that Michelin likes to give stars. \n\nBy the way, \"Omakase\" is more a noun, but the verb or very similar wording is also a general term in the language for \"leave it up to me\" or \"count on me\" if you are telling someone to rely on you for handling things. It is an opportunity for the promisor to prove their value and savvy, but a heavy responsibility as well in a culture of interdependence, like most Asian cultures are. Here at Omakase, I think with Jackson and Staff, and Justin and staff, you can trust to leave your dinng pleasure up to them.", "author": "Wanugee N."}

For Bay Area sushi, I usually only compare the sushi to the quality I expect from other sushi meals I have had in the area. Obviously, you are not going to walk out of a kaiseki meal in SoMa with the same experience as you had in Tokyo. For some reason, Kusukabe seems to be the gold standard in the Bay, so to give my own opinion on how Omakase compares to Kusukabe: nigiri is better at Kusukabe, non-sushi dishes better at Omakase.\n\nOmakase offers to types of kaiseki meals: a $150 one and a $200 one. We decided to go with the $150 meal.\n\nThe $150 meal comes with 2 appetizer dishes, 1 sashimi dish, 10 pieces of nigiri, and 1 owan dish. I actually am pretty sure we got more than that because I remember looking over to my dining partner halfway through the meal and saying, \"Wait...I thought we already had 2 appetizer dishes??\" \n\nYou definitely want to sit at the bar (not just for Omakase, but for any omakase sushi restaurant). Being at the bar gave us the opportunity to interact with our chef and talk about the food and the SF sushi restaurant industry. It was fascinating being able to talk about how they got their fish every day, and the close community within the Bay Area. Even more awesome, at one point our chef was telling us about how to know what is \"good\" wasabi, and ground up some fresh wasabi for us from the root and let us try a small taste! It was pretty cool!\n\nThe overall meal was very very satisfying. I am a HUGE uni fan, and so, as no surprise, I loved the uni chawanmushi (sea urchin in a steamed egg dish) and the uni donburi (uni with salmon roe and rice). The fish was good, but honestly, I kind of felt like each piece was prepared the same way without much difference in the sauces used. Regardless, I still really enjoyed my meal. \n\nThey start the meal with sake and end the meal with a sorbet in a glass filled with sake. I don't drink, and informed the server at the beginning that I had an allergy. They remembered and gave me sake-less sorbet for my dessert at the end of the meal, which I really appreciated.\n\n4 stars for great food and service.

How could that be possible with a place that is Michelin starred you ask? Well, after initially being told I would have bar seating for my reservation I made last week, I was told today, the day of the reservation, that I in fact had a table seat as I was last to request this and the establishment is first come first serve. This, at an omokase restaurant would have been a travesty. However, after explaining what I was told and what my expectations were thereafter, the manager and chef/owner worked it out beautifully to where I could move my time up by an hour to get bar seating with Jackson himself! On top of that there were free booze, a seemingly endless supply of extra pieces full of toro of all varieties to make up for the inconvenience. And make it up they did! This may very well be the best omokase experience I have ever had! Every piece was expertly crafted with utmost precision. The appetizers were excellent. The dessert fantastic and the ambience perfect. I felt a bit terrible the entire time that I had even thought about leaving a bad review, let alone actually doing it. Shame on me.

A lot of little things came together that evening, starting from a friendly greeting upon arrival.  Once our seats were ready, another warm greeting from the chef followed by an explanation of what we needed to decide on the menu.  In the mean time an appetizer is served along with sake to welcome you.  Service during the meal was perfectly timed, the waitress was knowledgeable about the sake pairing, broke it down so that we could get a sense of what we are drinking and how it pairs with the particular course.  Always warm and friendly, we felt comfortable, even though it's was a new experience.  The other customers around you are just as relaxed, conversation flows, like everyone is at home.  \n\nThis is a special sushi experience, for us reserved for special occasions.  Everything we had was as fresh as you can get from Japan.  Each nigiri sushi made one by one, just before eating, amazing.  It's like being pampered, like at a spa, relaxing and exciting at the same time.\n\nA lot of times when going out for sushi, we end up scrutinizing how well the rice is cooked and seasoned, or is the nori (seaweed) fresh or stale.  Is the fish fresh and portioned cut nicely, etc.  Omakase is so far beyond that, it's really down to the details of the food, what flavor profiles the chef prefers and the service.

You also pay a pretty price for it though so if willing to splurge and indulge it is definitely worth trying.\n\n---------\n\nSetup/Atmosphere/Authenticity: Two fixed menu's for $150 and $200/per (see menu pictures).  Sake pairing available for additional cost or separate drink selection available for 8oz or bottle.  We went w/ the $200 option, no sake pairing, and ordered our own selection of sake off the menu.  Each dish is brought out individually at your own pace.  Depending on how fast you eat this can lead to a lengthy meal. Reservations VERY HIGHLY recommended.  The entire space can probably seat approx. 20 - 25 people total at a time.   There is a sushi bar that fits majority of the guests w/ 2 or 3 small tables in the front that seat 2 people each.  There are 3 chefs at a time and it is meant to be entertainment/dining.  If sitting at the bar it is recommended to engage w/ the chefs.  It seems to be reservations based, and fixed in waves to keep the menu along the same pace so the chefs aren't all over the place.  No jacket required, but would not come in jeans and a t-shirt.  Everyone fits the theme of a Japanese restaurant, sushi chefs (self explanatory and waitresses in kimonos)\n\nService: Waitresses are very attentive.  As soon as you finish one dish they collect the dish and wait till the table is ready for the next course.  They also explain what each dish is when brought out which was very helpful as I wouldn't be able to pronounce or even know what some of the items were.  I also asked for a breakdown of the sashimi section and they hand-wrote each dish (w/ the English definition) on a fancy paper!  They had the chefs even sign it!  They also provided a card w/ the chef's signatures (and little drawings) for someone's graduation.  Very thoughtful and cool from the chefs!  The hostess also came by to talk to us and she was extremely friendly and offered several recommendations.  You could ask them anything about the food and they were more than happy to answer and be of service!\n\nQuality of Food:  Wow, just wow!  Most of the items I would probably not order at any other restaurant because I usually don't eat or just not a favorite.  Decided to go out of my comfort zone and I was very happy I did.  Everything was absolutely delicious!  A perfect example was the Uni.  Not a fan of uni - mainly for the texture but when I tried it here it was so smooth!  Same w/ the sashimi - very fresh fish and as you would say \"not fishy\" is actually good!  They serve the best parts of the fish and each dish was very flavorable.  My only issue is the amount of wasabi they put on the sashimi.  Since that part of the experience is meant to be enjoyed w/ your hands, they actually put a little bit of wasabi and soy sauce in between the fish and rice.  This is cool - never experienced it that way but I am also very sensitive to wasabi.  So when I stuck the pieces in my mouth unknowingly I was in for a little shock.  It really wasn't much but I use very little wasabi on my sushi so I would've liked less and/or more spread out instead of it more as a glue for the fish and rice.  They offered us a complimentary sake in the beginning and it was fruity which I really enjoyed (picture w/ the bottle and metal cups)!  The one we ordered w/ our meal was recommended by the host.  It was very good as well!  Not as fruity, more dry, but very smooth.  It was easy to drink.\n\nOverall:  I definitely enjoyed the overall experience.  Given that I'm usually pretty easy to please I don't go out to nice restaurants.  I was definitely glad I went a little out of my comfort zone both w/ the price and the food.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good, authentic, Japanese sushi bar.  I would not recommend coming here though if you're just looking for rolls.  This place is mainly a highlight to more authentic sashimi dishes.  As mentioned I also recommend making reservations and engaging w/ the staff (both the chefs and the waitress).  Realistically I probably won't be going back on my own any time too soon for a casual dinner or quick bite.

You can't even see anything because their windows are covered with drapes. Good thing is you can find plenty of parking spaces here after 6 PM.\n\n  Chef Jackson Yu, with 18 years of experience from all over the world, surely knows what he's doing here with 2 menu only now $150 Hideaki Omakase (2 appetizer, 1 sashimi, 10 nigiri, 1 owan) and $200 Yamato Omakase (2 appetizer, 2 sashimi, 12 nigiri, 1 owan) , of a place with about 20 seats, and fresh fish that is flown in three times a week from Tsukiji Market in Japan, as fresh and as nice as it gets.Everything was delicious and fresh and it's a bargain for the quality you get here. Chefs are very attentive to you and make you feel very welcome. \n\n  Now if you are that type that want happy hour $5 California Roll, or if you like Dragon Roll Dynamite Roll, Spicy Roll, or Victoria's Secret Roll, this is definitely NOT your style. \n\n  Don't forget to check out their premium Sake list, quite delicious. Another reason why I enjoy coming here, because their new General Manager Justin Goo (former Bar Manager at Alexander's Steakhouse and Gary Danko). Under his management, Omakase will only get better. \n\n  I left here fat and happy, so my BFF, we can't wait to come back. One my favorite newest Michelin Star in San Francisco.", "author": "Manda Bear B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-05", "description": "Omakase is pretty small restaurant in SoMa with maximum capacity of 14 people at one time. Despite that, we were still able to get a seating on Sunday at 5:30pm with a week's notice.\n\nRight when we were seated, we were served complimentary sake. They had an extensive list of sakes and wines that you could order on the side, but it's $80 for the pairing. We came here for our 6 year anniversary and decided to spend the extra $50 on their Yamato Omakase over the Hideaki Omakase, but passed on the pairing. The Yamato Omakase comes with an additional sashimi, two additional pieces of nigiri, and a meat dish. \n\nThe additional sashimi that night was live lobster tail and the meat dish was Grade A5 Wagyu. The fish is flown straight from Tsukiji market in Tokyo and the nigiri selection includes less commonly found seafood, such as the coveted Hokkaido uni, Hokkaido mackerel (much less fishy and vinegary than you'd find elsewhere), and golden eye snapper. \n\nI'd recommend sitting at the bar because you can watch them in action and ask questions. The chefs' preparation of the nigiri deviated from the traditional in that they sometimes added small amounts of sea salt or truffle salt, a squeeze of lemon juice, and light sauces. Most of the pieces had wasabi underneath the fish, but since they use real wasabi, it wasn't as biting or pungent. The chefs also lightly brushed the soy sauce onto the fish before serving it so you didn't have to dip it yourself and get the rice soaked. There were a few fish that they seared with a blowtorch, which brought out a different flavor than when completely raw. \n\nI was surprised at how delicious some of the fish were with these small additions - truly amazing! It was interesting that they could transform something I've had so many times into something so different. It was also apparent that the quality of their seafood was superb. For example, when the ikura popped in my mouth, it was a light, briny taste reminiscent of the sea rather than a flood of harsh saltiness.\n\nThe Wagyu at the end, though small, was worth it. It was lightly seared and sliced into very thin pieces and served with sides of green tea salt, wasabi, truffle soy sauce, and pepper. \n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that the restaurant pairs the food with beautiful traditional Japanese ceramic and pottery. The pieces are subtle, so it's easy to overlook, but it definitely added to the ambience.\n\nIf you're coming here for a special occasion, be sure to let them know. Almost every single party that night had something going on. You could tell because they had cards displayed on a stand for those individuals. At the end of our meal, all of the chefs signed our card and drew silly pictures of a sea creature and handed us a small arrangement of orchids.", "author": "Tracy V."}

I have to take Omakase down another star to two.  \n\nDinner at Omakase_\n\nAnother new addition to 2016 Michelin one star.\n\nLets start with the good\n\nSashimi-\nMirugai- Japanese claim is the best i have in a long while.  Crisp and sweet.  Excellent.\nKampanchi- fresh and flavorful.  \nTuna- so so- but acceptable\nLobster- little sweet and perfect texture.\n\nSashimi is good.  Definitely one star quality.\n\nHot dishes-\n\nchawanmushi- this is just bad.  The broth were a little salty.  But the egg portion is flavorless.  The Hamachi inside was not prepared properly and i can taste the stink of hamachi.  Overall, this was really really bad.\n\nTrout with dashi and tomato- bland and nothing goes with each other.  Forgettable dish.\n\nMisoyaki Blackcod with snow crab dashi-  this is just bad.  Reminds me of Maresa.  Blackcod misoyaki is very salty and sweet. So i can understand the need to balance the taste.  But to have a dahi of snow crab with absolutely no flavor at all.  Its just ridiculous.  You can't balance the flavor at all. Its just salty fish with water.  Overall bad.\n\nAll the hot dishes was total mess.  \n\nNigiri-\n\nLets start with rice-  the biggest problem with Omakase is its rice.  I prefer slightly under cooked rice with red vinegar that gives it texture and sourness that would bring out the flavor of the fish.  Omakase rice is over cooked and lacks texture.  Its also lack sourness that would bring out the flavor of fish.\n\nOut 11 pieces of nigiri, only couple dishes that i would want to eat again.  The white shrimp with uni was creative.  The hirame with hirame liver on top was good.  The toro was great- just enough fat and very rich in flavor.\n\nOne thing that really pissed me off was the Aji.  Aji is my favorite fish.  Omakase Aji was probably the best i had in the bay area.  Except the chef butchered it by putting way too much ginger on top.  Really really pissed me off.  It could have been out of this world.\n\nNigiri- I gave it 3 out of 5 star.  They have very good fish and probably one of the best in bay area.  But the rice and some fundamental mistakes really ruined the fish.  Its a pity, because it can be so much better. \n\nLastly-  the tamako at the end was also really really poorly done.  Omakase tried to duplicate Jiro's style of tamako.  Jiro's version is full of flavor and texture is like sweet honey cake- moist.  In US, Nakazawa is probably the only place that is authentic as compare to Jiro.  Yoshizumi in San Mateo comes close.  But Omakase really screwed up.  The flavor is there.  But its over cooked and tasted very dry.  The texture is like dried out sponge cake.  \n\nService- \nYes.  Compare to other $$$$ sushi place in the bay area.  There are more servers at Omakase.  But the service was not as good as it can be.  My wife's tea ran out twice and tea got cold on several occasions.  Sushi will lower the patron temperature.  Hence keep constant hot tea is a must.  \n\nOur chef (not Chef Yu) was slow in wiping the plate clean.  Also, my wife's white shrimp with uni fell apart on the dish.  \n\nConclusion-\n\nNirigi- 3/5\n\nSashimi- 5/5\n\nService- 3/5\n\nHot items- 1/5\n\nI had to revise my comment after visiting Ijji.  Ijji's fish quality and creativity is heads and above Omakase.  Omakase is over priced and no where as good as other authentic Japanese restaurant.  \n\nThis place caters to Chinese much better.  Its just not authentic Omakase.", "author": "Jerry W."}

My friend and I arrived @ 9-910pm for our reservation so we were literally the last guest to start and finish. The dinner takes about 3 hours which is fine with us especially considering if it was any less I would feel cheated considering it was a little over $600 for dinner for two. The toro, Uni, wagyu and duck breast definitely stood out. The clam broth was a tad bit salty for my taste. The rest were good but not exceptional. Sadly at price point I was expecting more. The presentation is nothing short of gorgeous. It was dinner and a show since you are watching the chef makes the dishes before your eyes. Okay, I don't want to keep you in suspense about the faux pas. It was the omelette that had Caramelized sugar on it. We watch the chef make it for other patrons and watched the other patrons eat it. The looks on their face only heighten the anticipation for us as not only did it looked amazing but the looks on the face said it all. Our chef had pre-made ours along with another groups that were like 30 minutes ahead of us in terms of dinner service. So sadly when it was our turn to eat the omelette to say disappointed is an understatement of the year. Since he had torched it ahead of time, the omelette was cold and the Caramelized sugar had turn a bit bitter. I understand we are the last patrons in establishment but if you didn't want to stay open past a certain time then you shouldn't take our reservation. With the numbers of omakase restaurants opening in the city there are just better options and can't say I would return to dine here a second time.", "author": "Gina H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-14", "description": "Was it delicious? Absolutely.\n\nBut was it a $200 dining experience? Questionable.\n\nWas it worth flying to San Francisco from Thailand for one night just to eat here like the man and his teenage son who sat next to us at the bar? Nah, Tokyo is much closer. ;)\n\nOmakase only has two pricing options now after the $100 option got taken off the menu: $150 and $200. For half the price ($95), you can eat at Kusakabe (which also has one michelin star) and get a comparable dining experience. I would say that Omakase is more traditional, and Kusakabe adds a few more modern/fusion twists to their dishes.\n\nAnyways, pricing aside, I had a lot of fun joking around with my friends and the chefs. By the way, any omakase experience is incomplete if you don't sit at the bar, so make sure to request bar seating when you make your reservation.\n\nAlmost all of the fish are flown fresh from Tsuiji market with the exception being the Maine lobster, which I consider one of the highlights of the meal. Some of my favorites include:\n\n- the grilled eggplant appetizer\n- the Maine Lobster tail sashimi - I've never had lobster raw before. It tastes like ebi (sweet shrimp)!\n- the horse mackerel nigiri with ginger and chives - this is a new twist for me. I've never had chives on sushi before.\n- uni ikura on rice - I wish I could have a giant bowl of this stuff!!!\n- O-toro (the fattiest cut of tuna you can get) nigiri - I call it the orgasm-toro. It never disappoints.\n\nThe just OK:\n- Scallop nigiri with lemon zest - the lemon zest overpowered the natural flavors of the scallop. I wish I could have had it straight up!\n- Satsuma beef - I'm just being picky here, but they served it to us on the lukewarm side. The slices were also disappointingly thin. Needs more meat!!!! Loved the marbling on it though.", "author": "Catherine C."}

We ordered the $200 Omakase and tasted a few different sakes. Chef Andy was our main craftsman that night and Chef Jackson made a couple of dishes for us as well. The service was excellent. Chef Andy was very attuned with us and definitely willing to listen and change according to our needs. \n\nI think a huge part of the experience is also what you bring to the table. We started off fairly quiet but we really pursued our chefs and started conversations. Yes we talked about the fish, the origin, his training, and his expertise; but we also took the time to get to know him. The chefs give back what you put in because they're reading your level of comfort. It was such an amazing experience. \n\nSome highlights for the food: \n- lean tuna sashimi: this was so wow! Extremely tender but still firm in texture. The flavors definitely lingered on my tongue! \n- uni: straight from Japan !! shipped within 24 hours, perfectly briney with such sweetness (I think this could have been my favorite of the night.) \n- monkfish liver: creamy richness that I'm still drooling over! \n- clam and live lobster: first of all, the plating was beautiful (thanks Chef Jackson). Secondly, the juxtaposition of the two were so well thought out! Flavors were simple and subtle, the textures really took me on a trip. \n- otoro: not much to be said here really. Melt in your mouth, taste bud-exciting otoro \n\n\nI could go on, but it's seriously worth a try! I had an amazing experience. (literally the third time I've written this sentence in this review) This is a serious business and I can't wait to find my way back here again!", "author": "Tina Y."}

The 4.5 star rating is baffling regarding the quality of the dishes we received. Host girl was awesome, attentive and professional. Waitresses did their job of introducing each dish well. \n\nThis 2 star rating is a direct grading of the sushi we received. Checked in with the waitress towards the end and asked if it was a combination of different chefs creating different dishes for each party throughout the night, but turns out a single chef will be assigned to your omakase experience - our Chef's name was Jackson (\"Jackson-san\"), and as a caveat, it might have been a unique disappointment with his lack of experience or selective sloppiness in preparing our courses since we chose to sit at the tables instead of at the bar.\n\nIncredibly disappointing and I'm no hyper-cynical food critic by any means. but the sushi presentation, the rice, etc was no better than something Ryoko's in the TL would serve (or maybe slightly lesser than)- in itself a decent restaurant but to be purportedly on the level of Kusakabe and Maruya in terms of quality and price, it was a huge fail and an extremely painful bill to justify.", "author": "virna d."}

My manner of consuming food is more like a possessed vacuum cleaner in an 80's horror movie.... \n\nThis is exactly why omakase have come to be, for me, like yoga, meditation, or sunday services is for others... \n\nAt its best It is a slow, subtle, and deceptively complex way of experiencing food that helps me to explore the and expansive breadth of my human ability to feel and sense...it helps me connect to something very real and transcend any hint of carelessness or clutter. \n\nI do not pretend to be  an authority - and of course there are HUGE  exceptions - but for me, very very very personally and intimately... I like a chef that can, like in church, act as a priest (or in sad rarity priestess).\n\nWe are gathered together here to experience the fish... and not the ego of priest or priestess...  his or her art is in crafting an essence of flavor that lets us experience the perfection that God touched in that piece of submarine flesh - and through that our own perfection in Gods image. \n\nOmakase Did that -  I never tasted 'the chef' but felt always focused on the fish. He did not drown the fish in fermented sauces - But for most of the meal... and it PAINS me to say this... I was bored. \n\nThe service here though... was immaculate... breathtaking I dare say. \n\nThe only 3 courses (that were not subtle) but that really helped me leave my body and touch something more important than my phone the courses on the more expensive menu - something did not sit right with me there... most of the rest of the time I caught myself texting... which I eat omakase to forget... I had been spoiled by such good fish in this fair city - that demanded true perfection. \n\nI give it 5 stars 'against'  most 'sushi' you will find - but for the price, and compared with the other omakase in town, it fell flat for me at 3. \n\nI hung a lot of hope on this place... and it was beautiful... just not transcendent.", "author": "Eric T."}

Not because it was really really really expensive ($500+ omakase for two). But because I really really really wanted to have another good omakase experience close to home. Shiro in Seattle was amaze-balls...Wako near Geary was orgasmic...Omakase on Townsend was (insert negative expletive).\n\nAm I being too harsh? Maybe.\n\nBut let me explain.\n\nI overhear the chef talking about how much he paid for his knives. $3000 for one even. I'm thinking to myself, damn his knife skills must be on fleek! I start getting excited! Then the first sashimi dish comes out...\n\nI look down at two pieces. And look over at my girlfriend's two pieces. I know there's always going to be size discrepancy, but one of my slices was like 70% thinner than hers. I pick it up, she notices it too, and kindly switches pieces with me because you know I'm a grown man! Whatevs no big deal but I note it.\n\nThe courses start slowly trickling through and on the most part everything was ok. Nothing to write home about and not very creative. I think 4-5 of the sushi had the same dressing so I couldn't really distinguish the fish. You could've cut up a goldfish, blowtorched it, dressed it, and it would have probably tasted the same.\n\nBut then something happens that has never ever happened to me at any high end Japanese restaurant...actually not even at a sushi boat place!\n\nA sushi piece comes out and I put it in my mouth, start chewing, and chewing, and chew some more. I realize I have fish grizzle in my mouth...you know like when you bite into a badly cut piece of steak and get tendon. Mother...of...God! I need to spit it out but umm there's no trash, or napkins, or a place to hide it...it's an omakase dinner so the chef is looking right at me, the waitress is at my back, and other customers are to the left and right of me! So I tuck the grizzled piece under my tongue and excuse myself to find the bathroom where I promptly spit it out.\n\nWhat the what!? How does that happen with a $3000 dollar knife? And at $500, I just spit out like $40 bucks!\n\nMy girlfriend is laughing at me until two dishes later, it happens to her too! Her gag reflexes are faster so she spits it out onto her lap and wraps it in her cloth napkin. But it's one of those restaurants where when you leave for the bathroom, they pick up your napkin and fold it for you! Yeah, who's laughing now?\n\nThis should never happen and it actually happend twice to me like watching a movie from M. Knight Shamalan that you know is gonna be bad but you give it a chance and then after the movie, you want to find where he lives and kill him. But I digress...\n\nThe service here was quality. The ambience was nice and cozy and inviting. But the omakase was mediocre at best. I don't mind paying for exquisite food experiences. But leaving this place, I felt like I was robbed, like I went to Vegas and lost all my money on the first night of a week long vacation, like I read all these good reviews on a restaurant on Yelp just to find out that wow, peeps give out stars way too easy peasy, lies I tell you!\n\nAww I hate writing bad reviews but this is just a detour sign on the road to omakase nirvana.

They also take credit card information at the time of booking and charge a $75 fee for bookings cancelled within 48 hours of the reservation. Not quite sure how strict they are on this though.\n\nMy entire group opted for the $150 set. It was A LOT of food for me and my girlfriend, but the boys seemed satisfied with the amount. I'll definitely go for the $100 set next time around (yes there will be a next time). Everything was PERFECT! I can't get over how good the fish is here. I don't even like uni and it was AMAZING!!!!!! My favorite was the monkfish liver, which I normally do not like... \n\nChef Andy was incredible. He made the experience 100x better. I could really tell he puts his heart and soul into what he does. Not only was he extremely informative, but also funny as hell! I would highly recommend requesting him for your next visit :) Chef Jackson came by a few times to chit chat (drink), and have fun as well. These guys are the real deal.\n\nThere's absolutely nothing bad I can say about this place, the food or the service. Perfection I tell ya! 10/10 would recommend.", "author": "Anna M."}

Convenient, since this is all they offer: a Hideaki Omakase for $150 and a Yamato Omakase for $200 with a few extra courses).  It's really a 4.5 star experience -- the quality of fish was excellent, and the chef was both friendly and skilled.  However, it's $25-100 more than similar dining experiences elsewhere -- half of that might be a San Francisco thing, but it's a bit expensive for what it is even in SF.\n\nI'd strongly encourage making sure you get seats at the bar.  There are two 2-seat tables in front; you do not want those.  It's also a relatively small restaurant, and if you have loud people showing off eating at the same seating as you, you're probably not going to have the immersive dining experience you seek.\n\nDinner starts out on a high note: complimentary glasses of Krug.  It's like first class on Singapore Airlines!\n\nThe menu changes from day to day based on availability and seasonality, but there was excellent sashimi of several types, 12 nigiri (although a bit heavy on flame-seared whitefish of various varieties for my taste), an amazing piece of A5 beef, some of the best uni I've had (matched by Morimoto's in Philadelphia), and a really amazing lobster miso soup (made with the shells of the lobster served as sashimi salad in the first course.)\n\nI'd definitely go back, but at the price, not frequently. A superb dining experience, and totally worth going at least once.", "author": "Ryan L."}

I came across Omakase while perusing yelp to satisfy my craving. It's relatively new compared to the sushi restaurants of similar caliber but I knew immediately I wanted to try this place. Simply because I was craving omakase and this place has stellar reviews and only serves omakase. Perfect!\n\nNot that hard to choose which set you want, just ask yourself how much you want to spend for good sushi? For me... TAKE ALL MY MONEY.. just kidding but really I don't play games with good fish. \n\nThe restaurant is very intimate. There is only bar seating and you are elbow to elbow to the person next to you. I didn't mind this too much since my neighbors were great people to talk to. You get to see the chef at work which I love. I'm fascinated at how they prepare the food. My boyfriend and I of course chose to go all the way with our sushi experience and did not regret it.\n\nAll the fish served were fresh and seasoned/dressed to perfection. The nigiri sushi needed no extra soy sauce or wasabi... it was perfect. The fish to rice temperature was superb. The fish was slightly cold and the rice a little warm to provide the perfect contrast in your mouth. The sashimi was melt in your mouth. We had a beef dish as well and that was excellent. The beef was tender, juicy, and so full of flavor. One of the best I've had. Even the ginger they provided in between each sushi piece was delicious.\n\nFrom eating here I've learned:\n\n1. Monkfish is the foie gras of the sea. I've never had monkfish this good, ever in my life. I thought I hated it from trying it in other places but Omakase has shown me the light and now I can't go back.\n\n2. I didn't even know Uni could do something other than melt in your mouth. The uni I had here was juicy, firm but delicately soft at the same time. It was a whole new experience.\n\n3. Fish prepared correctly is one of the most rewarding things you can taste. Every single piece of fish served to me was 10/10.\n\nMy boyfriend and I got lucky and picked a night to eat when Chef Masa was preparing. He used to co-own Maruya in SF but left and know he's consulting for various restaurants, Omakase being one of them. He is an expert at what he does and we were both glad we could enjoy it. \n\nDefinitely can't look at normal sushi the same way again and I wouldn't trade if for anything. Omakase was wonderful and I would definitely come back again!\n\n***TIP: come hungry if you're planning on going all out because it is a lot of food.", "author": "Jennifer H."}

Much has changed since then. The immediate difference you notice is the seating. They now pack way too many chairs at the sushi bar taking away from the dining experience. Now to the actual food - the sushi rice was over done and didn't hold well. The pieces of fish offered were also underwhelming. Worst of all was the chef that was taking care of our section. He was very rude and even aggressively chopped my piece of sushi before handing it to me when he misunderstood something I said.

The freshest sashimi from Tsukiji Fish Market flown in 3 times a week and exquisitely-made sushi rice served at the proper temperature, the grains dispersed on the tongue with the greatest of ease.  Favorites included barracuda as well as several others whose Japanese names I unfortunately cannot remember.\n\nThe experience was good, but not particularly memorable.  Our sushi chef turned out to be the most seasoned of the group (Chef Gen?) and he did an excellent job from start to finish.  I do wish that it was more interactive though as the language barrier made things a bit difficult.  By the end, my brother and I were kindly asked by the waitress if we were still hungry...actually, we were a bit.  We decided to wrap things up though and we were both surprised and honestly, disappointed when all we received thereafter was a check.  No finishing sweet bite or any dessert items to speak of, just a feeling of being left totally hanging after some red miso soup of all things...\n\nDon't get me wrong, the sushi was wonderful.  But at this price point, I was expecting a fair deal more out of the experience.  Perhaps this is just the way sushi restaurants of this caliber operate with the focus almost entirely on the food.  If that's the case, I'd rather spend my money for a far more involving and encompassing experience at a two Michelin star establishment or similar.", "author": "Eric F."}

I believe that the more expensive set included Kobe Beef, two additional nigiris and another small plate.

I usually park my car around the area and go next door for starbucks. So, the opening of Omakase wasn't new to me. I've actually bookmarked this place for the longest time and waited a long time for the occasion to book a reservation. \n\nAtmosphere: \nThe place is small. They only have 18 seats total. The sushi bar sits 14 people. There's 2 small tables near the window that seats 2 each. I wished the lighting was a little brighter, this would have been perfect for all my instagram worthy photos. Interior design was along the lines of minimalist appeal with an added touch of some Japanese decor. \n\nService: \nWe were literally greeted immediately at the door by a staff who was dressed in a kimono. She asked us to take a seat at the waiting area while she prepare our seating. She also offered to hang our jackets if we needed. Moments later, another gal guided us to our seats. The one thing that I liked was the offering of a small basket to put the girls purse. It's rare that a restaurant here in the USA offer such service, but this is very common overseas, especially in Asia. \n\nFood: \nWe had a party of 5. Three of us went with the Yamato Omakase $200 set and two went with the Hideaki Omakase $150 set. They originally has a $100 option, which is no longer an option. The difference between the two that we order was two additional pieces of nigiri, one plate of \"live sushi\" and one osusume. The word \"live\" made me do a last minute switch. I wanted to see if they would serve something that was really live and still jumping and moving on the plate, but I was disappointed to find that this wasn't the case. The \"live\" sushi plate was lobster and mirugai. None of those were actually live or moving. =/ They did not have chawanmushi the day we went, it was replaced with steamed butterfish. I didn't have a problem with that since the butterfish was soft and well prepared. Nigiri was well prepared. The rice was seasoned properly and the fishes were garnished. Chef were able to properly enhance the taste of each piece of fish. Our expensive option also came with a small cut of a5 Wagyu. Lastly, I forgot to mention the complementary pour of sake (loved it). \n\nNitpicking: \nThere was a small fly (perhaps fruit fly) that was buzzing around and did end up resting on the sushi bar. Nigiri rice was on the softer side. One of the spoons used for the uni & ikura rice bowl had some splinters on it, almost cut myself but I asked the sushi chef to change it.

Other places offering omakase have opened and the quality has gone down here. Now the people giving it one star because the meal is too long or expensive are ridiculous. Go to Japan and order omakase at a higher end place and it can be just as long and far more expensive. Yes some of them take under 1 hour and are no frills but that's not the style of this place and some places in Japan. This place is styled as a special occasion place and that's what you get. It's an excellent place for people that like Japanese food but aren't super knowledgeable. for people more knowledgeable it may be a bit of a disappointment with the way they have simplified a lot of the nigiri and the rigidity of the menu. Also it tends to be more traditional than a place like Ju-Ni but I think it also will appeal to more people. The small intimate setting makes for a tranquil dinner.", "author": "DeathandFood H."}

Even the sushi rice is timed/cooked depending on the time of your reservation AKA arrival. I mean... how cool is that??\n\nThey take the extra step to ensure that each guest enjoys the optimal temperature for sushi rice.  Not too cold, and not too hot. Just perfection.\n\nEvery single item we had was phenomenal, there were even pieces of fish that I've never had before! Head Chef Jackson (who goes to Tokyo every year to practice his art) explained that since some fishes on their menu are so expensive and rare, 99% of sushi restaurants in the U.S do not carry them.\n\nFor more deets and pics, visit http://cyneats.com/omakase/", "author": "Cynthia L."}

The chef's complimentary dish, the sashimi, the nigiri - all of it made the meal perfect.\n\nBefore you even get settled the chef gives you a kanpachi rice ball with a special sauce which was one of the many highlights. It was SO good. My boyfriend and I were joking about them doing this on purpose to hook you in so you'll order the $200 omakase option afterwards. They also provide a complimentary glass of champagne. \n \nMy favorites:\n- Sashimi appetizer (it came with mirugai clam too!) \n- Sardine nigiri\n- Aji nigiri\n- Barracuda nigiri\n- Toro nigiri\n- Uni, caviar, ikura, shrimp serving\n- Scallop appetizer\n\nIt was hard to remember all the nigiris we ate but they were all SO fresh. The seasoning on each of the nigiri topped it off even more! I was talking to someone next to me about how that toro was probably the best toro I've ever had. Same with that uni/shrimp/ikura. I really hope I'm not overhyping this for anyone. If you really want uni, you might need to get the second omakase option. It seemed like those who got the $100 option didn't get the uni. But who knows? The omakase selection probably changes every day. \n\nThe experience and the food makes this place worth five stars and the money.

I was relatively unimpressed with the beginning courses. The tomato tartare seemed too basic and the amuse bouche didn't seem to fit with the meal. I loved the freshness of the cucumber and crab salad, which was the one dish that really started the meal for me. The following 12 pieces of nigiri were all incredible. They don't try to stuff you with rice, layering on a generous piece of fish on top of just the right amount of rice to balance it out. The hot wagyu beef course was a good shift from the fish courses, but relative to the other hot dishes at other omakase restaurants, I wasn't blown away. We finished the meal with a mochi that had both sweet and savory elements, which was surprisingly good.

The omakase itself was drastically different. We had a wide variety of dishes and nigiris -- more than any of the other omakases I've tried in the city (Kusakabe, Ju-Ni, etc). Given that the lack of variety and innovation was my primary complaint last time, I really appreciate the change. It also speaks to the fact that the fish is routinely changed according to what is in season. \n\nSome of my favorites: \n\n-- Seared toro to start and raw toro to end \n-- Blue fin tuna and Halibut sashimi marinated in kelp \n-- Chawanmushi with uni \nI love egg custard and I love uni so it's unsurprising that I enjoyed this. The egg custard itself was not very flavorful but I actually liked how it didn't distract from the the uni. \n-- Torigai heart clam\nI haven't found this in many restaurants in the states so I was pleasantly surprised! \n-- Line caught Aji (Japanese Horse Mackerel)\nWhile Aji is a common fish on most sushi menus year-round, it is mostly farmed. I highly recommend line caught Aji when it's in season and Omakase's is easily one of the best I've had. \n-- Seared kinmedai goldeneye with himalayan salt \nDeep sea fish. Slightly sweet and so tender. \n-- King salmon with cherry blossom leaf (?)\n-- Uni with ikura \nObviously. \n-- Ankimo\nI wish I had gotten this last time. In fact, I wish I could get this everytime. I highly suggest adding this if it doesn't come in your omakase for whatever reason. It is so different than any ankimo I've tried. The texture is much smoother and softer. There is a deep \"liver\" taste that is not overwhelmed by an excess of ponzu or soy. \n \nThe last thing that makes Omakase one of the top sushi restaurants in the city is how attentive and impeccable the service is. My sake cup was always filled. My napkin was always folded when I returned to my seat. Most importantly, even though my girl friend can be picky, Jackson accommodated her very generously! When she didn't want saba (mackerel), he gave her *live clam*. When she didn't want a large portion of uni, he gave her *amebi (sweet shrimp)* topped with a small piece of uni. Needless to say, I was a bit jealous!", "author": "Xinxin W."}

I knew I wanted to take my boyfriend for his birthday, so booked a reservation as soon as I could (3 months out on OpenTable). If you are particular about what time you want to eat, then book early since there are two main sessions for dinner - 6pm and 8pm. You definitely want to budget out time for a 2-2.5 hour amazing dining experience.\n\nAmbiance is quiet, traditional Japanese (think Jiro Dreams of Sushi, but not as intense). Lighting is dim and romantic. Not the best for picture taking, but you're also not really supposed to take photos. Just let yourself taste the incredibly fresh fish (the big-eyed snapper was my favorite), uni, and sake. You can add a sake pairing with your selection of one-out-of-two Omakase menus. We went with the Yamato Omakase for $200/person with a bottle of sake to share. Don't let the sticker-shock scare you too much because it is worth every penny with the quality, presentation, and service of the food/drink.\n\nI don't normally give out 5-stars, however, Omakase is more than worthy of this rating. I highly recommend Omakase to anyone searching for a new kind of eating experience. But warning, sushi will never be the same afterwards! Happy eating!", "author": "Paige M."}

It was to the point where I wasn't even hungry anymore because I just wanted to go home. I'm sure on a regular basis it wouldnt have last that long as they usually have two batches per night (around 2 hours) I'm sure they just over booked that night, but timing and pacing is extremely important for this type of dining at this type of establishment. In terms of the quality of the food, it was good but I can honestly say I've had better in at least two other similar establishments in the same city.

I'm glad I went with this option because it was just the right amount of food. I wasn't overly stuffed that I had to shovel food into my mouth but left very satisfied.\n\nAlmost everything from the fishes, dishes, and the decorations are flown in from Japan.

It ruined my Christmas mood as I was here with my fiance on Christmas eve. It was such a disappointment. The food was mediocre, definitely not worth $200. The service was poor and unacceptable for a Michelin star restaurant. What a waste of 3 hours and money...\n\nFirst off, we were not greeted as we walked in. The waitresses and chefs saw me waiting but ignored me; not even a \"Hello/Welcome\". I waited for at least 10 mins before the hostess came to ask me for my name. \n\nWe were finally seated and the hostess told me the bar was full when I requested for the bar at the time I made the reservation. The people that sat at the tables (only had two tables) did not receive the same attention as the people who sat at the bar. We were totally neglected! Everytime our tea kettle was empty and I had to wave down the server to give us a refill. I even lifted up the kettle cover to show them it was empty. Of course they were too busy serving the guests at the bar. \n\nFood wise, the guests at the bar got to eat each nigiri (12 total) as the chef finished making it. But because we sat at the table, we had to wait until the chef finished making the 3rd nigiri before we were served. So basically, we had to wait till the guests at the bar finished their 3rd nigiri before we can eat our 1st. The part that pissed me off the most was the chef gave bigger portions to the people at the bar! Even the head chef Jackson was questioning why the portions were so big. I mean, we are all paying the same price right? \n\nThe hostess handed us the bill along with the last course. I guess they wanted us to leave asap. I still ended up giving a 15% tip at the end, which I will always regret as I should not have even given a dime. As we walked out, no one said \"Bye/Thank You\", like we never existed. \n\nTip for future customers: Make sure you get a seat at the bar or else you will be neglected. Or you will need to know Jackson at a personal level. That night he had some high school friends there along with his first customers.

I personally have not developed a taste for sake yet but whatever they served there was absolutely delicious! It was light, slightly sweet, and paired very well with the meal. I really need to find out the name of the bottle. This could very well be the start of my sake fandom. \n\nWe opted for the Hideaki Omakase option for $150. We sat at the bar and were served by the chef owner Jackson. Each set came out perfectly timed. Everything was perfectly seasoned. My favorites of the night were definitely the two sea bream nigiris (the baby and the uncle as Jackson put it). They were rich, full of flavor, and just melted in your mouth. The only thing I wasn't a fan of and didn't finish was the lobster agedashi. The shrimp-uni-caviar-gold leaf bite was also to die for. Did you know that there are actual gold in those edible gold leaves? \n\nWe had a nice conversation with Jackson too as well as the couple who was sitting next to us. I must also give a shout out here to our host Justin who opened our eyes to the real world of the wagyu beef and explained the misnomer between kobe and wagyu. After this evening's food and this evening's conversations, I am really inspired to finally take that travel-alone trip to Japan this year.\n\nI understand they rotate the offerings within the omakase options.

It's become almost tradition that we go out for sushi for Greg's birthday dinner (last year was Kusakabe), but no matter where we were going to go, the inevitable fate of comparing SF sushi to Tokyo sushi was going to happen.  That being said, Omakase does a great job at putting in the effort to making sure you get an authentic experience despite being in Potrero Hill and right by Zynga's headquarters.  We sat at the sushi bar (which needs to be requested during the rez making process - there are two side tables off the sushi bar) and got to see all the live action up close.  We both opted for the $150 omakase option, which was probably the right choice given how fast we were consuming the sushi and all the other delicious appetizers and dessert.  Our Tokyo-born sushi chef was incredibly personal and made a few jokes along the way to ease the tension that sometimes exists in sushi bar settings. I REALLY enjoyed the glass of champagne that was given to us after sitting down, and also really enjoyed the pace in which we were given our food.  Pausing only take a few photos, I'd say that we ate at a fairly \"Tokyo\" pace where we went through our meal fairly quickly compared to our fellow diners.  I appreciated that our sushi chef observed our pace and took it into consideration when serving us. We had some fantastic nigiri pieces, the highlights being the non-standard fish that were served like the needlefish, but the traditional pieces like the tuna was delicious.  I enjoyed the lobster miso soup at the end, and the very light mango sorbet with sake was a perfect way to end dinner.  All in all, Omakase was creative without being over the top, which seems to place it somewhere in the middle between the crazy/chaotic atmosphere of ICHI and the serene and subtle scene of Kusakabe.  Sure Omakase is a little pricey, and if forced to make a decision, I would say that I prefer the more quieter experience in Kusakabe, but Omakase was definitely a fantastic dinner that's well-deserving of its Michelin star. Definitely fish for Michelin stars here :)", "author": "Lisa I."}

Again, 10/10 experience! We previously visited maybe a couple of months after opening. They have now refined their menu a bit, and there are a little more offering in addition to the nigiri. Also, on top of the 14 people bar seating, they've also added a couple of tables that seat two. The menu comes with a few \"appetizers\" in the beginning, including a sashimi dish, a chawan dish, and a couple of small bits with seafood, followed by nigiri, and end with a dessert dish (they previously didn't have dessert but now they do!). My family is from the same city as Chef Jackson, so we had a great time conversing (again). I caught up with the chef regarding my subsequent sushi experience in the city (tried out Wako a couple of months ago, on top of Kusakabe earlier last year before visiting Omakase for the first time) but prefer the quality of fish at Omasake. My mom was very happy trying all the different fish that are shipped straight from the Tsukiji market. My sister usually hates wasabi, but given the wasabi and sauce are added with the appropriate amount before serving, it just adds to the experience. Toro/Chutoro/Hokkaido Uni were some of the highlights of the nigiri, but man, the tamagoyaki! I'm always impressed by how amazing these tamagoyaki are, tastes just like egg! I was very full at the end of the meal, and the service was impeccable. We've now visited Kusakabe, Wako, and Omakase, and would rank: Omakase, Wako, and Kusakabe in that order. Omakase does have a slightly higher price point, but we prefer to have the fish to speak for itself in terms of quality (Wako tends to have more cooked stuff). We also prefer fish raw or only lightly cooked. The service at Omakase is also the best out of the three (maybe because I've gotten to know the chef and staff here much better). Kusakabe was fine but we didn't find the experience to stand out amongst the rest. Overall, a well deserved Michelin star, great experience, and amazing service. We'll definitely be back soon (again)!", "author": "Sharon L."}

When it comes to sushi, I stick to what I know (mild white fish, tuna, etc.), and I'm pretty unwilling to try anything outside of my comfort zone.\n\nThat said, when my husband and I decided to try Omakase, I made a promise to myself that (for at least $150/pp) I'd at least try everything that was put in front of me.\n\nI did, and I'm so glad.\n\nIt turns out I do not like uni or monk fish...but I tried them, so now I can actually say I don't like them...and it turns out I like just about everything else. I am of course, taking my new found love affair with strange and exotic fish from around the world, with a grain of salt. The fish at Omakase was so incredibly fresh, and so thoughtfully prepared, I can honestly say I've never seen or eaten anything like it.\n\nWe sat at the sushi counter, and it was so incredible to watch each course prepared. The chef was so talented, and answered all of our questions without hesitation (we had quite a few).\n\nAs expensive as this meal was, it was hand's down worth every penny.

I've been living in SF for 2 years now and have tried most of the highly rated restaurants (Michelin restaurants like Benu and Gary Danko included), and Omakase still wins as my #1 choice. The seating arrangement is extremely intimate and the sushi chefs have great personalities and knowledge of what the best quality of fish is during the season. Since its opening in the summertime, I have dined at Omakase three times! That averaged about once every 2 months! Every piece of fish is perfectly cut so that it has the right texture of smoothness and butteriness as it enters your mouth. The menu of fish changes depending what the best catch from the famous Tsukiji fish market in Japan is. I have gone so often that the sushi chefs there now know me by first name basis! If you are a sushi fan, absolutely try Omakase. It will redefine the way you eat sushi. Now I never eat sushi anywhere else. :P \n\nDetails about dining experience:\nThere are two omakase options: the $150 or $200. I have a smaller stomach and so usually opt for the $150, but ask the waitress what the extra items you get in the $200 option is! If you are like my boyfriend and can eat more, I highly recommend the $200 meal. \n\nEvery meal starts with a complimentary glass of champagne and a couple of starter items. Usually there are two starter items to open your palette. I like to also order the tea because it goes extremely well with the sushi. Then the fish assembly and sushi art begins. The chefs will take out freshly cut slices of fish and create the sushi right in front of you. At the end of the meal, you get a delicious shrimp miso broth and mango sorbet.", "author": "Lydia H."}

It might be, but for the $$$ they charge, its got some unexpected flaws.  \n\nPros:\n- fresh quality fish\n- well executed cuts\n- parking was easy on Sunday night\n- intimate environment with chefs\n- complimentary champagne\n- two kinds of toro\n\nCons\n- owner packs the seats in REALLY tight to the point that it was hard to eat comfortably\n- for $$$ the diversity in the seafood was lacking, $100 omakase in almost all other japanese restaurants in SF would have more than just fish, no uni, no ankimo, no ama ebi.  These aren't the priciest items.  Saving these for the $150 menu makes the $150 menu makes the restaurant seem overpriced.\n\nExplanatory comments:\n- diners paying $100-$200/pp don't expect the chairs to be so close that i'm shoulder to shoulder, elbow to elbow with other customers.  The space is so tight, it was hard to eat with chopsticks and made for uncomfortable eating.  This isn't tokyo nor tsukuji fish market where space is at a premium.  If you want to pack in customers and make a lot of $ I understand that, but at this price point, you're already making $, it's about the experience at this price point.\n- service was decent, servers tried to pour our beer in nice cups, but the servers have never drank beer, because the pours were all foam.  This is a lack of training in the wait staff. \n\nOverall Rating:  3.5*s  I want this restaurant to succeed, the diversity in fish was excellent, however, there's some unexpected flaws that should be resolved before they can truly be at the highest level.", "author": "Paul C."}

But for some odd reason there are two random tables to the side! Though the food was good i felt our experience was dampened by not being able to sit at the bar with the chefs. Instead of enjoying piece by piece and interacting with the chefs, our nigiris came in plates of 3 and served by waitresses in kimonos. It didnt feel like we had the whole omakase experience..but def paid the price.

It's completely immersive. The place is tiny. The Japanese servers are attentive and charming. The chefs are skillful and engaging. And of course the menu is absolutely pristine.\n\nIN BRIEF:\nIt's exactly as advertised: small bites of luxurious imported sashimi, nigiri and maki. They serve up some very original presentations, like a tiny and remarkably flavorful uni-don and a tekka-maki that is so delicious and simple it elevates the sushi roll to a whole new level.\n\nSO:\nIt ain't cheap. And if you're the 24-ounce steak-with-potato-and-veggie-side kind of eater, be prepared, because this meal isn't that. Although after the set menu, you can order more if your appetite demands and budget allows.

We booked the reservations for her birthday at least a couple months in advance without any issues.  At the time of booking, this restaurant had 1 Michelin star, and by December 2015, it had 2 stars - something I think is worth mentioning.\n\nThe restaurant is small (as expected) with their limited seating (similar to Yume), so that wasn't a surprise for us.  Service was excellent as the staff were all very attentive and mindful of what was going on.  The chef noticed I'm left-handed, so anything that came out with a utensil was placed on the left hand side; minor detail, but something that I very much appreciated.\n\nFood-wise, everything was amazing.  Everything tasted fresh, delicate, balanced, and just melts in your mouth.  The selection they have is very wide and maybe not so surprisingly, they have tasteful choices of everything including mackerel and uni  - both of which my wife isn't very fond of, but she actually enjoyed them here after a bit of hesitation.\n\nSo is this place better than Yume? Yes, but it does come with the higher price tag, so you get what you pay for.  I highly recommend this to fellow East Bay folks who are fans of Yume to try this place out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-21", "description": "I don't usually write reviews, but this place is just insane.  The tiger behind the counter just knows how to serve sushi.  I took my foodie friend to dine with the tiger, and he thinks that the tiger serves better sushi then the sushi that he got a Tsukiji market...and he just came back from Tokyo, the prior day.\n\nDining at Omakase was nothing short of magical!  Ok, maybe it's the sake talking.  But in all seriousness, I tasted uni, hotate, kampachi and maguro before, and fish (or shell fish) is fish!  But this is what's magical about it....the uni was sweet as mango, the texture on the hotate has more bite then usual, the kampachi just melts in my mouth like it was ice cream!  Last, he serve us the maguro.  Looking at the part, it looks like one of that tough part where you just chew and chew and chew.  But this wasn't.  It was smooth as the fresh snow powder on top of the the Alps just begging you to put on your ski and skid downhill.\n\nCase and point, the last piece that we ate was the tamago yaki.  I'm not much of a fan of tamago yaki, in fact, I would usually turn my nose up side and skip it.  Yet, somehow, I find it in my heart to take the piece into my mouth and really tasted it.  I'm glad I did it...the tamago yaki was well balance between sweetness and saltiness.  At some point, I sat there, chewing on the piece while I searched my soul and questioned myself if I had define these two flavors that I had known since the passing of my grandmother.\n\nSo if you are still reading this review, one small advice that I want to give to future diners.  Fish is...fish.  But be nice to the tiger behind the counter.  Load him up with good sake, and tell him to do his magic!  Tell him bring out all...I mean ALL that the knowledge that he managed to learned in the painstaking years of mastering his craft.  And you will leave the restaurant pondering...how did he do that???\n\nLast, a few pointers...service could be refined.  There seems to be a lack in...how can I say this...wabi sabi.  Things that came out of the kitchen can be a hit or miss.  For instance the tamago yaki...man, you hit it out of the ball park.  The miso soup...temperature was off.  I mean I learned from dating numerous Japanese girls, don't screw up on the miso soup.  Period.", "author": "Jonathan S."}

Hand ground wasabi, rock salt ground from blocks in front of us.

The decor is bland and the space is right next to another sushi restaurant so the sense of this being something unique just isn't so.\nbut more than anything the company in the restaurant killed it\nWe were unfortunately seated next to a young couple incessantly photographing their food with flash and posting all over FB and loudly taking  about it and looking at things on their phone. They did so many things that were hysterical in a fancy restaurant that I won't even bother to write about but needless to say this was not what I was expecting in such an establishment\nTurns out they are friends of the young owner who came over and just ordered one fancy sake after another and had the most obnoxious conversation right next to me. I thought the conversation hit a low with them comparing how fancy their cars were and bragging about a launch party complete with a limo and suite at the four seasons. But then the man started bragging about his trips to the Philippines and the gentleman's clubs he frequents and call girls he travels all over with when he goes.\nFrom the other reviews you realize I was not spying on them but rather sitting up against them, trying to enjoy my husbands birthday in a very small space\nI even asked the woman nicely to stop using flash photos(she would take about 5 pictures of every dish) since it was really distracting, she promptly forgot this and did it the rest of the evening.\nI keep trying to make the best of this, after all I was dropping 500$ for my husbands birthday.

Sat directly in front of the head chef and just sat and enjoyed dish after dish of amazing food.  Aside from the beauty of the plates the tastes were clean and delicious.  The decor was nice as well, very clean and modern.  The plates were gorgeous and each one for the 16 courses were different.  I also loved the different Sake glasses they used.  All in all a great experience.  I recommend the large menu because go big or go home.  The only thing I wish they had when I went was the menu written out because it's hard to remember all the great things I ate and I want to brag to everyone! I guess that's hard when the menu can change nightly.

From the moment you touch the front door, you will be welcome with exceptional service. This place made me feel like a princess. From the coat basket to wiping the drops of sauce on your plate, the servers here are attentive and knowledgeable. It's the little details that matters to me and it really shows that Omakase have a high standard for diners. The ambiance of this place is nice and quiet. I really like their decors and their choice of tableware. The server had a lot of patience with me in explaining their extensive sake menu as well as their omakase choices. If you have a question, just ask them! They will come back with an answer. I even asked them about their decorations on their shelf, lol. As for the food, it was melt in your mouth amazing. My girlfriend and I both opted for the yamato omakase along with the sake pairing. We also added the fresh special of the day, which was called \"Dragon fish\". I have to say the sake pairing is a must get with the omakase because you get to try a variety of expensive sake and the sake really brings out the flavor of the food. It was also very entertaining watching the sushi chef prepare our food in front of us and you can definitely tell these chefs have experience+skills. At the end of our meals, we were both stuffed and gleaming with happiness. I will definitely return next time as this place is now one of my favorite omakase restaurant. Also their sister restaurant next door called Okane is a must try as well! Overall, I would like to say thank you Omakase for fulfilling my stomach, until next time. ;)", "author": "Amy T."}

The restaurant has limited seating so it doesn't feel crowded or loud. You can actually carry a conversation with your dinner companion.  The setting is in such a way that you could also talk with the chef and learn about the fishes and the dishes -- which were absolutely delicious and plated beautifully. \n\nThere were many standouts from the 18 course meal, but sadly I can't remember the names of the fishes except 2 (Monk fish foie gras  (my fav) & flying fish) and of course the one I wasn't crazy about (Mackerel - didn't like it as a kid and looks like I'm not changing my mind.) \n\nFinally, the service was impeccable. These ladies were like ninjas dressed in kimonos -- around when you needed them and out of sight when you didn't!  I also appreciated how the hostess took my purse and coat and put it away for me -- something I can definitely get used to!

The three of us didn't have too much trouble getting a reservation a week out, and we all went for the 200$ Omakase menu.\nThe quantity of food was perfect, we left feeling stuffed but not uncomfortably so, the pacing certainly helped.There are three chefs behind the counter, and they seem to serve only the handful in front of them. Our chef (we didn't get his name) was very friendly and chatted freely, part of what I love about omakase style.\n\nHigh Points:\n- Raw lobster and roe were revelatory\n-I have never seen blue-fin tuna so darkly colored, outrageous taste\n-I have never seen Japanese beef (or any beef) with that level of marbling, nearly all fat\n-Uni was the softest and sweetest I ever had\n\n-Sake tasting, I know nothing about sake except I know I've had the sweeter nigori before. These were mostly dry, in a range of temperatures and flavor and aroma, very distinctive and ridiculously well paired.\n\nThe only cons I would list but not dock a star:\n-Music was soft but occasionally way too clubby, unzt unzt unzt music that was way out of place, are they trying to be a trendy night life spot?.\n-The price was definitely high, a result of SF being where it is today. But I didn't feel cheated.\n-One of my dining companions mentioned that the 12pieces of sushi in the middle definitely ran together. I remember thinking nearly everything was outstanding (except the conch) but I can barely remember them individually, there were just a couple too many soft sweet sushi preparations that muddled the progression.\n\nAnd the big question, I wondered if the chefs were preparing different dishes, We got the 200$ menu, and down the counter we saw folks getting served monkfish liver, which our chef never served. So either the 150$ menu gets some items we didn't, or the chefs vary what they prepare. Not really a complaint, just a question.", "author": "Rory K."}

The best thing about the night was the sake pairing, quite enjoyable variation of sakes in a wonderful variety of flasks and cups. The sushi and sashimi, however, were boring, and the presentation was sloppy. The first dish they brought out was a piece of hamachi covered in some sweet syrup that completely masked the taste of the fish. Then they brought out some veggies in a cream sauce that was just blah, if not a bit off. The sushi and sashimi were not horrible but were served with no care in regards to presentation. The one wagyu beef dish they served was not well marbled, even having a solid chunk of fat right in the middle. It would have never been served in any decent restaurant. The seared barracuda even had a burnt taste to it. I can't stress enough how disappointing this night was. At the end, we asked for a list of what was served and was told they do not have a list, but then they asked us if we failed to get any of the dishes. Of course, we didn't know, because we were unsure what was supposed to be served. I could go on, but I don't want to waste any more time on this experience. AVOID this place. There are better places in San Francisco for less than half the costs.", "author": "Jason D."}

The food is good but to be honest, I feel that's it's not much better or more unique than what you could get at many Bay Area Japanese restaurants for about 20% of the price.", "author": "Scott W."}

The selection of each fish and seafood item is flown in directly from Tsukiji market in Tokyo three times a week, so the quality is unparalleled. You can also choose the sake pairing with it for extra, but we enjoyed ordering sake carafes from the menu the waitress suggested. Have to say  each bite was mind blowing and thoroughly enjoyed the progression, i.e.) appetizers, sashimi, and the best, most fluffiest tamago I've ever had! Break the bank for the higher tasting option, to me it's the perfect amount of food and allows for the complete Omakase experience, Very traditional Edo style sushi at its best!", "author": "Su C."}

I'm probably thinking this is more of a 3.5 star review, but am rounding up.  I just wasn't as wowed as other spots, especially for the price.  I think Kusakabe is a better bet for a tasting menu experience.  For just sushi/sashimi, I have had better at Pabu.  It was definitely great sushi and the quality of the fish was excellent.  They had specialty items like Hokkaido uni and bluefin tuna, which should be expected at that price point.  I thought the three starters were fine, but nothing was really exceptional.  Contrast to meals I had in Tokyo or other cities where I can still remember specific courses even years later, I can barely remember what we had just a few days ago.  Service was attentive and the meal was paced well.  I left thinking it was good, but not amazing.", "author": "Michelle C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-17", "description": "Boyfriend took me here on my birthday.  Best sushi experience I had in San Francisco!  We opted for the $200 option and had Chef Masa as our chef.  Chef Masa explained where the fish was coming from, why he chose specific fish due to season and locality.  Not only we had awesome food and experience, we also gained knowledge of sushi.  Will definitely come back but will opt for $150 option instead because we didn't see much difference between $150 and $200 options.", "author": "Avril C."}

Traffic in San Francisco was crazy - it took us 45 minutes to get from our place on Nob Hill to City Hall.  There was nothing we could do.  We called twice from the car letting them know of our difficulties and their response was you have 15 extra minutes to keep your reservation.  That was not enough time - we needed at least another 30 minutes,  We were never told that there was such restriction on the arrival time.  I was charged $200 for missing a reservation that was not our fault.  There was no valet parking, so if you're late don't bother, it's very unforgiving.  For a place that charges such high prices to begin you would expect better service for sure.  With all the options in San Francisco pick another restaurant.  I don't care about their reviews; what I care about is that I didn't get to take my wife to dinner on her birthday.", "author": "James A."}
