The manager, Cynthia also does a great job at servicing customers whenever a customer has a complaint. The employees are great! Quick to make drinks and always servicing customers when drinks made wrong. Highly recommend!", "author": "Dayana H."}

I spent the day in the Polk Gulch, and I hopped over to study at this location after enjoying lunch nearby. Although I didn't have the chance to sit there, I enjoyed the window seating this location provides. Great for sipping on coffee and doing some people watching. \n\nI just ordered a medium roast coffee, but it looks like Starbucks has increased their selection recently. There were salads and sandwiches at this location, along with additional water and juices. The coffee was on point, but the customer service left more to be desired. Won't stop me from considering this spot again for weekend adventures. \n\nOverall a good spot, but I'd also recommend Philz right down the street.", "author": "Nicholas G."}

As a female that is much smaller than average (and perhaps violent) male homeless person on who knows what drugs, it is not okay for you as a staff person to let those people into the cafe and endanger all of our lives. You manage the store and you need to make sure it's a place where all of us paying customers feel safe. This time was just a homeless man cursing at me and giving me the finger but will he be even more angry next time and push me or harm me even further?

First, this location is one of the most disgustingly dirty ones I've seen anywhere in the world, and I've been to locations throughout the US, Europe, Asian and South America.  This one is the worst ... more food, spilled drink, and who knows what else covering the sidewalk just outside of this location than any I've seen anywhere.  Don't they ever clean?!\n\nSecond, there is rarely enough food inside.  9 out of 10 times I've gone there in the middle of the day, the food bin that should be filled with pastries is more than 3/4 empty.  Even though they are many hours left in their business day.  Does the manager of this Starbucks location just not want to sell food at all, so that he purposefully doesn't offer any?  Or is he trying so hard to keep his food cost down, that he never bothers to realize they will never profit if they don't actually offer sufficient product that people would want to buy?  Does he really not get that the reason people are not ordering more is because they don't actually offer any to sell?\n\nFrankly, even though this location is very close to where I live, I've taken to walking many other blocks to other locations much further away, as this one is pathetic.

Like most of the others I miss the smiling faces that used to be at this location.  They knew you and always had a kind word to say. Not these new folks.  So I had bought a bag of coffee beans, the Xmas Blend, got it home and brewed it. For some reason the taste was to say the least industrial cleaner tasting.  Not sure what has happened, I buy beans here all the time. At this location. So I took the bag in to tell the employee to just exchange it and she said we don't take anything back that has been opened.  \nNow I am furious I plan on calling the company because the beans are so bad that I am kind of afraid that maybe something was spilled on them. All I wanted to do was exchange them for another bag.  My husband is more than furious.", "author": "robbie t."}

I just started a new job over in this neighborhood and I was so excited to see a Starbucks two blocks away. The very first time I went there the service was ok, but they were sort of busy so being that I work for Starbucks myself and I know how rushes can be, I gave them the benefit of the doubt. However every time I have been there after that has been a complete disappointment. I am always helped by the same rude guy who acts like putting on a smile is a crime. I have never been greeted with a \"Hi\" or \"How are you\" which is Starbucks standard, I always get a \"what do you want\" or \"what are you having\" in a disinterested tone. There have been multiple occasions where my drinks have been made incorrectly, and every time I call them out on it they act as if I am bothering them. This is the RUDEST, most UNPLEASANT staff I have ever seen at a Starbucks. I'm not even sure how they stay in business.

That is, until I am at Starbuck's in Russian Hill. The barista's here always manage to make my drink incorrectly. This morning, I ordered a Grande Mocha and my drink did not have any whipped cream after I specifically asked for it. The same barista that made my Mocha this morning, had been consistenly making my drinks wrong the past five weeks. Once, I complained and said that my drink was supposed to be topped with toffee pieces and she rudely said, \"No it doesn't, we have never had toffee.\" To which I replied, \"Yes, I've had it before, why would I make this up.\" Then she said something like no sorry we don't have it and walked away. Then I asked if she could just put some other kind of topping on my drink to which she did, reluctantly. It would not have been so hard for her to apologize for not making my drink properly and offer an alternative to the toffee pieces instead of making me feel uncomfortable by asking her. I don't remember her name but she seriously lacks skills in customer service and skills in following directions and making drinks.

What I mean is that, you always know what you are getting. What you cannot rely on is the quality of service. \n\nI have had almost all good, even great, experiences here (one time they even gave me a free frappucino!), but I have on occasion ran into the girl who acts as if my being there is really putting her out. Personally, I really don't care, but I know how this can get some others' panties in a twist.\n\nMy favorite favorite drink is the Cinnamon Dolce Latte. You can order it \"light\" now, and even get it as a frap. Last Wednesday I went there around 9am, ordered a venti CD Latte, sat down at a table by the window and read my book.  About a half hour later I notice the man (picture a midage, balding man wearing sweatpants and a tshirt) getting excited. I try not to look but I can see him out of the corner of my eye. \n\nFinally I look away from my book and glance around the store.. thats when I see Gavin Newsom. I'm still puzzled and continue to look to see if possibly God had stopped in for a latte, but no. The man across from me is about to pee his pants over Gavin. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?... \n\nAnyway. Long story ... long... If it's good enough for Gavin.. well frankly, why do you care?", "author": "Valerie W."}

Howard Schultz envisioned a world of 40,000 Starbucks. This particular location causes me to envision a world of 160,000 baristas standing around chatting while the other 40,000 struggle to take orders, run the line and make coffee all at the same time. \n\nAnd if you frequent this location, you will still get  your standard Starbucks coffee with a smile. And it will be fine, as long as you don't ask for something mind-numbingly difficult (like no foam - that's a total stumper). But you might stand around in exasperation wondering how it could possibly take 8 minutes to make your drink when you are the only ordering customer while it takes your usual Starbucks by the office about 30 seconds to make the same drink even with a huge line out the door.\n\nI expect this sort of service from the Starbucks at the Metreon, or the airport, but not in Russian Hill. It's not bad per say, it's just not particularly good. And there's a Peet's next door and a Teavana across the street...", "author": "Ben R."}

Tables - ample. 7 outdoors (though I've never been here when it's warm enough to sit outside, thanx sf weather :P) , 9 indoors + 1 mini table (btwn stuffed chairs).\n\n2. Fireplace - yes! Not always on, however, even when raining/cold.\n\n3. Outlets - plenty, and well-placed within table-reach.\n\n4. Other furniture - 2 sofa chairs. \n\n5.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-11-26", "description": "I wasn't going to review starbucks because really, how many people check Yelp before choosing a mainstream coffee shop? But reading these other reviews, I thought I needed to add my two sense since this location is not getting it's due worth., \n\nYes it's \"small\" but very cozy. There are oversized leather chairs behind the fireplace which make that my number 1 spot to scout out when I enter the coffee shop. I personally would prefer a small location though compared to a large one for the more quaint feel; especially since Russian HIll has that cozy, neighborhood feel. There are also chairs and tables outside but lately it's been too cold to sit out there. I imagine they are quite nice though on a warm day. The baristas are all super nice and most of them have remembered every drink from the regulars. Sometimes I sit there, in my oversized leather chair, and marvel at how few people actually have to say the order. That's the greatest thing about this location; they remember your name and drink after just a few visits and are genuinely social people and fun to have a casual chat with in the morning. \n\nTo some of the other negative reviews about this location, FYI, in the over a year I have been frequenting this location, there has never been a girl with dreads working there. And everytime I have had a problem with a drink, (im very pickY) they have always fixed it and returned it PERFECTLY. So unless you're a complete jerk of a customer, I don't see anyone in that store being rude. Especially this mystery girl with dreads who actually doesn't exist...Also, there are 2 \"local homeless people\" that do hang out around Starbucks but 1) if you're afraid of the everyday homeless man on the corner then maybe you should move out of SF and 2) there is another one that stands outside The Bagelry/Peets selling newspapers so it's not like they are exclusive to Starbucks :)\n\nCan you tell I love starbucks?", "author": "Sarah I."}

There are three reasons why I like this one better than most. First, GREAT people watching, if you can get a seat. Second, they have this convection oven/microwave type thing (not every Starbucks has one) to heat their pastries, which makes their marginal pastries taste much better. Third, I HATE lukewarm coffee, which I find in most Starbucks.  At this one they actually make their coffee hot, so that sleeve they give you actually serves some sort of purpose. Other than that, the coffee is the same as every other Starbucks everywhere. Its the little things that make the difference.", "author": "All About Town .."}

Howie, seriously buddy, cash in some more stock options, even though your stock is down 44% from its year ago highs, but who cares, you can backdate them, and find a columbian bean farmer like Juan Valdez's rich cousin or something and tell him that you want to serve good coffee.
