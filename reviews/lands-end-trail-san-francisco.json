Lots of photo ops in this one little area, there's a large parking lot but also street parking.\n\nAll the reviews on here are super helpful and informative about how to find it and where to take pictures, so feel free to read people's advice before you go! super helpful.\n\nTips for if you want a picture with the labyrinth - while you hike, there's an easy small climb/trail that gets you down to the labyrinth. While we were there, this group of girls yelled up to us to see if we could take a picture for them (you know that situation where you want a group pic but you don't want to hand a stranger your phone and then climb all the way down while they have the chance to run off with your phone and you can never catch up to them?)\n\nWe took the pics for them and then airdropped them, I think this is a great alternative option if you're trying to get a group pic but don't want to hand climb back up and down or risk a stranger running off with it LOL. I felt like I had to put this in my review.\n\nAwesome views, cute little trails with multiple stops depending on how far you want to walk, many options (which I love). Enjoy!", "author": "Irena S."}

My travels have often taken me to many different parts of California, out of state, and hopefully it will soon take me out of the country. Although I love traveling for these sorts of things, I sometimes fail to realize what I have right here at home. Land's End Trail is one of those trails that OTHER people travel far and wide for. On any given day you will see hundreds of people walking along this path, many of whom are tourists from other states and countries. \n\nThe Land's End Trail is one of the most beautiful hiking trails in the Bay Area. It begins at the Land's End lookout and can be taken via the coastal trail all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge. As you begin your journey, you'll pass by the historical Sutro Bath ruins. Here, you can admire the Sutro caves and what is left of the Sutro Baths. You'll be blown away by the sweeping views of the ocean and California Coastline. \n\nAs you continue your journey, you will pass Eagle's Point which provides a stunning view of the beautiful ocean down below. There are several pocket beaches along this path, one of the most popular being Baker Beach. There are a few great memorials such as the USS SF and World War II Memorial that you can stop by and admire. You can walk through the Presidio and get up close and personal with the old military batteries. My favorite part is reaching the Golden Gate Bridge! When it isn't cloudy out, this trail provides some of the most immaculate views of this bridge! \n\nEvery single turn on this trail is breathtaking! What I love most about Land's End is that it's suitable for just about anyone. It's a great hike for the entire family mixed with tons of California history. Perhaps this is why it never truly feels like a \"hike\" for me, but rather an enjoyable brisk walk through the beautiful city of San Francisco. There are a few inclines here and there, but for the most part it's flat and mixed with a combination  dirt and paved walkways. This is a great place to take pictures! You'll want to capture these views forever.\n\nUnfortunately with the crowd comes traffic and the fight to find parking. This is probably the worst parking lot that I've ever had to park at. During peak hours, it could take over a half and hour just to get OUT of this parking lot, and that's even if you can find a spot! The lot fills up quickly so if you're not out there by 8, good luck! I would HIGHLY recommend that you take public transportation or even a ride sharing service. Trust me, it will save you so much headache!\n\nIf you've never discovered the beauty of Land's End Trail, the time to do it is now. It's an experience that you'll never forget.", "author": "Shayla B."}

The Golden Gate Bridge is clear and you can see a lot of SF from that spot. If you climb the big rock above the maze, you get an even better view of the city. \n\nThe pebble beach is strange as there are many rocks piled on top of each other. It's a nice place to relax after walking a bit. The stairs on the way back to the top can be pretty tiring, but it's definitely a doable hike. We saw many doggies along the way too! \n\nThey have a parking lot here, but it fills up fast. We were lucky enough to find street parking right in front of the bathrooms.

You GO!\n\nMy main concern with most of my SF ventures is driving and parking my boujee luxUV around the city. On most occasions I'm an early bird driver and arrive around 7AM. That means doable street parking and a fighting chance for a decent out-the-door wait at my new beloved Andytown Roasters.\n\nLands End is no different. Matter of fact, there's even ample parking during lunch time when all the tourists and field trip groups come on weekdays. To my surprise, the ride remained unscathed the four hours there despite the signs of frequent break-ins.\n\nNow that's out, the featured trail spans a meager 1.7 miles from the visitors lot to Richy-McRichardson Richmond District. I can do that stretch (ahem) in my sleep and the final destination was always Baker Beach towards GGB. That took going through the Bel-Air of SF neighborhoods and some confusion walking past the same landscapers four times to get there.\n\nIt was overcast (duh) but a lot of pups and owners were out enjoying the breeze and each's company. You have your detours in Mission Rock Beach, the over-IG'd rock Labyrinth and the Sutro Baths. Those will all preoccupy your time on the usual one-hour hike.They're all worth seeing for the first time but best when the weather's playing nice.\n\nI'll downplay it just as a Sight to See for Review 300.

It is a fairly easy hike that your grandma can do. The full loop is about 3.5 mile, but it's not necessary to do the whole thing. You can just hike to the famous labyrinth and back. The labyrinth is located next to Mile Rock Beach. There will be a sign pointing you towards the beach. Once you descend down the stairs, instead of veering left and continuing down towards the beach, you need to head straight, up the hill, to get to the labyrinth. Although the Land's End Trail is nice, I still prefer hanging out at Sutro Baths, which is located towards the beginning of this trail. Definitely head down there and explore the bath ruins and secret cave. \n\nThe Land's end trail is a heavily trafficked trail, so expect to dodge people left and right at some point. No, it's not really that crazy, but expect a lot of people. Parking can be difficult if you come at peak time. There are multiple parking lots in the area and street parking as well. And it's all free! \n\nIf the weather is not foggy, you will have a clear view of the Golden Gate Bridge. It can get foggy on the coast however, so check the forecast if you want an unobstructed view.", "author": "Julia K."}

There is a rock a little offshore that sea lions live on. It also has a ton of bird poop on it. \n\nThe trail itself was quite nice. Not difficult at all, and it contained a lot of viewing points. I also appreciated how much of it was covered. Still, we should have put on our sunscreen.  We got burned. You don't need hiking shoes, but walking shoes are recommended. The trail goes along the coastline. We continued through a really exclusive residential area of million dollar homes. I'm talking upwards of $16 million and ended up at Baker Beach. In total, we ended up covering over 6 miles. As a reward,  we got a really nice photo opportunity in front of the Golden Gate Bridge.

This trail is easy to traverse (so easy that tons of people do it at night in the complete darkness!) *Note: there are no lights on this trail so if you don't have a light source (phone or flashlight) or don't like to hike in the dark make sure to get back to the lot by sundown! My sister in-law recommended this spot to me after our lunch together. While I grew up in CA and frequented San Francisco I didn't do much hiking back then. She immediately suggested coming down to this spot for great views of the water and the majestic Golden Gate Bridge. \n\nI loved every part of this trail and stopped frequently to take in the greatness of the views around me. There is a crisp breeze that sweeps up the hill from the water's edge reminding you that the formidable Pacific crashes not far below. In fact you can go down to the water midway down the trail by the labyrinth. In terms of accessibility, the main part of the trail is paved by the park and then hard packed dirt is pretty flat most of the rest of the way. \n\nYou don't need hiking shoes to do this hike, and it is easy enough for kids to toddle along if you choose to bring them (oddly I didn't see many kids when I was on the trail). I highly recommend this spot, even if you just want a quick peek of the water and bridge. There are views as soon as you get out of the parking lot here so you needn't go far to be impressed.", "author": "Tammy Y."}

If you want to take a break, stop by one of the many beaches along the way to just hang out and enjoy nature. Try your hand at rock balancing too! Of course, I had to check out the labyrinth which was way smaller than I thought it would be. But still, PERFECT views of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nGet there early because as it gets more crowded, it'll get harder and harder to find parking.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-02", "description": "Breathtaking would be an understatement, when describing this trail for two reasons:\n\n1) It's a very modest hike (physically), for someone somewhat fit. Your heart rate won't elevated too much throughout, hence not taking your breath away. (Ba dum, pssh.)\n\n2) The views of the beautifully colored cliffs, the Golden Gate Bridge and surrounding South Bay, flowers, etc... are more than breathtaking. Whatever that adjective is, they are all that.\n\nI, fortunately, following a post-dim sum feast, stumbled onto El Camino Del Mar and saw one of the entry points for this trek. And wow, I'm not sure how I can ever visit SF without doing it again. Things to know:\n*****\nI. LOCATION & PARKING\nObviously, with any route, there are multiple points of entry. I didn't see many lots on the east or north points, but definitely a few exist near Point Lobos. \n\nAbout the trek itself, it stretches several miles (three or four?) around the southern bend of the South bay. So it's relatively short.\n\nII. SIGHTS\nIf you start from the east of the trail, you'll have plenty of opportunities to snag a magnificent shot of the Golden Gate Bridge, in all of it's glory, and the amazingness surrounding it. They thoughtfully planned out locations where folks can snap Instagram-worthy pics, and you betcha I made a dent in my phone's battery.\n\nContinuing west, find a few jagged cliffs and Jurassic Park-esque forestry where you'll have the opportunity to eitherhike down to a Miles Rock Beach or USS San Francisco Memorial. I guess you could do both, but who has time for that? lol. --I only recall one barely challenging climb, which had a staircase made of ladders, but it didn't take to long to ascend to the top. \n\nEventually, you'll make your way to the Sutro Baths - a weird amalgamation of cement stones, caves, graffiti, a pond infested by seagulls. It's probably the least interesting stop on the route. Not pristine, either.\n\nMake your way a little farther, and you'll find the ever-stretching Ocean Beach. \n\nIII. LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY\nAgain, as I wrote, it's not very difficult at all, and it only requires a solid pair of shoes. I wore my Puma Suedes, a street style shoe without good grip, and made it through without any problems. I even carried my Macbook Pro, and other electronics, in my backpack. Ooh, and a to-go thing of dim sum, and barely broke a sweat. Really, it's so easy.\n\nI would suggest bringing a bottle of water, though. \n\nIV. OTHER TIDBITS\n-There are no bathrooms on this trail.\n-Charge your phone, because you'll take a lot of pictures.\n-It's a nice three or four mile trek.\n\nV. OVERALL\nI would absolutely recommend this hike to anyone that enjoys spectacular views, fresh air, and the feeling of being kick ass. And even if you are an experienced hiker, it's worth the glorious views alone. Do it.", "author": "Jonathan T."}

During peak hours, there are quite a lot of people at the Labyrinth, so you might need to wait in line to take pictures. And of course, come on a sunny and clear day so you can enjoy the best view possible!\n\nThis is a great spot for light hiking, or running. I would definitely come back again for the breathtaking view!", "author": "Karen C."}

They are open from 8am to sunset, though it seems that because it is a city location and fairly litted, the docents mentioned they are not that hard on imposing the time restriction. Access to the park is free which is nice.\n\nStarted off by dropping by the new Lands End Visitor Centre, a very modern and nicely decorated visitor centre. The docents are super patient with the endless flow of traffic. Picked up some maps for other parks too.\n\nWe started walking from the visitor centre, down to the Sutro Bath and up the stairs to start on the Coastal trail. There are alternative options to get to the coastal trail if you would like to avoid the stairs. \n\nHad wanted to check out the Lands End Ladyrinth, unfortunately, we went the WRONG way and missed it completely. As we didn't feel like going up and down the 360+ steps, so we took a snapshot of it from above instead. There are no good signages to tell you how to get there! Best is to ask!\n\n=== Parking\nThere are street parking available nearer to the Cliff House and a decent sized parking lot at the visitor centre. You may have to spin a couple of rounds before landing one but overall it shouldn't be that hard. Saw a couple of signages that highlight car thefts are common in that area, so reminder not to put anything valuable in your car or at least hide them.\n\nOverall, love the walk, pretty sure we will come back another time. \nOh yes, it does get a little chilly, so wear/bring layers!", "author": "Cindee T."}

It's a really simple hike, but more of a walk in the park with some small hills, stairs, and off trail paths. The best part of it all is that it's right next to Sutro Baths, another popular tourist hotspot. Two birds with one stone am I right? I would compare its popularity to be the Mission Peak in Fremont of San Francisco. This place always attracts tons of tourists so walking along the path can get really busy and slightly congested. I would suggest starting your hike from the parking lot. The other end starts at the Legion of Honor Museum, which is more situated in the residential area of Outer Richmond. Also, be sure to see Land's End Labyrinth on your way down the stairs! It's an amazing piece of art highly cherished by the local community. \n\nTIP: (1) Come here on a foggy day if you want quality photos of Karl the fog engulfing all the Cypress trees.

Walk the coastal trail, 0.8 miles. There will be a sign that says Mile Rock Beach and points down towards a long staircase. Go all the way down the stairs.

It's also great because you can start at the beautiful Sutro baths and depending on how far you want to walk, you can see mile rock beach and the scenic labyrinth with backdrops of the golden gate bridge.

This is also near the Cliff House where you can enjoy the food and scenery. At the Cliff House you are surrounded by the beauty of an ocean view, a fisherman, and the Sutro baths. \n\nThe history behind the Sutro baths was developed in 1894 by a self- made millionaire Adolph Sutro, who wanted to make a haven for people to enjoy recreational swimming. His baths could allow up to 10,000 people at one time! Crazy! Due to be Great Depression the popularity died down. A high rise fire destroyed parts of the facility in 1966 and what is left is the remains of the baths. \n\nTake the mile hike to the labyrinth and view of the Golden Gate Bridge. Along the trail you can see the VA hospital, take a few stairs up to the U.S.S. San Francisco memorial (very tiny), and finally to Lands End Point.  There are sandy stairs to the left that go down to the labyrinth trail and another trail to the right that is just sandy trail. The ocean current winds bring down the temperature to a bitter coldness. Walk in the little maze and take a few pics. Watch the cargo boats go by. Gaze at the Golden Gate Bridge view into the fog.

The Sutro Baths (located in the same area) are very cool if you read about the history beforehand, as there are no informational signs anywhere. \nAs this is also a dog friendly hike, unfortunately there are ZERO garbage cans on the trail. Being a responsible pet owner, picking up poop is part of the game and having to carry a bag full of dog poop for 2 miles is very disgusting. As a result, there are many colorful poop bags along the trail (I am sure from people that were tired of carrying it...I was tempted to drop mine as well, but just couldn't).\nAside from a few good photos and finding the Sutro Baths interesting, I wouldn't recommend this place/hike to anyone. There are plenty of other trails and photo ops at nearby trails that don't attract half as many people.", "author": "Steph T."}

The labyrinth area has an amazing, unobstructed view of the Golden Gate Bridge (if it's not foggy!) and the cliffs around. Definitely the perfect rest stop on this beautiful trail!

But, the views were so worth it! \n\nThe trail was made up of packed dirt. It was wide, which made passing slower walkers quite easy. Stretches of the trail were covered by a canopy of trees, which would be beneficial for runners on sunny days. \n\nAs it was for us, the fog was nice and thick.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-16", "description": "On days where I want to get out for a walk that includes scenic views but not feeling an intense hike, Land' s End fits the bill quite nicely. Whether it's a magical foggy day or a glorious crystal clear sunny sky, you will be amazed at how close you are to the hustle of San Francisco but still far enough removed to be in awe of raw and pure nature.\n\nOver the last several years the trailhead near the Sutro Baths and the start of the trail have received a facelift, with new signage, additional placards to read and well paved paths at the start. This is where the majority of walkers converge and the trail remains crowded for at least the first 1/2-3/4 of a mile. Not that the trail is by any means difficult, but this first portion is more pedestrian friendly and those visitors in flimsier shoes or fancier clothes will partake in this part of the trail. And why not? Gorgeous, vast views abound and on a clear day you can see the Marin Headlands and the Golden Gate Bridge. \n\nOnce the obvious photo ops trickle, the trail begins to lighten up a bit with visitors and the trails become every so slightly more rugged (dirt and gravel versus fully paved.) At about .7 miles, you can diverge down the steps to Mile Rock Beach and spend some time meandering down through the pines and clamboring over rocks to view the crashing waves and powerful surf more closely. I highly recommend going down this side trail and back up again to rejoin the Land's End trail, before continuing on our journey to Eagle's Lookout Point at the end of the trail. The stairs to and from Mile Rock Beach aren't super strenuous but offer a tiny bit of exertion and not for those who aren't physically able to do a lot of climbing.\n\nOnce at Eagle's Lookout, you can opt to turn back the way you came (the whole trail is less than 3 miles round trip-not counting any side excursions) or, as I have sometimes done, continue on the coastal trail which meanders its way through the Sea Cliff residential area and takes you over towards China Beach and Baker Beach. If you really felt compelled once at Baker Beach, you can connect with some of the Presido trails and head towards the Golden Gate Bridge via the Battery to Bluffs trail as well. I've done that as well as taken a side trip to the Legion of Honor grounds, which is closer to the start of the trailhead, near Land's End. \n\nAll in all, you are rewarded with bracing sea views, a variety of seabirds, coastal butterflies and if you are lucky (and it's the right time of year) whale sightings.

The view of the pacific ocean and gold gate bridge was gorgeous. Started our hike around 9am. Weather was perfect. I remember there was two different trails. All I know is that we took the trail going twds the Golden Gate bridge. The hike was not too hard, but the stairs though...a different story. We followed the trail and also went off the trail just so we can get close to the waters. We also saw the Labryrinth. Coolest thing ever. That is a must. We kept going and going. We finally ended up at China Beach. We did have to go through some residential areas to get there. I remember we were in the El Camino Del Mar area. Man....them houses. So gorgeous and big. The view from China beach was absolutely gorgeous. Couldn't resist we had to get in the water. I didn't bring change of clothes so only my feet and legs got wet.", "author": "Joann P."}

And there's also extra parking lot on the other side, that face away from the ocean.\n\n- Limited time: go check out Sutro Baths\n- Half Day: take a short hike to labyrinth + Sutro Baths\n\nOn my first visit, we only had time to check out Sutro Baths and the cave. It was once a popular Baths that got burned down back in the 19something. As for the cave, it's a small one where you get to explore further more to the ocean. Must wear shoes for this cause the area is pretty wet. \n\nOn my second trip, I intended to hike to the labyrinth so I was prepared to explore  the whole place. There are plenty of trails for you to choose from so it's hard to navigate anyone. As long you stay on the coastal trail,  it will take you there. We did a lot of exploring that day so we went all over. But once you get to the labyrinth, you can see the Golden Gate bridge from far away. Lucky us, it was nice and sunny that day so the view was spectacular! Walking around the maze was fun as well.\n\nI wouldn't call this hiking since it was an easy trail.

Also, one star all restaurants I ate at retroactively, because if I didn't chew my food properly I could have choked and died.  Or drowned in my soup...oh dear.

The steps are covered in sand, so you have to be careful when going down to the beach and back up as you won't be able to tell the steps distinctly.  \n\nI don't think I will get tired of this hike mainly because of the amazing views that you can see when the weather is cooperating of course. During the weekends it tends be very busy, but during the work week, there's less people, so you can enjoy nature more without as much noise disruptions.

Parking sucks, it's congested, often dirty/smelly, and all around not my preferred environment for living or hanging out. It takes a lot for me to make the trek into the city from the south bay, and I'm happy to say that the Land's End Coastal Trail is worth it.\n\nI'm a pretty nature-y person which is why I don't prefer urban environments, but the Golden Gate Bridge recreational and ocean beach area is quite pleasant. I took my dad to hike (or walk) the Land's End Coastal trail and it was the first time for both of us. It was a beautiful clear day and relatively warm for SF winter weather.\n\nParking understandably sucks on a Sunday late morning, but I was able to find some spots along Ocean beach, which is a short walk, maybe quarter mile, from the trail head. Plus, you get to pass by the Sutro Baths on the way which is also interesting.\n\nThe trail itself is easy and somewhat populated, but as others have mentioned, provides great clear views of the Golden Gate Bridge. It may be touristy, but it is beautiful. There are also a number of beach access points along the trail where it's a little less crowded (since they're off the main trail). The USS memorial I think is also worth stopping to take a look.\n\nThe coastal trail is 1.7 miles one way, so it can easily be completed in a morning at a leisurely pace with pauses to take photos. I think it would also make for a nice, short round trip trail run as it's mostly a dirt path and has a little bit of up and down terrain.\n\nBring a light wind breaking jacket that is breathable. Temperature can vary a lot depending on how far you are from the coast and whether you're in the shade. I found myself taking off/putting on my light jacket a couple times. Sunscreen is also probably a good idea.\n\nAll in all, for someone who hates making the trip into the city, I'm pretty happy I went.", "author": "Hain-Lee H."}

Then add in all the extra hidden paths, which there are many, and this hike can be almost 4 miles.  Only a small section on the Baths/Cliff side is paved, and a bit in the beginning at Eagles Point is kinda paved.  The rest is a dirt trail, many places uneven, and lots and lots of wooden stairs.\n\nWe parked at the Eagles point entrance on the street.  Plenty of parking.

A plus bc it's cool to feel like you're some place that's secret, but minus bc a lot of those secret trails you can see trash and litter from either transients, disrespectful litterers or people wanting to get high.  I wondered many times during the hike how many people go there to get high and wander off and fall off the cliffs and die.

As soon as we found a warm and sunny weather forecast that week-end, we grabbed the opportunity. The Coastal Trail in the Lands End begins in the parking lot next to the Visitor Center. We parked our car here and merrily took the trail that soon connected with the second parking lot where the USS San Francisco Memorial is located. The memorial was built to honor those who fought on the navy cruise ship in the Battle of Guadalcanal in World War II.\n\nAfter skimming through the placards that offer profound information about the battle, we continued on the picturesque Coastal Trail that took us along the Pacific Coast, offering sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge, Marin County, Hawk Hill, Point Bonita Lighthouse, Mile Rock Beach, Mile Rock Lighthouse.\n\nView of Golden Gate Bridge from a lookout in the trail - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yniMfk_yS1sk9dxPLDVchg?userid=nx7hGb1sjJFtmdNh5RHYQg#sm5MXzLxEms8CMcU5ioMTw\n\nLocated in the rockiest north western corner of San Francisco, the Lands End is known for its history of landslides that took away the lives of many people. The wild ocean currents, treacherous rocks and foggy weather have also caused 300+ ship wrecks. Although we could not spot, it is said that the remains of three ships can be seen from the trail during low tides.\n\nFollowing a devastating shipwreck in 1901, the Mile Rock lighthouse was constructed in 1906 in the ocean to warn ships of the perilous rocks. The lighthouse was later dismantled and converted to a helicopter pad. This is the first time I saw a lighthouse constructed in the ocean itself!\n\nMile Rock Lighthouse in the middle of the ocean - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yniMfk_yS1sk9dxPLDVchg?userid=nx7hGb1sjJFtmdNh5RHYQg#aE1i7sjIx0WEbByZYIg6bQ\n\nWe reached a point in the trail where a detour took us down through a long fleet of stairs to the Lands End and the Mile Rock Beach. The Lands End has a labyrinth, which was originally created by Eduardo Aguilera in 2004 for meditation purposes. It was a lot of fun walking in the maze. Another fleet of stairs took us to the Mile Rock Beach. It is hard to miss out the sea gulls and pelicans flying over the ocean.\n\nTrail to Lands End and Mile Rock Beach - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yniMfk_yS1sk9dxPLDVchg?userid=nx7hGb1sjJFtmdNh5RHYQg#pGu3vsT_qTW7VqXfj25O9w\n\nLabyrinth at Lands End - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yniMfk_yS1sk9dxPLDVchg?userid=nx7hGb1sjJFtmdNh5RHYQg#_9rJSJaguKIP4mzm9Gb5MQ\n\nWe continued on to the Coast Trail and reached the Eagle Point, which is the entrance to the San Francisco harbor. An amazing view of the Golden Gate Bridge and China Beach to the right awaited us here. This marks the end of the Coastal Trail and we returned to the parking lot via the same route.\n\nEagle Point; Overlooking China Beach and Golden Gate Bridge - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yniMfk_yS1sk9dxPLDVchg?userid=nx7hGb1sjJFtmdNh5RHYQg#T2Sp9QDySyQWasso7cbHZg\n\nHowever, as it was time for sunset, we stopped by the Mile Point Beach to capture a breathtaking view of the sunset.

The sunsets mirror a sense of deep thought and romanticism, as if it were perfectly painted by the hands of Michelangelo Buonarroti, himself. \n\nThe quiet trails lead to a secluded labyrinth and lays a perfect canvas for clearing one's mind and for open eyed meditations. \n\nWhat's nice is that you can get an adequate workout, yet can also appreciate the beauty that surrounds you. \n\nSo if you ever need to step away from the fast paced, quick moving, traffic jammed, electrifying pulse of the city, the nice thing is that you also get the gentle, quiet, awe enveloping, and tranquil quality of its split personality. \n\nA definite go to!", "author": "Ann S."}

THIS PLACE IS BEAUTIFREAKINAMAZING!\n\nI recommend going about an hour+half before sunset on a nice clear day. \n\nThe trail is nice. Not difficult to walk at all. But even before the trail, you get some really great views of the water. The trail itself is quite beautiful. (definitely take a camera) The trail is longer than you expect, so take your time to walk down the whole thing. At one point, we reached an area that was closed off, but you could easily just duck under the rope. I recommend you do it. You get some pretty great views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Just be careful!\n\nMy favorite part, however, was the sunset, on the beach. there is one path that branches off the main path. Take these stairs down off the path and it will take you closer to the water. On one side, you can see this cool design made of small rocks (like something alien-ish), and if you keep going down to the beach, you can get up right to the water. The sun will set from that side, and the views were breathtaking. I felt like I was in a postcard or a photoshoot. I wish i had a DSLR but my galaxy s5 was still really good at capturing the awesome views of the sunset over the rocks, beach, and water.   ... words cannot describe...\n\nI think this was one of the prettiest trails and views I saw in SF. \nI would love to go back and just sit on that beach watching the sunset. \ni also heard there are some kind of \"baths\" that you can go see near the parking lot before the trail, but I didn't get a chance to see that. \n\nSo yes, DEFINITELY recommend this trail for those who love beautiful views.", "author": "Yong K."}

Last time I only had time to just pop into the Sutro Bath but didnt get to hike or anything. First off, parking here is difficult. You will be circling for days as I did around Saturday at 1ish. So this trail is not tough at all. This is touristy so you will see those Asian buses and bunch of cameras. You dont need to wear workout gear for this but having flip flops would be cool if you want to chill by the beach. So if you want to see the labyrinth which is that circular maze that you see everyone and their mom pose at, then it is 1.5 miles to get there, 3 round trip. While getting there, you can wander to the beach and climb rocks and go through the trees and what not. It is a fun place to just explore and spend your day after a classic brunch in SF. I spent a good 3-3.5 hours just exploring and taking photos. You can get a view of the Golden Gate bridge and I think you can hike further if you please. Just to warn you, SF may be cooler especially near the Pacific but bring sunblock if it is sunny! Jeez I burned for dayzzzz", "author": "Amy H."}

You can actually walk out to the structure remains, but could be scary with high tide.  Saw some folks who came here to fish.\n\nThe trail itself is pretty short and they blocked off the end of the trail that loops around--don't know when construction is going to end, but it's pretty unsatisfying to get to the construction fences and the trail just ends there.  Nothing to do, but turn back around and retrace your steps back to the beginning.  Once it's fixed and I hike the whole train, I'm sure I'll be giving this place 5 stars.\n\nFurther west is Baker Beach and a restaurant and souvenir shop.  Passed on it, but seems popular.\n\nFree parking is a plus, but you gotta be vigilant and fight for it.  Upper parking deck is for permit-only cars (which houses cars that do not have a permit from what I saw).\n\nLots of shade, but can get hot if you're getting hit by the direct sunlight.

Just when we thought we'd seen an incomparably wonderful view, an even more spectacular scene was only a few steps ahead! \n\nWe're relatively fit (we already walked ten miles by the time we arrived...), so the trail didn't pose any difficulties to us, but judging by the number of children and older folks that seemed to easily navigate the trail, it doesn't seem as though it's very strenuous.

The trail is now well maintained and there have clearly been restoration projects in place to restore native vegetation. There is also the brand new Land's End gift shop where you can look out on the ocean, buy a coffee, or a gift. \n\nThis is both good and bad in my opinion. Before, hiking the trail seemed very adventurous to me. In fact, we should to go past the safe portion when the trail extended all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge. Quite scary. Now the trail is very touristy. There are tons more people hiking it and it seems rather tame. That said, the restoration projects have made a huge difference in the vegetation. It was so pretty. A variety of flowers and decent exercise too if you hike down to the baths, go up to the coast and hike down to beach and the maze (lots of steps so be warned). The labyrinth was disappointing (I vaguely remember the old), but it satisfied my 7 year old. \n\nGorgeous views. Made me realize anew what a special place San Francisco is. I was born here and it still remains my favorite city. Yes, it is always chilly, but the weather is perfect for hiking and running up and down stairs.", "author": "Nora S."}

The \"labyrinth\" is NOT impressive, so don't get your hopes up.  It looks like something a kid can make in 2 hours with a pile of rocks about fist size. You can finish this trail in 2-3 hours (we went all the way to through sea cliff to the lookout at china beach). If you want a workout, would recommend running this trail.  But easily accessible - just take Geary all the way west and you'll hit the parking lot. \n\nDipsea trail (to stinson beach): 5-7 miles, least accessible, but best workout, thanks to the steps.  Definitely will have some soreness the next day. MAKE SURE to plan out your logistics.  We drove to the mill valley parking lot, took a bus into the city, and had to find the trail from there. There are some hand-written signs but make sure you do your research about how to find the trail head.  Coming back, you need to take a bus from stinson beach back to the parking lot, which is a 45minute bus ride that comes only every 2 hours or so.  \n\nTennessee Valley Trails to tennesee valley beach or muir beach: Any length, as there are tons of trail heads.  You can take it really easy and choose the flat route (with lots of kids), or climb over various hills.  I like this one for how flexible it is and is only a 20-30min drive from SF.", "author": "Alice Z."}

It was such a wonderful scene to round a few turns and see the Golden Gate standing majestically out in the distance. \n\nI can see how you could kill some serious time walking the trails and all of the combinations of routes you could create for a run or long walk with the kiddos in a stroller.

On my hike through Lands End I happened to pass Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg walking with a friend and his dog. I wish I could upload my picture of him picking up his dog's poop, and yes even billionaires do it. Anyway it was a good little hike, here is my opinion of the trail in numbers.\n\nTrail Difficulty: 3 out of 10, 10 being extremely difficult\nTrail Views: 7 out of 10, Great view of the Golden Gate on a clear day\nOverall Experience: 8 out of 10, great outing for family, friends, and dates!", "author": "Diego S."}

The hike is very easy, its more of a walk. \n\nI went on a Monday morning, around 10am. It was perfect. There was still a handful of people on the trail. A lot of dogs as companions on the trail as well. Of course, the fog was blocking my view of the GG bridge, but it was still gorgeous being able to overlook the bay while taking a relaxing walk.\n\nI highly recommend it. It is a brisk hike, and will take about an hour and 15 minutes round trip. There are also some restaurants next door overlooking the water, which would be a great pit stop after the hike.\n\nDon't miss out on taking the stairs down to the sand! It can be easily missed!", "author": "Alique B."}

It was just a straight road and you can see the gorgeous Golden Gate. I went on a fairly sunny day and yet, it was kind of cold. My body felt so conflicted with the temperature, it was ridiculous! Because this trail is mainly by the water, one should wear a jacket. I was rather confused while on this trail because I really wanted to go to the famous maze! \n\nFirst off, once you go down to the Mile Stone trail (which very stairs oriented) and once you hit the end of the first set of stairs, go to the right. Not left because if you go left, you'll end up at this rocky beach area. It took us two tries to get to the maze. Kind of ditched it the first time and we had to go through those painful stairs again. \n\nThis is one of the prettiest hikes I've been on, just because I think it's by the water. If you keep heading on the main trail,  you'll end up getting to the cliff house where the bath house is at and this little cove you can go into. Although this hike was not that strenuous, my calves are in pain now because of all the stairs! I've been up the Duomo and that wasn't as bad! Which is rather sad. I think it's because the steps are sort of wide and not consistent in its size which makes it harder to walk down/up. My calves are crying right now and I stupidly didn't streatch!\n\nThis is a great place to go running and taking your dogs for a walk (which is what I saw a lot of).

I really can't think of anything bad to say, despite coming on a partly cloudy day.\n\nMy friends and I got off the main parking lot near the cafe area, and right away, you get a nice view of the Pacific Ocean. From there, you have a couple options to hike down. We took an adventurous route (by talking a somewhat of a narrow dirt path). On our short hike down to the ocean, we encountered a very small snake. Regardless, that was a bit of a surprise. \n\nOnce we reached the bottom, there seems to be an abandoned building area. You get to walk around it and reach the rocky shore. Pretty fun, it's like a labyrinth. Be careful though, some of the walking platforms have pot holes, so don't be like me and try to post your Instagram photos while you're walking. The reality of the many \"Danger\" sign may become true if you end up falling in the rather colorful (read - algae filled) ponds. \n\nFrom here, we went into an AWESOME cave. Waves are crashing right below you, so you get to hear the ocean roar. Quite an experience. \n\nThe rest of the trip consisted of a nice hike up to Eagle Point ( I think that's what it was called). We thought that was the path to the Lands End rock/maze/thing. But we didn't find it. Maybe another time? At the end of the hike, we found an exit (and mankind - hallelujah). We dreaded the idea of having to walk the entire way back, but thank god we didn't. \n\nFYI - Uber from Montgomery Station (closest BART station) is about a $13 uber drive there.

I'd say allot at least an hour or so for a leisurely hike on this 1.5 mile trail which gives you plenty of time to stop and shoot photos. \n\nGawk at the wide expanse of the Pacific Ocean.

It's also flat for the most part, then some stairs and slight incline to get to the photo op parts. I wasn't expecting sand, but I guess it makes sense since it's at the cliff. There are a lot of tourists, people training, and even more tourists. The number of tourists slightly bothered me when they would just stop in the middle of the trail to do a photo op, but at those parts, the trail was wide enough to accommodate other hikers to go around them.

The only drawback is that dog owners DO NOT CLEAN UP. I'm not sure if it's because of the government shutdown, but even then... it's the owners responsibility to pick up and throw away the dog droppings. On the trail, there was a lot of dog droppings. That or they were bagged but sitting on the road or hanging on a tree like an ornament. At one point I saw dog just squatting and dropping a deuce while the owners kept walking.

Its sometimes easy to get distracted by otters at Sutro Baths, waves off Kelly's Cove,  the Alamo Square puppies and Golden Gate Park hippies and hipsters but its all part of the experience of Lands End Loop. Be prepared to have your run extended by 15-30 minutes if you're easily distracted.\n\nSacramento St becomes Lake St as you head west and you'll find a lot of runners along this route. It's mostly straight and sometimes uninterrupted by cars. Somehow, our solid, disorganized group of after work runners have converged and we've thus claimed it as ours.

There is a pretty new visitor's center next to the parking lot to buy coffee, use the restroom, or buy souvenirs. Weather was mid-60s, no fog or wind, blue skies...and it's late december! Absolutely gorgeous with beautiful views of the golden gate bridge.\n\nThere are side trails that go down to the waves off the main trail, which casually winds along the side of the cliffs with constant views of the golden gate bridge. There are lots of trees that provide shade and there are some steps along the way. I saw lots of dogs, a few bikers, people with strollers. It's an easy hike and it took us less than 2 hours to leisurely stroll to the end and back while exploring the side trails. Note there are repairs at the end which the sign said should be completed by the end of December.\n\nOverall, an absolute must-see if you visit SF. It's trails like these that convince people to move to SF.", "author": "Kevin H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-11", "description": "I decided to do some exploring one day and find the infamous labyrinth that I've seen in pictures. Boy, did I take the long, hard way! \n\nTo make your trip easiest, here are some tips: \n\n- Want to see the Sutro Baths also? Park at the lot off of Point Lobos Ave.  \n- Want to just walk the Land's End path and most importantly, the labyrinth? Park at the lot off El Camino Del Mar. This is what we did. \n- From El Camino Del Mar lot, there are 2 choices - 1) face the ocean and walk to the right on the dirt path into the tree area. While this seems safe and easy, it quickly gets desolate. In order to get to the labyrinth and see the ocean closer, you have to walk down many many winding stairs. Though this is the route we took, this not my recommendation, as it's harder and views of the ocean are limited by the trees. \n- Instead, from the El Camino Del Mar lot, take the 2nd choice - 2) face the ocean and walk towards a staircase down. Although there are about 40 stairs, it's far less stairs than the other route. The stairs lead to the Coastal Trail and is a nice walk with benches and good views of the ocean.  \n- At this point, to the left is heading towards the Sutro Baths and to the right is the Land's End trail and to my goal, the labyrinth. You should head to the right and it will eventually come to a fork in the road with a sign for Coastal Access. Make that left and start taking the stairs down to the ocean. You can either go all the way down and you'll eventually hit an inlet at the ocean level with some logs to sit on and admire the view. Then you have to head upwards a bit and on a narrow path to the labyrinth. \n- If you don't go all the way down to the ocean, you can veer to the right and it leads you directly to the labyrinth. \n- The labyrinth is not on the ocean level but elevated. It is not huge but has a cool view of the Golden Gate Bridge. You can also go to a hill behind it to get a better view of the labyrinth. Walking to the back of the hill is the easiest way to get top of that hill. \n\nNot sure where you're at? Use the satellite view of Google Maps but try to stay on the Coastal Trail for the best experience.", "author": "Rachelle T."}

We started at Eagle Point and went off the course a little to enjoy a small breakfast and waited for the sunrise and it was beautiful especially since the bridge was still lit up. After the sunrise, we hiked around and there are small beaches that you can go to and a labyrinth that you can see. The trail also leads all the way to Sutro Baths and the Cliff House. Sutro Baths has a visiting center and you can read about the history of the location. There is also a food place known as Luigi I believe and if you are hungry from the hike just stop on by!

The Coastal Trail is a totally paved and marked trail, super easy to hike. There are unpaved trails that lead you deep into the greenery, to the water, or to a cliff (watch out now!). Going off trail is highly recommended, whether towards the water or further in towards the park and historic military sites. Again, I can't stress it enough, watch out for the cliffs, the random drops, the soft land near the random drops...ya know. They try to place signs at the danger areas, but of course, going off trail means you travel at your own risk.\n\nDuring my last visit, GF and I had a lovely picnic near a cliff. We sat under a large tree with branches over our head, the sun beamed on us through the spaces of the branches, our feet dangled over the cliff, we had a view of the trees with the ocean right behind it, we could hear the waves from a far, we could hear birds all around us, the aroma of nature was apparent...", "author": "Helen L."}

For all you out of towners, the fog hugs the city like a blanket in the summer. Otherwise, it is quite beautiful. The trail has some amazing views of the ocean. I highly recommend you go an hour before sunset. That gives you plenty of time to walk slow and enjoy the view. The trail itself is not bad either. It has steps that take you all the way up a hill then descends quite quickly, so make sure to bring water if you're not physically fit. It's a short hike but a little on the moderate side if you can't stand hiking hills. \n\nAlong the trail, you'll find plenty of benches. Perfect for an afternoon hike with your significant other. Totally romantic. Lastly, I recommend you start your hike from the north end which will take you all the way down to the parking lot and down to restaurants like Louis', the Cliff House, and Beach Chalet.

You get outstanding views of the ocean/bay and Golden Gate Bridge as you walk on a trail with very little elevation change. You can go down to the Labyrinth, or what used to be, and get a landscape view of the waters leading to GGB.  Unbelievable place to take a companion and take pictures.  There are many benches along the way that provide minutes of relief and conversations with someone else.  \n\nI came here on a semi-sunny Saturday which was perfect weather for walking with a few layers but not for taking pictures.  The top half of GGB was covered with fog and I decided to leave my camera in my backpack.  However, the views were still gorgeous and areas that got sunshine were pretty.  The good thing about this place is that it's in the city so I can go anytime due to the short drive.  \n\nYou'll bump into a number of people and dogs but that shouldn't deter you from checking this place out.

It's about a 1.5 mile hike going from the Seacliff neighborhood to Sutro Baths and the Cliff House. \n\nThe real treasure of this area is being able to explore off the trail. The single best view in the city is Deadman's Point, which is up a very small hill just on the Seacliff side of the large staircase portion of the trail (the entrance to Deadman's Point is marked by a \"stay on trail\" sign - ignore it you won't be disappointed). \n\nThere are hundreds of small trails that lead up and down the cliffs all throughout the park. An hour or two of wandering can lead you to secluded beaches, an abandoned, sidewise shell of a house, and amazing clearings in the forest.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-09-17", "description": "I recently did a ride to Land's End, a perfectly fitting name for a perfect ride. Land's End is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation area, filled with hiking trails, windswept vistas, the Sutro Baths, the Cliffhouse, and more spectacular views of The Golden Gate Bridge. Two recommendations; 1) there is so much to see and experience, so make sure to allot yourself plenty of time. 2) Remember this is San Francisco and you are on the ocean. Make sure to carry a light windbreaker, scarf and hat. The wind will get fierce, and you will get cold.\n\nI rode my bike from 19th/California towards 48th Avenue, ending at Seal Rock and El Camino del Mar Drives. You can take the bus--(#38L) or, if you choose to drive, there is tons of parking available.\n\nI checked out the Sutro Baths first, or ruins, I should say. In 1896, the Sutro Baths were opened to the public as the world's largest indoor swimming pool. Visitors had a choice of seven different swimming pools that were ostentatious in appearance and style; with private dressing rooms, toboggan slides and the ability to accommodate 25,000 people!  The baths were so expensive to operate that they were closed in 1965, and then the building itself was burnt to the ground in 1966.\n\nOverlooking the baths is The Cliffhouse Restaurant, which in and of itself is a San Francisco landmark. It began in 1858 and has had an amazing history. Today it is an exquisite Zagat rated and Michelin recommended establishment, with a great Sunday Brunch, walking tours and consistently touted as \"San Francisco's Best Restaurant with a View\", by travel journals and reviewers.\n\nThe Coastal Trail is clearly marked; bikes/no bikes. It is a beautiful, woodsy trail; light to moderate in difficulty. Since you can't take your bike all the way to the bridge from here, you can opt to ride through the 'bike only' sections of the trail, or lock it up in the parking lot and walk. If you choose to do the latter, the trail is about 3 miles long and fairly easy to meander. There are two staircases on the trail itself, but lots of trees, shaded areas and scenic views to enjoy along the way. I chose to chain my bike and stroll/hike along the trail. There are oodles of photo ops, paths leading down to the ocean, paths leading up into the trees. Whatever is your pleasure, it is here.\n\nUnlike Golden Gate Park, this place is not overrun by tourists--(yet). Perhaps that's because it feels far removed or that you are going to the boondocks. Either way, it is an added pleasure for those who do venture this far out.\n\nFor pictures, history and more fun facts, visit my site at: http://thenoisebeneaththeapple.com/", "author": "Heather J."}

Instead, we got in a great workout in a beautiful setting.

Even on a foggy day it is still nice to be out here. \n\nI remember the first time that Marie came to visit me at work and this was before we started going out. I told her there was a beautiful trail nearby my work and that we should go for a walk. It started off as a pleasant walk as the weather was gorgeous. We talked, walked and enjoyed the sun. Anyone that has walked this trail knows that there is a hill that leads to the golf course and then eventually the legion of honor. That hill holds special memories for Marie and me.

The reason why I say, \"maybe,\" is because there are a lot of people who walk this narrow trail and depending on what kind of runner you are, you may (or may not) become annoyed of all the traffic as you are trying to wiz on by.\n\nIt is an easy 3 mile-ish walk from the parking lot and back with no really dramatic inclines (except for the set of stairs in the middle... which I did stop to take a break because I am a lazy son of a gun). For the most part, it's pretty flat and I find it impossible to get lost.\n\nI highly suggest stopping at every lookout point if it is your first time because you will be blown away by the spectacular views. All-in-all, if you detour to all the lookout points, it'll add another half a mile-ish to your walk. No big deal, even for a lazy bum like me.\n\nIf you're looking for a challenge, go elsewhere.

If you start the other way, parking might be in issue in the weekend because Cliff House is choke full of tourists. The walk is about 3 miles long roundtrip. We took the paved Coastal Trail and brought our dog with us since it is a dog-friendly place. The first part of the walk is harder with a little climb up and down. However, after that initial part, the rest is easy as pie. Along the way, there are two look-out points to Golden Gate Bridge where you can sit down and enjoy the fresh air. As you walk the trail, you will hear foghorns continously. It's rather soothing and somehow weirdly reminds me of the book, Treasure Island (ships and pirates). There was a part of the trail that has eucalyptus trees and it just smelled so wonderful.\n\nIf you are bringing a dog, dogs are recommended to be leashed because some dogs have fallen off the cliff. I saw unleashed dogs walking there, though. They were the best behaved dogs - just walking with their owners, minding their own business. I leashed my dog because he is not the most obedient dog. However, it was funny that he would root himself to the earth whenever he was 2-ft away from a cliff, refusing to go any nearer. I was not trying to get him to the edge, but just trying to move and give way to people walking faster than us.

The three of us parked at the Legion of Honor and decided to head to the Lands End Trail.  We wandered down the hillside on a small trail, slipping on the leaves, crossing a mini gully on a log, and wondering if anyone was at the nude beach.  We reached the main trail and headed towards the bridge.\n\nWe had absolutely beautiful views of the Marin Headlands, the cliffs, and of course the GGB. \n\nWandering back the car my daughter needed to use a restroom.

We were slow and veered off a couple times.  There was even a guy who wanted us to take a survey about the park but that only took 8 minutes, just like he said it would.

It's a great place to take out of town guests, as the trail is not that difficult.  You can also get there with the 38 bus as well.  Weekdays are much better than weekends, but it's not too bad on the weekends.  As far as I know, it's the only ocean\n walk, on the cliff, in the forest in the city.

Then lately, I've been on this kick to go out on weekends, get some fresh air, and maybe go to some areas of town I hadn't been yet to do some urban \"hiking\".  After a failed attempt a couple of weeks ago (where the foul cold weather encouraged us to go to a bar instead), I thought this weekend would be perfect.\n\nAnd it was.\n\nThe trail starts at Point Lobos Ave and El Camino Del Mar at one end (if you follow the road past the Cllff House and on up the hill to the first intersection, that's it) then follows the coast through Lincoln Park, past the Legion of Honor, and comes out at end of the Park at El Camino del Mar and 23rd Ave.\n\nIf you start at Point Lobos end, it's flat, paved and wide (wheel friendly: wheelchairs, strollers, or bikes) with a great lookout point where you can see the GG Bridge.  As you progress the paved path gives way to a still very easy dirt path (however, not so good for wheels unless you are on a bike), down a couple of steps, then you're behind the Legion of Honor.  There's a side route down to a beach.  Lots of steps but well worth it for the view.  If you continue along the main path there are many more steps.  Or if you want, you can cut up to the Legion of Honor  (recommended for cyclists).\n\nPretty crowded on nice weekends so probably not the best trail for runners or cyclists.", "author": "Jean K."}

Whether to work out, get some air, hangout with a friend, or just wander and think.  The scenery is beautiful and if you happen to visit on a beautiful day, you can see across the bay, the Golden Gate Bridge, and more.  This trail is also located nearby Ocean Beach and Golden Gate Park.  \n\nIt's usually cold so it would be wise to bring a jacket or sweatshirt.  On warmer days, this place is packed.  You'll find people jogging, biking, walking their dogs, or tourists taking in the breathtaking views of coastal SF.  There are other trails off the main path, either up the hill farther into the trees or down to the rocky beaches.  \n\nIf you follow the residential streets all the way down past the end of the trail you can actually walk to China Beach and Baker Beach.  It takes a couple hours to walk from the Land's End Trail parking lot to Baker Beach, but if you have the time I highly suggest packing a snack, water, a camera, a friend and enjoying the walk.  \n\nIn terms of safety, there are some roped areas to ensure no one falls off the cliff, so if you're scared of heights, some spots might intimidate you.  There are signs to be aware of coyotes, but I haven't run into any (fingers crossed!)  I wouldn't suggest walking here in the dark, and it would be wise to stay aware of your surroundings if walking alone since the main path can get narrow and there are a lot of trees and bushes.  \n\nOverall, a beautiful SF spot that locals and tourists alike enjoy.

It's safe. \n\nInstead of going down to the beachy area, my sister and I decided to walk the other way. I'm glad we did because after you go down the kinda long set of stairs than up and glance over the edge. TAAAA DAAAA! you found it. It comes out of nowhere, well at least for me and is GORGEOUS. \n\nMy sis and I took pics of the circle of rocks, which we kept referring to it as the \"sign\".

The image that came to mind as I wrote that description was Land's End. \n\nI remember coming here many years ago with someone I was dating at the time and working out our relationship troubles. There was something about being among the trees and foliage while watching the waves hit the rocks and the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance that helped us calm down, concentrate, and not attempt to yell at each other. We talked and walked along the trail which not only helped us let out steam physically and emotionally, but it helped ground us at the same time. We would realize that our problems were so miniscule, that the world offered so much, and how we took a lot for granted. \n\nAlthough that relationship has been over years ago, and I would hide my face if I ran into him anywhere today, the lesson from my experience was how valuable this place really is.

The walk is suitable for all ages and for dogs as well.  \n\nYou're far enough away from the traffic to really feel like you're in another place and yet you're close enough to the city that you're not going to run into a snake or mountain lion.\n\nNot only is Land's End Trail gorgeous, it has history as well; you may be able to spot shipwrecks off the coast and the memorial as well as the remains of the bullet ridden USS San Francisco WWII cruiser can be found in the Vista Point parking lot off 48th Avenue.  \n\nI usually start at Vista Point and jog over to Mile Rock Beach where I climb up and down the stairs a couple of times and jog up to the cliff area where the labrinyth is.   Then I continue on, up the other flight of stairs, down the winding path and eventually to the end of the trail by Eagle's Point.  If you wanted to keep going, you could jog up to the Legion of Honor (turn right) or jog down to China Beach (turn left).\n\nThe trail is about 3 miles round trip.  The parking lot on Merrie Way was recently finished, providing even more free parking.", "author": "Lolia S."}

How much MORE did quiet moments of enjoying the earth, wind and sky come his way each day?  The answer . . . they came his way MORE than mine. Paublo wasn't foolish at all, and he remains one of my best friends to this day. \n\nThis day, I'm glad I don't have to drive to Yosemite or the Grand Canyon to take in a million dollar view.

In this case, I'd heard of Land's End (no, not the catalog/clothing company), but hadn't really heard stories of people having gone there.\n\nIn a weekend quest to combat the unhealthy weekend food and copious amounts of wine and liquor, Tara decided we should go for a walk this morning, and chose Land's End as our destination. Despite the chilly December morning air, it couldn't have been a better idea.\n\nI also love further getting to know San Francisco geography, and Land's End is a peculiar part of the puzzle. I knew that the northwest corner of the city was perhaps the most interesting, geographically. I knew that between Sutro Baths and Baker Beach the coastline became, well, complex. But being at Land's End gives you a good understanding of exactly how complex it becomes.\n\nThere are high, steep cliffs rising right out of the water, and negotiating sharp curves and crags. It was lush as hell today, December 7, so I'm gonna go ahead and assume that it's always like this. In addition, there are multiple revegetation efforts all over the park. It's refreshing to see them reintroducing native plants in such a beautiful area.\n\nThe trail, or as much of it as we walked, takes you along side the coast, and high about it. There are alternating areas of openness and canopied overhangs. There are, of course, INCREDIBLE ocean and bay views, including great angles on the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nLand's End is a great way to get to know an amazing bit of nature left in this otherwise most-urban of cities.

I was determined to find something that would at least match that, and I think this places fits in perfectly with the plan!  I hope that when she comes, it will offer a sunnier more pleasant view, but even in overcast weather and wind, it's still amazing here!  \n\nIt takes no work at all to be close to the coast, and though there were some stairways that tired us out, that was only the case because both the husband and I are so out of shape.  \n\nThis hike was reminiscent of a hike in Hawaii.  It had some of the elements that I can recall, such as forest and trees, the coast, some archways, even what I joked to be black sand, though really it wasn't.  Hahaha.   When we hiked down to the bathhouse, we even walked through a tunnel cave that reminded us of walking through lava tubes.  And, we can't forget about the long stairs down to the beach. =P    \n\nI was pretty excited when we saw starfish attached to the rocks at the beach, but I was 10000x more excited when I saw a pack of dolphins (from very afar).  \n\nI thought getting ourselves to the Golden Gate Bridge would be no problem at all, but not even halfway there and I was already tired out!!  There went my ambition...saved for another day!  I remember taking a mental note about how this place allows us to see the bridge from a different side.  \n\nSo, we walked up to China Beach and trekked back on the street.  There, we were able to stop by the House of Legion, though we didn't go inside.  The outside courtyard is nice for pictures though.  \n\nThe bathhouse area is kinda gross and smelly, and I had to walk through a very narrow ledge that had my heartbeat skipping right before I made the leap!

I used to go running or walking on the trail when I lived in several different places in the Richmond district. It's been years since I went back on the trail and WHOAH! It is even more beautiful now! Who'd have thought they could improve such an awesome trail. They put some kind of pavement down at the beginning of the trail - nice to see after twisting my ankle too many times in the last few years so rocky ground makes me a little nervous now. Even though the pavement only goes from the beginning of the trail (cliff house end) and lasts for about 5 minutes of the walk, it really is impressive, as is a few other spots they re-built or improved. In general, they just cleaned it up a bit and made it more \"walker friendly\" and safer / less prone to landsliding.  They also trimmed a few trees but it still looks awesome. \n\nI'm not sure what the regulations are for dogs (meaning, whether or not they're supposed to be on leashes). I must confess, when I recently went here with my friend Angela, we brought a pooch she was dog-sitting and let him go off-leash for a while, but that was just because he's extremely friendly. Needless to say, he looooooved it.\n\nThis is a great place to bring a date (provided you know the guy... if he's a little questionable, stick with crowded public areas!).

The second time I took my family which I thought was a great choice for a not-too-touristy thing to do with my parents! The hike was great for them because it is quite easy, minus some stairs. \n\nWhen you go here on a day when the whether is perfect, it seriously makes the hike! The hike follows a beautiful, rocky shoreline and clear views of the Golden Gate Bridge with all of the sailboats sailing under it is definitely something to stop and take in. \n\nThe trail is also super easy to get to. Taking Bus 38 (costs only $1.50 for a day ticket) somewhere along Geary heading west will take you all the way down to Geary and 38th street where you can hop out and walk a couple of blocks to the Sutro Baths and start the hike. Or, there is an abundance of parking spaces near the entrance of the trail. Just drive down Geary until it hits Point Lobos. \n\nI gave the trail 4 stars because it is always pretty crowded, but not so much so that it takes away too much from the experience. I guess this isn't that great kept of a secret after all :).\n\nAnd, if I lived closer to San Francisco, I would definitely take my dog here. Almost everyone had their doggies on leashes and they looked happy to be on the trail as well.", "author": "Eileen E."}

I was starting to think this Labyrinth didn't exist.  I always looked out towards the ocean and Mile Rock Beach and never thought to look straight down. Lo and behold, there goes the Labyrinth!  The views along this trail are amazing and you get a clear shot of the Golden Gate Bridge.  A great walk or hike for anyone.", "author": "Cindy G."}

We were too sure where we were going but saw wonderful views of the bridge. Eventually we ended up on one end which was the sutro baths. So we figured to try the other side because we really wanted to see the labyrinth. From one side to another barely takes 20 minutes. It was a super easy hike, yes there was stairs, but all the better for your butt! Getting to the top to get an aerial view of the labyrinth was probably the trickiest part, the same goes for getting down. So if you are with children or the elderly please be careful. to the right side of the labyrinth is the perfect spot for a photo in front of the bridge, take advantage of this perfect photo opportunity! We decided to take a shortcut back but ended up on the golf course, so I advise you to stay on the trail!

There are plenty of places to spot the Golden Gate Bridge and scenic ocean views. The trail is pretty easy. Lands End Trail is smooth with a fair amount of stairs at certain points. The only part that might be troublesome for less physically able people and young children would be the route down to the rocky beach area. This area provides the best view of the Golden Gate Bridge and beach rocks. Currently some of the stairs are blocked off by yellow tape. Just follow the detour sign to a narrow side trail. Be cautious because there are no stairs or guide rails. You could just bypass this area to continue on the trail. Altogether it's about an hour hike if you just hike briskly straight through. But if it's your first time you'll most likely spend a couple of hours to take in the wonderful views (especially if you take the detour).\n\nNote: This trail is not a loop. I ended on the other side and had to hike up near the golf courses. This is a bit steep so I recommend retracing the trail to get back to the parking lot.", "author": "Michael H."}

It was about 3.5 years ago and my sweet dog was still pretty spunky back then and loved to come on long walks with us. We took him to Land's End and he was such a trooper!  He kept up with us on one of the steep trails down to the water. Once we made it to the beach, he took off like a little bunny and started to run in circles right at the water's edge until he couldn't run anymore!  We laughed so hard, I think I was crying!  Now my little buddy is too old for those activities, but the memory will stay with me forever.\n\nThis is one of my favorite places in the city (and the state, oh hell...the whole country, okay!). It's so beautiful. The views of the ocean, bay, Marin Headlands, and GG bridge will blow you away. It's a great place to come when you're feeling overwhelmed by the chaos of the city. It reminds me that we live in one of the most beautiful, scenic parts of the country. \n\nEverybody will love it here. You don't have to be a super-athlete or hiker (I'm not!).

The vistas, the fragrant diversity of the flora and fauna, the sound of the ocean rhythmically crashing into the cliffs and of wind rustling the trees, the soaring of hawks, pelicans, crows, and today an eagle - sublime. \nBUT the trail is populated by too many selfish, arrogant idiots who lack consideration for anything outside of themselves. For example, the moron riding his bike along the part of the trail that is populated by 'no biking' signs; I told him and he said he knows, but he wants to ride there anyway. The people whose dogs run wild into the sensitive habitat, some of it endangered, digging and pooping wherever the dogs wish, and whose owners retaliate with 'it's none of your f-ing business' when I politely point out that dogs must remain on the trail. I love dogs, but not their inconsiderate owners. The people smoking, when the air is so fresh and fragrant with wilderness. Why must people overstep their bounds? Why not just absorb and settle into nature, to allow it to transform each of us? And yes, as another reviewer commented, though I don't think tourists are solely guilty of this, the people who won't yield or walk on the proper side of the trail, taking up as much space as their egos demand.\nHence I give Lands End four stars, and lament that people aren't more sensitive to the world around them, for this place is to celebrated, not trampled upon.", "author": "Eliza S."}

It provides a great workout with the many level changes by way of stairs, dirt hills and flat areas, and if you hustle it could take about 20-30 minutes to do the entire thing and end up over by the Cliff House (which is a great stop for a bathroom break!)  On the way you find yourself with many options to diverge off the road and go explore the Lincoln Park golf course or Mile Rock beach, or even the Veteran's Hospital if that sort of thing compels you.  You can make this walk leisurely or intense just by slowing down or speeding up your pace, so this trail really caters to whatever your needs of the day are. \n\nIt gets pretty crowded on beautiful days and on the weekends.

The views of GG are wonderful, and if you're lucky enough to come on a sunny day then the views are heaven on earth. The trail certainly isn't as narrow as some people have described on here. And for the person that complained that this place is a tourist trap and too exposed, need I remind you this is public land for ALL to enjoy. You can't own San Francisco and just because you think something is enjoyable, doesn't mean you deserve it all to yourself. Everyone should be able to enjoy a beautiful place like this. If it wasn't for the park service maintaining it or buying it, it'd remain run down like it was in the 80s and people were getting murdered out there! Plus who'd want a private developer to get their hands on it and put up a hotel( or mansions?), then you'd really be complaining about tourists! That's like a 98 year old saying they hate all the people that have moved here over the last 50 years, and you're one of them! I mean what do you think the people that walked there before you think about all that came after?\n    So go enjoy people!

Quickly realized it is one of San Francisco's best kept secrets! It must be somewhat of a secret, because even on beautiful summer weekend days, there is plenty of free parking still available...how amazing is that? Anyway, I have come back again and again. It's also a great place to bring folks who are visiting SF.\n\nThe first time I walked this trail, it took my breath away with the gorgeous views of the bay and the Golden Gate bridge. You get to those views pretty much immediately! It's a fairly easy walk, although if you go far enough you get to a moderately long set of stairs. Also, there is a side trail down to Mile Beach that also involves a decent number of stairs (totally worth it...check out the starfish and mussels on the rocks at the beach). At the far end of the trail I always turn it into a loop by going up to the road (El Camino del Mar?) and walk back past the golf course and the Palace of the Legion of Honor. Then I go to the far end of the Legion of Honor parking lot to pick up the trail again. The first time I did this walk, there was a huge Chihuly sculpture \"Sun\" just outside of the Legion of Honor - it was just another unexpected burst of pleasure that day. As was the \"little fennel forrest\", which I call the area where there is a ton of wild fennel, much of it 8 feet tall. After I finish the loop towards the GG bridge, I may do a small loop in the other direction, towards the Sutro Baths and the Cliff House. This is fun especially if I'm bringing out-of-town visitors. At the end of this ~2-3 hour walk, the Cliff House is a convenient place with restrooms (yay!) and to consider for a meal (although I've only ended up actually eating here once).", "author": "yolanda y."}

This part of the trail is the closest to my dwelling place. I am oh so lucky to have this trail near by...and let me tell you why...\n\nIt's a beautiful day and I'm running along this trail while being capitivated by the amazing views. Am I really in San Francisco? Oh yeah I am! There's the Golden Gate Bridge. How beautiful it looks peaking out through the cypress trees! I'm running along and I'm so happy because my sneakered feet are not pounding into concrete but on this shady dirt trail. I look over and see the ocean. I start planning my next bike ride as I catch a glimpse of the Marin Headlands. Off to the side of the main trail are trails that lead down to the beach. You can actually trek down there and run along the beach if you are feeling it. But, I decide to stay on the main trail. I round a corner and a picture perfect view of the vast Pacific Ocean spreads out before me. If I'm lucky, I can catch a glimpse of dolphins or even a gray whale. But, it appears I won't glimpse any sea creatures today. I jog up the hardest part of the trail which are steep steps that go straight up and then leads you back down onto a wider trail. \n\nThe end of the trail spits you out on Point Lobos near the old Sutro Baths and the Cliff House. You can call someone to pick you up or you can turn around and head back to 32nd and El Camino Del Mar, where you began. If you decide to turn around; then you just hiked, ran, or walked a 3 mile round trip.\n\nI'm running along this trail with my Ipod and I'm completely carried away by the views and my music. \n\n\"breathe in breathe out \nbreathe in breathe out \nbreathe in \n\ndeaf dumb and thirty \nstarting to deserve this \nleaning on my conscience wall \nblood is like wine \nunconscious all the time \nif i had it all again \ni'd change it all\"\n\nI love this trail! Oh no, oh no! I watch my Ipod fly through the air as I fall towards the ground. Ahem, watch out for the rocks or crevices on the path...they just LIKE come out of no where!\n\nOVERALL: Secret trails abound off this wonderful trail.

The rocky ocean, the green cliff side, and a perfect view of the Golden Gate Bridge. When I began the hike I had no idea I would be seeing the Golden Gate Bridge, so it was a great surprise when I turned that corner and got the best view in the whole city of the beautiful bridge and all the passing ships and sailboats. At the end of the mile I sat along the edge of the cliff (safely!) and ate a packed lunch and enjoyed the clear skies and warm air. There were plenty of people along the path, but with the perfect weather and amazing views I would have expected more.

It is a really easy hike about 3.4 miles round trip. You can easily walk or run this trail. The point I recommend to start is at Point Lomos near 48th. There are two FREE parking lots right before you wind down to reach The Cliff House. The trail starts at the parking lot. You can take the steps down to the Sutra bath. The view is awesome and you will find a lil cave that is cozy and romantic. The trail is very easy to follow. You can also find a map at www.everytrail.com. You will see beautiful views of the vast ocean, Marin county and the Golden Gate bridge! There is a spot for Mile point beach and there are stairs that take you down. Once you go down and to the right, you go up a lil hill to get to the labyrinth! Hold your breath. It is not a huge maze but a lil one drawn up on the ground. Here you will find yourself closer to GG bridge. Once you are done, u have to remember to go back the way you came, back to those stairs as that's the only way to get back on the trail! There are lots of warnings about people falling off cliffs but you will be fine as long as u stay safe and away from the edges. Overall, the hike was great and on a sunnier day, it would be 5 stars.

I had never been on this side of the bay before and felt like I had found a treasure, it was so beautiful, peaceful, and not packed with tourists. It was more local residents walking their dogs and people jogging. The view of the golden gate and the bay and ocean were beautiful. If you walk to the left after you go down the stairs, you wind downhill for .2 miles and then you can see the Sutro Baths and the Cliff House on your left. It was a great little walk we did and I'm glad we found it.", "author": "Vivian L."}

One of my favorite places on Earth is the Marin Headlands, and this trail/park gave a completely different perspective of the Bay. It was beautiful and almost magical as we made our way all over the cliffs down and up and all around. Be sure to take a less beaten path and make your way all the way down to the water. And check out the rock maze. You can find shade and resting spots throughout. It can be quite the trek so be prepared with water. Great place to bring a picnic, watch the sunset, or just soul search. I highly recommend this place to everyone and anyone who wants some outdoor goodness.", "author": "Jessica F."}

Those of us who live in the Richmond District of SF are always so thankful for the surrounding trails that encourage us to exercise.  I am one-of-those that does not have an ipod attached to their head, but instead chose to listen to the waves pounding, glimpse at the stillness of the water, the sun setting, the newly planted vegetation.  Except for the occasional \"idiot\" trying to bike the trail, it is a most pleasant way to end the day.  The trail itself is a 1.5 miles ( one way), but you can extend that many times over by hitting one of the side trails with stairs going down to the beach or the 125 stairs on the main trail.   What more can we ask for - a golf course on one side, \"the trail\" and the sound of the ocean on the other.", "author": "Kea C."}

The 1 bus drops you off close to a little cafe so you can either end the hike in outer Richmond, or start there (my choice) then end up walking into the Marina. It's wonderful. Also a great running trail. On weekends there can be some real characters out here.", "author": "jen n."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-22", "description": "O! Land's End -- the cross country practice from hell (right below strawberry hill in the Park). However, the views compensated for the otherwise painful feelings of having a coach yelling at you to run up those never-ending stairs faster. It is a very good trail to run on though, and brings you from the Cliff House to the Sea Cliff / Lincoln Golf Course area. \n\nI returned long cross country season to walk my dog and got a whole new feeling. The trail walks (or runs) you through infinite panoramic views of the bay, the bridge, the beaches, and more. On a nice day, it's a great idea. It's amazing to realize that the hustle and bustle of downtown is simply minutes away. \n\n4 Stars. I would definitely return.", "author": "Danny D."}

The man drove out to the city EARLY this morning so we were out at about 7:30AM.  There was hardly anyone on the trail, but it was foggy, cold, and misty.  I think if we had chosen to go on a clearer day, we could've appreciated the view more.  But even considering the weather, it's a really nice place to go to feel like you're away from the city when you're not.  Plus, it's pretty close to my house.", "author": "Kris L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-25", "description": "Seriously one of the best trails in San Francisco and the Bay Area for that matter.  Starting in Sea Cliff, you really get more than you can imagine on this trail.  Gorgeous views, varied terrain, vegetation of all sorts, and pretty incredible weather.  This is a great trail to take your friends to for a scenic tour, romantic for a brisk walk with your sweetie, and fantastic for a great work out.  The round trip is about 3 miles I believe, especially if you cross over to Sutro Park and check out Ocean Beach and the surfers.  There are definitely some more technical areas for footing and 2 sections with stairs, one is pretty extreme but nothing like Lyon Street.  The good news though is that if you're not trying to burn a few hundred calories, they're wide enough that you can go at your leisure enabling you to stop and enjoy the view.  The maintenance of this trail is stellar which is awesome considering it could be very muddy, rocky and overgrown.  And, to make it even better, they are constantly improving the trail by adding low retaining walls, walkways, overlooks to see the Golden Gate and even little portions of historical information.  When it's super hot, the tree cover keeps it cool, when it's foggy and chilly, the brisk walk warms up your blood, and even when it is drizzly, the trees give you momentary breaks.  At any time, it feels magical on this trail since it is so beautiful!  I truly love this trail and feel so lucky to have it in my city!!  Go out and enjoy it for yourself!", "author": "Cinds C."}

I walked from one end of the Ocean beach towards the Cliff House.  I ended up in Land's End Trail.  It was a breezy day, but the view is spectacular so I wasn't complaining.  Got to see a lot of surfers on the beach, and once we hike up the trail, There was even better view of the Pacific Ocean.  We walked thru this amazing golf course, and passed thru the Legion of Honor.  We continiued to walk towards the trail, somehow ended up in Seacliff, walked thru this amazing place with all the beautiful expensive houses.  It was so gorgeous looking down, and proceeded to walk towards the Presidio.  I don't know how much walk we did, but we ended up walking up to Golden Gate Bridge.  The view was really magnicent, by that time..,it has been way past noon, and the sun coming thru.  Looking out into the ocean, I saw Alcatraz, and all the seaboats.  Many many tourist in this area, with bikers, and people with Gocars.  It's so pretty up there looking down, makes you don't want to leave and just glaze thru the night, just remember to bring a jacket with you.", "author": "Jenny W."}
