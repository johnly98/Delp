Normally I go for the burger, animal style (meaning pickles, grilled onions, and spread, the in n out sauce, kinda like thousand island but better) with fries (animal fries always take FOREVER to get b/c they only have like 2 of the cheese melter machines, so I wouldn't recommend it at this location), and a lemonade (if it's your first time and you like lemonade PLEASE do yourself a favor and try the bright pink lemonade, it's freshly made daily, and and in n out classic). \n\nHowever, for those of you who are from around here and are able to, just go to Daly City for your craving, it's a lot less crazy, even if the drive though line gets a little long. \n\nNote: bathrooms are not inside the store, you'll have to ask one of the servers for a code to go to the bathroom inside the complex. \n\nOverall, grab a burger, why not?

I wasn't trying to let this late afternoon line that's out the door on a Monday deter me. Once I'm actually inside, it is best described as organized chaos. The process of ordering was simple, it was the waiting inside and dealing with the crowd was the tough part. It was a 20-30 minute wait to get my order. Don't even think about grabbing a seat inside. It's laughable. Go outside and sit in the outdoor area.\n\nThe actual burger, which was a double-double animal style, itself was alright. Pretty, but alright. I do think it's overrated and at first bite, I honestly thought it tasted more like McDonald's. I'd eat it again, but the fries. Oh no. They were just not good. So thin and so puny. They get cold very quickly and they weren't that great. Not sure if getting them animal style would save them. Overall, I'd try it again, but not at this location.

I am pleased to say that it is better this time around! I tried it in LA almost two years ago and boy, I was so disappointed. The crowd is pretty crazy here and seating is a challenge. If you're coming with someone, have someone scout for seats (additional seats can be found outside in the back area in front of Krispy Kreme) and have one person to line up. The food does come out fast though! \n\nWe each got the Double-Double Burgers and Animal Style Fries. Patties were good as they were tender and perfectly cooked. Buns were a bit crispy so it added a nice crunch. Animal Style Fries were alright. I was never a fan of the animal style sauce so I can do without it. \n\nMy partner-in-crime really enjoyed his first In-N-Out Burger experience. It is economical and it gets the job done when hunger strikes. At heart, Shake Shack is still better in taste and quality to me even at a higher price point. I strongly still believe that the two are not comparable as they are very different in their own way - chef driven vs. economical.", "author": "Cynthia D."}

After finally returning to the west coast, I knew that I had to pay my respects to in-n-out. Even though the line was out the door, it moves very quickly as the workers are efficient in cycling the crowd through. \n\nFOOD: My friend ordered a double-double, I ordered a regular cheeseburger with grilled onions, and we shared a vanilla shake and animal fries. It cost less than $20, which I call a steal, not just a deal for all that food. I honestly could've eaten another burger, but was too lazy to get in line. Regardless, the food was delicious and definitely worth it for the price. Grilled onions are almost a must!! \n\nSERVICE: great. A couple workers rotate around the restaurant and ask if there's anything they can get for you -- more napkins, water, etc. The service really is above and beyond for being a simple fast food joint. \n\nIf you're craving a good burger and are not looking to break the bank, in-n-out is the only way to go!", "author": "Grace L."}

I got animal fries and an animal burger, and highly recommend it. They both came with onions, cheese, and thousand island sauce, and were delicious. I will say that if I ever visit the west coast again, I would definitely just get normal fries, as the animal style for both fries and burgers is a bit much for one meal. \n\n-1 star for the insane environment inside this store.

Kidding aside, well not really, I've been to a few in the past years, but never to this one (& only?) in San Francisco. So playing tourist today I found myself at Fisherman's Wharf and past that hanger-y stage. So of course Clam Chowder, Fish n Chips immediately came to my mind, but Wham I notice the In-N-Out at the corner of Anchorage Square! Oh yes! Why not!\n\nAs I enter I notice one line nearly out the door, but three cashiers ringing up as quickly as humanly possible! Having been to In-N-Out (usually the one in Daly City) I knew I wanted the #1 combo which is a double double burger, fries, and a fountain drink. Another thing I noticed was the combo I wanted was $9 vs. about a dollar less in the suburbs. Who's counting pennies when we're starving, eh? \n\nSo I place my order and surprisingly found a seat in the corner. I mean I can do more than just eat in this little corner, *hint hint* but we'll keep this G-rated;) I also noticed as insanely busy as it was the system they have here is highly efficient, hence why the employees here start at $16.00 per hour, I guess. It's called the balance of living in overpriced San Francisco, but I'm happy for these employees! \n\nAfter about 10-minutes of people watching my order is finally ready! Boom! Freshly made and ready to be devoured by this big boy. I always start with a hand full of fries, then a few bites of the burger. Oh baby! Exactly like I remember about In-N-Out! It's fresh, tasty, and relatively cheap in comparison to other burger joints - I'm talking real meat burgers, kiddos. A final gulp of my lemonade and my lunch is complete with a smile on my face! \n\nAll in all, I recommend In-N-Out to anyone into old school burgers. They do it right here! Maybe you won't get the efficiency like I received ($16 per hour at a fast food joint), but it's all about taste and cost. That's a winning formula In-N-Out has down like a poodle on a cardigan!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-09", "description": "Everyone told me I had to try this California gem and I did within a few days of moving here. \n\nSo first of all, in my opinion, the best way to get your burger is to get it animal style. Actually, the best way to get anything on the menu is probably animal style. If I was a soda drinker I'd probably get that animal style too.\n\nI'm gonna talk about what I don't like first, however; I just want to make it clear that In-N-Out, while good, is not the holy grail of burger places.\n\nSo the fries... they're just not good. They're not horrible, but they're not good. I like my fries to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and In-N-Out fries sorta do both in a mediocre way. Now, I'm aware you can get them well done, but trust me, I've had them regular, well done, and animal style, but they're still just meh.\n\nNext, I'm not sure if this is just pertinent to this one chain or not, but there's so much YELLING. The staff call out order numbers, but... there's a microphone. It's a little jarring when I'm deep into enjoying my burger and then I hear an order number being called in the same way my parents used to yell at me.\n\nThere is also a wait. Understandable because this location is at the Wharf, so every tourist combined with SF locals will be here. I don't think I've ever seen an hour where there was no lineup. It doesn't take long to get your order in, but waiting for your food takes a while.\n\nAll of these shortcomings I can forgive, however, because as soon as I take my first bite into a double double animal style burger, I forget. I forget that I had to wait 30 minutes, I forget that the fries are bad, and I forget that the yelling gives me flashbacks to when I got yelled at for not getting straight-A's. The juiciness of the fresh ground beef smashed patties, the mustard fried buns, the animal sauce... everything on that burger comes together and embraces me, letting me know that flaws are what make someone beautiful. I feel no shame in sometimes not eating for a whole day and then eating 3 double doubles in one sitting.\n\nMaybe this is why I keep going back. It's almost like having an argument with someone you love dearly - once you fight through all the stupid, unimportant stuff, that's when you realize all the reasons you fell for them in the first place.", "author": "Calvin Z."}

I enjoy the burgers here, always get onions! \n\nI personally think in-n-out fries have never been great, no matter what style. They're a bit too thin and hard for me.

On our last day in SF my friend and I found ourselves in Fisherman's Wharf around 1 PM and I knew what I had to do.\n\nThis location is smack dab in the middle of the most touristy neighborhood of SF (think Times Square in NYC, but Californian edition). I instantly walked in to a mass of people crowded around the ordering counter. This location seemed large but the sheer number of people inside just made it feel tiny. However, I was lucky. Twenty minutes later the line had extended outside and around the block. If I had arrived just a short time later it definitely would've been more than an hour wait.\n\nWhen it was finally my turn to order I stuck with the single patty cheeseburger, medium fries and drink combo #2 ($8.52). Overall in my opinion it was a pretty decent burger. You could tell that fresh ingredients had been used and nothing seemed too bland or flavorless in terms of the taste. In my opinion though Shake Shack seems better...\n\nThe service here was great for what they were dealing with. Easily more than 20 people behind the counter flipping burgers, shuffling fries, and calling out order numbers in almost unbelievable synchronization. The staff here undoubtedly deserves an A+ for their efficiently. \n\nIf you're in SF and have never tried In-N-Out I'd say make the trip (if you have free time) just to cross it off your list. If you know you'll be back in California sometime soon, then maybe go to a location that won't possibly have you waiting over an hour for a $5 burger.", "author": "Nicholas C."}

Good thing the line was moving fairly quick. The thing that really caught my eye is how cheap everything on the menu was. Not even in terms of San Francisco prices, but like in general. I couldn't believe that a hamburger was only $3. I can see why some of these orders had 5-6 burgers per tray!\n\nThe restaurant I wouldn't say is a small location, but there isn't enough seats considering how busy this location was. The bad thing is that the bathrooms are outside, but the staff is more than willing to give you the code. \n\nEnded up getting the Double-Double meal with a Vanilla shake and Animal Style fries. The burger was a double patty, but it is possible to get as more patties, but it is just extra. The staff was incredibly fast and the service was quick. The burger itself was juicy and very delicious. It was flavorful, but unfortunately it was really thin. Can't really say much about the shake, it was really thick, but was average at best. The fries were really thin, kind of like McDonald's fries but the sauce really made the difference! \n\nThe experience overall was incredibly pleasant and I'm glad to say I lost my In-N-Out virginity.

So that's what I did. \n\nThis was the Fisherman's Wharf location in San Francisco so I expected some hustle and bustle as far as traffic inside the restaurant but I got WAY more than that. Luckily we got there a little before the lunch rush so ordering quickly wasn't the issue. But - people were hovering over others & rushing them to finish their lunch, sitting with strangers who were almost done with their food, etc. etc. just to get a SEAT in this place. It was like the Hunger Games of popular food chains. My family and I, after a while, were able to find two separate tables for two, which was fine. But it was surprising (but also not surprising at the same time) that people were being this awkward just to sit themselves in a chair. We waited a while for the food but I understood, these workers were incredibly slammed.\n\nWhat I will say, is that without the high quality of the burger I had, this would probably be a 3 star review. While I didn't necessarily enjoy the overall \"experience\" of actually being in an In-N-Out Restaurant that was crawling with tourists, I didn't let that affect my opinion of the food. As a matter of fact, if I were a California citizen, I would be more than happy to consistently visit my much less busy In-N-Out through the drive through. The burger, in the long run, was worth it. I got the Double Double (for the full experience) and REALLY enjoyed it. Much more than I thought I would. The fries are shoestring and not the best I've ever had, but still very good, and the milkshake was yum.\n\nOverall, probably the last time I'll take myself to an In-N-Out in a highly populated area, but if I happen to pass one with less people and a drive thru, I will 100% stop by.", "author": "Aly D."}

We came at 9pm on a Friday night. \n\nIt was SLAMMED. It was insane. They have no bathroom so people were literally peeing outside on the building. It was repulsive. It was loud, full of tourists and locals alike. People were in there drunk and screaming like it was new year's eve. \n\nThe food took forever. It took 30 minutes just to find a seat for 2. \n\nThere was spilled food and drinks on the floor. \n\nFinally, we get the food. Oh, also, there's no variety here. You can get cheese, no cheese or one or two patties. I've never been here before so I guess most people are cool with that? \n\nAnd it's expensive for a cheap burger and fries, but that just might be California. \n\nThey have very thin, tasteless fries.

In-N-Out serves your typical American-styled fast food burgers and fries with sodas, shakes, and even hot chocolate with marshmallows to supplement. \n\nI typically order:\n1. Hamburger w/ Grilled Onions\nIt's simple but amazingly delectable. The edge of the bun is toasted. When you take your first bite into the burger, you'll taste that first crunch.   As you bite into the center, you'll taste a variety of scrumptious flavors like the well-balanced layers of cold iceberg lettuce topped with  refreshing slices of tomato, the well-seasoned, juicy beef patty, and grilled onions for extra flavor. A very simple burger made with so much taste!\n\n2. Well Done French Fries (w/ Grilled Onions & Spread on the side)\nThis is like the cheaper version of animal-style fries except without the cheese and more crunch with every bite. I personally like this one more because I'd rather have the spread cold and not splattered all over the fries. One tip - order \"WELL DONE\" fries for extra crisp!\n\nIn-N-Out is great because it also has a not-so-secret menu.\n\nSome Tips & Highlights..\n1. You can order your burger extra toasted, animal-styled (grilled onions and their famous spread), with double meat, layered (3x3 or 4x4), and even protein style (no bun). You can also order fries well-done or even with cheese or grilled onions. \n2. Ask for spread to dip with your fries or even add it to your burger!\n\nIn this particular location, the service is generally really fast. There may be a long wait for your order if it's during busy hours in the day (like lunch or dinner time). Keep in mind that it is by the pier, so it's definitely a very touristy spot and generally very busy. I typically go at night (after 8pm) for free metered parking around Beach St and less crowd.\n\nI love this place so much! It's the only fast food chain where I don't feel like I'm being clogged with oil after every meal. MUST GO!!", "author": "Michelle L."}

I suggest having your friend grab a table while you wait on the food as seating is limited. From the customer service, food and the maintenance team the overall experience was enjoyable. We ordered the cheese burgers and fries with the strawberry milkshake.We ate it all! The food was delicious and if you wanted extra ketchup someone from the staff actually offers you while your eating. Can't get any better than that!", "author": "Jadea R."}

I came here numerous times in the past, but this is the first time I'm writing a review for this place. Almost every single time I come here, there's always a line and it's pretty crowded inside. If there are no places to sit inside, then venture outside to one of the tables near the back of the store. \n\nThis time, I ordered a Double-Double and a side of regular fries (I usually get the animal fries, but I wasn't feeling up to it that day). Then comes the wait as you congregate near the counter waiting for your number to be called. This more or less takes roughly ten minutes, depending on what you ordered. My Double-Double was pretty good; plenty of meat and flavor, with the cheese and the fresh vegetables a fine accompaniment to the meal. The fries were pretty fresh, and I did regret not getting animal fries (fries drizzled with their infamous animal sauce) instead, since I really just wanted to eat just the fries this time (I had animal fries every other time I came in here and want to change it up for a change, get the animal fries). The only thing that could have made this meal even better was if I just ordered the animal fries, which I'll do next time. \n\nIn the past, I also had the Neapolitan shake (basically chocolate, vanilla and strawberry shakes mixed in one). I highly recommend ordering any burger, the animal fries and the Neapolitan shake for a meal, especially if it's your first time here or even if you're just stopping by California. There is a good reason why people caw about this place as if this was their first-born child; the food here is just that good. Something so simple, yet so satisfying. For less than ten dollars, this is the best fast food that you can get in my opinion.", "author": "Nelson X."}

The ingredients were all fresh and the bun was slightly toasted so it was crispy with some great mayo sauce. This place was still packed at 9:30pm at night but there was luckily a couple that just left so I was able to snag a table. And despite the long ass line up (which apparently can be much worse than what I experienced), the food came in a reasonable amount of time - with my grilled onions to boot!\n\nIf I lived in California, I could definitely see myself grabbing burgers much more often if I lived near a In-N-Out.

The menu is pure simplicity--hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries, and shakes are all you'll find, but delve into their secret menu (which you can find online) to add many levels of customization! The simple hamburger here is my go-to. The patty is thin, fresh, and perfectly seasoned, while the amazing potato bun is crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. The lettuce, tomato, and onion add a nice refreshing flavor, and the thousand-island-like spread brings every bite of the burger together!

In either case, they have taste.\n\nThis burger was smaller than the lettuce and tomato.  The burger itself had no taste, like no seasoning at all.  The sauce tasted like watery thousand island dressing.  The french fries could have come to the rescue, but instead they were soggy and cold.  Their soft drinks even tasted bad...need to filter the water or clean the lines or something.\n\nI guess if I had to say something nice, I would say the bun was okay and the lettuce was crisp.\n\nCould it have been this location?

It cost less than $2 for a burger. \n\nI definitely think the burgers at shake shack is better because they use potato bread, good quality beef and green leafy lettuce. No wonder shake shack cost more. The in n out burger has ice berg lettuce and regular McDonald's type of buns, the burger itself was rather dried. But for less than $2 I think it's worth it.

In-n-out is the epitome of this. If I happened along one of these off the interstate of a western US trip, I would be impressed. But as one who rarely makes his way out here and hears about INO a TON, they come up just a little short. They are the epitome of overhype because it isn't that one super annoying guy telling you how great it is. It goes far beyond that and reaching national media.\n\nThis was my 2nd visit to INO. My first was in Las Vegas at a very late time after a very long day. So my tastebuds could have been fooled. Or perhaps that location churned out better food because they didn't have a line halfway to Oakland. One way or another, this trip was disappointing to say the least.\n\nWas my double patty and fries bad - not at all. But for being labeled by some as the BEST fast food burger in the country, I beg to differ... at least this location. The meat was slightly over cooked and could have used some seasoning.

If you are a tourist, local or maybe you travelled from a different state. This is probably the only In-N-Out in SF. But if you are adventurous and want to skip the long lines, just drive on other locations like in Union City down 30 minutes into the SF East Bay Area. \nI visited this branch and it was really busy, I mean the dining area was full of people eating their food, waiting for their food and there was a long line overflowing out of the door. I was crazy busy for a Saturday afternoon at 4:30PM.\nIf this is your first time - order a double double combo animal style (where the beef patties are cooked with mustard to be more flavorful, delicious burger), also comes with tomatoes, ask for grilled onions, lettuce, a grilled bun. Tell them to cook fries without the salt but slightly well done.\nThere are fans who come for these burgers, and they are wars battling who are the best burgers in the U.S.A. like Burger Shack, Five Guys, In-N-Out, Shake Shack and many more popping up on respective states.

My friends and I ventured to In-N-Out on a Saturday afternoon and we were shocked at how busy, yet efficient, the place was. The group that I was with had done their homework as there are some non-menu items that were highly suggested online. My friend, who ordered before me, got a double-double, with her onions grilled, and animal style fries. So being original, I ordered the same thing! What shocked me was that there were 40 orders that had to be filled prior to me receiving my order and I only waited less than 10 minutes! When I received my order, I was pumped, and I devoured every last bite rather quickly. The burger were awesome and the cheese/grilled onion covered fries were great! I enjoyed every bite. \n\nSince it was so busy in the place, our group of 5 had to sit at a table of 4 and one my friends sat on her suitcase. Halfway though our meal, one of the workers came by and offered to grab her a chair, which was nice, however she declined as she was leaving. Next thing you know the same worker came by and gave us In-N-Out bumper stickers and hats because he felt bad that she didn't have a chair.

And first, to answer the age old question of In-N-Out vs. Shake Shack, it's going to be Shake Shack for me.\n\nSince my friend and I wanted to try some seafood along Fisherman's Wharf, we decided to share a double double and animal style fries - in order to avoid feeling like greasy bears afterwards. The burger was pretty good, but not great. Maybe it's because I was already subconsciously comparing it to Shake Shack right after I took that first bite. It actually reminded me of a Double Stack from Wendy's. \n\nI did not like the Animal Style fries. This might be because they got cold really quickly. The cheese was not melted, so that, combined with their special sauce, made the fries kind of chunky. Not very appetizing.\n\nAlso, seating here is pretty hard to come by. It would be nice if they implemented a system where you could only have a seat once you get your food, but I really doubt that would happen  , since it's a fast food joint. It takes 2 minutes to put in your order, but 15-20 minutes to actually get your food.

Because its been five long and agonizing years since I had my last fix!\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nThey're located in Anchorage Square which is a shopping center so there's no drive thru.  Like most In N Outs, the inside is small and the crowds large, so seating was at a premium.  There was no organization at all as far as the ordering and pickup lines went, though the crowd seemed mindful of it all.  It's definitely not a relaxing dining experience as someone is always in your personal bubble space.  I wasn't planning on eating inside but my spouse found a counter seat for us.\n\nFOOD:\nDouble Double - Being an In N Out amateur, I forgot that you have to ask for GRILLED onions as the ones I got were yucky raw.  Other than picking them out, the burger was good but the patties were a tad salty.  I tried it animal style before but didn't care for it because I like my burgers simple, usually with just mayo.  However, not being a fan of their fries because they lack flavor, I was going to try them animal style but my spouse declined, so I was stuck with boring old fries.  I could've ordered my own but I was full on crab & chowder lol!\n\nSERVICE:\nFor being as bat ***t crazy as they were, all the workers were calm and collected.  The cashiers were especially friendly and patient.  My simple order took about 30 minutes from ordering to delivery.  \n\nTIP:\nDon't bother trying to guess if your order is up next because the numbers were random and not in numerical order.\n\nOVERALL:\nIt's not the best burger I've ever had, but it's pretty damn good for fast food, and a lot more affordable than their competition.", "author": "Vince N."}

Not dry in the sense that it was really salty and I was in need of water, but there wasn't enough oil and juice in the meal. The burger patties were borderline McDonald's patties, and the bun was really airy. The vegetables were good though, I have to admit, but that was all for the burger.\n\nAs for the fries, it was an absolute disaster. Out of all the fries in fast food, everybody has been acceptable so far, but In-N-Out? I don't know what is a closer description to the fries: veggie fries, or fried cardboard? The insides of the fries are super dry, and the fries have no flavor. But the defining worst part of them is that they are just not fried with enough oil that fries are. I guess it's an attempt to make something unhealthy healthier, but tough luck, In-N-Out.\n\nOverall, another underwhelming experience.

I only had to wait 10-15 minutes for my order, which is more than what I can ask for given the demand. As for the burger, it's easily one of the best I've ever had. Very cheap too! I also agree that animal style is better than the original; you get a lot more flavour with it too. The fries were also well done, and the animal style coating definitely made the fries tastier too.\n\nService was excellent in terms of speed, efficiency, and the fact there's always someone walking by to make sure the dining area is kept clean and everyone's satisfied with their meals.

The place is packed and finding a seat is difficult but not impossible. I mean, most people just eat and leave anyways. It's not a fancy restaurant to sit around and chat.\n\nBurgers aren't really special but the price you pay is spot on. The meat patty is actually thin. You don't get a lot of it. The burger comes with tomatoes,lettuce and some sauce and tastes okay. I am not a fan of their fries. Too think and not as soft as I like. \nHowever, there are some areas where this is better than most fast food joints. Service is surprisingly good considering how busy they are. And you get hot peppers along with the ketchup if you want. It's just okay for the quality of the food but when you put it alongside other burger places it's more like 4 stars.

The location is too small to be located in Fishermans Wharf, a major San Francisco attraction. Staff were nice and bubbly. Ordered and waited. Found a seat with a cool couple traveling from Canada.

All of the voices of praise played in my head. After the 3rd bite, nearly slammed it back on my tray. The burger was nothing. NOTHING. Indetectable seasoning or flavor. Barely juicy. Even the globs of cheese didn't help. And the fries? Cardboard!  No salt. No crisp. No taste. Nothing.\n\nAt one point, the couple and I locked eyes and our thoughts beautifully meshed: \"This is sh*t\".\n\nFirst time I didn't finish a burger & fries meal.

I searched for nearby locations and saw that there was one in the Fisherman's Wharf area. I knew how touristy Fisherman's Wharf area was and that this place would be very crowded but decided to go anyway. I went after the workday at about 5:30-6 PM and though the line extended to the door, it moved very fast. We were up to the registers in about 5-10 minutes. We ordered 4 meals (burgers, fries and a drink for about $8-9 per meal) and were immediately given cups for our fountain drinks. There is limited seating there especially given the crowd. The good thing is that eating doesn't take too long so there is a stream of people coming and going. While we were on line to order, we were able to get a seat. We waited for about 15 minutes or so and then our number was called. We navigated through the busy food waiting area and got our food. There is the fountain drink machine there as well as a condiment area with ketchup, mustard, straws and napkins. The burger was good. I would say better than McDonalds and Burger King, but not as good as Shake Shack or Five Guys. I was glad I was able to try it, but I am not sure I would return as there are better options out there.

Seeing the menu, there weren't too many options and they were standard burger options, for instance, hamburger, double burger, triple burger, cheeseburger. There were also drink options such as pop, or milkshakes including vanilla, strawberry or chocolate flavours.\n\nWhile waiting for our order, there was an employee who walked around to the booths (which were booth with hungry people who stared like wolves at those who were sitting down and ready to jump into the seats when they left) and was handing out condiments and In-N-Out paper hats. \n\nWe got our meal, I personally didn't think the burger was anything special, in addition, it was so big that I couldn't bite into it and the sauce kept spilling all over the place.

Parking is tough in this area and it's not in an area locals frequent, so I'd say the clientele is definitely mostly tourists which is cool; I'm happy they get to try our famous In-N-Out. In fact, if I'm at this In-N-Out, it's probably because I'm taking an out-of-state/country visitor here. It's a must-eat and a tasty bargain!\n\nAs per my suggestion, it's no secret, but order your cheeseburger \"animal-style\" for extra sauce, pickles, a mustard-grilled patty and grilled onions. I like to order mine with raw onions as well. When I'm being good, I will order mine protein-style, which is wrapped in lettuce instead of buns and I skip the tasty special sauce and just have mustard. Yum! Still tasty!\n\nDespite the food being good, the reason I'm waffling between 3 and 4 stars is because they have very limited seating for how especially crowded it is. It needs an upstairs seating area or some sort of expanded dining area. \n\nAlso, there's no bathroom here. There's a communal bathroom outside that's shared by the businesses in the area and it's nasty! It's always so dirty in there. Come on! How can a restaurant not have bathroom facilities? This is a high-traffic business; they can afford clean toilet facilities.\n\nSo, sorry...3 stars it is because the experience here just isn't as good as at other locations.

Majority of my friends said that In-N-Out was better than Shake Shack, plus the Instagram photos I always see makes this place so hard to resist!!\n\nI came on a rainy day and this place was so packed! There wasn't actually a line up to order the food, but the line could go out the door just for the food. I ordered the regular cheeseburger along with their famous animal style fries. I do have to say the food is a lot cheaper than Shake Shack. I waited approximately 20 minutes for my food and was lucky enough to get a seat at the joint.\n\nI first tried the animal style fries so they don't all quickly clump together, and I honestly wasn't a huge fan of it! It's weird because I love the cheese fries at SS, but the cheese sauce here wasn't warm and tasted really processed. I found that there was barely any flavour in it, and the grilled onions didn't help too much. Overall, I felt that it was just chewy and it wasn't my favourite.\n\nI was surprised at how big the burger was considering it's price. I felt that it was a simple cheeseburger that had a nice presentation. Maybe I should've tried something else because I had the Shroom Burger at SS and absolutely loved it. So, I can't really compare the two stores on their basic hamburger.", "author": "Joy P."}

After my partner begging me to get to this place, I finally caved and decided to join the hoard of people in the Fishermans Wharf location. Man..... the line was soooo long. Out the door and around the corner. I know that this is a popular tourist destination, but please.... It was a weekday just before 12pm. \n\nSo, when you tell your mates you are going to California, they tell you get to a In-N-Out. Just do it, they say. Your mouth will thank you later, they say. \n\nThe menu is actually quite small here. But, we found out there there are all sorts of secret menu additions to tell the staff to change your order. I really love that idea. It has definitely created a cult following. I was told that you have to order an Hamburger \"animal style\". This means you will get lettuce, tomato, a mustard cooked beef patty; add pickle, extra spread with grilled onions. I ordered that with fries and an iced tea. \n\nWe had to wait around just over 10 minutes for the burgers. Which is not too bad considering the flock of orders. It's cool to see them processing fresh potatoes through the machine to make super fresh real fries. The taste really reflected that. They were crispy and so much more tasty than other fast food joints. \n\nThe burger itself was a little of a let down though. Although it was one of the freshest fast food burgers I have had, it wasn't at all that special in flavour. Nothing too complicated or gourmet about it. Just a solid burger that aims to please the masses. The patty was flat and not particularly interesting. The bun was like any other fast food joint. \n\nI would much rather go here than McDonalds or Burger King for sure. But, I think that burgers at pubs or gourmet burger restaurants around SF are a lot more interesting. It was a-ok and I am glad I have crossed it from my list. But, I probably will not return when I go back to SF.", "author": "Anita D."}

Unfortunately, they are not available on the East coast, so every time I traveled to the West coast, I wanted to go to one of their IN-N-OUT locations, but never worked out... So, when I finally got to go to one, I was super excited!\n\nThey don't have enough amount of seating, but people don't really stay long time here, so the turnover is relatively fast. you can find a seat pretty easily with short wait time, but you have to be quick about it.\n\nOverall, I am very glad that I finally got to go to IN-N-OUT Burger, finally! And I enjoyed their food, it was simple but yet good quality and tasty. They are no longer that \"quick stop\" place, with so much fame and popularity, they are now \"IN-N-WAIT-N-OUT.\"  The service was just average, nothing special there. They don't have bathroom, but there is a public bathroom right outside, where they have more eating spots with tables and chairs (you could sit out there instead, if there is no seat inside IN-N-OUT).

Seems like everywhere you go you see the repeating signs; burgers, tacos, pizza, denny's, Walmart, KFC, McDonalds etc etc. So when Anthony Bordain tells you via the TV machine that you MUST have an in 'n' out burger and that it's the quintessential west coast USA thing to eat, you save your belly for it and eat things like smoothie bowls and sushi and the occasional fish taco so that when you do get to in 'n' out you can gorge yourself on the tasty delights.\n\nThis is what I did anyway. I was hanging to try in 'n' out all trip and did so on the second to last day in the USA. We were down at Fisherman's Warf in SF after visiting Alcatraz and walked town to the in 'n' out and joined the epic line stretching out the door.\n\nWhen we got to the counter the cashier was very friendly and asked what we would like. I quickly shot a glance right and then left and leant over and said in hushed tones: \"I'd like two cheeseburgers animal style with fries and drinks please\" thinking I was doing something awesome and special; as animal style is part of the secret menu which is only available if you know what to order because you have a smart phone and are capable of typing \"in 'n' out secret menu\" into google.\n\nMy partner scoped out the booths and saw that two young ladies were leaving soon and hovered over them waiting to swoop in as I waited for our order. The stars aligned perfectly and she nabbed the table literally one minute before our order was called.\n\nWe sat down with our animal style burgers (cooked with mustard, onions and cheese in the beef patty) and started tasting the burgers, but something was missing... ketchup and chilis! One of us went and grabbed those and we dug in again.\n\nNow, the novelty was great; but here's the thing. In my town of Adelaide in Australia a couple of guys went to the USA in the 2010's and obviously saw in 'n' out and other places and brought the concept back to Australia. Good examples of this are Nordburger and Burger Theory. To be honest, I like Nordburger's patties better than in 'n' out's. In 'n' out's were a bit flat. Their buns were great, as was the lettuce and tomato and the pickled chili's were awesome; but I was a little underwhelmed. Also the fries were average, and I know that they make them fresh in store so maybe processed fries are just better tasting even though they are bad for you.\n\nIt was very good, but not the epic dining experience I was expecting. I will definitely be back and want to try the double double or normal cheeseburger, but I'm not going to be as excited as I was the first time.", "author": "Aaron T."}

That being said, I have heard the hype surrounding this burger chain. Unfortunately for me, I feel that this particular chain did not live up to the expectations I had. Though the burger was great -- the meat was fresh and the fries were tasty -- I was underwhelmed.\n\nAt this particular in n out, the wait time was really quite long. I waited around 15 minutes to order and 15 minutes more before I received my food. My order was actually lost and I had to remind the cashier before I received my food, but I can't hold that against the restaurant as it was extremely crowded. Though the wait time was long, it seemed to be par for the course at fishermans wharf, so the long wait time really isn't a knock against the restaurant. \n\nWhat I was kind of disappointed about was the price, Id heard all kinds of stories about in n out's great prices, but I paid $8 for a cheeseburger meal. It wasn't expensive, but it really wasn't the value I was hoping to get. There are also so many different amazing seafood and other food options around that I felt my money could've been better spent elsewhere. \n\nOverall, I'd give this in n out 3.5 stars, and I would definitely want to go to in n out again, just not this one. The amazing alternatives, higher prices, and slower service at this restaurant make the other options at fishermans wharf better alternatives.", "author": "Kevin W."}

PLEASE EXPAND IN-N-OUT IN SAN FRANCISCO. this single location just isn't cutting it anymore. and i'll just support other chains locally until in-n-out cares enough to maintain mine and other locals' business.", "author": "Lars A."}

And since the only location is in Fisherman's Wharf, it's really only when I'm entertaining out of town guests and don't feel like getting gouged at mediocre Seafood/Italian restaurants.  In-N-Out definitely ranks as my favorite fast food burger, but I still prefer Super Duper for a slightly pricier fast casual burger.  So it's a treat when playing tour guide, but I don't necessarily go out of my way for it.\n\n4x4: This is just about the right size for me.  At 1/8 lb a patty, this is like a 1/2 pounder, but swimming in 4 slices of glorious American cheese.  Similar 1/2 pounder burgers at other joints never seem to have the same amount of cheesy goodness.  The veggies are a bit variable though.  Sometimes the tomatoes are ripe and juicy, but other times they are firm and bland.  Iceberg lettuce isn't that exciting and sometimes they put on too much, but removing it is easy enough.  I like asking for a toasted bun to add some texture.\n\nWell Done Fries: The struggle is real.  Regular fries tend to be a bit limp.  Well done fries border on potato sticks.

The other great thing, was that, from Union Square, it's convenient to get to this location via cable car. So I made the trip. Maybe I've never noticed it before, but the In-N-Out fries are kind of terrible. They're shriveled and not that tasty. I order the combo to get fries and a drink, but when I went to pick up my order, the guy said I didn't order fries :sad: He asked if I wanted to buy some, and I looked at the line and said no, I'm good. Someone must've seen the disappointment in my eyes, because they brought some fries to my table for me! I really appreciated the customer service focus and humanity of at the Wharf In-N-Out.

The scouts from California could not stop raving about this place!  Over the next couple of years, my Californian colleagues would just drool over the thought of getting burgers from here.  As a burger lover, I made it my mission to try it the next time that I was in California.  Finally, after 6 long years of waiting, I finally had the opportunity to try out this burger franchise during my business trip to San Francisco!   \n\nThe location by the Fisherman's Warf was crowded and I was intimidated by the long line spilling outside, but I was impressed by the speed at which all of the staff worked together to process the orders as quickly as they can.  As I waited in line, the anticipation of trying these famous burgers started building up quickly.  Finally, my order of a double double burger with a side of fries and special sauce was ready.  \n\nMy teeth slowly make its decent on the burger, and I am imagining fireworks as I take my first bite the burger.  However, there were no fireworks.  My life did not change with that bite.  In fact, it tasted like a regular burger that I'm used to eating back on the east coast.  Within less than a minute, my years of hopes and dreams of eating a life-changing burger vanished into nothingness.  Hoping to reignite my excitement, I eagerly turn to the fries.  As a fan of crispy foods, I ordered the special well-done fries.  However, quickly realized my mistake as soon as I took a bite into the crispy fries.  Yes, they were crispy.  However, the extra cooking time had also tried out the fries and left it tasting more like paper rather than like flavorful potatoes.  I definitely recommend ordering the normal fries over the well done ones, even if you claim to love crunchy foods.  \n\nOverall, the meal was very filling for the price and I have no complaints about the quality of the food.

Tourist, and I mean tour bus filled with tourist are dropped off here to eat their famous greasy burgers and fries.  The lines to order go out the door!  If you want to sit down, you'll need to be aggressive and persistent.  You literally have to stand and hover next to a table that 'appears' to be finishing up to grab a seat.  That doesn't guaranteed a seat when your order is up.  You may want form a strategy with your group and hover over several tables to ensure you get to SIT!  Yea.  That is how busy it is here.\n\nIt was a non-busy afternoon at work.  So, several co-workers and I took the plunge to maneuver around the mass of tourist to get here.  It took over 20 minutes to walk over.  Through-out the walk from Pier 17 to past Pier 39 was filled with part-gossip and part-work related conversation.  I tried to keep a steady heart rate from breathing hard through the power walk and talk.  It was a good calorie killer to our high calorie intake awaiting us.  After finally arriving, the cluster of people turned us off and we deemed NEVER to return again.  But once we were situated in a seat and starting gnawing on our double double animal style burgers and extra crispy fries, we asked each other, when are we coming back?!\n\nEvery time I eat at In-N-Out, it always rekindles my love affair with burgers.  They make it exactly the same at every location.  Dripping greasy meat patties slathered with their secret sauce and grilled onions.  My gosh, it was heaven on a bun that makes you hum a loud hmmm hmmm with each bite.  Tourist can sometimes be scary because one can come up to your while your humming and ask you to come get them in line when your done eating at your table.  Was I going to let her know?  Maybe.

I'm also usually a fan of most In-N-Outs because of the consistency of the service and final product, hence why you won't see me review every In-N-Outs I've visited. This particular In-N-Out stands out and not in a good way.\n\nIt's already bad enough as it is that this is the only In-N-Out in SF proper smack dab in the middle of Tourist Alley in Fishherman's Wharf. Normally that alone is a reason to avoid the place, but the No1DP gets a free pass as he fondly remembers this chain (my first recommendation to him days before we started dating) serving one of the most memorable burgers he's eaten. It's also one of the only three In-N-Outs in the US that doesn't have a drive-thru, which is counter to what In-N-Out stands for (\"do you want to eat this in your car\") but that also gets a free pass as there's already enough cars in the area as is. \n\nThe large Coke spill greeting us as we entered and the time it took for a staff member to clean it was the least of our issues. \n\nOur #2 combos with fries cooked well left much to be desired. The burger patty was dry and devoid of ketchup and animal style sauce. The lettuce and tomatoes were not fresh. What bothered me most of all was that even though I knew the wait would be longer for the fries to cook, the fries were not consistently crispy. In the neighborhood In-N-Outs closest to where I've lived I can always count on consistently crispy fries. Even though I'm usually able to finish a burger and fries as a meal it says something when I leave half my food uneaten and the No1DP barely touched his food.\n\nNo1DP notes that since we're in a touristy area, the staff doesn't have to care as much as they don't have to worry so much about attracting repeat customers. Just stick to eating clam chowder on bread bowls; though it's very touristy at least the food quality in even the most \"subpar\" restaurant is better than this sorry excuse of a burger.

The burgers are completely different, but still very tasty. My regular cheeseburger was simple, but the vegetables were crisp and super fresh, and the entire thing was well-balanced. It tasted like a much fresher version of the kind of cheeseburger you grew up getting at your local burger shack. The burger was pretty cheap (around $2 if I recall), but also pretty small. You definitely need to get sides as well, for which I chose the animal-style fries. These were much pricier than the burger but boy were they decadent. The fries themselves were nothing to write home about (my boyfriend actually had to go back in and get salt for his regular fries since they were unsalted), but covered in sauce, American cheese, and mounds of grilled onions, they were wonderful. I just wish they had been warmer. By the time I got to eat them after waiting about 5 minutes for my boyfriend's food, they were pretty cold and much less appetizing. My boyfriend also got a chocolate milkshake and it was super creamy and delicious.\n\nThe place itself was mobbed when we went in around lunch, but the employees were like a well-oiled machine, and we only ended up waiting about 15 minutes for our food.

Such a disappointment!! Probably it was because this is a touristic spot and they are really busy, but this is perhaps one of the WORST burgers and fries I've ever had. There needs to be some standard in how they handle and serve food so the quality can be consistent.

The lines are always lengthy but you can sip on your diet coke while you wait for your number to be called out. \n\nYou'll need to go out for a 10 mile run after this meal so I'd like to refer to Isaiah 40:31 -\n\nbut those who hope in the Lord\nwill renew their strength. \nThey will soar on wings like eagles; \nthey will run and not grow weary,\nthey will walk and not be faint.", "author": "Gerry T."}

Try dipping your french fries in the milkshakes, they're so incredibly thick and creamy. \n\nTip: if you are just getting a milkshake, they will bring it out to you as soon as you order.

I ordered a Double Double with fries and chocolate shake. It was very packed, but we managed to get a table and waited around 10 minutes for the food. The fries were a bit soggy, they didn't seem to be fresh or maybe under done. The burger was okay, but i didn't see anything special about it.. I've definitely had better burgers around the same price, but in In-N-Out's defense, they those places were craft burger spots not fast food. However, the shake, was delicious. It was very thick and creamy, would highly recommend getting on if you go to In-N-Out. \n\nOn the other hand, the place was very packed and not clean.

They're usually pretty consistent, but for some reason, this place was lacking a little bit. We were coming back from grabbing drinks across the Golden Gate Bridge in Sausalito and wanted some grub before turning in for the night. It was dinner time, but I'm pretty sure this location is almost always crowded. The line wasn't too bad, though, and we were able to get our order within 15-20 minutes. We snagged a seat (you have to be like a circling vulture in order to get a seat in this place!) and chowed down.\n\nThe thing I love about these burgers is that they always look so perfect. The bun is fluffy, the patty is juicy, and the lettuce/tomato/onion/spread combination is laid out perfectly. However, in this burger, the lettuce/tomato/onion/spread combination was kind of sad looking. The taste was decent, but not one of the best ones I've had. A little disappointing.

Go here only if:\n\n1) You are dying for In-N-Out.\n2) On foot...this is basically a walk up location. \n3) Don't mind the homeless bums sitting down next to you asking for some of your French fries. \n\nBeing from Oregon and staying nearby, we were ecstatic to see In-N-Out just a couple blocks from our hotel. We are huge In-N-Out fans, so we quickly added it to our must eat places while staying in SF the next few days. \n\nCrowded In-N-Outs are always something to contend with, especially during peak mealtimes, so we weren't overly dismayed by the long line to order or the filled tables.  Usually, if you don't have too many people lolly gagging over their meal, the tables always turn fast enough for you to snag one before your number is called.  \n\nNot so with our recent trip. Some people were just sitting there....and sitting there....reading, visiting, playing on their mobile devices....it was the first time EVER that our food was ready and no table was available.  Standing there holding our tray filled with two burgers & two baskets of hot fries, we waited and waited and waited....nibbling on a fry or two every couple of minutes. \n\nWhen a table finally opened up, this precocious little 12 year old, who was obviously delegated by her parents to score a table while they ordered, tried to sneak in ahead of us. A hard stare from both my wife & I as I held up our tray of food did the trick as she bowed her head and skulked away.  \n\nNow, I'm not deducting points for that. Crowds are no fault of In-N-Out. But what I am docking them for is lack of management \"protection\" for their patrons from the intrusion of multiple street bums!\n\nWhile waiting for that table, we witnessed several filthy, smelly, disgusting and down right revolting bums...who had not showered in who knows how long....enter the premises and attempt to mooch off diners.  Literally sitting down at an open chair next to a family of three and beg for fries. Or ask, mid bite on a burger, \"Are you going to finish that?\"\n\nWhen one kind hearted soul relented and said he'd give this one particular cretin some fries, the lout started to reach for them right off his tray and was told, \"No, I'll put some in a napkin for you.\"\n\nI may be sounding a bit harsh for those less fortunate, but there are boundaries that must be taken. Pan handling and begging are particularly distasteful to me no matter what the circumstances. But when I'm in a restaurant and I'm a paying customer, I expect some sort of protection from this establishment from behavior such as this.  \n\nSeveral employees witnessed it and behaved like it was the day to day norm. Additionally, the bums would come in with an empty cup, after obviously discarded in the trash, and proceed to get a \"free re-fill\" at the soda fountain. Pushing and shoving paying customers out of their way.  \n\nTo be brutally honest, if we hadn't have already ordered AND if we weren't dying for In-N-Out AND if we weren't pressed for time to get to our next engagement, we'd have just left.  In hind sight, I wish we had. The whole experience was rather nauseating and I place direct blame on lack of management to deal with the problem.\n\nWe won't be coming back to THIS In-N-Out and hope that anyone reading this review considers this information helpful if you are in the least bit worried about your dining environment.", "author": "Keith A."}

Because this was my worst In-N-Out experience yet.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nUgh, I hate that this happened.\n\nI had a picture perfect vision of In-N-Out.  I was practically one of their spokesmen.  The main appeal to me about In-N-Out is that I despise fast food, but In-N-Out never made me feel like I had just eaten fast food.  \n\nYou know when you go to McDonald's and then afterward it feels like you just ate parts of a used tire that was infested with small animals known to attack the lining of your stomach?  Yeah, I'm convinced that's what a Big Mac is.  The secret sauce is egg batter left over from 8-46 day old Egg McMuffin's, I'm convinced.  46 days old is the threshold, 47 days would be lethal.  Skeptical?  Read a book, would ya?\n\nIn-N-Out has the exact opposite effect on me.  After eating a double-double animal style burger with animal style fries and a milk shake...I normally feel like I can go play a some full-court basketball.  It won't help my broke shot, but I don't feel weighed down and bloated the way that normal food makes you feel.\n\nUnfortunately, the location at Fisherman's Wharf humanized In-N-Out for me.  It made me realize that In-N-Out is human and capable of mistakes.  The result of this meal was very McDonaldsian.  I wonder if they ran out of secret sauce and had to borrow some from the Golden Arches.  Instead of the desire to play basketball afterward, I wanted to go play a game of \"pass out because my body is rejecting its latest input.\"\n\nI will visit In-N-Out again next time I am in California, but probably not at Fisherman's Wharf.", "author": "Brett N."}

Most In-N-Outs in major metropolitan cities of California will almost always been flooded with people, be it animal style craving locals or double double curious visitors. It's the fact I've always found the service here to be minimal, just enough to take an order and hand out the food without the usual smiles and occasional winks. They're curt, perhaps because it's Fisherman's Wharf to begin with and because they have no nearby In-N-Out options to relieve the pressure.

It was a little messy but most burgers are. \n\nAll in all this was a necessary life experience for me.

With its calming, austere & simple menu, it reduces choice fatigue. It feels decisive. That therapist would know I enjoy art in the form of marketplace design somuchso I would hang this menu on my entry way wall. And then the off menu dynamic. It's liberating. It tells us it's rebellious. Everything is swift. And the contents of the menu... satisfy rebellion, mischief, nostalgia & 1955 youth. \n\nMerely witnessing the hidden menu or hearing about it in line is almost enough. Contemplating items like root beer floats, protein style, animal style, the quadruple, and the trendy Monkey Style. \n\nThis location is not ideal. Being the only one in the city makes for an air of competition against our In N Out peers. For seats, mainly. However, the outside patio is the must go to if you're up for bundling up or eating without that classic din of the place. \n\nMonkey Style: it's DIY. Animal Style fries + double double or any other burger and stuff the ASF in between the buns. It's what it's cracked up to be. \n\nEvery time I want the shake. Every time I regret it. Same with the root beer float. Water really is the best choice for the consumption with a side of root beer. \n\nI'd eat this anywhere in the world and imagine that Singapore pop up In N Out is at the top of the surreal.

You didn't get that smile, great service or fresh hot food that you are used to from In N Out at this location. The girl shouting guest's order numbers was so angry. I don't know if she was in physical pain, hated her life, or what, but she screamed numbers like a real asshole with a look on her face like she wanted to bite your face off and suck out your soul bc she clearly didn't have one - I just wanted to leave, and I wish I had. Her coworker's working in the back even called her out on her angry yelling of guest's orders and she ripped her around like the fuckin Exorcist and told em IM GONNA KILL YOU! I got my food right when they called it and my burger and cheese was cold when I came to table to eat it. Gross! It wasn't even busy in the restaurant.  When I went up to ask for spread it took as long as it does at a busy bar to get it because everyone ignored me.

Ever since I became vegan a while back though, I obviously had to give those up however I still was able to enjoy their burgers and fries by customizing it right and it became a very suitable (and much cheaper) option for vegans like me!  The \"veggie burger\" on their secret menu are really good and here are tips on ordering so you can get the most flavor out this patty-less burger.  Even if you're a carnivore, you should definitely give this a try!\n\n So how to order a great VEGAN burger.  Order the \"veggie burger\" with:\n- Extra everything (you get more lettuce and tomatoes)\n- Ketchup + Mustard instead of spread\n- Onions grilled and chopped (a must!)\n- Add chopped pickles\n- Add chopped chillies\n\nAll of these add-ons are free and the veggie burger came out to be just $2!  Add fries and a cup for water + lemon and your whole meal is under $5 with tax included.  Since I don't work close to In N Out anymore and I can't just live on veggie burgers, I don't go here as often but whenever I'm around the neighborhood I definitely go out of my way to stop by and be the weird guy who makes so many order requests for a patty-less burger! ;)", "author": "Green C."}

Is it the meat, or the cheese, or all those fresh veggies? Is it the sauce or just the funky sign? Nobody knows and nobody cares cause when you eat that double double animal style its a five minute trip to heaven. Whats also remarkable about the food is that you actually dont feel like crap for hours after such as with any other fast food chain out there.\n\nOnly thing one COULD complain about (and I wont cause it would be frivolous) is the quality of the fries which is barely average.

Like, I know this is an institution and was supposedly created by God to give Westerners the beautiful gift of a delicious and cheap fast food hamburger, but I have to stop short of calling it the 8th Wonder of the World.\n\nRealistically, it was just OK.\n\nOK, I'll say it's good-ish, based on the category of fast food, the price point, and the taste, since similar competition is not quite up to par.\n\nBut maybe I am biased.  I ordered a cheeseburger (no onion) with fries and a water, and my burger came out with the sickest, stinky onion ever.  No matter what anyone says, that onion flavor seeps into everything (including your breath after - ick!) and, quite honestly, it ruined a lil bit of the taste for me.  The patty itself was good, and I appreciated the crustiness around the edge.  I am unsure what the special sauce was made of, but stealing a couple extra packets for future usage would have been nice.  \n\nThe fries?  Standard.  Greasy, soggy, just enough salt, but again, nothing over the top.  Admittedly I forgot to order them animal style, but I was in the heat of the moment.  I mean, when you've waited THIS long to try it and that pinnacle moment finally comes, you forget your words and make erroneous ordering errors.  Oops.\n\nAnd sorry, I went with water over a milk shake.  HYDRATION.  Call me low-cal Damian, but I just couldn't do it.  \n\nOK, fine, so maybe this review needs an \"I'll be back again and will order everything the proper way\" disclaimer at the end, so I will oblige.  I'll give it a second shot next time I am within striking distance.", "author": "Damian C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-24", "description": "A few years back when I visited San Francisco for the first time, I walked pass this In-N-Out. I asked my Californian friend what this was and she said \"it's just fast food, like McDonald's.\" Since I no longer eat at McDonald's, I guessed it's something not worth going to. Not until about a year later, I learned that In-N-Out is like a Shake Shack in NYC. So I have placed In-N-Out as a must try when I return to California.\n\nSo on my recent trip to California, the first meal I had after I landed was at In-N-Out. Yes, it was that serious of a matter. When I got there it wasn't really that crowded. I ordered a cheeseburger with fries, both animal style and a strawberry shake. The burger was pretty good. The patty was juicy and tender and the sauce was pretty darn good. The fries were good, especially with animal style. The strawberry shake was very smooth and not overly sweet. The entire meal was pretty cheap.\n\nSo now that I've had my share of In-N-Out, I can truly say that I really didn't miss out too much. Yes, the animal style and the spread was good, but the burgers at Shake Shack has stolen my heart. Also, their shakes and concrete drinks are amazing! Yes, I do have to admit that one Shack burger can buy me about 2.5 cheeseburgers at In-N-Out. It's not that I dislike In-N-Out, but I think all the rave and hype about In-N-Out has been a let down to me when I finally gotten to try it.

The line at this In-N-Out Burger really reflects the diversity of its fans and just how far word has spread about these tasty little four-by-fours and animal style fries.  We shared a table with a young student from Korea who took tremendous care in eating her first ever In-N-Out Burger.  A few tables away a family of five applauded as their baby girl dove her fingers into her animal-style fries.  Then there were people like me, natives who were driven out of our homes by the obscene housing market and rent.  Kids who grew up on their perfectly cooked burgers, never questioning our Burger Privilege as Californians, just as we never questioned our wonderful weather or proximity to the sea or abundance of good Mexican food.\n\nAnyway, the reason I didn't give this particular store of my favourite chain five stars is that it is impossibly crowded and the restrooms are repulsive. Like most of San Francisco, the storefront has that unique human pee smell mixed with seagull dung.  The seats and tables were all covered in stray lettuce shreads and ketchup blobs - with such a high quantity of customers lurking for the quickest available seat, I imagine the staff don't get a lot of time to clean up here properly.\n\nHowever, when it gets down to it, I just really hadn't had an In-N-Out Burger in too long as I live in exile, so I ate it, regardless of my surroundings and who was watching and what I was sitting on.

I recently visited this location, and was fully aware that it is one of the busiest locations In N Out operates. But when you have people visiting California, In N Out is definitely a must stop. \n\nWhile waiting for our food (in what feels like a sardine can with the amount of people waiting), we finally ended up finding a table. When my number was called, I had to push my way through the crowd to get the food, again, expected. However, when I came up to the counter for my food, the clerk would not give me the food without my receipt. Here's my problem with this: 1) No one ever told us to keep our receipt when we paid, and I don't typically do this at other locations. 2) When he realized how far away and through the crowd I would have to walk to get back to my table to LOOK for a receipt that I wasn't even sure we kept, could he not have just asked me what we ordered? I could have told him item by item exactly what we ordered. When I asked him if it was necessary for me to go back and search for it, he said yes, it is In N Out's policy, and he was quite rude doing so. My issue is that either this is the policy, or it isn't. No other locations make you show proof of purchase to pick up your order, so why the insistence? Either way, I pushed my way through the crowd to our table, ended up finding the receipt after digging through my stuff, and pushed back to the front to get our food. When I stepped up to the counter with a piece of paper in my hand, he gave me the food. He didn't ask for the receipt, he didn't even ask to look at it. So all of that work, for nothing? He was rude for no reason?\n\nOverall, it was a really crappy experience. It would have been no big deal if the cashier had told us to keep our receipt to pick up our food.

This was my second time in the city, so I wasn't a total noob on the ins and outs of this place (pun totally intended).\n\nFor fast food, honestly this place beats basically every place on the East Coast for many reasons. This location in particular is impressive with service, especially on the day I was there which was the Saturday of Martin Luther King Day Weekend. IT. WAS.PACKED to full capacity, probably mostly tourists, but still, the fact that I didn't see any mixing up of orders and the rate they were pumping out the food just speaks volumes to the management of the place.\n\nThe cashiers themselves were calm, friendly, and helpful, despite the endless flock of people churning in every minute. I definitely didn't feel rushed to make a decision of what to order.\n\nI ordered a double double special no cheese (yeah whatever I'm trying to be fat and healthy at the same time), which comes with a side of their regular fries and a medium drink. All that came out to a mere total of $7.50!!!! I'd forgotten how cheap the food is compared to NYC. Seriously, I could live here forever and not starve. You could feed an entire family for probably $20-$30 here. That's an entire mediocre entree that's bound to leave your stomach rumbling at an overhyped mediocre restaurant in the Big Apple! And you will leave this place FULL. \n\nYou might be saying, no duh, it's a fast food restaurant. Well yeah, but the quality of this place takes it up a notch from your dingey McD's. It's Five Guys for the people who would like to save their hard-earned $$ and still be full.\n\nWhile there is definitely not enough seating inside on a crowded day, it's okay because there's some outdoor seating, or you could just take it to go and enjoy on green near the waterfront. It was always sunny when I was there. \n\nAnd lastly, you probably know about their secret menu with the animal fries, lettuce wrapped burger, and other things?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-10", "description": "Really enjoyed In-N-Out a lot, for it being my first time to one. Great customer service that reminded me of other fast food chains that tend to excel on this aspect, such as Chick-Fil-A and Culver's. I have a strong suspicion for whatever reason I wouldn't have enjoyed their food as much, if it wasn't for reading up on the secret menu beforehand. And unlike years ago, one can now find it on InO's website: http://www.in-n-out.com/menu/not-so-secret-menu.aspx\n\nIt does make me a little disappointed that you can't order bacon for any of their burgers if you desire it, nor can you choose to order onion rings instead of fries from what I can tell. And even when I remembered to order the fries well done one time, it only improved their fries slightly. That said, the animal style sauce is absolutely awesome, and I wish M Burger(inspired by In-N-Out, from what I've read) in Chicago actually offered a sauce like InO's animal sauce! (correct me if I'm wrong about M Burger, Chicago area residents and visitors who've been to one) The neopolitan shake was also great(mix of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry shakes together), and I think it'd help InO to have a second location somewhere else within SF, to reduce the crowds at this location. Agree the dining room often looked really packed, and why I always ordered my food to go each time I visited. Though honestly I admire the fact that the service was never too bad on any of my visits here, and they do seem to maintain decent service at this one, despite the big crowds it gets for being the only one within SF.\n\nIf I ever get to another InO(which I suspect one day I will), I'd like to see how their grilled cheese sandwich is like. In the end though(note I've never had a Shake Shack burger, and am only comparing it against other chains in this sentence), my verdict is that I liked the burger here more than Five Guys, but that I prefer Culver's for their burgers, and that both Culver's and Five Guys have better fries(looking at that aspect alone, sans animal style sauce). The animal style sauce is unique OTOH, and something where I wouldn't mind learning the recipe to make such a sauce on my own(lol).", "author": "Allan M."}

While both make great cars, you can't really compare them head to head as they're not quite in the same class (albeit almost).\n\nI'd consider In-N-Out to be more of a traditional fast-food burger similar to Mcdonalds, BK, etc. Within this class, In-N-Out completely dominates the competition as they make great burgers that are juicy, never frozen and topped with an amazing big-mac-esque sauce.\n\nHowever, I just don't see the merit in comparing it to the likes of Five Guys or Shake Shack. Five guys is in that space between a fast-food burger and a gourmet burger while Shack Shack is on the cusp of full consideration as a gourmet burger.\n\nEitherway, In-N-Out is damn delicious but I'll still take Five Guys anyday!", "author": "Michael S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-23", "description": "Even people that have not been to the West Coast have heard of In-N-Out Burger.  The unique chain offers some of the top fast-food burgers in the country.  Though the menu only specifies standards like a traditional hamburger or cheeseburger, there is also a secret menu that allows insiders to customize their meal.  For example, the Protein Style replaces the bun with two substantially thick leaves of iceberg lettuce.  This preparation is messier than the usual version, sending meat juices and their special sauce dripping from all angles.  Though one might need to run and wash their hands after eating, at least they can take pride in the fact that they chose a healthier route.  The burger patty itself is thin and lacking the fire-grilled smokiness of Burger King's version, but the well-seasoned meat is still flavorful.  \n\nWhen on the West Coast, definitely stop into a In-N-Out Burger.  This particular location is right in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf and provides a decent number of convenient dining tables.", "author": "Alison C."}

Don't be fooled by the fact that this is a chain and has a distasteful fast-food vibe.   You can guarantee that you will get service with a smile, burgers that are never frozen and fries that are actually cut from fresh potatoes and then fried in the back (you can see this happen if you ever happen to look past the register).\n\nIn a time where quality is often compromised for price and efficiency, In-N-Out can still boast quality, freshness and a very fair price for what they offer on their menu.  Frankly, I don't mind waiting a little longer for my meal when I know that what I am getting is worth the wait.\n\nIf you do a little research on the internet, you will see that there is an entire \"secret\" menu aka unpublished menu from which you can take your order from ordinary to extraordinary.  My personal favorite is ordering a cheeseburger and french fries animal style, which is grilled onions and this interesting \"thousand island\" type dressing.  \n\nIf you do happen to feel guilty about indulging in fast food, In-N-Out does a carb free version of their burger which arrives in a lettuce lap instead of between a bun.  This is actually very tasty and a great option if you're in the mood for a lighter option.\n\nI wish In-N-Out would make their fries a little thicker because I'm not a fan of shoestring fries, but it's the burger that keeps me coming back .", "author": "Antaash U."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-30", "description": "I'm a biased, NY born, shake shack lover, but I really enjoyed in-n-out. The issue I had was mainly with the fries, and the setup of the restaurant. \n\nThe burger was 5 stars. For the price, it was exactly the kind of delicious, cheesy, greasy mess that I only allow myself to have once every few weeks. I really enjoyed it, and it's competitively one of the better fast food burgers I've had. The issue was with the fries. I did get the animal fries, and I enjoyed the sauce, but the fries were not that crispy. I'm not sure if I came on a bad day, but with the high volume of customers, I can imagine they were making fresh fries every few minutes. They were okay, but just not as good as the burger.\n\nMy other issue is with the layout. After ordering, my friend and I immediately found a seat (very lucky, at this location). But after realising that our food might take a few minutes, we got up and let someone else who had food in their hands sit down instead. The issue is ... once we got our food, we couldn't find a seat for 10-15 minutes, because people who had just ordered (and were about to wait 20 minutes for their food, during which time I could've eaten my entire meal three times) were taking all of them. On top of that, people tried grabbing seats that we were standing right in front of, with our food, when they had no food in their hands. Maybe this shouldn't be part of my review, and should be part of my memoirs on why I hate mankind, but I've seen places that disallow you from sitting without having food in your hands, and it works out probably 95% of the time that everyone gets a seat. Yes, even with a line out the door. Management could put up a few signs, and make it the norm that you can ask someone for their seats if you have food in your hands and they don't.", "author": "Chris H."}

Sure. But for a fast food joint, In-N-Out is definitely still among the better, if not best, ones.\n\nThe main purpose of this review is to note caveats about this particular location, which have to do with it being the only one in SF proper, and in the oh-so-touristy Fisherman's Wharf at that, too. What this means is that finding parking may be difficult depending on when you go, and that you should always expect it to be pretty packed. Now, the lines move fast enough - the problem that you're more likely to face is lack of seating inside the venue itself. And while there's plenty of outdoor seating in the inner atrium to the right, as you exit, on days with blistering wind, it's not the most pleasant location to be eating.", "author": "Johnny W."}

So much pressure on this one. \n\nI will start by saying I think everyone hyped it up WAYY to much for me. It was a delicious burger don't get me wrong, but it was way hyped. I actually have no idea why we waited in line for like 20 minutes to eat here. Maybe because Cincy is known for so many delicious burgers that this one kind of fell off the map for me.  \n\nThis place was a mad house! It looked the the apocalypse was going to happen and this was the last thing on earth people wanted (Tourists and locals alike). After we finally get up to the line we order, my veteran friend I was with orders for me and says \"Animal style of course\" I had no idea what it was. Apparently it is mustard, thousand island with sauteed onions, pickles, and mayo? Idk it was a great topping though, I'm glad I got it. The burger itself was plump and grilled to perfection. I love when the outside is crispy off the griddle. The bun however, was grilled with butter, good thought, but mind was kinda burnt and made the rest of the burger taste not so good. \n\nThe fries were horrid. I don't know how because they are fresh cut? Maybe the grease was old or something but I took one bite and didn't eat them. Looking around the restaurant nobody was really eating their fries, in fact. I saw bins, upon bins of them getting thrown in the trash. Sad all those potatoes had to die :/\n\nOverall I'm glad I tried this crazy San Fran fad, but honestly I don't think I would go back.", "author": "Cindy G."}

It makes you feel part of a special club knowing these things.  \n\nLet's start with the patty.  It's fresh and it tastes good.  The fries are cut right there and then, before it falls into the oil.  I love this place! \n\nThe only comment I have is the onions.  Grilled onions tastes so much better than uncooked onions.  The uncooked onions are too overpowering and kills all the flavors of the hamburger.  Next time, I'll order it without the onions.", "author": "Reid A."}

This place was slammed, I had to deliberately scout a table where I could eat. That really isn't their fault, but I didn't really expect a fast food place to be the hottest restaurant in town. Anyways, the burger was really good. You could tell it was fresh and the toppings are awesome, love the sauce. I did not love my fries, they were awful. Fries were hard and cold. Mine were almost animal sans the onion, so they were covered in cheese and the sauce. I think the cheese and sauce made them edible because they were so hard otherwise. The fries made my meal to be a bit of a disappointment.

The next morning, it's water with Alka Seltzer, followed by fruit and a Blue Ice Gatorade (you're welcome). \n\nHowever while I was in SF for work, I couldn't do that. Something about the Marriott frowning upon microwaving 40 pizza rolls in my hotel room. Fortunately I travel with a genius coworker who had discovered In-N-Out Burger on his last trip to SF, and wisely guided us to this neon-lit beacon of sovereignty to save us from excruciating work days of hell plagued by hangovers. \n\nFirst of all, In-N-Out is stupid cheap. One animal-style burger and one animal-style french fry was enough to send my liquor-sloshed tummy into quiet abyss. If you're a boy, you may want more. The boys I traveled with got a hella lot more. So keep that in mind if you're a hungry drunk. \n\nSecond, get your shiz animal style or don't get it at all. You can get fries anywhere. You cannot get fries anywhere else with grilled onions, relish, cheddar and Thousand Island. Get a fork and get to work. \n\nThird, be prepared to wait. In-N-Out is located in tourist central and the line is always long. Short skirts and tips won't help you get your grub any faster. The food is made fresh (which means it's not a total fast food hell hole as some have described), and there will always be 15,432 people in front of you. \n\nAnd fourth, skip the shake. Sugar is no bueno on an alcohol-soused tummy. Get a water and a diet soda if you must and eat your food in-house. It's not so awesome after a 20 minute cab ride. \n\nOh, and you can also eat here sober. Naturally, it isn't nearly as good.", "author": "Sarah V."}

Yeah, I counted the minutes before I was reunited with In-N-Out.\n\nThis was a special occassion.  That meant I went with a 3x3 Animal Style.  As the story goes with most, that ish was gooooood.

There are not any In-N-Out Burgers anywhere near me so  I thought why not give them a try.  \nIn-N-Out Burger has two menu items, burgers,(one patty or two) and fries.   The patties appear to be a standard 2 or 3 ounce patty.  What does that take to cook front to back 2 maybe 3 minutes?  How is it even possible for two burgers and fries to take over 10 minutes.  I am baffeled at how slow they were.  There was a little bit of a line but they were far from crowded.  It was clear that it wasn't just my order that was taking so long.  I saw a lot of people waiting for food with me.\n\nThe burgers were okay at best.  They are not close to as good as say Wendy's, McDonalds, Burger King, Whataburger, Red Robin, Chargrill, Hardee's, Arby's, Sonic, White Castle, Krystal, Dicks, Roy Rodgers, Fudruckers, A&W, Cook Out, Jack In the Box, Morning Star Burgers from the freezer case, or Dairy Queen but the burgers aren't that bad.  \nI am at a loss to understand the great reviews.  In-N-Out burgers are a thin patty of meat with onion, lettuce and tomato period.  There is little or nothing else to them.  What do all these people see in these mediocre burgers.\nThe bigger question to me is who are the people who can stomach their fries.  In-N-Out Burger's fries are without question the single worst fries I have ever eaten.  They are not even on par with fries you get in TV dinners.  There are god awful and that is being generous.  I am here to say the emporor has no clothes.  \n\nThe service was a bit spotty.  The cashiers I spoke with were nice but  the young man that gave me my food handed it to me and vanished.  I all but had to nearly physically tackle another employee to get some ketchup for my fries.  \n\nAs for the restaurant I found it odd that it didn't have a rest room in or near it.", "author": "Brad P."}

After all, why else would IN-N-OUT locate their one and only city store in the most pedestrian-congested, tourist-infested, cable car-constipated, fishy-smelling block of San Francisco? But it's worth my penance to get the best chain burgers bar none. I respect a place that knows how to focus, focus, focus --- burgers, fries, and milkshakes --- and that's it. No healthy salads. No monster tacos. No jalapeno chicken sandwiches.\r\n\r\nAs we have all seen, the chains that spread themselves too thin with their menu options are doomed by their mediocrity. As we all know from \"Survivor\", the team is only as good as its weakest link, and that applies to those 100-item menus at McDonald's and Jack-in-the-Box. The quality of everything suffers at those places. You want variety? Try their secret menu, for example, the 4x4 for four patties and four cheese slices and the Neapolitan shake that mixes all three flavors. A secret handshake is not necessary to get them. \r\n\r\nSeating can be an issue at this cramped location. When you get your number, make sure to scope out any empty plastic seat. I usually hover around people who have the audacity to be chatting after they finish their meals. A couple of clearly audible sighs as you carry your red tray usually do the trick.

On my last night after walking back from Pier 39 I decided to find out what all the hype was about. The line was long and there were tons of people sitting around and waiting for their orders. I could tell that In-N-Out Burger was feeding some serious food addictions.\n \nWhat was most notable was how efficient the staff works. They were like automated robots. Working at those speeds would give me a headache. The process went something like create-a-burger, scoop-some-fries, make-a-shake, yell-out-the- order...repeat. I've never seen people make shakes so fast in my life.  My eyes were bopping all over the place trying to keep up with them.\n\nI ordered a veggie cheeseburger without the patty. I am not sure they even have veggie patties. It's basically a bun with toppings (L,T,O - pickles are not automatic) and special sauce. I was not even hungry when I ordered the veggie burger since I had just eaten a crepe, but I was just too curious to pass it up. Oddly enough the best part of the sandwich was the big hunk of onion. Normally onions are not my thing but the onion was so fresh it tasted like an apple. The cheese was also thick and creamy. Despite being full, I ate the entire sandwich and yes it was worth it! \n\nI also think it's cool that they have secret menus and that the staff actually has to know the secret menu well enough to take an order even though people don't always order from it. I read a pretty cool article about a guy who ordered everything off of the secret menu and the cashier was elated to get to finally put his knowledge to the test. These are some serious burger people.", "author": "Angel W."}

Because the customer service was excellent, the food was delicious, and the order came quickly considering this is a super touristy area.\n\nMy first visit 2 years ago, I order a double double animal style, fries animal style, and choco shake -- which turned out to be far too unctuous for one meal.  This time I ordered a double double, Animal style, extra pickles, no lettuce no tomato, regular fries, and a strawberry-choco milkshake. I asked for my meal to stay and sat in the shade with the pigeons around the corner.\n\nThe first thing I did was rip that paper blanket off and eat saucy side first, mmmmmmmmm.  Then I poured 2 packets of black pepper into my ketchup and stirred with a fry, because that is how I roll, yummo! By that time, my shake had developed that slightly melted outer portion which is a great chaser for salty fries.  As I savored and devoured (savoured?) my meal, I enjoyed watching the pigeons bomb dive into the trashcans for fries and also scare unknowing diners when they threw their trash in. I'm from NYC, pigeon behavior amuses me so long as I am not their target. After I could not eat any more, I placed my dish of fries on the floor so the birds wouldn't crowd the trashcan while I disposed of my trash. Tell you what, it is HILARIOUS to watch non-urban folks react to pigeons. I heard \"gross\", \"disgusting\", \"piranha\" several times.  After the birds were done, I waited for them to clear and I threw the paper boat away. 'Twas a wonderful lunch time, reminded me of dining at a certain famous burger spot in a NYC park, yanno?\n\nA few days later, I brought my husband and I ordered for the both of us: 2 double doubles Animal style no lettuce no tomato, regular fries, choco shake, and Coke. This was plenty for 2 people to eat. I enjoyed my burger more this time because my previous one was too salty due to extra pickles. My husband said that he prefers the burgers of a certain chain that serves peanuts while they fry up your never frozen patty, because he prefers the taste of beef to the taste of spread.   Me? I just love a burger.\n\nTip: Make sure to ask for the bathroom code.", "author": "Siu L."}

You know how with some fast food, you have to weigh the pro's and con's? Is this worth the calories/guilt/extra time at the gym? Yeah, well, let me tell you that In-N-Out is worth all of the above, and then some. \n\nI always go for the double-double, animal style, which, just as it sounds, is double trouble for my waistline, but is one of those experiences that you I absolutely savor. From the first bite, to the last, this burger is finger/paper wrapper licking good. Fresh baked bun, juicy, moist patties, mustard grilled ONTO the patty, secret sauce, grilled onions, and pickles... LOTS of pickles... ohhh, I am quite tempted to leave the comfort of my hotel room and go get one this second! While the value meal is an appealing option because of the price point, and the combo of burger/fries/drink, if you do go with a double-double, don't even bother with fries. You won't have room for it. No matter how much of an eater you may be, the burger alone is so satisfying that there just is no need for fries. I also suggest you skip the soda as well, and go for the gold in gluttony, with a vanilla milkshake. Made with homemade ice-cream, this thick, dreamy, frosty is every fantasy you have ever had, come true. \n\nI will be kind enough to tell you that once you finish said burger and shake, you will not be able to move. And because this particular location is rather tight as far as seating goes, you'll want to pace yourself, because other gluttonous devotees are eagerly anticipating their turn to sit down and go to town on their order. If you can avoid this spot at lunch time or when people get off work, you'll likely miss the major crowding and lines, but the cashiers are so friendly and fast, that if the food alone wasn't worth the wait, their smiles and terrific customer service would be.", "author": "Elly S."}

Folks, In-N-Out isn't gourmet, it's a full step above McD and BK-- elevated grunge.  Without question, using meat which has never been frozen benefits both taste and texture; BK's beef is never frozen either.  The burgers are thicker, have some discernible seasoning (other than salt) and are served on a premium bun.  This brings In-N-Out to the level of a decent Jersey diner burger.  The In-N-Out burger is extremely greasy, and the little beef flavor they have is lost to the mustard and ketchup.  Why this place is packed to the rafters during lunch hour is part trend, part lack of inexpensive neighborhood dining options.  There's absolutely nothing special about their fries, and the attitudes of the counter staff are just sad.", "author": "Steve G."}

Talk about adding this gem to my list of new-favourite-places-now-that-I-eat-meat. I've been schooled in the art of burger by one Christopher M, husband-to-be, and this man states that a good burger should not be a gigantic brick of meat piled high with unnecessaries on a giant bun with a stick through it that you can't get your mouth round. I.e., gourmet burgers. Nope, they should be handheld snackable little beauties with a thin patty, gherkins, sauce and cheese.\n\nGetting a cheeseburger here animal style doesn't ruin that concept. It ENHANCES it. I also got animal style fries, as I remember them being a bit lacklustre last time round. Rookie mistake. My dear friend Diana P recommended afterwards that I should get the fries well done. It apparently adds a hot crispiness to them that they otherwise miss.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-03-19", "description": "1.5 stars. This In-N-Out, by far, is the worst one I've ever been to. We came here shortly it opened for the day, so luckily there wasn't as much people. We wanted a cheap, but decent quick lunch, and you can't go wrong with In-N-Out even though it's fast food.. Or so we thought..\n\nThis place lacks the standard customer service and upkeep and everything one would normally expect of \"In-N-Out.\" If the CEO or any other manager walked into this place (as an undercover boss--or not even undercover), they would be appalled by the horrendous service at this location. The service was both slow and unattentive. It seemed that high schoolers were the only ones running this joint: talking behind the counter amongst themselves and on their phones while customers are waiting for them for their order to be taken. I felt bad for the few workers who were busting their butts to get the food out while the cashiers leisurely lounged around. We sat down after we ordered and chose the cleanest vacant table. As we were waiting, we noticed other seated patrons before us haven't received their orders. The place gradually became busy packed and we still haven't received our food--they must've been out back slaughtering the cows and grinding up the meat for us. \n\nWait time for our food was about 10mins. Keep in mind that this In-N-Out does NOT have a drive thru, so the workers only have to tend to whoever walks through the door. I've received 5x speedier service at all the other In-N-Out locations I've been to (when there was a full-house & a 2nd parking lot full of cars waiting at their drive-thrus)--all without neglecting customer service. Yes, this place is slow, not only for an In-N-Out, but for a general fast food joint.\n\nHonestly, when I saw that there was no drive-thru at this location & that the place was barely a quarter full of other patrons, I was thinking \"Yes! No wait time!\" --Guess my thoughts jinxed this experience. \n\nThe food tasted as it should. The tables weren't very clean (sticky + residues + garbage), but that's probably because the prior customers and the youngster workers  who chatted up a storm behind the cash registers didn't feel like cleaning up the mess.\n\nI have a lot of respect for fast food workers & workers in the food service industry general. Especially places that are always super busy like In-N-Out. I can't respect those who are on their phones or socializing amongst themselves instead of doing their jobs/tending to the customers--at least take the customers' orders 1st, then go back to ignoring customers. While waiting for our order, I saw the same kids ignore other customers who wanted to orders. I hope this experience was a candid-camera sort of thing and/or the kids happened to be volunteers. If they were actual employees, their paychecks should've been distributed to the few workers who were actually busting their butts to get orders out for the customers. I watched this the entire time I waited.\n\nFor out of town drivers: if you're lucky, you can get street parking (metered); if not, pricier parking garage is an option. I initially put in 20min worth, but had to run back to put more money in since the wait was long.\nThe prices here (possibly a Bay Area/SF thing) are a bit pricier than usual--about a dollar more for a hamburger.\n\nWill I be back? Sadly, \"maybe\"--if I feel like having In-N-Out when I'm in the area again. I guess if this is the only In-N-Out chain for miles (which it is), you can raise your prices to however high you want & treat customers however you want if the end product is essentially the same. It has been a while since this happened, so hopefully these youngsters have either straightened up or are gone & this will be a typical In-N-Out. The lack of attentiveness ruined this experience for me. The 1.5 stars are for those few hard-workers in the back who actually tried to give a care for the customers (&/or their jobs) by pumping out their orders.", "author": "Julie K."}

Getting here was a mission, we waited an hour for the cable car and it took us another 30 minutes to ride the cable car and walk here. When we arrived there was a line going out the door and we had to wait another 30 minutes for food. The staff (even during the busy dinner rush) was EXTREMELY friendly and smiled taking every order (why can't chinese places be more like this?). Anyways we ordered the standard double cheeseburger and cheeseburger combos. They give you a number and then they shout it out through a microphone and man they are QUICK.\n\nWhen we got our combo, I looked at my friend and asked him to take a bite. I had overhyped the place like no tomorrow - I've been telling my friends in Canada how amazing the place was even before I even go the chance to go haha. Anyways, my tired friend took a bite of the burger - looked at me and said: \"Holy shit that's a good burger\". Anxious enough, I picked up my own burger and took a big bite out of it. I had never tasted anything quite like it. The meat had a CRISP to it and the cheese and onions just melt in your mouth. I couldn't lay my finger on it, ALL of the ingredients just worked together and it just culminated into one amazing burger. \n\nThe fries actually taste like real potato rather than some processed crap you get from other places and compliment the burger in every way. If you guys still don't believe this place is amazing, my friend - a small little girl that never finishes her food (Yes, we all have one of those friends) absolutely DEVOURED the burger and finished it before I did. It's not even physically possible. Anyways, I'm reviewing this place as a tourist who's never gone to in N out so if you've never got the chance to eat at in N out, get yourself a ticket to California and come here RIGHT NOW.

I'm from NYC, so I've heard a lot of people say that they are right on par, if not better than Shake shack.  I have to try for myself.\n\nTrying In-N-Out burger was one of the top 3 things I wanted to do on my trip to San Francisco.  So, I was super excited when we were finally there!  We were really lucky to find a table or we would have had to eat standing up outside somewhere.  The staff  is really nice and are super quick with their orders.  \n\nI ordered the double double animal style (in english, that's 2 patties, 2 slices of cheese with grilled onions and mustard on the pattie), friends, and a vanilla milkshake.\n\nThe wait for the food was much longer than the wait to place the orders.  We had to wait for about 10 minutes or so to get our food.  The fries were already a little bit cold when we got everything.  The burger was delicious and very juicy.  I asked for extra spread (in-n-out's special sauce, kind of like big mac sauce) and was delicious on the burger. I would definitely say in-n-out's burger is on par with shake shack, but in my opinion, shake shack still has my #1 vote.  \n\nThe fries were extremely disappointing.  I think it would have been a better choice if I ordered them well done.  They were tasteless, limp, and just kind of gross.  I would think the well done fries would be much better.  The vanilla milkshake was rich and creamy.  \n\nThe best thing about in-n-out is the price.  Everything was under $5 (if i remember correctly).  So you can get yourself a full meal for pretty much under $15.  Also, remember to look up the not-so-secret secret menu before you order!", "author": "Maggie Y."}

A Five Guys bun tastes fresh and looks like it's actually made out of bread.\n\nBurger- way too salty and also overcooked (ie dry). At Five Guys the burger still manages to taste juicy despite the fact that you have no other option than medium-well (they say it's well-done but it's almost always medium-well). \n\nToppings/Condiments- No comparison here really, Five Guys wins out by a huge margin as far as customization within these two categories. Animal style certainly made the burger taste pretty awesome but overall it didn't seem like much more than a glorified Big Mac sauce.\n\nFries- I didn't have room for fries on this visit but the animal style fries looked amazing. I'm not all that impressed by the fries at Five Guys.\n\nShakes- The chocolate shake I had here was really tasty. I don't even think Five Guys serves shakes.\n\nSo in conclusion, Five Guys wins out easily in the burger department. But for the full package deal (ie shakes, fries,etc) I would probably go with In N Out. Still, if someone were to ask where to get the best (national chain) burger, I would quickly point them to Five Guys.", "author": "Johan B."}

First and foremost, I am not fond of driving to Fisherman's Wharf because of the tourists, parking and how small this particular venue is. Trying to find a table to sit here is as interesting as finding a duck that does not have a watertight ass!!!\n\nSo....I decided to come and check it out with a friend visiting from overseas. First time in the United States and he had heard that In N Out was da bomb!!!! That's right.....bombed it in the bathroom!!!!  The food is always consistent and they have always gotten my order correctly. I am the type of person to always order the alternative such as animal style (grilled onions), protein style (no buns, just lettuce), etc......so I give them credit they pay extra attention to the orders.....\n\nI feel that after the opening of Super Duper (which by the way..they are opening in every corner like Walgreen's) the comparison is so different! The Super Duper has much more flavor, fries taste better. This particular visit for me at In N Out, the burger was really salty and the fries were cold and dry!!!!!\n\nIf you want a cheap meal, homeless people bothering you and yelling for your change, and waiting for a seat....go to In N Out. If you want a better tasting burger, a bit more expensive, and somewhat greasier to soak up the alcohol from the night before with less tourists...Super Duper!!

There was no where to sit inside, so I told them I'd go find a table outside. I spot one table available and sit down.

Maybe, but these nasty birds were crazy, I'd never has one as a pet.\n\nWhen my friends came outside with the food, I said you know maybe we should sit inside, these pigeons are giving me the crazy eye. So we couldn't find anything inside and just stayed at the first table. As we started to eat, all the pigeons brought their friends and went crazy! They were desperate for our burgers and fries and wouldn't go away. It became so annoying that more kept coming, only deformed ugly ones this time.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-02-09", "description": "In-N-Out isn't just for Southern California anymore--the chain has spread throughout the state and has outposts in Arizona, Nevada and Texas. Being East Coast-based I decided to visit an In-N-Out to see what the fuss was about, so we descended upon the sole store in San Francisco, located somewhat unsurprisingly at Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nIn-N-Out's menu is simple--burgers, fries, shakes, and drinks. Its \"secret\" menu containing such items as a \"grilled cheese\" (a burgerless cheeseburger) and \"animal style\" (special sauce and fried onions) is no longer a secret; one can find it on the official website. We went purist--a couple of burgers for my husband, a \"double double\" (two patties, two slices of cheese) for me, fries and drinks for both of us. Place your order, get your drinks, and wait for your number to be called.\n\nWe were there at lunch and had about a ten-minute wait, as the burgers do not hit the grill until your order is placed. We both thought the burgers were very good. The toppings--lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and Thousand Island dressing (onions are optional)--were fresh and still held a refrigerated chill as if the burger was put together at somebody's backyard cookout. The actual patties were thinner than I thought they would be but still tasted great, and the bun was perfect. The fries... some here have said that McDonald's are better and I would have to agree--they were very bland and starchy. The red-and-white tiles in the place are reminiscent of the East Coast (but rapidly spreading) chain Five Guys, and I remarked to my husband that if I could have an In-N-Out double-double with Five Guys fries that'd pretty much be the perfect fast-food meal. In-N-Outs are numerous enough in California now that you don't really have to seek one out, and as far as fast food goes you can do a lot worse.", "author": "Patricia B."}

In-N-Out makes it as easy as 1-2-3, literally. \n\nMcDonalds, Burger-king, Jack In the Box all have menus with over 20+ choices to order from. In addition, they contain less nutritional value and more artery clogging nutrients. In contrast, In-N-Out has a simplified menu of #1 being a Cheeseburger, #2 being a double double, and #3 your basic hamburger. In addition there is also a SECRET MENU that consists of intriguing options that adds a twist to your basic fries and cheeseburger, such as animal fries and protein style burgers. Also, it just seems healthier to eat here when compared to the other burger spots.\n\nIt essentially costs as much as the big food chain restaurants but is just as delicious. My favorite order is the double double with onions, no tomatoes with a fresh order of French Fries. The average wait is about 5-10 minutes depending on the time you eat there. The meat tastes delicious, the condiment they put on the burgers also adds a great flavor to the burger and overall makes it a great experience. If your more into trying something different, ask for animal style fries and try ordering a 3 by 3 or 4 by 4 burger. Massive amounts of cheese, buns, and patties that will fill your stomach. For better quality and  taste, eat all your food within 10 minutes, especially the Secret Menu items because they tend to decline in taste as they get colder over time. \n\nI would say the only trouble with this place is the extreme number of tourists that cram into this place, but that's business. The workers tend to be young and move efficiently and are usually friendly.

I love to bite into my juicy burger and not have that awful feeling you get when you eat at a Burger King or McDonalds. At first, I did not like the french fries; however, that takes some time getting used to. They taste like real potatoes, not the garbage at other fast food joints. One negative about the restaurant is that it can be quite messy and takes staff a while to clean up after other guests. My advice to anyone who has never been to an In-N-Out is to order a double double animal style. Animal style is not listed on the menu but you will be more than satisfied when your burger comes out! Animal style uses a mustard-cooked beef patty combined with additional pickles, cheese, spread and grilled onions on top of your already awesome burger. Absolutely delicious.", "author": "Tommy C."}

Ever. I am a burger man and this is a high honor.\n\nThe meat is juicy and salty (mmm, that could be taken wrong) and all of their ingredients are fresh and not frozen.\n\nYou even see the guys cutting the potatoes. Now, you ever seen that at any other fast food joint?\n\nI'm a double double man myself. I like their lemonade. Most places have soda (which I don't drink) but no non-carbonated options.\n\nIf you go I recommend asking them for cheese fries. It's a special order, but they'll do it.\n\nTheir shakes are freakin' awesome.\n\nI can't help but think of an outspoken friend who would claim that if you found a partner that could suck down their thick shakes that you had found a winner (PG 13 version of that story).\n\nPrice-wise: $6 gets you a burger, drink and fries. That's a damn good deal.\n\nThis In-n-out is ALWAYS crowded. Shoot, sometimes there's a line out the door (usually weekends). This place is full of tourists. Good luck finding a table. At least this one has outdoor seating. You can watch people walk into Hooters. \n\nThis in-n-out doesn't have parking or a bathroom. For parking...you're screwed.

So, SUCK IT, SAN FRANCISCO MCDONALDS IN SOMA, BECAUSE YOU COULD'VE HAD OUR BUSINESS.\n\nWe went to In-N-Out after deciding that we didn't want to go to the TL for Domino's, and since neither of us had eaten In-N-Out in months, it was worth the trek across town.\n\nThere weren't many people in line, although 98% of the tables were occupied.  A double-double for both of us, hers animal-style, and the great debate on whether or not to order a milkshake at 11 PM.  We decided on \"no.\"  Our food came out about 10 minutes later, and we finished every last bit of our burgers, even though all the innards were squishing out by the time we got to the last half.\n\nTheir burgers aren't really as good as I remember them; did they shrink?  In my opinion, they're not any different from McD's Big 'n Tasty burger.  But oh well, it was attainable at that hour, and the fries were halfway decent (we both were big-time McD's french fry fans).\n\nMy favorite \"secret menu\" item is the neapolitan shake: chocolate, vanilla and strawberry goodness all layered on top of each other in their signature palm-tree-printed cup.  Separately I'm not a fan of shakes, but together, they just make magic in my mouth.  Shazam.\n\nOverall, this place is clean, albeit touristy.  Parking after 11 is easy, because the weird meters go off (seriously, who installed those?) and there aren't as many people around.\n\nOh, and this sounds completely trivial, but they have really good pink lemonade.  Not as good as their neapolitan shake though.", "author": "Tori S."}

My wife and the youngest will stake out the dining area, and when a table opens up, they pounce on it. Worked out well, even though my youngest and my butts shared a single seat. \n\nI was expecting a long wait for our food, but surprisingly, our order came out relatively quick. \n\nThe older girls each ordered a cheeseburger, dirty fries (fries topped with melted cheese, grilled onions, and their secret burger sauce), and a vanilla milk shake. \n\nThe youngest just wanted a chocolate shake and fries. \n\nFood?

I'm not proud of it, but I figure it's time I come clean and face this problem head on like a man.  Thinking back, I guess I would say it all started when I was 13 years old.  You know, that's a very impressionable age, and I just wanted to be a part of the in-crowd.  I didn't enjoy doing it and I really didn't enjoy doing it with my friends.  I just wanted to fit in.  If I close my eyes and listen very carefully, I can still hear them talking to me: \n\n\"You gotta try this!\" \n\"It's amazing!\"  \n\"Everyone is hitting it up after school, you have to do this with us!\"\n\nAs I got older, things didn't change.  I was still living a lie, and every time I felt that peer pressure, I would give in to it.  Not anymore.  No sir...today Ray Bautista takes his life back and stops selling out.  TODAY, Ray Bautista is finally ready to admit that IN-N-OUT BURGER IS EXTREMELY OVERRATED! Seriously, it's sooooooo AVERAGE!  Ahh, that felt great.  All these years of living a lie and I finally feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.  I know, I know, I'm from California.  Even just having these thoughts about In-N-Out is blasphemous, but what can I say, I'm a rebel.  Like James Dean, minus the cool hair, money, fame and good looks.\n\nSo why do I think it's so average you ask?  Peep it.\n\nFor starters, how about the taste?  Can any of you reading this review honestly say that there is a unique taste to their burgers or fries?  Seriously, I'm pretty sure I can make burgers and fries that taste just like this at my house (for those of you that doubt me, I got my Iron Chef hat ready for battle).  As much shit as my friends give big name fast food chains like McDonalds and Burger King, you all have to admit that there really is a distinct taste (even smell) to these franchises' food items.  I really don't believe that In-N-Out has these qualities in their food, but then again my palette is used to the finer things in life. And by finer things, I mean a Sourdough Jack meal from Jack In The Box at 3am in the morning.\n\nI know, I get it.  In-N-Out is synonymous with California and it's an easy, cheap place to bring your out-of-town guests too.  A majority of the time, your guests / friends will probably ask if you can take them there because they've heard so much about it.   Plus, who doesn't enjoy looking all hip and cool in front of an In-N-Out virgin by using that crazy In-N-Out slang while ordering, \"Yes, I'll have one Double Double, a 4x4, Animal Style with extra fry sauce please.\"  Yeah, I'm guilty of it just like everyone else, BUT all of this (including the secret menu) doesn't make the food taste any better.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are things about In-N-Out that I really, really like.  I don't think anyone can deny that their milkshakes are AMAZING. I gotta give them a lot of love for this.  The consistency is always perfect and the flavors are always dope.  If you've never had one, then you suck, and you should go get one right now!  I'd recommend getting either the Strawberry or Vanilla flavors for all those n00bs out there reading this review.  As Ray-Ray from 10 years ago would say, \"That shizzle is the bomb yo!\"\n\nAlso, In-N-Out's prices are pretty awesome.  You get a good amount of food for the price that you're paying and in my book, that's always a good thing.  I also like the look and layout of the restaurant.  Atmosphere is always important to me, and I have to say that In-N-Out got this right.\n\nThat's all folks!  That was my roller coaster ride review of In-N-Out Burger.  I hated some things, I loved some things, but the most important thing...I cared.  That's right fuckers, I cared enough to review In-N-Out Burger to begin with.  In the world of Yelp, that means a lot.  So in closing, I would just like to say that In-N-Out's burgers and fries are still SUPER AVERAGE.\n\nIn other words, stick to animal style condoms, not burgers.", "author": "Ray-Ray B."}

Thankfully I did do so, and am glad I did.\n\nI really enjoyed the menu's simplicity. Instead of 50 different menu options that people always take an eternity to pore over, it offers the following:\n\nBurger\nCheeseburger\nFries\nDrink\n\nWhat a breath of fresh air.\n\nI got the cheeseburger and it was really fantastic. Just the right size (not too small, but not ginormous either) and very tasty. As a point of reference, here's how I'd rank the burgers of several large fast food chains, from best to worst:\n\n1. In-N-Out\n2. Wendy's\n3. Jack In The Box\n4. Burger King\n5. McDonald's\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I did not, in fact, manage to get in and out. There were long lines, a huge amount of people milling around waiting for their numbers to be called to pick up their food, and all of the tables were taken (I had to wait around for a bit for someone to leave before I could sit down). But these are just side distractions and I can't complain about the food one bit. Very glad I dropped into this elusive California family-owned chain.", "author": "Chelsea R."}

Trying to figure out what was up, I nibbled on the fries, and stared @ its inside like a monkey with a new tool. Cold and under-fried must have been it. The double-double cheeseburger was supposed to be juicy, but wasn't. How long the patty sat unattended before the juices evaporated was beyond my knowledge. Perhaps the patty could have been flipped over one too many times while on the grill, but I'm just starting to speculate.\n\nBeing crowded here is nothing new, the service is fairly quick relative to the volume of orders (potential cause of the problems above). No restroom? That's new, but there's a Hooters @ the next stop over.\n\nIt's nice being an outlier, but not on the poor end of the spectrum.

Fast food burgers to me are from McDonald's, Wendy's or Burger King, burgers I generally try to avoid.  When I visited San Francisco December '09, I made it my personal mission to visit In-N-Out.  I decided on the double double with fries and a drink.  The burgers were made to order, since there was a bit of a wait for fast food.  The wait was not a big deal, since I knew the burger was going to be good.  Plus, the place was crowded and the diners looked happy eating.\n\nI took my food back to my hotel room, so I can enjoy my burger privately.  My companion was with me and he forgot to order fries.  Don't worry, I was a good girl and shared my fries.  \n\nBack at the hotel room, the fun started.  I took the first bite of my double double (after taking a picture and sending it to my jealous cousin who loves In-N-Out, but also lives on the east coast) and was in an euphoric trance.  I described every bite as I made my way down the burger.  The cheese was perfectly melted and bun toasted just right.  My companion swore I was making love to my double double.  Suffice it to say, I had a good time devouring my burger.  As for the fries, they were perfect: partly soggy and partly crispy (I like soggy fries. Don't judge me). \n\nI'm glad In-N-Out is only on the west coast.  Because if one ever emerges in New York City, I'd be overweight.", "author": "Jenn C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-01-27", "description": "In-N-Out Burger is a cultural phenomenon. Anywhere you go in North America (and most of the civilized world) people have heard about California's little burger stand that could. The unique thing about this chain is that they are not franchised. Every store is owned by the Snyder family who started the business way back in 1947 in the sleepy Los Angeles suburb of Baldwin Park. So it takes a lot longer to grow a corporate chain rather than a franchised one. Don't expect In-N-Out to open a store in the Northwest anytime soon, though they say they will make it up here eventually. \n\nThe Fisherman's Wharf location is San Francisco's only one, and can be quite busy as it feeds the city folk as well as throngs of tourists dying to get their hands on the most coveted burger in America. The location is spiffier than most, and is the second nicest location I've seen after Westwood. Oddly enough their is no bathrooms so I had to walk a few blocks to find a place to wash my hands afterward.

Their service & food are always uniformly good. \n\nUnlike other chains like Mc Donald's & Burger King, In-N-Out's pricing is simple & consistent -- not higher in touristy locations. \n\nThe whole operation is simplicity itself. They have a very limited number of items to choose from, but they make them fresh & as good as they can. The fries are cut fresh from whole potatoes on site. The burger meat is mushed on location. \n\nThe employees are clean-cut & friendly. I have yet to encounter a bad customer service experience at any In-N-Out. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for any other chain. They send out a person w/ a towel to wipe things down & pick up trays regularly. They also pay the employees better than usual starting pay.\n\nThey do have a quirky less noticed aspect to them. They are owned & operated by the Snyder family, who hold strong religious beliefs & thusly have Biblical scriptures discretely printed on the bottoms of their cups, wrappers &replicas. They also are against any \"modern\" clothing closures--meaning no zippers, velcro, or snaps. You'll notice that they even use a giant bobby pin the secure their aprons instead of tying them.\n\nAs w/ every In-N-Out location I've visited, they have a self-service drink fountain. Their lemonade is made w/ real lemons (which you can add yourself). This location shares a common restroom in the complex.\n\nSanta's Yelper sez: \"Great fries, good burgers, great service!

Just when I thought that messy fast-food fries and cheeseburgers were losing some of their respect and popularity in the more modern, health-centric market I had to find my way into an In-N-Out Burger! In preparation for my April trip to San Francisco I was given many tips and recommendations for my vacation and, to my surprise, a fellow oenophile gave me very specific instructions to find such a location and to order and to order \"a double double, animal-style with fries, animal-style.\" After going online to research this odd order I realized that he was taking advantage of the not-too-\"secret menu\" that is known only to In-N-Out lovers who are privy to the list of offerings that are not displayed on the official restaurant menu.\n\nAfter my long up and down-hill trek to Fisherman's Wharf from Union Square I decided that I had gotten a sufficient enough workout to justify a midday snack from the fast-food mecca. I did not expect the sizable line and patiently-waiting crowd that I saw when I walked in but I was not intimidated and I immediately jumped in the queue. A friendly In-N-Out team member was taking my order before I knew it and took my order as if it were written on the menu board right above my head. The wait to get my meal was a bit longer than I am used to at most fast-food joints, but then again few of these types of restaurants near to own home get quite this busy and none really put as much care into their burgers as these guys do. I made a quick exit as soon as my number was called and rushed to devour my order. The done, yet still very juicy and flavorful, patties were perfectly  enrobed in melting cheese, the onions savoringly griddled and sweet and the sauces excellently proportioned to the fillings and toasted bun.\n\nA couple of days later, on my last whole day in San Francisco, I took on the long walk back to In-N-Out and indulged (just because I can, and because we do not have these locations on the east coast) in the 3x3, animal style with the same fries. Wow. Meaty deliciousness for way less than you would pay for an equally-sized, rich cheeseburger at any nicer establishment.

Just tell the In-N-Out Burger cashier how many meat patties and how much cheese you want and that is what you'll get! For instance, if you want 4 pieces of meat and 3 pieces of cheese tell them you want a \"4-by-3.\"\n\n\"Double Meat\" = like a Double Double without cheese.\n\n\"3 by Meat\" = three meat patties and no cheese.\n\n\"Animal Style\" = the meat is cooked and fried with mustard and then pickles are added, extra spread and grilled onions are added.\n\n\"Animal Style Fries\" = fries with cheese, spread, grilled onions and pickles (if you ask for them).\n\n\"Protein Style\" = for all you low-carbohydrate dieters, this is a burger with no bun (wrapped in lettuce).\n\n\"Flying Dutchman\" = two meat patties, two slices of melted cheese and nothing else - not even a bun!\n\nFries \"Well-Done\" = extra crispy fries . . . even better than the regular!\n\nFries \"Light\" = opposite of fries well-done, more raw than most people like 'em\n\n\"Grilled Cheese\" = no meat, just melted cheese, tomato, lettuce and spread on a bun.\n\n\"Veggie Burger\" = burger without the patty or cheese. Sometimes we call this the \"Wish Burger.\"\n\n\"Neapolitan\" Shake = strawberry, vanilla and chocolate mixed together.\n\nThe friendly employees of In-N-Out Burger will take your special order without question, if you use the right terminology.

I'd always assumed In And Out to be similar to the many regional fast food chains from my own life experience--White Castle, Hardee's, Little Tavern, etc.  I expected In And Out to be just total shit and practically unedible swill, so I just never went to one (the location in the Wharf made this especially easy!)  Then, one night at a party at Station 40 I was talking with someone and somehow In And Out burger came up...\n\nWell, does it even need to be said that I couldn't wait to try it?  Secret Menu!  Living wage and benefits for employees!  Crossed Palm tree things at most locations!  Cryptic hidden bible verses on cups!  I absolutely had to go to In and Out, but first I checked out the secret menu on their website so I could be prepared.  It's there I learned that In and Out has a commitment to fresh, quality ingredients, and that's why they're only in Southern California (and a few up here...)  I was down.\n\nOn my first visit to In And Out, I prepared myself, walked up the the register and said \"Hi, I've never been to In And Out before.\"  The cashier gets this discernably quizzical look on her face, yet, a look of recognition, and says. \"okay...\"  I proceed to order a Grilled Cheese, animal style, Animal Fries and a shake.  When she asks what kind of shake I would like, I kind of nerdily hold up a finger, and with what surely must have been a twinkle in my eye, replied \"Neopolitan.\"  I confirmed with her that nothing I ordered had any meat in it, took my number, and sat down and waited.\n\nThis great thing happened while I was waiting.  This really tall, lanky black thug dude in one of those oversized white t-shirts (a thug style which started out in BALTIMORE!!!) gets his order filled, snatches it out of the employee's hands and leaves the restaurant yelling \"ANIMAL STYYYYYLE... MUTHA FUCKIN' ANIMAAAAAL STYYYYLE!\" while pounding his chest with his fist.  I knew, right then, that I had come to the right place.\n\nAfter about ten minutes or so, my order is ready.  And tasty it was!  Super good, the animal fries were really amazing, perfectly and delecately flavored and, I found out at the end, made with real, fresh potatoes.  The grilled cheese animal style was great, a toasty bun, melty cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and that thousand island-ish sauce with grilled onions, absolutely perfect.\n\nThen, this second really great thing happened.  I was siting in my cab on Jefferson there, eating my In and Out, and a radio call came in around the corner for Gary Danko Restaurant.  I jammed up Hyde street, pile of fries in my lap, and stopped in front.  As the host came out to let me know the table was paying their bill and would be out momentarily, she commented \"boy, it sure does smell good in here...\" and I was all \"hey I just got some In And Out, first time ever... You want some?\"  Her face lights up, and she's like \"oh yeah, we all love that place!\"  Soon two of the waitstaff are leaning in the side of my cab helping me scarf down the fries.  The irony here is that Danko is one of THE MOST exclusive restaurants in the city, with dinner for two costing like over $200, and here is the staff clamoring over some fries from In And Out and saying how delicious they are.  \n\nThese are the moments that make life worth living.", "author": "Ben V."}

Call it hormonal rage, call it pre-holiday meltdown, call it just feeling particularly snippy; no matter what you call it, I wasn't in the greatest of moods. Of course, when you're feeling like this, it's a fantastic time for the perfected simplicity of In-N-Out. Nothing better than adding to feeling cranky, run down and chunky then eating a burger and fries! Seriously, my tastebuds alert my endorphines, who kick in and beat the concept of calories out of my head.\n\nYes, we in CA are spoiled by many many exclusives and In-N-Out, I'm sure is in the top hundred list of the majority of Californians. Still if you are from the Bay Area, you can recall that this chain didn't come to the bay until the late '90's. Yep even fellow Californians were deprived! But then again that's what road trips are for (that and buying shakes to drink with the windows down and the heater up--oh wait that might be just me).\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the In-N- Out chain, the menu is simple. Hamburgers, cheeseburgers and the infamous Double Doubles (double meat, double cheese). They come with lettuce, tomatoes, thousand Island and onions. You can request grilled onions and pickles at no extra cost but of course, if you are \"In-N-Out virgin\" (heh heh-sorry love a good double entendre) the way to go is to go \"Animal Style\". I'm not even gonna go into what animal style entails but trust me, your friends at home will be impressed when you told them. If you like your burgers with no fuss but are still curious to try animal style you can get your fries that way instead. Feel a little better about the reckless abandonment of your waistline by knowing your food was cooked in vegetable oil.    \n\nThis location has its pros and cons. There is no drive through and its in Fisherman's Wharf area next to Hooters. It is as busy as pretty much any other In-N-Out but instead of an assortment of locals, there is a healthy representation of tourists and homeless. Still it's also one of the only places in the wharf area where you can lunch for around $5 and the quality is par with many other In-N-Out across the state. If you know your In-N-Out at all, you know you're happily paying for a place with standards and damn it, if you don't have standards why are you reading a review in the first place???  \n\n(The burger and fries are gone now.

I personally don't care what you're laughing about but if your order is taking longer that usual and the customer behind you who orders more than what you ordered it and display unprofessional behaviour while I wait is a unacceptable in my view. To add on top of that, to get an order of animal style fries spilled over just only fuels a customers patience. I was not impressed with the workflow and productivity with the amount of employees working with having customers working. I've seen employees working harder in the millbrae and daly city branch work harder and show better professionalism than what I've seen.

I do have a couple complaints though...\n\nDespite INO's massive popularity, which assures that there's going to be a wait at almost any time of day, most of their locations handle the onslaught pretty well. This location seems to be lagging though... even when it's a quiet, mid-week night around 10:30PM. This puzzles me, because I specifically visit during such hours to avoid the monumental lines.\n\nI also don't like the lack of an on-site bathroom here. There's a common bathroom across the courtyard, but it's locked (and surprisingly unclean in spite of being locked). Plus, having to hassle one of the counter people for a token can be difficult to do in light of their attentiveness to the customers placing their orders. \n\nOh well.

They alter the stickers to read \"In-N-Out URGE.\" (Meanwhile, the family that owns the chain is devoutly Christian, so they stamp Bible verses on the containers.) It's family-owned. The \"secret menu\" has more things on it than the real menu - which is really just hamburger, cheesburger, double cheeseburger (Double Double), fries, sodas, and shakes. Even though it's fresher and tastier than major chain fast food, it's cheaper. So there's a mystique to the place, but it's for a reason (or two).\r\n\r\nNow when I lived in LA, I was really more a fan of Fatburger, but I'm glad that there's an In-N-Out on the Wharf. Tourists like it, and I like it when tourists are at the Wharf, because that means they're spending money and they're not in my neighborhood.

By the time the eastcoaster gets around to eating the burger, the expectations are on a mythic scale. But I digress...\n\nThe reason that I am now an In N Out fanatic is due in large part to their efficiency. Every day during lunch, they have a line out the door and yet they still seem to power through the thing in a matter of minutes. Also, the prices at In N Out are comparable to other fast food places...yet it is 10x the delicious. On the east coast, our most famous burger spot is called \"Five Guys.\" It is also pretty damn tasty but it takes forever to get your food. This is a big deal to me.\n\nIn N Out burger loses 1 star due to lack of bacon. Bacon is incredible and is certainly worthy of its own star.\n\nOh and as for the fries, I still agree that Mcdonalds has better fries but YOU HAVE TO ORDER YOUR IN N OUT FRIES WELL DONE!!!", "author": "N S."}

So, naturally, I made my way down to the Great Tourist Region to dine at the city's only INOB (enjoy the acronym while it lasts---Apple will be trademarking it when they release their new, Internet-enabled vibrator in Q2 2008).\n\nDisappointment, thy name is crappy cheeseburger served with Ore-Ida french fries.  I am willing to entertain the notion that my INOB experience was not the norm given that the place was crowded with frat boys with barb-wire arm tattoos going chest bumps and calling each other \"bra.\"  But, honestly, what audience was a fast-food burger joint expecting?  Admittedly, I did not order from the \"secret\" menu because, as a good, quiet Episcopalian boy from the mountain states, I am not in the Bible-belt initiated inner sanctum\nsan(c)torum which runs INOB (motto: free misleading Bible verse with every meal purchase!  Whether you want it or not!)\n\nBut, all that aside, shouldn't this most honored of burger joints (Hail INOB, full of grace, blessed among burger joints...) deliver the goods when you order the cheeseburger and fries?  Isn't that the slow-pitch watermelon ball of the fast-food set, ready for the beer-league clean-up hitter to knock out of the park thus securing a win for the home team?  And yet, like mightly Casey, INOB struck out, delivering a generic, greasy meat-assemblage with fries that I could swear I've seen in the freezer section at Cala.\n\nBTW, house cut fries?  BFD.  Let me drop a little Todd Barry on you: what's this in my drink?  House frozen water?  Wow, I thought they out-sourced that to India, where child laborers froze the water for pennies an hour.  I am so pleased to hear that all the ice here was frozen on the premises.\n\nSee you at Pearl Burger.  Frat boys need not apply.", "author": "Ben P."}

The number one priority for my East Coast visitors is never to see the marvelous masterpieces at the Museum of Modern Art or beautiful landscape of Golden Gate Park but rather first to grab a burger at In-N-Out Burger. Museums, landscapes, cable cars, I mean who cares about that crap?   It only cuts into eating time, and we have a schedule to keep.   \n\nI had a visitor arrive from Framingham, MA last night and took him to Marnee Thai for a solid meal.  When it came to dessert, my friend, let's call him Larry H., declined on dessert, and I had the look of shock on my face.   We did order two chicken dishes and shared a soup but I knew this friend was not full.  I knew the he was up to something so I declined dessert as well. \n\nAs we left the restaurant, Larry H. said, \"You still hungry?  How about In-N-Out Burger?\" I knew that Larry H. had a plan when he declined dessert at Marnee Thai, and as expected, he came through with a great game time decision.   Who needs to have coconut ice cream or a fried banana dessert, when In-N-Out burger was still on the table as an option? \n\nI'm a huge fan of In-N-Out Burger.  Leaving a little room after the meal at Marnee Thai, we had a burger apiece.   The inside of the burger bun is perfectly toasted, and the meat is flavorful.  For around $2, you can try a burger while strolling around Fisherman's Wharf, or as in our case, instead of ordering a dessert at your local restaurant, you can drive a few miles out of the way and grab a more filling hamburger dessert.", "author": "Josh K."}

There is a lot of hype that surrounds this chain and I think the brand has more to do with California than it does with being a quality food chain. In fact, eating here almost seems like a novice foody- move but heck- I'm from NYC, I was really eating it to see if it could compare to Shake Shack.\n\nSo I had a cheeseburger and cheese fries animal style. I really can't explain animal style except it has a whole lot of stuff on it including onions and more in & out secret sauce. I think most people outside of CA would never know of this except I dine w/ native CA-ers and I do as natives do when I'm out of town. \n\nOverall the burger is quite salty. I last had in & out about a year ago in SoCal and thought maybe it might be unique to the location however it wasn't- its just usually a salty burger. I think the sauce (I'd consider it a jazzed up thousand island dressing) does have an advantage over NY's Shake Shack sauce but it doesn't enhance the mediocre patty and bun or the hand cut fries.\n\nI guess I'd go back regardless because I do enjoy burgers so much and it's become more about the In & Out experience rather than just the food (if that means anything to any of you guys out there.)\n\nOn a side note- when I saw the employees make my burger, 1 of the employees didn't use a glove but another did- in fact, I saw this a lot in SF.

Since our hotel was right around the corner we decided to give it a try. If you don't like to think much about what to order, you'll appreciate their menu, which offers very little. I ordered a hamburger and fries. Given their name and the small number of patrons I was a little surprised at how long it took to get our simple order. When I got my burger I was underwhelmed. It's about as basic as a burger can be and really wasn't special. The only thing I noticed was the abundance of lettuce and lack of meat. The fries were average as well.

The Fisherman's Wharf location of course is ungodly crowded, packed with typical tourists and perhaps a handful of locals too in search of the state's perfected fast food cheeseburger.\n\nAfter wading through the throngs of hungry masses with my amigos, I secured my holy Double-Double. We promptly went outside, and chowed down on this greasy goodness. If I were to compare it to McDonald's or Wendy's, I would suggest that this burger has a higher quality of preparation and overall taste. It wasn't sloppily thrown together although it was still slightly messy with it's gooey cheese. Nonetheless, it had a far superior bun and toppings in contrast to the junk which populates your other typical fast food chains. Not to mention two solid beef patties to round off the whole finished product. Couple it with some decent animal fries and you've got yourself a near perfect meal right there on the otherwise boring wharf. \n\nDon't go in expecting lots of variety, the menu is sparse for a reason. This place makes burgers fast, cheap, and delicious. Simple business rhetoric. \n\nIt's not a culinary achievement to mankind, it is however the best fast food burger I've sampled and furthermore, a welcomed treat to any visitor in beautiful San Francisco. I would happily love to see this chain on the East Coast, but then it would probably lose it's quality ingredients and turn into McDonald's.\n\nSo to California and it's beloved In-N-Out restaurants, I say godspeed, I look forward to dining at you once again.", "author": "Blayze O."}

There we were, hurtling down the freeway at 90 miles per hour, sweltering even with the airconditioning on, about two miles from Las Vegas. We were on our way home to the bay, after two years in Chicago, toting along our dearest worldly possesions (including a cooler of pickles, but that's another story).\nThat's when it happened: I saw the bright red sign and yellow arrow, and swerved so fast to reach the exit that I nearly killed myself, the husband, and the hapless soul in the car next to me. But aside from some burning rubber, we all lived to tell the tale. \nIf I seem a tad overexcited here, please try to understand. I had been deprived of the joy of In-n-Out for two whole years. Go put that in your pipe, smoke it for an hour and think how you'd feel.\nSo, what does a person like me, a true blue vegetarian, go sniffing around this burger heaven, you might wonder. Well, funny you should ask. I just stand in line with all the other sunny people in striped shirts (or sit in my car, stew at the wait, and bark my order into the little red box when I'm feeling less social) and when it's my turn, order what happens to be the best grilled cheese sandwich, EVER. Animal style too, ironically enough. With some fries, if such is my pleasure. But mostly just with a neapolitan shake. (There may be greater joys than shifting your straw around to slurp down alternating sips of vanilla, strawberry and chocolate, but I don't know many.)\nAnd if the mix of grilled bun, gooey cheese, sauteed onions and crunchy pickle doesn't do it for ya, go ahead and order the meat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-02-02", "description": "This place brings to memory an old expression that was once coined by Yogi Berra : \"The place is so bad that EVERYBODY goes there!\".\r\n\r\nI had a client up in the wharf until about a year ago, and I migrated over to In-And-Out every chance I got.  It's without question the best deal going for lunch on the wharf. Hordes of  out-of-towners seem to key in on this, as the medium sized facility is usually deluged with a mob of customers the moment the clock strikes noon.\r\n\r\nEvery time the lunch bell rang, I'd get the \"In and Out urge\".  But too many times I'd walk over there, view the teeming mass of humanity crammed into the place, and just decided not to deal with the hassle.  It goes something like this: First off, you order and you're given a number.  They announce what number they're serving over PA system and the number is usually 20 to 30 below the number you've just been given. Worse yet, they usually call the numbers out of sequence.  As a general rule, check with staff to see if you've been lost in the shuffle if the current number-being-served goes 10 over the one on your receipt.  The wait can be awhile, but it gives you time to compete in the guerrilla-warfare-like shell game of staking out a seat.  Pace the floor, stalk out someone about to finish, and grab their seat the second they vacate, as open tables at this location have a half-life shorter than that of snowflakes on a red-hot skillet.  Reserve your  table with a backpack or a jacket when your number comes up, and Lo, dread the process of serve-yourself soft drinks.  Getting to the taps can be like fighting your way to the front of the stage at a stadium concert...on the other hand, never order a soft drink size other than small....I've snarfed refills every time I've been there, and nobody has given me a single iota of flak.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the crowds, check the place out before 11:30 am, or during the dank winter months where the Wharf is slow. If you're in the hood, stop by, size up the crowd, and decide if it's worth the hassle.  If it looks crazy, try the burger at Fiddlers Green on the other side of Columbus St.  A couple bucks more gets you a half pound burger, the option of a beer with your chow, and a complete lack of hassle finding a seat.  My 2 cents....", "author": "Mike W."}

So, now, I order 1 burger Animal Style and 1 with just Meat, Cheese, Bun and Raw Onion.  The \"plain\" cheeseburger is so good and in it's most simplest and tastiest form.

After a long time dishing all the hoopla, they finally opened in San Francisco and the hype was all true. I can't say its any one thing, but man it speaks volumes about the way they do everything.   After hearing applause for the burgers at this small and independent chain, family owned since beginning, I was thrilled when they decided to open a location in San Francisco, and then dismayed that they chose Fisherman's Wharf where so few locals want to go because of traffic, congestion and the effort getting to and from that no man's land within our 49 square miles.\n\nThe meat is good and cooked just right, the bun is great and also lightly toasted. The sauce is tasty and applied in the perfect amount, the produce is fresh, the staff so pleasant and helpful it's almost sinful. And the place is clean and civilized although over run by hungry throngs of tourists who flock to Fisherman's Wharf where this chain that is so much better than any chain I've ever supported in the past. Consistency is an art form, and they have it married to style and functionality and produce great burgers that put almost every chain burger to shame.  The menu is really just a couple versions of their outstanding burger and fries, but damn those burgers are good.  Each burger is cooked to order and all in front of the customer so there are no secrets.  They use top notch ingredients and supplies and it shows in taste and quality and the huge number of devoted, repeat customers.

Went around the block once and ended up with a spot right in front of the In & Out that still had time left...karma baby.

I'm not a big fan of the fries, so I spend the money on two cheeseburgers and a small soda rather than the combo.  The bathrooms operate on tokens, so I suppose you could take a couple of tokens in case you're ever in the area and need to use the facilities there as it's rather hard to find a public toilet.", "author": "Thomas C."}

Sure, you'll have to elbow your way through a lot of tourists to get here, but bring a magazine in the early evening, enjoy an iconic In-N-Out combo meal, people watch out the window, and then walk along the shore toward Fort Mason as the sun sets behind the GG Bridge ahead of you and the Ghirardelli sign lights up to your left.  And what the heck, now that it's dark, why not hop on the trolley and let the blinking light of the Alcatraz lighthouse guide you up over the hill to Union Square?

I ordered a double double, expecting it to taste super meaty and cheesy, and boy, was I wrong. The meat has no taste, and the pink sauce (thousand island dressing) and tomatoes overpower the taste of anything else. It looks wayyy better than it tastes, that's for sure.

I don't care what the other critics on Yelp say, In-N Out is awesome. Their fries are not just fries, they are not greasy or frozen like every other chain. I've seen them peel the potatoes themselves! The burgers are not just everyday burgers these are some of the best burgers you'll find anywhere. Californians love this place because they don't sell out to anyone. They are privately owned and have been forever. They don't branch out of Cali unless it's Las Vegas and that's what makes them awesome. No matter which In-N-Out you go to they are always full of people so stop complaining about the line. They don't have a large variety and that's awesome. 3 combos is all you need. Whenever I go to California I always eat here as much as possible. You guys are idiots if you think any CHAIN restaurant has better burgers than this. Jack in the Box, Burger King, McDonalds, nothing compares to In-N-Out. Sure you'll find better burgers at sticky burger joints, but this is a CHAIN of restaurants and they represent California so yay for them.", "author": "Clara M."}
