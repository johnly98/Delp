Yes - there aren't a whole lotta places using liquid nitrogen to freeze up a batch of creamy goodness.\n\nSo why the 3 stars? Limited tasting options - you only get tasters of batches that are already made. Also the reason why they have limited flavors (about 5). A small gives you two scoops, but you can't mix and match flavors...that's no fun. For me, these are some of the key reasons why I love going to get ice cream in the first place soo it's a little bit of a buzz kill when I can't have my fun (Mainly because I'm just super indecisive.).\n\nGreat ice cream, but for a $5.25 small and these other tid bits I'll probably choose to go elsewhere 95% of the time.", "author": "Allie L."}

But it turned out to be so good. \nI wasn't sure what flavor to get, I was torn between Mint Chocolate Chip and a Bourbon Peach  flavor. \n \nWas super happy with customer service when they noticed my dilemma and fixed it by offering a sample of each flavor! The texture of the ice cream had lighter feel and the flavor was very outstanding.  \nI ended up going with the Mint Chip flavor only because I'm not a big fan of caramel and the peach bourbon flavor had a hint of caramel and it was too sweet for me. That hint of liquor though was a real treat and tasted very good.\nMy friend got the chocolate chip cookie dough with prezels mixed in and I regretted not getting that..! The mint chip was good but not as good as chocolate cookie dough .  \nAll in all I tried 3 flavors and everything was super yummy. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend getting their home made waffle cone. It melts in your mouth and it isn't too hard where it scratches the top of your mouth like other cones sometimes do. The cone absorbs the ice cream and it's flavor without getting soggy and melts in your mouth. I really think the cone made the ice cream a thousand time better than it already was.\n\nA story to wrap up why customer service was also a great experience is because after 3 hours had gone by and I left the facility, I was about to board the Cal Train to go home and realized I lost my wallet.  \nLow and behold I called this ice cream store and they had it waiting for me (: just really appreciate an honest company and good people who don't take advantage of situations like the one I was in.\n\nCan't wait to come back and eat here again.

I noticed that the line to Smitten Ice Cream was long but on our walk back to the car there was no line. I thought \"this is my opportunity to find out what other people must know about this place\"!\n\nFood: oh my goodness. Ice cream made for you with fresh and local products! Total SF for you! Smitten had only 5 flavors. I was intrigued with the peaches and bourbon flavor so I tried it. A little teaspoon was good but I wasn't sure how a whole cup would be so I decided to have the mint chocolate chip. You can order 2 scoops or more. You can have it served in a cup or waffle bowl. I was sharing with my husband so we opted for a 2 scoop bowl. Trying to watch my girlish figure! :)\n\nPrice: ok, you're in SF in a trendy area. You have to know that you're going to pay a lot but it wasn't too bad. Expensive - yes. Ridiculous - no. \n\nEnvironment: Smitten is located in a refab shipping container which is very trendy and kinda cool. The shop is small with a couple of benches if you're lucky enough to find a seat. If not, there's a park across the street so you can take a walk there or find a bench.\n\nLocation: in the heart of Hayes Valley. Parking is tough but possible to find. \n\nOverall, it's a good place for fun, trendy ice cream. Given the price, I'm not going back.

Setup is pretty nice as you can see them whip up your ice cream fresh on the spot. Their menu rotates, so check their website if you're vying for a specific flavor (which still may or may not be what they're actually serving on that day).\n\nNo \"seating\" except a wooden bench-like rail running around the perimeter of the store not occupied by the counters, and no tables, but it was indoors and shaded, so not complaining about that. Staff was nice, but they were either new or super rushed or overwhelmed, because one person spilled a bunch of ice cream mix on the machine and had to wipe it all down and start over, and another guy sent all the walnuts in my order flying just as he was trying to hand it to me over the counter.

If there was any flavor of ice cream I really wouldn't go for - it's chocolate - yet there is something about the way this ice cream is made - I could totally eat a scoop of the TCHO - it was rich, not overly creamy, but brightly dark (if that even makes sense). Maybe I'd describe it more like a mild dark chocolate instead of those intense bitter ones that make you squirm. The TCHO is good stuff.

They make the ice cream in front of you with their liquid nitrogen machines, which makes their ice cream icy while creamy at the same time. I got their COOKIE DOUGH WITH PRETZELS & CHOCOLATE CHIPS. It's essentially what you want from Cold Stone, but it tastes way better! Their cookie dough is egg yolk free - there are buttery chunks of cookie dough mixed into a malted brown sugar ice cream so that the usual cookie dough texture is not present in each bite. The pretzels are chopped big enough to get a salty and crunchy texture, and the chocolate chips balance out all of these flavors with a subtle sweet flavor. This flavor is a regular of theirs, and I loved it! \n\nSince there is only wooden bench seating available here, there is no room to sit in the stand, but there are plenty of benches and tables in the surrounding park area.", "author": "Sophie P."}

Of course, I had the internal debate of which flavour to get, but recently I've been into trying the most \"out-there\"/unique thing on the menu instead of something safe/that I know I would probably like (e.g. good ol' chocolate), so I settled for chocolate passion plantain.\n\n- Chocolate passion plantain: chocolate covered plantain chips in passion fruit ice cream. Wow! The subtle fruity notes played really well with the chocolate plantain chips, and the banana-type flavour was very complementary, not overpowering at all.

They documented how Smitten came to be, and why the ice cream tastes so good (well, the \"why\" without really disclosing the real secrets!).

Although Bi-rite has more flavors to choose from in comparision, but they still had a good selection of about 5 to 6 flavors with one being the seasonal flavor of the month.

It was one of the best tasting ice creams I can remember. Who knew that you could make the perfect blend of lemon and cream without the tarty sourness but maintaining the lemon flavor. I won't mention the texture because it's in all the other reviews. My only complaint is that they should give harder spoons since mine kept bending while I was eating.\n\nI am really sad that this flavor won't be around any more, but I want to applaud Smitten for keeping their menu down to 6 flavors but focusing and doing a great job on them.", "author": "Eric Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-06-26", "description": "The ice cream is pricey and nobody likes a line. For those two reasons, Smitten is not going to be a regular ice cream spot. But I gotta say, I think it might be some of the best ice cream I have ever tasted.\nI was skeptical that that the liquid nitrogen churning process would make much of a difference in taste or texture. I assumed that that once the novelty wore off, the ice cream would taste like any other. But Smitten proved me wrong. The freshly churned ice cream was indeed super smooth and rich. \n\nThe process was interesting to watch, but I lost interest pretty quickly. I couldn't clearly see what was going on behind the smoke & mirrors. It was a very warm day and I was getting impatient. We had been in line for just a few minutes, and the line wasn't getting any shorter. In fact, I think it was multiplying. Then I realized I had nothing to complain about compared to the hard-working servers. Their hands must be freezing and they must be building some serious forearms. I don't blame them at all for the wait. Each order takes a few minutes to execute properly and there are only 3 stations. That easily creates a bottleneck, so they're doing the best they can.  \n\nI chose the TCHO chocolate. I surprised myself, because I usually like to try more interesting flavors. I surprised myself further by getting a cone, because I usually find cones a little cumbersome and messy. I think I was trying to spend all my grocery money on ice cream. Lo & behold, it was good. Expectations exceeded. Be it the smooth creamy texture, or the rich TCHO chocolate flavor, or the buttery waffle cone, or all three, it's just good.\nI've also tried Cookie Dough w/ Pretzels & Chocolate Chips, which was also pretty good, but didn't win me over quite as much. \n\nBecause of the price, I will not be making Smitten a habit. A Small is $5 and a cone is $1.25, but the small size appears to be about two scoops. If you can rationalize that it's not that much, or share it with someone, then it won't be such a daunting cost. \n\nSmitten may have the right idea, not just with the liquid nitrogen, but also with the shipping container setting. Considering the high cost of living and unrelenting population growth, we may all end up living in shipping containers one day. It's not such a stretch from a micro studio.", "author": "Joy W."}

There's a sign inside the shop that explains how Smitten's ice cream is made with liquid nitrogen and the unique patented process and machines that are used. The special part of Smitten's ice cream is that it is made fresh to order and from fresh, organic ingredients. There are no preservatives at all. The ice cream is not transported here from a different manufacturing location and it is also not stored over time so that ice develops in it and potentially changes the flavor.\n\nAt Smitten, they have four flavors for you to choose from. There are no samples available as everything is made to order but they do have a guarantee so if you don't like the flavor, you can switch out for another one. The ice cream makers pour fresh organic milk into the mixer along with any other relevant ingredients, such as fresh mint leaves for mint ice cream. I got the earl grey with milk chocolate chips! Then, the mixer is left to spin with the liquid nitrogen infusing into and freezing the ice cream mix. The result is an incredibly fresh, authentic and real tasting ice cream. The flavors are phenomenal. \n\nThe experience of Smitten is not only in tasting the ice cream but seeing it made with the liquid nitrogen as well.

After all, ice cream is always a good idea, regardless of whether you're going to eat it or write about it!\n\nAlthough I already popped my Smitten cherry at their Oakland location, I still had been wanting to try this one for quite some time.  Not only because it's their original spot, but also because Smitten was one of the first, and one of the best, \"nitro ice cream\" joints to emerge around the Bay Area.  Seriously, how could a fan not check out where the craze started?\n\nHaving already enjoyed their ice cream a couple of times now, I knew what to expect - delicious ice cream that's milky instead of icy, creamy, and offered in a handful of fun flavors on any given day.  Case in point: COOKIE DOUGH WITH PRETZELS AND CHOCOLATE CHIPS.  Not exactly a flavor you'd likely find in the Dreyers or Haagen Dazs sections of the freezer aisle (which is a shame, since it's awesome).\n\nIn a way, this particular flavor was kind of similar to the Compost Cookie from Momofuku Milk Bar in NY, using something salty (and random) to play off the sweetness (which wasn't over the top).  In addition though, the pretzels, along with the chips, added a slight crunch to the otherwise silky smooth texture (the liquid nitrogen freezes the ice cream without forming ice crystals).  Too bad there wasn't more of the cookie dough though!\n\nQuality aside, while the city's other premium ice cream spots are a little pricey as well, Smitten admittedly ranks among the highest.  Although $5 for a small isn't terrible, the portion size is relatively light compared to what you can get at other places.  Then again, there's the novelty and uniqueness of it being nitro ice cream, so it's not like you're paying for the regular sort either!\n\nAll in all, FOUR AND A HALF STARS rounded down for the value as well as the fact that the flavor I had wasn't quite as good as the Lemon Shortbread I had in Oakland, as well as the likes of Bi-Rite and Humphrey Solcombe.  At least I finally got the bitter taste out of my mouth from my first attempt at coming here.  Seriously...how could they run out of liquid nitrogen?!", "author": "Mike L."}

Everyone loves Smitten.\n\nThey definitely have the cool factor with the whole using liquid nitrogen to make their ice cream fast and fresh right in front of you. Great setup. Clouds of smoke fills the counter as it leaves the churners kind of reminding me of witches cauldrons or some mad scientist's laboratory.\n\nThe use of organic and lots of natural ingredients are always good though I'm not a big organic stuff kind of guy, natural yes, organic not so much. Or are they the same think!? Nevermind I don't know what I'm talking about.\n\nIgnoring all of the how its made and where it came from it has to come down to that product itself, the end result. I enjoyed how it's smooth and creamy as ice cream should be. And of course it does taste good. I'm a huge fan of chocolate mint anything and had to order the Fresh Mint Chip. It was good, refreshing, and packed with big real mint flavor, a liltte overwhelming, but real good. I'd get it again. I did also taste another flavor but don't really remember if it was the TCHO or Creme Fraiche it was good. You can order their ice cream as is, a float, sundae, cone, or covered in its various toppings like cookie dough, toasted almond, brown sugar/spicy caramel, etc.\n\nI'm a fan however here's why I'm not wowed. The selection of flavors seems limited to only 4 a day but I believe they'll rotate in other flavors. What if I wasn't craving any of the flavors offered for the day and got stuck with settling!? They'll make it fresh but it does seem slower than your traditional ice cream shop where they'll offer a huge variety of flavors and just scope from large batches of ice cream. Does it make a difference having a batch made an hour or two ahead of time vs right when ordered!? Another thing is their portions are small for the price. \n\nThey're good but not amazing.

I tried both, and they were both pretty good, but the Salted Caramel was definitely my preference. It's really buttery somehow, whereas the pumpkin can get kind of too sweet and sticky.\n\nI think the small size is pretty adequate since Smitten's ice cream seems all relatively sweet. Although I find the small cup at $5 to be kind of overpriced, I'll admit I'm still hoping to go back eventually to try some of their chocolate flavors because I'm sure it'll be pretty heavenly with how smooth and silky the texture of their ice cream was. :) So it IS still worth a mini-splurge.", "author": "Diane J."}

This place, when visited at the right time, has no line and I think that really has impacted my review. They only have four seasonal flavors at a time and only make a small batch a time due to the specific machine they use.\n\nFOOD: Again, to do the comparison, Tcho Chocolate with Almonds. This time, I found myself enjoying the ice cream more. The way the Liquid N2 works is that at a colder temperature, the crystals that form are smaller than the crystals that we are normally used to. This creates a really smooth texture in the ice cream that cannot be matched by any store bought ice cream. In addition, the quality of ingredient is mighty good. The creaminess of the ice cream itself is what sells the ice cream. One scoop in the mouth coats the tongue in a way that normal ice cream cannot. \n\nSERVICE: Not bad and pretty attentive to other customers. \n\nI wish the offerings in the flavors were a bit more varied as they seem to not be as \"out there\" as I would like.

Smitten is one of them. Comparing it to other liquid nitrogen places I've tried -- Ice Cream Lab (Beverly Hills), Chocolate Chair in (Koreatown LA), + Scoop Microcreamery (Palo Alto) -- Smitten the best of the best. Or should I say cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. \n\nServing the goods out of a tiny shack (converted boxcar?) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smitten-ice-cream-san-francisco-3?select=UjuvqzjT9MDYA6G07DnTUg on a lot in Hayes Valley, this little shop is a favorite dessert spot of mine after lunch or dinner in the area... or when I just feel like having dessert for dinner to soothe my soul after a rough day. The menu http://smittenicecream.com/menu/ is limited to 4 flavors, but 3 of them change frequently with TCHO 60.5% Chocolate http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_eYOcA9ghJ7MlXcJQj8--w&userid=6YEnpx-qloIfFX-L9uyfbQ as the anchor. \n\nA Small will set you back $5, a Regular is $6, and a Pint is $11. \nSeasonal flavors are an extra $0.50. \nCones are an extra $1.25. \nAdditional sauces or chunks are $0.75 each. \n\nI'd actually recommend trying the ice cream alone in its purest form if it's your first time going. Why? Well, other than the novelty of watching the magical unfurling of the fog http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ggkYGunBn3zgCKBNP-GguA&userid=6YEnpx-qloIfFX-L9uyfbQ when they make the ice cream, what makes liquid nitrogen special is the texture. It's sooooo smooth! And because it's prepared right in front of you, it will always be served the perfect temperature + texture... not sitting in a freezer for days. This explains the $5+ price tag as well.\n\nIf you're going with a group, the best bang for your buck is actually the 4-flavor flight http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=AXZJVnJXFLav646fLPzEXg&userid=6YEnpx-qloIfFX-L9uyfbQ, which gives you 4 munchin-sized scoops for $10.50. On this particular visit, that meant getting Strawberry White Balsamic, Salted Caramel, Cookie Dough + TCHO 60.5% Chocolate. The Cookie Dough was the fan favorite followed by the Salted Caramel. \n\nMy personal favorite flavor though is actually the Fresh Mint Chip http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=E5stmtAMqJOhUlCBeLKRSg&userid=6YEnpx-qloIfFX-L9uyfbQ because of how beautifully aromatic on the tongue the fresh mint is. This flavor basically ruined the classic sugary grocery-store version of mint chip for me because it's just that good! \n\nHighly recommend making a stop here if you're ever in the area. Yes, there is likely to be a line if you're going on a weekend since everything is made to order, but it's worth the wait. And once you've got your little scoop of joy, there's Patricia Green Park right next door to people watch or view the periodically-changing art installation.", "author": "Janelle Q."}

For me it was not interesting in a great way but I can see other people loving it.\n\nThe flavors are extremely authentic. For example, I ordered the mint chip ice cream and expected the flavor to be something like your average mint chocolate chip. But no, this mint tasted like REAL mint - think mint leaves or the mint taste you get in mohitos. I didn't realize how fake the mint ice cream I had been eating was until I had this ice cream. I also tried the nectarines and cream ice cream. No sweetened fruit flavor here. It actually tasted like a nectarine - a not quite ripe, slightly bitter nectarine to be precise.\n\nSome people will absolutely love the authenticity of the flavors. I thought I would too. But honestly, I think I prefer the traditional ice cream flavors that have more sugar. I would rather have the less-real-mint chocolate chip ice cream and a sweeter nectarine ice cream.

Despite burning a liquid nitrogen hole in my wallet, Smitten ice cream really is distinctly smooth and noticeably fresh--I wonder if this is what ice cream in heaven is like. \n\nI tried the classic vanilla, which was simple and allowed for mindful eating of artisan small-batch ice cream, if that is such a thing. If you think hard enough, you can almost taste the excellent quality of the ingredients. The creaminess was superb, though I did find it too sweet. The sweetness was balanced out with the oatmeal cookie crumble (which I suspect was snickerdoodle since it was very cinnamony and lacked oatmeal), only to resume with the very sweet caramelized waffle cone. \n\n$5 for the small scoop is not terrible, since you get two small scoops; however the extras add up fast, as my $1.25 waffle cone and $0.75 cookie crumble escalated the afternoon snack to the price of a meal. The special flavor of blueberry pie was a hefty $1.25 extra, and I couldn't help but think of how $1.25 literally gets you a scoop with a cone at John's Ice Cream in Berkeley. \n\n(Note: To clarify, I believe they only make ice cream in front of you if they don't have an already made batch.

Not to sound sexist, but this is clearly an issue in the area as we saw lots of homeless...not sure if there is better security for these workers because that lady was creepy AF! By the time we left, the lady was still there. Hopefully they got her to leave.  It would definitely make me uncomfortable to walk in alone if I wasn't with my husband.

Came here on a Sunday afternoon during Memorial Day weekend. Lots of seating inside and in the surrounding area. They also make the ice cream using liquid nitrogen which is cool. You can see them making it in front of you.\n\nThe line was semi-long but moved pretty quickly. There's someone that walks around and takes your order on an iPad before you even get to the counter, which definitely speeds things up. But you sorta need to know what you're gonna get beforehand. The menu is inside so if you're standing outside in line, it's hard to see what flavors they have. One of the workers was starting to write the flavors on the side of the window though, but too slow to be useful since I was already halfway through the line. \n\nI ordered vanilla bean on a waffle cone and I wanted rainbow sprinkles but they were out T____T so I opted to try the Tcho crispies. They have two sizes -- small or regular. I don't remember exactly how much it was, but it was semi pricy. The norm for hipster ice cream in the city LOL. The ice cream was very creamy, but not overly rich. It was good, but the standout for me was the waffle cone. SO DELICIOUS. Not too crunchy, but not too soft. Perfect texture and taste. It made the ice cream that much more enjoyable. They didn't put the Tcho crispies on the ice cream for me, but rather handed me a cup with them. I wish they would have just poured it on the ice cream for me because I was holding a lot of stuff LOL so it made it difficult to put the toppings on myself. They were ok. I wish they had rainbow sprinkles. Ugh. It's my favorite thing ever. But I can't complain too much because the ice cream was still delicious.\n\nSolid place to fill your ice cream needs.

Standing on the corner right next to a park renovation is a cute little stand that makes on-the-spot, liquid nitrogen ice cream with fresh and innovative flavors! It's certainly worth your time to check out what they have to offer and enjoy a cool treat!\n\nWhen we went on a Friday evening, there was only one person in front of us, but I think we were just lucky because a steady stream of people showed up later. We ended up ordering a flight of 3 flavors for $9. I love that you can choose whichever three flavors you want, and they hand them to you as they're made. Out of the four offered flavors, we got:\n\nNectarines and Cream\nSalted Caramel\nCookie Dough with Pretzels and Chocolate Chips\n\nThe only one we didn't try was the Dark Chocolate. I loved how the Nectarines and Cream flavor had little bits of fruit in it. It was more savory than sweet, as was the Salted Caramel. It's hard to explain, but the Cookie Dough definitely had more sweetness to it. The chunks of pretzel and bits of cookie dough were delicious too. Seriously, the flavors are complex and unique. They served the flight in three little bowls with mini spoons, and I think those tiny spoons are what saved us from inhaling the dessert before we could truly savor it!\n\nThe only downside is that as far as seating they only have a little bench in their establishment. There is a cool wooden structure just across the street that has some neat places to sit. \n\nAll in all, there is something fresh and pure about a just-made cup of ice cream, and I'd definitely come back for more!", "author": "Carlye M."}

There are a lot ice cream shops that are doing the whole liquid nitrogen concept so I wasn't really expecting too much because I felt like I've tried almost every liquid nitrogen ice cream trend but Smitten's is legit.\n\nAlthough they only have a few flavors on their menu, they do it absolutely well. I'm not sure how often they change the flavors on their blackboard but I'm sure it depends on what's in season. I'm a believer of the phrase 'less is more' and this place does it right. I appreciate how they also write down which toppings and flavor combinations they recommend with which ice cream you chose as well. I ordered the TCHO 60.5% chocolate and chose the spicy caramel topping. My friend Jeff ordered the TCHO as well but with the oatmeal cookie crumble as recommended by the staff. They make all their ice cream fresh and there's a glass partition where you can watch them mix the batch for you. It's always fun to watch and you get to see what exactly goes into your order. The process is quick and seamless, we got our ice cream a little over 5 minutes.\n\nSmitten is located in this cool area in Hayes Valley so once we got our ice cream we around the park for a little bit. There are a lot of seating areas so finding a place is not problem. When we sat down in front of the wooden Hayes Valley Temple by artist David Beck (which is impressive by the way. The wooden structure was intricate and beautiful). It's nice to take in the sights while eating delicious food. The ice cream itself was rich and smooth, it reminded me of a nice cup of hot cocoa during the winter time. The chocolate ice cream was topped with a spicy caramel sauce which complimented it well and it had just the right amount of kick to it. My friend ordered the same chocolate ice cream but with the oatmeal cookie crumble and it was delicious as well. The oatmeal cookie crumble added a nice texture to the smoothness of the chocolate.\n\nI was a bit skeptical at first but like I said, Smitten is legit.

On my visit one Sunday afternoon, my friends and I split the cookie dough with pretzel ice cream and the blood orange with pistachio cookie ice cream. Both of these flavors were very unique in taste and had the perfect amount of chunkies. But the ice cream base itself was what really impressed me. First, the texture was so smooth and creamy, because the ice crystals formed by the liquid nitrogen are smaller than those made with the conventional method, leading to a much smoother mouth feel. Second, the ice cream was so fresh that you could still taste the pasteural flavors of the milk and cream--there wasn't the slightest hint of freezer burn or even ice--all you get are the light, subtle aromas of the dairy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-11", "description": "I moved to San Francisco for Smitten Ice Cream. You may judge me. You may call me crazy. You may even consider moving to the most expensive city in the world pathologically reckless and financially irresponsible. But that's because you obviously have not experienced the delicious chilled dairy perfection known simply, as Smitten. \n\nTo say that my relationship with Smitten is an addiction would be an understatement. Addicts can sometimes stop when they seek help. Those of us acquainted with Smitten know that their is no hope, nor desire, for anything other than a life devoted to securing and inhaling as much of their exquisite product as possible. \n\nAs a true Smitten devotee, I spend at least 36.7% of my paycheck on their ice cream. I make sure I never fall below this number as that would be a deviation from anything other than absolute and complete serfdom to the cult of Smitten. \n\nAs any good addict, I have forsworn relationships, hobbies, and basic personal hygiene to make more time for Smitten Ice Cream. I do not brush my teeth, shower, or clip my nails as this would detract from ice cream time. \n\nI also have my own Smitten Ice Cream Kit, which looks like a heroin kit. It includes a rusted metal spoon, only spoon I ever eat ice cream with, and never wash as this would deplete its vital ice cream essences. I also have a piece of rubber surgical tubing, in order to slurp the last bits of ice cream out of the bottom of the cup. I have a needle and syringe, to squish more ice cream into my mouth when I've already stuffed my cheeks to the point of bleeding. And a lighter, to melt the ice cream. Obviously, this seems disturbingly similar to a heroin kit, but please do not judge. Every item is painstakingly selected for maximum ice cream consuming ability. You would do well to imitate me in order to reach peak ice cream assimilation. \n\nSmitten should be considered an accredited college, and in light of this fact I decided to pull all four of my children out of private school, and have them spend eight hours a day in Smitten Ice Cream, eating and observing the Brrristas. My children have learned engineering and physics by observing the cooling and mixing machines operate. They have learned music by listening to the top 100 playlist that runs on repeat. They have learned complex mathematics by watching the Brrristas use measuring cups and teaspoons. They have learned advanced literature by studying ice cream labels and coming up with incorrectly spelled names for these flavors. \n\nI have developed close personal relationships with all of the employees by demanding their social security numbers and personal home addresses. If they refuse, I claim that there is rat feces in my ice cream and get them fired. This allows me to show up at their house and bang violently on their bedroom window if they're late for any reason. \n\nIf you look closely, you'll see that all the problems in life can be solved by this careful method of study. As a bonus, a Smitten education pays for itself, and attendance is ensured through massive ice cream consumption. \n\nTo be honest, Yelp isn't worthy of Smitten. The Discovery Channel isn't worthy of Smitten. The only way this store will get the recognition it deserves is if it is recognized as a historical treasure by Congress. It should be declared its own country with its own system of governance, its own military, and its own currency (which will obviously be used ice cream spoons).", "author": "Armi L."}

There were about two-three people working which doesn't look like much but they move quick and they're still able to give great customer service. The process of their ice cream is made by liquid nitrogen. The founder Robyn wanted to create a smoother texture by freezing ice cream at low temperatures while keeping a freshly packed product.

It's so fun to watch your ice cream being prepared in the huge mixers behind the counter. \n\nWhat I tried -- TCHO CHOCOLATE w/ SPICY CARAMEL SAUCE. This was the recommended combo on the board and it did not disappoint! I always love TCHO dark chocolate and I really tasted the rich flavor in the ice cream. The spicy caramel sauce paired well with the chocolate -- it had just a hint of heat from cinnamon. The texture of the ice cream is like a hybrid between traditional ice cream and soft serve.\n\nThe only downside is the price point here. Although I loved my ice cream, paying a little over $5 for a couple of small scoops is a bit extravagant for me. My favorite ice cream spot in SF is still Bi-Rite, but I will come back to Smitten if I'm in Hayes Valley again.\n\nOther things to note:\n- Lone lines, especially on weekend nights\n- All ice cream is freshly made to order, so you can't sample different flavors\n- Flavors of the day are usually 3-4 choices", "author": "Bonnie Z."}

This one is so SF though--it's located in a quaint little shack in the middle of a sad looking cement park. But it's the same Smitten goodness.\n\nFor those unfamiliar--the Smitten model is liquid nitrogen ice cream that is made on the spot for you. Pros of this are because they aren't freezing their ice cream and because it's made with liquid nitrogen, the crystals are smaller and the flavor is richer and creamier than your typical ice cream. I will say that once you enter into the world of gourmet  (if you want to call this gourmet), Safeway ice cream will never taste the same again. \n\nThe con though is the wait time. It's not obnoxiously long, but sometimes if they have a lot of people going and they're making flavors by the batches, you can get unlucky and end up in the last batch which will take some time... so not a huge deal but can be frustrating when you order before all your friends but end up being the last person to actually get the ice cream.\n\nIn terms of the ice cream itself at Smitten, I think it's pretty good. The creamy texture is very noticeable, and it's good. The only but is that the ice cream is really sweet. You won't notice it when you first start, but by the end of your ice cream, you'll want to get some water to wash out the sweetness. \n\ntldr. yay smitten. liquid nitrogen is all the craze these days. ice cream is on the sweeter size. small portion size is good though--actually two scoops!", "author": "Jasmine X."}

Meaning, ice cream is fresh and not frozen before hand.\n-Everything is made from scratch that morning. Nothing is left out on the counter or saved from the previous day.\n-Local/seasonal ingredients are used so the seasonal flavors change constantly.\n-No preservatives or any kind are used. \n-It's cool to watch them make it!\n-Super smooth and creamy. Even the syrup toppings is smooth and creamy (and looks frozen). (Nitrogen -- at 321 degrees Fahrenheit -- makes it very smooth).\n-Intense flavor. If you are a fan of chocolate or vanilla, you will LOVE their classic vanilla and tcho 60.5% chocolate.\n-Line moves faster than Mitchell's. Not as packed either.\n-Doesn't melt as fast compared to Mitchell's.\n-Small cute park next door. Great place to take your date after ice cream! :)\n\nCons:\n-Only 4 flavor choices per day. (Wish there were more choices... Not much incentive to come here often if you tried all the flavors already!)\n-Pricey. $4.75 for a small, $6.00 for a regular. Add an extra $1 for a waffle cone.\n-No option for how many scoops you want (waffle cones automatically come in 2 scoops, can't pick 1 or 3).\n-Only 2 sizes for cups (small or regular).\n-You can't put more than one flavor in a cup/cone (sucks you can't try 2 flavors at once).\n-I don't like the waffle cone (too crunchy and sugary).", "author": "Vicki L."}

There's another location in the Peninsula and two others that *just* opened in the East Bay as of this writing.\n\nAs I was going to be in the city for the weekend as the No1DP was in town, I took advantage of this and asked him to take me here to satisfy my dessert craving and I didn't want to limit myself to the touristy areas.\n\nHayes Valley is located in the non-touristy area of SF. When we went out close to 9pm, there weren't many taxis driving about. If you don't live near the area or unfamiliar with the pubic transportation, you're gonna have to use a Uber/Lyft to get here. At least it's located smack dab in Octavia St.\n\nYou know your establishment has made it when you see a line that fills up the store even in the late hours. At least the wait isn't too long; it took about 10 minutes for the No1DP to be able to place orders. He mentions having orders taken by iPad.\n\nThere's a chalkboard menu outside and inside that advertises the day's flavors. 4-5 flavors are available each day with one of the flavors being the monthly seasonal flavor. They are known for using local and seasonal ingredients (i.e. TCHO chocolate) and for using liquid nitrogen to make your ice cream to order. Though the cream is stored in jugs, the actual ice cream is made right in front of you in these machines called \"Brr...\" (which has 3 patents). Additional toppings, syrups and optional handmade cone are available for an additional cost.\n\nSmall is $4.75, regular is $6.00. Additional toppings/syrup/cone can easily make your ice cream cost $1-$2 more. The ice cream is at least of a good quality as the ice cream is quite solid and DOES NOT MELT. One of the few rare times I ate ice cream and *still* have clean hands after the fact! Sauces solidified upon pour and also did not drip.\n\nMe: TCHO 60.5% chocolate with spicy caramel. Chocolate was good, but the spicy caramel just added to the ice cream - gives it a noticeable spicy kick. The cone was able to hold the ice cream.\n\nNo1DP: Fresh Mint Chip with TCHO Chocolate Sauce. The mint flavor is STRONG, reminiscent of fresh mint leaves in mojitos - good for people that like mint. \n\nLooking forward to coming back here to try their other regular and seasonal flavors.", "author": "Isabella B."}

Where else can you find ice cream \"Made to Order\" ?? You just got to appreciate getting that rather fresh taste in less than 5 minutes! The concept is magic. Totally absolutely swoon worthy magic! \n\nThe menu was simple. Few flavors with pairing.\n*Classic Vanilla\n*TCHO chocolate\n*Mint chocolate chip\n*Blood orange with pistachio shortbread. \n\nWe ordered small Tcho Chocolate, Mint Chocolate Chip and Blood Orange with shortbread.

It's like a fog show!! So funnn. And the people making it were all smiles even though their hands were freezing every time they stop to stir. They even posed for my pictures :) Thanks guys!! \n\nAfter a few thousand sheeps ( 5 minutes) later, I got my small Tcho chocolate with double scoops! Yey!! They have benches that you can sit and watch the whole process or take it to go and eat outside.  First bite- swooon!!!  Smitten! Oh so tasty!!! I loved it. Second bite was my friend's blood orange. It was divine!! Followed by mint chocolate chip. Just wow. It;s light and airy. It's fresh and absolutely right.

A staff member greets us with a coupon for $5 and asks us whether or not we use Paypal. They had some promotion going on where if you paid with Paypal, you'd get basically free ice cream and .25 cents credit since the small size with tax was priced at $4.75. Since we have the Paypal app, it was easy peasy but with the repeated questions and many frequent asks to download Paypal, I can see how one would be deterred from using it and decide to pay cash instead. The communication of this promotion probably could have happened better and more seamlessly IMO.\n\nAnyways, we get to the front of the line and I order the salted caramel kids scoop (this size is not pictured on the menu) and decided to upgrade to a small at the last second in effort to share different flavors with friends. After placing the order and paying with Paypal (free ice cream) I move to the right of the register and watch my ice cream be made.\n\nFriend asked for chocolate ice cream and they said they didn't have any. Womp. He didn't order anything. Two other friends decide to share the vanilla.\n\nWatching my ice cream be made was pretty awesome.

The chocolate covered rice krispies bumped the flavor profile up this up in my book.\n\nHere's the scoop (yes, I'm punny):\nAfter receiving my ice cream, I was pretty pleased with the texture and how silky the ice cream is. It's firmer than gelato but not as soft as ice cream. The melting point wasn't as quick plus it was cold out.\n\nSalted caramel is deliciously salty but not to the point where you need to gulp down 10 glasses of water from being thirsty.\n\nVanilla tastes like heavy whipping cream Ick. Friends sent it back.\n\nChocolate was superrrr chocolatey but not in a rich way, it was almost as if the 65% should be bumped up to 70 or 75% so it wasn't weirdly in between a dark and milk.\n\nEarl Grey with chocolate chips was so good! The crunch from the chocolate chips really compliments the smoothness of the ice cream. Very subtly flavorful.\n\nThe waffle cone was freaking delicious! A cross between a shortbread cookie and crumbly sugar cookie. Seriously, I'd come back just for the cone. Part of the cone fell off and fell on the ground. Pigeons swooped in and ate it.

Because in my exhaustive testing of West Coast artisanal ice cream, I've only ever given five stars to one place: Bi-Rite. In fact, every other ice cream has fallen so far short of the Bi-Rite that I suspected there might only be room in my heart (though clearly, not my stomach) for one ice cream store.\n\nSmitten changed all that. Their salted caramel ice cream gives Bi-Rite's a run for its money -- though I think Smitten should really call their flavor Burnt Caramel, because the delicious burnt caramel flavor is stronger than the salt. But the texture! The creaminess!\n\nSmitten made me a believer in the liquid nitrogen method. My one previous experience, in Portland, was underwhelming -- I thought it was a gimmick. But the Smitten texture is really unparalleled.\n\nIf I could deduct half a star for the cone, I would: their waffle cones just don't cut it. I'm a great believer in a sugar cone, and I don't like places that deny me that option -- Smitten is cup or waffle cone only and their waffle cones are not good. (I threw mine in the garbage.)

The ice creme has a rich texture and didn't melt very fast at all. The waffle cone was also baked well.

Lack of variety, on a Saturday night no less.  On the menu was vanilla, chocolate, mint chip, and earl grey.  The line wasn't that long of a wait considering how popular this place usually is, and right before we were about to order, we heard that they ran out of the mint chip.  I was intent on going for the earl grey anyways so it didn't matter much.  \n\nI was so ready for the earl grey, so we order...only to be told that the guy who makes it went on a break...and they only had vanilla or chocolate.  WAIT WHAT?!?  It was already 10 pm...and they closed at 10:30, so I didn't quite understand why not everyone knows how to make each flavor.  Maybe it's the business side of me that believes that certain departments should be cross trained...so in the end, I reluctantly had to settle for the chocolate.  Definitely on the creamy and rich side, but mix it up with vanilla and you have the perfect counterpart.

Surprisingly, I liked the sweet corn and berry the most. It was subtle with the corn flavor. It reminded me slightly of buttered corn on the cob without the taste of butter, more like the creaminess of it. The berry sauce added tang to really contrast it. \n\nI actually didn't order this flavor, but I had a few bites from a friend. I purchased a small cup of the TCHO 60% chocolate. It was good, but it really tasted like chocolate milk. I personally don't like milk but I think that's Smitten's signature, the fact that you can taste all the ingredients. Of course milk is an ingredient, but I'm just not a fan. \n\nI also want to critique their way of serving the ice cream. Apparently I missed my name being called, which is weird to me because my entire group of friends didn't notice. Of course we were talking, but I'm sure that the workers can kind of tell where general orders are due to sequence of payment. \n\nI like the idea of LN^2 freezing my ice cream on the spot, it's very entertaining to watch. The concept is so that there are smaller ice particles in the ice cream. This is very true, but it was something that I personally did not like. It was very smooth, but also very melty. I'm the type of person to like my ice cream really hard. I think it's super fun and cute and I love to support local businesses and will bring my friends.

They usually only have 4 flavors, 2 are seasonal and the other 2 are the classic vanilla and tcho chocolate. I always go with the seasonal flavors. So far I've tried their white balsamic vinaigrette with strawberry (my fave so far, not too sweet with fresh strawberry flavor and the balsamic had a little tang to it and complimented well with the strawberry), mint chip (fresh spearmint used, definitely not your typical mint choc chip ice cream, it tasted almost like eating gum flavored ice cream. I don't think I would get this again but it was interesting to try), and nectarine (very flavorful and not too sweet). I've tried their tcho choc too, it's not too sweet, which I like. I usually stay away from choco due to the fact it's usually too sweet for me to handle.\n\nThey use fresh ingredients so they're ice cream has loads flavor to them. Sometimes it can be quite strong. It often surprises me because it's not what I'm expecting, in a good way.\n\nUnfortunately, you can't sample (or not to my knowledge). It is a bit on the pricier end for ice cream too.\n\nBut I like that they keep their menu pretty simple, I mean there's only 4 flavors to choose from, but you can get more creative with their selection of toppings. I stay away from the toppings just cause they all sound so sweet. For an indecisive person like me, to only to have to choose between 4 flavors makes my life easier.\n\nTheir waffle cones are delicious too!\n\nSmitten is located in Hayes Valley, so if you know Hayes Valley, parking can be quite the pain in the a**. But Hayes Valley is a very nice area with a lot of brunch places and boutiques. Great place to spend your Sundays especially with good weather.\n\nSmitten is very popular so expect a line. They do their best to keep the line moving, which I think they do a great job with. The workers are friendly, but their busy so don't be surprised if you feel rushed to order or if you don't get much attention from them.\n\nThey take cash and card. I've tried to pay with paypal once because their was a discount of $5 off. But Paypal wasn't working for them that day :(. They said Paypal isn't one of their main methods of payment.

The TCHO chocolate was rich but not too sweet or bitter like other chocolates I've tried. \n\nOnce you pick your flavor, they pour the mixture into a mixer and use liquid nitrogen to change the liquid into an ice cream. If they still have the sweet corn, I would definitely recommend trying that flavor since it's limited edition and so unique.", "author": "Jennifer M."}

Literally anytime I am even remotely near Hayes Valley I start daydreaming about whether or not I can justify a quick stop over here.\n\nI have never had ice cream better than this and I'm not sure that I ever will. They make the ice cream on the spot with liquid nitrogen. The normal flavors are all perfectly executed, especially the salted caramel. What really will have your mouth watering though is the special flavor which they change every month. It is always something unique and interesting with some added twist. For example, last month the nectarine flavor had perfectly crystallized pieces of nectarine mixed in, and this month the sweet corn flavor is topped with a complementing berry glaze on top and bottom. Add on to this the fantastic toppings, my favorite of which is the cinnamon shortbread, although the popular favorite are the delicious tcho crispies.\n\nThe setting is great as well as it is located in a converted shipping container in the heart of Hayes Valley on Octavia. This provides a great scenic spot to relax and enjoy the best ice cream that exists. Why are you still reading this? Stop looking at yelp and go get some Smittens right now.", "author": "Mark O."}

See what I did there? Yeah? No? Ok, I'll stop.\n\nAnyway, first off I will say, it might be better to stick to just the ice cream instead of adding a bunch of stuff to it. I tried the basic Mint Chip Ice cream. It was really creamy, and actually tasted of real mint. Not the artificial mint you normally would get. That was a pleasant surprise to me. Now- I have a weird thing about chips in my ice cream. I don't like them super chunky because they get stuck in your teeth- this was nice. These chips kinda just melted in your mouth. My friend got a root beer which was also tasty! It came with a bottle of root beer on the side.  \nWith all that being said, the ice cream flavors change daily, and the ice cream is made fresh.

I know they name the flavors with exciting names, but you're working with your straight-up basics: vanilla, Tcho chocolate (chocolate), white strawberry balsamic (strawberry) and blue bottle coffee (um, coffee). I haven't been able to catch the mint or the caramel, but neither of those sound earth shattering either. \n\nOk fine, you stick to the basics. That can be a good thing if you knock them out of the park. (My favorite cupcake is chocolate with vanilla icing, after all.) However, I found the ice cream to be just... good?  I liked it. The texture was nice. But memorable, it was not. I guess I'm a little let down after all the hype and the higher-end price tag.

I got the blood orange ice cream with pistachio shortbread and could not have been happier. I also took their suggestion and paired it with brown sugar caramel - the flavor combination was perfect! \n\nI think the consistency of the ice cream is great - light and airy.

I'm a SoCal native and Smitten has been on the list of go-to ice cream spots from the mouths of my NorCal friends. I have failed in pushing from going to this place far too long. Smitten wasn't on the agenda as my boyfriend and I were waiting for a table at Straw. We decided to walk along the path around the park and found a little pop-up looking store. Fortunately, it was Smitten that we ran into. \n\nI love the surrounding area! So if you go on a nice sunny day like we did, you'll find yourself in a nice area to walk around. There's a cute bike rental on the side of Smitten (so cute). There was also  some food trucks so maybe try going on a warm weekend if you want plan on hanging out with a friend/going out for a date. \n\nSo let's talk about ice cream. I got a regular early grey with chocolate pieces in a homemade cone and my boyfriend got the chocolate chip dough with rainbow sprinkles (all natural, btw) on a waffle bowl. They seem to take their ice cream pretty seriously (custom-made ice cream gadgets) and inventive, seasonal flavors. Taste was A. Using nitrogen in ice cream=smaller crystals=smoother ice cream= velvety and creamy texture. It was so good. But on the expensive side.

To be honest, I wasn't necessarily hungry or even in an ice cream-craving mood, but I'm not out in Hayes Valley too much.\n\nToday's flavors included Vanilla, TCHO chocolate, Fresh Mint Chip, and Strawberry White Balsamic. Since I wanted something refreshing and light, I opted for the Strawberry. For a little over $4, I got two small scoops in an eco-friedly cup and a tiny spoon. I have to admit, it was cool seeing my ice cream made in the liquid nitrogen contraption. Additionally, it's refreshing to see simple, fresh ingredients going into making my ice cream instead of a bunch of preservatives, stabilizers, and artificial flavorings. \n\nMy friend ordered the Fresh Mint Chip, which was pretty good. You could tell the mint was from fresh mint leaves and not that mint extract stuff. My Strawberry White Balsalmic was also pretty good. It was exactly what you would expect from a strawberry ice cream.\n\nSince I was already full from lunch earlier, I could have easily split a small ice cream with my friend. However, I didn't even see a kids size option (i.e. a one scoop cup). From pictures, it looks like they have one or used to have one?

After gorging ourselves at Suppenkuche, Greg and I walked up and down Hayes Valley to explore.

The line was, well, long.  It took about 20 minutes to finally get our hands on the liquid nitrogen treat.  But, you forgave Smitten for its long line when you tasted the creaminess and decadence of the ice cream.

He said there was a good place to get ice cream in walking distance. (we were at Lers Ros Thai on Hayes. So after our meal we headed to Smitten Ice Cream. While walking there he mentioned that the owner was on Shark Tank. Later I looked this up and I found out that it was a different Liquid Nitrogen ice cream. Before I came here though the only liquid nitrogen ice cream i knew was Dippin' Dots. It was cool back when I was younger, but I like regular ol ice cream. \n\nThis place (founded by Robyn Sue Fisher.. Hi Robyn!) Is a super step up from the Dippin' Dots that you know. There really isn't a comparison. They use seasonal and local ingredients to come up with the flavors you know and love and some crazy & unusual ones. No preservatives, emulsifiers (don't know what this is), or stabilizers (i know what these are but not when talking about ice cream). \n\nThe shop is build out of an Old Storage Container. (way to recycle!!!)\n\nIce Cream: \n\n(The usuals)\n\nTCHO Chocolate (TCHO 60.5% 60% or no percentage, I am not sure but I think there is different types including Dark Chocolate).\n\nIn case you were wondering... and I was because I have never heard of TCHO - \nTCHO is a luxury chocolate maker based in San Francisco, California. Its factory and headquarters are located on Pier 17 along the Embarcadero, in the city's historic downtown waterfront district. (Your welcome)\n\nClassic Vanilla, Strawberry, Fresh Mint Chip\n\n(The others - Seasonal so it depends on when you go)\n\nHoney Nectarine, Maple Brown Sugar Squash, Meyer Lemon Gingersnap, Cre'me Fra'che, White Balsamic Strawberry, Toho Chocolate, Salted Caramel, Olive Oil and Lavender Shortbread, Organic Mint, Plum, Sticky Toffee Pudding, Cinnamon Apple Crisp, Earl Grey, Blood Orange w/ Pistachio Shortbread, Sweet Corn w/ Berries, Sea Salt Caramel, Cinnamon Shortbread, Strawberry Pink Peppercorn, Brown Sugar w/ Cinnamon Crust, Rhubarb Crisp with or without Cake Batter, Rose... etc.\n\nToppings: (I am assuming alot of these are seasonal)\nChocolate Sauce, Pear Caramel, Candied Jalapeno, Almond Brittle, Brown Sugar Caramel, Toasted Walnuts, Dark Chocolate Chips, Spicy Caramel, Pitachio Brittle, Whipped Cream, Peanut Butter Brittle, Peppermint Bark, TCHO Bites, Cocoa Nib Praline Brittle, Candied Walnuts, Pistachio Brittle, Orange Clove Caramel.... etc.\n\nSome of these Ice Cream and Toppings could be discontinued. I went through alot of pictures spanning 2 years to get them. Whew!!! \n\nSmittens usually have 4 choices during the day. Most of the time Classic Vanilla and Chocolate will be 2 of the 4.\n\nThey also carry Vegan options, and Ice Cream Pops...\n\nDuring our trips we picked Salted Caramel, Chocolate and Vanilla. I am usually a Chocolate Ice Cream type of guy and this was good, but I really liked the flavor of their Classic Vanilla. All 3 were good. From looking at the flavor list there are some I would definitely try and some I wouldn't dare. \n\nWe took pictures with my friend (known as Sunspot on World of Warcraft) and the family with our Ice Cream in hand. (Fyi I am known as Zhion on WoW). It was a really cool day. When I head back to San Francisco for the Bar hopping and Beer drinking, I will make sure to save some room for Ice Cream.

The guy making the chocolate flavor calls out my gf's name and hands her one cup of chocolate ice cream.\n\nShe tells the guy, \"We have one more chocolate, right?\" He grumpily replies, \"Yes, it'll be right out.\" Two or three more cups of chocolate get handed out after a few minutes to other patrons.. so I tell the same guy, \"We're still waiting on one more.\"\n\nThis same guy, in an even more disgruntled-sounding and rude tone of voice, grumbled back at me, \"Yes, it'll come right up.\" He never asked for our order's name, never checked his board, nothing.\n\n30 minutes later, no f'ing second ice cream cup.\n\nWe just gave up and went home.

So far, the only other place that I have had ice cream made like that is Ice Cream Lab here in L.A. and I love the mixture they use as their base. Like most trendy ice cream shops their menu does have a lot of variety and they do offer unique season flavors. \n\nThe are where the Smitten Ice Cream is located is a totally a \"hipster\" location. Pastel colored buildings, sitting areas located around multiple different art pieces and some stores or shops are made from shipping containers. \n\nWhen we found the location of Smitten, I was excited at first to try their ice cream, but once we were in line, I slowly started to regret it. While the line is not long, the position of store doesn't benefit the customer. During the prime hours of the day the sun is beating on you while you wait in line, and while it was not hot that day, standing in the sun with minimal shade from the store itself made the wait kind of unbearable.\n\nTheir customer service lacks...well customer service. By that I mean, the girl that was working the register had a very dry personality. She didn't greet us, she just gave us a \"are you ready or what\" look, and when I asked her questions about the menu, she answered with a flat tone as if it was my fault for not knowing more about the menu. I decided to try their \"TCHO chocolate\" with their TCHO crispies after asking the cashier if it was \"too chocolatey\" (she said it wasn't), and my boyfriend decided to get their seasonal item which was their Earl Grey with milk chocolate chips and also added their cinnamon cookies. Then while waiting for our order the girls that were preparing the ice cream orders were  openly talking/complaining about their personal life. Some of it...not so good to say while people are in front of you waiting for their order.\n\nAfter a 30 minute wait we finally received our order. Sadly, my ice cream order looked overly..\"chocolatey\", which was what I was trying to avoid. It taste like I was eating a whole chocolate bar. The TCHO crispies were really good though, I ended up just searching for pieces of the crispies in the ice cream and then I just tossed the ice cream because the TCHO chocolate ice cream itself was just too much...to the point where I had to get water from La Boulange to wash it down fully. I think I would have enjoyed it better if I had gotten it with their vanilla ice cream. My boyfriend's ice cream was really good. The Earl Grey wasn't too overpowering and the cinnamon cookies along with the chocolate chips gave it a good crunch.\n\nThis place was good to try but, since we have multiple locations in SoCal that do the same thing, i don't think I would go out of my way to have this place again.", "author": "Angelica E."}

I saw Smitten Ice Cream featured on one of my favorite cooking channels last week. After reading the positive reviews on yelp I had to give Smitten a try. \n\nAtmosphere/Decor: \n\nSmitten's Ice Cream is setup like a metal shack like structure with open entry ways on each side. I like how you can watch the employees use the unique liquid nitrogen apparatus ice cream maker. There's a menu on the wall to the left that lists the different ice creams. There's a few wooden benches to sit down on while waiting for your ice cream. I also saw a good amount of chairs to sit on located outside towards the rear of Smitten's. I like the location of Smitten Ice Cream. Right next to Smitten's is a nice park. My girlfriend and I ate our Ice Cream at the park. There were plenty of places to sit at. \n\nFood:\n\nI decided to go with a Truly Smitten Sundae. I ordered the Salty & Cinnacle (Salted Caramel\u00a0ice cream, cinnamon shortbread, TCHO chocolate sauce, homemade whipped cream.) This sundae was absolutely sensational! The ice cream was so creamy and the texture was so smooth. The flavors were amazing! The cinnamon shortbread tasted really good and complimented the Salted Caramel ice cream. The TCHO chocolate sauce was pretty intense but not overpowering. The homemade whipped cream was the icing on the cake! \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Classic Vanilla Ice Cream (2 scoops) in a made from scratch ice cream cone. She loved her ice cream! She said it was the best ice cream she's ever had! \n\nService: \n\nThe girl that took our order was very nice. They make your ice cream fairly quickly. You don't have to wait that long. Service was good. \n\nOverall:\n\nThis place was packed! Smitten's Ice Cream is my new favorite ice cream spot. For the longest I was a coldstone fan but ever since trying Smitten's I now have to kick coldstone to the curb. Smitten's Ice Cream is the best ice cream I've ever tried.

I'm willing to give this another chance IF they can control the amount of chips to throw in the mix.\n\nBLOOD ORANGE + PISTACHIO SHORTBREAD\nAh, finally.

The ice cream is so rich, and you can believe the quality, 'cause it's made right in front of you with their fancy schmancy liquid nitrogen machinery. And it comes out in decent time; they might as well have scooped it up, but NOOO, it's made from scratch. The dudes who work there are friendly, and it's in a heated little tent that makes you comfortable eating ice cream no matter what the weather's like outside.\n\nThe earl grey ice cream is so subtly good, but I recommend getting it without the chocolate chips, because the rich milk chocolate began to overpower the earl grey tea-ness after a few bites. Dark chocolate lovers will appreciate the 60.5% Tcho chocolate, which is anything but subtle and should probably saved for last, as you won't be able to taste anything elseafterwards. The salted caramel was kind of coconutty, and quite salty indeed--I actually thirsted.\n\nIn general, the ice cream is RICH RICH RICH, thick, and stands up as you spoon it. A small scoop is $4.75, but you get two rich scoops, which ended up being more than enough. Regular gets you three scoops in a big bowl. They accept cash or credit.

The ice cream had an overall melty texture and and heaviness of the cream was a bit overwhelming. Not to mention the staggering prices for just two scoops of ice cream, not including the toppings! On our first visit we tried the Vanilla and the Salted Caramel. The vanilla was creamy, smooth, but again the creaminess was overpowering the dessert. The salted caramel packed a nice taste, not too sweet, but not too salty. However, it definitely didn't stand out to me as a a bowl worth its price.\n\nFlash forward a couple years later; I just went to smitten's three times in a series of five days. Somethings definitely changed about the process, it's much more efficient with the workers are attending to their jobs in an orderly manner and the line moves much quicker. The prices are a bit higher, but the quality of the product is just the same if not better. Over the past few days, I have been salivating for this flavor, the apple crisp ice cream. An upgrade worth paying extra for, this flavor packs in the nostalgic essences of a warm apple pie, buttery, sugary, and most importantly delicious. The cinnamon cookies also add a nice textural balance. The cones at Smitten are also delectable, buttery and crisp they add a nice finish to a wonderful dessert. \n\nTip* If you are not feeling too hungry for dessert but still crave ice cream, try asking for a single scoop.

So I will do a 5 star rating bc that small niche isn't a bother for this gem. \n\nThe ice cream is soooo smooth, but thick and not all that dense it's the perfect combo. I didn't even need water while enjoying which is a plus because usually I'm dying of thirst when having some ice cream. I got the Classic vanilla sundae which was about $8 that came with 3 scoops of ice cream with Tcho (chocolate covered rice crispies), homemade whipped cream and butter caramel sauce. By far the best deal because one scoop in a cup is already $4.95. And if you want a topping it's another 75 cents per sauce topping and the other topics such as Tcho bits are a high price. A waffle cone is another $1.75 if you're into that (or is it $1.25??). So I recommend that.\n\nThe line was long at around 9pm but with good company it goes pretty quick. Reason be, the ice cream is made to order and they only have three stations of flavors made when you order. The only downside besides the wait which isn't so bad is the variety of flavors available. Everyday is different and for me it was Earl Grey, Salted Caramel and Classic Vanilla day.

You really taste what the flavor is called.  That said, they usually only have ~4 flavors at a time.  My favorite is the vanilla.  If that is too boring, throw on some Tcho crisps and you will be happy.  The mint chip is good as well as the earl grey when they are available.  Also like the rhubarb.  Each of these flavors are just the right amount of sweet and true to flavor.  \n\nOptions that I didnt like as much were the Tcho Chocolate and the salted caramel.

Second, the wait time was pretty long. It took us around 30 minutes to get our ice cream. I guess that's what happens when your ice cream is \"made to order.\" The time you wait varies with your order since each flavor has its own station/line. My friends who ordered the THCO Chocolate got theirs a lot faster than I did.\n\nNow onto the ice cream - they used real mint in the ice cream, so it had a very strong, herbal flavor. The aftertaste felt like I just brushed my teeth. The sensation quickly went away after a few bites however and just tasted bland. The ice cream texture was dense, smooth, and very crumbly, which made it hard to scoop.

And there's a reason.\n\nAside from every flavor holding the ingredients for tastiness, when you order your ice cream, you are going to get a personal experience of watching someone behind the counter pour out the proportion of ingredients to get your full order of ice cream.

It's like the tastiest science experiment ever.\n\nAnd honestly? I truly have never had such a creamy ice cream.\n\nNow! They don't just smack it with a little nitro. No, no, no. This ice cream has the staying power of an ice cream that has been in the depths of a frozen hell. No quick melts here. The liquid nitrogen also only gives the ice cream the chance to develop very very small crystals, and that results in the amazingly creamy texture.\n\nI forgot that a friend had done a birthday ice cream crawl for one of her friend's last year, but the moment I said \"Smitten\", her face lit up. This was definitely a good choice.\n\nI tried the Honey Nectarine seasonal flavor, and it was excellent.

I guess it needed to 'cool down\" (rather than warm up...), so it took a little bit. When the ice cream was done, the guy hands it over to my friend...who ordered the same thing. But he called her name. His colleague mentioned his mistake, but neither of them acknowledged the mistake with us. But since my friend had a larger size, and we knew they made a mistake with delivering us the ice cream, I went over to clarify the next one was the larger size. Which...it was. \n\nThe first ice cream, delivered incorrectly, was really icy. Like nitrogen-y. I wouldn't have noticed a difference if my friend hadn't even gotten the same thing and I tasted hers. And the 2nd one was surprisingly creamy. I became the person I don't like and approached them to ask for a re-do of my ice cream. Because. That thing tasted like the nitrogen ice cream made at Picnic Day, UC Davis, with a wooden spoon and nitrogen. Its got the cold, but is all gimmick. \n\nThe 3rd one I got (replacement for the 1st one). And that one was the first one that was gold. It finally combined the texture with the flavor I was looking for. Legitimately, my friends and I were tasting 1, 2, and 3 and judging the difference.\n\nI'd normally give it a bit higher marks. But even though the staff were friendly, they didn't acknowledge their mistakes (point off). Also, for something that is made fresh per batch, I'd think it would be good for the staff to taste the ice cream. Or, at least identify when the texture is clearly different. I mean, batch 1 was icy. Think ice cream left in a freezer for 2 months.

They use a proprietary \"Kelvinator\" machine that employs liquid nitrogen to freeze your ice cream at super-low temperatures - with frothy, steamy results. \n\nThe real difference in the ice cream is its airy smoothness. It's very low in density, melts in your mouth quickly, and goes down fast - which doesn't quite give you enough time to savor the actual flavors. I've tried the salted caramel, which was a very good combination of saltiness and caramel (but, as another poster here mentioned, not as good as the impossibly high standard set by Bi-Rite), as well as the strawberry with peppercorn, which had a spicy kick to it.\n\nBecause of the made-from-scratch process, you can't mix and match flavors in one cup or cone. The cones themselves are homemade - not the typical brittle, crunchy kind, but, like the ice cream, very soft, light, low in density, somewhat fragile, and, above all, heavenly.\n\nThe ice cream is seriously expensive, but you pay what you get for, given the fresh ingredients, complexity of the process, and the somewhat labor-intensive, made-from-scratch, just-for-you nature of the operation.

Making old-fashioned ice cream using basic ingredients with the \"Kelvin\", an ice cream machine on a traveling red Radio Flyer that runs on liquid nitrogen definitely draws the foodie masses. Although Smitten Ice Cream now serves their ice cream out of recycled shipping container in Hayes Valley, it still maintains its nostalgic qualities with a store front that reminds me of a lemonade stand.\n\nOn Friday, 6.17.11, my co-workers and I went to Smitten Ice Cream at around 2:15 PM and there was still a small crowd of people there. We thought by going there at an \"off\" time that it would be less crowded but apparently so did everyone else. \n\nMENU\nSmitten Ice Cream's Menu changes weekly with four flavors available each day:\n*THE CLASSICS: Vanilla and TCHO Chocolate (always available)\n*SEASONAL: Salted Caramel and Summer Herb (Rosemary, Thyme, Basil, Mint) \n\nThere's one mixer for each flavor with the best seller being the Salted Caramel, so expect a longer wait if you order this flavor.\n\nWhen it comes to ice cream, I like to keep things simple so I ordered a Small Vanilla with Cocoa Nibs Praline ($4.75 + $.50). CC's are accepted. From start to finish, it took about 15 minutes to get my ice cream. While waiting, it's was very cool to watch the ice cream being made Kitchen Aid like mixers with clouds of smoke emanating from the bowls like a science project. \n\nVANILLA ICE CREAM w/ Cocoa Nib Pralines\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mMiOVbGovegeBg-6YyqDxA?select=av9lykHVVQjDP4TS5bhmoA\nUnlike other ice creams, you can taste the absolute purity of Smitten Ice Creams with no remnants of any ice crystals. The vanilla was ultra smooth, creamy and slowly melted into each of my taste buds. You can really taste the milk, cream and sugar in its unadulterated form. The Cocoa Nib Pralines gave it a crunchy bittersweet bite. The vanilla was a little too sweet for my taste and got even sweeter towards the end, so the Cocoa Nibs Pralines are a must to help cut through some of the sweetness. \n\nIt's not the best ice cream I've had, however, the cool concept alone makes it a must try for any foodie or ice cream aficionado. It is expensive at almost $5 a scoop, but it's a small price to pay for a taste of PURE nostalgia.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I didn't know this was going to be made-to-order ice cream. Well, slap my belly and call me Elsie the Cow. Otherwise I would have brought my Kindle to pass the time. Apparently salted caramel is one of their more labor-intensive concoctions as it gets churned in a high-powered Kelvin mixing machine a lot longer than the other flavors. They have four of them going, guns a-blazing.\n\nEach one requires a staff person to make the machine whirl and produce the tailor-made liquid nitrogen ice cream. That means it takes a village to accommodate the waiting throngs waiting for their cups of creamy confection. No wonder it costs a whopping $4.65 for a small cup. I must be paying for all their health benefits. The result? It was honestly so sweet and thick, the Salted Caramel was just too sugary and already melting fast to be entirely satisfying (see photo). Jamie W. tried the TCHO 60.5% Dark Chocolate, which tasted like cake batter before it made it into the oven (see photo). There appears to be a fan base for their product, but I just feel this heavily staffed operation does not give me a reason to be, well... smitten. \n\nICE CREAM - 3 stars...heavily produced artisan stuff for fans only \nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...like a boxy Quonset hut \nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...certainly friendly enough \nTOTAL - 3 stars...quite a production if you want to stick around for it", "author": "Ed U."}

The subtle blood orange flavor counteracted the crunchy pistachio shortbread; the texture of the ice cream was velvety smooth.\n\nThere isn't a table and chairs seating area, but there are some bench-type spots inside and of course the park that is nearby. My small ice cream was $4.70, but hey, I don't mind paying a bit more for quality ingredients and watching the magic at work.", "author": "Tiffany K."}

I went with salted caramel ice cream (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smitten-san-francisco?select=FjlPy0SvGEJ8F_ZXct3ClQ#b9-YOOl6T730dmrRYAauWQ) with TCHO chocolate crispies and the beau went with mint ice cream with TCHO chocolate drizzle. They were serious when they said that fresh ingredients were used, because the mint ice cream literally tasted like fresh mint leaves. The fresh minty flavor was just too overwhelming in my opinion, I'd probably stick with the classic flavors. The salted caramel was more salty than sweet, which was okay, but the ice cream was just way too rich that I could barely finish the small scoop that I ordered.\n\nIt was incredibly crowded on a Sunday afternoon and it was about 70 degrees outside.

The shop is a transformed recycled shipping container. It looks like a modern canteen tuck shop.\n\nI love the concept. See fresh cream, milk, sugar & other delicious organic local ingredients churned & frozen right in front of your eyes in a couple of minutes in Smitten's custom ice cream machines using liquid nitrogen. Fun for kids to watch the mist spill out. Each customers order is made separately.\n\nLimited to about four flavors available but they do change daily. We tried the TCHO 65% chocolate - was the favorite, glossy, dense, incredibly silky. Added spicy caramel sauce. \nWe also got the Salted caramel which my foodie buddy & I found to be lacking in flavor & didn't have that same delicious denseness that the chocolate flavor had.\n\nI am tempted to give it 3.5 stars but feel that would be unfair until I have tried more flavors then just the two I have had. It's certainly quality ice cream and if it wasn't for the chocolate flavor I would be disappointed. I love the cute shop, lovely staff & the concept is fabulous.

They had all this concept art around Patricia's Green about the space and a charming story about how the founder of Smitten carted around her nitrogen in a red wagon. How could you not be intrigued? And when Smitten opened, it did kind of feel revolutionary, with Proxy just starting to get cool with the Biergarten, food trucks, etc. And it IS fun to watch the ice cream getting made right in front of you. \n\nBut the ice cream itself? Just meh. Truly mediocre I think. There are so many fantastic options in the city that I find it really hard to get excited about my $5 from Smitten.

The texture of their ice cream is actually really nice, with a smoothness that falls somewhere between standard ice cream and soft serve - personally though, I prefer mine just a bit harder than this. \n\nAnd their flavor options are pretty limited, serving no more than three or four flavors at a time (two when I arrived, though), but offering up a variety of high-end toppings, for those so inclined. That said, the strawberry white balsamic I tried today was tasty, with actual chunks of strawberries in the ice cream, and a flavor profile that was both light, yet flavorful, albeit not as much so as I'd like.\n\nSo, fans of incredibly smooth, and not overly sweet ice cream, Smitten is definitely your joint. I can see myself dropping by if I'm in the area, but, otherwise, I'm sticking with the Mr & Mrs. Even more so when you consider that the price of a small at Smitten (a whopping $4.75) will get you twice as much at Mr & Mrs! \n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - An outdoor open air stall of sorts, you shouldn't really have much trouble getting in and out, aside from having to get past the mobs of people.\n\nBathroom - I highly doubt they have a public one.", "author": "Johnny W."}

Currently, it's the nectarines n' cream, which I had today. It was good but you can't taste much of the nectarine, it's very light. One star off because $5 for a single scoop is a little steep.

The ice cream is incredible, so lets talk about that first. \n\nIce cream: probably the best I have ever eaten. The seasonal flavors are very good. I especially love the sweet corn and berries flavor that comes in August. The ice cream is made right in front of you fresh from all natural ingredients, and they use liquid nitrogen so the freezing process means tiny crystals and hence there is nothing as smooth. It is seriously THE BEST TASTING ICE CREAM IN THE USA! At least the best I have tried.\n\nHere is why I am docking 2 stars from my review:\nI recently threw a large party and I wanted to have Smitten Ice Cream there for everyone in our building to try (hence promoting their business). We are talking like 30-50 people. I ordered 12 tubs of ice cream and they refused to give me any type of discount! Then when I picked it all up first they refused to take a $100 bill, next when I gave a credit card I got instructed how I should be sure to leave them a tip and a dirty look when I didn't. When you call a day in advance and order a huge amount of ice cream I don't think a tip is appropriate. \n\nThe place does have a loyalty program - an App called Belly where you get a free ice cream for something like 10 visits or \"check-ins\", heck the App even emailed me suggesting I write them a Yelp review. When you look up Belly you will see the owner of Smitten is spending like $150/mo on this loyalty program. I don't see why they don't value their customers more. I have been going there for months and months and sending all my friends, but this wholesale order just turned me off. \n\nI think the business has lost their humbleness; they know they are awesome and hence don't care too much about the customers. I'm hoping for a message from the owner that this is not the case and then I will be sure to update my review to give them the full 5 stars they could easily achieve just on the taste of their amazing ice cream.", "author": "Chris S."}

The sea salt was sold out and I really wanted to try that one! Nevertheless, I got the fresh mint with chocolate sauce since i LOVE minty ice cream. \n\nIce cream: WOW is this what really mint ice cream taste like? I been deceived from all the other generic mint ice cream I had in the past. This was really strong and it felt like I was eating those mint leaves that you eat in PHO haha. \n\nWe also got the strawberry balsamic and it was really good Like a refreshing smoothie compress in a small cup!  \n\nI definitely instagramed the way the workers were making the ice cream using liquid nitrogen and the machines called \"Kelvin\" was a really cool process to see. Definitely a place to try! \n\nOne star taken away because it was hard to find parking!", "author": "Adam J."}

I will admit it's pretty cool to watch ... but at the end of the day it's still ice cream. Vanilla is vanilla, chocolate is chocolate. Compared to big players like BR31, I don't think the ice cream here was significantly different. Maybe we're just too simple of a people for a place like this. However, if you're on vacation and you're only going to stop in once then go for it.\n\nWe all had vanilla with cookie dough and the cookie dough chunks had pretzels in them. That's not bad but it was a little unexpected. All of us would have preferred that the pretzels weren't there.", "author": "Boris S."}

So we headed here to have some ice cream. It's the whole liquid nitrogen thing which is in everywhere it seems, but I was expecting a bit more interesting flavors like some of the other places have. The flavors were pretty standard though.\n\nMy friends kept saying that the owner of the place invented the process of using liquid nitrogen to make ice cream. I really didn't believe that at all, but it turns out they invented some sort of special attachment to a stand mixer to make the ice cream (although if you have liquid nitrogen and a stand mixer at home, one is perfectly capable of doing the exact same thing).\n\nI don't even remember which I had, but I did add the spicy caramel which was actually quite spicy, and I highly recommend it. I also added some sort of nuts. So overall I paid about 9 bucks for ice cream that really wasn't amazingly memorable (except for the caramel).\n\nSo while it's good ice cream, the price tag just seems way to high to justify repeat visits. However, when you're drunk, maybe that idea will be different...", "author": "Grant T."}

It's such great ice cream and you can enjoy it at the cute little park right across from it. I've been to a similar place called creamistry down south and this place is so much better. It's creamier and less icier. The only thing that I'm not such a huge fan of is their few selections of Flavors. At least at creamistry you could customize your own ice cream. It's probably because this place is so small and is in a small area, but I think their business would go up more if they had more than 4 flavors a day. But all in all the quality of their ice cream is great. The small goes a long way! I got the regular last time and it was just way too much ice cream! \n\nAlso, it's kinda hard to find parking.

I mean, I've scooped through over 60 flavors of ice cream in those past three summers ranging from Vanilla to Rock n' Pop Swirl Sherbet. What could possibly surprise or impress me after that? \n\nWell, consider me impressed. I didn't find the flavor to be too special (lemon gingersnap), but the texture of the ice cream elicited a double take from me. So smooth!! They use some special patented technology to whip their liquid nitrogen into tiny crystals that result in smooth ice cream but this smoothness also affects the experience of biting through the ice cream. Instead of your teeth digging through rough layers of ice cream, they effortlessly glide through the ice cream which is an experience unlike any I've ever had with ice cream. The first time I ate it, I was honestly confused and not quite sure that I had eaten ice cream. Whatever technology they are using to make this ice cream smooth, it's working. \n\nBeyond that, the store gets points for atmosphere. It's located next to a park that just puts you in the mood for ice cream. And they state that they are committed to sustainability which is always a plus for me. They also use Square credit card readers, giving them a super contemporary feel to them. \n\nDefinitely worth a try.", "author": "Philip W."}

Vanilla ice cream made w/ liquid nitrogen, brown sugar caramel, pistachio brittle, and whipped cream. Faithful to chocolate as I am, I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth, light, and creamy the vanilla was! Surely, one of the best vanilla ice creams I've had. Now the brown sugar caramel was sweet but complimented the light vanilla nicely. The pistachio brittle was my favorite part of the sundae. Just the right balance of nut and crunch. My soul was happy. \n\nSo the gimmicks of Smitten definitely attract the crowd. Using liquid nitrogen, for one. Two, the place is an old ship container, cleaned out and simply decorated to make it into the green-friendly ice cream shack it is (all cups and spoons are compostable as well). San Francisco WOULD be the city to appreciate Smitten's character. Lastly, the liquid nitrogen ice cream machine is named Kelvin (get it?!) and that tickled the science nerd in me. Lol. \n\nThe ice cream is a few more dollars than I'm used to, but I'll give the quality the credit. The shack doesn't have tables but is lined with benches.

I get a kick out of the experience of watching the ice cream being made, and I just love the plain chocolate flavor on a waffle cone. It's way better than gelato. It melts pretty quickly, though. I wouldn't suggest jumping back in your car and attempting to flee the scene, ice cream in hand - which is what I did and ended up with a lot of the ice cream on my shirt and all over my hand instead of in my stomach, where it should've landed. \n\nI've told my kids about it.

The ice cream is fresh, melts-in-your-mouth smooth and made right in front of you, with a pretty awesome spectacle of liquid nitrogen being poured onto the ice cream machines. We were here on a Saturday night at around 10:30 pm for late-night dessert and there was a pretty long line outside the place! There's some seating area inside the place but there's enough open space outside to hang out and devour your ice cream. There was also some street art installations nearby that were pretty interesting.\n\nNow to the fun part! Their flavors are seasonal and not too many, but do NOT let that bring you down. They are more than enough! We tried three of their flavors - TCHO 60.5% chocolate, fresh mint chip and blue bottle espresso - and boy oh boy were they mind-blowing!!! If the espresso was super coffee-y, the mint chip was unlike any mint ice cream I have ever had. It was like eating fresh mint leaves in ice cream form. No other way to describe it. And the TCHO chocolate, what can I say - it was like eating a chocolate bar that melted while in your mouth. We loved the chocolate and mint chip ice cream so much, we just HAD to get back in line to get some pint boxes of ice cream to take back home to the south bay!! I will be back as often as possible!", "author": "Spry I."}

Each flavor is made with liquid nitrogen in its respective machine so only one serving can be made at a time. (So if you order a popular flavor, be prepared to wait.)

Mind you, it was still good, but at the end, I was tasting more vinegar than anything.   I ended up at Bi-Rite, which I also love and still do, and got a lot more ice cream for less.  The quality is really no different to me, so as much as I did like Smitten, I'd still probably recommend Bi-Rite out of the two.", "author": "Caroline K."}

Slow your roll, Smitten; you aren't the only belle at the ball.\n\nThe first time I came here, I was transfixed. Hayes Valley is already one of my favorite places to visit in SF so ice cream in HV must be just as amazing, right? Right. It was my first time (like I said) and I was completely taken in by all the bells and whistles. Even though the two cities in which I Yelp-lived (Chicago and Miami) both have liquid nitrogen ice cream spots, I hadn't been to either. This was my first trip to the rodeo. As I waited in line, I crafted my order. The menu wasn't too outrageous in terms of selection, so I was betting that execution was the bread & butter here. I opted for the TCHO Chocolate ice cream with brown sugar caramel, whipped cream and cinnamon short bread. The young lady taking my order was impressed with my flavor combo prowess. No need to be impressed, my dear; it's what I do. I topped it all off with a Fred water because I would need something to cut all that sweet and I liked the flask shape of the bottle. I came for the show and stayed for the taste. The ice cream was good, the topping were better and the experience was sound. Yay.\n\nAnd, then I came back.\n\nThe lines were much longer. The crowd didn't move. The people behind the counter were completely over it all. Ruh roh. Checking to see what flavor I would choose, I decided on the earl grey. Because I'd just had a large lunch, I settled on just the ice cream. I paid. I gave my name. I waited. And, I waited. And, I waited a little more. After seeing folks who came after me get served, I asked one of the workers if my order was coming up. He rolled his eyes. Remembering that CA is a three-strikes state and I needed to be careful, I resisted the urge to 'bless' him. I asked again. He rolled his eyes again, sighed and asked what I ordered. I told him. He looked at me indignantly and said that he called my name and gave order already. Granted, my name is pretty common. But I was standing by the counter the entire time with my gaze fixed on the ice cream. There's no way I missed my name/order. The place was crowded, yes, but I was as close to the ice cream as I could be without making it. \n\nI told him that what he said may be the case but there I stood: name the same and no ice cream. His co-worker chuckled and said she could make me a cup or I could take a mint chocolate chip that she had ready then. 1.) If I wanted that, I would have ordered it; 2.) isn't that someone else's order? 3.) i am too old to sit here in this 2x2 space arguing over ice cream I've already paid for. I took it, left and decided that I'd probably not be back to the place that made such a fantastic first impression.

How cool is that!?! Seriously, it's difficult to find a place that makes ice-cream in that unique fashion. You can also see the process happening which can also be another cool ice-cream experience.\n\nSince they have limited flavors using seasonal ingredients, you may have a difficult choice because some flavors just might not touch your fancy. The choices I had during my visit were: Ginger Peach, Vanilla with cinnamon, TCHO chocolate, and Very Mint with Chocolate Chip. \n\nI ordered a small size (enough if you're just checking the place out and want something small). I chose VERY MINT WITH CHOCOLATE CHIP and have never regretted it since! My first bite was \"Oh man, am I chewing on mint leaves?\" I kid you not, the ice-cream tasted like actual mint leaves (not artificial flavoring). You can also tell by the color of the ice-cream, it was white with a small green glow to it (probably the natural mint leaves). Add to that random bits of chocolate chips and you're in absolute heaven!!! The texture of the ice-cream was soft and smooth (the crisp chocolate chips gave a nice, different touch in texture whenever you bit into them). \n\nSo yes, if you're ever in San Francisco, be sure to check this ice-cream shop at least once just to check it out.

We waited about 5 minutes after ordering to receive our ice cream.\n\nMy friend and I ordered:\n\nsmall vanilla  + TCHO krispies ($5.70) - the ice cream was soft and creamy with good vanilla flavor. It didn't taste artificial. The TCHO krispies are basically rice krispies covered in chocolate. Think Crunch bars. They put the krispies underneath the top scoop of ice cream which I didn't like because the arrangement made it difficult to eat the topping with the ice cream. I would have liked more krispies - especially since toppings are .75 extra. The krispies serving size was lacking.\n\nsmall mint + brown sugar caramel ($5.70) - this ice cream was also soft and creamy like the vanilla, so Smitten has good consistency with their products. The taste of fresh mint leaves was evident in the ice cream. However, I didn't like this because I could taste the plant \"leaf\" flavor rather than just the \"mint\" flavor. Who wants to eat leaves?Brown sugar caramel was delicious, but again, I feel that the topping serving size was too small for the price.\n\nIf I was to come back, I would order a regular ($6) and split with a friend instead of ordering two smalls to save money.

So in a first, I guess I literally walked inside of a food stand.\n\nThe prices, relative to the sizes available, almost scared me off.  But, it's not like I'm going to be here for awhile again, so I didn't turn away.  For the size I'd be happy with, it cost $10, but I went with the $6 option instead, having hibiscus.  It'd probably be worth the $6 if it were the size of the $10 one.\n\nIt was definitely a one of a kind ice cream, and in fact is likely the smoothest ice cream I have ever had.  I would recommend coming here to give it a try and have this experience, but probably wouldn't make it a frequent stop due to the value issue.

That and it takes longer to make ice cream from scratch. But it definitely didn't help that the cashier was surly about taking orders, but again she was likely stressed from having to work after Xmas. \n\nWhile I'm not opposed to the whole trend of ice cream made to order (Ice Cream Lab in Beverly Hills does a pretty good job of it), I felt like the ice cream retained too much of the frosty texture and it makes for a less satisfying scoop overall. Also, the scoop was way too small for the price. \n\nI guess it was a perfect storm of things going wrong because as we moved up in line, they started erasing flavors off the board. We opted for Mint Chip and it was definitely exactly as advertised but perhaps too much so. If you really love the taste of mint leaves then you'll enjoy this. If you want subtle minty flavor coupled with the sweetness of chocolate you'll probably be disappointed. That mint aftertaste certainly sticks with you the rest of the night and gives you an idea of how overpowering the mint flavor really is.\n\nI had high hopes for Smitten but ultimately was let down on my first try here.

And I love their business card!\n\nI've been three blocks away from Smitten's Hayes Valley location since its opening in April 2011... it took me a year to get over there. One reason is there aren't a lot of flavors.  On any given day they probably have four goin' on, and two of those are going to be chocolate (TCHO... but still, chocolate) and plain ol' vanillla.  I don't blame them; they have four Kelvins and it takes awhile to fire up (ice down?) the ice cream.  And possibly because they use liquid nitro, the ice cream melts much faster.  Or it could be the recipe.  Or both.\n\nI had the rhubarb crisp (rhubarb extract blended with vanilla ice cream and chunks of Batter Bakery's cookies).  It was okay.

Best of all, they make every ice cream order INDIVIDUALLY and they're probably the only place that does this.   I read on the wall which explains the science behind the ice cream that using liquid nitrogen produces smaller ice crystals, producing a super smooth texture.  Indeed, it's true; the ice cream did come out smoother than normal ice cream!\n\nWhat we tried:\n\nVanilla with spicy caramel sauce: the vanilla was the smoothest vanilla I've ever had.  The spicy caramel sauce was good, it was just sweet enough with a kick of chili pepper at the end.\n\nSalted Caramel with TCHO chocolate sauce: the ice cream wasn't that salty, but it was still good and the chocolate sauce was to die for!\n\nMaple Brown Sugar Squash: This was a very complex ice cream but I loved how you could taste every component, the squash (similar to pumpkin), maple and brown sugar all stood out on their own.  They drizzle some type of maple sauce on top, which is good but dripped all over our hands because we got a cone so I'd suggest getting a cup with this\n\n3 small ice creams with 2 extra sauces and 1 cone came out to ~$17, not cheap but definitely worth the experience and the unique flavors.\n\nOh, might I add, they use organic milk and locally grown ingredients? 5 STARS!!!", "author": "Michelle W."}

But as a food experience it's quite a memorable one. I felt like I was eating something created from a Nickelodeon TV show. Slime Time!\n\nSmitten is a tiny, little, hip ice creamery open-faced kiosk. There's one liquid nitrogen ice cream machine per flavor, with about four-six flavors going at the same time. There are toppings to be added after the ice cream has been created for additional charge. They don't mix flavors or serve two flavors together, but I guess you can order two orders and smash them together. Everything is made to order. This is half the fun. Including the hipsters who look like they want to punch you in the throat.\n\nI had the lemon meyer ginger snap cookie ice cream. I love the lemony flavor. The standout yum factor was from the still crispy ginger snap cookie crumbs. Since the liquid nitrogen creates the ice cream so fast the cookie crumbs don't have enough time to sog up. I'm on the fence about the consistency and mouthfeel of the ice cream. Even though it's a creamy consistency, it reminds me of cake batter or buttercream frosting. It's strangely almost too rich.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-15", "description": "I am attracted by the science behind making this ice cream! They say the idea is freezing ice cream at super low temperatures with liquid nitrogen could create a smoother product in faster time. Theres something about less ice crystals in the ice cream making the ice cream texture feel smoother. Each scoop is made to order, therefore no emulsifiers and preservatives are added creating an ice cream that does not compromise taste for shelf life.\n\nEnough of the geek talk, lets talk about the ice cream! They have their usual vanilla and chocolate, 1 flavor that alternates weekly (I think) and 1 flavor that changes monthly, and that is their seasonal flavor. My favorite seasonal flavor is the Earl Grey with Milk Chocolate served in February! The chocolate they use are from TCHO, a local chocolate factory that I got a free tour when they were still in San Francisco by the pier. All of their ingredients are advertised as locally sourced which is great. Earl Grey with Milk Chocolate tastes like eating a cup of creamy Earl Grey tea with a bar of dark chocolate, but in ice cream form! So good. My 2nd favorite is the Olive Oil with Lavender Shortbread which is served in June. You'd think olive oil in ice cream is freaky? I had this kind of concoction the first time in a restaurant called Beretta and it blew my mind. Its hard to explain, but the olive oil brought out the fragrance and creaminess in the ice cream and the ice cream brought out the richness of the olive oil. So weird how foods like that can go so well together! My 3rd favorite is one of their weekly flavors that sometimes disappear and that is the Mint Chip! Its made with fresh spearmint leaves infused into the cream with a light green color and TCHO chocolate chips churned in! Your breath will smell so fresh for the rest of the day after eating this one. I love it!

The novelty is watching the old fashioned (and typically jamming) mixers make your ice cream batch right in front of you with liquid nitrogen.\n\nBut come on, you do realize that you could make ice cream at home with a bag of ice and vanilla mix -- it's the classic jr high science experiment. But the process is slow and non-scalable, and I don't mind that a company like Ben and Jerry's has a bigger version of this that I can't see.\n\nI digress.\n\nThere is one redeeming factor: They have Tcho (pronounced 'cho') ice cream popsicles. This is my regular -- to enjoy a soft Tcho ice cream popsicle as my rookie companion fights their way through a stomachache of caramel-nutted-vanilla-bean.\n\nAll in all, one of the better of the 'hyped up' ice cream parlors in SF, and a fun spot for your date since it's on the border of a cool little park you can walk around.

I've tried the hyped ice cream places in SF- Bi-Rite, Humphrey Slocombe, Mitchell's, etc... but none have captivated me as much as Smitten.\n\nReasons for its awesomeness:\n_Creativity. I love that they make your ice cream to order. It's like an upscale, amazing Coldstone's. (I cringe to include that name in my review because there is no comparison.) \n_Fresh and flavorful. I tried the Nectarine and the Vanilla with cocoa nib pralines, which was suggested on the menu. The nectarines were super fresh (well, what do you expect when they probably threw in fresh chopped fruit!) The cocoa nibs were my favorite sweet in a long time- roughly chopped, crunchy, a shot of intense bittersweet chocolate, and some nutty flavor too. YUM!!\n_Cool factor- I really like watching the liquid nitrogen. It satisfies my inner molecular gastronomy side. I feel like a kid at the exploratorium.\n\nPossible avenues for improvement:\n_Price- considering each cup is made to order, not that pricey... but cheaper=always better. The portions are not that big.\n_More mix-ins. Nectarines would be great with some caramel or toffee or brown sugar bits. Chocolate pieces would go well too with some of the other flavors.", "author": "Cathy S."}

(+1 star for the tech)\n\nCONS:\n- The consistency was mushy and soft. How do you fail the texture test when you're blasting the mix with -320 degree F liquid nitrogen?\n- The TCho 60% chocolate had the same flavor as a Wendy's Frosty, which isn't bad if you're at Wendy's but this wasn't Wendy's. They also used a very high concentration of heavy cream (I make my own ice cream as a hobby), which made the ice cream super buttery and more Wendy's Frosty-like.\n- The Plain Vanilla was super bland (not enough vanilla extract) and used too much regular milk to the point that it tasted like Skim Milk ice cream with a hint of Vanilla.\n- I would rather eat ice cream from super overrated Humphry Slocombe than Smitten that's how meh it was.\n- There was about a 30-40 minute wait but I guess that is unavoidable on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n- There are so many other places in SF that serve better ice cream it isn't even funny.

The maple brown sugar squash was Smitten's seasonal flavor for October, and is my favorite of the 3 flavors I've tried so far.  It basically tasted like pumpkin ice cream.  \n\nAnother tip:  Smitten does not have carry out containers for their single serving ice cream sizes and will just put another cup on the top of your ice cream scoop.  If you'll be traveling for more than 10 minutes, your ice cream will start to melt, overflowing the cup and dripping all over you.

It's located in Hayes Valley by a street that has lots of nice restaurants. It's a perfect place to grab dessert after a meal! The store is literally made from a shipping container, so there is not indoor seating. It's more like a booth with an outdoor seating area. The environment was nice, hip, and clean.\n\nThere are usually a few flavors of ice cream a day with a selection of toppings and add-ons. The ice cream is made when you order and the brrristas churn out the ice cream on the spot using liquid nitrogen and an ice cream machine! Because the ice cream is made to order and not stored in a freezer, the ice cream is very creamy.\n\nI tried a size small fresh mint ice cream and added cinnamon shortbread ($5.50). My boyfriend had the toffee pudding ice cream and added cinnamon shortbread ($5.50). The mint was delicious, the flavor was light and tasted like real mint leaves. The toffee pudding ice cream was also very good. It had a strong toffee flavor and much sweeter than the mint flavor. Both were really yummy and went well with the cinnamon shortbread. I was also told by the staff that Smitten uses organic and local ingredients, so that's another plus.\n\nThe service and environment was great. The staff was informative and super friendly.

To add a topping and make it a cone (+ $0.50, +$1.00 each), my friend and I paid $12.xx total for our ice cream. We went there around 1:30pm and they only had vanilla and the brown sugar with cinnamon shortbread left. We had one of each with their recommended topping (caramel and cinnamon, respectively). \n\nThe line was quick but the order took about 10 minutes. That was because they have 3 patented churners in total and only 2 were operating, one for each flavor. I believe the machine for the vanilla was a newer model so they were still playing around with it. I saw that the worker (may have been new) attempted to make a batch of vanilla twice, but this older worker (may have been the manager) came by and looked at it and in the end, had to make it himself. \n\nI love the idea of using liquid nitrogen to make the ice cream! The consistency was somewhere between regular ice cream and gelato -- the creaminess wasn't overwhelming and it wasn't too sweet! \n\nThe best part is that every scoop is made to order and the way the manager overlooked the quality of the ice cream made me feel rest assured :)\n\nThe one star deducted was for the homemade cone. Personally, it tasted more like a cookie/biscuit than a waffle cone. It was also a tad sweet and since the ice cream was already sweet, I thought the cone would have complimented better if it wasn't as sweet.

I loooooved the hibiscus flavor and bf also looooved t-cho SO much that he was licking the entire cup dry when he was done. I've never seen him do that before...definitely a sight.\nOverall I was very pleased with the ice cream sold here and will probably crave it soon.", "author": "Cathy C."}

I went here for the first time today because my friend was raving about how yummy their ice cream were. There were four flavors available to choose from and I decided I wanted the mint chip whereas my friend ordered the creme fraiche. The lady at the register didn't tell us that we had to wait about 10-15 minutes but I overheard her telling other people so I knew. \n\nThere are only a few flavors available everyday because there is only limited space for a couple of people to work at, each focusing on a specific flavor. So I waited in the station where the mint chip was made and my friend waited at where the creme fraiche was made. My friend got her order in less than 10 minutes. The guy working at her station was quick and knew what he was doing, he was calling out names practically every minute. \n\nAs my friend was eating her delicious ice cream, I was waiting at my mint chip station. 10 minutes went by.. three people by now at the mint chip station have questioned the worker about whether or not their orders were coming. After waiting 15 minutes I realized that this lady at the mint chip station has not called out a single freaking name. I began watching her and saw that she was working a snail pace. She was taking her sweet time cleaning the stations around her and forgetting all about the ice cream she had to make. After a batch was finished freezing, it took her another couple of minutes to come back to the station and serve it. \n\nBy now the guy at the creme fraiche station has called out 20 orders. My friend and I was standing there in disbelief.. At one point a guy at the chocolate station next to her tried to help serve the batch of mint chip that was frozen and ready to serve when the mint chip lady quickly stepped in front of him telling him that she has it under control. The chocolate guy stepped back with his hands in the air signaling that he will back off. She placed the batch behind her and then stepped off somewhere in the back! A minute later, the creme fraiche guy picked up a spoon and tried to serve the mint chip onto a cup because he noticed it was just sitting there and then the mint chip lady reappeared and snatched the spoon out of his hand and told him not to touch it. What.. the.. bleep.. \n\nI got my order after a 30 minute wait. I will never again order ice cream from the station where the girl with the short blonde hair is working at. Ever. The mint chocolate chip ice cream was good, the mint taste is pretty strong. But what I witnessed while waiting for my ice cream made my lose my appetite. I was standing there for 30 minutes wishing that I ordered another flavor. \n\nMinus one star for the mint chip lady who really needs to get it together. Minus another star for the system that they have, it is really easy to mess up an order. I saw several people complain about how their names were missed or that they ordered it on a cone rather than a cup.", "author": "Kawai N."}

We loved it so much that we drove back the following weekend (we live in San Jose) to get more sweet corn before the month was over. \n\nSince last August we've returned various times and have tried a number of other flavors, which we've found to be really hit or miss. They seem to have a lot of fruity flavors, which aren't really my thing. The brown sugar and salted caramel are pretty tasty though -- and the waffle cones are out of this world!\n\nI absolutely love the concept of this shop and the staff are pretty friendly. I wish they carried more flavors, though I totally understand why they can't. \n\nAnyway, fast forward to August again. My husband and I have been counting down to sweet corn ice cream for weeks. Two weeks ago we drove to San Francisco and were totally bummed to see they actually didn't have any sweet corn ice cream. Last weekend we wised up and called ahead before leaving San Jose and again were disappointed, but at least we hadn't driven all the way there. Yesterday we called ahead and alas -- they had it. We called right around 11 AM when they opened and headed to San Francisco shortly after that. My husband and I had planned to go for a run first. so we went for a quick one along the bay, looking forward to our ice cream reward. \n\nWe arrived at Smitten at around 2 PM and guess what? No sweet corn ice cream! (I should have listened to my husband when he suggested we get ice cream BEFORE running, but I don't like running with a full stomach and thought it would be a nice reward). \n\nI know there are some things that are out of the shop's control when it comes to flavors, but I'm super disappointed. If you're going to have a flavor of the month -- offer it all month, not on sporadic days. I know we should have just gone right to Smitten yesterday, but really, it was Saturday. Did they not stock up enough to last all day? And if not, why didn't they tell me there were limited quantities when I called? Sigh. Looks like I'll just have to wait until next year.", "author": "Nicole L."}

The have a patented ice cream chruner (the \"Kelvin\"), they use to make the ice cream right in front of you.  The end result is the smoothest ice cream you ever had.\n\nBecause it's individually made, there's only 4 flavors as there's only 4 Kelvins.   The flavors were subtle, not as strong as other ice creams, but I'll trade that for the lack of ice in the ice cream.  They have a variety of toppings as well.\n\nWe tried the passion fruit, vanilla and chocolate.  All were very flavorful.  The vanilla with the brown sugar topping was killer.  I had the passion fruit with the vanilla bread topping which wasn't such a great combo.  The ice cream just melts in your mouth.\n\nNot cheap, but understandable when you consider each batch is individually made.  Should cost more than the mass-produced ice cream at most other places.\n\nSmitten is certainly different and unique and I can understand the mixed reviews.  So unique you should try it for yourself.  For me, loved it, especially compared the frozen ice creams you get at most ice cream places.", "author": "Steve G."}

There were only 3 flavours available so by default we chose mint chip, 60% chocolate, and maple brown sugar pumpkin. I think there are usually 4 flavours but maybe they were out of blue bottle espresso.\nIn order of best to least best: chocolate, mint chip, and pumpkin.\nThe chocolate is very creamy, like a hot chocolate but not hot. Theres no other way of putting it other than it tastes expensive. It's not your convenience store chocolate. More like the inside of a dark chocolate Lindor truffle. Yeah. That's it. Double thumbs up.\nI'm not usually a fan of mint chip ice cream. I often find it too sweet but in a weird mint toothpaste plus sugar sort of way. The usual colour is also very off putting, does not help with the toothpaste imagery. Smitten's mint chip, however, was quite refreshing, You can taste the actual mint flavour and the sweetness does not overpower the mint. The chocolate pieces were also yum. Dark chocolate maybe? Pleasant surprise.\nThe pumpkin was the most anticipated but my least favourite. I'm usually a huge fan of pumpkin pie so I thought I would love it but it was way too sweet. Maybe it was the sugar syrup on top but it was way too much. I was unpleasantly reminded of a PSL, all sugary creamy sadness topped with cinnamon, the kind of overpowering sweet makes you want to stop drinking halfway. It wasn't that bad and I was able to finish it, but if the scoop had been any larger, I may have lost the battle.\nI would come again if in the area and it was a special occasion but if I were a local, I'd rather get a large Costco tub than go out.

Not only the wait was crazy long  (the line moved so slow as we discovered later on that their machines were broken )  but the variety of the ice cream has significant shrunken. A year before, they used to have at least 4 favors  for you to select now it downs to only TWO, Vanilla and Olive oil ! Neither were that good. \n\nMy uncles who died to tried Smitten (it's their first time).

The queue was long but quick. I waited for about 5 minutes. The taste was absolutely perfect, better than Bi-Rite dare I say. However, unlike regular ice cream, LN2 ice cream melts faster so I was looking to scooping more bites into my mouth faster than I wanted to. \n\nIf you want to compost your cup and spoon, hand it back to the cashier.

They may need more than the 4 \"Kelvin\" ice cream making machines. It was an experience though, watching my made to order ice cream being blended with clouds of vapors emitting from their machine. They had a unique \"register\" of an iPad where your card is scanned through an attached card reader and you sign your name with your fingers directly onto the iPad screen. (Why can't the mobile food trucks do this too?!)\n\nThree to four minutes later I had my strawberry ice cream in one hand and the shovel-like spoon in the other. Hubs had the salted caramel which I liked better than my strawberry. Texture was smooth, rich and creamy. I'm a fan of their salted caramel.  \n\nIm not docking for prices but I'd have to agree with the others. Their ice cream is on the pricey side. Maybe a dollar too steep...?", "author": "Esther A."}

That means a few things.\n\nThe +'s:\n+ Ice cream is freshly gassed with nitrogen and not sitting on a supermarket shelf with additives I can't pronounce and stuff like xantham gum\n+ Flavors rotate and on my last visit I sampled carrot cake. Shocked to taste real bits of carrot and it wasn't bad!\n+ Servings are Euro-sized meaning no massive insane scoops\n\nThe -'s:\n- The frozen state doesn't hold as long as real gelato. I get the same creamy consistency but it seems to melt pretty quickly. Good thing I tend to eat fast anyways.\n- Lines get long. You have to wait for your ice cream to get gassed before you can dive into it.\n\nOverall I love the concept and that it's an alternative to pastries at La Boulangerie, candies at Miette and macarons at Paulette.

Not one (in my opinion at least) measures up to the heavenly status of Smitten. If you get ice cream anywhere in San Francisco, do it at smitten. Not only is the quality and flavor way more fulfilling, the experience of seeing it made before your eyes is a million times more exciting than standing in an hour long line.\n\nTake note, there are usually long lines (still worth it), and only 4 flavors a day. I have tried about 5 of their flavors so far and am still head over heels in love with their CHOCOLATE. I'm not typically a chocolate ice cream type of girl, but at Smitten, it is all I have eyes for. Rich and decadent, one scoop of Smitten's choco ice cream is like eating creamy melted chocolate-the best damn melted chocolate you've ever had.

The sun had just come out after some morning rain, and the line hadn't caught up yet. Also, I'd heard about the liquid nitrogen gimmick. I'm a sucker for that sort of thing. So I hopped in line and got myself a small scoop of the flavor of the day -- creme fraiche with pear caramel.\n\nIt really was pretty good. Dense but soft, and very creamy. I did find a couple of icy chunks in the scoop, though. I could feel the milk fat on my tongue, but the richness wasn't excessive; maybe the slight tartness of the creme fraiche was keeping it in check. The pear caramel was just slightly too sweet for me, but pretty heavy on the pear.\n\nWorth trying if the line isn't too crazy.", "author": "Nath A."}

Tastewise, I couldn't tell it was made differently, but it's such a fun procedure to watch that I'm willing to fork over the extra money to have that experience. There were four flavors the day I went: salted caramel (which I tried), chocolate, vanilla and the seasonal apple crisp. The ice cream itself was great -- rich, sweet with a hint of the savory salt to balance the caramel flavor.\n\nIt has an adorable little stall in a great Hayes Valley location, right next to Aether Apparel.

I felt the Vanilla almost tasted marshmellowy and the consistency was slightly rich, but seemingly whipped, maybe due to the quick process. The caramel topping was very sweet, and took me by surprise mainly because I have been used to salted caramel/burnt caramel flavors (I like making creme brulee flavors). \n\nWhile not my favorite of SF (honor belongs to Mr & Mrs), I would rate this behind Mitchells and Birite and maybe tied with Humphry.", "author": "Marc T."}

A bit softer and creamier but bold and vibrant flavors without being too in your face or strange for the sake of being strange.  Loved it, even in the dead of winter.\n\nWe tried all 4 flavors - Vanilla, Meyer Lemon Ginger snap, Salted Caramel and Dark Chocolate.  Salted caramel often goes overboard with salt, and ends up tasting rather like vomit. No one wants ice cream that someone has already eaten.  But, this... this is just fantastic, a hint of saltiness, no nasty \"oops I left the marshmallow on the fire too long and it burnt to nothing but coal\" flavor.  It was sweet with a hint of salt and some complexity from the sugars... loved it.  Topped with the pistachio brittle, it was heaven in my mouth.  The vanilla was excellent too, extremely creamy while rich flavored but not too heavy or greasy on the mouth.  Perfect for toppings.  The Meyer lemon was almost too bitter for me, but if you like lemon, get this.  The Chocolate was rich and decadent, not too sweet but also not slap you in the face with a 2x4 bitter.

No explanation at all from them and they knew we were waiting for them to open.\n\nSo we were second in line. Seriously about 25 minutes later we still did not have our order and everyone after us did, it was so weird. The guy who was first in line went to counter same time I did and we asked where was our ice-cream. We got the rudest customer service ever. I was so shocked. Whoever the girl was behind the counter with the shaved head, needs a quick reality check on how customer service works.

I finally forced myself to go because PayPal had a deal at the spot, $5 woo! The flavors available were vanilla, mint chip, and blood orange with pistachio shortbread. Note that you have to wait while they 'make' your ice cream with liquid nitrogen. \n\nMy friend ordered a small mint chip for $4.75 and because I thought I'd get my $5, I went all out with the medium $6 blood orange with caramel sauce (+$0.50). I was confused when I was charged $7... and learned that their 'seasonal' flavors cost $0.50 extra... because they're sourcing seasonal produce? I thought that was odd since I assume produce that's out of season is more expensive. And then of course, PayPal failed to work with their system... so I paid $7 for three small scoops of ice cream. Very pricey in my opinion.\n\nOnto the ice cream itself. First the good - the blood orange was very tasty. It was like having a super fancy creamsicle with the nice crunch of buttery pistachios and shortbread. The caramel was also good, but added too much sweetness/richness for my taste.\n\nThe mint chip though, which I was told is their most popular flavor, was interesting with its mint-infused cream. Definitely a different flavor, which wasn't bad in and of itself. The texture however was AWFUL. It was icy - more like a snow cone and the whole thing was just so watery ... it's as if they used water mixed with some cream. And I'm pretty sure it has to do with their liquid nitrogen process ... and the fact that they leave the ice cream custard sitting around in bottles... it's possible/probably the cream at bottom of the bottle began to separate, which led to watery watery ice cream.\n\nAnyway, overall, I'd say it was pretty disappointing. Very pricey and a long wait - for ice cream that is very tasty at best and grossly similar to an icee at worst.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-07-21", "description": "Smitten has a lot going for it: interesting liquid-nitrogen ice cream process, incredibly fresh ingredients, and a nice neighborhood within which to be planted. As cool as the process is, however, there are some drawbacks: the wait is much longer than it needs to be (especially with an already long Summer day line), there are only 4 flavors, and you can't get more than 1 flavor in your cup/cone. \n\nSome may say these are necessary evils for amazing ice cream, but I say that the ice cream really isn't THAT amazing to warrant the long lines and flavor limitations. You may say \"Well, Bi-Rite and Humphry Slocombe also have tremendously long lines!\" To which I reply: \"Well, I think Bi-Rite and Humphry Slocombe taste much better and there's more to choose from, which justifies the wait. At least more so than Smitten, that is.\"\n\nI got the Mint w/ TCHO Chocolate Chip, which tasted phenomenally fresh. This is the first time I've had mint ice cream that actually tastes like real mint leaves, rather than artificial green-colored flavoring. It was definitely refreshing, but keep in mind that \"fresh\" doesn't always equate to \"delicious,\" especially when it comes to ice cream. \n\nThe texture and consistency is a bit too airy for ice cream -- it lacks that creaminess that puts the \"cream\" in ice cream. I'm sure many people will prefer it to the buttery texture of ice cream like Bi-Rite or Humphry Slocombe, but for me, it's more like the fat-free ice cream knockoffs you find in the diet section of your grocer's freezer. \n\nOf course, I didn't get to try any of the other flavors because of their stupid 1 flavor maximum. \n\nAnyway, Smitten is an interesting addition to the already saturated ice cream market in SF. It's worth trying if you like your ice cream to be a bit lighter and fresher than usual. For me, however, if I'm going out of my way to wait in line for ice cream, all I care about is taste and texture, and in that sense, there are many other better offerings in SF than Smitten.", "author": "Roy C."}

It's like if you took the Philz concept for coffee and applied it to ice cream, you'd have Smitten - ice cream made to order. \n\nBecause of they make the ice cream completely from scratch when you order it, they keep the number of flavors down to four at most that you end up specializing with various toppings. \n\nWhat you get is an extremely dense and creamy ice cream that is free of the ice crystals you find in many other ice creams.

There's no doubt that they have an innovative concept (anything with custom machinery is bound to be a hit here). The question is whether they have staying power.\n\nThey certainly do have the perfect location in Hayes Valley right next to that park with the decaying zombie cyborg woman statue. I also imagine they're not paying much to lease the parking lot land where their converted metal storage box storefront sits. Moreover, given their present popularity and prices I'm sure they'll have no problem recouping the fixed costs of the bespoke liquid nitrogen ice cream makers. Thus we come back to the question of what happens after their first summer?\n\nAnother way to phrase this would be - can the ice cream stand on its own? My answer is it's certainly good, and if I lived in Hayes I'd stop by every now and then, but sadly it's nothing I'd wait 20 minutes in line for. The flavors are intense and the texture is super creamy, but it also melts into soup super quickly (I guess that's the dual edged sword of liquid nitrogen). \n\nIn order for Smitten to become a staple they need to enginner amazing flavors that last with the same creative vigor that they used to create their ice cream makers.", "author": "Max G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-26", "description": "Ok, first, the process is probably the most interesting part of the Smitten experience.  You get to watch the servers take milk, put it in a mixer with liquid nitrogen, and then scrape out someone (you hope it's your) icecream.  \n\nThe board claims that this \"ready in 90 second\" process is supposed to get you less ice crystals and thus creamier, smoother icecream.  \n\nWell, either it was too hot that day, the server didn't do it right, or the process doesn't work, because the ice cream that came out was pretty much exactly the same, if not less creamy, than Humphry and the other places we went to.  \n\nThat said, the mint ice cream was AMAZINGLY minty--as in fresh mint.  Add to that the less sweet base meant a truly refreshing flavor that I'd not tasted before.  The TCHO chocolate topping was very meager, however, and the portion was not huge for the price.  I think it must have something to do with labor intensive process.  \n\nAlso, there were only 3 flavors--again, likely due to the labor-intense, bespoke process.  Smitten compensates by having many toppings, but not many toppings will change the fundamental flavor of the ice cream.  \n\nThe day I went, there were 2 other flavors - chocolate and a honey flavor.  We only tried mint and chocolate.  And while the mint was great, the chocolate was pretty much completely standard.  Sure it was spiced up, no pun intended, with shortbread and some other stuff, but at the end of the day, if we'd not witnessed the process, would likely not have been wow'ed.  \n\nSo, worth going largely for picture taking, and if you're in the hood.

With such a plethora of delicious ice cream places in SF, I didn't really think that I needed to add another to my list.\n\nTonight, I changed my mind, largely because I haven't eaten ice cream in a long time and the delicious smells emanating from the Smitten kitchen were so tantalizing. The two flavors available today were strawberry white balsamic and classic vanilla. After much deliberation I decided to go with classic vanilla with the brown sugar caramel topping and the homemade waffle cone. \n\nThe Husband was skeptical about the effect of liquid nitrogen on the ice cream. Was the difference really noticeable? Well, 60 seconds after our order we found out.\n\nWith my first bite I was...you got it, smitten. The texture of the ice cream is so rich and creamy and smooth. It's like soft serve ice cream with better texture, if that makes sense. The flavor is fantastic with the Madagascar vanilla coming through nice and strong. The brown sugar caramel topping wasn't too sweet and provided a nice complement to the vanilla flavor. The waffle cone with tasty. I liked how it wasn't too crunchy or too soft.\n\nThis is definitely one of the most expensive ice cream places in San Francisco. A small will cost you almost five dollars and a regular will cost you six bucks. This being the case, how does Smitten stack up against the other ice cream places?\n\nWell, the comparable places in San Francisco are probably Bi-Rite, Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous and Humphrey Slocombe because of their creamy factor. These other ice cream places have more creative and interesting flavor combinations and are cheaper. I would say that Bi-Rite is the closest texture-wise but their flavors are more concentrated. What Smitten has going for it is really the liquid nitrogen factor (which really does make the ice cream super-smooth).

The flavors today were TCHO Chocolate, vanilla, blood orange with pistachio shortbread crumbs, and brown butter pecan.\n\nSara P. went for the chocolate, and I opted for blood orange.  Seriously, it smelled like butter.  As in, it was kind of nasty.  It tasted delicious though; sweet, creamy orange ice cream with crumbled pistachio shortbread pieces.  I would've preferred blood orange sorbet in this unseasonably warm weather, but this had great orange flavor.\n\nThe texture of the ice cream itself is very creamy and airy.  It's probably a billion calories, and it melts quicker than I'd like.

I like how we see the icecream made from raw ingredient (milk, vanilla extracts, cacao, ect) happened before my eyes and only within couple minutes. However, the time you wait in line takes a while. It's pretty cool that they are frontier of the idea using mixers to apply liquid nitrogen to cold and finish the ice-cream (these information you could get by reading the summary process written on the boards at the store while waiting for your turn). \n\nThe creamy texture is very smooth n silky, but it also melts very quickly, therefore you should get the coup instead of corn, otherwise I guess you have to bite as fast as you can or it will make a mess. Their menu is different every of weeks (I am not sure), but my fav there is vanilla with lavender shortbread and graham crackers. \n\nGiven small amount, the price is very costly, I only recommend you to try if you haven't tried it, but for usual place to eat ice cream? ~ I don't think so.", "author": "Hallie N."}

Two of the times it was the cone, one time it was both the cone and the topping, and this last time, they were out of an ingredient for the ice cream, so therefore it can't be ordered. \n\nAnd to Vicky L., down below, yes, you did just spend a fiver on a small ice cream...two scoops...and yes, it did smell like butter. On that note, the last time I was there, I asked how many calories were in a small. The people working had no idea. \n\nAnd to my Yelp friend Cherylynn below, I respectfully disagree. This place is not nostalgic (for me at least). My childhood consisted of a forty-cent ice cream from Thrifty's. Or, on a special occasion, a $1.25 ice cream from Swenson's. Can I exchange my childhood for yours? My mother would have made me homemade ice cream when hell froze over, the world was coming to an end, and I cleaned my room, all on the same day.\n\nI think it's novel that the ice cream is made right in front of you, but beware, this means you have to wait around for it. My wait times have averaged about 10 - 12 minutes. It also depends on who has ordered ahead of you of course, too. \n\nAnyway, this review is getting too long and besides the point. It's cool once or twice and then you're over it. That's my summary for this place. Sorry, but I just can't be that impressed, especially when the line takes forever, the creation of the ice cream is slow and inefficient, and the ingredients are out of stock most of the time.\n\nOh, FYI, if you're pregnant, this place rocks apparently.

It's definitely a unique way to experience a classic: after you order, you can stand along the counter and watch the little mixers bubble and brew your sweet treat using liquid nitrogen. \n\nThey have one specialty flavor (which changes every month), along with their three constants: vanilla, TCHO chocolate and salted caramel. When I stopped in, they were offering earl grey with milk chocolate chips. I tried the salted caramel and earl grey, and got one of their homemade waffle cones. The ice cream itself is super creamy, and the flavors were INSANE. I liked their salted caramel here better than Bi-Rite (it tasted less burned), but the star was the earl grey. It was so delicious! The waffle cone was great too.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning I came in with a friend who has severe food allergies (gluten, dairy and soy), and she was so happy with their vegan ice cream pops that she stood in line again for the other flavor! It's great that they cater to all types of eaters here.\n\nThe only frustrating thing I found with Smitten was that you can't order two flavors at the same time. By that I mean you can't have one scoop of one and one of the other: to get two flavors you have to order two separate scoops in different cups. A little silly if you ask me.  \n\nBut, no matter - Smitten is one of the most unique and delicious ice cream places I've ever been to.

It piqued our curiosity, so we stopped to see what all the hubbub was about.  And yes, it is built out of a shipping container.

Nothing over the top special, although it is good.  But you will be paying a very high premium price for ice cream that is \"just good,\" and the portions you get are VERY small.

So, ok, maybe there weren't any drugs, but the ice cream was so deliciously creamy that it could have been the same.\n\nThe taste of the salty caramel was a perfect blend of savory and sweet. The TCHO Chocolate was mouth watering.

If you've never seen this before, then, sure, come take a look. But since ice cream is frozen, regardless of the process, a creamery can use as fresh ingredients as they'd like to. \n2) This also means you can't taste flavors beforehand... which for me is half the fun of going out for ice cream as opposed to just buying a pint at the grocery store.\n3) I personally like to choose from more than 3 flavors.\n\nAs for my ice cream, I got the tcho chocolate with meyer lemon caramel and pistachio brittle. I wasn't too impressed with the brittle and I guess I didn't know what to expect from the meyer lemon caramel, but I had wished it was more caramel-y.

Although the customization availabilities are limited to toppings. We ordered the fresh mint chip and the blood orange with pistachio short bread. \n\nThe fresh mint chip was honestly too light for me, and I wished the mint was a little more potent. The blood orange with pistachio short bread was my favorite! The flavor was bold, not too sweet and the short bread was amazing. \n\nHowever, I wish the texture was a little more firm. I feel like if ice cream is too that it melts faster and it also seemed as though they may have used heavy cream in their base (hence the lighter consistency) which for me means even more fat than regular milk. \n\nAnother thing that I was not too fond of was seeing that they did not even rinse out the bowls after each use. Instead you could see the ice cream stuck around the edges of the bowl, on the base of the mixer and on the whisks used to make each individual batch. This explains why they only have 4 flavors each day but hopefully they will find a way to keep their work space more tidy. \n\nOverall, it's worth trying so that you get to watch the process behind LN2 ice cream, but I think there is still room for improvement.", "author": "Danielle L."}

Sister had heard of Smitten before, and said she had wanted to try it. So we did. We all got singles of various flavors, ritual coffee, vanilla with cocoa nib pralines and coconut with sesame brittle. Prices were a bit steep, at $4.75 each + tax (=total was over $15), for one little ball of ice cream. \n\nWe originally asked if we could just have different scoops of different flavors in one, but the guy refused because he said each scoop is made on its own. We saw the girls pouring the cream into mixers and used liquid nitrogen to make our ice cream. It was pretty cool, but it wasn't amazing or anything. Each one came out one by one, and as we were waiting for the others, it started melting really quickly! No wonder why it was impossible to get a triple scoop in one container! \n\nRitual coffee tasted like really strong coffee. Coconut with sesame brittle, tasted like straight coconut milk, not sweet enough with little crunch from the sesame brittle and vanilla w/ cocoa nib pralines was probably my favorite because it was most sweet, and I usually like it when there's some sort of texture in my ice cream. All were really creamy, but melted too quickly.\n\nAll in all, you're paying for magical ice cream made in front of your face and you will watch it magically melt the quickest you probably have seen ice cream melt, EVER.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-31", "description": "This is some expensive ice cream.\n\nFor those who don't know, the idea is to instantly freeze your ice cream, on the spot, when you order it, using special machines and some very cold liquid nitrogen.  It takes a while to do this.  It understandably costs a lot.\n\nWhat I am less clear on is *why*.  Why would you go to the trouble to do this?\n\nThere's another shop, in Chicago, called iCream, which does something similar.  Rather than four all-natural flavors and custom mixers, they use retrofitted kitchen-aid appliances and offer a dazzling variety of ingredient options.  They have a reason to mix on the spot: they are willing to create almost any combination you ask for - hundreds or maybe thousands of possible flavors.  Smitten, not so much.  They generally offer four flavors with some small number of possible added ingredients.\n\nHaving said that, the ice cream is generally good.  We've tried salted caramel and a plum flavor.  The texture is excellent: smooth and creamy; much better than iCream, and a vindication of the custom mixer technology.  The flavors are okay - the salted caramel flavors came through strong and clear.  The flavors of the plum were muted, though we could detect some plum in there.\n\nThe place is definitely interesting for the novelty, but I can't see that it offers much more than the many other more conventional boutique shops in SF in terms of flavor, texture or variety.\n\nIt's fun.  But in the end, this is some very expensive ice cream.", "author": "Albert H."}

It's like when you're watching the Japanese edition of Iron Chef and they have to make ice cream out of everything (fish, seaweed, soy sauce), but this is the nonexistent episode where it actually came out delicious.  If my sentiment were translated from Japanese (like the judges) this ice cream would be like lotus flowers in the spring, blooming on my tongue.\n\nThe people are nice too.

I have no issues with the line, the service, the price, how they present the flavors--whatever, we have a choice whether or not to patronize a business. I and my BF shared a salted caramel ice cream and it was just awful. There was too much liquid nitrogen and it burned both of our mouths--I couldn't eat more than a spoonful. The flavor wasn't rich or intense, and the texture was nothing to write home about. A bunch of reviews say the ice cream was \"like butter\"--that means it's been overchurned. \n\nI make my own ice cream so I have a high bar for flavor and creaminess. This isn't even in the ballpark. I've had friends tell me they like Smitten, so maybe the mix itself and the skill of the mixers is better on some days than others, and they also probably have lower standards.

That would be a fine concept, except waiting 10-15 minutes for ice cream (in addition to waiting in a monster-sized line) makes me a little pissy. \n\nMy expectations were only heightened by the line/wait time; when my ice cream tasted no better than [name any ice creamery in the city], I felt duped. Literally duped by the smoke (& mirrors!) their ice cream machine oozes while it churns. Apparently, their way of making ice cream is very high tech, but I care very little about the gimmicky & the new if the finished product doesn't blow me away. \n\nI ordered a small Brown Sugar with cinnamon shortbread bits. I enjoyed the shortbread & its chewy texture, but the ice cream tasted more like maple. The bf ordered a TCHO Chocolate w/ candied jalape\u00f1os in a cone. Chocolate was thick & dark. Jalape\u00f1os were not candied. Cone was soft, crumbly & unsweetened. The other two flavors today were Vanilla & Lemon Verbena, which leads me to my two final gripes: samples are not given & flavors are usually limited to 3-5 a day. \n\nTotal: $10.25 (I wish I'd saved my money for Humphrey Slocombe.)\n\nThe only thing I was Smitten with this afternoon was my bf.", "author": "Fancypants X."}

After walking by almost everyday since its pod opening, I brought some friends and said \"ehhh, go check it out since it's something different\". I wasn't very excited about their flavors - chocolate, brown sugar, and nectarine. I know people say you can judge good ice cream by the basic flavors but if I'm eating the calories, I want to throw in the toffee, cake pieces, cookie dough, potato chips, brownies, granola, etc. \n\nWe went with 2 $3 itty bitty kiddie sizes of chocolate and brown sugar. We passed on a 50 cent topping after the register gal scoffed at us for trying to add the praline that went on the nectarine ice cream. Brown sugar came up first which tasted almost buttery, good texture overall but the flavor didn't excite me. I could see the machine making chocolate was being fussy so it took longer to come out. The texture was gummy so we had trouble getting it down our throats. The TCHO chocolate was definitely bittersweet, also not my fave. \n\nGals working inside didn't seem very happy.

Be warned tho the brittle is seasonal and changes with their \"ice cream\" menu, so if you like what you're tasting grab a bag (if they still have any left for sale) because I'm really ruing not buying some of that pistachio brittle when I had the chance.\n\nVariety as mentioned... the menu changes often, especially as their fresh fruits or other ingredients go in and out of season or availability. Don't worry, there are a few staples like chocolate and vanilla.. but be wild! Try some of the other mixes, I can almost guarantee that you won't be sorry!\n\nNerd factor, really I have two things:\n\nStampt (frequent buyer app.)\n\nand liquid nitrogen.\n\n'Nuff said.", "author": "Wonder W."}

Yes, it's expensive; yes, it's slightly pretentious that they have their own proprietary ice cream maker called the Kelvin that crafts made-to-order scoops for every patron (wait, that's actually kind of cool and maybe why it's so expensive). But--BUT--Smitten offers perhaps the most undiluted ice cream flavor I've ever experienced. We had the vanilla (which tastes like a perfectly fresh version of McDonald's soft serve, which, I mean, wow...) and Tcho Chocolate (my new favorite plain chocolate ice cream).\n\nSo creamy, so good, and so unlike its competitors, I hereby heartily support Smitten's wheel reinvention.", "author": "Alee K."}

I love their unique flavors, which changes based on the availability of the ingredients. And, of course, who doesn't find watching ice cream being made-to-order in front of your eyes amazing?! I sure do. \n\nWith the popularity of stores making instant ice cream with liquid nitrogen, I began asking myself, is Smitten's ice cream really that good or was I simply \"smitten\" by the way they make it. As I tried other gourmet ice cream parlor's in The City, I discovered a huge difference between ice cream made using the traditional method vs. the ice cream made at Smitten with liquid nitrogen. It's the texture.  When you think of the texture of ice cream, the first thing that comes to mind is the creaminess, hence the name. I hate to say it, but Smitten's ice cream is more chewy than creamy. Sometimes I also find their ice cream icy or chalky. This is because of the flash frozen method they use. The creaminess of ice cream comes from the churning. The slower the churn, the creamier the ice cream. Smitten does churn their ice cream, but they do it quick. One huge benefit of less churning is less air in the ice cream, meaning the ingredients they put in is what you get out. This result in stronger flavors.\n\nNow, to answer my question, I learned that I am more smitten by how Smitten makes their ice cream than the ice cream itself. That's not to say Smitten ice cream is bad; I just find other gourmet ice cream around town better.  I will still hit up Smitten whenever I'm in the neighborhood.", "author": "Albert L."}

It's a cute ice cream place (more like a truck or a stand than an actual restaurant/building), where they make all their ice cream to order with liquid nitrogen. It's quite fun watching the ice cream being made with their special Kelvin machines.\n\nAnd the taste is really good! Very smooth, very creamy, great texture!! \n\nThe problems with this place however is that on a nice day, the line can get LONG, and unlike the other popular ice cream places in the city, the line just dragggggs on and can take upwards of 1 hour. Which, for ice cream, is a little ridiculous - and I'm a huge avid ice cream fan. I understand that the wait comes because they're making the ice cream right then and there, but still. And it's not just the line that takes forever - the time when you put your order in and wait for your ice cream is fairly long too.\n\nThe other issue is the price! For a fairly small scoop of ice cream, to charge that much is a little too much. I suppose you're paying for the novelty of it ....\n\nAlso, they are limited to only 4 flavors everyday which they'll rotate from day to day, and whether I'm a fan of those flavors can be hit or miss. The first time I went, their flavors were fairly boring (vanilla, malt vanilla, Tcho chocolate and one other thing), which was disappointing. Again, I understand WHY they do this (they only have 4 machines, and they can't mix flavors while making the ice cream), but it is still an inconvenience. \n\n... which also means you can't taste ice creams because, obviously, they make it to order.

It was pretty cool to read the story of how smitten was created, the use of liquid nitrogen to make ice cream, and the freshness of mint in the ice cream, BUT the wait for the ice cream was not worth it.\n\nGranted it was a nice Saturday afternoon, but it wasn't extremely busy.  I waited for about 5 minutes for my order, before I heard them call my name, I went up to the counter and they gave me the wrong order.  \nOkay, I'll wait for them to remake it, but in the time it took for them to load the canister in place, mix all the ingredients and put in the liquid nitrogen, it became a 10+ minute wait.  \nTo top it off, their system of \"ipads\" is a little flawed when it comes to them making mistakes with orders (there was another girl waiting for her order to be remade).  They end making new orders and completely forget about remaking orders.  If my boyfriend didn't ask for my order I was going to request for my money back.\nThe only upside is that they gave me a complimentary topping, it was some sort of chocolate sauce, which was just a little drizzle, market price was $0.25-$0.75\n\nI wouldn't come back, but it was worth it to try it once. \ntip: parking around this area is pretty hard to find, try the alley ways.", "author": "Steph Q."}

The one neat thing that Smitten has going for them is that they make their ice cream right in front of you. While this makes your wait a little longer, I can't say that it makes your ice cream any better. The chocolate was just way too rich and sweet and made it very difficult to eat. Plus the utensil that they provided was this tiny dink of a spoon and I could barely scoop anything.

I like the creaminess of the ice cream, I like watching them make the ice cream, but my main problem with Smitten is consistency. When its good, it's good, but they don't stick to one recipe, so you never know what you'll get.\n\nCase and point, their Salted Caramel (which doesn't even come close to Bi-rite's). The first time it was super sweet. The second perfect, and the last time I had it it tasted like straight vanilla. I asked them about this and they told me each batch is different depending on what ingredients they have on hand. That's cool and all, but don't say it's the same flavor if its not going to taste the same.\n\nMy other problem with them is the small batches thing. When there aren't many people around it's cool, but they don't really customize each scoop so when there are large crowds there is no reason they shouldn't go ahead and make as much as they can in each bowl. The ice cream is not worth waiting 40 minutes just to get a kiddie sized scoop. They only have 3 flavors at a time, so predicting demand should be fairly easy. It also seems like they lose money that way.\n\nDon't wait in line for this, during the week it's quick, but I think Bi-Rite and Mitchell's is better.", "author": "Miss S."}

I understand that each order is prepared in real time, but... that long of a wait for a single scoop is pretty ridiculous.\n\nThe decor/ambiance is really cute, clean and modern, and the staff are quite friendly.  The small heated tent space was also poppin' on a Friday night.  Flavors were alright; I didn't get to try the flavor that sounded most interesting to me (Coconut Lime) but we did try the Salted Caramel (ok, I prefer Bi-Rite's version) and the aforementioned vanilla sundae.  The texture of the ice cream is quite unique-- creamy (small ice crystals due to the liquid nitrogen churning process) but still light.  Oh and FYI, you can only get ONE FLAVOR per order.  They can't combine different flavors because by the time they finish making the second flavor, the first will have melted (gives you an idea how long it takes to churn out your ice cream).\n\nOVERALL: I'm glad I got to try it, and its a fun place to witness the entire process behind making your icy treat, but I doubt I'll be returning.", "author": "Susanna W."}

Beginning first with the novel preparations of Smitten, a relative newcomer to the scene based on owner Robyn Goldman's liquid nitrogen small-batch/from-scratch concept I arrived at the small...shed...late in the afternoon to find a small line.  Taking my place in the queue and reading the signage about Smitten's concept of \"using only the freshest, purest, locally sourced and seasonal ingredients\" while hoping that what they lacked in ambiance was made up for in taste I made my way to the front of the line where I placed my order, paid my $4, and proceeded to wait perhaps 10 minutes for my cone.\n\nSeeing others receive their product before me - a selection of four rather standard flavors with some outlandish toppings including candied jalapenos - I had to admit I was excited when my name was finally called as everyone really seemed to love what they had ordered, yet when I finally received my selection of TCHO Chocolate on a pizzelle cone I was instantly of mixed emotions because although good and certainly chocolate I guess I expected more both in flavor and in portion.  Beginning first with the ice cream - a bit of a misnomer as what Smiitten is serving is more like cold pudding in texture - the flavor was fine, but for $4 and a 25-minute wait I could have had twice as much ice cream (and two different flavors) elsewhere with less \"technology\" and just as fine of ingredients.  Moving next to the cone - actually the star of the show - the hand made pizzelle was actually fantastic with a crisp exterior and just a bit of \"chew\" supporting the small dollop of ice cream.  \n\nOverall it was worth the try and I'd consider going back to sample some of the more esoteric fruit flavors, but considering the quality of The Bay Area's Ice Cream scene I most certainly wasn't *sorry* smitten with Smitten.", "author": "Michael U."}

From then on, I had already declared that I was smitten with this ice cream!!!  No pun intended. What a transition from that to an actual shop with three of these machines just walking distance from the pad. Yaayyy !!!!!\n\n     So this ice cream..... it's just heavenly. Extremely creamy and smooth. Each scoop is made to order, therefore no additives are needed because they use  fresh and local ingredients to ensure the maximum tastiest flavorful ice cream ever. When making the ice cream, they use as little ingredients as possible to ensure it's raw,  beautiful, simple flavor from this unique machine straight into your mouth. And that unmistakable creaminess, is because it is churned by liquid nitrogen which helps to chill the ice cream uber cold causing it to create small ice crystals resulting in the the unruffled texture you reap when you enjoy it.\n\nI'll tell you about the flavors that I've had:\n\nMalted Vanilla: That in itself is a staple and one can really taste the simplicity and quality of the flavor. \n\nChocolate with Tcho chocolate chips: Yummy when you need that chocolate fix\n\nMint Tcho chocolate chip: For all you mint lovers, this tastes like the actual mint plant. The flavor stays with you for a while so be prepared\n\nMint, Rosemary, Thyme: If you can get pass thinking of savory foods when deciding to choose  this, then this flavor is definitely a must for risk takers but required for all you fellow herbalists\n\nGinger/Peach: These two blend together so nicely, you'll think it just  peachy\n\nSalted Caramel: Just like it sounds, it tastes....so good!\n\n     Theses are but a few that I've tasted and there are more that I'll be looking forward to.

Needless to say I had very high expectations. Luckily I managed to come on a sunny day when there were only a handful of people waiting for ice cream ahead of me. Score! \n\nOut of the 4 flavors they had available (60% dark chocolate, vanilla, rhubarb, peanut butter?) I went with the dark chocolate. Obviously. They have a cute little menu where they have pictorial representations of the ingredients in each flavor. I recall seeing some weird stuff listed in the chocolate row, like coffee, egg, and salt amongst the expected things (cream, cocoa, sugar). \n\nI just got the kiddie size, one scoop, $3 in a pizelle cone, .75 extra. I totally got sold on the cone because the smell was just so tantalizing. MISTAKE. \n\nOf course the novelty of Smitten is that they make the ice cream on the spot. I don't mind paying a little extra or waiting a little longer for my dessert. \n\nThe dark chocolate flavor was admittedly delicious. This is about all I can say and where all the stars come from. \n\nHere are the issues: melts really fast. Maybe there's something about the technique in making the ice cream, but it was NOT a hot day and I can't imagine how fast you'd have to gobble down your scoop if it was any warmer. My ice cream was dribbling before it was safely in my hands!\n\nSecond, the pizelle cone is thick and crumbly. Maybe I shouldn't compare it to Ici's, but the cone at Ici is many times better than Smitten's. Perhaps they are trying to go for their own style, but it ain't cuttin' it. How can I eat my ice cream when the cone is flying everywhere? When breaking off a piece of the cone takes so much effort? WHEN THERE IS NO CHOCOLATE AT THE BOTTOM TO BLOCK THE DRIPPY ICE CREAM FROM LEAKING OUT OF THE UNCLOSED CONE HOLE?\n\nThird, I can't imagine what the wait would be like on a weekend day in the summer. With only 5 people in front of me, I saw a couple walk around the block with coffees in hand, with ample time to retrieve their cones. And I assume this was a relatively light business day. I fear for the good days. \n\nAnyhow, Smitten was good. I enjoyed my ice cream and felt that the price for a single scoop wasn't as ridiculous as I expected it would be. The flavor was strong yet not overpowering or overwhelmingly sweet. It was fun to try and good to know what's in my ice cream but I wouldn't jump at the chance to come back.", "author": "Lydia W."}

Silly isn't it?\n\nMy friend had ordered their strawberry balsamic - strawberries and balsamic vinegar are such a great match. Watching the liquid formula quickly churn into ice cream from liquid nitrogen from a machine that resembles a stand mixer - was amazing; a total new way to make ice cream instantly.\n\nI had their cardamom ice cream - no it was not vanilla infused with the spice. Actually, it contained no eggs, all it contained was cream, cardamom, and sugar. It was delicious, and tasted like fruit loops - well the after taste, I suppose that's what cardamom tastes like.\n\nBoth flavors we tried were so creamy - all this from liquid nitrogen, wow!\n\nNext on my list, gotta try their TCHO chocolate. \n\nH\u00e4agen-Dazs and Cold Stone, be on the look out.\n\nMMMMM.", "author": "Alex C."}

They had 4 flavors on the menu and it turns out that they switch out their flavors about once a month. What makes this place so particular about their ice cream is they use liquid nitrogen to make their ice cream. You can watch them make it in front of you since everything is made to order.\n\nWe tried two flavors: mint chocolate chip and creme fraiche. The mint chocolate chip was really a pleasant surprise as I have never really been a big fan of the flavor, but they used REAL mint leaves to make the ice cream. It tasted refreshing and the sweetness was just right. I didn't feel like my teeth were going to fall out from too much sugar. The creme fraiche had a perfect layer of pear caramel. The defining feature of this flavor was definitely the caramel. It was a little sweeter compared to the mint chocolate chip, but it still held its own pear fragrance. Both ice creams were very creamy and just melted in your mouth.\n\nI would recommend trying to get a smaller portion. The smallest cup they have is already $5. It not for cost, don't let the smaller portion fool you, the ice cream being as creamy and rich as it is, will fill you up much more quickly than you think! Also, they have nice little benches for you to sit and enjoy your ice cream in their little street shop. Ambiance is nice.", "author": "Kerri L."}

First off, made-to-order ice cream sounds like a great idea in theory. Then you witness the ice cream maker's frustration having to repeatedly wrestle with the bowls of the patented Kelvin machines, as they keep flying off into the glass of the counter. Talk about a Sisyphean task that kind of harshes your happy-ice-cream-experience.\n\nSecond, the technology doesn't seem to work as my serving of mint chip ice cream never even got close to a frozen consistency -- it was more like vaguely cold thickened cream. Does it only work on cold SF days?\n\nWhich leads to the next issue -- poor execution of service. Melty /never frozen ice cream + no gourmet version of a milk dud at the bottom of the homemade waffle cone = sticky ice cream dripping all over your hands and clothes. An old-school solution would solve that problem in a heartbeat.\n\nI will say that the waffle cone itself is truly superb and the flavors are obviously crafted with care. I'm sure they will continue to thrive in Hayes Valley, especially since it is in a great location that is starved for artisan ice cream. However, the reality of made-to-order ice cream is not worth the time or money for me.", "author": "Janice A."}

The most important part of this review is obviously the ice cream. I ordered the classic vanilla with malted caramel in a waffle one. It had a great flavor, which I think is awesome considering vanilla is a hard flavor to get right when using your own, fresh ingredients. I would have preferred the ice cream to be a bit creamier than it was. The caramel was a good addition if you like sugar overload but, on second thought, I could have done with out it. The waffle cones are made fresh, daily and they were absolutely delicious. I would recommend the cone over the bowl any day. I thought the process were a little high ($5 for the small) but it is plenty of ice cream and there was no need to go bigger but it did seem like you get more ice cream in the cone than in a cup, in my opinion.\n\nAs for the experience of Smitten, I really liked the outside, stand-like atmosphere but on a really windy day it might not be ideal. The staff didn't really seem enthusiastic but they got their job done, which is the important part I guess. The coolest part is that you can see the ice cream being made with the liquid nitrogen through the glass. I have seen other people complain in their reviews about there only being 4 flavors but that is the price you pay for nitrogen liquid ice cream, as it has to be made fresh and in its own mixer. Overall, it's solid ice cream and a solid experience.", "author": "Stephanie M."}

Nor do I see the point of returning. I am sad that there aren't more ice cream shops in Hayes Valley for me to stop at on my walk home from work. \n\nI think this place is fun to go to once and to see how they do things but their inventive flavors aren't executed as well as they could be (i have visited a few times and have received under processed ice cream 2 out of 3 times). Furthermore, their prices don't measure up to their portions. I appreciate a small ice cream portion but the price should come close to matching it. I guess their technique is expensive but I don't think it is a sustainable business model? \n\nEither way I hope that Smitten Ice Cream can stay open so people can experience their novelty but the shtick wears off on a returning customer.

I figure, \"Eh, might as well live a little and try it out,\" since I already had the other flavors on the menu.\n\nA few minutes later, my friends come back with a big serving of the Spring Herb and asked me to taste it. I honestly didn't know what to expect because in it was mint, basil, thyme and rosemary (a lot of herbs, right?). The ice cream was a pleasant surprise to me. I could definitely taste the herbs, but I could still enjoy the sweetness of the ice cream. I would definitely get another order of this again!\n\nRobyn, sorry, I was supposed to come by and tell you about how much I liked it, but you had a long line of customers, and we were already running late on our lunch break. I'll definitely be coming by again (this was my 4th visit!). \n\nAbout the rest of the ice cream... I've had salted caramel (it definitely rivals Bi-Rite's), TCHO chocolate, rhubarb crisp and spring herb. I can definitely taste the freshness in the ice cream because it's mixed RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU. Yeah, awesome watching your ice cream made for you on the spot! (Now...

In Korean I would say it's neuky. I LOVE ice cream; I finish my friend's cone at Ici (excessive, I know), but Smitten's was too much even for me. You get tired after a few bites. Perhaps if they had lighter flavors like fruits or mint, it would be better. I saw on the website that they're working on just that, so maybe I'll be back for the ones with berries.

Each order is made to order so it takes a while to get a scoop of ice cream.  Each person behind the counter is assigned to specifically make one flavor.  So if you wanted two flavors someone else has to make it on another machine.  I ordered only one scoop and there were a couple orders in front me and I waited 10 minutes.  I was also taken back when I was told the price of my single scoop on a cone.  I think it was $6.00.  So with that price I don't suggest you take your kids or family.

The event was intimate and super fun, there were about 12 of us tasters, 4 kelvins, 4 kelvinistas, 4 flavors of ice cream, a pile of fresh pezzel cones, and our empty bellies. The staff and Robyn were super friendly and accommodating even welcoming us with hot cider! \n\nWe got to try 3 new flavors/combos:\n- Bay Leaf with Meyer Lemon Caramel - the lightest ice cream of the bunch, the herb flavor is strong but I think that's what makes it special\n- Maple Walnut - toasted nut crumbles in ice cream... mmm.\n- Apple a la mode sundae: vanilla ice cream over warm baked apples with peanut butter caramel and crumbled graham crackers - probably my favorite it tasted just like the holidays and peanut butter caramel?!?! what's not to love \n- Classic Tcho chocolate - wow! the smoothest ice cream I have ever tasted, you have to try it yourself to really understand \n\nNote: Sitting outside at night in front of the shop was chilly especially when eating ice cream but we found out that soon Smitten's going to be putting up a tent and heat lamps so that we can still enjoy ice cream on the coldest winter day.", "author": "Nicole L."}

It's great if you love simple flavors, or are adventurous enough to try some unique blends. I don't know how much the nitrogen really adds to the ice cream, but I will say that all of their flavors are very creamy and rich tasting, but don't leave you feeling sluggish / sweetened-out afterwards. \n\nHeads up: there is no sampling (unless there's no lines and they have some extra ice cream) and parking is a struggle here. The line is also super long, and while the ice cream is good, I wouldn't wait over 20 minutes for it so I would suggest going in the morning on a weekend or on a weekday.\n\nDefinitely try:\n1. Fresh Mint Chip - I really dislike mint flavoring, but this was so refreshing and unique. It was a perfect amount of fresh mint and chocolate chip, and is the only place I would ever order a mint-flavored dish at.\n2. Homemade Nut Brittle - super delicious!\n3. Cinnamon Shortbread - perfect shortbread and an amazing addition to the vanilla ice cream\n4.

I do not jive with store bought ice cream. Mitchell's I can get down with since it's practically butter. Humphrey Slocombe/Bi-Rite are right in the middle. \n\nHad Smitten today as a treat after a work lunch (lactaid was certainly in my future as soon as we ran back to the office a few blocks away). Carrot Cake, great flavor loved the texture of the carrots. \n\nWhile delicious and wonderfully conceived in execution and idea- this ice cream is incredibly milky. I'm not saying that's a bad thing. But as someone who does not consume milks or creams- unless on a rare occasion or only when the milk is now broken down so much its a hard cheese or butter- this was a weird sensation. Lovely flavor- weird to be sipping up ginger/carrot flavored milk when it had melted in the cup. \n\nSo not a full on review but rather a note to bare in mind, if like me, you haven't had a glass of milk in 10 years.", "author": "Niki M."}

Usually vanilla and strawberry are easy to come by, but caramel, chai, and other seasonal flavors go fast, especially on warm sunny days.\n\nThe experience- you get to watch as the cream and other ingredients are put into a special apparatus that uses liquid nitrogen, at -322 degrees Fahrenheit, to make teeny tiny ice crystals that result in super creamy ice cream.  This takes about 5-8 min and is probably worth half the $5.50 you're paying for a small cup of ice cream.\n\nIf I would have thought of this for my 5th grade science fair project, I'm absolutely sure I would have won.  All those fatass grade school teachers would have been all over it.  \n\nAnyhow, I digress.  The ice cream is super rich, creamy, and delicious (and probably 800 calories).

I read a few reviews that complained that it was too creamy?  Idiots!  It's called ice CREAM!  Those same people probably love that sugar and ice blend they sell in 3 gallon tubs for $2 at the supermarket.  SMH\n\nOnto the ice cream.  I wasn't going to order at first because of the pig fest my friends and I decided to have at Paxti's right before this place, but after seeing that nifty nitrogen machine, I was curious, then sold.  One small cup of the brown sugar with cookies.  I read a few complaints about the line and how long it took, but they have 3 machines everything is made to order, and it takes about 5 minutes from start to end.  Combine that with hot weather and the amount of people that will crave ice cream.  Do the math.  Since we were there right before closing, there were only about 4 or 5 orders before ours, so the wait was about 15 min, but I couldn't complain when I saw that all 3 employees were actually doing something.  It's not like when I'm at a place with slow ass service and the people working there are searching for that long lost booger in their nose.  \n\nOK, slightly off track once again.  The ice cream I got was delicious, to say the least.  A few of my friends got the almond brittle topping for an additional 50 cents, and that was pretty good as well.  The ice cream is creamy, just the right amount of sweetness and has a generous amount of flavor added to it.  And since you are watching them make it through the window, you know that it is going to be the freshest ice cream you can have without actually making it yourself.  Oh, and the lady working behind the register/making the ice cream/owner (?) isn't too bad looking herself. ;D\n\nThe ice cream is a bit pricey for the amount you get ($4.75 is a small and you get 2 scoops about the size of those giant jaw breakers), but considering the amount of work going into each one, I guess it is somewhat justified.

Friday night, 8:00pm, and a wait of 5 minutes. Win! The idea of fresh-made ice cream with liquid nitrogen sounds very intriguing and the ice cream does taste lighter and more fresh. \n\nThe menu consists of 4 different flavor and rotates on a daily basis. I wanted their strawberry balsamic but tonight was just not the night. \n\n$3 for a tiny tiny 2 oz scoop, I didn't feel satisfied with my TCho mint chocolate chip. The next size up is $4.25 for a 4 oz scoop! \n\nThe mint is delicious. It is nothing like the green mint ice cream you purchase from other shops. It has a taste of real mint leaves, vanilla, and chunks of dark chocolate chip.\n\nThe brown sugar tastes like molasses, with a hint of salt. Reminded me of Bi-rite's salted caramel, but I heard Smitten also had salted caramel on certain days. \n\nOverall, it was pricey but I'm interested in trying the other flavors they have.", "author": "Rosanne L."}

Unfortunately, I did not get that experience with Smitten's. I do hear almost everyone rave about the place and I have never really heard a bad review about Smitten's, but I have to be honest, the ice cream is pretty basic. Yes, it's made right there in front of you, but I just cannot get excited about this place. I'll admit that it is a very nice spot to bring a date, especially at night. On the contrary, I did bring a date there and we both did not think too much about the ice cream. I'm not saying the ice cream is terrible, because it's not. It's just not super amazing as people make it out to be. Smitten's is definitely over-hyped as being the best ice cream. It's a bit too creamy for me. For me, I love hunting down great food. I like finding the best of something, whether its the best tacos, or best hamburgers, or even best ice cream. Smitten's just didn't do it for me, but definitely go there. There is a reason why it is popular, it's just not popular with me. That's just my opinion amongst others who absolutely love this place, but I am giving Smitten's 3 out of 5 stars for those reasons.", "author": "Eric M."}

Having the ice cream made to order is great, but kind of makes it melt a little fast, especially on a warm day. Credit cards are accepted here. Friend signed her name like a credit card slip on their iPad and had the receipt texted to her moments later. Awesome tech!\n\nOverall I liked the taste of the ice cream. You really taste the freshness. Seating is available in their little seating area by Ritual or grab a bench at Patricia's Green and enjoy the day.

I got the sticky toffee pudding. There were little pieces of dates in it (yum) and the consistency of it was pretty smooth. Yes it was sweet, but I expected that when ordering a flavor called sticky toffee pudding. Fresh ingredients also made it a plus in my book. I also enjoyed reading the story of how the shop came to be while I was in line. So it's not NOT good per say... \n\nWith that said, I don't know if I would shell out $4-5 a scoop to go there again. The cost isn't bad considering most local shops cost about the same nowadays.. but that's the thing: most local shops cost about the same nowadays. And most local shops don't have such a long wait, taste just as good (if not better), and have more than four flavors to choose from. Note that I waited about 15-20 min after ordering to get my ice cream. \n\nAnd besides, the guy making my ice cream wasn't wearing gloves, had ice cream mixture all over him, didn't seem to care much about how he was handling things, and the machine had ice cream mixture spilling everywhere on the sides. Maybe I'm just being nit-picky but I'd be lying if I didn't say that it decreased my appetite a little bit.  I used to work in an ice cream store so perhaps I notice these things more than most. \n\nIf you're in the area, I'd say go for it if you want to try it at least once.

Maybe it is waiting 15-20 minutes in the sweltering sun that has addled my brains?  Yes, that is about how long I had to wait while I watched, order by order, the mechanical whirring of the \"KELVIN\" and billowing smoke from all of the liquid nitrogen, which gave me flashbacks of all of my undergraduate chemistry labs when I thought that I would blow up Dabney Hall on NCSU campus.  Those orders were all of the other ORDERS ahead of mine.\n\nIs it worth the wait?  Well, for me, I must say yes.  I'm a fan of decadent and rich dessert.  I'm a bigger fan of CAKE, but ice cream on a nice summer-ish day in SF (or as close to summer-ish as it can get with a cool breeze in the shade), is an acceptable second runner up.  You can read other reviews that are more technical or focus on the concept, but I'm all about EMOTIONS and FEELINGS (I'm so emo), oh and gimmick.  I'm not an easy sell, but if you have something that is cute, I'll bite every time.\n\nSo, for me, this is what I loved:\n\n-I loved the \"new Old Fashion\" idea.  \n-I loved watching them make my ice cream to order.\n-I loved seeing the liquid nitrogen and all of the smoke that reminded me of SF fog and chemistry experiments gone awry.\n-I loved how people were just anxiously waiting (and there were a lot of people to people watch).\n-I love that they were serving out of a trailer (Hey, I'm from the SOUTH, please...honey, trailer is right up my alley).\n-I loved the creamy, uber richness of the TCHO CHOCOLATE.  \n-I loved how this took me back, like a time-travel machine to my VERY FIRST TASTE of the flavor called \"WORLD CLASS CHOCOLOATE\" of Baskin ROBBINS in 1984 in Okinawa, Japan.  It tastes EXACTLY the same.\n-I loved that I felt like a little kid again having her first scoop of ice cream.\n\n\nWhat I didn't love so much:\n-HOLY COW, it's one expensive scoop of ice cream.\n-Where are the napkins, exactly?  I didn't see any  and I really needed them.\n-There needs to be a bigger compost trash can for the bio-degradable ice-cream cups\n-I understand that the cups are intended to be biodegradable, but my ice cream actually leaked through the cup...I guess it was BIODEGRADING as I was eating *hahaha*\n- The ice cream melts as SOOOOOOON as they hand it to you, so take your photos quick kids or else it will end up being a lava flow of melted ice cream that, while edible, creates quite a mess.\n-I had some type of coconut crunch praline mixed in...but it had no flavor of coconut...strange.\n\nGood news is that even though I got LOTS and LOTS of melted ice cream on my brand new sundress yesterday, it came out easily with Shout handiwipes. *hahaha*...\n\nI'll be back Smitten...maybe next time, I'll fall in love...", "author": "Hiromi N."}

The nectarine ice cream had a super smooth texture, but lacking in any full nectarine taste.  I was a little disappointed as I was told they had picked up the stone fruit from the farmers market that morning.  The nectarine was lost in the ice cream and the flavor a little bland.\n\nThe chocolate had a very creamy flavor and fudge like texture.

I ordered the seasonal strawberry, made with organic local berries. The flavor was disappointingly flat, like it was made with diluted strawberry juice rather than chunks of real berries. Liquid nitrogen allows the ice cream to be frozen when you order, but this feels like a total gimmick. There is no slow-churned, creamy mouth feel that you would expect from fresh ice cream. For $6/scoop and $11/pint, you're better off with the myriad amazing ice cream spots around town, like Bi-Rite Creamery, Humphrey Slocombe, Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous, Mitchell's, Three Twins ... hell, even a trip across the street to Mollie Stone's for a prepackaged pint would be better.", "author": "H N."}

I thoroughly enjoyed my ice cream eating experience here, but with some definite qualms.\n\nGood things:\n- Creme fraiche with pear caramel and tcho nibs: Their seasonal flavor, this was SO great. I've had creme fraiche before that tastes overly sour, but the cashier described it perfectly when he said that this tasted like a light cheesecake. The pear caramel was a perfect pairing, though I can't really say the same about the tcho nibs (don't pay the extra 75 cents for it; they just end up falling off your cone...)\n- Super helpful and friendly staff in a super cute place: My friend and I actually walked past this place without seeing it (well, also because we were on the other side of the street. Oops). It's like a tiny little DIY warehouse and the atmosphere inside feels super cozy. It'd be a perfect place to go with another person to catch up :)\n\nNot so good things:\n- Handmade cones: I love love love waffle cones, but theirs really doesn't do it for me. It's another 75 cents on top of an already pricey ice cream and the worst part is the texture. It's so soft that the ice cream melts through. Actually, the worst part is the hole at the bottom of the cone, which is really quite unpleasant when your $6 ice cream starts disappearing through it.\n- Lack of options: A common theme in what I consider my fave ice cream places are variety. That doesn't exist here because the ice cream is made individually, which seems pretty neat but I honestly cannot taste that much of a difference. There are only 4 flavors at a time that you cannot taste before buying, so you kind of have to go blindly at this and trust that you're getting something good.\n- $$: The smallest size starts at $4.75 and even though they say that it's two scoops, it's technically the size of one scoop. Pricey ice cream that should definitely be reserved for special occasions :(\n\nDespite my drippy mess of a cone and the fact that I can get 6 ice creams at Rite Aid for the price of one at Smitten, I'd still return to try all their other flavors.

It melts quickly because it's more of a consistency like gelato or thicker soft serve instead of hard-packed ice cream.\n\nSmitten's offers several flavor bases and topping to add on.

There are usually a lot of the more sweet, rich flavors offered, but many times the fruity flavors don't seem that fruity (the exceptions being strawberry and the apple flavor).  It's fun to watch your ice cream being made, and the enclosed area with heating lamps is great on the chilly days that you still want some ice cream.", "author": "Andrea T."}

After all, who wouldn't want to see and eat ice-cream that's made right in front of your face!?! It's such an amazing experience to see the fog rising over that little machinery! When I went here I tried the TCHO chocolate flavor which was INCREDIBLY CREAMY! I have never had ice-cream THIS creamy!!! It was such an interesting texture since I wasn't used to the ultimate creamy-ness! It looks like it gets crowded often because of the ultra long wait but I totally understand that they are making it and you gotta give them some time to concoct your magical cup of happiness. The downsides to this place is that the ice-cream is unaffordable. It's very costly, which shouldn't discourage you from trying this place but just know that you will be spending the amount of money that can buy you a gallon or two at safeway... You also cannot mix flavors if you get more than one scoop. (just a little bit of a warning) \n\nI honestly don't think I'll be coming back unless Im in the area and Im in the mood for ice-cream scoops the size of a golf ball...but overall still such a cool concept!", "author": "Susie N."}

I have to admit, although I was disappointed with the limited selection, the salted carmel was wonderful. The only bad part was it made my stomach pretty upset because it was very creamy. Yes, I know ice cream is typically cream but this was a slightly different - a little thicker than I'm used to.  I also thought they would have unique flavors (I scoured out the website beforehand), I was looking forward to the butternut squash (I'm a huge fan and wanted to try it in ice cream form). However, they only had chocolate, salted caramel and green tea (which I am not a fan of). I decided to go with salted caramel, because that has become a new classic favorite (trendy also). \n\nAfter it made my stomach upset, I of course had to give it another chance because I didn't eat a lot that day. Since then I have had the strawberry and vanilla, which I am a fan of but it didn't blow me away. I also ordered them in kiddie size because it was a perfect size for my mood and cheaper.

I also liked their simple chalkboard signage listing the flavors of the day and the ingredients that go into each.  I think they offer 4 flavors each day, they were erasing one they ran out of as we walked up.  I will forever wonder what flavor that was! ha.  each of us got a scoop of the remaining flavors. brown sugar, vanilla, and chocolate.  (I didn't like that you can't mix flavors when you order multiple scoops, that doesn't seem fair.) The chocolate was by far the best of the 3 (and this is coming from a non-chocolate choosing person in terms of ice cream flavors)  It was creamy and dense and very smooth dark chocolate flavor.  The vanilla was standard, creamy and sweet.  The brown sugar was my least favorite (it was the one I chose. boo).  It was thinner and lighter in texture than the other two (it did not have eggs listed like the others) and the flavor was more like a burnt milk flavor than a rich brown sugar sweetness.  It also melted really fast compared to the others.  At $4 each for a small scoop it is not cheap, but I think people pay for the gimmick of the Kelvin machines and the made to order aspect of the treat.  Which brings me to my final point/ding.  The night we went they were not making the icecream to order.  Rather they were making batches so none of us got to watch the process and ohhh and ahhh over the liquid nitrogen magic.  Not such a big deal to me, but my brother in law complained loudly, pointing out that he's paying for that gimmick so he wasn't happy they gave us premade icecream.  whatever.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-06-28", "description": "Gustatorily benign, spiritually off-putting.\n\nI'm sorry to say that Smitten Ice Cream just takes the joy out of ice cream for me. The rigidity in their operating procedures doesn't add any appeal to something that has had it in scoopfuls for hundreds of years, and though the ingredients stand out as being of superb quality and taste, the execution falls short of extracting the harmony that is so obviously fated for the components.\n\nI was Smitten's first customer of the day, so thankfully the wait was minimal. But still existent. Smitten's website claims it takes its machine 60 seconds to churn cream and divine, unassuming add-ins into a rich, heavenly concoction, but from order to scoop I'd guess that it was an eight-minute-plus affair, all told-- prepping the machine, ceremoniously gathering all of the ingredients of my olive oil-lavender-shortbread order (and to great pomp, at that), hooking stuff up and then revving up the machine. Imagine a crowd of twenty going through the queue.\n\nThe ice cream itself was promising. Perhaps the richest I've ever had (a bit too much, even for me), the product was very subtle in sweetness with top notes of spicy lavender, a dull crunch of the shortbread that didn't add much in flavor, and then rounded out by very high-quality, extremely fruity olive oil. So fruity was the oil that combined with the floral lavender and the dense creamy backbone, there were almost tropical, melony notes in the finish.\n\nBut it could be so much better in so many ways, and the basic philosophy of the business is what is impeding all of these improvements. Why shun tradition when your flavors could be uplifted by embracing it, Smitten? Flavors are mixed in with cream to order, which cockblocks any melding of flavors that could be coaxed from thickening and infusing a custard, lovingly churning it all as one for certainly more than 60 seconds. I assume this could be mostly remedied by making each component special and chock-full of flavor, but my chalky shortbread wasn't very convincing. So, is it more efficient? Is it more cost-effective? More delicious? More fun? Nope, nope, nope and nope (once you get past the coolness of freezing stuff with liquid nitro, you're crestfallen at the realization that this means no sampling, no combining flavors in one size, a long wait, etc., etc.). What you get is inferior flavor loaded with highfalutin concept that, to me, is kind of just a bunch of hoo-ha. I am all for local, sustainable and slow eats, but it doesn't contribute anything if it doesn't come with at least a smack of sensibility.\n\nI'm no smarty, and I don't know but would be curious to find out whether Smitten's use of nitrogen helps to cut back operating costs in any way and whether it is more environmentally friendly than using conventional energy sources to produce ice creams. These are things I'd really be interested in knowing, but if Smitten is going to advertise the main focus of their operation as flavor and texture-- well, they've lost me.\n\nIt's a sad day when ice cream, the most joyful and joyous of treats, becomes a chore. And you'll have to do a few chores to afford Smitten's fare, at $4.75 for a small (and they ain't mincing words here). Though the ice cream is by no means offensive, my feelings towards the operation's philosophy is so staunchly antonymic to its moniker that I can confidently say I will not be returning anytime soon, even with its extreme proximity to my work.", "author": "Nuri K."}

Really the worst mint chip I have ever had. There were about 7 people behind the little counter and only 5 or 6 people in the store - yet it still took 10 minutes to receive a drippy overpriced cone. Other people had good looking hard ice cream near me but I obviously got a newbie who didn't quite know how to work the nitrogen. Disappointing to pay so much for a crappy cone.  I usually love gourmet ice cream and have sampled really great ice cream coast to coast - this one just missed the mark. I will likely try it again - perhaps another flavor - coffee maybe? Hard to mess up Blue bottle coffee. I guess I prefer my mint chip green and artificially flavored with mint because I threw this one in the trash - waste of money - just wasn't worth the calories and I hate drippy icecream. Feel like they owe me a free cone next time. Why so overpriced ? You can get great ice cream in the mission for half the price.", "author": "Ann W."}

But is it any better than ice cream at BiRite, Mitchell's, Naia (technically a gelateria, but whatever), or any of the other famed ice creameries in SF? Nope! \n\nThey had 3 flavours the night I went: vanilla, green tea, and salted caramel. Being a non-vanilla person but wanting to try multiple flavours, I got a kid size of both the green tea and salted caramel (and effectively ruined my appetite since this was right before meeting friends for dinner =P). Both were creamy and yummy, but a little on the sweet side and nothing all that special. I've had more flavourful green tea ice creams at Japanese restaurants and the salted caramel at BiRite is just as good, if not better. They also included wedges of their pizzelle cone in the green tea ice cream. It's not as crunchy as your typical waffle cone, but still pretty good nonetheless.\n\nThe whole liquid nitrogen thing is more gimmicky than anything (well, that and a genius marketing strategy). But if you take that away... you're still left with good ice cream, it's just not worth the hype.\n\nPROS:\n-- Tasty ice cream\n\nCONS:\n-- ... but not THAT tasty.\n-- It's PRICEY: At $3.5 for the kid's size and $5.5 for the regular (plus $0.5 if you want it in a cone), it's more than I would have to pay at BiRite, Mitchell's, Naia, etc. And you only get one flavour (at least for the kid's size, not sure about the regular). \n-- The WAIT: Because the ice cream is made to order, you have to wait for the LN2 to do its magic. \n-- MELTED ice cream: The ice cream doesn't stay cold for very long since it's not kept frozen but is *just* (barely) frozen. Mine melted a little faster than I could eat it and I was soon spooning ice cream soup into my mouth.\n-- The CONE: It's not rolled up very tightly so there's a gaping hole at the bottom, which is a problem when the ice cream melts so fast. I like my ice cream in my mouth, not on my pants =(\n-- LACK OF FLAVOURS: Understandable since they're so small and have to make everything to order, but it's still a disadvantage. Not sure if you can sample either.\n\nBottom line: I'm glad I tried it but I likely won't be a repeat customer like I am at BiRite, Mitchell's, and Naia.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-10-29", "description": "Was in SF on business, and had an early dinner with an ex-beau.  \" i have a surprise place for us for dessert\", he said, with a twinkle in his eye. \"You'll be smitten.\"  We drove to a very hip 'hood - I think it's called Hayes Valley - and parked, then walked to a white tent.  Hmm - a tent? Oooookay.  The chalkboard menu offered four flavors: chocolate, vanilla, salted caramel, and pumpkin.  You only live once, so I insisted on trying both the caramel and the pumpkin while he ordered the chocolate.  Then the fun started.   The ice cream does not get scooped out of a container -SF is far too evolved and cool for that.  Clearly, they got the memo about molecular gastronomy, and this is dessert with a side of showmanship.  You place your order, and the flavors are poured into small metal containers with dough--hooklike inserts.  They infuse it with liquid nitrogen, and the machine whirls away while the nitrogen spews smokelike from the container.  Its sort of like your own personal mini- Krakatoa exploding right before your eyes. \n   I tasted the pumpkin first, since Halloween is mere hours away.  It tasted like frozen pumpkin pie, with all the distinctive flavor of pumpkin perfectly spiced with cinnnamon, allspice, nutmeg, ginger. There's something in ice cream called overrun, and I believe it has to do with the amount of air whipped into the ice cream.  From the little I understand about the science of ice cream production, there's no excess air in this treat; it tasted like I would imagine home-churned ice cream would taste -heavy and rich mouthfeel, intense flavors, small amount satisfies because it's so rich.  \n    I continued the orgy with thesalted caramel, which was an elegant balance of salt and sweet, and a slightly smoky undertone that was very sexy.  If youcould make Issac Hayes singing into ice cream, it would be Smitten's salted caramel.  And the chocolate..... Oh yes. Oh yes.  It had the richness, the complexity, the essence of top quality chocolate all summed up in a small scoop, and the power of the flavor at first spoonful is a bit shocking.  Each spoonful until you reach the bottom of the cup continues to be a guilty pleasure. \n    I am smitten!

The woman taking orders (owner I think) warned us about the wait on the salted caramel, so we got vanilla instead.\n\n2- I think I got a small when I paid for a regular. Annoying, but didn't care as I didn't really want to finish the one I had. \n\n3- Taste- Vanilla wasn't as good as Haagen Daaz. Strawberry was good, but, probably not any better than a good gelato shop. And, the mouthfeel was not anything to write home about. It wasn't icy at all, which is nice. But it was almost like little pellets on the vanilla- a bit like the ice cream dots at carnivals but not as extreme. \n\n4- It's fun to watch your ice cream being made in the very cool machine. The problem is, when you are waiting for a very long time, and you see all the people you know are in line ahead of you and then you see how long it takes to make just one cup, you start thinking the machines are the bottleneck and why can't they make 3-4 scoops at a time instead since there's 50+ orders to fill. \n\n5- The ladies that work there seem very nice, so I hate giving such a bad review.

I ordered the brown sugar ice cream, another friend ordered the olive oil ice cream with lavender short bread batter.  The brown sugar was very tasty but the olive oil ice cream didn't sound so tasty.  I would give them four stars but they lost one because of the wait.  One of my friends ordered plain vanilla ice cream and it took  10-15 minutes to get his ice cream and he ordered his before me and one other person.  By the time he got his ice cream everybody in our group had gotten their ice cream and was finished.  Besides that everything was good.", "author": "Nekiba M."}

This ice cream is incredibly rich and has a very creamy texture that doesn't melt down to wateriness after it melts, so I would advise a small portion. They do have a kids size that is perfect for someone with a sweet tooth that doesn't want to eat too much ice cream. The way they make it is awesome to watch, an it's always nice to know that something is FRESH. The seasonal flavors are awesome, and follow what's seasonally available...including corn, pears, lavender, nectarines, blood oranges...and the list goes on.

Apparently they change the flavors of the ice cream frequently though classic flavors such vanilla and chocolate are always on their menu. My day's flavors were vanilla, TCHO chocolate, nectarine, and lemon verbena. I ordered a kiddie size of lemon verbena and maybe I chose the wrong flavor or something, but I was quite disappointed. It tasted quite gross and while I was thankfully glad I ordered a small size, my friend who ordered vanilla had a great experience. Anyway, service is slow, but that's because the ice creams are made to order. For the time spent on waiting in line, limited flavors, no sample tastings, the amount of ice cream given, and the price itself, it may be worth the experience to try liquid nitrogen ice cream. But I rather have ice creams from other shops that carries more varieties in flavors, given in bigger quantities with less the price paid at Smitten.\n\nI was not quite 'Smitten' with my flavor, but I might want to try other flavors for myself to see if I could see it happening.", "author": "Kim L."}

It was rather fluffy, not really what I was expecting based on past experiences.

I've been searching and tasting many SF local legit ice cream shops (none of those chains like Baskin' Robbins, Double Rainbow, etc.) and Smitten was a go-to on my list of ice cream places to try.  Liquid nitrogen does makes a difference.  A bit on the pricy side, but hey, what can you say?  $6 for a regular (3 scoops of ice cream) made with liquid nitrogen, and the only shop that makes ice cream with such a chemical?  Definitely worth the treat.  Today's menu was a bit on the \"regular\" side: vanilla, early grey w/milk chocolate chips, salted caramel, TCHO chocolate...nothing interesting that stood out to me.  I was hoping I'd be able to mix/match, and after telling the cashier I wanted 2 different flavors, he said I couldn't mix flavors :/  But then again, all the ice cream is made to order (perhaps why no mixing), which is a PLUS in my book.  I ended up ordering the early grey with milk chocolate chips.  The texture itself: VERY smooth as most would say; flavors: I was able to taste the earl grey flavor but chocolate chips did stand out more than the ice cream flavor; I guess generally early grey tea doesn't have that strong a flavor.  Other than that, earl grey ice cream is one of my  newer go-to flavors.

Recently, I added in the strawberry syrup and that incredibly made it all even better. The strawberry syrup was freshly made and just went so well with the chocolate. The only downsides were that there was so little of the syrup and that it was a little too runny. I like adding the candied jalapenos mainly because they add an interesting texture to the ice cream experience. They are a vibrant green and red, not noticeably candied, and not at all spicy. I got the ice cream in a cone one time, but I didn't like that too much. I found the cone a little too flimsy and it ended up just getting in the way of my enjoyment of the chocolate. \n\nI like the pop-up shop in Hayes Valley, though I hope they get a more permanent location soon so that I can sit inside somewhere to enjoy my ice cream. Were I not so insane for this ice cream, I'd be fine with living through the winter months without ice cream, but as it is, I want this ice cream now but it is just so cold to be eating ice cream outdoors... I'd still probably do it though, as the first time I had this ice cream, it was in the rain. Pouring rain. \n\nI'm pleased that they accept credit card and that they use Square which simply emails or texts my receipt to me. \n\nI don't like to experiment too much with ice cream flavors. I really really like the chocolate, so I'm really only there to get the chocolate. The one time I experimented was because I went late in the day and they ran out of almost everything.  They talked me into getting the Lemon Verbena, which I was skeptical about but decided to give it a chance. As they make the ice creams to order, there is no sampling.  The first taste of it was a little weird, as I'm not used to ingesting verbena, but it got better and I quickly finished the rest of it. However, for the rest of the night, I was burping up verbena and that was definitely not pleasant. It was as if I'd chugged a bottle of Bath and Body Works lotion. Blech! So no more experimenting for me-- I'll stay conservative with my ice cream choices (this applies not just to Smitten but to Humphrey Slocombe and Bi-Rite). \n\nFair warning, the wait can sometimes be long when you add up the time you are standing in line to order and then waiting as your order is made. However, the wait is totally worth it.", "author": "Jia min C."}

It is a cute stand with an enclosed seating area and an open kitchen so you can see your ice cream being made. Of course the liquid nitrogen is very, very cool, I'll give them that. But in the end, I came here for some ice cream - not matter how it is made. We ordered the Horchata and the Quince, and at first, I was ooooing and awwwweing at the magic of the liquid nitrogen. Then I tasted it, and my ooooing and awwwweing was replaced by a giant case of diasppointment. The ice cream was not cold, and I'll tell you it is strange to eat not cold ice cream. It was very creamy, but the flavors were dull and the texture reminded me of styrofoam. I really wanted to like it - I really did!

We waited 15 minutes to order.  We were told we could not have two kinds of ice cream no matter how big the cup because they want to serve their ice cream fresh right out of the mixer, and didn't want one to melt before the other was ready.  It turns out this comment was prescient.\n\nSo I ordered butter pecan; and she, chocolate.  My butter pecan came out in about 10 minutes and I waited politely for hers to come out so we could walk to the park and eat there.  We waited for 20 more minutes and my ice cream completely melted to soup: pecans sitting in milk.  Then she went up and asked how longer hers would be.  They asked her what she ordered and how much she paid.  We thought maybe they would give her a refund for having to wait 45 minutes for ice cream.  They didn't.  They got her ice cream immediately (relatively), and were only asking about how much money we paid so they knew what size to get.\n\nThey didn't apologize for us having to wait so long.  Our plan to eat ice cream together in the park was ruined.  We didn't have any more time anyway.  It was ridiculous that they wouldn't give us two flavors in one cup because they come out at slightly different times, but then they make us wait 30 minutes for hers while mine melts.  Also we are used to waiting in line at Bi-Rite, but at least that's the line to order and once you pay your money, you get your ice cream.  But Smitten made us wait 30 minutes AFTER we ordered, and even then, we had to complain that mine was melted and could they please make hers.  They didn't care we waited for a total of 45 minutes, nor that mine was completely soup by the time my friend got hers.\n\nGreat location, cool idea, ok ice cream, really bad customer service.", "author": "R F."}

I am a huge believer in supporting local small businesses; loved the story about the owner.  So I was really excited when I noticed that the owner was working behind the counter.  I ordered the strawberry ice cream.  Since this was my first time here, I wanted to watch everything.  I saw a batch of strawberry ice cream being made by a young lady and thought that was probably mine.  I watched as the  mixing blades quickly swirled around and around.  Then my friend and I noticed that a chunk of ice cream was coming out of the bowl.  We knew it was going to fall out.  Sure enough it did.  We watched as the young lady manning the machine picked up the chunk that fell on the counter and then put it back in the mixing bowl.  We thought for sure she was going to throw the batch away, but then watched in horror as she scooped the ice cream into a cup.  She called my name.  I didn't want to make a scene, so when I approached the counter I discreetly asked her  if she could make another batch because we saw what had happened.  She got very defensive and told me that their counters were \"100% clean\".  Seriously???  Then she started to say that she had thrown the bit that had fallen on the counter in the trash.  We told her we were watching her the entire time.  At that moment the owner quietly reached over and took the bowl of ice cream that this girl was trying to push on me.  She pulled the girl aside and then they went in the back and didn't come out for a while.  When they finally emerged, I received no apology.  The owner never made eye contact with me, just went back doing whatever she was doing.  The girl didn't apologize.  It turns out another customer was also watching the same batch we did because he had also ordered strawberry.  Because of the owner's lack of concern over the situation, he stepped up after the owner returned from the back and explained what had happened.  Maybe he thought she didn't have the whole story.  Well, she got the whole story.  Again, no apology.  It seemed like she didn't even care.  I was still willing to give the owner the benefit of the doubt.  I finally got my ice cream after a looong wait.  My ice cream was handed to me by a completely different employee.  Again, no apology from the owner or the girl.  Well, that sealed it for me; I'm never coming here again.\n\nI really wanted to like this place.  I left with my sad $6 cup of ice cream feeling jipped.

I was glad they used real mint, and didn't use neon food coloring. Having grown a variety of mint I know there are a number of different types. Somehow this one had kind of an overwhelming after taste, which I could not get rid of the rest of the evening. The chocolate bits were really good.\n\nThe process definitely makes for a softer, smoother texture, but it was so cream laden and melting so quickly it basically tasted like mint flavored butter. I had gotten a regular which was definitely more than I needed (regardless of taste), but it was so heavy I ended up having popcorn for dinner my belly felt so full. \n\nThe cone itself almost overpowered the ice cream, it was very cookie like and a bit too sweet and flavored for my taste.

It was tasty - but we did have larger crystals, so we weren't too blown away by what they advertised. \nThe consistency of the chocolate flavor was much better, but it was quite a wait - we almost finished our caramel (regular size) when the chocolate flavor was ready. \nOverall, it was too sweet for our taste. Although they recommended almond brittle to go with chocolate ice cream, we had walnut as topping - just plain walnut, not roasted nor sweeten. There was a little piece of almond brittle mixed in so we had a taste. It was way too sweet - so glad we didn't follow their recommendation.

Pretty cool that you get to watch it being made, but that also results in long wait times.  I tried the TCHO chocolate, salted caramel, and rhubarb crisp (the seasonal flavor).  Rhubarb crisp was the favorite!  The machine/operator consistency may cause the ice cream to be a little too melty or a little to cold (tongue burn!) but the flavor and concept are amazing!  There is a nearby park where you can sit and eat (since this is just an ice cream stand with no seating).

So we went to Smitten Ice Cream just a block away from Patxi's Pizza. So when i got there it wasn't that full they seved us pretty fast i got a single Strawberry and my cuosin a Kiddie chocolate. We waited for like 6min which is not bad and thank god we got there at the right time there was a big group that came after us.  So i been wanting to taste this ice cream for a pretty long time, when i first got my ice cream i notice that it was a small portion for 4.65 ?? so yeah i took the first spoonful of Strawberry ice cream, \" mmmmmHMMMmmm huh?\" It was creamy, fresh, and think but i really didn't tast the flavor that much ?, it fel like i was eating a diet ice cream, it tasted more like milk, cream and sugar. The straberry flavor was not overpowering which made it feel weird I did like the pieces of strawberry  thats was good but it was nothing special especially after trying a lot of popular ice cream places in SF.  My cousins chocolate ice cream was better i liked it a little more but still it felt plain. It was a three star for me, my cousin loved it idk why she was like having a Ice cream orgasm ?? so idk  it might depends on the person yet again she hasn't tried good ice cream places like MItchell's or Bi-rite so yeah hahaha. \nIts worth the try but i might come again to try that Salted caramel .", "author": "THe real TrUth D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-05-04", "description": "I truly wanted to like Smitten Ice Cream.  I heard about the concept and thought it was a great idea.  I make ice cream regularly at home, and, since I've started, I've been disappointed by most commercial ice creams.  I love the simplicity of homemade ice cream--a few ingredients, a little time swirling in the frozen canister, and . . . you've got a delicious treat!  In my experience, however, the best part about homemade ice cream is not the initial, partially-frozen, somewhat droopy product, but rather the smooth and creamy FROZEN dessert that most would recognize as ice cream.  This, of course, takes a little time in the freezer.\n\nSmitten Ice Cream specializes in that in-between product.  They make ice cream to order, or, more accurately, they freeze ice cream to order (the base is pre-made ahead of time, but probably the same day).  This takes a lot of time because they can't simply scoop some ice cream once you order it.  Although the flavor is perfectly fine, I had expected their process to yield very cold ice cream because of the liquid nitrogen they use.  Today was hotter than usual, but, as others have mentioned, the ice cream melted very quickly.  My very first bite was not very cold, at all.  After waiting for nearly 30 minutes in the hot sun, I was more than ready for an ice cold dessert.    \n\nWhich raises another point:  the wait time.  After I ordered, I waited about 30 minutes!  When I arrived to find only four people in line ahead of me, I thought \"looks like this won't take that long after all.\"  I was wrong.  Generally, I do not mind waiting for great food.  I'll stand in line for over an hour at Dottie's.  I love Brenda's.  I'll wait for Tartine bread, for god's sake.  But this ice cream is, sadly, not worth the wait--or the price.  At $5.50 for a slightly-larger-than-average scoop, it's a little too steep compared to the other, wonderful ice cream shops in SF.  Bi-Rite and Humphrey Slocombe are less expensive and, even with a long line, they don't take as long.  (As an aside, I fear the prices are high because the wait is so long; they can't sell that many cups, so they need to charge more for them.  I bet if they could speed it up somehow they could charge a little less.)  Now, as a purveyor of an \"artisan\" product, I did not expect a drive-through level of efficiency.  The problem is that, with ice cream in particular, there is a level of instant gratification going on.  It's hot, you want something cold and yummy, so you order an ice cream cone.  You don't call a place, make reservations, look at a menu, order, and eat it in three courses.  It is usually a spontaneous event, and the experience is at its best when eating the ice cream takes longer than getting it.  I'll wait a long time for Dottie's because, once I'm inside, I can have the leisurely brunch that everyone else was having.  With ice cream, you don't typically spend enough time eating to justify a long wait, so when you have to wait for a long time to get something that takes only a few minutes to devour, it feels like a let down.\n\nDespite the temperature, time, and cost problems, I still wish Smitten the best.  I think, with some simple changes, they can succeed in SF's competitive ice cream market.  Here's a few tips that I believe would improve the experience:\n\n1.  Show off your amazing, scientific, patented process!!  If I did not know in advance, I would not have realized the method used to make my ice cream.  Make a sign that describes the machine and how it works.  If you're going to insta-freeze ice cream like magic with liquid nitrogen right before our eyes, make sure we realize it!!  It would help to justify the price.\n\n2.  Tell us what is in the ice cream.  If pure and simple ice cream is the concept, explain that.  Today there were three flavors available on a large sign with plenty of space to list the ingredients for each flavor.  If you're using organic, local, sustainable, etc. products, tell us!  It would be great to know exactly what is (and isn't) in our ice cream.  It would also help to justify the price.\n\n3.  On that note, tell us the price!  And the sizes!  You have two cup sizes and a cone option.  There are three different prices to list.  Doing so will speed up the ordering process.\n\nThere you have it.  Three steps for a smoother operation.\n\nAt this point I'm not smitten.  I'm sure some people love it, but I did not.  Smitten Ice Cream is just starting out, so hopefullly these suggestions will help.  I really hope that Smitten streamlines their operation, finds a way to cut costs without sacrificing qualtiy, and makes getting fresh ice cream a little easier.  Hayes Valley needs it!", "author": "Matthew A."}

We both went with smalls, which would be kids size elsewhere, and it came out to $9.75. Very pricey for the size. It's worth noting that ice cream does not come out in the order that it was ordered, I'm not sure what their method is for getting out orders but we had to wait a bit while people who ordered after us were enjoying their ice cream.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-31", "description": "Finally tried this place. They offered different flavor each week. The ice-cream itself has good textures, creamy, and not forget to mention, it melted quickly so you better hurry finishing that ice cream. I thinks its because they made it on the spot which is quite cool using a special ice-cream make. However, here's the catch, the portion of the ice cream is compared with their price. Especially, the smallest one $3 and it was only half of a cup. It seems a bit pricey for me.", "author": "Immanuel L."}

It was so cute with the iPads as registers, the open arrangement of Kelvins churning out smooth, rich ice creams.  Aside from the novely of the storefront, the ice cream stood on its own.  I had the mint with chocolate chips.  The mint reminded me of fresh spearmint,  the chocolate just the right degree of bitterness, and the waffle cone tasted as though it just been taken out of the oven.  I loved it!  The flavors were limited, maybe three flavors?   But they really know what they're doing.", "author": "Betty T."}

The cookies added a little crunch and the ice cream was the perfect consistency.  So good that I'm not even taking off a star for the 6 dollars that two scoops cost us! It was worth it. Plus we met the owner and she's really nice and excited about her business, always a plus! The machines they use to make the ice cream are really cool; it is a fun idea to stand and watch your ice cream turn from liquid to...well, ice cream :)", "author": "sara e."}

Great stop for those out-of-towner or out-of-state visitors you might be hosting.  Vanilla - yum! Coffee - yum! Tcho chocolate I found to be a bit too bitter for my taste, but might appeal to others. Maybe they were using the 72%. My max on chocolate preference is 64%. The employees are friendly and it was my birthday - if they have any, they'll put a cannel (Robbie Brown) in your ice cream and light it, too, if the lighter is working. It's fun to eat outdoors for a change. Waiting for the ice cream is a bit tough when the sun is blazing on you or when the weather is cold, as eating this ice cream is an all outdoor experience - bring an umbrella or wear your shorts, depending.", "author": "Lia H."}

Not really.. Was it worth the $6.00 for the one scoop on the cone? Not really..

If you're into very thick, mild tasting, heavy cream ice cream - this is the place for you.  I love that they use fresh, local, organic ingredients, but this is what the ice cream I made with my own cheap little ice cream maker at home tasted like the first time I tried it.  I prefer milkier ice cream to creamier, so it really is a matter of preference.  Not a quality issue for sure.", "author": "Danielle B."}

I was curious about this place and the churned-to-order concept, but having waited far too long for a tiny, overpriced cup of excruciatingly sweet green tea ice cream, and then waiting a further 10 minutes for my friend to get his cup of so-so vanilla ice cream while watching the disorganization behind the counter, I  think I'll stick to Bi-Rite. It looks like a bargain compared to Smitten.", "author": "Catherine P."}

There weren't many people in line ahead of me, but it still took over 5 minutes to get the ice cream.  I see this being a problem with longer lines.

I will definitely try it again and look forward to chocolate later this week.", "author": "Shannon S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-05-05", "description": "If you enjoy standing in line for 15 minutes for a $5.50 scoop of super rich ice creme, this may be the place for you.  I went when there was no line, tired the salted carmel.  I agree with some of the other reviews, good texture, but way too rich and definitely would not choose it over Mitchells or Double Rainbow. After two bites it was like eating a stick of butter.  I also don't get the made to order process, slow and basically if you buy regular ice creme and put it out on the counter for awhile you get the same texture.   Though you can't beat the location, Patricia's Green in Hayes Valley is great on a sunny day with Blue Bottle just down the road.  PS:  After my posting, Smitten's sent a nice email to me offering a free sample and stating they are working to improve their product.  I give them five stars for effort, but haven't yet returned to see if things have changed.", "author": "Daniel M."}

Let's be real, I'm Asian and a little bit lactarded but I ended up ordering a small salted caramel (two decent sized scoops). Unaware of the gimmick, I thought I was just getting expensive ice-cream so I was surprised when the shop keeper denied my usual request to mix up one scoop of this and another scoop of that. Oh well, two minutes later my ice cream was high steaming in a metal contraption and I realized I was at a \"special\" ice cream stand. Was I smitten? It was indeed creamy and icy cold, dense like frozen custard. It tasted like burnt caramel hmmmmm. Yeah it was pretty good but mostly I was just smitten with the perfect day I was having and ending my afternoon with this icy goodness in the park surrounded by puppies. I knocked off a star because I was really confused with where I was and the \"specialty\" of it. No signs which read: warning, liquid nitrogen about to be used in the making of this ice cream. Maybe I wasn't looking hard enough.", "author": "Festher C."}

As my boyfriend and I were looking at the favors and deciding what we wanted, with no one behind us mind you, the lady taking orders was harsh and rushing us as if we were holding up the line...once we were ready, or as ready as we were allotted time for, we ordered.  Not having the easiest or clearest menu to read, we asked for something incorrectly and were responded with short tones that stunned me into ordering something that I didn't really want as to not have to converse with her again. Not only did I feel her customer service skills were severely lacking with ME, but as we waited for our ice cream to be ready, I heard the way she was talking to customers that came up after us that had never been there before asking how it worked and she was explaining it rudely and as if they were completely incompetent and totally wasting her time. I understand that YOU know how it works because you work there, but someone, a customer, whom has never been there, deserves a little more than was delivered.  As the gentleman left, not purchasing anything, I over heard him say, \" why do I feel like the STUPIDEST person after talking to her!?\"  Nice.", "author": "Derek D."}
