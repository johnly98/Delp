However, the only thing keeping this place from being a 5 Star place in my opinion is the time you have to spend waiting. Generally for lunch, the speed is pretty fast but when it comes to the early breakfast hours this place runs at a snails pace. Even for a cup coffee expect to wait about 10 minutes. That being said, the food is definitely worth the wait.", "author": "Anthony O."}

I've had them several times since, but paperwork doesn't take precedent over good food ...  I had the full stack (3 slices vs 2 in short stack) and the quality was consistent with previous orders. Toast was hot, with butter and just a bit too much powdered sugar. However, the toast was well seasoned and kept its shape when cut with the table knife. A side of scrambled eggs completed the protein and for under $15 a delicious noon time breakfast was to be had.

Their soups are hearty and savory for a cold brisk day and always come with a sweet roll or slice of sourdough.  Their roast beef sandwich is tasty on a fresh sourdough roll and even better toasted.

Unless you tell them otherwise the burger is grilled up medium rare with pink juices flowing throughout your plate.  Grilled onions and melted jack cheese is piled on top of the oversize burger which is served on a French baguette.  What caught my attention on this particular burger was the good grilled meat flavor of the burger.  It didn't taste like the oily ground beef that can be experienced at so many hamburger eateries.  This was good grilled beef taste like you get at home from your own barbeque.  The sandwich comes with very good shoestring fries.\n\nI did mention breakfast also.  My employer has me working a swing shift these days so I don't get to have breakfast here too often anymore.  The omelets were always among my favorite things to order; big three egg omelets with lots of stuffing, red skinned potatoes and the toast of your choice.  The one breakfast item I've missed the most ... that would have to be the golden Belgian waffle with fresh strawberries, a dusting of powdered sugar and whipped cream.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

My buddy was busy getting a new car and we were supposed to meet for dinner.  He was South of Market while I was up near Twin Peaks.  Gee... where can we go where a) it's not far from both of us, b) parking will be easy, and c) the food will be fresh and with a decent selection.  That's how we met here.  I called to make sure they were open as I remembered that they only open for dinner three or four nights a week.  When we entered the restaurant, the owner Mark immediately said, \"I thought that was you on the phone\".  Gee... is my voice that easy to recognize?  We waved to the chef Sal in the kitchen (one of the original cooks/chef of Mama's... yes, that Mama's).  Because my pal is on a special diet, we needed to make sure there was a variety on the menu.  We ordered the following:\n\nHim                                                         Me\n\nHouse salad - standard                     Cup of New England Clam Chowder\ngreens with tomato and light             - decent flavored with plenty of bacon\ndressing                                                bits and clams\n\nCup of Split Pea soup -  I                    Chicken marsala, substitute Rigatoni\nalways think of the Exorcist                (special with NY Steak dinner)\nwhen someone orders                        instead of veggies or potatoes - I'm a\nthis.                                                          sucker for mushrooms which made\n                                                                   this fine with me.\nGrilled Swordfish with red\npotatoes - looked healthy\nalright.\n\nSince I was heading to Alfred's the next night, I passed on the red meat to\ngive my heart a rest.  Since we were on this health kick, we passed on desserts too.\nOverall, it was a nice homey experience.  Mark told us that he was booked the next two Saturdays for private parties... good location for this, given that the entire Flower Market parking lot is FREE to their disposal.  In previous dinners, they would comp us appetizers, but, given the economy and our judicious diet, it was probably better that they did not.

Based upon my crab cake order and the burger and fries ordered by Secret Squirrel, here are the things I expect from the Flower Market Cafe: \n\n1. Put crab meat in the crab cakes. If there is crab in them, please don't pulverize it, and please make them thicker, leaving off at least half the bread crumbs so that I don't think I'm eating a fried breadcrumb cake.\n\n2.  When I order a side salad with the crab cake appetizer and the waitress fails to tell me there is already a salad with the crab cakes, it bugs me. All right already, I wanted salad, but I didn't need two entire salads. You could have told me, okay?   \n\n3. Nice mango salsa, but it wasn't necessary to completely drown the crab cakes with it.  That is, unless you intentionally wanted to hide them from view and taste, in which case it's okay. \n\n4. When a burger is ordered medium, that means there is some pink left in the middle. Hockey pucks are out of favor at the moment, at least in the restaurant industry. At least I hope so. \n\n5. French fries really, really shouldn't come out of a bag.  If I order mine extra crispy, that means they get left in the fryer a little longer. Mkay? Okay this is picayune, but it bothered me. \n\n6. It is preferable when serving a lot of burgers to have ketchup and mustard on the tables. If it's not, please don't make me hunt you down to ask for it. If you write burger and fries on your chit, you need to bring the condiments before the food arrives. This is especially true when you have a total of two tables to serve. \n\n7. A grilled vegetable sandwhich should always include more than the following: An overly-thick hoagie roll, one slice of grilled eggplant and a few slices of grilled red pepper. A bit of aioli, anyone? Some fresh tomato and lettuce? A slice of mozzarella cheese? Okay, how about some basil or something? \n\nOn the plus side, the service was friendly and prompt and refills for drinks were readily forthcoming. \n\nThere is a full bar, and drinks were offered, though we declined.

Not the best Italian restaurant, but definitely several notches above your generic Italian chain restaurant -- and it's not like San Fran is the best place for Italian anyway. \n\nIt is isn't cheap, so I can't say bang for the buck is best, but it is a nice room. \n\nAs to service -- as with a lot of places, it really depends on who you get. For dinner, although I did have a not-so-positive experience before, apparently that person is no longer there and I'm told the new staff is awesome.\n\nThe \"main\" chef, Salvatore, is downright hilarious and possibly the place's main attraction; once I was there with friends and family and he came out and spent most of the dinner chatting with us. He told us about all the famous people he cooked for (can't verify the truth of the story, but it was funny), and he tried to convince one of my friends (unemployed at the time) to actually come and work for him... Very nice!\n\nSo, this is how I'd put it: if you're yearning for Italian and are in the neighborhood (they do have free parking in the evenings, BTW), definitely give it a try.", "author": "Afonso I."}

So...honestly: I expected Denny's 'only-good-when-drunk' quality food, but I was pleasantly surprised when it was actually pretty decent!  And, except for the side salad I ordered in place of the hash browns (it looked more like the fixin's for a hamburger - seriously, I think that's what it was - on the real)....I would even go so far as to say the omelettes we had were \"Good\"!  \r\n\r\nI also gave them an extra star for the waiters being super attentive, really very nice!  ...Although, I don't know if it was because we were two of the four people in the place, or if it was because we were women with an all-male staff in attendance....but, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and simply give them credit for giving such excellent service (you would think it was a Michelin-rated 4-star restaurant!).\r\n\r\nSo, maybe the Flower Market Cafe wouldn't be my first \"Oh, let's go here!\" place for breakfast...but if I happened to be in the neighborhood...or picking up flowers, and hung over from the night before...well, hey - THEN it would be my PREMIER choice...", "author": "Van Ness D."}

Salvatore always makes it a special occasion by coming by our table and giving his personal greeting.  The food is comfort delight!  Food comes in great portion sizes, it's tasty and the wait staff has always been warm, attentive and friendly to us.  We plan to continue going here whenever we come to San Francisco.\n\nP.S. - We've never come for breakfast or lunch.  Can't comment on those hours of service.", "author": "R N."}

Some of the food was amazing, like the Pepper New York Steak. The Pasta was very good as well, but their signature shrimp dish didn't seem to fare so well in are party. Bar is stocked but bar has very few choices.\n\nThe worst part of the experience was the dumbfounded and confused looks from our server.\n\nThe atmosphere was very nice and the night was perfect for sitting out on the patio. I would eat here again, but perhaps on a livelier night when their servers may be more suited to doing their job.", "author": "Jaron W."}

I think its because the staff and owner are very nice people.  It doesn't really feel like a restaurant to me, more like being at home with my family where I don't realize how loud I am talking or laughing.  The first meal I ever had here I don't really remember as much as how full I was when I left.  That is a good indication that I enjoyed the food.  This most recent time that I went I decided to not order too much food so that I could really enjoy my entree.  I tried the calamari which I thought was tasty.  My mixed drink was especially yummy.  I decided on having the special - the swordfish.  I had it grilled and I thought it was cooked perfectly.  It was divine.  It came with broccoli and potatoes that were also very good.  I would like to try this place for brunch & lunch.  I definitely will come back again.", "author": "Kerry M."}
