Maybe I'm just ordering the wrong things?\n\nThe first time I got the strawberry pom creama with agar boba and 0% sugar. I'm used to getting 0% sugar with fruit teas because usually the fruit syrup is sweetened, but it was a huge mistake this time. The whole drink tasted watery and flavorless and the cream didn't mesh well with the strawberry. \n\nThe second time I got the mango coconut smoothie - also just weirdly flavored and not quite right. I feel like it would be hard to mess up mango chunks and coconut cream, but it didn't taste at all like I imagined.\n\nI'll probably come back to try the matcha drinks or rolled ice cream, but it's been a miss for me so far.", "author": "Katy Y."}

I've had rolled ice cream before at other places and was looking forward to trying STEEP after seeing reviews, but I don't think it's worth coming here a second time.\n\nThe descriptions of the rolled ice creams all sound delicious and I had a hard time choosing which one to try. I ended up picking the Coffee Meets Waffle: Andytown Roaster coffee mixed with waffle and coffee beans, topped with house whip and coffee beans - sounds delicious right? Sadly, the ice cream itself was quite icy and flavorless, with barely any hint of coffee. I forced myself to finish it because it was $7+, but the only part I really liked was the housemade whipped cream. \n\nI tried a bit of the Salted Caramel Pretzel as well and it was a bit better than the Coffee Meets Waffle - or at least, it had some salted caramel pretzel flavor.\n\nFree toppings is a nice gesture. I got almond flakes and fresh fruits, which they put on the side in a little cup so that it wouldn't fall off the ice cream. (The fruits were not very ripe or sweet either though.)\n\nMy sister also got the passion fruit aloe tea, which was supposed to come with passionfruit seeds; however, there were clearly no passionfruit seeds in her drink, and when she asked the staff working behind the counter, they said there weren't supposed to be any. Why list the passionfruit seeds on the menu then? Also just a warning that this drink is extremely sweet and they said they could not adjust the sweetness for it, so we ended up mixing in a ton of water to dilute it.", "author": "Ivonnie S."}

I like their fruit drinks since they use real fruit (fyi the sugar level for the fruit teas is actually the amount of fruit pur\u00e9e they put into the drink, not actual sugar). Go-tos are the Tangerine Kumquat Tea and Strawberry Pom Tea with agar boba. Their milk teas are a little too watery for me so I would stick with their fruit teas. The boba is usually just okay (sometimes it's too hard or not sweetened well) but they don't charge extra for agar boba so that makes up for it. A normal drink comes out to about $5.5 with a topping. I would go to Asha over Steep if it were closer since their teas are better, but convenience usually tends to win out.\n\nI don't normally come here for their rolled ice cream, but my favorite would have to be the oolong one!", "author": "Alice C."}

What other reason would I have to visit STEEP 3 times in 1.5 weeks? ;)\n\nBoba: I got the matcha latte and it was probably a 3.25 / 5. The middle of the boba was somewhat hard, but at least they were slightly sweetened. The latte itself was very milky, but could have used some more matcha flavor (sorry I compare everything to Asha's deep green beauties).\n\nIce cream rolls are cool to look at, but I'm not actually sure they're all that tasty. I've tried the thai tea, oolong, and matcha rolls. The thai tea was true to taste and fairly strong in flavor at that. The oolong was interesting too, but could have used some more flavor. The matcha was less strong in flavor. They tend to crumble if you eat them too soon after they're made, but if you leave them out for too long they melt fairly quickly. The texture doesn't work for me since I like ice cream to be creamy and airy.

The strawberries were a great complement, but I wasn't a fan of the red bean. \n\nORIGINAL OOLONG: My friend's pick. It comes with herbal jelly and boba. I actually liked hers better than mine. The tea flavor was strong but not overpowering, and boba is always a good idea! Tasted refreshing. \n\nCOOKIE CRUSH: My bf's choice, and probably my favorite of the three we ordered. It's a cookies&cream ice cream, with cookie whip, cookie crumbs, and an Oreo. It sounds like a cookie overload, but it was the perfect blend. Not too heavy.\n\nOne of our friends had the JASMINE GREEN MILK TEA, but it wasn't a community thing, so I can't say much about it...\n\nSIDE NOTE: There are additional toppings you can add for FREE!

There is no place near my work or home that does it, but thankfully, Steep is close to AT&T Park.  On a Sunday, my wife & I strolled in around noon before a 1:00 PM Giants game.  The place wasn't too busy, and everyone in front of us ordered boba or coffee.  \n\nAfter looking at the menu on the wall, I selected the My Thai while my wife chose the Silky Sesame.  After ordering, we waited on the side, where the server made the ice cream in front of us.  He poured the liquid mix onto a slab of really cold metal (probably cooled with liquid nitrogen from below the counter).  As the liquid started to solidify, he used two spatulas to shape and form the ice cream.  Once the ice cream gets to the correct temperature and consistency, he shaped it into a very thin square sheet, then used one of the spatulas to scrap the bottom, rolling the ice cream into its signature shape.  The rolls are placed in a bowl, then garnished with the toppings.  \n\nThis process took about 5 minutes, and the staff can only roll 3 orders of ice cream at a time, so be prepared to wait a bit if it's busy.

The menu is concise (in a good way) and they are generous with toppings. I tried the Thai tea rolled ice cream and enjoyed the flavor and texture. It seems like high quality stuff, and the price reflects that, perhaps overly so. Each ice cream costs $6, which is quite... steep (hehe excuse the pun) even for San Francisco. If you want something simpler without the gimmick, Crossroads Cafe has large ice cream portions for a good price and is walking distance. If you're willing to pay for the hype, then give Steep a try!\n\nI didn't order bubble tea, but boba was a topping on my ice cream.

Look across the street for the red Alno sign as your guide; it's the door after Splunk. \n\nThey have certainly capitalized on the trend of instagrammable food, so much so that there's actually a small photobooth with lighting and a phone tripod to get that perfect shot. Don't forget to capture that video of them freezing and rolling up the ice cream. There's a lot of time and effort that goes into this (much more than just scooping ice cream), so I can imagine how it might be a bit slow at popular times. For us, it was relatively empty near closing time and we were happy to take our time and watch the magic in the making.\n\nGimmicks aside, my thai iced tea ice cream was really great. I also tasted the oolong, which was good but too subtle for me. The actual amount of ice cream is pretty small, but there are plenty of toppings to make up for it (you can also get any extras you want to cram in there for free). I was a little saddened to realize that eating the rolls destroys their beauty and uniqueness, unless maybe you can withstand the cold to eat them like finger food super quick before they melt.\n\nI'm already debating if the next trip will be to try the cookie crush ice cream I was eyeing, the matcha latte, or a boba drink.

We both opted to add mochi because why not?\n\nSTEEP is reasonably priced and delicious, but not really that special after trying it once and getting the picture for social media (let's be honest...that's really all that matters, right?).

It's taken a REALLY long time for businesses to open in this part of SOMA, so when I saw STEEP's sign as they were constructing their spot, I was super excited.  The whole \"rolled\" ice cream thing took over the Internet and there wasn't any place for me to try it nearby.  Enter STEEP. Getting your rolled ice cream fix is now more accessible than ever.  My only rub? It's just OK in taste.  I still prefer my precious soft serve options and it's hard to deny the superior tastes of Humphrey Slocombe at the Ferry Building as well.  That being said, I did enjoy the Oreo mix concoction and watching them make it was mesmerizing too. I love that this is here now, here's to hoping that more shops like STEEP come soon!", "author": "Lisa I."}

I'm talking about Garden Creamery, Powder, Uji Time, and Steep.\n\nAt steep they have special tables with cooling elements on which they pour the liquid, Once frozen they scrape it up into a mound then carefully smooth it out into a thin square. Then they scrape it up row by row into nice little rolls and topped with yummy treats like boba, coconut jelly, mochi, etc.\n\nAs you may have guessed this is a very labor intensive process. So don't expect your ice cream to be ready quickly. I'm guessing 10 min at least? But it's very entertaining to watch so all is forgiven.\n\nA few minor quibbles -\n\n - I wish they had a better container for the ice cream rolls and toppings. Looks cute but you have to be very dextrous to eat without toppings falling all over the place. Then because toppings are on top when you're halfway through you're just left with ice cream with no toppings which makes me sad.\n\n - this is literally frozen water so it's not creamy or fluffy since it's not churned like ice cream. The rolls are actually very dense and I'm not sure I like how hard they are texture wise. You have to work harder with the spoon to even get a scoop and it just sits kinda cold in your mouth.\n\nEven on weekends this place is not too busy.", "author": "Jean K."}

I had ordered their basic matcha with boba and 100% sweetness (it was a long day and I just succeeded in completing a major project and needed a quick pick me up before getting back to my desk quickly) and when I picked up my drink, I saw that the boba was missing so I asked if they could add it. It took a few minutes for them to add it and by then I was running late. I grabbed a straw and started to head out, taking a sip at the door to find that it was not sweetened at all (I drink matcha on a very regular basis so while I was expecting a sweet drink the straight matcha was not horrible, just not what I needed this afternoon) and when I went back and asked about it, I had two different responses on the sweetness so I figured I could not trust having it remade (and I was late already.) I would suggest getting their ice cream as it is fun to watch them make it, but maybe skip their boba teas unless you want to go back multiple times to get it right.", "author": "Beth I."}

Because there was a big group of 7 of us, we took the opportunity to order all 4 flavors to try. I took a little nibble of eat. \n\n1. Matcha - so you can get this with the ice cream ROLLED into the ice cream or on the side or both. We got it on the side. It was so good, not overly sweet and not overly matcha powdery flavored either. The strawberry and red bean is a great compliment. \n2. MyThai - STEEP has some of the best Thai Tea in town and this in rolled flavor is exactly the same. creamy, again not overly sweet. it comes with coconut pudding and boba. This is was my time having their coconut pudding despite going to their original location forever. I will now be occasionally adding coconut pudding to my drinks. I'm not a fan of coconut but this was not over powering at all. \n3. Cookies and Cream - a favorite of 2 of my co-workers who finished it all. It's pretty much how you would expect it to taste and was just equally as good. \n4. Roasted Oolong - see original review\n\nAlso I'm a fan of their jasmine green milk tea too. Even unsweet, its just enough and you can def taste how fresh the tea is.

Also they don't skimp out on the toppings when you ask for more too. But realistically this is enough sweets for one person. Honestly, if you go to any other ice cream parlor, they easily charge you $4-$5 for a single scoop.

They alter flavors weekly, today they had C+++ (biegium chocolate), black and orange (orange cream). I ordered for a uji matcha roll that paired very well with fresh strawberries and red bean. The ice cream wasn't overly sweet but the red bean gave it a kick to the sweetness, which was perfext! I also ordered for a mango mousse with bubble.

Pouring milky ice cream in liquid form onto a cold stainless steel surface, the ice cream and its mix-ins are crushed, stirred, and folded over and over again. The resulting mix is smeared evenly across the countertop in front of your eyes and sits for awhile (allowing you to set up the perfect instagram story documentation) and cools until it hardens into ice cream form. They then carefully scrape the ice cream into 5 rolls and then put them into a bowl before adding toppings. Super awesome perk - toppings are free! Choose from chocolate shavings, cheescake bits, mochi, and/or fresh fruit. Luckily I was the only person in the store at the time, so there was no wait, but I imagine the line could get pretty long if they're busy since each roll takes at least 5 min to make since the liquid has to set for awhile, and there's only 2 countertops made for the rolling. \n\nStrawberry cheesecake + fresh fruit + mochi 4/5: solid strawberry ice cream, definitely more flavorful once the rolls melt a bit. Topped with a ton of fresh fruit and chunks of cheesecake, this was a great concoction, not too sweet. Mochi was kind of chewy and harder than I'd have liked, but maybe this changes from day to day.\n\nChocolate sundae 3.5/5: with the chocolate whipped cream and chocolate shavings, this was a little bit too rich for me. Would have opted for some other toppings to mix in, but nothing on the menu sounded like it would have made for a good match - except more chocolate shavings.\n\nThe novelty of this ice cream made this super exciting for me, but the people who work there definitely expect you to Snapchat, Instagram, and further document their ice cream rolling. They were even filming their rolling technique when they made my ice cream. There's a corner for you to photograph your ice cream rolls in front of a white backdrop with their hashtag #steepup. Perfect setup for all your social media needs. \n\nSuper clean, super modern, will be back for the milk tea drinks, hoping this is a solid SOMA boba joint as well.", "author": "Kathy T."}

They're not really that different from regular ice cream as the rolls start to melt pretty quickly, but it's fun for a moment. I just love the feeling that they're turning the milk tea into ice cream, which may or may not be the method, but the flavor of tea is definitely as strong as it is in properly brewed milk tea. And I LOVE tea flavors in ice cream! It's fun to have so many to try here.\n\nI wasn't a big fan of the pistachio, which was disappointing as that's also often one of my go-to favorites. HOWEVER, the Thai tea is total winner. And the special they had for taro is that rare flavorful taro that's not relying too heavily on sweetness to carry it.\n\nNot the friendliest bunch, but orders come out quickly enough.

Steep usually serves drinks/pitaya/acai bowls but now they expanded to tea infused rolled ice cream. Their new location is in a really quiet area as well as it being hidden. Their menu don't have many flavors yet since all their flavors are supposed to be \"tea infused.\" I got the oolong rolls since I never had milk tea flavored ice cream before which sounded really interesting. They have three ice cream machines but they were kind of understaffed during the time I went. Upside is that this week only, you can add as many toppings you want at no additional cost. Steep's boba never disappoints and their homemade grass jelly & coconut pudding is amazing.

It comes with boba, homemade coconut pudding, and a free topping.  I added strawberries.  Really friendly staff and clean chic little place.  They have a little photo shoot set up for your ice cream rolls.  I will come back to try other flavors.", "author": "Klo H."}

The earl grey milk tea snow rolls are really good though I don't think I would've put fruit topping on it. The strawberry tea is quite refreshing but not very sweet. The matcha strawberry lemonade has an extremely strong lemonade flavor though. Couldn't taste anything else.", "author": "Gayle Q."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-17", "description": "Very good milk tea (black) at 50% sugar. Their tofu pudding is an interesting topping: a bit crumbly, but tastes great, and the texture is nice in milk tea. I also tried their matcha rolled ice cream, which tasted fine but was just too tough for my taste---the opposite side of the ice cream texture spectrum from, say, the matcha soft serve at Uji in Japantown.", "author": "Blake A."}

The matcha rolled ice cream was very refreshing - not too sweet and didn't taste powdery. It came with massive amounts of fresh strawberries and red bean as toppings. Steep is less than a 10 min walk from the Caltrain station and I would highly recommend anyone to stop by for a quick snack", "author": "Sherrie Y."}

Very generous portions. In the end, the texture is not as creamy as I like, but it's still good ice cream (very Asian focused flavors like Thai tea, matcha, black sesame).", "author": "B. Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-09-14", "description": "I was really intrigued by their ice cream rolls so I tried the root beer special - yummy!  I liked the unique whipped cream on top, although I wasn't sure how to eat the ice cream rolls (whether to pick up with my hand or try to cut it with spoon).  Eating was a little tricky although when it started to melt was much easier to eat.  Would like to be able to mix and match ice cream flavors (half & half flavors) so hopefully they will do that in the future.  I also ordered the organic honey chrysanthemum iced tea and to be honest it tasted medicine-like so wasn't a huge fan of this tea.", "author": "Terrie R."}

I also tried the thai tea one and the oolong one. My group and I didn't love the Thai tea flavor - it tastes exactly like the drink but it just didn't mix well with the toppings she got. The oolong one was good too - it REALLY tastes just like the tea!", "author": "Sophia L."}

The flavors are not as intense as at other places.  And though it looks nice because it's so new, I've walked in and there's boxes piled up against the walls and drink prep area is not that clean.  Hopefully these are just start up issues cause they're so close to my work!", "author": "Monica K."}

Their ice cream was also really good. I was going to say the only downside is that they close early (was 7PM I think) but I just noticed that they extended their hours!!!", "author": "Karen D."}

If you're really into ice cream that tastes like the real Thai tea, matcha, oreo, and black sesame, I would recommend coming here.  It's not as sweet as usual ice cream.  They hand roll the ice cream in front of you, and although it doesn't look like much, it is enough to get by ;).  I give this place four stars for their ice cream taking on authentic flavors, since it isn't like the usual green tea or Thai tea mixed with vanilla.  Sometimes they have specialty flavors like.peanut butter toffee, and on their current menu strawberry cheesecake. Unlimited toppings!  You can actually taste the flavors, and... It doesn't melt too fast, so enjoy. I would definitely come here to try the other flavors, but for me it might be a one hit wonder kind of place.  Nonetheless it's worth coming to try all the flavors and you'll see that they use actual ingredients (strawberry preserves in your strawberry cheesecake).", "author": "Janet T."}

They say they it has mango pur\u00e9e in it but the tea is bland and tasteless. I was expecting somewhat of a smoothie texture, but it looked like there was maybe 2 drops of pur\u00e9e inside. The coconut pudding add on also looked and tasted like it was tofu in my tea. Bland. If you like tasteless bland tea, you'll love this place.", "author": "Kelvin T."}

My friend got the Cookies and cream one which also had 3 rolls of ice cream, mini Oreos, and whipped cream. Found metered street parking on a Wednesday afternoon, and there were a lot of people waiting when we got there.

The whole vibe from the environment and the staff was just, cold. The place is in an office building and didn't look like it was meant for food service. The most flavorful ice cream was the oolong.

Very decent amount and the ice cream is really good especially when it is on a hot day, it's very amazing when you add milk tea a long with it too. OH YEAH! Don't forget to add mochi and fruits! That is the best part of the rolled ice cream! So why 4 stars? The line is way to long and there was only 2 people working that day. Other than that, I love this place a lot.", "author": "Clayton L."}

I got the oolong flavor here and it's got va really good tea flavor. The ice cream was a little harder compared to others so it gives it a bite vs just tasting like regular ice cream. I was worried the toppings would be hard, but the boba and grass jelly was really good with it. The drink was ok though, they had crystal boba though which I've been craving a lot lately. I'd come back if I'm in the area!", "author": "Katherine T."}

Maybe the ice cream is more exciting.", "author": "Sharlene T."}
