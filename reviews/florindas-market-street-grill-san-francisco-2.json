We had a party of 12 center next to the roaring fire place. Chef Art was very attentive to organizing the dinner, he emailed and called me several times to confirm the menu. Chef Art gave me several choices for the main course (which was very reasonable). Started with a mixed green salad with champagne dressing topped with spiced pecans and crumbled blue cheese, everyone finished their salad. The main course was a choice of Roasted Chicken, Filet of Salmon or Beef Tenderloin which included asparagus, spring vegetables & fingerling potatoes. Everyone raved how delicious and tender the meal was. Once we were all stuffed, out came a very decadent dessert, Chocolate Mousse cake with Kahlua Creme Fraiche, very rich and delicious.  I can't thank Chef Art and his staff enough for the wonderful experience and the exceptional meal we all enjoyed. I would highly recommend the restaurant for weddings, parties or for a meal before the theater, it won't disappoint you.", "author": "Sandy M."}

Nice atmosphere very classy.  The menu is a bit limited.  First visit was much better then second.  Ordered a sandwich with avocado.  No avocado unfortunately I realize this halfway through.  Friend ordered truffle fries got regular fries.  I said something to the waiter and instead of apologizing he offered to get me a plate of avocado but said nothing about getting my friend the correct fries    Is it just me or isn't our waiter supposed to check the orders before they deliver them to your table?  For an upscale place with a fairly high prices I would think there be better service.  We ordered a dessert to share and he did put a candle in it for my birthday.  In my opinion that should've been free because of the mess up with our lunches.  \n\nUpdate... 5/9/18:   The place is terrible.  We had a reservation.  We were seated only to be told there was no bartender and a couple things were not available on menu. So no drinks and well the place was empty so that told us what was up.

They have no hours posted so nobody is aware until they get here it doesn't open until 5 pm - on Saturdays at least. My main complaint: they have a separate \"bar menu\" and \"restaurant menu\" - mind you the bar is INSIDE the restaurant, but if you want something off the \"bar menu\" then you can only sit in the \"bar area.\" The bar menu and appetizer menu are almost exactly the same, except the bar menu has a hamburger option with truffle fries. I attempted to order this in the restaurant and the waitress tells me \"that's for the bar, we can't because people may come in and see you eating it and it's not on the menu.\" Here's a wild idea: PUT IT ON THE MENU THEN! The wine was mediocre at best and their food is far from the best on the street. My suggestion, go somewhere else.

The staff are helpful and friendly, the location is very convenient if you are going to one of the local theaters, but there is nothing outstanding about it.\n\nOur meals were of a reasonable size, but did not stand out as anything special, especially considering the cost of each plate.

They are situated in the common entryway surrounded by the street, Florinda's, Starbucks, and the hotel desk. You have to get a card-key to get in and they seem to be watched by folks who want to get in (Starbucks customers, transients, etc).  I don't want to be the police for someone's bathroom and it's uncomfortable to deal with \"hold the door\" or \"let me in\".

Orpheum theatre is just across the street. If you drive past the hotel make a right turn on the next street and you'll find civic center parking on your left and a private parking on your right ($20), straight ahead is valet parking ($40 plus tax). We had no idea that the $20 parking was the same one we made parking reservations for Jersey Boys (online it was Parking Panda for $40). It was Superbowl weekend in SF and traffic was a bit tight in the city. Left Santa Clara at 3pm & arrived at the parking site at 4:15. The rest of our group arrived later and had no problems with parking at all. Restrooms in the lobby were secured and had to be opened by an attendant. \n\nWe made reservations for 5:30pm and were seated as soon as a table for 8 was ready, took about 5 minutes. We ordered the potato bacon soup. It was creamy & full of flavor, small cuts of bacon & potato added some texture. We cleaned up the bowls! The other couples had the salad & the garden flatbread. Not a morsel was left on the plate. Later on, the entrees arrived. My steak was med rare & was juicy. The salmon was not dry & the lamb chops were delicious! For dessert, I enjoyed every bite of the lemon dome. A good balance of sweet & tart together. \n\nWe told the waiter that we had a 8pm show at Orpheum & we took quite a bit of time to just sit & chill. I found our table to be the most entertaining with lots of laughs. We left at 7:15 and did not feel hurried by the waiter at all. Service was prompt, food was delicious & company was great.

I'm not sure what motivated me to enter the Hotel Whitcomb to try this place except that it was open at around 9:30PM when I finally got around to eating dinner after a long day at work. It looked like they already closed up the dining room, but the bar was still open. There was an older woman trying to seduce the bartender.

I went for the $22 Petaluma Herb Chicken with Beurre Blanc, Fingerling Potatoes and Baby Vegetables (photo: http://bit.ly/1ISyqHL) because I felt like a real dinner even though it meant overhearing Nancy discuss her gymnastic flexibility with the bartender. There was definitely a wedding banquet style to the plate presentation, but that didn't prevent it from being fairly tasty for a piece of poultry.

It was telling, as soon as we sat down, and I pulled up yelp, that the keywords messed mentioned we're about the Orpheum, the proximity, the theater, the shows.\n\nI should have them put two into together and realized that this was not a subtle clue about the restaurant.\n\nThe dining room itself was shabby. That's the only word I can think of to really describe it. Multiple lightbulbs were browned out or completely burned out throughout the dining room. Stains on the carpet. The wood on the chairs was chipped and faded. It reminded me of the hole in the wall diners you find in Santa Cruz, except this was in the heart of downtown San Francisco. I honestly expected a bit more.\n\nOur server was average. Not slow coming up fast. Not personable, not rude. Attempted to engage with her about the menu, didn't really get much feedback other than her saying the truffle fries were superior to the sweet potato fries. But I sort of had to pull that out of her. We went ahead and ordered.\n\nMy friend ordered the clam chowder, and said it was nothing special. I ordered a expensive negroni cocktail that was mostly ice. My friends chicken came and he said it was a bit dry. My chicken pesto sandwich came, and there was so much bread that that's all it tasted. Which would have been fine if it was spectacular bread. It wasn't.\n\nThe check for the two of us for lunch came to over $65. I've had far better branches for two in much nicer restaurants with far friendlier servers. For $30.

We were greeted right away by what we assume was the host who had someone's dinner in hand, he handed menus, told to pick any table we wanted and make ourselves at home, so that he could deliver what he was holding--ok not the best first impression.  Water was filled right away and after a moment bread was delivered to the table, problem was we didn't have plates--one of my friends actually had to get up and ask for plates.  We then watched and heard the host drop a check off at the table behind us and when the woman at the table went to take it, the host continued to hand it to the man at the table saying \"the gentleman always gets the check\". Everyone at the table was stunned. \n\nAnd then it got even better...we ordered our food. Two of our dishes were delivered to the table, it was then that the waiter told the third party at our table that the kitchen couldn't make his food and this was after almost 40 minutes.

The first thing that I noticed when I walked in is how dark the entire space is, even natural light and floor to ceiling windows couldn't lighten the place enough during lunch time. Dark forest green gold and red(?) not s food color scheme for a dining room in my opinion, nonetheless it was dark. \nThe service was lackluster, my mom and I went in for lunch and were greeted by a hostess whom I presume was also the manager. There were two other small tables occupied. This is the part that made me knock off two stars, the service or lack thereof. Our waiter (older Asian man) didn't introduce himself, offer water or the complimentary bread the other tables had. Although there literally was almost no one in the restaurant. He took our order and didn't offer drinks I had to stop him and add our drink order. He was very attentive to the other tables, and to be honest I think we didn't receive good service because of how we were dressed( in jeans) while the other patrons were having work lunch meals. Maybe he assumed we wouldn't tip well enough ? We ripped accordingly to the service we received.\nThe food was nothing special, not worth 16$ per sandwich if you ask me. The soda was borderline flat. We both had the pesto chicken sandwich and it was okay, the French fries were over salted . \nOverall I wouldn't venture this place again, not even if the meal was free.", "author": "Stephany R."}

I called to make a reservation and was told that they probably wouldn't be able to take such a large group until I said I wanted it at 5.  No problem.  We got there and they put us at a long table and the room was very nice.  They didn't tell us that the table was made up of three small ones put together so there were ledges between them.  This caused someone to spill their drink all over themselves and the table. \n\nThe service was horrible!  It took so long for someone to come to our table my mother in law and sister in law went to the bar to order drinks, and was told that they couldn't order them there and take them back to our table.  They had to order them at the table.  WHAT?!\n\nWhen my daughter ordered Sangria, the waiter looked at her like she was speaking German and then was told that they couldn't make it.  This wat a full service bar.\n\nWe wanted to split the check because there were 8 of us, and everyone was responsible for themselves.  The waiter said remind me when I bring the total and I'll split it out.  When it came time to that we started going over what everyone had and this seemed to be more then his brain could handle.  Thank god we had someone who runs a restaurant with us.  She took over and got it all straignted out. \n\nIt was my youngest daughter's birthday and when we mentioned that to him he smiled and said happy birthday.  They don't give anytype of cake or ice cream.

The bread was delicious as well. Basket full of sourdough, rye & olive pecan bread. Yum!\n\nOnto the seafood linguine.

Especially so close to the Tenderloin border, there aren't many other sit down options near the theater, which makes this place pretty packed the hour before a show at the Orpheum.\n\nWe all got burgers. That's what makes up most of the menu here for lunch, but beware that they don't include fries or anything on the side! And it doesn't mention anywhere on the menu that you can order a side of fries or onion rings. Weird that they wouldn't put those printed on their menu I think...why are they secret?? The onion rings are very fried and battered but that made them extra extra tasty and bad for you at the same time. I loved every bite. The fries were okay. \n\nMy burger came with capers and roasted peppers and swiss cheese on it BUT it was supposed to also come medium rare and it was definitely fully cooked. Strike 1 there.\n\nI also had to ask for water twice, and if I hadn't asked I never would have gotten a refill it seems. Strike 2.

We arrived at 5:30 pm and the show started at 8pm so we had plenty of time.  \n\nWhen we arrived, we were impressed by the very nice traditional decor. The restaurant has vaulted ceilings, a large fireplace at one end (which had a nice fire on it to warm a typically cold San Francisco summer day).  The chairs are high backed with hunting scene designs, the tables have white tablecloths (but with a white paper on top).   The bar area has beautiful stained glass ceilings and a stained glass window behind the bar.  It is good to find a place with such traditional decor in this era of ignoring history.  The restaurant entrance is inside the hotel lobby.  The lobby itself is a great traditional architectural gem with marble walls and columns an a carved wooden ceiling. \n\nAt 5:30 pm, the restaurant was mostly empty.  We did not have reservations, and the staff said that it is a very full night (many reservations were made by theatre patrons), but they found a nice table for two for us between the fireplace and the windows looking out on Market Street.   Later, when most of the patrons arrived, the restaurant was completely full, so reservations look needed on theatre performance nights. \n\nSince we arrived 2 hours before the time we wanted to go to the theatre, we asked the water for a relaxed service to fill the time.  He agreed and everything was nicely paced.  [based on some of the other reviews, this probably insures a better experience].\n\nShortly after we were seated, a pianist began playing on the grand piano in the bar area. The music and the decor created a very elegant ambiance. \n\nMy wife had the clam chowder soup which was very good, thick with clams.  The soup also had bacon in it which added a distinct flavor that she never had before and found very enjoyable. \n\nThere was a bountiful bread basket with both a purple bread with walnuts and also sourdough.  The bread was average in taste.\n\nMy wife had the Parmesan encrusted trout, laid on a bed with asparagus, little potatoes, and tiny mushrooms. Very tasty. \n\nI had the Osso Buco.  I ordered it with extra sauce and I'm glad that I did, as the amount of sauce was just perfect.  The meat was tender and very favorable. The potatoes and carrots were an excellent compliment. \n\nI had a glass of Merlot wine (Cono Sur 2008, from Chile), recommended by the waiter, which went very well with the Osso Buco. \n\nFor dessert, we had Chocolate Decadence and lattes.  The Chocolate Decadence was very rich and flavorful.  \n\nOverall, we recommend this for a leisurely before theatre dinner.  It is a bit on the expensive side ($95 for 2 including tip).   \n\nParking is nearby, but the best parking deal is a block away at the SOMA Grand garage on Mission (between 7th & 8th): $10 for 4+ hours.", "author": "Mike M."}

Frankly, given its location in a kind of nowhere part of town, the only reason I'd ever come here is for a pre-theater dinner or lunch.  What do they get wrong?\n\n1)  They can't handle the rush.  One would think if your raison d'etre is to serve the pre-theater crowd that you'd be setup to handle the rush.  Last night, I dined there and they were clearly overwhelmed:  took 10 mins to get someone to ask if we wanted a drink, the manager was helping serve plates, my clams were cold because they sat waiting at the kitchen too long before being served.\n\n2)  The menu is too fancy-wancy.  I don't want brick-pressed quail with truffled risotto before the theater.  More importantly, my kids don't.  It was very hard for my 13 year old to find anything to order.  Since no one wants dubious fancy food, they should simplify things.\n\n3)  The decor is kinda old and ratty.  Not the end of the world, but they could use a facelift\n\nLet me play Gordon Ramsay here (in the Kitchen Nightmares sense).  This place needs to cater to the pre-theater crowd with a special fast-service three-course meal where the selections are simpler, more limited, and served faster.  Think:  3-5 choices for each of starter / main course / dessert along with a fixed price and fast service.", "author": "Dave K."}

Good to know they don't stiff you on the alcohol =) My strawberry daiquiri was good but they could have blended it a bit more. There was still chunks of ice so I couldn't use the tiny straws. \n\nWe ordered the battered calamari with eggplants and chef's chosen cheeses. The calamari dish was good. The sauce has a bit of an after kick to it. The cheese dish was okay. Didn't really care for it. It would have been better with crackers instead of bread. Speaking of bread, the bread they give you for starters was cold and the butter was too hard to spread. Here's some advice, warm the bread or at least the butter.\n\nOn to entrees. I ordered the seared ahi tuna. My bf, the lamb chops. Our friends had the linguine pasta, steak, and salmon. My ahi tuna was disappointing. It seems the tuna wasn't really fresh and the seared part was really spicy and kinda nasty. The noodles was cold and tasteless. My bf's dish was okay. The lamb chops were a bit small. It seems the only good dish was the steak and salmon. Total was a little over $60 per person. Which to me was not worth it. I was still hungry afterward and was tempted to go to the Burger King across the street. Which in my opinion would have been a lot better.

We ordered wine and a few more drinks and then, after taking our dinner order, he returned with 2 orders of Crab Cakes, compliments of the chef.  Cool.  Those are a bit pricey on the menu so we'd skipped them.  Wow they are great.  Kel and I will probably order them again but share 1 order ($14).  For starters I had the Field Green Salad (good), Kel had Heirloom Tomato Gazpacho, yum (I tried it).  3 of the group went for the cheese plate which I snarfed off of, (thanks Pat), and one had the steaming sizzling mussels.

The bartender came by and asked if we wanted any drinks, but since we didn't know if they're definitely giving us a seat, we refused, and the bartender did not look happy at all.\n\nFinally, we got a table and sat down. We ordered our food (an appetizer and an entree each), but only one person decided to have a glass of wine. The waiter looked pretty upset, but we thought, ah well. The wine came in the middle of the meal and the waiter was pretty rude about putting it down.\n\nI got the black truffle risotto stuffed quail, with the artichoke bisque as my appetizer. Both dishes were ok. The artichoke bisque was a bit blend after a while because it really was just bisque with some cheese in it without much complex flavours. The stuffed quail was more disappointing -- the risotto was too soggy to the point that it felt like a runny paste, and the quail did not have much flavour to it. I did enjoy the huckleberry sauce on the side though. I did not have a taste of what the other people in my group were having, but the consensus was that they overcharge for the quality of the food.\n\nThat aside, throughout my dinner, the waiter was constantly bumping into my seat while he serves the next table, without ever apologizing. I know that it was a bit crowded, but it was getting annoying, especially during one of the times he almost knocked my chair over when I was eating.\n\nAt the end of the meal, we looked at desserts but also decided not to have any because at that point we were fed up with the waiter and the busboy's rudeness. However, when he learnt that we weren't having any desserts, he threw out a really sarcastic \"Thank you very much\".\n\nBasically, the only time we were being treated nicely was when the waiter presented the bill to us.\n\nOverall I still gave it a 2 because the food wasn't half-bad, just overcharged and I've had better at that price.

The prices seemed reasonable and it was really close to the show. \n\nWe made reservations but was running late but they didn't give us a hard time about it, which was great! \n\nWe ordered the following: \nCrab Cakes - YUM! love the red sauce they drizzled over it and the crispy noodles that were served on top. \nCaesar Salad - GOOD! I usually don't like my dressing to be heavy and order it on the side but this time I didn't. The dressing wasn't too heavy and it wasn't drenched on. \nSeafood Pasta - YUMMY! The pasta was cooked just right and the sauce was great. \nKid's Cheeseburger - it was HUGE! and really yummy! it's hard to mess up a burger \n\nI loved the service and it was really clean and nice inside. \n\nI would go back and try other things on the menu. Definitely a place I would recommend", "author": "Wendy K."}

Steak was prepared and cooked with appreciated attention, including restrained seasoning that we welcomed, served with tasty grilled asparagus done just right and delicious garlic mash potatoes.

A wine drizzle/sauce/reduction on the steak (and artistically drizzled across the plate), so presentation showed some finesse. Bread was fresh (if unspectacular sourdough); butter was good, authentic butter. \n\nHostess was pleasant, seating quick. Waiter was unsmiling, efficient, thorough.

We were quickly seated which was nice, and told the waiter we were going to see the show and only had 40 minutes before we had to be out the door and on our way.  \n\nI will acknowledge this was cutting it close, but we ordered \"easy\" things: clam chowder, tomato caprese salad and the crab cake to share.  Still, it took almost 30 minutes for the food to come out.  Given that 90% of the restaurant seemed like they were going to the show I would expect a little more organization during crunch time.  \n\nThe food was actually pretty good, drinks were not, and it was all a bit pricey.  For the three items above and two drinks we spent $60.  \n\nThe reason for the low mark was the service.  Our waiter took our order quickly, but that was about as far as the helpful service went.  I don't recall a greeting or even a smile. He seemed a bit annoyed by all of us theater goers in a rush. (news flash - don't work at a restaurant across the street from the Orpheum)  He brought out my drink, but not my friends - didn't even acknowledge it was coming.  We had to ask again about 10 minutes later, at which point he did get the drink without explanation or apology.  We were getting nervous when our food hadn't appeared after 20 minutes (again, appetizers and soup) and had to flag him down.  The table next to use seemed to have some issues as well.  The waiter was definitely on auto pilot.  Perhaps he should acknowledge the food service industry isn't his calling.    \n\nIn the end we made it in time for curtain (you really can't beat the location) but left a 10% tip.  I'm sure he cursed us out and wonders why people who go to the theater are cheap, which in turn causes him to treat the customers with disdain, resulting in more bad tips.

The wife had always wanted to try it (she used to work up the street) and we had tickets to Wicked.  Normally, I'd say Tu Lan, but who wants to smell like tasty Vietnamese food during a performance?\n\nWe were a half hour early and seating was no problem.  Luckily, we were steered away from a window table, which would have been awkward (eating foie gras while looking upon Market Street's depravity, and them looking back is, well, weird).  \n\nThe dining room is one step below Liberace, with dark oak panels, really awesome chandeliers and dark maroon velvet.  I liked it!  But it is easy to make fun of.\n\nOur hostess was bubbly, but our server was flat.  Actually a little gruff which didn't match his white waiters jacket. His lack of warmth didn't bother me, per se , but I did notice it.\n\nWhile overall tasty, the food (like Wicked -- oo!) was uneven.  We had, among other things:\n\n- Fox island mussels, fresh anise, spoon mustard, ponzu reduction ($11) -- Salty and sour and actually really tasty.  The caramelized ponzu was really intense, and there's no dunking broth, but  it was good.\n\n- Dungeness crab cake, warm sweet corn & bacon salad, mustard dressing ($14) -- Large cakes, very tender, mild crab taste.  Crispy fried mystery fronds topped the dish.  Middle of the road, but tasty.\n\n- Seared Sonoma foie gras with seared pork belly ($16) -- Easily the best dish.  A winner.  I'm guesstimating the price, but I remember I thought it was really low.  The piece of foie was very generous.  It was a liiiitle gamy, which I thought was okay.  The pork belly was more like a pork shoulder with long filaments of meat surrounded by tasty charred fat.  The garnish of unpeeled, grilled cantaloupe wedges was so bizarre.  My wife and I said WTF at the same time.  It looked horrible but once peeled was really tasty and went with the fatty meat.  \n\nGoing to Market Street Grill, I understand the mixed ratings.  The restaurant has many contradictions.  Upscale interior, but inelegant service.  Upscale ingredients, but uneven execution.  \n\nThe wife hit the nail on the head:  it's about your priorities.  If you priority is to  have a decent dinner before a show with a restaurant that understands you're on a schedule, this is your place.  If your priority is to have a well executed dinner with polished service, and you're not going to a show, there are other options you'll probably be happier with.\n\nOverall tasty and pleasant, but it's not a destination restaurant.", "author": "Scott L."}

Need:  A local restaurant to enjoy dinner before the show.\n\nThe best location choice was obviously Market Street Grill.  I had been there before and was not all that impressed and the yelp reviews were not encouraging.  But here is the scoop.  There is a new chef in town.  I booked this with a bit of trepidation but I thought I'd try out the new chef.\n\nWe had a set menu and here is what we tried.  Many had the crabcakes including my husband and they were really awesome.  One huge cake with lots of crab and beautifully presented.  The clam chowder got RAVE reviews from one and GREAT reviews from another (one loved the bacon better than the other).  I had the beet salad and it was exactly as described and good.\n\nThe meal selections were salmon which was served in what appeared to be a very thin taco salad shell and most had that and everyone loved it.  The ravioli was very good per my husband, my pasta was really wonderful with tiny scallops and large prawns.  The NY Strip steak got RAVE reviews from the two that chose that.\n\nI fought to get the chocolate decadence on the menu - because let's fact it - you gotta have chocolate.  My husband had the cheesecake.  This is hands down the best cheesecake I have EVER had.  It was far more \"cakey\" than most and truly awesome.  I would love to be able to replicate it myself but probably a good thing I won't be able to.\n\nSo, in short I would say - give the Market Street Grill under the tutelage of Chef Ying Kee a try.  \n\nI realize this review might seem \"planted\" but I promise it is true.  \n\nBy the way - parking was awesome!  Go down Hyde cross Market and make an immediate right into the parking lots that charge $20 for the full event.  Go down that street and enter the Whitcomb Hotel.  You don't even need to walk to Market and over and it was raining so that was great!\n\nJudy\nRedwood Skytours Travel Agency San Rafael", "author": "Judy H."}

I didn't have high expectations after reading fellow yelpers' reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. We indulged in a delicious bottle of Pinot Noir, and gulped up the fresh sourdough bread they brought us to start with. We probably went through three baskets of bread. I guess you can say we were all starving! When it came time to order, the server asked us if we were going to the show, so that they could keep an eye on the time. I thought that was very smart and considerate of the server. It was like he didn't want us to rush. Anyway, I ordered the spring salad to start with, and the chicken for my entree. The salad was really fresh with goat cheese, pistachio, and arugula topped with a light vinaigrette dressing. I actually wished I hadn't shared it with my hubby - it was that good. The chicken was very moist and tasty. My husband enjoyed the ravioli, along with another person in our party who also ordered it.

Drinks that were ordered at the beginning of the meal arrived after desert. Ordered refills never arrived. I was unable to even get the waitress' attention to order a refill for half an hour.\n\nThey claimed that there was a mix up and misplaced our orders, but they miraculously found them when someone ordered from the other price fixe menu and his original order arrived. The portions were somewhat small but this wasn't made up for by the food being excellent. The food was tepid, the salmon was dry, and the risotto was slightly crunchy. I expect more for the price that they charged us, plain and simple.\n\nAnd then the final indignity, yes, I was in the party with Amy L. and Jessica S below.

Right.\n\nThey are refusing to issue chargebacks. Unfortunately, 2 of the people who were double charged used debit cards, not credit cards, so the only thing that the bank can do is declare the transaction to be fraud and cancel the card. That means that all of their automatic payments will have to be changed simply because this restaurant can't admit that it made a mistake.\n\nI was simply going to warn people I know that if they are going to the Orpheum, that this restaurant is overpriced, under staffed, not tasty, and incapable of handling the Orpheum load.

Our waiter was very attentive and we got out in 1.5 hours, plenty of time to get to the theater on time.   The restaurant is decorated very nicely, old-style decor, which I love, warm feeling.  All in all, it was a great beginning to our evening, topped by the BEST Phantom we've seen.", "author": "chris k."}

First off, the name Market Street \"Grill\" is deceiving, it is not at a grill type restaurant. Extremely small menu choices and all overpriced for the quality. My salmon was plain and overcooked, and the $15 crab cakes is really just one poorly cooked cake. I've had better frozen crab cakes. Now the bar tender is another issue, old, rude and overworked and can't make a drink to save his life. With an open bar and no drink menus , we gave him an ingredient list for a drink and he totally screwed it up. It was completely undrinkable and he refused to make me something else.

I didn't need it, but tried the lemon brulee', $9. It had a hint of lemon flavor but the texture was quick thick, more custard and near cheesecake-like.  I thought it was ok, but wouldn't order it again.  The topped it with a nicely rounded 1/2 sphere of spun sugar, really cool looking.  It's the closest restaurant to the Orpheum for dinner but you'll probably get better food if you're willing to trot down a couple of long blocks thru the depressed neighborhood and street people yelling at you to Farmer Brown's.  \n\nStaff here is very nice, all Asian.

We were greeted politely by a young woman who ended up being our server.  I was on crutches and she started escorting us towards some stairs obviously blind to the crutches and large knee brace I was wearing.  I paused and looked at her and she just said again for us to follow her, and then it hit her like a ton of bricks that I may not b able to walk up the stairs.  It was kind of rude, and I was extremely annoyed but we went up there anyways as she didn't make any true effort to rectify the situation.  She was very polite but could use a lesson in fine dining and on how to properly present the evenings specials.  We ordered two different pasta dishes.  The first was a spincah ravioli that was very good, but the portio was just a tad too small, it had, literally, 8 ravioli in the bowl.  The second dish was a bolognese which was average at best, and was a huge portion and look ridiculous in comparison to the first dish.  It seemed like they were trying to \"cheap up\" the sauce as it had large carrot chunks in it as well as celery, which is not common for that kind of dish.  The bath room requires a  card to enter because it's in the main hallway that it shared by the Hotel, the restaurant, and a Starbucks.  This is pointless since the door doesn't ever close and it is used by the public as well.  It was filthy,the ground was littered with paper, and the toilets were dirty.  I also had a glass of wine with diner, which was good, but still a cheap wine probably available at the liquor store around the corner.

I made a reservation for 12:00, but we showed up at 11:40-no problem.  We started with the Pacific trio appetizer-it was passable (the calamari was a bit too charred and the other items also had no flavor other than charred).\nMy husband ordered the catfish po'boy sandwich, which came with fries.  I tried it and it was very nice.  My mother-in-law had a hamburger, which came on a grilled brioche bun.    Hers also looked good.  I ordered the salmon on a bed of greens.  I was happy the portion size was not too large, as I didn't want to waste the extra and it would be awkward carrying a doggie bag to the Orpheum Theater.\nMy salad was okay.  The salmon was grilled and once again, the only flavor was of the charcoal grill.  Other than the bed of greens, the only other vegetables were a few pickled carrots and cucumbers on the side of the plate.\nDessert was quite good.  We ordered the chocolate decadence cake, which was moist with a nice sauce on the plate, and also the apple tart with vanilla bean gelato-mmm!.  Nice portion sizes on everything we ate except the salmon salad which was a bit small and the appetizer (which was small for 3 people).\nVery good service from start to finish.  About 25 minutes after we sat down, the room filled up-probably with other theater-goers.  The waiter did a great job and we had no problem making our show in plenty of time.\nI liked the ambiance of the room, too.  The carpet and drapes were a scotch plaid while the chairs were upholstered with fabric that had scenes of horses.  It was 1950's era San Francisco.  Plus, you get to watch the wonderful street show on Market St.\nOverall, very pleasant-just be sure to either make a reservation or get there in plenty of time before the theater.", "author": "rachel l."}

We started with the cheese plate, and while the selection was minimal is was made even less deireable by the fact that it was ice cold, clearly having just been plucked from a walk-in. \n\nFor our entree selection, the salmon on was undercooked and caused some stomach distress (although it was recommended by the staff) and the bolognese sauce was burnt and the spaghetti was over cooked. \n\nIn addition, the staff also seemed overwhelmed by the sheer number of tourists in large groups.\n\nWith all of the amazing restaurants in the area, best to stay away and hope for a better chef!", "author": "Julie M."}

I ordered the shellfish linguine and my mom got the salmon.  Her meal arrived with totally undercooked fish!  yuck.  My pasta was good, but nothing that deserved much excitement or the $21 price tag.  Oh well, I guess it was the only half-way decent place that close to the Orpheum.  Good thing Wicked was awesome and totally made up for our boring meal.", "author": "Wendy V."}

I had never even heard of it but wanted to try a Dine About Town before seeing Hairspray at the Orpheum and saw this restaurant was across the street. It's located in a hotel and let me tell you, this place has the most magnificent dining chairs I've ever seen. Western scenery tapestry, A-MAZE-ING. I spent most of dinner trying to figure out how to fit a chair into my purse and sneak it out of the restaurant. I think it would make a pretty amazing work chair.\nThe food was actually really good. We started with the fritto misto, fried calamari and veggies with this spicy sriracha aioli. This dish really had some kick to it. I then had the chowder which was meh, really need a lot of salt and it had an almost gluey taste. My bouillabaisse was tasty and the portion was generous, I couldn't even finish it, I had a bite of my friend's chicken and noodles and boy were those noodles good. Comfort food at it's best. Finished up with a boozy Jack Daniel's bread pudding. All in all a great little find. I will definitely keep this place in mind anytime I'm seeing a show at the Orpheum.", "author": "Cathy T."}

I cannot warn you strongly enough against dining here.\n\nWe made a reservation for a large party with 14 people, and we were put in a back room which was extremely cold. The service was extremely slow: our server would sometimes disappear for over 20 minutes, and the food was mediocre and not worth the price. \n\nOn top of being abandoned in a freezing room, my wife's debit card was double charged. After arguing back and forth with them for a week about it, they finally told us to talk to our bank about it. We filed a report with the bank, and the bank complained about the restaurant to us! Even though MSG could only produce one credit card slip for our bank, they *still* wouldn't take the charge off. Our only recourse was for our bank to declare FRAUD, which means that my wife had to get a new debit card with a different number and change that number everywhere she has bills on autopay.\n\nI'm shocked that this place is still in business.

We weren't sure what to expect, but felt welcomed by the cozy atmosphere and the wonderful wait staff (especially the charming Yolanda, who was attentive yet unobtrusive). \n     It took a while to decide what to have since everything on the menu sounded awesome (we especially appreciated the use of local produce), but nothing prepared us for being absolutely blown away by the amazing dishes. \n     I had the clam chowder, which was the best I've ever had (perfect balance of ingredients, great consistency, and almost sweet). The roasted beet salad made me swoon... the presentation was gorgeous, and the combination of the beets with the fromage blanc and caramelized nuts, along with the crisp \"green\" taste of the watercress... perfection. Then came the main course of short ribs. Who needed a knife?? The meat was so tender it melted in my mouth, and the sour cherry gastrique was the perfect compliment. And the wine-soaked cauliflower!! Amazing. I joked, \"Would it be rude if I licked my plate?\", but secretly I really wanted to!\n     I love food, and Chef Jones' is pure artistry.

But to watch the waiter's reaction to other diners who weren't availaing of wine to push up the check or had children in their company, one would think they were depriving him of his livlihood AND somehow lowering the tone. My impression before I booked this spot (I should have done better research!) was of a restauarant that served American classics in faded yet still plush surroundings...wrong on both counts. Pulling out your chair and placing your napkin for you does not high end make. Yet despite all of the foregoing, the place was crowded.

I'm already thinking i better eat good because i don't want to have to bring a container with leftovers in the theater. Well there was no need for any of that. The portion was so small. My friend and I were cracking up looking at my meal. I mean there was about 4 small spinach ravilois with a bit of lettuce on type (seems like to hide the portion). I was finished in a matter of 2 minutes. I mean thats great as a side for $5. But $16!!!!!! plus tip. Really huge rip off. I'm not quite sure on the portions of other meals on the menu.

As my family was treated like royalty and my kids rose to the occasion with their best party manners, I was able to enjoy my delicious food in embracing golden candle light.The whole evening was wonderful.  I wouldn't have changed a thing.

The seared ahi tuna was ice cold and obviously straight out of the refrigerator. The grilled salmon was OK.  My bread plate was dirty and had to be returned. The Thai tomatoe bisque soup tasted like pureed tomatoes straight out of the can. The clam chowder was OK. The seafood pasta that the manager insisted bringing to the table to make up for the very refrigerated (apparently after it was seared) ahi was bland, and loaded up with undercooked frozen shrimp and scallops. On the positive side, no-one got sick. The server and manager were both appropriately apologetic. They were apologizing to a lot more tables than ours!  They did not charge for the ahi. My companion and I had some doubts whether the Grey Goose Martinis really were Grey Goose. We made it to the Orpheum on time for the show.
