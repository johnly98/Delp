As a Persian, I love middle eastern food, and this Iraqi restaurant does not disappoint. We were easily able to get a table for 4 at 6:30 on a Sunday, although the place filled up around 7-7:30.\n\nI would recommend sharing some small plates and a main, as there are so many great items to choose from. \n\nStandouts from our visits include the mama ghanoush and the Kuzi. Both on the sweeter side. Also, thank you Jannah for bringing us so much bread- it's awesome. \n\nPrices are reasonable.

Also their portions are quite large and it's fairly easy to overorder fwiw. We got a three item mezze (hummus, baba ganoush, this pepper spread), this sort of lamb sausage pizza, a lamb shank in orka and tomato sauce, and their lamb dolma which is a lamb and rice mixture stuffed into a variety of vegetables (onion, chard, squash).\n\nAll were quite solid! The lamb shank was excellent and matched the sauce well. The various mezze all tasted kinda the same but in a good way. The pizza was interesting in that the dough kinda reminded me of cauliflower doughs that I've had. The dolma probably stole the show and I think we need to eat more mixtures of things stuffed into other things.", "author": "Misha T."}

Seriously one of those little San Francisco gems hiding under all of our noses, in plain sight where you least expect it.\n\nI'm really excited to go back and try more, even though a lot of the dinner options are a little above my typical price range. One of the nice things about this place is that there actually are a surprisingly wide price range of items. For $10 you can get a pizza that will easily stuff one person, or you can go up in the $20s for items that are a little fancier.\n\nI got 2x pizzas (one the falafel pizza, and the other the Urook pizza), and they were both spectacular. The Urook is a little more like traditional pizza with its sausage, onions, cheese, etc. but it is still clearly middle eastern in its flavors. Both are wonderful items unlike any typical pizza. This is one of my largest complaints with tikka masala pizza - in many places it's a lot like Italian/American pizza with just a slight difference. Here, there is no such confusion.\n\nThe servers are also extremely nice, and this place is clearly family owned and has been here a while. And they're FAST, so you can get an amazing meal on the go (especially if you use Allset like I did). I can't wait to go back!", "author": "Chris S."}

The atmosphere is nice, the murals are calm and inviting, and the service was so friendly. I came for lunch right when they opened on a Sunday and enjoyed some selections off their smaller lunch menu. \n\nWe started with the salmon kebab with fattoush salad, which was filled with delicious herbs, crunchy pita, lettuce, and spices. However, the portion was a little small and not particularly filling. We then had two of the phyllo dough entrees--the perdaplow was a dish of little dumplings filled with shredded chicken, rice, almonds, and golden raisins, surrounded by a sweet and tart apricot sauce with peas and chickpeas. The kuzi was a very similar dish, but with a filling of lamb instead. Both were fantastic, with bursts of flavor and crispy exteriors. \n\nNot feeling quite satisfied with just one salad, we then ordered an additional small plate salad--the Jannah salad, which consisted of cucumber, grilled eggplant, and grilled bell pepper. However, the salad was drenched in pomegranate molasses, which was unfortunately sickeningly sweet--it was hard to taste much else in the dish.\n\nOverall, not a bad place for a casual lunch, though I think the overall experience would probably be better for dinner. Many of the dishes we tried weren't bad, but others could have been improved.", "author": "David K."}

The portions are huge, the pricing is fair, and, most importantly, the food is absolutely delicious.\n\nWe ordered a Mezza plate and really enjoyed the different ganoushes that it came with. There was easily enough food to be an excellent appetizer for 3 or 4 people, even though it was just the two of us. And they didn't skimp on the pita bread like other places often do.\n\nWe also got the falafel pizza, which was also excellent. It was easily large enough to be an entire meal, and the flavors were spot on. I can't wait to dig in to the left over piece for breakfast.\n\nFinally, we also had one of the stuffed phylo dough dishes - the Kuzi. Holy cow this dish was good! The real star was the pomegranate-rosemary sauce. It was so sweet and tangy that I could imagine it as a dessert.\n\nAlso, we also had a glass of wine with dinner, and this place is incredibly generous with their pours.\n\nThe only downside to our evening at Jannah was that they were a little understaffed and we had to wait a bit for the server to come take our order and at the end of our meal to deliver our bill. But the food itself came out at a good pace and it did not feel like we were waiting forever for it to arrive.\n\nI will summarize by saying that we will absolutely be back. This would be a great place to come with friends to share a meal family-style, and I highly recommend it.", "author": "Andy W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-11", "description": "Jannah serves amazing Middle Eastern food in the middle of NoPa, San Francisco.  It's the perfect restaurant to highlight San Francisco's diverse culinary culture and it's abundant choices of Michelin starred restaurants.  The ingredients are fresh and the courses are made with devotion to their cultural background.  \n\nJannah was recommended by my Iraqi buddy who I like to call Iranian to get him fired up.  \n\nHis usually response, \"Dude there's a difference.  It's two completely different countries.\"  \nMe, \"Were they not both apart of the Persian empire at one time?\" \nHim, \"Yes, but it's different now.\"  \nMe, \"Tomato.  Toe-mato.  Same sh*t.\"  \n\nI wouldn't say it's ideal to make an ignorant joke to San Franciscans.  They're a little sensitive even though the city is filled with tech-bros.  Now, I'm not a racist, but I'm more of a troll who likes to push buttons.  Anyway, my buddy doesn't eat pork cause he's Muslim.  I always try to sneak in bits of pork into his food, but he somehow figures it out.  I believe in equality, so I do it to my Jewish friends too.  \n\nI was hesitate on going to Jannah because there is no pork on the menu.  I'm part Vietnamese and all we eat is pork.  I find it creepy when people don't eat pork.  Maybe the Jews and Muslims should start eating pork.  It'll probably bring peace in the Middle East.  Bacon saves lives.  \n\nJannah's service was fantastic.  It was true Middle Eastern service where they go the extra mile to accommodate your request and make you feel at ease.  It reminded me of the quality service I received when I visited the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey.  I would say Middle Eastern service is only best by Japanese service.  Solid hospitality at Jannah.\n\nNow, the food.  I went with the Tikka Kebabs with Hummus.  The chicken was definitely tasty and it was cooked perfectly to keep its moisture.  The sear marks with the tarragon marinate brought me back to the Middle East.  The beef kebabs came with the same sear marks, but it had a thyme marinate.  The thyme marinate gave the beef a barely noticeable mint flavor.  \n\nThe hummus was fantastic.  It was fresh and creamy; it wasn't bland or uninspiring.  It was the perfect dipping sauce for the kebab.  I asked my \"Iranian\" buddy who came up with hummus.  The Jews or the Muslims?  He had no idea.  I asked the same question in the Middle East. The Jews said they did. Muslims said it was them.  \n\nNow, I know the real reason Jews and Muslims don't get along. They both laid claim to hummus like Jerusalem. Forget searching for the fountain of youth.  Go find out who came up with hummus.\n\nLastly, Jannah is a great restaurant for some quality Iraqi food.  The service is superb; it's only best by the fresh ingredients in its dishes.  The brightly lit restaurant keeps the atmosphere upbeat.  I would definitely recommend Jannah to anyone looking for a comfortable dining experience.", "author": "Steve N."}

When Wafa realized that most at our table were from the fire zone-- many not knowing if their homes were still standing-- she brought over dessert after dessert, all free, to cheer everyone up a bit.  On our trips there afterward, she made a point of asking us if all were OK and had a home to return to, (they did.)\n\nLast week, we took two local foodies there who have eaten their way around the world and had not known of Janna.

We were not disappointed!\n\nWe ordered the falafel pizza and the grilled Japanese eggplant for our appetizers. Definitely my favorite falafel ever! So flavorful and not too heavy or greasy the way some fried falafels can be. The pomegranate sauce for the eggplant was heavenly. Even after all the eggplant was eaten, we kept dipping pita bread and our forks into the sauce. So good!\n\nFor entrees we ordered the lamb shank (option 3), the phyllo stuffed with chicken, and the vegetable dolma. All three were so delicious! The flavors were interesting and full, but nothing was too salty or heavy. The lamb shank was super tender and falling off the bone. The phyllo was crunchy with a sweet sauce that complemented the chicken stuffing. And the phyllo was not super greasy! The vegetable dolma was accompanied by a tasty yogurt sauce and the stuffed tomato in the middle really completed the dish.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the phyllo stuffed with cream accompanied by a raspberry pur\u00e9e and the semolina with milk and rose water, drizzled with chocolate and chopped pistachios. I really loved the phyllo. It was crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside. And the raspberry pur\u00e9e was plenty sweet to accompany the unsweetened phyllo and cream. Together they were just sweet enough without being overly so. Personally I did not love the semolina (I just thought it was okay), but my dad loved it. I will say that the amount of rose water was just perfect. Enough that it really stood out, but not enough that it came across as ridiculously perfumes.\n\nTl;dr: Highly recommend this restaurant!

Apparently once called Yaya, Jannah is a small, one chef owner  restaurant with a second chef who works there when the main man is not there. I love (really love) Middle Eastern Food and this restaurant is one of the most unique combinations of the flavors of the region in collaboration with hints of the Californian cuisine. Innovative, succulent, a little spice (maybe more if you ask ??), the menu is unique and not fussy.\n\n\nI had a the lentil soup with sumac which was thick, satisfying, comfort food just like lentil soup should be. Then came the Safeehat Falafel which was like a Middle Eastern pizza. It was a perfect crust made of garbanzo beans covered with a thin wash of pesto, followed by eggplant, roasted bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, tomato and topped with feta (not super salty thankfully) and goat cheese. Vegetarian heaven. It's a generous dish and two people could easily make it a center of a meal, with one of their wonderful sounding salads, a dip, coffee, wine, desert...omg...I have to go back.\n\nAs I savored the Safeehat Falafel, I read the menu. Crazy, right? Incredibly delicious  sounding salads, really interesting dips and other main courses to try alone and with friends. \n\nAnother plus: a nice selection of wines by the bottle and by the glass.\n\n\nThe prices are way reasonable and the food is outstanding. It looks like a very comfortable place to have a gathering of good friends and family for celebrations, or for no reason at all. \n\nThis is a hidden gem and it's the real deal. \n\nI think i'm moving in.\n\nurl: http://www.yayacuisine.com/menu.htm", "author": "yelper y."}

I don't quite get the concept. Will work better with mom and pop feeling I think.\n\nFood: I ordered Kuzi, which was suggested by the waiter as the more exotic selection. I'm an adventurous eater, so of course I ordered it. Kuzi is a big round phyllo dough with rice + raisin + lamb + almond inside. The phyllo dough is crispy and nice but the sauce that it came with is way too tangy, but if I don't use the sauce, it'd be kinda flavorless.\n\nI just pretend that the waiter selection was good, but it was actually kinda hard to eat :(", "author": "Novalina N."}

Chef Yahya Salih creates dishes that are inspired by his mother's cooking of food that is specific to the city of Mosul to the north of Baghdad and at the same time influenced by his many years of cooking California cuisine.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and has seating area in the back that consist of benches with throw rugs and pillows where you feel that you are in the Middle East. There is a full bar with a great selection of wines and beers. If you are tired of the old typical Middle Eastern food of falafel and gyros, you will for sure be taking a different journey into a side of Middle Eastern food that not too many restaurants dare to venture into. The Safeehat Falafel is unbelievable and all the dishes made with phyllo dough have that crispiness of the flaky phyllo which wraps the perfectly spiced rice and meats. These dishes are served with different sauces that are perfect compliments to the combination of phyllo, rice and meats. I make sure that whenever I am in San Francisco for business or pleasure and with whomever I am with, I have to have at least one meal at Jannah.", "author": "C B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-12-03", "description": "From other reviews, it looks like some of their dishes are pretty solid. Our company got lunch catering from here, which only included the pizza. So if you're interested in getting other things here, this review doesn't apply.\n\nAs for the pizza, I tried the Safeehat Urook (vegetarian) and the Safeehat Falafel. The first was similar to what you'd expect when you think pizza: a thick and hearty crust, cheese, and vegetable toppings. Even though it looked like pizza, it didn't really taste like pizza. That's not to say it was bad, it was just unexpected. I'd give it around 3.5 stars. The second was way different, the crust was made out of the same mixture used in falafels and it was topped with more middle-eastern vegetables and some feta cheese. This one tasted nothing like pizza, even though it looked (somewhat) like it.\n\nFor both of these, I'd say the individual components tasted fine but the way they were put together was kind of questionable. I'd give this place another shot if I was nearby, but I'd certainly not get the pizza. I've been looking for a solid falafel place, and I haven't found any yet in SF.\n\nOne more thing - a lot of people at work were rather surprised with the meat \"pizzas\", which didn't have any cheese. There was some complaint that they were poorly named, as the end result was very different from what they were expecting.", "author": "Amaresh S."}

Very nice ambiance as well, I think it'd be a nice date spot. Strictly on food, I might give it a 4.5 stars (I round down as my convention), but for large groups, this was a fabulous spot.\n\nI made a reservation for 12 people two days in advance. We were able to expand that up to 16 the morning of. Waffa (sp?) was my point of contact and made sure I knew how things were going down. We got a fixed price meal for $25 a head, not counting tip, gratuity, or alcohol. Alcohol was also very reasonable at $5 a glass for wine, so that was flowing pretty smoothly.\n\nThere is no Healthy SF surcharge and they actually do not have an automatic gratuity for large parties. I asked Waffa to put 18% on the final bill just to simplify things and to make sure no one stiffed them on tip.\n\nGiven the prices we were quoted, I was pretty surprised at how nice the venue is. Cute, clean spot. Besides us, it wasn't too packed (I'd say around 75% capacity, with us taking up roughly a third of the available floor space). I was never bothered by any crowd noise, although the other patrons around our table might have disagreed. I think on a typical night, it'd be a quiet, nice place to eat with a special someone without dropping a ton of money.\n\nOnce most of our party was seated, they brought out  the first course: flattened falafel (almost like a pizza), burnt eggplant in pomegranate sauce, a mixed hummus plate, pitas, and a sweet ravioli-like plate. Second course came in: roasted chicken, mint salad with salmon, phyllo-wrapped chicken in apricot sauce, and phyllo-wrapped lamb and rice in pomegranate sauce. I wasn't a fan of everything, but I LOVED a lot of it (the eggplant, the falafel, and the phyllo dishes were my favorite). We had something for everyone and came away with a LOT of food. Very, very reasonable.\n\nThey also brought out a cake we had bought earlier after they cleared the table and charged no additional cake fee.\n\nThey also were very accommodating when it came time to pay. We ended up paying with a wad of cash and 8 different cards, and they were more than happy to deal with all of it.\n\nAll in all, great experience. Very reasonable prices, great food, great service, and nice atmosphere.

One of our party scored serious points with his girlfriend by bringing her some of the eggplant. The eggplant stuffed with lamb was excellent and the Yaha's Dolmas were fantastic. The Muhamara dip went great with the pita and fresh Iraqi bread. The Kuzi (phyllo dough filled with lamb, rice, almonds, raisins and spices) was also great.\n\nThe people, the food, the relaxed feel of Jannah makes it a place I will continue to tell all my friends about, foodies or not.

After exchanging emails with the owner, I asked that they please put me down for a reservation and I said that I would confirm closer to the day. This was about a month and a half ago. Two weeks before my event, I emailed them to say that I needed to cancel my reservation. To which I received this response:\n\n\"but you have made a  formal reservation, and I did not take any reservation for that night\nand now you are telling me you are now \ndo you think is that fair\"\n\nApart from the poor grammar and lack of punctuation, I was astounded to see such an unprofessional email. First off, I told them that I would confirm the reservation later and they had never told me when they needed to know by. Second, I have talked to over a dozen restaurants and they have all told me that reservations needed to be cancelled within 48-72 hours, which is fair. Having given Jannah TWO WEEKS NOTICE, and still receiving an email like this is completely ridiculous. Not to mention that if they do not think they can fill their restaurant within two weeks they have other problems to deal with.\n\nSo consider this a warning for anyone thinking about planning an event here.

Mr. Yahya Salih himself, and his team, were there to greet us when we arrived.  In fact, Mr. Salih cooked for us. The food was plentiful, super delicious and everyone was sooo hospitable.  We truly felt like we were their guests - not just customers.  And, in case your are wondering - no one in our party knows these folks.  We were not special - or related.  The hummus and baba ganoush were deliciously homemade - the hummus was sprinkled with za'atar and a little olive oil.  And the Kuzi... OMG - it was amazing.  This is shredded cooked lamb mixed with rice, spices, fruit and nuts which is then encased in phyllo dough and baked. Then it is served with a sauce that i think is made with pomegranate molasses.  It was so good.  I think this alone would be worth a visit.    Of course there was pita bread, middle eastern salad, stuffed grape leaves and both grilled salmon and chicken kabobs.  We were also treated to real rice pilaf and a sauce made from caramelized onions, eggplant, roasted red peppers, garlic and other spices. I guess you could think of this as a Persian ratatouille.  In short - this is authentic Persian home cooking. Mr. Salih is a restaurant luminary in SF and his restaurant is worthy of our patronage.  And - as an extra bonus - the prices are actually reasonable.  Mesopotamian cuisine is among the oldest in the world dating back some 10,000 years.  Once you eat here, you will see why we continue to enjoy it to this day.  Do your self a favor and just go there.  The restrooms accommodate 2 people each and there are no steps.  All is very clean.  The restaurant appears small - but they can actually accommodate close to 130 people +/-,  including the heated patio.  There is on-street parking which did not seem too challenging when we were there.  This place is good for groups and special for celebrations.  These folks do not skimp on the food and repeatedly urged us to enjoy more and more - not matter how much we ate. 2 people in our group had some dietary issues.  They were accommodated with not even a quiet murmur of inconvenience. This is restaurant hospitality the way it should be.  The fact that it is complimented by really good food is priceless.  Enjoy!", "author": "Barbara B."}

Sunday afternoon we walked in, and the place was nearly empty.  We were given extra attention this afternoon.  The chef came out to explain which aspects of the food were middle eastern, and which aspects of the food were \"California cuisine,\" as developed when he was working with Jeremiah Tower.  \n\nLet's have a look at it.  The menu items are spelled phonetically, so it helps if you read them out loud.  You will recognize some of them, like the chicken tikka that I ordered.  It featured thick pieces of chicken breast with a very nice touch of  something like tarragon.  It was complemented with a cucumber salad, hummus, tabouleh, pickled vegetables, and lavash.  \n\nThen there were the dolmas, \"the way Mom used to make them.\"  Well, not my Mom, but my Hot Russian Girl said she recognized them.  Besides the actual dolmas, there were stuffed zucchini, stuffed squash, and a stuffed onion, with lamb being the most outstanding ingredient of the stuffing.  This was all laid out over a sauce that looked at first like a brown sauce, but that turned out to be pomegranate.  \n\nDid I mention the wine?  For about $3 each, we chose a glass of chardonnay and a glass of pinot grigio to balance the entertaining foods that we were discovering.  \n\nMy Lady chose Kahi for dessert.  Imagine two 6-inch triangular crepes filled with whipped cream and a hint of cardamon.  We had coffee and tea to go along with that, and to cut the effect of the wine we had with our entrees.  \n\nSo, all this must cost a fortune, right?  Not really.  $36.15 + tip was all that this cost, and you can bet we'll be back for more!  \"Jannah\" means \"heaven,\" and I believe the name is appropriate.  \n\nWelcome to the neighborhood!", "author": "David D."}

Probably the main reason is the slightly kitchy appearance of the place from outside -- it seems to be an overly-brightly lit restaurant dominated by a Vegas-style painted seascape on the main wall. Seems to rule out an intimate dining experience... (In addition, truthfully, I'm not a great fan of Middle-Eastern cuisine, so I wasnt drawn in by the food.)\n\nFast-forward to last Friday evening -- it was late, and my friend & I were out of ideas for food choices (and most of the more reliable destinations were completely full.) We decided to try Jannah as a slightly desparate fallback choice.\n\nWhen we entered, the place was bustling and active, though not completely full. It took a little while for us to get seated. (There seemed to be some sort of re-configuration of the dining tables involved...) But - after that, we received very attentive, very friendly service. There was a real, genuine sense that they were happy and grateful to have us in their restaurant, and we were warmly welcomed on our first visit. A pleasant surprise for a fairly jaded cynic such as myself. In addition (fortunately) the ambiance was much mellower and less cheezy than appeared from outside.\n\nThe waiter explained the fairly bewildering menu, and we opted for some fairly non-controversial choices -- as appetizer, Safeehat Falafel, a sort of falafel pizza, and a  single entree, the Chicken Tikka Kabob. Both dishes were enormous. The Chicken dish was a hearty combination of salad and large hunks of grilled chicken. The single entree was more than enough for both of us, and the place was very reasonably priced. A very good, reliable choice. I'll be back to try some of the more intriguing choices.", "author": "donal c."}

I decided to join them, not knowing anything about where we would be dining.  This was my first Middle Eastern dining experience and I was pleasantly surprised by Jannah's offerings.\n\nOur group ordered a few of the dips - each were $3 which seemed very reasonable.  We got hummus, MamaGanoush (sp?) and a turnip puree... all were yummy.  We also ordered the vegetarian falafel pizza for an appetizer.  It was all good food to share and went well with the $3/glass wine.  You can't beat that price!\n\nMost of us ordered phyllo dough entrees - mainly the Sambosak.  Another vegetarian dish.  Also ordered were some chicken and beef kebabs and the vegetarian ratatouille.  Everyone really enjoyed their food though there was one slight mixup with the ratatouille dish... the waitress brought out something that just didn't seem right, my friend called it out and they immediately swapped the dish with the correct item.  We have no idea what it was that she was given originally but they were quick to correct their mistake.  \n\nSome people have mentioned lighting in their reviews.  It did seem bright when we first got there, but they seemed to have dimmed the lights a bit as the evening progressed.  They also turned up the heat a bit as a couple of people at our group mentioned it was too cold at the table.  The servers were very attentive and my drink was never low.  Always a good sign!\n\nThe food was delicious, the price was good - I would probably go back and try some new things again.  This may have also opened the door for me for middle eastern cuisine.\n\nOh and the website seems to be for their old location, however it looked like it had most of the items that were from this new site.  If you search it online it should list the San Francisco address in connection with the webpage.", "author": "Christine N."}

In what is now a large, sparsely decorated room with too-bright lights and too much noise, long-time Bay Area chef de cuisine Ya Ya is in the process of creating a peaceful coastal garden setting that will transport diners from the gritty Western Addition to somewhere along the Mediterranean seaside.\n\nNo stranger to the SF food scene, Ya Ya is once again putting out some amazing dishes.  Standout appetizers include safeehat falafel (a delicious Mediterranean \"pizza\" with a crispy garbanzo bean crust topped with goat cheese, tomato, onion, pesto, and eggplant), delicate and tasty barbecued quail on hummus, and jannah (pickled vegetables), as well as old standbys like baba ganoush (roasted eggplant mashed and mixed with various seasonings).\n\nEntrees also do not disappoint.  The housemade Swiss chard dolmas are unlike any others you've ever tried -- tender, sweet, slightly citrusy, and just plain good.  The hands-down favorite was fesanjoon (chicken marinated in pomegranate molasses), which sounds odd, but is truly to-die-for.\n\nService was friendly and attentive.  Water and wine glasses were never empty, and dishes arrived promptly.  There are some great beers on tap, including the local IPA from 21st Amendment, and the wine list, while short, was very reasonably priced.\n\nWhile Ya Ya's work in process is not yet finished, don't wait; run to Jannah today for some authentic, delicious Mediterranean food.", "author": "CJ G."}

Something unique and when you step inside, it IS different . Dim lighting, a painted sky, pillowy seating area near a wall that projected a cultural music video, a bar, and hookah is the back patio! \n\n- Bread with some type of olive oil infused dip with spices. Delish! I couldn't stop eating this and even had seconds. \n\n- Tikka Kabob ($9): Your choice of meat (lamb, chicken, beef, or salmon) and sides (3 different options). I got the chicken (marinated in tarragon) with the side that included rice w/vermicelli, fresh vegetables, and eggplant ratatouille caramelized onion, red bell pepper in tomato sauce. I remember that the sauce didn't taste quite right and there was something bitter to it. Other than the sauce, the flavor in the meat was delish and I loved all the vegetables.  \n\n- Salmon marinated in dill and the side that included hummus, tabouleh, onions with sumac, pickles, tomato, salata, and  lavash bread. I'm not much of a fan of dill, but the salmon was moist and the hummus was great. \n\nService was efficient and quick, not crowded during dinner time when we went on a weekend. I remember  we inquired about hookah and the nice lady (owner?) did not hesitate to give us a tour of the patio and mentioned that they have various hours and we were welcome to partake after dinner if we wanted to. One thing that was pretty annoying was the lights in the restaurant kept on flickering here and there throughout our meal, but I still enjoyed the food and atmosphere.", "author": "Tracy T."}

For overall price, service, location and most importantly quality of food, I would recommend Jannah to anyone looking for a delicious meal for lunch or dinner. If you were one of the lucky (or smart) folks who jumped on that Groupon deal, you'll be happy you did. \n\nWe ordered hummus and the Safeehat Falafel to start. The hummus was a work of art in itself with something red sprinkled on top (cayenne pepper, perhaps?) and beets placed on the side. The pita bread was the softest I've ever had. The Safeehat Falafel was so delicious that I wanted to just order two more of them instead of an entree. After all, at $5 a plate why wouldn't you go nuts with their little pizzas? Delicious flavor and packed with lots of veggies and feta cheese. For the main course we shared the Dolmas which is stuffed eggplant wrapped in Swiss chard. Stuffed with what? Who cares, it was awesome. But it was swimming in a plate of delicious tamarind sauce that you can't help sopping up with the rest of the pita bread. The presentation of each dish was beautiful and appetizing. \n\nService was great and though I'm not sure if that was because we got there before the dinner rush (around 6:00 on a Thursday) we still had the nicest and most considerate waiter who came around frequently to make sure we were satisfied with the food. \n\nIf you're STILL unsure of whether or not to give Jannah a chance, let me end with this: I stuffed myself with an extra basket of pita bread just to get every last bit of that hummus and tamarind sauce.

The Middle Eastern food here is excellent, the restaurant is lovely, and the service is fun and friendly. I needed an affordable, delicious place for a graduation dinner for 50 people from SF State, and this place really, really delivered. \n\nBefore I found Jannah, I checked out dozens of places around the city. I'm a big foodie, and I also like to host a good event, so I took this task pretty seriously.  It was very difficult to find places willing to accommodate a group of 50 without renting out the restaurant, which we could not afford. The few places I found in our price range ($25-35 per person) had mixed reviews for big group reservations, or were in Chinatown (difficult driving and parking from Daly City area on a Friday evening). I visited several restaurants to talk to the owners in person, and as soon as I met Yahya and his wife, who run the restaurant, I knew this was a great place. They had several microbrews on tap, plus wines by the glass for only $5. We talked about options for hosting our large group, and I asked tons of nit-picky questions about their Middle Eastern (Iraqi) dishes. We made an agreement for a 3-course, family style meal for an excellent per person price (around $30 per person, before tax, tip, and alcohol). And this restaurant offers free parking at the lucky store across the street until 10 pm. Awesome. \n\nOn the evening of the dinner, our boisterous group of 50 arrived at the restaurant. The restaurant has a great long wooden bar, nice for hanging out. The chef was ready with mezze dishes right away- tabouleh, baba ganoush, a falafel pizza-type dish, sweet ravioli dish, roasted eggplant- and the servers just kept bringing out food. The chef then sent out dishes of phyllo dough wrapped around rice, lamb and apricots, and another with phyllo around rice, chicken, and pomograte. After every course, the staff kept telling us, \"Now save some room, there's lots more coming out!\" which was funny and so true. The main courses were large family-style plates of mixed greens with hearty portions of grilled salmon, chicken and beef on top. All of the dishes were great, and some were really excellent, like the phyllo, lamb and rice dish. The waitstaff did a great job keeping up with drink orders and even squeezing in my professor who showed up late. The chef/ owner was willing to accommodate one guest's nut allergy, and also made a great phyllo vegetarian entree for our veggie friends. Even when the guests started to get pretty rambunctious after a few drinks, the owners treated us kindly. \n\nThis restaurant is fantastic for large groups. The food was so tasty, parking was easy, and the owners were honest, kind, and great to do business with. I will definitely be back to Jannah again.

On this unassuming stretch in NOPA, blue skies (well, the walls are painted that way), flavorful falafel and mesquite grilled kebabs await. \n\nStart with a few dips -- the hummas* and  baba ghanooge are well spiced -- and so is the mama ghanooge, which is a sauce consisting of carrots and tamarind. \n \nLamb goes with this sort of cuisines like cereal does to milk, and the Yuzi is a perfect example.

The food was excellent, the portions were enormous, the service was fantastic and friendly, the ambiance was appropriate, the wine list was good and and overall the restaurant and the wine were extremely affordable, especially when considering the great overall quality of the food and service. Best of all there was no trouble getting a table without a reservation on a Saturday night at 8 o'clock.  Surely, once word gets out that there is tasty new kid on the block serving high quality food at a bargain, the crowds will follow.\n\nLocated on an uninspiring section of Fulton street, across from the modern Albertsons/ Condo complex, the decor inside is warm, simple and open, and the tables are quite spread out-a rarity in San Francisco.  Due to its spaciousness, there was no bumping elbows with the table next to us or having to worry that others could be listening in on the details of our private conversation.  On the far back wall, there was a large movie screen, quietly spilling out tasteful and culturally relevant music videos from the eastern Mediterranean, easing the transition to the Middle-East and helping to warm our palates for the tasty Mediterranean feast that followed. \n\nWe tried the mini falafel pizza as an appetizer. It was an unusual twist on a familiar treat and perfect for sharing between two to three people.  Another anomaly for SF was the very affordable wine list.  We didn't  order a bottle of wine but thought that the Summer Estates wine by the glass was a bargain at 4 bucks a glass! It's nice to find a restaurant that doesn't overcharge for a descent glass of wine!\n\nIt was challenging to choose only two entrees from the array of tasty options, but our friendly waiter, David, was extremely helpful and successfully navigated us through the large menu.  I ordered a delicious filo stuffed pie dish that was stuffed with beef, raisins, cinnamon and spices, served with a tasty yogurt sauce.  It was yummy: both savory and lightly sweet.  My friend ordered a huge platter of skewered chicken, accompanied by an assortment of typical Mediterranean side dishes, like creamy hummus and fresh tabbouleh. The skewered chicken pieces were titanic, extremely moist and bursting with flavor.  Although I didn't order it,  I was also tempted by the lamb stuffed eggplant ordered by the couple at a nearby table. It was covered in a tomato based sauce, and it looked and smelled delicious.  Amazingly, all the entrees were only $13 and gigantic! \n\nBe warned, you might consider ordering just one entree to split between two people, along with a couple appetizers, or avoiding the appetizers altogether, since the portions were so large.  This would be a great restaurant to come to with a large group or extended family, due to the portion sizes, and affordability - No busted budgets here for a night out with friends or family!

I have to say the food was pretty good. The falafel pizza was defiantly different, but in a yummy way. They used the chickpea filler as the crust, and then put veggies and a bit of cheese on top. It was so interesting I had to eat the entire thing. Their hummus was ok, the grape leaves were good, but I didn't care for the lentil soup. \n\nTheir salmon was wonderful and it really stood out to me; it had a wonderfully smokey flavor to it and came very well cooked. I was really impressed at how well it was cooked, it's texture and taste. \n\nWhat I couldn't figure out is why this place was totally empty. It's a HUGE place by SF standards, and the cooks obviously knows what they are doing. All I can figure is that it's staffed by young kids (maybe SF college kids?) who didn't appear to have a lot of serving experience and didn't really fit the vibe of this place. I mean when I walked in I literally didn't see anyone for almost 5 minutes as I sat at the empty bar and waited for someone, anyone, to come out to help me. But when the kid did come out, he did help me before vanishing again for another 5 minutes in the back until he reappeared with my food. \n\nIn a service oriented city like SF, I think if this place had better service this place would explode.

Well, the owner (Ya Ya himself) is the force behind Jannah, a surprisingly inspired middle eastern restaurant near the corner of Fulton and Masonic.\n\nI've given Jannah a pass for almost a year, assuming it was yet another unremarkable hummus-and-felafel outlet. That was a mistake - the menu is actually a real treat with plenty of unusual and interesting choices.\n\nWe were utterly delighted with the dips: a turnip spread, a carrot and cardamom dip, and classic mouhamarra. The zaatar is made with fresh thyme and toasted sesame seeds: perfect. We were very happy with the Makloob entree: roasted vegetables atop pilaf surrounded by an interesting and subtle herbal puree. LOVED the date-filled raviolis with walnut/yogurt topping. \n\nEating vegetarian off this menu was great; meat-eaters will not be disappointed either. You could easily (and blissfully) drown yourself in appetizer choices long before getting to entrees. In any case you are certainly not going to go broke eating here.\n\nIf there was one area of weakness it was that the breads didn't excite. I am a big fan of the ekmek and simit at A La Turka, especially when it comes hot out of the oven. By contrast, the bread here could easily have been packaged from the store. Alas, it's a small quibble in comparison to the great food.\n\nWe'll definitely be back!", "author": "Michael H."}

The falafel makes up the \"bread\" of the pizza; it's basically one big thin falafel. It's topped with a thin layer of diced vegetables - tomatoes, peppers, onions, and eggplant, as well as pesto and some very tasty feta. \n\nFor my entree I ordered the Maskoof; a \"slightly smoked\" trout. I love smoked fish in general (it's the jew in me - bring on the bagels with lox!) so I couldn't resist. It was a huge plate of fish, rice, and some kind of rich vegetable sauce.\n\nThe trout was good, but my friend did a better job ordering. He ordered lamb in phyllo dough with pomegranate sauce, which looked decadent. I don't eat lamb, but I tried the sauce with some of the tasty house bread and it was great. I need to go back to try one of the other phyllo dough entrees.", "author": "Adam B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-11-22", "description": "I wanted to like this place.  I even picked it out for a friend's birthday.  But there were just too many things that went wrong for me to warrant recommending this restaurant when there are so many other good Middle Eastern spots to eat at in the city.\n\nFood: 3 stars\nEdible, but forgetable.  The appetizers were good, and I really did like the unique falafel pizza.  But the entrees were definitely hit or miss with our large party.\n\nMy chicken with walnuts and pomegranate sauce was a bit too sweet, the vegetables it came with were on the bland side, and it didn't look that appetizing in general.  I ate it all, and it wasn't a bad tasting dish.  But it was completely underwhelming and definitely didn't do anything to make me want to come back.\n\nA lot of my friends got the scallop dish.  I think there was a 25/75 like-to-dislike ratio here.  Of the like side, they enjoyed the presentation and that the scallops were cooked well (not overdone).  Of the dislike side, they disliked the consistency of the sauce (compared it to Southern-style gravy... like biscuits and gravy), said the scallops were not that flavorful, and the different sweet/savory flavors did not mesh well together.  This dish was inconsistent among those who got it too, as some had a lot of small scallops, some had really large scallops, and some had a mixture of small and large.  One of the dishes was plated extremely poorly compared to the others as the rice looked plopped on instead of the nice cylinder shape like the others.\n\nService: 1 star\nThis is where Jannah takes the biggest hit.  And it's not that the service was rude... just that it the servers were very inexperienced and just got so many things wrong for what was supposed to be a special birthday dinner.\n\nOnce our large party arrived, we were not given menus and then immediately asked what we wanted to drink and order.  It was a forgiveable oversight, but the mistakes didn't stop here.  Once we were given the menus, it took a while for them to get back with us to take the order.\n\nOur group ordered appetizers for each half of the long table.  One of the eggplant dishes was given to the wrong side and that side inadvertantly ate it leaving the other table side to wonder where there dish went.  Yes, it was partially the fault of the people who ate an appetizer that they did not order.  But with that big a crowd, there are many appetizers ordered and it's a bit expected that the food you ordered would at least be presented to the correct side.\n\nOf course hummus and babganoush were ordered for appetizers, but very, very little pita bread was given out.  And multiple requests for more bread (either pita or the complimentary bread) was ignored.  We ended up eating most of the hummus and babaganoush with a spoon because our bread requests were ignored.\n\nTwo of my friends beer orders were brought out incorrectly.  But they kindly corrected that without fuss.  Still, another sign of inexperience.\n\nWhen the entrees did come out, they were called out by their menu name leaving everyone to scratch their head as to what it actually was.  It would've been so much simpler just to call out their English descriptions like \"scallops,\" \"chicken kabob,\" \"shrimp in phyllo,\" \"lamb,\" etc.\n\nOur water glasses were never refilled throughout the night and no one ever checked up on us throughout the dinner to see if we needed anything (bread!).\n\nIt was not a busy night at all and we were the only large party seated, so I don't understand why the service was so abysmal.\n\nPrice: 5 stars\nThis place will not break your budget at all.  And even splitting the birthday girl's meal and getting appetizers & drinks, the tab (with tip) came out to $25/person.\n\nThe entrees are $13 a person, appetizers $4-6, and wine is incredibly under-priced ($3 glasses, ~$20 bottles).\n\nOverall: 2 stars\n+1 extra star for the free baklava dessert they gave my friend with a candle (though unfortunately it wasn't as good as other places I've been to) and for the very friendly owner coming out to greet us when we left.\n\nI really wanted to like Jannah as I mentioned in the beginning, but unless they get a more trained and experienced waitstaff to improve their service, I don't forsee myself making a return trip.", "author": "Mercutio k."}

When Jannah moved into the 1700 block of Fulton, which has seen a lot of businesses come and go in the last 10 years, I thought, 'eh, another generic Middle Eastern restaurant.' But finally a Groupon persuaded me to give it a try.\n\nWow!!! The chef here is the well reviewed Yaya who used to cook at an Iraqi restaurant (Yaya) on Van Ness. He is a charming man and great at what he does. Not only does he offer dishes outside the usual repertoire (hummus, baba ghanoush) served at Middle Eastern restaurants in the United States, he puts his own creative, gourmet spin on things.\n\nJannah is a bit of a vegetarians' paradise. While there is plenty of meat on offer, there were so many veg choices that we will have to return in order to try them all. Dishes are also healthy and reasonably priced.\n\nEverything we had left me with happy food memories:\n* Yudhud ghanooge  (turnip with date syrup) The slight tang of turnip contrasted well with the date, which was not overly sweet. My fave!\n* Mama ghanooge  (carrot with tamarind) Very unusual flavor. Delicious. \n* Muhamara  (roasted red bell pepper, cumin, and walnuts) A good rendition of this regional favorite that isn't served enough here.\n* Kelecha: (Iraqi snack converted to ravioli) stuffed with dates cardamom, cinnamon and topped with yogurt, walnuts and parmesan cheese. Interesting and yummy!\n* Vegetarian Makloob: eggplant, mushroom, squash, cauliflower, onions served atop rice and served with a sauce made of pureed herbs and spinach. Fan-freakin'-tastic!!!\n\nJannah also greets you with an excellent za'atar (thyme/sesame/sumac dip) and bread.\n\nI am already plotting return visits, friends in tow.\n\nBTW, I just read others' reviews about poor ambiance and service. I guess Jannah has fixed these problems because I found the ambiance a bit upscale and very comfortable and the service attentive and very nice.", "author": "Erica G."}

Of course it could have been the great company! \n\nFirst, the flavors are different than most middle eastern (ME) places that I've gotten used to.  This is Iraqi ME food and there are some specialties and interpretations that are different than the Western ME foods.  I truly tasted ME foods that felt like the missing evolution between Levantine and Iranian (Persian) cuisine. Some of the Persian sweet and sour and some American fusion thrown in. Try the Perdaplow, Kuzi or Beriani Phyllo dough dishes.\n\nSecond, the wine list is very reasonably priced.  I like it when I can afford everything on a wine list and I don't feel I'm being charged more than triple for an average bottle I can get at the grocery store.  The Bekkaa valley Lebanese wine with the French name was excellent! (Funny, I was in the Bekkaa valley in 2000 and real alcohol was not sold blatantly, but non-alcoholic beer was available at some restaurants.)\n\nI did not get to try what I've heard is the most famous dish of Iraq: Masg\u00fbf. Masg\u00fbf is a fish dish usually cooked in or over a fire for an hour or more adding complex smoky flavors.  I would like to go back to try this because I really liked the flavor of the smoky salmon kebabs we ate that night.\n\nThe place was not full.  The staff was attentive and accommodating.  We ate better than desert sheikhs. It might not be what you're used to in terms of the flavors, but this restaurant deserves your attention and support.

Seriously, how often do you look at a menu and think to yourself, there is not a single thing that does not look divine!?\n\nPS-- While prices are still reasonable for dinner, ($14) the lunch menu is a steal at only ($9!!)", "author": "Shahirah I."}

I have a persian roommate so of course he was excited when this place opened so close. He said it was just \"decent\"  but very cheap so a friend and I decided to go.  Well he was right, the food WAS cheap - esp the drinks.  The glass of wine I had was $3 but it actually tasted like $3 dollar wine so that sucked.  It was very vinegary for some odd reason.  The humus was great but they kind of skimp on the pita and you have to ask for more.  The kebob dishes were pretty tasty, i LOVED the eggplant thing it came with.  The place was missing the yogurt cucumber sauce that I love, but then again maybe my knowledge of middle eastern food is lacking and that is only offered at certain places?  \n\nThe ambiance of this place was super odd to me too.  You know when  you were little and you wanted to play restaurant?  I felt like thats what it was, a bunch of kids playing restaurant but not necessarily in a bad way.", "author": "Tiffany L."}

For appetizers we tried the carrot and the turnip dips, really smooth and tasty. The carrot had a smokiness that was a nice surprise. We also tried one of the pizzas, a falafal crust with veggies and goat cheese on top - terrific. I had the lamb dolma entree, the rolls weren't just stuffed grape leaves, there were also stuffed sections of yellow squash, eggplant and onion, the filling was meaty and well spiced and served warm with a really nice sauce. My husband had 3 phyllo wrapped triangles filled with spinach and other vegetables, it was very nice as well. \n\nPrices were good, not cheap but worth the quality of food and service.

No obnoxious wait at 6:45 on a Saturday night.\n\nThe Mahamara dip is a definite must - red bell peppers, cumin and walnuts . . it was so good.  We also got:\n\n -  perdaplow (phyllo dough with shredded chicken, rice, and almonds in an apricot sauce).  This was probably my favorite of the three entrees.  It comes out as a huge round block of phyllo dough swimming in the apricot sauce.  It sort of seemed like it needed some salad or rice on the side, although it does have rice in the filling.\n\n - fesenjoon (chicken marinated with pomegranate molasses).  This was also good, sort of sweet, and served on a bed of rice and crunchy vegetables, which was a light and refreshing.\n\n - sheik something or other (eggplant stuffed with lamb and other stuff).  I can't really review this dish well because I'm not a huge fan of lamb.  And this lamb seemed pretty lamb-y.   \n\nAmbiance was acceptable.

We had a lamb pizza appetizer, a chicken/beef tikka kabob entree, a phyllo dough entree filled with lamb and two beers.  The lamb pizza was a thin crust pizza with ground lamb on top.  It was pretty good.  The kabobs were good as well.  I thought the beef was well seasoned and liked that better than the chicken.  The chicken was kind of bland to me, but it was moist and cooked well.  Just not too flavorful.  Rating them against other kabobs, I'd say that they are decent, nothing special though.  You had the option of getting rice or bread with the kabobs. I went with the bread and it came on the side.  The kebabs on the plate were sitting on thin layer of hummus and were surrounded by 6 different sides (cauliflower, pickles, salad, etc.).  The key to note here was that there was no \"bad\" parts on the kebabs... as in no fat or anything you cut off and put to the side.  The entire thing was just good meat.  My friend enjoyed the phyllo lamb as well.  It was a pretty gamey for lamb, but that's a personal preference. The phyllo dough was sitting on a lot of what I think was mango sauce which wasn't my style, but my friend was scooping it all up so I'll drum that up to preference as well.\n\nThe servers and staff were all nice.  They did make a couple of errors like bringing out the appetizer after we got our entrees and bringing the wrong phyllo dough entree (we ordered the chicken and got the lamb instead... yes, we could have sent it back but it was good so we kept it).  It wasn't a big deal when you realize that everything we ordered came out to $33.  That's pretty cheap for a full dinner for two!  As for the decor, it is much nicer than a place that has $11 entrees (every entree is $11).  If I just based the rating on the food, I'd give it 3 stars, but when you factor in the price and atmosphere, it goes up to 4.  I hope this place sticks around.

Don't host an event here; they cannot manage big parties.    \n\nWe attended an event here over the weekend.  The event was reservation-only.  It was full-house for the restaurant.  And there were only 3 wait staff.  We sat for 30 min before our drink orders were taken, and well over two HOURS before our entrees were served.  It was obvious that the restaurant was ill prepared for the crowd.  They gave a table of 2 the same sized appetizer tray as for our table of 10.  And the wait staff was told to ration the falafels, so that each guest can only have 1 piece.  We paid $25 per person (which doesn't include drinks) and didn't have enough to eat!\n\nWhen we talked to the manager later about the long wait time and not having enough food, and the inequity between a larger table vs. a smaller table when everyone paid the same price, the manager of the restaurant rudely and brusquely dismissed everything, after loudly demanding in our faces \"what do you mean not enough food?!!\"   \n\nOh, it gets better.  \n\nIf the manager had actually shown that she cared about service and client experience that evening, I wouldn't have rated the restaurant 1 star.  But the manager of the restaurant, probably wife to the owner, acted appallingly.  She was incredibly rude and confrontational.  When we asked if she thought it was OK for her customers to wait for over 2 hours for their entr\u00e9es, she said dismissively \"I'm already saying I'm sorry.  What else do you want me to say?\" \n\n\"Are you really the manager?\" I asked in utter disbelief at how rude this woman was.  \n\nShe actually then proceeded to storm into the kitchen, to get the chef/owner, complaining loudly in the dining area that still had some guests - \"She does not believe I'm the manager!\".  \n\nUnbelievable.  She caused drama in the restaurant she's managing.  \n\nThe dance event was supposed to be a celebration amongst friend and family, and unfortunately our experience with the restaurant's poor planning and management's rude behavior put a damper on it.   \n\nThe only up side was our server, who really did tried her best.  We still offered her a good tip (because it really wasn't her fault), but she simply refused to take it because she felt so bad about what we went through.  I wish the restaurant's management can take a lesson on client focus and good service from their own wait staff.   \n\nSuffice to say - we will never return to this restaurant.", "author": "W L."}

We ordered the hummus and two of us ordered wine to start. The hummus is only $4, which is the right price, because they don't make their own pita bread and barely give you that much hummus. There was actually a hair in our pita bread, and when I pointed it out to the main host (as our waiter had disappeared), he only took away the hummus and brought back a new one (I guess he didn't understand that the problem was the bread?). Then they brought this other type of bread, with an oily-sesame dip, which was good. However, they didn't knock off the ap which I think they should have done because of the hair. It was a big hair (better than a small one?). \n\nHOWEVER, after this rocky start, it was actually good. I had the vegetarian dolmas, which also included rice-stuffed summer squash and tomatoes. It was huge and had a very good yogurt cream sauce which was delicious.

The review was complimentary, but certainly did not rave about the restaurant - like I am about to.\n\nWe arrived before our friends, so had time to peruse the menu.  It looked good.  Then I turned to the wine list.  Suddenly things looked GREAT!  Wine prices like it was 1988!  I can't remember the last time I saw a good glass of wine for $3.  No really, I wasn't old enough to drink back then.  The wine was a producer called Salmon Creek.  (apparently its a well-known producer's second label for hotels and restaurants, sorry, can't remember who.)  Its really is good wine.  So, do the math... they sold us a bottle for $12.  It any other restaurant it would be twice that amount. (ok, moving on...)\n\nWe ordered the large barbecued oysters with goat and feta cheese and herbs.  Simply amazing.  They're not just large, they're HUGE and really good.  $1.75 each.  Also the quail with hummus.  Next time I'd skip the quail, it was..well.. quail-like, small and delicate and a pain to eat.  Really good, just hard to eat.  \n\nFor our entrees, we ordered fessenjean, dolmas and chicken tikka.  All good.  All well presented.  The fessenjean was some of the best I've had in the city.  If you've never had it give it a try - it is quite the gastronomical explosion.\n\nThe service was also good.  We never had to ask for more water or bread.  When I switched from Sparkling wine to Chardonnay they brought me a fresh glass.  My only small issue is that they served my sparking wine in a standard wine glass.  They also took away the dirty dishes, glasses, etc quickly.  This is a major pet peeve of mine as small tables can quickly become very crowded. \n\nAll in all it was a very good experience.  It would be very good for large groups or parties as there is plenty of room.\n\nAs I write this I am wavering over whether to give them a 4 or a 5.

Yah, this is Californian Middle Eastern, but the flaky, light and crispy phyllo dough pockets of shredded chicken goodness all smothered in pomegranate molasses and crushed pistachios triggered memories from childhood visits to The Parthenon in the Windy City (a must, if you visit Chi-Town). \n\nRecommended Appetizer: Safeehat Falafel - garbanzo bean crust with goat cheese, tomato, onion, pesto and eggplant - delicious Mediterranean style pizza.\n\nRecommended Main Course: Perdaplow - crispy, golden brown phyllo dough pocket with shredded chicken surround by a lake of raspberry-cinnamon sauce. Golden raisins and almonds with the chicken contrast beautifully with the exotic sauce.\n\nMUST-HAVE Desserts: ??? - ask for cheese cake in a phyllo dough wrapper with raspberry topping. Gooey cheese center with crispy crust and sweet fruity sauce to cut the dairy. Deelish. \n\nMenu: Jannah appears to be owned by Ya Ya. You can find the menu here: http://www.yayacuisine.com/menu.htm\n\nEnvironment: If Jannah means \"Garden\" in Arabic, then I can see how the owners are literally putting together what appears to be a coastal, garden setting. The walls are sky blue and you seriously forget that you're in Nopa, because the interior is so bizarre and new for the neighborhood. \n\nNopatite satisfied? YES. Beautifully made dishes and sweet wait staff. Beer is cheap and wonderful when eating so many rich Mediterranean foods.

Authentic cuisine with ok service, I don't see this little place lasting much longer. \n\nThe food was definitely good, but nothing was \"wow\" or \"amazing\". We started with the Babaganoush- a little too much tahini for my liking and would have preferred better pita bread (I don't think this was homemade). I had the lamb pizza and middle eastern salad (with very yummy feta dressing) and the portion size was great. My fellow diners had the phyllo dough koozi and lamb tikka kebab (wow - just realized we are all big lamb eaters!) and everyone was happy.\n\nEven without the groupon this meal would have def been cheap (all the main dishes were only $14 with large portions), I can almost see this place doing better as a more casual order-at-counter place or take-out.

I am quite picky when it comes to Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food.  Bad weather and not wanting to lose my parking space led me to give it a try........ Jannah passed with flying colors.  \n\nEverything tasted fresh and was extremely flavorful.  The Falafel Pizza (Safeehat Falafel)  that everyone raves about on Yelp lived up to the billing.  The Lamb Tikka Kabobs came out a perfect Medium-Rare to Medium and were accompanied by everything pickled (cabbage, garlic cloves, cucumbers, cauliflower...)  For me, a sure sign of freshness was the Tabbouleh salad.  The cucumbers were crisp and the tomatoes firm.\n\nWe also tried the Kuzi (phylo dough filled with shredded lamb rice almonds golden raisins allspice cinnamon and ginger served with pomegranate-rosemary sauce).  It was sweeter than the average entree, but delicious nonetheless.\n\nThere was also a belly dancer which added an entertaining aspect (though mildly awkward in a small setting).  There is a decent selection of wine by the bottle but very limited by the glass.  I stuck with the Anchor Steam on tap.\n\nEveryone seems to complain about the service.... but what do you want??? When my beer was low I was asked if I wanted another.... when a plate was completed, the plate was removed in a timely manner.... when the meal was done I was asked if I wanted coffee or desert.  I'll take this over a hovering waiter any day.\n\nPrices were very reasonable as well.  An appetizer, two entrees, and 2 pints of beer came out to $40.

This place has very delicious food, but is poorly understaffed. Each waiter/waitress was so nice but the fact that they were constantly running around just trying to meet everyone's needs and their frantic faces really showed how much  more help this place needs. If they had more waitors I think we could notch it up at least another 1/2 star. Mind you they really tried to be of service, just didn't have enough octopus arms to help every single person. It was just chaos waiting to be seated - there was no hostess to even know who was next so they said who's next and whoever raised their hand first got seated. So, that being said...\n\nThe food was great! I LOVED the falafel pizza and the lamb phyllo. That phyllo dish is to die for, but alas the kabobs are so plain and mundane. For 1/2 the price, you can get a better kabob within a mile's radius. Whoever recommended the sun dried lime drink must love super sour drinks (this tastes sort of like the sour plum flavor that many Chinese people like... yeck).

It was right next to a Mexican burrito joint and I figured you can eat that anytime.  We walked in and the restaurant was empty.  It was very clean however and we were greeted by the sweetest waitress.  She radiated an aura of sweetness, or maybe it was a field created by some heavenly scent she emitted.  I ordered the lamb something, and the comrade ordered the walnut sweet chicken.  Before the food came, we were given a little basket of bread.  Tasting it, it literally tasted like a hot dog bun.  It was hot dog bun in cube form.  Then the food was presented towards us.  Giving me some of her chicken, it tasted like desert...it was so sweet.  Laughing at her misery, I tried my lamb, and it pretty much had no taste.  The rice was very dry, thus, we basically ate out of politeness because as I said earlier, the waitress was too sweet.  After half an hour of playing and picking with our food, exchanging funny looks, playing footsies, and trying to hide food under our spoon to make...I asked for a box.  I am not the type to complain about food or threaten to send it back--the Gestapo died along with WWII and I do not want the serveurs to serve with a figurative Luger pointed at their heads.  Sometimes you get good food, sometimes you don't-'tis the way of life.  \n\nTo end this on a positive note, they have bottles and bottles of wine shelved.  Maybe it would be a good idea to get blasted beforehand, before stuffing your face with hot dog bun bread.  If you see a waitress wearing sketchers, that is the sweet waitress and please tip her more.", "author": "Brian V."}

The first trip was funny as there was a power outage just as we had placed our order. They told us the kitchen was down and they spent some time banging away at something on the roof. They were very sweet and apologetic - bough us each a glass of wine and asked us to please come back another time. \nWe did. We had a fantastic time!! Not only is the service friendly and fun, the recent upgrades to the ambiance make a huge impact, new lighting and drapes, but the food is really good and very different. \nWe started the last time with a yummy Hummus. i had the whole fish which was light and crispy, flavorful and just what I wanted. I can't remember what my friend had but she really loved it. I am not a fan of eggplant normally - but as has been noted in other reviews- the way they do the eggplant is fantastic and makes me want to change my mind about the plant. \nTwo days ago we returned for another round of happy. We started with the BBQ'd oysters. They are not kidding, these are some big oysters. They were flavored with feta, goat cheese and herbs. They were unlike anything I have ever had and they were wonderful. Really fantastic. I had the Kuzi. Again it was unlike anything I had ever tried. The lamb and rice wrapped in Phyllo was presented beautifully. The accompanying sauce was unusual and delicious. It was a pomegranate rosemary sauce thickened with corn starch and it gave the dish a very dynamic quality nicely offsetting the appropriate gaminess of the lamb. My friend had the Samosas and enjoyed them immensely. \nThis is a restaurant that continues to please me and one to which I will be returning on a regular basis. Be adventurous!!

I shared a phyllo cake stuffed with rice, garbanzo beans, almonds fat, meaty shrimp and not too slimy scallops, all bathing in a shallow cinnamon pool of sauce. Previously, we had gotten the burma-not the location but a lamb based chili with lentils, which had a wonderful texture and hearty taste. The dolmas, or yaya's grapes were plump, and flavorful. (Though the nomenclature may be off-putting, the appetizer itself makes up for any visuals of chewing on some old dudes pruney grapes.) \nAs for the hookah? It was robust and cheap! $12 dolla.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-08-16", "description": "I really wanted to like this place. I live 2 blocks away and have been anxiously awaiting the opening of a new restaurant in the neighborhood. After the paper was pulled off the windows and the lights were turned on, my enthusiasm dropped a little bit. The place looks cheap and the lights are way too bright for dinner. But the food is really the most important part of a restaurant, and they do takeout, so I still remained hopeful that it would all end for the best.\n\nLast night the remainder of my hope was brutally killed. I read the yelp reviews and saw the vast majority being positive and raving about the food, except for the lone dissenter, who compared the bread to hot dog buns, but I was skeptical of his review as he stated he is not a fan of middle eastern food. I on the other hand am a fan of middle eastern food, and the food at Jannah is just plain horrible. Some of the worst I've eaten in the bay area. I suspect most of the people who have reviewed it here are either friends/family of the restaurant owner, or part of a religions cult that believes food should be used to punish us for our sins.\n\nOur meal started with the complementary bread, and as another yelper mentioned, it tastes kind of like a hot dog bun. But plenty of places skimp on the bread, so I wasn't too put off. We ordered the salad & hummous for starters. The salad was fine, nothing great, but not bad either, it's pretty hard to mess up a salad. Then the hummous came, which was my first real indication that something was going wrong. The hummous was bland and the pita bread wasn't even as good as the stuff you get in a bag at the grocery store.\n\nFinally we ordered our entrees and that's when the train went off the tracks. We ordered the kuzi (lamb wrapped in phylo) and another dish I can't remember the name of, but was pomegranate chichen of some sort. There was nothing good about either of them. First the presentation: they looked like they came straight out of a can of dog food. just a round lump in the middle of the plate. One came on top of a plate of rice with a few (over)steamed vegetables. Then came the taste, really attrocious. The pomegranate chicken was sickly sweet, and the chicken itself was kind of flavorless. I've had pomegranate chicken before at other places and enjoyed it. The other dish was slightly better, but that's not saying much.\n\nThe food was so bad we couldn't finish our meal, and that's a rare thing for me, I will eat just about anything.\n\nThe one good thing about the place was the staff, they were very nice and the service was just fine. The seem a little inexperienced overall, but made up for that with enthusiasm.\n\nI guess you could say the food is relatively inexpensive, but for what you actually get it's still way overpriced.\n\nIf you are looking for Mediterranean/ Middle Eastern food you will have a much better experience at Ziryab on Divisadero, la Mediterranea on Fillmore, or that place on Haight, which I can't remember the name of right now. The prices are about the same, but much better food.\n\nIf you just want a good, but inexpensive meal in the neighborhood, go to Papalote, or Green Chile Kitchen, or the Vietnamese place on Hayes & Masonic. Any one of those has better and cheaper food than Jannah.\n\nMy last suggestion if you still want to give it a try, just order one entree to start, if you like it you can always order more, but I doubt you will.", "author": "Fred B."}

Perfectly curried scallops in profusion layered over meltingly roasted rounds of mellow, savory eggplant, over roasted cauliflower and zucchini (these alone would pull me back to Jannah!), over  a generous circle of rice, the whole thing surround by a sauce of spinach and mideast spices that work mouth-wateringly in combination with the plate's ingredients.\n\nSqueeze had the combo with lamb and hummus, tabbouleh, salad, pickled onion and veg, and some super-hot little yummy peppers. As others have mentioned, the lamb was sophisticated and flavorful and not OLD. Squeeze said this was the first tabbouleh he's actually *liked*. All others are bitter or have bad dressing or both.\n\nBut I haven't mentioned one of the true geniuses of this place...\n\nPita and lavash breads that are fluffly and light and delicious all on their own!

I stumbled upon it by accident while walking on Fulton one day, then read many good things about it here and on CH, so I was psyched to have a good experience.  Instead we were shocked at how bad it was.  It got the impression that they've given up and are sinking fast.  Truly disappointing.", "author": "KC J."}

There are so few places to enjoy middle eastern food, which in my mind is always so much more rich when there is a beautiful talented dancer to add delight to the evening. If you want an evening of incredible dancing and good food I highly recommend this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-28", "description": "I love his food!\n\nYahya Salih's latest San Francisco restaurant, Jannah's (named after his daughter), once again adds a humble jewel to the city's Middle Eastern culinary register. Since the days when his former incarnation, \"YaYa\", shared Michael Bauer's \"Top 100\" Bay Area restaurant list, Yahya has struggled to regain the same hallowed gastronomic attention-hold. Yahya's faded interim fame boldly underscores that restaurateur success does not depend solely on the quality of the end product, which has never faltered. Yahya's flare was declared at Balboa Caf\u00e9 with Jeremiah Tower during its halcyon days, when his, \"Mesopatamia with Californian twist\" fresh-food cuisine was lauded by James Beard, the patriarch of American gourmet cooking. A couple of poor locations, writers' fashion and an intrinsically non self-promoting nature (a skill that did not rub off from Tower) have hampered Yahya's durable recognition. While it is difficult to rise up again, in our opinion, Jannah's - conveniently situated on Folsom between Masonic and Central - is poised to restore justice.\n\nJannah's dishes are loaded with freshness, flavor and flare, and are hand-prepared by the maestro himself with palpable affection. The young waiters are inexperienced but we found them very courteous, attentive and eager to please. Don't be dissuaded by the preposterously low prices. \n\nFor lunch, try the lamb or chicken kebabs with a crisp fresh salad ($9.00). For dinner, the lamb shank was among the best we've tasted anywhere, and truly unbelievable for $12.00. Yahya's kuzi and perdaplow are delicious and unique, and his fesenjoon captures the essence of what made him famous. Try kelecha as a light dessert or indulge yourself with a melt-in-the-mouth, kenafa.  \n\nI have never been disappointed....", "author": "Coco W."}

I'm happy they're back in the city! They don't have the Nomad menu any more, but something priced more for student budgets. I had the Kuzi and my partner had the Sambosak. We also split three appetizers (hummus, pickles, and Jannah), and then tea all for under $35.00. Everything was delicious. If you're a little shy about having \"sweet\" entrees, then stick with the kebobs. If they're like what they had at Ya-Ya, then they're terrific. Otherwise, if you want to have a lamb \"pie\" flavored with sweet and aromatic spices then definitely order the kuzi. It's shredded lamb with rice, almonds, and raisins baked in phillo dough. When you slice it open you are hit with the aroma of allspice, cinnamon, and ginger. It's plated on a \"sweet\" sauce of pomegranate and rosemary which you can add to the entree according to your taste. The Sambosak was a more savory, vegetarian entree of spinach, mushroom, and feta with a walnut-based sauce. That was also terribly delicious. Depending on my mood, I might order that or the kebabs next time. \n\nThey have a new \"pizza\"-oriented lunch menu which I'm going to try later, too.
