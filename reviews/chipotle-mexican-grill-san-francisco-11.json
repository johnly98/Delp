It's a combination of employees who don't care, cooks who don't care, and the lowbrow chain atmosphere of the dining area. It seems Yelp reviews have really taken a dive from the higher-quality, witty reviews of the early days. Reviews for this location, especially, seem like they're from people who don't know how to think or write. \n\nI was right in front of the counter for a while, but the young, round-faced Filipina employee failed to greet me or pay any attention to me. Finally, I had to ASK her for help. I asked some totally valid questions, but she was rude and dismissive. As she was making my order, she seemed cold and uninterested in interacting with me. Then I saw her being much nicer and attentive to other customers. The East Asian cashier was less obviously nasty than the Filipina one. But still nastier to me than to other customers. The cashier forgot to give me my chips, and I had to go back to ASK for them again. I asked if the chips came with salsa, and the Filipina employee rudely said they can give it if I wanted it. I chose a corn salsa, and she impatiently put a bit in a container and practically threw it at me. And, as usual, no \"thank you\" or parting courteous phrase towards me whatsoever. Then later, I went up to the cashier again and asked for a to-go container and bag. She handed them to me wordlessly - because, as usual, I was too subhuman for any words. \n\nThe receipt had the incorrect restroom code. I called their number, and Holly said to try a different code. Why didn't they update the restroom code on the receipt?\n\nThe rice was too hard - overcooked, or not enough water used. As usual, it was subpar, poorly-made food that was hard to scarf down.

I've always had a stellar meal here for $10 or less. The food/ingredients are fresh (none of that unwanted grease or lard you find at most taquerias). Their burrito assembly line is always friendly and very good about getting you in and out in a timely manner.\n\nI recently swung by their Metreon location for a quick Mexican bowl. I filled it up with grilled chicken, brown rice, black beans, lettuce, medium salsa, and a dollop of sour cream. Totally hit the spot. The chicken was juicy and tender, the lettuce and salsa were fresh, and my meal didn't put me in a food coma. The whole experience lasted 20 minutes and cost me just $7.\n\nSo why all the haters? Is it because Chipotle is a national chain (and partly owned by McDonald's)? \nWhat ever the case, I'm going to against the grain and declare to the world that I think Chipotle Mexican Grill is a perfectly good place to grab a quick lunch. And given their long lines out the door (on a daily basis), I have to assume that I'm not alone in this opinion.", "author": "Kevin B."}

My favorite Chipotle is in Santa Ana, CA, where they offer me a complimentary beverage while I wait to pick up my online orders, but this Chipotle at the Metreon...it's a close second. \n\nEvery time I come to pick up an order at lunchtime, they're fast and friendly and my order is correct (which isn't exactly over-the-top customer service, but I appreciate it). Today, I ordered my usual veggie bowl, but I indicated that I wanted the guacamole on the side. They forgot it, which was not a big deal. I could see they had a million catering orders and they were really busy. I didn't think twice about it. Then I got a phone call from the kind man who filled my order, apologizing for forgetting my guacamole and promising to make it right in the future. Seriously? When's the last time you went to order food, encountered a mistake and had them identify it and call you to apologize? That never happens. Pretty awesome. \n\nGood job, Chipotle at the Metreon.

The cilantro-lime rice just tastes like plain rice, and the pinto beans cooked with bacon just taste like plain beans. The meats aren't very exciting either. They definitely don't contain the flavorful spices and seasonings you can find in well-made al pastor or chorizo from other local Mexican restaurants.

I stopped going about three months ago because a dispute i had when asking for extra portions.  I only went today (1/24/16) to get a burrito bowl for my girlfriend.  During the dispute, I complained to my servers about the low amount of meat my friend and I got (1/3rd of a spoonful).  I asked for more and what I got was another quarter spoonful but was charged for DOUBLE MEAT.  The portions USED to be generous and the service was good.  The service is still  acceptable but the food has been on the decline for a year and a half.\n\nPros\n- They do give a lot of rice and beans these days so if carbs are your thing, this is the place to be.  However, I go to chipotle for a FAT-ASS meal, not just rice and beans.\n\nCons: \n- The portions these days are definitely under.  My friends and I used to get a full scoop if not more.  Recently, we're lucky to get 3/4 of a spoonful.\n- The guac is often too sour.  It's like they drenched it with lemon juice..\n- The chips are a hit or miss.  Sometimes they're amazing.  Perfectly crispy, just the right amount of salt but sometimes they're soft and tasteless. \n\nShoutout:\n- The young new hire with dandruff-ridden hair hidden who mocked me after my complaint regarding portions.\n- The shorter stocky hire who responded to my request for double meat by giving me another 1/4 scoop instead of a full.\n\nI do want to write that the redeeming quality of this Chipotle is the customer service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-09-08", "description": "I tried both the Chicken and Beef burritos here, and they were both pretty disappointing. Maybe because I am used to so many good places in SF, with large burritos, fresh salsa and chips. They were a little more than half the size of a regular burrito in many SF shops, but probably enough for lunch. But I guess what struck me the most is they just tasted bland to me.", "author": "Dave G."}

It's located close to where I work and you can get your burrito or bowl to go and head for Yerba Buena park. The service has sped up considerably since this location first opened but you run the risk of the place being mobbed by conference goers. The main seating area is also kind of awkward...long, elevated benches with bar stool style seats right next to the line of people waiting to order.", "author": "Chapman S."}

However, we've been severely disappointed every time we've tried to eat here. The staff is very unorganized and are not very friendly, they are ALWAYS out of some sort of meat or guacamole, which is kind of weird and disappointing. They also don't seem to be very customer focused, which is sad b/c Chiptole is usually amazing with customers. We will go out of our way to go to a different one as to avoid this location. That's unfortunate and we hope you make some changes!", "author": "Brent T."}

My coworkers and I came over to check it out on Friday for lunch.\n\nThe awesome thing about it: huge dining/seating area. Out of the four Chipotles that are within walking distance in SOMA/Financial District, two have really crappy, crowded seating. I was ecstatic to see individual tables with lots of room around them, and many places to sit. There's also the stools with the big communal tables if you like that as well.\n\nThat's about where all the awesome went away though.\n\nThe staff was friendly and considerate, but it was a difficult run through that line to get my burrito. One employee had a really difficult to understand voice (I don't know quite what it was, but I had to ask them to repeat at least three times to hear what they were saying, and I heard the next two people behind me do the same thing). This employee also screwed up my request for a whole wheat tortilla, and I wound up with a white tortilla with brown rice. Eh, no big deal. Then at the end of the line, when I was getting toppings, I requested extra cheese. I said it three times, and the employee started rolling it up, and my coworker actually spoke up to say \"hey, she asked for extra cheese\". The employee didn't even hear *him* request it, and by this time, it was mostly wrapped, so I told my friend to not worry. I don't know if it was just too noisy or if the employee was so focused on just finishing up what was in their line that they weren't listening to me, but I was a bit disappointed that I didn't get what I was trying to request.\n\nAh well, I sit down, ready for my burrito. But first, I go on a hunt for the #1 thing that brings me to Chipotle over other burrito joints... chipotle flavoured tabasco sauce!\n\nWhat's this? Just regular tabasco? Oooookay? Friend goes to the cashier and asks about the chipotle sauce. Nope, they're out/don't have it. \n\nThis was my happy face... :|\n\nI'm sorry, but why in the world would they *NOT* have this? Every Chipotle I've gone to has it and to be frank, it's the only reason I go there. I can get better burritos in other taquerias around the city, but I've not seen any carry chipotle tabasco sauce. \n\nFail new Chipotle shop, fail. I'll go to the one in the mall since it's the same distance *and* they have the sauce. The seating sucks, but I can deal with that if I have my tabasco.  Get the right tabasco sauce at this one, and I'll re-do the review and give it at least one more star.", "author": "Cassandra J."}

I love Chipotle. I would eat it every day if I could. Like In n Out, it's always consistant. I can get the same delicious thing every time I go and it will be just as delicious as the last time I had it. \n\nThere's nothing to really say about this location other than it's clean and big. Every Chipotle is the same, food-wise. I was eating a burrito here last week and a staff member wiping down the long table I was sitting on the end of, asked me how my meal was. I'm not use to that at a Chipotle. I was caught off guard, considering my mouth was full of burrito and I mumbled a bunch of noises and he smiled. They get a star for that.

I've only been here twice (once to this location and once in New York where I honestly was not impressed at all). The burrito bowl I got was mammoth. Felt like perhaps a little bit too much cheese. I can hear you now: how can there ever be too much cheese? Well, there can. But if that's the worst problem with this place, that's pretty good.", "author": "Amanda P."}

Reason? Well, their bowls seem like a small snack...they just don't put enough food in it!

I immediately brought to the notice of the guy who was at the cash counter.    His reaction was very cold, not at all regretting - He simply said \"Oh! I will let them know.\" and turned his head to get on with his work.    He simply didnt's care which bothered me more than the raw rice.
