As you walk in, I did not think they would have good brunch quality meals as it mainly looked like a bar scene. Don't ever judge a book by its cover! I ordered a breakfast sandwich (eggs any style, bacon, avocado, cheese on a brioche bun) with tater-tots and it was scrumptious. My husband ordered the lumberjack breakfast which came with french toast sticks. It's more like a french toast loaf! It looked so good and it was still warm, I had to try it. I am glad I did! It was the best thing ever! \n\nWe had the moscow mule jello shot. Very creative jello shot - tasted great and good amount of alcohol. Their mimosa's were great, and the fact that they were bottomless didn't hurt either.

When I realized I'd never done Wing Wednesday at Bullitt, I organized a get together for Wednesday, October 18th. There were seven of us, so two in our party showed up early, around 5pm, to grab a table. Due to work, I joined everyone around 6pm. We had a table in the back behind the bar.\n\n*$0.25 wings: Buffalo, Sweet Chili Habanero, BBQ, Wasabi Miso Ginger, Carolina Reaper Death Wings of Destruction / Atomic ($0.25) x82\n*Truffle Tots ($12.50)\n*Totchos: tater tot nachos ($11)\n*Old Fashioned on Draft: bourbon, butters, simple syrup, garnished with orange peel & cherry ($10.58) x3\n*Shot & a Beer: Jameson & any bottled beer ($10.58), Maike it a 40oz (+$4)\n*The Cloak and Dagger: whiskey, fresh blackberries, fresh lemon, mint ($10.58) x2\n*The Day Breaker: vodka, aperol, fresh strawberries, fresh lemon, seltzer ($11)\n*Bud Light 40: St Louis MO, ABV 4.2%, served in a brown paper bag with a condom ($9.13)\n*Standard Deviant Calista Pale Ale: San Francisco CA, ABV 5.9% ($6.25) x2\n*Stella Artois Lager: Belgium, ABV 5% ($6.25) x4\n*Magnolia Proving Ground IPA: San Francisco CA, ABV 7% ($6.25) x2\n*Oban ($17.11) x3\n*Laphroaig ($12.54)\n*Casamigos Reposado ($8.65)\n\nSo a few of us tried the atomic wings. These are definitely not for the faint of heart. I was the only one able to eat two of them, but it burned! Make sure to try the other wings before you try these or else your taste buds will be blown. Aside from the melt my face off wings, I enjoyed the habanero wings. Good balance of sweet and spicy. The tots were delish! Though I do have a weakness for tater tots. They remind me of childhood. I ended up drinking many beers and pours of oban. And ended the night with the jameson and 40.\n\nOur waitress Ariel was an absolute sweetheart! I know wing wendnesday can get a little crazy with everyone ordering a million wings at a time, but she managed to stay friendly and attentive. Especially since we had everyone showing up at different times and were ordering throughout the night.\n\nLooking through our check and the menu, I did notice some items are listed as less and some more. I guess in the end it all evens out, but if you are a stickler in terms of math, I'd double check your bill before you leave. \n\nFun spot for $0.25 wings. You really can't beat that deal. Especially when they are normally 8 for $10, 12 for $14, or 24 for $24. Since I am a wing addict, I will most likely be back. I'll just make sure to show up early as it gets packed.", "author": "Elena N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-18", "description": "So....sometimes you see something and hear people talk about it but you still don't believe it. I really had to visit \"Bullitt\" and see if the \"40oz in the brown bag\" was really something they serve and guess what....Yup it's indeed true (As if I didn't know already) but I'm very stubborn and sometimes have to see something for myself to know that it's what it is, and it was just that a \"40oz in a brown paper bag\" oh and a condom. Here is my review.\n\nTuesday March 6th, 2018\nLocation: Bullit San Francisco, Ca\nPeople: 1 Adult\n\nStory:\nOh after a very long absence from my home away from home it was time for me to go home. I have made a pact with myself, whenever I go to SF to visit somewhere new and discover what the city has to offer and see what others are \"Yelping\" and Raving about. I been on a mission to check off my SF bookmarks and what better place than \"Bullitt\" to start with. It's near all my \"North Beach\" hangouts and it also happened to \"Taco Tuesday\" as well so it was a no brainier.\n\nService/Hospitality:\nA great first impression, that's what I got from the bartender here. I felt welcomed from the moment I stepped in. The bartender (sorry I forgot his name) gave me a rundown of the offering on the menu, the specials of the day and even chuckled when I asked about the \"40oz in the brown paper bag\".. with a condom. The people that was there that day was friendly and it happen to be a warriors game day. All around I felt welcomed here and the service was top notch.\n\nFood/Cleanliness:\nThis place is very chic and perfect for dates and casual hanging out with friends (Sidenote) it was very clean and tidy in here even the restroom was clean and we'll maintained. It was nice to visit a \"North Beach\" bar that was all around clean and not just a usual \"Divebar\" when it came to cleanliness. Now on to the food, it was \"Taco Tuesday\" and they had 3 choices for the evening, Steak, Chicken and Fish. I went with the Steak and fish $1.00 each with guacamole and crema $.50 for each taco bringing the order to $3.00 for these two. They were okay, rather basic tacos with not much flavor to them to be honest. Pretty skimpy on the protein, but then again I didn't expect much. Next up the \"Tatchos\" I put these in parentheses because they were the bomb! Nachos but instead of chips they used tater tots, your usual (depending on person) toppings, and a great portion. My only grip I feel for the $13.00 price, is that some sort of protein (ground beef) should of been standard with this dish. I washed it down with a \"Brown Bagless 40oz\" with a condom $9.13 of Bud Light as they ran out of the other beer options. So my grand total with the $.93 SF Employee Mandate and tax $2.05 came out to $27.11\n\nOverall:\nI feel \"Bullitt\" is a pretty cool place for drinks and the occasional light bite and for that alone I can see myself visiting this place on occasions. I don't feel like their prices are the most competitive, but I do like the overall vibe and atmosphere of this place and that alone I feel is what makes this place trendy. I say if you're in SF and looking for something new and different from your normal bar/pub crawl, I would recommend this place totally.", "author": "Tre S."}

It's quite small so people were standing around everywhere. This was our first time at Wing Wednesday and we quickly realized that it was first come first serve. Everyone was watching everyone like hawks. About 20 minutes and 1 beer later we eyed up 2 girl who were leaving and took their seats. It was almost 9 PM and I was starving at this point!\n\nWe had to close our tab at the bar because you cant transfer it to the table and it is not included in the 2 drink per person minimum! (KEEP THI S IN MIND) \n\nWe ordered a dozen hot wings and 8 mango habanero to start off and 2 more drinks! The wings were saucy and delicious! If you like a kick, mango habanero is for you. If you enjoy regular old spicy wings go for the hot. We finished the first batch so quickly since we were quite hungry and ordered the second round, more hot and some honey bbq. Once again the wings were saucy and delicious. They came right from the frier. \n\nOverall, great wings and a good deal.

When we arrived, there was nobody to sit us down. We were confused on who the workers were. Eventually a guy who came out of no where had to ID check us told us to just sit ourselves down. We then were waiting for 20 minutes for the waitress to even notice us. And she did not interact with us. She just gave us the menus and left. She was so concerned about her tips she was receiving from closing out peoples checks. I dont know her name but she had short colored hair. And it was just not professional on how she was working. We were so angry at this point we didnt even want to stay anymore. It was already 30 minutes in and she did not pay attention at all. I believe this place shouldnt be serving food in such a loud environment when the workers were so concerned for people only wanting drinks and not serving people who wanted to order food.

My friends and I came early Saturday morning (aka before they opened at 10am) to wait for a table, but were told that their tables were all reserved for birthday parties and larger parties. We opted for the bar seating, which had about 12-15 seats. That was a little unexpected, but we should've known considering the price haha. Overall great atmosphere with smiley, helpful bartenders. Friends and I had a good time, and thought the experience was above average for the price and the drinks. We left feeling very good and were only down about $25/ person ($15.5 base + $4.5 tax + $5 tip)\n\nTips: \n- Come early if your small party is without a reservation. You won't get a seat otherwise lol. \n- Lotsa street parking, but you gotta come early ~\n- Your Groupon doesn't come with tax or tip, and this amount will be charged after your meal. Tax was based on original price, which was around $40 - it's suggested that you tip with this in mind as well.", "author": "Vy T."}

However, it is very hard to wake up late for Bullitt because there is quite a long wait. Reason being... unlimited mimosas and a Groupon deal combined. If you get the Groupon (and why wouldn't you?), note that it is only valid on weekends from 10am-3pm. The wait can vary and can go up to an hour or more but you can put your name down with your phone number and they'll text or call you when it's almost time to get seated so you can go around the block to explore. Probably best to come before 1 PM 'cause the last time we try to come at that time, we weren't able to get a table before they ended brunch.\n\nGroupon deal is brunch for two: two brunch entrees, two shots of Fireball, and bottomless mimosas. We bought two Groupons for my party of four.\n\nWAKE & BACON GRILLED CHEESE \nComes with roasted tomato soup and mixed greens. I love grilled cheese and tomato soup and the grilled cheese was perfectly grilled.\n\nLUMBERJACK BREAKFAST\nYour basic breakfast of eggs, bacon, ham, toast, and.... french toast stick. Also comes with tater tots or homefries. \n\nFRIED CHICKEN & WAFFLES\nComes with Jameson whipped cream and fresh berry compote. The chicken is like chicken tenders. The waffles are fluffy Belgian waffles and it comes pre-cut in four pieces. Definitely easy to share dish since everything is cut out for you.\n\nBLT + A\nEggs benedict (BLT style). Comes with tater tots or homefries. \n \nBig filling portions. Music was actually good (those 90s hits!). Mimosas kept coming. Had to go to the bathroom twice.

There was just street parking but it's on Polk which has a lot of other restaurants too so it would've been hard to find parking. \n\nSETTING: It was nice for my friend and I to kick back and enjoy the Giant's game. It definitely had a warm and inviting vibe to it. The ceilings are quite high so it didn't get too loud despite the amount of people that were there. There aren't too many tables and I think it would've been hard to accommodate a big group here. The atmosphere is great, I'd come back just to chill. There's a full bar and bar seating as well as tables around it. There's also many TVs surrounding the exterior of the room. Also, the restaurant has free wifi! \n\nSERVICE: The bartender that served us was so friendly and kind, I wish I got his name because he was cute :^) It was my friend and I's first time trying out bottomless mimosas and they made it an enjoyable experience. We had to wait a few times for our mimosas to be refilled and even when we finished our food, they told us we were welcome to stay and watch the game while we sipped on mimosas. I also had to remind our bartender that our groupon came with two shots of fireball, which he apologized about forgetting about and served that up right away. \n\nFOOD: \n- My friend and I wanted to try something sweet and savory so we decided on the Classic Eggs Benedict ($9.50) and the French Toast Sticks. The eggs Benedict came with two poached eggs on an English muffin, Canadian bacon and hollandaise sauce, and we chose tater tots as a side. I would've liked the yolk to be a little more runny because it didn't have my desired egg porn shot :'( Other than that, it was pretty solid! \n- The french toast sticks came with 4 large sticks of challah bread had a cinnamon sugar coating. It also came with whipped cream, a berry compote, and maple syrup so that you could dip your french toast sticks in them! We split the two plates and they were very filling. \n\nThe Groupon that I bought was $27 thanks to the honey app (it originally would have been $40) for two entrees, two shots of fireball, and bottomless mimosas! Keep in mind that the Groupon doesn't come without tax and tip, which my friend and I added $30 for those alone for the good service.", "author": "Anne P."}

That's right. They are tiny! So if you are going for dinner and get anything less than four, i might judge you. There is an option for chicken, beef, veggie, and fish. Didn't try the veggie but got one chicken, one fish, and 2 beef. They were delicious! They each come with a bunch of goodies on them (including sour cream and guac which is always a necessity for me). Not sure if they change weekly since this was my first time but they were really yummy. We also each got a double marg and chips and guac/salsa. \n\nOur server rocked! not sure her name but she was super friendly, helpful, attentive, and cool. Love the low key vibe here (she was wearing a bart simpson shirt). I was actually pretty surprised this bar wasn't more crowded considering the unreal taco deals. I would highly recommend this place for taco tuesday, especially if you're looking for somewhere where you can actually sit down (vs Nicks nearby where it is pretty much standing room only). \n\nWill definitely be back!", "author": "Ilana B."}

Plus the deafening bro-chatter during packed nights/weekends are just impossible but with $5 Mondays, all is well with the world again in Russian Hill. \n\nWho can resist fried spuds that is then doused with melted cheese right? The totchos from the tater tot bar are fine but they definitely get very repetitive fast. I split it with just one other friend so definitely recommend sharing this with a larger group. In the end, think I would have much preferred the taters on their own. It feels like there's a big store-bought component to the dish which perhaps suggests why it's so heavy. On the flip side, I've been by late during $5 Monday and had The Ranger fried chicken sandwich and I was honestly quite impressed. That is one well-balanced and thought out sandwich. I mean fried chicken, applewood bacon, and cheddar? The avocado and sprouts were a nice touch to lighten up the sandwich. \n\n Service is typically good although it can get spotty when it's packed. If all you want is some comfort bar grub, Bullit is your place. Lots of specials during the week like $0.25 wing Wednesday bring in crowds, but is manageable later in the evening.

Nestled among the rows and rows of bars in the Polk-Gulch area, Bullitt is a true gem.  The bar from the outside looks like it might be a bit of a dive, but if you walk in it is clean and cozy.  The bar takes up just about one wall of the place and then some little high tops surround the other wall.  Great for groups, date night, or catching up with friends. \n\nMy fiance and I grabbed two seats at a fairly empty bar on a weekend and were immediately greeted by the friendly bartender.  Good selection of house cocktails and beers at reasonable prices for the area. (bottle beers are $5, drafts are $6.50 and cocktails ~$11 +).  We both went for the \"El Ron\" a spicy twist on a margarita with tequila, Serrano Chilies and fresh grapefruit. A nice wake you up cocktail with a good kick from the chilies.  For food we shared the Tofu Banh-Mi with housecut fries.  The fries were the standout of this dish, crispy, lightly salted and a masssssive portion.  The Banh-Mi was just meh. I thought the whole sandwich was just... soft. I usually like the Banh-mi from local sandwich shops with the crispy bread so soak up all the goodness, but this was was on a super soft roll and combined with the kinda mushy tofu it was just a bit of a miss. But, overall decent flavors I am just not sure if that would be my pick next time. The real hi-light on the menu appeared to be the 'totchos' (which are only $5 on Thursday all night). \n\nIn all, a great experience at Bullitt.

The bread was nice & crunchy with some softness still added to it, the bacon slices were thick, which I loved & there was just the perfect amount of cheese & tomato. The soup that came along was delicious as well! Perfect for dipping the grilled cheese into it.\n\nAs for the tots that I asked for instead of the mixed green was like almost every other tots I have had except they tasted less greasy & I couldn't stop eating them! I also didn't feel like crap after eating them as well & trust me I ATE the hell out of them haha. They also are very generous when giving you tots too, which I love!\n\nAfter a certain time the bar/restaurant turns into like a mini dive, they move the tables out of the way so there's more standing room.\n\nOverall I give this place 5 stars.

All the food, $5. I wish I knew that otherwise I would have had dinner there. I'm not sure if this is a weekly thing on Monday nights but among all the bars on Polk Street this one sure had the most happening action...probably for that reason.\n\nI grabbed a seat at the bar and threw down on a few vodka and OJs. I could have easily gone for some crazier drinks but given that I was in unchartered territory I had to be careful... I normally go for beer but why pay $5 for something that would cost three or four bucks? One of the bartenders hooked me up with a shot that wasn't but tasted like a whiskey. At that point I had to simmer down.\n\nI like the crowd of this place. It was a mix of people in their 20s and 30s enjoying a few drinks after work.

When is a 25 cent wing not good? It's like a free T-shirt. What was good and not cheap though was all the fernet and beer my friends and I bought. Bullitt is an ideal place for a weekday food/EtOH session where the hardness level is limited to about 6 out of 10.\n\nOur bartender was very nice. She is planning to be a dentist.

This was the first stop and then the last stop during a supremely long night of bar hopping for my best friend's birthday. If you end up here and your group wants to stay, my advice is to drink...heavily. \n\nAs the night goes on and they stop serving food, they move the tables out of the way. Your options for seating are limited to a long, wall spanning wooden bench or a stool at the bar. There's no decor or really anything memorable about this place. Over the few hours spent here, I had a vodka pineapple and two Makers on the rocks. Impossible to screw up. The birthday girl wasn't so lucky as she was given a gratis \"coffee flavored thing\" with whipped cream on top. She paid the price for it later. \n\nLike most dive bars, when this place gets packed, it gets 10 times as gross. As people get drunker, they get sloppier. Think sweaty people dancing awkwardly in a cramped space, incessant spilling of drinks, having no choice but to rub against strangers to exit due to the lack of room. Whoever is responsible for the playlist needs to expand their horizons immediately. I can only hear so many terrible Zedd remixes on a crackling PA before my hands start forming into fists. The clientele is varied, but has a serious bro contingent. Lots of man tanks, hair product, and self importance. Let's just say you are definitely not going to meet your soul mate here. \n\nPro tip: If you are waiting for your wasted friends and want to have a good laugh, sit on the bench outside right before closing time. \n\nTwo stars for the amiable door guy and the generous pours of Makers.", "author": "Ruby G."}

But, the margaritas, I have to say, were EXCELLENT!

I guess my feelings about this place really depend on my mood that night and what time of night I go. This is by far the most crowded bar in the Upper Polk area. If you come after 10:30 PM on a Fri or Sat night, good luck getting inside. I'm not sure how anyone can keep up a conversation here when the music is blasting off the speakers, let alone get a drink. Think Tipsy Pig, but different location and smaller! I guess people tend to go where the crowds are, or some people do. For their drinks, I stick to beer since I don't think their cocktails are particularly good. Again, not sure why people enjoy this place when the drinks aren't even that good.\n\nNow, for the food, that's another story. If you come here between 7-9 pm, it's a much quieter place and a very different atmosphere. You have friends or couples dining here or coming here to grab a beer. You can actually have a conversation while enjoying one of their many grilled cheese sandwiches or super salads. I had a bacon, brie and apple panini here once and it was amazing.

One star for tot-chos, (perfect bar food) one star for Maker's on tap, one star for Fernet on tap, and one star for Mark, the mustachioed bartender.  We were here last night using a coupon, and we had just seen the Drinking Made Easy show that featured Bullitt (bought the coupon before seeing the show) so we had no excuse not to go on a rainy Tuesday.\n\nBullitt is part upscale local dive where you can kick back and conversate with the bartender, one part fancy drinks place, (Mark is a fine mixologist, as evidenced by his Maker's, Fernet, and pear brandy concoction that is an off-menu masterpiece) and one part comfort food bar.  I love Manhattans and Sazeracs, and the Sazerac led to this unnamed concoction, (featured on said Zane Lamprey TV show above) and then that led to another.  And that led to tot-chos to soak up some of that booze and buy me some time before we had to head home.  The lady had the jalape\u00f1o margarita, and then a pink grapefruit martini (?) - my memory may or may not be hazy at this point, but I do believe she had a couple of these as well.  The crew next to us was lazily sipping away at a few bottles of Miller High Life, so you can just chill here and have a few cheap beers during happy hour too.\n\nIt's probably my favorite watering hole in the area - whether you're in the mood for a 40 in a bag and a prophylactic, a killer Sazerac, Fernet and Maker's on tap, or you're already buzzed and coming for some grub, Bullitt would even lure the great Steve McQueen to the 'hood.", "author": "Joe B."}

This place is the bomb dot com, and you're truly missing out on SF's bar scene if you've never been here. I love Bullitt with all my heart for a variety of reasons:\n\n1) It's located right near a bunch of other barts right on Polk Street (Greens Sports, Rouge, the Buccaneer, Tonic, etc) - awesome location and is convenient if you live in the Polk St area!\n2) Bartenders are super nice and so much fun. \n3) It's one of the only casual bars in SF that plays EDM (the bartender/DJ is awesome - I requested Kaskade and Dada Life and he gladly agreed to my request)\n4) The drinks are reasonably priced and there is Makers on tap! So rad. I've never seen this before.\n5) The food is amazing - some nights (I think Tuesdays) are $5 for the entire menu all night. My favorite item on the menu is the mac n cheese, hands down. You have to get it -- it'll melt in your mouth. It's oozing with cheesy goodness... it's clearly a recipe for a heart attack but it's just so freaking amazing. \n6) A hidden gem here is the upstairs room. I had two of my birthday parties here - you just have to pay a flat fee to rent it out ahead of time and they'll have a bartender up there. It's super fun and can hold about 40-50 people easily and it basically feels like a private party!\n7) It's a versatile place. I've come here for happy hour, champagne brunch, dinner, just to go out on weekends, and also after EDM concerts in the city. You can come here for just about any event and you'll always have a great time.\n8) Good crowd. Not douchey.\n\nBullitt does get packed on weekends, but this place is truly so much fun and by far my favorite place in the city and my go-to on a weekly (and sometimes daily) basis. I love you Bullitt!", "author": "Priya G."}

After not visiting for a while I was surprised to see Bullitt in its place. Slightly skeptical but still hopeful, I meandered in with Phil H. for some drinks and grub. \n\nWe sat down at a community table where others were already dining. The dude next to me was chowing down on what appeared to be tater tots smothered in cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. \"What is THAT?!\" I asked him, completely awe struck. They were tot-chos, like nachos, but tot-chos. I almost fell out of my chair with excitement. \n\nI ordered the turkey burger with a side of tot-chos. As soon as it arrived I gorged myself on the tots, took a few bites of my burger, and was epically full in what seemed like seconds. Disappointed that I couldn't get the last few bites of cheesy, potato-y goodness down my stomach, I resigned myself to finishing off my blackberry-somethin' cocktail, and sat there in a fuzzy food coma.

I was immediately in love when I read through their menu: tater tot bar, grilled cheese bar, mac & cheese bar and a burger menu to die for. You can order a regular burger, a bison burger, chicken or a veggie burger (my choice) and choose 1 of 15 or so ways to have it doctored up. When our food arrived, I was not disappointed. On my first visit, I ended up with the veggie burger and a side of sweet potato tater tots (great all the way around!) and my second run-in with Bullitt brought me face-to-face with an Italian-style grilled cheese that has made me a grown-up grilled cheese convert. Grilled basil, mozzarella and tomato with a side of tomato soup? What's not to like?! \n\nI've been with people that have had the bison burger, regular burger (done up a few different ways), salads, fries, tater tots, tot-chos (tater tots prepared like nachos) and everyone has been more than happy when we've departed. The best part is that it's soooo reasonably priced. You can grab a meal for around $10 (if that)! The drinks are also great and for anyone that's interested, they have Maker's Mark and Fernet on tap!

Most of what makes it an ideal watering hole has already been noted within other reviews.  You could humor me and read on anyway.\n\nThe food is delicious and not for the overly health-conscious. I crave the truffle tater tots and the mac & cheese with mushrooms and meat whenever I'm there, so I do my best to arrive with a half-empty stomach.  One night that I was there, the kitchen was completely out of tater tots, and I had one drink too many as a consequence. \n\nThe bartenders are fun to watch, and their pours seem to be on the slightly heavy side (to me).  I believe that during the last few times I've been here, the same music playlist was playing.  The music goes well with the scene on the bartender side of the bar.  It's like a choreographed scene put to music, as the bartenders move with efficiency from one end of the bar to the other, pull bottles off the shelves, pour, shake, pour, spritz... \n\nNow for the best thing about this place... Even on Tuesday nights, it is crawling with eye-candy for women.  It is a bad choice of spots for a first date with a man who is not, let's just say, a part of the \"elite\" groups of male hotties and cuties that you can find here.  They arrive in clusters, and once the cluster has picked a spot in the place to occupy, the eye-contact game is on.\n\nA guy friend of mine call this place a \"Todd & Amy\" bar.

The waitresses saw me, in fact I felt a little intimidated by the stink eye I received from across the room. One even passed me a few times and cleaned up a table that customers had just left. So I continued to stand there for a few minutes, hoping one of them would get the hint that I needed help but they seemed more concerned with talking to a friend sitting at the bar. \n\nEventually I took a seat at the bar and the bartender immediately took my order. He was extremely helpful and very nice! In fact another bartender who came in a few minutes later also asked if I needed help! Eventually my food arrived, hot and ready to go in a nice plastic bag to help me carry it. \n\nI love their burgers and fries.

That would be some expensive lip balm or his lips would have to be mushrooms.  Perhaps that wouldn't be such a great idea.  I did find the tots to be a little less crisp than I like.\n\nSome warnings: this place is slender, so it can get a little crowded to eat at when it is fancying itself as more of a bar than a restaurant.  However, when drinking, why would you not want to be where Tots can easily be delivered to your mouth?", "author": "Jeremy G."}

I mean Bullitt still defines car chases, and being shot around Russian Hill, well any San Franciscan has a duty to show some respect (http://www.rjsmith.com/bullitt-locations.html). \n\nSo going in this week, I was a bit underwhelmed. There wasn't really any sense of time or place here, nor any real homage to the movies. Well, the menu had a pretty fun burger list, with each type named after a film, but really that's not much to go on.\n\nThis isn't really Bullitt's fault, I guess, but then again I know if I ran a bar I'd believe in a concept and hold fast. There are no less than five plasma TVs plastered around the area, so you just can't miss whatever sports game is on. Trouble is, if you're looking for style and ambiance, you're perhaps hoping for cool films to be shown. Something to honor and indicate why Bullitt matters, at least. \n\nOn the positive, they have an honest-to-goodness Fernet tap, which is unheard of, I think, and kind of douchey in a good way. They also have perhaps the best - and I am being serious here - mozzarella sticks in town. I don't know they put in the breading, and maybe it's a higher grade of cheese, but I could have eaten the entire plate of them. The communal closeness of all the tables is also fun, especially when you get to watch dudes in suits try and flirt with the girls at the next table (\"Yeah, I work at Chuck Schwab. I can pull some.\") \n\nWould Frank Bullitt hang out here? Probably not.

SO MUCH FOOD! And yummy! Great staff too! Such a bummer that the deal sold out so fast...would've loved to make it another time perhaps with another circle of friends. I will definitely be on the lookout for other offers...and even drop in without a deal if in the 'hood.  This space is terrific for all sorts of folks. (Have to admit...I was expecting it to be a little douchier based on the macho presentation it got on Thrillist) \nI'd suggest a smaller size on the tots for that deal though. The platters of tots were a tad overwhelming. I would've liked to sample more of the available flavors since they all sound so awesome.

I had promised I'd take le chez, however, due to extreme lagging and it expiring on 12/31, i took along the phuse120 and hoots mcgoots.  I had never heard of Bullitt and was expecting a sit-in restaurant.  Instead, because it was on a Thursday, I arrived to a packed bar.  It was so packed that we were only able to get seating outside.  There were three of us but only seating for two so took turns sitting.  However, a party leaving inside kindly notified us when they were about to leave.  I was expecting a gourmet burger, however, adjusted my scale to rate barfood.  I ordered the Dr. Strangelove which was jack, bacon and chipotle ranch along with a side of totchos and a burbon on the rocks.  We also ordered endless truffle tots.  Our waitress was very nice, however, due to bar being at maximum capacity, felt a little pressured in ordering as she was over our backs waiting.  So pressured that they, being bourbon noobs, were unable to come up with a drink and instead, stuttered something that wasn't burbon at all.  The waitress did not even charge us for our blunders.  The place was very jolly with the adjacent table, who also had the group-on, were downing as much bourbon as they could as the deal ended at 7 p.m. \n\nThe food arrived fairly quickly and served as the perfect complement to Ricky Rubio's coming out party on TNT against the Heat.  My burger was delicious, full of grease and fat, and the slightly burned/charred patty brought that feel good bar food feeling.  When you eat at a bar, it is less for the actual taste then just filling your stomach.  However, the totchos stole the show.  They are basically nacho tots, drenched in cheeses, picca de gallo, guac and sour cream.  It was so damn savory.  My friends enjoyed their food thoroughly and I was able to try their mac-n-cheese, also fucken money.  The truffle tots tasted no different than safeway freezer tots and in many ways, are the perfect bar food, more so than peanuts.  Whether you dip them in ranch or ketchup, there is no incorrect way of eating them.  After we scarfed down our truffle tots, we ordered another batch of sweet potato tots.  These tasted kinda strange.  They were heavy and they came with a side of that sauce you get when you order a King of Thai #31.  Our waitress was very patient and timely with the food and drinks and despite how busy it was, was able to shoot the shit with us in all things RUBIO.", "author": "Brian V."}

The party itself was great--cool people, ring pops all over the tables (I'm a big fan), but a couple things caught my attention. There was a bar upstairs, but I guess the bartender left for a while when I got there. I hadn't seen the bartender at all while I was there so I was wondering if there even was one. In my hazy state, after waiting for about 5-10 minutes for someone to come back, I just took one of the display beers off of the bar. Whoops! Not my finest of moments or decisions...sorry Bullitt! I'll hit you back for that soon! Anyway, the music was pretty good but one of the speakers in the room we were in went a little nuts and was buzzing, too loud, and just terrible. I think my ears are still ringing from that. Eventually it got fixed and after hanging out upstairs a bit longer, I ventured downstairs. All of a sudden, there were napkins flying everywhere, the music was bumping, it was insanely packed, you couldn't avoid being pushed, the energy was great, everybody was dancing, drinking 40's and having a good time!

Basically, everybody has to squeeze through a meat grinder to get in and out of the place.  I suppose that's an attraction for the more handsy people looking for a freebie.  \n\nWe returned at 10pm after grabbing some fro-yo down the street at Tuttimelon and the place was really rocking.  The British Open was on the big TV, a surprise for a sports bar.  Some odd golf fans came in with Argyle sweats and sucking on a ghetto-looking 40 in a paper bag.  Anyways, our party was at a reserved room upstairs, which was a very good thing.  But, to reach it, we had to go through a labyrinth of ATMs, bathrooms with annoyed ladies waiting outside, and some tight stairs.  \n\nThe upstairs space seemed nice if not small.  It fit about 20 of us standing up and there were some modern looking lamps.  $4 beers, not too bad for a cozy and private function in SF.

By chance, I ran into some friends that convinced me to step into the place after I had just completed ordering burgers from Polkers.\n\nThe previous place, Bar Johnny, did not impress me as a great dining experience after a less then filling brunch episode. And I was thinking it was just a re-branding to get people to check out the \"newest thing.\" So, I was hesitant at first to order from the Bullitt menu, especially as I just ordered some burger from across the street.\n\nWOW! Was I wrong. The Bullitt burger menu is really good. I ordered the mushroom swiss beef burger with a side of steamed veggies. The veggies were for my wife, as I pilfered tater tots and jalapeno poppers from my friends to accompany my burger.\n\nI don't know if any of you have had bad beef burger experiences, where the meat can taste putrid. IF you have, you know how it will cancel any future plans of visiting the restaurant. That was not the case with Bullitt.\n\nThe burger I had at Bullitt was the freshest beef burger experience I've had since going to The Supper Club in the late 90's. It brought back memories of my grandmothers burgers and when an establishment can evoke that out of me, you've done a good job.\n\nThe poppers and tots were also fresh. There was no sense that they came from a frozen bag and reheated. The poppers were spicy and the tots had a great crispness to them.\n\nBEER? Yes, I was surprised to see a diverse selection but I guess that can be expected when your owners also run the bar, Tonic, which is further down Polk Street.

I wouldn't even give it one star if Yelp didn't make me...\n\nWe walked quite a distance to check out this bar, based on multiple glowing Yelp reviews and even a great recommendation from the friend we were staying with (we out-of-towners didn't know any better).  We were looking for a good bar with good food.  Not too much to ask for, right?  wrong.  Got all the way there, walked in, couldn't find a seat at a table.  No worries, we sat at the bar with no complaints.  \n\nFirst, the bartender.  Seriously dude, how hard is it to at least FAKE being nice?  You're a bartender, your job is to serve drinks, and you should have known that going into the job.  When we asked for a food and drink menu, he looked at us like we had just killed his puppy.  Wow, sorry for asking!\n\nSo we looked over the food menu for a few minutes, waiting on him to come back to take our order.  Took a while, but he came back.  We ordered two beers, a burger - medium well, two buffalo chicken sliders, and the regular mac and cheese.\n\nMeanwhile, the place starts to get busier.  And busier.  So much so, that my entire right side is squeezed up against a pack of dudes standing around by the bar.  Really?  Please give me at least an inch of space so I can drink my beer and eat my food without you hanging all over me.  \n\nOur food finally comes out and the burger - charred to a crisp!  Not even CLOSE to medium well.  Does their cook know what that means?   The mac and cheese - okay, but pretty bland.  I was expecting more after reading all the reviews.  The sliders - nothing special, and the chicken wasn't tender at all.  By this time I was so frustrated that I couldn't even lift my arm to use my fork because of these jerks next to me.\n\nSo we kept trying to get the bartender's attention so that we could get a beer refill, but he was too busy texting on his phone.  Finally, the second bartender, who didn't have our tab, came over and helped us out instead.\n\nTo top it off, they were blaring this horrible techno mix music that was so loud we could hardly hear each other's voices when trying to have a conversation.\n\nWe paid the bill, literally squeezed our way out of there and sighed with relief once outside.  Terrible experience, and I'm shocked at how many good reviews this place gets.  It might not have been so bad if the service was better, but our bartender quickly pegged us as tourists and didn't care to help us at all.", "author": "Andrea P."}

I have to preface this review is mostly on the bar since I have not eaten there yet. With this in mind, I did see they have a grilled cheese menu, which excites me, more to come with that...\n\nBullitt is like a car in the used dealerships lot. It's shiny, still has that new car smell, comes with all the bells and whistles (whiskey and fernet on tap, 40s in a paper bag... etc), so you think this car is awesome. Then you take it home and the following week have to get new brakes. \n\nIt's on Polk st. but similar to Tonic has a slightly Marina scene... which really doesn't bode well for the barbell/hallway shape of the bar. It gets crowded quick and don't expect anyone to move out of the way so you can meet your friends who have a table in the back. \n\nSaving grace: apparently the upstairs can be rented out for 100 bucks and you can bring your own music and 40 (or was it 30) of your nearest and dearest.. that could be worth another trip!", "author": "Hailey P."}

The tomatoes were inedible, but I guess the real question is why did we order a salad at a bar?  And I don't have an answer.

Small, clean, decent place, located in a stretch of the Russian Hill side of Polk Street featuring numerous other bars and restaurants.  Multiple TV's featuring the Giants game is always positive, and there was ample table and bar space (perhaps the total capacity is around 50 people?).  The drink menu features multiple creative but pricey options in the $10+ range, but I think their best known specialty is the Olde English 800 40oz's which they serve in brown paper bags with condoms- I have been here on maybe 2-3 previous occasions, and it seems like 1/3 of the 20 to 30 something year-old patrons are brown-bagging 8balls each time....They have a limited beer selection, and any local business which doesn't have Anchor Steam on tap is missing something from my perspective....but Sierra Nevada is not a bad alternative.  I have sampled the mozzarella sticks on several occasions, and they are indeed ordinary but yummy, and they had a few other interesting things on the menu including something that looked like tater-tot nachos moving by to another table.  I've had good service at the bar in the past, but not-so-good table service most recently as the waitress seemed more interested in socializing with other patrons like a humanized mobile-Facebook app rather than attending to us until I left our table to order at the bar- at which point she sprinted over to take our order.  In summary, I will probably come back, as this spot is about a 5-block walk from where we live, but by no means would I go out of my way from across town to come here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-07-09", "description": "Indecisive is not the same as indifferent.\n\nI've been in an odd mood as of late. Not all bad per se, just a little off. Maybe its because I just had one of those milestone birthdays. But certain quirks that I may have found amusing not so long ago are now qualities I might consider irksome. In the same vein, qualities I may have not considered in the past are now draws for me. Case in point: Bullitt. \n\nThe first memorable time I popped in there was for a late brunch. When I say late I mean past 2pm. I have a tendency to really lag if I have a Sunday off and I believe we got there around 3 ish. There is a  brunch menu but even if you are a lagger there are a couple brunchy selections offered through later in the day. Upon first glance I was disappointed there was no homage to its namesake. Really nothing? Although I found this a little discouraging we went ahead with our recovery grubbing. Yes, the burgers are super tasty but on my first go around I went the grilled cheese route. These options are not to be missed and come with a cup of tomato soup and mixed greens. While my sandwich could have used more basil, the buttery squishiness of the bread with its thick slab of cheese and tomato were a delicious bit of comforting heaven. My dining companion's burger was so tasty he didn't bother to put it back in its basket after the first bite and the cheese sticks on the side were large the size of large Lincoln logs. Feeling saucy, I ordered the deep fried HoHos....\n\nYes deep fried HoHos....score one for Bullitt\n\nThe next time I popped in was during prime Saturday night bar time. I went with one of my female friends and while the crowd wasn't Hot Mess Marina, it was difficult to maintain conversation without screeching in an ear. Luck of the draw provided us with a sweet table but I was perturbed by the group of guys next to us wishing the old man of the group a Happy 26th Birthday while another nearby group bemoaned a 19 year old friend who had just gotten her fake ID taken away and therefore couldn't join them. Throw in the fact that the little Mason jar of Sierra Nevada I got was $5.50 (making me instantly wish I had ordered a Guinness instead) and I wasn't exactly thrilled. The taps of Maker's Mark and Fernet were a welcome sight if I were still more of a liquor drinker. The 40oz in the brown bag with condom? Hmm....there's a fine line between kitschy and douchey and I applaud those who dare tread the line. However, I also know that I can recreate this $9 purchase for $2.25 down the road and get the condom for free.  \n\nNext time I ventured in was for a fairly large sporting event in the middle of the week and a burger. My partner in crime for the Saturday night excursion once again met me here as we settled in for a game and gossip.This time the crowd was a healthy mix of Upper Polk and blue collar men all gathering for the same. My burger, the Dr. Strangelove, was juicy slab of meat, goopy love at first bite. My dining/ drinking companion helped me polish off the pile of crunchy tater tots riding shotgun with my burger as we played catch up. Once again the crowd, though not engaging in inner group mingling, happily coexisted and shared the comfy space. Also on a happy note, there is hardly a bad seat in Bullitt for sports watching which will make this place even more of a destination for football season. Still the service was mixed in terms of quality adding to my quandry of what sort of star rating to go with.\n\nYeah a three feels right. Perfect enough to be indecisive but not enough to say I'm indifferent.", "author": "Veronica G."}

WTF!\n\nBesides that Bullitt is a work in progress when it comes to space, service and onion rings. Space is from the old Bar Johnny so you either sit at the bar or high table tops. Hopefully they get some new furniture in, felt rather cramped in the bar. Place is self seating and on a busy Saturday night a table was easy to find. Service was OK but very slow at times. And when we asked for napkins for a group of us we got one napkin. One napkin? For people eating burgers with BBQ oozing out the sides just leave a napkin dispenser. Menu setup is nice. Pick your meat of either beer of bison. And then the style of sandwich. Tons of great choices using everything from bacon to sprouts to prosciutto. Burgers were tasty and their medium is on the rarer side. Wide variety of side choices but be wary when picking onion rings you get a whole three of them. Not asking for them to rain from the heavens. But do not skimp on the onion rings. 5 is acceptable number but 3 is not!\n\nHope the kinks or whatever gets worked out here since this place needs to find its identity and really get rid of the $9 40oz.

The dressing wasn't that wonderful. I'll stick to Taters everytime. This place is popular and gets pretty busy so it does take a while to flag down your waitress for a check. All around - I love it!", "author": "Shana H."}

Little did I know when I got there they have an entire section on their menu dedicated to tater tots!  And another one for macaroni and cheese, and yet another for grilled cheese sandwiches.  My personal heaven!  And, there's plenty more food as well.  The tater tots were amazing, mac and cheese was ok, not super flavorful, and after that, I had no room for anything else.  I'm not thrilled with the beer selection, on tap there was just a few, and the only good one, to me, was Sierra Nevada.  There wasn't too much bottled either.  But, the cocktail collection is impressive, and next time I'll have to try one of their signature cocktails.  The actual place is cool, not huge, but big enough if you're able to grab a spot.  You can see the TV's from any spot in the bar.  The wait staff and bartenders are all really nice and attentive.  There is music playing at a good volume, not so loud that you can't talk or think.  Overall, great place, I'll definitely be back.", "author": "Stephanie J."}

We came here for brunch after the Union Street festival and were ready to get some grub on which they did not disappoint.  We had tater tots with blue cheese and bacon - to which I tried to secretly lick the plate when my friends weren't watching.  We also did the appetizer platter with portabello sticks (amazing!), hot wings (emphasize on hot and spicy) and the mac and cheese (creamy goodness).  We also did sliders while trying to fix our wrecked bellies with some protein - the ones with the bacon and onion rings are to die for.  So the food was amazing . . . .however the server was not.  After being told we couldn't do bottomless mimosas because \"they were running low on champagne\", the mimosas that we did get were basically oj with a tiny splash to give it a little fizz.  One of my friends complained because it very obviously was almost completely alcohol free and had to go up to the bar to deal with it.", "author": "Arica V."}

Not because the bartenders and the rest of the staff weren't nice...no, that's not it at all, they were all friendly and helpful with the service, which I greatly appreciated.  However, no amount of customer service can overcome my experience there last night!  This place was INSANELY packed...not sure if it's always like that or if it's because there was a Polk St. Pub Crawl earlier on that day, but it was absolutely ridiculous!  Don't you have a door man there so they can regulate the number of people there!!!!  I'm not a big fan of SUUUPPPPEERRRR crowded places, but I'll tell you why.....because weird, nasty, inappropriate, disrespectful guys like the ones there last night try to touch you in places that are NOT appropriate all because it's too crowded to see who did it!!!  I was absolutely appalled at what happened to me last night.  I mean, I get it, it's crowded, you accidentally touch my ass I get it, whatever.  Last night, I seriously wish my private area was a Venus Fly Trap so I could've caught the Beef Head who was so inappropriate!  GROSS!!!  Needless to say, my girlfriends and I exited the establishment immediately and went to bar next door....less crowded.  Moral of the story, I don't want or have the need to go somewhere with a 9-1 ratio of men to women, especially when the guys behave the way they do there.", "author": "Ashley J."}

Other than that the place is too small to accommodate the marina crowd that has spilled over on to Polk street, it gets super hot and you basically end up standing on people's tables and tripping over everyone to get a drink. It's a recipe for freaking out on a bad night and more than a little annoying on a good night.", "author": "Caedmon P."}
