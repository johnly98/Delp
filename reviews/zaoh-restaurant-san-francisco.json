I use to go often but the prices almost doubled. Lunch use to cost on average $8.00, now $14.00. I get it cost of rent and health care for employees, prices need to go up. Good friendly service.\nFood is good portions size but sushi rolls have gotten smaller. But looks and taste fresh so that's a big . Tempura Udon is my favorite, beautiful bowl of warm goodness. \nBang for ur buck? kinda sorta. Nice place to get ur Japanese craving cured, but prepare to pay the Samurai.", "author": "M I."}

I am not a fan of the \"everything-and-the-kitchen-sink\" rolls, where it is impossible to tell how fresh the fish is. I like the taste of raw fish. I like large pieces of beautifully cut, super fresh sashimi and Zaoh does this well.\n\nAs far as I can tell Zaoh pretty much gets its fish daily. Their portion used to be larger. They scaled back a little about 6 months ago, but they are still good value.\n\nI eat a small amount of sushi pretty much every day.  I'll even occasionally eat sushi for breakfast. If fish oil is good for you I figure I might as well get it from the source. At my age, mercury poisoning's impact on young brain development from eating too much fish is the least of my worries.\n\nZaoh is one of my favorites because of consistent quality.  A solid 4 stars for me.", "author": "David T."}

The miso soup tasted like it was instant. The gyozas were similar to the ones at Trader Joe's. The 4 sushi rolls that we had were ok, but they only gave us 3 packets of soy sauce and included utensils for 4 people. \n\nAlso- this is the last time that I'm ordering from Eat 24. Most of the restaurants on there are terrible, and so is their service. They NEVER pay attention to special request.

The lady that delivered was nice and quick, so my Chicken Udon was still piping hot when it arrived. But it was a Saturday, so I'm thinking that not very many offices are open to order from a restaurant in the SoMa district.\n\nThe udon and broccoli were a little soft. But the chicken was great - it was super hot and soft. It wasn't softy and the soup didn't make me extra thirsty, like some soups normally do.\n\nThe Yakitori Side Dish was chicken and that was delicious with it's sauce as well. There was so much sauce that I ordered a side of brown rice so I could mix it into the sauce, which turned out great too. The chicken was tender and tightly compacted onto the skewer, so it was a bit of a challenge to get it off the skewers at first, but still good.\n\nThe Unagi Hand Roll wasn't my favorite and there were little bones still in the unagi, which was unpleasant. Not too big of a deal, but I wouldn't order it again.\n\nI'll definitely order again very soon - especially once I'm allowed to eat sushi again.", "author": "Athena C."}

Normally it is delicious.   \n\nWhen I ordered it today, it was a completely different dish with no rice, no seaweed and a crab that was way too mature to be considered a soft shell crab.  It was hacked into a million pieces to make it look bigger than it was so as to justify the price.  But in short, it was a terrible tasting and looking dish and nothing like what I have eaten dozens of times before.  \n\nI told the waitress that I was not pleased with my roll and that I would like to return it and order something else.  She looked at me like I was from Mars.  Then she said she had to talk to the manager to see if I could return it and order something else.  I was dumbfounded with her reply.\n\nThen the cook came over (he tried to call himself the chef but he must have been hallucinating).  I explained to him that I did not like the taste of the crab and that I would like to return it and order something else.  This cook then grabbed my plate and started playing with the pieces of crab with his bare hands. He was squeezing the nasty little fried pieces while insisting that it was fresh.  I replied it did not matter if it was fresh if I did not like it.  He stated \"I AM THE CHEF\" and then threatened me with \"I don't care if you don't like it, you will pay for it.\"  I told him that I would not pay for it, especially since he just played with my food with his bare hands.  I asked him why he was arguing with a customer for not enjoying a plate.  He continued to rant and then told me if I didn't pay for the crab, he would call 911.  I invited him to do so.  The coward never did.\n\nBut the restaurant did have the audacity to still charge me for the soft shell crab even though it had been fingered by the cowardly cook and actually taken away from the table so that even if I had wanted to eat it (I shutter and try not to hurl at that thought), I wouldn't have been able to.  \n\nI paid for the food that was eaten and left.  I did not pay for the crab.  No tip of course.  The two indentured servants (aka the poor waitresses working for the cowardly a-hole) followed me out of the restaurant, demanding that I pay for the crab.  I responded that I would not pay and they should do what they had to do but I was leaving.  Of course, as the two work for a coward and have learned from a coward, there was nothing done.  \n\nIt's quite amazing to have a restaurant and it's cowardly cook actually tell a customer that they don't care that the customer doesn't like a dish, deny the customer the opportunity to order something else, and then demand that the dish which has been played with by others' bare hands needs to be paid for on top of it.  Mind you, this was a stinkin' $9.50 roll, not a full blown meal.  \n\nPlease do not eat at this restaurant.  People like this should not be serving customers.", "author": "Dyana L."}

They also delivered it over an hour late. The salmon looked like rubber (smelled horrible too) like it had been sitting out for days. There was nothing fresh about this food. I've never gone to such an extent to write a review about a restaurant, nor have I ever had such a bad experience with a restaurant in my 8 years in SF. When I called the restaurant and told them, instead of trying to remedy the situation, they just denied that it happened and claimed we \"had allergies or something.\" I eat sushi 3-4x week, pretty sure I don't have allergies to raw fish (just yours apparently...). After constantly arguing with them on the phone they initially said they would only reimburse me for HALF my order (it was about $100 worth of sushi...). Then when I called back they told me they would only reimburse me a $12 portion of my entire order as they didn't feel like they needed to do more to remedy the situation of sending me shitty stale sushi. These people are pathetic lol DO NOT EAT HERE. It is gross and the customer service is well below the threshold of downright awful. I will do everything in my power to make sure others don't get scammed by these people as they have no idea what they're doing and would prefer people get sick instead, which is what my friend is right now.

And as high-maintenance as this may sound, I prefer to only go to Japanese owned and operated  sushi restaurants (Zaoh is Chinese-owned) like Koo, Kabuto and Okina. However, lunch offerings and good ones at that are VERY scant in the Civic Center area so I find myself at Zaoh once every 1-2 months out of convenience. I've probably dined and got take-out a total of 10-12 times with my most recent visit today for take-out. \n\nI'll keep this review short and simple:\n\nP R O S:\n*SOLID BENTO BOXES (2 items - $10.95): My go to is the chicken teriyaki and shrimp tempura/veggies. The chicken teriyaki is tender, savory, sweet and smoky and the tempura is lightly and crisp.\n\n*Friendly service\n\n*Food is ready within 10 minutes\n\n*Free Delivery with a $15 minimum\n\nC O N S:\n*MEDIOCRE SUSHI: Fish isn't very fresh (well to my standards that is) and the sushi rice lacks a sticky consistency and crumbles. Fyi, I ordered the Dragon Roll ($12) today and the shrimp tempura was mushy, the rice fell apart when I picked it with chopsticks and was slathered with Kabayaki sauce (sweet soy glaze) which made it overwhelmingly sweet.\n\n*Sketchy Area (If it weren't for all the city and government employees walking around the area during lunch, I would not come here.)\n\nIf you're looking for more refined and authentic Japanese dishes and sushi in the area, pay a visit to O-Toro Sushi (they also have Izakaya) in Hayes Valley, a 5 minute walk from Zaoh.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-12-18", "description": "I must've ordered for delivery on an off day because my order came almost TWO HOURS after I had ordered. I was notified through Eat24 that the estimated time of delivery was 45-60 minutes. I wasn't quite pleased with that but shrugged it off and went about with my work (ordered for lunch). I specifically asked for them to call me once they get to the parking lot of the address I had provided so that I could meet the delivery guy outside.\n\n45 minutes rolled by. Nothing. Okay.. It did say 45-60 minutes..\n\n60 minutes on the dot. I am impatient at this point. I call up the restaurant only to be told the driver has left a looooonnngggg time ago. Okay, he must be on his way. I try to be understanding. Maybe there are other deliveries before me.\n\nAn hour and 30 fucking minutes later, still nothing! Furious, I call them again and receive the same answer, but promised to call the driver to ask what's taking so long.\n\nA few minutes later, my phone rings. It is the driver, telling me he's outside. About fucking time. He asked for my name and handed me the bag of food, turned his back and walked out of the parking lot. No apologies, no nothing. I am appalled.\n\nFor the amount of time I had to wait for my damn food, I would've expected the wait to be worth it. WRONG.\n\nI ordered the chicken teriyaki ramen with a side order of a spicy tuna roll (to make it so my order was over $15 to qualify for a free delivery). My soup was still HOT so you can bet 50 fucking bucks they left not minutes after my last angry phone call. I am pretty sure you can't call this shit ramen. The soup is so bland and tasteless, you'd think I ordered some kind of broth that chicken was boiled in, sans the spices and seasonings. The noodles? God, don't even ask about the damn noodles. And what kind of ramen has carrots and broccoli? Unedible af. The spicy tuna roll, which had a cute little orange star next to it at the menu page that made you believe it's gonna be one of the best sushi ever, ended up to be one of the most shittiest I've had. The rice was dry and all I really tasted was the spicy sauce. No traces of tuna anywhere. I have absolutely no idea why people raved about it. It certainly did not deserve that star icon next to it. The chicken teriyaki looked like it's been cooked a few days before and soaked in teriyaki sauce. Probably just reheated in the microwave before scooping that shit into their little to-go boxes.\n\nI know this is a Chinese-run Japanese restaurant, but they clearly made no effort whatsoever to make it remotely taste like I was actually eating Japanese food. I really wanted to like this place but after this fiasco, best believe I won't even be laying my eyes on this restaurant's name. Thank you and goodbye.", "author": "Michelle B."}

That's nice...except for when I tripped down the ramp in the back of the restaurant!  I fell HARD on my shin and was in excruciating pain!!  I was also deeply embarrassed and blocking the hallway for other patrons.  The staff could've cared less about me being completely in the way...they immediately came to my assistance, got me a big bag of ice for my wound, as well as a glass of water.  They checked in on me constantly, even though I had a friend who was sitting with me and attending to me.  That was REALLY nice and beyond the call of duty.  And they helped me up and out when my ride got there!  \n\nAside from the beyond-the-call service, the food was very tasty!  I didn't order anything too novel (shrimp and veg tempura, rock'n'roll, sake nigiri, etc.), but it was delicious, arrived to the table in a timely fashion, and didn't set me back too much cash.  I will definitely be back to try more sushi, probably some more nigiri, sashimi!  If you're in this part of town and looking for a good, simple Japanese meal, this is your spot!

I ordered mine vegetarian, and not tempura-ed, since I was combatting illness (remember?). I was surprised to find it filled with soft, rectangular strips of lackluster tofu. Which I didn't eat. The other veggies didn't taste as fresh but were, again, saved by the onion. I finished my udon strategically by pairing each bite with a piece of onion. \n\nAnd then suddenly my skeptical brain had to do a 180 when the sweetest server in the world told me they added the tofu SPECIALLY for me.

Literally.\n\nA little while back - I was trying to find a downtown spot that would deliver a note-worthy spread of food for a medium sized group, in the downtown area - around 7:00pm at night.\n\nMost downtown eateries that typically deliver - are closed at night. Or need days notice to deliver.\n\nNot Zaoh. I called the night before, to see if they could put together a spread for about 20 or so people. The man helping me on the phone was extremely helpful and personable. He said that if I placed my order by early afternoon the next day - that they would have it delivered to our destination later on that night- no problem.\n\nAnd so with a modest budget - I asked the man on the phone to work within our financial constraints and put together a big spread of food for a group of over 20 people. He asked what I wanted specifically - and trusting the sound of his voice - I said that it would be great if he could just put together a nice mixture of rolls, including sushi and veggie,  and to be sure to include some of his favorites. I also ordered a large sized seaweed salad, and a big serving of edamame. \n\nAt just a little before 7, I got a phone call from Zaoh  - saying the food was on it's way. A delivery car pulled up promptly.\n\nA friendly young man emerged from the vehicle, carrying two heavy large wooden boat displays of wowing looking sushi rolls - with ornate leaf shaped wasabi and delicately arranged ginger. \n\nThere was everything from crab rolls, to spicy tuna rolls, to veggie tempura rolls, to cucumber and avocado rolls, and a vast array of other delicious rolls as well. The presentation was beautiful and unexpected.\n\nThe rolls were a big success - though the fish, crab, and eel ones - were far more popular than their veggie counterparts. \n\nThe following day - the same delivery gentleman swung by to pick up the unique looking wooden presentation boats.\n\nFor the price, portion, presentation, convenience, and reliability of this place - I would recommend Zaoh for a casual-downtown-delivery- group-catered lunch or dinner option.\n\nWhile their food is far from spectacular - everyone who feasted upon the rolls that night seemed more than pleased, and plenty of photographs were taken of the unique and impressive spread.\n\nThanks Zaoh - for pulling through.\n\nTrust.", "author": "Jessica T."}

You do go for great menu options, plenty of choices for vegetarians, raw fish enthusiasts and those who prefer cooked items. Saki was lovely, as was my seafood yosenabe. My dining companions enjoyed the asparagus tempura and yellowtail teriyaki, though the fish wasn't as fresh as it could've been. Prices were amazingly reasonable and portions were generous.

The first time I went, I got the sashimi bento box.  I asked if I could have half white tuna ($9.95) & red tuna ($11.95).  No problem.  I got charged for the less expensive price.  What an awesome place!!\n\nSo I thought.\n\nThe second time I went, I got the sashimi bento box.  I asked if I could have half white tuna ($9.95) & red tuna ($11.95).  The woman gave me grief.  I told her that I was allowed to do it last time.  My friend who had been there with me the last time said, \"It's true.  I am a witness.\"  That part was hilarious, actually.  The woman finally said, okay, & charged me $ 9.95 (lower price).  Alright.  Still pleasant but already feeling the inconsistency.\n\nThe third time I went, I got the sashimi bento box.  This time, I thought, good grief, I'm just going to make it less complicated.  Maybe it's because the white tuna is $ 9.95 & the red tuna is $ 11.95.  That makes sense.  I would've been totally okay with getting charged the more expensive price both times before.  That seems fair & reasonable.\n\nSo I look under the $ 11.95 category & I notice that there's the red tuna for $ 11.95 and salmon for $ 11.95.  Nice.  I ask for half & half.  No problem.  \n\nThe bill comes.  $ 13.95.  What the hell????\n\nHow did practically the same exact meal come to $ 4 more?  Where in the menu does it say $ 13.95??\n\nI ask the server.  He says that they charge $2 for half & half.  I said, that makes no sense.  The red tuna & the salmon are the same price!  Plus, I never got charged before.\n\nHe has the audacity to say, \"I don't think so.\"\n\nLike I was lying.  \n\nBut, I mean, c'mon.  $ 9.95 & $ 13.95 is a pretty big difference.  $ 4 pays for gas or tip or the bridge toll.  \n\nI asked, \"I wouldn't have ordered half & half if I knew you charged $ 2 extra.  Where exactly does it say that you charge $ 2 extra in the menu?\"\n\n\"It doesn't.  I'm the one that is supposed to tell you.\"\n\n\"But you didn't.\"\n\n\"No, I forgot.  That was my fault. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Sooooo.....  will you take the extra amount off\" (DUH, right?  Like I'm a freakin' mind reader.  The dude ADMITTED he made a mistake.  I deserve a refund. Easy fix it.)\n\n\"I can't do that.\"\n\nI swear to God that's what he said.  He said he wouldn't take it off.  At that point I'm embarrassed because I'm with friends & I appear now like some cheap bastard not willing to pay the $2 extra.  But, really, it's the damn principle.  For one, it's about the inconsistency.  It's like every time I go there, the price of my meal is unpredictable.  How stupid is that?  The servers are not all on the same page.  Second, the waiter admitted he was suppose to tell me but he forgot.  I totally don't get it.  It's just so illogical & absurd to me.  It's not on the damn menu!!!!!!!!!!!!  \n\nIf they think that it's not a big deal to just like randomly charge me $2, then it shouldn't be a big deal to take that amount off.  \n\nHe didn't get a tip.  I mean, OBVIOUSLY.\n\n& I'm disappointed because I thought I'd found a regular sushi joint.  It's convenient because of its proximity.  But I can't see myself going back.  & if I do, I of course have learned my lesson to A. not order half & half and B. ask the total before committing to an order.\n\nThe one thing that I do like a lot about this place are separate checks.", "author": "Yelper Y."}

I had been avoiding this place for the longest, thinking that I've been to better Japanese spots. Today, I had a craving specifically for tempura. I went solo for a late lunch, 3pmish, and there were 3 other people there. I was greeted and seated immediately. I was given hot green tea and bean sprouts. I'm not a fan of bean sprouts, so I didn't touch them. I ended up ordering a Combo plate with shrimp tempura and salmon sashimi. The miso soup had other vegetables in it, which I'm not used to, but it was fine. I usually eat the packet type. The salmon was amazing, melted like butter. The tempura was pretty perfect too. There was a mound of rice and a white radish like salad (sorry, I don't know what it's called) that had a mayonnaise-y dressing. I'm completely stuffed and satisfied. Thanks Zaoh...I'll be back :)", "author": "Mary C."}

The rolls I had were bland at best and reminded me of chewing on rubber balls more than fresh fish.  Not that I've chewed a lot of rubber balls in my day, but its an experience not easily forgotten.  The sesame chicken is identical to the teriyaki chicken except it has some seeds poured atop.  When my coworker opened the box and saw his chicken bento box lunch, his precise words were:\n\n\"Yowser!  By mine own eye I do decry\nthe quality of this meal.\nThe fat so oily yet meat bone-dry\nmine disgust I shan't conceal.\nFair Mari I blame thee not\nfor this tragedy is not yours;\nthis terrible meal we have bought\nis covered in nasty spores.\"\n\nOk.  So no, he didn't say it quite like that.  It was more like, \"Wow, this is some lowwwwwwww quality meat.\"  And no, there weren't any bacterial spores, either.  Allow me my artistic license, dammit.\n\nAnyway, the lady on the phone barely spoke English and {unsurprisingly} I receive roughly double the nasty things I had ordered.  You know its a bad sign when people won't eat the free food that has just arrived.\n\nOK, OLD REVIEW:\nThe sushi I've had here wasn't mind-blowing... the rice was a little on the gooey side and the fish wasn't that flavorful.  It was fine, and priced low enough so that I didn't mind.  I've had a few rolls and some side dishes, including a halved avocado filled with spicy chunks of maguro.  Mmmmmm, what a wonderful idea!  The seaweed salad was also quite good and a generous portion.\n\nI would give this place 3 stars based on flavor alone, however the relatively affordable prices and delivery service bump it up a notch.", "author": "Mari C."}

The quality was equivalent to the pre-packed super market stuff.  I guess I shouldn't expect much for $8.50.  The miso soup did not taste like miso soup, had an overpowering carrot taste. The so-called miso soup had the same flavor as the soups that generally accompanies the lunch plates at the Chinese restuarants.

Today I rummaged through the take out menu drawer at work and found Zaoh's menu.  I'm a little reluctant about any Japanese delivery since Japanese food tends not to be deliverable.  There aren't many Japanese delivery places and the places who do offer delivery also have Chinese food on the flip side of the menu.  Hmmmm that seems a little suspect.  Anyway back to the magic eight ball.  So as soon as I glanced through the menu taking particular notice of their large selection of vege rolls and before I  decided to blindly call in my order, I checked with my magic eight ball(yelp) and to my surprise I noticed fairly good reviews about this place.  Almost everyone seems to say that Zaoh's sushi is \"unremarkable\".  Indeed the service is nice and prices are right.  I really don't have to add anything else.  I got the vege roll, futomaki, ume maki, and bean sprout salad and yes they were all unremarkable but good nonetheless.  However the most remarkable thing about Zaoh is the super speedy delivery.

However, what makes a place a real \"find\" is that it's inexpensive, *and* delicious.  Zaoh was inexpensive, but not that great.  At least I didn't feel like I got ripped off, which is never too much fun.  I also gave it three stars because of the value.", "author": "A A."}

I'm in the Mission, so not too far from SOMA, but I remember a pizza place literally around the corner from my house growing up that still took about fifteen-to-twenty. I was, therefore, rather impressed before I started eating.\n\nAs for the food: I will admit that I'm no sushi connoisseur, but I liked it quite a bit, and it was very reasonably priced compared to what I've seen of sushi pricing (which, as a non-connoisseur, has usually appalled me). I partook of the New Wave, hamachi, and shiitake rolls, and I enjoyed them all.", "author": "Tea B."}

Moshi Moshi was much closer but a little more expensive.\ni moved to the neighborhood 10 years ago and for the first few years always went to Sushi Zone but have given up on that place - the food is superb but the waiting is agony, the last time i went there it was a 4 hour tour to get dinner, waiting/sitting on a wooden beam for an hour and a half while 2 people sat drinking beers at one of the 2 tables.... but that's another story.\nfor the last few years i've been going to We Be Sushi on Valencia for the early bird special, a good deal and decent sushi that fulfills my sushi craving for around $10.  \nthis Halloween eve. hubby and i were returning from a wedding in east bay and wanted sushi, we didn't want to get anywhere near the Castro and wanted to eat near home.  suddenly i remembered Zaoh, we go straight there and the parking gods gave us a spot right in front.  there was no waiting, the waitress/hostess immediately looked familiar, i think she's been there since i first started going.  it was so nice to get a seat right away.  i think their main business is from the lunch crowd so on a wed eve. around 7:30 there were ample tables available.  the food was much better than i remembered.  the miso soup was very tasty, way better than the average miso which is more salt than flavor, this was flavorful and had nice little crispy tofu pieces and seaweed bits. the seaweed salad was a generous portion for 2 and yummy.  \nwe got ama ebi and were very happy they serve the heads, it was delicious, the heads were tempura fried to perfection, crunchy and full of flavor.  we had the soft shell crab roll, and the crab was perfect, warm, crispy on the outside, with a melt in your mouth perfect center.  catapillar roll had a lot of nice, fresh avacado that was 'like buttah' but next time i'll pay 1/2 the price and get rock n' roll.  saba nigiri was fresh and tasty.  maguro nigiri was fine yet 'unremarkable'.  hamachi was fresh and delicous.  hubby gives a demerit point for the rice which is not bad but could use improvement.\nfor dessert we had the mango mochi balls, they taste like the ones we buy at Trader Joes but who cares? they're yummy and the perfect ending to a very good meal.\nthe tab was astoundingly reasonable for a feast of sushi, sake, and dessert.  the service was friendly, attentive and fast - a breath of fresh air in the City.  \ni have lived nearby this place for 10 years now and this is only the second time i've dined here in as many years, not sure why, the last time i had the unagi donburi which was delicious.  Zaoh is back in my restaurant rotation 'greatest hits' from now on.  and reading reviews here i find out they deliver, good to know.\ni give it 5 stars for what it is, reasonably priced fresh and good food. i've been to many Japanese restaurants in the City, you can pay about the same or a whole lot more and get lesser quality.", "author": "aLiSoN m."}

Good quality for low price = great value.

(Moved out of the city 18 years ago) Now that I am back, I decided to try some of the old eating  establishments that I used to frequent.  I was in the area by Zaoh and decided to drop in for lunch with my friend.  I found the food to be fresh and reasonably priced. I know that it is disconcerting to hear Cantonese in a Japanese restaurant, I found that to be the fabric of the restaurant scene in this city-Chinese cooking Italian or Hof Brau style foods, Mexicans cooking Chinese food, etc. The fact of the matter was the food was good at Zaoh.", "author": "Henry H."}

I visited yesterday while I'm in town and discovered how horrible the service  and how salty the food has become. \n\nThe server didn't even ask if we wanted a drink. Had to ask for a spoon because they just handed the miso soup and left. Very inattentive waitstaff. \n\nThey only paid attention when I was about to leave and sign the bill.\n\nCrappy service. Bad food. Will not visit again.\n\nI miss the place it was two years ago, with great food and service.", "author": "poing p."}

However, I recently discovered that they overcharge on delivery orders so just be careful if you are getting food delivered.  One a $50 party tray of rolls, we were overcharged $4.  At first, I thought I miscalculated but my coworker mentioned that she ordered a couple of lunch combos and felt she was overcharged $1 and change.  Recently, we ordered a lunch combo and some rolls. I asked the lady on the phone to calculate the total for me.  She did and I mentioned that she may have miscalculated.  She stuttered and said to let her calculate again.  She said something about how she may have miscalculated the tax and then agreed with my calculation. Like I said, it's a great lunch spot, but just be wary of what you're charged. Some favorites are Sushi & Sashimi combo, chicken teriyaki and sashimi combo, bean sprout salad and the mango roll.  Enjoy!", "author": "Julie W."}

Any two combination is only $10 and their food is not bad.  It's a small place and it might be a bit crowed if you have a large party during lunch.  Serving is just right to fill your stomach.

Prices are reasonable, although I did spend $18 including tip today, which made me cry a little and I could have eaten another roll.  But that's what you get for eating sushi for lunch I suppose.  The waitresses are very nice, and everything goes really fast.  I usually sit at the bar and eat by myself and the one annoying thing is that almost ALWAYS the other people sitting around me at the bar are talking obnoxiously loud on their cell phone.  C'mon people - this is the one hour of my day where I get to be AWAY from the office and the last thing I want is to sit by 5 other people who are chattering away on their cell.  It is very rude to other customers and to the sushi chefs and waitresses.  Overall, nothing fantastic, but easy and quick.", "author": "Jessica S."}
