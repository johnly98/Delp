Loved the blue fries as complimentary appetizers. We shared the yucca fries, the cheese wontons, and the ceviche and were pretty full!  Would skip the yucca fries- i'm not a fan of how dense they are. The cheese wontons were good! I mean fried cheese- how can you go wrong there. The powdered sugar on the top was interesting and I wasn't a huge fan of the syrup, but liked that guac as a dipping. The ceviche was solid. Got the pisco sour. Tiny drink for the price! But still good.\n\nOverall- a fun place to dine and have a nice dinner.", "author": "Vivian D."}

In terms of drinks, the pisco sour was tasty! But the chicha morada drink (Peruvian blue corn) was lacking in flavor and came from a bottle. For food, we shared 6?tapas style dishes and 1 dessert between the 4 of us. \n\nCeviche (5/5) \nSo juicy! This ceviche consists of large chunks of fish, calamari rings, mussels, and shrimp. Sooo flavorful, one of the best ceviches I've had in a while. The seafood is tender and the portion is generous. \n\nChicharrones style fried chicken (5/5) \nSimilar to Spanish fried chicken-the pieces were small, bite sized but so tender and full of flavor. The batter is not overpowering and the meat to coating ratio is prime. Came with a creamy sauce and a salsa-esque sauce to dip. Would recommend! \n\nMushroom empanadas (3.5/5) \nCame with 2 per order and were pretty large. The mushrooms inside were juicy, but nothing to write home about for the skins. \n\nPaella (4.5/5) \nTasty and a good amount of seafood in it! But this paella was wetter than most I've had (I prefer a little drier). Regardless, the flavors were there and overall a really good dish. \n\nPork belly choufa (3.5/5)\nFried rice with pork belly chunks in a tomato-ey sauce. Flavors were pretty good, but a little too greasy for my taste. Atop the rice there was also a creamy sauce but I think we could've done without. \n\nCalamari relleno (3/5) \nPersonally I think the meat filling should stay in a fried potato ball..not calamari. Still it was an interesting dish to try! Comes in 2 pieces, but I didn't think the flavors were toooo cohesive. \n\nChurros (4.5/5)\nYum!! Comes with 4, Dulce de lece freshly made churros. The hot chocolate seemed like the actual hot chocolate drink, but I was expecting the melted chocolate. A good way to finish off dinner! \n\nOverall, a great place to explore different types of Peruvian (fusion) food! Everything was fun to eat and portions were decently sized.

It's served with 2 dipping sauces - chimichurri and huancaina (a spicy cheese sauce) - both of which were delicious, but I personally preferred the chicken on its own and using the dipping sauces for the fries instead. The cheese sauce was especially addicting. Otherwise, the fries were okay on their own - thick cut with some more crisp than others.

Street parking in the area wasn't too hard to find and it was free. We made reservations via OpenTable for 5:45pm for 7 people and were seated right away. \n\nRotisserie chicken: 4/5. It's $15.50 for half a chicken. It was cooked great, seasoned well and wasn't dry. It also came with two dipping sauces, chimichurri and huancaina, a traditional Peruvian sauce. It also comes with your choice of two sides. Dip the fries in the huancaina suace, it's awesome, especially since that sauce is traditionally served over potatoes. Overall great dish and great value. \n\nChurrasco 1/5: we had really high hopes for this dish but were pretty disappointed. We asked for a medium rare cook and it came out medium. It was way over seasoned to the point were the seasoning was so overwhelming that you could barely taste the chimichurri when you dip the meat. It was also burnt in some spots and overall, too tough and too chewy. The only good thing was the yucca it comes with. \n\nPescado a lo macho 3/5: holy moly the coconut rice this dish comes with is SO good and addicting. The coconut is so pronounced! As for the pescado a lo macho, the sauce was pretty good and comparable to other places I've tried. Had a good consistency and flavor. I did not like the fish filet. It was overcooked and even burnt in spots. The rest of the seafood in the dish was good though. This dish is $21. I get this at my favorite Peruvian restaurant in San Mateo for $14.49. \n\nDessert: The churros were $10 for 4 small pieces. It was good and I like how it was filled with caramel, but definitely not worth $10. If I were you, I would order the panna cotta instead. It was super refreshing, light, and tasty!\n\nService: Our waitress was friendly, helpful, and patient. However, at one point one of the workers propped opened the door that was literally right next to our table. I wasn't sure why because it was freezing and the breeze was blowing directly at us, so I closed it. Then she came back and opened it again, telling me to not close it because other  customers sitting far from the door were feeling warm. So our table had to stay sit there uncomfortably cold. I felt bad for the people who were warm and we were on dessert and going to leave soon, so we just hurried and finished so we could leave.

Reservations recommended.  It was super packed by 7 PM on a Friday.  About the food...\n\nYou MUST GET the Calamari Relleno (calamari stuffed with chorizo and sauce).  OMG, THIS WAS SO GOOD.  This was for sure my favorite dish of the night.\n\nOther dishes we tried included the Papa a la Huancaina (the potatoes were good and the bacon was a nice addition, but there were small pieces of olives in it, and I hate olives.  :c), Pollo a la Brasa w/ fries (YES - the cheese and chimchurri... YES YES YES.  Only thing is that the chicken was a little over cooked for my liking, it was almost too soft, but nonetheless still very tasty), Grilled Asparagus (had a nice spiced seasoning to it and I liked the cheese that came with it, tasty side - recommended!), and as for desserts.... we had the churros & lava cake.  My roommate and I got suckered into it.  They're good at upselling you here, lol.  Churros were tasty but I would've liked them to be crispier and the lava cake was kinda just alright.  The ice cream that came with it was good though.\n\nTo be honest, I guess after actually writing down my review, the food we had was maybe more like a 3.5/3.75 than a 4.

We got the seafood paella and the pollo saltado. The seafood was good but the paella was probably a little too runny for me. I've had a lot better but this is a Peruvian restaurant.. It was like a fusi\u00f3n paella. I'd pass on this. \n\nThe pollo saltado was perfectly flavored! Finally we ended w churros and this was overall very delicious. I'm glad we checked this place out!

Not a fun spot. However, they took over the former Rocketfish space on Potrero Hill about 2-1/2 years ago. I suggested it to Jamie W. since I've been to their sister operation in Walnut Creek, Parada New Peru (review: http://bit.ly/2sn44xW) and thought a little Peruvian would be nice for a change. It was pretty packed on a Thursday evening, and the hostess was the type who gave us small-mouth when she talked while she looked right past us. I hate that.\n\nAnyway, the moment we were seated, we received the bad news that they were out of the $15.50 Pollo a la Brasa. Say what? It was only 7:30PM, and they were out of their signature dish. Damn. We waved the server away as we composed ourselves, all the while munching on the oil-lacquered corn kernels left for us to Hoover (photo: http://bit.ly/2tzDx04). Jamie decided to be the more adventurous one and ordered the $19 Aji de Gallina, which was a shredded chicken breast braised in an aji amarillo sauce which was intensely creamy. It came with diced potatoes, Botija olives, jasmine rice, and half a hard-boiled egg on top (photo: http://bit.ly/2rCXWol). It was tasty comfort food albeit heavy on the carbs.\n\nI ordered the $22 Seafood Paella which put a Peruvian twist on a Spanish favorite by using a saffron-pimento sauce over the bomba rice. Mussels, clams, shrimp, and calamari were mixed in to make it a most seaworthy dish topped with red onions for a bit of crunch (photo: http://bit.ly/2teQRaE). It was also tasty in a starchy, no-frills kind of way and genuinely satisfying. Surprisingly the high point of our meal was the $7 Grilled Asparagus with a creamy aji-style sauce for dipping (photo: http://bit.ly/2tescTP). So I guess we eventually got over our pollo withdrawal, but it took plenty of carbs and cream sauce to do it. We would come back, but I think I'll call ahead to see if poultry is still in da house 'cause I loves me some rotisserie chicken.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...no pollo a la brasa but what we had was hearty, tasty fare\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...crowded and bustling, filled with people eating my chicken\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...hostess was not the mostest but the server was attentive\nTOTAL - 4 stars...good Peruvian is harder to find than you think and this place does it", "author": "Ed U."}

I simply do not want to see anyone, be around anyone. Restaurant like this, they don't make them like this in Asia. \n\nThe dishes are really fantastic. But the cocktails for brunch were better!

After our appetizers we asked if we could move to a different seat at the bar, which was higher, and she rudely said \"yeah sure, sure.\"\n\nThe dinner/actual food here is thoroughly impressive though! It is definitely a little more expensive (average of about $17 a plate), but it is worth it.\n\nWe got started with the ceviche chico which is ceviche with ahi tuna as well as a moscato and a pisco sour. The pisco sour was amazing and I would recommend ordering it as your drink! The ceviche chico was great as well and had a hearty amount of ahi tuna chunks in it.\n\nFollowing that, we ordered a mushroom empanada. Inside the empanada was some cut up steak along with mushroom. The outside was crisped perfectly as well.\n\nOur main entree was the saltado which was this plate that had steak, tomatoes, fries and a side of rice as well.

I would have asked the waiter but we could only get his attention for roughly 5 seconds each interaction and I ended up feeling badly calling him over because he seemed to be in such a rush all of the time. My suggestion would be to slow down and serve your customers completely instead of showing up and barely giving them a chance to speak.\n\nThe front desk staff was also particularly unhelpful - having me sit at the (cold) door while I waited a few min for my friend instead of our table that was already assigned and empty, in a not packed restaurant.

The hostess is not polite here, and the lomo saltado was mediocre. It's $21 yet cooked with frozen potatoes (not freshly sourced as the restaurant menu says). The lomo saltado is also not authentic. It's served with a tomato stew that tastes as if it was made from canned tomatoes. The dish is cooked traditionally on a wok and is of Chinese-Peruvian origin, so although I appreciate inventive twists on a classic, cooking experiments have to land well on the palate to be effective. \n\nTruth be told, the worst quality of this place is that it's overpriced. I thought Limon was expensive, until I saw the $20 ceviches at Mochica. I didn't bother ordering - I'm sure they are tasty, but their service has to improve by ten if they want to charge $20 for a small plate of ceviche. \n\nThe presentation and decor itself are pleasant - better than Fresca, but the quality of the food is not nearly as good.", "author": "Marco H."}

Nothing overwhelming in terms of flavor -- just some white fish with a hint of lemon.\n\n- Yucca fries: again, pretty much exactly what you would expect. Texture-wise, the interior was good in that it avoided the powder trap that most fries fall into.\n\n- Lomo Saltado: really tasty, actually.

Toasted nori, sweet yam, and hominy completed the wave of textures and flavors. I'd recommend their toasted plaintain chips to go with. \n\nMUSHROOM EMPANADA - $9 - Could be a meal in itself since it's a generous portion. Savoriness of the portobellos(?) with the butteriness of the crust was really balanced. I'd get this again. \n\nPAELLA - $20 - Quick version since I was really looking forward to the crunchy socarrat. Average. \n\nPOLLO SALTADO (instead of lomo/beef) - $17 - Maybe if the thick cut fries were crisped to contrast to the chicken it would be more interesting.

So why the two stars?? \n\nOk, so unfortunately we are a bit of a pain in the ass due to a gluten intolerance (no pun intended!!), so asking what is gluten friendly is always an awkward convo with the server at the start of any meal. So he explained our options and ceviche, scallops, a salad, saut\u00e9ed spinach and a stir fry got ordered with some drinks. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis space represents the speed of our food and drinks arriving ( drinks were delicious), ceviche first with corn removed......, next the salad without strawberries, cheese, corn, orange and quinoa (as we requested it gluten free ), then eventually my starter arrived..... after my wife had finished her food. Delicious quinoa encrusted scallops. The food is what prevented a one star review. \n\nI ate my scallops. Waited. And waited. At one point we waited 15 minutes with empty drinks (having ordered more wine) and no food until eventually we had enough. We cancelled my beef stir fry and the similarly elusive saut\u00e9ed spinach and asked for the check. The kitchen staff got blamed once again and we promptly left. \n\nWe will definitely not be revisiting this restaurant which is unfortunate as the potential in both the food, drinks and location is huge. \n\nPs, the hostess on the night did a walk around and avoided all the tables that were lacking in both food and drinks, stepped on a chip on the floor, looked at it and left it for someone else to clean up/ fall on. \n\nHope the owners invest in a manager at some stage soon for their own good.", "author": "Rob L."}

In either case, you'll enjoy pretty presentations of Peruvian fare in a contemporary space. \n\nI thought it odd to see a reasonably-priced $20 Lomo Saltado (delicious, but heavily salted) on the menu alongside price offenders such as the tiny $4 glasses of passion fruit & chica morada (a corn drink, purple in color, which she described as tasting like corcord grape juice) and the exorbitant two for $8 alfajores dessert. \n\nOur share plates -- Mushroom Chicharrones & Tequenos (wontons stuffed with Oaxaca cheese & served with a sweet tamarind sauce or a savory avocado pur\u00e9e) -- $11 and $13, respectively, were filling & perfectly fried. \n\nIn light of already having so many go-to restaurants in the Potrero Hill neighborhood, I was slow to give Mochica a chance, but I'll be quick to return!", "author": "Fancypants X."}

The waiter was pushy about ordering drinks, add-ons, and even sparkling water when we didn't want any of those things. The waiters rushed us by taking our food away without really asking me (asked WHILE taking it away). The food was overpriced for sure. The $19 ceviche had two shrimps, two mussels and 5 pieces of fish, all of which were soaked in a super sour sauce. The spinach side order was $8 and was probably only 2 oz of spinach. The service was even worse towards the end as the waiter SLAMMED the check on the table. I'm never coming back, and you shouldn't go.", "author": "Celia L."}

Fresh and well prepared. If that's all we had ordered I would have given Mochica a solid 4 stars and planned on returning. \n\nUnfortunately the mac n cheese was the worst I've ever had at a restaurant (or at home for that matter). It was SO salty that we could barely eat it. I came from the gym and was pretty hungry so I ate more of it than I should have. This wasn't a tad over seasoned - it was egregiously salty and I love salty food. My friend took two bites and didn't have any more. I can't imagine this is there recipe so maybe it was a mistake? New chef with a heavy hand or mismeasured?\n\nThe salmon was in a similar state. Really salty and unenjoyable. \n\nIf I were the type of person to send food back it would have been warranted but I've never been able to do that. \n\nGiving it a 3 because the ceviche was good and I'm hoping that our salt overload was a mistake vs their normal preparation.", "author": "Amber F."}

After placing our main course meal the appetizers still not coming out and quite a few minutes later the servers came back to let us know that they were out of their pollo a las brazas and so we had to change our order and no food still coming out. We had to ask twice before the brought us mediocre cold coffee and after 30+ minutes and double and triple checking with the server about our appetizers she commented that they were coming, as expected one of three appetizers came after we had been served our meals at which time we cancelled the rest of the appetizers and asked for more coffee and after several minutes they brought us more of that yummy cold coffee which was undrinkable and may have as well asked for a Starbucks Ice coffee.

This is a complaint about the hostess only which might be a restaurant policy, I don't know. Here's what I experienced.\n\nSo, I have been to this restaurant a couple of times all with great experiences, but this last time I got a little put-off by the hostess. On a Wednesday night we were brought into the room with only tables, not in the bar area, and at the time we sat around 6:00 there were only 3 tables in use out of 11 (including us). I wanted to sit next to my girlfriend and so we asked if we could sit at one of the 8 4-top tables that were open so we could sit next to each other. It isn't very often in San Francisco that you can sit next to your dining partner unless you are eating at the bar. The hostess asked if we were expecting more people in our party to which we replied no. She then informed us that they are holding those tables open for the reservations coming later that night. I pressed and she again told us that we couldn't sit at a 4-top with only 2 of us dining. \n\nAs she left she muttered something in Spanish to the trainee who was with her. My girlfriend translated it to be \"Never sit 2 people at a 4-top. Just tell them they are being held for reservations\". I was pretty pissed off, nearly left, but when the waitress came and greeted us she immediately asked if we wanted anything and I said \"yeah, I want to sit next to my girlfriend.\" She said it wouldn't be a problem for us to move to one of the open 4-tops, and by the time we left at 7:45 there were still 4 open 4-tops.\n\nI think the hostesses/management should use a little more common sense when it comes to catering to the wishes of their patrons instead of following a policy because the policy exists.\n\nAfter all was said and done I would still go back.

We probably could have eaten for $60 if I'd ordered more carefully, but everything looked so good so maybe (definitely) I went a little overboard.\n\nWe started with the stuffed calamari and taquenos. We loved the calamari...it looked a little dorky ( like a carrot sculpture) but oh yum. It was stuffed with chorizo and had a walnut sauce, and simple salad ( arugula maybe?) with red onion in a really citrus-y vinaigrette. \nI would definitely get that again. The taquenos were stuffed with cheese and came with tamarind sauce and guacamole. I liked this, but it didnt wow me like the calamari did. \n\nNext we split a seafood stew which came with coconut rice. We ordered grilled asparagus on the side. The seafood stew had salmon, mussels, calamari and shrimp. We both liked the stew a lot. I'd put the name here....but dont see it listed on the menu online so sorry ( see photo.) I also thought the asparagus was really nice;  it was crisp/tender and came with a saffron sauce.\n\nFor dessert we had the churros. I'm a huge fan of churros and can even eat the fake-vanilla tasting ones at Costco. These were so not that...and so good. The were filled with dulche de leche and served with hot chocolate. Delicious!\n\nThe decor was sort of West Elm inside, the bathroom was clean, and service was professional. Everything was timed perfectly. A lot of other diners were having cocktails which looked beautiful, but we were not really in a drinking mood...\n\nYes, I'll go back, and will probably have the calamari relleno for my main course with churros for dessert.\n\nIf you're not familiar with this neighborhood, parking isn't an issue (spots on the street are pretty easy to find) and the views of downtown are stellar. \n\n:)", "author": "El B."}

So they offered to re-make my desert, but before that I ordered a glass of Malbec after drinking a whole bottle of Cabernet and the manager decided to point out that the Malbec was more expensive then the Cabernet we were drinking ( FYI DID I ASK WHAT THE PRICE WAS ....HOW RUDE!!!) Then the male manager comes back to serve the Malbec and says \"I know what happened so I will comp you this glass of expensive Malbec  REALY!!! After all was said and done we still had to pay our bill which in my eyes should of been comp considering the value of my phone and purse was four times the amount of my bill. What happened to customer service I know accidents happen, I've been a server but when you make a mistake you fix and you make sure your customer wants to come back.... that won't be happening ...\n\nSo just an update of my review which I think is even more insulting  the restaurant send me a message stating their sorry and are offering me a $25.00 gift card to come back REALLY!!!! \n\nThank you, but no thank you. While money is not the issue, my tab was $200, and you're only offering me $25. \nI shouldn't have had to give you a bad review for you to offer $25\nThis should have been taken care of that same day, which by the way was Thursday. Again, thank you but no thank you. Your $25 just added insult to injury, and now I definitely won't be returning. \nPS- thankfully my $600 phone is working just fine.", "author": "Leslie C."}

To start, very special, delicious Pisco sours, garnished with a cinnamon cocoa sugar,  that seemed instantly to transport the drinker to South America, and warm, salty purple potato chips.  We split sticky ribs (yummy), yucca fries and a mushroom empanada, all excellent.  Restaurant goes out if its way to give a little extra to everything: a crisp jicama cabbage slaw on the ribs, a spicy drizzle for the empanada , and two dips for the fries (loved the yellow one).  Really nice service and a good vibe. We'd just returned from LA and remarked Mochica was as cool as anything there. Definitely bringing people here, including from out of town.", "author": "Lisa S."}

After a 9 hour drive from San Diego, dinner here was more than I could have asked for. We ordered family style and tried many of the hot and cold appetizers as well as a couple of main dishes. The highlights for me were the macaroni and cheese, which is served piping hot in a creamy cheese sauce with bacon and shrimp. Another favorite was the chicken skewer and the grilled shrimp which is served with a divine sauce and crusty bread. Each of the dishes were clearly and thougtfully crafted and even though we were the last ones to arrive in the restaurant that night, the service and quality were still top notch.  \n\nTo wash it all down, I had a homemade sangria which was flavored just right and not too sweet, though I do wish it had more fruit in it. We also had the churros and panna cotta for dessert. I would say the panna cotta was my least favorite dish of the night, but I am not a huge fan of custard that has the texture of jelly. The freshly made churros, on the other hand, were fantastic. Mochica offers a great variety of dishes with wonderful flavor and great service.

Mochica totally flies under my radar, hidden in Potrero Hill, but it's definitely worth it to come check it out.\n\nWe ordered the ceviche, chicken chicharrones, bolitas de yucca, scallops. I was not a huge fan of the ceviche; felt like it was missing some acidity brightness. The fish itself was also not super fresh. However, all of the other dishes were spot on - their chicharrones were meatier/less crispy than other places', but so flavorful. The bolitas were perfect fluff balls that come with a crack sauce. Took me a while to remember that our 4th dish was scallops, so I guess you could say they weren't super memorable, but at least were good quality.\n\nMake sure to check in on Yelp, as it comes with a complimentary shot of pisco, which you do want to try and taste on its own. The pisco sour that they do here has nice foamy egg whites, with a dusting of cinnamon - very, very good. I also ordered another pisco cocktail, called something like sexy smart s___other alliterative adjective. Nothing was too sweet or too sour, which is great because they have a huge cocktail menu that begs trying.\n\nI think it was a bit pricy overall (the bill rang in at a little over $100 for 3 people, not including tip), but honestly I love a good tapas place, and it's a great spot to bring your friends!", "author": "Stella A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-04", "description": "I'm very surprised that this place only has a 3 1/2 rating on Yelp.  My first experience here was definitely a 5 star experience - both for the food and wonderful service. \n\nMy husband and I came here on my birthday for lunch this past Sunday.  We were walking through Potrero on our walk back from the Dogpatch to the Mission after brunch on Saturday, and stumbled upon this cute little gem.  We had seen it before, but had never actually stopped to look at the menu.  We are huge fans of ceviche and Peruvian cuisine, so we decided to pop in on Sunday for lunch.\n\nSERVICE: As soon as we walked in the door, we were greeted with the utmost hospitality.  The host gave a very warm welcome, and our server was so friendly and warm.  Both wished me a happy birthday (which my husband had mentioned in our Open Table reservation); and as soon as we'd had some time to look at the menu, the waitress offered me any drink of choice on the house in honor of my birthday.  How sweet of them, right?  \n\nDRINKS:  I opted for a spicy mezcal drink (forget the exact name of it, but it was definitely 5 stars) - normally I am a little uncertain about ordering \"specialty cocktails\" out at a restaurant because they are often too syrupy and sweet for my taste.  This was not the case - it had quite a bit of spice (which I was looking for), and the drink was perfectly balanced - only the freshest of ingredients went into the drink (fresh squeezed juice, etc.); none of that artificial pre-made syrupy stuff.  It was one of the best mixed drink I've had out at a restaurant.  \n\nMy husband selected to try the sangria (per my husband, 4.5 stars), which he was a huge fan of.  In fact, he said it was his favorite sangria that he's had since our trip last year to Spain (where he pretty much lived on sangria ;)).\n\nPart way through the meal, the waitress stopped back to check in on us - at which time my husband ordered another glass of sangria.  The waitress asked me if I liked wine (which I assured her I did), and she offered me a glass of sparkling wine on the house (by way of the manager).  This TOTALLY took me by surprise, and was so very appreciated!  Of course, I accepted the offer - and the sparkling was quite delicious :)\n\nFOOD: We were really in the mood for ceviche, so we decided to try two different kinds, along with another small plate to share.\n\nCebiche Mixto (4.5 stars): Fresh fish, mussels & clams, shrimp in lime juice-aji rocoto leche de tigre.  This dish was so fresh, citrusy, and light - the seafood was perfectly cooked, had no \"fishiness\" to it whatsoever, and everything had such great texture.  Even the calamari was tender, which many times can be chewy when not prepared properly.  I think if we had to select only one of the ceviches to order, we'd opt for this one.  But even that's hard to say, as we love both of them pretty much equally.  The only reason I'd say we'd probably go with this one is because it was the lightest tasting of the two, prepared in a style we typically feel like (citrusy, bright, fresh), and had a mixture of different kinds of seafood, which was fun.\n\nCebiche Chino (4.5 stars): Ahi tuna, ginger, scallions, rocoto-hoisin leche de tigre & toasted nori.  Obviously from the title and list of ingredients, this one had more of an \"Asian\" twist to it, with the sesame oil and ginger.  The ahi was so tender and fresh; and the addition of the fried corn-nut like additions played so well with the texture of the fish.  \n\nGrilled chicken skewer with crispy potato, salsa casera & anticucho sauce (4.5 stars):  Honestly, we could have been done and comfortably full since the portion size of each ceviches was so generous.   My husband actually said \"if they forget about the chicken skewer, I would almost be relieved.\"  But then they brought the chicken skewer - and after one bite, my husband retracted his initial statement by saying \"I take that back, this is so stupid good I am ordering this every time even if I'm too full!\"  \n\nSERVICE:  As I alluded to in the beginning, we experienced some of the best service we have ever had (even considering the $$$/$$$$ restaurants we have been to).  They had the perfect amount of attentiveness so it didn't feel like they were hovering, but any time your glass was close to empty or looked like you may need something, someone was there to attend to our needs.  And each encounter (from the manager, to waitress, to bus boys) was exceptional.  Good job Mochica, stellar experience!!!\n\nI highly recommend stopping in to Mochica.  I know we will definitely be back again, and will also be recommending to others.  A great lunch or dinner spot any day of the week.", "author": "Rachael S."}

The food is also really good, especially the aji de gallina, pork belly chaufa, and alfajores.

I remember going to this restaurant when it was in SoMa. But this new location in Potrero Hill is a lot more trendy and fun. \n\nThe hostess was meh and didnt even tell us how long the wait was she said the only options were the community table and the bar. \n\nSo we sat at the bar (which in the end im really hapoy we did) and were greeted by the bartender Tony. He promptly gave us a food menu, a cocktail menu and blue potato chips with a really good lemon onion dipping juice. \n\nIt was really hard choosing a cocktail since there were so many and they all seemed delicious. I went with bitter sweet love which is a light pink with lemon peel garnish served in a martini glass. It was sweet and definitely on the bitter side so the name suits it. My boyfriend had the Summer diet which was also served in a martini glass with a light green color and cucumber garnish. It really was refreshing. \n\nTo start we had a chorizo empanada, ceviche peruano chino, and anticuches of beef heart. Everything was so good. The anticuchos were definitely my favorite very meaty and cooked perfectly to a medium with anticuchera sauce and I believe chimichurri with a potato that had some kind of creamy sauce.\n\nDinner took us awhile since we met some cool people at the bar and Tony also engaged with us. It was really fun. \n\nFor the main course we had pork belly chaufa and the salmon bandido. The chaufa was rich in flavor and filling. The salmon was tender and cooked to the point of juciness. It has blue potato mash underneath with some tomato like stew. I decided to accompany this meal with some Mochica sangria which btw was excellent. \n \nFinally for dinner we had a sampler of the churros filled with Dulce de leche with a side of hot chocolate, vanilla panna cotta, and quinoa flan. My favorite was the panna cotta. It was fresh with vanilla beans on top. \n\nThrough out our dinner not only was Tony checking on us but also a server named Rana.

I was very pleased by the egg on top because I just love eggs and it made the dish royalty. But the meat is what really won me over. It was so juicy, tender, flavorful, and just mmmm. A bit pricy...like 19 bucks for that plate. But I really paid for the experience as well. The waiter was so extremely nice, and polite. He made sure my friend and I had the best service possible.

To ceviche their own though. - #noodosisters on IG\n\nMy Peruvian friend and I were both craving Peruvian food and decided to try Mochica. The reviews on yelp were positive and the food just looked delicious! Overall, I was disappointed because it didn't taste like authentic Peruvian food, which is what I was craving, but the Pork Belly Chaufa made up for it!\n\nPlantain Chips (3.5/4 stars): I thought these were amazing but it's because I love banana chips in general and this one was perfectly crispy with some sugar on it. \n\nAhi Tuna Ceviche (2.5 stars): The Ahi Tuna itself was good but the sauce was just sweet and sour chili sauce (the sauce you dip eggrolls in). I didn't like this dish because it was all sweet with no salty or sour to balance it. I was expecting that sweet but sour to the point where your mouth hurts (I exaggerate, but, really though..). I would come back to try the Ceviche Mixto or Ceviche Pescado to taste how they make it. I just have this expectation of the Ceviche Mixto at Balcones in Los Angeles. SO. GOOD.  \n\nLomo Saltado (3 stars): The fries looked like mcdonalds fries. Let that soak in. Can you feel my sadness? Every lomo saltado I've had, the fries has always resembled steak cut fries. I have never seen skinny fries on lomo saltado. I thought maybe I was just being picky but my friend had the same sad look in his eyes also. Anyways, the dish itself was alright/good but it was missing that kick of soy sauce and vinegar flavor that gives lomo saltado that burst of flavor. If you like a more meaty/beef flavor (I mean, who doesn't?) then you'll like this! \n\nPork Belly Chaufa (4 stars): This was my favorite dish of the night. Very flavorful, and the cubed pieces of pork belly just melts in your mouth. The only thing about this dish is that I'm not sure how \"Peruvian\" it is (not that it has to be authentic since Peruvian food is a mash up of several different cultural foods to begin with). It reminded me of Korean Kim chi Fried Rice but without the pieces of kim chi. Besides that, this dish was delicious and I gave it 4 stars because I would order it again.\n\nWe made reservations and the service was great. The price ranged from $15 - $20, which is normal for SF.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-03-02", "description": "Well...in the previous location this was one of my favorite Peruvian restaurants. The food was fresh, exciting and mostly authentic in a warm, attractive setting. \n\nWe went with another couple last night and were very disappointed. The location was fine and we managed to snag a parking spot just half a block away. The higher level room had Nasca lines painted on the wall - I'm not sure what was painted on the walls of the room we were in - but it didn't add to the atmosphere. \n\nOur waiter too enthusiastically approved of anything we ordered but he did answer questions and delivered food as it popped out of the kitchen.                                                       We had been to this restaurant a dozen times before and we always loved the complimentary little bowl of garbonzo beans with onion, cilantro and lime juice. It was an inventive few bites to let you know that more tasty food was on the way. That was replaced with what amounted to a thimble full of cancha (toasted large Peruvian corn) per person. When we inquired, the waiter said he'd let the chef know we missed the garbonzo concoction. \n\nThe ceviche (halibut) was fine - served with both choclo and cancha. We also had the beet salad and the dressing (maracuya - passionfruit) somewhat clashed with the sweetness of the beets. This same dressing was a perfect pairing with the green salad though, which was delicious. \n\nUnfortunately, one of the most well-known Peruvian dishes, papas a la Huancaina was a flop. Note to chef - adding bacon to a dish - doesn't necessarily improve it. When I saw it on the menu I was actually shocked (and, yes, I AM Peruvian). This dish is the mac and cheese of Peruvian cuisine - nicely cooked (usually boiled) potatoes covered in a slightly spicy cheese sauce. The sauce is yellowish from the medium spicy and fruity pepper, aji amarillo which are usually only available dried or in jars here - though I did have an admiral crop in my garden this year. Their potatoes the waiter told us were grilled. There were several Fred Flintstone sized thick chunks of dry potatoes with peel on barely coated with a scant portion of their spicy version of the Huancaina sauce and the aforementioned bacon on top. Without a doubt this was the most expensive and worst rendition of this dish I've ever had. And I've had it several hundred times. Do not, do not mess with papas a la Huancaina. Now perhaps a gringo hipster who has never had this dish might not know better never having had it and think, oh cool, Peruvian food with bacon. \n\nMy wife's pork dish was only ok and tough. Another companion had chicken or turkey albondigas and was underwhelmed, especially when the rice she ordered with it arrived 10 minutes later even though there was only one other table occupied at that time. \n\nAnd what did the do to the platanos? They were swimming in some kind of syrup and had little flecks of cheese and drips of something, crema, perhaps. When we asked the host and waiter before ordering they said they were between ripe and green. They were definitely Maduros but the preparation left a lot to be desired. \n\nWe skipped dessert and went directly to Mitchell's to drown our sorrows. What had been an inventive, consistently great Peruvian restaurant has veered into fusion territory that fails. And we didn't even try the Peruvian version of truffled macaroni and cheese with bacon. One wonders who they are trying to appeal to. And it wasn't inexpensive - $40/person not including tip, no alcohol and one person had no meat/seafood.", "author": "Marco M."}

Peruvian food sounded interesting and it sure looked good online so we gave it a shot. The food was AMAZING. The flavors burst in your mouth and were so unique I can't even describe them. We got the ceviche to start, my boyfriend and I just looked at each other with our mouths hanging open after the first bite.. it was that good! I got the scallops which were good, I really liked the unique sauces-- but it wasn't off the hook.

We chose it because some how the name of the restaurant ended up in my partner's phone messages, but we're still not 100% sure who told him about the place. I was having some problems with the booking online, so a friend called and made the booking under his name. We had a late booking (around 2 pm) so my friends would have enough time to drive up. \n\nSo my partner and I arrive first. We tell the server that we're early (because we were), and that we were here for a booking for 8 people, but now it was 6 as two people cancelled. She looked confused. Then she looks at the booking screen and says, \"You're early, we need to get your table set up.\" (Why I don't know as the place was only about half full, and you would have thought they would have known about a large party). Then a second woman came up and we basically went through the exact same conversation with her. Weird.\n\nAnyway, we sat at the bar and had some drinks while we were waiting. The drinks were nice, but I've had better. They finally got our table set up and let us sit down (even though we were early). Once our friends arrived, we had a bit of catching up and ordered some food.\n\nMy partner and I split the tuna ceviche and some beef heart skewers to start and then split the traditional Peruvian rice main (whatever it was called). The food was actually really tasty. The tuna was really delicious and beef heart is always good. The rice was nice, but not completely amazing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-10-23", "description": "So i contemplated between 2 or 3 stars.  It's not that the food isn't good, it's just that...it's a bit expensive and I think they're still working out the kinks.  \n\nOn the bright side, the bartender was super cool, explained all their specialty drinks to us.  I don't remember the one that i had, it was with ginger beer though.  We couldn't really taste the difference between the tamarind one and the spicy one that our table ordered, but they were good.  But if I were to get a drink I'd probably get the pisco sour.  Wifester had it, it was good.\n\nThe table ordered a combination of:\n\nchicharrones de pollo (chicken thigh app)\ncostillita de chancho (ribs app)\n\nIt was a close vote, but we enjoyed the ribs a bit more.\n\nFor entrees we had seafood paella, arroz chaufa (chinese inspired peruvian fried rice!) and chancho adobado (pork shoulder).\n\nThey all had good flavor, just nothing that really wowed us or made you want to steal the other person's plate.  The portion isn't huge, but in honesty it's probably the amount of food you're supposed to eat.\n\nwe stayed late, like really late.  It was probably almost 11:30 when we left.  They probably hated us on the inside, but were really nice and friendly even when we left.  Much points for being nice.\n\nOn the slightly down side\n\nThe wait staff is working out the kinks I think.  Now I realize that I am at a peruvian restaurant, but that doesn't mean any of us speak Spanish.  Where the bartender took the time to explain things, the wait staff glossed over things.\n\nwhen our food came out, the first waiter said seafood paella.  and put it down for those who ordered it.  Then the second waiter came, and he said seafood paella!  we were so confused...turns out the first dish was the fried rice.  Not a big deal.  just kind of funny that none of us were bright enough to say hey where's the seafood in this paella...\n\nLater when the pork shoulder came out, we asked if it was the pork shoulder.  Incorrect Seafood paella waiter said, \"it's the chancho adobado\", which ok maybe we should've remembered the name of it...so we asked again, does that mean pork shoulder?  and he again says chancho adobado, before i think realizing we weren't getting it and says oh yes pork shoulder.  Again not a big deal.\n\nAlso got the churros which were really highly rated.  Was a bit disappointed in this, maybe it's because they have filling they don't hold up as well when you bite into it.  It shatters and you're left to eat small pieces like hanover pretzel pieces.\n\nLastly, and probably again due to my ignorance/not being smart enough to use google translate, when I think Peruvian (maybe I'm biased), it means an awesome rotisserie chicken to me.  It's on the menu, but apparently as wifester later pointed out to me, \"el special del fin de semana\" seems to mean \"weekend special\".  So i was pretty bummed that I didn't get to have it and I am not sure if we'll be going back.\n\nGive em a try if you want something new.  They're nice, you'll probably enjoy the food, but you just might be on the fence on returning.", "author": "A C."}

And no waiting! \n\nNo waiting for our table actually meant waiting over 45 minutes for our food to get there! There was really no one in there. I saw 1 other table and couple of guys at the bar. That's it so I'm not sure if they had a late start prepping the food but no one had informed us. We had a hungry toddler and it would have been nice to be warned. When the food finally came it was just barely mediocre. Had the open faced sandwich for myself and the bun was supposed to be toasted but it was cold. My boyfriend had their scramble which was okay. We also had 2 sides of bacon. When it came one plate of bacon was cold and the other one was super hot. The little appetizer they serve when we sat was good though but won't be coming back here again. Just didn't hit the spot", "author": "Ava L."}

Recommend the Jalea, the Chaufa with seafood is amazing and the ceviche is perfection......a little on the pricey side so be ready to splurge a little. I give them a 3 because they were out of Chicha morada when I visited, which is a Peruvian staple so I was a little disappointed when I asked for a drink that had it as an ingredient.......The service was a little slow at first but the staff is really nice and friendly. Most of the drinks that are made with Pisco, we have not been disappointed with those.......I will be returning here for sure to give it another chance just hoping they won't be out of Chicha morada!

My family is Peruvian so I was hoping Mochica wouldn't disappoint. Wait staff was attentive and friendly. Decor was modern and chic but had a Peruvian twist. None of that kitschy decorations. Ordered some chilcanos (ginger ale and pisco) very tasty, strong and inexpensive\n\nFOOD - 2 of us had the Aji de Gallina. That's a tricky dish to pull of and I have had some bad versions of it. This dish was tasty and well done. My aunt had the Pollo a la Brassa; it was a half chicken with choice of two sides and sauces. Delicious and great value for $15, perfect to split between to people. My brother had the Seco de res; I should have ordered that! It looked amazing. I had the pork belly chaufa, the waiter said it was his favorite. I like it and thought it was pretty good but everyone else's food was so good I was slightly disappointed, the pork belly could have been a bit crispier. Overall, very reasonably priced, delicious in a cute neighborhood. Will definitely return", "author": "Mario S."}

Fine, but at variance with the hip appearance of the restaurant.\nThe Camarones de Ajo (Mexican shrimp) was slightly better, due to a terrific sauce that came with. We asked for extra bread (charged $2 for) to mop this up. The shrimp themselves either weren't very well cooked or weren't very fresh, and tasted like the frozen variety at Trader Joe's. Dish could have been improved by free bread for the asking. \nThe Chancho de Adobado (pork shoulder) was terrific, but again could have used more free bread. The pork was tender, and the dish nicely salty. \n\nI wanted to like the restaurant more. The food was okay, but over-priced for the result given. For what I've described above, and three beers, after tip, was approximately $90. Service was good, we got seated without a reservation on a Friday night without difficulty, which made us happy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-30", "description": "I'll start off by saying that I had a fantastic experience working with the restaurant manager Victor, planning an event, as well as dining at the restaurant.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I are planning a lunch for our family following our wedding ceremony and without having been to the restaurant at all, made a reservation on OpenTable for 18 people! First off, very cool of them to let us do that. I followed up with a call to the restaurant just to confirm and eventually started working with Victor the restaurant manager, who invited us in for a tasting and tour.\n\nWe went last night and Victor sat down with us and went through how they could set up tables for us, went through pretty much the entire menu and how we could build any kind of meal we wanted for our lunch. A la carte, family style, formal coursed dining...whatever we wanted to do. Most other places we spoke with about hosting a group our size had a fixed menu with little to no options. Really great, personalized service here.\n\nNow the food...we tried a lot of food. \n\nFirst they bring out a few purple potato chips which are great way to start the meal. Our first appetizers were Tequenos (fried cheese wonton) and Bolitas de Yucca (fried potato ball with ham and cheese). As much as I liked the Oaxaca cheese in the Tequenos, the Bolitas de Yucca are a more balanced dish. Both are very good. Followed up with beef heart and chicken anticuchos (grilled skewers). Beef heart is good, but may not be for everybody; the chicken, however, was phenomenal. Also the skewers are served with a grilled potato with huancaina sauce (similar to nacho cheese, except amazing), so good. I also tried the Cebiche Pescado and thought it was very good, although I would never claim to be a cebiche expert.\n\nFor main entrees we had the Seco de Res (short rib) which was okay, nothing particularly special, as well as the Pollo a la Brasa (rotisserie chicken) which was very well prepared. Thigh and legs were very moist; the breast dried out a little bit, but that's hard to avoid. Comes with chimichurri and aji Amarillo sauce to dip it in, which helps with the dryness of the breast, and also adds incredible flavor. I would say that even without the sauce, the chicken has great flavor. On the side, we had the Ensalada Nuovo Andina (salad with quinoa and beets) which was very good, as well as yucca fries which were delicious. We had a number of fried dishes (yucca balls, tequenos, yucca fries and churros) and none of them were oily in the least, which was impressive. \n\nAnd finally for dessert, we had mini alfajores and churros with dulce de leche and dipping hot chocolate. Alfajores were not too sweet, which some people might prefer, and the texture of the cookie was good. If you want something sweeter, the churros are probably the way to go.\n\nOverall, a really incredible meal and experience. We look forward to going back to sample more of the menu and finalize our lunch menu. Thanks again to Victor and the staff!", "author": "Zachary S."}

To begin with proper direction: \nI came with two other people. It didn't take long to get seated, yay, but it took for EVER to get a drink and order. After the first drink, we had to waive the waitress for our next drink which came in two parts because she only took our friend's order and not ours. Mind you we drank them slowly. After that, our appetizer arrived and we had no cutlery or plates to share it because they didn't bother to set us up. Luckily the sweet buzzboy helped us. He set us up and we ate our appetizer. Again, it took forever for the food to get here and I mean FOREVER. Food got here, they FINALLY refilled our water and we started to eat. The food was too salty and they obviously had frozen potatoes instead of real potatoes. My boyfriend's food was bland. Bummer.

I enjoyed this delicious avocado appetizer and the chicken chicharrones. The staff is friendly and attentive. It has a nice ambiance. But the best part of Mochica is the Peruvian drinks. I am a huge fan of pisco sours and this was one of the best I've had. I also recommend the pisco punch. They're the perfect combination of sweet, fruity, and sour. You can ask the bartender, Yuri, for recommendations. He knows his stuff. I'll definitely be back to Mochica!", "author": "Kristin S."}

I wish my pisco lime concoction had more ginger beer than citrus, which made it watered down.  As for the food, dishes slightly larger than tapas-sized portions, and easy to share.  The ceviche, chiccarones, paella all tasty.  My coffee was weak but they gladly took it back for a stronger cup.  Definite highlight were the churros with a melty caramel inside.  Didn't even need the cup of hot chocolate it was served with.  All in all a fun place to try new twists on familiar food.  I'd return for the sangria, ceviche and churros.", "author": "Kristin U."}

Fresca in Noe/West Portal beats it in terms of flavor and freshness\n\nPalta Rellena - A half avocado topped with beets, small strips of fried chicken and mayo. It looks interesting but like the ceviche, it did not have much flavor\n\nLomo Saltado - Basically stir fried beef with soy sauce, green onion, tomatoes, onions and rice. The seasoning was very basic, a little too bland for my tastes. Also price ($19).\n\nSangria - Too sweet, though it had lots of different kinds of fresh fruit (strawberry, blueberry, apple and orange).\n\nService:\n\nVery friendly but they made several mistake with our order.  We did not order the Lomo Saltado, they packed up one of the dishes instead of serving it as requested and the total on the check was wrong, though they corrected it before we were charged.", "author": "Tom M."}

Modern but not too pretentious, which is a pleasant surprise in this part of town. I friggin' LOVED the pork belly skewers. Probably some of the best pork belly I have had, ever. Churros, aahhh mouthgasm.\n\nAs for the service... like I said, I had a gift card. At no point during my dining experience was I made to feel less important due to the gift card. I find at some restaurants waiters will not be that attentive to Groupon/other gift card kinda situations. Our waiter was great and helpful in selecting menu items and wine pairings.\n\nI will be back when my wallet allows (or when i receive another gift card, haha). Lovely place!", "author": "Ada G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-12-07", "description": "Very disappointed in this new Potrero Hill Restaurant. Over priced both at the bar and at the table. Gin martini - somewhat skimpy - $12.00. Pisco Sour, $14.00 (their online bar menu shows $10.00)  An extensive wine list far more than needed.The pork shoulder, $19,00, was a small piece of bone with a few scraps of meat and fat - not too bad a sauce. The fried mixed seafood was a small/medium portion which would have made a good small plate or appetizer, but was over-cooked and very dry. It had two very bland unidentifiable sauces with it. Didn't bother with dessert. Why they had the tired old 'chocolate molten lava cake' on the dessert menu I have no idea - nothing at all to do with Peruvian food.", "author": "Ron M."}

Fans of the Harrison location will be crestfallen after seeing the diminished portion size, high prices, and most importantly, the mediocre quality of the food, at this new spot. Gone are the chickpea appetizers compliments of the house. The chicken stew (aji de gallina) was somehow stringy and dry. All other dishes were fine, but not worth the drive. Presentation was nice if you care about these things, and the churros filled with  dulce de leche were downright addictive. Still, for $150 for three, this first visit will likely be my last.", "author": "Jessica D."}

After reading some of the mixed reviews on Yelp, we were preparing for perhaps some slow service. However, it wasn't very busy when we went and service was great. Everyone loved the food! In particular, the beef heart skewer and this potato dish (don't remember the name of) were big hits with our party. The potato dish was like a fried/battered potato which was stuffed meat and cheese and was part of the Father's Day Special. It also came with a Pisco Sour because of Father's Day, which was also delicious. \nAs a vegan, I did not partake in the beef heart and potato dish however the beet salad (ordered without goat cheese) and mushroom sandwich I had were very good. The sandwich was simple but very delicious. The only one complaint our party had was that the ceviche dish they ordered was lacking in flavor compared to all the other dishes.\nThe Churros were very good for dessert - they were filled with caramel and my family loved it. I think we all agree we would definitely be back to try other dishes!", "author": "Jogreet C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-14", "description": "Somewhere between 2-3 stars is the ideal rating for Mochica. There's nothing really great about this place, the food is par, but not the quality I was expecting for the prices. We were a party of 9, so we tried and shared just about everything. For starters, the tuna ceviche is a definite winner. The flavor of the pomegranate seeds and the tuna is a solid combination. Don't get the ceviche sampler though, as it is minimalistic at best, served in the tiniest of dishes and is probably good for only 2-3 people. All meat dishes tended to border on the salty side, but the beef was far more flavorful then the chicken dishes. The paella, we ordered both the regular tomato base as well as the squid ink, was lacking in seafood. How can serve this dish without prawns?!? We only got 1 prawn in 3 paella dishes... definitely unacceptable. And the black paella (squid ink) was way too heavy on the ink. Our drinks were slow too; we received our food before we had enough glasses of water on the table for everyone, and the cocktails were inconsistent in their concoction. Yet there only appeared to be one bar tender... The service was just okay, kind of unacceptably slow for the small space. Ending on a few good notes - the plate presentations, the coffee, the ambience, the decor.", "author": "T P."}

The service was above average - the waitress was very helpful, friendly and attentive. The restaurant itself seems a little confused about its identity- caught between being a white tablecloth dinner spot and a hip flexible cocktail bar. Regardless, we were there for the food, and tried a couple ceviches and an empanada. The halibut ceviche was very good, although the pieces of fish were a little too large. It was quite spicy though, so watch out! The empanada was a highlight - it was fresh, rich and very tasty. The prices were a little high, but overall well worth a try. The restaurant adds variety to the Potrero fair and thus probably has staying power, but I have to say I've had better Peruvian food in the Mission.", "author": "Nikhil V."}

For lack of a better word, the fungi shui really impressed me.  As you enter, you are greeted with the full bar and a view of the kitchen, where you can see all the food being prepared.  Most importantly, the staff present themselves in a sincere and friendly manner, but not that over the top cheesy type of service that has become common in the restaurant industry.  Smiles are genuine here.  The bartender, Flaco, is a fountain of knowledge and answered all my questions amicably while steadfastly attending to his duties.  He was a real treat to watch while we waited for our food.  The food was incredible, which is always the most important part.  Plates are prepared with care and come out as near works of art.  I had the beef hearts, along with the pulpos (octopus), ceviche and yucca balls.  For a drink, Flaco made me the best pisco sour I have ever had. Admittedly, I have not had that many, but still.  Everything was truly delicious, and I left Mochica fully satisfied.  You won't regret having a meal here.", "author": "Galen m."}

As we were waiting everyone kept getting the wrong dish. The waiters didn't even know which food orders went to what table. The couple next to us were eating their dinner when their dessert was brought out too early and the waiter asked if they wanted it now but they were like no we got our dinner.  The cebiche was way to acidic and my boyfriend ordered pork and was told it came with mash potatoes and it wasn't mashed potatoes but some cabbage salad. I couldn't wait for desert bc I got the churros and I bit into churro batter. It Was so bad it tasted like oil. The thing that did it for both of us was we ended up paying 160 including tip and not once did anyone ask how dinner was or even checked up on us. Customer service was not good.
