Instead, there can be multiple exhibitions on display at any given time in the galleries. They rotate often, so there's always something new for everyone. There is a modest admission fee for the galleries. As for the performing arts, there's a gorgeous, large, modern theater on the campus that hosts anything from modern dance and ballet performances to Apple product rollouts. And as for film, there's even a special screening room for contemporary productions.\n\nEven better, there are interactive art workshops for time to time. Quite innovative is the \"pay what you can\" membership, in addition to regular memberships, that promotes maximum inclusivity in YBCA's activities. Overall, this is a campus well worth visiting and supporting.", "author": "Vincent L."}

TS is one of my favorite contemporary artists who simply showed in a creative way that art and engineering are not two separate things at all, maybe the same by origin. \n\nSeveral years ago, the whole day I spent at New York's Park Avenue Armory for his space show to Mars has been one of the most unforgettable and happiest day I had in New York and I was so inspired by the mise en place philosophy of his work and has sort of adapted to his Always Be Knolling, ABK style since then. So this time, when I walked into YBCA's space for this show to Europa, the whole memory just flashed back like an old friend. Actually I found YBCA's show is a great retrospective to let me review a lot of details that I was not able to look at the New York show at all, such as how those small cameras work to put together the whole picture of the launch pad. I was also able to have a very close look at the space shuttle this time. Although this show at YBCA is much smaller than the one in New York, I have to say that there is something unique in this exhibit space that New York's Park Avenue Armory will never be able to catch up, oh year, the California sunshine lightening up everything in the room. \n\nIn my impression, YBCA is small but always has very cool exhibits. I can't remember what was the last show I saw exactly. But I remember that when I walked out, I saw a pile of plastic containers with food in it in the corner. I was wondering they were part of the art and was told that the dried seafood from Thailand was from the artist who invited people to take away to try. I did take a box away and the art was very delicious.\n\nOh one thing I really like about YBCA - I was charged less for the admission because I went there by public transportation. I think all the other museums in the world should adapt the same rule, especially those in New York!", "author": "Cecille C."}

We were excited because we had never been there before and wanted to see what they had to offer. \n\nThe curator upstairs approaches us, and begins to explain the display we were looking at, we even explained that we had no idea what it was about but we were excited to learn about it. She spoke for a little bit more, and then suddenly stops mid-sentence and says \"you're not even listening, maybe you're better off exploring on your own and reading the descriptions yourselves\", and before we could say anything she walks away from us. \n\nHow unbelievably rude.

The building itself by Fumihiko Maki is a wonderful place, perfect for the organization's mission. Over the years I have come to expect the unexpected and to be filled with a sense of wonder and delight at YBCA. I cannot say that this is a given  for every single exhibition but nearly so.\n\nMy favorite exhibition / installation at YBCA was the \"Listening Post\" created by Mark Hansen and Ben Rubin. I saw it first at the Skirball in Los Angeles and when it arrived in the Bay Area I could not resist an encore. \n\nThere are several YouTube videos of Listening Post, but none of them captures the atmospheric excitement of the piece. It's just impossible because it was an environment with extraordinary spatial and acoustic properties. Add to that it all took place in a dark room, with only the LED displays illuminating that space. All of these things are impossible to represent with any degree of fidelity on YouTube.\n\nThe spirit of creative exploration seems to infuse most art that often comes to YBCA.

An arts complex with a park, museum, outdoor stage, theatre, fountain and a park where people could relax. I knew of an engaged couple who were getting married at St. Patrick's (across the street, next to the Contemporary Jewish Museum) who were very sure the park would be in existence by the time of their wedding. (NOT!) \n\nNext to the YBCA is the Metreon, the home of the new Target store, a City Target as well as Sanraku, Cako, a food court with various eateries, and the AMC Metreon.\n\nHere is the 411 on Yerba Buena Center for the Arts:  http://www.ybca.org/about/history\n\nI have sauntered through the park to go to SF MOMA, the CJM, Moscone Center, the Metreon, and to various establishments within the proximity. I walked through the fountain dedicated to the late Dr. Martin Luther King; remembered being in awe looking at the photos and the text about him.\n\nI have visited the museum a couple of times on free days. The last time I was there, much of the exhibits were dedicated to the local occupy movement and abstract works by various artists. I regret to say I was not too impressed with what was being exhibited at the time. I am overdue for a return revisit. \n\nThe Lam Research Theater (formerly known as the Novellus Theater) is a state of the art modern theater.  Straight, simple clean lines.  This theater relies on modern computer technology in setting the miss-en-scene (mood, lighting, background) of what ever is needed.\n\nI was amongst a group of students who were invited to watch the final dress rehearsal of Opera Parall\u00e8le's production of AINADAMAR by the composer Osvaldo Golijov performing this weekend, February 15-17.  It was good fun watching a dress rehearsal and observing the goings-on before the official opening in making sure everything runs smoothly like clockwork.  \n\nSo the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts has something for everybody here: a park, a museum, a theatre, outdoor theatre, a fountain, and the Metreon.

Their programming and installations are international, diverse, and interesting but other than the Arrows, nothing just screams at me as a must see.  \n\nI don't know whether this is legit, but each time I've gone to YBCA for a screening I've also been able to walk through the art/installation gallery at no additional expense which makes for a very reasonable deal.  It's a big, airy gallery, with lots of installations and performance spaces (but no permanent collection).  Both times I've been they've featured artists from outside North America (currently featuring artists from India, in multiple disciplines).  Their whole offering is a little different -  a little less \"accessible\" to the masses and a little more challenging than art at, say MOMA - but that's not to say it's not good or worthy.  It is.    \n\nWithin the gallery their \"docents\" take the approach of engaging patrons not by explaining the art but rather by questioning them on what the art says to them, or what they think it's about, which can lead to some interesting dialogue.  If you like (or think you might like) being challenged by art in many different disciplines, pick a film off their calendar then follow up with a wander through the gallery.

If I were trained in choreography and semiotics I would have plenty to analyze, because modern dance always says something.

At the first intermission I loosened up with a glass of chardonnay ($8 + tip), and from then on the dance flowed smoothly across my eyes and brain. From the unusual, iconic characters that raised memories of Greek and Roman legends, to hip hop and parodies of various dance styles, to one piece that the lead dancer performed completely en pointe -- because modern dance and ballet are bff's you know -- to the costuming, everything flowed beautifully. \n\nWe had perfect seats to see it all, in Orchestra Left, but the theater has no bad site lines. Pretty much the cube you see on the outside is the cube you see on the inside, with the exception of there being a full traditional seating arrangement. Yes, there are balconies and boxes. \n\nI wanted to post their promo picture of men in black briefs leaping at each other, but it doesn't do the program justice.

If you run, you'll only be left to wait in the dark.\n\nThat's because the theater is run like a catamaran excursion at the wharf: in order to get more folks on board, the captain departs only when the last passenger arrives. So if you're the kind of guy who shows up on time to movies, be prepared to wait five, 10 -- even 15 -- minutes and expect to tell your next appointment that you'll be late. Do I resent having my time wasted so that the maximum number of disorganized stragglers may be accommodated? Not anymore. This time I remembered to bring a pen and paper and have used the time to write this review.\n\nBut like sights seen from a sailboat on a fine day, the films presented here are beautiful glimpses of important and moving things! And because this city only has Yelp to tell its denizens about worthy art events, most screenings are terribly underattended. Only arts hounds like me who deliberately investigate the YBCA's inscrutable web site even know what's going on. (Seeing Pina Bausch, Rem Koolhaas, the Muppets? That's my idea of a cruise!)

BOUGHT TOTAL OF 160 TIX (for 4 family members) LAST YEAR FOR SF DREAM HOME RAFFLE - AND NOBODY WON! True that odds are not guarantee... So why claim this 1:50 chance of winning a prize ?!?! THIS IS PLAIN TRICKERY & SCAM! \n\nFOR EVERYONE OUT THERE - PLEASE DON'T BE FOOLED! \n\nHere is the response from the Raffle director: Yes, statistically that many tickets should translated into at least three prizes to you.  It certainly would if for every 50 tickets, a prize was chosen rather than having all the tickets in the raffle drum and one winner chosen per prize, as we are required to do by the State of California.  In this case, though, it appears that the probability of winning more than one prize didn't lead to that actually happening.  I'm sorry your luck wasn't better for this drawing considering the substantial investment. \n\nREGARDING THE DRAWING & AUDITING PROCESS: All ticket stubs are printed by a third party vendor based on a spreadsheet containing all ticket information associated with each purchase (ticket number, name, address, city, state, phone, alternative phone, and email).  Those ticket stubs are printed, bound, and sealed in a box and sent to the organization shortly before each drawing.  The box remains sealed until our auditor arrives on the day of the drawing to conduct the audit of the tickets.  She opens the box, puts the tickets in numerical order, and unbundles them (they come in bundles of 250).  Once the tickets are laid out in order, voided tickets are removed from the group (for tickets that have been paid with insufficient funds such as a bounced check or in the case of a refund after a ticket has been issued).  Then she takes a random sampling of ticket numbers based on the spreadsheet of all ticket purchasers.  She does a reconciliation between the spreadhsheet information and the ticket stub information to make sure they match.  She chooses a statistically relevant sample to ensure that all ticket stubs fairly reflect all ticket purchases.  Once the reconciliation has been conducted and approved she then takes the ticket stubs down to the public location of the drawing (early bird drawings take place in the YBCA Foyer and the grand prize drawing took place in the YBCA Theater building).  She then places the tickets in a transparent, acrylic raffle drum.  She locks the drum, spins the drum, and picks out the winning ticket(s) in front of the public.   After the winning tickets have been chosen and recorded, all tickets from the drawing are placed in storage bags and retained by the charity for 10 years in the event that someone challenges the authenticity of the drawing or the inclusion of their ticket.  \n\nUNLESS THIS PROCESS IS RECORDED THEN SHOWN TO THE PUBLIC, THIS PROCESS IS JUST BS !!! BEWARE !!!", "author": "M F."}

I was really excited that Yelp had invited us to see the Cosmic Wonder/Sampling Oakland exhibit here on opening night. \r\n\r\nWe were able to peruse the galleries and view the interesting art. I was particularly wowed by one really large piece that was made up of detailed paint strokes and stenciled cut-outs. What was really cool was that several pieces had audio descriptions that you could access with your cell phone. However, if you're caught talking back on your cell phone, the security guard will tell you to get off your phone. \r\n\r\nI especially liked the cute deer made entirely out of bars of Irish Spring soap.

Last I looked it was a contemporary art space and not a hipster dive bar.\n\nWhen you see the occasional great art work there it is in the context of a social agenda (Basquiat and Pettibon in the Beautiful Losers show) or out of context altogether such as a Joseph Beuys multiple in the middle of a Black Panthers Exhibiton.\n\nEven witihin their obvious agendas they could show at least a few good, serious works at any given time.\nThe Berkeley art museum's Matrix series shows 10 times  more serious contemporary art than YBCA.\n\nEdit: I got the new catalog in the mail.

Black instead of foofy means it's dark during the show.  The design, shape, and modest size guarantee good sound and sight-lines.  Performers tell me it's got a great stage set-up.  There's also the \"forum,\" a slightly smaller flex space cube, and a much smaller screening room.\n\nThe programming comes from several sources but it's always innovative and relevant.  You might see a dance, jazz show, poetry reading, orchestra concert, perhaps a corporate event or a wine tasting.  It's all world class professional stuff, just , a little new or esoteric to fill the symphony hall.\n\nPlus a decent parking scene, public transportation, downtown / SOMA location, nearby bars and restaurants, and strolling around the gardens.

I have seen several Smuin Ballet productions here, and my experience has been the same.

He's a member there, so off we went to check out the theater portion.  We were in the very last row, but it's a small venue, so that's totally fine. Seats were comfortable, bathrooms were clean.  They even held onto his hat that he left in his seat so we could pick it up the following day.\n\nI really liked the show-this year it's played in New Zealand, Australia and the UK.

The show went on to tour the country.\n\nThis next show: \"DARK MATTERS\" Jul 28-Nov 11, 2007 is a wonderful showcase of  various video installations each one extremely fascinating both visually and conceptually.

I've been there for skateboarding and hip-hop exhibits, youth film festivals, theater and dance performances.\n\nTheir Art Savvy program is a once a month program to introduce community members to modern art through the use of Visual Thinking Strategies. By partnering with VTS, YCBA opens the gallery on a Thursday evening. Participants are guided through a discussion of a variety of pieces to open up the sensibility to modern pieces. (Which is great if you are not an expert.) Afterward, we are led through the gallery's current show and spend about an hour responding to the pieces as a group.\n\nGreat way to spend an evening and approach modern art in a completely non-pretentious way. The facilitators really were helpful in sharing their knowledge with the participants. Participants ranged from working artists/educators to novices, such as myself, who may have a sense of aesthetics, but lack formal training in \"capital A\" art.\n\nDecember 2008's exhibit featured works from Viet Nam and Korea. It is \"transPOP: Korea Vietnam Remix.\"\n\nSERVICE\nYCBA and VTS staff were excellent facilitators for the evening. We had a separate classroom for the \"instructional\" portion of the session and then went down into the gallery space to view some of the work. \n\nThey were really encouraging of participation, offered their expertise, but also elicited the knowledge of the participants to create an impression of the works.\n\n\nRESTROOMS\nLovely restrooms at the YCBA.\n\nSUGGESTION\nArt Savvy is an excellent idea! Perhaps each month targets specific groups? Professionals, students, youth, artists, dancers, techies, etc. to get their take on art and to also open the space up to more community members.", "author": "Eriqua P."}

There were three pieces in all, each one with its own amazing lighting, music, costuming, and especially wonderful choreography and music. I was so excited to be there, and everything was above and beyond any expectations I had. The dancers were incredible, especially the soloist that performed near the end. I really really loved every part of it.\nThe middle piece, I think it was called Bloom, had some very covetable music, by Rufus Wainright and the female dancers were wearing the cutest dresses.

(Oddly enough, the photographs and videos of the soundsuits also hold their own, even when you've got the real things right there.)\n\nI actually saw the Nick Cave exhibition at the \"What's the Big Idea?\" party.  Attend a party here.  Just...wow.  I arrived at around midnight so I missed a lot of the performances, but I caught the end of some aerial acrobatics.  I got to see a bit of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence with their punk-vampire-drag act, gurgling fake blood and being generally amazing.   My favorite was one of the backup singers: whitefaced, with strange clown-diamond abysses for eyes and an unnatural cock to the head, spewing blood from the mouth and then smearing it on his own face.  And that was just the beginning.\n\nHalf the fun is checking out what other attendees are wearing.  One guy, completely spangled in silver sequins, told us he was a superhero raising money to \"remove the self-loathing from children in a beam.\"  Yeah, that's an exact quote, but he got a couple of bucks out of us to take a picture with him because he looked like a magpie's nest AND spoke in a robot voice.  \n\nAnd as we were standing on the street outside after exiting the party, we saw a guy striding by grumbling and strewing tinsel (????) behind him, like a disaffected elf.

There was quite a few interesting exhibits, like the television showing a continuous video of various other televisions.  And there was also the television surrounded by grocery store items, showing a video of a shopping cart traveling through a grocery store with nobody pushing it.  And I can't forget the large room where the drinks we're being served....I watched a man dressed in head to toe neon dance around doing violent movements as he tried to expel fear from the room to the ringtones of the Dirty South's very own -- Bone Crusher.  If you're confused, so was I?  The Cosmic Wonder exhibit  was the epitome of freedom of expression and seemed to fit perfectly in the fine city of San Francisco.  The technology was state of the art and the place was very spacious and the prints and performanes were interesting to say the least..  I'd definitely go back for future exhibits.", "author": "LaSha G."}
