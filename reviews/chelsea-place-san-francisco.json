It is literally across the street from my hotel and so my wife decided to stop in on Saturday night. It's just a small bar that has walls covered in crap and two big T.V.s playing sports. The wife and I sat at the end of the bar and had quite a few beers and whiskey and the bartenders were very friendly. I saw that they had some peanuts behind the bar and they gave me a serving of peanuts to enjoy with my beers. \n\nWhen we first got there there were not many people but all of a sudden about 20 extra people filled into the bar. The bar plays loud music that seemed to be controlled by a jukebox that you pay for. Everybody seemed to be having a good time in there and everybody was friendly who came in. I also like how they chill the glasses for the beer; it's not something I would've expected from a dive bar! The prices were okay for a bar. The beer was $5 which is good but the well whiskey was pretty pricey for what it was. It's a very cool place and I will be back.", "author": "Nico M."}

It was obvious we weren't regulars and were treated as such from the bartenders and initially by some of the other customers. \n\nMy first concern was that I was not provided with change when I paid in cash and it's a $20 limit via card (I gave $12 for a $7 shot, I let it go because my group was sitting there a bit before I ordered a drink and I felt bad/decided that the $5 would be my tip for the night). \n\nSecondly, a friend (who is obviously not from the U.S.) ordered a red bull and vodka with the assumption that we would get a red bull can and a vodka shot. When he tried to explain what he wanted, the bartender became unnecessarily aggressive. Instead of allowing us to just buy an extra red bull in peace (which we asked immediately after she told us that's not how they serve the drink), the bartender had the nerve to lecture and argue with us about how she doesn't give things out for free and that redbull is typically very expensive. \n\nThe dice drink betting game is a unique characteristic of this bar, but I'm certainly never returning based on such rude service (which was a huge bummer because it had potential).

Like Norm and Cliff and the rest of the gang, I understand the appeal of a dive bar where you don't have to impress anyone and where the regulars rule the roost. But sometimes dive bars have a dark side. \n\nI learned this the hard way when I wandered in to Chelsea Place with some coworkers on a weekday night looking for a casual place to have a beer.

She even stopped and chatted with us a bit and told us a little about herself. I think some of my male coworkers may have developed a crush. \n\nThe highlight of my night - and maybe my whole life - was when one of the grizzled regulars started berating one of my innocent friends for having his chair stick out too far into his path to the bathroom. Instead of a simple 'excuse me,' he chose to call us a word which I try not to say or even type as it's so offensive. Let's just say I'll see you next Tuesday. We were so shocked that we soon made our way to leave the bar, at which point the gentleman began to yell at us and call us awful names again, with the rest of the scary old regulars looking on dopily and the bartenders doing nothing about it. \n\nSure, your regulars are valuable, but if you allow them to verbally abuse potential new customers, once they expire you'll have no new business... just a suggestion that you may want to be nice to everyone who walks in your door.", "author": "Christina P."}

If we weren't already looking for Tunnel Top, we could have easily missed this place. \n\nHonestly, CP looked kind of sketch. We walked in, and within two seconds were on our way out. The bartender responded with something like \"nooo, come back\", and we did! She was adorable. \n\nSeating was very limited. There was a bar, and a few seats here and there. There's only one semi large table that fits about 4-5 comfortably. The place was also very dark. My two girlfriends and I ordered beers and sat at their largest table. \n\nThe atmosphere was definitely more chill than other bars, there were a few people smoking and having light conversations. With us included (3), there were probably only 6 people there total. I felt kind of bad because it seemed like we were being loud--someone had to ask the bartender to raise the television volume up (woops).\n\nOverall, not bad of a place to chill. Definitely seems like a place only regulars go to. If you cannot handle people smoking (like one of my friends), this isn't the place for you. On a good note, the owner (i'm assuming) was very sweet!

I had them make me a round of mixed shots, I told them five and she made four and then just restrained them into five glasses when I corrected her.  I was still charged for five, which was pretty BS.  They play a dice game where if you win they buy you a drink, but when our group won they said it had to be 2 out of 3.  And, then when we won that, she said that we had to keep playing until it was even(?).  \n\nSo, they bought us a drink and we bought them a drink.  However, I'm fairly certain that the drink we bought them was water that they poured into a shot glass from a used Patron bottle(although we paid as if it was a patron shot). \n\nIf not for the shenanigans with the dice game and the pouring four shots into five glasses, I would have rated this place a solid three star or maybe a four star.", "author": "Ted G."}

No need to worry about The Glare if you want something more complicated than a bourbon & coke - I've had very good manhattans, mai tais, and margaritas here, and the ladies (well, at least one of them) will do what they call a black margarita with chambourd.   I also saw many a kamikaze round prepared during a couple of the baseball games I watched here.\n\nThey serve up a variety of bar snacks if you ask - popcorn, peanuts, and I believe pretzels are an option too.  It is an occaisional smoking bar, generally in the later hours when a few drinks have been consumed, so beware if that's not your thing. \n\nChelsea Place boasts 3 flat screen TVs and free wi-fi (no password required, very fast connection),  and is open at noon daily, unlike some bars (*cough* Tunnel Top *cough*) that aren't even open on Sundays, much less noon.  The only thing that bugs me is that the well bourbon & cokes are always at least $5, which would be just fine if they weren't served in teeny tiny minature collins glasses.  \"Fancier\" drinks (which are served in larger glasses) and call drinks tend to run $7-$10, and while credit cards are accepted, there's a $20 minimum.", "author": "Sus...

This is the kind of place where you can strike up a conversation with a stranger and actually have an interesting talk. As someone that loves to talk to new people and hear their stories this is a great place to hang out. It's one of the few places I can go to alone with out any concern that I'll be bored.\n\nThis is one of those places where if you buy the bartenders one of those half shots of tequila or whiskey (lady drink) they'll hang around and talk to you for a few minutes.

Lady Pestlebottom and I sat at an old marble table which was awkwardly placed under a ledge along the back wall, which one could ineffectively hide one's head beneath, or rest one's head upon it after just the right number of cocktails. Upon said ledge were strewn orange crumbs from some cheese-based cracker snack. One aesthetic point.\n\nThe bartendresses were nice, and the patrons were of a mixed variety of white males. All were smoking. Three televisions broadcasted sporting events, always a sign of a boring drinking establishment.\n\nAesthetic points aside, we will most likely not visit this establishment again. I was quite turned off by the rampant cigarette smoking and extremely loud and irritating music. The sort of popular music the kids are listening to these days with the voice-modulated vocals that I can't stand. Although at one point the lights grew slightly dimmer and a Bon Jovi ballad was played. A slight improvement, but overall the ambience was not thrilling for us, and so we made a hasty exit as soon as our glasses were drained, and headed downhill in search of something darker...\n\n(we did not find it that evening.

It's got the rustic dive bar feel, but it's sense of the rustic derives not from  quality trappings that are broken in, but from cheap props that have long since worn out.  The ceiling with it's sizable cross-beams and yellowing plaster has a look of antiquity about it, but from there on down the entire place is sided with fake walnut paneling with vertical stripes of simulated wood.  Decor is little more than stock posters, neon, and mirrors from beer suppliers, while a lone banner of some sort from Chelsea is the only unique item gracing the walls.\r\n\r\nA small back area that looks like it housed a pool table at one time hosts several isolated cocktail tables.  A gas fireplace is nearby, though it wasn't fired up during my last visit. The on-tap beer assortment wasn't all that great, and the liquor selection was on par with that of a down-and-outers bar in the Tenderloin.\r\n\r\nChelsea's crowd was a varying mix of seasoned regulars and passers-through from the Union Square area.  The mix is about fifty-fifty during the day, but the regulars rule the roost come nightfall.  It had the feel of a place that many visit, but few call home.  The crowd seemed friendly, but I didn't get a chance to chat with anyone due to the fact that two more snarling Black Sabbath tunes came from the jukebox, which then launched into a gruesome barrage of \"classic rock\".  AC-DC's \"Highway to Hell\" signaled an upcoming medley of similar tunes, and the bottom of my glass left me little reason to stick around.\r\n\r\nGritty. Grimy. No sense of history, no unique charm, and NO SOUL.  A feeble attempt at old-world ambiance that's cheaply done and long since worn out.  A gag-provoking jukebox, garden-variety patrons, and the absence of on-theme decoration create an environment that's little more than a dark hole to drink in.  My last visit was the third chance I'd given this place in two years.  Strike one, strike two, SteeeeeRIKE THREE!!! Yer out....", "author": "Mike W."}

Ever.\n\nA recent transplant to the neighborhood, my first and only introduction to Chelsea Place had been hearing the ruckus outside of the bar that generally begins around 11:30pm and sometime doesn't stop until close to 3am. It seemed that something in their drinks  causes their customers to suffer from Voice Immodulation Syndrome; luckily, I have dual paned windows, and frankly all the noise only piqued my curiosity.   \n\nWhen I finally moseyed on over, I was pleasantly surprised by my experience.  The bar had quite a variety of patrons, including a wedding party still in their wedding regalia ordering pizza to the dark back section.  The bar tenders are delightfully snarky and know how to have a good time- including playing 1's and 6's with you to test your luck at a free drink (or buying them a shot).   Plus, they offer free peanuts and popcorn when you need a little something to soak up the juice, though quite honestly I would have much rather had the king crab leg that one of the bar tenders was voraciously gnawing on behind the bar.  Further, the bar offers a pre-January 1st 1995 experience as mentioned in other reviews.  Not that this actually applies to me, but something about it makes it all the smuttier- and I like smutty.  \n\nTo complete this short and sweet review, I affirm all of my supporting points to my thesis sentence are true.  (Did that work?) Finally, in closing, I compel you fine readers of Yelp to give Chelsea Place and it's bartenders your hard earned money.", "author": "Michelle M."}

Wait, 5 stars from Duffman. Why? Please make your way to the bathroom.", "author": "Duffman D."}

Would give 3.5 stars - it would be 4 if the prices actually reflected the divey atmostphere. $5 for a house vodka soda is reasonable but higher than I'd like for happy hour @ a dive. Bonus points for the free peanuts in shell they give you, and friendly Korean lady bartender - she seemed pretty toasted already at 4:30 as she appeared to be doing bourbon shots with the all male patrons seated @ the bar :p", "author": "Sherry K."}

There was an older gentlemen at the end of the bar and me. The bartender was playing the violin and the soda on tap guy was fixing the lines behind the bar. The music from the violin was a very nice addition to the ambiance. Chelsea place looked clean from what I saw and I plan on going back if I'm in the neighborhood.", "author": "D J."}

At Chelsea Place we had seats at the bar, were free to do irish car bombs at the drop of a hat, and free food!  They had corned beef sandwiches and potatoes in sternos, and the nice bartender also made us some popcorn...top notch customer service right there.", "author": "Michelle L."}

I wish I would have looked at some of the reviews to see what we were getting ourselves into. Just kidding! This place was cool and divey- there were asian girls dancing behind the bar as they smoked cigarettes and served you drinks. It was like the San Diego version of the star bar! Everyone seemed friendly- drinks were reasonable- but I know now for sure how much I like bars that they don't let you smoke in.", "author": "Amy C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-02-01", "description": "Been coming here for 15 years and I love it.\nDefinitely not a chick's bar. Say hi to lovely Jennifer the owner and have a drink with her or one of the charming bartenders. \n\nThis is like most of the other Korean bars in the Tenderloin area, but it is frequented by more tourists, which can be fun if you like Europeans. Their Draft Beers are very good, and the Hefeweisen is always served with a lemon, so whenever I am in the city to the North, I always stop by Chelsea Place for a cold one.", "author": "Tim S."}
