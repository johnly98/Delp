My last meal at Zuni had been quite good, and I was looking forward to dinner with my friends. We walked out amazed and decided we will never return.\n\nMy friend, a lifelong vegetarian and I, a vegetarian of recent vintage, ordered the heirloom tomato salad and the gnocchi. The heirloom tomato salad was just not good: a few slices of tomato, deeply soaked in vinegar, with some wilted arugula on top. Puzzling for an institution. And $16 for this -- all right, the San Francisco dinner tax on idiots like us, I suppose, who thought that spending a lot of money on dinner would necessarily guarantee a good meal. I rarely get to go out for dinner, so when I do, I try to go somewhere worth going with a mission I support and where I hope the food and service will make the effort worthwhile. Zuni's reputation had suggested this basic expectation would be met.\n\nAnd so we waited for the gnocchi, filled with hope and longing, but what arrived was the most disgusting plate of something I've ever seen since an accidental plate of Alfredo pasta in the Florida boonies 11 years ago that almost lead to a breakup: a few white balls in a white slime with a couple of carrots on top. We looked at each other and at our companions. What is this? We tried a bite: it was definitely not we, self-described gnocchi experts, know to be gnocchi. Just a few balls of cheese. $19. Puzzling. We told our waitress that we did not find this dish to be palatable, and she said, \"we don't use potato or flour in our gnocchi.\" I couldn't quite tell what she said. Potato flour? Potato or flour? Bizarre. So why label this gnocchi? We told her that neither of us would be able to gum these down, and my friend asked for some sort of a vegetarian replacement. Displeased and without asking me if I wanted anything, the waitress took away these plates after offering to leave them on the table. Why would we want them on the table? Our friends seemed to be enjoying their salmon and pork chop as we waited, and we had to clarify: is she bringing two plates of replacement? Or what? (My friend with the pork chop later corrected my impression: it was \"lame and overcooked.\")\n\nI have eaten gnocchi throughout my life after first trying it in Italy as a child, and I have never been confronted with whatever it is we found on our plates last night. Curious, we waited, and, finally, the replacement arrived: two thin slices of zucchini, a tiny little pile of flavorless beans, a few flavorless green beans, and some sort of a charred, collapsed piece of grassy green. Maybe a leak? I have no idea, as it wasn't recognizable. All of this was either steamed or roasted or both. There was so little of it, and we had so little time left, that I ate it instead of counting the number of beans. \n\nOn our check we discovered this replacement was worth $20. $1 more than the cheese balls in the slime. Yikes. The check said: \"Immigrants Make America Great.\" My friends and I are all immigrants, whether first or second generation, and we certainly appreciate the gesture, but the restaurant's overall mission did not make up for a lackluster, unpleasant experience. I came home at midnight after visiting a theater, where my husband had a delicious meal waiting for me. Thank all that is good and holy for that.\n\n2 stars for the fact that Zuni uses organic ingredients.", "author": "Sasha H."}

It seems like a perfect place to dine for dinner during the holidays. \n\nService and servers were great. We were deciding between a few wines by the glass and they brought us tastings of all three! Amazing, I don't often get tastings if I'm ordering a glass. \n\nSo the classics are Zuni Caesar and the roasted chicken - those don't leave the menu. The rest of the menu changes daily. On the day we were there, they offered scallops as substitutions in any dish with protein. We ordered the Zuni Caesar, scallops as recommended, roasted chicken, broccoli rabe. \n\nZuni Caesar - the dressing is made to order so we were able to request no anchovies in the dressing, which was nice. I thought it was the best Caesar I've had but I also don't particularly like caesars. Great to try and the lettuce was very fresh. I was not obsessed since I thought it was a little overdressed / salty? Would still recommend anyone try this at least once \n\nScallops - loved this! There were 6 scallops in the dish and it came with veggies. Although they may not offer this again, I'd recommend considering their daily specials. \n\nRoasted chicken - takes a while (I think 60 minutes) to come out so we ordered this as soon as we sat down. It was about $60 and says it's for two people but you could share with an additional one or two more people depending on what else you get. Comes with a bread salad under the chicken. Chicken was really good but a couple pieces were drier than I expected. Bread salad was yummy since it soaked all the chicken flavor. \n\nWe also ended with a flourless chocolate cake. The texture and lightness was great but it was a bit too rich for us. We ordered two scoops of vanilla ice cream to balance it but dang the ice cream is overpriced ($6 per scoop).", "author": "Sophia L."}

It is a bit crowded in the walking areas (nearly ran into a few waiters) when you are heading to your table but once you sit at the table, it's spacious enough that you forget about the small space, probably because of the high ceilings.  The ambiance can best be described as \"warm yet chic\".  Service was pretty good; the waiters were pretty prompt despite us being in the way way back of the restaurant.  \n\nFood: mind you, we came here mainly for their famous chicken.\n-- House-cured anchovies with celery, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and coquillo olives ($12) - Loved this combo!  We are huge anchovy lovers and were surprised at how well the cheese went with the strong little fishes.  The celery was a much needed relief taste-wise and texture-wise.  \n\n-- Chicken for Two (roasted in wood-fire brick oven, warm bread salad with scallions, garlic, mustard greens, dried currants, pine nuts)($58) - you have to wait 60 min for this dish, so be prepared to wait for a while.  Don't worry; if this dish has been around since the restaurant opened, it's gonna be worth the wait!  The whole chicken is so juicy and tender (including the breast meat); I'd say the drumstick and thigh were our favorite part!  I also liked how the chicken itself was lightly seasoned so you could actually let the chicken shine.  Mustard greens added a good hit of bitterness to cut the savoriness of the chicken.  While the bread salad underneath benefited from the chicken jus that it soaked up, I'd say this was a weaker element to the dish, especially since the chicken is big enough for 2 people and therefore we barely touched the bread.  \n\nWe also ordered a side of sauteed spinach (forget the price)- we probably didn't need this as much since the chicken came with mustard greens.  That being said, it was still quite tasty and thankfully not so oily / greasy.  \n\nEven after ordering a glass of wine for $12, the bill seemed pretty reasonable, especially given how big / how much effort goes into making the chicken.  \n\nChicken lovers, come here and get the famous Zuni Cafe chicken!  Even if you don't order, the service was excellent and the ambiance is comfy.  Would highly recommend for any person to visit.", "author": "Audrey H."}

The friends I was with had a reservation, so we didn't have to wait, which was nice. We started with drinks, and both the peach Bellini and the Bloody Mary were amazing.

Someone at the table ordered an egg dish that was unbelievable- both my friend and I commented that we'd never eaten eggs cooked so well. The tomato soup and Caesar salad were also surprisingly good, especially the polenta croutons on the soup!!\n\nWe also ordered the infamous Zuni roast chicken, which deserves all the hype it gets! It was perfectly crispy and there was a stuffing-esque bread under the chicken that I think may have been even better. We ate it with the polenta, which just melted in your mouth.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-07-29", "description": "Came here with a bunch of friends. I really wanted to like this place but the service wasn't great and the food was just so-so especially for the price. \n\nFirst impression. We started with drinks at the bar downstairs. They told us we'd have to wait a while for our seats since they were really behind. So we all ordered drinks at the bar. After telling the bartender our orders, it took 20 minutes to make our drinks which seems excessive since there were many people at the bar. At around 15 minutes our tables were ready so half of our group went to the table while we waited for the drinks. The bartender told us he'd need to see the IDs of the other people before he could give us the drinks. We told him the host told us it would be fine but he said he couldn't give us the drinks unless they came down to show ID. We thought that was ridiculous and the host asked what was wrong and said our waiter could check IDs at our table.  \n\nAfter that ordeal I was still optimistic of the food and was hoping it was just a one off. We ordered wine at the table and our server wasn't really helpful at all with the wine choices.  Really at this point the service was just getting worse.  The food came out in random fashion and one of our group didn't get their food for a long time. We asked what was happening but no one really told us. Didn't even get a sorry. We didn't make a big deal about it. \n\nAt the end, the chicken which everyone said was amazing was just so-so. It was tender but wasn't something I'd really rave over.  The extra hour wait for it isn't worth it. Also don't get the soup.  It was really bland. I know they change the soup every so often but probably not worth it.\n\nMaybe I'll try the place again at some point but just really left a bad taste in my mouth the whole experience.  For the price I'd rather try somewhere else.", "author": "Mark W."}

Also, the shoestring fries were not particularly crispy.  The highlight of the meal was the root beer. \n\nService was OK and the ambiance here is quite nice particularly on a sunny day.

The service here is just about average, unfortunately. There were a couple mistakes with my requests and they seemed to be a bit understaffed because I felt like the service was quite slow. When I did see service they were very generous.\nOne also concern was that I could not shake off the hint of a tourist attraction. I get that it's quite popular, but there's just something about this place that really makes it feel like they are just trying to force people in then out. \n\nI did not have a lot of time to try the famous roasted chicken, but that's not to say my meal was not enjoyable. To start, I got the Zuni salad. One thing strange was that it was marked to have eggs yet my salad had no hard boiled eggs whatsoever, a bit misleading. Otherwise the salad was very good, there is a strong presence of parmesan cheese; so your mileage may vary.\n\nThe second course was my main course, the grilled tuna. This is actually one of my favorite entree's this year. The tuna was well-seasoned and the sides with it were divine. The only main issue was that I was served an under-cooked asparagus that was so tough I'd deem it inedible. \n\nFor dessert I had the Pavlova, which I'd get any chance I get. It was delicious.

We were a little surprised at the paper tablecloth covers, though. \n\nWe didn't want to wait an hour for the chicken for 2 entree, so we went ahead with the pork chile verde and the chantrelle mushroom dishes, and started with the ricotta gnocchi with chives and corn,  and the shoestring potatoes. On a positive note, the food all came very quickly, and the cadence of the wine, small plates, and entrees was good. However, neither of us had an \"mmm\" moment at all throughout the whole meal. You know when you take a bite of something so delicious that your eyes roll back a bit and you savor the hell out of it? Didn't happen, unfortunately. It was a lot of \"...eh.\" Bland and nothing special.\n\nThe shoestring fries (which come in an absurdly large pile) weren't seasoned at all, even with salt. They get cold and limp very quickly because they're so thin and the pile is so huge. The gnocchi were ok, but nothing to write home about. The description sounded delicious, but it just didn't come together for us unfortunately. The chantrelle mushrooms were super dry and spongy...not pleasant. The pork chile verde my husband ordered was ok, but not great. It was the dish with the most flavor, but the flavor bar was low with the rest of the meal :/\n\nMy husband says we should go back just to try to chicken that they're supposed to be known for, but honestly i'm hesitant to spend $60 with the risk that the chicken will be just as dry or bland as this meal.

Nothing outstanding about them, but still tasty. We also ordered the shoestring potatoes - once again, really tasty but not outstanding. They're fun to eat though. \n\nFor our entrees we ordered the manila clams in some kind of tomato sauce, a vegetarian pasta dish, steak (I completely forgot the actual name of the dish!), and the famous roast chicken for two. \n\nThe pasta, clams, and steak were all delicious, but I want to talk about the chicken. Before coming here I was very skeptical about it (chicken...for $58???) However, the chicken was extremely moist and juicy, with good flavor. The highlight of the chicken dish for me, though, was the bread salad on the bottom. I would order this dish again just for the warm, crispy bread soaking in chicken juices. With all the chicken, frisee, and bread salad, this dish can easily feed more than 2 people, which makes the $58 dollars worth it when split. \n\nOverall, food was 4 stars.

However my curiosity continued to build and build, and finally I decided to come for dinner. \n\nWe made reservations about a week in advance, and the only time slot they had available was 5:30 for a Friday afternoon. We arrived and were seated promptly at 5:30, only to find out that their dinner menu doesn't start until 6. Until then, the menu is limited to a couple of small bites (including a good selection of oysters) and cocktails. Who knew?\n\nWe both ordered a cherry collins ($13.50) to tide us over until we could order real food at 6. It contained New Deal gin, Cherry Heering, lemon, and club soda, and was a good drink to slowly sip away at over conversation.\n\nThe moment it hit 6, we immediately ordered the chicken ($58) as we knew it would take almost an hour. We were probably the first table to place in our order! I'm really glad we did though, as the chicken took the expected hour to be served. \n\nDid the roast chicken live up to expectations? Surprisingly...yes. The chicken is mostly deboned and served in small pieces so that it is easier to eat, though I still found myself eating with my hands as it was hard to eat all the meat off the bones with only a fork and knife. It's served with a huge mount of mustard greens on top and a warm vinegar-y bread salad on the bottom that was delicious, especially when eaten together with the chicken.\n\nThe thighs and drumstucks were tender and moist, but what surprised me was how moist the chicken breast was! Honestly, it was probably the best chicken breast I've ever had, way better than my attempts to sous vide chicken breast at home. Not only was the skin perfectly flavored, but to my surprise so was the meat inside. Oftentimes the salt doesn't penetrate very deep into the skin and you're left with bland meat, but that wasn't the case here. And the skin, which is my favorite part of a chicken, was roasted to a perfect crisp. \n\nI enjoyed every bite of the chicken, and while we were not able to finish the whole chicken by ourselves, I took a couple pieces home and they were still just as delicious a couple days later (though unfortunately the skin was no longer crispy).\n\nWhile I still have a hard time wrapping my brain around $58 roast chicken (which is really closer to $80 once you add tax, tip, and the 5% SF health mandate...), I can definitely see the appeal and might be willing to come back and splurge again at some point in the future.\n\nService was great, as you would expect from a restaurant of this calibre.", "author": "Dianna H."}

I've heard so much about the roasted chicken with Tuscan style bread salad, this was the perfect opportunity to try it. The chicken actually does take an hour to roast so either don't show up super hungry or pace yourself with some appetizers. \n\nI know, I know. It's \"just chicken\". BUT, it's delicious. It's perfectly moist, skin is deliciously crispy, and although it has minimal seasoning it's executed so well! Friend mentioned between eating other things and coming back to the chicken, if you eat a small, small bite you'll savor it and realize actually how delicious it is (instead of hogging it like I did). It's really clean tasting and no frills. Simplicity at its best. \n\nThe salad though, I felt that needed to be salt and peppered and I wasn't a huge fan of the balsamic-vinegar dressing. I enjoyed the pine nuts, yum. Meh. You won't get a whole salad though, just a few frilly mustard greens. \n\nWe also ordered the little gem salad which is a few pieces of butter lettuce, a couple radishes and carrots. I liked the tangy buttermilk dressing.

The caesar had crunchy homemade croutons and my gem salad had the best dill dressing.

The waiter that was taking care of us let us know right off the bat that 90% of diners choose to go with the Zuni Caesar salad, some shoestring fries to share, and then the chicken. While there were some other tasty looking items on the menu that we wanted to try, we decided to play it safe and we went with his recommendation without any questions. The menu notes that the chicken can take up to an hour I believe, but with a 6:30pm reservation on a Tuesday, we only had to wait less than 40 minutes for our chicken to be ready. The time passes by so fast you won't even notice :)\n\nNow then, let's talk about the chicken, since that's what Zuni is most famous for... The chicken itself honestly isn't the most tender or juiciest chicken in my life, but the dish as a whole, with the delicious bread salad, makes the dish a must get for me. The bread soaks up all the delicious juices of the chicken; I'm sure you'll be wishing you had more bread. Since it was just the two of us, we definitely needed to take leftovers home for the chicken. It's a pretty sizable portion that I expect would be ideal for 3-4.\n\nWould I come again? Definitely.

So naturally I had to try it.\n\nWe had a really cool table right near the kitchen where we could see the chickens coming out of the wood oven. I could hardly wait. \n\nWe checked out the menu before hand and the chicken has a one hour wait time so we immediately ordered it as soon as we were seated.\n\nWe also ordered some gnocchi, a Cesar salad and some polenta so we had stuff to munch on while we waited for this chicken.\n\nThe items we ordered were pretty basic, salad was equivalent to any Cesar at any restaurant. The gnocchi was tasty even though it had the texture more like a dumpling. The polenta was weak, it was super generic, 10 cents worth of polenta with a dollop of cheese.\n\nNow I as we were done eating our snacks all we could do was watch and wait for the chicken, watching was a mistake.\n\nThe chicken was placed on a cutting board straight out of the oven, and the under counter refrigerator right under the cooked chicken station was where they kept the raw chicken. On more than one occasion I witnessed them grab a raw chicken, put it on a plate, then set the plate on the cutting board inches away from the cooked chicken and even closer to the cutting board surface. I even caught a raw leg hanging off the plate and resting on the cutting board. This place strikes me as a really nice place, everything we ate with the exception of the polenta seemed like it was really good quality and organic so having a raw free range organic chicken touch a cooked chicken or the cutting board is not a huge deal but that could change easily with a purchase of some sub standard ingredients.\n\nMy biggest gripe was the wait, damn near the entire time I was watching them cook and carve the chicken they had multiple whole chickens fresh out of the oven just sitting there waiting to be carved and served, the longest stretch for a chicken waiting to be served was 20 min, that's nuts to me if you have an establishment set a president that your chicken will be cooked to order that s**t better be on my table fresh out of the oven, not 20 min later. They might as well just always have a cooked  chicken waiting there for an order so I don't have to wait. \n\nOverall this place did not have the best chicken ever, it did not even have the best roasted chicken.

However, there are certain classic items that have been on the list for decades--Zuni, of course, is famous for their chicken, which takes a whole hour to make, and this is indeed what most tables around me ordered. Having heard all the hype, I had to try this dish (and a host of others) for myself! Coming in for dinner on a Sunday, we were seated with our reservation, and our kind waiter walked us through his recommendations on the menu.\n\nAfter starting with Acme bread, we had the Caesar salad, which was a fairly generous portion of romaine lettuce dressed with Casesar dressing, parmesan, and fresh croutons! This was a really refreshing, umami dish, and made for a great start to the meal. Then we had two additional small plates--the piccolo fritto was a plate of deep-fried romanesco, onions, and lemons, served with a charred onion crema. I found it slightly disappointing--it seemed to be a random amalgamation of deep-fried vegetables without any good balance or surprising flavors. The ricotta gnocchi served with lobster mushrooms, corn, and chives were light, ethereal, and creamy, but they lacked a certain heartiness and umami flavor that come with a good gnocchi dish.\n\nAnd then the chicken! It was indeed perfectly brined and roasted--juicy on the inside and crispy skin on the outside. The chicken is cooked over Acme bread, which absorbs all of the juices, and the bread becomes part of the bread salad, alongside pine nuts and currants, and the whole dish is topped with frilly mustard greens. This was good chicken indeed and executed perfectly, but for me, it was still just chicken and a little hard to justify the $58 price tag. \n\nFinally came dessert--we split the blackberry panna cotta, which was nice and light and not overly sweet. It was served with nectarines and ginger snap cookies on the side--a nice seasonal dish to round off the meal! Overall, Zuni has a great atmosphere and some of the dishes are decent--however, I didn't find the food particularly creative or any of the flavors particularly surprising. Their chicken is definitely good, but the overall prices and value could have been better.", "author": "David K."}

We've been here many times and usually stick to the classics, and maybe that's where we went wrong. Still, quality was off tonight. Ricotta gnocchi tasted/had texture of scrambled eggs (we've had this dish other places and have made at home); salmon overcooked; fritto misto not properly seasoned. Serving of cheese laughably tiny and thrown on the table. Caesar salad great as always. \n\nServer was really nice and obviously green. He left and retrieved tasting notes when we asked about a few Italian whites (fair enough, but not helpful to hear about notes of cantaloupe, etc). Water glasses empty all night.

Water and fresh bread was brought to the table.\n\nI remembered the oysters here are delicious and we ordered a dozen.

Veggies were fresh and the asparagus was especially tender, yet crisp.\n\nWe weren't ready to end the evening and had a glass of port with a Point Reyes Bay Blue w/orange blossom honey.

We were going for the nostalgia.\n\nWe had a late afternoon reservation and asked for a quiet, corner table near a window. The restaurant met our request on everything but quiet. We were seated next to a large and noisy group that had downed a few bottles of wine prior to our arrival. It was likely fun for them but not for us.\n\nWe asked to be moved and it seemed our only option for peace and comfort was the outside patio. It was a pleasant day by the bay, our order was on the rotisserie and we waited patiently as staff checked in. \n\nOnce we settled in and our food arrived, we were happy.

Definitely a great SF institution for a reason! We came in the  afternoon on a nice Sunday, and didn't make reservations so settled for sitting outside, even though it was a bit windy (and dust/dirt particles were slowly making its way into our food and drinks). But regardless, it was still a very pleasant brunch experience! Top notch service! We all wanted the duck entree but there was only one dish left so we decided to split 3 different dishes which I'm so glad because I got to try a variety, even if I didn't leave completely stuffed.\n\nWe shared the strawberry french toast which was very light, airy, fluffy and delicious! Not overly sweet, and the strawberries were perfectly sugared. The scrambled eggs, sausage and pistachio salad was so good. Probably my favorite, because the eggs were just so buttery and fluffy. Finally the duck was so tender, falling off the bone, and I could see why this dish was so popular! We also tried the anchovies appetizer which was adequately good. Also ordered a coffee which was served in a bowl.\n\nSo $40 a person at the end of the meal, but definitely worth it for a great brunch experience. Would return!", "author": "Vivian D."}

A $60 dollar baked chicken- I wasn't sure I'd get it anywhere else, but since everyone said it's the thing here, I tried it- and Ioved it. \n\n\nWe made reservation here at 10:30 and was seated promptly. Unlike other brunch places, this actually takes reservation( which I love love) considering how restaurants get so crowded in the weekend. \nThe restaurant is also located kinda in Hayes valley area- which is great for a brunch walk after getting so much food. There was a farmers market thing going on after we got brunch, and it was definitely nice to be out of FIDI and enjoy a more communal, chill vibe. \nWe ordered oysters and the chicken. Make sure you put it on the order as soon as you get there- it takes 60 minutes to make. But was it worth it- yes! It was so tender and soft the meat feels like it just melts in your mouth. Although it's salted but the flavors are still just right you don't feel an overwhelming amount of saltiness in the mouth- just enjoy the juiciness of the chicken! I think the main selling point of this dish is the juiciness. The chicken can be shared by two but I think an additional appetizer would be good to counter the meat. The Caesar salad here is also good. \n\nThe price came out to be 110 for two easily. \n\nOh next time I'd try the margaritas- I heard it's amazing.

If every restaurant experience needs to be the most memorable meal of one's life, one should not go to Zuni Caf\u00e9. And if one wants a dining that can be described by adjectives like \"hip,\" \"trendy,\" \"modern,\" \"au courant,\" \"cutting edge,\" etc., one should not go to Zuni Caf\u00e9. So who should go to Zuni Caf\u00e9? Anyone who wants a damn fine meal in a lovely room with great service, that's who.\n\nZuni Caf\u00e9 has been on my list since I saw the late Judy Rodgers on television talking about brining meat when her cookbook came out some fifteen years ago. Sadly, I never got to Zuni Caf\u00e9 before Ms. Rodgers passed away, so dining at her restaurant was my priority on my first visit to San Francisco in years. The room just feels very \"San Francisco,\" with the exposed brick walls (so rare in L.A.), large windows, and loft seating. A dozen years ago, the room's late-'80s vibe almost certainly would have seen at least slightly dated, but now it feels classic; the patience to resist a remodel paid off. The long copper bar is stunning, and the bartender was warm and cheery. I had a San Francisco cocktail at the bar - it was interesting but a bit too sweet. I'd get something drier and boozier next time.\n\nWe sat upstairs by the windows with a view of the rain on Market Street. The Caesar salad - a Zuni mainstay, apparently - was delicious, perhaps the best Caesar salad I've ever eaten. The salad comes in whole Romaine leaves, and the kitchen split it automatically for us. My friend said she thought it might be \"a little fishy,\" but to me, that meant it was perfect. The pizza with ricotta salata was simple and elegant; the hard, salted ricotta was shaved over the pizza after baking. That's it. The crust was light and delicate. The famous roast chicken for two was moist and soft and perfect. It came topped with baby mustard greens in a champagne vinaigrette, and beneath was the bread salad - sort of half-panzanella, half-Thanksgiving stuffing - with dried red currants and pine nuts. The bread salad had a vinegary dressing, and it was alternately soft and crunchy. Honestly, it stole the show, so much so that it was hard to pay attention to the beautiful, creamy polenta with mascarpone and Parmigiano-Reggiano, even as perfectly cooked a it was.\n\nService was attentive but never smothering, just right for a place of this caliber. What sticks in the mind is less how awesome one dish or the other is as much as how everything was just executed so beautifully. At Zuni Caf\u00e9, it's about getting things just right, not about being flashy or creating a scene. That's exactly what I was hoping for, and Zuni delivered.

Across the board, I can say the dishes were poor value. Portion sizes are quite small for the price, and not very filling. The courses before the chicken and bread all seemed not particularly memorable, and may not even be on the menu when you, the reader, visit. That's a bit of a downside to hit or miss restaurants with constantly changing menus, they don't have the time to improve/iterate individual dishes. \n\nThe chicken and bread I expected to be a knockout, but it was memorable for the wrong reasons. The chicken was quite moist, probably achieved by a good brining. The skin was not anywhere near as browned or crisp as I would expect from a 60 minute wait. Half the croutons in our dish were burned. I don't mind charred food as much, so these were given to me, but it turned my party off a bit and probably affected my ability to taste and enjoy the rest of the dish.

Not the fault of the restaurant at all, but let's just say it's good that they keep the door closed. \n\nMy friends were very adamant that the 60-minute chicken was the thing to get here, so we ordered that, as well as the shoestring fries, the deep-fried quail, and the brick-oven trout. The shoestring fries were okay, although I personally like fries that have slightly more potato in them. The deep-fried quail was excellent, and the pomegranate actually cut through the richness quite nicely. The brick-oven trout was delicious, although it took me a while to get through all the bones. As for the chicken, it was everything that I hoped for, and the schmaltzy croutons were unbelievably good. The chicken was roasted nicely and quite moist throughout the chicken, even in the white meat.\n\nThe service in general was great, although the host made the really odd suggestion of keeping my luggage underneath the piano. I politely declined, trying to hide my puzzled look. Prices are a little expensive for chicken, but it is some darn good chicken, so it's worth a try.\n\nDefinitely a solid choice for dinner, especially for group dinners and perhaps even for a date.

I feel like I am constantly amidst an existential crisis in my life-hate relationship of this city and its nonsensical yet unique lifestyle.\n\nTL;DR is the infamous hour-long wait for the famous roasted chicken worth it? \n- Yes, if you go with good company. It's a bonding experience that brings back the spirit of good conversation over good food, especially in these busy days of SF where there's a crowd waiting for your table and you feel like a douche staying to chat after you're done eating.\n- No, if the idea of the wait and/or price seems ludicrous to you, or if the prospect of an hour-long conversation would make a distressingly awkward date.\n\nThe roasted chicken is memorable indeed, and it is no wonder it has such a reputation. The prepration in the fire-brick oven imparts smokey, earthy overtones. (It's so delicious that you'll think it's an organic free-range chicken!) Although the texture is bit tough requiring some fork-and-knife technique, it seems the inevitable byproduct of the roasting. You can tell the flavor and succulence have been fine-tuned over the years to create this signature dish. \n\nThe frisee adds a nutty dimension, and the warm bread \"stuffing\" is a guilt trip of a buttery garlic bread. Note that the bread seems to be the same as the complimentary bread, expect I suggest you save your stomach for the heavenly stuffing bread--it's a perfect toasty grilled levain with ample butter, olive oil, and chicken broth for a richly indulgent taste. The portions are big; the roasted chicken is definitely enough for three people (or two starving athletic guys).\n\nI paired the meal with the Domaine Patrick Baudou\u00edn \"Effus\u00edon\" Anjou 2014 Chenin Blanc from Loire Valley ($13/glass), which was excellent. (Fun fact - I'm no wine expert; I choose this because I was amused by the connection with pleural effusion, for any medicine nerds out there ^^) Friend got a glass of rose and we felt classy ^^\n\nZuni Cafe has a long history behind it, with roots as a Mexican restaurant (named after the Zuni tribe). Over the years it was shaped by the influence of the chefs and has now become something of a European-American fusion. The unique split level layout and location on a sharp corner are iconic. Reflecting the history, the ambiance is rustic with wooden fixtures and furniture. However in my opinion, some of the unvarnished and peeling wood by the windows is rather tacky and in need of restorations, especially for a restaurant that's charging $60 for a bird.\n\nZuni is an SF bucket list place: a delightful and unique dining experience, though with its share of oddity in SF rituals.", "author": "Edna C."}

I mean from the rave reviews as this being known as an iconic SF spot, I gotta say: not super impressed. It's a nice central location and the space is really nice, but we found the drinks to be adequate, the food and service alright and everything super pricey. Without a reservation (and good luck making one), the wait was a little over an hour and a half on a Saturday night when we arrive at about 6:45.\n\nThe husband's margarita wasn't awesome at $12. So limey, he winced with every sip. That was on the cocktail list and one shouldn't be wincing when drinking a house cocktail.\n\nWe ended up ordering fries (SO GOOD), clams, extra bread, the chicken for two, caesars salads (all over dressed), the pasta and the pork chop and our table of four all agreed: the fries and the pork chop were tops, everything else was unmemorable. Pair that with 2 bottles of wine and we dropped close to $500 with tip. That's a crap-load of money.\n\nThe bread isn't served warm, which is sad. Actually, now that I mention, most of the food isn't served warm. The pasta was room temp, the pork chop was good, but the accompanied mashed potatoes were cold and sent back. The chicken for two took well over an hour (it does say an hour on the menu, but our was closer to an hour and a half). It actually even arrived about 15 minutes after our dining companions' food with no apology. It's a ton of food, but at the end of the day, it was an oven cooked chicken topped with frisee and croutons. Simple. Honestly, it was good, the chicken was juicy, but it was again served room temp, and not knock your socks off for such an expensive meal. My friend's room temp pasta wasn't finished, she didn't care for it. \n\nThe desserts were ok. The service was fine. None of us were that impressed with anything. We came, we saw, we ate, we left. I wouldn't return and probably wouldn't recommend to anyone. There's better out there, but I checked it out to see what the fuss was about.", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

Each time has been exemplary food and service wise, and I can't count how many delicious roast chickens, impeccably fresh salads and expertly crispy fries I've shared with friends and loved ones over the years. \n\nUnfortunately a recent lunch while very tasty, was marred by very poor service. Server in front of house had a bit of a condescending tone and did not check in on meal, or offer another drink or cocktail order. Glasses lingered empty but the server had enough time to go outside and have a chat with a passerby on the street. To make matters worse, the server offered bread service to every other table except mine. I pointed this out when he finally came around to the end of my meal. The server was apologetic but by then all the other service issues totally soured the experience. Not the $75 lunch service experience one expects at an iconic place like Zuni Caf\u00e9.\n\nI am hoping this is an isolated experience as I visit San Francisco often and dine out for dinner regularly in the area.

Definitely good vibes, cool space, and convenient location from BART, but the food was only slightly above average and everything is really pricey. I was, however, able to make reservations about a week in advance, which is a plus!\n\nI had a cocktail that was called Ginger...Something...because it sounded so refreshing. It was overly sweet and not the refreshing cocktail I was looking for. We ordered two appetizers, the tomatoes and fried vegetables. The tomatoes were really good, but the fried vegetables felt so elementary and there wasn't nothing special about them. They tasted like not-as-good-tempura. \n\nFor entrees, everything was like $30-40. We should've ordered the chicken, but instead decided to order a bunch of smaller plates. We got the arugula salad, caesar salad, bowl of polenta, squid, and gnocchi. I think the best thing we ordered was the gnocchi...but it was only like 10 pieces. I guess given it was half the price of the entrees ($18), I should've known...but also $18 pasta at any other restaurant is usually a pretty sizable dish! \n\nMaybe I'll be back...maybe I won't...but either way, I wasn't wowed by my first experience, and there are a bazillion other places to try in the Bay Area!", "author": "Stephanie K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-18", "description": "It's been over twenty years since my last visit.  The owner and founder Judy Rogers was still the chef, making a name for the restaurant and herself at this unassuming location.\nShe pioneered the brick oven movement for California cuisine in SF back in the 80's and three dishes were often mentioned with this restaurant:  Caesar's salad, roasted chicken, and burger.  My cousin picked this place for a recent weeknight dinner with my uncle.  Street parking is not too difficult on the other side of Market Street, but do remember to take or place all valuables with you or in the trunk respectively; you'll sometimes see shattered glass on the sidewalk as a not-so-subtle hint.  We were seated at an upstairs table overlooking the kitchen which was nice as there weren't too many tables to effect the noise level.\nHere's what we shared after a short menu study:\n\nAppetizers\n1) Caesar's salad (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=xHN8_gPmC2UIHBHCyREx4g&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - One of the best in the City, up there in my books with Alfred's which no is no longer in business.  Not overly dressed and crispy fresh.\n\n2) Burratta (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=NLJObChFJr63wQv63UKhXw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - A personification of California cuisine on a plate with the fresh greens, healthy light, and strong flavors in a simple presentation.\n\nEntrees\n3) Roasted chicken and bread salad (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=rGmTqXKTR3rMgb33xGNkBg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Their staple dish that should never be compared with Costco's roast chicken... this was as I remembered back in the day, tender and moist chicken pieces with amply dressed greens and their bread salad which reminds me of Thankgiving stuffing.  Just get past the price and you'll enjoy this dish.\n\n4) Pork (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Sa85rXRh130oGpmOc1HHPw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Tender but some stringy pieces of pork.  Apologies for not remembering the dish name as I forgot to take a picture of the menu.  The vegetables, cauliflower and squash, were nicely seasoned and not overcooked.\n\nDesserts\n5) Strawberry shortcake (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=JXp7XsrVeAObIi1u104Umg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - With strawberries just coming into season, this was deliciously yet naturally sweet.  The pastry reminded me of a scone.\n\n6) Ice cream sandwich (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=cazUUvSHcdxpFcUYqi5Qbg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - This was a interesting take as it was deliciously light yet the pastry reminded me more bread than dessert and the ice cream flavor wasn't overly sweet or rich.\n\nKudos to the restaurant in maintaining Judy Roger's vision in creating what would define California cuisine in San Francisco.  In other words, don't expect heavy sauces with hearty portions and rustic cooking styles.  Everything is done with a soft hand where you can better enjoy the original flavors of the ingredients whether it be vegetables, protein, or carbs. My uncle took home most of the pork dish home for later meal. \nThe bar was packed with people enjoying their famed bloody Mary's and downing raw oysters.\nGreat spot for lunch or dinner.

But it did not.  The chicken itself was good but not $54 worth.  There's a delicate charred flavor on the crispy chicken skin and the brine meat was smooth and almost silky... except it was slightly on the dry side.  Under the chicken was day old bread that soaked up the greasy chicken juice.  And on top was some mixed greens.  Did all this have flavor town?  Yes but then again, not for $54.  \n\nWhat I did like was the scallop ceviche.  The scallops were thinly sliced horizontally and had slivers of avocado, fresh minced garlic, fresh peas, green onions, I think there were minced capers plus it was drizzled with a generous amount of pure olive oil.  Oh lord!  It was butter in my mouth.  The scallops with the avocado and olive oil made it taste so soft, so fluffy and so smooth.  It was sooo good.  This DID give me an out of body experience I've never had before.  AWESOME!    \n\nThe service was good, we practically let the waiter decide what we should eat.  I thought we had the best seats in the house, which was on the 2nd floor facing the oyster bar and cooking area.  The atmosphere is top notch.\n\nNOTES:  It's stressful knowing that the chicken takes 1 freakin' hour to bake.  So, I wish they would accept our pre-orders over the phone!  We had a show to catch, so, time was very sensitive.  It's an expensive stressful feast.  BTW - day old cold chicken tastes better than fresh out of the brick oven chicken.   You can taste the brine chicken meat and greasiness better the next day.\n\n** Good bye hard earned money... $130 bill comes with 1 chicken, 4 oysters, scallop ceviche, a glass of wine, cup of latte, waiters tip and restaurant healthy tax.", "author": "Jenny T."}

The staff works seamlessly together, and they work the best they can to accommodate.  We went on a day when their grill was inoperative, so we had to look to things we don't normally order.  That turned out to be a good exercise in variation.  The four of us finished our meals, so it must've been good!  \n\nThe Classic Bloody Mary is rich and fresh and bright.  \n\nI forget sometimes that many people like a lot of dressing on their salad.  My Caesar Salad had too much dressing; ask for it light or on the side, or both.  And this is weird, but they offer no \"Chicken Ceasar\", huh.  The French Toast was luscious, and merited the label of \"foodie-worthy\".  The egg dishes were of equal quality and are now on our list of try-again choices.  If you have someone with you that has a less adventurous palate, they could order the Pizza with ricotta salata, tomato sauce, and oregano.  It was very unassuming.  We used it as a hunger-buster first course.\n\nThere is one glitch, though. If you want the Roast Whole Chicken (and I hear it's good!), you have to order it as soon as you sit down.  The menu says it can take up to an hour to deliver to your table, and you can't order it as you wait for your table, and certainly not by phone on your way there.  I think they should do so, even if you have to guarantee it by a credit card.  It would help them sell more chickens, and turn over their tables more quickly.  Just a thought.", "author": "James G."}

The arugula salad was just a handful of leaves with a few roasted almonds. They were hard to share to be honest. The meal came out to over $180 for 3 people. Very overpriced for what we ordered.

The Caesar salad was worth getting as it's a dressing that really coated the leaves wonderfully and the combination was more than the sum of its parts. \n\nWe didn't have room for dessert as the two us already had some chicken to take home.\n\nOverall, a great place for an evening out.", "author": "Madeline S."}

The menu didn't look too inspiring but we decided to try anyway give my the rave reviews. \n\nWe had a great experience and will probably be back.  My hubby shared four courses starting with the prosciutto appetizer.  The tapenade on the side was delicious.  Then it was the root soup and ceasar salad.  The root soup was made with chicken stock, surprisingly delicious and not heavy.  We loved it.  Ceasar was just ok.  Surprisingly overdressed for a nice restaurant. \n\nMain course we ordered was the lamb mixed grill with sausage.   I thought I would just be okay but it was deliciously tender.  Mix of flavor with Brussel sprouts sweat potato, turnip was perfect. Highly recommend.  I asked for lamb medium as I don't like my meat bloody and it came out just right\n\nLast course - ginger honey granites with butter cookies.  Perfect cleanser finish not too sweet and very refreshing.  \n\nBest of all our server Jeremiah was super helpful throughout the meal with recommendations up front and adjusting the cooking instruction of our lamb. \n\nWe had a very nice evening as a result. :-)", "author": "Lei H."}

Honestly I only thought roast chicken could be so good and when I saw the price and the wait I was not into the idea of getting it. My brother really pushed for us to order it, and it was completely worth (in my humble opinion). At least once in your lifetime you should have this chicken like god it was pretty darn good.\n\nSecond tip: the chicken is really good as a composed bite with the greens, bead, and whatever sauce is in there as well. We made the mistake of eating all the chicken and not really noticing the rest of the stuff on the plate. There's a lot of other stuff there too and its really tasty. \n\nWe had the fris\u00e9e salad. Im super into the whole roasted lemon vinaigrette thing so i liked it a lot.

They directed us to the bar for a drink while we wait. I got a glass of ros\u00e9 and my friend got a riesling, which rang up around $24. Before we could close our tab, the table was ready and we were directed towards the back of the first floor. The ambiance is light and simple, very upscale for a lunch atmosphere, but we were in the neighborhood and couldn't pass it up with its rave reviews. \n\nWe ordered some small plates while we waited for our famous chicken to be freshly roasted. My friend was set on indulging in the shoestring fries, but we wanted a salad option to balance that out. Per the strong recommendation of our waiter, we got the caesar salad. It's one of those things that I love but am skeptical to get all the time because a lot of the time it's bad. Just plain bad. But our waiter went into detail about the housemade caesar dressing, and we were completely sold. \n\nWhen the salad came out, it was split into two portions on separate plates for us to share. I love when restaurants do that small step that is so thoughtful. The dressing went above and beyond our expectation. It's the not the thick, creamy dressing you're used to seeing. It was a light and bright dressing with the perfect balance of umami and citrus flavors. Perhaps our favorite part of the meal.\n\nOur shoestring fries came out for us to munch on after the salad, and embarrassingly, we ate the ENTIRE heaping pile of fries in the 60 minutes the chicken took to roast. Went along nicely with my next ros\u00e9, ha. \n\nFinally when our brick oven roasted chicken arrived, it was totally worth the wait. You could tell just by looking at it that it was properly juicy. The bird arrived cut into pieces and we knew we weren't going to be able to finish it after our potato-coma. The sweet currants were the perfect touch to the savory brined chicken. We ended up eating about a third of it and got the rest to go, which made for very delicious leftovers after some (also leftover) garlic pasta. \n\nWhile pricey for a lunch, it was a great splurge meal while in town.

We had a bit of hassle making a reservation since you can only book a table 1 month in advance which appears to be a necessity no matter which night you go if you plan on eating during prime hours. The earliest reservation was 6pm (even though they are open earlier) which, for a 7:30pm show, is kind of tight, but we wanted to try this place badly. I knew from Yelp and 7x7 that we needed to order the famous Chicken for 2. Unfortunately, this takes an hour to cook which would have made it impossible to fit in with our timing constraints. When they called to confirm, I asked if I could put in an order for the chicken so it was ready by 6:15, fully prepared to prepay for dinner so it would be ready. While I thought this was a reasonable request, they refused but said that we could come in at 5:30pm or so and we would get seated. I worked from home and my boyfriend left work early all for this friggin' chicken.\n\nAnd was it worth the hassle and $58? Meh. Was it the juiciest chicken I have had? Sure. Was the bread salad delicious? Yes. Were my socks knocked off? Definitely not. The beauty of the chicken is its simplicity but that is also its downfall. I really see the similarity other reviewers have pointed out to your basic rotisserie chicken. Is Zuni's better? Yes but not for 3-4x the price. I also had a nice glass of Pinot Noir (recommended to pair by the waiter) and my boyfriend had a cocktail which he seemed to like. That being said, with tax and tip added, we paid $110 for 2 people for 2 drinks and a bigger entree. This price isn't TOO bad for a nice restaurant but for a simple roasted chicken and 2 drinks, it just simply isn't worth it.\n\nThe service was definitely fitting of a place at this price point and the atmosphere was really quite nice, especially with the live music later in our meal. However, this was disrupted by the anti-trump protesters walking down Market Street during dinner.

I've ordered all the signature dishes (chicken & bread salad, burger, shoestring fries, etc) and then some, but most dishes do not blow me away. However, the space is beautiful with its floor-to-ceiling windows and their drink menu is extensive. \n\nMy most recent dinner at Zuni is likely my last at this establishment. My husband and I ordered the caesar salad, arugula salad, farrotto, skirt steak and the chocolate gateau (two starters, two entrees and a dessert + drinks). Nearly everything was tasty but service was the worst I've experienced in recent memory anywhere. \n\nFirst, the food:\n- Arugula salad - Light and refreshing, serving size for one. Recommend.\n- Caesar salad - This is huge and should be shared (wish our server told us this!). The dressing tastes classically caesar, but could use a bit more anchovy and more pepper. Good amount of croutons and parm.\n- Farrotto - Delicious. Light and very flavorful.\n- Skirt steak - The horseradish sauce was underwhelming with no kick, but everything else was as expected (the steak cooked to requested temp, potatoes and broccoli rabe). An average meat and potatoes dish.\n- Chocolate gateau - OMG, heavenly flourless chocolate cake topped with whipped cream.\n\nService:\n- Our server was Jeremiah. At first, I didn't notice anything odd about him but it became clear throughout our meal that he was warm and chatty with everyone else but us. He barely made eye contact with us, barely said anything (he muttered indecipherably when he did bother to speak) and his behavior overall was very obviously colder towards us compared to all other tables. I have no idea why he was drastically different with us but it was completely unwarranted. We're repeat customers, were dressed appropriately for the setting, were excited to be dining again at Zuni and ordered a proper full meal. Jeremiah, oddly, made sure to tell another table that they could read about him on Yelp so he clearly looks himself up here. \n\nIn case he's reading, I deliberately left him a paltry 15% tip because he deserved no more. I should've left 10% but since he looks rather old and is still waiting tables, I'll assume he needs the money. I happily leave 20-25% for good service, 30% for great. Jeremiah provided garbage service and I really don't care if I came off looking cheap (I retired at 34, and live and own real estate in SF; I'm doing alright). Screw that guy.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that all the patrons at the other tables Jeremiah was serving were white, and he himself is white while my husband and I are not. Jeremiah's obvious lack of customer service towards us may have been for any number of reasons that I'll never know. But what I need to point out is that his behavior sure felt overtly racist, regardless of whatever his personal beliefs actually are about race. This is especially disappointing considering how diverse and accepting SF is in general; I have never actually been treated this poorly in my decade of living here.", "author": "Jen P."}

Don't get me wrong, I think Kim is absolutely g-o-r-g-e-o-u-s with bodlicious T&As that I would kill for. But I'm not sure what she has contributed to society other than her naked aerobics video and incessantly taking of vain, shameless selfies? *shrugs*\n\nZuni Cafe's claim to fame is their $48 roast chicken which is technically $65 after tax, sf health tax and tip.\n\nYes. $65. For. A. Chicken. http://bit.ly/1qJ6QHl\n\nFive years ago, when I first tried this glorified roast chicken, I wasn't impressed. This time around, it was worse. Yes, the skin is crisp but the chicken is bland and dry (especially the breast). It's accompanied by bread salad that was like burnt croutons with greens dressed with enough acidic vinaigrette to make me do the duck lips. Sorry, but I rather buy 13 [juicy] rotisserie chickens from Costco to feed several needy families.\n\nDid I mention the chicken took 90 minutes? Maybe that's why our chicken was so darn dry.\n\nThere's really not much to say about other menu items as the overall theme with their food is both overpriced and mediocre.\n\nWhat left a sour taste in my mouth is the service. Yah, Zuni Caf\u00e9 is a SF \"hot spot\" but it doesn't give them an excuse to provide sub par and careless service (except for the hostess who was nice).\n\nOne of the busboys brought a dirty share plate to my gf with breadcrumbs. Not just a few breadcrumbs but 60% of the plate was covered in breadcrumbs. We were at a loss for words and just blankly stared at him. He responded, \"it's just breadcrumbs\". Just breadcrumbs? I dare him to say this to Gordon Ramsay. Double dare him.\n\nA fly decided to take nose dive into my cocktail (I feel you, fly...I like getting buzzed too) and I couldn't find our waiter so I alerted one of the wait staff. He said, \"Oh\", grabbed the drink from my hand, and walked off. Dismissive. I eventually received a replacement but some actual dialogue would have been nice.\n\nThen, there were the interactions with our waiter which was off-putting and came off rude. He would ask a question and as we were responding, he would walk away before we can when finish our response.\n\nWHAT THA HEEZY?!?\n\nAfter spending $170 for dinner for two, this is NOT the level of service I expect from such a highly touted restaurant.\n\nOk, end of rant.

No wait which was nice but probably should be a red flag considering how hard it usually is to get into a place for brunch. \n\nOur waitress was rude. We couldn't tell if she was trying to joke, just having a bad day, totally hating being a waitress, or decided right off she didn't like us. \n\nOne of our glasses had lipstick all over the rim. Not a little but, like a \"I question if it was washed at all amount.\" No response when we said it was dirty. This awkward giggle smirk like we were idiots and it was grabbed off the table.\n\nSeveral items of our food were literally dropped in front of us. Like, really? It's that hard to set it down?\n\nThere were 3 of us. They brought us 3 slices of bread after we'd ordered. When we ate those they asked if we'd like more. We said yes. They brought 2 slices. These aren't giant slices. Definitely a 1 slice per person kind of thing. 3 bites maybe. We pointed out that we could use another piece and again got this sort of eye roll, non-communicative responsive and then a plate of like 5 slices thrown on our table a few minutes later. \n\nAtmosphere:\nIt feels worn down. Like it was originally a trendy, cool space but theyre phoning it in at this point. The seating was awful. I was on some sort of sectional type thing where my back was not separated from the back of the person eating behind me. I guess we couldve coordinated our movements to use each other as back rests. A much simpler solution would be seating with seat backs...\n\nFood:\nShoestring fries - bad. they were so small it was like sopping up the crumbs from a normal thing of fries. no graceful way to eat them or put sauce on them.\n\nThe \"aioli\" with the fries - the most bland, blah, stuff ever. it tasted like nothing.\n\nPotato herb soup - wow. that was good. at least one thing about this experience was good.\n\nPolenta - this was my friends bad but the restaurant's as well. It's definitely polenta. Polenta is boring. Why on earth do they serve a portion this big? Imagine a giant bowl of very bland oatmeal. That's polenta. It's corn porridge. Don't order polenta (here or otherwise).\n\nMain course: chicken. Blah. Not worth the hour wait. Not worth ordering at all. It wasnt a bad roast chicken but I can throw one together at home that's far far better. The skin wasnt crispy, not particularly flavorful. Decent at being moist.\n\nThe \"bread salad\" that it came with was absolutely repulsive. Like what on earth are they thinking repulsive. Soggy nasty bread. My best guess is it's all the leftover table bread. \n\nThe chicken and vomit bread came covered in a mound of \"frisee\" that was absolutely repulsive. Between this and the bread it was like they served our chicken with garbage. Not pleased.\n\nWe are big dessert fans. We decided the best treat at the end of our meal was getting out of here as quickly as possible when we finished our food. We all felt worn out by the experience and had to go home for a nap to sleep it off. \n\nWe didn't say anything to the staff. They weren't light fixes but reflective of more structural issues. It didn't seem like they wouldve cared anyway. We just won't be going back.", "author": "Ryan B."}

Corkage is $30 (which seems high for just providing glasses and opening a bottle) but bringing a nice $40-$50 bottle of Zinfandel or Tannat might be warranted.  Our Arugula and chicory salads were tasty but again, not very big.  $10-$10.50 each.  And our entrees of duck (me) and sausage ($20) (my friend) were decent.  For dessert, attached is a picture of a $16 cheese plate.  Each cheese is $8 and no discount for getting all 3 - it's $24.   The bread was the same as had been served with lunch - no crackers or anything - just this for $16.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-08-17", "description": "Zuni Cafe is one of those places that, as a local, you associate it with SF tradition and a place that EVERYONE has been to at least once.  It took me almost 5 years of living in SF to get to Zuni, and it took my parents coming in to town to finally get around to trying the famous chicken & bread salad.  The four of us were seated in their upstairs area, but in the back corner of their secondary upstairs space.  I'll admit, I initially gushed over how charming it was to sit in the cozy little nook. That was until it took almost 20 minutes for someone to come by and take our beverage orders. In wanting to get the chicken order in ASAFP (it takes an hour to make), this already put me into a mildly bad mood. We ordered everything all at once, not knowing when our server would be back, and went with the following:\n\nAppetizers: Piccolo misto, Bellwether Farms ricotta gnocchi with dried capers and lemon zest, shoestring fries  \nMains: Roast chicken & bread salad (shared amongst 4 people), Llano Seco Ranch porchetta with cannelini beans and white wine sauce, and grilled Santa Cruz sea bass with eggplant, squash and okra\nDessert: Nectarine sorbet with brown butter cookies\n\nSo, let's get down to the essentials: the chicken was absolutely amazing and worth ordering.  Having seen it in recipe books, I'm 200% sure that if I tried to make this at home, it'd be an utter failure.  The chicken is tender, juicy, and full of flavor.  And let's not forget about the bread salad, that's literally swimming in the chicken juices, oil, raisins, and lettuce.  It's pretty damn good chicken.  The second item that everyone gushed over were the shoestring fries.  While the mountain o' fries seems intimidating when they put it in front of you, it goes quickly.  And while the ketchup they bring is a nice thing to have, the fries themselves are a little too thin to really dip in to, so I'd safe yourself the effort and just eat them as they are.  My dad had the sea bass, and actually, I really enjoyed it and the eggplant that came with it.\n\nThe not so great part of our experience and why I can't give this more than 3 stars, is the service.  After taking forever and a day to order, we were given table bread that was cold and almost stale, rock solid butter, and absolutely no plates to eat it off of.  So, essentially, the paper tablecloth was used.  As food would come to our table, it was all sort of just plopped in front of us, and even sloshed around prior to you eating it.  My mom's pork jus had been sloshing around the plate before eating it since it was dripping over the sides when placed in front.  Beverage service was slow, and included our server breaking a wine glass by our table without so much as looking to see if any loose shards had fallen in the vicinity. All in all, while the food was good, the service prevents this from being a 4+ star experience.  While I did enjoy eating the chicken and something I recommend everyone trying at some point while in SF, I also know that there are a number of other places to check out in Hayes Valley that provide a better service experience.", "author": "Lisa I."}

We ordered the chicken for two but be sure you do it as soon as you sit down because it takes an hour to make. For real. Now, I'm not sure it was worth an hour wait.. the chicken was good.  Well brined, crispy on the outside (but not really 'fried'), with really good herbs, currants and olive oiled stuffing (bread). And it was more like chicken for 3.. not bad for $48.  It was so much food though that all we had prior was a simple, seasonal persimmon salad and lots of delicious shoestring fries- totally addictive but not too greasy. \n\nWe skipped out on wine and dessert, but I loved the ambiance and I thought the prices were not too terrible.

I had to get up and ask for the check at the bar and wait for them here -- makes me wonder why I felt obligated to tip them.\n\nBurger was good, fresh ingredients but not the best burger. Could be hat focaccia bread is just not right for a hamburger. The sauces and flavors didn't blend all that well, and the meat was just a little greasy, and not actually \"medium-rare\". Was done medium. Also, $2.50 to include 2 slices of tomato seems a bit much, but I'm glad I went for it.\n\nI had heard they take great pride in their service and food before I came here, so I was disappointed in my experience.", "author": "Mark P."}

I do wish my water was attended to as much as my plates were.\n\nWe started with the Crustone with burrata alla panna, cherry tomatoes, anise hyssop, and bee pollen. The burrata was amazing, the sweetness of the cherry tomatoes and the bee pollen really brought this marvelous appetizer together.\n\nThe burrata out with the picco frito (deep fried okra, onions, and eggplant with lemon and Urfa pepper). I am a big fan of okra, so this was a real treat. For those who hate okra's sliminess, Zuni eliminates the slime and leaves behind only the flavor. Nicely breaded onions, okra and eggplant without leaving one feeling like a fatass.\n\nFollowing those two were the Pio Tosini prosciutto with pea shoots, grilled orange tapenade, and pecorino sardo and the Zuni Caesar Salad. The grilled orange tapenade was zesty, tart, and sweet--perfectly complimenting the tang of the prosciutto. The Zuni Caesar Salad was great as it was light on the dressing and not drowning in it like most places.\n\nNow drumroll for the epic Roasted Chicken I've read all about...The chicken was moist and flavorful without packing too much salt, but honestly, Costco's chicken still wins top honors in my book. The warm bread sallad with scallions, garlic, mustard greens, dried currants, and pine nuts that came underneath the chicken was phenemonal though. I wish I could just have ordered the warm bread salad.\n\nAccompanying the chicken were the shoestring potatoes with housemade ketchup. These are so fun and tasty, and the ketchup was tangy and marinara-ish. A small part of me wishes the presentation was better and that they served these in bowls instead.

I went with my girlfriend and we ordered the soft shell crab, the ricotta gnocchi, and the chicken for two. The soft shell crab wasn't good. It had a chili seasoning which overpowered the crab and had an odd taste to it. They split the gnocchi in half so we could share it which was nice of them, but we both had four pieces of gnocchi. The dish was 17 dollars, that means that each piece of gnocchi was almost two dollars......two dollars for a flavorless potato dumpling the size of an almond?! \n\nSo at this point I'm starving waiting for the chicken (which takes an hour to make, why?) It comes and it is okay to say the least. I mean seriously, reading the reviews I feel like I'm in the fucking twilight zone.  First off no chicken is worth $50....it's chicken. If I'm paying that much for one chicken, I expect it to come back to life at the table and give me a back rub. Secondly, I've had MUCH better chicken. Hell I've even made much better chicken. Has anyone who's been here actually cook and understand what making a good roasted chicken entails? Not much. I am flabbergasted as to why people talk about this place. \n\nIf I were to judge this strictly based off the food and ambiance, I'd give it two and half, maybe three stars if I was being generous.

To be honest, I went into the restaurant knowing I may be disappointed because 1. I had probably built up the anticipation of being blown away in my head and 2. some of the reviews on Yelp made me believe it's not all it's cracked up to be. \n\nThat being said, I was actually blown away by the food. I'm pretty sure I made noises while I ate. It was embarrassing to my husband.\n\nThe location is beautiful. You walk in, and immediately are greeted by a friendly hostess. We were seated almost right away; just enough time to take in the gorgeous bar (where people seem to be dressed MUCH more casually), chattering patrons and the piano being played. It is noisy downstairs. We were led upstairs, to the back corner where we were in a quieter, more intimate section, which was nice for a romantic dinner. The lighting and ambiance is perfect upstairs.\n\nWe started off the meal with cocktails (delicious) and a medley of oysters. The server explained all the oysters to us, which I appreciated (but honestly, I forgot which ones were which as I ate them). All of the oysters tasted fresh and better than any oyster I've had when I lived in south Florida. We each ordered an entree - I had the trout, my husband had the pork chop. The trout comes as a whole fish (head and tail), placed upon a bed of wilted/sauteed spinach with cauliflower and sunchokes. Each component of the trout entree was perfectly seasoned, cooked and presented. The pork chop, however, was my favorite over the trout. It came with sliced potatoes and greens, however, the pork chop was the real star. It was cooked in the wood-fired brick oven, so there was a nice smokey flavor to it, but it must have been finished with butter, because each bite I had was juicy, tender and buttery. It was the most tender pork chop I have ever eaten. \n\nWe finished the meal with the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche panna cotta that came with graham cracker crumbles and a berry sauce on the side. It was the perfect end to the evening, and I cannot recommend it enough. The cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche panna cotta is great because it's not super sweet, it's almost savory actually, but still extremely refreshing.\n\nMy only issue was with our server. He was pleasant and attentive enough, however, when I asked him for more information about the oysters selection (there were about 20 different kinds you could choose from), he gave me no guidance at all. The list gives you the location and species, and when I asked him for a little guidance, he said that basically what was on the list was all I needed to know. So I asked him for his recommendations and he said he recommended all of them. When I just stared back at him, that's when he suggested he would put together an assortment for me. I don't know... that was just a little off putting to me, and I wished he would at least have recommended two or three of them or maybe explained the differences in the regions they come from?", "author": "Ashley Marie E."}

Really nice bar area with live piano music.The chicken itself was perfect...no doubt about that. However, I was really looking forward to the bread salad. I guess I imagined it more like a stuffing...which sounded really appealing...but it is definitely not a stuffing. It's cubes of bread and lots of wilted (kinda gross) greens and lots and lots and lots of highly vinegared dressing. The dressing does not lend itself well to the subtle flavors of the perfectly cooked and seasoned chicken. It's overwhelming. And the bread just soaks up all the dressing and...well, it's just WAY too strong. I wanted the bread to soak up the pan drippings from the chicken, not be drenched in vinegar.\n\nThe Caesar salad was one of the best I've had. The anchovy appetizer was passable. The shoestring fries were yummy. We had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert, which was highly recommended by the server, but was nothing special...certainly nothing that you can't get at literally 10,000 other restaurants, including every mall chain.\n\n*Having just recently dined at Le Coq Rico in NY, I can definitely say that the French win again. It's superior in every way. Their appetizers, mostly concentrating on egg dishes, were unique and spectacular. The baby greens with vinaigrette, included with the chicken and served on the side, was delicious and didn't compete with the chicken. Zuni does not serve their chicken with gravy...the gravy at Le Coq Rico adds so much to the experience. It is literally amazing. And as I mentioned before, the desserts at Le Coq Rico were among the best I've EVER had.\n\n*Barbuto comes in second. It also serves a spectacular roasted chicken, but their signature is the herb \"juice\"...not really a gravy, just herbed pan drippings, a most flavorful way to moisten the chicken. Really enjoyed that. I also enjoyed their desserts more, and the atmosphere at Barbuto is really fun.", "author": "Elisa C."}

I can't remember my opinion of them individually,  but they were all a pretty good size and went nicely with the mignonette and hot sauce.\n\nFritto - Fried nicely. Breading was light and crunchy. A pet peeve of mine is when they fry veggies and other things and mix it in with the squid. So you sometimes end up eating a veggie you may not particularly like.\n\nShoestring potatoes - A nice mound of freshly fried potatoes. Served with a little side of ketchup.\n\nChicken - The reason I came here! I had a piece of the thigh which was nice and juicy. But looking at the breast pieces that came out, I could tell they were dry. I asked my friend who ate a breast piece and he confirmed that it was indeed dry. The bread salad underneath was a little inconsistent. There were portions that had good chicken and vinaigrette flavor. And other portions that were dry and tasted like a moist crouton.

The light & lovely Italian \"Rossese\" ($10) was so enjoyable, I took a picture so I could track it down again. \n\nWe could have lingered at the bar all night, but the lack of stools made it tricky (standing bar only). Right on time we were seated at a perfectly cozy & intimate table upstairs and enjoyed attentive but not overly-up-in-your-business service. Zuni ain't cheap, but the service reminds you what you're paying for. \n\nFor dinner, two words: Ricotta Gnocchi. I can't promise you that these melt-in-your-mouth ricotta gems will be on the menu when you visit, but if they are, you must experience Zuni's version of the classic Italian potato puffs. Instead of the dense, overly starchy little carb balls served elsewhere, Zuni's gnocchi are delicate, creamy, and light on the starch. With shaved chanterelles, chives and a lemony sauce, I was very sad to finish that last, mousse-like bite. \n\nZuni is iconic. It's one of those SF hot spots that doesn't feel trendy or hyped. It has clearly earned it's fame. Even if you're able to resist it's bourgeoise charms, you must admit that it's done a fine job tempting us all.  Again, my Clooney reference holds up.", "author": "Nique F."}

Zuni has been an SF staple for so long that it's easy to assume that they've become complacent. Not so, It's fabulous. Known for their chicken (which is yes, fabulous), it's their other dishes that round out this landmark on Market. I know there are many fabulous (word of the moment) restaurants in SF but if I were to recommend one to out of town friends, it would be Zuni. It's well rounded and you're guaranteed to get the complementary call the next day.\n\nI've had the Tuscan chicken, the burger, the pizza, etc. and it's all great. I've been there for lunch and diner. I don't see the need for detailing out the food because it's the whole package that makes this restaurant and nice place to spend a couple of hours. Zuni is on the expensive side but not over-the-top like many other top SF staples. The setup is interesting as you can be downstairs which has the bar area, the dinning room area or upstairs which is open and lively.\n\nNever go away Zuni, you're an SF classic.", "author": "Matt T."}

It's a great place to have a celebratory dinner, the decor is gorgeous and the dinning room has great ambiance. I ordered the Zuni Caesar salad to start. It was good, the dressing had more of a vinegar base which I liked and the croutons were yummy. I also had samplings of the gnocchi which is a must order, they tasted as light and soft as pillows. As a table we got the chicken, which is also quite good. My favorite part was the bread pieces that absorbed the chicken's flavor. It's a generous serving and we easily split among our table of five. I also got the halibut which was quite good. For desert I tried the sorbets and blue cheese.\n\nAt the end of the meal my aunt asked what ingredients were used in the chicken since she has the Zuni cookbook and has made it at home.

I've definitely heard of this place over the years, just somehow never been (you know lived in San Jose but never been to the winchester mystery house...okay another story). Anyway last night we finally made the trek. And I mean we got the special version of getting there. My husband thought it be a great idea to \"stroll\" and I use that term loosely here, from Powell to the restaurant down Market. Maybe other streets would have made this more date-ish, but Market not so much. I will say once arriving to our destination the restaurant is very cute upon walking up sitting on a triangular block, great ambiance once entering. Very cozy bar and even a large piano inside.\nWe were seated shortly upon arriving across from the kitchen side by side at a small table, which usually wouldn't be in most restaurants the best spot. But in this case since the kitchen is open and we would decide to go for the one hour wait on our dinner (as the menu states)  it was our entertainment. \nSo yes, one must on their first visit is go ahead an order their whole roasted chicken for two, which the restaurant are known. I probably should have eaten lunch, not a smart move in my busy day. But with some super crusty bread and a lovely order of Ricotta Gnocchi (split) I survived the wait. And it actually was maybe only 50-55 minutes? We also got to watch the chef in charge of cooking, chopping, and plating all the chickens. He was like a well oiled machine. (All I could think with the amount of chickens me must make every night-day-week, he must hate roasted chicken!). Anyway this kept us busy as we chatted and watched, and the time really didn't seem that long since we both love cooking. Unlike the table to our left who asked \"how much longer\" right as we were seated, and then proceeded to wait another 20+ minutes. Impatient. But then they couldn't see the glorious process!\nSo the Chicken, ah.....Smokey and juicy...divine...dark meat first! Even the white meat, the whole bird was amazing. And that light crispy skin, even if you normally wouldn't eat the skin you must you must! And it was served over a lovely fluffy but crisp (can those two descriptives be used together?) stuffing with pinenuts and currants drenched in a vinaigrette/gravy. Topped with arugula....Ahhhh doggie bag was essential at the end. So delicious. But you know not so crazy filling that we couldn't make a little room to share an after dinner treat!\nWe both agreed on the Buttermilk Panna Cotta with Strawberries. And I have to tell you light and perfect to top off a wonderful dinner.\nAll of our servers were excellent and so attentive.

I had a reservation at 5:15 but they said dinner is open at 5:00 p.m. No problem, we sit down by the bar for their late lunch/afternoon menu. Service is shaky but we flag someone and order the chicken. After 30 minutes or so, one hostess comes by asking if we want to sit for dinner. I said we ordered, and she left. Five minutes later, another hostess (I guess there's more than one) comes by and asks the same question. I said that we ordered, but would like to sit in the dining room. She says we can only do that if we order from the dinner menu. You serve your chicken salad on every menu!!! Technically I did order from the dinner menu!!\n\nThe chicken salad is good. I can see why it's famous and well-loved. It's good, but it's not $48 good. I would say $20-25 tops. At the end of the day, roast chicken is roast chicken, and it's something most people can either (1) make themselves or (2) buy from the supermarket for like $8. Not sure about the $40 discrepancy.\n\nI'm not trying to sound arrogant or demeaning because the chicken was delicious, but it's not something I would get again.

Oysters were super fresh (and the Olympia oyster was bursting with flavor despite its diminutive size). They served a special menu that my waiter was brimming with excitement about. I had a pasta and the world famous chicken, which was unforgettable and has singularly cemented my patronage for years to come. The staff also noticed that I didn't touch my pasta initially (due to an allergy), and graciously and instantly replaced it with a version that I could eat.\n\nSecond visit: Came here for a special occasion. The service was aware enough to realize when to bother me and my friends at the table and when to leave us alone. After ordering about half the wine by the glass list, we devoured enough of the chicken to leave us happy and drunk for the evening.\n\nThird visit: Lunch outside with champagne, oysters, and friends. I never felt as if the service let us linger outside unattended for very long and the oysters were very fresh. The bill for a dozen oysters and a glass of wine came out to around $75, which was more than I wanted to spend for lunch, but hey, it's oysters we're talking about.\n\nOverall, the wine is great, the oysters are great, the chicken is great, and the service is smart, elegant, and alert. Consistency, elegance, and great food and service is what makes Zuni Cafe a place to keep in our list of favorite SF restaurants for some future time.", "author": "Lawrence H."}

First, Christopher waited on us and he was amazing.  He was very personable, and was always a step ahead of us.  He helped us navigate the menu (drink and food) and was a delight to talk with.  I would definitely request his section next time we return.  Moving on to the food, we had oysters to start, the BEST Caesar salad I've ever had, and wonderful pasta, steak, and drinks.  Our table was visited by Rob, checking on us to make sure we were having a good time, which we were.  I couldn't imagine a better night celebrating my birthday.

I'd heard enough about the gnocchi to make my mouth water, but alas, not available at lunch.\n\nWe started with cocktails, and everyone seemed to really like theirs. All I remember about mine, other than enjoying it, was that it was slightly pink and had ginger beer. So...order that one if you can figure it out.\n\nThe other veg and I both ordered the Wagon Wheel pizza. The sorrel was a nice touch, but the overwhelming reaction was, \"Meh.\" Wagon Wheel is great, but it's too mild to stand on its own, and also rather dry. The pizza would be improved, in my opinion, with some kind of sauce for flavor and texture - tomato, garlic butter, just something.\n\nAlright, fine, I'll talk about the stupid chicken. Everyone said I had to try it, but for the whole meal there was an exposed, creepy-looking bone sticking out of the piece in front of me. I just couldn't do it. However - I cast aside my inner hippie long enough to taste the bread salad, and holy shit was that stuff amazing. BTW, they ordered 3 chickens to split between 5 people, and took home at least 1 and a half of the orders. It's a ridiculous amount of food.\n\nDessert was the highlight for me - we all split the gateau victoire (flourless chocolate cake), apple granita, and this other thing with meringue wafers and mandarin oranges (I don't know wtf it was, so just look at my picture). The chocolate cake was fabulous - super rich and velvety. The apple granita was gross, but I just hate granitas - who pays that much for a glorified slushie? Finally, that citrus-wafer-tower thing was divine. Interesting flavors and textures, not too sweet but still satisfying.\n\nI might come back for drinks and dessert, but was really unimpressed with the food. It's a little too pricey to go back if I don't love it.", "author": "Rachel M."}

Then he comes back over, and tells me to move to the small table.  (and by small - I mean s-m-a-l-l !)  I got up with my bags and trudged over to my new small table.

I love everything about Zuni.  The ambience/ambiance -architecture, decor, corner location, huge windows, copper accents, the constant bustle- makes me feel like I'm in a cafe in Paris.  The staff are impeccably dressed and trained, yet there is not 1 hint of pretension; only expert and friendly service.  And the food is always delicious.  Sadly, I only have dined here a few times over the past 15 years, but every meal has been memorable because every item is delicious, including the bread.  A few have griped that the menu doesn't \"experiment\" enough, but when I dine out, I expect top quality in the ingredients and flavor, and Zuni consistently delivers.  This is one of the few places where I eat slower instinctively (which is very hard for me), because I want to savor every mouthful.  The prices are no more expensive than at any of the other high-quality restaurants in SF.  Many of the other restaurants in SF (especially some of the newer ones), are highly overrated: I have left several of them disappointed because although the dishes may have been very new or creative, the flavors didn't match up.  Although I have only dined at Zuni a few times, I have tried completely different appetizers and entrees at every visit, and always left happy.  And, yes, the roasted chicken is worth the wait.\n   So many long-time quality SF institutions have gone out of business over the past decade; I truly hope Zuni never shuts its doors.", "author": "JJ M."}

Sure, the roasted chicken gets a lot of attention, but folks, the burger is the real deal. That's really all you need to know, but if you want to know why? Read on.\n\nStar 1: How was the service and atmosphere?\n\nExcellent. While the 1600 block of Market Street wouldn't be considered by hardly anyone as 'upscale', you forget about all that the moment you walk in the door at Zuni. Hostesses and Servers dressed to the nines compliments a unique multi-room seating arrangement that's brought together by a kitchen that's wide open. It's great. Star Granted.\n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nMy only gripe here is the cost. Yes, at Zuni you pay for the atmosphere and an excellent product, but at the end of the day that premium can only go so far. For a quality, freshly made burger? I put that cap right at $15.00, and thanks to an unusual 4% surcharge that's on top of menu prices, my burger was $16.25:\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QCh42m4-FK7-ewhwxhyI8A&userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg\n\nIf it came with fries? Fine, but it didn't, and I can't quite justify that price for just a burger. No Star Granted.\n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nMarvelous on all fronts. Let's start with the bun shall we? WOW. I'll say it, off the top of my head, this was the best burger bun I've had. ever. Fresh bread with a tinge of salt and garlic butter, I could have eaten it sans burger and called it a meal. I didn't, and that's because the burger patty was tip top notch. Freshly ground, cooked to perfection and full of flavor, this patty proved that Zuni knows that a good burger is only as good as it's patty. The topping were almost forgotten purely due to the majesty of the burger/patty combo, but the onions and pickles proved a nice touch. Well done Zuni, well done indeed. Dual Stars Granted.\n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nBetween chicken of citywide fame and a burger that had me reeling, Zuni Cafe blew me away, and I could easily eat there daily if I could afford it.

The first in our group got there around noon and was told it would be 30 minutes. We got there around 12:15 or 12:20pm. Around 12:30pm, we were offered a TINY 2-top, which would definitely not have been enough room for 3 plates. That meant more waiting, and we didn't get sat until about 1pm.

He could not have raved about this more! I thought it was good, recommendation-worthy, but not as amazing as he made it out to be. Every part of this dish was cooked perfectly, almost too perfect and pristine! The mashed potatoes - smooth texture, flavorful.

Zuni blesses an otherwise blighted part of Market Street and the customers there all seemed happy, familial. They even have live piano music as you dine.\n\nI'll even go as far as saying that I feel like a failure to haute cuisine society for not enjoying Zuni's food. I want to apologize to someone, but I also couldn't shut the word \"overrated\" out of my head, especially since we paid nearly $100 for something so underwhelming. \n\nOn paper, the menu was delightful. The options all seemed incredible. But I didn't get the memo that, unless you order the chicken, you're basically doing it all wrong. I ordered a blood orange and arugula salad and the pasta dish with a fava bean pesto. The pasta was tooth-chippingly al dente. Cutting through one of the little shapes showed that it was still party uncooked. They were gracious about swapping it out for a bowl of tasty polenta, no hesitation, but I was told that the pasta is \"just thick\" which is why it felt like chewing cud when I tried to eat it. And polenta and salad for dinner kind of sucks, no matter how you slice it.\n\nI've said enough, but if you, too, didn't get what the hype was about, I'm just validating that this wasn't a place I'd get excited about returning to.", "author": "Lara W."}

My favorite were the squid salad and margherita pizza. The squid salad was just such a unique dish. The squid was perfectly cooked and sliced into perfect little circles, the peppers added just enough crunch and slight heat. The dressing was light and tangy. The  margherita pizza consisted of a thin, crunchy crust topped with freshly grated cheese not melted cheese.  I've never had pizza like this and it was fantastic!

Everything else I have had on Zuni's menu is 3-4 star level food, and they are usually small dishes or salads, apps, etc intended to fend off starvation while waiting for the chicken.\n\nSo- the chicken- is ALWAYS 5 stars+.  I appreciate it very much as this dish hasn't eroded or slacked off for the past 5-6 years since I first tried it.  Juicy chicken, soft and buttery warm baked bread chunks, pine nuts, currants, and mustard greens as a garnish.  I wouldn't go to Zuni without ordering this, and when I book reservations at Zuni its solely with this dish in mind.  The other items we ordered on our most recent visit were all good to great- a GIANT caesar salad, a creamy polenta, and a gnocchi dish.  However we were foolish to order this much as it detracted from our available capacity for the chicken dish.

The building is beautifully cool, the room has an electric buzz of happy patrons dining and drinking away, the menu is short and concise, but still interesting, the libations are esoteric and quite tantalizing... The reason for 4 stars is that for this delicious slightly elevated comfort food you pay way too high of a premium. I mean chicken for $58? I scoff.\nWe started with the Nebbiolo and a Pinot and had the house cured anchovies. They were delicious with olive oil, lots of lemon, yummy slices of cheese, celery and itsy bitsy olives. They went great with the housebaked bread they bring you. Next we moved on to the incredible Caesar salad. I am telling u, it is a creamy garlicky standout not to be missed!! We then moved on to the salmon dinner which was pretty average, the polenta with parmigiana and marscapone which was in desperate need of the salmon and it's seasonings, the linguine and clams... A bit salty but good, and the gnocchi which came as a very tiny portion for $18.75.\nThe desserts were sublime... We had the gateau victoire and the pluot cobbler... And a glass of pineau des Charentes. \nThe meal was very enjoyable, but the bill at $216 or so was way too high for the portion sizes, etc. If Zuni Cafe were just a tad more affordable it would leave a much better taste in my mouth...

They did make a new salad which the maitre'd or host or someone else brought (also without an apology) to the table instead of the waiter\n-also messed up the french fries, which my mom had requested to be without salt. No apology, no correction\n-ALSO messed up my mom's trout order.

Throughout the rest of the meal, any time the waiter came by, he wasn't very friendly or helpful.

My friend and I had lunch here before seeing Phantom of the Opera at the Orpheum (walking distance, only about 1/2 of a mile).  We had a really fun time!  The ambiance is great and it's very trendy.  The food was good, not \"knock your socks off\" great, but pretty good.  I was dining with a vegetarian, and we were sharing so the choices were a little more limited.  When I come back, I'll probably try the burger or the chicken for two. :-)\n\nWe shared 3 items; the endive salad with figs: small portion, would have been great with some goat cheese or something, but it was good.  The polenta with mascarpone, it was pretty good.  And the basic cheese pizza, super thin crust, very light, but tasty.  The best part of this dining experience was the ambiance and the delicious cocktails!!!  The Elderflower was good, but the lemon drop type drink (can't remember the exact name, but you can figure out which one has vodka and lemon) was delicious!!!\n\nI only give a full 5 stars if a place is perfection in all areas.  But 4 stars is a great rating too.  However to explain the 4 star rating:  I really loved the bus boy, Jordan.  He served bread and water and cleared plates and replaced silverware, etc.  He was FAR more pleasant and personable than our waitress, Katie.  She was barely adequate.  She never went out of her way to talk or be pleasant or suggest items on the menu or ask \"how are you ladies doing today?\" or ANYTHING.  And I expect great service at a restaurant, especially THIS kind of restaurant.  (Sorry Katie, but that is the truth).

It's about as definitive a San Francisco dining experience as you can possibly have, and it continues to thrive no matter what new eatery hogs the spotlight. I hadn't been in many a moon until last week when I was having a hankering for something nice after the Yelp Elite soiree down on Valencia. Taking a chance that a table might be available, I got lucky and got the little bar table right behind the piano player. No, I didn't heckle him or yell at him to play Vince Guaraldi's music from \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\". I was tempted though since the warm, lofty ambiance made me want to do the Sherman shoulder dance on that brisk evening. Y'know, the one where he pulls his shoulders up to the beat as he shifts his head from side to side.\n\nIt was only medium-level crowded for a Thursday night, so it was as ideal as you could get for such a popular watering hole. Even though I was hungry enough to eat the roasted chicken and bread salad for two ($48...ka-ching!), I was way too cheap to consider such a humiliating gorging. Instead, I ordered the $10 Zuni Caesar Salad, which probably was a trendsetter at the time it was concocted but was honestly just a good, hearty Caesar with fresh spears of Romaine lettuce (see photo). Jamie W. finally got out of his neighborhood meeting and was able to come join me at that point. He ordered the $15.50 Spaghetti with Rapini, Pancetta, Red Onions, Garlic, Lemon Zest and Pecorino Romano (see photo), a modest plate filled with robust flavors that were quite satisfying.\n\nMy entree was the $27.50 Grilled Sea of Cortex Grouper with Radicchio, Baby Leeks, Faro, Chanterelle Mushrooms and Sage-Lemon Oil - a lovely piece of fish that was nicely contrasted with the faro and the sauteed vegetables (see photo). Between the big wedge of country bread (see photo) and the $6 mountain of Shoestring Potatoes, you would think that would be enough high-end food for two people. But alas, we were on a Zuni roll, so we tried a slice of the Sierra Beauty Apple Tart with Creme Fraiche and Caramel Sauce (see photo), which we had the gall to think was too small. We also thought the creme fraiche tasted more like sour cream than whipped cream giving the meal a somewhat tinny ending. No matter as Zuni still evokes that wraparound feeling that makes me wonder why I don't come back more often. Oh yeah, it's kinda pricey.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...still classic American cuisine pretty much copied everywhere else somewhat to their detriment \nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...cozy, lofty vibe despite the crowds\nSERVICE - 4 stars...pretty attentive\nTOTAL - 4 stars...I've been Zunified", "author": "Ed U."}

Yes, it takes an hour to prepare but just tell your waiter right when you sit down that you will be having it and they just put the order in before they bring you drinks. This makes the wait FAR more bearable. \n\nI had read the polenta was really heavy and not that worth it but I have to say that this really wasn't the case. It was excellent, delicious, and a very appropriate starter, as was the baby arugula salad that they had on the menu that night. \n\nThe chicken was superb, with an inventive and wonderful burnt bread salad beneath.

I understand this cake has no flour whatsoever but, when I tasted its crumbly, airy consistency, I seriously could not believe it.\n\nOur waiter was awesome, the setting was beautiful, and the smell of wood smoke filled the air, wafting down to the well-appointed bar.

And it's perennial inclusion on SF's best list (usually for their roast whole chicken) is a testament to the strength of this restaurant as well. \n\nInterestingly, I've never had the chicken and I may never. The fact it has to be shared for two (thus limiting the entrees you can order) and that I've brined at home makes it less tempting than so many of their other menu items. \n\nService is spot-on and I love the warm ambiance as well as the two floor dining.  Our choices for lunch:\n\nBalsamic Bloody Mary - holy cow was this good!  I'm a big bloody Mary fan but have not been exposed to the sour sweet combo of balsamic vinegar.

Loved the Humboldt Kuma. \n\nWood oven pizza - the wood oven is a gem (it's where they roast the chicken for 1 hour) and the pizza is wonderful from there as well.  Great Cowgirl Creamery cheese, fresh onions, and a wonderfully thin crunchy crust. \n\nGrass fed burger - it was cooked slightly more than I requested but the Zuni pickles and focaccia bread were top notch. If there's any criticism, I don't like that the nickel and dime you for the cheese, grilled onions, and mushrooms. \n\nHouse cured anchovies - tasty.

Absolutely Delicious.  The Burger itself was actually really delicious as well.  Yummy Beef. The homemade pickles were also quite excellent.\n\nA word of warning (which I was actually really excited about): they cook them on the rare side.  I actually really like my meat RARE, but I always feel weird ordering it rare, so per usual I ordered medium rare - and then surprise surprise it came out and it was really much more like rare!  I was stoked! But, if you are more a well-done person, maybe order more done than you would think.  \n\nThe shoes string potatoes were also nice and crispy!\n\n$16 for a burger?

Nice ambience. Great service.I don't know what's wrong with all the tables, all of them were rocking!! I think the roasted chicken is overrated and overpriced. Been there a year ago. Me and fiancee both had chicken and we were like OK it's chicken, nothing special, nothing magical about it. No secret ingredient or sauce!  Just plain chicken. A little bit greasy , it was a lot thu and we couldn't eat much so we took the rest to go. They put some basil and other veggies around it to make it look different, baloney!  our check came at $85 for chicken for 2 and a glass of wine, But it's SF, expensive is the norm there. If u wanna try this place, don't order chicken and order something else. If u r craving roasted chicken then buy one for $8 from staters bros and save $72 cuz it will taste the same.", "author": "Mohammed B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-11-06", "description": "So I work for this company that has this Founder who is a regular at Zuni. Every time he takes a client, staff to lunch or dinner in the city (San Francisco), he almost always recommend/take them to Zuni. After observing his consistency of his attendance at Zuni, I remember asking him a few months ago, \"is Zuni that good?\" A gracious man he is, \"yes! Have you been there? We will go there one day for lunch or dinner!\" And here we are, months later I finally got the opportunity to try this place out. And what better of a person to try it out than Dr. Garcia (Doc -as we like to call him) the regular.\n\nPARKING:\nSo, if you follow my reviews, you know how much I dread looking for parking in San Francisco. I mean, that is the reason why people sell their cars and invest in bikes after moving to the city. Luckily, it only took me minutes to find a parking spot on the street. Then again, it was a Tuesday (yesterday) night. So far, the evening is looking good!\n\nLOCATION:\nThis restaurant is located on a street corner with tall glass windows and warmly lit. And when I say, \"warmly\" I meant the ambiance is very cozy and pleasant. When the Boyfriend and I walked by, we saw people completely packed the place. I thought we might not have a place to sit. Not bad for a Tuesday night eh?\n\nUPON ENTRY:\nWe saw our Founder at the front podium talking to the hostesses. Very pretty might I say. They smiled at us as we entered and approached Doc. He immediately lead us to the bar. As we make our way through the cozy space to the bar, we were greeted with smiles by every staff member there. Amazing.\n\nINTERIOR:\nIt's pretty small and narrow. The tables and seatings are pretty close together, but the layout works for this unique place. Tables are close together, but enough room for people to walk through. Pass these tables, you arrive at the beautiful bar (very welcoming). Here you have a little standing room, but it is probably beacause they kitchen is located right behind you so foot space is necessary. There is an upstairs area which I have yet to check out. Pass the bar and kitchen entrance, you walk into another area with booths. Neat! This is where we were seated.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\nOnce we were told our table was ready, we were escorted by the hostess with a tray for our drinks. She placed our drinks on it and lead us to our table (reminded me of that 'As Good As It Gets' movies when Helen Hunt was about to get seated and a guy offered his tray for her drink so that she doesn't have to hold her drink to her table. Pretty awesome). Everyone smiled, presented a professional mannerism, even the bus boys were nice and polite. They're on top of their game, after every dish we finished, they were there in a minute to clear it out for us. We were always given clean utensils after every usage (that's crazy).\n\nFOOD:\nWow. Doc ordered a lot of dishes for us so let me see if I can remember them all. We started with 6 different flavors of oysters. I can't remember all of them, but I do remember my favorite: Drake's Bay. However, they were all freaking delish! I didn't know you can make oysters taste different flavors! \n\nThen, we began our dinner with the Zuni Caesar Salad. I never seen it served a whole leave of lettuce before. And it was perfectly dressed with caesar dressing with a nice large crouton(s). Normally caesar dressing packs too much of a punch so I often request it on the side, but I have to say, best caesar salad ever. So simple but definitely hit the spot.\n\nOur came the Bellwether Farms Ricotta Gnocchi, and honestly when I heard Doc order it, I had no idea what he said nor did I know how it was going to look like. But, just the fact that I've seen him cook at work, I trust his choices in the foods. There was enough for each person to have three Ricotta Gnocchi. Wow, the most tastiest, softest little things ever! (uhm, excuse me, can I order a bucket full of this?) I even asked for the boyfriend's share (I was kidding of course, but he ended up giving me the last one anyways -yep! I'm spoiled!).\n\nNext our chicken for Two Roasted in The Brick Oven came out. This I have heard Doc kept on repeating to our waiter. I was curious, what this was. Anyways, finally our chicken came out and it the presentation was gorgeous. Doc served us each a piece. I even grabbed some of the dandelion greens and stuffing. So tender, juicy, full of flavor and to top it off -I didn't even know pine nuts can be so good with chicken! This must've been their signature dish because our table wasn't the only one that ordered it.\n\nDoc ordered us some short ribs as well, and the meat was soft and juicy. Not touch like I would expect it to be. I'm not usually a fan of short ribs but these were to die for.\n\nVERDICT:\nI have tasted many great foods before, but the thing here that won my attention was the costumer service. Smiles everywhere, I love it! Maybe it was because we were with Doc (their regular). Yes, I would return here -soon!", "author": "Cathy N."}

Their menu is super seasonal and changes daily, but the chicken is a mainstay.. which we will have to get another night.  We had a lightlly fried semi-asparagus app which came with this.. green pine cone sauce (WHAT) which was really good. There was a clam fettuccine that was fabulous, really simple but just perfect. We ordered the goat leg, which was the first time I'd really seen goat in a nice restaurant where it was pretty rare, and it was SO chewy. I couldn't handle it, our jaws were hurting. I don't know if it's just goat or the leg or what. The flavors were good though. We ended the night with a gateau victoire, which was really light (the waiter's selling point) and we kinda wished it was denser.. but still very cocoa-y.\n\nA couple bumps in the road food-wise, but also a couple really nice dishes.

I'd tried, a few times...In fact I think I've had reservations THREE times before but each time had to cancel for random reasons.  Well, last night was my night and it was worth the wait.  I've been hearing about the rotisserie chicken for nearly a decade, so my friend and I got that.  Perfectly seasoned, so moist, so good - and the \"bread salad\" was very flavorful and \"solid\" enough that it didn't trigger my extreme distaste of what I call the 'wet bread texture.'  The women next to us had said that the bread salad was the 'best part' and they might be right, it was almost as good as the chicken.  We started our meal sharing a Caesar salad (on which the dressing was DELICIOUS) and ended the meal with the pot de creme which was perfect.  We'd nearly been tempted to try the gnocchi but as it turns out that these three items were perfect for two people.  In fact, my friend saved her last piece of chicken for take-home and I wished I'd done the same as I left a little fuller than I wanted to.  All in all, a great experience worth the wait.  Our waiter was very helpful, too, I should add.  Oh, and  I made the reservation a week early but we were there on  Super Bowl Sunday so I don't know if that meant their reservations sold out more slowly, or what.

I asked my cousin to book a place since I didn't care where I was eating - as long as we got to catch up. We came to Zuni Cafe one lovely evening for dinner. We had made reservations for our meal here about two nights prior and they were easily made. Our party of four was easily seated once we came in.\n\n[decor]\nZuni's ambiance doesn't really have anything going for them. It's not really pretty-looking. It seems a bit run-down, but maybe because the building is old. There's a lot of light from the windows. Weird seating area for the diners. There's a second level for dining as well, but looks a bit as cramped as the rest of the resto. A bar is available and has shelves of liquor. I'm surprised that the hobo's hanging outside haven't broken the windows for some booze =X\n\n[devour]\n*OYSTERS ($2.50-3.75/each, ***4 STARS***) - Zuni has a laundry list of oysters! Out of all the ones we tried (~3/person), we were quite fond of the DRAKE'S BAY OYSTERS (from Point Bay). This was recommended by our waiter and I totally agree with his recommendation! I don't recall the names of the other oysters we tried, but they weren't as memorable as the Drake's Bay! =) \n\n*CEASAR SALAD ($10, ***2 STARS***) - The \"infamous\" Caesar salad didn't really seem to amuse me. I thought the dressing on the romaine lettuce was lacking some \"oomph\". Sorry I wasn't getting the hype. BUT!!!!! I did LOVE THE CROUTONS, which were very garlicky, buttery, and crispy - just the way it should be. I just wanted to eat all of the croutons instead of the greens =X ...... and I hate to say it, but I've had better Caesar salad in Portland (Yes, I'm talking about 23 Hoyt and Apizza Scholls).\n\n*SHOESTRING POTATOES ($6, ***3 STARS***) - was your typical run-of-the-mill fries. They are skinny in size, so you can devour more of them. You get a good pile of the shoestring fries, that it's good to share with about 4-5 people. Fries were decently cooked. It came with a side of ketchup. The dish was just a wallflower in my book. Also, it can easily get cold and after a few minutes, it won't be as appetizing after 20 minutes. \n\n*PORK CHOP ($28, ***3 STARS***) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zuni-cafe-san-francisco?select=3Q4JjgM9Cb_TLGgZjKvAUA) - the pork chop was sadly dry on one end, but tender and succulent on the other side of the bone. Although, most of the chop was well-done and was kinda difficult to manipulate, it did come with flavorful sides - greens and some-what-lookin-mash-potato-dish (can't recall names). I would have rather gobbled up the sides and call it a day. The au jus by the chop was very savory! Everything on the dish was excellently prepared, minus the pork chop..... kinda torn if I would eat this again.  \n\n*ROASTED CHICKEN FOR TWO ($48, ***4.5 STARS***) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zuni-cafe-san-francisco?start=300#y9HIlZT_CvbiXwHzsqS_RA) - I think this is more like roasted chicken for 4 or 5 people! (unless you want leftovers, then it's good for two). If you're thinking about ordering this dish (ORDER IT ONCE YOU SIT DOWN) since it will take 1 hour (yes that's 60 minutes) for them to roast the thing! \n\nThe chicken is roasted in their brick oven for one hour. It came out very moist and succulent. You would think that the breast of the chicken would turn out dry, but I was AMAZED it wasn't! This dish is served fam bam style and comes with a warm bread salad that has chopped scallions, greens, embedded with dried currants and pine nuts. I must say that I loved that bread salad WAYYYY more than the Caesar. I wish they had the bread salad alone as an appetizer. So if I loved everything about this dish, why wasn't it 5 Stars? Well I wish the skin of the chicken was a bit more crispy. Then again, nothing is perfect! It was a good piece of chicken! Way better than your Costco rotisserie my friends! \n\n[drank]\nA glass of their red wine (ranges $8-11) was nice and paired well with the roasted chicken. \n\nFYI =\n-They charge 4% to your bill to support the \"SF employer mandates\" (so glad PDX doesn't do that!)\n-Party of 6+ will have an automatic 18% gratuity\n-Complimentary bread & butter: expect LOTS of bread crumbs (mess alert!)\n-Great service (water glasses attentively filled)\n-Full bar available\n-BYOW? Cork fee $20/bottle\n-Parking on the street (metered)\n-CC's accepted (Visa, MC, Amex)\n\nAlthough there are mixed reviews about Zuni Cafe, my dining experience was also mixed.

But from start to finish, dinner was an exercise in chaotic futility. Our waiter didn't appear for a full 20 minutes. When he did, he never apologized for the wait. Our courses took about 15-20 min to arrive, with the infamous roasted chicken taking the requisite 1 hour.\n\nThe food itself was okay but nothing to rave about. The squid with pesto was the best dish we got. The polenta with mascarpone was bland and forgettable. The roasted chicken? The perfect example of a culinary \"the emperor has no clothes\", in my opinion. People, there is nothing about this chicken that is \"world famous\" or \"unique\" or whatever other hyperbolic descriptions you want to give it. It's as tender and juicy and salty and tasty as the stuff you could get at Safeway, except Safeway's is half the price and has zero wait time. It's served under a bed of raw frisee (seriously?) and over a bed of soggy bread salad that has little to recommend it besides too many scallions. And that's it. That's all you get for $48 and a minimum one-hour wait time.\n\nDespite the disappointing app and entree, my friend and I still would have entertained staying for dessert, but that decision was made for us the minute the already way-too-loud restaurant allowed a mariachi band to play at maximum volume. Picture Zuni Cafe with its many little dining rooms that anyone with the slightest knowledge of acoustics knows are very conducive to amplification being abuzz with a full house of diners on a crazy Wednesday evening. Then picture a mariachi band with several trumpet players performing just below your table with mics attached to their instruments. The noise was deafening. You literally could not hear anything else. I looked around at the many diners around me and all I saw were grimaces of discomfort and annoyance. \n\nOh, and a lot of covering of the ears.", "author": "Josephine L."}

We all shared the strawberries with yogurt, caesar salad, french toast, shoestring potatoes, and a lamb pasta. The shoestring potatoes never end! The lamb pasta was the best dish out of the five. Funny story with the strawberries with yogurt -- after we read the description (with the dried rose petal, bee pollen) I think we had imagined a huge bowl of yogurt with sliced strawberries and large rose petal in the middle, but when we got the dish we laughed because we were surprised at how tiny the dollop of yogurt was... and we could barely tell there were dried rose petals in it. It was still delicious but keep in mind the portion size is very small :)\n\nThe ambiance is also nice & the restaurant had a lot of natural light.

I ordered the pork dish...the concept of the sauce and such was great but the pork was a bad cut and terribly dry...which they tried to cover with extra sauce...didnt work.  For a $34 plate,  they should have had tenderloin, something braised or at the very least,  a well cooked piece of whatever it was...\n\nThe appetizers were incredibly small...the Gnocchi was quite good but the Anchovies, while decent,  were hardly worth the little scraps they put on the plate.\n\nMy wife ordered the Squab and if anyone knows squab,  they have painfully little meat...coupled with almost no sides,  I wonder how the Chef thought this was a reasonable meal for someone paying $32.  Very disappointing, cheaply made and not at all thought out.\n\nOne gets the impression that they are simply trying to squeeze money of you...and that they do very well!  But soon not worth it.  Afterwards,  we were left hungry and disappointed with the quality of the food.\n\nThe one bright spot was our server.  He killed it...but alas,  that will only go so far.  Maybe they had an off night or whatever but honestly,  I wouldn't even go back for a second try considering the price to quality ratio...its just not even worth it.  \n\n\nOn top of all that,  they claim to have to impose a 4% surcharge to pay for their employees additional expenses...ridiculous and offensive to any lover of good food and a great restaurant experience.", "author": "Andrew S."}

Yup, you read it....bread salad.\n\nOur trip to the great city of San Francisco started off with this one place that was 'sworn' as the 'best' chicken ever. Honestly, after waiting an HOUR for a chicken at $48.00 that had minimal taste, served cold and skin no longer crispy....with a very well behaved 7 year old and an exhausted boyfriend brought on a feeling of 'why did we just get this cold chicken?!'...we were tired and starving to the point of ordering the kale soup...which was served WARM....\n\nOne a side note, the couple next to us must have been VIPS or something because everyone was falling all over them to cater to them. I was tempted to ask if their dinner was warm. However the man and woman looked to be intoxicated and were eating nothing but oysters...served on the rocks....so their dinner should not be served warm nor hot.\n\nNote to establishment, you want to charge $48 for chicken at approximately 4 or so pounds....serve it hot.\n\nTreat all customers the same, same attention and same respect.\n\nDrop the pretentious attitude and the notion that you are above everyone else. People are people and if they come to your place of business then fair treatment is what we expect to pay for.\n\nWill I return and try this place again? Maybe....\n\nDo I suggest this place to my friends and family? Absolutely not....\n\nFor under $5 I can make the same bread salad, chicken and serve it hot to my family and friends....with a smile and sans attitude....\n\n**Update-So glad the last time we came-we avoided this place! Guess what? For a bit over twenty bucks-I was able to recreate the bread salad and made my own chickens at home better than ZC and hey Yelp Gang-THE FOOD WAS HOT! Also-I made the chickens into Cornish Game Hens. No fighting for breasts, thighs, wings...etc. $20 bucks-free parking-best wine in house-down to earth service-no rushing and most of all-intimate.

First off the restaurant is LOUD, forget trying to having a conversation...the acoustics are just terrible. Second, service sucked. I can't stand servers that wait until the end of your meal to kiss your ass for a tip. Our server, bc it's SO LOUD, totally missed all the oysters I ordered and only 2 were brought...of course he rarely checked on us so it wasn't until my entree was ready to come that he was able fix his mistake with the oysters. The server doesn't run the food, so the least the server could do was come and check on us as soon as the dishes are brought to the table, which he didn't do. \n\nAs for the food. Not at all impressed. A tip about your burrata and figs, those figs should be warmed they were just cold, cut and thrown in the bowl...the burrata was terribly bland and frankly the combo of flavors between the figs and the burrata did not work. We had another app, but I'm blanking on what it was...clearly it wasn't memorable. I had the pork confit and duck sausage, the sausage was amazing...but overall the dish was plain. 2 small rectangle cuts of pork and one small link of sausage on top of a veg with some white beans, all for $34. I don't mind overpaying for a small entree when the flavors and presentation are amazing, this dish had neither of those.

And the bread salad that came with it... now I love a good zesty vinaigrette but the salad tasted like it was drenched in straight up balsamic vinegar; there was no balance of flavors. The (dubiously) good news is $50 chicken for two is a fair price, considering most single-serving chicken dishes at comparable restaurants go for $25ish elsewhere in the city. My dining partner and I ended up taking most of the chicken home and shredding it up for noodle soup the next day.

Let's just break this down for a minute. The cheap Asian in me says, that's equivalent to 8 rotisserie chickens at Costco! (or as Darryl P pointed out \"that's 2 pork chops at nopa!\") needless to say, I won't be ordering this anymore next time I come to Zuni. (unless I'm here on an expense account)\n\nZuni cafe still has room for improvement. Their cocktail menu doesn't impress me (good thing we brought wine) and I feel their dessert selections were ordinary. I was expecting a restaurant of this caliber to have better looking dessert options on the menu, but we weren't disappointed with a classic creme brulee. \n\nThe service is friendly and unrushed. Perfect for catching up with friends in a classy, relaxed atmosphere. Zuni Cafe is a San Francisco treasure, so expense account or not, make sure not to miss it.", "author": "Janice C."}

One of the most perfect meals I've had - I came in for lunch with a friend on a late Sunday morning. We strolled in with no reservation and were surprised when they sat us right away. We ordered a bottle of white wine, enjoyed some oysters and shrimp to start. Super fresh, super tasty. And since the chicken takes 45 minutes, we ordered that right away. While we waited, we enjoyed the simple but delicious Caesar salad (and a plate of fries). And the chicken...I usually don't like ordering chicken because it can be kind of blah, but the Zuni Chicken is famous for a reason - juicy, crispy skin, tasty bread salad. Just perfect", "author": "Stacie C."}

Sure, it's tender, but the skin tasted burnt, with no trace of any herbs or spices. Everyone at the table raved at the warm bread salad underneath, but it tasted more like warm oil salad to me. \n\nMain dish disaster aside, the apps were actually pretty awesome. The Piccolo Fritto featured sharp, bitter puntarelle with silky-sweet wildflower honey to draw out the bitters.\nSilky little Nantucket Bay Scallops tasted like they went straight from the ocean onto my plate, and the deep green spinach lightened the butter sauce.\nThe Risotto was more of a soupy rice than the expected ricey soup. It swam in a chicken-stock-like-soup, and those plump grains of wild rice were actually pretty mind-blowing.\nThe first three are great, but feel free to pass on Rymee's Finocchiona. The finocchiona is tasty, but despite quality over quantity, it's just a smaller, more delicate version of your childhood sandwich topper. The salad with chicory and sunchokes is crisp and crunchy, but it's really just sliced roots.\n\nI love Zuni, and I'd be crazy not to. The ingredients are top-notch and the menu has at least 6 words I can't pronounce and far more I can't define. But the dishes are really a compilation of good things rather than a combination.

Famous for their chicken but needed 60 mins, decided that a burger is a good way to judge what the kitchen can do ... sadly not good !  For starters, Foccacia bread always just seems wrong for a burger (too much bread), as do those \"shoestring\" fries ... just not a fan, they get cold super quick and kinda awkward to eat, you gotta shovel them in to get a decent amount. The burger itself was kind of bland, not cooked well for med-rare, I LOVE and appreciate Grass-Fed meat and maybe that was it, just not enough fat to make it interesting ... burnt and crisped meat isn't healthy but once in a while that's OK for a burger, their meat seemed barely cooked, this just didn't deliver. The Avacado Crostini & salad were great, wine by the glass expensive but some really great bottle options and amazing prices if you're a Burgundy fan .. worth the visit on that alone.

He wanted to go there to celebrate his 50th birthday with his family.  It was an ordeal getting a reservation for 7 and then they made me fill out a form that, if all 7 people did not show up, they would charge me $25 per person unless I updated them 48 hours in advance.  I had to give them a credit card number and sign and fax the form.  I called them 3 times to let them know that we were celebrating my partner's 50th birthday and to make sure they were up to date on how many people would be there.  \n\nUnfortunately, the service was not what we typically expect from Zuni.  It took forever to get our drinks and our salad orders were mixed up and we had to trade plates.  Plus, I had told the waiter I wanted wine with my dinner but was halfway done with my dinner before he ever came to check on us.  By that time, it was too late to order wine.  Very disappointing service.  To make things worse, they did nothing to recognize my partner's birthday (even though we were opening presents at the table).  I was insulted that they made me jump through so many hoops to get the reservation and I called them 3 times but they did not even bother to acknowledge my partner's birthday.  \n\nThe food is still good but the service is obviously declining at this San Francisco institution.", "author": "Bob K."}

I have been looking forward to it for quite some time.  Everyone's made it out to be pretty epic.  'You gotta try the chicken, man!'  'Bread salad is to die for!'  Okay, roger that.  Choo choo, all aboard the chicken train!\n\nSo how'd it all pan out?\n\nCan't say I was super impressed, but it was pretty decent overall. The bad: Got seated in an awkward nook upstairs where the acoustics were terrible.  The noise from the kitchen and other patrons below really carried up and made conversation a bit more strained.  It was also uncomfortably warm even after removing layers.  Truth be told, those are the only minor quibbles.\n\nThe service was excellent and the four of us all ended up having a good time.  The wine was flowing and the dishes were coming out at a perfect pace.  Can't remember exactly which appetizers we ordered, but I do remember having a large number of rather tasty olives and indulging in a creamy vegetable soup.\n\nWhen our chicken finally came out, we were ready to destroy it.  It was cooked well enough, but not quite the crispy-caped superhero chicken that I was hoping it would be.  I was able to query my mental database and easily returned no less than three places (including home made) where I had superior or equivalent chicken of similar preparation.  Then again, it is just chicken--how tasty can chicken+skin possibly get?  Bread salad?  Sure, it was good, but there's a reason it sits under the chicken as its faithful sidekick.\n\nAll in all it was a good time, definitely a fine dining experience.

Over and over again. Salted flesh. The salads are salty small dishes that taste like hospital cafeteria food. This food is not complex, but feels churned out and way too thrown together to warrant any standing in the upper reaches of the SF food scene.

After hearing about it over and over again, that is precisely what I did while heading to the Napa Valley for a music festival. Since I was flying into SFO, my friend and I figured we might as well make a night out of it. Alas, with her driving and me feeling the jet lag coming on, we didn't get to truly toast to the occassion, but an Abita Root Beer and Reed's Ginger Brew *almost\" made up for that fact. \n\nKnowing the chicken takes almost an hour, we ordered immediately and had plenty of time to take in our surroundings and catch up. The restaurant itself is big and airy, with huge windows and a cozy feel. Would be perfect for a romantic date nigt. As for the chicken, it is as good as they say, however the bread salad it is served on top of is almost as good! My friend and I were fighting over the last pine nuts and currants, and the mustard greens were about as far from bitter as you can imagine. We also ordered the shoestring potatoes on the side, because who can eat chicken without potatoes? They were fun and tasty, but nothing especially memorable. They were more fun to eat than anyhing. They sort of reminded me of those potato stix in a can that I loved when I was little. \n\nThe price is fair and you will likely never have a better roast chicken.

It was only based on the breathless recommendations of our friends, and the excellent salesmanship of our server, that we caved and did it.\n\nIt didn't disappoint. The flesh was soft and juicy, the bread was melty with all the chicken fat, the currants were tart and sweet, and the ricotta gnocchi we ordered on the side was re-donk-a-donk delish.\n\nOh and did I mention the bartenders are great and don't mind being asked to make something like a whisky drink and a margarita had a baby?

Having been to Boulevard, our other SF benchmark, the previous night, we were primed for extended dining bliss.\n\nBottom line--the food, as usual, never disappoints.  The Caesar, the chicken, the oysters, all hit their mark.  \n\nHowever--for the first time in 40+ dining experiences, the service disappointed big-time.  Side plates for bread & appetizers were doled out only on request.  The bus boys had itchy trigger fingers & wanted to clear our table ASAP.  No time to linger over the last bits of dessert.  Our server became progressively less-attentive once our entrees were served.  We were seated at 5PM & the place was far from full.\n\nOur advice:  don't go to Zuni w/ more than a 5-top or your server will check out knowing they're guaranteed 18% minimum for the large party. \n\nOur total spend equalled our Boulevard tab the night before.  Unfortunately it was less-than-well-earned at Zuni.  When you're willing to drop $500+ for dinner (we brought the wine) you should reasonably expect 5-star service.", "author": "B. A."}

It is well worth the 45 minute wait. The greens and the panzanella just add to the dish. But the real true measure of the restaurant is the salad. So simple and yet so hard to make delicious after we have all had it a hundred times at bad chain restaurants. It's redeemed here. I have had other dishes on occasion and they have been good as well. \n\nZuni is a true SF institution that is still operating at the top of its game.

Not recently. \n\n I live in the neighborhood and my wife likes it so we go and ignore that it is way overpriced tourist bait. Usually the food is served fairly cold.  The place is on two levels and like most larger places they struggle to get it to you quickly. I get that. It's a destination and 90% of your value is that you're eating at Zuni.  Some of the tables even have a view of the restaurant . But they really don't try very hard. Why bother, there's a line after all. This is like some of the \"best\" places in any city, Paris to NYC to here.  Long line, no real value for the price. People show up anyway. \n\nToday my soup was so hot , (surprising as hell for a place that puts out so little effort.) that I burnt the #%*! out of my mouth. I was shocked because getting food that isn't ice cold is generally a challenge Zuni isn't up to. So I burnt my mouth and couldn't eat my soup. Kind of my bad. I mean, I probably should be open to them serving hot food for once. I must have looked pained because my waiter asked what was up. I explained and he did his job. Apologized. Offered a different dish, etc. really did it right. \n\nThen the manager came over. He explained how as a first timer I probably didn't appreciate how they made each dish to order and sometimes they might be hot. REALLY? Apparently condescension is the new apology. Waiter earned a 30% tip. Manager eared them this 2 star review. \n\nSo I don't mind that you're a mediocre  restaurant in a nice space.  Or that you make mediocre food. But please, don't treat me like I'm the asshole for showing up any paying for your overpriced operation. I mean, I AM the asshole for showing up after such poor food every time I've been here, but PLEASE don't treat me that way.

Since I believe in the City and its food,  I made a reservation to meet up with a friend and her son for lunch at Zuni Cafe.\n\nWe started with a Caesar salad and the broccoli di ciccio and Manila clams a la plancha with Rancho Gordo white beans, lemon zest, and garlic.  The Caesar was tasty with a fantastic garlicky, anchovy dressing.  And those beans were just off the hook.  Smooth and delicious.  Both dishes were so good, I used the bread to sop up the plate so I wouldn't miss/waste any of the flavors!\n\nBut there was something else we really came for.  For years I'd heard of and wondered about this dish.  I even felt inferior as a native San Franciscan for never having tried it.  Even 7x7 Magazine seemed to remind me of this inferiority by listing it high on the Big Eat every year.  Unfortunately, on previous visits to Zuni, it just didn't feel like the thing to order.  Maybe it was the company or maybe it was because I was there for brunch during those other times.  \n\nNo matter.  My friend and I were here now and we were both here for the roasted chicken for two with warm Tuscan-style bread salad.\n\nOhmigawdOhmigawdOhmigawd YUM!  \n\nThe chicken was juicy with fantastic crispy skin.  My friend and I inhaled it in.  The Boy loved it also.  The bread salad is indescribable.  There was a crunch to it but it was also soft.  There was currants and pine nuts mixed in. We all loved it.  The presentation was beautiful before we started in on it.  And I don't care what they say.  The dish is not for two.  There were 2.5 people working on it at the table and we almost finished half of it.  My friend and I split the leftovers so technically it fed 4.5 people.  \n\nAnd I no longer feel inferior because I have eaten what every native San Franciscan should at least once in their lifetime.\n\nWe also ordered the bowl of polenta with mascarpone that went very well with the chicken.\n\nAll in all, a great meal and a delicious way to renew my belief in this City and its food.", "author": "J.

Many clearly love it, but I found my chicken to be bland and the bread salad soggy and unimpressive. It was definitely not worth the hour-long wait. We did order an appetizer that I can't recall - it was a cured fish plate - but I remember it being very flavorful. The service was quite adequate, if unremarkable. The restaurant's design is uneven, in that the ground level is very beautiful but the extensions on the upper level can be - at random - cramped or spacious, have a decent view of the street or look directly into someone's living room. \n\nObviously, a restaurant so well-regarded must have its strengths.

Secondly, did they know I can make a juicy chicken about 80% as good as theirs for about $6? If $6:80% and $48:100%... then they are way, way overpriced.\n\nI did not think their arugula beet avocado salad was too great.. and they were stingy with the beets and avocado, and the salad cost me $8 or so.\n\nI also did not dig the slightly soggy bread and the very bitter greens that went with it. I would have preferred my greens be arugula and on the side, tossed in dressing. I would have also preferred the bread nice and toasty on the side, with my option of dipping it into the chicken juices as I liked. But admittedly, overall, their chicken was pretty good.

We are taken to our table which was a tad awkward, sitting next to each other on a strange angle. We asked to be moved to another table so we could talk better and without a problem we were seated at another table. No problem at all.\n\nWe started with drinks, fries and olives to tide us over while waiting for the roasted chicken for two (takes aprox an hour).  The fries are delicious and can be eaten daintily without looking like a starved prisoner. Thin, crispy and salted perfectly. The house-made catsup is the perfect accompaniment.  The olives were buttery and divine, a splendid mix. The conversation was so fantastic that before we knew it, an hour had passed and our chicken arrived. A wood oven roasted chicken, cut in pieces on top of a Tuscan style bread salad with currants and pine nuts and topped with greens - it was a thing of beauty. The chicken was moist all around, even the breast. Each piece had a caramelized, brown skin that was well seasoned and crispy in some parts. It was everything I had dreamed of and more! So worth the wait - which doesn't seem like a wait at all if dining with the right person.\n\nDessert is always the same for me here - the G\u00e2teaux Victoire. Hands down the best flourless chocolate cake I've ever had. Not heavily dense and fudgy like most, it almost seems as though it's steamed like an English pudding and not super rich and chocolatey. Perfection.\n\nAn epic lunch indeed with one of my best friends. I'll remember this one for a while.\n\n* Just a suggestion for the restaurant...If a reservation has been made, it's probably best to seat them at a table where the guests are looking at each other and save the side-by-side seats for walk-ins or single diners.", "author": "Katie S."}

My parents and I were super ready to have this amazing, legendary and extravagantly tasty experience that everyone and their mom who has apparently gone here for 30 some odd years is talking about...but that was not the case :( \n\nLet's start with the good and the only reason this place gets 2 stars - the service. The service was good, we got seated fast and the ambience was nice. That's about it.  \n\nNow for the bad - the FOOD!!! \n\nAt first, the waiter placed waters and a small plate with 3 pieces of bread (because there were three of us) and a small plate of a slice of butter -_- fine...whatever. \n\nThey asked what we wanted to order, so we order a $40 bottle of wine and then the food. I noticed a few things in the restaurant which should've been a red flag - first there's a painting of a woman eating a piece of cardboard (ok....) and then I noticed a couple sitting with a bottle of wine eating a plate of fries.....for dinner :/ \n\nAfter we got the food, I regretted not asking for more bread...\n\nThe portions are teeny tiny! The menu doesn't have too much to choose from and at first I ordered the duck but then the waiter came up to me and said it's an appetizer and there's nothing really to eat (what?!?!) ...and then I understood why he said that when I actually got a main course instead (which was quail). When I say the portions are tiny - they really really really are. I'm a 98lb 4'10\" human being...I ate every single crumb on my plate and was starving! My quail had 4 small pieces of quail with 1.5 little potatoes in some sauce. \n\nThe only nice part is that we were laughing hysterically because the whole thing was pretty ridiculous, considering a main course costs a minimum of $30/plate - you'd think there'd be some food on it. But just to give you an idea of what the \"sea bass\" plate contains (we ordered 2 of them)...it's a small helping of sea bass + 4 lima beans - yes 4! and a small artichoke cut in half..\n\nSince we were still hungry and a bit upset we decided to go for some dessert to raise the mood. Each desert is approximately $9-10 and we ordered 3 plus 2 lattes. \n\nWe were literally hysterical when we got the lattes! First off they were in soup bowls and extremely watered down (maybe because they filled a soup bowl with coffee) and the desserts were teeny tiny (just like the food). But at least they kept filling up our cups of water (maybe in hopes of making us feel somewhat full??) \n\nWe ate the dessert and asked for the check ($200 for 3 people) swearing to never come here again. \n\nThank you but no thank you Zuni.", "author": "Diana T."}

We started with two appetizers - the raw oysters and the deep fried figs and onions. Oysters were good while the latter was mostly onion rings and at most 3 figs split into halves. We all agreed that while we liked fresh figs, deep frying them didn't make the figs better but rather masked the sweet flavor of the figs. \n\nFor the main course, I tried the ricotta gnocchi which tasted like eggs. The ricotta was very subtle. My friend who also ordered the same dish referred to it as \"fake gnocchi,\" but to be fair our server explained that the gnocchi wasn't made with potato.

Added a couple of selections of cheese (with honeycomb,) cuz they say the chicken takes an hour (a little less,) a couple of glasses of Pinot, and there was no problem with the fact that the Butterscotch pudding had left the menu...who gets six stars anyways?  No valet at lunch so, park on the opposite side of Market.  ZUNI...Go again!", "author": "Vince C."}

Yet I took you for granted and said \"I'll try their roasted chicken\" someday.  Well, on the eve of the last day of the last day of my birthday (40) month, I finally showed up with my good friend to try your illustrious roasted chicken and salad, and I was so happy!!  \n\nFirst I had a couple glasses of the Zuni Pinor Noir - niiice!!  We had the burrata over eggplant - mmmm!  With the first bite, we looked at each other in astonishment!  Next we had the gnocchi - now I had an ex-Italian boyfriend who knew how to make gnocchi and I always compare.  Zuni's gnocchi was exquisite - mmmm!  Also hit the spot!  \n\nTime passed quickly as we chatted and caught up on life, and then the famous, listed roasted chicken over salad arrived.  I broke out clapping aloud and cheering.  The server didn't seemed daunted, this must happen a lot.  \n\nWe were hungry, we attacked the chicken, salad, pine nuts, all of it -- it met all expectations.  Tasty, tender and a perfect balance with the salad, pine nuts, dressing.  We kept talking and appreciated the taste of our lovely main dish.  \n\nFor dessert, we had the bourbon ice cream with drunken peaches and oatmeal cookies - perfect!  Also with a Italian digestive!  \n\nMmmm!  Service was friendy, gracious, and understanding.   We thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience from beginning, middle to end at Zuni Cafe.

The cocktails were quite good. We had some olives and some fried veggie app. There was a dark green olive that was probably the best olive I've ever had. Unfortunately there were only a few of those while most of the rest were a kind that was nothing special. The coating on the fried veggies was exceptional. I'm not a big fan of fried okra, but I think you could've put anything in that breading and made it palatable. \n\nWe shared the roasted chicken which is every bit as good as advertised. Juicy and flavorful, If you're reading this while deciding where to go, you should have enough of an advance to order it when you arrive and save complaining about the wait. It was pretty oily which likely accounts for a lot of the flavor, but expecting lean cooking at a gastropub is like expecting the bread salad with this dish to be a healthy salad. On that note...bread salad? Wow. It's like a fork-worthy bruschetta, with strong notes of balsamic. It was plentiful with half leftover, and it was good the next day. We ordered  the Gateau Victoire for desert in order to reverse the idea that we should stop eating since we were full. I thought it was great.

First, I love the name--a fascinating native American tribe in western New Mexico.   A great enigmatic name.  \n\nEach visit for lunch or dinner is reminder of pure goodness and a great solid execution.  The service is sterling and friendly, attentive but not overly so--it is always at the right level.  \n\nSan Francisco restaurants are often very similar a left and right seating zones--like entering a theatre.  Zuni is unique in lightness and space.\n\nI like to visit and enjoy Zuni family style--to taste many dishes and get a full feel of the entire menu.  My last visit included:\n\nThe fennel and arugula salad was perfectly dressed with small slices of Mandarin oranges.  \n\nLlano Seco Ranch fennel sausage with Japanese eggplant, roasted tomato cro\u00fbtons, and persillade - a perfect plate to share; a wonderful item to enjoy before the chicken dish.\n\nChicken for two roasted in the brick oven; warm bread salad with scallions, pine nuts, garlic, dandelion greens - don't listen to the negative comments. This dish--takes an hour--it is worth the wait--how many restaurants in San Francisco are okay with you waiting an hour for your second plate?   Succulent, delicate flavour and the bread salad is a perfect highlight--a rotisserie chicken dressed in greens--satisfying, superbly well prepared.  Who knew how non-fried food could be so good.\n\nThe portions were perfect--not too big and not too small--I sampled a wide array of foods and recommend a family style approach to taste a varied array of foods.  \n\nI enjoyed everything from simple things like the plating, focused menu, service execution and the menu layout--especially dessert menu.

We had the undivided attention of our server and the kitchen staff.\nWe were almost seated at a bit of a cramped table to begin with but I spied a lovely looking window table and asked if it was available and it was. I was really glad to make the switch as it was really nice to sit there and watch the world go by as we ate our lunch. The bench seats were the most comfortable I've ever sat in and we were quite relaxed during our Zuni experience.\nI had really wanted to get the roasted chicken but I didn't realize that it takes an hour to prepare so we settled on other dishes from the lunch menu. \nOur server let us know that there was only one serving left of the day's special which was meatballs on polenta and that would reserve it for us if we wished. We did! Though we weren't exactly clear on whether or not it was a starter or a main...\nWe had to have another platter of oysters because they are the one of the best things to eat in SFO. So we had the oysters and meatballs to start off with. We each also ordered a main and a cocktail.\nI had the sage sausage with asparagus and potatoes.

I love chicken.  I eat chicken almost every night of the week and routinely order it at restaurants over more popular steak or fish options.  Good restaurant chicken typically has crispy, salty skin and amazingly moist meat.  It's this contrast of crunchy outside and juicy inside that makes a great chicken.  Zuni Cafe's chicken was dry, tough and flavorless.  The skin had a horrible smokey taste.  The meat was VERY dry; I haven't had chicken this dry in a long time.  Maybe I caught them on an off night, but it was the Saturday before Christmas so you would expect them to be on top of their game.\n\nThere were only two of us, so we only ordered the caesar salad and the chicken dish.  The salad was fantastic, the chicken dish not so much.  To top it off, once you order the chicken you are basically waiting for 1 hour while they prepare it.  During that time our waiter didn't come by and check on us or offer more drinks or refill water.  Our waiter was no where to be found once our meal arrived, as I was going to ask for a steak knife to cut my dry, tough chicken.  It was a strange experience to wait so long with so much anticipation and then be totally let down.  \n\nOverall, the restaurant has great ambiance and a good wine and cocktail menu.  If the other items on the menu were as good as the salad, this could be a very good restaurant.  However, the service and the chicken were not great so I probably won't give them another shot.", "author": "Rob F."}

I had dinner there this week and the prices have skyrocketed. The famous chicken is now $54.00! That's 3 price hikes in a very short period of time. When I asked why? Another price hike? The waiter, who was great, said it was because of the $15 per hr. Wages. Hmm ok. I ordered the roasted pork also very expensive, and not good. Grey overlooked and bland. I also noticed that there weren't as many choices on the menu as in the past. Hey Zuni's if your gonna charge these prices, better get it right every time.

Seeing that he is the type to choose chicken or steak at these fancy restaurant, I chose Zuni Cafe after reading all the reviews about their \"Chicken for Two\" at 48 dollars. \n\nWe made reservations through open table and were set for Friday night on Memorial Day weekend. We arrived a hour ahead of our reservations due to a starving boyfriend. They gave us the option of sitting at the bar area seats. We did not mind. Hey, if you have to wait an hour for the chicken, might as well get seated earlier; they do not put in the order for the chicken until you are seated. \n \nMeanwhile, we ordered the shoe string fries that were six dollars. It was abundant and tasty, a nice divergence. Also, as a huge oyster fan, I ordered a dozen oysters ranging from miyagi, kumamoto, tomales bay, and kushi. They were very fresh and delightful. They range from about $2.50-3.75 each. \n  \nOur chicken finally arrived after my boyfriend eagerly awaited, constantly checking his watch.  Overall, I am sorry to put this bluntly, but it tastes like rotisserie chicken similar to that of Costco. It came with a vinaigrette salad mixed with baked bread/crouton. Therefore, I must give this dish an A-OK.  \n \nAs I anticipated from reading the prior reviews, the service is slow. Not the worst that I have received though.", "author": "Becky Q."}

I would give it 3 because their french fries are oysters are a 5 but the main courses there were a 0, thus a rating of 1.\n\nFor $30.00 I had the Tuna which was the thinnest and weak pink looking tuna I have ever seen at a restaurant that is supposed to be at this level.  Clearly the lady who wrote the cook book is not controlling the quality any longer and I have heard this from others who ate there and won't go back.  My daughter had the duck.  The 4 tiny pieces were extrememly thin like roast beef in a sandwich and looked almost as thin as my tuna!  1/8 inch which was a complete rip off.  It should have been called an appetizer platter because the portion size was ridiculous for the price.\n\nWe also ordered the sea bass which I have never experienced fishy sea bass but this had a very prominent fishy smell,  We were in a rush to get out of there for a show which was down the street and the waitress was gone so much we ended up asking for things from another waiter who was walking by.  Our waitress had no enthusiasm about the restaurant and couldn't make a single recommendation when I asked her about the menu.  Everything was \"Oh yeah that's good.\" and so I just believed her everything was good.\n\nWell everything we ordered was HORRIBLE!  Cold, and cold fish is just gross.  The only highlight was the french fries which were fantastic, as I do give praise where praise is do.  They were crispy on the outside, and the portion was nice and large so we go to eat french fries for dinner because the other food just didn't fill you up (due to the tiny thin pieces they give you of meat and fish).\n\nSAVE YOUR MONEY!!  We spent more hear than many better places in San Francsico.\nWe used to always go to Espetus right down the street for Brazilian Barbeque and thought we would mix it up as we have never been here.  Sorry we wasted our money hear and we'll be back at Espetus which for the same price you get all you can each salads, 15 different meats, and a wait staff that is top notch.   \n\nSorry, to be blunt but this place just sucks when it comes to main courses.\nGordon Ramsey would have been gagging in the garbage bucket when he ate the fish, especially the cold tuna which was tasteless.\n\nRussell H. and Jeffrey Y. are very accurate.

Who doesn't enjoy watching the kitchen as they prep and plate the meals! \n\nThey bring you bread and butter once you sit down, but I highly recommend you ordering some appetizers to pass the time and hold you over. We had some oysters and the shoestring potatoes. The oysters were your normal fresh fair, and the fries were perfectly fried and salted.\n\nThe baked chicken lives up to the hype and raves everyone mentions on here. It is definitely worth the long wait. The chicken is super juicy, even the breast pieces which is normally always dry since it's so thick. The bread and salad that accompany the chicken is super flavorful and compliment the chicken wonderfully. The bread is brined and soaks up a ton of flavor. Be aware the chicken is $48, which might be a sticker shock since everything else on the menu is about $20 or less.

The main reason I came here was to try their famous chicken bread salad, which was on SF's Big Eats list.  I've had bread salad before, but really wanted to try how good the chicken was! \n\nCame here for dinner with my girlfriends, and got seated upstairs at the window, so we got to overlook Market street, which was really nice.  Dinner was at 6, but since the chicken salad takes about an hour, we thought it'd be perfect to start with other dishes first.  \n\nWe ordered:\n- Yellow Fin Tuna:  It was almost like ahi tuna, lightly grilled on the outside and rare in the middle.  I liked the outside a lot, because it had this salty taste to it, which brought out the flavor!  The fish itself was pretty bland, but it went well with the lemony garbanzo beans and greens that came with it!\n\n- Grilled Pork Chop:  Love pork chops!  This was a bit on the salty side, but so are most pork chops.  It came with sauteed onions and potatoes.  The onions were reallllly good!  I'd say this was my favorite dish of the night!\n\n- Chicken Bread Salad:  It smelled and looked really good.  I had a taste of the drumstick first, so that was crispy and juicy, but as I bit into my second piece of chicken breast, it started to lack flavor.  The middle tended to be a bit dry and I couldn't get much flavor and juice from my piece anymore.  I'm not sure if this would be an hour wait chicken.  On the other hand, the bread salad alone with delish!\n\nOur server was really polite and attentive, so I give 4 stars for the service, but as for their well known chicken dish, only 3 stars.", "author": "Nancy S."}

Oh well...\n\nMoving on to food and menu, I was very disappointed with the menu. There seemed to be very little variety in the type of food selections for all courses. It all seemed about the same and nothing really struck my fancy. Ended up deciding to share a salad, oysters, app, and getting a pasta dish for dinner while the fiancee got the pork. Oysters were good, salad was fine, appetizer was really great & unexpected - it was the fettunta which is garlic & olive oil bread served with fresh veggies. However, when it came down to the entrees they were really small and not very filling. To top it off, we had hoped to order dessert before heading to the theater but our waitress straight up disappeared after our entrees were served. \n\nThe food was still pretty good, but some things left a bad taste in my mouth.

They were small and briny, and the mignonette added just the right vinegar touch. We also partook of the anchovies and burrata, both of which were very tasty, although anchovies aren't really my thing.\n\nOur group of 5 people share 3 entrees: the roasted chicken for 2, double-cut pork chop, and rare albacore. The chicken was easily the MVP of this meal, because it was simply the best roasted chicken I have ever tasted. It seemed to be seasoned with only salt and pepper because the spice was not at all overwhelming. The flavor of the chicken was really present and just delicious. Do yourself a favor, and order at least one of these chickens. It's a whole bird, cut up into pieces on top of their fresh sourdough. Wow.\n\nI felt the pork chop was a little salty, but it was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. If we hadn't ordered the chicken as well, I would have a lot more nice things to say about the pork chop. The albacore was also very nicely done, on the rare side, but just couldn't beat out the chicken as the darling of this dinner.\n\nTwo excellent desserts: pot de creme, and bread pudding, both wonderful.

Make sure you make reservations!\n\nSpecifically, I was looking forward to the chicken bread bowl that is so infamous. I couldn't believe the price--$48!!! Good thing I didn't have to pay for it, otherwise I don't think I could order it. Note, if you are going to order this item, order right when you sit down because it takes an hour. I kid you not.\n\nNow, I wondered how can chicken be that great, especially when it takes an hour. When I make my chicken, if I go beyond a short period of time, it get dry. I really wondered. My confusion was resolved once the chicken came out. And, OMG, the chicken melted in my mouth. It was so soft and juicy. I guess those wood-fired brick ovens really work wonders. The bread underneath was soaked in the chicken juice. It was delicious! I highly recommend it, and no wonder it's on the 7x7 list.\n\nPrior to the chicken, we had house-cured anchovies with celery, and the wild arugula salad with pomegranate seeds, mint, walnuts and sheep's milk ricotta, as appetizers. The anchovies worked really well with the celery and parmigiano-regiiano cheese--they were complement for each other. I don't like olives, so I can't speak for the coquillo olives that came with that appetizer. I was surprised at how the anchovies weren't too strong (so I didn't really need to chew gum after lunch). The salad was pretty good, but not too special.\n\nI also had the balsamic bloody mary with spicy pepper-onion relish--one of the BEST bloody mary's I've had. The spicy-ness was a powerful kick to my taste buds. Now that I'm thinking about it, I crave it! I had one of the champagnes as well--I forgot which one, but the waiter had recommended it, and it was very delicious.

Came early to have a drink and there was barely anyone there as it'd just opened. We went to the bar and couldn't even get service so we left and went to another place to have a drink. We had a reservation so came back in time for that. However, when we got back we still had to wail 15 min for our table. It still wasn't very busy so I don't know what the hold up was at all! Once we finally got seated service was good. I had the ricotta gnocchi. It was good but not amazing. I think it was a bit of lemon on top but it was way to string of flavor and sort of ruined it for me. My friend got the squab and was pretty good. We really wanted to try the chicken but since we got seated so late and wasn't able to order right away it was going to be too late. We tried two different desserts. I had the espresso one and was entirely too strong. I ended up taking about one bite and couldn't eat the rest. I doubt I'd come back again. It still just didn't live up to the reviews after the second time at Zuni. A bit overpriced and too hard to get a table even when reservations are made!", "author": "Emily F."}

Let me start by saying I've walked past Zuni numerous times, it always seems like a fun place to dine, not sure why I have never dined here.\n\nReservations were for 1215p, I showed up at 1130a, was greeted by a very friendly host who invited me to have a seat and wait or pull up to the copper covered stand up bar. The bar looked more inviting. Bar tender greeted me, asked me for my drink order, since the weather was nice I asked for a Pino Grigio but she didn't have it but offered a Sauvignon Blanc instead, $9 for the glass seems about the going rate and it was tasty.\n\nMy lunch host arrived, we were seated at a nice table for two and given a few minutes to go over the menu before our friendly waiter took our order. I usually do my homework before dining somewhere new and find out what the restaurant is known for, today I just went in blind and ordered from whatever looked good. I will say the oysters on ice caught my eye as I walked in, something to think about on my next visit.\n\nI appreciated having some space between our table and the adjacent diners so we could speak without hearing their conversation. \n\nWe both ordered the burger which I had seen when I was at the bar, it looked great. It's not your ordinary burger, quality beef, I ordered mine medium rare, served on a focaccia bread, no cheese for me but grilled onions please. I loved the home made pickles on the side, not your average kosher dills and definitely enhanced the burger. What started off looking like a beautiful burger did not handle very well, the focaccia started to fall apart, this was going to be a knife and fork experience. We ordered the shoe string potatoes which to me are potato chips meet French fries, short, thin, crisp, lightly salted, fun to eat, before you know it the plate was gone!\n\nWhat a great meal, loved the dining room, the servers took care of us, what more could I ask for?\n\nI'm a fan!", "author": "David P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-05-23", "description": "You've read about it, been discussed on Yelp talk threads for years yet my chase for the famous Zuni burger has been futile. \n\nI've been to Zuni on several occasions, but it seems always at the wrong time. The traditional dinner hour in my book is burger-acceptable but not at Zuni. It's offered only at lunch or \"late night\". \n\nWhat is considered \"late night\" by the nice folks at Zuni is beyond me, but ok. I'll just come back on Monday for lunch.\n\nUmmm, they are closed on Mondays (that my friend is another story for another time).\n\nFinally today I would capture my own Zuni burger.\n\nWithout hesitation I ordered the burger (medium rare) and shoestring fries. It's lunch and I'm feeling European and order a glass of Mourvedre (not listed on the menu, but recommended by my server). \n\n\"Salad to star perhaps?\" \n\nWha?? I'm here for the burger! If anything I will have a burger to start and then another burger for my entree! Care to ask what I want for dessert?\n\nThe burger arrived and placed in front of my anxiously waiting taste buds. I must admit, at first the burger did not seem that appear that impressive. What? no bun? but instead they use an Italian focaccia, a thin layer of white cheddar cheese that barely covered the burger and a side of pickles. But my friend, it's the simplify of the burger that makes this burger part of the Holy Grail of the burger world. I took a big bite and my mouth sunk into some of the most tasty ground beef I have ever experienced in my nearly 40 years on this planet. Fresh, mouth-watering, oozing of pure juicy-nessesess. This was burger-sex to the maximus!\n\nThe shoestring fries, I must say did not do much for me. I think they take pride on how skinny they make them, and even though I prefer thin cut fries these were just too thin. But the burger experience more than made up for it.\n\nZuni Cafe is a San Francisco destination restaurant. Make no mistake about it. The burger is certainly one of it's signature dishes that in itself is a true landmark of this city that is not to be missed.", "author": "V B."}

We got there a little early and sat along the copper topped bar, enjoying a nice single malt scotch while people watching and waiting for our table.  Apparently, Zuni Caf\u00e9 has been around for years and is a local favorite. It's got an interesting architecture with all these rooms pieced together to create the restaurant and you have to weave in, though and around to get finally to your table. Which makes each area quiet and intimate. We sat upstairs, near an open window, and the cool breeze coming in was refreshing.  This restaurant is comfortable, casual and welcoming.  Come as you are; no need to put on a tie. \n\nThe menus are updated daily based on season and what's locally available. Our server was amazing - she answered all our questions and explained the dishes expertly.  When we asked if the pork would be well done and dry, she immediately set out to describe a piece of meat that was flavorful, moist and would not disappoint.  (note: we ordered the dish and were not disappointed!) \n\nBetween us, we ordered some appetizers, entrees and dessert.  We didn't get the famous chicken on this visit; we thought about it, but didn't have the time to wait.  Each dish was wonderful - unique flavoring and combination of ingredients, expertly cooked proteins, just simple and satisfying.  The server was attentive, but out of the way.

It was excellent and a splendid meal to wish our dear lunch bud and lovely Yelper, Anna, farewell before she, her husband and pooches leave for Australia.\n\nWhen Toni & I found a parking place on Market Street less than half a block away from Zuni.  and Anna was parked in the space ahead of us----We knew we were off to an auspicious start! \n\nWe got there a few minutes before their opening time of 11:30 and had to wait for them to open the door.  A  couple of people were grumbling because we were getting wet standing in the rain. As soon as they opened the door the grumbling vanished as the gracious hostess tamed and choreographed the crowd. We were ushered to our table which at first glance seemed to be cramped and too close to our future table mates.\nIt worked out fine.  The couple that sat next to us were warm and friendly\nwithout bring intrusive.  The fellow would make cute remarks about our food choices.  He seemed to be a \"regular\" and interacted with the staff as if they were lifelong friends.\n\n\nAs we sat trying to figure out to order we were served water and bread & butter--yum!\n\nWe narrowed down our choices from their menu of the day.\nOur sweet and excellent server, Cherish, smiled and nodded her day at each of our choices.\n\nOnion Soup--deliciously light and flavorful with best crostini (toasted garlicky bits of Heaven) that were satisfyingly crunchy!\n\nPolenta with mascarpone.  Creamy and scrumptious.\n\nShoestring fries--being the potato-holic I didn't mind that not all of them were as crunchy as they could be.  Toni compared our batch to the \n\" first pancake\" one makes that is not as perfect as it's predecessors,\n\nI must admit I probably ate more than my share of those potatoes.\n\nThe chicken was well worth the wait.  It came with dark arugula leaves and a bread stuffing.  It reminded me of roasted chicken we had for special Sundays when I was a kid.  Moist and delicately seasoned.\n\nWe still had some leftover chicken despite our best efforts to eat it all.\nToni was able to take the leftovers home to Alan.\n\nWe of course had dessert--bittersweet chocolate mousse with whipped cream.  Wow--creamy and made from a very high quality chocolate.\n\nIts kind of ironic we ended our meal with the bittersweet mousse since\nwe felt sad to say good-bye to Anna but happy that she, her husband and puppies will be having untold adventures in their new home in Australia.\n\nThanks Zuni for the great meal and A+ service.\nI appreciated that they kept our water glasses full--my cup runneth over with gratitude!\n\nAlthough I have my gripes about Yelp I am grateful for all the wonderful people I've met through their website. Some folks I've yet to meet in person but hope to someday. Anna and Toni are two of my favorite Yelp buds.\n\nGood Luck Anna---we'll miss you!", "author": "Rinky N."}

The place is big and open and was quite busy on a Saturday night. We had made a reservation and were promptly seated. I had mentioned then that I was gluten intolerant and they confirmed that most of the menu was gf, aside from a couple dishes. The starters were either gluten or not too inspiring, so we ordered 2 entrees directly: halibut and duck. After gazing at our neighbors anchovy starter, we were comforted in our decision to skip the starters. The portions were ridiculously small, more like an amuse-bouche! Our entrees arrived, piping hot and well presented. The meats were cooked properly, but the vegetables were more ornamental. I was hoping to order a side of vegetables, but there were none. They offer various gf dessert options. We decided to go for the flour-less chocolate cake, aka Gateau Victoire. It had a nice texture, strong chocolate flavor and was not too sweet.

It did. Since we didn't have (and couldn't get) a reservation, we got there around 6:15 on a Saturday and had no trouble getting a table in the small bar. Service was okay, not great.

We tried to make reservations earlier that week but they were all booked so we decided to just try walking in. We got lucky and squished into a couple small tables downstairs in the bar area. It was a bit cramped but luckily a couple near us finished their meal quickly and the waiter gave us some extra table space. They were in the middle of transitioning their menu from afternoon to dinner when we sat down. Their menus are actually printed at meal time on a daily basis, so we had to wait a bit to get their dinner menu . Many of us were still full having eaten lunch only a few hours prior so we decided to just get a few dishes to split.\n\nWe ended up getting two orders of their famous brick-oven roasted chicken with bread salad, shoestring fries, a scallops appetizer, and their gnocchi. Sad to say, the chicken was a bit underwhelming. I dare say that the rotiserrie chicken from Costco is comparable to this one...although that isn't necessarily a bad thing as I love Costco chicken. But taking into consideration that Zuni's costs 10x more, it leaves a whole lot to be desired. I will credit them with the fantastic bread salad underneath the chicken which is a stroke of pure genius. I've never had anything like that with a chicken dish. The bread soaks up all the oil and juices running off from the chicken and just picks up all the great flavors in a delicious package.\n\nEverything else was just pretty good, nothing exceptional. I will note that their gnocchi was unlike anything I've ever tried before. It had a silk smooth texture, my teeth cut into it like butter. Although I'm not really fan of gnocchi, I'm guessing this dish took a great deal of finesse. Overall, I had a great time, but I think that was more so to do with the company I was with that night than the food. I would like to come back to try the burger sometime as their seems to be a general positive consensus about it, but I'm not really in a rush to do so.", "author": "Kevin N."}

He asked for a \"peach martini\" (he is not as sophisticated as other ZUNI-ites, but a customer nonetheless).  She said I don't have peach or anything peach-related.  He then asked for an appletini, and was told - \"we don't have pucker.\"  \n\nGuess what?  I'm privy to the whole upscale-pre-prohibition era cocktail movement (I work in the industry), the trend away from colored crap in drinks, etc. - but the proper response would have been - \"I don't have a peach martini, but perhaps something fruity and holiday-esque might be what you're looking for\" or \"I can make you something with calvados, an apple brandy from France - ever had an apple-style Sazerac?\"  or really anything other than what was said.  \n\nMy dad said he felt \"stupid\" and a guest should never feel that way.  Not all customers are foodies ordering Sazeracs and Elderflower cocktails, but it's an establishment's job to non-pretensiously create an experience for the paying customer, who they are.  He wasn't ordering \"SAKE BOMBS\" or \"JAGGER BOMBS\" - he just wanted a fruity cocktail.\n\nThe cocktails were otherwise delicious.\n\nJ E F F + T R A I N E E\nCharming, attentive and non-intrusive.

Not only is it going to require a bit of patience, but perhaps a relatively thick wallet (depending on how much you're willing to pay for chicken).\n\nZuni Cafe's famed Roasted Chicken with Bread Salad is a whole, organic (and possibly free range?) chicken that's roasted in a wood oven and served over a lightly toasted bread salad with a balsamic vinegar-ish dressing.  If you're getting it, there are two important things to know.  First, make sure to put in your order with your server as soon as you're seated.  Given that it takes about 45-60 minutes, you're definitely going to want that head start!\n\nSecond, it's priced at about $48.  While that might seem scary, think of it this way - given that it's meant to serve two (thanks for being there foodie buddy!), it's really only $24 a person for half a chicken and salad.  Much more reasonable!  And if you're on a date, then shelling out $48 might win you points for being a serious foodie!  Sure, the alternative is that they'll think you're crazy for paying that much for CHICKEN, but I'm an optimist.\n\nIf you're still worried, take comfort in the fact that the chicken is pretty darn good.  Not only do they do a great job of breaking it down into meaty, manageable pieces, but it's cooked perfectly as well.  Each bite was moist and tender and the skin was nice and crispy.  The seasoning is a little too delicate, but it had just a kiss of smokiness from their wood oven.\n\nAs for the bread salad, I think it was almost as good as the chicken itself (my friend commented that she actually enjoyed the salad more than the chicken),  The bread is lightly toasted on the outside, but (for better or worse) has soaked up some of the chicken drippings (so that's where the fat/juices went...) to make it really flavorful.  The dressing was a bit sharp/tart, but it worked well by cutting though all of that savoriness from the chicken.\n\nSince we wanted to save our appetite for the Roasted Chicken, we only ordered one other dish.  I can't recall the name or description of what we had (it's been a few months and it's not listed on their online menu), but it was a pasta dish with red sauce and duck (I think).  It was decent enough; nothing exceptional, nothing terrible.  I agree with what Sophia K. said though - their smaller dishes are more to tie you over and complement the chicken than anything else.\n\nAlthough the chicken is definitely worth trying if you've never had it, I'd temper expectations just so that you don't overhype it for yourself.  Then again, you could easily do worse by spending this much on a bad steak...", "author": "Mike L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-18", "description": "I have to confess that my much-anticipated dinner at Zuni was a bit fuzzy thanks to a few too many Moscow Mules in the afternoon.  I recall running downstairs to stick my head in a toilet before ordering - which is all to say, take my review with a grain of salt.\n\nConsidering I was a bit sick at dinner, I had a great time at Zuni.  I came with a party of ten, which was the maximum party size, and we were seated upstairs among white walls and light wood at a long table set with white tablecloth.  We had a six o'clock reservation and with the sun still out, the space felt cheerful and welcoming.  Service was helpful.  We were a large party and I can't think of a single goof on Zuni's end.\n\nThe food was pretty fantastic.  I was able to enjoy it despite my debilitated state, and I remember everything I ate.  We started with some crusty rustic brown bread, then ordered a bunch of dishes more or less family style.\n\nBelieve everything you hear about Zuni's roast chicken.  It is an absolute must.  It serves two people, and I would recommend it even if ordering it means you don't try anything else.  It was probably the best roast chicken I've ever had, moist and juicy and utterly dripping with pure chicken flavor.  It came on a bed of warm bread salad with scallions, dried currants, red mustard greens, and pine nuts, and this hearty salad would have been worth ordering on its own.  It was excellent under the chicken, as it soaked up the bird's flavorful juices.\n\nEverything else was solid as well.  Zuni uses simple ingredients and precise cooking to deliver some pretty impressive food.  Shoestring potatoes were great, salty and crispy, as was a bowl of gritty, corny polenta with mascarpone.  The burrata alla panna with grilled squash blossom, green beans, and Marash pepper was a superb little dish, with oozy cheese and earthy, piquant flavors.  The orecchiette was another winner, with greens, garlic, lemon zest, red onions, fresh ricotta, and black pepper.  The pasta was perfectly al dente and the flavors were clear and bright.  The Liberty duck breast may not have wowed as much as the chicken, but it was another fabulous entree, served with baby carrots, wild nettles, fresh shelling beans, and chanterelle mushroom relish.\n\nDessert was less strong than the savory portion of the meal, but still worth getting.  The Maywood Farm fig tart with wildflower honey ice cream was nice, but a little flat.  The figginess was good, but I could have used a little more sugar, even if just from the fruit.  The Gateau Victoire with whipped cream was the better dessert.  I tend to find many chocolate desserts too rich, but this one had a light, almost whipped texture that made it easy to swallow.\n\nWithout the chicken, Zuni Cafe would be a strong four star restaurant in my book.  The other dishes were wonderful, but none of them had the same wow factor as that chicken.  That said, the food was consistently delicious and the succulent roasted chicken alone would have been worth going out of our way for.  Maybe I dined in a drunken rapture, but I thought the chicken was perfect, and certainly good enough to merit a full five stars.", "author": "Steph C."}

The pizza had a fine thin crust, but why would you slather it with spicy tomato sauce, and then only add the cheese (some kind of mini-ball affair) AFTER baking it, so the cheese was cold and unmelted.

My friends and I usually go to Umami Burger, but we never gave this place a try so we came here for a quick brunch. \n\nThis place offers a pretty nice ambience, comparable to some 'up-scale' restaurants and some decent food, but the portions are definitely not worth the price. \n\nI had the House-ground grass-fed beef hamburger on grilled rosemary focaccia with a\u00efoli and Zuni pickles. Surprisingly cheese, onions, and other condiments are extra - you would think that a $15+ burger would have all that already included. Nope. Cheese and sauteed mushrooms costed me an extra $4. Not impressed. What was good though was the actual beef. Cooked very well and to my liking - medium rare. The sauce and bread of the burger was also very very good - especially the focassia bread. Mmm definitely up there. Overall, a good tasting burger, just at a super premium price. \n\nMy friends also ordered some fresh cut fries and oysters which they claim to be pretty good. I'm allergic to the oysters so I can't really have an opinion on them - They were however imported (supposedly) so I doubt that they're fresh.

It's a pinot noir, and it does match very well with the chicken. I suggest you try it.\n\nDessert was great too. I had the piccolo...whatever. It's a couple layer of meringue wafers with nut cream in between the layers, served with walnuts...not too sweet but great.

I came here with my family for a final dinner before heading back out of town.  For four of us, we shared one order of the chicken (I know they say it feeds two, but there is no way I could eat half of a chicken!) and shoestring potatoes.  We all got a starter - two caesar salads, a spanish pepper with wax beans dish, and a clam dish.  The chicken took the expected hour.  Our starters also took probably about 40 minutes, which felt long for starters, but maybe was intentional to align with the chicken.  \n\nI was impressed with the starters - all were really good.  The croutons on the caesar were the awesome, flavorful, garlicky homemade kind.  The pepper and bean appetizer was different, flavorful, and interesting.  The clams were well cooked with a flavorful sauce.  So, no complaints on the actual starter dishes.  The disappointment was in the chicken.  The chicken is good, but so is Costco chicken.  It's a whole procession with the one hour wait for the chicken and I'm not convinced it's worth it.  The chicken comes on a (pretty small serving of) bread salad and is covered with mustard greens.  There's a ton of mustard greens, which are pretty bitter, so it seems as if they are there for decoration but there is a ton fo them!  The bread salad is good, especially the part that is moist from the chicken (some of the outside pieces were just bread...).  The chicken is good, but I definitely don't need to come back for it.  Maybe I just don't like chicken enough!\n\nAlso, as a side note, we accidentally came on the Sunday of gay pride parade.  The bar downstairs, and really the whole street corner, were insane.  We were seated upstairs to the back, which we thought would be pretty quiet, but were next to a super noisy and inappropriate table.

They kept telling me I haaaaddddd to try their pork chop and chocolate cake, and let me tell you that I was not disappointed.\n\nA month later, so happens I'm not leaving yet and this time we wanted to try their chicken. I wasn't so excited for the chicken as I was feigning for their pork chops, I had been ever since I first had it. They are soooo good!\n\nAs soon as we got inside we ordered two chicken for 6 people and when we got seated, a pork chop for myself, and a salmon for my cousin. We talk, we laugh, we make time go by. The chicken comes out and it is beautiful and the aroma from the chicken fills up the place around us. You can smell the sweetness with a tinge of the vinegar, it was just amazing! Then my pork chop came out and this was my face.. (o.O) I looked over to my mom and my aunt & we thought the same exact thing. Why is it soooo small this time?? It was the size of the left over I had taken home the first time I had been at the restaurant for lunch. =( \n\nHowever, this is the reason I'm giving them an overall 5 star rating:\n\nTim our server, young handsome and sweet caring waiter, came over to check on our food as soon as we had taken our first couple of bites. (Now I never do this at steak houses or anywhere else but it bothered me enough to say something.) I asked him why my pork chop was so small & he looked at it and said, \"I think that's the size that they normally are.\" But after seeing that I still wasn't satisfied because my mom and aunt said, \"No, we had this for lunch last time and it wasn't this small..\" Tim immediately offered to take it back and to give me a new one. As reluctant as I was, I said \"Okay, please and thank you.\" No later than a couple of minutes, I believe he was the manager...? He came up to talk to us and explained that I might have gotten a smaller piece. He apologized and it was all good. They didn't make me feel bad at all. Which I was sooo relieved! Thank you so much!! :) \n\nPork Chop:\nAmazing! Thick juicy piece, the flavor penetrates into the meat itself. The seasonal vegetables are always soo0o delicious!\n\nChicken: \nTakes an hour to make but so0 worth the wait! My mom thought the meat was a bit too dry, but I thought otherwise. Yes chicken breasts are known to be dryer but it wasn't bad at all. What I noticed was that, as soon as you bit down into it, the chicken was just fall apart easily and it went down great. You can taste the flavor, it's light, but it's there. \n\nSalmon:\nTook a small bit of it from my cousin, good. It's not fishy and has flavor in it as well. Good choice if you're going for a vegetarian dish.\n\nChocolate cake:\nMUST ORDER! It is FLOURLESS!! :) Say what? Yes! It is flourless! But it melts in your mouth! What I got from them.. it's made with espresso, how? No idea, but it gives it is richness, which I  loved. It's not super sweet and sugary, it's chocolatey. \n\nFinal verdict?-- MUST COME BACK WITH MORE OF MY FRIENDS! :)", "author": "Terinna R."}

The restaurant is brightly lit w/ natural lighting streaming through their high-ceiling glass windows.  Everything was pretty mediocre from there. \n\nI was a bit dissapointed that their infamous chicken was an hour wait long, that we had to skip it due to time constraints. We shared the rabbit and kale salad, cranberry-squash soup, prosciutto w/ goat cheese and a dozen Kusshi oysters.\n\nI liked the fact that their menu changes seasonally, and offered fresh local ingredients. However, I think the portions were really meager and it was overpriced for what we had. We had tried some amazing Kusshi oysters at Hog Island earlier and were dying for more but the quality at Zuni Cafe was surely lacking.\n\nService was attentive but I felt there was a thick air of pretentiousness amongst the wait-staff and from the patrons dining. I might give this spot another try just to try their roasted chicken and grass-fed beef hamburger, but I wasn't completely impressed w/ the food albeit the beautiful surroundings.", "author": "Marie N."}

The location is great and the space could be too for the most part, but the place definitely has problems for the prices they charge.\n\nFirst of all the food: the menu is so, f-ing, boring and hasn't seemed to change for years, though that may be changing now due to changes in management/ownership.  The burger, the chicken and maybe some other dishes thrown in, but really there's not much variety at all and sometimes the execution is very poor, especially for the price point.  I've gotten some of the most terribly mangled oysters here than I have at any other restaurant in SF - at that price point slow down and shuck them correctly.  It's nice that they sometimes have rabbit on the menu, but not when they serve it very dried out (I know rabbit is tricky, but really).  And the roast chicken - for the hour wait it requires (though your waitress will offer you a pack of cards to pass the time) - really should come out as more than just roast chicken.  Also, I've had to send a steak back three times before because somehow to the kitchen medium still meant bloody.\n\nThe atmosphere is also troublesome.  It can be very, very loud in there and I really don't go out to restaurants to have shouting matches with me dining comrades.  And god help you if you're seated close to the wood stove - nice aesthetic idea until it's put into practice unless you planned on sweating through your shirt during dinner.  Also, only two restrooms for a place that size becomes rather troublesome/annoying.  SF is a very competitive restaurant town and it's really time this place ups its game to keep in the running.", "author": "William C."}

The hype is baffling.  I liked the slight wasabi-like spiciness of the mustard greens served with the chicken.  I also ordered the Bellwether ricotta gnocchi and loved it.  \n\nSome may consider Zuni overpriced but even at these prices there are still more diners than they can handle.  Service was adequate when we were there.  The hostess and bartender were friendly.   \n\nAnyone can make the chicken dish at home in a regular oven, it'd only be missing the slight smokiness from the restaurant's brick oven.  I followed the recipe widely available online and it came out nearly identical.  I was underwhelmed then and hoped to try the actual thing to see if there was a difference.  Nope!    \n\nI've seen some reviews here complain about the pink color of the meat.  Don't assume the chicken is undercooked.  There are many harmless explanations for this, like grilling can cause this coloration in young chicken.

The restaurant itself looks like a typical bistro, with multi-level design being a more memorable feature.  It looks just a bit dated, but does possess a nice looking patio.  The area is shady at night however with not much to look at out on the street.  We sat by the window and repeatedly caught hobos staring in as they ambled by--not so pleasant.\n\nFood was generally excellent.  Vibrant vegetables, simple preparations that let the ingredients shine.  Like the general feel of the restaurant though, there's the feeling that Zuni wants to be safe and solid, rather than to wow and excite.  You need to have the right expectations.  The highlight of the meal not surprisingly was the roast chicken, and it was truly marvelous.  Tender, juicy, pack full of that good chicken-y flavor.  One of the best I've had.  And it looks so damn simple.  Some restaurants etch themselves onto your memory with mastery of a single signature dish.  This was one of those instances, one of those dishes.  If you already know you are getting the chicken (why would you not?), be sure to make like a pro and order it as soon as you sit down, as it takes about an hour to make from the time you order it.  This way you avoid an awkward waiting period after first course or whatever stuff you order are finished, and chicken is still like 30 minutes from ready.", "author": "Kozmo C."}

The rooms snake around, and have dividers. Yet, there are 'cut out' windows in the walls.  It's a trendy spot and has this private yet everyone can see you thing going on.  Interesting. \n\nOn the other hand, I felt very rushed here.  The salads came out within moments of our order bring placed.  I had barely forked my last piece of lettuce before our plates where whisked away and the entree laid out.  I felt I had to guard my plate from roving busboys to ensure I would be allowed to finish.  Forget about a relaxed date night, I think we were in and out in 45min.  \n\nFood:  caveat here, I'm vegan so they prepared me something off the menu.  It was a very lackluster vegetable plate.  They just roasted some veggies and poured oil all over the top.   Boring.  The salad appetizer was really boring as well\n\nMy husband had the steak and he said it was nothing memorable.  \n\nOverall, I would say the quality of the food was like a slightly upscale cafeteria.  Nothing interesting or inventive.  Very rushed and quick to serve, indicative of the complexity and thought that goes into the food. \n\nOur table was right across from the kitchen and the whole night pretty much the only thing I saw flying out to tables was the roasted chicken. Over and over and over again.  Maybe that dish is really good?  \n\nOverall, I MIGHT come here again if I had friends who really wanted to go.  But there are lots of other trendy places to be seen, that wont necessarily rush you so much, and that probably have better food.   I would not recommend Zuni for a date or a date night. \n\nPs.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-07-25", "description": "Zuni has a reputation for good, consistent and rustic food in a beautiful setting on Market street.  I have sampled quite a bit, and there are some good things, some poor choices, and perhaps a few unsupervised cooks.\n\nThe oyster selection is wonderful.  The people shucking them however, aren't always.  It's pretty common to get a really sad looking oyster, or one that's even spawning, but after observing the kitchen, the chef de cuisine or sous chef does not appear to be checking them before they go out.  \n\nWhat's curious to me is why they only offer a basic mignonette.  Black pepper and shallots in vinegar is so boring.  There's no inventiveness there, and even the very popular choice of cocktail sauce is not available, as well as prepared horseradish.  I understand not offering horseradish out of season, but there's not much harm in having prepared or pickled horseradish for your customers.  \n\nZuni's caesar salad has quite the reputation.  Even though they for some reason decide to use a broken aioli dressing for this salad, it's delicious.  What doesn't stack up are the croutons.  They look like they came from a salad buffet bar, and they don't taste like much.  I would love to see long crostinis with baked parmesan and garlic on top, or even rustically torn and dressed toasted bread served with the chicken.  \n\nThe plate of fries are crispy and delicious, but I cannot understand the choice to only offer an unusually large amount of fries for $6.  Even for two people, it can be too many fries.  For 3 or 4, it works out great.  I'd happily pay a couple bucks less for a much smaller plate.  But, if you can eat them all or share them, I recommend getting them!  Just make sure to ask for extra condiments, cause they'll give you a tiny morsel of ketchup (I mean literally an ounce).\n\nThe $15 Zuni burger that comes without fries is praised as one of the cities best, but a burger can only be as well as it's cooked.  I can never get a properly cooked burger here.  Even before I eat the burger, I can tell just by touching it what the temp is.  How come no one else is checking this? I've had a burger here a few times within the last year, and every time I ask for medium rare, I get something between medium and mid well, and they are always dry.  If I send them back, I get the exact same thing.\n\nThe burger itself is round, but served on square foccacia bread that is lathered in aioli.  Round burger on square bread?  Okay, well as conceptually flawed as that is, the foccacia is very delicious and a great vessel.  Another one of the problems you'll find is the garnishes.  If you get sliced tomato, they're narrow and too thick.  Same issue with the onions.  They also choose a lettuce that wilts far too easily resting underneath the burger.  Because of this, it makes it flat out impossible to eat your burger without deconstructing it.  The burgers most redeeming qualities are the pickles on the side, which are very excellent.\n\nThe roasted chicken for two is definitely a wait, but a good thing to wait for if you fancy paying way too much money for chicken.  The skin is crispy, the chicken is moist and well seasoned, and the bread salad with mustard greens is delicious.  I really wish the bread salad was larger, considering it's a $48 plate.  If you're a chicken lover, you will really enjoy this, but your wallet will not, especially when you can recreate this dish at home for less money.  \n\nThe cocktails here are just okay, very pricy, and very small.  Take special note if you get a martini, for they serve you unpitted olives on a toothpick that sink into the glass.  Good (over priced) wine selection, and really bad beer selection.  \n\nOverall, I have found the food very inconsistent, and for the very high prices they charge along with really bad service, I'm not terribly eager to return. I want to love this place, but I can't afford to burn $50 on a chicken with bread salad or $16 on an overcooked burger.", "author": "Nathan B."}

One thing I liked about their menu is that it was not too long, but it had a variety of prices and choices.\n\nMy wife had their margarita, which was a little tart. And small for $10. But good anyway. I had an Aperol, which sounded bitter but in fact was a gloriously balanced citrus drink. I could've finished a pitcher of them.\n\nWe ordered a number of the starters, which had a lot of vegetarian choices:\n\nCeasar salad\nWild arugula salad with tangerines and shaved purple asparagus\nPotato and green garlic soup\nRoasted chicken frisee salad\nRicotta salata pizza\nClams with broccoli di ciccio and white beans\n\nThe Caesar salad was indeed the best I have ever tasted. It had the perfect balance of lemon, anchovy, garlic, and cheese. The croutons were crusty, but saturated with dressing flavor. We probably should have split it, since it's enormous. At $10, this was probably the best value for salad I have had in the city.\n\nThe wild arugula salad was also delicious, a perfect balance of sweet dressing and spicy arugula. It created the perfect bite, with the combination of all the ingredients. It was just the right size, too. Nothing ruins arugula like too much of it.\n\nThen we tried the soup and the clams. The soup was unusually light for potato and the green garlic added a delicious, balanced flavor. Surprisingly good, considering how humble the ingredients are.

My wife and I got there about 30 minutes before the official seating (6:00pm) on a Friday night.  Their menu was prepared that night.  We had the shoestring potatoes and olives in the bar area.  The olives were excellent.  They were soaked in fine olive oil and had small pieces of licorice root.  Our waiters in the bar area and in our seated area on the second floor overlooking the restaurant were not inhibiting, but prompt and very knowledgeable about the menu.  \n\nFor the meal courses, we had  two oysters, the cesar salad, figs, gnocchi, and the chicken for two.  They are supposedly known for their gnocchi and cesar salad and they did not disappoint.  The oysters were fresh and delicious.  The fig dish was slices of fig, onions and thin slices of lemon that were lightly breaded, lightly fried and then seasoned.  The dish was an amazing sensory experience.  My wife and I are not normally big chicken eaters.  However, this was a recommended \"can't miss\" item.  You need about a one hour prep time for the chicken.  It is a fire cooked dish.  The skin was a perfect crispy seasoned good.  The meat was tender, and the complimenting bread squares, greens, and balsamic tasting sauce were the perfect compliment.  Wow!  Amazing!  I can't wait to go back.", "author": "Darren S."}

Lining the front are bottles of every kind. You enter in the back into the bar, which is a shining bronze. A pianist plays away. If you have made a reservation, which is a good idea, you will be whisked through the maze-like alcoves into one of the many dining rooms. The space is warm and cozy, and you see why San Franciscans have loved this place forever.\n\nTo start, we got the caesar salad and the squid crostini. The salad is almost obligatory if you haven't tried it, since they've made thousands of them over the years. The squid crostini was very delicious and came with some pickled onions. \n\nAs mains, we got the rabbit and the duck. Both of them were delicious, the rabbit with a great sauce including morels and radicchio and the duck coming with beans. The duck was a little skimpy and could have been warmer (it seemed to have cooled down too long). For dessert, we had the grapefruit granita and the nectarine tart, both excellent.\n\nSince the menu is always changing here, you can come all the time and try various things (though they always have the standbys like the salad and the chicken).\n\nI wouldn't say this is fine dining--after all, it is a cafe. It's more like comfort food done with an expert touch, in a lovely and cozy setting.", "author": "Ryan C."}

It's tasty... but for the price, I've had much better in the rest of SF. And if you want to try the chicken, remember that it takes over an hour for them to prepare! And you can't call ahead to order!\n\nI made reservations a few days in advance for a double-date night at 8:15pm on a Tuesday. We arrived a bit early, and I told the restaurant to get started on the chicken since I knew it'd take a ridiculously long time to prepare. Here's a rundown of everything we had:\n\n*Caesar Salad (2.5 stars - $10): There was a TON of dressing on the salad. The salad was presented with whole romaine lettuce leaves, which I like, but it would've benefited from a lot less dressing.\n\n*Fettucine with corn/pancetta/squash (3 stars - $16.50): Texture of the noodles was not bad, but the dish overall was a little bland. There wasn't really a sauce on the noodles, just a light butter coating.\n\n*Chicken for two (3.5 stars - $48): The chicken was tender and moist... But it wasn't worth waiting 1.5 hours for it along with $48. I thought it'd be more flavorful, but the chicken just had a very light herb seasoning. And I thought the bread salad was WAY overrated... It was just bread with balsamic vinegar soaked in it. A bit salty for my taste. Overall, I liked the chicken here but I can find cheaper, better alternatives like Limon Rotisserie's chicken. Or Costco $5 rotisserie chicken yum! \n\n*Pork Chop with green beans and fingerling potatoes (4 stars - $28): This was the star of the show! Very tender pork with good flavor. A little bit salty but the dish overall was prepared very well.\n\nAlthough the food did not blow me away, I'm still glad I tried this place, even though I most likely will not be coming back soon.

I love the bustling atmosphere here, the cozy brick walls, the tables in close proximity to one another, the very professional service, all of it combines for a delightful dinner.\n\nWhile I must admit I was intrigued by the half of a chicken option I wasn't quite ready to commit to that much meat and so I followed my normal pattern and ordered a bunch of stuff with no rhyme or reason just so I could taste a lot of things. I started with a selection of cheeses that I kindly shared with Sir Nicholas. They offer 5 daily for $5.25 a piece. I choose two - a goat cheese and Parmesan. Nick thought ordering the Parmesan was one of the odder things I picked, but I have to say I was interested in the accompanying side item. I'm still not sure what it was, but it was like a mash up of fruit and mustard maybe? Either way, it was a perfect accompaniment and I'm a fan of Parmesan anyway so I enjoyed it.\n\nI also ordered a Caesar salad that I loved, but Nick did not due to it being topped with real Caesar dressing. (It was too fishy for Nick, but that's the way I prefer it actually.) For my \"main\" course I chose to try the side of polenta and a Serrano ham appetizer. The appetizer came with little slices of bread topped with mashed chickpeas covered in a sauce and I thought it all came together really nicely for that dish. Nick ordered a traditional dinner as he usually does in the form of a pork chop entr\u00e9e. This was a pretty big serving and heavy on the garlic. While I think the flavor was good, it was also quite strong.\n\nCocktails were had, too and mine was a glass of bubbly infused with St. Germain. Nick simply enjoyed a bottle of beer. It was on the expensive side for a dinner for two, but that could just be because I actually ordered 4 dishes total in my never-ending sampling quest. However, I'd say the quality is worth the dinero so I definitely recommend giving it a try.", "author": "Tiffany N."}

I like rotisserie chicken. Okay, why not?\n\nSo I finally snagged some last-minute reservations for 2 for a Saturday evening.  Turns out we got amazing seats for such a last-minute booking - they sat us at a table on the 2nd floor right next to the window, so we had the street view and could people watch during our meal. \n\nTo squander some time/zap hunger pangs during the 1 hour chicken wait, we had:\n\n--DRINKS--\n1. The MOJITO was good. Solid, nothing special.\n\n2. The ELDERFLOWER COCKTAIL was delicious. Slightly bubbly. Comes in a champagne glass. Not too sweet, just right. \n\n--APPETIZERS--\n1. HOUSE CURED ANCHOVIES - comes w/ crescents (stalk cut the short way) of celery, squares of parmigiano-reggiano slices, & coquillo olives. I didn't find this dish to be a particularly glamorous or fancy dish. The anchovies were briny and tasty but I didn't care much for the celery. The cheese and olives were just okay. \n\n2. DEVIL'S GULCH RANCH RABBIT SALAD - comes with a few big leaves of red leaf lettuce, Pixie tangerines, and creme fraiche. The rabbit was mighty tasty and not gamey at all. I especially liked the bacon-textured pieces - chewy and flavorful. \n\n--MAIN--\nOf course we got the ROAST CHICKEN FOR 2. I'm not easily impressed by roast/rotisserie chickens as many places in the city serve them (e.g. Morning Due Cafe, La Fusion, etc). Unfortunately I was not wowed by the chicken here. It is definitely not $48-worthy chicken. Yes, it was tasty and the bread salad was decadent with all the roasting juices. For $48 I expect even the chicken breasts to be tender and juicy. The chicken breasts here are not - I found them quite dry. The thighs were good as were the drumsticks, but for $48...... I would probably not get this again. The red mustard greens are similar to arugula in taste, but with the heat and fats from the chicken, they quickly wilted. \n\nWe also had the SHOESTRING POTATOES alongside the chicken. It comes as a huge mound of shoestring fries on a dinner-size plate. Huuuuge portion! We could barely make a dent in it. They're really too stringy and crispy to qualify as fries - they're more like crunchy strands meant more for texture than for substance. \n\n\nVerdict?\nI'd be willing to come back to try their brunch menu and some of the other highly-reviewed dinner items, e.g. the pork chop.", "author": "Megan L."}

That's what my meal at Zuni was like tonight.  The last time I ate here was at least 15 years ago--I remember the meal being great and thinking that I would try to make it a somewhat regular event... and then life intervened.\n\nWhen I realized I'd be going to a play right down the street, I decided to revisit my old friend, and I have to say we picked right up where we left off.\n\nI started with some Tomales Bay Pacific Hog Island Oysters.  They were perfectly fresh and the sauce was tasty but not overpowering--still, I'm kind of a purist and mainly ate them au natural.  They paired nicely with the Sauvignon Blanc recommended by my waiter.  While I'm on the subject, I have to say that, though the place was packed, the service was excellent.  I was seated nearly right away by a host who actually took the trouble to learn my name and use it.  He seated me at a table for one (no tacky extra chair to spoil my people watching), and told me that he typically seats 20-30 solo diners like myself, and that I would likely enjoy the view--which I did.\n\nNext up was a delicious mixed green salad with some garlic croutons that were clearly house-made and delivered a huge garlic punch to go with the vinaigrette and bitter greens--perfection.  My main course was Monterey Bay King Salmon served with Basil, mushrooms, and green beans.  The salmon was perfectly cooked, and the basil, mushrooms and green beans couldn't have been better.  Let me also say that the portion was exactly what I wanted--not huge, but not so small I'm wondering what I'll be ordering later when I'm hungry again.  I paired it with a Mt. Eden Pinot Noir, which, as with the Sauv Blanc, was recommended by my waiter and did not disappoint.\n\nThe wine list was not huge, but if what they serve by the glass is any indication, I suspect you will find ample selections to match your meal.\n\nOverall, I'd have to say that the evening was a success and that I am looking forward to future visits with my old friend--who knows--next time, we might even get to desert!", "author": "Sean F."}

It was worth the wait - though I really wanted to try that roasted chicken!  We were in too big a hurry to eat so I will be returning to Zuni, beyond a doubt.  \n\nZuni is a light and airy place, with an open kitchen so you can watch the hard\nworking chefs as they prepare their dishes.  While the menu choices are not extensive, in some ways, that is good.

The salad was also perfectly balanced.  It had the right mix of greens and interesting things and it tasted fantastic. Big plus for the delicious wine list too.  We liked our dishes so much we had to try dessert. The chocolate flourless cake was really beyond description -just unbelievably light and fluffy and not cakey at all.

We got reservations for 7:45, and I was looking forward to it since we picked the place because it was on the 7x7 list. \n\nOur server, John, started off the night on the wrong foot. I'll refrain from name-calling; I'll try to give him benefit of doubt, but hey, John, you basically screwed up your own tip from the get-go. His greeting to us was, \"You were the girls that nearly ran me over earlier.\" \n\nUm, what? I was right behind my friend, and you had stepped aside, carrying a tray full of maybe 5 empty glasses. I didn't think anything of it; maybe I'm spoiled or whatever, but I guess I'm kind of used to servers at most places (yes, even Chinese restaurants, for example) allowing diners to proceed before them. Always. \n\nAnyway, we ordered a caesar salad and the rabbit appetizer. The rabbit was underwhelming, there was barely any rabbit in there. There were slivers of rabbit, but a whole lot of beets or something. The caesar salad really wasn't anything special. The bread in the bread basket was burnt. \n\nIn the meantime, we were waiting for my friend's wine to arrive. My oysters arrived (after the two appetizers), and still, no wine. At this point, I was hoping John would redeem himself,service-wise, since he helped me choose which oysters to sample. \n\nFinally, someone brought over her wine...to the wrong table. When the wine made it to our table, John just said another drunk lady took the original glass, which was why it took so long. No apology.\n\nWe ordered the roast chicken with warm bread salad to share. Now, this is where I felt really ripped off. The chicken was amazingly dry. I can't cook, and I can make better chicken. The outside was overly salty, the meat was overly bland and dry, even the dark meat. The salad wasn't anything unusual, just greens and bread tossed in oil and chicken juices. \n\nWe passed on dessert and asked for the check. John thought it was okay to TOSS the check folder onto the table without saying a word. It slid a couple inches before coming to a stop. \n\nHe's lucky my friend determined the tip and not me because I would've tipped much less, even though he kinda helped with the oyster choices. The greeting, the lack of apology for the late wine, and the check tossing (the last straw) really turned me off from coming to Zuni ever again. I can do without pretentious service, thanks.

I don't come often, but I do keep on coming back.  Each visit is a pleasure.  I can't remember all the times that I've been here -- at least a half-dozen I'd say -- but I do recall one great evening when a large group of us showed up late at night for the famous post-10PM hamburgers.\n\nI was last here a few nights ago with a group of 6.  As usual, my companions were wowed by the architecture and the views of the street.  Our server was fine, although she used \"awesome\" to describe most of the dishes that we asked about.\n\nIt may be that I've never had the famous chicken.  Or maybe I have had the chicken, but it was so long ago that I've forgotten the experience.  Walking to Zuni the other night, I really had Zuni chicken on the brain, but the one-hour wait for it was sufficiently dissuasive that I went for the sliced leg of lamb as my main dish.  That dish was the low point of the evening for me -- it was OK, but my socks were still on even after the first bite.  It was a perfectly executed 3-star dish.\n\nBack to the starters: I had a warm white bean salad that was a total knockout.  I negotiated a swap with the guy across from me and gave him some of that salad in return for a small portion of the caesar that he ordered.  The Zuni caesar is another of their iconic dishes -- just like the chicken, it may be something that I had in the past, but I sure couldn't remember it.  Let me just record the fact that the caesar is great (as everyone knows).  Even tasting it was a wonderful pleasure.\n\nWines, we did order some.  I went for two of the cheaper bottles.  The big winner was the 2007 \"vielles vignes\" St. Joseph, which had Kermit's label on the back.  If I have a moment, I will stop into Kermit Lynch's shop at buy a few bottles.  Everyone loved the wine, which seemed to me like a fine value.  The wine that wasn't a big winner was an arneis that we started with.

Pistachio milk granita\n\nThe brioche was just out of the oven, warm and fluffy. The Meyer lemon preserves were sweet, lemony, and not sour or bitter at all. Together, it was a beautiful meld of flavors. I could have eaten at least two, but sadly, I only had a half of one.\n\nMy main dish was the eggs baked with sorrel. I wasn't sure what sorrel was (an herb), but it tasted perfect with the eggs and cream. The dish was smooth and creamy from the eggs and cream, and bright from the sorrel. Yum. It tasted even better on the grilled bread.\n\nThe scrambled eggs with chervil were incredibly tender. Scrambled eggs aren't hard to make, but I have never had them so good. And who would have thought they'd be so perfect with a salad?\n\nThe pistachio milk granita was cold and creamy, but not really my thing. I don't think it's because of Zuni, though.

I've had better pizza at Delfina and I enjoyed the pork chop at The House better, but hey, it's not their specialty so I can't be too critical. 2.5 stars overall for the food.\n\nI really like the ambiance of the restaurant - they have windows in the roof that let in the light, and the tables are arranged in a spacious but dynamic way. It almost felt like we were eating outside even though we saw the kitchen right in front of us. 4 stars.\n\nI'm not sure if I'll ever return for the chicken - maybe if we were more prepared. But then again, wouldn't anything taste like it's the best after waiting for an hour? Maybeeee. And for a time comparison, we finished our meal in 45 mins!", "author": "Lucia C."}

Our hostess was attentive and remembered to check back on us many times even after we received our food. \n\nI ordered the Sole with greens, kumquats, brown rice, and watermelon. My friend ordered the lamb. Her portion was monstrous and looked delicious. I don't eat red meat, but I definitely plucked a few..........or most of her roasted garlic cloves. My fish was way over cooked; something I was surprised to see at such an upscale place. There was some sort of aoili mixed in with the brown rice and it was a nice balance to the acidity/tartness from the kumbquats. The slivers of watermelon brought a freshness to the dish. This was a very summer/spring type of dish. I was hoping for something a bit more hearty for my entree. I give them three stars for their creativity, but there was just something lacking in that entree. \n\nI'll probably give them another shot, another day.

Our lemon drops were not sweet enough so my husband requested a little simple syrup.  They returned his drink to the bar and it came back with an odd bitter taste.

It was much better, not the spectacular drink we  previously took for granted but perfectly acceptable. \n\nMy husbands favorite Caesar salad was nothing special either and lacked the shower of shaved Parmesan that previously topped it. The pasta with cauliflower was only okay. The halibut was good.  The chicken was a disappointment and the bread salad was oily.  The timing is also an issue when you have a performance; there isn't enough time for much of a delay over the hour listed on the menu when you have to walk to Davies.

The anchovies and the Caesar share a lot of the same flavors so if you're not an anchovy fiend like me and my uncle then you're best off just having the Caesar. Their Caesar is pretty unique in that it's just really raw--- nothing is cut up into little pieces and there are three major flavors (garlic, anchovy, egg) and the dressing sits glistening on the leaves with cool slivers of parmigiano over them. The croutons are rustic cubes that perfectly complimented the tangy-ness of the dressing. \n\nOnce the chicken was on the table, everything in the world was obliterated. There was just this chicken dish. You know when flavors work perfectly together--- like chocolate and hazelnuts? Apparently warm bread salad with scallions, mustard greens, dried currants, and pine nuts is the best combination for roast chicken in the world.  What's more is that the chicken was so, so, so, so, juicy and its drippings are soaked up tenderly by the bread salad. If I could just eat that bread salad I'd be happy, but oh happy day I get to have the best roasted chicken in the world with it!\n\nSeriously, I have not had a better roasted chicken since.

And I eat most every meal of my life in a restaurant so it's not a review I make litely. But this bears saying this week!\n\nI just received news that I lost a friend today, the restaurant was very kind to personally call me before I heard elsewhere. Thank you!\n\nJudy Rodgers of the famed Zuni Cafe passed away and it's a day to celebrate food! What's curious about this is we were not really close but I have been a regular at her restaurant for over 26 years. It's my FAVORITE restaurant in the world! And I have eaten at thousands.\n\nJudy and Zuni are FOOD. Zuni is my second home, I have literally eaten there over 5000 times! I'm not kidding. I know most of the staff well, many who have worked there for decades. I have had family and staff parties, celebrations of every type or encounter there you can imagine. I have attend their parties and benefits and I have dreamed up companies, written songs, poems, letters and created some of my finest work on their paper table covers, carefully tearing them at the end of my meals and folding them away for further development more times than I can count. I have met some of my closest friends while sitting next to them as strangers only to end up sliding over and sharing wine together, I have shown off Zuni to my Celebrity friends and referred 1000's of people to it's doors. I am in love with Zuni Cafe and what Judy thoughtfully and passionately built over the years with her partners and colleagues.\n\nJudy did not like to be called \"Chef\"! I love that because I do not like to be called anyone's \"Boss\" we are a team doing great things together is how I view my staff. But she led Zuni, and promoted from within. Bussers to Servers etc., and people stay at Zuni!\n\nI love the family of Zuni, I loved how Judy and her food have nourished my soul, my ideas and have allowed me a home away from home, each time I walked in it's doors. \n\nMy favorite memory of Judy is the night I got to cook for her and her husband Kirk. I was nervous because my friends and my favorite chef were coming to my home for dinner. This was also the night that OJ Simpson ran from the police through the streets of Los Angeles in his Bronco. Judy called and said, \"Sorry we're late but are you watching this on TV?\" I replied, \"Yes, it's so unbelievable I think I burned my sauce while watching the news!\" Everyone was over an hour and a half late to dinner which while still good, was not as good as I had hoped. But she was gracious and we had a great meal and lots of fun together despite OJ's antics! And I got to cook for THE cook!\n\nSo here's to my favorite \"cook\"! My favorite restaurant, my favorite restaurant staff and to a lifetime of wonderful shared experiences. I will miss you Judy, as will the world for your style, grace and humility as well as the flavors you have given so many of us for so many years. \n\nI don't believe in heaven and all that stuff but I know that IF there was a place like it, it's better have an Oyster Bar and a Brick Oven waiting because things are about to get a whole lot more tasty! \n\nAs for me, it's Noon in San Francisco and I'm going to Zuni for lunch!\n\nWith Love,\n\nMark E.

We got there right at 11:30am on a Saturday and there was a small line forming waiting to get in.  We were seated immediately and the place filled up fairly quick.  We were anxious to place our order since we new exactly what we wanted and we knew it would take 1 hour to finally make it to our table.  \n\nThank goodness they gave us bread because I was starving.  The crust of our sliced bread was burnt so we had to eat around it.  But we did finish it, after all, we did have a whole hour to wait.  We even got a 2nd helping of bread which was probably a bad mistake.  They brought our dish about 40 mins later.  Apparently when there are only 5 chickens in the roaster it takes only 40 mins, any more then it's the full hour.  I guess we got lucky.\n\nSo, you remember when I told you we got the 2nd helping of bread?  Well, the salad comes with more of the same bread, everywhere.  Not only was there more bread than greens, it was drenched in olive oil and chicken juices.  I was sooo breaded out.  No more please!  I ate around all of the bread and finished off the greens.  At that point my body was just craving vegetables!  I ate a couple pieces of chicken and then we had to pack the rest away.  \n\nI'm actually feeling kinda grossed out right now about how heavy that meal is sitting in my tummy as I type.  And this is 4 hours later too!  I know everyone loves this dish but geez, I feel like i just drank a tub of oil.  Having said that, I would not order that dish again.  At $48 that's a pricey roasted chicken.  I can get one from Safeway for under $10 and add all of the greens I want.

Our waiter was just the right amount of friendly and very professional in his service from start to finish. And except for one other customer's repeated and annoying laugh (of which the whole cafe couldn't help but take notice), the noise level and ambiance was very pleasant and conducive to a good conversation. I also enjoyed the copper accents at the bag, the wedge shape of the room, and watching some warm personal interactions at the bar between on of the bartenders and a couple that had dropped in for a drink.\n\nAs for the food, please be warned that when you order a burger medium rare here, that's what you get.  And since I'm not that much of a \"red\" meat guy, the whole blue cheese burger experience was a little uncomfortable.

We just ate at Limon and got a whole chicken for less than $20 and that chicken had more flavor and was WAY juicier.\n\nSo it's hard for me to justify the price, yes, that is one thing.\n\nOverall--service is absolutely great.  Super friendly and nice.  When we sat down and inquired about the chicken, the person who sat us down said he would inform our server to get our chicken started right away.  We also went on a Tuesday night so we waited less than an hour for our chicken!\n\nThe asparagus and rice soup was pretty good--they even split the portions.  It's hearty and down home good cookin'.\n\nThe chicken was good.  But like I said, it's hard for me to compare.  But on its own it was a good piece of chicken cooked well. But it wasn't anything to write home about.  The bread salad was tasty and good but the green parts were super bitter.\n\nThey do serve fresh squeezed orange juice, which was a plus for me.\n\nThe atmosphere was cool and chill and it has a neat 2-story inside.\n\nMake your reservations early as they seem to always fill up.\n\nI think it's a good restaurant but overall if I was going for the chicken, I'd probably head over to Limon.

Big deal.  The food is kind of boring.  The roast chicken intrigued me, but the 1 hour preparation time is ridiculous.  I'm sure there's some sort of culinary justification for it, but it's just not a very user-friendly concept, especially at lunch for those of us who are gainfully employed.  In fact, the concept is so absurd that even putting it on a lunch menu is bordering on pretension.

After realizing we were in for the long haul we decided to go with the Roasted whole chicken for two.  The chicken is seasoned wonderfully and arrives in 8 nicely carved pieces.  The Tuscan-style bread soaks up just enough of the juicy goodness from the chicken yet remains a bit crunchy creating a lovely bite.

Plus 9 is my favorite number as well.\n\nAnyhow, the burger itself comes on a square foccacia bun which was some nice bread, but of course the square over round burger patty thing means you will have a lil extra corners of just carbs.  Some people might like that and some might not - at first I wasn't as much into it but that bread is good so I didn't really mind...\n\nThe burger automagically comes with pickled onions w/hints of cinnamon (of which Melanie got a full stick) and that combination is really subtle but good. The meat itself was a bit overcooked to my taste since I ordered it Medium Rare and it was more close to Medium or even Medium well so that was a bit disappointing.\n\nThe beef was still juicy though so I am betting that if it was exactly MR then it would have been even tastier.  So where does that put this burger?  So far (after Namu's 7x7 #10) it's in the top two but of course we've only had two.

We mentioned our displeasure with the food to our waiter, and his response was, well maybe this is just not your restaurant. I think that is correct! We won't be going back!

It was definitely moist, juicy, aromatic, etc etc.  But for $48 - it better darn be! \n\nOn a side note, we also ordered the anchovies and gnocchi - not bad, but not super memorable either.

Every single detail was amazing!\n\nThe atmosphere-- I like the sort of industrial interior and the open, airy space.  It reminds me of an art gallery, which sort of makes sense with the gorgeous food they serve here. \n\nThe service-- From the host (a cutie, to boot) to our waitress to the bus boys, everyone was friendly, polite, and lovely.  Zuni definitely is laid back in a way that many upscale restaurants in New York aren't-- and I love that in a restaurant.  \n\nThe food-- As I said, this is exactly what I envisioned when I was researching our trip to SF.  Fresh produce, artfully showcased, powerful flavors that rely on the integrity of the ingredients and not simply gussying up inferior ingredients, pride in the bounty of the area, and skill in execution.  Zuni hit all those points for us.  \n\nAs we nibbled on crusty bread and butter (I think we just about licked the butter bowl clean), we started with an arugula salad served with pistachio and fennel.  The kitchen split this for us onto two plates without us asking into two perfect servings.  It was refreshing and beautifully composed, with a light vinaigrette.\n\nFor my main dish, I ordered two smaller plates.  The first was a soup with pureed potato, corn, and pepper, both hearty and rich.  I also had a small salmon filet with a cilantro (maybe?) pesto, succulent heirloom tomatoes, and green and white beans.  Light, flavorful, leaving me feeling totally satisfied but not stuffed as I do after a night at Dinosaur BBQ.\n\nThe dessert was our favorite.  It was a meringata, discs of thin meringue layered between mascarpone mousse and blackberry compote.  The mousse was cloud-like-- airy, light, sweet, complemented perfectly by the tart berries; the meringue melted on our tongues.  It was truly an ethereal dessert.\n\nZuni Cafe was without a doubt my favorite meal in SF and one of the most memorable meals I've ever had!  It was so special to feel as though I really were in a temple to food-- the love and care that goes into each dish is so apparent, and I appreciate so much the respect paid to quality ingredients.", "author": "L C."}

The food doesn't wow and the offerings aren't new and scary.  It's food they are familiar with. They want to impress you by taking you somewhere nice and fancy and seemingly trendy for SF.  It's huge with different levels of seating and you can get tons of different wines here and there is valet parking so the grandparents aren't left to find street parking and walk around Market Street.\n\nThe menu is a little un-inspiring.  There wasn't anything in particular that I had to have.  We didn't order the chicken but our friends did and it was a delicious chicken.  It was moist and the bread salad was very good since it had soaked up the juices form the chicken.  It's just not something I'm dying to wait 1 hour for or split with someone.  Their menu changes every 2 weeks except for the caesar salad and the chicken.  I had the fish dish and it was fine.  Nothing notable to say either way.  My husband had the squab and same thought.  The caesar salad was very good and enough for 2 people to share.  I did like that salad.\n\nThe dessert menu was the same, un-inspiring.  We opted for the cheese plate and I have definitely had better.  The cheese was good but the accompaniments were meh.\n\nService was very attentive and pleasant.

I read in other reviews that the plate was too large - but my friend and I (both small Asian girl types) obliterated the entire plate, and we spent the last 15 minutes of our wait longingly staring (and SIGHING) at the other plates of fries the servers were holding as they passed by us. \n\nTrue to promise, I think my time was 1 hour and 3 minutes after we sat down, the chicken came out!

It was really good, but I don't know about must trying before I die - or even wanting to pay $48 for it again. It was definitely food enough for 2 people, plus. My friend and I had to pack a few chicken pieces home as leftovers. Maybe we overdid it on the fries? \n\nSo with regards to the famous chicken, am I glad to have tried it? Sure. Will I try it again. Nooooope. There were too many other things in the menu that caught my eye, and the chicken wasn't SUPER OMG AMAZING ball of awesome in my mouth - it was just, \"pretty good.\" Plus, overpriced. I think if it was priced more at ~$40, it would be much more satisfactory for the value. \n\nOverall, I'd rate it a 3.5 stars (based on the fries, it'd be 4 stars, but with the overhyped chicken, I dropped it to 3 stars). \n\nThe roasted chicken and bread salad at Zuni is #2 on the 2012 7x7 100 Big Eats list.", "author": "Lena Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-06-09", "description": "I write this review with the disappointment of a 1000 Harold Camping followers on May 22, 2011.\n\nAfter spending more than an hour earlier this week at a restaurant discussing food at another restaurant, I decided to try said restaurant tonight: Zuni Caf\u00e9.\n\nPerhaps my hopes were too high.  Perhaps my expectations were too lofty, but nothing I tasted was fantastic, and one of the dishes - a simple salad - wasn't even good!\n\nMy friend and I looked over the menu with curiosity... wondering what 'squab' was and ultimately looking it up and laughing before definitively deciding to pass and keep looking at the other options (upon googling, we found 'squab' to be pigeon, which neither one of us were down to try).  I decided on the quail appetizer with a side of the Caesar salad after being persuaded from my original choice of the arugula salad.  The waiter told me the Caesar was 'a signature at Zuni,' so I figured I would go with the masses.  He tried to tell me that the quail would be too small and that I would want an entr\u00e9e, but after eating beyond measure for the better part of the last week, I decided less was more and to go with my gut (instead of against it).\n\nWhen a second waiter brought the quail, I noticed that it was larger than the waiter pitched it as and began to eat.  It didn't look like quail much or even taste like quail much, but it had been awhile since I had quail even so I just thought I was mistaken.  As I started to eat, our original waiter came by the table and apologized:\n\n\"I'm sorry, but there was a mix up with your order.  You received the squab entr\u00e9e.\" (I could almost FEEL my friend stifling a laugh).   \"Don't worry though,\" he continued. \"We won't charge you for it.\"\n\nI told him it was fine and kept eating. The squab didn't taste so bad after I stopped thinking of flying rats in NYC and started thinking of, well, pigeon. Ok, no... I am trying to make it better with revisionist history. The minute I knew what I was eating, it was harder to eat it.  Pigeon isn't exactly a delicacy in demand around these parts.\n\nI moved on to the Caesar salad thinking it could save me from the awkwardness that became my meal, but was further repelled.  How do you mess us Caesar salad? Much less a 'signature' Caesar Salad?  The dressing was not Caesar in the least and had a bit of a tangy taste.  I thought maybe, just maybe, I was being unfair because I was still disappointed about being fed a flying rat, so I had my friend take a bite without mentioning my thoughts about it.  Her face turned up the same way.  \"It's tangy,\" she complained.  \"I know,\" I commiserated.  I couldn't understand.\n\nThe waiter didn't come back for awhile, so I finally flagged down another waiter and asked him to get our waiter.  When he arrived, I told him I was not pleased with the salad (which, save for about three pieces of lettuce, was still completely intact, croutons and all).  Instead of just taking it, he asked me why.  Rude, but fair I supposed.  I replied, informing him it was 'tangy and odd.'  He was kind enough, apologized, and asked if he could get me anything else.  I asked for the original salad I wanted before being persuaded otherwise: the arugula salad.\n\nI wish I could tell you how it was, but I can't.  After another 20 minutes of waiting, my replacement salad still hadn't come and my friend was more than done with her plate... in fact, it had already been cleared away from the table.  I informed the other waiter (since our original was once again M.I.A.)  that I didn't want the replacement salad now because it had taken too long to get it and we were ready to leave. \n\nThe manager stopped by our table about 10 minutes later, apologizing for the issue with the salad.  He was very kind and I told him it was ok, but we just had to get going at this point.  I also told him that my friend enjoyed her meal very much (the pork chops and turnip greens) and that the wine was perfect, so it wasn't all a loss. Pleasant smiles were exchanged and he brought us a bill.\n\nUpon opening it though, I found that we were indeed charged for the quail, even though I never received it and was told the squab/pigeon would be free since it wasn't what I order to begin with. I flagged down the manager again to let him know of the mistake and he said that they only charged for the quail because it was a $13-appetizer and the squab that I received was a $30-entr\u00e9e.  He tried to pitch getting the WRONG meal as a deal... a meal I laughed at when reading the menu and dismissed as not even a remote possibility.  \"No sir, you are mistaken.  That is not what the waiter said,\" I said.\n\nHe took the receipt back and came back with the right one.\n\nWe paid and got the hell out of dodge as quickly as possible.  I was honestly embarrassed.  I had picked the place to meet my friend (whom I hadn't seen in 10 years!) and I had raved about all the good things I heard about it.  Once there, all I wanted to do was crawl under the table!", "author": "Elsa M."}

A veritable bargain at $6 for two large bowls I would recommend this without hesitation.\n\nWith the table next to us thankfully clearing out and the service stepping up a notch to keep water and coffee full the arrival of our main course, a dish considered by some to be the #1 \"must try\" dish in San Francisco, was announced by the hostess first rearranging our silverware to accommodate the plate and then by an aroma somewhere between sweet and savory, vinegar and rosemary, garlic and onion...and utterly enticing.\n\nDescribed in the menu as \"Roasted chicken for two with warm bread salad with scallions, currants, and pine nuts\" but invariably more than the sum of its parts enough has been written about Zuni Caf\u00e9's chicken to fill a book, but carrying such a hefty price tag I can only say it is worth the price largely because it redefines any preconceived notions you may have about chicken being boring.  Beginning first with the bird itself-uniformly succulent and wowing you at each turn with its subtleties the crisp skin was nearly shattering and briny yet lacking fattiness and grease while the flesh was so moist I could have been fooled to believe it was sous-vide.  Moving on to the bread salad-at times crispy and others soaked with chicken drippings and olive oil-I absolutely loved the manner in which it augmented the chicken's taste with the sweetness of currants poking through with one bite and then the bitter mustard greens with another all under the veil of occasionally spicy notes of black pepper bringing the marjoram, garlic, and onion to full attention.\n\nEating slowly as we chatted I first enjoyed a breast, then a leg, and then a thigh plus a substantial amount of the salad before I realized just how big the bird was and taking into consideration my plans for the evening I decided the better part of valor was to stop here-a gesture that provided Jeff with at least lunch and possibly dinner for the following day-and commending us on our effort the hostess collected our plate and returned it to the kitchen for packaging before returning and offering us dessert which we considered but declined and subsequently presenting the bill-a tab that really did not seem all that out of line given the quality and quantity of the food.\n\nHaving heard some people complain that Zuni is expensive for what it is; essentially food you could just as easily prepare at home I will note that while this may be true the fact of the matter is that I don't often cook like this at home and when I do it rarely is this good.", "author": "Michael U."}

Ever since I stumbled upon 7x7's list of The 10 Best Burgers in San Francisco, I've been systematically crossing off places on that list. I have been devouring fancy burgers like a mad man and justifying it by noting, that you know, the patties are made from grass fed beef, thus sustainable and thus good for me and Mother Earth. Guilt free.  \n\nI came for lunch on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. Zuni Cafe is located in an interesting intersection point of San Francisco. If you head north and you are in Hayes Valley, a rather well-to-do and fou-fou neighborhood, but if you head south down Market St. you are entering the danger zone (okay, I exaggerate).\n\nAnyway. The burger here is delicious to say the least. It's definitely not the best I've had in San Francisco, but still worthy enough to be listed as one of the best. For that reason alone I applaud you.\n\nThe burger patty, made with grass fed beef obviously, was juicy and delicious. I'm not sure if these are the appropriate adjectives, but the meat was airy and almost \"light.\" I believe the patty is hand made in the sense that they grind their own meat. No, no, no, I don't mean \"grind your meat\" in a bored and lonely Friday night sort of way, but in a well-crafted, artisan, and do-it-yourself sort of way.\n\nThey forgo the traditional burger bun and instead use some sort of spongy type of bread (pardon my lack of bread knowledge). It was an interesting choice, but I would have much preferred the traditional bun.\n\nThe burger comes with a side of pickled veggies that are fresh and crisp. I also ordered a side of shoe string potato fries. These were annoying to eat. They are extremely tiny and difficult to grab. They lacked the texture and grab-ability of your traditional steak fries. They reminded me of the fried veggie sticks that you can get at your local convenience store. \n\nMy friend ordered some pizza thing. It wasn't overly memorable, so I don't remember the deets about it. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed Zuni Caf\u00e9 and would definitely come back here. The food is definitely very summer-y. The giant glass windows that surround this place allows your eyes to wander and see the hustle and bustle of Upper Market. Just try not to look southward down Market, you might see something unpleasant..", "author": "Allan Y."}

We were looking for a breakfast spot, but didn't want to wait in the ridiculous lines at other breakfast places and Zuni took reservations. I heard Zuni was good and its been around for almost ever, so why not good it a whirl. \n\nFirstly, I did my research and saw that their brunch menu had several interesting menu items that I was excited to order. However, when I got there, the menu was quite different and offered 2 actual breakfast dishes that wasn't too exciting. \n\nI got the scrambled eggs with chives, chicken sausage, and beet salad. Overall, this has been one of the most disappointing dishes I've ever ordered at an \"established\" restaurant. The eggs were extremely boring, just had chives thrown in there and it was a TINY portion!!! It was literally the size of my palm (and I have medium sized hands!) and I finished it in less than 5-6 bites. The chicken sausage was nothing to get all riled up about. However, the beet salad was good. To top it off it was $16.50!!! Boring eggs, boring sausage, good salad for $16.50??? You got to be kidding me... I ate at Plow a few days ago and I got totally stuffed with the the Plow dish for $14. \n\nI left hungry and a bit taken a back. I was totally unimpressed with this place. I have heard that their chicken dish at dinner was good, but after having a very uninspiring brunch, I may have to hold off on another visit at Zuni. \n\nOtherwise, service was whatever, you can tell they hire the crappy servers during lunch time as they didn't give a crap about their jobs and just simply \"did their jobs\".

Their caesar salad was outstanding, however. The romaine was crisp, the dressing that perfect balance of lemon, creamy and fishy.

The sesame encrusted petrale sole was also very good, although perhaps a touch over crusted with the sesame for my taste, but still delicious. The oysters were terrific, fresh, different per selection and the sides were good as well.  I wish I paid more attention to how they prepared the sides as I'd like to replicate it at home.  The Ceaser salad was hand dressed per plate and also very good.\n\nIt says clearly on the menu that if you want the roasted chicken (which is purportedly very good but I never tried it) that you'll have to wait for at least an hour.

Yeah, that too.\n\nI do have to take away one star for what seems to be a weird service system. We had 2 separate servers and 3 bussers during our dinner. Between them, the white wine I ordered right when we got seated wasn't delivered till 30 minutes after. The table next to me spilled some water that hit our table, and that took another busser to clean up. And while it says \"1 hour to prepare\" on the menu, our bird took about an hour and a half. Not bad while you're toasting to your marriage with your hubby, but not ideal in any other circumstance.", "author": "steve s."}

You've read plenty of reviews, and you're not convinced you want to wait the extra time? Do it. There's something very warm, and satisfying about a simple roast chicken, and while Ive made roast chicken plenty of times at home, it doesn't ever quite taste as great as the Zuni Cafe's. It's a must share with the table, and while I've had it before, I look forward to sharing each time I visit. I also had an amazing corn soup with pasilla peppers, and a touch of cream. The soup was just great. I should mention that I am writing this review months after my dinner at Zuni, but I remember this corn soup as if it were yesterday. I've attempted to recreate this soup plenty of times, but Im always missing something...Ill get it one day.\n\nThe service was spot on, the location is great with plenty of public transportation access, and the space is unique.

I was initially going to give this place a 4 stars, but I haven't been able to stop thinking about the chicken and bread salad since I left, so now I am upgrading it to 5. The only thing holding this place back from being a full 5.5 is the fact that the menu is pretty limited, and the chicken takes one hour to cook - no shortcuts, no pre-ordering, and no exceptions.

There was nothing else, but the pure essence of the chicken and that's how good it is at Zuni. You don't need anything else but chicken. No lemon. No rosemary. No BBQ sauce. Just pure chicken. So flavorful and evenly moist and tender throughout. No unpure or dry chicken anywhere. \n\nAnd as good as the chicken was, the bread salad was even better in my opinion. I could have just gorged on that alone. Crispy and at the same time soaked with the jus from the chicken. The bread, the pine nuts, the currents, and the chicken made for an incredible taste sensation.\n\nThe roast chicken (which they say is for two, but would serve four comfortably) was too much for me and my friend for dinner, so I had the chicken cold the next day for lunch.

It certainly is one of the most authentic, with real one-piece romaine hearts and copious sardines, along with a caesar dressing that is probably handmade.  The burgers are good, too, if a bit small compared to the competition at similar restaurants in SF.  \n\nZuni also has a very open, sleek, yet convivial atmosphere.  The patina on the real copper bar is a nice European-feeling touch.  Zuni isn't cheap, but it does represent good, consistent value and I believe it is one of those landmark restaurants that truly help give San Francisco its reputation for food lovers.  It isn't one of those stuffy, very expensive restaurants with monthlong waiting lists.  Instead, it's a place that you can drop in, sit at the large, inviting bar, grab a glass of wine, and casually pick something to eat from the bar menu if you want.

I walked a few blocks to Duboce Triangle with the goal of devouring the much-heralded burger at Zuni Cafe. \n\nNow I had been to Zuni more than 4 years ago and enjoyed some choice, fresh oysters as part of a more traditional meal from their French/Italian menu but I only got word about their prized burger well after that visit.\n\nSitting down in the sunlight pouring through the large gallery windows of their narrow building alongside Market St, I began to sip on a Grenach-Syrah blend and patiently awaited my burger.  I chose gorgonzola and some grilled onions as my toppings and there were a few others from which to choose but I soon discovered that none were necessary; the burger stood soundly on its own.  The burger is a Mesquite-grilled house-ground chuck on rosemary foccacia with garden lettuce, red onion, aioli, and Zuni pickles.  It was juicy and quite flavorful, and the pungent cheese did nothing but accentuate a tremendous cut of meat and its rich flavor. \n\nI only had to wait a scant 10 minutes for my burger but I learned later that it had waited 24 hours for me!  That's how long it's pre-seasoned but only with salt, highlighting again the the quality of the organic meat.\n\nI don't recall specifically what I had during that first Zuni outing 4 years back, only that it was good.  But it's moot now because I recommend you go and try the burger first and foremost and don't balk at the $17 price, it's well worth it.", "author": "Saminda W."}

As I cook myself there are a couple of things I never order in restaurants such as roasted chicken and salmon but as we were a large party TIna convinced us to order the whole roasted chicken and who knew currants were such a nice accompaniment to chicken?\n\nMusts for dinner - the roasted chicken, ahi tuna - seared to perfection and oysters from the daily selection. The wine list is incredible and several local brewery beers are listed for those beer lovers dining here. The chocolate mousse served for dessert was so delicious we had to order more. \n\nA must for every foodie passing through SF and if you don't consider yourself a foodie but if you love eating local and California style cuisine Zuni empitomizes this to the core. Come hungry. Leave happy. And if you're like me and not fortunate enough to live in San Francisco (yet) make sure to pick up a copy of the Zuni cook book - I did :)", "author": "Michelle T."}

Zuni is much more of a treat for dinner, and it's where this place truly shines as a San Francisco institution.\n\nCame here for my birthday a few weeks ago with a few friends and had a delightful evening here, thanks to the following dishes: \n\npork tenderloin - by far the best dish on the menu. The pork was tender, succulent, and full of flavor.\n\nahi tuna - well-prepared and great flavor, but wouldn't be on the top of my list when I come back to Zuni.\n\nguinea hen - would you believe me if I told you it tastes like chicken? Well after trying their guinea hen, it'll be a while before I go back to regular old chicken. This dish spoiled me for good!\n\norechiette/gnocchi pasta - very rich, wonderful pasta with knockout cheeses/sauce\n\nOur server, Brenna, was terrific and very sincerely attentive to our table throughout the evening. Really on top of her game. \n\nAside from the amazing food here all around, it's worth a visit just to get a load of the incredible physical space Zuni has.

The chicken's extra moist and the appetizers and other dishes are awesome. \nUnfortunately for me, my experience (not food) wasn't as great as others. \n\nFew reasons as to why Zuni's one of those \"glad-I-tried-it,-but-I-won't-go-back\" restaurants: \n- Our Server: He missed one of our appetizer orders, and when we asked about it, he looked at us as if that item didn't even exist on the menu. He then later apologized for the miscommuncation. \n\n-Not once did he check up on us to see how we were doing fully knowing it's an \"hour\" wait for the chicken. After our miscommunication and chicken mishap? He came by more than 3 times. even to refill the waters! \n\n-A table across from us received their chicken first and we were there a good 30 mins before they sat down. Our server explained that the chicken takes 1 hour to cook and that ours went into the oven at 7:15 and that it was 8:16 and \"should be out in a bit\". He then tells us that since the chicken was in at 7:15 and (looks at his watch) it was 8:16 the \"chicken should be ready shortly.\" \nDespite the fact that I'm Chinese, my math sucks BUT... if it takes an hour for the chicken to cook, why did the other table's chicken only take 45 mins (7:30 seating with chicken out at  8:10)? \n\nHe apologizes for the wait and the miscommunication on the missing appetizer order and gives us shoestring \"fun\" fries. \"They're fun!\" \nI hate it when I go to a restaurant and the servers think you're fresh out of college and ignore you until you approach THEM about the status of your entree or correct them on a missing dish. I hate it when they don't check up on you knowing that your entree will take about one hour to cook. He must've passed by us at least 10 times before our main entrees arrived, but not once did he stop by to see if we were alright. I hate it when they apologize and try to send out a \"sorry dish\" called \"fun fries\" as if to lighten the mood. Is it an ego thing? Because he was clearly older than us that he can give off this attitude when he served us? I know this isn't some fancy schmancy restaurant, I don't expect GREAT service but some good service would've been nice. \n\nFor some reason, I don't think it's the kitchen/chef's fault even though He said the Chef apologizes.\nThe FOOD was GOOD... but the service screwed Zuni over.

Waiting for tables at 9PM? Did you suddenly forget how many tables you can turn over on a Saturday night? Did you accept too many walk-ins? Either way, that's a front office problem right there. You should be fired. After squeezing in, no one asked to take our coats, hats, or umbrellas. We were expected to fend for ourselves. Also, no one asked us if we had a reservation, if we wanted to eat, or even if we were there to rob the place. They just talked with each other, looked at us, and kept talking. Also, we're not dressed like hobos -- so it's not like they were turning their noses up at us. They were just flat out ignoring us. We were told to \"wait at the bar\" which was a teeming throng of people waiting to get both drinks and a table.\n\nWhile waiting for our table, a busboy smashed into me, spilling my drink and causing me to drop my hat and gloves. Rather than apologizing, he turned around and asked in broken Spanglish if he did that. He knew damned well that he did that. He walked away without apologizing. At least someone finally realized what was going on and came by to check our coats -- 20 minutes after we had arrived. Better late than never.\n\nWe waited some more and during this time, I noticed the staff was \"creating\" new tables. Spare 2 feet against a wall? Throw a table there with two chairs. Another sign of screwed up reservations. Finally, our table was ready (30 minutes late) and they led us to it through this crazy maze of tight spaces and having to dodge people. When we got to our table, we were like WTF we could have just walked straight up the back stairs.\n\nThe waiter knew the headlines about the daily specials, but none of the details.

Rinky and I drove into SF and found a parking spot right behind Anna on Market, a scant block away from the restaurant.  It helps to meet at 11:30.  We walked over and joined a very small milling throng waiting for the door to be opened.  When we were admitted it didn't take long to sort everyone out and to seat us.\n\nThe building is a flatiron w/ a bar along the Market Street windows in the first room.  The bartender offered us drinks while we waited but we didn't take him up on it.  There were a few tables by the bar and then more and larger tables in an adjacent room and even more tables in the room after that.  There are stairs behind the hostess stand to a loft-like upstairs dining area.  We were seated in front of the fireplace in the third room.  There were few tables filled when we arrived but they pretty much all filled as we ate.  Ceilings were high and the artwork on the walls was original and attractive.\n\nService was flawless, friendly and attentive.  We immediately ordered the chicken as we knew it would take about an hour.  Once the chicken was ordered we decided to share an order of shoestring potatoes, one of polenta and one of onion soup.  We were brought a plate of bread w/ butter, crusty, tasty, dense bread that was a pleasure to eat.  I ordered tea and Anna ordered coffee.  Rinky drank water.  My tea was in a small, square metal pot and was refilled w/ water three times.  The tea remained strong and tasty.  The shoestring potatoes were very flavorful, w/ just the right amount of salt, although not all of them were as crisp as they should have been.  A later order being delivered to another table was more uniformly golden.  Ours was like the first waffle.  Not bad, but not the best.  The polenta was thick and comforting, perfect for a rainy day.  The onion soup was light and delicious, w/ lovely, light croutons and thinly sliced onions.  \n\nWhen the chicken arrived it had been cut into pieces (the leg separated from the thigh, which I liked), atop a bread pudding of the same bread as the croutons in the soup, w/ lightly dressed greens garnishing the chicken.  The chicken was moist and slightly smoky w/ crisp skin.  The bread pudding was light but rich and was flavored w/ some of the salad dressing.  The greens were very tasty.  It was a generous portion (as well it might be for $48) and we had enough for me to take home a box w/ a couple of pieces of chicken, some bread pudding and greens for Alan.  For desert we shared a chocolate pot de creme.  It was rich and smooth, served in a small white ramekin.  It was just the taste we wanted to end our meal.", "author": "Toni M."}

Costco and Pak N Save have pretty tasty chickens for somewhere between $5-$7, so to inflate the cost of a chicken ten fold seems a tad bit extreme. in order to not over hype the chicken and shatter our visions of the most amazing chicken we were supposedly going to eat, we kept demoting the chicken so that when we ate it we wouldn't be disappointed. exchanges like \"i'm glad you're a great conversationalist because this chicken we're going to eat is probably going to be horrible,\" and \"this is going to be the worst meal of our lives!\" \n\nand finally one stormy day we were going to eat chicken and either be very pleased or super disappointed. and very pleased we were! the chicken was perfectly crisp and seasoned. every piece i had was still juicy (except we didn't eat the breast so who knows) and flavorful. still, i'd rather pay $5 for a decent chicken than $50 for a very good chicken. but......\n\nbut the shining star was the bread salad. chewy and crispy all at the same time. buttery (more like olive oily and chicken drippings-y) and tossed with a nice vinegarette. it was my favorite part of dinner. over the past few weeks i've found that my mind wanders back to the day where the bread salad and i first met and my hopes of revisiting heighten. if i could order the bread salad on it's own, i would. but i don't think that's an option and i don't know when i'd be willing to pay $50 so that i could get to eat revamped and incredibly amazing tasty stale bread again. le sigh. \n\n---THANKS HELEN!!!!", "author": "Regina C."}

The restaurant was highly recommended by a co worker. Of course we made a reservation.  Our overall experience were okay, not impressive!! We tried their famous chicken for two. Definitely a well roasted chicken. Very moist!!  However, the bread salad mixed in the plate was too hard for me.  I think it was over price.  It's good but not all much better than a rotisserie chicken you can get at Costco. Which I believed it's only 6-7 bucks at Costco. We ordered oysters, shrimps, clams as well. The oysters were fresh. The shrimp with head were not really up to par. The shrimp came out little over cook. I think if they left the head and d-shell the shrimp will be better.   I think the overall food quality compare to the price they charged is over rated.  They really need to impress me if they charge that much. I don't think their plating is all that nice either. They are on the sloppy end.  I have been to other restaurants with the same price range and their food were like art. Also their service sux!!  The bartender was rude. She taken our order halfway and walked off.   We then saw her taking order from other people.  When we mentioned to her that she haven't finish taking our order she said to us that well everyone here wants to order from me you just have to wait.  Just plain rude!!

First we ordered a round of drinks.  She had a Hendricks martini, and I asked for a gin and tonic.  Waiter didn't ask my preference of gin, which was strange, and I should have told him, but I plum forgot, and I ended up with a (regular, not Sapphire) Bombay gin and tonic, which was not my choice of gin at all...!  We thought about ordering the chicken for two dish, but decided against it, because we don't come out that much, so separate entrees seemed to provide more variety.\n\nWe ordered a starter of a yellowfin tuna confit, which turned out to be incorporated into a pasta dish.  It was tasty, but my pasta was definitely a little undercooked.  I wanted to eat it, but unfortunately I had to send it back.  I hate sending stuff back to the kitchen.  If I can suck it up and eat it, then I will, but it was practically bone dry in the middle and could not pass for al dente.\n\nWe had the Blue Nose Bass for the next course.  The caper sauce was delicious, as was the grilled cabbage. Then following that, we had the Pork and the bread salad on the side.  Both dishes were good, but not outstanding.  \n\nTo be honest, I really really wanted to like Zuni.  I've been reading reviews about their famed burgers, but the experience as a whole fell short.  The ambience was wonderful.  Beautiful building, artwork, layout of the dining area, great lighting.  I loved how the waiter suggested we course the meal and how they split all the dishes for us.  Friends of mine who like Zuni tell me when it's good, it's REALLY good, but it is not consistently good.

For me it's up there with -- dare I say better than? -- Peter Luger's steak.  People complain about the price, but for $50 the roast chicken at Zuni feeds more than \"Steak for Two\" at Luger at nearly half the cost.  I went with my dad (he was visiting from New York) who paid for everything, including the $30 glass of Glenfarclas I drank just to try something new.  That sweetened the deal.", "author": "Isaac C."}

This was another restaurant that people were raving about, but I wasn't as impressed with the chicken and bread dish that takes an hour to cook that everyone was so quick to suggest I order. Yes, the chicken came out tender, but it needed more juice or it needed to come with more salad. Something was missing.\n\nI also ordered the mussels. I LOVE mussels but there was NO sauce underneath the mussels! I thought the whole point was to be able to dip your bread in it?! It was good however, that there were breadcrumbs as a topping over them. That made it interesting.\n\nI'm not sure I'd go back to Zuni.

Our cocktails took about 20 minutes to arrive and that was just the start of it.\n\nI ordered the lamb and sausage, only to learn about 15 minutes later they were out of lamb. I don't understand restaurants that have a short menu and run out of an item. Instead, I had to jump to the halibut - it's really hard to go from a lamb mood to a halibut. No steak on the menu, no pork. Just a lot of fish and the rotisserie chicken (which was not an option since it's for 2 and my friend already ordered something else). What a waste of money.\n\nMy friends meal arrived about 20 minutes before mine so she got to eat alone. Then my halibut dish arrived. Halibut was covered with peppers. The peppers were really spicy and that halibut NEEDED the peppers to have any flavor. BLAND, BLAND, BLAND.\n\nDrinks were boring, so was the appetizer. I hoped to recover with the dessert. Bread pudding with berries. I asked the waitress if the berries included strawberries, since I was allergic. She was once again in a different world, thinking that I WANTED strawberries and trying to find them. Finally we got the dish without strawberries (which was actually never part of the pudding) and well. It was BLAND.\n\nNet, my share of the meal was $95... if this was a great meal, fine. Fair enough. But it was bland and boring. I even had to eat more once I got home to get something a bit more flavorful in my mouth.", "author": "Ghazaleh K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-29", "description": "No wonder Zuni is such a classic SF establishment.  The menu might look not as hip or tintriguing as your Korean tacos or foam gelees or whatever your fad du jour is, but there is a reason why it's hard to find a table on a random weekend for lunch.  \n\nFortunately a friend rushed there when it first opened at 11:30 and scored us a table.  Despite not having the full party present, we were seated.  It felt sadistically satisfying to see people trickling in, jammed at the small door way.  They can see and smell our delicious food, but the wait for an available table will be long. \n\nThis long wait is partly due to the small space---long and narrow, perched on a rather random part of Market, not a lot of shops near by but nevertheless difficult to score a parking.  It is also exacebated by the famous roasted chicken.  I know it's $48 and it'll take an hour, but if it's your first time at Zuni, it's kind of a must to order.  Our lunch ended up being 2 hours.\n\nWhile waiting for our slowly roasting chicken, five of us ordered some plates to share.  The Zuni caesar salad was beautiful.  I have always hated caesar salad for its soggy leaves and over powering garlic dressing.  But this is different.  The lettuce crisp, croutons flavorful.  And you can really taste the anchovies. \n\nPizza with ricotta was delicious.  Healthy? No.  The paper-thin dough is drenched in olive oil.  But it sure was tasty.  \n\nThe fettucine was equally simple and delicious.  It seemed like nothing but noodles and peas, but I very much enjoyed it. \n\nDuck was excellent as well.  Flavorful meat, not too fatty or greasy. \n\nFinally, the chicken arrives!  I can't believe it's for two.  Five of us dug in, and managed to finish a little over half.  I must say, I have never been a huge fan of roasted chicken, and Zuni didn't manage to convert me.  The meat didn't seem to be that flavorful or interesting.  What I did love, was the bread salad hidden underneath the chicken.  Did the bread cook with the chicken and therefore soaked in chicken fat?  Or did they just smear a ton of butter?  I don't know, but it sure was delicious.  With the right amount of dried currents and pine nuts and mustardy greens, I couldn't stop eating it.  \n\nI wish they would sell just the chicken bread for like $10 or something.  Or I will need to put up a craiglist listing asking for some counterpart who only wants to eat the chicken.  Then I'd be there all the time.\n\nService was fantastic.  Price, for the quantity and quality, was very fair.  This would be a good place to take out-of-towners to, as a good embodiment of SF food.", "author": "Candice B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-03-18", "description": "I'm going to break this down very concisely, since there are so many reviews of this place:\n\nThe Space:  cramped, awkward, overly crowded.  Seating is only comfortable if you have a very small butt.\n\nThe Servers:  polite, but scarce, hard to flag down.\n\nNoise Level:  deafening.  It's hard to hear the person on the other side of the really tiny table you're sitting at.\n\nThe Crowd:  definitely yuppie, as close to the Marina crowd as this neighborhood gets.  One guesses many opera/ballet/symphony goers stop here before catching their performance.  Maybe cruise-y if you're a gay male, but otherwise, just claustrophobic.\n\nThe Food:  splendid.  Perfectly cooked fish that isn't fishy.  Sauces are flavorful, interesting, and there is just enough on your plate to make your mouth happy.  Shoe-string potatoes shouldn't be missed.  Vegetables are appetizing, even for me, which is impressive, since many restaurants make their veggies wholey unappetizing.  Portion size is just right, unless you have a very big appetite.  I don't, and I finished almost all of my entree.\n\nThe Price:  Pricey, but given the calibre of the food, you don't get the feeling that this place is a clip joint...in face, my fish dish felt like it was worth the $25 or so I paid for it.  I rarely feel that way about fish dishes at restaurants.  Wine is very pricey, luckily I don't usually drink much of it.  Appetizer of shoestring potatoes felt overpriced for what it was, but then, it was in line with the other prices.\n\nOverall:  I'd go back here.  Not often, but once in a while, when I'm on my way to the ballet and making it a special night.  Otherwise, I'd generally prefer to go somewhere less expensive where I know I'd get an equally delicious meal, but without the slight aura of pretentious restauranteurship that this place exudes.  Zuni Cafe wants so very badly to be taken seriously as a gourmet restaurant...I personally don't buy into places with pervasive hype.  However, I cannot ignore the fact this place serves good food.  So, if you're like me, leave your cynicism home, dress waaaay up, and enjoy!", "author": "Amy L."}

Everyone has raved about the chicken but to be honest, chicken is chicken. I have had Jonathan Waxman's chicken in NY and found that to be a little overrated. Therefore, I err on the side of caution when getting hyped up about chicken.\n\nSo, a place with this type of reputation, I assume there must be something else good besides the chicken. Came for lunch/brunch. Had the rabbit salad, french toast, oysters, cocktails, egg and asparagus, and onion soup. \n\nNone of this was exceptional. It was very forgettable. Not one dish surprised me with a taste or complexity that a restaurant like this should showcase. Maybe I ordered the wrong dishes, or maybe this place is just a chicken factory. Even the cocktails were very ho hum. Service was nothing special. Polite, helpful, but not attentive. \n\nI will give it another shot for dinner.

Great layout.\n* Our server, really nice and did a great job.\n* Had a margarita.

It was really good.  And I will feel guilty for seven and half minutes after saying this, but I just didn't think it was that insanely memorable.  \n\nSo yes, there is a lot to love about this place.  And I was a bit torn on the star rating to give it . The food unfortunately did not warrant a four star rating.  Having said that, because of everything else though, I would give it another shot.

Instead, it felt very average.\n\nThe copper tones and glass-filled location are charming if you happen to be perched up on the second floor loft level. Uncommon these days to have live music at a dining venue, the piano in the bar is a nice touch,  albeit, a bit too loud for the acoustics of the space.\n\nService was fair and the bread disappeared faster than your unlocked bike in the Mission. You can only imagine...\n\nThe starter of clams with harissa, kale and chickpeas was a gold star. If only there was some bread to soak up the rest of the sauce, every last drop would have been enjoyed.\n\nThe much lauded chicken under a brick was indeed succulent and flavorful and the 'bread salad' (ie. giant croutons) managed to absorb all the juices and fats possible so as to result is nothing but deliciousness. Then again, it's only a chicken, and it wasn't really anything that special in the end. To wait the hour for this bird-on-bread was tolerable but I wouldn't send my friends here for this dish.\n\nAnd while you wait for your chicken, grab a cocktail or some oysters, not one but three glasses of red wine were flops. Of the five or six offered by the glass, the three tried (Pinot Noir, Zinfandel and Syrah) were all mellow and mild, uncharacteristic of these varietals. The waiter seemed a bit put off when I said how mellow they were and I wanted a little boldness. I could have said the three tasted nearly identical and I do indeed like grape juice but not for $10 a glass.\n\nSo grab a date, a drink at the bar, sling a few oysters (or clams) and enjoy the music. The rest can stay under a brick.", "author": "Alissa A."}

It's always poppin, it's always happening.  It always looks like the people who eat there have \"Made-It\" in life.  Yeah, so now you know how much hype I gave this place before trying it. \n\nBest way to describe my visit is in chronological order. \n\nThe day after I made reservations, I read a blog that said Hillary Clinton went there and was pounding back whiskey sours.  So while I waited for my table I got a \"Hillary\" at the bar (same bartender from when Hilz was there too) + One Star.\n\nThen when we were seated, we got to go upstairs through uber snooty, uber art-gallery type of feng shui spacing that was the upstairs dining area. It was nice, I thoroughly enjoyed walking through the each to half level to reach our table on the mezzanine.  Exciting!  + One Star.\n\nThen then we ordered food.  First we started with wine glasses, then went for a bottle.  Ordered a ton of starters and sides.  Most of the appetizers were just alright.  Good, but not up to expectations of a place run by Chez Panisse Alumni.  The ricotta gnocchi was the stand-out.  It was like just cheese rolled and baked in a light potato starchy crust. Awesome.  The rest was just - eh (I had high hopes) - One Star.\n\nThen we got our Warm Bread Salad Roasted Chicken.  If you have read the reviews, then you know that you have to order this. What I didn't know until now is this fact;  the chicken is all you should order. Easily the highlight of my meal.  The chicken had a delicious vinegrette flavor all throughout.  The bread was warm and crusty in some parts, warm and oh-so-comforting in others.  We should have just ordered two of these, no joke.  + Two Stars. \n\nSo here we stand at 4 stars.

To fill in our 1 hour period of time we drank a bottle of wine, and ordered snacks - we were hungry, and didn't realize the chicken would feed a family. We ordered the heaping plate of fries, every single table seemed to have an order of this so I couldn't resist, plus I love me some fries and ketchup! They were standard, but still satisfied a french fry lover. We also ordered the ricotta gnocchi, I really really liked this and could have eaten a whole bowl of it. Unlike the other food this was super light and simple only dressed in olive oil and salt and pepper. The ricotta gnocchi were like little melty clouds on your tongue, mmm. Overall, I left satisfied and we had a doggie bag that was enough for the 2 of us for lunch the next day (still tasted good the next day plus I put the bread dressing in the oven to get toasty and I was much less soggy!).", "author": "Nicole L."}

I remember thinking it was a good but not great meal back then.  Since 7x7 recommended the Zuni burger, I wanted to check it out... \n\nIt was definitely an expensive burger.  At $13 it would be comparable in price to other restaurant premium burgers in the city (i.e. grass-fed beef from one of the ranches in Marin county).  However, the burger came with nothing but a meat patty and 2 buns.  Literally everything else was extra - the cheese, fries, tomatoes, onions.  So, with cheese, onions, tomatoes and fries, you're looking at ~$20 something bucks for a burger.  Now, that's even expensive for SF!\n\nPrice aside, I would be delighted if it were a great burger, but it was extremely mediocre.  The cold and somewhat dry Foccacia used as buns just didn't really work well with the burger (it was not good Foccacia).  \n\nThe Arugula salad we ordered at $9 (under salads and apps) was so small that it would even be considered tiny if it were a side salad that came with a sandwich or burger.... And there was nothing to the salad except Arugula, olive oil and vinegar... now that's a pricey, mini-sized and rather boring/plain salad. \n\nPerhaps their burger and their salads are not what one should order at Zuni, but I am definitely not rushing back anytime soon....", "author": "Paul K."}

The server said it would be no problem to order the chicken.  Since it was my first time at Zuni, I wanted to try that most of all.  We started with the Caesar salad and the scallops with little gems.  Both of these were rather tasty.  I found the scallops dish flavorful, but lacking.  I would have even appreciated 5 little gem lettuce leaves, opposed to the 3 that were on the plate.  However, when the chicken came, I was glad I was not full of lettuce.  The chicken is a radiant dish.  It has optimal flavor.  I was hooked.  I loved the toasted bread salad tossed in frissee, currants, pine nuts, and drippings.  It was a great combination with the crispy skinned chicken.  My friend and I were complimenting this dish with every bite.\n  \nWe had a bottle of beaujolais with the meal, which was rather lovely as well.  I will definitely come to Zuni again, but I will order some other dishes next time.  Two gentlemen sitting next to us swore that you can easily recreate the chicken dish at home, using the Zuni cookbook.  I will be trying this at my next dinner party.

When it comes to me and food, I should never have to wait for more than half an hour. So, the fact that I was purposely waiting for an hour for a chicken to show up in front of me says a lot. Expectations were high, people. Very high.\n\nTo tie us down, we started off with the house-cured anchovies with celery, Parmesan, and ni\u00e7oise olives. It was good, but not \"blow my mind away\" good. The olive oil drizzled over it was my favorite part. It had a nice fresh taste and finish...yum.\n\nAn hour of eavesdropping on the next table's conversation later (*snore*), the chicken finally showed up. Sadly, the chicken was just OK. I've had better. In terms of quality, it was up there. But so is an organic chicken from Costco for $6.99 if you know how to cook it. The chicken was tender, but not super juicy (which is how I usually prefer my chicken to be). It could have been better seasoned, but whatever. The wings on the chicken were a little burnt, so the meat was like jerky that I would feed a dog. A dog I'm not too fond of...\n\nBest part of the meal...the bread salad. There must be crack in that bread because, boy was it good. Is it worth coming back again? Probably not. There's really no value in spending $75 on a chicken and four pieces of anchovies in my mind....especially when I can do it for a fraction of the price.", "author": "Blenda L."}

Many people have raved about their roast chicken with bread salad and I have seen many renditions of this recipe online as well as borrowed for a recipe book compilation for a bride.  Unfortunately, my expectations were not really met after trying their legendary dish.  \n\nI had Saturday lunch reservations here with a couple of friends.  I arrived early with a friend and ordered the roast chicken dish at 11:45am (my other friend was scheduled to arrive at noon) since we knew that it would take an hour for the chicken to be ready (as per their menu).  The roast chicken with bread salad is more than enough for 2 people so we decided to order tagliatelle pasta and the shoe string potatoes.  We ordered the shoe string potatoes because we (as well as the table next to us) were mesmerized by the dish when the waiter brought one out for another table.  The pasta was ok but the shoe string potatoes were good. The roast chicken came out around 1:15 or so, so it took about 1.5 hours for the dish.  The chicken was moist, but I found the underlying taste of the chicken breast I was eating a bit weird. I couldn't really put my finger on it, it was almost like they brined the chicken in white wine? I didn't think the chicken breast was seasoned well enough.  The bread pieces in the bread salad were also a bit too greasy for my preference.  The roasted salad was nice though.  I don't think I would try their roast chicken again.\n\nOn a side note, I must say that the space and architecture of the place is beautiful. There are a lot of windows allowing in lots of natural lighting.  The building of the restaurant is also in a strange angle, almost like the famous Flatiron building in NYC, so as a result, a lot of the tables were set in angles perhaps to play off of that.  Perhaps not the most efficiently arranged tables...", "author": "Kai C."}

The interior of the restaurant is beautiful with lots of large windows and exposed beams and brick; the place just generally has a great, positive open vibe.  There is a small bar area where you can stand and eat (which seems awkward but I saw some people doing it) or have a drink while you're waiting for your table. \n\nEverybody says that the chicken is the entree to get, so that's what one of my friends and I got.  As it says on the menu, it takes an hour, so definitely order appetizers (or don't come super hungry) if you're going to get the chicken.  I don't typically order chicken at restaurants because I think chicken is relatively boring and fundamentally not a very flavorful meat.  The chicken for two at Zuni Cafe is delicious, juicy and aromatic - the chicken was very tender and full of all of the flavor of the seasonings.  It is a pretty significant amount of food, and we had more than enough for the two of us - you could probably split it among three people (especially if you are getting appetizers).\n\nWe had a couple of different appetizers including the salad with heirloom tomatoes and \"avocado toasts\" (toasted bread with sliced avocado on top) and the lamb sausage.  Both were fine but not really standouts.  Most of the other people at the table got seafood dishes - sandabs and bass were on the menu that night, and people loved the sandabs.  The only complaint about the sandabs was that there were lots of bones in the sandabs but that's just how it goes with such a small fish.  We were absolutely stuffed so didn't get dessert.\n\nThe service was a little odd - our waiter seemed very nice but a little out of it.  When people asked him for recommendations, he seemed to be at a loss; similarly, when people asked him more detailed questions about the fish (texture, what kind of flavors are similar, etc.), he didn't seem to know how to answer the question.  Also, we were missing one dish at our table, and he said that the kitchen \"had an accident\" and were frying up a new fish; my friends who have worked at restaurants before said that's code for \"I forgot to put in your order\".  The other person at the table had to wait ~10 minutes for his fish to come out - not a huge deal but just a bit of a downer.", "author": "Wendy L."}

In the past year since moving to LA (after 15 in SF) and picking the book off our shelf on a whim to try my hand at a once a week meal that even I can cook, I've probably made 30 chickens. And, while not every chicken I roast at home using Judy's recipe from the book has come out as well as this one, I can remember a few that have been better, and about 3/4s were equally as tasty.  The key to her recipe is a great 3.25 lb. bird. Whole Foods birds (from any purveyor) don't cut it.  Get to a farmer's market and buy one from the source.  The other key is the salting and peppering the bird 2 days before cooking.  Do these two things, combine with an oven that can hold a decent high temp, and you can make Zuni birds, if not the bread salad, at home quite easily.  And, if you're cooking for two, the leftovers are enough for a second meal.", "author": "Joe N."}

It's probably one of the better places to be seated in the restaurant because it was out of the way and less noisy and crowded as a result.\n\nOur host loves the chicken there and ordered 2.  The chicken takes an hour to cook in the wood oven which we could see from our table.  The other guests chose to share a variety of dishes that I did not try.

Neither of these facts prevented me from having what I felt was a genuine experience there, I just thought I should mention them up front. \n\nQualifiers aside, this was one of the better meals I've had at a restaurant in a long time. I don't normally order chicken but listened to what friends and yelp people had raved about and ordered the roast chicken for two. I thought it was great; moist, flavorful and sitting on top of a delicious bread salad. For those of you who are confused by the sound of bread salad (like I was before it came to our table), it contains bread, pine nuts, currants and some greens (arugula, I think), all under the deliciously roasted chicken. The bread soaks up the juices. \n\nI've seen some comments on here questioning $50 for a chicken dish and, like I said, I didn't pay for the chicken myself, but it's the WHOLE chicken--definitely enough for two people and probably leftovers. That's $25 an entree (per person), which isn't exorbitant at all for a nicer restaurant. You just have to agree to get the same thing with another person. I'd go back and pay the $50 myself (for a special occasion)! \n\nMy dining companion and I also split another recommendation, the Caesar Salad. I'm  not a seafood fan so tend to order Caesar salads sparingly. This one was really good, right on the cusp of tasting too fishy for me, but then too good to stop eating. \n\nWe also got a few glasses of wine. I don't remember which ones but we asked the waitress for recommendations based on what we were eating and all of them were great. The service in general was spot on--attentive but low key. The wait for the chicken didn't feel too long with the wine and salad to keep us company. We sat upstairs, which felt like it might have been a little more quiet than other spots by the kitchen or bar---something to think about if you have a strong preference. All of the seating looked appealing though. \n\nWe finished the meal with two desserts: a chocolate pot de creme and a kumquat and orange glazed cake with a cardamom sauce. The pot de creme was nice in that it wasn't too sweet, the cake was also subtle (in a good way). \n\nIf you eat at pricier places on a regular basis, I could see where Zuni might warrant a 3-4 star rating, depending on the night or dish ordered but my experience was top notch.", "author": "Kiersten Y."}

Actually, the quality of the food and the service is fine and I ordinarily would have given it four stars except for the fact that the value isn't there.  To me, a good value is a huge thing.  A good example of a good value is Gary Danko.  Yes, a good meal there does not come cheap but the quality of the food, the service, the ambience etc. make it an exceptional value.  Now back to the Zuni.  One example was my caesar salad.  There was no problem with the taste or even the portion but I was charged an extra $2.50 for anchovies.  Well, a \"real\" caesar salad should come with anchovies!  Look it up!  Just like chow mein comes with noodles or fried rice comes with rice!!!  The other negative was the $15.00 hamburger my wife ordered.  It was prepared perfectly and was very tasty, but it basically came with nothing else.  Grilled onions was an extra $1.25, cheese was even more and the whole thing came on a salad plate.  No fries came with it, so we had to order a side of shoestring potato fries which was $3.50.  Those should have accompanied the hamburger at no extra charge.  So an ordinary hamburger was, without tax or tip, $19.75!  Really????  How the hell do you get away with that???  Oh, I forgot that yuppies basically don't give a shit.  They don't mind be over charged.  Keep in mind, that hamburger could have been over $22.00 if my wife had ordered cheese with it.  Is any grilled hamburger worth that???\n\nAnyway, Zuni, the previous time I dined at your establishment was about three or four years ago.  That was only because the group I was with chose it.  I dined there today because our son, who is here from London, chose it.  I would never elect to dine here on my own.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nService - 4.5 stars\nFood     - 3.5 stars\nValue -    0 stars", "author": "geoff k."}

The service is very nice, and I liked that the menu wasn't huge and overwhelming.. I don't even usually like pork.. but I saw it on another table and had to order! I'm so glad I did.  The pork chops (came with polenta and spinach, and a mushroom reduction on top. yum) were soo juicy and flavorful.. I felt like a big porker for practically finishing the entire thing. Yea, a girl.. eating a giant pork chop for lunch by herself. Imagine that! ha. For dessert, I ordered the pistachio praline ice cream. It was good.. but not amazing.. I probably wouldn't order or recommend it again. \n\nI thought the pricing was a bit more than it should be.. I paid about $50 just for myself (pork chop, glass of wine, and scoop of ice cream).. \n\nParking would probably suck here (doesn't it everywhere in SF?).. but I paid $10 for the valet.. I'm all about convenience. Gee.. I just added that all up.. Lunch for one == $60? Baller!

We got there before our reservation and hung out at the bar.  The wedged building makes for an interesting layout and I think they did a nice job with the space they had.\n\nI didn't have any cocktails, but this doesn't seem like a place you would stop by just for a drink.  We were seated upstairs on the balcony/loft area.  The openness and huge windows makes for great ambiance, but unfortunately terrible acoustics.  It's a bit loud and not the easiest place to have a conversation with more than 4 people (we had 6 and and resorted to generally splitting into 2 or 3 different conversations)\n\nThe service was very attentive and friendly.  My water was constantly being filled and drinks were well attended.  I ordered the pork, which was recommended by the waiter.  It was very tender -- but very sadly lacked flavor.  The best part of the meal by far were the carrots.  I will give them credit for having fresh horseradish on hand -- but the horseradish wasn't strong, even after dumping it all over my food -- I still craved more flavor!\n\nIf it were a 15 dollar meal I would give them a higher rating, but for a $30 dish it was disappointing and unfortunately, not worth the money.

Last night my friend's pork dish was swimming in a bland, grey-brown sauce, and the pork cut and pork sausage themselves were completely underseasoned. My ziti with tuna and eggplant was disappointing enough that I sent it back. The ziti were swimming in orange-colored oil and there was no concept of cohesion to this dish. Even sprinkling it with lemon and some salt could have made it come together. Nope, it was ziti in vegetable oil. Really gross. The waiter was courteous and allowed me to replace it with the ricotta gnocchi. That was slightly better but beware, it's actually a plate of cheese in gnocchi shapes swimming in white sauce, like baby food. \n- PROBLEM 2: WINE CHEATERS \nZuni used to serve their wine in normal size wine glasses using the appropriate shape for the wine. Or maybe they only did so when accompanying a bottle? Last night they served us 4-ounce pours in sherry glasses for every wine style: rose, pinot noir and cabernet. It was a tiny sherry glass! Cost-wise they are cheating the customer. $12 for 4 ounces is what I'd pay at a tasting bar for 4 ounces of a fine wine, not the house cabernet at Zuni. \n\nI hope someone else takes over this gorgeous space and makes it into a real restaurant!", "author": "Heirloom Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-06-02", "description": "Mmmm...Roast Chicken. There's something so warm and comforting about roast chicken. As far as roast chicken goes, Zuni has the best by far. Their Chicken for two seems to actually be able to feed your inner soul. The whole chicken is roasted in their brick oven and served with the perfect accompaniment - warm bread salad with red mustard greens, scallions, currants, and pine nuts. I am still baffled at how the chefs are able to cook such a succulent and flavorful roast chicken. All the natural juices are contained within the chicken as it's roasted which results in the most flavorful and juicy chicken I have ever tasted. Even the white meat is juicy and flavorful. The dark meat is even better! The only thing that can make the roast chicken even better is their amazing bread salad. The bitterness from the frisee or mustard greens adds depth to the dish while the tangy vinaigrette and currants add a high acidic note to balance the entire dish. It's absolutely mind blowing! A glass of pinot noir and you'll be in heaven. \n\nThe house-cured anchovies with celery, parmesan, and ni\u00e7oise olives is a great starter to prep your palate for the rock-n-roll ride that is to come an hour later when your chicken is ready. The marinated beets and avocado salad is also exquisitely prepared and subtly refined. The lamb sausage and squid crostini, however, was not as great. The flavors were a bit muddled and too heavy IMO. The arugula wasn't strong enough to add any balance to the gaminess or brininess from the sausage and squid. \n\nI have also noticed that there seems to be mixed reviews about Zuni. I've come to realize that it really depends on the chicken that you get. Which can vary even on the same night that you're there. Case in point, we ordered 2 orders of the roast chicken as soon as we were seated for our dinner reservation. An hour later, our server shows up with only 1 order. *Gasp* Needless to say we were extremely disappointed since it was already 10pm by this time and we were all starving even after sharing 3 appetizers. Our server was sincerely apologetic about the mix up and managed to switch things around with the kitchen so that we wouldn't have to wait another hour for our other chicken. We went about devouring our first chicken hoping that it would satiate our appetites until the second one arrived. I noticed that this first chicken was not as good as what I remembered from the first time dining here. It was still juicy but not as juicy and flavorful as the first time. There also wasn't much greens that came with the bread salad which also seemed to have not been dressed with enough vinaigrette. Perhaps this one didn't get the loving care and attention it deserved and came out not so spectacular. \n\nWe mentioned the skimpiness of the bread salad to our server and he surprised us with a whole side plate of bread salad topped with greens when he came with our second chicken. This one was divine. Back to the roast chicken that I had so fondly remembered. Perhaps it was the extra care that went into this second chicken since they wanted to provide superb service. All I know is, when it's spot-on, it's spot-on. Nothing short of amazing. On a side note, our server even waived our corkage fee because of the mix up. How awesome is that!", "author": "Diana H."}

If you haven't tried it yet, try the chicken with bread salad. It really does take an hour, so order it as soon as you sit down if you're in the market for a short evening, but if you've got the time, it's sooooo worth it.\n\nEverything else on the menu is pretty damn good, too. If you're an oyster person, Zuni always has a great selection of fresh oysters. All of their ingredients are always local and incredibly fresh, and the menu changes regularly, something I always love at a restaurant with a great chef. I'd also recommend the caesar salad - big hearts of romaine, excellent croutons and great homemade dressing - and the chocolate dessert (unfortunately can't remember what it's called). \n\nThere is valet parking (but it's pretty damn expensive), and I'd recommend calling ahead and making a reservation since the space is small.", "author": "Stephanie W."}

This sums up my whole review of dinner at Zuni Cafe.\nDinner for 3 persons consisted of a dozen oysters, 2 salads, one rotisserie chicken and 4 drinks.  Final tab: $170 before tip.\nThe service and the ambiance were pleasant enough, and it makes one feel very special to pay $50 for what is basically a roasted chicken, not very far from Costco's own rotisserie.\nIt puzzles me that people are willing to pay that much for some very basic ingredients and preparation style, however the meal itself was overall satisfying.", "author": "Laura S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-05-20", "description": "INTRO:\n\nKey words: It's all they say it is. \n\nIt was my birthday and I was at the JCC listening to a reading from Ruth Reichl. One of the people in the audience asked her where she ate when she was in San Francisco. She said Zuni Cafe, and this made me realize that I had never been to Zuni. I don't know why I never went to Zuni, all I can say now is that I was missing out all those years. \n\n\nFOOD:\n\nFris\u00e9e salad with sultana raisins in anisette, Manchego, hazelnuts, and shallot vinaigrette 8.25\n\nRed wine braised oxtails and short ribs with a poached egg and chard 16.50\n\nAbove are some items that my BF and I ate during our two visits. The first time we had a duck dish with some sort of hearty grain and capers that was just completely fabulous (but it wasn't on the  menu so I can't tell you what it's called). It was a bit oily, but in this irresistable way. The meat was slivered and was a red pinkish color. It had such a range of textures and taste that in the end all blended amazingly together. God, I loved those grains whatever they were!\n\nOn our second visit we started out with a tray of oysters, two of which were the miyagi and the pacific. The pacific are by far the best oysters I've had. They are briney and have this velvet milky soft finish that I've never had before. I ordered more. \n\nThe frissee salad is fresh and light, but I wouldn't recommend it compared to some of Zuni's other dishes. \n\nThe oxtail was our entree for that visit and it was so tender! One bite was as soft as milky mash potatoes. It came out beautifully decorateed with orange flowers and the dark red wine sauce.\n\nBOOZE:\n\nThe wine here is great. When you say you like light bodied juicy wines they bring you the perfect strawberry scented pinot with a spice. Their cocktails are also great, featuring not so girly tasting drinks that might have otherwise appeared to be girly (Anytime someone mentions citrus you could be in for trouble, remember). \n\nSERVICE:\n\nExcellent. Especially on my birthday. The staff is a mix of friendly and professional. It's never hard to get a hold of them, even when you're on a time budget.", "author": "Alexandra M."}

Eating the much hyped, acclaimed, f\u00eated baked chicken was worth the wait (one hour). It did not disappoint at 11pm, otherwise the angry beast in my stomach would have stuck its head out and roared like an elephant stumping around with its trunk in the air. What was I saying? Ah yes something about being very hungry and a moment later very pleased at cutting into that golden chicken (crispy skin so good I forgot all things fat and cholesterol related) and biting into a most succulent and juicy bird. It's about $50 for the chicken. But it is a whole damn chicken and given just how good it looks and tastes it's well worth it. Also, unless you're completely famished the portion is more than enough for you and your two best friends. Seriously, the menu says \"for two\" but it should say \"for two plus a third unless that third person is really a hungry Bengal tiger.\" I hope that conveys what I saw and what I relished. I had leftovers for lunch (I made a quick sandwich - bread from Rustic Bakery, the deservedly famous chicken (remnants thereof), some lettuce and a dash of vinegar). I inhaled that Zuni chicken as if I was about to ship off for Mars and had to subsist on those meals in a bag for the next two to three years. Every bite, every act of chomping down and noshing on that sandwich was savored. This is as good as chicken gets. The food by itself would be a five but given other considerations (service, plating, wait time etc) four stars it is. There is no fault in these stars and no shame in four big ones.", "author": "Jahan T."}

This was me and Olivia's last lunch stop before she had to head back to school. \n\nWe arrived at 12:30PM, and had to wait for 20 minutes at a bar with NO SEATS, NO AC/FAN on a scorching hot day, and NO SERVICE. When they finally handed us a menu, I was appalled by the paper menu. PAPER MENUS!? The \"nice paper\" showed remnants of various water stains made by people who weren't provided with coasters.\n\nWe wanted to make efficient use of our time by ordering the roast chicken (which takes at least an hour) in advance, but after asking multiple workers, they all told us it was just too inefficient for their kitchen to take our order when we haven't been seated. UGH!\n\nAfter seating me near a fireplace, 10 minutes of waiting for someone to ask us what we'd like to drink, and another hour and ten minutes for the chicken to be served, I was set on giving them a 1 star.\n\nThe additional star is for the my favorite part of our dish:\n\n(MEH!) TUSCAN BREAD SALAD w/ roast chicken [$48]: This dish is meant to serve 2, but could probably serve 3 as well. The salad had a hint of wasabi/mustard flavor, and the soggy tuscan bread dipped in all that oil was YUM! The roast chicken...was not up to par. It was juicy, yet flavorless.

We sat in the back room against the brick wall.  \n\nI was a bit underwhelmed by the brunch menu since I wanted to share whatever I got with Hub and he doesn't eat eggs.  Yes, no eggs, ever.  Almost settled on the burger, but we decided to split the chicken for 2.  So we ordered a bottle of wine and settled in for the wait.  Hub stared with a sampling of oysters (which he liked--tried some kinds that he hadn't tried before) and the anchovy salad.  Ok, so he didn't want to share, since I don't really eat oysters or anchovies.  Hmmmm.  I ordered the house-made salami with green bean salad.  The green beans were great but nothing special; I can get cute little green beans from the farmer's market here.  I really enjoyed the salami, though.\n\nWe did have to ask the waitress about the \"Zuni pickles\", since we're both pickle buffs.  She brought us a little plate of the pickles and the onions.  I like when servers do that.  \n\nSo finally, the chicken.  I thought it was excellent.  It was moist and juicy and falling off the bone.  It was salty, but I love salty.

The wrong foods are oily, flavor is absent in unfortunate places, and the pricing is a little off, given the imperfection in the food.\n\nAnyway, I've had me the pork chop, and the burger, as well as the fries, salad of one stripe or another, and a couple of desserts.  Oh, and the anchovies.\n\nThe worst of this group is the burger.  Flavorless, wet, and altogether mediocre; forgettable.  The accompanying pickled... I dunno, radish or whatever, was sweet and a poor accompaniment to the burger (which gets the pickles as a side, not fries).  Also: the burger has this yellow-y, bland mayonnaise stuff on it which thick, fatty, and also flavorless.  If I'm going to consume fat, it better taste good or there isn't a satisfactory quid pro quo.\n\nThe best is the pork chop. Thick, moist, well flavored , and the little potatoes with a tasty garlic oil is top notch.\n\nI notice that they lean heavily on oils in the foodstuffs.  My garden salad--which one orders because one would like something light and, well, green--was absolutely sodden with olive oil.  Once I'd finished I could tilt the plate and a thick pool of the stuff gathered at the edge.  Again, olive oil need not be ladled on one's food, it's unnecessary.\n\nThe sides/appetizers were all good, although one (minor) complaint I had about the anchovies was that you're just using the same bread that's already on the table.  It'd be nice to have, say, some little toasted things for the cheese and anchovies, rather than a plate of communal bread.\n\nDesserts were boring, but good entries in the realm of predictable:  chocolate cake (Gateau Victoire, i.e., chocolate cake) is thick (as indense) but the a slight bitterness and ever so dry texture is quite tasty--the whipped cream is nice, too.\n\nA $20 corkage for wine at lunchtime is sort of a gyp.\n\nFinally, they have a note on the menu:  \"Please note that a\"4% Health Surcharge\" will be added to your bill to support San Francisco's universal health care program.\"\n\nMy advice?  Raise your prices 4% and take that junk off of there. I, as a customer, do not like to be bombarded with how the restaurant plans to nickel & dime me, whilst taking passive-aggressive shots at the social service intentions of San Francisco.  Take that off the menu, you've already got the obligatory \"18% gratuity for parties of 6 or more\" muddying the menu, why add to the unwelcoming tone with another report of a 4% surcharge? It's just annoying to the customer, IMHO.\n\nAll in all, an adequate experience.  Would I go back? Sure, on someone else's dime.  Would I ever buy a meal there myself?\n\nNo.", "author": "Martin W."}

We also tried the polenta, which was warm and filling, but didn't seem that different from other polenta's that I've sampled.  Shortly thereafter, we got the Roasted Chicken, and at first bite, it was good, it was a roast chicken, the execution of the dish was good, the chicken wasn't overcooked, and pretty moist.  \n\nThe skin had a nice flavor to it, but it was accompanied by a bread salad, which I initially thought was going to be similar to a dressing, and while the mustard greens, scallions, currants, and pine nuts offered a nice nutty aroma, tartness with the greens lightly wilted and were very good.  But the bread soaked up the oil from the chicken and rather then being roasted and caramelized by it, it was little bits of greasy and soggy bread.  The rest of the dish wasn't bad, but because it was on the 7x7 list, I guess I had my hopes up.  I think I would have been even more disappointed if I had to wait the full amount of time for it.

Two things stand out:\n\n1. I ordered a glass of wine to start, and my friend the same. The waiter said, \"Would you like to order a bottle instead?\"\n\nYes, I get the upsell, but I've never ever had this particular upsell before. If we wanted a bottle we'd've ordered a bottle, not two glasses. A full bottle is a committment for two people, not only monetarily but alcoholicly. We needed to drive afterwards, and one glass was fine, which is why we ordered one glass apiece.\n\n\"Can I get the grilled chicken breast please?\"\n\"Are you sure you don't want a WHOLE ROAST CHICKEN?\"\n\"Yes, I'm pretty damn sure I don't want a whole roast chicken: it's 4x the price, more than I can eat, and if that's what I wanted I would've ordered it.

The salmon was fine, the whole dish a bit too room temp, but the potatoes/beans were cold. I don't mean room temp cold, I mean refrigerator cold. So cold that I asked whether it was intentional. Now they weren't bad mind you, but they were at odds with the warm salmon. They were not supposed to be cold, and the waiter offered to bring a side of the same. I realized that this meant most probably that Zuni stores the pre-cut potatoes/beans in the fridge, and sautes them per order.

The host was dismissive and unfriendly.  I've been and experienced some of the most amazing restaurants from San Fran to Paris and even in these other qualifying areas the hosts are always pleasant.  I noticed the culture in here came from the top when I witnessed the manager being rude and dismissive to the guest sitting across from us.  They were celebrating a family reunion and he asked them to not take photos as they were bothering us.  Which was totally inaccurate - suddenly the folks looked at us cross eyed as if we had complained.  We clarified with them and  we carried on.  The food: chicken was not worth the 75 minute wait and I guarantee you can get a better quality and savory from Hillstone. Everything else we had was meh, by far the favorite was there fries.  Won't be coming back here again, unless these people get their perspective right and stop... Playing like they're in Beverly Hills or Manhattan.", "author": "JC K."}

Under the retrofit beams. They have such a beautiful open kitchen and in my opinion, that is the best place to dine, where the action is. The girl who showed us to our table offered to speak to the hostess and try to get us a better table, I declined...did not want to cause a problem for them as this place is extremely buisy. \n**My suggestion would be to make a special request at the time you make your reservation, to be seated in the kitchen area.**\n\nOur server was friendly and helpful, but not over-bearing.\n\nWe started with manilla clams, while waiting for our roasted chicken. The clams were delicious, dipping the rustic Acme bread into the broth, we finished off two servings off bread!\n\nThe chicken came after about 45 min. (our waiter put in our order a few minutes after we were seated while getting our drinks.) This is where my anticipated 5 stars drops to 4 stars. This skin was nice and crispy, overall the chicken was extremely salty, the breast was very dry, thigh was nice. Over cooked and too salty. The stuffing under the chicken was tasty, but we could not manage to consume more than a couple of small bites. It was soaked in chicken grease and loads of butter. Just too much. Hard to believe coming from someone like me who's favorite food is french fries!! It does not have to be greasy to taste good. \n\nFor desert we had the Gateaux Victoire (flourless chocolate cake)- this drops my rating down further. Fell apart into a crumbly mess when putting your fork into it. Lacked richness and chocolate flavour. \n\nClams, Chicken, sparkling water-NOT mineral water- they do their own in house which is simply CO2 infused into tap water, one glass of sauv. blanc and chocolate cake = $110 \n\nWe expected so much more from them, considering the prices we paid, and the hype.", "author": "Linda V."}

And we unfortunately agree that it was our worst value for money dinner in SF. Sorry to say that but nothing was good : small portion, not tasty, not well cooked, service very average ( nobody asked us if we liked our dishes , no greetings when leaving, poor wine service ) and we paid 200 dollars with no dessert and only one bottle of wine concerning the drinks.\nMay be we should have ordered the chicken. The pasta was a joke for 17 dollars ( not valued more than 5 dollars , really ) , the porchetta was just ok but it costs almost 30 dollars and the lamb was not well cooked ( one piece was rare and the over medium ). At the end of the dinner , we were still hungry but too disappointed to try a dessert.\nEither we were very unlucky or there is a change of management or chef but the dinner we had don't deserve more than one star on yelp.

My wife and I made reservations to come here on a late night to enjoy some wining and dining. As we were led through the different dining rooms up and down stairs we noticed that most patrons were knifing at the 1 hour roasted chicken. I'll admit it looked awesome and big enough for two but we had already decided that we will not give into this foolishness because ordering chicken at a famous spot is not the most adventurous approach rather it is a more cost effective and safe approach.\n\nFor wine we brought our own bottle of Vincent Arroyo Petite Sirah and paid a $20 corkage fee.\n\nWe started with a wild arugula salad and it was a perfect balance of oil, vinegar, and cheese. The arugula is so fresh they must be growing it on the rooftop.\n\nAppetizer numero dos was a show stopper and was recommended by our awesome very attentive waiter. The clams with squid covered in ancho chile sauce was 10 stars. These teeny tiny claims were creamy tender and the squid had a little crunch. The bar has been raised for squid texture for sure. I don't know if I will ever want to order squid anywhere else.\n\nMain Course for Moi was the beef tenderloin rubbed in pepper with a side of spinach and sweet potatoes. Everything was perfect the meat was so soft I could cut it with my fork. The greens were charred crispy, a new technique to me, and they were awesome. Well done on an extraordinary way to enjoy spinach greens. The potatoes were sweet little roasted cubes of goodness.\n\nMain Course for Le Madame was duck leg with fennel sausage. The duck was juicy soft with a delicate duck flavor. In contrast the sausage had powerful fennel freshness to it. The manager noted the sausage arriving a little late so we ended up getting a free desert. What a fresh breath of exceptional service.\n\nFor desert we had buckwheat crepes with orange and vanilla ice cream. We didn't exactly fall in love with wheat crepes because we are so used to white flour crepes but seriously once it was smothered in melting ice cream with sweet orange sauce and little pieces of orange on top, Who Cares!\n\nWe had a 10 star night at Zuni for $120 and we look forward to doing it again.

I also looked on their website to see if I could email someone at the restaurant and (privately) let them know about my sub-par night, but there is no way to contact them other than the main reservation line, which I'd rather not deal with. So, unfortunately, I'm voicing my disappointment on yelp.\n\nSummary: Made reservations for dinner Zuni Cafe. Party of 5, Friday night, 9:00 pm. A friend was in town from the East Coast and wanted Zuni for her one night in town. We arrived at 8:55 and were told that our table was still being readied. Ok, fine -- no problem. 15 minutes later I went back to the host's podium and was told \"the party who is sitting at your table has paid and it *looks* like they're getting their coats.\" Wait, what? I thought the table was getting \"readied\"? 15 minutes after that we were finally sat -- except that no one acknowledged our THIRTY MINUTE wait. I realize that Friday nights are busy, that we were 5 -- not two, or 4 -- but the fact that neither of the hostesses or our server (who perhaps didn't know?) acknowledged OR apologized for us waiting 30 minutes after our reservation really got the meal off to a bad start. It continued from there -- normally the service I've had at Cafe Zuni is impeccable, but our server was incredibly awkward and erratic. I didn't expect anyone to fall all over themselves about the wait -- but what's the point of making reservations if we have to wait a half an hour afterwards? Following the lack of acknowledgement (I seriously would have been ok with someone -- anyone -- saying \"sorry for the wait\" and could have let it go at that) for our 30 min wait, the weird/uncomfortable service made the experience laughable.  It would have been different if our reservations had been during a peak time -- but by 9:00 the restaurant was slowing down and by the time we sat it was nearly empty in our section. My friends at least liked their chicken. And while we're on the subject of the chicken,  I really wish Zuni would round out their menu with a vegetarian entree. I get that their specialty isn't vegetarian fare, and I'm normally ok with slapping some sides together for myself while my friends go to town on the famous chicken -- but the ungracious evening made me more inclined to go somewhere else when a friend who's craving good food comes to town.", "author": "M M."}

If you know your going to order it, tell them you'd like for it to get started while you look over the menu. (That way it doesn't seem as long of a wait and you can order some appetizers that will hold you over until the chicken is done). Chicken was extremely moist and tender (even for white meat) and the Bread salad was better than what I had expected. It's basically bread broken up with a light balsamic vinaigrette mixed into the bread with pine nuts, currant and scallions. The red mustard greens was pretty spicy, but very good.

It was okay, but I really don't like pork chops so I'm certainly not the one to judge.\nWe enjoyed loads of yummy hors d'ouevres while our chicken roasted.  We started with the burrata, then moved to clams with delicious charred peppers and then on to a delicious chitarra with corn, chilis and pancetta.  All were delicious.\nZuni is an institution for a reason.", "author": "Amber H."}

Since I didn't  make it the first time I came here last week with Jenn C. and had a stellar meal. For those who know me, I don't like chicken. Well I'd prefer any other meat before I'd choose chicken off a menu. Jenn insisted we that we had the roast chicken and I had very high expectations of this magical dish. \n\nAs soon as our waitress (Karina?) heard we wanted chicken she promptly put the order in as it takes an hour to prepare. We started off with a dozen of the most perfectly shucked, clean, fresh oysters of the waitress' choice. The favorites that stood out were the Marin Miyagi,  Kusshi, & Pearl Point (Though I believe that West Coast oysters are far superior than their East Coast cousins..) Nicely chilled, these oysters tasted as if they just fished from the ocean!\n\nWe also ordered the house cured anchovies and the infamous caesar salad. The romaine had a surprising sweetness that paired well with the not too creamy nor salty dressing. \n\nOut came the chicken, skin glistening and all - I was totally WOWed. Crisp skin, moist tender skin atop a bed of bread salad tossed in a vinaigrette with the perfect amount of acid that didn't compete with the delicate flavor of the chicken. The serving was so huge for two that after having a few pieces, we felt a bit wimpy leaving a ton of delicious bird on the plate. \n\nThe appeal of this place is the selection of simple, non-fussy dishes made with the freshest ingredients available. Pair this with a fantastic waitress who was friendly and helpful in providing us tasty suggestions. The venue is casual and fun suitable for many occasions.

I think we both passed out that night with chicken grease all over our faces.  I'll spare you the graphic details but it was the most delicious roast chicken either of us had ever made.  With all that said, when I first went to Zuni with my lovely girlfriend I couldn't help but walk in with some high expectations.\n\nWe got some staple lunch items, the Caesar and Zuni burger, and some extras like raw oysters and a bloody mary.  O' man, you can see chef Rogers' love affair with A+ ingredients in each of the menu items.  The Caesar was crunchy with the perfect balance of anchovy-dressing and yumtastic croutons.  The burger sat on a focaccia bun with a harmonious arrangement of pickled accompaniments.  The oyster selection was wonderfully varied, a perfect precursor for me getting all antsy in my pantsy (you know what I mean), and fries were hot and crunchy.  If I could get those fries at 2am after coming back from the bars, I'd easily be a good 10+ lbs heavier this holiday season.  Make that 20+ heavier if I could get their bloody marys just as often along with the fries.  \n\nIt's good.  The service staff is knowledgeable and on their game.  The prices  are probably the only downside, but if you read Judy Rogers' tome on cooking, you see where all the extra money goes -- into the ingredients, and it shows.", "author": "M K."}

My friend and I didn't make reservations, but they have a pretty big bar area, that has normal tables, so if you are lucky you can snatch one of those without having to plan ahead or wait for hours. I actually prefer that area, because they have really big windows and it also provides a nice view of the restaurant. \n\nThe negatives - small, but worth mentioning. For a place as fancy as this, I would have expected better bread and butter. Sure its free, so I can't complain that much, but it would not be difficult to provide less crusty bread and to warm up the butter. Additionally, there is only one bathroom stall per sex.. for a place as big as this, thats weird. I had to wait a good 10ish minutes.

Everyone has different expectations on the taste of food.\nThis review is not about the food, but about the service received.\nI made a reservation for this evening. I then called a few hours ahead to preorder the chicken because it usually takes an hour. A gentleman answered the phone and promptly told me they don't take preorders for the chicken. I informed him that just a few months ago, I was able to do so. He then told me they no longer do so. I then asked him when did this start. His only answer was ever since he started.\nOK, so far, bad news, but nothing terrible.\nWhat was shocking was that this guy did not offer any explanations or alternatives. What does that mean, \"Ever since I started here\". Who knows when he started. It could have been yesterday or 10 years ago. His explanation gave me the feeling that he could have made that up while on the phone with me. It wasn't like, \"I'm sorry, but our management has made this decision\". His answer was so short and very unprofessional. For a place that charges $31-50 for a plate, I expect more professionalism from the staff.\nObviously, Zuni has made a decision to not accept preorders for the chicken. So for those of you planning to go and enjoy the infamous chicken, you must now order when you arrive and must wait at least an hour.\nI also agree with many reviewers that Zuni's quality has gone down.

How apropos ... as it is my favorite destination in town for casual fine dining.  And always the first to come to mind people ask which restaurant I think best represents SF.\n\nI've been here several times over the years and have never been disappointed.  In short, I would say the roasted chicken for two is one of the best dishes I've ever had (so succulent, especially with the bread salad that soaks up the juices but somehow also retains a crunchiness).\n\nOther stand-out dishes (which may or may not be around the next time I'm there):\n- The ricotta gnocchi: literally melts in your mouth \n- The risotto - good size app with tons of flavor\n- The Alaskan halibut - amazingly flaky and tender\n- The burger (for lunch) - on focaccia bread with pickled onions - one of the best in the city\n\nI also love their Bloody Mary (with their small bits of jalapeno peppers and onions) that fit through your straw so you get a nice crunchy contrast to the spicy drink (I only wish they would upgrade their Vodka from Smirnoff).\n\nZuni is one of those places where somehow it has managed to strike a perfect balance of comfort and creative foods, casual but upscale feel,  and refined service that does not feel at all stuffy. It's obvious they've succeeded in maintain this careful equilibrium just by looking around at the diverse patrons (a group of  boisterous 20-somethings celebrating a birthday, a culinary destination for out-of-town guests, a couple on a romantic intimate date, a pair of foodie friends out for a late-night bite, older companions having a quiet, intimate meal).\n\nIt's no wonder it's been at the top of its game for over 30 years.

There's valet parking but there was actually a ton of free parking around the area, so that's a plus. \n\nZuni Cafe is small but there's seating all over the restaurant: outside, near the bar, in a separate dining room near the ovens, and even an upstairs deck. There are large glass windows everywhere and a fully stocked bar, so you can see the alcohol bottles lined up from outside as you pass by the cafe. \n\nThe service was good: our waitress was very attentive and friendly. There were also busboys who came by and cleaned our tables after we finished our entrees. \n\nFOOD \nZuni's oven roasted chicken with Tuscan bread salad is featured on the 7x7 Big Eat Scavenger Hunt, so that's exactly what we ordered. \n\nThe menu says that it's \"chicken for two,\" but unless you can eat a whole chicken, expect to bring home a heavy box of leftovers. There were 3 of us and we ordered 2 plates of the roasted chicken and an order of shoestring fries. We went home with two boxes of chicken and salad. \n\nThe shoestring fries were very skinny and crispy. I enjoyed them because the ketchup was unique; it was sweeter and had a thicker consistency than traditional ketchup. The portions were big but since they're so skinny it doesn't feel like you're eating that much. \n\nWe waited an hour for the coveted chicken but unfortunately it was just roasted chicken-- nothing too special. I must admit that it's the BEST roasted chicken I've ever had (very juicy and tender), but it's not worth $48 and the hour-long wait. My brother compared it to Costco's rotisserie chicken. \n\nWhat made the dish stand out was the Tuscan bread salad. It came with pine nuts, corn, and what looked like dried fruit. The dressing was divine and the bread was spongy and flavorful. It got a little soggy towards the end of the meal but overall it was a good complement to the chicken. \n\nOverall, the chicken is tasty but overpriced.

This previous weekend I asked friends to meet there Saturday morning for their famous bloody marys to ward off what i knew would be post-wedding hangovers.  The bloody marys did not disappoint, but the food certainly did.\n\nMy dining partner had the burger on foccacia, which looked delectable  but was unfortunately characterized as the oiliest burger ever known to man.  The veggies that came with the burger looked and tasted beautiful, but I think the slightly oily nature of foccacia coupled with the fact that it was unnecessarily buttered was just a problem.  Another companion ordered the penne with tuna confit.  I had informed him that to \"confit\" anything means to cure or preserve it in some form of fat, (in this case ahi tuna in olive oil) but for some reason the waiter was able to convince him the dish would not be as overly fatty as, say, a duck confit.  He was wrong.  That dish was a reservoir of olive oil.  It was not even nice to look at.\n\nThe only foods that did not disappoint were the stellar bay oysters...out of this world.  The best oysters I have possibly ever had.  Medium in size and creaminess, they were a huge hit.  And of course, the pomme frites.

However, I don't want to discount the fact that I've been to Zuni a few times and really loved it, so here's my rating:\n\nRestaurant - 4 stars (service, food, ambiance is very good.  Nathan is a wonderful and attentive server so you should ask for him if he's there!)\n\nBurger - 3 stars\n\nThis burger came out on a square focaccia roll and the first thing I really noticed was the lack of much on the burger itself.  I ordered it with grilled onions so that was on the burger and it also came with an aioli which was quite tasty as well as greens and on the side, pickled onions and pickles.\n\nThe meat itself was good, not great.  And compared to #10 (Namu), it didn't stand a chance.  But don't let that stop you from ordering it because it IS a good burger.  One positive against Namu's burger was the fact that the bun itself held up better than the Namu bun (although my cohorts were complaining about the squareness of it). The pickles and the pickled onions really helped flavor up the burger so I really enjoyed those.  I found the \"greens\" to be a bit wilted...which maybe is how they're supposed to come, but I prefer mine to be fresh.  It's a decent sized burger but not too much.  If you're hungry, you'll be able to finish it all.\n\nWe shared an order of fries (it's really quite big so even if you're 3-4 people, you could share one order) that were very skinny fries.  Not my favorite only because I prefer my fries to still have some bit of potato in them (these were too crispy for my tasty).\n\nOverall I would rate Namu's burger over Zuni's....however, I'd definitely choose Zuni over Namu to eat.  Just be sure to get a reservation if you're going there for dinner or expect a wait.  I was shocked that on a Saturday afternoon, there was still quite a crowd!", "author": "Melanie N."}

My co-worker and I both went for the burger since we didn't have the time to wait for the chicken. We both loved our burgers (mine with cheese and hers with the portobello mushroom.) Of course you can't have any kind of burger (fancy or fast) without a coke so we ordered a coke each and a couple of refills later..we got our bill charging $3+ per glass of coke!!!! Ahhh!

Every single burger that was ordered at our table was a bloody medium. What pissed me off about this is we had a very long conversation with our waitress that even though the chef prefers to cook his burgers medium, we wanted them \"well done\" anyways. When we got the burgers and saw that they still were not cooked according to order I again stated that we had been very adamant that we didn't want medium burgers. She said she could take them back and have them cooked longer, but my question is why? Why the hell do I have to send all the burgers back a second time?. As for the Beecher's Flagship cheese on the burger, it was completely tasteless. Another annoying thing they only give you ketsup in a small metal serving cup, and you can only dip one tiny shoesting french fry in it at a time. They give you so little ketsup, you'd need 8-9 cups to make it through an order of fries. Before we ever went there, I asked the people that had invitied us if they truly served a $15.00 dollar burger and was told absolutely YES! Well after adding the tasteless cheese and inch thick cut under grilled onions, and the fries it was well over $20.00 per person. Truth of the matter, I wouldn't pay two cents for what I was served. Nothing pisses me off more than a restaurant that plays these stupid games. I don't care if you think you have the greatest burger in the world, and that it shouldn't be cooked \"well done\", Damn it! I'm a paying customer! Christ I can go to Burger King and get it my way, why can't you follow a simple customer request? There's nothing worse when a restaurant has a pretentious chef in the kitchen. The next thing you know, they'll come out of the kitchen to tell you how you should eat what they cooked. This place is pathetic. I would never recommend it to anyone and will never return.

This is a very special place where drinks and food are crafted with care. We got there early to pre-prder the roast chicken (takes an hr and you can't do it over phone).

Zuni has its own chardonnay. 15 mins after our reservation time, they took us upstairs to a nice corner table and we had appetizers (marinated olives and fried onions and broccoli).

This was my first visit to Zuni and I was very impressed. The food was exceptionally fresh, seasonal and so delectable. The restaurant itself is divided into several cool areas -- there's the main dining, the upstairs dining and the bar area. All very cool! Next time I'd love to sit in the main dining as you can see the chefs creating in the kitchen from that vantage point.  I dined here on a Tuesday evening, the restaurant was packed! I will definitely be back.\n\nFood:\nPolenta: We ordered this for our appetizer and it was simply amazing... or simple AND amazing... either way it was delish! We had both the mascarpone and Parmesan cheese on top, which made it so incredible. Maybe not the lightest app, but so worth it!\n\nCaesar Salad: Very good. Crisp, fresh romaine with just the right amount of dressing served with homemade croutons (which were amazing!).\n\nFilet: Compared to everything else this was a petite portion, which by this point I was quite pleased with! The filet was served sliced, and perfectly cooked. Along side the steak was fresh baby artichokes with morels. Surprisingly the dish was really light and amazing.\n\nRicotta Fritters: When my dinner date ordered this, I was thinking, \"what the heck are you ordering?!\" Boy was I so happy he did! these were light pillows of ricotta battered and deep fried. They were so light and airy, but the best part was the Meyer lemon topping. Wow! This was amazing. Order these!!\n\nBread: \nSimple crusty bread. Simply good.

It came highly recommended and we wanted to knock off another item from the 7x7 list.  \n\nSo was it worth a spot on the list?  Definitely.  The first bite of that roasted chicken was fabulous.  The chicken was perfectly moist and tender.  The seasoning was delicious.  The bread salad was also absolutely fantastic.  As we dug in more, the chicken started to get pretty dry.  This is something you can easily remedy by eating it with the bread salad.  Mmm legit.  As amazing as the chicken was, however, I do not believe that it was worth the $50 we paid for it.  It was very good, but there was nothing that set it apart to make that good.  \n\nIf you are coming for the roasted chicken, be careful about coming on an empty stomach.  You have to wait about an hour to get your chicken. Our table faced the kitchen.  While it was fun watching them cook and prepare the food, it certainly made us hungrier.  Granted, there are a lot of other great offerings on the menu to hold you over while you're waiting, but we were certainly eying those pizzas and hamburgers.  \n\nWe tried the Zuni Ceasar Salad while we waited.  The cheese was delicious as were the croutons.  The salad itself was good, too, but those croutons man.  It's pretty big.  We split it and it was the perfect amount.  \n\nThe d\u00e9cor was great!

As more older wealthy Caucasians were being seated though, I started to feel the societal stares (\"who let them in here?\").\nThe waiter was great at describing the dishes and answering questions, but he seemed a little condescending, especially when he corrected the way we ordered food and drinks. But I accepted it, and it made for a funny conversation amongst us.\n\n- Ricotta gnocchi (literally just ricotta balls posing as gnocchi), was merely decent.\n- $48 chicken and bread salad - the bread salad was yummy, but the CHICKEN WAS EXTREMELY UNDERWHELMING. I totally agree with another reviewer that Costco rotisserie chicken tastes pretty much the same. Yes it was tender and somewhat juicy, but it was lacking flavor and anything extraordinary. Some pieces also had quite a bit of redness still. I cannot believe so many people have hyped this gimmick.\n- Duck confit with breadcrumb stuffing was good, but not nearly the best I've had. The leg was really moist, but they didn't render the skin enough and the meat tasted exactly like chicken, no game flavor at all. The stuffing was like a knockoff of Thanksgiving, but in the worst way possible.\n- Pork chop was eaten entirely by my friend, but he left the grainy polenta cake alone\n- Gateau victoire and Espresso granita desserts were once again UNDERWHELMING AND PRICEY. The chocolate cake was pretty dry and lacked sweetness. The granita barely satisfied my sweet tooth, but the table didn't even finish them because they weren't true \"desserts\"\n\nMaybe Zuni is all about bringing the natural flavors and elements out of their ingredients? After the dinner, that translated to me as bland, unimaginative cooking costing way too much.\n\nThere are so many better places to eat in the city, don't waste your time or money here.\n\n** The next day - my friend tells me they had food poisoning, almost positive that it was the undercooked pieces of chicken **", "author": "Jeffrey Y."}

My teenage son, who is a gnocchi fiend, wasn't so crazy about his ricotta gnocchi...I confirmed his opinion that they were kinda mushy. Our Parmasan cheese plate and Meyer lemon tart were inhaled in seconds in a family-wide feeding frenzy. \n\nService was good...nothing to complain about, but not over the top either. The atmosphere is great...love the open kitchen. \n\nWe'll go back...at lunch or after 10 pm to try out this burger (supposedly rated by some important culinary person or publication as one of the top 30 dishes to travel for). I'll let you know if it lives up to that lofty reputation...", "author": "Janet D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-09-30", "description": "Reasons why I DON'T consider this place worthwhile at this time:\n- $48 for a roasted chicken, PLUS taxes.\n- Waiting more than an hour for a just average meal.\n- Charging 4% for the Healthy San Francisco program.\n\nI do appreciate that all this information is provided on the menu when ordering, so nothing is hidden, no surprises. So I accept that we chose to go ahead and spend this money, and wait for the chicken.\n\nI know that friends from SoCal that get to enjoy really good Peruvian roasted chicken are gonna be laughing at me for paying that much.\n\nWell, my brother paid for the meal so I shouldn't be fuming about the price, other than it wasn't worth it. The dark meat was fine, the white meat was a bit dry. The table next to us said they didn't have that problem, so I guess we got the odd one (or maybe they were lying to me, who knows). I can make better roasted chicken at home. Any good crispy skin chicken at a Chinese restaurant is way better and cheaper. And I even consider the Costco roasted chicken to be better.\n\nFriends that like this place say that the burger is great, and a few told me that I would have had a better meal if we ordered other menu items instead. I respect their opinions, so if I ever decide to come back and experience a better meal, I'll revise this review.\n\nMy other issue is the \"Health Surcharge\". I'm aware of the HSF program and support providing health benefits to all employees (should be operating costs, instead of passing costs onto customers). But the amount charged is higher than other places. Somehow Delfina manages to do fine by charging $1.25, and Zazie in Cole Valley charges $1. Those are fine dining restaurants. What's so different about Zuni's health plan, that they need to charge so much more? What, not enough profit with the $48 chicken? For me it doesn't seem right to charge more than what they need from customers, under the ruse of providing benefits for employees. The ironic part is that the SF Restaurant Association is suing the city to eliminate the HSF program requirement. Restaurants say they support benefits for employees, while at the same time try to eliminate the program, that's funny. In the meantime they just want someone else to pay for the cost.

Then order an appetizer and a drink (I recommend the balsamic bloody mary) and sit back and relax, cuz I haven't even told you about the best part, yet. The bread salad. Big chunks of toasted, butter coated sourdough bread, tossed with herbs and greens and toasted pine nuts.

Zuni is usually so overbooked that we had to find out what all the hype was about. \n\nOkay, the real reason is this: after Yelp did that piece on Michael Mina's all-time favorite eats in SF- Zuni's \"Chicken for Two\" being one of them, I just had to go! Can't be helped- I'm easily influenced. The yelp gods tell me where I should eat, and I go (armed with a reservation, of course).\n\nAlright kids, Zuni IS as fantastic as they say. Their bartenders (even though I only had an orange juice) are as talented as others have raved about in the past. So why only four stars, Elaine (queen of the five star rating, which I tend to distribute out like candy on Halloween)? Oh, I'll tell you why:\n\n$48 CHICKEN.\n\nStar docked. I'm probably going to get a lot of flack for saying this, but I hope everyone is aware that you can get an entire rotisserie chicken at Costco for $4.99. Mmm Hmm, and it's pretty darn good too. \n\nAND, on top of the price, their damn chicken is soooo special that it requires an hour to prepare, and is ONLY prepared fresh to order. To be fair, the waitstaff and kitchen are trained to carefully space out any starters or small plates ordered so that the hour it takes to prepare this precious poultry doesn't seem so excruciatingly long. We ordered some salads or whatever, I don't remember. What I DO remember is that we each timed the chicken, giving them a very generous 5 minute grace period, in case they were late. They came in at 63 minutes from the time we ordered it. Not bad.\n\nKeep in mind, you might be able to scoop up a late-night reservation to Zuni on OpenTable. And if you can, you probably should. Even a 9PM or 10PM reservation isn't so bad! They close at midnight on Fri/Sat, so you'd still have time to order the magical \"chicken for two\" dish that has made Zuni (in)famous.\n\nThe chicken dish WAS very good- over-priced!- but delicious. It was the most juicy and tender I have ever eaten (but it's still just chicken). Also, we were stationed by the window- nice view, but the seating was wack. The table was at an incline, which can be reeeally annoying if you have OCD like I do. Request a table upstairs, if possible.", "author": "Elaine T."}

Now that my visits to San Francisco restaurant establishments are well into the hundreds (if not two or three hundreds - jeez San Francisco, why do your restaurants have to be so good?) - I can't believe it took me so long to go.\n\nSo I finally find an excuse to go (not like I ever really need an excuse) - to see a friend for our last San Francisco brunch before she moved.  So I make my reservation way in advance (as I've been tipped to do many moons ago) and on the day of - I find myself running way behind thanks to having to scurry through 3 forms of transportation (thanks Muni).  I tell my friend to go ahead and tell the hostess that I was running late and was expecting disgruntled waitstaff when I got there.  To my surprise - I was completely wrong!  They were way cool about me being late and even sympathized with my Muni failure moment.  They seated us quickly and with a smile.  \n\nAs soon as we sat - I awed at the high ceilings, floor to ceiling windows, and large/open space where they don't cram their patrons like sardines.  This restaurant oozes of well-established San Francisco restaurant ambiance.  \n\nAs for food - we had the salmon, the burger, and the honey ice cream.

The bf & I gave into the hype & our curiosity led us to Zuni this past Thursday for dinner. \n\nWe arrive 20 minutes after our reservation time (oops) due to traffic & circling the block for parking. When we arrived, the hostess led us to an upstairs table with fantastic views of Market street. The soothing melody of a piano plays in the background of all the laughter & conversation. The decor was simple & almost rustic: exposed bricks & beams, minimal wall decorations. Right away, we placed our \"chicken for two\" order.\n\nIn the hour it took for our chicken to arrive, the bf & I enjoyed:\n- an appetizer of Serrano ham, peppers & walnuts, a limonata (san pellegrino, cute bottle, tastes like a million bucks) & a mountain of shoestring fries, which were salty & crispy & \"what fries should taste like,\" as my bf observed.\n\nFinally, the piece de resistance arrives in an unceremonious, anti-climatic way. This is the chicken we've been waiting an hour for? This is the chicken, with a few sprigs of greens sticking out the bottom, that's breaking our bank? After our initial few bites, the bf & I look at one another, almost embarrassed that we'd been duped. It's freakin chicken- moist, salted, yummy chicken with light crispy skin and a bread salad that was a perfect compliment. It was delicious chicken, but not \"$48 chicken.\" This isnt the end all, be all chicken that some reviewers paint it to be. This chicken isnt going to change your life or your perception about chicken. I just can't say it was worth the price.\n\nThe food at Zuni is certainly top notch & the bustling atmosphere is a joy to be a part of, which means I will be returning, but just not for $48 chicken. How would I ever face my Filipino family ever again, who buys chicken from Safeway & Costco for a fraction of what Zuni charges?

I don't know when I've ever enjoyed chicken as much in my entire life.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  It comes with this totally awesome bread salad too (think best stuffing ever!)  The bread totally soaks up the juices of the bird and has this great, almost subtle, dare I say slight vinegary quality to it?\n\nHere's my tip:  The chicken takes an hour to cook, so make sure to order it right away when you sit down.  One of the guys in our group actually told the hostess that we were ordering the chicken and the order was placed as soon as we sat down.  \n\nWe also ordered some clams (decent) and other appetizers, which I remember as being good, but the chicken was so incredibly good, it erased all the other dishes from my memory.\n\nThey also have some decent cocktails.  The bloody mary is really unique and tastes a lot fresher than your standard bloddy mary.  It definitely has a strong, rich tomato flavor.

We arrived on time and were going to be seated immediately, but I didn't realize they have a lot of upstairs seating and due to some temporary medical issues, I can't go upstairs. They were very accommodating but we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table downstairs. There is a nice bar area, but no stools. Luckily they had some chairs by the piano so I was able to sit down.\n\nWe were able to get our order in for the chicken as soon as we sat down and then our waiter returned for our drinks and apps order. my husband started with the caesar salad which looked good - not too much dressing, and I decided on the rabbit sausage. I was expecting something heavy, but it was a smaller sausage with really delicate flavor, very delicious. My husband also ordered oysters which he enjoyed. The half bottle of wine was not his favorite though.\n\nThey kept our sparkling water refilled and the bread they serve is very good. It is quite a wait for the chicken, even when having appetizers, but it turned out to be okay. We also ordered the matchstick fries which were delicious. It looks like a massive amount of chicken when it arrives, but we were able to finish just about all the chicken (we didn't eat all the greens or bread salad though). Overall, we enjoyed the chicken and it was perfectly cooked, but it wasn't necessarily something I'd go raving about. Maybe it's just chicken that's not that exciting to me. We thought it was good, but not necessarily something that either of us would be running back for. If chicken is your thing though, definitely check it out. The other food we had was good as well, and service was also solid so I'd definitely recommend the place.", "author": "Lauren M."}

Not sure of what to order other than the famous chicken and bread salad, we decided on fried flounder for an appetizer, shoestring fries, bread and chicken salad and the baked halibut. Over ambitious? Yes. We ordered way too much food. The chicken and bread salad could EASILY feed 3 people (opposed to the 2 that the menu suggests). I mean WOW, we did not know what we were getting ourselves into.\n\nTo start, we had the fried flounder which was very good. The fish tasted fresh and it wasn't overly greasy. The shoestring fries were actually served almost as an appetizer, which we thought would just come with our entrees, but since the chicken and bread salad takes an hour to cook, they brought them out early. The fries were good, I think I just prefer a little more substantial fry as opposed to super thin straws. But nonetheless they were good.\n\nWhile we waited we enjoyed a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc that was delicious and refreshing. After salivating over other table's chicken and bread salads, ours finally arrived. Let me tell you, it is most definitely worth the wait. The roasted chicken is OUT of this world. I think roasted chicken might be on my top five favorite foods list. The chicken is so moist and juicy and the french bread is drenched in the roasting liquids that contains quite a bit of vinegar which is what made me fall so deeply in love with it. The flavors were just incredible. The halibut was very good, but it definitely didn't hold a candle to the chicken and bread which was hands down the star of the meal.\n\nTo finish we chose something on the lighter side, I believe it was the honey ice cream with a crunchy natural brittle. It was a very good and very light ending to this fabulous meal.", "author": "Emily S."}

I had the feeling I would smell like that all night. But the waiter notice himself without us having to say a word and I think he kinda did something because after that you couldn't smell it anymore. \n\nWe order a bottle of champagne which was great, and my glass was never empty. \nI had the prosciutto crostini and the risotto with mushroom and pecorino.\nMy friend and her sister had both one of their salads, now I am forgetting which one, and my friend got  mussles, while her sister ordered oysters. \n\nwe didn't have time for dessert because the ballet was about to start, but their capuccino granita with creamed sounded really interesting. \n\nIf I had a special occasion or wanted to impress someone, I would go back there.

He brought over no fewer than 3 different tastes of wine before we settled on a bottle. He was very patient with our indecision. The chicken lived up to it's billing and more. We did remember to order it the moment we sat down, and the wine and appetizers did a great job of tiding us over until the chicken arrived. It didn't feel anything like a full hour. (I don't know how long it actually took) The chicken was very moist with crispy, but not too crispy skin. Lightly seasoned, you actually taste the chicken - not just a ton of seasoning on chicken.

These folks are clearly well trained, and the communication between the waitress, servers, and kitchen is streamlined to the point where you wonder how they do it. No detail was neglected throughout our entire time at Zuni. We started with a pre-dinner cocktail at the bar, then moved to our table. Our waitress helped us choose a bottle of wine in our price range, even suggesting one a bit cheaper. When my partner's oysters came she knew the names of each one by its shell shape and told us shes an oyster fanatic when I asked how she could possibly remember all those fancy names. Our mascarpone salad was divine. My partner loved his rabbit dish. I loved my gnocchi - they were lighter than most gnocchi I've had, almost reminiscent of an Asian style dumpling. Now the standout dish, surprisingly, was the periwinkle clams which were accompanied by tiny tomatoes and tiny peppers - forget the names. How funny that the tomatoes and peppers were the stars of this entire show - they were seriously bursting with flavor, and the peppers were lightly grilled. The sauce was a bit tangy and spicy. Yum.

Both dishes  were with average quality.  The sea bass was a little overcooked, leaving the fish a bit dry and tight in texture.  Flavor was subtle; you could call it a light dish but you could also call it a non-impressive dish without any distinctive characteristic.\n\nThe quail was good, with flavorful sauteed veggie at the side.  The quail was done just right, with the meat was still tender and juicy.

It was also my first time at Zuni Cafe. I'd been looking forward to checking it out so was glad for the opportunity.\n\nZuni is located in the corner space of a building on Market St and the acute angle leads to some interesting architectural elements. I liked the long bar along the Market St window because the light filters in through the array of bottles on the backbar. I also didn't realize they had 2 levels there.\n\nWe got seated next to the fireplace and proceeded to order. The options for the burger are not extensive, but we split them again: I chose a Roth K\u00e4se cheese, Gene got a blue cheese, and Melanie opted for the grilled onions on her burger. We also got a plate of fries to share.\n\nThe food arrived fairly quickly. The only thing on the side was the pickled stuff: red onion slices and thin strips of cucumber. The pickling was pretty interesting, judging by a piece of cinnamon stick that was on Melanie's plate, and tasted very good, so I put both cukes and onions on my burger and took a bite. First thing I noticed was that my burger was overcooked. I ordered it medium rare and it came out as medium or even more than that, since there was barely any pink inside. Still, it was juicy and tasty. The other thing that disappointed me was the bun. Zuni uses a square focaccia-like bun and for me this simply does not work with a round burger. The geometry is wrong: you start eating just bread and end with the same. It also didn't exactly hold up to the burger juices and started to come apart. The pickled stuff was good though and helped cut through the richness of the meat. The fries were shoestring-style and, while tasty, too thin for my liking.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty decent burger, but right now it's in the second place after Namu's. Looking forward to trying the other 8 and making my own ranking. I also hope to visit Zuni again and try its famous roasted chicken.", "author": "Andrei Z."}

I always thought the food was overrated, decent but not good enough for what it costs. When you're married sometimes it's best to just go where you're told. I do remember that they had THE BEST bloody marys. \n\nMy life has changed quite a bit, I moved out of town with a wife and moved back without one. I live in the Mission and I don't really care for fancy food. I only came back to Zuni for two reasons, bloody marys and a cheeseburger. \n\nI don't do a lot of daytime drinking anymore and had kind of forgotten about bloody marys but lately The Delicate Viking \nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Sw4e9geYXjwG8-JgsuZTSw has got me obsessed with them. \n\nI could have gone back to Zeitgeist if I felt like being verbally abused by the staff and choked with second hand Parliament smoke but I didn't and I remembered how awesome the bloodys were at Zuni back in the day. I can report that the Zuni bloody marys are not good any more. For some reason they pour in vinegar. Sure it's very fancy vinegar but it still makes the whole drink taste like salad dressing. At $9.50 each they weren't worth the money. They weren't very strong either, I had three in an hour and barely felt it. \n\nZuni, please go back to the way you made them 15 years ago \n\nI've had a lively debate with another of my yelp friends http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=i9kZ0lDHXNyoPLH67hJ2bg over who makes the best burger in town. I say it's The Rotunda and Ace say's it's Zuni, since I hadn't had a Zuni burger I figured in all fairness I should give it a try before I judge conclusively. \n\nZuni's burger is $15; if you want cheese it's another $1.75 and if you want grilled onions it's another $1.25. My burger was $18 before tax and tip and it didn't come with anything else. I ordered it Medium rare and it came very rare, in fact the middle was raw. It was a tasty burger but it was small and nowhere near good enough to justify that price even if it were cooked properly. The Burger at Rotunda is definitely better. \n\nIf someone else is paying I'll go back for oysters and something other than a bloody mary but otherwise I would never choose to come back here.", "author": "Manny F."}

It's melt-in-your-mouth juicy, brined in salt for 24 hours but not salty, and the bread salad is where the wow factor comes in. The best stuffing ever - vinegar-y, crunchy, moist, sprinkled with pine nuts and currants.

So when my hubby surprised me with dinner at Zuni Caf\u00e9 and tickets to Wicked, I made sure to have their roasted chicken this time. We had a tight schedule (5:30pm reservations and 7:30pm show time) but thanks to their efficient staff, we were able to enjoy our meal (including dessert!) without feeling too rushed or stressed about time. Since they don't take orders for the chicken in advance, we asked the host to place our order as soon as we were seated.  \n\nKusshi Oysters from British Columbia - What an impressive oyster selection! They had an extensive list of oysters, including kumamotos (my favorite) from 3 different regions. Our waiter suggested that I try the kusshi oysters since they are similar to the kumamotos but slightly larger and creamier...I fell in love! The kusshis were sweet and refreshing with a luscious creaminess.\n\nHouse-cured Anchovies with Celery, Parmesan, and Ni\u00e7oise Olives - simple, yet sublime. A perfectly balanced dish with really high quality ingredients. The anchovies were rich and oily, but not too overpowering or fishy. The parmesan provided a sharp flavor contrast, while the crunchy celery provided texture contrast. Not liking the taste of celery, I appreciated how the paper thin slices kept the flavor subtle enough for me to enjoy it.\n\nBellwether Farms Ricotta Gnocchi with Leeks - Heavenly pillows! The gnocchi had such an extraordinarily light and fluffy consistency - it was almost like they dissolved in my mouth. The leeks added a delicate, sweet onion flavor. The dish was buttery and rich yet also surprisingly light - needless to say, it was gobbled up in mere seconds! \n\nBrick Oven Roasted Chicken for Two with Tuscan Warm Bread Salad - very tasty chicken...the skin was deliciously seasoned and the meat was extremely moist and tender. The warm bread salad added to the rustic and hearty feel of the dish, while the mustard greens, currants, and pine nuts rounded out the flavors and textures. I only wish the chicken had been served at a warmer temperature - not sure why it wasn't since it was made to order\n\nCr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche Panna Cotta with Wild Huckleberry Sauce - a great way to end a delicious meal. I was originally worried that the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche would give the panna cotta a sour tone, but instead it actually added a creamy complexity while keeping the panna cotta remarkably light. The sweet huckleberry sauce was a perfect complement. \n\nI would definitely go back to Zuni Caf\u00e9 again. This experience more than made up for my last one - this is why I believe you really have to dine at a restaurant more than once to get a true sense of a place. Although I thought the chicken was very good, I wouldn't wait an hour for it again nor do I think it's worth $48 (hubby disagrees) - I'd rather order some of the other entrees next time...or just feast on their incredible oysters!\n\nFor pics of each course, go to my personal blog (link under my profile).", "author": "Karin V."}

For a restaurant with such a long run, it is remarkably inconsistent.  \n\nFor me, the mainstays:  marinated olives, shoestring potatoes, the aioli, the caesar salad.  Waiting for a table at the beautiful brass bar.  The view from the window at the first-come tables.\n\nThe rest of the food has varied for me.  Sometimes the beef is unctuous and rich and sauced well.  Sometimes the fish is under-seasoned, presently clumsily in a baking dish with odd wilted vegetables.  The chicken's reputation precedes it, but I found it over-salty and heavy.  It was probably the best chicken in town ten years ago, but the youngsters (e.g. Range) have Zuni beat with more refined offerings.  There's the burger which is kind of a guilty pleasure; but I feel the same way about it as the chicken, and I don't much like the cured-meat texture of it that's apparently deliberate (I understand it's seasoned the night before, usually a no-no with ground meat).\n\nThe desserts are always good but they're presented with obscure names.  I guess that's a way of sparking conversation.  There's always a granita or two, and I always wonder who pays $8 for the equivalent of a sno-cone.\n\nFor its ups and downs, though, I can't really imagine the city without Zuni.

Perhaps it was because it was a rainy Wednesday evening, but we were seated fairly promptly, our drinks thoughtfully carried from the bar to our table by the hostess (always will get major prompts from me for this service).  Our Waiter was fantastic, promptly putting in our Roast Chicken order and bring another round of drinks.  My friend ordered the Caesar Salad and I got the Chicory Greens, both were good.  We noshed on ACME bread and shoestring fries until the Roasted Chicken came out (it did take 71 minutes - close to their promised 75min).  The chicken was fantastic, seasoned nicely, and very juicy.  I wasn't a big fan of the warm bread salad but did enjoy the dressed mustard greens.  Gateau Victoire (flourless chocolate cake) was a lovely end to the meal ... not overly sweet and having a lovely crumb texture.  I eat out quite a bit and found my dining experience at Zuni Cafe to be excellent.  Thank You Zuni Cafe!  Keep up the good work!", "author": "Mark F."}

However, we were seated upstairs in a quiet room with just a couple of other tables and there was something off-putting and unenthusiastic about our waiter, who seemed put out and failed to make eye contact or to demonstrate any warmth about our celebration. In fact, each time we asked a question or made a request he seemed to smirk and scoff with a less than positive attitude. Needless to say, we didn't appreciate his haughty attitude, but the final straw was when I asked that he reverse the charges to my friend's credit card as I wanted to treat since they had flown in for my birthday. Instead of graciously saying he would take care of this for me, he could barely contain his annoyance and proceeded to berate me and tell me more than once that it was \"against policy\" but he would \"do it just this once\" (as if I were going to come back and do it again). To top it off, I had made the reservation and given my credit card preemptively so it was his mistake for failing to follow my request as the host of the party. I still have him a healthy tip, but all of us agreed that had we not had a fantastic show to see and a terrific weekend in Wine Country planned this would have been a terrible way to remember a 50th birthday. The following night we dined at Thomas Keller's pop up restaurant Ad Lib, and from the moment we were seated the service was warm, inviting and so gracious. Not only did they have. Menu ready with a birthday salutation, the GM attended to us and Chef Keller came and sat at our table to sign menus. To top it off they stuck an exploding roman type of candle in our cake and toasted us with champagne. This, we all remarked, far exceeded our expectations and highlighted for us the stark contrast in service and attention. Too bad, because the food continues to be  wonderful at Zuni. I did speak to a manager who said she would talk to the waiter, and I hope she does as it really did seem to be a training issue.", "author": "Gadget G."}

This geographic blessing has lead me on two trips to Zuni in two days. Both times I went with the burger, and I think this gave me a pretty good sense of the sort of variation you can get from the kitchen in terms of quality.\n\nThe first day, I went with the blue cheese. The second, with the gruyere. Although I love to pair blue cheese with beef, you walk a fine line with blue because too much can easily overwhelm the flavor of the entier thing. But there was no danger of that at Zuni. To be honest, I couldn't really taste the flavor of the blue. It most definitely could've benefited from a larger piece, or just maybe something stronger. The burger with the gruyere was definitely better, but part of that might've had to do more with other factors.\n\nIn both instances, I ordered my burger medium rare. This is what I mean by variation in the kitchen. The first burger came out noticeably bloodier, and the second was almost cooked medium. Normally I'm not a fan of beef that's cooked past medium rare, but I found that at Zuni, I preferred the slightly more medium burger. It t gave the fat a chance to melt, making the burger unbelievably juicy. I should note that the first time I went, I was with a group of 7 so the wait times may have affected the taste.\n\nOverall the burger was pretty damn good, good enough to have for lunch regularly, but there's no way I would go so far as to say it's the best or in my top 3 of burgers in served in the city.\n\nOn a side note: the persimmon salad was incredible. It's probably seasonal but definitely check it out if when it's on the menu. The shoestring fries weren't much of anything. I found them a little too thinly sliced to be much of anything to me.\n\nPS. The service here is phenomenal. First-class all the way. I was impressed both times I went.", "author": "Cristofer P."}

So, if you are looking for something to blow you away with it's fresh newness, this is definitely not the place. However, I would recommend everyone come here once. Maybe twice. \n\nThis is definitely the place to come if you want to know what's on the menu. You could bring your Grandma here and she would recognize most of the ingredients. The restaurant itself is a clean, beautiful space that starts out narrow and gets more comfortable in the back where it opens up a little. There is a some back up in the bar area, but the cocktails are worth the pushing and shoving. The only real problem is that if they seat you upstairs it's pretty warm. There are some fans, but even on the evening we were there which was a typical cold, foggy night, it was stuffy and my shirt was sticking to my back by the end of the meal. \n\nAs far as the food goes, if you don't order the chicken you might as well not go. It's pretty much one of the best things I've ever had. How they can make something so basic taste so superb is a wonder. It has just enough of  a hint of citrus and fresh herbs and the bread salad with currants and pine nuts is perfect for soaking up all of that divine chicken flavor. But some dishes are a waste. Two people ordered dishes that were boring and bland, don't worry they are no longer on the ever-changing menu. \n\nThe brightest spot at this restaurant is the service. Our server was perfect. He was completely knowledgeable and patient while being completely charming. This would probably be the sole reason I would come back, that and the chicken. \n\nWhat else can I say? It was good and expensive. Not great. But I invite everyone to find out on their own.", "author": "Andrew D."}

Zuni has so many good qualities and has the potential to be amazing, but \"inconsistent\" is the key word here. \n\nFirst of all, I'm not one of those people that believes in under-salting something with the attitude that \"if it's not salty enough, the customer can salt it to their liking.\" I understand the concept, but I am really not down with the practice. The last time I was here we got 3 different appetizers, one of which was really tasty (the corn soup), and 2 that were just mediocre (the fried cauliflower/onion dish, and the prosciutto crostini). They were quite simply too bland, and a little bit of salt would've gone a very long way. The flourless chocolate cake was good, but not memorable. I mean, really, it's hard to make flourless chocolate cake taste bad.\n\nI know they are fairly known for the roast chicken with bread salad, and I'm not going to say it was bad. It was good. Was it $24/person and a 1 hour wait good? No. There wasn't anything about it to make me say \"Wow, chicken has been taken to a new level!\" \n\nOn the plus side, it is a great place to people watch and have a cocktail. If you're looking for atmosphere and location over the quality of the food, then this is definitely a great spot.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is warm and inviting and service is friendly.  Their menu is pretty small, so it may be worthwhile to check it out before making a reservation.  When I dined there recently, none of the entrees really appealed to me.  I settled on a white chicory salad and the beef entree.  Their famous roasted chicken seemed like the best item on the menu, but the parenthetical statement \"(approx. 1 hour)\" was a big turn-off.  I asked the waiter if that meant that we'd have to wait an hour for the entree.  He replied, smartly, \"Only if you want it cooked!\".  Ha, ha...Ok, wiseguy.  It may be worth the wait, but I felt an hour was excessive.  \nNevertheless, the salad was very basic but well-dressed.  The beef entree came with excellent mashed potatoes and a few pieces of baby carrots and a grilled scallion. The beef itself was so tender that you could cut it with a fork.  Note that it only comes cooked one way - rare-med. rare and very pink.  Although the jus was a bit too salty for my taste, the dish was very good overall.

If you are looking for a ahi tuna tartare tower showered in caviar with drippings of the finest olive oil, you won't find it here. Instead, standing as an iconoclast, this restaurant celebrates simplicity--the execution is simple yet the effect is a focused and elegant meal. \n\nHaving dined here twice, I have had the caesar salad, the zuni roast chicken, oysters and mimosas. The simple yet elegant caesar salad embodies the spirit of this restaurant. The salad was carried by the potent but smooth made-from-scratch dressing. The oysters were extremely fresh. The mimosas was made from freshly squeezed OJ. As a testament to the quality of the service, when my friend accidentally spilled his mimosa, the staff came back and gave us another mimosa. This stands in contrast to more avant garde places where such an act would warrant dirty stares and the judgmental wait staff. \n\nThe only disappointment was zuni chicken (for two). As a very pricey plate, I was expecting something magical. The chicken was done very well and the chicken breast was juicier than some chicken thighs I've had at other places. However, the skin could have been crispier and I felt that the chicken overall was over-salted. And for the price, it's really hard to argue that was $30 better than a costco rotisserie chicken. The interesting thing is that this very cost analysis I am doing here could be the reason why restaurants like this do not always flourish (esp. at these prices). While making the best chicken possible is a hard ordeal, our ability to create food has evolved in such a way that a place like Costco can deliver 70% of the enjoyment at less than a quarter of the price. It's this tension that may actually cause restaurants to move towards complexity--the more 'avant garde' my menu looks, the harder it is to compare this against a less complex commodified plate that can be had at cheaper fares.", "author": "Andrew H."}

Zuni is a classic and has retained its status as one of the most impressive dining establishments in San Francisco for as long as i can remember (which is an embarrassingly long period of time) - to do this, a place really needs to stand out among the noise of all the newest/hottest restaurants in town.  \n\ni haven't been here since i was commuting from SF while living in LA.  at that time. i was working in the FiDi and staying just a few blocks aways 2-4 nights per week so i didn't often get out of the immediate neighborhood. this was one of my crew's favorite places so we frequented the joint often.  dinner at Zuni was just where we used to meet after work. but since moving here, i don't live right there anymore and have been exploring other parts of the city.  years later, i made it back here upon the request of the cutest girl i've ever seen that wears a lip piercing.  \n \none complaint on the appetizer menu... it was a bit of a trick to pick an appetizer.  the dinner menu wasn't infested with tantalizing appetizer options and we ended up with a basic caesar salad which was good, i suppose.  my pork shoulder was excellent, the design of the place is very dot-comy even though i guess it's been around a lot longer than that.  the pierced-lip had the salmon and there didn't seem to be any complaints from that side of the table. Zuni is actually even more attractive now than it was before since a couple wine bars and various secondary spots to go before/after dinner have now popped up in the immediate area, particularly noteworthy being Hotel Biron, the hardest working wine bar in SF, which is little just 1-2 doors down.  \n \ndownsides were not numerous nor serious but minor issues were: didn't get seated till 10:20p (from a 10p reservation), slightly slow service.  combine both those issues and we decided to skip dessert and get it at tart-n-tart in the sunset instead... lastly: lack of appetizer selection noted above.  the wine suggestion from the server was quite good as well so that's one more on the positive side. \n \nall in all, the downsides were tiny in the face of what is basically a landmark restaurant in the city.  it's a must-go type of place for anyone doing any serious eating in the city.  although i didn't have them this time around, the roast chicken and the shellfish are the signatures here that stand the test of time from when this place was opened in 1979. despite my nit-picking, i think it's as good as it was when i was eating here like it was my own kitchen.  more like a 4.5 star review.", "author": "dan h."}

Feels refined yet cozy.\n\nFood:\nSelection of oysters - very fresh\nChicken - simply seasoned and cooked, but so delicious. The bread underneath soaks up the juices and they were a bit vinegary/winey too, which made them oh so good with the chicken. Raisins, pine nuts, and arugula balanced out this dish.\nThere was more, I can't remember what, though. Rest assured, the food was all good.\n\nDrinks: \nWe liked them.\nI ordered a hibiscus punch, only to realize I got a cocktail when the bill came (I had an inkling, but hibiscus is strong and my company didn't think it was alcoholic either). This explains the tiredness. And the ensuing giggles. The staff left a new cocktail off the menu, and mistakenly thought that's what I'd ordered. Our waiter mentioned it's a good thing they didn't serve it to a child. \n\nService:\nOur waiter was excellent the entire evening, and apologized profusely for the cocktail mix up (pun not intended). He comped the drink and also the desserts. The check kept going back and forth, and in the end we got charged for the desserts anyway, but we didn't want to wait for it to be fixed.\n\nDesserts:\nI had the pavolva. Thin meringue cookies with raspberries. So good. I don't remember what my friends got but their desserts were delicious too.\n\nI will definitely come here again.

On a brilliantly warm sunny day, we decided to try Zuni again - and while we were at it, order their critically acclaimed burger.\n\nWe were all sorry we decided to spend our lunch there. Two of the three of us requested our burgers cooked medium. I even mentioned that I wanted it cooked on the medium-well-ish side of medium. Our two burgers were rare all the way to the edge of the patty. Where I come from, that's blue.\n\nBut that's okay... I peeled off the 1/8\" of cooked meat from the top of the patty and removed the raw remains. I guess it became a skinny burger. Yeah right.\n\nMy other friend ordered her burger rare, which was blue of course, and that wouldn't have been so bad for her if only the meat were seasoned.\n\nReally... for $15 couldn't they put at least a little salt and pepper on the meat before they cook it?\n\nDon't mention the side salads. Really, don't. You practically won't see them anyway... they're so small. But you'll pay for them. They're about $8 each.\n\nI'm no cheapskate, mind you. I'm all about forking over cash for good food. But when I feel like all I'm getting for my hard-earned dime is a long-standing reputation that's not followed through with a quality product, I'll be sure to carve out time within four hours of my experience to yelp about it. That's what just happened here.\n\nMy advice:  Take your $120 and your two friends to Zazie or Nopa for a life-changing burger-and-wine lunch in a great setting.

It was that good. The wine-and-butter drenched stuffing underneath might have even been better than the chicken itself. It's hard to say. \n\nWe sat upstairs in an intimate space in one of the small nook dining areas. Our waiter was very much on top of things - gave good recommendations, filled our glasses on several occasions and was timely with each course. He put in our chicken order right away so we weren't waiting hungry during the 1 hour it takes to roast each bird.\n\nStarted with a few Drake and Kumamoto oysters and a $30 or so bottle of Sauvingon Blanc (it was really an economical choice since wines by the glass start at 12 and 14 each.) Can't beat the Kumamotos...while they're small they are consistently the best. \n\nWe split the Caesar salad which was ok...not really sure why they call it the \"Zuni Caesar\" since there wasn't anything particularly special about it. \n\nThe roasted chicken, however, was deliciously special. Big enough for 2 and a few bites the next day, it was roasted with toasted bread stuffing, pine nuts, mustard greens, currants, garlic, pepper, wine vinegar - and small slices of heaven. Our side of polenta was the best I've had in a restaurant (my mom's is still pretty darn good) and not overwhelmingly rich from too much butter and cheese (you can only take so much--sorry Delfina.)\n\nFor dessert we tried the lemony cream \"deconstructed lemon-meringue\" pie dish, which was light and refreshing.

But what really made the evening a five star experience was the service!   I haven't been in a restaurant with such an excellent waiter in a very long time I realized.

The bar and the restaurant was in full effect, but luckily we were taken to one of the smaller little alcoves upstairs where it wasnt too loud. \n\nOur server was very nice, and was always on top of our beverage refilling and bread (mmmmm) replacing.

My sweet baby loooves Caesars, and having had this dish several times in the past, it was a logical choice. It was just as good as I remember, with the beautiful uncut leaves of romaine tossed with that infamous dressing, house-made croutons, and shaved parmesan. YUUUUM, and it is the perfect size to share for 2 people, and very reasonably priced at $10.\n\nFor the main dish, we had to order the Roast Chicken for 2. My sweet baby loves chicken, and I needed to see for myself what all the hype was about. Well my friends, there's no hype here. This chicken is unbelievable. It comes with the warm bread salad, greens, and topped with pine nuts and currants. The little currants add a unique and delicious sweetness to the unbelievably moist chicken. The crackly skin....sorry...started drooling.....what was I saying again? Oh right. The chicken definitely lived up to its reputation. We even had some left to bring home, which my sweet baby was disappointed to learn that I had generously shared our wealth and given it to her roomates!

She promptly placed our order then came back for our next order.\n\nFirst of, they have a good selection of oysters. Had the kumamoto, marin miyagi, and drake's. All in this region. Very fresh. They dont give you a side of marinara but instead, it's vinegar with garlic.\n\nCocktails were stiff but it comes in small glasses.\n\nThen came the salad. King Farm garden lettuce salad with garlic chapons and Banyuls vinaigrette. Decent.\n\nThe sommelier recommended a really good wine to go with the chicken. A red from the Savoie region of France. Pretty different from what I'm used to drinking. Great half bottle price too!\n\nNow, for the star of the night. Coming from Modesto Farm (as our server told me), as my friend who took me there said \"it's the most beautiful chicken I have ever seen and eaten.\" The chicken is simple and perfectly seasoned. Juicy, tender, and even the breast is moist. The bed of warm flatbread soaked up some of the juices and the dressing of the salad it came with. Loved it.\n\nThe bad: shoestring potatoes were a tad salty.\n\nWe were so full from the chicken but we just had to try the dessert. Piccola meringata. Merengue wafers layered with cream.

We had the roasted chicken for 2 (~$50), a fried asparagus/onions/lemon slice appetizer, bottle of Napa Valley Sauv Blanc, Caesar Salad, and two desserts.  Yes, the ordering was heavily influenced by the other reviews here.  Yes, the chicken is as good as they say.  \n\nThe Chicken was served in a bed of greens and pieces of bread to soak up the chicken goodness.  Moist and clean tasting.  I tried looking for a dry spot, and couldn't find any.  I really think this is the best roasted chicken I've had in my life.  Maybe not dollar for dollar, but for the taste, yes.  The Sauv Blanc didn't have much character (compared to other Sauv Blancs)... actually kinda sucked, but I don't put the blame on the restaurant.  The fried veggie appetizer was very tasty and seemingly light, to my surprise.  Desserts were nicely presented.but too sweet for my taste.    \n\nService at this joint was above average, even for these fancy-schmancy restaurants.  They set the expectation at 1 hour wait for the Chicken, but I think it only took about 30 minutes to arrive.  When the Maitre d' came around and asked how our meal was, I told him that we never got our Caesar Salad, but can just cancel it since we're onto the tasty chicken.  He then swiftly offered to bring it anyway and comp it, if we wouldn't mind.  We took him up on the offer and had a fresh Caesar Salad with the chicken.  \n\nOverall I would recommend that people come checkout the roasted chicken at least.  It is definitely fantastic and lives up to the hype.", "author": "Leo C."}

He hits me up to go out to dinner. He says Zuni at 9pm. Awesome, as I'd never been there before. \n\nWe get there slightly tardy for our reservation, but it's ok because there aren't very many people there. Nice for a Sunday night. They seat us in a cozy corner upstairs. The first ego-boosting moment of the evening is when the lovely hostess said she LOVED my new red wool coat. Being as I'm totally jazzed about it, that was pretty cool. \n\nSince Daniel had requested the company of a beautiful woman for his birthday (I told him it would be a stretch, as it was ME who he was going out with), I put on a retro 40's style dress that is quite low cut and really shows off the girls. When I took my coat off when we sat down, every guy that was seated looking towards us stopped and stared. Daniel got the nod from a few of them. It was hilarious. \n\nNow, on to the real review... Our cocktails were fabulous (I got D to try a Sazerac despite the fact he doesn't normally like whiskey) and I had the Elderflower/Champagne cocktail. It was more than delightful. Our server was a bit scattered it seemed, but actually worked out OK in the end due to the fact that he was very knowledgeable about the bottle of wine I requested. This is always a plus! \n\nWe ordered the Cesar Salad (which was a little overdressed for my liking. If the amount of oil in something you're eating can remove the very nearly unremoveable lipstick from your lips after three bites, there might be a problem!) and then I saw a plate of the shoestring potatoes go by. Had to have some of those. They came promptly and was a nice thing to nibble on before the main course. \n\nI ordered the skirt steak and Daniel had the pot roast. both dishes were super yummy and the fact that mine came with an artichoke was super great. \n\nThe desert we had (apple torte with molasses ice cream and booze-soaked currants) sounded WAY better than it actually was, so that was a bit disappointing. \n\nAll in all, the dining experience was lovely, the wine (2005 Swan something or other from Russian River Valley - help me out - anyone...?) was exactly as promised and fun was had by all.", "author": "MoMo D."}

Oh! and if the butter beans are on the menu you must order them, you must!\n\nThe chicken takes forever, at least an hour wait, but it is so worth it. The simple, yet utterly delicious warm bread salad really makes the dish extra special. Next time I'm ordering extra bread salad. It's made like a simple stuffing with torn bread, toasted in the brick oven, tossed with clarified butter and olive oil, mixed with currants, pine nuts, and garlic. They put that in the bowl first, then add red mustard greens drizzled with olive oil, then the roast chicken cut into pieces and placed on top of all with the pan juices. OMFG! It is the best chicken Jerry, the best!\n\nAnd the hamburger. Seriously, you'll never taste a better burger. They offer some fine cheeses to go on top, and some other jazz if you want it, but just the plain ol' burger is aces. The taste of the meat is incredible. Gotta be grass fed. I think the shoe string potatoes comes with the burger (not sure). If they don't, please order them as a side. They are crispy and yummy and plentiful, and come with a side of home-made ketchup. So damn good.\n\nMy one complaint about this place is the lack of appetizers. I mean, they offer great olives, but other than that, the app choices are not really appealing to me.

If you plan on ordering this, might as well order it through the host if you want to shave off your time here. \n\nThe gnocchi is a must try. It's not your traditional Italian grandmother's heavy potato nuggets. Zuni makes them out of the softest, puffiest ricotta cheese swimming in a delicate pool of butter and light herbs. It was one of those savored dining experiences I'll never forget. You cut into the smooth cheese and it melts like ice cream once you put it in your mouth. It just falls apart and the butter sauce melds perfectly with the subtle cheese. \n\nTheir famed roasted chicken was pretty good, but we kept saying it tasted familiar. Like Limon? CostCo rotisserie? It didn't taste spectacular... sure, it was brined well, moist, crispy skin, but when it comes down to it, it's just roast chicken! It's a hefty portion... made for two? More like made for four! Along with the chicken was a bed of toasted bread soaked in a vinegary sauce. Now, that was unique, but ultimately too heavy as an accompaniment with the chicken.\n\nService was impeccable!

We had a reservation for 6:15 and were promptly sat. Though the hostess and person who called to confirm the reservation both knew we were heading to the theatre, our server was not informed. \n\nI was so excited to share Zuni with my mom, who is a chef. We planned to order the chicken, but after waiting 10 minutes for our server, were informed it would be cutting it too close (ordering at 6:25, chicken wouldn't arrive til 7:25- show at 8). So a note to theatre goers: maybe try to order the chicken when you first walk in, if possible? \n\nWe ordered the pork chop and halibut, as well as the Zuni Caesar. The pork chop was fatty, and nothing special. I've had better. Especially for $26.50- way overpriced. My mom's halibut was luke warm and flavorless, she should have sent it back. \n\nAs far as dessert, our waitor suggested the \"Gateau\" which is like a flourless chocolate cake.

The outside of the fish was grilled perfectly with some crispy texture and some saltiness to the palette.  This is cooked pretty much medium-rare so be prepared! The second dish was the pork chops and it was good but a little salty to my taste.  I thought the pork chops were a little overcooked but it was still juicy.  I was expecting it to be a little bit pink but it was thoroughly cooked.  Then, last but not least was their well-known rotisserie chicken with bread salad.  I was more amazed with the bread salad than the chicken because honestly, Costco's rotisserie chicken is way better than Zuni's chicken.  Zuni's chicken had a great balance of salt and juiciness but the flavor wasn't completely there.  As 10 min passed by, I thought the chicken tasted dry already.

There are fresh greens and vinagrette on top. It's amazing. My reason for 3 stars is the pricing is just over the top. $12 for a martini sized cocktail. $50 for a chicken plus tax can't really be rationalized. Also, the chairs are really uncomfortable. We had an incident where my husband spilled my wine so I ordered another glass. I was surprised that we were charged for that. The food is prepared meticulously and you feel that you are somewhere special. I do recommend it for a special occasion. Make a reservation. I guess it's like the in crowd in high school. It's cool to be there, but it's not really comfortable. I think there should be much more effort to be warm and welcoming and they really need new chairs.", "author": "Lisa S."}

The place has totally lost its edge.  Recently I was asked to leave because I complained that the Cafe Latte was too hot and tasted bad.  The waiter came and asked me if I knew that Cafe Latte had more milk than foam. I told her that I didn't need her to tell me what a Cafe Latte was.  Then the manager (Mark Simmons) came and asked me if there was a problem. So I shared with him the experience with sweet sincerity. I told him that the place had lost its edge. The bathroom's sink faucet didn't work (had not worked for months), the chicken (signature dish) had come burned last 2 times I was there. And the Cafe Latte just tasted bad. I told him I would go there because I love the place and wanted to support it as an iconic restaurant in San Francisco. He then asked me to leave and told me they wouldn't serve me because I was belligerent.  I tried to calm him down to at least serve my two boys their burgers. He was insitent that we had to leave and that he wouldn't serve us. So we left. Not cool. Not nice. Bad place. Would urge people to boycott this place. Gone too far.  Sad to see an icon go this far south into the dregs.  Take the critique.  Give us a good new Cafe Latte and go on with business.  No need for all this unless Mark Simmons got a chip on his shoulder.", "author": "Arman P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-12-06", "description": "Well, after the fandango around making our late night reservations last week, it seemed everything was in place for us to dine at Zuni at 10pm. I did have one more guest and called them the day before feeling great trepidation because of my previous experience with a reservationist. This time they just said \"no problem at all; you just might need to wait 10 or 15 minutes.\" Which was fine.\n\nSo we arrived (late) and they were able to sit six of us with no problems. I'm not sure why they said they could only seat four when I called last week, but winging it at the last minute seemed to go just fine.\n\nI have lived in in SF for the past 25 years, but until this point I had only actually been to Zuni twice; once, to try their margarita and another time to try their roast chicken. So I had never really had a dining adventure with their menu or seen their full service in action.\n\nIt was fun getting there so late and I'm so glad they could accomodate us. We had been to the theatre so had lots to talk about with one of the actors at the table with us. They let us take it slow even at that hour which is also much appreciated. \n\nEverything on the menu except for just a few items was available. \n\nWe started with the Fettunta. I am sure many have heard of that, but the way the Waiter explained it was, \"Well it's a vehicle really... see in Italy they cold press this green green olive oil and in less than two days it's flown here and we serve it at the table. It's like the beaujolais nouveaux of olive oil.\" That last part really got our San Francisco Muppie hearts pounding. Then he said, \"So well actually it's toast.\"\n\nAnyway, the Fettunta arrived in the form of a nice toasted slab of tuscan-style bread soaked with this Olio Verde, which we cut up into many small bits. Also some raw raddicchio leaves, carrot curls, and tender baby celery stalks. We all took a bite of the fettunta and simultaneously our eyes got wide and that's when our heads exploded and the waiters had to tell the bus boys to mop the ceilings.\n\nI have since looked up the word Fettunta online, and despite the fact that it sounds kind of like a lewd name for a body part in Italian, it's really basically the purest form of garlic bread, heavy on the Olio. My theory is that some of the spiciness may have been a garlic kick although perhaps there was no garlic included - there was just a very grassy, then spicy, then nutty progression over about 15 seconds; I'm going to get a bottle of that Olio Verde at Zuni this week for the holidays, and I plan to ask them if there is garlic in their Fettunta (not a euphemism).\n\nWe also enjoyed their frites by the handful. Worth stopping by for the frites and I'd love to try their other fried veggie appetizer.\n\nI had the grouper with capers and shallots alongside another toast which had chard, meyer lemon, and boiled egg on top of it. It was all really soulful and delicious, and maybe I was dreaming but it tasted like it had yet more of the wonderful Olio Verde on it. My immediate dining companion enjoyed a bowl of polenta, which was another dimension in comfort food. Others had the whole wheat spaghetti with veggies and the conigio appetizer. Their wine selection was nice and the cocktails were good, and we shared a floating island at the end - a delicate white creme anglaise dotted with pistachios and pomegranate seeds, with a sweet little white meringue in the center.\n\nI also appreciated the hot toddy the waiter brought when I said I had a cold. It was like theraflu only much better :-)\n\nWe stayed til after 12:30 and there were still guests in the place. The restaurant business can be hard on the body and mind, and I'm impressed that a place like Zuni can maintain such great comfort and decorum after such an intensely long day. I wish I had the means to make it a point to go there a lot more often. Actually I may stop in tomorrow for a couple of bottles of that Olive Oil as Christmas gifts. And I might also have a burger while I'm there :-)", "author": "Roxmarie M."}

I was pleasantly surprised that they led me to a little nook with a table set for one with bench seating. (Makes me wonder if they change up the seating arrangements for dinner service.) I got to be a part of \"the action\" while still having privacy to savor my lunch (there was savoring going on, eventhough I finished my meal quickly - I enjoyed every bite) and listen to my news podcast/daydream.\n\nBread: Mmmm...baked in wood/stone oven?\n\nBeverage: I was sad that they didn't have regular sparkling San Pellegrino since it would've paired perfectly with the food I was going to order - and the ambiance - but their orange juice was fantastic - pulpy and naturally sweet. Just looking at the vibrant orange color made me feel like I was drinking in the Spring season.\n\nEntree: Crostini with kale something something and a poached egg...YUM! I finished it in less than five minutes - hit the spot. Not super filling. Not recommended for those who want a heavy meal. I wanted to pick up the bowl plate and drink the rest of the \"juices\" but refrained. For a split second I wished I had more of that wood/stone oven baked bread but something told me to hold off.\n\nDessert: Gateau Victoire with whipped cream...DELISH! I'm so glad I didn't ask for extra bread (aside from looking a little ridiculous and indulgent - no having a slice of flourless chocolate cake doused with whipped cream is not indulgent... =P). Can't put my finger on what made it so good...the cake had a crumbly texture to it so it felt like a regular chocolate cake but the taste was so purely cocoa...like when you are making hot chocolate and you scoop that spoonful of cocoa powder into your mouth, rather than the cup - two for the cup, one for me)...or was it the smooth light and fluffy whipped cream that held pieces of cake together while it sat on my fork but melted away instantly on my tongue...? \n\nSimply perfect - recommended for solo dining or even for groups. Looks like quite a few people were enjoying lunch with friends, family and even coworkers. The waitstaff was fantastic as well. I hope to try their brunch sometime or even just a pizza and some wine - yes, it's one of those types of places. And yes, several tables around me ordered the pizza - made me want to stay for a second lunch but alas, I needed to return to work.", "author": "Cat T."}

I really did say I had a blind date with a gay man. And boy oh boy was he hot. Like one of the hottest men (gay or straight) that I have ever met. Oh yes. I'm going on too long about my blind date huh? \n\nOk, moving on... \n\nI come in and I am politely greeted. My really hot date hasn't arrived yet, so I grab a spot at the bar and sip my Anchor Steam while I wait for my aforementioned hot date. \n\nLet's play a game ok? You the reader and me the writer. Let's see how many times I mention my really hot gay blind date.\n\nSo I'm drinking my beer and chatting with the bartender. He recently also relocated from NYC, so we chatted about the differences between the two cities and had a laugh. And in walks my really hot date. Before my really hot date arrived though, along with chatting with the bartender, I enjoyed the live music being pumped out of the baby grand piano by the handsome, smiling piano player. \n\nSo me and my really hot date are seated and since he knows this place really well (*cough* he's one of the managers *cough*), I let him do all of the ordering. \n\nOne thing he mentions is that Zuni Cafe is basically the epitome of California dining. Everything on the menu is locally grown, raised, bred, sold, whatever you want to call it. And almost everything on the menu is organic. Another highlight of the Zuni Cafe menu is that it changes D-A-I-L-Y, except for the roasted chicken, which is an every day feature on the menu. \n\nTo start me and my hot date had:\n\nCrostini with duck sugo and wild mushrooms - I am a new found lover of duck, thanks to Ad Hoc's Easter Brunch, and this duck was no exception. It was GREAT! Flavorful, a little salty, nice crunch to the crostini. Just yummmmmy... \n\nAsparagus with toasted breadcrumbs salsa, chervil and hard cooked egg - The breadcrumb salsa was tangy and had a nice bite to it. The asparagus was lightly cooked, so it was soft, yet still had quite a bit of crunch.\n\nPolenta with parmesan - I grew up in the south where grits was part of my daily menu. I heard that polenta is slightly different, but overall, the closest thing to grits. To me, polenta tastes exactly like grits. I like the parmesan in this dish. Gave it a nice salty flavor. \n\nWhole wheat spaghetti with puntarelle, garlic, capers, red onions and hot pepper - Seriously, this dish was fuckin awesome! I love capers and until last night, I didn't realize how much I missed eating them. I've never been a big fan of whole wheat pasta, but with all these tangy and spicy spices, this pasta did packed a lot of flavor. (The menu item actually contained tuna confit, but me and my hot date asked to leave off the tuna due to my allergy to fish)\n\nFor the main course:\n\nChicken for two: Brick oven roasted chicken that comes with a warm bread salad with scallions, currants and pine nuts. This dish is roasted fresh and individually, so no over cooked chicken here. This was by far, the best chicken dish that I have ever had, outside of my very own kitchen. It's easy to see why this is an every day menu item. \n\nFor wine, me and my hot date had a slightly chilled Grenache blend from Domaine La Milliere in France. Fragrant, a little spicy and beefy and actually really good with chicken. \n\nThis meal was perfection thanks to my really hot date. ;)", "author": "Jen D."}

He popped up at random times and was really quiet.  While I can't stand it when the waiter ruins your meal by becoming a permanent fixture at your table by talking your ear off, I would have preferred a little more face time with ours so that he could help explain the menu to us a bit.  Things like \"lonza\" and \"garganelli\" and \"garlic chapons\" aren't necessarily a part of my daily jargon.  It felt like Zuni was trying too hard and they just came off as being pretentious.\n\nWhile the food was decent, it wasn't great or anything spectacular, and the portions were TEENSY WEENSY - for a fifteen-dollar egg scramble, I expect a damn delicious scramble that will leave me satisfied, but alas I was not.  My fried eggs were ok but, again, not anything noteworthy, and the fennel sausage that came on the side was not hot, and if you know me, I find any sausage less than piping hot unacceptable.  The bread was the saving grace of the meal because without it, we would have left hungry.  \n\nWe started with the house-cured anchovies with celery, nicoise olives, and parmesan, and while this was tasty, one could hardly call this a dish.  Yes, I realize it was an app, but there were literally 4 thin slices of cheese, 5 tiny anchovies, and celery slices the size of my pinky nail...This thing was $8??\n\nTo end, we had the Piccola Meringata - this was delicious.  The light merengue discs atop fluffy creme fraiche, huckleberry sauce, and candied tangerine bits is not to be missed.  I also really love the atmosphere and the open, airy feel to Zuni.

We had to laugh... even though, OUCH, that hurt.\n\nIt took us over a year to get to that burger at Zuni that came so highly recommended as a top contender for SF's finest beef. Problem with Zuni is they only serve their burger at lunch or after 10pm. Being the geriatric peeps we seem to be these days as well as not sharing a lunch hour any day of the week, the hubby and I took months and months to get this burger tried out.\n\nBut alas it finally did happen. And this burger was delicious. It was top quality, it was finely made... \n\nCouple of issues... First? It was definitely on the wrong bread - focaccia. Um, no, that is just wrong. Focaccia does not make a good burger bun no matter how fancy pants your burger is. Also, the burgers were ordered medium and came to the table oozing red juice and were red in the middle, not pink but red. When we pointed it out our server told us that is their \"version\" of medium. Since when is this Argentina? Rare, medium-rare, medium and well done are universal terms in the food industry and I don't appreciate that term being twisted around unnecessarily.\n\nAfter sending them back to finish them a bit more they arrived cooked perfectly but unfortunately the cook had forgotten the garlic aioli on the bottom bun (as he had re-bunned us after the first ones were soaked through with meat drippings). So now we needed to ask for more aioli. It was almost starting to get comical but then the rest of the meal just started to flow. Great burger despite the lame bun. Fries - pomme frites - whatever... were out of this world. Thank God we had those to chow down on while the burger fiasco was unfolding. \n\nIt was all good in the end though. If you want to consider a $50 burger lunch \"good\"...\n\n I love the interior feel of Zuni like it was my own home but better. It's so warm and welcoming inside, and service was top notch.

But they failed miserably, thanks to the haughty and childish demeanor of many of its staff. A well-known verdict in the food scene around the Bay: Zuni's staff is littered with undeserving, pretentious snobs who taint the otherwise impressive menu that is served here.\n\nMy friends and I do not enter this restaurant to be smeared with cliquish behavior. I come to enjoy the food, particulary the vast oyster menu. But twice in 2007, my dinner mates and I got the smear, and finally today, yet another bad experience set me off to discuss the matter with the co-owner, Mr. Pilgram. \n\nThe first time, our arrogant and inattentive waitress blew it at the table, and after I posted a Yelp review, she sent me a nasty message, only compounding the situation. I mentioned this to a host by the name of Ren, yet he did nothing about my compaint (of course you shouldn't bother complaining to hosts, since they just do not give a shit). \n\nOur second experience wasn't much better. Though our salads and soups were hearty and comforting, again the waiter (David) was NOT. He wore a cold scowl that made the flowers wilt at our table, and he never changed that empty face. My dinner mate whispered to me several times, \"So what's his problem, are they all like that?\" This was my boss, and I was embarrassed for even recommending that we eat here. I decided to boycott the restaurant after this and to not return until Zuni lost over $3,000 of my business. \n\nFinally, a third incident today is what prompted me to speak to Mr. Pilgram directly. The incident happened as I was walking by the glass-walled restaurant, as I must do at least once per day (I walk straight down Market St. to do business downtown).  As I passed, I noticed that the same waiter from the second experience (David) and the host (Ren) were both there.  This \"David\" guy quickly drifted over to Ren, and David uttered something to him not realizing that one of the big glass-wall windows was open.  \"Your nemesis is walking by,\" and Ren turned around and glared at me, responding to David with a childish insult. \n\nThat was it. It was time that the co-owners of Zuni did something about this unprofessional and ridiculous conduct that erodes Zuni's image (and their bottom line). I immediately called the place and asked to speak with a general manager. Of course, the host was reluctant, so I had to specifically tell him that I want to speak with Mr. Pilgram or Ms. Rodgers NOW.  \n\nI spoke to Mr. Pilgram, mentioning the slew of bad experiences with Zuni staff. I also mentioned that it's unfortunate since I really enjoy the food. Mr. Pilgram impressed me. He was very attentive and listened to my whole complaint, after which he apologized and promised to rectify this mess. It was apparent to me that he has fielded many such complaints about his staff, and I bet he's sick of having to deal with such childish employees. But I ended the call thinking that Zuni may be able to redeem itself, however the atonement process will be a rather slow one.  \n\nOver the last 18 months, since my friends and I no longer give Zuni our business, and since I discourage everyone from sinking money into this place, the revenue that Zuni has lost has topped $8,000 at the very least, thanks to this staff conduct. It is unfortunate that Ren and David choose such a spunky and childish path while trying to move ahead in restaurant management. Their presence will taint any restaurant who hires them, until they learn to improve their character and take their careers more seriously. They can learn plenty of this from Mr. Pilgram. \n\nIt will now be interesting to see what everyone mentioned above does to resolve this blemish. So far, Ren and David are reacting just as I expected... like arrogant brats, which only makes everything worse for them. I have also received two offensive emails from their messed-up bipolar friend, Andrew L.  At this rate, the mess they created here will follow them wherever they go. Yes, through all this snot-rag behavior, they forgot just how small the world can be...\n \n* The preceding is my personal opinion, protected by California's anti-SLAPP statute, Code of Civil Procedure 425.1", "author": "Daniel C."}

I've been breezing through Zuni's doors since '94, and I've learned that even with the loveliest of the lovely, most popular-for-a-reason restaurants that are \"institutions\" in SF, you need to check your expectations at the door... especially when it comes to service.\n\nWith that said, we had a *really* nice server who gave us great suggestions and took good care of us... despite his apparent busy-ness which resulted in some lag-time in service here and there. Admittedly, in the past, I've had some pretty crappy service at Zuni, so our guy was super great!\n\nBut you don't go to Zuni for service. You go for the beautiful high-ceilings, the warm brick walls and natural lighting, the fine and elegant wine list, the fantastic open kitchen and standing-room-only bar, the pianist tickling the ivories. Fabulousness galore!\n\nYou *stay* at Zuni for the food. \n\nOh, and the bloody mary's, but that's for another time.\n\nCase in point, yesterday was my birthday, so a friend brought me in for a late afternoon glass of champagne... Being seduced by Zuni's ambiance (& the gorgeous bubbles!) I thought, why not stay for dinner! So after checking with the hosts to see about a table (something fabulous, please!), then confirming with the BF that it was okay with him (he reminded me that it *was* my b-day, so of course!), dinner was on.\n\nOur table was cozy and by a window at the top of the stairs. Just as fabulous as I'd requested, plus perfect for, um, you know, sharing food. (Among other things *wink*)\n\nWe started with a dozen freshly-shucked oysters (and some little periwinkle-snail things that, unless they're drowning in butter and garlic, I ain't eatin' 'em!). The miyagi's were by far the best, though all were amazing!\n\nFor the next course, we opted for a simple spaghetti with butter, lemon zest, crushed red peppers, and a green that could have been either from the onion family, or the kelp family. *shrug* I don't know, but whatever it was, it was delicious... the pasta perfectly al dente, and they were kind enough to spit the dish for us. \n\nAs for the entree, we ordered the chicken. So, I've been making that \"Zuni chicken\" forever, but have never actually had it there. Be sure to order it as soon as you know you want it, as it takes an hour to roast... and is completely well-worth it!\n\nSucculent roasted chicken (my favorite comfort food!) a-top a bread salad of red-leaf lettuce (or was it a baby romaine?) with big chunks of crunchy bread, tossed in a red-wine vinaigrette with toasted pine nuts and currants. A whole chicken. Roasted to perfection. For two!\n\nThere were no left overs. We were stuffed and opted out on dessert... boy! were we happy! A perfect way to spend my birthday with my favorite fella, eating my favorite food!\n\nYesterday was definitely proof that you go to Zuni for _____ (insert something fabulous) but you stay for the food.", "author": "Tiffinie T."}

I ordered my burger MR and it looked a bit overcooked to me but when I bit into it it was moist and juicy and perfectly seasoned.  The homemade focaccia buns were fantastic as well.

Unlike said man (and I use that term loosely), Zuni manages to consistently be all of those things and more. The other main difference between Zuni and the jerk is that while both claim to offer delicious food fresh from their kitchens, only Zuni actually comes through (stick with the burger and the caesar salad if you're not sure what to get). Also, Zuni won't talk about other girls it wants to bang while you're having dinner and once you make a reservation at Zuni, Zuni won't cancel on you OVER and OVER again only to come crawling back for YEARS ON END. Oh! And Zuni doesn't fib or tell you lies because \"it sounded good at the time\". What you see is what you get (yet another marked difference between Zuni and jerk).\n\nSo yeah, try Zuni.

Um ok this place is empty downstairs and empty upstairs, yet we still wait 15 minutes for a table. Ok fine. We are seated on a  cushioned bench and hard wooden chairs. I would have loved a back to my seat during dinner but I gave the chairs with backs to my parents and grandparents, while I took the cushioned bench.\n\nWe are given paper menu's and we see that there are only four entrees on the menu. We are then told that this is the \"late lunch\" menu and the dinner menu doesn't start until 6. We ask for a copy of the dinner menu seeing that it is already 5:40pm and by the time we get our food it will be 6. Their response is that it isn't printed yet. \n\nWhadafuxup with that. Ok whatever.\n\nThe waittress comes to our table with no hospitality whatsoever. We get bread and butter with no individual plates to put the bread on. I guess we'll eat off the butcher paper you have over the tablecloth? She then takes our drink order and returns 5 minutes later for our \"late lunch order\" without our drinks. So we order our food: 4 burgers, pork chops and my grandfather got polenta. He asked for marinara sauce on his polenta and the waittress gives him a hard time. He's an 80 year old WWII and he wants some marinara sauce on his polenta and she says that she can't do it? You guys make pizza with marinara sauce, why can't you put a scoop of sauce on top of his polenta? That made me upset that they couldn't alter their \"sacred paper menus\" for my grandfather's simple request.  \n\nAnyways after our order we get our drinks and our food comes. The burger's were ok except for the fact that my father and I ordered ours medium and they came well done. If your cooks can't cook a burger correctly, why are they in the kitchen? My grandfather's polenta did come with a scoop of marinara sauce on top, which is the sole reason for the one star (other than the fact that you can't give 0 stars on yelp).

I can cook a hamburger at my house. I can also make polenta and pork chops. I go out to eat for the service, experience and ambiance. Zuni lacked all of this. I expected much more than I received. I will not pay to go to Zuni again. This was the worst experience I ever had in a restaurant, I've had worse food before but overall I was uncomfortable and couldn't wait to get out of the restaurant.\n\nAlso I was amazed by the amount of people that worked there.

The bread salad with pine nuts and currants that accompanied it was inspiring, I am going to make my own version at home.  The polenta was good, although they skimped on the cheese.  The oysters were amazing and fresh.  The cocktails were tasty but small considering they were $10 each and mostly ice.  Eff you, bartender.  I can get 3 times the booze for $10 at Martunis up the street!\n\nFood:    I spent a lot of money on simple rustic food that would have cost me far less to make at home.    Unfortunately, although I can't complain about the food, I feel that the cost isn't justified.   $41 for a small roasted chicken!    Ok, maybe I'm just cheap.  But for $41, I want that chicken stuffed with an octopus and truffles and gold or something.  \n\nDrinks:  Good, but if you are on a budget I would suggest skipping the skimpy drinks and splurge on a nice wine or raw oysters instead.\n\nService:  I had great friendly and efficient service!  Love that we were able to be seated without reservations.  The person who served us last friday night was Evyn.  She rocked.\n\nAmbience:  Try to get a seat facing the kitchen if you are at all interested in how your food is prepared.  It's fascinating and gives you and your date something to talk about.", "author": "Courtney Y."}

There is no reason you should waste your time or money at a place like this in a town with so many good restaurants. One of those places that thinks its soooo much more special than it is. An hour wait for a table when we had a reservation and we watched it \"being set up\" for 45 minutes. The waiter just reiterated the menu, the entire menu, when we asked him for what was good. Food was mediocre. If u screw up polenta u have real problems. The 1-hour chicken for 2 was good, nothing to justify the hype. A group of 5 and not one of us liked this place.

After being seated, the waiter came by asking us if we wanted wine and gave us some suggestions based on what type of wine we liked.  A few minutes later, the server (not the waiter) brought us some bread. I asked the server for some balsamic vinegar. Before I was able to finish my sentence, he quickly turned around and walked away.  Personally, I thought he had an attitude or some \"air\" about him.  My partner thought he had a language barrier, and didn't understand my request. If someone truly didn't understand a customer's request, he should ask the customer to repeat the request, and most certainly should not walk away.  We noticed that the server was walking around the restaurant helping others, and not returning to our table. We assumed he forgot about us.  Eventually, the waiter brought us some vinegar.\n\nThe food itself was just ok. I ordered the fennel sausage and polenta entree, which was small in portion and not nearly hot enough.  My partner and friend thought their food was just average as well.  After our food came, the waiter barely came back to our table to check in or to see if we needed anything else.  Coincidentally, my friend knew the people sitting at the table next to us. After dinner, we all chatted and agreed that the food was average and service was poor.  In fact, one of them had the same dish I ordered, and felt the same way.  We also felt the menu was very limited.\n\nBased on a good experience I had when I last came a few years ago, I feel this restaurant has gone downhil.  For the price that this restaurant charges, I expected much more in terms of food quality and level of service.  I am more than happy to pay higher prices that warrant it, and this is certainly not the case with Zuni.", "author": "E H."}

My go to meal which has yet to disappoint starts with oysters (always a fresh selection), caesar salad, and then the chicken. Be prepared because the love that goes into making this chicken delicious takes an hour...but is well worth the wait.

That, in hindsight, would have been quicker. We received our drinks and oysters timely, but that was it.  After we finished our oysters. we waited a half hour for our salad and water refills. At this point, we were there for an hour and 20 minutes.

They have joined the group of restaurants that has tacked on a 4% fee to cover restaurant worker health care.  This is disclosed in an italic font in the middle of the menu, probably so you will skip over it.\n\nI believe employers should provide health care for their full time staff but it's absurd that a restaurant of that nature would do that.  They should just raise their prices 20 cents if they can't afford to pay into the health care fund.  \n\nThink about it.  The customer pays for their food and at a restaurant like that you tip 18%-20%, which attracts people to work there.  So the employer can  get by paying min wage or slightly higher.  Then they tack on another 4% to the customer because they don't want to pay health care expenses?

The waiter knew all the menu items and was able to explain all the ingredients in the dish. \n\nWe started off with the cesar salad and polenta. The Zuni cesar salad was delish! They really do use fresh greens. The polenta was a tad disappointing because it could be creamier. Of course we ordered the chicken because it's at the top of the SF's 7x7 list.  However, I didn't think the chicken was anything special compared to other restaurants. The meat was very tender/juicy and the crispy skin added an extra kick. The bread salad totally saves the dish. Pieces of bread were soaked with all the oils and juices from the chicken, which makes it extra tasty. I think the chicken is worth trying, but not a major incentive to come back for. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Piccola meringata. The dessert was layered with creme and huckleberry sauce.

I figured that the $48 and hour long wait for it would be worth every last dollar, but yelpers you gave me chicken blue balls!  \n\nTo me the chicken was a glorified Safeway rotisserie chicken atop an amazing bread salad.  Definitely I find that the yelp reviews overrate the chicken and underrate the bread salad.  \n\nWhile waiting, we had the caesar salad which I highly recommend if just for the croutons.  We also had the shoestring potatoes which at $6 are the best value on the menu.  The all ricotta gnocchi were quite different and delicious as an appetizer. \n\nThey will charge you $1.50 for the aged balsamic if you ask for it with your bread.  If people are buying your chicken for $50 do you really need to charge them a buck fifty for balsamic vinegar????  \n\nI am glad I experienced Zuni but I don't think I will go back....next to see how the chicken at Il Pollaio compares...I hope the price tag doesn't!", "author": "Christina F."}

First go: medium-rare request arrives sad and gray.  New one brought: even grayer than the first.   At this point Little Bro requests it removed from the bill and we leave.  But not before the manager challenges his burger doneness specifications: \"I'm sorry sir, but we're confused on your definition of medium-rare.  This (holds dry, deathly-pallored burger up to light) is medium-rare to us.\"\n\nThat's when I had to put the smack down and tell him I've eaten a half-dozen Zuni burgers and they've never looked like that.  He shuts up, scurries away, and returns with the profuse apologies that they have a new grill cook (who is clearly not up to par - surely he was responsible for my similarly cooked-to-death pork chop) that's learning the ropes.   Little Bro tacks a big tip on to my miserly mom's 10% (yes, there are people who really do tip that low), because it wasn't the waiter's fault, and we exit.  I'm just sorry he had to go hungry.\n\nSo why, pray tell, the four stars?  Because the other dozen or so other times I've eaten here have been excellent (yes, I know that's a lot of Zuni-ing in only a year and a half of living here, but it was a somewhat regular brunch place for me and the ex-pseudo-bf).   It's one of those restaurants where I'm incredibly comfortable, where I know the food will be clean and interesting and exquisitely seasonal (and up until this point, reliably well-executed), and it's timeless.  I love walking in and sitting at the odd corner bar table in between the windows and surveying the now-classic space.   I like the crowd, the energy, everything.\n\nSo maybe choosing a 3:30pm lunch time during that odd week between Christmas and New Years was a bad move.  Maybe it wasn't the right place for Mom, who is all about value (\"$12 for a tiny salad I can make at home?\") and options (\"This is the whole menu?  What if I don't want any of this?\").   Next time, Mom, Cheesecake Factory for you.\n\nAnd I'd like to hope that next time, that grill cook will be trained and my burger will arrive pleasantly pink.

Maybe when it is slowly cooked in a brick oven and sitting on a bed of bread salad with pine nuts. I had been waiting a month or two to finally come to Zuni. Make no mistake, it gets crowded, so make a reservation at least a week or two before. I came here with my friend and her visiting sister and we had a blast! We sipped on chartreuse champagne cocktails and shared the roast chicken and the spaghetti dish. The spaghetti dish is not a normal red sauce dish, but spaghetti with a very light sauce with nettles, pancetta, and a sprinkle of cheese. But, onto the piece d' resistance--the roast chicken! It was DIVINE. Sure, the roast chicken isn't the most complicated dish, but the pairing with the bread salad made it extra special. You have to just try it yourself. Just think of a roast chicken you buy at Costco, 1000x better, with little bites of tangy bread salad.\n\nThe atmosphere is lively, yet sophisticated in its own way.

A San Francisco staple that I have longed wanted to try. With family in tow, what better excuse to sample good food than to have it expensed on the parents. (What? We all do it don't we?)\n\nThe place is much larger inside then what you can see of the place from Market Street. The main floor is an open plan that ties the bar, first floor dining area and display kitchen together. The upstairs is compartmentalized into a labyrinth like layout which was unique to say the least. The storefront window / liquor display wall of the bar was probably the most appealing part of the whole joint and I wish we were sat in this area (or at least the mezzanine area overlooking the bar) rather then the rabbit hole in the back. \n\nSo while I enjoyed the meal and have heard a ton about Zuni, I must admit there were a few snags to the meal; most of which can be chalked up to a first timers experience to the menu and can probably be avoided in the next round. \n\n1. The chicken IS good. Flavorful and savory. It also takes an hour to cook so be prepared to a.) order it as soon as you sit at your table and b.) wait. After devouring the meal, I asked if you could pre-order the chicken before being seated to avoid the long wait but apparently that's not an option. Sorry folks, you want chicken you gotta pay your dues I guess. As advertised, it does serve 2 (and probably more) but doesn't come with much except a bread pudding sort of thing under the chicken. Go for extra sides / dishes to split for the entire table so you get some sort of variety.\n\n2. The place is busy and it took a good few minutes to even hear from our server which unfortunately affects #1. \n\n3. The ceasar salad was delicious.\n\n3. I believe the menu rotates daily with basically the chicken holding it down consistently. There wasn't much on our menu that day that struck my fancy but maybe that's because I was dead set on the chicken. \n\n4. The Gataeu Victoire is a very rich flourless chocolate cake.

My wife and I had a range of their food, from the cocktails to appetizers, soups, and entrees, and must say it all was excellent.

However, we seemed to be there a *lot* longer than 45 minutes, and consumed several of the delicious margaritas.\n\nWe eventually got seated (upstairs, in a little nook in the surprisingly big back area, to my disappointment -- I had been hoping for one of the more stylish tables in the main downstairs area at the tall windows.) There's a real buzz of fun and a convivial party feel in the place on a Friday (probably helped by the generous way they ply the alcohol!) Sure enough, our waiter soon tempted us into getting a bottle of the Zuni-labeled Pinot Noir to go with our Caesar Salad and gnocchi appetizers. The wine and the appetizers were very good (and essential - we had a one-hour wait ahead of us while the famous Zuni roast chicken was being prepared for us.)\n\nThe chicken was very flavorful and tasty, if a little monotonous.

Maybe I'm not used to that taste bc other diners slurped that shit up, but I wanted to spit it out.

My rating is only on the quality of food (b/c the service was just fine), but I was definitely disappointed.  I read rave reviews of the Caesar salad and pastas, so I thought I'd try both.  The Caesar salad was totally eh, and the pasta was nothing to be desired.  My friend got a pizza, and the dough tasted like a Boboli with some tomato sauce spread across the top.  I'm a total foodie and am pretty open-minded to new places, but I doubt I'll ever go back to Zuni again.  \n\nThe Caesar salad was about 6 leafs of romaine lettuce with a tiny bit of mediocre caesar dressing (very strong anchovy taste) spread across the leafs, some sprinkles of Parmesan cheese, and 4 croutons.  Granted, the croutons were good because they were baked fresh with their bread.  In addition, I got their pasta with butter sauce, broccoli, & mushrooms.  No flavor, the mushrooms tasted like paper, and the butter was just too much.  My chin was greasy from the thing and I'm a pretty polite eater.  \n\nIdk....I think there are other places with much, much better food for half the price.

Everything was great; food, service, seating etc.  Had the most insane Hanger Steak on the menu that was mouth watering.  Yum.  I'll be back.\r\n\r\nAfter reading some not so great reviews, I feel I need to jump in here for a moment.  \r\n\r\nI have blacklisted Zuni so many times b/c the attitude at times is comical.  You think, \"Did they just roll their eyes at me?  We're not even in Paris!\".  I totally get what everyone is saying.  That said, I have a love/hate relationship with the place.  First of all, to those of you loving that Zuni chicken salad, go out and  buy the cookbook.  I've had the salad many times made at home and it's great and people love it when you invite them over for dinner.  The short ribs and Chimay recipe is also great to make at home and easy...(it seemed easy but I guess my ex would know better since he was the chef, and an excellent one at that, good job Jeff!)...anyway...\r\n\r\nZuni is NOT the place to go for dinner b/c it's always crazy and too busy and when it's crazy and too busy, the staff get agro (agro=eye-rolling and attitude).  Nobody likes agro when they're about to drop $100 on dinner.  At least not me.  \r\n\r\nZuni has great ambiance and some good items on the menu.  A good time to go is off hours.  I have had many great experiences there when I go for a later afternoon lunch after the rush.  Or, on a Saturday, get started early and be the first to show up.  I'm talking right when they open.  Sure it's not the see and be scene place that it is around 8pm but you can go someplace post nosh for that.  \r\n\r\nJust so it's not ridiculously expensive, share some wine and some apps instead of having a full meal.  Like I said, many of the recipes there are also in the cookbook and can be made at home.\r\n\r\nAll I'm saying is that yes, Zuni can be a pain in the bum sometimes.

Through the succession of well dressed crowds flooding its doors, Zuni became a beacon of insatiable wonder.  \n\nLooking back, I'm sure we both know our avoidance of Zuni was silly, even childish.  I remember all of the places that carry sentiment of  time and place for me: Chinatown's courtyard full of old chess and backgammon players evokes a sense of discovery and wonder every time I stumble into it;  the Buena Vista for the pink sunsets that slink quietly down into the pacific and the taste of hot Irish coffee.  \n\nAnyway, I digress.

There were some amazing standout dishes -- the fresh oysters in the plateau de mer, and a glorious small-plate dish of halibut cheeks -- but there were at least as many downright clunkers, including an inedibly bad coconut cake and a pair of pork chops: one a lovely medium-rare but served on a stone-cold plate with (unintentionally) room-temperature sides, the other overdone to a tough, dry mess. Even dishes that I have enjoyed in the past weren't anything to write home about: The bite I had of Squeat's pasta carbonara was really average, and the mushroom soup was lackluster -- and I normally adore the soups at Zuni.\n\nSo, mea culpa to anyone whose opinion I have questioned in the past: I now totally understand how you could see Zuni as an overrated, boring, has-been of a restaurant. I'm just glad it wasn't my first visit, or it certainly would have been my last.\n\n----\n\nWe had dinner at Zuni for the first time recently -- a long standing joke in our house, as we've lived in SF, off and on, for nigh on 15 years -- and we loved it. We bought a copy of the cookbook about 3 years ago when we left SF for Seattle, and have enjoyed cooking out of it regularly.\n\nEverything we ate was good, some of it was even great, but the highlight of the evening (and this is coming from me, a non-dessert fan) was a caramel pot de creme that was sooooo super-caramelized. My husband had a dozen oysters, I started with an amazing carrot soup that highlighted the garden-grown taste of the vegetables and made me glad I had skipped the salad I was toying with ordering. My entree has slipped my mind -- which is just as well, as I it didn't wow me -- but my husband had an amazing fish braised in a cazuela. \n\nService was gracious but not quite as attentive as we might have liked, due to 2 adjacent parties of 6+ with small children. We loved the atmosphere of the balcony; we were in the front one, closest to the bar and the host stand. \n\nIn short, it was the kind of place that we could see ourselves making the effort to become regulars at, even if that meant making a reservation. It's the sort of place we'd love to just drop into casually, if such a thing were ever possible.", "author": "anita c."}

Great, bustling atmosphere, fantastic service, and the food...can I say amazing?\n\nWe started with a dozen oysters, which were extremely fresh and really buttery. They were out of kumamoto oysters, but our kick ass server was able to suggest something that was just as good, if not better. She also suggested a fantastic (albeit expensive) Chardonnay. Worth every penny.\n\nFor those of you who gave Zuni anything less than four or five stars, go back, and try the chicken for two. That alone should change your mind on Zuni. Best chicken I've EVER had...I make roast chicken all the time, and I suddenly feel ashamed for what I'm putting on the table.\n\nWe finished with a lovely lemon tart...the crust was perfect.

I'm a HUGE fan of a good burger, so that really go my attention.  Unfortunately, I didn't have the money for that kind of food.\n\nA few years later, I read an article about Zuni's \"perfect\" roast chicken. I am also a HUGE fan of roasted chiecken.  I still didn't have any money.\n\nA few more years passed and I read about their stellar caesar salad. As I'm sure you can guess, I'm a HUGE fan of a caesar salad.  Unfortunately, I heard that their service was snooty.  I can't stand snooty service.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I decided it was time to finally head out to Zuni - to unravel the mystery and eat some of this perfect food.  I didn't have the burger or the chicken.  I had a special appetizer highlighting fresh pressed olive oil, the truly perfect caesar, ricotta gnocchi and the hanger steak.  The food lived up to the hype and the service was AMAZING.  It can't be easy to run such a tight ship in that warren of little rooms, but the do an outstanding job.

The lighting comes through on all floors of this eclectically shaped restaurant, and the white wide windows and white tables/walls make the place seem very light and airy, despite the seemingly haphazard seating as this place is more tall than wide. There is a large bar downstairs as well, for those just wanting to enjoy a break.\n\nOur table of three showed up today around 5 or so and were seated right away, no need to wait. We immediately ordered the roast chicken so that the hour wait would fly by. Our table ordered bloody marys and they were unique - diced onions and peppers in the drink itself! Don't see that very often!\n\nNext, we ordered Hog Island Kumamoto oysters, the shoestring fries (in honor of Adam Savage, who supposedly likes the fries here), the lamb shoulder, and the caesar salad. The salad was alright, nothing special. Oysters were fresh and as expected. The shoestring fries were great - a mountain of fries with just the right amount of salt. The lamb shoulder was tender and fell apart and came with deliciously cooked cauliflower and some sort of green mush that was probably beans at some point. \n\nNow, the chicken - the leg was super tender and the flavor of the skin rich. But even more than the chicken, I LOVED the bread salad - think of thick chunks of the inside of breads, covered in balsamic and oil and cooked/baked to perfection. Ahh. I will continue to dream of this bread salad.\n\nLoved the experience, I can see why it's a top restaurant.", "author": "Katherine P."}

Why can't I order one, too?\"  Computer says \"no.\"\n\nSo, instead, I ordered the beef with root vegetables for $31.  When it came, I thought it was an appetizer.

If I am going to watch a movie, I am going to do that at a movie theatre or curled up on my own sofa with sweats or pjs on.  \n\nSo, I parted ways with my friends and meandered toward Van Ness, along Market Street, and came upon Zuni.  I haven't been there in about 6 months so I decided I would go in and have a little bite and see what the evening had in store for food and maybe some interesting people.  \n\nThe hosts' at the door were super friendly and very helpful.  I would say Rob was the shining personality of the evening of all the staff I encountered.  He was just super real.  He didn't seem to have to try hard to be helpful - he just was.  He suggested I sit in the dining room even though I was alone because there might be more to watch since the bar was pretty slow.  He was right.  (And when I left he made sure to wish me a great evening).\n\nThe dining room proved to be the perfect spot.  After a few minutes two gentlemen were seated at a table very close - Ken and Lawrence - Graphic artist and writer.  Lawrence was the more gregarious of the two, yet Ken was still very friendly as well.   They were a couple of really nice guys that made dinner much more enjoyable.  It's always nice to have a little company for dinner.  But when you don't, try being friendly to the people around you.  You just might meet some nice interesting people.  \n\nI was really hoping that tonight Zuni's would have something that would just kick my taste buds ass.  I had some oysters (Discovery Bay), a little green salad and the lamb.  The oysters were good and fresh.  Everything was prepared well and tasted good.  Unfortunately, my taste buds were so ready for a taste sensation that just didn't occur.  It was good!!!  Good in the way that you would expect it should be for the amount of money you are spending.

Ok, so maybe $48 for  of a roasted chicken is a bit steep, but this chicken is one of the most spectacular roasted chickens I've ever had at a restaurant.   My cousin and I split it, but I'm pretty sure I could also easily be split between 3 people.  It was so juicy and tender...and I roast a lot of chickens and know it's hard to keep the white meat tneder; you barely even had to use your knife!  The bread salad was kind of hidden underneath the chicken, but that was definitely fine with me.  Those moist, delicious, delicate pieces of bread tasted soooo yummy, they must have been baking inside the chicken while soaking up all the juices and flavor.  I'm still not sure it was worth $48 though, when I know a 3-4 lb chicken at Safeway costs less than $10.  \n\nWe started off with 12 oysters from 3 different regions and our other diner ordered the quail, which was quite good!  The timing with the quail and chicken was a bit off, but our server profusely apologized and gave us free risotto while we waited and free dessert at the finish of our meal, so that definitely made up for it.  \n\nIn general, the ambiance and service was great!

Went on a weekday evening around 10pm and got a table for two with less than a ten minute wait. We sat upstairs- warm and charming interior- romantic without being overly formal or stuffy. \n\nOur server was friendly and helpful. The wine was tasty and went well with our entree- the chicken of course. The ceasar salad to start was the best Caesar I have ever had- crispy and perfectly dressed.  Gnocchi puffs were heavenly and the chicken still makes me drool just thinking about it. \n\nIf you want a nice meal in the city, this is one of the best out there.

I recently had dinner here and enjoyed a truly excellent meal.\n\nWe went all out and ordered the items that Zuni is famous for: the bloody mary, Caesar salad, shoe string french fries, and the Zuni roast chicken with bread salad. \n\nThe bloody mary was bloody delicious. The flavor was so fresh, spicy, and flavorful. I enjoyed it immensely. My fiance was a little put off by the minced red onion in the drink but I loved this drink. \n\nThe Caesar salad was fantastic. The dressing was very good, the romaine lettuce fresh, the croutons crunchy and tasty. \n\nThe shoe string potatoes were like crack: we couldn't stop eating them! The fries are very thin and crispy. \n\nThe roast chicken...my god the roast chicken...Incredibly delectable. The chicken is so moist and juicy, perfectly roasted. The bread salad complements it very nicely and the bread chunks soak up the delicious dressing and chicken juices. The pine nuts and currants are surprisingly mild in flavor. This is probably the best roast chicken I've ever eaten. It truly lived up to its hype and was absolutely worth the one hour wait.\n\nThough we were thoroughly stuffed, we had to try a dessert and ordered the caramel pot de creme. This dessert was richly flavored but not too heavy. Loved it.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual and lively. The service was friendly and efficient.\n\nFantastic!", "author": "Jenny K."}

I've had roast chicken from Costco that was pretty good for $12.  But the roast chicken from Zuni is THAT GOOD.  My wife who normally considers eating chicken breast akin to eating glass shards happily devoured a piece of breast.  The grilled bread was great too.  We also liked the ricotta gnocchi: soft and flavorful.  The shoestring fries was super yummy and I couldn't help myself from eating a fry every 20 seconds.  We had a party of 3 and ordered the anchovies, gnocchi, fries and roast chicken.  That was definitely enough food! \n\nOne note: we knew we HAD to try the roast chicken and it's an hour wait, so we called ahead to see if we could \"preorder\" it.  The girl laughed uncontrollably.

But I would not rate it a 4 star even at its best in recent years.\n\nLast week, our party had the usual Caesar Salad, which was good but not outstanding. We've had better-at less pricey establishments. For the entrees, the steak was tough, although prepared as we ordered, medium rare. The tuna was fishy.

People write a lot about the chicken, and anything hyped too much makes it hard to live up to expectations, but personally it is one of those dishes in SF that I actually remember and want to have again and makes me go back. That said, if the restaurant were otherwise bad, this wouldn't be enough to make me go back. But, every time we've been here the service has been great, attentive, and we've had a great time. This is a place that my wife and I love to go to later in the evening when other restaurants are closed (after 9) and we want a fun dinner. Also, at that time, it is easier to get in and is more relaxed. There's also a wine bar down the street that's nice to go to if you have to wait for your table. \n\nHonestly, this is one of my all-around favorite restaurants in SF and I've probably been to a few hundred at this point after living here a while.

I've loved Zuni for the wood-burning oven, the zinc bar and the food, of course, since my first visit a few years back. Praise of the roast chicken is a clich\u00e9 but I can say with certainty that this dish will be my last meal if I ever have to leave SF. My girlfriend feels the same way. Good thing the chicken comes for two. \n\nMy second favorite tradition at Zuni is going for the famous Zuni burger just a shade after 10pm on Sunday nights. I make my ritual journey for the burger this late because the burger is only served after 10pm and at brunch. \n\nThe Zuni burger is made with chuck that is salt cured and chilled for 24 hours to retain juiciness. I've yet to have another burger as juicy. My hat goes off to Judy Rodgers for making such a commanding burger pop with the use of the simplest seasoning, salt. The focaccia bun sops up the juices from the burger well and the pickled onions are a masterful touch. One of the true pleasures in life is this morsel of meat.\n\nThe polenta, Caesar salad, oysters and shoestring fries are also good fare. I almost always opt to finish my meal with the pot de creme. \n\nIf you'd like to experience the best classic California dining SF has to offer, Zuni is the way to go.", "author": "Adam L."}

But tonight I ventured OUTSIDE of the Mission with my fabulous life partner and our fabulous friends from Austin, Texas, and we went to Zuni Cafe.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, it was good SF energy all over.  A fabulous bar, with my favorite Vodka (Hangar One), and a surprisingly friendly hostess who was more than ok with things when our friends were a bit late...even though they were clearly busy.\n\nIt got even BETTER when we got to our table, which was in a fantastic private room that I didn't even know existed (how lucky were we???)\n\nThe SERVICE was AMAZING...friendly, down-to-earth, and yet professional... Christopher, with his fabulous sense of humor and his equally fabulous and sharp tie are hard to beat, even in this town, and even with a Range fanatic....! Truly fabulous! Great food recommendations, great timing, and he just seemed to know what we needed and when we needed it, right down to our San Pelligrino H2O moments (yes, silly  and perhaps pretentious to say, but TRUE, and you know it!)\n\nThe food was GREAT - we had the Skate (oh my god - have you ever had SKATE before?) We also had the famous Caesar of course, and these amazing gnocchi and fava beans that I can't even begin to describe (you just had to be there...)\n\nThe wine was SO reasonably priced and so yummy...Roche Carneros Pinot...and what a value. It was so reasonably priced we were almost afraid to order it, but  when it arrived we were MORE than seriously pleasantly surprised...it was fantastic!  So fantastic that we ordered a second bottle... that good...really!\n\nDesserts were fun (we highly recommend going with Christopher's excellent recommendation of the Espresso Granita- wow!), but our favorite part of the entire evening was when Christopher spent a few minutes at our table and shared a bit about his story and how he arrived in San Francisco. It is these moments that make us PROUD to be SF residents, and THRILLED to be in a fabulous and classy restaurant where being human actually still matters!\n\nSo - to sum it all up... we HIGHLY recommend Zuni Cafe, and if you are lucky enough to get a reservation, we hope you are able to at least meet FANTASTIC Christopher, and if you are EXTREMELY lucky, you might get to be his customers.\n\nWe loved every minute of it and can't wait to go back! And we're asking for Christopher to be our server and hoping they don't mind!!   If we were Michael Bauer, we'd give it 4 stars... if we were Michelin, I think it would be 5 stars, but we're just two lesbians from the Mission (who've been together for close to 10 years and been to more SF restaurants than we can count) and for that, we give it 2 thumbs up, and then some!!

Zuni's winning formula of ambiance, food, wine and service, all adds up to an enjoyable evening from start to finish.  Dinner for two around $150.  Go back?  Surely.\n\nPlace: This is probably one of the first light-industrial-zone-turned-restaurants in SF, and it has weathered surprisingly well.  The big glass windows face Market St., now more interesting since the return of the retro streetcars; the exposed brick, the copper-topped bar, the fantastic floral arrangement -- now a classic look.  Despite the high ceilings, the warren of \"rooms\" feels intimate, although the place tends to buzz quite loudly.  It's always interesting watching the comings and goings of the casual but well-monied crowd (although I must mention that for anyone sitting on the backless benches to beware of wearing low-cut jeans unless you want to reveal your plumber's behind to the world).\n\nFood: Obviously the secret to the long running success is a simple menu, excellent ingredients, expert execution and beautiful presentation.  Although we didn't have time to wait for the famous brick-oven chicken (takes 1 hour to prepare), we did enjoy the renowned caesar salad -- the best in town! with perfectly crisp leaves and balanced dressing -- and the prosciutto, so flavorful but a little strange with the accompanying fresh ricotta .  For entrees, the halibut was perfectly prepared, firm and moist, and the white fish was artfully paired with spring green peeled asparagus and yellow fingerling potatoes; the Liberty Farm duck was tender and earthy, accompanied by fresh gigante beans.  The Victoire cake was a dense, dry concoction of intense cocoa, moistened by freshly whipped cream.  Even the house coffee was good.\n\nWine:  I recall perhaps having my first bottle of Veuve Clicquot here way back when...  They still serve the bubbly, along with a decent but pricey wine list.  After starting with flutes of champagne -- it always seems like the right starter at Zuni (especially if you order oysters on the half shell) -- we moved on to glasses of wine recommended by the waiter.   \n\nService:  On this recent visit, service was nice, perhaps due to our earlier reservation (6:30 pm) ahead of the crush of prime time.  The reception was pleasant, a nice change from previously experienced snooty factor.  Our waiter and servers were low-keyed and efficient -- just the way they should be.  And, yes, that 4% additional \"tax\" for employee healthcare -- annoying but I guess it's the price to pay to live and work in this fantastic (albeit expensive) town.", "author": "Yan L."}

Fortunately, we had the option to sit in the cafe area near the bar without having to wait 45 minutes for a dining area table. It was a bit chilly by the door, a little more informal and not the ideal spot to bring a first date, but I wasn't on a first date and I was hungry. The best part about sitting here is that the wait staff is always easy to flag down (so to speak). Overall, the restaurant is clean, personable, and nicely lit.\n\nService: Great, quick, not snooty at all, but that always depends on your server I guess. They were attentive, and made it a point to clear table of empty plates and unused silverware. The waiter was not afraid to give his honest opinion when asked, which I always appreciate. In fact, their service was ahead of me sometimes, which isn't a bad thing.\n\nFood: The Monterey Sardine with the citrus salad was great to start out with. The fries were really stringy and delicious. A bit greasy for my liking though. My fiance and I shared the famous chicken and were thoroughly pleased with it. It had amazing flavor in the skin and perfect crispiness. The meat was tender and moist within. It almost tasted like a great fried chicken, but clearly was not.

This place is in a terrible area (we made the mistake of walking east on Market Street to get there), but the restaurant itself is goregous. Two stories of open windows, really nice setting on a sunny warm day. The staff was attentive, and I loved my prosecco with elderflower cocktail. However, for lunch I had the pizza with ricotta salada, which was really just a crust, tomato sauce, and a spinkling of ricotta cheese, like a giant thin pizza bagel.

They were tasty, but not particularly filling and, to my mind, not worth the $11 and $13 price tags.  My friend's burger was not bad, according to him.  The burger cost $15 and didn't have a side to accompany.  For me, there was clearly a value issue at Zuni.  I'm okay with $13 pizza or a $15 burger, so long as it excels.  These dishes didn't.\n\nFurthermore, we waited an hour for a burger and two pizzas.  To add a wee bit of insult to injury, we were obviously sitting next to some \"friend of the restaurant\", because multiple servers swung by to make small talk with them (as we patiently waited for our food).  By the time our food had arrived, tables on both sides, seated after us, were well into their meals.\n\nZuni isn't a disaster, but with so many better choices in SF, I certainly won't be recommending to anyone.", "author": "Trick C."}

First, the restaurant is beautiful. It's like eating in a really nice treehouse. Some guy told me that he and his wife's first date was at Zuni Cafe. I was jealous--that's how beautiful the restaurant is.\n\nThe food is expensive. It's best to eat there on someone else's tab. A law firm paid for my first meal there so I could sit back and enjoy. The second time I ate there, I paid for my dining companion expecting that he'd pay me back later. That bastard still owes me $75. My second Zuni experience was not as pleasant as my first.\n\nIf you think of broad swaths of the SF dining scene as a bunch of replicants of Chez Panisse with tiny variations on the general theme, I think it's fair to say that Zuni (founded by Chez Panisse alums) do one of the best and most faithful jobs of that. I dined out three times a day for 2 months in SF, and it ended up amounting to eating much of the same food/flavor profiles/ideologies over and over. But doing it well makes it special and even memorable.", "author": "Ziggy Y."}

Being a big ol' family, we then split the gnocchi (exactly how they got them so fluffy boggles my mind to this very day), the spaghetti (ample portion, was great to split), and the fish (cooked to perfection).  I think we ordered some different entrees, but I can't remember because one of those was the chicken which was out of this world amazing.  W-o-w.  Definitely worth the wait, which didn't seem that long since we ordered the salads and the other items to split.  We also ordered wine, and a friend who was back in Rochester remotely ordered us a bottle of Prosecco to celebrate (apparently it wasn't a problem for her to phone in the request and pay over the phone).\n\nThe service was great.

While some people are looking for wisdom or enlightenment, I (admittedly as superficial as this sounds) am looking for the perfect Bloody Mary (which, as it turns out, is as hard to find as the perfect man... a completely different, long, sordid story). So when I read that Zuni is known for its Bloody, I had to make a trip down Market to see what the hype was about.\n\nFirst, though may I ask one random question? Why have a long, gorgeous, copper covered bar, with no bar stools? But that may be as esoteric a wondering why someone made \"Herbie Fully Loaded\" ... and likely it is best we never know. \n\nBack to the Bloody. So clearly what they bank on is the sweetness of Balsamic and the spice of finely chopped onion, with a touch of bell pepper. The Balsamic I thought was a bit cloying, for lack of a better word. And the onion? It took me about 3 days to sweat out that onion. If they are going to put that amount of straw clogging, East River (NYC reference) floaters in a drink, then they should serve it with a straw that does not collapse when it comes in contact with liquid (another musing that is just under my Herbie Fully Loaded cogitation). I'm sure the food is good at Zuni, and the fries looked great, but it may take me years of therapy to understand their Bloody Mary and their lack of bar stools.", "author": "Courtney P."}

Oh how disappointed I am at thee. \nYou have let me down so much, I feel robbed.\n\nSo we arrive at the restaurant promptly at about 7pm for our 7:15 reservation. We're told that it'll be about a half hour, great. Bolting towards the bar, I study the wine list and appetizer menu.Order a Redbull Vodka to perk me up... however the bartender hasn't ever heard of such a drink, never the less, serve it. So I order a Martini straight up, with a twist. Pick up the wine list, it's just fine... it's your average pretentious restaurant who likes to order a lot of well known labels both Bordeaux and Californian - and severely overpriced. But then a platter comes our way. Apparently the oyster/shellfish appetizer was ordered for me, so I indulge. It's fantastic.\n\n45 minutes later, we're escorted to our table and I embark on my gastronomic trials of Zuni. Staring with a Lobster Bisque that was more of a chowder than anything else, I hope for something better from a Ceasar Salad. The dressing was far too salty and had a funky tang to it that I wasn't prone to liking in the least. Third course. Hopefully this should be at least satisfactory. We order the Roasted Chicken Dinner for Two. Takes an hour. A full hour. And it's chicken... double you tee eff. \n\nAn hour later it arrives. Mind you after the waitress forgets to come back to refill our wine glasses not once, twice, but three times. The chicken was moist but had no flavor. Basically it tasted like they took a chicken breast, tossed it on the grill, took the skin off, then baked it for another 20 minutes... nothing special. The ambience is cool in Zuni though but definately not worth the $225 bill for two people. Definitely not.

We started off with crostini with roasted red peppers, onions and sausage, the caesar salad and the shoestring potatoes. All were pretty good but not amazing. The caesar didn't feel like it was fully dressed and it was off balance as well for me. Like the egg wasn't full incorporated and the anchovy was a  bit strong on a few bites.\n\nThe famed roast chicken however was divine. Be patient, it takes an hour if you order it but it's well worth the wait. The meat is succulent and flavorful and the bread salad is AMAZING. I couldn't get enough of it, the chicken comes tossed with the bread salad so the bread soaks up the yummy chicken juices and is tossed with currants and pine nuts, two of my favorite ingredients. I was in heaven. \n\nTo finish, we had a pie budino and an apple tart. The budino was more cakey than pudding but was still delish and came with super fresh peaches and a huckleberry sauce. The tarte was delicious and it came with a vanilla ice cream that was delicious. I'd heard they take great care with the ice cream and you could really tell.\n\nOverall a really great experience with stellar service. Beware the stairs though!

Now, is this chicken 8 times better than Costco chicken? What if I butchered a Costco chicken and put it on top of some bread salad? This is a tough call. I liked the chicken a lot and split between two at a high-end restaurant, $48 could be reasonable. But by your second glass of wine, it really doesn't matter that much anymore.

They have been doing the same thing for how long now -10, 20, 50 years, but it still works.\n\nI'm a big believer in find the best and stick with it.  While Zuni does a bunch of stuff well, they do a few things top notch, so I tend to eat the same meal over and over here.\n\nLunch is their fresh ground hamburger, house made katchup, and fries.  Just a taste sensation.\n\nDinner?  Well, after quaffing a few cocktails - their bar makes some great drinks including about as good a cosmo as you will find in the City - I wait to get seat. Even as I park my butt, I let out the magic words \"Well split a chicken.\"  It takes about 40 minutes for them to cook a chicken in their pizza oven, so an early order keeps the meal flowing as it should.\n\nAbout that chicken.  Holy Hens Batman!!!  It is simply the best roast chicken I have ever had.  After raising backyard chickens in the Castro for a few years we have largely moved away from commercially grown birds, in favor of more humane/organic.\n\nBut at Zuni, I dont'  inquire because I don't want to know.  Don't ask, don't tell, thats my policy, and I'm sticking to it.\n\nThe chickens come out juicy, salty, herbacious, crispy....mmmmm  There is also a tasty bread stuffign that must have a pound of butter roasted in, and God bless them I say.  It is also studded with currants or some other dried fruit.  Really great.\n\nSo, with the chicken pre-ordered and safely in its 500 degree temporary home, I usually order a dozen oysters (kummumoto if they are good) and  caesar salad (splitin half for two)  The oyster selection is great, if a tad pricy, and a great way to kick off the meal and finish off the cocktail we've usually taken to the table.  The caesar is just fab, with super-fresh speers of romaine, flecks of anchovies, shaved cheese and a light dressing.  An order splits well for two (they bring it on two plates) and leaves enough room for the bird.\n\nThe only remaining question is whether to order the shoestring potatoes which vary from nice to awesome.  I can't get a handle on why they are so much better sometimes than others. The downside of getting the fries is that you eat less of the great fresh bread and butter.  On the upside...the fries.\n\nAnyway, thats pretty much it.  cocktail, oysters, caesar, bird with dressing and maybe a glass of wine along the way. I can honestly say I've had this meal no fewer than 25 times, and if money and cholesteral were no issue I'd gladly eat it twice a month.", "author": "hOWARD y."}

LOL\n\n5 stars for the wait staff...\n0 stars for the brilliant idea to not serve the burger for dinner...\n\nI had heard such great things about their burger that on our way through town we decided to make a detour and stop in for a burger.  After being seated and asking to have the burger (I didn't even bother to look at the menu) we were informed that they don't serve the burger at dinner time otherwise the grill would be overwhelmed with orders.  They only serve it for lunch and after 10pm.  Seriously???  How have you guys stayed in business this long with this kind of thinking.\n\nWell Zuni, let me learn on you a bit of economics...it would be better to offer it, even if you have to charge more at dinner time (so that the grill doesn't get overwhelmed with too many orders), then to tell me I can't get one at all.  If you charge $15 at lunch go ahead and mark it up to $20 or $25 for dinner so only those that are really interested will buy it.  I would have gladly paid upwards of $30.  So, instead of having us stay and spend over $200 for food and drinks you allowed us to leave and go somewhere else...which we did...and ended up finding my favorite burger in town.  I guess I could have asked to talk to the manager and offered to pay double for the burger if they made it special for me (being that I am was just passing through and might not get another chance to try it for quite a while) but I shouldn't have to.  If you are going to make something that everyone raves about then figure out how to make it all the time.  Heck, you could offer it as sliders for appetizers and charge a bundle while still keeping the grill from getting too slammed.  \n\nI would like to say that I would come back to try yours but with the best burger in town being so close, more affordable, and them serving it whenever I want it I am going to have a hard time not visiting them again when we are in the neighborhood looking for lunch.  I like to try new burgers but when I know such a great one is so close I just can't see a good reason to pass them up.\n\nI do have to mention that the wait staff at Zuni was great and although shocked that we got up to leave when we found out there was no burger, they held no grudge towards us.  I felt they were so courteous that I left a tip even though we didn't eat or drink anything and were in fact freeing a much wanted table.", "author": "houston '."}

I can hardly remember what I had only because it was well over 6 years ago. \n\nWe came for the chicken and placed an order immediately upon being seated upstairs. Who in their right mind waits an hour for chicken? We did and when it finally arrived an hour later, it was not the chicken-gasmic experience we had hoped for. The only redeeming quality was that fact it was not salty which other reviews seems to indicate its tendency to be. It was plain chicken which costs $41 for two people. Yes, it feed the five (5) of us and left a few of us scratching our heads as to why we spent that much time and money on chicken for a lunchtime meal.  \n\nWhile waiting for our \"chicken\" course, we ordered a caesar salad, lamb lettuce with rabbit, and herb tomato soup which rounded out our appetizers. Oh yeah, one order of fine julienned fries to share which reminded me of the kind you get in the tin cans. \n\nThe food was good but wasn't quite worth the hype. However, our side entrees of sirloin burgers on focaccia were spot on. A little pricey but worth every penny. Try it with the Gruyere and onions.\n\nThe rabbit salad was really oily and the tiny brioche with fork separated rabbit (part of the salad) as well. The brioche was like were eating a slab of butter as you could not even taste the actual rabbit. \n\nThe caesar salad was flavorful and robust. You could taste the anchovies but I never saw any bits as they must have incorporated it into the dressing. Very well done.\n\nService was okay and I don't think I'll be back. There are a lot better restaurants in San Francisco and I'm staying away from chicken unless fried.", "author": "S L."}

Not as good as Washington oysters (says the drunken grandpa), but pretty good. \n\nThe quail would have been tasty, I'm sure, if my boyfriend had let me have any. My main was pretty disappointing actually. I had the bream/clam chowder. It was not what I was expecting at all. Thin soup, clams still in their shells, and the bream was just sort of laying on top of everything. It still tasted alright, but the presentation was really off-putting. \n\nGo here: for groups of 4 or under. It's too loud for a big group. \n\nTip o' the day: The roast chicken for two is amazing, but it needs an hour to prepare. Try ordering it when you first get seated.", "author": "Ali L."}

Not spicy enough for my taste, but great, fresh, tangy flavors. I drank it up and ate the little pieces of onion and bell pepper at the bottom, plus the celery stick. SO good. Nice oyster selection, and our friendly waiter made some phenomenal picks for us. The burger is good, mostly because I LOVED the bread and pickled onion it came with, not because the patty is anything extraordinary. The shoestring fries are a must for lovers of the shoestring variety. And the ceasar salad was beautiful and tasty. Such pretty hearts of romaine! The anchovy bits were delicious and I fished around my salad plate for more. I didn't think the food was overly expensive as the total bill was $60 to split all the above and leave happy and full. \n\nI will have to come back and try the roast chicken and re-review.", "author": "Maian T."}

I've dined here four times over the last two years and will share some observations:\n\n- Host staff:  eternally friendly if you have a reservation.  Oddly aloof if you don't\n\n- Room:  I'm a fan of some of the untraditional seating arrangements (side by side, three in a corner, etc), but when it's a traditional arrangement, you feel very far away from your fellow diner.  That said, there's enough room for all the plates, etc, you'll need.  Functional.  (Side note - I've been seated at the same table 3 of the 4 times I've dined here - odd).  The lighting is wonderful, daytime or evening, and the artwork (most of the time) is very nice.  I love the exposed brick walls where they have them.\n\n- Waitstaff:  Always friendly, but I get the feeling they'd rather be somewhere else.  Not anti-patron, just distracted.  \n\n- Food:  Always good, but never outstanding.  I've had some dynamite oysters here, but the chicken that everyone else raves about was dry (though flavorful).  The goat sausage tasty, but the accompanying chard filled with way too many onions.  The smoked sardines bursting with flavor, but drowned in olive oil.  In other words, Zuni gets the 'meat' of it right, but the details seem to slip.\n\nI get here about every six months, and I won't be rushing back, but I don't mind going back to give it a whirl again.  I always have good company (and, thus, a good time).", "author": "Evan G."}

I had two recommendations from two friends to try it and one of them knows her meat. My bf tried it and I have to say even the grease from the burger was flavorful. The meat is tender and as you bite into it, the flavor of the meat itself requires no condiments. I had the pasta with clams and enjoyed it. It's not the best pasta around, but next time I plan to try  the chicken as it takes an hour to cook and tastes amazing. \n\nOverall, if you are in no rush and just want a fun, easy dining experience on a Sunday, this is the place to be!

I have been here for 3 hours and still have not received my entree.... Wow. It's 10pm...on a Wednesday. I can't believe this. Whoever has been giving this place more than one star must have a VIP card or something and I am jealous. When we came in the Hostess told us it would be an hour wait, so I asked if it was OK that we just get a drink and some oysters while we waited for our table, she said that as long as we do not order an entree that it would be OK. So, I added our name to the list and sat at a very tiny table in the bar area right by the hostess with our drinks. An hour goes by and the hostess comes up to us to ask if we had ordered our food....I said no, we are waiting for our table. She responds well...I took you off the waiting list and I'm already behind with seating customers. I said but we had a whole conversation that we would not order an entree in the bar area so we could get a table. She told us that if we wanted a table we would have to wait another 30 min minimum because she was too busy (THE MOST RUDE PERSON I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED AT A RESTAURANT BTW). Since we went there for my boyfriends birthday we ended up talking to the manager who said that he would get us the next table available. Well.... we did get the next table but we are still sitting here with no food. This is most definitely the worst customer service I have ever experienced in the city so far.

It has a nice woodiness due to the big wood burning stove the loaves are cooked in, but it's a bit dry and not worth the stomach space in my opinion.\n\nDrinks:\nSazerac  - knocked me off my feet, a great warm-and-fuzzy cocktail for a cold, rainy day.\nAperol cocktail - aperol, vodka, and orange peel, it tasted very citrusy but not strong.\nBalsamic bloody Mary - just trust me here.  Have several.\n\nFood:\nFor brunch, we did what we only reserve for very specific occasions - we ordered the chicken.  Yes, even in its *BEST STATE*, chicken is still just chicken, so I rarely order it, even when it's the dish the restaurant is \"famous for\".  However, after talking to a few locals and consulting friends, I was talked into the chicken (even the two nice men at the table nexus to us who were obviously eavesdropping our entire conversation had to interject, blow their cover, and reaffirm our choice of meal and drinks).  \n\nIt does take up to an hour to prepare, so order it right away if that's what you plan on.  Also, at $48 (it's chicken for two), it's definitely a splurge as far as chicken goes.  \n\nI will say two things about this dish:\n1. chicken-aside, just the bread salad it comes served on is nearly worth the $48 on its own.  It's grilled, tangy with balsamic, and oily and buttery.  It's littered with greens and currants, and has a nice sweet/salty/tangy taste going on, and the texture is both crunchy and soft.  Seriously, I may have paid the $50 just to have a big dish of this.\n\n2.  before you burn me at the stake, I KNOW IT'S JUST CHICKEN.  I don't even really like chicken.  HOWEVER, as far as restaurants with chicken as their \"specialty dish\" go, Zuni has THE BEST chicken dish I have ever eaten, EVER.  Easily.  It's orders of magnitude better than its nearest competitors, at least in my mind.  The skin is crispy and thin and holds a great deal of flavor without tasting fatty.  It also shields the chicken itself from drying out, so the meat is moist and flavorful.\n\nI know I know - it's chicken.  But if you have ever been tempted to \"get the chicken\" just because it's a restaurant's \"most famous dish\", here's the place to do it.", "author": "Heather G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-11-16", "description": "Apparently, 853 reviewers have already weighed in on their Zuni experience, so . . . it really doesn't matter what I say here.  I believe in economics they call this phenomenon \"diminishing marginal utility.\"\n\nAnyway, my friend and I came here last Wednesday.  We showed up 15 minutes early, and the hostess offered us to wait at the bar until they were ready to seat us.  It didn't look as though Zuni was particularly busy, but we did have reservations for 6:30.  So, we waited.  Since neither of us felt like getting a drink, we were, umm, loitering in the bar area, staring at the people and peeking into the open kitchen.  At least four different Zuni employees (a bartender, a kitchen staff member and 2 waiters) asked us if we needed some help.  Boy, that was really nice!   Even if they did mean \"get out of my way,\" they sure phrased it nicely.\n\nFinally, the hostess found us and escorted us to our table.  We followed the hostess blindly, as she led us from one tiny room to another, masterfully maneuvering around people and tables.  Did I mention her outfit reminded me of Mad Men's Peggy Olsen from season one?  Anyway, when she showed us to our table, it was definitely worth the long walk.  We were at a big 2-person table by the window overlooking a dark alley.  There were three other tables in our nook, but our table was by far the most isolated and, therefore, the best.\n\nOn the way to the restaurant, we agreed that we would order the chicken.  Our waiter, a tall, soft-spoken gentleman, asked us if we were thinking about the chicken.  Since the chicken takes about an hour to prepare, he put our order in right away and then returned to take the rest of our order.  He was very nice and polite, although he could not seem to offer an opinion on what we should have and in what order we should have it.  I know that the meek shall inherit the earth, but come on, man!\n\nSo, we had an hour to kill before our chicken was ready.  Word to the wise: do NOT go to Zuni with someone you don't particularly like or know all that well.  You will need to do a lot better than a few awkward pauses or uncomfortable silences to fill that one-hour wait.  Fortunately, we didn't have that problem.  Besides, we filled those voids with food.\n\nWe started with a salad that wasn't memorable at all.  Quite literally, I don't remember what was in that salad besides pomegranate kernels.  Our second appetizer was polenta served with Parmesan cheese.  That was easily my favorite part of the meal.  Delicious, perfectly cooked polenta served with freshly grated Parmesan cheese...yum.  Our third appetizer was ricotta cheese gnocchi.  It was basically balls of ricotta cheese and flour boiled in water.  It wasn't really gnocchi, but it was pretty good nonetheless.  Bonus points for our waiter who, having learned that we were going to split the appetizers, served them on separate plates.  Very nicely done, sir.\n\nWhen we were done with the appetizers, we still had about 20 minutes to wait for our chicken.  When it arrived, we were relieved to see it was served pre-carved into smaller, more manageable pieces.  6 large pieces of chicken were served on a bed of bread salad.  Bread salad, a Zuni specialty, is a misnomer.  What bread salad is is a few small pieces of sourdough soaked in chicken fat and vinaigrette and mixed with some greens.  Sure, it has the word \"salad\" in it, but don't you worry: it's not good for you.  The chicken itself, I am sorry to say, was pretty underwhelming.  It was decently roasted organic chicken, but it was not the \"OMG-this-is-to-die-for-and-I-don't-care-it's-$48\" chicken I expected.  I must be missing something because I thought it was good, but not great.  I rarely order chicken at a restaurant due to the messiness factor, and I don't think I'll be making another exception for Zuni any time soon.\n\n***3 stars for food + 4 stars for service = 3.5 stars, rounded up. ***", "author": "Yan G."}

Moved on to Caesar salad, NOT worth the hype. I don't really get that reputation, but then again, I'm not really a Caesar salad girl. The dessert was forgettable. It's all about the meat here. \n\nThe chicken is a lot of food, the man and I couldn't finish it all, that is rare, we can eat a lot. No fear, we brought it home and it really spiced up the mac n cheese we had for lunch the next day (is that sacrilege?). I am one of those people that never orders chicken from a restaurant cause I eat so much of it at home and seriously every night growing up, so it's gotta be extra special for me to order it, and this was worth it. \n\nWe were here for 2.5 hours. that's a long time, the chicken takes at least an hour, it's true. we totally took our time though, it was date night and we didn't want to be rushed so it was actually perfect. the service was great in the beginning and seemingly after they realized we were that couple that hogs the table all night our attentive server abandoned us. seriously.", "author": "Sarah G."}

We arrived at 5:52 for a 6:00 reservation, but the host considered us too early to be seated and sent to the bar, as were many others.  The thing is, restaurants want you to be on time, and this doesn't really provide the right incentive to do so.  I'll be sure to be 5-10 minutes late if there is a next time.  The drinks at the bar were good but not good enough to justify the high prices.  I overheard the bartender telling the woman to my left something about not having fruity drinks or some such thing.  He did make her something pretty with cassis in it in the end.  It's fine if you want to maintain discerning standards at the bar, but overall it just wasn't friendly.  Plus we couldn't shift the tab to our table.\n\nThe food was good though.  Oysters were excellent -- I had scoped out the oyster bar while waiting for the table, and they looked great, and I was glad to get them.  Each type really tasted distinct and extremely fresh, and the mignonnette sauce went with them well.  The prosciutto appetizer was different than expected, with each piece wrapped around some cheese making a little purse, and they were delicious.  The fish I had as a main course was very good as well, though not out of this world.\n\nAlso, we got a great table upstairs by the window which was nice.  You could look down below and see the bread being cut and people filling in.  The service upstairs was fine -- friendly and reasonably attentive.\n\nSo basically, they're an institution, and while at times it feels like I can get equally fresh and local food elsewhere, it's good to remember the institutions that led the way.  But next time I get dinner before the ballet, I'm heading to Fish & Farm or trying Conduit instead.

The restaurant itself was cute, open kitchen, rustic and simple with big windows.  We were celebrating a birthday for a very important & special person - Elizabeth!  It was a nice dinner of 5 and among us all we ordered: the infamous roasted chicken (that later the leftovers were left in the coat check of a comedy club, we mourned the loss of the chicken,) the pork chop, the salmon, spaghetti with porcini mushrooms and for apps, the burratta crostini, clams and the fried squab app.  (which YES I tried it, but just a tiny little piece so I can't really say that I've had it, but kudos to me for being \"adventurous!\")  I personally had a taste of everything except the pork chop & clams and it all was so good.  The infamous roasted chicken was good - but it didn't blow me away.  I thought that it would have since it takes an hour and it's the one thing that everyone talks about.  The spaghetti with mushrooms was simple, but honestly I think it was my favorite.  The burratta crostini was delicious and I wish I had ordered my own.  They don't have a limit of BYOB and the corkage fee is $20.  We thought that because we shared our wine and cake w/ our waiter AND ordered a bottle of dessert wine that he'd knock off one of the fees (we brought 3 bottles) - but he didn't.  He did give me a tour of the kitchen, but still restaurant/server etiquette would have been to only charge 2 corkage fees.  The menu is simple and changes often because they use seasonal ingredients which is always a plus because if you know that they create great dishes, you can always go back and try something new.  I'd definitely try it again, but considering how many restaurants there are in S.F. there are others I'll need to try before I go back.

Our chef friend Chris Kidder had recommended the spot because he had once been a cook there. We just wanted a light meal before going out for the night, so we ordered several appetizers to get a taste for the place. Here's what we ordered and what we thought about it:\nThe polenta with marscapone and parmesean cheese was simple and delicious, with a perfectly creamy texture and comforting warmth. \nThe ceasar salad, which we heard was a Zuni classic, lived up to its hype. I'm normally not a fan of ceasar salads because I find them too bland and uninspired. This one was an exception to the rule, made with the crispest romaine lettuce, a house-made dressing whose garlic and anchovy flavors shone, and crunchy, zesty house-made croutons. \nA great accompaniment to the salad were the shoestring french fries, which came to our table in a well-salted, heaping portion and were made even better when our waiter brought over some house-made aioli and ketchup.\nWe also ordered clams stewed with zucchini and tomato, but these were a little disappointing. The clams were good, but some of the zucchini arrived uncooked, and the broth lacked the flavor I expected after tasting their other dishes.\nMy boyfriend and friend shared the rabbit and mustard greens salad, since I would have no part in the bunny-killing. They didn't seem mind at all, though: \"The rabbit, which was a mix of confit and meat, was tender and went well with the greens' natural spiciness. It made for a good salad.\" \nZuni is in a beautiful brick flatiron building that has an urban Soho vibe, yet a warm, comfy feel. Our waiter, who appeared to have no qualms with being given the casual bar section on a Saturday night, was patient and welcoming even though it was clear we weren't coming in to spend a lot of money.\nIf you want to eat at a classic spot in San Francisco, I'd recommend this one. They seem to be best at doing the simple dishes--just really, really well. Hopefully we can go back for a full dinner soon.", "author": "Sam O."}

Or did I?\n\nI ordered a lemonade in the bar area while waiting on my friend, and all the while, watched food pass by.  I was so hungry, I ordered a plate of fries that would hopefully arrive when my friend did.  The lemonade was utterly tasteless, mostly thinned out with water.  However, the fries were delectably thin, perfectly crisped, and shattered with every finger licking bite.\n\nI ordered six oysters, all fresh, briny.  However, my friend's shepherd pie was so tiny I could have eaten it in one bite.  It was also bland and boring.\n\nThe chicken for two was juicy, but very tasteless.  The skin was somewhat crisp, the bread salad, very under-seasoned.  Currants and pinenuts were a good addition, but the dressing had no acidity, giving the bread and greens a nasty slick which coated the back of my mouth.\n\nService can be a little absentminded, e.g. one busser and one waitress for about 8 tables in the upstairs seating area.

The atmosphere was incredibly laid back, but the service seemed a bit out of it, or disinterested.  It didn't impact the meal that much... I asked for a fork, it was forgotten.  I asked for tabasco.. it was forgotten.  \n\nMy lunchmate's pork loin looked *great*; the presentation was stellar, it looked moist and perfectly cooked, and the accompaniement wasn't only attractive, but functionally deferential to the pork... adding to the depth of the loin without overpowering it's sweet pork taste.  \n\nThe Miyagi and Pacific oysters out of Tomales were DREAMY and the mignonette was a perfect, classic arrangement.  I am tired of weird mignonettes.... it's a classic and traditional option for the menu, and that's why it's there.  There is no need to all of a sudden challenge us with something that completely retards the integrity of it's classicism.  So on my charge to rid menus of the played out ahi tartare, I am also of the opinion a mignonette should be a mignonette, and that's that.\n\nI got a burger.. opting to test the stand-by on the menu.  Interesting that the whole experience seemed that clinical that I was viewing it from a reviewer perspective rather than enjoying my meal.\n\nThe shoestring potatoes were a bit boring as an addition to my meal - hard and too salty.  The foccacia on my burger was awful, frankly.  It was dry, bland, and crumbled around the burger.  The burger was dusted with little to no blue cheese, albeit that's what I ordered.  I sort of had to hunt and peck for it.  It was there, but you shouldn't have to remove your badly damaged bun to prove that.  The pickles and onions looked great, and tasted delicious.  The server *was* nice, but a bit obsqeqious, overly so... that endless deference that seems like the smile is a bit too tight lipped, and the gracious bow is just too sarcastic. It was a late business lunch tho... maybe they had their off day crew of hungover troglodytes.  I am totally just kidding... 100%.  I just like playing at haughty ostentation.  Seriously... she forgot some stuff, seemed like her act was laid on a bit thick... but everyone has an off day.  It's decently priced, too, for a business outing.  In the end, I also admit to a new addiction -  The bread they bring to the table is awesome.\n\nI have been a couple times, I will go a few more.

If you're a chicken, Caesar-salad, and oyster fan, you've stumbled into a little slice of heaven. Be sure to make a reservation if you plan on loitering with a group, but walking in on a Friday night for a pre-dinner appetizer and drink and plopping down in the wedge shaped bar seats is one of my favorite pastimes.\r\n\r\nChicken for 2 is a must to try at least once, and we usually do so with 3 or 4 people (you're eating the whole bird with a rich, current laden bread-salad stuffing.) As well, their salads are excellent across the boards, and I do love the double-cut pork chop when it's on the menu. If you're into oysters, they have one of the most thorough menus in the city complete with both east and west coast US varieties represented, as well as a few Canadian thrown in for good measure. Our favorite mid-sized, buttery flavored lovelies include the Malpec, Kumamoto, Wellfleet, and many others, and again, the well educated staff can help guide you on your adventures through mollusk town.\r\n\r\nWith an all brass bar top and fittings, and the striking full glass window behind the bottle shelves make the bar at Zuni very impressive. Test their tenders by ordering an old-school cocktail (Negroni, Manhattan, Side Car, etc.) and be deliciously rewarded for your prodding.

I thought she might just take the menu and dump the crumbs in the compost or trash in the kitchen...\n\nDessert was delicious, their signature chocolate cake & also got a crepe w/nectarine & blueberries. \n\nI agree w/another post, the nectarine for $5 is a little bit silly. We joked about how funny it would be if it was just a nectarine & when we asked they confirmed that's all it was! Yes, everything is pretty much all local, sustainable but I can get several of those bad boys at my local farmer's market for the same price. So we paid a couple of $ more for the crepe that was delish. \n\nOverall great experience! I am between 4 and 5 stars here only because of the slightly strange service but that may have just been luck of the draw and she wasn't that bad. \n\nHighly recommend the oysters, gnocchi (we had spinach & ricotta, yum!) and chicken! The menu rotates but I think they generally will have these items more or less. \n\nBon appetite!", "author": "Abby W."}

They were good -- I'd never pretend to have a great palate for oysters, but I think I prefer the Oyster Bar in Grand Central Station.\n\nChicken came out and was delicious, but didn't transcend it's chicken-ness. Definitely worth ordering, but it certainly won't change the way you think about chicken.

The menu changes daily, and while the food is consistently good, it was notably so today.  \n\nOur server, Logan, was perky and attentive, and gave us good recommendations.  Note to people eating here- the servers try the food daily and have a lot of knowledge, and are happy to share it if you ask questions.  It was great watching our server as she excitedly guided the table next to us through his first attempt at eating a raw oyster (he loved it).  We asked the oyster shucker to select a couple of his favorites for us, since the oyster list is extensive, and the selection varies daily.  Delicious.  Next- fresh grapefruit in wild honey, and the french toast with fresh strawberries.  This was very exciting because Zuni only serves brunch on Sundays, and the french toast is only an occasional item at that, so my husband had never tried it before.  He quickly declared it the best french toast in the city (maybe tying with Olea).  Next course we split the red lentil soup, so yummy, and lamb's tounge and white beans.  The lamb's tounge was so delicate in texture and flavor... truly delightful.  Julien, the charming wine manager, helped me with wine pairing.  We finished off with oxtails and a poached egg- intensely flavorful and delicious.  If I had room I would have gone for that caramel pot de creme.   Great food, great service.

None have been better than the 1982 Chateau Lafite Rothschild paired with the absolute best Roasted Chicken I ever had at Zuni Cafe in San Francisco!\n\nIt was July of 2001 and my brother had made the decision to move back to Los Angeles. For anybody in the wine industry, leaving San Francisco to come to LA would be career suicide, but our Mother was dieing of Lou Gehrig's Disease and my brother wanted to spend the remaining months of her life by her side. In 2001, I was still a novice when it came to understanding \"WINE\" completely. I had made several trips to San Francisco and the wine country before. Plus, I had already began to collect wines for several years under my brother's guidance of buying the best. This trip would turn out to be the last I ever make to San Francisco with my brother. There have been so many great wine memories in this city with my brother like my birthday dinner party where I insisted on eating Seafood Risotto even though I was drinking 1997 Bryant Family Cabernet. Would I love to get that memory back today and eat the right meal with that wine. An absolute YES! Unfortunately, there is no Bryant Family wine left in our collection.\n\nSo we come to that warm summer day in 2001. Where my brother Michael this time would insist that I must have Roasted Chicken from Zuni Cafe. The problem was he also wanted to open 1982 Chateau Lafite. By 2001 I had learned what to do and not to do when it comes to opening a nice bottle of wine, but this was Michael's farewell meal and he insisted that we go to his favorite restaurant in San Francisco of all time.\n\nZuni Cafe is located at 1658 Market St (between 12th St & Page St) which was walking distance from my brothers loft. When we arrived we quickly ordered the Roasted Chicken being that the dish requires 1 hour of cooking time. The dish is cooked in a brick oven and comes with a warm bread salad with red mustard greens, scallions, currants and pine nuts.\n\nWe actually started the meal with a cocktail while the wine opened up. Both our thoughts at the time were of sadness for our mother's health and for my brother leaving San Francisco which I still believe is a much better food city then Los Angeles ever will be.\n\nAs for the famous Zuni Roasted Chicken. It was the most succulent bird I ever had. The brick oven gave the chicken a beautiful smoky flavor that worked very well with the wine. The skin was a Utopia of crunchy perfection. The salad is a warm mix of crispy, tender and chewy chunks of bread. It had little slivers of garlic and scallions. Just the right amounts of currants and pine nuts with a handful of greens all moistened with vinaigrette and chicken drippings.\n\nToday my mouth still waters when I think of that dish. It was one of the most memorable food moments I ever had in my life in a city I find so dear to my heart when it comes to both food and wine.\n\nAS FOR THE WINE:\n\nThere are just a few words to describe 1982 Chateau Lafite Rothschild. Perfection would be one of them. But I still remember telling my brother as that first sip of wine hit my lips was how much better this wine was than anything I had ever tried before. The wine showed finesse and elegance that I had never seen before in red wine. Plums, Cedar, Liquid Smoke, and Earth are what a remember. Who cares that I had it with Chicken. Yes! it could of benefited from a rack of lamb, but now that I think of it, I would of drank this wine with dessert if I could. It is just that good.\n\nPERFECTION! It has never been duplicated again!\n\nAs seen in this photo:\nhttp://static2.px.yelp.com/photo/2GOa7paOTkyq4xsGQaMDqg/l\n\nI own Judy Rodger's Zuni Cafe Cookbook. In the book, is the famous recipe. Temptation has always driven me to try and duplicate that dish.\n\nWhy mess with one of my most memorable \"Wine Moments\" of all time.\n\nCheers!", "author": "John R."}

Bread was replenished once without us asking. Waiter also seemed to be aware of the wine and food to the degree you expect from a well established place.\n\n2 Stars on the appetizers.... Mussels in a light cream sauce with onions and peas? First off, the waiter said 6 mussels - only 5 came out. He said they were big, they were small. Peas undercooked (good for a salad but not in a cooked dish!) and they didn't taste different than frozen ones (I'm assuming they used fresh?). The sauce weak and watery. And why were the peas there in the first place - they didn't really belong? The dish needed some spice or acidity or something to make it sing. And I want my missing mussel back. The fried stuff.... arugula and onions with a honey sauce smeared on the plate. Was interesting, but needed more sauce to dip rather than blot the plate. Perfectly salted though - and appreciated the bitter greens with the sweet honey.\n\n2 Stars on the CHICKEN with BREAD SALAD. (actually 5 stars on the bread part - more on that later). The chicken tasted brined - the breasts too salty and not as succulent as you'd expect with a brined bird. The thighs delicious(can't screw up dark meat that much), the legs tasty but a bit dry. Most parts of the skin were a bit soggy and fatty (i.e. the chicken sat a bit too long after cooking and didn't have time to render all the fat out is my guess). Although the skin parts that were edible were delicious (thank the oven for that). The bird was a bit on the small side for the price - two of us easily at the WHOLE thing. And why was it not really that hot? If it came out of their oven and was quickly cut and plated - it should have been a bit more warm. Not sure if I buy the whole custom cooked chicken thing. Seems like they must just keep putting them in the oven every few minutes and space the service accordingly.\n\nThe bread salad/crouton part was exceptionally good. The combination of chicken grease, vinegar and the size and taste of the bread was just about perfect. The pine nuts and other things really not needed and frankly were hard to get off the plate. I'd pay $20 just for a plate of this stuffing alone. \n\nSo... if you're on a budget - buy a grocery store chicken. A good one will be brined and still succulent and have a nice skin on that you can re-crisp in the oven. But if you do want to taste some great stuffing then splurge. \n\nAs for the oysters - as some others noted - the prices are a tad high - especially for the size (walk past the oysters downstairs and see for yourself). Seems like they're priced high for the great variety they keep in stock. I'd suggest - keep a few good types and charge less. The shrimp I saw on another diner's plate didn't seem all that. In fact their whole seafood platter fell a bit flat. \n\nWine selections were fine (and the glasses were always refilled diligently).\n\nIn summary - great service - hit or miss food items.", "author": "Dave P."}

I went there after work for an early happy hour celebration for a coworker who recently wed. They sat us in the window area on Rose and Market Streets and apparently it was a nice experience when the first 4 guests arrived. Then when the full party arrived, there were 8 (!) of us, and the hostess was rude numerous times. She let us know they needed to keep an \"aisle\" clear so the person in the very corner could be accessed. This person was part of our party so if plate or drink passing occurred, no big deal. She made a point to come by several times if a person crossed the imaginary line into verboten territory and repeated her ever-growing condescending order to keep the path clear. Our waiter was quite chilly at first, too, but eventually warmed to room temperature. Still, we thought we ordered two plates of shoestring fries at his suggestion, but then only one appeared, which was fine in the end as they were too salty. And the only condiment it was served with was ketchup which is surprising because this is supposed to be fine dining and even pubs serve an aioli or mustardy condiment with fries. But my review is more about the attitude than the food. When my friends went out to smoke, they sat on the bench provided by Zuni on Rose St. The rude hostess banged loudly on the window and pointed at the sign agitatedly that stated a certain distance from the door needed to be maintained when smoking. The rude hostess realized her error by the horrified looks on my friends' faces and walked outside to explain, but it was too late, the damage had been done. I've had better service at a McDonald's.

I had the good fortune of enjoying my dinner with visiting family that could expense their business trip to his investment brokerage, so a lovely rare treat for my mom and me.\n\nI was extremely lucky to find a parking space on Gough just as I was about give in to the $10 valet.  We came 15 minutes ahead of our reservation for 4 on, oh, I think it was Thursday evening, and were seated nearly immediately at a Market Street facing window table on the ground floor.\n\nMy appetizer, oh golly, I can't remember my appetizer.  I know it was absolutely fabulous, and it wasn't a salad or soup, but I can't for the life of me remember the awesome appetizer that was.  I did manage to peck at my fellow diners' appetizers, and also recall that they were super delish.\n\nOn to the main course then, and...oh...what was it?  There was a spicy sausage something and mashed potatoes and I think some other meat...Oh, I am the worst restaurant critic in the world.  It was just all so good!  It wasn't their famed chicken, I know that.\n\nDessert was a chocolate creme freche.  Excellent.  I was apparently on a chocolate kick at that time, so I had a hot cocoa to go along with it.  Also excellent.  I was also pleasantly pleased that the portions of the previous meal left me very satisfactorily full, but not so full as to make dessert an abhorrent possibility.\n\nOur server was so full of personality that I was amazed it was only her second day at the restaurant.  She only went to her cheat sheet once after a very specific question from us, and it was handled with such grace and elegance.  She's originally from Utah, and she deserves a great tip, again from the investment firm paying for the whole thing.  She totally was keyed to my jokes about my mom and her friend taking forever to decide, and she was right there just when I was thinking it was time to order up another fruity Pellegrino drink.\n\nOur experience there was absolutely superb, and even as I worried about my always lingering family, the staff offered little indication that it was time for us to go.  Definitely exceeds expectations.\n\nI would take a boyfriend here for an anniversary date.", "author": "Jeremy K."}

It turns out that they stop serving the burger in late afternoon until 10PM.  This means you can pay $48 for a chicken (!!!!) or put together some of the snacks for an overpriced meal.  This isn't to knock the food - the halibut cheeks were particularly outstanding - but in today's economy, there need to be options.  And this was clear from looking around - 8PM on a Saturday night and we had no trouble getting a table for four without a reservation.\n\nThis economy means restaurants need to wake up.  I know it's not easy being in the restaurant business, but with the real estate signs go up in buildings all over the city, restaurants need to renew their leases and put some pressure on their suppliers.  \n\nThe service was a bit slower than we expected also...", "author": "Spike S."}

This time, however, the service left a great deal to be desired. We had a 6 PM reservation (as we were going to the symphony).   We arrived around 5:45 and had a glass of wine in the cafe -- at 6 I noticed they were seating restaurant patrons who arrived after we did. I asked the waitress (who brought dinner menus to our cafe table) and she checked with the hostess. She came back and said our reservation was not until 6:45.  When I objected, she said she would check again -- I saw her check, but she didn't come back to tell us anything. Finally, I went up to the hostess, and she acted like she was doing us a big favor to seat us (it was now 6:15). \nThe dinner was very good -- and one entree, the duck, was spectacular  -- although I was still bothered by our seating experience. The waiter was very sullen. He didn't even smile when he brought my husband's birthday dessert with a lit candle.  Only the assistant waiter (don't want to call him a busboy, because he was an older man) who brought us bread, refilled our water, and brought an extra cup of coffee --  treated us politely and hospitably.\nThis was such a disappointing experience on what should have been a very special occasion.", "author": "Elaine E."}

Both entrees had a lot of potential, but the serving sizes were astoundingly small.  Anyone that knows me will tell you I'm a very light eater, so to hear me complain about portion size is a first.  The worst part is the food was totally cold.  Lukewarm at best.\n\nI didn't hear specifics, but apparently our neighbors at the next table were not happy either.  We didn't complain because it sounded like the next table had it covered for all of us and I didn't want the server and host to feel even worse... but then I wish I would have, because the waitress totally took off and we didn't see her again, or anyone else for what seemed like forever... long after we had both finished our entrees.\n\nFortunately, we both finally ordered creme brulee for dessert, which was perfect and saved the evening.\n\nI'll give Zuni a second try if I have a chance, but I'm certainly not going to go out of my way to go back.", "author": "Gregory J."}

The key to Californian cuisine is quality sourced ingredients cooked simply and well and Zuni has developed a short and stylish Cal-Italian menu based around the brick oven proudly occupying the centre of the room, birthplace of their classic roast chicken. \n\nA few casual bar tables fit into the tight but light and airy block corner space and the gradual growth into the mezzanine and an adjacent room has given them a more classic dining room with linen cloths to match. It's a wonderfully Californian space. The crowd were well heeled and Cali casual. Hipsters in havianas mixed with dressed down grey hairs. So many things I could have eaten on this menu. The burgers at the next table looked stunning, as did a nearby pizza, and the Tuscan roast chicken will have to be saved for my next visit ($42 for the chicken, but it shares with at least 3 or 4 judging by other reviews, allow an hour or pre-order if you get there before me). \n\nI opened with Serrano ham served with pimentos de padron, goats cheese and orange zest gremolata. The crunchy zing of the gremolata and the salty spice of the pimentos came in perfectly with the goats cheese. The ham was good, but I've had better, and much closer to home. The main was revelatory. One of the thickest pork chops I've ever had the pleasure of eating. The knowledgable enthusiast serving me gave me the run down of its history. From a farm called Becker Lane, a small Iowa producer apparently, it was an Iowan pork chop as you'd imagine. Like their men, grown on corn, open space and sunshine. Free range to the point of being semi-wild, it had dark open flesh and was meatily juicy to the n'th degree. If I were a pig, I'd want to be this pig (assuming there's no opening for the one in Babe). It came with a semi-raw salad of fresh green beans and thin sliced courgette with the pick me up of purple basil. The two elements were brought together with a Sungold heritage tomato salad in a light dressing, the sweet snap of the tomatoes cutting through the glistening unctuous fat of the heaven sent chop.", "author": "Rich M."}

Half our party got there a bit before 5, they weren't seating people yet but they were able to get cocktails at the bar (my sis mentioned that it was one of the best bloody marys she's had)...we met them at the bar and we were all seated promptly at 5.  As soon as the server stopped by, we made sure to place our order for the roast chicken right away...the order clocked in at 5:05! :)\n\nFor appetizers, we started off with some oysters, then got some assorted sausages and shoestring potatoes.  Everything was great (especially loved one of the little oysters and the shoestring fries) and kept us satisfied while we waited for the roast chicken.  Since we were a party of 4, got two other entrees, the steak and the duck.  Both were pretty good, though I had to admit the roast chicken with bread salad was definitely the star of the show.  I thought it was actually worth the price, since you get the full chicken...my sister and I split it, but we still had enough to give some to the hubbies to try.  I've tried making this at home before (the recipe is everywhere online), but I could not get the skin to be as crisp, and their bread salad was so much better...less soggy and had more of the toasty crunch.  I guess even if you have the exact same recipe at home, it's hard to replicate their brick oven and professional chefs.  \n\nHaving just come back from Europe the week before, I was a bit sticker-shocked at the wine list when viewing it online (got too used to most bottles being less than 20 euros...why do they mark up wines so much in the US?).  We decided to bring in our own wines and pay the $20 corkage.  My sis and her hubby brought in a Robert Hunter sparkling wine they got in Sonoma, and my hubby and I brought a Merry Edwards Pinot, also from Sonoma.  The server didn't even bat an eye at us bringing two wines, which was good (some places tend to not like it if you bring your own).  At least we brought really good wines that were not on their list, and cannot be bought at retail...it gave us a chance to sample some of the nicer bottles in our cellars with a professionally cooked meal.  Don't think we could find a $50 retail bottle for $70 or less on their list (probably would be over $100) so I thought it was a great deal to bring in our own.  The bubbly went perfectly with the oysters and other appetizers, and the Pinot, which had the big russian river style, went perfectly with the chicken and duck (and even held up to the steak).\n\nFor dessert, we split an order of the blue cheese (came with some honey and walnuts) and the gateau victoire, a flourless chocolate cake with whipped cream.  Both were really good....I loved the blue cheese but I have to admit I have a weakness for flourless chocolate cake...it was very well made and the soft whipped cream went perfectly.  To go with it, I got some madeira, my sis got some tawny port, and the hubbies got some brandy.  \n\nWith all this, we managed to get out of the restaurant a little past 7...the servers were very conscious of the fact that we were going to a show, and made sure we made it out on time.  I definitely highly recommend this restaurant for anyone catching a show in the Orpheum, or just in general for the best roast chicken in town.", "author": "Arlene M."}

Nobody was checking on us.  Finally when we asked the waiter, he said \"Oh, I never confirmed that\".  Like, was that OUR fault?  Right.  They auctioned off the entrees all to the wrong people (table-number dyslexia?).  My friend's Caesar salad was hanging off the plate.  Obviously servers had to touch the food to handle the plate.  No tender, romaine leaves; all dark-green outside leaves, too big for the plate,  touching the table, etc.  It was unappealing and unruly.  She ate about 5% of it.  Nobody asked why when they cleared her nearly-full plate and charged full price for it.  She also ordered 1/4 crab.  Silly presentation: 3 legs plopped on a white plate with a ramekin of aioli.  About 20 minutes in, she was able to flag someone for a wedge of lemon. Flimsy little bent steak knife was a surprise.  Disappointed to order oysters and then have to have the waiter come back to tell us they didn't have some of them. Might have know in advance.  Changed the order and oysters were good.

When I got in, there were all these little rooms and stairways and it seemed a little confusing to navigate. Eventually I found her, and was able to peruse the menu. Seems each night the main dishes change, so there was only one page. We got the chicken for two, as well as a caesar salad and shoestring fries. The fries were not too impressive, but then again they were only six bucks. The good part came from the salad and the chicken. While these items are a bit pricey, I have to say I got my moneys worth. The salad had big thick lettuce leaves, rather then those mini diced square lettuce leaves you see in most restaurants. The cheese topping was tasty, and the croutons were huge and crunchy, some of the best I've tried. However, it was the chicken that was the best part of the meal. They smoke this bird for about an hour, and it came out tasting flavorful and juicy. I am a very simple guy, and can eat chicken at any old place and still be satisfied, like at boston market or even greasy KFC. But I gotta say wow, this chicken was nice. It looks like they really took the time to make this bird flavorful and satisfying. There were more than enough pieces for both me and my wife. Even the skin of the chicken was just right, not too crispy but not too soft. I wouldn't mind eating this again. As the night wore on, we saw more and more people coming in, so you know this place is popular. If they keep cooking the chicken like this, I can imagine they will keep making lots of money.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-08-28", "description": "Hmmm. I don't get it. I read the raves about the chicken. Got a taste for chicken (think the Fifth Element's LeeLoo uttering, \"Chicken . . . good\"). Ordered chicken. One hour later, got underwhelming chicken. It wasn't bad -- it just wasn't anything even remotely special or noteworthy. So I have to wonder, is a properly cooked chicken such a novelty these days that people get excited about it for the mere fact of it not being overcooked? Fortunately, I have found an alternate place, less than a mile away from the Zuni Caf\u00e9, to get a nicely flavored, properly cooked chicken for much less than $48 ($24 pp). Unfortunately, this alternate source is rather exclusive. They require that you join their club and they will check your membership card at the door and upon leaving. But if you aren't already a Costco member you should consider joining so that you, too, can pick up a $5 roasted chicken at the same time you score a gianormous bale of toilet paper or paper towels at low, low warehouse prices. While I found the Zuni Caf\u00e9's chicken meat to be marginally better than its ready-to-eat counterpart at the Costco deli, Costco always delivers on the crispy skin whereas Zuni Caf\u00e9 produced something that was, well, one of those words that has the power to ruin a girl's evening . . . limp. Damn. If price were no object, it would be a toss-up between which chicken I liked better. Throw in the price comparison and Costco is the clear winner. I do agree, however, with the other reviewers that the bread salad was simply delicious. (Hooray for carbs to the rescue!) This was a relief given that the bread we were served at the table tended to be overcooked, with one loaf being quite dry with an almost black crust. (Side note: What's up with no bread plates? When you have bread THAT crusty and messy, you really need bread plates . . . especially when you only have one pat of butter for four people to share. It took a Herculean effort for me to resist the urge to take a hunk of the butter pat and stick it on my paper tablecloth so that I'd have butter at the ready to combat the dryness of the bread. Eventually, we all accumulated piles of crumbs on the dishless table and then hypothosized about what should be done to deal with the mess.) \nThe meal beyond the chicken was good, but not great. The oysters we started our evening with were delicious. (Query: Does a restaurant get credit for serving something yummy when essentially they have done nothing to prepare that item but clean it and put it on a plate?) The meatballs were tiny (you can insert your own \"small balls\" joke here), but good. One of our party got the gnocchi as an entr\u00e9e and shared some because she wanted to see if the rest of us agreed that it tasted less like gnocchi and more like scrambled eggs (it did, but it had a nice finish to it which was probably because the gnocchi was swimming in a virtual butter-soup - tasty but I better wait to get my cholesterol checked for a while). The fourth person in our party had the rabbit and liked it enough that he didn't offer to share . . . or perhaps that was because the portion size wasn't very large. Holding firm to the philosophy that no dinner out is complete without chocolate, two of us shared the only true chocolate item on the menu: the Gateau Victoire. This flourless chocolate cake was also rather moistureless, but for the whipped cream, and tasted overwhelmingly of espresso, which came as an unpleasant surprise to us non-coffee drinkers. This might have been the first time that we have shared a chocolate dessert and left half of it on the plate. Blah. Our server was very pleasant and helpful when she was around.

The ambience is nice, its almost rustic-ish, and inviting. The staff is great; very knowledgeable and friendly. One thing to note: if you plan on actually sitting down to get a drink before the meal, then you might want to not make Zuni your first stop, since there's no stools at the bars.\nSOME THINGS I FORGOT TO ADD:\nIt takes an hour from when you order for the chicken done, because it's cooked in a woodburning stove(or some sort of oven), but its totally worth it.\nIts made with a currant and mint bread salad, which soaks with the chicken when its cooking.

The roasted chicken and the selection of oysters make this a special place, but the restaurant needs to act a little humble from time to time.

It is my opinion that a great chef and menu are not the only ingredients necessary to achieve a successful restaurant.

Finally I decided that I had waited long enough and had to try it. I made a reservation three weeks ago and have been looking forward to it ever since. \nWe arrived early and had a drink at the beautiful copper bar. I had been hopping that we would get a table near the kitchen and they must have read my mind because we got a perfect table facing the kitchen....so I could see them making everything! Also see all of the cute chefs. \nI LOVE roast chicken, it's one of my all time favorite foods. So it was a no brainer that we would order that. Knowing it would take an hour, we also ordered the burratta crostini and the Caesar salad. It's pretty hard to have anything not taste amazing when you pair it with decadent burratta and this did not disappoint. \nI seemed to have OD-ed on Caesar salads as a teenager, so have not had one in a long time, but because I could see the guy at the salad station making numerous Caesar salads, I figured I give it another chance. I am glad I did, it was pretty much a perfect Caesar salad (just a tad overdressed). The romaine wasn't cut, which is usually a pet-peeve of mine, but because the leaves were on the smaller side I didn't mind. The dressing was light and perfectly anchovy-ey, garlicky, lemony and peppery. \nNow to the perfect roast chicken and bread salad. It was the epitome of simple food that tastes amazing and way more complex than it appears. Crispy, perfectly seasoned skin. Super moist and flavorful meat. Served on top of a rustic bread salad dressed with champagne vinegar and drippings from the chicken and sprinkled with pine nuts and currants. \nAlso our waiter was great, I forget his name, but he was one of the best waiters I've had in a long time. He was very helpful in describing the wines. He personally split up our salad so we each had our own plate.

Tray of oysters, caesar salad and the roast chicken.  Rarely do I order anything else.  I even order the roast chicken when  I go for lunch.  I think the other dishes they serve are good to very good but nothing really matches the chicken.   So this review only applies to my regular order.\n\nWhen I recommend the chicken to others, the normal reaction is \"chicken?!?!? how good could it really be?\"  But afterwards, everyone is always amazed how good it actually tastes.  The only one that is comparable is the one served at Bouchon, but even Thomas Keller could not match the one at Zuni.\n\nThe oysters are always fresh - much better and more variety than the ones served at hog island.  The caesar salad is nicely balanced and they don't skimp on the anchovy.  A caesar without a distinctive anchovy flavor is not a caesar, IMO. \n\nOthers dishes I can recommend are the polenta, shoe string fried potatoes (crunchy but tender in the middle), and the hamburger.  Also recommend you try the balsamic vinegar bloody mary.  Excellent.  Much better than a traditional bloody mary.   The vinegar complements the tomato flavor better than the traditional Worcestershire sauce.\n\nI've read a lot of complaints about the service but I always felt the service was very good.  Never had an issue.  Zuni is certainly not cheap (even I was a bit taken aback by the $48 price for the chicken for two during my last meal) but its worth the splurge.\n\nSo go.

We called to see about some rezzies, and while they told us it would be a half hr wait, when we arrived 10 mins later by foot they took us straight-away. Tip: dine early; it filled in readily as the eve went forward. Interesting table where we shared a side and looked outward at other diners (i DID see the winner of the Ugly Holiday Sweater Award.. but i'm not sure she'd gotten the memo.. or even knew she was in the running! ;). My fella might've preferred a standard set-up, but i liked the novelty of the vantage point.\nI admit to dashed hopes on the \"fresh lime\" margarita: didn't find it particularly either of those descriptors and imagine mix was involved. Next time I'll go wine list.. \nThe food was rather lovely. Started with the Escarole salad, and i loved walnuts left raw and flavorful. We also had lamb (i know, i know.. sacrelig to skip chicken but warmth was needed in the winter bones!)  Ample portion and roasted garlic (among an array of veggies sorta stewed) was most delicious.. They charmed with a requested side of brus sprouts; flecked into a delicate leaf arrangement with enough flavor to make a unique offering, but not too much to mask seasonality of the ingredient. I love knowing those little cabbages came recently from a stalk :).    \nService as unassuming, but as available and helpful as needed.\nA solid Sat eve offering and just a few blocks walk-- all ze betta.", "author": "Rachel S."}

In this episode, Megan and Charlie fork over $35 each to a waiter who acted all judgey, as if they didn't  belong there! PSHAW, waiter man! After Megan and Charlie ordered their beers, he even had the audacity to ask whether they would be ordering food.  Imeancomeon, it's not like they looked homeless! Not only did they order burgers, but fries too! What fancy pants these two were wearing! Oh, they'll be back waspy old waiter man!\n\nAfter their meal, Charlie sits down to write Megan a letter about their evening together.\n\nMegan, did you know Zuni means \"delicious ball of cow\" in Swahili? I'm lying, it doesn't...but it should (!), because that's what this was: a delicious. Ball. Of cow.  Wouldn't you agree?\n\nOur short visit to Zuni Caf\u00e9 left us lighter in the wallet, but heavier in the saddle...isn't that some law of physics or something?\n\nAnyway, I thought the house-ground, 1/3 lb, Marin Sun Farms patty was served up perfectly, medium rare/rare, and with every bite that great burger juice was released. As you know Megan, this is the hallmark of any top-notch burger. The quality and flavor of the beef was exquisite and the accouterments added to - and did not distract from - the flavor. As we've experienced before, this can be a real issue. The grilled rosemary focaccia bun was fresh, moist and served as a great compliment to the garlic aioli and the buttery house - \"Zuni\" - pickles.  What a rich combination! Megan, I know you thought the rosemary foccaccia bun was delicious too but cumbersome and a bit large for the patty. You should have seen Megan trying to keep that thing together just long enough to shove it in her mouth! While I agree the bun-to-burger ratio was off, I though the bun held the burger with great grace. Personally, I thought the bun could have used a few more seconds on the grill; I really like that crunch, as I reminded you while I was getting no crunch...but now I'm just nitpicking. I know we disagree on this point.\n\nI was expecting the pickles to be intense, but they worked well with the whole construction, wouldn't you say, Megan? I'm glad we splurged for the Beecher's Flagship cheese - a semi-hard cow's milk cheese if for no other reason then to say we ordered the Beecher's Flagship cheese. I thought the side of ketchup and mustard was a nice touch, but wholly and totally unnecessary; this burger needed NO such crutches.\n\nAnd how can we forget that heaping pile of perfectly salted shoe-string fries!? Honestly, Megan, if it weren't for that six-year-old towhead stuffing her face with fries at the table across from us, we probably would have failed to order the fries....and that would have been a sin. Megan, I know you hoped we wouldn't eat every single fry...good thing the waiter pried the plate from our hands, or else we would have. God bless towheads!\n\nWhat a delicious overall meal and one of the best burgers to date..\n\nHeaping Mound O' Fries...\n\nSize: 1/3 lbs.\n\nAccouterments: House-ground hamburger on grilled rosemary focaccia with garden lettuces, garlic a\u00efoli, and Zuni pickles and onions.\n\nType of Meat: Cow\n\nRanch: Marin Sun Farms\n\nBeer with Burger: Charlie:Sierra Nevada Pal Ale, bottle; $5.50. Megan: Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, bottle; $7.\n\n\nBeer Selection: Limited. No Draft beers and about 10 overpriced bottles. I toyed with the idea of getting the $10 Saison Dupont, but I couldn't justify purchasing a $10 beer after purchasing a $20+ burger with fries.\n\nAmbiance: We wondered aloud whether the waiter was snotty or awkward, and then, wait a minute, realized we didn't care! An upscale restaurant on a street corner with lots of windows. The bar isn't for eating but rather for drinking and standing only. The greater bar area consists of a handful of two-tops at the front of the restaurant which are available for walk-ins.\n\n\nRating: 1.5 Standard deviations above the mean", "author": "Charlie R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-09-13", "description": "I eat here whenever I can. I've only had the roast chicken for two once. It was good, but not why I love the place. What I love is everything on the menu I haven't seen for a long time, if ever. If you don't know what it is, that's the reason to order it. Even if you do, order it -- whenever they have risotto it will blow you away, and they do have it many days in the winter. As for the foods they almost always have: The Caesar salad is the standard against which every other restaurant has to be measured. The oysters cannot be matched anywhere west of New York. They come with an understated and therefore perfect mignonette. The shoestrings are a must, if you have room for them. The pork chop makes you wish you could buy as good a piece of meat in your local store. And their regular dessert items, the chocolate one and the espresso granita, are the best you will ever taste.  But, after all, I often order the cheeses, which are well selected and presented.  \n\nBut as I said, the real secret to finding a great dish is to order what they don't have every day. Often, the soup. Always, any dish they have with nettles. Always, the risotto. The fish is  always good, too. And you can trust the wines by the glass. They are chosen not to wow you with too much flavor, but to go perfectly with your food (though there are plenty of monsters on the list if you order a bottle).", "author": "oz c."}

But simple food can be really, really great.  You know how at Chez Panisse, you order something that you think you're familiar with, but when it comes, you realize you've never really had it before? properly?  Or when you buy something at the farmer's market, and it's so fresh and awesome, that you don't even need to mess around with it?  That's the only way you can pull off a restaurant where you're neither innovative nor complex.  If it's going to be simple but earn its price tag, it's got to have impeccable ingredients, impeccable prepared.  Zuni ain't it.\n\nI know everyone raaaaaaaaves about the roast chicken.  But my dad's is better.  Now, my dad is a totally awesome (home) cook, and not everyone is spoiled enough to get to eat his food whenever they want, like I am.  But if I'm waiting an hour for a dish that the restaurant is famous around the country for, it needs to be some of the best I've ever eaten.  Like, really knock my socks off.  And Zuni's just doesn't.  I mean, I'm not a great cook, but I can roast my own chicken with a couple of herbs and manage not to dry it out.  It's just not that hard.  So that's not going to get me to fork over cash and a ton of time for it.\n\nBeyond that... I can't even really remember what else I've eaten here, which says a lot in itself.  I know once I had some kind of pasta dish that I liked, but again, it was super plain - pasta with just some parm and maybe parsley or something.  I could make it myself.  Maybe it's my fault for ordering something so ordinary, but I was hoping that based on Zuni's rep it would be amazing.  But it wasn't.  It was fine, but I don't need to pay $14 for it.  Same goes for the caesar.  I can't name another thing I've had here.  Oh, maybe the shoestring fries, so I must have had a burger or something...?  again, not memorable.  Q.E.D.\n\nI'm giving it two stars instead of one because I like the atmosphere, and because they've never really done anything affirmatively sucky.

The seats by the entrance and by the piano are self-seating, and while the tables are small, it's a pretty comfortable arrangement on a sunny day.  The many burgers around us looked delicious, but we opted for a small platter of oysters (three pairs) and shellfish (my first time with periwinkles--which are about the size of a calculator key and are scooped out of their tiny shells with toothpicks), the gem salad with picked beets, and the pork loin with Japanese eggplant, beans, and basil.  The service was excellent, and since we were sharing the dishes, the salad and the pork loin were served from the kitchen on two separate plates of equal portions, give or take a quarter of a beet or two.  Next time, shall try the burger, and the apple crisp/ice cream dessert my neighbor seemed to be enjoying but which alas, I had no room for.\n\nAlso, valet parking is available, but there is plenty of street parking during the day.

They were just as good as the dining room seating with full service and we actually had a live musician playing the piano right in front of us which was very nice.\nWe browsed through the menu and although there were a few dishes that caught my eye we were both set on ordering their chicken. A solid 1 hour wait time but just as we told the couple that walked in and sat next to us while we were eating- hells yes it's worth the wait.\nWe had some salmon roe stuffed potatoes to start. It was meh but that, bread, and wine held us over until the chicken arrived. \nI'm not sure if were were both starving after the long wait or if the chicken was just so damn good but we tore it up. Maybe both. It was the best tasting chicken I have ever had in my life. Even the juiciest chicken tends to get dry and a little harder to swallow but not this. I can eat this bad boy for days.

I'm not a huge fan of gnocchi (too starchy), but this was unlike any gnocchi I've ever had.  It's made with ricotta (no potato flour at all), and perhaps egg, rolled in flour, and then sauteed in a light cream and mushroom sauce.  Delicious!\n\nWe also ordered the chicken for two with bread salad, and my friend, even though not being a fan of chicken, loved it.  (I know, it's weird that we ordered two dishes that we each could potentially hate.)  The chicken is perfectly seasoned and then roasted, served on greens mixed with bread and currants.  I don't know how they make the bread, but it's crispy and soft and soak up the juices from the chicken perfectly.   It takes an hour to prepare, so you'll have to sustain yourself with bread and appetizers in the meantime.

Especially because their chicken is rated #1 on the 7x7 magazine list of 100 things you must eat in San Francisco before you die. First of all, the acoustics in in the restaurant are really bad and it is very difficult to hear the people you are sitting with. I was not a fan of the caesar salad because there were small chunks of slimy sardines in the salad dressing. Normally sardines are well blended into the dressing you shouldn't be able to pick them out. We placed our order for the chicken as soon as we sat down because it takes an hour to cook. It was a good chicken but honestly, chicken is chicken. I was wondering what they would do to the chicken to make it so much better than the roasted chickens I buy at Whole Foods for $10.00. The answer? nothing. I wouldn't pay $50.00 for a chicken again. However, the bread salad they serve it with is amazing. The dressing is wonderfully tangy and parts of the bread retain crispiness.

The menu changes 4 times per day - so note the specifics of the dish before following someone else's recommendation. We got the rabbit to start - which was the highlight of my night.

I've roasted a chicken according to the Zuni method before, and that was up with the best chook I've ever had, the white meat quite a bit better than my mother's roast chicken, thanks to the presalting; the dark meat not quite as good, thanks to oversalting. The same applied to the bird I had at Zuni, except more so. The white meat was more moist and flavorful than what I cooked, with the blast of thyme under the breast skin the highlight. The dark meat was also tastier than mine but with a weird almost seafood-like texture I was startled by. The skin was slam dunk better, thanks to the flavour imparted by the wood oven (an unfair advantage if ever there was one). I don't place a high emphasis on the bread salad, but theirs was about as tasty as mine without as much greasiness. In sum, easily the best chicken I've had that wasn't cooked by a member of my nuclear family; maybe the best of all even with nepotism working against it.\n\nSo if you're budget-restricted and you can't tell whether the Zuni chicken is worth your cash, try cooking it yourself -- the recipe is easily Googleable. If you don't think it's a significant improvement over the chicken you're used to, then save your forty-eight bucks. But if you think it's near the chicken epitome, you need to try the real thing.\n\n(Oh yeah, other food. Caesar salad and green salad excellent but not as good as I've had at Pizzaiolo and Chez Panisse Cafe respectively, though to be fair, it's tougher to get good lettuce in January. Pear tart and ice cream for dessert good but not transcendent. One of the five best restaurant meals I've had in the last twelve months.)", "author": "Brad L."}

Came here for an impromptu weekend lunch, and the experience was so horrid that I would never return.  Although the prior experience was very memorable, but mostly because the pack of businessmen that took us there.  To start off the meal, we ordered mint juleps in honor of the Kentucky Derby that we being held that day.  Took our server a long time to bring them and then it seemed like an afterthought to check to see if we wanted food.  We each ordered a starter salad and then a pizza to follow.  Several minutes elapsed and several other diners were seated around us.  Noticeably a cute daddy who had his car valeted out front.  Yes, the server was busy...and we weren't in a terrible hurry...  However I was slightly pissed when I saw taht the cute daddy and son were finishing off a wood fired pizza when we hadn't even been brought our salads.    I was boiling when I noticed that they were being served their 2nd course when we still didn't have our salads and brought it to everyones attention.  Obviously, they skipped placing our order, but no apologies followed and the salads were served to us.  When my friend dug into her salad, she noticed a BLACK HAIR nestled among the lettuce leaves.  She pointed it out to me and I dropped my fork.  We tried to discreetly point it out to the server, and he demanded to see it close up.  As if we would make up such a gross thing!  What an ass!  I mean if I was charging $13 for a lousy burger, I would show a little more class.  Did the server really want us advertising to the other tables that my friend found a hair in our salad?  I mean we were trying to be discreet so that we didn't disturb the other diners.  I was already grossed out.   Of course at this point we were both thoroughy pissed and ready to venture somewhere else.

Lots of pretty people in Pucci and Gucci posing at the bar, their Fendi bags artfully placed so there was no mistaking their heritage. Everyone swore I couldn't go wrong by ordering the chicken for two, but in the end, it was nothing more than a highly overpriced chicken that was tasty but really not worth the wait.

There are not that many places in SF that I hate, this is one of them. This is one of those few places that i veto when someone suggests to go to. One of the few that I tell my friends not to go to just just based on principles. I find these guys soo arrogant, more than any restaurant in the city and I can't figure out why. Before, they used to just be rude and obnoxious if you sat down and everyone at the table was not eating. I mean, perhaps if it is 11:30 pm, some people at the table may only want dessert or drinks cause they have likely eaten. And I would understand if you had to hold those tables because you are busy, BUT THE RESTAURANT WAS 90% EMPTY.\nWell, the last time I went (and it will be the last time period), they refused to seat us at a table unless everyone in our party was eating. It is past 11 pm, there are so many tables open, and we had to make do with these tiny little tables in the corner by the bar, and we barely got those. And then the food. No plates, obvi. that is too much to ask for and our red wine was freezing. Literally, may be my number one choice for worse restaurant in the city.\nTry walking in and ordering anything less than a full meal past 10 pm and see what happens. If I can walk into La Folie or Aqua, sit at the bar or a table and order drinks and dessert and a few apps and they still serve me with the same graciousness that one would expect from a good restaurant, I don't know why anyone would put up with the people at Zuni.", "author": "shadi m."}

The vibe is busy, hip, bright and airy and the restaurant is an odd shaped triangle, someone was creative enough to take an oddly shaped space and make it work into this multi level restaurant known for it's roasted $41 chicken, and fabulous hamburgers.  The service also was very good. \n\nIt was Easter Sunday, and amazingly at 11am we were able to get a table for 3 without a wait.  This is not to say the restaurant was empty, it was far from that, every table was filled.  But we came right at the perfect time when a party of 4 was leaving.............\n\nSo because we didn't want to wait an hour for the chicken, Brian and I  were starving and hungover, and my dad had to get back to work as it is tax season..........we all ordered a selection of about 12 oysters on the half shell, 2 orders of fries (piled mountain high) and  hamburgers.  \n\nThe oysters were delicious, yummy and fresh.  The french fries were amazing, super skinny, and the perfect amount of salt.  We ate the first plate of fries so fast, that we had to order the second plate for our burgers.  And then, the hamburgers:  AAH, they were divine. The basic hamburger comes on foccacia bread with lettuce and an aoili.  There is then a list of extras you can add, which in our case we did.  We  garnished our patties with Gorgonzola cheese and mushrooms.  But in reality, the cheese diminished the taste of the burger as it was super super strong.  The mushroom was good though.  Oh but the burger itself was amazing!  Juicy, melt in your mouth........something about that meat just put it in a different ranking from all other burgers in San Francisco--I think because it was from Niman Ranch and probably perfectly seasoned!  It was the best burger I've had in a long time, and for sure in San Francisco.   (San Diego is a different story.) \n\nI am definitely coming back to try that chicken one day when I'm not hungover and tired.

They appear to stay open pretty late, and as their cocktail list included lemon drops, margaritas, and an elderflower cocktail, I hope to come back and try something else!", "author": "Danielle J."}

I like to come here for the roast chicken - it's the best chicken I've ever had - it's juicy, tender and infused with flavor - well worth the one hour preparation time.  The dish is actually prepared for two people, which had me worried because I went with four other people who were somewhat opposed to the dish:  two of my friends are seafood-vegetarians, one friend is allergic to gluten (the chicken comes with a Tuscan-style bread salad) and another friend gave meat up for lent (how selfish of her).  I finally convinced the gluten friend to do the chicken with me, only because the restaurant accommodated us by putting the bread salad on the side.  The majority of the appetizers and entrees we had were excellent:  the crisp Zuni Caesar salad, vegetable soup, beautiful bite-sized seared scallops, sea bream in a delicious broth with shellfish, and scrumptious \"blue nose\" bass.  The only dish I was not fond of was the risotto, which seemed undercooked, bland and runny.  For dessert, we had the espresso granita, chocolate pot de crme, and chocolate cake.  All were slightly above average.\n\nService:  4 stars.  This place could easily be pretentious, but fortunately the staff is not.  Our server seemed friendly and down-to-earth, although he did not appear amused by the gag gift that my friends had brought with them, which we placed on the table.  Otherwise, service was smooth and consistent throughout the night.  The front of the house was also accommodating, especially when one of my really good friends notified me at the last minute to add another person to the table AND made us late for our reservation.  \n\nAtmosphere:  5 stars.  The restaurant's design is fascinating.  Tables are nipped and tucked in various spaces throughout.  There is a maze of rooms on the second floor, with the prime dining spots overlooking the bustling activity in the standing-room only bar or the beautiful main dining area.  The kitchen is also open for all to see.   The single-use restrooms are mislabeled \"Men\" and \"Women.\"  The patrons (both sexes) don't seem to care what's on the door.  The crowd, although an eclectic mix, is generally beautiful and decked out in their most stylish attire.  \n\nHits:  Roast chicken for two, Zuni Caesar salad, blue nose bass.\n\nMisses:  Risotto, desserts could be better.\n\nIf You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like:  Nopa, Range, Myth, Spruce, Town Hall", "author": "Keith C."}

But mine was not made with love.  I'm all about the love.

I absolutely love the layout and the views which make this place truly feel like an SF institution...that and that the fact it's been open for 30 years. The old-school long wooden bar, the brick oven, a little oyster bar in the corner, the open kitchen - all while hiking and up and down stairs to find your table nestled in a cozy room. \nWe started out with a variety of Washington and local oysters - all were amazingly sweet and delicious. (usually when you get a variety, there's always that big, briney, salty guy that ruins your palate) We then had the roast chicken and bread salad, per the 7x7 list of items to get in SF - and yes, it is simply wonderful - with an emphasis on the simply. (a mild, delicate taste - so don't expect a circus in your mouth, it's elegant.) We also had the pepper-covered rare beef and sweet potatoes - very good down to the last drop. And a polenta with marscapone, which was wonderful to have as well. \nDessert topped it off perfectly - some amazing grappa, a creme fraiche panna cotta - a perfect giggly custard, and the straciatella ice cream made with what looked like milk chocolate shavings. \nTo boot, the wine was amazing too.\nSo, why the 4 stars? It sounds pretty close to a perfect place, doesn't it? \nWell, the service was a bit harried. Our server was running around and it took him a while to get to our table so we could order. And when all you can think about it getting in that chicken order, they need to make sure they snap to it. Finally, should anyone really have to miss 13 minutes of dinner because there was a line for the bathroom? No. Please get another lou in there. This is not a night club.\n\nAdvice to future patrons - before the server even offers you water, put that chicken order in. Also, use the toilet before you're seated...or at least a good amount of time before the chicken comes out. Finally, savor the food  it is after all, delicious.", "author": "Erin M."}

I've been told the hamburger for lunch is also to die for. But that doesn't mean that everything else we had wasn't wonderful. Zuni definitely deserves its place on the SF Chronicle's Top 100 list.\n\nI loved the open-air atmosphere. Our table was on a landing that overlooked the kitchen, and we could watch the staff shucking oysters and taking roast chickens out of the oven. Fun!\n\nWe needed some help picking our selection of oysters and our wine, and our waiter made great, affordable recommendations. It's definitely worth starting with a plate of fresh oysters!\n\nThe food was all-around excellent, and the portions are a little bit on the smaller side (to me, that's actually a good thing, because you don't walk out of there feeling overly stuffed). After the oysters I had an orange salad with a pomegranate salsa which was wonderfully light, sweet and tasty. I snagged a taste of the squab on bruschetta appetizer, which was also very tasty. My main course was the New York strip steak. I am not a huge steak eater, but I was really pleased with the paper-thin cuts and that it was cooked rare/medium-rare, so it just melted in your mouth and didn't feel like a brick in your belly. Other members of our party all remarked that their main course dishes were equally good - one had the sea bass and another had the other chicken dish (wrapped in smoked bacon). For dessert I had a lemon semifreddo layered with orange sponge cake surrounded by a huckleberry sauce which was also very tasty. I snagged a bite of my boyfriend's apple tart which was equally good. \n\nThe service was excellent; I always find the sign of a good restaurant to be when your water glass keeps getting filled to the top and you don't even realize they're doing it.\n\nThe only drawbacks I would say are that they only have single-occupancy restrooms, which generally means a line for the bathroom. And the number of entrees to select from on the menu is on the smaller side. I realize that follows a more European theme, but I think it can be a bit harder to find the entree that speaks to you. There were only five or six to choose from.\n\nThere seems to be a theme among some reviews that Zuni is pretentious or has lousy service, but I didn't find either to be true. Our waiter was great and the hostess had no problem seating us early when our party arrived a little bit before our reservation time. This was on a Saturday night, too. So not sure what those complaints are about. Worth noting, however, that we did make our reservations for Zuni about three weeks in advance.

We were both starved and craving oysters so we immediately ordered 2 dozen oysters to kick the night off right. We got a mix because we entrusted our server Jeff with choosing the right kinds for us. My favorites were the kusshi (duh), and then the mix of east coast oysters. I insisted that I wanted dessert wine for dinner so Jeff brought me a selection of 3 to try and his recommendations were all on point, it was a tough decision. Without telling him he even knew what my favorite was. The guy ordered the salmon and a dry red (I wasn't interested to learn more about it because I don't enjoy dry reds), and we both thought his salmon was pretty bland and unexciting. I ordered the pork chop which was kind of hard to cut and tough on the outside but very flavorful on the inside and juicy, but not as juicy as I would have expected for a place of this caliber. It was a pretty hefty hunk of meat and the dish could probably benefit from having two separate portions the same size so the outside would not have to be cooked for so long. But who am I, Michael Bauer?!! I'll drop it because I still  scarfed it down and enjoyed every bit of it. For 3 glasses of wine, 2 dozen oysters, and 2 entrees our bill was almost $300.

We went on to have the celery-laced soup, cured anchovies and the almighty Zuni's roasted chicken. Dessert was some sort of tasty ice-cream. After the meal I felt a massive wave of nostalgia pour over me. Was it the effects of too much gewurztraminer? Was it my twenties gone by (I was now thirty-one)? And then, the answer suddenly occurred to me just as it does to the weary detective in bad detective films when he discovers the killer (montage, baby!): the soup tasked just like mom's homemade potato soup...that glorious chicken tasted just like the roasted chicken the local Lion's club used to do twice a year in my hometown...and that ice-cream...tasted...just...like...Eureka!: Chi-chi's fried ice-cream! All of my favorite foods from the past in one single meal. Hallelujah!! So why the three stars? Easy. The price of this meal at Zuni's: well over $200. Same meal back home: $12, tops.

Accordingly, avoid eating upstairs. Of course, I have to mention the burger. It's stunning. Brunch is also a fun experience.

No, I am not 143 years old, but I have managed to get sciatica none the less. Let me tell you, its wonderful! Who wouldn't love shooting pain down one's leg...all the time? Who knows, maybe next week I'll get bursitis. Oooh! Or better yet, gout!\r\nAnyway, last night I went to the symphony with a friend to see Midori - not the melon liqueur, but the famous (???) violinist. It was wonderful except for the damn sciatica. I couldn't get comfortable and with my senses distracted everything seemed a bit \"off.\"\r\n\"What does this have to do with Zuni Cafe?\" you ask.\r\nWell, here goes:\r\nAfter the symphony my friend and I walked (well, he walked, for me it was more of a hobble) to Zuni Cafe. Well actually, we were walking to catch a cab and ended up in front of Zuni Cafe and decided to just have dinner there. Neither of us had been and we both had heard people rave about it being \"one of the best\" restaurants in San Francisco.\r\nWe were seated immediately at a table near the bar. Our server was very friendly, although a bit dry. We tried to joke around with her a little and she just kind of stood there. Maybe they frown on levity. Anyway, we ordered drinks and perused the menu. For some reason, I found the menu difficult to read. I didn't quite understand how it was organized and it seemed to all run together. (That might have just been the combination of alcohol and pain killers, you decide.) So we asked for some recommendations. Recommendations were made and we ordered. At this point our server went inexplicably AWOL. Then I noticed her flirting with a hot number wearing thigh high boots at a table in the corner. Oh well.\r\nLet me say that the food was pretty mediocre. The highlight for me was my first course - the onion and sorrel soup. It had a great oniony flavor and some still crunchy homemade croutons floating around in it. This was the highlight of the meal. My friend's Caesar salad was good, but nothing special. For a second course, we split the penne at the servers recommendation. She said it was \"too rich\" for one. I really didn't feel it was rich at all. The pasta was perfectly cooked, but the flavors were nothing special.\r\nThe main courses were okay. The beef was amazingly tender, but the accompanying endive seemed to fight with the subtle flavors of the beef. The white beans were under seasoned. The bass was overcooked and the preparation of the accompanying artichoke made it very difficult for my friend to eat. \r\n\"Where the hell is the waitress? Our drinks have been at the bar melting for 5 minutes now. I hope she gets a phone number at least.\"\r\nDessert consisted of a flour-less chocolate cake (not nearly as good as the port I had to go with it) and the espresso granita (good, but very strong in flavor).\r\n\"oh look, the cell phones are out. I guess she did get a number.\"\r\nThen the bill came.\r\nI felt that this place was very overpriced for the quality of the food. Not at all deserving of being in the top 50 restaurants of San Francisco.\r\nHaving said that, the food was good, just not great. Much like my sciatic stupor, everything was just a bit \"off.\"\r\nI'm going to give this place another shot, hopefully after the sciatica is a distant memory.\r\n\"SCIATICA!!!!!!\"", "author": "Jamie M."}

First off, if you have a large party, expect to be making reservations at least 1 month in advance to get that large table...and expect to put down credit card to keep your reservations.  Also, apparently they only have 1 large table in the restaurant so you can only have your reservation at 5 PM .  Despite that, we had all been wanting to try this place so we went with it. .. got here at  4:45pm.. we were walking around all day from the Urban Air Market so we were hot and tired and we had hoped that we could get seated and start ordering drinks.. but no.. they said we will seat you promptly at 5 pm.. seesh..  anyway so we got seated.  Our waiter was quite pleasant.. we started off with drinks.  I had the balsalmic spicy bloody mary.. it was OK.. not the best bloody mary i've had but.. decent.. i donno if was $12 decent.. but ok..  my friend got the prosecco and champagne.. it was quite bubbly and you could tell they did use good alcohol in that drink... the dinner choices were pretty scarce but I guess most people are there to get the roasted chicken and warm bread salad.. we got one order to share amongtst us 10 people. each person was alloted 1 piece a about .. then we also got our own entrees.  Someone got the fried calamari and that was Delicious!  Someway.. they just make their fried calamari totally crunchy and I love the breading it was seasoned well and the calamari tasted chewy and fresh too.  Moving on.. the roast chicken was tasty very juicy and tender and salty.. but .. it IS hyped up I think.. you could definetly make a roast chicken like that at home for $10.. whereas they charge $48.. the warm bread.. it wasn't anything special either.. it was just soggy bread soaked in some chicken juices (kinda sour tasting..).   We ordered a variety of dishes for dinner...  I ordered the duck simmered in chipotle/peanuts/cinnamon.  It was pretty good, the duck ($26) itself was really tender and I really liked my dish.  My hubby ordered the pork chop, it was also good, but really plain. .. nothign really special about that dish.. it was just a pan friend pork chop ($26-28) browned and seasoned.  It was kinda actually undercooked and rare near the bone ... couldnt' eat that part. There were some veggies on the side. My brotherinlaw got the filet... and so did my sister's boyfriend.. they didnt' seem too happy with it.... being that they paid $35 for a \"filet' they thought would be a filet minon... but it was just precut for your to 5 VERY SMALL slices of beef.. yikes.. they ate a lot of bread.... my sister got the ahi tuna.. it was really small as well.. and kinda bland.

I can't count the number of times I've eaten at Zuni and I've yet to have a meal that was less than stellar. One other thing that is very unusual is that their bar staff is every bit as accomplished as the chef and wait staff. Try their Cosmopolitan - even if you don't like Cosmopolitans. All too often, high-caliber restaurants don't train the staff and hope that the food will cover for them. That's not the case at Zuni. They are unflappably cool and always gracious.

Finally the waiter said it would be better for him to just bring us a pitcher, and we just sort of agreed with him.  We got our bill and the ice tea portion of the bill was over $40.00; broken out by the per glass and picture fee.  When I asked what that was all about thinking that it was free refills the way brewed iced tea always is the waiter told us that they charge per glass, and that's why he decided to bring us the picture \"to save us money\".

This place must get rated highly either because A) diners feel nostalgic since it has been around awhile and is sort of an SF restaurant landmark, and/or B) diners simply have not dined in better restaurants and do not know what to expect from a supposed top restaurant (good menu, good food, good service, prices in line with all of the above - Zuni has none of these). \n\nStarting with the menu: short and limited, nothing exciting. Their main fish dish was salmon... wow. They advertised it as Coho salmon, however it did not look like Coho when it was served to me. They have one salad option: Caesar.... again, wow. The menu seems to revolve around their roasted chicken for two, which you have to wait an hour for and costs $48. \n\nNext: Service. Our bespectacled waiter was surly and the service was at par and lukewarm at best. At the prices they are charging, I expect better service.... at least 'act' like you are happy to still have customers willing to shell out dough for mediocre food at inflated prices. The waiter stepped on my husband's foot 3 times during the service, as if my husband's foot kept getting in the way or his work. \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant was okay, no complaints there. \n\nThey automatically add a 4% surcharge to every check to cover SF's mandatory healthcare coverage for restaurant workers. There was no justification for how they arrived at this %.   \n\nOverall, disappointing menu, mediocre food, inflated prices not on par with food quality, mediocre service.

First off the Manhattan that I ordered was fantastic.... perfectly executed with a Spicy Rye and at least 30 seconds of stirring. Bravo! I found the staff to be a bit dour....not off putting but not many smiles and no real attempt to engage. The space is great, the flowers are striking and beautiful and the atmosphere is good.\n To start we ordered some oysters that were fantastic (kusshi's i believe) We ordered the Bread Salad and Caesar Salad as apps. The Bread salad was amazing and we scraped up every last current and pine nut on the plate after the succulent chicken juice soaked bread was gone (The real highlight of the meal). I thought it was slightly under seasoned but my companions didn't and anyway, no problem there's salt on the table. The Caesar salad was meh in my opinion..but fine. For a main course we had the Pork chop and the Salmon ...and we had the rabbit loin appetizer come out with the meal ..because we had to try it. I was not blown away by either of the main courses ... I love the style ..unfussy rustic food that is really fresh and quality and executed really well ...but neither knocked my socks off. The pork loin was served with a sauerkraut and some fried polenta and was good ... honestly I didn't really get what the polenta was doing on the plate it didn't seem to tie into the dish all that well. Dont get me wrong i love polenta but  If you are going to go completely German like that just commit  and hook me up with some spatzle. The salmon was quite good and super fresh, with large white beans that were buttery and delicious. Surprisingly the rabbit app. was the hit of the main course.\n All and all I was pretty happy with my experience. I liked the food, I think it is a great example of Bay Area cuisine. I do think it is a bit pricey but really what do you expect from such an institution. The service was decent.

The food is always very good and the menu changes often. A few things on the menu don't change, however, and one is their signature dish, the roast chicken with bread salad. Consistently fantastic. If you know you want to order it, do so right off the bat when your server greets you so s/he can have the kitchen fire it -- takes about 45 minutes. If it's just two of you, split a Caesar salad and a bowl of polenta as appetizers. Zuni also has a lovely selection of oysters. The service has always been quite good and friendly. I've always loved the exposed brick walls and the copper bar. Terrific food and good people-watching as well. Highly recommended! It's also a good restaurant for a date, family gathering, dinner with friends.", "author": "Duncan M."}

The hostess looked at us like we were transients off the street, and felt as we weren't treated with the same level of respect as the other guests.

We asked him to divide each regular bowl of soup to two smaller bowls but he refused because they can't divide an egg.

Because my husband and I like to have different entrees, and because we were eating at 8PM and didn't want to wait to eat until 9PM, I felt that in effect there were only 4 choices.\n \nIt is hard for me to understand how a restaurant with so few choices can make the top Chronicle's 100 restaurant list. While I realize that specialization allows restaurants  to concentrate on what they do best, I think 4-5 entrees is taking it too far--especially at Zuni Cafe prices.

The main dishes was the famous whole chicken, pork tenderloin, and a glorified hamburger.   \n\nThe chicken, yes, it was good, but not for the price paid for.   It didn't stand out as the BEST chicken EVER as the price would make you think.  The pork was way over salty and they gave sparse amount (i was still hungry after eating it and i'm usually a light eater!).  The burger, was on a foccacia like bread , but as my husband put it \"it's just a pretty burger for $14\".\n\nSo overall the food was good, but  not outstanding.

And the food is overall very good to excellent, with some stunning mis-steps (the roasted chicken for $50ish; yes it's a signature dish, but someone is forging that signature now). \n\n The real issue at Zuni in the last several months has been the bar.  You order a drink in a quiet restaurant.  Your drink takes 10-20 minutes, because the bartender(s) have to be found, and then they have to stop talking to each other long enough to make your drink.  You order a drink in super busy restaurant, and it takes 15-30 minutes because the bartenders are (a) making drinks and (b) stopping for minutes at a time to chat with each other.   You decide to cut to the chase and order a bottle of wine.  Well, only the manager can get the bottles, and if s/he is not available, then you wait.  Possibly until you have eaten the course for which you ordered the wine.\n\nIt's a chill atmosphere, and the waitstaff is generally friendly and knowledgeable.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-09-17", "description": "I have to say that, given the mixed reviews below, I might not have chosen Zuni had I read them in advance of venturing to the city.  Thankfully, I didn't read them.\n\n  Of course, the space itself has its charms, from the copper bar to the way-too-crowded dining rooms with uncomfortable seating which would be a huge knock on a new restaurant, but the place shows its age in many ways, and the seating does hearken back to San Fran in the 70's and 80's, a simpler time when cushioned booth seating was not the standard. (How's that for a run-on sentence?)  The open kitchen adds to the charm as well.  We were seated promptly, as long as we promised not to linger for more than about 1 hr 45 min due to a reservation (we had none).  Fair enough.\n\n  The menu is shockingly brief, with a few rotating daily selections (fish, pizza) as well as some seasonal items and the old stalwarts of hamburger and the legendary chicken.  An amazing seafood \"raw bar\" menu is also available.  As we were a bit pressed for time, needing to get back to Sacramento at a decent hour, we thought about ordering the bird, but both the menu and our waiter cautioned that it takes a good hour to get to the table.  We grudgingly opted out of the chicken.  Turned out, it was a good choice for us.  A couple at the next table had ordered it, and it really did take an hour.  Maddeningly, they had a direct view of the kitchen, where they saw the bird resting (or languishing, depending on one's perspective) on the cutting board for a virtual eternity.  Seems that the bird actually roasts for 40 minutes, but rests for an additional 20.  Culinarily, this is the right thing to do; I do it myself at home.  However, in a busy restaurant where the chicken is a huge seller, why not just fire a bird or two every half hour?  The likelihood that it will sell is almost 100%, and customers will wait a lot less, resulting in both happier clientele and faster table turnover, i.e. a win-win for patron and proprietor.  Oh well, forewarned is forearmed.\n\n  The meal that we did order was just great.  Oysters were presented simply and were impeccable.  A lettuce and beet salad was perfect, with museum-quality lettuce and a sublime tarragon vinaigrette.  The Zuni Caesar ought to be in the Smithsonian in an argon-filled chamber as an example of what this near-universally desecrated dish was meant to be.\n\n  Entrees included a brine-cured pork chop, which was seasoned perfectly and juicy throughout, and the house burger, which, while less \"classic\" in execution than the Caesar, was no less on-point.  Dessert was a deep, rich chocolate cake for her, and a simple cheese plate for me.  Everything was just right, period.  \n\n  As previous reviewers have noted, the service is a bit lacking.  Our server appeared constantly rushed, though he was never rude or inconsiderate.  Just think of it as bistro service and it becomes tolerable, almost charming in keeping with the energy of the place.  Drinks and water were attended to promptly.  By the way, this is one place where you should forget what your mother told you and DO load up on bread; Zuni's comes from Acme and is an experience in itself.", "author": "Nate S."}

We just walked in with no reservation, but they were able to seat us at the small tables around the bar.\n\nThe restaurant's interior is very nice. We sat adjacent Market Street so there was a lot of interesting stuff to see outside. They also had a live piano player which added to the ambiance.\n\nThe food was good with some strong spots and one big weak point.\n* They started us with bread. I really don't care for their bread. It's a denser sourdough with a fairly tough crust (with some serious chew). Not my cup of tea breadwise. But that's fine. Some folks like this style of bread. I prefer crustier fare. But the upshot is that I didn't fill up on bread.\n* We started with little neck clams and a smattering of oysters. They were served raw with some shallot vinagrette. I like my oysters/clams straight up, so I didn't use the condiment. The seafood was very fresh had that wonderful ocean brinyness and came from Tomales Bay and the Humboldt Coast according to the menu. Really good stuff.\n* I ordered the grilled pork chop dish for myself. The pork chop was excellent. Very thick (2 inches? Maybe more). It's was tender and well seasoned and the pork flavor was very good, very intense. The chop was accompanied by two sweet potatoe medallions and a mound of grilled raddichio. Presentation was simple as were the preparations. Clearly this style of cooking is about straight-forward flavors with quality ingredients. \n* My daughter had the ricotta salata pizza. This was the big disappointment. I realize Zuni isn't a pizza joint, but if you're going to put something on your menu I'd hope it's good. This pizza was probably 2 stars, maybe 3 (if I was feeling charitable). Fortunately I have a small appetite so I was able to share the delectable pork chop with my disappointed kid.\n\nWe were too full for dessert, so we didn't even see what they had on the menu wrt sweets. \n\nStill, on the basis of the shellfish and the pork chop alone, I'm giving Zuni 4 stars. The pork chop was really stellar. I don't often get to taste such a deeply rich pork flavor in a pork chop like that. I'm sure they must be lining up the quality vendors for their meat products.\n\nMy only other gripe with Zuni -- one that made me consider going to 3 stars -- is that it seems to be a tad overpriced. So you may be able to find a better value. But I'll definitely return at some point for another meal.", "author": "David P."}

Surprisingly, all of us were disappointed.  The biggest failure was the over-hyped $48 whole roast chicken, which was good but not great.  Oddly, the chicken was served not on vegetables, but on a bed of baked bread squares, which was pretty ridiculous, considering that we'd already been served a huge (delicious) bread basket which was consumed during the 40 minutes of waiting for the chicken.  In addition, there were no vegetable sides listed on the menu (unless you count potatoes), nor was there a vegetable plate or vegetarian option.  When we asked for one, the waitress said she'd have the kitchen make up a veggie plate for us.  With the exception of very good, caramelized brussels sprouts, the rest of the vegetables were either undercooked or forgettable.

I was celebrating life at that moment, so, what better place to celebrate life than a nice dinner at a nice restaurant. I walked in and went up to the hostess to see if she had a table for one. She smiled and said she did. I asked if I could have the little corner table next to the side door/Market Street side, where I could watch the hustle and bustle of Market Street. The hostess was fantastic to accomodate me at the last minute, and with a smile no less! After just a few minutes, a really nice waitperson came up with a very warm smile and welcomed me to the restaurant. She offered me a drink and gave me the run-down on the food served, all with such a warm, honest, pleasant demeanor amidst such a busy night. I had the gnocci which was very different from the usual gnocci: cheesy goodness!!!! The thing is this: the food is delicious, and I was going to take the time to give a thorough review of the food, but what overtook the delicious food was the excellent service. If you want to park it here for a while and go where you can feel welcomed and warm, after a long day at work, this is the place to go. Everyone, from the hostess, to the waitperson, to the busperson, was perfect. And the fries were to DIE for.", "author": "Julien N."}

In the last 2 months or so something has happened and its gone downhill.\n\nOrdered their gnocchi, which arrived smelling richly of eggs.  They looked like swollen egg yolks, and tasted just like yolks that have been boiled.  They smelled pretty gross.  Others at the table thought the same after sampling: \"simply disgusting.\" $12.\n\nOne thing everyone know about zuni is that you get the ceasar, or the roast chicken, or if its late, get the $15 burger.  Arriving after 10 on a Saturday, I was told they were out of hamburger. Ok.... So I got a $26 chicken dish.  It was good, but no better than something my wife and I can make, the portion was small and full of little tiny bone fragments which were only discovered after popping a piece. For $26 give me a lot of chicken with some bones, or a little piece that doesn't have surprises of cartiledge and ribs.  Total rip-off. I mean, chicken for $26?\n\nThe waiter forgot my wifes $5 fries. He admitted it and they came 10 minutes after I finished my dinner (and that was after politely waiting for another 10).  Well, I thought, surely they will take this little item off the bill, which has happened many times at other well-regarded restaurants. Nope, not in Zuni's case.  And the fries were hard little sticks.  Coul have been from a bag.\n\nWe ordered the \"lamb's lettuce salad with parsley, pepper rubbed croutons blah blah\"  It came and I thought I was at Denny's.  A few leaves of lettuce, some dressing, and that was it.  For $10. Come on.  At least at chez panisse that could pull that off. But not here.\n\nBefore dinner my wife asked the bartender for a recomendation with rum (they have no cocktail menu). He thought about this for about 10 seconds and offered, \"Rum Gimlet?\"  Uh, you're the bartender at zuni right, not a college party-goer? Hm.

Though my dish was delicious, D's pork chop was fantastic. It melted in your mouth and paired beautifully with the apple sauce. It was so simple and rustic, but beautifully cooked. For dessert we shared the flourless chocolate cake, which was incredibly light and moist. The bread served before the meal was probably my only complaint about the meal.

The lighting and ambiance were perfect. \n\nThe bread was so good. I know it seems obvious to mention good bread in an SF restaurant, but this really was amazing. The wine list was extensive and I was able to find a really good bottle of Pinot for a very reasonable price. We ordered the gnocchi and fried beans and veggies for an appetizer. The gnocchi had an unusual flavor that I did not care for, but the fried garbanzo beans were shockingly amazing. The texture was really light and airy and they didn't feel too heavy. I decided to do it right since this was my first visit by ordering and patiently waiting for the chicken. Again, the bread stuffing accompaniment was amazing and the chicken was the most juicy thing  I have ever tasted. AMAZING. The steak and bass, also ordered at my table, were cooked to perfection and the flavors were spot on.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-11-04", "description": "Zuni is a pretty solid restaurant.  I think it rests on its laurels far less than Chez Panisse, to whom I've given three stars for some sloppy cooking and service.  To me, this place is like the Susan Sarandon of SF restaurants.  Sure, there are a lot of hottie starlets that catch the eye, but Susan is still very attractive and very sexy, with the confidence of an older woman who knows what's what; she can show her serious acting chops in \"Dead Man Walking\" but also do light fare (ok, schlock) like the \"Banger Sisters.\"  Zuni knows what it can do well--roast chicken, whole leaf Caesar, gnocchi, gateau victoire--and does them well without fucking around with trendy preparations and ingredients to draw in the crowds.  Zuni's Cali-Itali food suits serious, intimate dates or semi-raucous feasts with friends or a leisurely lunch alone, which explains a wide variety of people who fill the place day after day.\n\nThe restaurant space itself is a crazy quilt of odd-shaped rooms that can be frustrating or just right.  Some tables are tucked away in a corner perfectly, but sometimes you may find a steel beam between you and a dining companion at a table that's a crazy polygon custom cut to fit in a place that was probably not meant for a table.  Personally, I prefer to sit downstairs and will specify so when I make the reservation.  If you don't know the space, there's a good chance you might be unhappy with your table (don't wanna scare you, but it's true); try to be specific about your occasion if you don't want to end up at the table that's wrong for you.  \n\nThe food can be spectacular to satisfactory.  I tend to stick to the Zuni classics and I don't get disappointed.  My most favorite thing here is the Caesar salad made with whole romaine leaves, which I like to eat with my fingers.  The dressing is perfectly garlicky and anchovy-y and I always meticulously swab every molecule of it with the bread at the end.  The salad usually gets split between me and someone else; there isn't a time I didn't semi-regret I didn't eat the whole thing.  The roast chicken is legendary, but I don't order it since I now have the Zuni recipe and it'll cost 1/4 of what I'd pay at the restaurant.  Their stealth menu item is the ricotta gnocchi, which are the lightest cloud-pillows from dreamland.  It's not filling at all so you will inevitably have to dig into a snack after coming home, but the wonderment of eating something so ethereal and substanceless made of cheese and potatoes is worth it.  And even though the flourless chocolate cake thing has been done to death, the gateau victoire is still one of my favorites.  Also, their specialty cocktails are worth a try, too, though they have a pretty good wine list.\n\nThe service here can be efficient or it can be a hair short of disaster.  I've had great servers who never missed a beat, if a tad stodgy in their ways.  But I've had a mess of a server, for example, who entirely forgot to place our cold seafood platter order with the seafood bar, then was quite annoyingly flippant about it when she showed up with our entrees and we asked what happened to our appetizer.  This--unlike the seating which can be pre-arranged somewhat--is entirely up to the luck of the draw.", "author": "maiko h."}

The ambiance is fantastic, great wine list, great oysters, and the roast chicken is to die for.   My boyfriend, however, feels similar to the naysayers on this list.  What can I say, I think it lives up to the hype.  It's the quintessential SF restaurant, to me.  I have read a few reviews, though, that say that the first time dining at the restaurant was disappointing, but at the 2nd visit, it became clear why the place is such a legend.  *shrug* so, you may want to give it another chance.", "author": "Liz C."}

Moved to Marin and have eaten here a handful of times since then. Last night, we came in a group - 9 persons - at  8:45pm. WE asked to be seated together and they refused to accommodate us. The hostess refused to put 2 tables together saying \"it's just not done\" I asked if the tables were glued together but no, they are not.  There was another table next to these two and they still refused to do anything particularly since they actually put the first two tables together after all. So, 4 sat apart.  \nThe food was okay. Nothing exciting. The gnocchi was good but I've defintely had better gnocchi nudi in Italy, the burger was dry and unexciting considering there are tons of amazing burger places all over town, Caesar salad was okay, everything was so-so. Our waiter was great but the bus boy kept removing plates even when one of us was still eating away. Amazing....\nSo, okay food plus horrible reception equals never again!

Didn't get two of the entr\u00e9e orders into kitchen so everyone was done w/ food before theirs came.  Comp'd us all deserts do to the problems but food was small, and bland and both orders of the roasted chicken were overcooked, and dry with the chicken portion dwarfed by a pile of stale bread soaked in grease -- labeled a Tuscan bread salad. so really not worth the hassle especially since there are so many awesome places to eat in the bay area.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-27", "description": "I have heard tell of the Zuni burger for quite a while now. Not available on the dinner menu, the burger is available from 10-12 Friday and Saturday nights for those of us who choose to drink and then eat.  I stopped in at 1030 last night to experience the burger after some vino at Hotel Biron (which I love). \n\nOverall Burger Rating: 8/10\nBurger: The burger was perfectly cooked medium rare. The beef was good and I am sure from some small village where they pray to the cows every day before shoveling triple cream fondue down their gullets and offering them afternoon cocktails of Dom Perignon prior to their massages.\nBun: This was a cause of controversy, as the burger is served on Foccacia bread. My burger tasting partner loved the foccacia. I, on the other hand, had issues with the burger sliding out of the foccacia, which resulted in uneven bites of burger. Also, the foccacia made my fingers oily. \nToppings: The usual preference of cheddar was unavailable, so I was forced to order the burger with Gruyere and grilled onions. While the Gruyere didn't have quite the zip that I prefer with cheddar, it was fine. The grilled onions had a nice vinegary bite to them, but they were so thickly cut that they fell off the burger and onto my plate more often than is to my liking.\nSides: The french fries were crispy and awesome. Shoe string thickness and piled like a foot high. We shared an order and argued over whether they were the best fries in SF, or simply number #2 (I feel like Balboa Cafe's are better).\nNotes: Each burger was 17.50 and the side order of fries was six bucks. So even sharing, this burger experience well exceeded 20$ per person, which makes this burger the most expensive that we have had in the city. Certainly, a nice splurge for an insider food experience, but not enough for me to bypass the chicken for two the next time that I find myself at Zuni.", "author": "Matt C."}

Sent back the fishy smelling King Salmon, served barely warm, a strange thin strip of salmon served with beets; no apologies, no nothing; our server could have cared less, the Hangar steak was not much better.  Obviously the meat sat a long while before it was brought to our table.  We had already eaten our two measly thin slices of  bread while waiting 30 minutes for our main entrees, and the server looked pained when we asked for more, really?

That not only made me incredibly curious, but it set the expectations high. I needed to eat this chicken. Let me just say that he was right. It took an hour to prep this chicken, but it was definitely worth the wait. It was probably one of the best chicken dinners I've ever had. Better than the half chicken at Limon.  7x7 should put this in their \"100 things to try before you die.\" It was incredible. Cooked with breadcrumbs, scallions, currants and pine nuts, it has a suculent, juicy flavor to each bite. One of those meals that turns heads every time someone orders. One of those meals that makes you say \"mmmm so good\" without even thinking. One of those meals that remind you of those great family holiday dinners that made you wait impatiently for the food to be cooked. While you wait for your amazing chicken, try their squid stew and tomato soup appetizers. Zuni is a place--despite it's price--that will keep you coming back for more. Will keep you curious to try new things, despite how tempting it will be to order chicken again. Zuni is a great space, intimate, inviting. It will not disappoint.", "author": "Alex H."}

When the hostess brought us to our table and I knocked over my wine getting in (yes, I'm a natural born klutz), they whisked away the table setting, cloth etc. and redid it all in half a minute. Then they replaced the wine I spilled with another glass. Our waiter was super friendly and helped us navigate the choices--I can't eat gluten and my husband is vegetarian. He gave a really good description of the various oysters and I sampled several based on his recommendations--they were spot on and I greatly enjoyed them. My husband loved their version of french fries: very finely sliced and crunchy. They didn't have a large number of choices for him that night, but he was more in the mood for small plates anyway and they had several nice sides/salads, etc. that he enjoyed. They also had some great wines. The best part was the dessert. Usually I'm lucky if I can get creme brulee on the menu; typically desserts are a wheat-filled desert for me. Zuni had a flourless chocolate cake that was to die for, and my husband got the tiered merengue dish (which naturally I sampled, since it was also gluten free). They also had sorbet, ice cream and creme brulee, so I had lots of very tasty choices.

I can't believe the consistent pleasure i get from the food at Zuni, and i'm so thankful for it. Tonight, dining solo, I had cold roasted leg of lamb with gribiche (perfectly lambie and not too gamey) with beets and salad (perfectly dressed). it was absolutely delicious. this was accompanied by a glass of billecart brut as were the sensual Bellwether Farm Ricotta Gnocchi with Nettles and Lemon Oil.  God, they just melt away in your mouth...and everytime i have the ricotta gnocchi, i have to force myself to stop....leave some...and leave room for the other courses.  Sadly, when i'm all alone, i can't have too much food and there are always tons of items on the menu that i know i would have adored.  Tonight, for having chosen the lighter dinner, and not opted for the Italian style beef pot roast which was beckoning strongly on this cold and wet night, i rewarded myself with dessert, and ohhhhh was i rewarded. Recently, i have been reminded of something i once told my family a long time ago when we were dining at Chez Panisse for the first time...That in my opinion, a great chef/restaurant was one that could make you love something that you thought you hated. At some point since then, I lost that outlook, and started ordering only my favorites at my favorite restaurants, rarely adventuring into lesser knowns. This was due to the fact that i work nights, and so when i go out for dinner, i want to be happy, guaranteed. Well, sure, i was at one of my favorite restaurants, but this time i didn't get the guaranteed pleasers: espresso granita, nor the chocolate pot de creme, nor the biscotti, nor anything else except for the pine nut tart with creme fraiche ice cream.   Now, here's the deal...I hate pinenuts, and there is really nothing in the food world that i hate, but i HATE pinenuts, and this tart was sooooo good.  the ice cream was perfect as well. it was tangy and not too sweet, the essence of creme fraiche... and the delamain  i had to finish everything taught me a lesson:  wonderful cognac doesn't have to be the most expensive one on the list. the delamain is so pretty. now that i've loosened my ties a little, i think that next time i'll try one of the grappas. hopefully, next time i eat at zuni; they will have something that i am not very fond of so that i can be converted to it too.", "author": "sarah C."}

Have a cocktail to go with it.  You will want for nothing else.  But here's my question--and I wonder if I am the only one who wonders this.  Once the waiter points to each variety of oyster and gives you its name, do you really care?  Does it really make a difference?

Wifey got about the tiniest dirty martini I've ever seen, and I had an equally wee little Manhattan. $25 for two drinks containing less booze than I get in my neighborhood dive is not a good thing. \n\nWe were pretty hungry and were very happy to be seated once we settled our bar bill. \n\nWe ordered some oysters, periwinkles, and a plate of \"house cured sardines\" with cheese &amp; kalamata olives. For our entree, we decided to split the much vaunted roast chicken for two, with their famous bread salad. \n\nThe oysters, periwinkles, and sardines were lovely and reasonably priced. The roast chicken takes an hour to roast (no par-cooking at Zuni, I guess), which is a good thing because we were pretty full after our appetizers, but by the time the chicken came, we were hungry again. \n\nNow, about the chicken. An hour wait, a cost of $48, and the unflinching praise of an entire culture of foodies, means this has better be seriously good chicken. \n\nAll I can say is, it's chicken. It was juicy. The skin was nicely colored and nice and salty (though the flesh was fairly bland). I do not know what all the hubub about this dish is.

Parking... we got pretty lucky to find a spot on Market/Gough. Walked into the restaurant and it was huge from left to right and up. The ambiance is nice and up-scale, and I heard that this place has been in business since the 80's.\n\nIt gets chilly in there when they have th windows open all over, so definitely bring something warm to wear. And while we were not able to pre-order the chicken when the hostess called to confirm the reservation, we were able to order it when we walked into the restaurant prior to getting seated, to save us 15 minutes.\n\nWe were seated upstairs over the oyster bar with a view of the kitchen so we could see how all the food was prepared. Our server was really nice and offered recommendations to try (although it was borderline pushy just to sell additional items i.e. \"You can't order 10 oysters, that's like bad luck. You have to get a dozen\" or the \"You must get the spaghetti!\" and \"I can't believe you're not getting dessert!\"). So what we ended up ordering were 12 oysters (which were all high quality and awesome, though at least $3+ each). We got the spaghetti which did come with fresh tomatoes, but i'm not the type who likes my pasta al dente, or slightly hard.  The roasted chicken was another story, which was enough for our table of 4... and was so juicy and tender, and when eaten with the homemade stuffing. Yum. I never order chicken in restaurants but when it's known for the chicken, you know you have to get it. We also got two orders of the halibut. Perhaps due to the meatiness of the type of fish, we weren't blown away. But the sauce gave it a nice flavor.\n\nProbably giving this place only 3 stars because I don't feel the need to come back again...but it was a good experience overall.", "author": "Jeanne C."}

Anyway, the actual burger/meat was outstanding, you could tell it was ground in Zuni's kitchen and that it was a high quality beef, but the rest of the burger really takes away from the meat. First off, the focaccia was a poor choice for a bun, and it couldn't stand up to the juiciness of the burger, and as a result,  the bun turned into mush. My other major issue with Zuni's burger is the price to value. Here's the thing, if you want to charge $15-$20 for a burger you should back-up the price, and not be skimping on the ingredients. I added the grilled onions ($1.75), the blue cheese ($2.00) and the heirloom tomato's ($2.50) which brought my burgers total to $21.25. Now, the price itself is bad enough, but its even worse when I can't taste the blue cheese, tomato's, or grilled onions... I mean, come on, they are $0.20 ingredients which you are marking up at least 5x, there is no need to ration them. Zuni's house made pickles are great, and believe it or not, don't cost extra $$. Their shoestring fries ($6) are also very good. The oyster selection is quite good, and everything was very fresh.

I had lusted for the chicken, and after the hour wait (i am completely in love w/ chicken), my friend and I received a dish that was 1. undercooked and 2. tasteles.  My friend that I was with said that he had had it before and it was really good, however, on this occasion, I am pretty sure that I could produce something more edible from an easy bake oven.

After reading everyone's reviews, I was really excited to try their famous chicken.  In a nutshell, our experience was just OK.  We started off with the oysters which were absolutely fabulous.  Very fresh and yummy.  Appetizers...check.  The menu says that it takes about an hour for the chicken to cook.  I though that it couldn't possibly take that long because everyone said that it was an average of 40 mins but it actually took a little longer than an hour.\n\nWe had the chicken and the shoestring potatoes.  The shoestrings were very yummy but the chicken, I wasn't really that impressed.  it was just alright. It was a little on the salty side.  Everyone around was oohing and ahhing over their chicken and we were excited to do the same thing but  no luck.  It didn't happen.  I think my mom makes better chicken in her turbo cooker.\n\nFor dessert we had the espresso granita (took a few of your recommendations) and that was just alright too! It tasted like those coffee candies that are in the shape of a coffee bean and comes in a circular tin.  I was really said that my meal ended with this.  \n\nI don't know if I'll ever come back.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-11-24", "description": "I did not realize how large Zuni is. The street entrance leads towards a long copper bar, staffed by people who really know what they're doing and how to welcome you to their spot. Once again, I was running a bit late meeting my parents for dinner. I met them and ordered a glass of Henriot Brut Souverain, which they comped. Maybe it was Thanksgiving generosity, or more likely my dad was working the schmooze earlier. Either way it was a nice gesture, and the Henriot was a tasty drink - crisp and a bit austere as always, lemony with a touch of red currant fruit. Not exciting champagne, but reliable and a great apertif. Zuni looks sort of like an upscale version of a large brewpub, with high expansive ceilings, lots of open space and distressed wood floors. Upstairs, the space is very cleverly broken up into several different smaller dining areas, which helps to keep the noise down and adds a sense of privacy. Our table was directly above the oyster bar. To start we had a bottle of Roland Schmitt Sylvaner, which was round, slightly creamy and tasted like baked apples and a hint of peach. Tasty and cheap. I had an order of roasted sardines, which were fine but not a standout. Salads were fresh and lightly dressed the way I like 'em. For the main course I had ordered a bottle of 2005 Lapierre Morgon - which was a good bit richer and more generous than I had anticipated it. Also considerably lower in acidity, which is too bad. One of my favorite cru Beaujies I have ever had was a Desvignes Morgon 'Javennieres' from the same 2005 vintage; it was much tighter but also a much more interesting wine.\n\nFor my main I ordered the much heralded roasted chicken to split with my mom - it was just ok. Back when I lived in DC, I would often judge a restaurant based on how flavorfully and originally they could prepare a plain old chicken dish. It was fun, and actually a good indicator of the overall quality of the cooking. Well, once again the chicken test worked, as I found Zuni to be pretty good, but not all that great. Definitely a good lunch spot, though. For dinner it's ok as well- if the location is convenient - and if someone else is handling the tab.", "author": "joe m."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-04-01", "description": "So on extremely high recommendations by my culinary conneisseur of a friend, we decided to go to Zuni Cafe to taste the workings of chef Judy Rogers.  Now, I was prepared to be blown away, and in some sense I was, but perhaps my expectations were on the wrong page.  Of course, being a cafe, I ought not to have expected anything super fancy or gourmet, but enjoyable nonetheless.  Wait staff was quick and our waiter was very, very friendly.  \n\nOk, so onto the food, the important stuff, the reason people usually go to restaurants.  Now, we went for lunch and we decided that we wanted to go for all the stuff that Zuni's was supposed to be known for, so in the end, we got; the burger, caesar salad, shoe string potatoes, and of course the puportedly \"world's best roasted chicken\".  So let's start with the salad, it was good, a little heavy on the anchovy taste, but it's supposed to be how an original caesar was made, it was a very refreshing salad (and the croutons were amazing).  The burger was pretty much just a burger (but hand ground on the spot), they seem to like making simple foods, and somehow glorifying it, such as serving it on rosemary foccacia with zuccini and onion essentially pickled in wine vinegar (they really like using wine vinegar).  The shoe string potatoes were honestly, something of a waste of money, imagine basically In-N-Out fries (I feel for those who have not had the wonders of In-N-Out) shredded even thinner, not exactly what I'd pay six bucks for.  Finally we come to the chicken, now, having heard it was the \"world's best\" I had some pretty high standards going in, and of course, I think I over-hyped it.  Now, I have to admit, the chikcen was good, it was a simple roasted chicken served on a bed of bread salad, basically oversized croutons (or more specifically Tuscany bread soaked and baked in a champagne vinegar with salad).  I have to say, the bread salad was amazing, simply amazing, I loved the flavoring.  The chicken, while slightly charred on the skin, was actually the most juicy and tender chicken I've ever had.  Through simple roasting, I've never had a piece of white meat with that much juice still in it.  I think it was quite worth the wait, and it actually came a little faster than I thought it would.  Just make sure you get something else in addition to that to space out your meal.  Overall I thought that while slightly disappointing, Zuni's is a good place to eat.  A little on the expensive side of course (add in $10 for valet parking), it takes very straightforward simple fare, and prepares it to excellence.  While I don't want to overhype it, I don't want to say it's utter trash either, it's really very good.", "author": "Jonas C."}

Each time, the food and experience were fantastic.  My first visit was a few years ago.  My boyfriend at the time and I stopped in for a late dinner after a free recital at the SF Conservatory of Music.  I  had a filet of halibut or sea bass that was cooked perfectly.  My companion had the ricotta gnocchi, which he thought was too eggy, but he is especially sensitive to egg.  More recently, I went to Zuni with two friends to celebrate their engagement.  We tried to call and pre-order the roast chicken (for my friends), but the staff said that they could only take our order once we were seated.  No problem, we snacked on delicious shoestring fries and olives while waiting for our mains.  I had the spaghetti with sweet and spicy peppers which was very flavorful.  Late last night (about half an hour before closing), a friend and I dropped in for dessert and drinks.  There was only one chocolate dessert on menu - the gateau victoire (which I'd shared with my friends on my previous visit) - so we ordered that since my friend was in the mood for something chocolatey.  It was an interesting experience sipping on wine and rye while looking out onto Market  Street through Zuni's large glass windows - I felt very much like was in San Francisco (sometimes, that feeling evades me).

There was also a wedding reception of some sort seated upstairs which was a bit annoying, but the wait staff was perfect and attentive nonetheless. \n\nI have to admit, I was not raised on a diet of foie gras, oysters and caviar, so I always feel a tad uncomfortable in restaurants that serve these things.  Being one of the only brown people in the restaurant besides the busboys and dishwashers can do that to a person.   Inferiority complex aside, the food here was really amazing.  The oyster menu was extensive and were were able to try some from Washington that we never had before.  All of the menu items looked yummy, but we decided on the roast chicken for two (which we ordered right away as it really does take an hour to make).  The hour seems to go by fast especially with the help of some appetizers.  The chicken was cooked to perfection.  The skin was perfectly crisp and buttery and the chicken was moist and tender.  I think that wood burning oven is magic. The bread salad that it came with was also amazing, though some of the bread pieces didn't seem to be soaked well in the vinaigrette and were hard and crunchy which mostly made me sad because I wanted more of it!\n\nThe price of the meal with steep but it was surprisingly a bit cheaper than some places in the East Bay I have been to.

Zuni has been at the top of my list of restaurants to try and finally when we got there, my optimism kept getting squashed.\n\nOur server was highly uneducated in everything that is food and wine. She seemed completely uninterested in our excited questions about the halibut vs. the salmon, different dishes, which Chardonnay was buttery (c'mon, easiest question ever.) She was like \"salmon? what salmon?\" There were about 4 Chardonnays on the wine list. One was $30 one was $50 and the next was $88 and more were above that. The $50 wine was out, so we were stuck with basically a crappy wine or an almost $100 bottle. We got the expensive one and it was NOT worth it. It just left a bitter taste in our mouths. Literally and figuratively. The roasted chicken does take a full hour. Fine, great, we'll order appetizers. Our salads came after 45 minutes... our entrees were good, absolutely nothing compared to other restaurants in the city. And they didn't bring out a final dish until a good 5 minutes after the other ones were served. Restaurant Etiquette 101, Zuni. Come on. We ordered dessert, the only thing we wanted was out of course, so we ordered a piece of pie. There were 4 of us, and we LITERALLY got 1 bite. Also, one of my food idols writes in her cookbook about how she always goes to zuni when she's in SF. So I asked if they'd ever seen her, she said she'd ask around. 45 minutes later I asked her again and she had no idea what i was talking about. I asked someone else and he was totally uninterested. \n\nI am tempted to give this another try but I'm not happy about our $350 meal that I really would value at $200 maximum.

So we booked a reservation for dinner on a Friday night.  Even at 6:30, the place was packed!  \n\nBar - drinks are tiny!  One of the smallest martini glasses I have ever seen served at a bar.  If it was any smaller it could have been a Christmas tree ornament.\n\nFood - it's okay, not fabulous.  All of our dishes were okay, but didn't live up to our expectations.  I wouldn't come back unless a really good friend wanted to try it out or someone was paying for me!  \n\nWine & Drinks - wine menu is very limited for a San Francisco restaurant.  There are more Scotch options than wines!  We brought our own bottle and paid the $20 corkage fee.\n\nNoise level - too loud for dinner!  Even at our small table of four, we had to raise our voices to be heard by the rest of our party.\n\nParking - valet parking is available, so that's nice.\n\nPrice - reasonable, but there are plenty of other restaurants that are much better within the same price range\n\nService - a bit quirky.  Some of the other reviewers mentioned how aloof their server was, and I have to say that our server was a bit aloof.  Not mean or rude, just aloof.  The hostesses were very friendly and greeted us pleasantly upon arrival and wished us a good evening at departure, but our server was aloof.  It's like he didn't want to be there!  We couldn't get the guy to even crack a small smile!\n\nI'm glad we finally tried out Zuni, but we won't be going back anytime soon.

As mentioned below the roasted chicken is a classic and should be order immediately upon seating (it takes 45 minutes or so to cook the bird).  The caesar is excellent and one order is plenty for two people.  The burger is one of the best in the city, although reasonable minds can differ as to whether the bread/bun is a proper to hold the burger together.  The pork chop, when it is on the menu, is to die a must if you like a good chop.  The oyster selection is diverse and as fresh as anything you would find at the ferry building.  The wine list is stale and boring.  The upstairs seating in the \"little room\" is too stuffy, asked to be seated downstairs for the people watching.  The service can be hit or miss, I have a few fav. servers that are amazing but zuni seems to have a high turnover of staff and its a crap shoot sometimes.  (on a completely random sidebar there is this new girl with short brown hair that is, how shall I put it, very easy on the eyes, have no idea how she is as a server though)\n\nAbove all this place rocks because 1) it seats diners until 11 pm, 2) regulars get seated faster than randoms, 3) its a 3 minute walk from my pad.\n\nSpecial shout out to Ren (host) for always hooking me with the best table available.

We first looked over the dessert menu before being seated, and the manager was kind enough to go over each dessert ---a definite plus for service! After the detailed descriptions, we decided to try the desserts.  I must say the Bittersweet Chocolate Pot de Creme was excellent-- great recommendation! Our other friends tried the Gateau Victoire (dark chocolate cake with whipped cream) & the Pot de Creme as well (they liked it). My boyfriend got the Quince sorbet-- he didn't really care for the tartness & told our server that when asked.  When our server brought our bill, he didn't charge us for the sorbet.  We thought that was a nice gesture-- so thats why I give five stars for the service & especially for the Bittersweet Chocolate Pot de Creme! \n\nI have not tried the food there, but if its as good as the dessert... then I say its worth a visit.

The server took my wine order while I waited and was very friendly and accommodating. My friend and I debated between the famous Roasted Chicken with Bread Pudding and the Halibut. I took off half a star because our server was very, VERY nice but not very helpful with ordering. We needed help making food and wine choices and she just kept saying in a nice way that everything is good. Maybe I'm being too picky, but I love a good recommendation (I'm sure I would've been happy if she had said either). We ended up with the chicken and were not disappointed. I've been craving it ever since! It was juicy and delicious and the bread salad was to DIE for. It took every minute of the hour that the server warned us about--but we knew that going in so I can't complain. The other half star off is for slightly high prices. But it is SF after all.

First off, our waiter was beyond pretentious and his smile was just so affected that I cringed every time he came to the table, which wasn't very often, by the way.  Next, the apps were good, but not great - 3 stars for this.  We ordered the chicken for 2, as did others at our table.  I took my first bite of the bread pudding, and it tasted like formaldehyde.  I was like, \"huh?\" and decided to try again.  Yep, every bite (crispy end or soggy middle) had that taste.  I checked out my friend's and it was the same.  I think it was maybe the vinegar dressing reacting with the sourdough or something.  The mustard greens were huge pieces that added bitterness to the formaldehyde taste of the bread.  So, I moved on to the chicken.  The chicken was juicy, a little smokey, and well cooked, but I couldn't escape that weird taste entirely.  Overall, a rather unenjoyable entree.    The chicken at Range is infinitely better.  The desserts were good, but they ran out of the roasted plum ice cream and served us strawberry ice cream and tried to argue with us that it was plum until later the cheesy waiter came back and told us, yep, we were right, \"it is strawberry, they just told me we ran out of plum.\"   I don't know, the apps and desserts were maybe a 3 stars, the ambience was a 4 or 5, but the off-putting flavor of the entree (which is the reason we went) made it a 0.

Where was the flavor, texture, and aroma I was hearing about. I was very disappointed. I tried to make the best of the situation and requested some sauces to mask the dry and chewy texture. I asked for some sauce or gravy to make up for the dryness. The waiter tried to give me some olive oil and Myer lemon mix as sauce! After the sauce disappointment, I had to use my wine to wash it down. Honestly, that is where I draw the line.

When the manager asked them to be quiet, they weren't.\nWhen he asked them again, they cursed him out. They even threatened him, encouraging him to call the police to get them to leave-- which was stupid, because guess what-- he did.\nBefore the police came, the women stood outside, cursed some more, and flipped off the manager through the window. Maybe Andrea was so drunk she forgot that part?\nIt's not surprising that the police made them leave their car with the valet and take a taxi because she and her friend were so wasted.\nThose women made what would have been a usual enjoyable late dinner at Zuni memorable in the worst way. And it had nothing to do with service or management. Thanks Andrea.", "author": "B R."}

It declares that \"Nearly\" all of the produce, meat, etc., used is sustainably and organically farmed. What does \"Nearly\" mean? Grouper on the menu which, according to the  Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Guide is to be avoided due to overfishing and high concentrations of mercury. HMMMM! Secondly, the menu tells us that a 4% surcharge will be added to our bill to pay for the City mandated healthy workers program which guarantees all businesses provide health benefits for their employees. Sounds good. Well, why not just raise the prices 4% rather than adding a surcharge? There is no surcharge for any other business expense, why one for employee benefits? And shouldn't businesses provide said benefits without the government mandating it?\n\nThe food. My Ziti with spicy ragu of lamb was anything but spicy. It left me wondering if the chef had taste buds? Bland, Bland, Bland!\n\nThe service. Our waiter was hardly ever at table, spoke brusquely, coffee refills were non-existent until well into the meal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-09-03", "description": "We read so many great reviews about this restaurant that we felt that we HAD to choose it to celebrate my birthday.  What a disappointment!  I've never written a restaurant review before, but I was so appalled by so many things that I felt compelled to post my own opinion.  Keep in mind, I was not in a bad mood when we visited Zuni.  I'd had a great day at work, we had reason to celebrate, and I was with great company.\n\nThe first thing that upset us was the fact that we had to wait 30 minutes for our table, in spite of the fact that we had made reservations a week in advance, and HALF THE TABLES in the restaurant were empty!  But this was just the start of the exceptionally slow service.  For instance, we had to ask our waitress several times before she'd bring us anything, and even then it was usually the busboy who finally filled our requests.\n\nOnce the waitress FINALLY took our orders, we were so hungry that we had no choice but to choke down the stale, burnt bread.  And for such a \"classy\" restaurant, we were surprised by the cold, hard, completely unspreadable butter.\n\nA trip to the restroom proved to be a mistake.  When I stood up, a rusty nail sticking out from the rotting window frame tore my shirt.  Then while walking through the restaurant, I nearly tripped on the loose, rotten section of hardwood flooring upstairs.  The restroom proved to be miserable place to go, more akin to what you'd expect to find in an inner-city gas station than an expensive, \"hip\" restaurant.  The lack of any hot water to wash my hands, or any towels with which to dry my hands, were just the icing on the cake; I'll spare you the details, but let's just say after that first visit to the restroom, I decided to just hold it until I could find a more suitable facility.\n\nWalking back to our table I passed the live pianist, who honestly sounded more like a toddler randomly banging the keys than a paid professional.  A radio and some speakers would be a lot cheaper and a lot less offensive.  At least as the night went on, he seemed to improve (or our alcohol started to kick in).\n\nThe salad, which the waitress assured us would be big enough for the two of us to split, turned out to be nothing more than a fist-sized pile of bitter lettuce with a little vinaigrette dressing and two croutons.\n\nWe knew ahead of time that their signature dish, the \"fabulous\" roasted chicken, was going to take an hour to prepare.  But looking around the restaurant, we saw that over half of the tables had also ordered the chicken.  With that the case, I don't understand why Zuni doesn't start preparing the chickens in advance, knowing that there will be dozens of orders each night.  If their excuse is that they want to serve it hot and fresh, then why was it that from our vantage point upstairs directly down into the noisy kitchen, we could watch our and 5 other guests' chickens sitting on the counter for NEARLY 10 MINUTES before the waiters and waitresses got around to bringing them to our tables?\n\nAnyway, once the $48 \"chicken\" arrived, we found it to be warm - not hot - from having sat so long after being removed from the oven.  It was burnt - black and charred - on the outside, while the breast was still slightly undercooked.  And while it tasted better than what you would get at KFC, it was certainly nothing to write home about.  In all honesty, I would have had a better \"chicken\" if I had stayed home.  And I would have gotten an actual chicken, instead of the tiny little bird we were served, which was more akin to a Cornish game hen than an actual chicken.  If I was the owner or chef of this restaurant, I would be ashamed to serve this as my signature dish.\n\nAfter all of that, we decided against ordering dessert.  We just wanted to get out of there, but again we had to wait forever to get our check.  After asking our waitress and another table's waitress to bring our check, it was finally the busboy who complied - the same busboy who spilled water on my lap while filling our glasses, not just once but TWICE throughout the evening.\n\nSo after the poor service and mediocre food, I was floored when I saw the bill.  My advice?  Stick to the East Bay if you want good food, good service, and a reasonable cost.  How such subpar restaurants can get away with exorbitant expense and such snooty attitudes is beyond me.  I guess, to quote another reviewer, that's just the \"ambience [sic] that whispers 'San Francisco'.\"", "author": "Geoff B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-10-03", "description": "I would give five stars for the food and service (chicken and bread salad are unbelievable) but we had a terrible experience with a rude hostess on Sunday evening.  I had called for a reservation the week before and couldn't get one but the person I spoke with told me if we arrived before 5pm, there was a good chance we could get a table relatively quickly.  Unfortunately, my father and his partner arrived first at a quarter to five believing we had a reservation, and when the hostess could not find our reservation, she was extremely rude to them and told them it would be an hour to an hour and a half wait.  My father's partner is perhaps the kindest, gentlest, sweetest, most accommodating male soul on the planet, so when he said the hostess was very rude, my hair stood on end and I marched up to the podium ready for a big fight.  Nobody puts Marty in the corner - not on my watch.  So here's the crazy thing - I calmly told the hostess in question that I'd called in the week before and had been told to show up by five pm (it was then 5:08pm) and she is sweet as pie, doesn't make a big deal over our entire party not being there (my guy was parking), and whisks us back to a table.  There were plenty of empty tables and there continued to be some empty tables for the several hours that we were there.  So I'm sorry to give a three star rating, because the food and service were fantastic, but this hostess was horrible on what was meant to be an anniversary celebration.

After numerous recommendations and reading the reviews on Yelp - Zuni seemed like a great choice.   Our reservations were for 8:15 pm on Saturday.  We arrived about 30 mins early to grab drinks at the bar.  The bar and drinks certainly got the evening off to a terrific start.   The hostess took as to our table promptly at 8:15.  The evening was off to an excellent start.  She led us to a table on the second floor - the view faced the alley.  Not a big deal initially.  As the dining room filled, the dining room got hotter and hotter.  It became really uncomfortable.  The only answer was to open the windows.  The stink for the alley slowly crept into the dining room, not to mention the couples sitting next to windows got cold.  So those not near a window were SOL.  The oysters were fabulous .. we placed several orders!  From here on . the experience was just so so.  We were excited to move to our main course.  The duck was OK, the halibut OK, and the to tell you the truth.. I can't even remember what I had ( not memorable).   So, when they came to clear our table the guy who cleared our table tipped our $90 bottle of wine over .. He didn't even say sorry.  When the server came back - he didn't even acknowledge that more that a glass of wine had spilled from the bottle.  Everyone was denial, and we were in shock.  Zuni did not offer to comp us on another glass of wine, or dessert, or anything.  How crazy is that?  I mean when you're spending $350 on dinner -  they can't comp'd us a dessert to fix the spilled wine?  Crazy.  Just not a classy place.  The service was ok, the food ok, and the 2nd floor dining experience - crappy.   It was not memorable, and I won't go back.  Even though the bar was nice ... not sure I'd even return for a drink.

Here goes my story:\n\n- Walked in early without a reservation, fully knowing we would have to wait.  We were told about 1 1/2- 1 3/4 hours.  No problem!  We put our names on the list and headed elsewhere for a few drinks.\n- 45 min in, we phoned Zuni just to let them know we were getting drinks and would be back shortly.  They said no problem, took our number and said if the table came up while we were gone, they would hold it.  How nice!\n- Just before 1 1/2 hours hit, we popped back in.  The host said it would only be \"a few minutes\" before he would be ready to seat us, which was perfect.  About 5 minutes later, another gentleman came up to us and proceeded to lecture us that he was looking for us earlier because a table came up, and next time to leave our number.  He said that about 4 times to us to leave our number next time, while ignoring our protests back that we HAD actually called and left our number.  Oh well, we brushed it off.\n- We sauntered up to the bar and ordered a $5 beer and a $11.75 cocktail.  The bartender then charged me $24.75 for the drinks; I checked the menu three times to make sure I did my math right, then asked her how it came to that amount.  She checked the register, came back and said she calculated wrong as it was supposed to be $21.75.  Unless they charge $5 for tap water, I'm still puzzled by how my two drinks cost $21.75.\n- 30 minutes AFTER the host said it would be \"a few minutes\", we still weren't seated.  \n\nWe ended up just finally walking out after having such a frustrating experience.

It's 100% without a doubt the most tantilizing chicken. I didn't even order it, but it's a huge portion so I got to taste. The pine-nut and brioche stuffing kinda takes it over the top, really. The next morning, I had to indulge on cold, roasted chicken for breakfast. I had no choice, it found its way into my dreams that night. Yup, it's really that good and I am not joking.

Kudos to the beautiful interior space--with airy ceilings and second-floor seating overlooking the bar and kitchen below, and all manner of nooks and crannies into which the tables are tucked--and kudos as well to its beautiful inhabitants, all decked out and knocking back cocktails.  Amusement aplenty for the eye.  But the fun pretty much gives up at this point and goes home.  The interior, while charming is ways detailed in the previous paragraph, amplifies sound in such a way that as the evening wore on and the noise grew louder, I had to holler at my date when international sign language failed to get the point across--should you find yourself committed to going there, I suggest brushing up on your semamphore techniques. The service was spotty, the waiters ignoring us for extended bouts, with our glasses and bellies sitting empty as we waited for Godot, or our server, whichever would deign to put in an appearance first. The food was rather overpriced for the simple fare that it was. A roasted chicken for two perched atop what were basically croutons on steroids and garnished with bits of shrubbery, priced at $45, required that you wait an agonizing 45 minutes for its arrival. Had this been the greatest thing since the aerosol deodorant, I might have cut the restaurant some slack, but it was really only slightly more memorable than Boston Chicken take-out. Still, for all the misery that an evening at Zuni can cause on an emotional, financial and physical level, brunch seems a stronger suit here, with an excellent setup of oysters and bloody marys that can make virtually any hangover seem like a distant memory.

I had dinner at Zuni Cafe last Sunday, September 2.\n\nWe ordered the signature dish, their famous roast chicken for two, which takes one hour to cook.  We nibbled on oysters and gnocchi while we waited patiently for the chicken.\n\nWhen the chicken finally arrived, I took a breast piece, and my date took a thigh piece.  After a couple bites, he said, \"Does this chicken look raw?\"  Well, it was dark in the restaurant, and I guess I wasn't really paying attention, but when I looked closely at his piece, it was pink and translucent.  So then I cut through my piece, and it was raw as well!  I called the waiter over to look, and he said, \"It appears kind of pink because we use such young, fresh chickens here.\"  I didn't believe his explanation, so I asked him to have the chef take a look.  Moments later, the waiter came back and told us that the chef agreed the chicken was indeed \"undercooked.\"  I asked the waiter to send the manager over.  I then expressed to the manager my disappointment in waiting an hour for the chicken in addition to the salmonella dangers of raw poultry.  He offered to put the chicken back in the oven, but I declined.  Since the chicken was already carved into separate pieces, recooking it would have cause the chicken to dry out.  The manager then offered to bring me another chicken immediately, which I can only assume was meant for another table.  A couple minutes later, a brand new chicken arrived, and my date and I dove in.  Again, he took a thigh piece, and I took a breast piece.  As I was about to peel the skin back, I  noticed a 5-inch long, black, curly hair baked into the skin!  I called the waiter back over who then brought the manager again.

I disagree, I didn't think it was THAT good... it was aiite. We ordered the Kumamoto oysters, Shoestring Potatoes, the Roast Chicken (takes an hour), and Piccola meringata. The kumamoto oysters were yummy, pretty expensive though. When I walked into the restaurant almost every table had the shoestring potatoes, that's the reason why we ordered it! It looked good, and it was! Good thing to order while we waited 1 hr for the chicken to be ready. Didn't really like the chicken and it was $48... -___-'. The Piccola meringata dessert was very.. unique never had anything like that before, and it was quite small. Overall I think the chicken is hella expensive (only cause it wasn't that good to be $48) but the service was excellent!

I just finished a late \"brunch\" there, and I was sad to have to pay money for the lousy food and bizarre service. This was a bad choice for brunch as there wasn't much of a brunch menu, so my friend and I settled on an egg dish (him) and a trendy burger with goronzola (me). The eggs were basically 2 fried eggs and a gourmet sausage like the kind I buy weekly at Costco. The burger was a wet piece of  meat on a mushy ciabatta roll. Total damage = $78. Are you sick yet? Well I am. I've been bucking the porcelain bronco all afternoon. \nAlso, I've spent tons of time in Europe. Snooty staff does not give a place a continental air, it makes a place LAME. Our waiter was so precious about handling our plates, fidgeting with our silverware, constantly interrupting to pour water when it wasn't needed (you don't need to top up my full glass for an 8th time Pedro). It was beyond attentive, it was intrusive. When you're attentive you are smiling and helpful, this guy had his cheeks sucked in and acted like he had a baguette up his ass (an organic, artisanal baguette I'm sure). He was acting like a cafe waiter from central casting. Maybe he was just another cracked out queen. Who knows.\nSuffice to say, save yourself the time and money and dine elsewhere.

On a nice sunny afternoon my friend and I decided to stop at Zuni and have a bite at one of their sidewalk cafe tables.  I started with a bowl of spinach soup.  This wasn't one of those vegetable soups that was drowned with cream and butter and barely a trace of the actual vegetable, no!  This was a robust spinach flavor with a mild sweet buttery and nutty after taste.  I could have had a second bowl.  However the star for this meal was my crostini with poached eggs, pancetta, tomatoes and wild mushrooms.  The combination may not sound like anything special but their use of the freshest ingredients made this dish plate-lickable.  The crostini had just the perfect crunch, the poached eggs, oozed over the mixture when punctured and the tomatoes were a sunny perfection.  I would rate this brunch dish THE BEST brunch item I've ever had.  Don't forget to ask for Nathan as your server.  A perfect compliment to a perfect brunch!", "author": "Ralph C."}

We've tried other places and every time we wonder why.  It's the only place really.  It's  also the only place to order oysters in San Francisco because they are freshly shucked and served chilled with the perfect mignonette. We usually start with a dozen oysters, a round of bloody marys and then the table orders family style and  shares the caesar, an order of shoe string potatoes,  a scone, and the french toast . Some order the burgers; others the scrambled eggs with sausage. It's all good, organic, and well presented. It's not for every palate particularly where large portions are what justify a good meal. It's not the Cheesecake Factory or Costco. It's about quality ingredients that come fresh from the market. It's a great place to sample different plates, relax and enjoy each other's company. The artwork , like the menu,  always evolves. It' s why Zuni has been in business over 20 years. The service is unobtrusive and unhurried which allows for conversation and a lovely brunch. Of course, I also love Zuni for dinner but brunch is definitely my favorite. We have been going to Zuni for over 10 years and will continue to do so.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-02-01", "description": "Went here with a couple of gals last weekend for lunch. Have been curious about all the Zuni fuss. First off, it was sorta cloudy but the sun was starting to bust through and upon entering the restaurant I felt swathed in fabulousness by the beautiful yet casual SF folk sipping champagne at the bar and partaking in oysters set on pedestals on the tables (of course I look at what people are eating-STARE even). Anyway the ceiling high windows are stunning, and the worn, painted wood floors on the second floor where we sat are comfortably elegant. I had a balsamic bloody mary that was delicious, with little bits of  minced onion. I liked the fact that it was minced as opposed to in huge hunks-do you really want that many veggies mucking up your vodka? Ditto on the straws, I couldn't use mine after about four sips. I had a burger and shared the fries. The burger was tender and very flavorful with gorgonzola for $1.75 extra, the foccacia nice and one certainly doesn't need condiments-but people, is it worth $13.50? I feel it isn't, though I know about the wonderful ingredients, aforementioned fabulous atmosphere, etc. The Bloody mary was $9.25, perhaps a touch high as well. The service was wonderful, mostly because our server was a total lovebug. So I don't know where exactly I'mgoing with this review but to say yes, Zuni is a lovely, lovely place and maybe I should be honored to have a $13.50 + burger to grace it's luminous environs.", "author": "Isabella R."}

This last time, not so much, I'd give it a 2/5.  Are you kidding me with the service? Really now, a nice restaurant should have some standards. We never got water refills, we didn't get small plates for our bread, the grape juice pour was pathetically small, it took forever to get our food and we never got the oysters we ordered (you get the idea). At least the server was nice when we saw her.   The food is good.  My one complaint is the portabello mushroom version of the burger really didn't have much in the way of portabello mushrooms on it.  Skimpy!!  I am a believer in dining for the sake of eating, but this wasn't worth the price.", "author": "Amy H."}

It does downhill from there.\n1) The second floor seating was uncomfortably hot due to the brick oven downstairs. The window was open for ventilation but it was closed soon after we got there by the guy sitting next to the it. (Can't blame him for doing it. They should not have put a table there.)\n2) Ordered the appetizer of anchovies. They and the cheese slices were very good, the celery and the nicoise olives were a bit pretentious. \n3) Ordered two different entrees. a) The Yellow Fin tuna was fantastic and the baby green beans were cooked to perfection. BUT as most \"upscale\" restaurants tend to think that olive oil is healthy, they use it - a lot of it. The dish on the whole felt \"greasy\" including the beans which was a shame.\n4) The other dish was a flat out MISTAKE to order. Wanting something light, we chose the Spaghetti with rapini. The noodles were less than al dente bordering on RAW. You could taste the rapini IF you could get past the 1/4 cup of olive oil it was swimming in.\nWe also ordered their award winning french fries just to see what an award winning french fry was like. It was great. The problem was there was nothing on the menu that went with french fries. We missed being able to order their famous burgers by 35 minutes.\n\nI must confess that when the waiter (again, great service) came by and asked how everything was, I said fine. I did not give him the chance to address my concerns because I knew I wasn't coming back. That was my fault. Maybe I should have said something but when a upscale restaurant can't boil noodles and has virtually everything soaking in olive oil, what is there really to say? Change your style of cooking? No, you simply go away.", "author": "Jay Y."}

We had a $150 tab with another 4% added on for employees health benefits,  No warning, it it just there, I paid it but won't go back for that reason. Prices are high there but why not just add another $1 to the entree prices so you won't know that the owner is too cheap to pay for his employees benefits and pass it on to the customer... I had halibut that was excellent. It was supposed to have fingerling potatoes with it. 3 slivers of a potato. We are talking about less than a bite.

First impressions on arriving by taxi is that this is a cool, small, local restaurant - then they take us up through a labyrinth to the back top corner  of the restaurant where Reubin looks after us. We had read the reviews and instantly looked for the $20. burger - not there..hmmm..is this a new menu.. . Reuben gives us the daily menu - it is hard to distnguish the starters/appetizers from the main courses.. not a problem..as mix'n'match is encouraged.. we took the rabbit sausage, piccolo fritto &  the \"infamous\" caesar salad (it is how it should be with the correct flavoring of anchovies as previously over-exaggerated by a prior reviewer). All starters are great - good flavor and not over-powering - so far so good - full marks. For the main courses we try the duck breast (with asparagus, white beans & kumquat-olive relish), polenta (with parmesan) and the ricotta Gnocchi... as to wine Reuben was able to offer a choice of 2 wines - a cabernet or a pinot noir (wow ! he had an opinion)..Impressive.  The Gnocchi was bland both in flavor and in texture and needs to be worked on to pep up the flavors/texture.  The rabbit sausage was exquisite ( we ordered a second portion).  Overall service was good  and ambiance great. Definitely a recommended visit for foodlovers... not sure if regular visits would become a tad boring with the small menu however it seems they change the menu often, so the spark of interest is kept..

We had oysters, sardine salad, trenne, sand dabs and the roast chicken, all were ok tasty, but i really expected more.. The sand dabs (a fish dish) was probably the best among what we had, especially the boiled potatoes that came with it - buttery and melt-in-your-mouth.. Chicken was moist and tasty, but really not worth the $48 and 1 hour wait.. Oysters (Kumamoto and Pacific Coast) were fresh, but so small we could hardly taste it.. Trenne (like penne, but triangular) was the most disappointing, pasta was tough and tasted boring. Overall, we felt it really didn't live up to the hype.", "author": "Lydia C."}

We arrived at 5:15 pm on a wednesday night. The place was empty we still had too wait 15 minutes for a table.When we were seated we were given a late lunch menu????? 4 items too choose from. We asked for a dinner menu and were told dinner is not until 6 and the menu was not even printed yet??? It is 5:40 pm and no dinner menu? we ordered drinks 3 beers and 2 glasses of wine which took another 15 minutes to get. The waitress with a bad attitude  took our late lunch order before we got the drinks. We ordered 4 burgers and a pork chop for our meals, we also ordered 2 appitizers to share. BILL $180.00 for burgers and beer are u kidding me. I have no problem spending money on good food .But when you can't cook a burger med and send it out well done you should cook  @ jack in the box not a resturant. Maybe that's why this a cafe?  I will never go back to this toilet again. Why ask how you wan't a burger cooked when you can't cook? Maybe that is why they have a 4 item menu.If you go too zuni cafe bring some extra money so when you leave u can go eat somewhere else. Zuni should  buy some new chairs because the ones we were sitting on were falling apart and looked like they bought them at a bad garage sale. The white paper over linen tablecloth was a touch a class (haha). The rats running around outside won't even come inside. They know better. I am suprised this place has stayed in business, but there are a lot of people in S.F. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else to eat any place would be better.

I hate to wait too long before getting a seat in any establishment so of course it didn't bode well for me when I was told a 40min wait which of course means it's gonna be an hour before we eat at best!  However,  I agreed for my wife's sake and was told we could wait whilst having a drink at the bar.  so many staff;  I counted 3 at the door and at least 4 bar staff not including the glass collectors and many waiters.  I'll never know.  No eye contact, a hello or nod to acknowledge us waiting and why the 15minute wait to get a drink when not that busy I'll never know .  hmmm not going well.  ok so now with a drink and waiting for a table and they were right about the 40 minute wait.  The restaurant decor is very nice and interesting as we wound through it to our table.  Nice spot and seating well spaced out.  The waiter was pleasant enough though when I asked about the  lamb mixed grill didn't seem too knowledgeable about the dish as he just repeated pretty much what it said in the menu.   After we chose he said it was a good choice which made me feel good and I started to really look forward to the meal......... until I heard him say the same to each new table that arrived no matter what they ordered!  ok so now the meal;  the starter Caesar salad was very nice, though a little too much olive oil. The main course was the lamb and again much to much olive oil, grisly meat on the lamb kebab and all just room temp not hot at all. The chop was great just wish it had been a little bigger and the other meats just not really up to much.  we also had the shoe string chips - don't!  greasy greasy and just not as good as they look.  Throughout the meal I had to keep wiping my mouth of oil.  horrible feeling. My wife had the gnocchi.  see her review.  Also oily and in fact not gnocchi but gnudi.  The atmosphere is nice though for $95 bucks all in (a glass of wine, starter salads, starter plate of gnudi and a main course (and not that well cooked)) I expected a higher standard. I would go else where for this price bracket.  saying that this was my 1st visit here and I don't like to blow them off after just one visit so I will probably try again just not sure when.", "author": "SIMON m."}

My wife and I have been coming for both special occasions and date nights for almost a decade.  We never leave disappointed. I've seen reviewers pan Zuni because it's expensive.  It is expensive.  But my goodness, the food is fantastic.  So many people talk about the chicken - why?  Because it's so damn good.  Because it feeds two easily, ordering the chicken is also a good way to get out without spending a ton.  If you want to spend though, the seafood plate appetizer is great - stocked with oysters, clams, prawns, and mussels - or just skip the other stuff and stick with their outstanding and shifting variety of oysters.  At times, they also have anchovies on the menu that are oh so tasty, and I once had a lamb dish off the appetizer menu that was outstanding.  The fish entrees can be hit or miss, and the burger is very good but too pricey.  So, fine, go to Burger Meister if you don't want to pay $15 for a burger.  That said, whatever you get at Zuni, the ambience is fun, the martinis are stiff, the wine list is strong, and going out to dinner feels like \"going out.\"", "author": "Warren B."}

I have to admit my past memories of the restaurant were much better than the experience I had the other night.  The food was reasonable good but I found the portions to be painfully small and quite expensive for what we got.  My wife and I split a ceaser salad and each had an entree with no dessert or alcohol.  The tab came up to around $80 with tax and tip.  My pork tenderloin was tasty but consisted of exactly 5  pieces roughly the size of a silver dollar accompanied by a small sausage and a bit of greens.  Tender and tasty but I was quite unsatisfied.  The famous chicken is still on the menu but takes an hour to prepare and seems strange that the restaurant's high point is chicken .  Finally our table was located in an area of the restaurant where there are padded benches with no backs so we could not sit back unless I wanted to rest against the back of the other guest sitting behind me.  OK for the first 10 minutes but uncomfortable by the end of dinner.  For the price I can think of a number of other restaurants I would rather dine at (Delphina, Myth, Foreign Cinema, etc)", "author": "Stuff D."}

I finally recieved my burger and fries and was not impressed.  The burger was fine, just fine and definitely not worth fifteen dollars.  The frites were good, but nothing special.  I was extremely dissapointed with Zuni, but wasn't ready to completely give up.  I have a copy of the Zuni cookbook and made the burger recipe the next day.  The homemade Zuni burger was much better and way cheaper so I'm giving Zuni two stars instead of three.  The reason to have professionals prepare your food is that they can do a much better job of it than the average home cook unfortunately Zuni dishonors restaurants everywhere by not living up to this basic standard.
