My mind was blown at how delicious the 5 spice chicken was! The chicken itself was juicy and flavorful, but the skin was amazing. I typically tend to stay away from eating the chicken skin but this was too delicious not to! The garlic noodles were also really good, but it was pretty standard. I usually prefer to have my garlic more fried for the garlic noodles. I also tried the rare beef and meatball pho, which was just okay. The broth had a \"meatier\" flavor that I was used to. Like I said before, stick with the 5 spice chicken! \n\nOne of the perks of this chain are the prices. The food was very reasonable priced, especially for San Francisco with most dishes priced around $10-12. I would totally recommend this place to anyone visiting SF!", "author": "Hollie W."}

I also found out Perilla has several stores in San Francisco and Bay Area belonging to the PPQ family enterprise. \n\nAny mention of PPQ and they are known for their famous Garlic Noodles. Wifey wanted to eat here this Friday as I picked her up after work. It was on the way home and this restaurant is located on Irving in the Inner Sunset, and area that we haven't been much to in a long time. \n\nParking is always going to be a challenge coming here and it's gonna take a lot of patience. The area has changed from what I could remember when we would frequent this area when Wifey was taking lamaze classes at UCSF. And speaking of patience, I've never seen so many drivers honk their horns in this particular area as we were exploring and rediscovering this neighborhood. \n\nWe got here just after 7PM and even though it was busy, we managed to snag a table before it quickly filled up after. Checked the menu and I ordered the # 29, which comes with Garlic Noodles, Imperial Rolls and Beef while Wifey got the Garlic Noodles, Pork and Imperial Rolls. Yes, they're pretty similar aside from the choice of protein and I also got a side of broth for good measure to warm me up on a typical chilly San Francisco night.\n\nThe food came out fairly quickly, which we appreciated and the portions were definitely generous. I tasted the Imperial Rolls first as I dipped a piece in the sauce and was satisfied. However, I noticed that every subsequent bite was a repetitive monotone notes in flavors and texture that culminated into a lot of mushiness. The rolls appeared to be somewhat crispy and borderline soggy at the same time. I tasted Wifey's rolls for comparison and I had the same conclusion. \n\nMy order of beef had a good marinade to it as it had both sweet and salty notes for added kick. I tasted my Wifey's pork and they were better than the beef, in my opinion. As for the Garlic Noodles, I expected it to be the same as PPQ, but it was a bit of a disappointment. Yes, it was nice, but it was lacking the garlic and sweetness that is the standard for garlic noodles. \n\nBut overall, it was satisfying and the dishes were fairly inexpensive and generous servings that we had leftovers to take home. I'd like to try their other dishes and the Five Spice Chicken is on my next list. \n\nI'd give it a solid 3 1/2 stars on our first visit. Hope it'll make me change my mind on my next one.", "author": "John G."}

I ended up going with the five spice chicken/ imperial roll combo with the garlic noodles and boy was I happy I did. The chicken looked similar in portion size to just the regular 5 spice chicken and noodle combo, and the imperial rolls added some necessary texture change when my mouth got tired of chewing on noodles and chicken. The noodles themselves had just the right amount of garlic in them as to give it a great taste and not completely kill your breath for the rest of the day. \n\nThe meal was about $10-$11 sin tax & tip, and at that price in the city you can't really ask for much else.

The coffee is smooth and spiced deliciously.\n\nWe were served our food in under 5 minutes, and the servers were so kind and attentive.

However, my take out from last night changed my perception of the restaurant. I ordered an imperial roll and pork with garlic noodles. I ordered on a Friday night 10 mins before 9pm, which is their closing time. I asked if I can still order take out. Since I've worked at a restaurant before, I know how annoying it is when there are orders coming in if they have started cleaning the kitchen. They said it's ok and should be ready in 10 mins. \n\nThey charged me as 2 separate orders for about 20 dollars. Then I checked on yelp to confirm that the exact same item is $11.25. It's not like the separate order had extra egg rolls, so I'm not sure why it was charged separately. That wasn't the main issue. The issue is with the inconsistent of their food. I've ordered the bbq pork with garlic noodle before. It was 3 pieces of pork attached to the bone which each piece is about the size of the palm. They cut up part of the pork for your convenience but the whole piece is still intact to the bone. Maybe because I ordered around closing time, the food I received looked liked scraps. It was just small dried pieces of pork put together in an order. (See pic attached).\n\nI really like this place and it was a disappointment.

Nothing beats a heart-warming bowl of pho in typical chilly SF weather, and you can't say no to all the other options of carby goodness. They don't skimp on protein either; the five spice chicken comes with a decently sized slab of chicken on the side. Not to mention, the imperial rolls are among the best I've had, delightfully crunchy, flavorful fillings, satisfying and not too greasy.\n\n(-) Some may complain that it's not authentic per se, given that there is only one size of the pho and they seem to cater to more American tastes with specialties such as the indulgently buttery garlic noodles. But SF has plenty of options and you have your pick if you really want your generations-old secret family recipe pho brimming with anise. I think my one suggestion would be to incorporate more veggies than the few pieces of broccoli, though their sauteed broccoli are rather delicious. \n\nTips and thoughts:\n- The portions are generous, and prices are accordingly very reasonable with entrees between $10 and $20 that can easily last 2 meals. \n- The service is friendly, and you can always count on being cheered up by their smiles here. My favorite memory is once when the server ran outside after me because I forgot my take-out container.\n- The online ordering system is a boon for all the semi-neurotic, busy, tech-oriented people of SF who appreciate this efficiency.\n- While not super ambiancey, it's clean and there's a sort of simple elegance to the space.

The best item on their menu is the garlic noodles, and if you're new to Perilla, garlic noodles are a must. They have the perfect amount of garlic, that is heaven in your mouth, but not over powering. Pair it with the imperial rolls because they are crispy, beautiful, golden rolls of joy. If coffee is for you, get the Vietnamese drip coffee.

Highly recommend. \n\nThe boyfriend also wanted to try out their iced vietnamese coffee. For some reason, though good, it was not as strong in coffee flavor as other places we have tried back in SoCal Westminster area. \n\nHe enjoyed his pho. It came with your usual basil, bean sprouts and surprisingly lemon instead of lime. The broth was clean and flavorful, just what you want from a good bowl of pho. \n\nI ordered the garlic noodles with lemongrass beef. The beef was definitely packed with great seasoning and balanced out the blandness of the noodles. Unfortunately, I was expecting a more garlic-y taste from the noodles but they just reminded me of plain spaghetti in a way. The portion was huge! I barely made a dent so thankfully its price made it worth for 2 meals. \n\nService is great! We sat down next to the windows and the servers immediately noticed that the sun was shining down on us.

The pork was extremely tender and well seasoned and the spring rolls had just the right amount of crunchiness to provide some contrast in texture.

But the pork chops were absolutely amazing; just the right amount of sear while still leaving the pork extremely tender and flavorful. I just wish there was something more to go with it. If you're someone who needs some variety in a dish you might want to avoid this one.\n\nSERVICE:\nOkay, so when we arrived, we put down our name for 2 people like responsible adults.

My nostrils were immediately filled with the strong scent of beautiful garlicky butter, and I started salivating. This tasted just as good as it looked--amazingly rich, delectable flavors.

I thought Maybe they where afraid my niece was going to knock the glass over and spill it all over the table. Who knows...\n\nWe ordered the famous garlic noodles. It tasted really plain; there was no flavor at all. And the servings were really small. For the price that they are charging, they should give us more food. We also got the spring rolls. Again, nothing special about the food here. The next time I'm craving garlic noodles, I will remember to go to the other Perilla locations.", "author": "Edie G."}

I went to SF pretty frequently during that time to hang out with them. I hate driving in SF and they would take me here whenever I would crave Perilla. I haven't been back to SF as often as I'd like, but when I do, I try to go to Perilla whenever I'm in the area.\n\nThe BF and I spent our Saturday afternoon exploring Golden Gate Park. After searching on Yelp on what's nearby to eat, I didn't realize Perilla was in the area so I instantly wanted to go here! San Tung was also in the area, but I wasn't craving chicken wings or chinese food. Plus the BF never had Perilla before so I wanted him to try it.\n\nPerilla is as good as I remembered! I love the garlic noodles here!! It's the right amount of garlic; not to garlic-y or bland, just perfect IMO. The meats are so flavorful AND the portion is generous. So worth it for what you're paying for. You will leave full!\n\nService is as great as I remembered. Pretty much everything has been the same since I was last here few years back. It's good to know that nothing has changed and nothing is worse; it has been consistent throughout these years. The only thing I find weird whenever I'm here is that the workers aren't Vietnamese so they won't understand if you speak to them in Viet lol. Overall, I would recommend tourist and locals to try Perilla out!", "author": "Ellen C."}

My favorite was the tofu veggie dish and the veggie spring rolls actually!! The chicken seemed a little greasy, and for catering, it was confusing what sauces to put on the salads, so they fell kind of short.

I was visiting the Presidio so it was a close Lyft ride to Inner Sunset. \n\nPARKING + AMBIENCE\nStreet parking is available on the street and nearby neighborhood vicinity. It's difficult finding parking since everyone parks on the streets, so it's likely you will have to park far from the restaurant. The restaurant is small, but there are a decent amount of seating inside. There was a wait when I came, but it was okay because my party didn't arrive yet. \n\nFOOD\nI ordered the Imperial Rolls and Five Spice Chicken Garlic Noodles ($11.25) and it was a hefty meal. The portions are huge, so by the end of the meal I was stuffed, I couldn't eat more even if I wanted to. The imperial rolls are a nice side to go with the dish, but in hindsight, I probably shouldn't have gotten them since everything else was more than enough to fill me up. Dip them in the fish sauce for maximum flavor. The five spice chicken is tender and juicy and the garlic noodles had the perfect amount of flavoring, not too garlicky, just right. \n\nSERVICE\nService was friendly, there is a waiting list paper attached to the front door, they will call your name when a table is ready. They came back multiple times to refill our water and check up on us.\n\nCONCLUSION\nAn authentic Vietnamese cuisine restaurant with garlic noodles as the highlight, it was so good! Everything we ordered was hugely portioned, so don't over order or you will have plenty of leftovers. The price is okay, cheap for San Francisco standards. Perilla is a great spot for Vietnamese food, especially the garlic noodles plates.", "author": "Vincent P."}

My friend had Perilla bookmarked on Yelp for their garlic noodles. I knew very well how great they are because I've been to the Mission St, SoMa location many times before but noticed this location had better ratings so time to try it out! \n\nI love the location! Right on Irvine and 10th, next to all my other favorites like Manna and San Tung, this place offers lots of seating, nicely spaced out and for the most part pretty clean. The staff was super friendly throughout service. At one point though, they hovered around our table for our food order, kind of threw me off as I was try to catch up with a friend but I could tell they were preparing for a rush, which eventually came. In a way, I appreciate the efficiency. \n\nTo start, I got the Imperial Rolls for $7.75. Crispy fried rolls filled with pork, taro, carrots and silver noodles. As a side they also came with lettuce, mint and cucumbers with a fish sauce for dipping. I'm always a fan of deep fried things, the filling was a bit mushy consistency, different from their other location and although it came with 6 rolls, it was odd that they only served two pieces of lettuce to wrap them up in. Still enjoyed the flavor though. For my dinner, I needed to get my norm: garlic noodles with 5-spice chicken for $10.25. This is their signature dish, no matter what location so get it! This specific location though, OH EM GEE! The chicken was huge! Super flavorful and juicy. Also, they probably served double the noodles from their mission st counterpart. So much food, two people could share it! Such a great value, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! \n\nAll in all, another great option to revisit in the future.

I took my first bite, but I couldn't not help and nod to the side and smiled simultaneously.  It was a taste beyond words, I cannot recall the last time chicken taste so good.  The flavors of spice sprung in my mouth, and I dipped that bad boy chicken in the fish sauce and it was a force to be reckon with.  Each bite I savored that chicken.  It tasted so tender in the inside and crispy and delicate on the outside.  Perfection! \n\nImperial Rolls: Super hot and crispy, it was browned to perfect colors and oh so flaky when it drops in your mouth.  This has to be one of the top egg/imperial Rolls within the city of SF.  I just couldn't stop after the first scrumptious bite.  \n\nGarlic Noodles:  Never would I have thought these three ingredients would come together with such precision.  The garlic noodles was full of flavor each bite was soft and slightly chewy where it very simple tear off.  I added the fish sauce with the noodles to make a full blown combo of amazing taste.  \n\nI would definitely come back and get me some five spice chicken and garlic noodles.  This will always be my favorite restaurant to dine when I am around the area.  If your craving for some good food involving chicken and garlic noodles look no further, here is the spot", "author": "Jacky C."}

They looked delicious!!)\n\nI was on a paleo diet when I came to Perilla - obviously not the best idea to go to a Vietnamese restaurant when you can't eat grains, but I was determined to make it work. I wound up ordering the five spice chicken vermicelli bowl... and asked for it with no vermicelli and extra lettuce (so more of a salad dish rather than a noodle dish). Though initially a little confused, the waiter quickly understood what I was looking for and accepted my request with no further questions. I was surprised by how flexible the restaurant was.\n\nOverall, I thought the five spice chicken was really tasty. It was cooked so tenderly and packed a lot of flavor, which brought together an otherwise bland dish. Portions are large, and the price is really worth the size that you get. Service was quick and efficient.\n\nI will have to come back and try the garlic noodles once I'm no longer paleo. One of the better Vietnamese restaurants in SF for sure!", "author": "Sheila D."}

I usually order #27 - garlic noodles with imperial rolls and five spice chicken.  The portions are pretty big, so if you're a small eater, this can last you for two meals.  The five spice chicken is pretty tasty and accompanies well with the garlic noodles. I also like their cha gio (imperial rolls) since they're really crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They also include taro in their cha gio, which is pretty unique since most Vietnamese joints do not include taro in them.  I am a fan of taro, so their cha gio always hit the spot.\n\nBut to describe their dish that put them on the map.. their GARLIC NOODLES!  Chewy egg noodles loaded with garlic flavor (and visible garlic chunks).  Each bite of the garlic noodles you can taste the garlic flavor. Something that I dig, but maybe not vampires. :)  I've had garlic noodles at other Asian joints, which were usually so bland that you couldn't taste any hint of garlic. With Perilla's garlic noodles...you can definitely taste the garlic! That's what I call...yummy! \n\nOverall, a great full-flavored meal that is very reasonable.  Come and try the garlic noodles!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-24", "description": "TL;DR: FIVE SPICE CHICKEN PHO, light garlic noodles, incredible service!\n\nIn my two times at Perilla, I have already nailed it down as my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in San Francisco. This restaurant provides different flavors than what most would expect. Perilla manages to hit all the basics of Viet food perfectly while putting their own spiced up twist to it.\n\nIn my two experiences here, I've been suggested to come and I've suggested others to come with me. This is a popular spot in the area. On the Saturday that I came, it was extremely crowded. It took us about 25 minutes to get seated, which isn't exactly common in Vietnamese restaurants. The staff is incredibly gracious and patient. Multiple waiters checked up on us before and during our meal. When the check was given to our table, each of us were thanked for coming in for the day. Very sweet of them!\n\nBoth times I went to Perilla, I ordered the Five Spice Chicken Pho. Oh man, I have no idea where to start. This is such a unique dish. The slightly crunch skin chicken is served on the side of the bowl of pho, keeping it from getting soggy or losing its flavor. The five spices really do come out in this dish because it's one of the most flavorful bowls of pho I've ever had. The chicken and the pho is the perfect pairing for any type of day. I was also able to try some of my friend's garlic noodles. To my surprise, the noodles were very light. When I think of garlic noodles, I imagine the overwhelming taste of garlic, to the point of it becoming distasteful. These noodles were flavorful and had that tint of garlic, but nowhere close to overpowering.\n\nIf in the area, I would suggest only two restaurants: San Tung and Perilla. It's nice to know that when I'm in this area, I have restaurants that I can trust with an excellent meal. Also, I believe Perilla has recently expanded to a smaller location in San Leandro, closer to where I live. If it's anything even close to the original, I'll be going there often!", "author": "Calvin T."}

I've enjoyed garlic noodles from other restaurants in San Francisco, but nothing compares to what they make here. The noodles are perfectly softened with a good amount of butter. The flavor isn't too oily nor is it unbearably garlic-y. The beef that came with the garlic noodles were tender and juicy as well. We also ordered a plate of fried egg rolls which consisted of 3 rolls cut in half. 3 rolls sounded like nothing for our starving appetite, but I was famished after finishing the first roll. The crunchy exterior shell and the flavorful meat melded perfectly together with the vegetables. The service was incredibly nice and attentive.

I won't comment much on the food other than it's fantastic, straight forward, and fairly priced. Good pho begins with the broth, and Perilla hits it right on the head.\n\nThis review, however, is for their customer service. Every time I've eaten at this location, or ordered delivery/takeout, it's been with enthusiasm and a smile; always trying to do well by their customers.\n\nLast night, after a long 4.5 hour drive back home to SF, my gf and I decided that the perfect way to cap off the evening was with noodles from Perilla. So we placed an order via Grubhub; about an hour to deliver, sure no problem. We've ordered many times from them like this. It's been an hour and, and still no delivery. I suspected something was up, so I called the restaurant to ask for a status. \nIt turned out that they had cancelled the order once it came in, because we were out of their range of delivery for this evening in particular, as they were really busy. Fair enough, but there was no notification, and much disappointment. As soon as I was on the phone with them, I got an email from Grubhub noting the cancellation. In other words, Grubhub didn't notify me until after an hour that my order had been cancelled.\nThe girl on the phone noticed this and expressed her confusion, and recognized that Grubhub's system had screwed us both over. She felt really bad, and said that if we still wanted the order, they would place a rush on it and send it our way. I thanked her, and told her that I'll keep in mind that Sunday nights are dicey for delivery in my area.\nWe were finally happy to have our noodles delivered. One of them we got pho instead of garlic noodles, but it didn't matter, because the noodle soup ended up being preferable, and the meat choice was right. Hah. Just had to replace the order over Grubhub so I could pay for it after the cancellation goes through.\n\nHonestly, I don't write many reviews; just not into it much. But I thought this warranted it, and I'm always down to giving a shout out to local businesses.", "author": "Patrick M."}

I actually think this location is better.  For the FiDi lunch rush, that location must precook a lot of the garlic noodles; I've seen huge the huge vats they pull from.  We came here for an early dinner when it wasn't that crowded; our order took awhile so I figured they made it fresh.  And I could tell the difference; the noodles were so good!\n\nImperial Rolls and Charbroiled Beef Garlic Noodle: I love this dish because I get three of my favorite things and only two pieces of steamed broccoli (which is still too much broccoli).  The imperial rolls were perfectly crispy and filled with moist pork.  It's not Tu Lan quality, but still really good.  I love the charbroiled beef because it's shellacked with tangy marinade and full of seared goodness; almost like having Korean BBQ done for you.  The garlic noodles are so garlicky and chewy.  They're not quite as good as An The Go (i.e. Crustacean's food truck), but still yummy. \n\nPork Chop Garlic Noodle: A massive amount of meat.  Thinly cut, heavily marinated and nicely seared like the beef.  As much as I'm a big fan of the beef, this may be better.\n\nCup of Broth: I know you don't come here for the pho, so I obviously didn't order pho.  But I was curious how it tasted so I got a cup of their beef pho broth.  It was basically meh.  Heavy tones of star anise and salt.  Missing the rich fatty and umami meat subtleties you might find at Bodega Bistro.  Definitely stick with the garlic noodles.", "author": "Adam B."}

Its still quite a drive out Herr, but it's less busy even during peak lunch hours. It's mostly to gos or table of one,which is fine by me. The space to dine is very small a couple of tables, narrow walkways. \n\nThere's always a lunch special going in for their banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) and an order of Thai tea for about 7 dollars. But that's not why I'm there. Its for the garlic noodles! Its smaller portions but the same flavor is right there. A rich, buttery sauce with minced garlic slight crisp to the noodles, yet so moist and mouthful with each bite. Its a pretty huge side with the entree like their five spice chicken or pork. I only enjoy the chicken when I'm at Perilla, at PPQ its almost a waste of an order because there's so much better dinner options.\n\nThis is the place to try the PPQ pho (9.75)- love their broth. It's not a mouth full of salt or MSG, or green onions and cilantro. How lucky is that?! There's a couple of variations for meat choices, but there is one bowl size. That's all you really need. It's more expensive than your typical bowl of pho, but the quality is there and the rare beef is of a better quality. It's still under $10 a bowl which isn't bad. \n\nImperial rolls (7.25) here are off the chain. Crispy as hell and it gets hotter which eat bite (almost tongue burning!) But it doesn't lose it's crisp during the entire meal. They're like fun sized version of lumpia but better tasting for sure. \n\nFive spice chicken whether its on the side, with the garlic noodles, on the pho- the skin's crisp is beyond me. Crunch with every bite, so flavorful and the chicken is moist! Not dry. The portions for the chicken definitely isn't skimped. If you don't know what to do, the garlic noodle five spice chicken #21 combo is pretty cracking! \n\nI'm a noodles gal, so you already know I'll have that side of their famous garlic noodles (3.5). The bowl is pretty deep and it's almost as much as you would regularly get at PPQ from a dinner side. \n\nTo be honest, everything here is absolutely delicious. It opens for lunch and it opens for dinner. It's way more quieter and cozier than PPQ is especially for a date. Downside is no crab, but I mean service here is on point. Always friendly and smiling.

We shared the pho for lunch and the noodles for dinner.\n\nWe both felt a little queasy before bed time, and went to sleep. Then we both woke up with the worst stomachache ever. He and I threw up multiple times through the night. Then another few times with it coming out the other way. Food poisoning lasted for another couple days. \n\nGiven that the only other 2 things we had eaten were almonds and pistachios as a snack, it has to be Perilla that did this to us. I just hope that they are more careful in the future with food - it was a terrible experience. I'm shocked no one else experienced this on Christmas day.", "author": "A Y."}

We both ordered the 5-spice chicken with garlic noodles.\n\nOh my goodness gracious was it delicious. The chicken was crispy but juicy and flavorful. The garlic noodles were plenty and not overpowering. The fish sauce was on the sweeter side so I occasionally dipped my chicken in there for funsies but my date basically drank his fish sauce.

If you're reading this and haven't tried Perilla, seriously leave. Go.\n\nNow.\n\nWhat you MUST order here are the garlic noodles. Hands down, THE BEST I've had. I can't imagine it being any tastier. I've never had a bad experience, and they are always cooked to perfection. It's not super oily, and there aren't huge chunks of garlic just floating around in it. It's always so flavorful, and the garlic is infused seamlessly. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I might have to order some for dinner tonight.\n\nSo if it's your first time, I highly recommend ordering #27 -- the five-spice chicken, garlic noodles and imperial rolls. This is my go-to order and it is BOMB DOT COM. The chicken is nicely seasoned, crispy and tender. You also get 3 delicious imperial rolls to top it off. The portion sizes are rather generous, and since I'm a small eater, I get two meals out of one order. I've also tried their pho, which is a good option if you want something warm and soupy.\n\nAnother great thing about this place is the service.

I have been coming to Irving for the past few weeks trying all the many different flavors of food and this place was a bookmarked in my Yelp as a place that I needed to go to. The parking worked out fairly well because I was able to get parking directly across the street. I initially was tempted to go to the pizza place on the same block but I came to Irving for reason, PERILLA.\n\nThe menu in the window was exactly on point. I had been to another Vietnamese restaurant just yesterday and this place definitely seemed to be a bit nicer. After reviewing a few items on the menu posted in the window I made my way on in. This place is very clean and nice. I was greeted immediately and told, \"Sit anywhere\". That is what I'm talking about. Eye contact, greeting, and time to get seated before approached about order. That is exceptional customer service in my opinion. I found a table closer inside near the wall and took my seat. As I sat down I was given a menu and admired this place for a bit. There are nice pieces of artwork on the wall, good music, and a very easy going vibe. Well done. \n\nI ordered the Imperial Rolls and the Five Spiced Chicken Garlic Noodles along with a THAI ICE TEA. As I waited I saw how well this staff works together. Between the servers and the people in the kitchen everyone that works here is constantly moving and trading off with others to make sure customer needs are being met. Between refilling water, greetings, seating, and clean up it is no wonder that this place gets busy. Shortly after I arrived more people started to fill into this place. When my food finally came I was thrilled. I was a surprised at how good the food looked. The food smelled wonderful and I could not wait to get into this meal.\n\nMy first bite started with the Imperial Rolls...they were INCREDIBLE!!! The noodles and chicken were just as INCREDIBLE. As I continued on with this meal I was very very pleased with my order, especially since it was my first time here. The meal was FANTASTIC. The service was great and I was very appreciative my server, MEIZI! \n\nLunch was a success and my stomach felt appreciated.

With that thought in mind, I came to this restaurant, ordering the five spice chicken rice noodles for my brother and the Perilla beef noodle for myself. First, I tasted the broth, and it is by no mean surprising. Then I tasted some noodles, and I'm really annoyed with the weird taste in the noodle. The most important thing in pho is the noodles but the restaurant failed to provide good quality noodles. For the five spice chicken, it is solely normal roasted chicken without any \"five spice\" taste. Furthermore, the restaurant used lemon instead of lime, which is really rare to see in a Vietnamese restaurant. And I really don't like they put seafood sauce on the table because the combination of pho and seafood sauce, I don't know if you feel that too, is WEIRD. WEIRD!! Ah!!!!", "author": "Annabelle L."}

My boyfriend got the pho dac biet and I tried the garlic noodle with five spice chicken for the first time. The pho broth was decent. There was a good amount of noodle and meat. The five spice chicken was deliciously moist and flavored. I would really recommend it by itself. I do not understand the fuss over the garlic noodle. I love garlicky food and I would have really liked this dish if I didn't feel so gross eating it. The whole dish revolves around grease and a great quantity of carbs. I stopped after a couple quick bites because I was so afraid of getting a heart attack if I kept eating it. The dish left me with such a heavy feeling afterwards, as if my body had to work extra hard to digest all that oil. I don't even think that garlic oily noodle is even an authentic Vietnamese dish anyways. You cannot find that in any Vietnamese restaurant in Orange County or Vietnam. \nOverall, the place was cheap and there were many different options.

I can understand why a lot of people like this dish, but I think it's just okay. The five spice chicken by itself is good. It's perfectly seasoned and cooked crispy. The imperial rolls and the garlic noodles on the other hand are pretty bland. Though I like the texture of the noodles, the amount of garlic used might be equivalent a clove of garlic. I have to drown everything in fish sauce to make the dish taste good.\n\nI've also tried their pho and beef carpaccio. From what I remember, the pho broth was pretty tasteless.

Or a sewing factory\n\nAt first I thought it was the first door the the right but it's not. That door was a portal to a place for brooms or its another kitchen. I didn't open the door because to your left you see chefs in dark rubber aprons walking around looking something to do. And they were doing something because they were all wet and sweaty! \n\nIt was great. A further down I saw a couple of women working on food. There were huge bowls of food ready to be processed. They were using their hands, call it hand made!\n\nThe floor was wet were covered in rubber mats, it was amazing. When I finally found the restroom, which is the farthest door and the last door, actually the only door I saw that I was waiting to see. The are two doors you'll see if you go to the restroom. The farthest door is the only door you should be looking for. The door with the restroom sign on it. However I was blind to see it because of all the scenery that was taking place. \n\nOkay. So i landed in the restroom. Holy mother of the Universe. It smelt like a dead body. Like, i was having a hard time breathing. It's like like a gagging type of smell but more of a, \"ok wth it smells really bad\". It didn't smell like dookie but like a super bad smell. Lol.\n\nThe hand soap did its job by covering the horribly bad smell for a second but the soap container was out of soap. I got like drips of it. \n\nSo you push to enter or was it you pull? Idk but the door handle was just a dead bolt lock. And the door is too big for the door frame so the door sticks. You have to push or pull to get out. \n\nI was afraid of hitting somebody on my way out because I had to literally use my body to push the door open. \n\nAnyways, great food. I had the garlic noodles. \nOh, the container for the chopsticks on our table were wet at the bottom for some reason. \nThx guys! Gr8 place", "author": "Tony N."}

I'm glad that my friend and I arrived here before the lunch rush because I was starving! My friend ordered the five spice chicken garlic noodles dish with the imperial egg rolls and I ordered the charbroiled beef garlic plate (I believe #24 on the menu). Omg I can't even begin to describe how good the food was and simple. My dish had the beef, noodles, broccoli, and fish sauce (which I don't eat). Even without the fish sauce, the food was delicious! The garlic noodle portion is huge and I couldn't even finish my plate in one sitting. The meal was pretty cheap as well! I believe it was about $30 without tip? \n\nThe service here is excellent! Our water were always filled (even if the cups weren't even nearly empty and our server brought me a togo container without me even having to ask! I will most definitely come back here and try more of the dishes! :)", "author": "Joanne Y."}

I just wish I didn't have to wipe my mouth after every time I forked some in my mouth, lol!! The imperial rolls are good and go great with the fish sauce too (what doesn't go well with fish sauce...???). I love the portion size here because they give you a big pile of garlic noodles that can definitely fill you up if you're able to finish, or you can pack it up and save it for later.\n\nA new thing I tried recently was the papaya salad with charbroiled beef. It also has carrots, peanuts, fried shallots, and basil that fancies it up a little bit. This was a huge portion and I would definitely order it for myself again! The sauce for this isn't just fish sauce but it has other stuff mixed in too... Not too sure haha. However my friend ordered this and she said after a while, her jaw hurt from chewing LOL. \n\nOne thing that stood out to me about my most recent visit was the customer service!!!

Maybe because I was super hungry after work, but it hit the spot pretty well. Great flavor, and the chicken was very flavorful and not dry. The dish even comes with fish sauce and two pieces of broccoli (probably for presentation). As for the garlic noodles, they definitely have a good flavor of garlic and it is not overly buttery, but enough so it has a oily-like texture in the mouth. Definitely would recommend this dish for a first timer at Perilla.\n\nThen yesterday I tried their vermicelli bowl with charbroiled pork and imperial rolls. Because I am a pretty big fan on the vermicelli bowls at other vietnamese restaurants, I was curious about this one. Boy.. it left me stuffed! The pork was great, noodles were a little thin than I am used to, but nothing to really complain about. Imperial rolls=hit the spot again. Good proportion with the veggies to the noodles which was nice. Another random observation is that my grandma got the pho with five-spice chicken and the bowl was huge. They put the chicken on the side so it would not get soggy in the soup; how \nconsiderate! \n\nI would come back here again especially for their garlic noodles and because all their dishes are decently priced (roughly between $7-$11).

There wasn't much garlic-y or buttery flavor to the noodles; they were just really greasy and heavy. There was a pool of oil on my plate under the chicken and noodles! I ended up pouring all of the sauce on my noodles to add some flavor, but even then, I couldn't get myself to finish all of the noodles.

They're:\n\n(1) Buttery, without being oily to the point where your noodles can slip and slide off your plate\n(2) Garlicky, without commanding your breath and whipping the noses of others\n\nTwo great things in one! They strike a nice balance and make for a very good dish. Need some greens to add some crunch into your dish? Their cabbage salad appetizer will give your teeth plenty of satisfaction as you chomp down on fried onions, crushed peanuts and fish sauce vinaigrette-dressed cabbage slices. \n\nI was disappointed I didn't get to try the famous San Tung down the street because of the ridiculous line. But I was VERY pleasantly surprised by Perilla's choice of items, flair to their dishes and pleasant, crowd-free atmosphere. Even my parents, who are picky about their Vietnamese food, enjoyed the food. Overall, I think it's the perfect alternative to hit after a fun but tiring day around Golden Gate Park.", "author": "Tony H."}

The vermicelli was very refreshing when paired with the vegetables on the bottom. The basil was noticeable and pleasant, but not overpowering. You can either pour the fish sauce on top of everything and mix it or pour a little and save some to dip. Either way, you can't go wrong. You get so many flavors in this one dish.

First, the pho ga here is not very good, and the portion size has been the smallest compared to all of the different pho places that I have been to in San Francisco so far. Secondly, their prices for their pho is about $1-$2 more than what I have paid for at other Vietnamese restaurants. I will not be coming back because I feel that eating here is not worth my money. Additionally, there is no air conditioning in the restaurant, so if you happen to eat pho on a warm day or you get hot while eating the pho, you won't feel very comfortable because the restaurant can get pretty stuffy.", "author": "Lynn T."}

The different textures mixed well together and the flavors didn't clash either, which made each item easy to enjoy. For the price of only $11, the portion was enough to fill me up and well worth the money. \n\nThe waitress came back once to refill our water and ask if we wanted anything else. She didn't come back again to refill until I asked for the check so minus a star for service and for tricky parking. \n\nSide fact: for being a Vietnamese restaurant, many of the workers at Perilla aren't Vietnamese!", "author": "Vy P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-09-20", "description": "I would be hard pressed to give Perilla anything less than four stars - it's solid, house-made Vietnamese fare for the relatively undemanding urbanite. Maybe because Jamie W. and I are used to the one on Mission near the demolished Transbay Terminal, a bustling place during the lunch hour, that we were marginally disappointed with the garlic level in the garlic noodles served here. Dare I say it was a tad bland, which makes stuffing your face with heavy-duty carbs more of a dietary challenge than it has to be. But I won't ding them much for that since the quality level is still pretty darn high for the Perilla brand.\n\nNow that there are three of them in the city plus PPQ Beef Noodle House close to this location and the PPQ Dungeness Island in the Outer Richmond - are we looking at the Vietnamese version of the King of Thai Noodle chain? Could be... In truth, we went to the Geary location first but found it closed for renovation, so out of determination to have our garlic noodles, we took the 44 O'Shaughnessy line to the Irving Street location, which was very nearly packed. Soon after we were seated, we ordered the $6.50 Shrimp Rolls, which were a tad small but still delectable as a starter.\n\nJamie and I went our separate ways on our $8.50 Garlic Noodle plates - I had my standby, the Five-Spice Chicken (see photo), while he veered into the Charbroiled Pork marinaded in garlic and pepper (see photo). Both were perfectly tasty, but I have to admit the standout may have been the $6.50 plate of Seasoned Vegetables - shredded cabbage and carrots mixed with fried tofu (see photo). I was liking it all, but the young woman sitting behind me kept playing with her hair, pulling it into a ponytail, and whipping it against my head with no regard to the lack of sanitation in her nervous habit. Disgusting...and wear a hat to cover your dandruff-covered head, hon.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...still Perilla-quality even if they seem to have a garlic shortage here\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...get me away from that hair-tossing moron!\nSERVICE - 3 stars...always smiling, just not always present\nTOTAL - 4 stars...if only the Mission location stayed open for dinner and on weekends (sigh)", "author": "Ed U."}

They had one guy waiting all the tables when I went which made things a little slower but he was so sweet, and it was just him so I totally understand.  He came by often to refill water and I can tell he looked around and try to tend to everyone which I always appreciate.\n\nI ordered the five spiced chicken with imperial rolls and garlic noodles.  The garlic noodles were meh.  I haven't eaten too many straight garlic noodles to compare too but it was bland.  I expected a more garlic-y taste but sad, nada.  They also had this stale texture to it -- idk, maybe it's just me.  Imperial rolls were imperial rolls, they weren't as superb as I expected it to be either (thanks for the hype, guys).  But the five spiced chicken... That's where it got me.  The chicken was so tender and the spices were amazing and one point.  I wish the skin was a bit crispier but hey, it works for me. About $10 without tip so not bad for the big portion.  I didn't finish so I took the rest to-go.  \n\nI'd definitely come back for the chicken, and maybe the garlic noodles again just to see if it was this one time.  \n\nOH!

The garlic noodles was a bit bland for me to begin with but the chicken and fish sauce balanced it out. I like my garlic noodles to pack a flavorful punch, and Perilla did not do that for me. BUT it's still a really good and popular dish. It's definitely worth a try if it's your first time here! Everyone's taste buds are different so you never know if you'll like it or not. \n\nOther than that, their pho dac biet is good! Soup has such a strong flavor but in a good way. You can definitely taste the long hours in making the broth. But my only gripe is that they give you very little meat. More meat please and it'll be the perfect bowl of pho! \n\nLastly, service is amazing. I've never experienced such great and friendly service from an Asian establishment.

Previously I had the pho and  and side of garlic noodles and this time I had the five spice chicken pho with side of garlic noodles. \n\nThe pho is good, though not particularly outstanding, but the garlic noodles and the five spice chicken are drishishishi (delicious)! The garlic noodles have the perfect amount of moisture and flavor without being too overwhelming. I think its better than Thanh Long garlic noodles, though I have met with opposition on that stance. The five spice chicken (decent portion!) comes on a separate plate as its grilled or deep fried with a light crust. \n\nThe service is average for a pho joint, though our waters were refilled reguarly. The prices are ~$8-9/ bowl and the side of garlic noodles is ~$3 (affordable when you want to fulfil a craving).", "author": "Angela L."}

Whenever I'm home, I make it a point to come here and satisfy my garlic noodle craving. My friends and I all agree that their five spice chicken is the best dish they have, with a large mound of noodles and juicy tender chicken on the side. For an extra dollar, you can add imperial rolls as well. My one complaint about this is that it can be pretty oily sometimes, but the flavor is just so good that I can ignore that fact. If you don't want chicken, the charbroiled pork is good as well! I haven't gotten around to trying the rest though.\n\nService is good here, and though it's a little bit pricey, it's definitely worth the money because it's so filling.

My favorite entr\u00e9e is the Five Spice Chicken with Imperial Rolls and Garlic Noodle. The chicken is crispy on the outside and truly has the spice-y taste in every bite. The chicken is tender and cooked to perfection. The garlic noodles has the right amount of bounce and not too much oil. I'm not crazy about the imperial rolls by itself but dipped into the fish sauce, it softens up the crispiness and really hits the spot. Perilla usually adds a few pieces of broccoli on the side, which I don't mind  but I'd prefer a bit more greens if they were gonna add it in there anyways. They also add cooked green onions to the garlic noodles to garnish which I love. Portions are HUGE and I typically make two meals out of one order! I came here when I was vegetarian (two years ago) and their Vegetarian Garlic noodles option has a vermicelli-vegetable stir fry combo included that was also surprisingly really good.

Perilla has satisfied my garlic noodle crave and that's a lot coming from a garlic lover like me. Unfortunately, I feel like this place is a little underrated (only locals know about this lovely place I'm guessing?) because each time I go, it's usually quite empty! Maybe its because I come in during after lunch hours (2-3pm) so it may have died down. But I've came here a few times and found this to be a little odd because this place is amazing! \n\nFood: Besides that, the food here pretty much hits the spot. I ordered the charbroiled pork with garlic noodles if I remember correctly. The noodles are chewy and filled with just enough garlic flavor. The charbroiled pork is nicely tendered yet chewy at the same time and complimented the garlic noodles perfectly! Other than the noodles, the entree included: a generous amount of the pork, two pieces of broccoli, and a nice dipping sauce (sweet and sourish fish sauce?) on the side. The portions are pretty big so I usually ask them for a box and even when I reheat it later on, it's still delicious! Thinking about this dish is making me have some serious withdrawals. Wished I had some to eat right now, yum! \n\nCustomer Service: I can tell that they make their customer service a priority because the staffs are all really nice! Once you walk in, you're greeted with a smile and seats are available right away. Menus and water are brought out quickly and they wait a good amount of time before they take your order. Each time I'm there, my waiter was a nice, pleasant guy who wore glasses. He is well trained and is really well mannered! He makes sure to check up on you and go around for water refill.

One of the waiters was confused and thought we ordered only 1 to share, but that was quickly taken care of when the waitress came over. \n\nOur food came out pretty fast. So, we were thinking that the garlic noodles had already been cooked and were prepared to go. We also thought that because the garlic noodles weren't even hot. They were just warm like they had been microwaved. Anyway, they were still good though with just the right amount of garlic. \n\nThe 5 spice chicken was very tasty and the skin was crispy. You could tell it was well-marinated and not overcooked. We literally ate everything off our plates! \n\nWe found it hard to talk over someone who was fixing a table with a loud drill, while we were eating so we had to pretty much yell at each other. Luckily, the guy wasn't drilling the whole time we were there. Other than that randomness, service was ok. \n\nOverall, I would definitely come back to have the same thing again! It was delicious!

It's heavy on carbs and protein, and the portion sizes are very generous. I actually think I prefer the grilled pork so I will go with that next time. It included two steamed and cold spears of broccoli to cut through the heaviness of the butter in the garlic noodles as well as the fried crispy rolls. Service was kind of meh, but they were fairly quick with preparing and serving the food. The interior is spacious if not fancy. Also, it can get really loud inside because Perilla seems to be a favorite gathering place of families with young children who like to make a lot of noise!

Before we could even get our bodies into the restaurant, a lady shouted that they were closed, even though you could clearly see that people were still enjoying their not-even-half-eaten-meals. We were pretty bummed out. We stood in front of the door, outside of course, for about a minute and decided to go back in to see if we could order garlic noodles to go.

And the garlic noodles were perfect -- very buttery and garlicky and smelled just the way it tasted. Portion-wise, it filled me up but with no leftovers. \n\nI would definitely come back again and try other items! Overall, Perilla doesn't have a huge selection of food as does other Vietnamese places in the Sunset, but the food here is still great! The delicious GARLIC NOODLES will keep me coming back!! :)", "author": "Priscilla W."}

I had lunch here following my Japanese Tea Garden volunteer project.\n\nIt's a good sign when a restaurant is filled with patrons on a late Sunday afternoon.  Lucky for me there was a single table right next to the window available.  The waiter who greeted me gestured for me to take that table.  There was some residue on the table leftover from previous diners so the waiter came back to wipe the crumbs of diced garlic away.  Some of it landed in my lap.  It didn't bother me that much though because my pants had caked on mud from the garden.\n\nAlong with the menu comes a big glass of water with no ice!  I'm accustomed to having some ice cubes to chew on, but this water was room temperature.  Blah!  I ordered the Golden Fried Quail appetizer and the Five Spice Chicken Garlic Noodles plus a soft drink.\n\nAs is true of their original location the kitchen service here is very good.  Even for fried quail which I expect additional preparation  time for mine came back pretty quickly.  The quail (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RNy3_hU1N2qyS5PVc9RaYQ?select=byT8qXOpINIq7TGRdzjcrw) was a bit small in size but it was excellent in flavor.  Parts of the bone in the tiny wings were fried up so crispy that it was easy to just eat it with what little skin and meat there was on the wings.  In case you've never had quail this photo (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RNy3_hU1N2qyS5PVc9RaYQ?select=PPmBug_kLN2ib6PoJDnHRQ) shows the little delicacy at approximately 1.5 times of its actual size.  I enjoyed the quail slowly trying to pull away all the available meat.  It was fried up hot too so I had little choice but to it eat it slow.\n\nThe Five Spice Chicken Garlic Noodles (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RNy3_hU1N2qyS5PVc9RaYQ?select=ph01kGlwa8ZA2YKSJTNdJg) had arrived shortly after the quail so it had already begun cooling while I tried to finish off the quail.  The chicken was fried up with crispy skin on the outside and tender, juicy meat on the inside.  The seasoning was very good, but for a leg quarter that was supposed to be boneless I bit into two tiny shards of bone and spit out several pieces of chicken cartilage.  The garlic noodles were excellent in flavor with firm noodles and lots of finely diced garlic.\n\nThe waiter forgot to bring my soft drink though, and since he didn't come back once the food was on my table I had to flag down another waitress to get my soda.  No other complaints though.  I'll return because the food is very good.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

The only thing I could think of updating there would be a newer facility and adding garlic noodles on their menu.  Well guess what?  They did it at Perilla!\n\nOwned by the same people as PPQ (and Toasties for that matter), Perilla offers almost the exact same menu as their sister location and at essentially the same prices.  The types of pho are pretty much the same (BEEF SATAY PHO!!!), and they also have the usual vermecelli and rice plates as well; the only thing I could see missing were the entrees.  However, certainly worth the trade-off to gain garlic noodle plates.\n\nEssentially, just imagine a charbroiled meat rice plate (some with the same kick-ass imperial rolls) but take out the rice for noodles.  The best part though, is that the noodles aren't heavy on butter or oil,and they taste great!  It'd be one thing if it was offered just cause - in this case, it's actually good!\n\nThe servers are nice, friendly, and funny to boot.  We were there on Friday night for dinner at around 8:30, and was surprised to see that they actually close at 9:00 (kind of early, especially for the area).  However, stragglers were still coming in despite the posted hours, and the workers were happy to take them in (\"Come in, don't be scared!  These people seem to like their food!\").

My non-pho-savvy friends were astonished that the meat came out pink and uncooked and marveled at its transformation to a satisfying grey color as I stirred it in the steamy hot soup. They give more meat than other pho restaurants! The noodle portions are likewise generous and I might not have actually finished had I not been absolutely famished at this particular mealtime. My friends got the vegetarian pho and claimed that the broth was simply boiled water; however my soup was pleasantly savory so I would definitely stick to the meat noodle varieties if you're an omnivore. \n\nThe front of the restaurant is decently clean. The walls are maroon and the furniture dark in color, which actually gives the place a pretty classy look overall.

From the outside it doesn't look great and judging by the choice of condiments and chopsticks on the table one would assume that they were Chinese rather than Vietnamese or at most Chinese Viets. Anyway going in we were met with a very friendly waiter who actually gave us top notch service throughout our stay. The menu is simple and easy to navigate with nothing too complicated. My advise is the Pho. Anything else is not compulsory. The broth is sweet and quite light, not heavy and thick like some places; It has been filtered quite a bit it seems. Second is the choice of topping. I ordered the Perilla Beef Combo Pho which includes meat balls, beef brisket and rare beef. The meat balls are lovely, and have a great texture to them: what you really look for in a properly made meat ball - not process and filled with fillers. The brisket was passable in my opinion and didn't really stand out. However the rare beef was as it should be - rare. On my occasion the beef was sweet and juicy with a strong beefy flavour. \nEven the two above mentioned ingredients didn't really shout justice until I munched into a mouthful of the noodles. The noodles, cooked to a perfect state were almost chewy to effect, not soft and sloppy. They had a definite counter-action when I bit down on it- the perfect texture (again in my opinion). Oftentimes we're let down by over cooked noodles that have been soaking in a pot for hours. Not here!\n\nThe other thing to mention is their five spices chicken. It's grilled, tastes great, smells even better and looks the real deal. Most importantly for me is that they use thigh meat (dark) rather than dry breast meat (white). I feel that they have put good attention to many of their dishes and thus have differentiated themselves from the average money busting rip off Vietnamese Pho joint. Too add to the food - the service was 10/10. Couldn't have asked for a better server. He was keen, had an eye for detail and explained the dishes well. (Well done you!). The total bill came to $31 for three of us which is very decent indeed especially when it's both yummy and filling. We couldn't finish it all so had to get a take out box. That's what you call bargain. \n\nWould I go there again? Hell yea! Go with friends and family, partners, bros, girls the lot. My only true tip: don't be afraid of the funny placement of their customer toilet. You have to cut through part of their kitchen first. But it's maintained well. Enjoy!", "author": "C G S."}

Sadly to say, that was my experience with the Five Spice Chicken with Garlic Noodles at Perilla.\n\nThe only good thing of my meal:\n- Five Spice Chicken: The skin was crisp and the meat was juicy and so flavorful. Only negative is that it was also super greasy, but all things tasty usually are :(\n\nNot so good things:\n- Garlic noodles: I had high hopes, but this was just oily and lacking in concentrated garlic flavor. The noodles were mushy and dry, but the garlic-infused oil did nothing to add to it. Blah all around.\n- Rare beef pho: So I guess I could have figured out that this \"fusion\" Vietnamese place wouldn't have the most authentic pho, but I didn't think it was worth the $8 at all.\n- Spring rolls: These are advertised as having six pieces but they're really just 3 finger-sized rolls cut into 2 pieces. Not so tasty either.\n- Parking: I guess this is a given in San Francisco.

Usually when you find restaurants serving garlic noodles, they are surprisngly overpriced. I do not understand why because garlic noodles are so simple to make! So going to Perilla was like discovering a hidden gem because their dishes are cheap and delicious! \n\n2. The 5 Spice Chicken and Garlic Noodles (#21) is a MUST for first timers! Their chicken seriously is bomb. It does have enough spice to it to add all the flavors needed to make this dish tasty. Their chicken also reminds me of King of Thai for those of you who have tried the Fried Rice with Fried Chicken. The noodles are pretty firm and just so good! It has just enough garlic in it and it isn't as buttery as some garlic noodle places. \n\n3. The portion size is incomparable to the price. $7.50 for tons of food?! I'm there! \n\n3 reasons are enough for you to just come here and check this place out. I love how it is Vietnamese as well. It isn't your typical Vietnamese place.

It is a bit on the greasy and oily side but that's basically what most Asian dishes are like. Its really good but sometimes the noodle may be a little burnt which I get disappointed but so far it had only happened once. \n\nThe Beef with imperial roll and garlic noodle is delicious too. It's my sister's favorite and I love it the beef is so juicy, it's not dry. The imperial rolls are a great snack on the side. They are crunchy and bite size so it compliments the dish perfectly. It also comes with 2 pieces of broccoli so you do have veggies on the plate and won't feel as guilty. You will most definitely be a stuffed and happy camper after you are done with the meal. \n\nI've accidently ordered these combinations but with vermicelli noodles instead and I didn't like it at all. It comes with the really bitter leaves and I'm not a fan of that. Aside from that it's just that they do go as well with the combination as it does with the chewy, thick, and warm garlic egg noodles.  \n\nI always come back for more or bring new friends to try it. Sometimes we just crave it, it's kind of like crack for us.

We got our drinks, and one, who had came late, ordered one as well, and that's when she gave us an attitude asking if any one else wants one and angrily walks away.\n\nOur food finally arrives, and it looked interesting; think of alfredo pasta. The beef was definitely good and flavorful. The same goes to the garlic noodles. It also came with a, I wouldn't say fish sauce, but a sauce to dip your food in.

I'd gladly pay $14+ a dish for this, but to only see $9 was amazing.\n\nThe garlic noodles are delicious and cheap.  I've tried the five spice chicken (great albeit a bit fatty), beef (solid, esp if you like lemongrass), curry chicken (delicious and adds another flavor layer to the garlic noodles).....

If the way to my heart is through my stomach...Perilla's got mine! \n\nIf you haven't guessed already, my favorite thing here is the garlic noodles!

And when combined with creamy yellow curry and chunks of tender chicken, it's beyond words. \n\nWhile it doesn't come with garlic noodles, the chicken curry pho is pretty amazing too. It's rich, creamy and super tasty. I happen to LOVE all things curry and this was no exception. Gotta try at least one of these dishes if you come here. Or better yet? Try both! \n\nAs for service, it is great! Fast, friendly, and very attentive. The food portions are also large and the prices are low (under $10).

Reasonably priced but perhaps you get what you pay for.  \n\nThe papaya salad was lackluster and plain and the full container sat in the fridge until it was finally thrown away.\n\nThe summer rolls seemed tasty at first but the skin roll was dry and the ingredients inside rather bland thereby necessitating the accompanying sauce for any kind of flavor. \n\nEven though we had (3) orders of pho, we only received two bags of vegetables. Initially there had been three bags but for some unknown reason the staff member removed the third bag from our order so needless to say, there weren't enough veggies for the three phos. Very disappointing. There was a sprig of basil in each bag, a lemon slice, some jalapenos, and some lackluster, borderline fresh bean sprouts that probably wouldn't be good to serve the next day. \n\nThe pho broth was mediocre. It tasted like reconstituted beef broth bouillon from the asian food store.  There was no rich flavor from long simmering beef, nope, none of that. It was quite possibly one of the worst broths I've ever had.  The sliced beef tasted terrible and the whole experience was so numbing that I stopped eating. \n\nThey put the noodles and beef in one bowl and the noodles were all clumped together and when you pulled out the noodles they broke apart. \n\nA terribly mediocre and unsatisfying experience.", "author": "Melissa K."}

My picky SO enjoyed the veggie garlic noodles. I really appreciate that with their plates, they give broccoli on the side. I love broccoli and it's not overcooked. They even season it a little bit with something, I think or perhaps it's the aromas and condensation permeating into the green flesh, soaking up the garlic goodness.

The pork and veggie inside the rolls are delicious and the dipping sauce, which is good too but to me, not needed. I just pop them into my mouth and it's gone. lol #30 and #51 each had 6 pieces of the deep fried rolls with a healthy (\"healthy\" how are butter infused noodles \"healthy\"? lol I don't care! Gimme!) amount of delicious garlic noodles. Oh and some broccoli. Who says I'm not healthy? ;) \n\n#59 was pretty good but if I had meat options at a place like this, I'm ordering the meat. It's good though and I also liked the Curry chicken soup which had a good spicy kick to it but not overpowering for baby spice buds like my tongue that can't handle much. The food tastes even better and more flavorful the following days as leftovers. Everything really infuses into each morsel. Next time, I'd order #27 Imperial rolls & Five spice chicken garlic noodles $10.75\n\nOnly thing is, I wish they offered and had brown rice but that can be because of limited space in kitchen or something. Well, if someone knows the manager/owner of Perilla and can suggest this and make this happen, you can be my friend lol, I'd totally pay extra for this healthier (low sugar spike and more fiber BUT it does have more arsenic...meh give me brown rice please! nom nom I don't care... yum in my tum lol)\n\nI also like the feel of this location better than the one in the financial district.

The rice was horrible though, it was so hard and dry like swallowing pebbles... I don't understand why almost all restaurants serve really hard rice!!! Next time I will just stick to the chicken and garlic noodles. I almost forgot to mention this has probably been one of the best service I ever received from an asian restaurant.", "author": "Julie C."}

It was good in my mind, the cost was reasonable ($7.95 for the noodle with grilled pork, with the pork being quite good also).  It wasn't quite as good as Thanh Long (though it's not quite a side by side comparison).  On the other hand, Thanh Long is on a different level.\n\nAccording to the menu, this is run by the same people that operate PPQ on Irving near 19th Avenue.  That place I always enjoyed their beef pho.

I came with my boyfriend, however, and he did order them with imperial rolls and (charbroiled?) pork. It seems that he really enjoyed his meal and the portions weren't bad at all!\n\nI on the other hand ordered the Beef Satay noodles. On the menu, it said it would be spicy -- it wasn't. It wasn't even it's lack of spiciness that bothered me. It's just that I was able to see all the artificial flavors and oils just floating on top of the soup. It repulsed me but I ate it anyway. I do have to say that their beef literally melted in my mouth without much chewing and I loved it! \n\nJust before this, they messed up on my order and gave me pho instead, which I wish I had decided to keep instead because it looked extremely appetizing. The waitress took it back to the kitchen and I heard them laughing and howling about how the cook messed up the order. Was it really that funny? I guess it was to them. It was so loud that it echoed in the restaurant! Quite disturbing. And the bathroom......... disgusting. Maybe it's just because I'm EXTREMELY germaphobic but it just didn't look clean at all and I was horrified.\n\nI will try to come back next time for the pho and give this place a second chance. 3 stars for the food and I guess I can excuse the decent service.", "author": "Joyce L."}

The vegetarian pho was simple and bland-- vermicelli noodles, broccoli, mushrooms, tofu, and broth. The flavor improved somewhat with the addition of the garnishes they provide and a liberal amount of sriracha. This place reaffirmed the garlic noodles, though, which were pretty close to perfect. The right diameter of noodle, the right amount of what appeared to be freshly minced garlic that had been cooked to the point where the garlic starts to caramelize and get almost a sweet, smoky taste. Not too salty and not too greasy. I would put these noodles in second place after those on the menu at butterfly (embarcadero) and above those found at b.star (inner richmond).\nThere was no other vegetarian dish on the menu that really intrigued us, so if we were to come back, we'd probably order two bowls of the garlic noodles with vegetables and call it a day.", "author": "T K."}

This time, Yummy Yummy lost a few customers to Perilla, but not indefinitely.\n\nAfter perusing through the menu posted on the outside, my friends and I made a quick and somewhat brash decision to go inside as to not appear like arseholes. \n\nA waitress greets us...err, acknowledges our existence and throws a few menus our way. The spot was quite empty at the time, and the coldness of our server wasn't exactly encouraging to my friends and I toward behaving in our typically boisterous ways. Nonetheless, when our waitress returned to take our orders, I opted for the grilled pork and imperial roll rice plate. \n\nFood:\nActually, it was quite good. It was presented really well and I really enjoyed the imperial rolls here. They reminded almost exactly of my favorite rolls that I always get from Champa Garden in oakland. The pork was grilled perfectly and it delivered a bit of smokiness without being the least bit burnt. The accompanying fish sauce i usually have to drown my food in was almost not needed in this case.\n\nFrom what my friend who ordered the grilled chicken garlic noodles told me, he enjoyed the chicken and the fact it was cut in pieces and de-boned was a plus as well. He also mentioned the garlic noodles were not as garlic-y as he would've have preferred. Having had the likes of PPQ in the city, I could understand what he was saying because the noodles didn't emanate the same garlic-y essence the same way the delicious garlic noodles of the more notable restaurants did. \n\nService: \nAs expected from a typical $ dollar sign Viet joint, the service was no frills, but it was honestly hard to even crack a smile or a nod of acknowledgement. This might sound petty but I think something like that or responding to your customer's \"thank you's\" a bit more might go a long way...possibly even earning you that \"people love us on yelp!\" sticker.", "author": "Nick C."}

Be ready to move your chicken around on the plate like I did.\n\nThe garlic noodle was just ok.  I didn't taste the garlic.  Each mouthful I was looking for some garlic and nada.  Did the price of garlic go up and nobody tell me?  Can't help but wonder if there was more of a garlic taste would  they had a gotten another star out of me.  \n\nHmm....all I can say is that I would come back only if I was in the area but I wouldn't make a special trip.", "author": "Cris H."}

This really limits the options available for me to satisfy my friend's request. \n\nWe came in here after searching the area, with plenty of restaurants to be tried, like Park Chow, but only a few limited Vietnamese options and it had relatively positive reviews.

(however, have had better in San Jose at some hole in the walls and bigger chains like Huong Lan).\nGarlic Noodles w/ Five Spice Chicken = Both were well prepared, noodles, perfectly garlic-ky. The five spice chicken was tasty, but wish it was a bit more flavorful.\nVermicelli with charbroiled pork = Pork was cooked well, not tough at all, and went well as a dish with the vermicelli (again, would say I've had better in San Jose)\n\nFood and Quality 4/5.\nService 5/5\nValue 25$. 3/5 (A bit pricey, but fits within the neighborhood standards, but not for what I'm accustomed to).\n\nOverall, friend and I had walked out full, satisfied, and I commented to my friend, you had a taste, but wish you could have been in San Jose for me to show you better.", "author": "Danny N."}

It's a pretty casual restaurant, and it's very clean inside.  We were very quickly greeted and the waitress suggested that we pick whichever table we wanted to sit at.  She brought us over menus and glasses of cucumber water.  It seems that many of the customers here are repeat customers- the waitress came over to our table just after a couple minutes and asked if we were ready to order, but since it was my first time actually dining in the restaurant, I wanted to take my time and thoroughly browse the menu.   After a couple more minutes, a waiter came back to take our orders.  He was quite friendly and just memorized what we ordered.\n\nFive spice chicken with vermicelli noodles ($6.95): This was a huge bowl of yummy noodles and a generous portion of chicken too.  First off, the chicken was really good.  It was very \"tender and moist,\" as their menu states and full of flavor.  The chicken did have a little bit more fat/skin then I was expecting- but I embraced it, and it was delicious.  The skin is nice a crispy too.  The noodles are like any other plain vermicelli noodles.  I like to pour the fish sauce over the noodles.  \n\nOverall, the food was very tasty. The portions are very fair- it was plenty of food- so it ended up being my lunch and my dinner.  The food is made fresh to order and the drinks I saw at other tables looked good too.  The waiter and waitress consistently came by our table to check in and see how we were doing.  They refilled our waters several times and when I asked for a box to take my leftovers to-go, they even boxed it for me.  The service is right on.\n\nNotes:\n-Look for street parking, there isn't a parking lot.  Street parking is usually manageable, depending on the time.\n-A lot of people love their garlic noodles.  I've had these to-go several times and they are definitely worth a try.", "author": "Samantha L."}

I had to steal pieces of beef from his plate. I ordered the coconut curry chicken w/ garlic noodles which was \"okay\", but the chicken was a little bland and grisly. Bad choice in general for me though... curry and garlic noodles--what was I thinking? I prefer eating curry with rice usually....

Not really...\n\nI got the combo plate of garlic noodles with five spice chicken and it also came with dipping sauce and a side of pickled veggies, which was an excellent contrast to the heaviness of the noodles.

After overcoming the initial frustration that my beloved neighborhood had decided to up and change without my blessing, I bit the bullet and gave Perilla a try. \n\nMy friend and I had heard that Perilla was the cheap eats offspring of PPQ and once we heard the words \"garlic\" and \"cheap\" we were hooked. Surprisingly when you walk in, there isn't any kind of waft of garlic, although when you look at every single person's table there's a huge pile of noodles sitting there staring at you, tempting you, and making you salivate. \n\nI can really only rave about one dish here, because I'm a creature of habit (plus an Irving St pho devotee) and once I had the ordered the combo plate of Five Spiced Chicken, Imperial Rolls, and Garlic Noodles there really wasn't trying anything else. AMAZING. The garlic noodles are the best I've had, the chicken is amazingly crispy and juicy, the imperial rolls are delicious, and they have pickled veggies as a garnish--which really just seals the deal. And the portions are huge! It always lasts me 2 meals. \n\nDID I MENTION ALL OF THAT WAS ONLY $8.95? I would literally drive home every weekend to get this. Although I'm well past my freshmen years and couldn't face the embarrassment of putting on a Senior 15. \n\n*on a sidenote, the garlic  will literally seep out of your pores, so you probably don't want to eat here on a date or before one. or do. i did it, mostly because i have no shame and because I really couldn't resist eating Perilla. seriously, worth it. plus if somebody can't handle you at your garlicky-est, quite frankly they don't deserve to have you.", "author": "Michelle Q."}

I stood there another 10 minutes annoyed that there was no seating for patrons that are waiting for to go orders or a table when it becomes available. I was left standing in the obscure corner next to the utensil, flatware prep table waiting for my food.

The noodles were too cheesy and you can taste that it's been sitting there for awhile before they had served it.  The chicken tasted just regular, which I've had better elsewhere.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I both ordered a plate, except he got the Grilled Pork.  NOT good either!  We barely touched our meal and the total came to $20...a waste of my $20 and lunch!\n\nDefinitely not worth trying and would never come back!", "author": "Nancy S."}

He was very nice and I was impressed by his ability to man the phones, the patrons, and the food at the same time.\n\nUnfortunately the cuisine was pretty disappointing from start to finish.  The papaya salad was made from those super-thin grated strands that come in a bag... it had almost no flavor.  There were no shrimp, green beans, or tomatoes, and the sauce was actually an egg roll dipping sauce rather than the traditional one.  So that was my first red flag.  And the tea was lukewarm.\n\nThe garlic noodles with bbq pork and egg rolls was really greasy.  The pork was alright, but the noodles and egg rolls tasted like a coronary disaster.  The pho was the best part of the meal, but it wasn't anything remarkable.  I could have been hotter.\n\nThe whole meal was pretty inexpensive (around $30 for two), but I don't think I'll be returning, especially since there are so many exciting options for dinner within a few steps from Perilla.", "author": "Mari C."}

Perhaps I enjoyed it a little too much since I'm getting over a cold and anything with soup makes my eyes sparkle and light up.. hahaha. \nMy friend got the garlic noodles with chicken meal. It looked delicious as well. Apparently she frequently comes to this place when she's in the neighborhood.. Which I now understand why. lol.\nGood service.

And before that drove another 30 minutes from Milpitas!\n\nHungry guy + traffic in SF = Cranky monster.\n\nGood thing I'm like, the best company ever and time went by quickly :) We danced and sang to EDM music while slowly making our way down 19th Avenue and FINALLY arrived at about 12 noon.\n\nI think it was definitely worth it just because I'm obsessed with garlic noodles. I ordered the #29, which consists of garlic noodles, egg rolls, and beef. He ordered something similar as well.\n\nFor $10 I got a huge plate that I could barely finish. I think for what Vincent paid for, I got everything I wanted! The egg rolls were actually really good. The taste of the beef was similar to what I've had before, but it was also lean. I didn't have to trim any fat off. The garlic noodles were, of course, delicious! But I'm still on that search to find THE BEST GARLIC NOODLES EVERRRR.\n\nThe service here was good too. Sometimes Vincent couldn't understand the lady because she had a heavy accent. And we both thought it was weird that our water tasted like cucumbers. Yes, cucumbers. They put several slices in a pitcher they use to serve you. Normally, I eat cucumbers, not drink them. Nontheless, I didn't mind at all. \n\nI'd definitely come back.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-01-07", "description": "First the positives:\n\n1) Their pork vermicelli is a 5-star deserving quality. The meat is thick, perfectly marinated and grilled. Pho is about average, maybe a bit above average. \n\n2) They have innovative menu (garlic noodles, five-spice chicken) that separates them from other Vietnamese restaurants. \n\nHowever, here are some negatives:\n\n1) Service: They are super skimpy on napkins. You get exactly ONE napkin unless you ask for more, at which point you get additional ONE more napkin. This is okay the first couple of times, but when you keep getting into situations where you have to ask for napkins, it gets really old and start to question if they are trying to save money by being really stingy on napkins. \nAnother negative point about their service is that they are not exactly friendly. We once had a group of 6 people, 5 of whom paid with credit card. I know this isn't the most fun thing to do for the merchant, but we also did not deserve a treatment where the waitress literally slapped/threw the plastic tray for the bill on the table and went away. Situations like this make you want to stop coming to the restaurant regardless of the quality of food. \n\n2) Cleanliness: The restroom at the restaurant takes away any kind of appetite you might have had prior to stepping into that room of nastiness. It doesn't matter if you starved for weeks. Once you walk into that restroom, you just want to throw up and starve for another week. It is disgusting. \nFurthermore, I saw the cashier sorting through basil leaves and sprouts on the countertop at the front desk!!! There was no tray/plastic barrier or whatsoever. The veggies were flat out laid right on top of the front desk counter top! Don't they have a different surface area, hopefully in the kitchen, to do something like that? This shows that the restaurant not only lacks cleanliness but also some common sense that you do not prepare food, esp food that will be consumed raw, on the surface that is not meant for food preparation (and definitely not next to money). Anybody who saw this would be gawking at the scene. Restaurants just should NOT do things like this.\n\nFood is about 3 stars, not life changing, not inedible. But the two points I mentioned above bring it down to 1.5 stars, but I give 2 stars rounding it up.", "author": "Jane M."}

The chicken was very well flavored and tender. The skin was just the right amount of crispy tasty texture! It was good quality chicken cooked perfectly. The pickled cabbage really helped increase your appetite for the food and the fish sauce was made really well too. The garlic noodles smelled just as good as it tasted! Full of the garlic aroma! YUM!\n2) Charbroiled Beef and garlic noodles: This dish came with strips of charbroiled beef, garlic noodles, pickled cabbage and fish sauce. The beef was very well made! So tender and full of bbq flavor. You can literally make your mouth water if you just smelled the beef on it's own. The garlic noodles really complimented the dish, along with the pickled cabbage and some fish sauce for extra dipping. Everything was very well made!  \n3) Three color bean drink: I was kinda disappointed because there were only TWO colors and not three. Normally, there is a green jelly layer bathed in coconut milk, a red bean layer, and a yellow bean layer. \n However, the green jelly layer was missing in this drink. Instead it was replaced by a clear jelly that is not nearly as good as the green jelly. But it was still pretty good, a bit too sweet, but still pretty good. \n\nService: Kinda forgot about us as my water never even got refilled. But overall, pretty nice and friendly. \n\nAmbiance: Just a typical restaurant. It was clean and well kept.

So excited/distracted that I forget to check that everything is there.  Run for the N.

I should have checked!  WHAT!? No bean sprouts, onion, chilies, basil, onion, or spicy sauces?? All the things that make up pho completely left out? \n\n3 stars mainly based on the fact that the condiments were left out (mainly my fault for not checking) And if you don't have the condiments, well you don't have pho!\n\nSO, basically I payed $7 for beef broth, broccoli and tofu :( because I didn't even order it with meat :( The shitake were exceptionally chewy, and they didn't give you that much tofu (I mean when you order w/tofu, I think they should give you more than 4 or 5 pieces).

So I dragged (which wasn't a hard task) by BFF here. \n\nThe parking situation was fairly easy not anything like Clement St. The restaurant was very well lit and super clean. We both had dishes with garlic noodles. I mean let's face it, I'm all about sharing but garlic noodles, mango anything and ice cream, I'm like an ill tempered dog from the Dog Whisperer with food guarding issues. We had to order our tea as I guess water is just the norm and tea has to be requested. \n\nThe imperial rolls were perfect. They were the right size and not at all soggy. The noodles also had the right balance of garlic and not oily at all. I will definitely return to try um, basically every dish on the menu.

With his luck, our first choice wasn't open until 5pm and our second choice wasn't open at all! We settled for third and ended up at Perilla!\n\nOur first impressions were that the restaurant was small and very clean. We were seated immediately upon arrival as there were no other customers. We started off with the papaya salad with charbroiled beef (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RNy3_hU1N2qyS5PVc9RaYQ?select=zw0FDaMoxoSw2gnDUJVf4g). Man, the portion was huge! It came with freshly julienned papaya, basil, carrots, peanuts, dried shallots, and a ton of charbroiled beef. The flavors of the charbroiled beef and veggies complemented with the fish sauce DELICIOUSLY. Next time, I'd probably prefer the papaya salad with poached shrimp instead...the beef was a little too heavy as a starter for me. We then ordered 2 orders of imperial rolls (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RNy3_hU1N2qyS5PVc9RaYQ?select=iWz-T5a2bmd2ferjrGJL2w) and five spice chicken garlic noodle and 1 order of charbroiled pork rice plate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RNy3_hU1N2qyS5PVc9RaYQ?select=jyWQX5GrkY16ZcNdNvyLzg). The imperial rolls and five spice chicken garlic noodle were definitely a hit! The imperial rolls were extra crispy and filled with tons of ground pork and veggies. The five spice chicken was crispy outside, but juicy inside--it was sooo good! The garlic noodles were just A-OK for me...I guess I was expecting the noodles to be more garlicky, but the garlic flavor ended up being very subtle. Overall,  I think I was more excited for the five spice chicken than the garlic noodles. Sigh...oh well, I'm still a fan though!\n\nAnd oh, the service was great--quick and friendly.\nStreet parking was such a drag.", "author": "Lien T."}

Would you feature it on your limited menu of specialized magic tricks?  \n\nOr would you omit it until you could actually perform that trick?  Something along the lines of: I'm sorry, that's not part of the boutique magic tricks provided.

The side of pickled cabbage serves as a nice balance to the rich and fatty meat and noodles. The pork and chicken are both super tasty.

However I no longer have my praise about the perfectly layered sliced of rare beef, and LOTS of them, like I used to.\n\nThe second and third time I've been here, it seems like they stopped layering the meat in the center of the bowl like pretty pink blossom, and they no longer are giving you almost 1/2\" thick layers of meat like they used to.

But now, my bowls of pho looks like just a nicer quality version of rare beef pho and not something that knocks my socks off.

There are plenty of tables with no reservations needed.  I don't even think they take reservations at this point.  This place has the same layout as Toasties except that they have more lighting to make the place look brighter and cleaner.  Perilla is now part of the family of restaurants with PPQ crab and Toasties.  The owners are chinese, but they speak some Vietnamese which means they probably grew up in vietnam.  So that means this place can't be too bad.  \n\nTheir menu is simple, serving from Pho, vermicelli dishes, broken rice dishes, and their (as well as PPQ's) specialty of 5 spice chicken and garlic noodles.  Garlic noodles seems to be their thing.  We ordered what everyone else had--5 spice chicken and garlic noodles with imperial rolls, as well as the charbroiled bbq pork vermicelli, and chicken curry.  The curry smelled delicious when it came out... but at taste, it was very bland.  The chicken and garlic noodles were really good, but I would share this dish as it can be on the heavy side with the oily noodles.  The noodles were good but a little oily.  The 5 spice chicken had lots of flavor and a nice crunchy outer layer to it... it was really good.  I'm usually not a fan of the imperial rolls because it's not as crispy and tends to be harder to chew... but Perilla makes great imperial rolls!  The spring roll wrap was definitely fried all the way and didn't have the \"i'm-going-to-rip-out-my-teeth\" feeling.  YUMMM.  As for the vermicelli noodles, they were standard as any other pho place.  For those of you who don't know how to eat it, it is a bowl with lettuce and cucumbers at the bottom of the bowl with a layer of rice vermicelli noodles on top and meat.  You pour about 3/4 of the sauce into the bowl and mix the noodles, lettuce and cucumbers with the sauce...like tossing a salad.  The sauce is really what makes this dish so good... if you don't add it, you're not getting the full Vietnamese taste and it will just taste bland. The portions for all the dishes were good and decently priced ( a little higher than pho restaurants).\n\nOverall, food was good, service was good, and ambience was ok. For 4 dishes, we paid about $10 each after tax and tip.  I would definitely come back here again... Still need to judge their pho =P", "author": "Diane L."}

The garlic noodle with 5 spice chicken and imperial rolls. The dish is delicious; however, there are times where it is not consistent. There are times where it tastes better, which makes me worry every time I decide to eat there. Recently, it was not great; the noodles lacked garlic favor and were actually too bland. Normally, I like my food with less salt and favor, but this time it was like they forgot to add the flavor. The chicken was great, but there might be times where they give you the ends which tend to be ruff and dry. So it can be a hit or miss with ordering this dish.\nOne thing is I have not tried any other dishes, which is my fault so I am unable to give a full evaluation and rate them.

This place is a block off from that restaurant. Overall I like the place. they offer a lot of dishses it seems that are not offered at other places. My main complaint is about the food. Everything seemed to be a little bit fatty for my taste. I got the spring rolls with pork, and it was very greasy but pretty good. My boyfriend got the rare beef pho and I could see that it was not strained completely. The food was still good tho, and the people at the next table had garlic noodles, which i think the restaurant is rather well known for.\n\nSo overall, I prefer going to Yummy Yummy, but if I were in the area I would give this place a shot again. The prices are very good, and the staff seems very nice. Food takes a little bit longer to come out than at other pho restaurants, so like 10 minutes. Lol", "author": "Steph G."}

It was packed on Saturday night and we were seated close to a couple who looked like they were enjoying themselves.  Rather than make a scene, I waited until they left and told the owner quietly (I assume he is the owner since I've seen him there twice already) that there was a piece of hair in my roll.  He took it away and said \"no charge.\"  Wow, I wasn't expecting THAT from an Asian joint.  Awesome.\n\n2nd visit - I miscalculated the total on my credit card receipt and they charged me the lesser value.  They could have entered the higher amount since that was what I wrote on the receipt, but they didn't.

I thought to myself...finally a bossy pho joint, Ive been dying for a go to place that isnt in the TL. Not that theres anything wrong with that. \nI waited for a day when my resident asian was off of work so I could take her with me.  She has been wanting korean BBQ but I said this Pho place came first. Well, long story short, the place they had told me about was Perilla, and not only was it not new, but I had been there over a year earlier with the very friends who recommended it to me. Disappointed to say the least. \nIm not knocking Perilla for that, its not their fault I had high hopes, but I will say a year later, my experience was none different. \nI wont say the service was bad, because for that to be the case, it would have had to existed. I gave the waiter every possible cue that I was ready to order (menus on the side of the table, lots of eye contact etc) but it took a wave to place my order. After that we were on our own. The water cups are little rocks glasses and mine was 3/4 filled. I never got a refill despite being done with it before my food even came. I love my Pho spicy, and its pretty dang salty to begin with so water is a must. No water ruins my meal. \nThis would be something Id tolerate if the Pho was good, but it wasnt. Super super bland. And cold. The noodles were cold which is cool, because the broth usually warms them up but this broth was luke and so the rock of noodle barely came apart. Strips of meat instead of round, which was interesting, but not better. So yeah. Generally a dissapointment. \n\nOne note_ the dishes are all under 10 bucks which for SF, isnt bad.

BUT I have to give the \"Best Five Spice Vermicelli\" award to Yummy Yummy. The proportions were a bit off at Perilla- too much chicken and not enough vermicelli.  Also, my bowl was only half full! The beansprouts, ground peanuts, and romaine lettuce was nothing special and not as fresh as  Yummy yummy.\n\nMy bf ordered the Satay Pho which is similar to PPQ in Outer Sunset which is no surprise since both are owned by the same people.  BUT the Satay Pho at Perilla is a bit lighter on the satay sauce.\n\nThe decor at Perilla is more modern, simpler and roomier than Yummy Yummy which makes it a good place for students to hang out. However if I'm craving my Five Spice Chicken Vermicelli, I'll be heading over to Yummy Yummy..sorry Perilla!", "author": "Shirley W."}

Perilla offers seriously good garlic noodle dishes with crunchy spring rolls and dipping sauce.  I can't say I was a fan of Toasties (predecessor) and wasn't sure how close to PPQ this would be, but was pleasantly surprised:  few can pull off Asian Fusion in a casual way and do it right.\n\nNow is all a bit on the heavy side so prepare for large combo portions, but the price is A-1.\n\nGive it a shot.", "author": "Jim W."}

Also, the presentation of the food is amazing. All of these yelp photos made me want to drool and I was so so so excited to try it out.\n\nI got the garlic noodles along with the imperial rolls and the chicken, and I was not impressed at all...the imperial rolls were meh, the garlic noodles were pretty good but it seemed like a pretty simple recipe, and for my first meal of the day I was not inhaling the food like I usually do, and the chicken was very standard. By no means was it bad, but it was very average to me. \n\nMy friend got the pho, and as a guy new to Vietnamese cuisine he liked it. I will admit- it looked very mouthwatering, especially after being disappointed from my first few bites from the garlic noodles, but when we seasoned it with everything it still did not taste good to me.. broth was weird, like the beef bones/chicken were not left in long enough and it was just overall not flavorful... I would say that maybe it was just healthy and msg-less, but my momma makes pho without much msg at all and it tastes much better than here. Guess no place beats my momma's home-made pho. \n\nMaybe it's good compared to other Vietnamese places around the city, but the only Vietnamese food I like in the city would be Vietnamese sandwiches...otherwise I have yet to be impressed by any Vietnamese places in San Francisco (would rather go to San Jose for that), but for Vietnamese-fusion cuisine this is A-ok...would not come back, but would not go out of my way to stay away.", "author": "Anna T."}

I was really excited because I knew they had garlic noodles and I LOVE GARLIC NOODLES (Thanh Long is amazing).  We were seated right away.  Being Vietnamese I never eat out at Vietnamese restaurants because my mom cooks the best Vietnamese food period!  But the woman can't make garlic noodles so I gave Perilla a chance.  I was on a quest to figure out if this was a real Vietnamese place or one some other group decided to open.  Then I heard the waiters speak Chinese to together.  Seriously?  Ouy.\n\nTHE FOOD:\nMy boyfriend ordered the combination Pho and I had warned him that it wouldn't be as good as my mom's.  Well once again the girlfriend was right.  The broth was bland and the soup wasn't even hot enough to cook the raw beef!  HUH? I had the garlic noodles with imperial rolls (egg rolls) and beef.  It was alright not good enough to make me come back.  I also ordered a Thai iced tea that tasted deluded.  That is a complete \"no-no\".  Overall the food was just alright, and alright does not cut it when I can get the same food (minus the garlic noodles) cooked so much better for FREE from my mom!  Again ouy.\n\nTHE SERVICE:\nIt was fine.  The main waiter kept coughing up a storm which was gross.  The food came out fast.  All our food with tip cost us $26 which seems like a lot for a Vietnamese place (I'm use to going to the T.L for Vietnamese food so that may be why). \n\nOverall:\nWill not be coming back.

Ok, not really a show, but there's still lunch. \n\nAs we sat down for lunch, we order a Coke to quench that nagging thirst we worked up walking down here on a very rare sunny, hot day in the inner Sunset. The guy walks up to the table with a frosty Coke in one hand and a glass of ice in the other. He starts talking, we're not really hearing what he's saying, but he pops open the can and starts dumping Coke into the glass of ice. He sets the can (still emptying) on top of the glass and we watch with growing trepidation as the beverage quickly reaches critical volume. With a deft swipe of his wrist, he rescues the can and sets it down on the table, averting certain disaster. As the kicker, he takes the can, remaining Coke still inside, and leans it over to balance on its edge! All before we can even place our lunch order. Phew. \n\nI've been here several times and the quality is very good, although a few bucks more expensive than some other vietnamese restaurants in the area. Pho is $6-7 a bowl. Bun is about the same. The garlic noodles are the same they have at PPQ, so if you like them there, you should like them here. The options are pretty much the same across the board, so you choose your meat and decide if you want it with the garlic noodles, pho, vermicelli, or rice. The pho does have its MSG, though, so beware if you're one of those people that gets MSG brain. The five spices chicken is a sliced boneless chicken leg/thigh crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Good flavor too, but it comes with the fish sauce to dip for your dining pleasure. The fried imperial rolls are delicious. Fried, fried, deliciousness. But you also get a few leaves of green lettuce to wrap around them. I like the pickled vegetables they add to the meals. \n\nOverall an excellent choice for the Inner Sunset.

Anyway, Perilla has got some kind of futuristic phone system going because dude always knows my phone number and it saves my name and address.  I should also note that my husband works second shift, so by the time he gets to his noodles, he's eating them cold, and he *still* loves them.  I wish I could convey to you in this short space what a persnickety diner my husband can be.  This is high high praise.\n\nAlso, maybe it's because we're just up the hill (about 5 blocks from the restaurant), but these guys deliver lightning fast.  My doorbell rings about 10 minutes after I hang up the phone each time.  Other restaurants in the area with delivery service never even come close to that.

The 3 colored drink was ok, nothing outstanding. The coffee was, in my opinion, very good, but for what seemed like a shot or two of coffee and an OD amount of ice, it's quite pricey ($3).\n\nServers were very friendly if you're wondering. \nWould come back if I was in the neighborhood.", "author": "Kenneth L."}

So much had changed since 2005 and we wanted some Vietnamese food, so we consulted our good and (usually) trustworthy yelp app and it brought us here.  We weren't too hungry so we split a bowl of pho and an order of spring rolls.\nNow, I'm gonna start with the negative just to get it out of the way. \n*The service: Not very good. The server approached us to take our order after we had been sitting for less than a minute, and then didn't come back for about 15.  (To be fair she probably thought we had been there before, or always ordered the same thing when we went out for Vietnamese food, but was still a little frustrating.)\n*Springrolls: Pretty blah... not much food or flavor packed in there.\n\"So, why the 5 stars?\" you might ask.\nThe pho\nwas\nthat\nAMAZING.\nSeriously.

What I got was a disappointing bowl with flat and bland broth. It wasn't inedible--I did eat the rare beef and well-done brisket, as well as the noodles. But I usually finish off the broth, just not this time. Strangely, the basil and the jalapenos that came with the pho were also bland and tasteless. Where was the flavor in all of this? I only had flavor in my meal because of the Huy Fong sriracha sauce. And no, I'm not a fire-eater who's burned out my palate. Thinking back to the menu, the only beef choices were rare steak, well-done brisket, and meatballs. No tendon, no tripe. It makes me wonder whether the blandness of the broth is caused by the not using all the beef parts.\n\nMaybe this place is more about the garlic noodles and five spice chicken which other Yelpers seem to rave about here. But if you want better pho in the Inner Sunset, go to Yummy Yummy, even if you have to wait in line (although there's never been a line whenever I've gone there, but it is always busy). They have much more satisfying pho there.\n\nService isn't great here. While I do appreciate not being jumped on to have my order taken at the minute I sit down, I didn't need to wait ten minutes in a not-so-busy place for someone to come by. And I had to ask for water--the waiter never asked me if I wanted something to drink.\n\nAs I walked out, I noticed an empty table by the window where two barely eaten bowls of pho sat.

And his effect is contagious, indeed. \n\nUpon walking in, the owner would welcome you as if you were his very own son/daughter -- and that is how I felt like, son/daughter. He makes no distinction between gender, age, nor race. To him, all that enters are hungry, and all will be treated as hungry.\n\nUnlike the standardized conversation of how many restaurants follow, the owner is special in that he not only would ask how your day was, but would push a conversation making you feel that this is an interaction between two human beings, and not just two strangers -- albeit you had just met. He wears a grand smile on his face, and in effect you would have no choice but to be emotionally vulnerable throughout your whole time in the restaurant.

IIt's hard to enjoy your food when you've gone to the back and seen the floor to be wet and kitchen to be dirty... but anyway, got our food, and noodles were garlicky and dryish.. nothing special, had very faint flavors .. couldnt' really figure out though... is it .. vietnamese or ...italian ... ?... It wasn't out of this world or anything, I ate it nevertheless..  They give you ALOT too.I guess that's a plus..  The chicken had a good flavor and the skin was nice and crispy too but still a bit oily for me.  The imperial rolls (and I'm surprised they gave me so much!).. were pretty decent.  Freshly made and fried nicely, meat based with some vermicelli noodles inside.  The imperial rolls were  the best part of the meal.  Decent prices , for 3 of us was about $30.
