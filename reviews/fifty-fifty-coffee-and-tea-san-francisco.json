This morning, I was a little early for work at the hospital, so I decided to stop for coffee before my 10 hour shift. \n\nUpon walking in, the aesthetically pleasing shop felt very welcoming and cozy. I was greeted by friendly staff, and they were quick to help me place my order. I was initially gonna go for a matcha latte, but as I looked over the tea latte list, I noticed more unique flavors such as jasmine, black mint, lavender earl gray, classic black, and honey coconut. I knew I had to try honey coconut because that sounded the most unique. I also have a sweet tooth so I figured something with the name \"honey\" would satisfy my sweet tooth.\n\nI was able to place my order and get my drink within a very short period of time, and was able to make it to work just on time! I didn't get to try my drink until I got to work, but that first sip was AMAZING! The drink was not overly sweet and it wasn't overwhelmingly coconutty. It was the perfect balance of flavors. I'm kinda sad that my drink was diluted since all the ice melted by the time I was actually able to enjoy it. But other than that, the drink was fantastic. I will be back soon!", "author": "Michelle T."}

It wasn't too sweet and the tea flavor really stood out.  In a world where half of all cafes and boba places sell you sugar water, it was a relief finding this gem.  Prices aren't too bad - they're about $4 on average.  Service is good, baristas are friendly, and the drinks are high quality.\n\nMy only complaints are the limited seating if you're coming here to get some work done, and the wifi is on the slower side of things.

No touching. Do your business, then flush by waving your hand at the self flusher. The faucet is motion censored so wave your hands around after you've got them sudsy to rinse. Wave hands adjacent to where you just were and dry them. Walk to the door and wave again, open sesame.\n\nOk where were we? I've had their soy latte (with espresso) as well as the soy latte (tea). The espresso was strong, aromatic, and powerful. The tea was a bit weaker in terms of flavor and came sweetened. For all drinks there is the option of adding boba. The food selection was limited, namely pastries like croissants or donuts.\n\nMore seating would be ideal. There's an area to perch by the window (narrow high table, stools) and a few tables in the back that will sit at most 2 people per table.

You can tell the two owners put a lot of love and care into this place!\n\nMy favorite drinks are the jasmine and matcha iced lattes with boba. Their coffees are usually quite good, but I noticed that they're less strong. I'm not sure why -\u00a0I don't know a lot about coffee, but that doesn't affect my 5 star review because of everything else! Pastries are good too, but I believe they no longer serve Mr. Holmes Bakehouse :-(\n\nI've seen and heard a lot of people complain about the baristas being unfriendly and I honestly feel the opposite!

It was a hot day, and she suggested we stop by and get a drink. I'm so glad she suggested to do so! We went into the cafe, and immediately felt good vibes. The cafe is also very aesthetically pleasing, with white walls and clear menus above the barista working space. Lets talk about service and tea quality:\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE/AMBIANCE: The feeling of the shop is very pristine, with light music playing in the background. The person at the order station was very helpful and friendly. She helped me choose what drink I should get, as it was my first time there. I decided on getting the green tea with mango pur\u00e9e. We came too early to get boba, but I will be definitely getting it next time. I also got an almond croissant to go with it, which was recommended by the barista. My friend and I decided to sit outside, and we found a cute little table with two chairs to plant ourselves at. Not much after that, our drinks were ready! Only about 5 minute wait, which is excellent. My friend and I enjoyed a good conversation, as we enjoyed out drinks and pastries. \n\nTEA/PASTRY QUALITY: I got the Green Tea with Mango Pure\u00e9, and it was delicious! It was extremely fresh, and I loved the taste of the tea that really came through. Flavors were very crisp and the sweetness level was great. Came in a very cute mason jar, so bonus points for presentation. Loved the blend of the fresh pure\u00e9 too. Loved my drink, and loved my croissant even more! Flaky outside, and delicious, sweet fluffy inside. Great recommendations from the staff! 5/5 experience regarding the service and drink/food!\n\nOverall, this is an amazing coffee shop! I will come back to do some school work, since the wifi connection is very strong! Also is close to my campus (USF), which I appreciate! Would recommend this to anyone!

Usually there is a good balance between the bitter and sweet.  The last time I got it, it started off tasting very concentrated, but once you got to the middle where it mixed well with the milk, it was better.\n\nThere are only about 4 total tables so getting a solid study space for yourself will be hit or miss depending on the day of the week and time, and the chairs swivel which is nice.\n\nFifty Fifty also serves donuts from Dynamo Donuts (how awesome that we don't have to travel all the way to the Mission for these delicious pastry creatures.

Trusting her, I gave this place a shot and now it has become one of my favorite coffee spots in the city. \n\nFifty/Fifty has a great staff and seems to be growing their menu options. Their coffee beans are from Ritual Coffee, and they can prepare it in different ways: standard drip, pour over, cold brew, etc. I am a big fan of their milk tea lattes, which can be done hot or cold. Their Match Green Tea Latte is delicious, as is the Jasmine and the Lavender Earl Grey. Tapioca/Boba is available after 12pm, and is the perfect chewy texture. They serve Dynamo Donuts too if you want to pair that tea or coffee with something sweet in the morning. \n\nThe best part: they take credit card, Apple Pay, and Android Pay through Square, which means I never have to worry about bringing cash. They have a great stamp card system too: one free drink after purchasing 10 drinks! It's a great place to grab a drink and chat with someone or get some reading done.

The whole vibe of the store was very hip and modern, a really cute place for a date. They had a  variety of selections, from coffees, tea lattes, and flavored teas. Let's start with the review.\n\nService: The employees were super sweet and nice. I always feel like service also plays a huge part everywhere and anywhere. No matter how good the food or drinks are at location if the service sucks it'll ruin the taste of the food as well. I was served by a the guy with the cool hair who was sweet enough to make me a bear in my tea latte. He helped me choose which drinks I should get and was really helpful, not to mention patient when i asked 100 questions. If you want cute coffee this is the place to be!\n\nDrinks: I got the early grey lavender tea latte and it was one of the best lattes I have ever tried. It was not overly too sweet, really creamy, and rich, just the way tea lattes should be. It tasted just right on a cold day. My boyfriend also got the mango green tea with boba! The boba was cooked well and the tea was really good. I think I also saw some fruit bits in it as well. \n\nOverall my first experience and certainly not my last was a good one.

I go to the Mission or the Sunset for food, but I decided to branch out and see what the Richmond district has to office. I'm a tea lover, a coffee lover and a lover of all things sweet.  \n\nSo first, the food/drinks. I went on a Saturday so they had these Dynamo Donuts (which I had yet to try). These donut was amazing. After reading the reviews I decided to try the tea lattes - both the honey coconut and the lavender earl grey were great as hot drinks. I returned the next day to try the boba everyone was raving about here on Yelp, and I will agree that it's pretty darn good. The lavender earl grey wasn't my favorite as an iced drink though - I'll just try something different. \n\nThey have a public restroom for customers only, which is awesome because it's clean (and we know how a lot of places don't have restrooms in SF so this alone got them to the 5th star in my book). \n\nIt was a little difficult to see from the street and the inside is fairly place and minimalistic, but I assume that is on purpose.

Fifty/Fifty is an awesome spot. They serve Ritual Coffee and have a small but solid list of teas, Asian boba teas, and of course espresso- or coffee- based beverages. I often drop by in the afternoon so I imagine in the morning they have pastries to munch on. They have these delicious \"Awesome Bar\" granola bars for sale. I'm addicted to the salty peanut which resembles a deconstructed and healthier version of a Snickers Bar. Hello peanut, chocolate, oat, and sugar loveliness! I've had their espresso and their iced tea (which, daily, is ginger peach). Both are mighty tasty.\n\nThey have free wifi and a limited number of seating. There are about five or six barstools up front and a few tables for two so be prepared to not sit if you plan on staying put. It's a small space, and I wish it was bigger -- but I guess its coziness is part of the charm. I wish, more than anything, that they were open later. I'm often needing my second cup of coffee or tea just before or after dinner so it'd be great if they stayed open beyond 6 or 7 PM... Like at least til 8 would be wonderful. *cough cough* *hint hint* Nevertheless, I'm thankful for this place! (Oh, and they have a loyalty card so make sure you get stamped each time!)", "author": "James Z."}

They used to have a salted caramel latte a few years ago, but I guess they don't have it anymore. The salted caramel late was really good, and my favorite, so I hope they bring it back. Their matcha latte is also really good with a nice matcha flavor, but I think they need to mix the matcha in a little better because when you get your drink, you can still see a few clumps of matcha inside it.

I ordered a macchiato.  I didn't say, \"espresso macchiato\".  Just \"macchiato.\"  Big mistake.  So the barista launched into the whole bit about \"...double-shot topped with a dollop of milk foam\", yada, yada, yada.  At least the barista knew what a proper macchiato was--AND she knew that kids seem to think \"macchiato\" is some sugary creamy bombastic coffee-Starbucks-monstrosity!  I was a little miffed that the barista thought I was so young to EVEN THINK that; but I guess I should take that as a compliment?  \n\nI don't like coffee in a paper cup--ever.  I hate dessert coffee fraps/slushes in a plastic cup.  Boba-cha (milk-tea) is the exception.  Espresso served in anything but a ceramic cup should be verboten!  Just say [in your best German accent]--\"NIEN!\"  I gave five stars because, not only does Fifty/Fifty serve an exceptional iced matcha (my wife's order); and not only do they have ceramic cups; but they have MACCHIATO cups.  Not coffee, not espresso--but macchiato cups.  Impressive.  Bravo!  \n\nThe espresso was a little mild for my taste, but it wasn't burnt or ground from over roasted beans.  Cool.", "author": "Stephen F."}

I just wish it was a little bigger, for the few times when there were multiple people doing what I was doing - working on computers. Actually, if you see there's a lack of tables and you're a solo person at the tables for two, help a sister out and clear out some of your crap so other people can share a table. How about that?\n\nI'm still giving them a 4-star, even though the caffeine leaves something to be desired. Namely, its catered to the children at USF. And I mean Children. Usually I get the Matcha latte, which is a little sweet but understandable because its matcha. If you don't add a little more sweet to it, it tastes bitter. So...I decided to get their salted caramel latte. DO NOT TOUCH THIS UNLESS YOU WANT DIABETES IN A CUP. Seriously. I was about to bounce off the wall from SUGAR, not caffeine. So for the children out there who want to be grown up and get a coffee, but hate the bitterness of coffee...salted caramel. It's just hot syrup.\n\nThe space itself is pretty small. About 5-6 stools against the front windows, and 3 small 2-person tables along the side wall. The first time I came, there was a pack of about 8 police officers who hung around drinking coffee. Huh. Given the police station is around the corner, that's fair I guess. \n\nThey change their wifi daily, and it tends to be a dessert or ingredient. But the wifi is free, and very strong. If you come when school's out, you basically get the whole place to yourself. If you come when school's in session, good luck finding a seat.", "author": "Lily W."}

He likes Ritual's mocha from their storefronts and this one was no different. If you like sweeter drinks and want to diverge from coffee, the salted caramel tea latte is a good choice! \n\nWe also indulged in one of the Dynamo Donuts they have on the weekends. The maple bacon was really tasty and fresh even at noon. \n\nI had to take one star off for their lack of seating! We had to squeeze into the bar seating when a table was preferred.

Huge fan of this place as it's right next to our friend's place.\n\nThey use real matcha in their latte. It's nice and bitter, but they sweeten it just enough so that it retains a hint of bitterness, and thus, its matcha character. If you find that it is too bitter, then you are not drinking proper matcha, and what you may *actually* enjoy is \"matcha-flavored things\" without the actual characteristic of matcha. There is no shame in this, but do note that this is actually decent proper matcha and I believe they make it well.\n\nThey also have a fantastic lavender earl grey milk latte (it's basically milk tea if you order it cold - after 12pm they have boba, too) which is a must for lavender lovers! I also picked up the hazelnut hot chocolate. It is, basically, like drinking liquefied Nutella, which is exactly as good as it sounds. (No sarcasm.

In order to stay motivated, focused, and positive, I need the right cafe that I can come to every day. Over the past five months I've tried multiple cafe's but they all fall short for one reason or another. Starbucks tend to have stressed out staffs, average drinks, and unreliable Internet. Peets is more quaint and personable then Starbucks, but their locations are never really convenient to me. Other cafes tend to focus too much on their food menus and not enough on their drinks, which is all I look for in a cafe'\n\nFifty/Fifty is perfect in every aforementioned category.

The tea is fresh and perfectly sweeten and the tapioca pearls are perfect! I also ordered the pumpkin muffin with cream cheese frosting and again I was pleasantly surprised.

Been here 3 times, the first time I got a hot matcha green milk tea and my boyfriend got the green tea mango puree. The mango puree is the best tea I have ever tasted (and that includes Mr. Green Bubble). The way that it is made really brings out both the tea and mango flavor. The Matcha green milk tea was pretty good as well but the reason we came back was for the green tea fruit puree. \n\nThe second time we came here we got a green tea peach puree and a green tea pina colada fruit puree. We definitely like the peach one a lot better than the pina colada (which we will not be getting again) but it was still not as good as the mango one. \n\nThe third time we got the mango fruit puree and a cold matcha milk tea. Both were delicious. I personally like the matcha cold better than the hot one but either way their tea is very top grade. \n\nIf you're a boba person like me then go after 12 because thats when they finish making their boba/pearl/tapioca. \n\nDecor-wise, it is very clean and bright. Seating is limited with only 2-3 tables and a small counter looking out the window. \n\nService is average: friendly and nice. And they take credit card which is awesome! \n\nOverall, great place.

Each with 2, 3, and 6 stamps hoping to redeem my free drink -- 10 stamps are supposed to be redeemed for 1 free drink. I'm guessing the stamp cards are intended to reward repeat customers.  The guy that took my order told me that they don't combine stamp cards because they don't want to encourage customers to keep taking more stamp cards. I guess printing those cards really eats into those margins especially when they are charging $4 per drink. I explained that I forget to bring my card in, and that's why I have multiple cards, but I have a total of 11 stamps. Not only did the cashier/barista refuse to redeem my free drink, he offered to combine 2 of my cards just this one time...this doesn't help...I still need to buy a drink and I'm left with 2 stamp cards to keep in my wallet. Anyways, I politely told him that it wouldn't be necessary because I won't be returning to this cafe. I told him I'd still like to purchase a matcha latte today,but I'll be throwing away my stamp cards.\n\nMy opinion: They make great drinks, but their customer service is pretty poor.

Best way to eat poorly while feeling healthy.. \"but it's kale...duh\" \nAny of the donuts and brioche puffs are fantastic!\nSunny & Van are amazing people and have created quite the fan base. I wish that I could reserve a table every Thursday afternoon, but alas, their popularity gain is my loss (of space..it's small)\n\nTry a bing - it's delicious (crepe with hot sauce and sesame and meat and other goodness... just try it)\nAnd the granola, yogurt parfait with fresh berries, is fantastic.

Their fruit teas have more tea flavor and don't taste that artificially sweet and syrupy. They use a house made fruit marmalade in the drinks so there are real fruit chunks in it to add flavor! There's always extra cream/sugar on the side if you want it to taste more sweet. The girl that helped us was very nice and patient with our questions as well.

Remember, always take in moderation. \n\nWhat I liked about their puree drinks is that they don't have high volumes of fruit in the cup, so that you get more juice. I'd suggest the mango and strawberry/banana flavors. It's very refreshing and it's hard to put down after just one sip. The donut muffins are pretty killer too. Very innovative idea which seems to work for me. \n\nThe times I've been there, it's usually manned by one woman. She's fast and even during busy times, she seems to hold it down extremely well.

Which isn't bad, but it's nice to have a change of setting and work in a light, spacious venue. It's very quiet, so it's a great place to get some work done. Nice window seating if you like thinking out the window and watching the cars go by.\n\nAs for the drinks, I've only had their teas--they are pleasantly delicious!

Every time I've come early, they are putting it out and NOT ONCE, did they even offer any of their goods; 2. RUDE, NO PERSONALITY--Again, I thought, okay, maybe they had a bad day but every single time I've come, I've tried to be pleasant and such and NOTHING, no smile, no greeting--NOTHING.

I really wanted to like this place since I live so near by but I think they are trying a little too hard to jump on the hipster industrial coffee joint.  1. Decorate the coffee shop with old industrial pipes and reclaimed wood. Check. 2. Stamp your pure white coffee cups with a cute logo. Check. 3. Charge customers $$$ for mediocre cup of coffee. Check.\nTo their defense, i did not try their tea since that is the other fifty.  Hope this helps.", "author": "Kristina H."}

I've been several times now and I'm a big fan of not only their coffee but also their pastries. Fifty/Fifty gets their pastries from several famous bakeries in the city, one being Devils Teeth which makes the most amazing scones I've ever had. The baristas here make an excellent cup of coffee each time whether it's an Americano or a regular cup of coffee. I've never heard the sad sound of the coffee grinder relentlessness grinding away here. No, they only grind for each cup and customer so the beans taste fresh and never stale.", "author": "Ericka A."}

Anyhow, all I'm trying is the matcha latte with bubbles, its tastes decent, maybe a little more sugar syrup to kick it up a notch. Nice and quiet corner where you could hopefully find a table of the three to nerd away. Would definitely come back if I've got examinations coming up!", "author": "Ann Hui Y."}

They carry Dynamo Donuts which have unique favor combos that really pop. Clean and simple coffeshop that serves products from local businesses, like their coffee is from Ritual, and same with their other pastries and chocolate (just forgot where from). Great friendly service. \n\nTwo Quick Tips: \n1) don't let the address 3157 Geary Blvd fool you...it's a CORNER spot on Geary & Spruce. On the eastbound side of Geary, or in other words, going towards downtown. \n2) try the Hazelnut hot chocolate with an added espresso shot! YUM! I'm trying to get the Owner to call it \"Arianna's Special\". Let's see if it sticks :) PS, their espresso shots are doubles. Enjoy!", "author": "Margaret W."}

We have been wanting to come here for a while and finally we had the opportunity. This place is the cutest little corner coffee shop I have ever seen, being in the outer Richmond district this place brings in a modern take to the neighborhood and its coffee. Before I start experimenting with coffee I always get a latte and a croissant, the traditional, the usual and the always way for me to know if a place has good coffee or bad coffee and or good or bad pastries. The latte I received was more than perfect, it was a perfect balance between milk and coffee, it was velvet smooth and they even topped it off with some foam art. I know you are thinking, this girl is weird she is taking about coffee as if it belongs in a museum of art, however shouldn't it? after all, it is what wakes america up in the morning, and why not know which coffee is good and which is bad.  The coffee here is good, you can make it any flavor you want with respect of course to the flavors they carry in store, you are able to create your own. Their pasties are good, the croissant I had was fluffy and crusty and soft all at the same time. My friend got green macha tea which was served in the old traditional Japanese way, cold and with milk. But it couldn't be more tasty, sweet, and smooth. She very much enjoyed it. Next time we come here we will be experimenting with more flavors and more pastries.", "author": "Svetlana T."}

The menu may not be extensive but they serve all the essentials, latte, machiato,  americano, etc. I also love that they serve Ritual Coffee. Came by after lunch and ordered the pour over drip coffee, jasmine milk tea with boba and a dirty salted caramel milk tea with boba for $10.75. The boba drinks have a strong tea flavor and aren't masked by too much sweetness. The boba are nice and chewy.

Clean, modern atmosphere with good natural light. Owned by a very friendly couple. It's definitely a minimalist's menu, but by paring down the options they've been able to focus on making excellent pour-over coffee and espresso drinks with Ritual beans (which they also sell by the pound!). I haven't tried the milk teas yet, but the flavors look great. Great place to grab a coffee before work (the 38, 38L, and 38BX all stop here) or coffee and donut on the weekend.\n\nGo elsewhere if you're looking for a mediocre coffee and breakfast bagel.", "author": "Anna X."}

The market is saturated.\"  But after having visited it a couple of times, I think that this business has differentiated itself from the competition.  They have artisanal beverages such as single cup hand-pour with high-quality beans, gourmet loose teas, milk teas, and tea smoothies.  I especially liked the moroccan mint loose tea pot.  Also in contrast to most of the local cafes that are old, dingy and decrepit, everything at fifty/fifty is new.  The space has a clean modern look.  Even the coffee making appliances and the china are design-conscious.  They have obviously put some thought into their menu and are offering the neighborhood something different.", "author": "Robert B."}
