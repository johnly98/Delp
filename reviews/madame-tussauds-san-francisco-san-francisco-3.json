Yes where there's tourist areas like Fisherman's Wharf, Hollywood Boulevard or 42nd Street these wax museums are there.  The thing is I don't find these things cheesy at all in fact I find them quite fun.\n\nI haven't been to Madame Tussaud's since LA and that was quite a few years back.  Of course between that time there's more exhibits and newer ones that make their way around the various museums I can only assume.  The San Fran version has some that you'd find to be more native to the area being that it's the bay area.  For instance at the entrance they have Mr. Facebook himself Mark Zuckerburg and you also have some locals like Harvey Milk or Steve Jobs as well.  Steve McQueen and Bullitt are all San Francisco as well.\n\nWhile the walk up price for an adult is 20 dollars, checking in with Yelp at the time gave you 5 dollars off but it's too bad I didn't notice until after I had paid.  There's various props at some of the exhibits such as if you wanted to pose with Jimi Hendrix and have a guitar or wear a NY Yankees cap beside Babe Ruth.  \n\nI was alone so I couldn't really take photos of myself with the exhibits at least ones that wouldn't be selfie distance.  There's enough exhibits for it to be worth the while, especially if you're with somebody and you have the time to take photos.  If the place is busier of course you may have to wait to take shots of the exhibits alone but being alone also gave me the chance to take all the photos I wanted without having to wait for others to be done.  \n\nThere are a few of the exhibits where the faces didn't really look as close to the real individuals as they could be.  Jennifer Aniston and Kate Winslet looked a bit off while Tiger Woods, Peter Dinklage and Leonardo DiCaprio looked really well done.  \n\nFrom my last visit in LA I learned that taking photos from their line sight (as if they're looking into the camera) make it appear more lifelike.  Sometimes the lighting will give off too much reflection because well the figures will appear \"shiny\".  Taylor Swifts legs were shiny as was Al Capone's forehead.  There's also moving light indoors for some so maybe you'll have to time your shots of Tupac when the blue spotlight is not on him.\n\nOverall I liked the experience and it was fun even though I was just in for a short time but I stopped at each exhibit.", "author": "Lambert P."}

It's called, \"Madame Tussauds.\" Yes this is the Madame Tussauds that we known of for creating well known celebrities into wax figurines! I've remember coming to Madame Tussauds in Las Vegas not too long ago back in 2015, and this is my 2nd visit at a different location! The atmosphere and the concept remain the same as most Madame Tussauds across the world, and for this SF location, it's pretty compact and spacious inside filled with various of wax figures across the whole room.\n\nThe employees here are doing a great job for making the customers like me a remarkable and entertaining service! No cons!\n\nEvery aisle at this museum is very well kept and tidy, so I can explore tons of figures in each walkway categories no matter where I go. Some of the wax figures are very accurate to see like Elvis Presley, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Robin Williams, Steve Jobs, Stephen Curry, Joe Montana, Audrey Hepburn etc. They looked real, but it looked fantastic to say \"hi\" or making a fun poses and selfies! I kinda confused about the Beyonce wax figurine in my opinion due to the looks on her face although for me, it doesn't matter cause it looked just fine. Additionally, I really enjoyed reading celebrity facts on the wall especially for taking authentic photographs provided by the clone photographer near the Oval office and creating your own wax hands. Overall, it's a fun experience!\n\nParking at Madame Tussauds in San Francisco can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface metered street parking nor the parking garage nor lot if it's available. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, Madame Tussauds is the finest well known wax museum that I've ever revisited and experienced right here in San Francisco after coming to their Las Vegas location back in 2015! Perfect for all ages from young to old! A well visit! My rating: 4 solid stars.", "author": "William L."}

If there wasn't a name plate we wouldn't have known who they were. It was a nice 15 minute walk through.

I've never been to any other location of Madame Tussauds, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this one houses some of the best!  \n\nYou'll find Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly, Stephen Curry, San Francisco's beloved Robin Williams, and even Chicago's (pride and joy) Al Capone...not to mention several other iconic figures.  I simply names a few of my favorites.  You could look at every single one nose-to-nose and still be fooled into thinking it's the real deal!

I don't think I've been to a place where I just laughed the whole time. It's kinda creepy at times though. It's as if the wax model had moved or it just felt like they were real. If you visit here, make sure you bring a funny person who will imitate and pose like the statues. It's much smaller than the ones I've visited in London and New York.\n\nThe wax museum and the Dungeons are free if you're an annual Merlin Pass members. In our case we have a Legoland annual pass. \n\nThe place is categorized into different zones namely; music, leaders and entrepreneurs, sports, spirit of SF, film, and A-list zones. There was a section where they can take a wax mold of your hand. I think it's $20 for two with coupon. The coupon is at the back of your tix. We didn't do this but we watched how it was done. There was a small viewing area with limited seats and a small tV where one can see the story of Madame Tussaud. It's kinda creepy.\n\nMy sister, son and niece all had fun. The kids had fun posing and playing some of the interactive stuff. We had concert at the Music Zone with Madonna, Rihanna, Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga to name a few. The kids had fun playing the drums and the piano.\n\nWe hobnob with famous people at Leaders and Entrepreneurs zone with the likes of Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Barack Obama, Mark Zuckerberg, Rosa Parks and of course Abraham Lincoln. My son learned about the Proclamation signing and had a speech with Martin Luther King. How much of that he retained? I don't know. But he had fun sitting at the oval office giving orders to the Clone troopers :-).\n\nWe played almost all the famous sports at the Sports Zone and got to meet Joe Montana and Serena Williams. Played golf with Tiger Woods and get to shoot hoops with Stephen Curry.\n\nThen we took a walk at the Spirit of SF zone by the Golden Gate Bridge and met up with the Mayor of SF, Edwin Lee. We sang with Tony Bennett on Lombard St and was serenaded by Santana and danced to the tune of Maria Maria.\n\nWe had a meeting of the minds with Alfred Hitchcock, John Travolta, ET, Steven Spielberg and my idol Audrey Hepburn. And my dream to have Breakfast at Tiffany's with Audrey Hepburn came to fruition while my sister was dancing with John Travolta.\n\nAnd finally we got to the A-list zone and rubbed shoulders with George Clooney, Laverne Cox, Anne Hathaway, our local Zendaya, Jennifer Aniston and the Emmy Award Winning Actor Peter Dinklage.\n\nIt was a lot of fun and totally worth visiting.

We have many times talked about going to this wax museum and finally decided to go there as we had received tickets from an event venue.  So we went there and had pretty much a good time.  There was many chances for a photo op.   My favorite experience was playing the electronic guitar with a wax figure of Jimmie Hendrix.  That was fun.  The wax figures are very realistic.  Although I have to say that the Bill Gates and Elvis Presley figures do not look at all like them.  \n\nCool that in the gift shop you can buy Grammy and Oscar trophies, and have them autographed.  Heard that during the recent Oscars, a man stole a trophy and took a short video of himself kissing it.  The trophy eventually was returned and the guy was caught.  Gee, maybe he should have considered going to one of these wax museums and bought a novelty trophies instead.  LOL!!!\n\nBasically, it was kind of fun, a little engaging, and very strange experience.  I guess it may be the closest I ever will get to meeting these famous people, especially those that are deceased- Janis Joplin, Michael Jackson, Steve Jobs among others.  But still that kind of feeling of standing near a wax figure of someone that you admire, that kind of feeling is strange....gee...at least it was not like the classic Vincent Price Movie- Waxworks where the wax figures are actually corpses.  LOL!!!  But still, I personally like Ripley's Believe or Not Museum that is nearby more.  \n\nIt took my boyfriend and I about an hour to go through this museum.  Afterwards, I found out that adult general admission is about $30!  WOW!  I would never pay that much admission to see just a bunch of wax figures.  I would rather pay $30 to go to a party where I may meet actual local celebrities instead!\n\nPros:\n-this place has a fascinating history\n-many wax figures look like the actual people\n-esp. enjoyed the interactive exhibits\n-is a successful franchise\n-located conveniently on Fisherman's Wharf\n-lots of photo ops here! \n-you can buy a novelty Oscar or Grammy trophy here!\n-good!

I rated this place 3 stars, having paid the Groupon price of $13.50 per person for admission. Groupon is currently running a deal where instead of paying $19.99 (online saver price) or $27 (walk up price). If I had to pay the full price, I would definitely have rated this place lower than 3 stars. \n\nLe bf was dragged by me to Madame Tussauds on a Saturday morning around 10:15am. The first thing I noticed was that the music was extremely loud where you stand in line to purchase your ticket. I think the music was meant to go out into the street, but it didn't, and it made it hard to hear the lady at the ticket counter. \n\nOnce we presented our Groupon, we were told to go to the 3rd floor, using the slowest elevator known to man. It was large, but the signs specified that only 6 people should go in at a time. The actual museum is split in a few different areas: sports, music, movies, spirit of SF, leaders & entrepreneurs, and a-listers. You start on the 3rd floor and work your way down to the 2nd floor. Then you take the elevator down 1 floor to reach the gift shop.\n\nWhen we went, there weren't very many people so if we wanted to take pictures with the wax figures, it was extremely easy. Some of the wax figures we saw: Beyonce, Adele, and Stephen Curry. When we left, I guess a tour group came, so there was a long time of people trying to use the elevators to get up to the 3rd floor. I suggest coming here on the earlier end, especially if you come on a weekend. It is a tourist attraction after all. \n\nOverall, I think that you need to get the Groupon to make it more worth it. I don't think I would go without the deal. There weren't as many wax figures as I thought there would be. It was definitely a quick walk through. Le bf and I took just a few pictures and read all the signs (he likes to read everything) and we were done in about an hour. You can definitely take less time in there, if you wanted.

To make matters worse I wasted an hour and a half trying to find the place and get parking for nothing! I could have went to my favorite cd store (that closed when I got there) that had the cd I couldn't find because it's an import than spend hours on NOT CELEBRITIES. Madame Tussands needs to add more REAL celebrities (not people like Kim Kardashian, Instagram people nor you tubers because they are not real famous people!) instead making people drive all the way Los Angeles. It just felt like much of nothing and it was a bummer there wasn't more to see. I heard they had Taylor Swift as a wax figure. Don't really care about that I saw  her in person don't need a wax figure plus she's way too tall and not very nice/acts like she's in high school even though were close in age. To sum this all up, don't bother going there because they don't really have anything special, just save money and go to LA or one of their better locations.", "author": "Brittany T."}

It's too much excitement to take in all at once!\n\nThe wax figures all look so real. Especially the beard on some of the figures like Peter Dinklage. Up close, it looked so real it's crazy. Plus they let me touch the figures, which actually felt kind of real and pretty neat. It's hard to describe the feeling unless you're there.\n\nI liked the singer room the most. Being surrounded by standing figures of Rihanna, Beyonce, Madonna, Selena Gomez, Jennifer Aniston, and Adele at the same time felt surreal. You can see the life-size height, the body, the facial expression. It's as close to meeting them as I will ever get in this life time :) Ever harder to get all of them in the same room.\n\n2Pac was there too. I thought he was dead!\n\nI knew Obama is really tall. Did you know Steve Jobs is actually a bit taller? I did not know that. Christian Bale is really tall in real life too--it was hard to tell since he is also quite buff in the Batman movies.\n\nThe exhibit was also very much San-Francisco-themed, with some areas decorated after Lombard Street, Golden Gate, and Cafe Zoetrope where they made the Godfather. Great for bringing friends from out-of-town, especially when passing by Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nOverall, a really GREAT place to visit. Definitely have to check out this place.

It's probably as close as I can get to the real star. This location in San Francisco opened in June 2014 so it's fairly new? Our visit here wasn't planned, it was a spur of the moment idea and the cheapest rate we could find was through the Madame Tussaud's website and purchased the tickets online at $19.75 + fees/adult ($16 if you live within the 9 local Bay Area counties).\n\nThis location had less wax figures compared to the other Madame Tussaud's I've visited in the past (London UK and Las Vegas NV), but still I enjoyed visiting each figure and reading their little captions and their stories. San Francisco had figures that is part of San Francisco's history -- Al Capone (imprisoned in Alcatraz), Harvey Milk (gay rights activist), Janis Joplin (who lived down Haight, Ashbury area of San Francisco}, Robin Williams who lived in Tiburon, Francis Ford Coppola (film maker and owns two prominent wineries in Northern CA), Edwin Lee (first Asian-American Mayor in SF's history), Joseph Strauss (chief engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge and it wouldn't be complete if there were no wax figure representing the California Gold Rush, enter John Sutter. \n\nThe wax displays were in sections-- movie celebrities, music artists, sports figures and historical figures (presidents and activists, etc).  So as I walked along and checked out each wax display I became co-director with Steven Spielberg, I flew E.T. home, I played ball with NBA's Stephan Curry (#30 Golden State Warriors), I sat next to George Clooney, I hitchhiked with Robin Williams along Lombard Street, I caught up with Christian Bale before he starts fighting crime in Gotham City, I took a mug shot near Al Capone's prison cell, had tea with Audrey Hepburn at Tiffany's, made an Uma Thurman dance move with John Travolta (Pulp Fiction), walked along the London streets with the Fab Four \"Beatles\", and sat on the bench with the Comeback Kid #16 (guess?).  These were just a few of the wax figure displays here in the San Francisco location.\n\nThere were props available for fun photo ops and you can show off your selfie in Instagram, Facebook and Twitter at #MTSFselfie.  This made for a fun afternoon. Hope they add more celebrity figures in the future. Funny how the museum had a wax of Selena Gomez and not Justin Beiber... just saying.\n\nReview #0480", "author": "May A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-19", "description": "Half the fun of visiting Madame Tussaud's is not knowing which wax characters you'll next encounter so my goal here is not to spoil things for you.  Instead, my goal is to tell you something you might not otherwise know.:\n\n1.  Many area libraries offer free museum tickets.  Did you know that those free tickets may also be offered for admission to Madame Tussaud's?  I was inspired to go solely because of the free pass offered by the Marin County Library system.  A woman in line in front of me was there with her free pass from the Alameda County library system.  The free passes are good for one adult and one child.  This is a great deal.  \n\n2.  You're going to want photos of yourself with the wax characters.  Really.  Madame Tussaud's makes this almost irresistible.  Their set-up is arranged to allow you to put yourself into iconic movie scenes, to become part of a political march, and the like.  There's even footprints on the ground in certain places to show you exactly where to stand.  So plan to take photos and if you're coming here solo, now's the time to invest in a selfie stick.\n\n3.  Madame Tussaud's didn't need to make the San Francisco version of their \"museum\" reflect San Francisco in any way, shape, or form.  That they did positively tickled me.  It would be a sad little wax museum if all they featured were San Francisco landmarks and San Francisco swells; they do a good job of balancing the SF-centric with images of people you care more about seeing.  \n\n4.  Some of these likenesses are better than others.  Some, of complete unknowns, I could appreciate for their realism alone.  As I stood 2 inches from the face of a couple of wax images I broke into laughter, so certain was I that the figure was about to break character and come alive.  When they're good, they're really good.  \n\n6.  It's time they retire a few figures and replace them with more relevant celebrities.  Get into the section featuring sports luminaries and tell me you don't agree.  \n\n5.  On-line tickets are available for $16 (advance purchase by Bay Area locals) to $22 (advance on-line purchase by non-locals).  I thought Madame Tussaud's was a fun, mindless activity but must admit that if I paid any more than $5 to get in my assessment of the experience would've lessened significantly.  Free tickets though?  You'll have fun.  \n\nThere's one million things I would suggest tourists in San Francisco do before heading into Madame Tussaud's but if you get free tickets it actually makes for a great excuse to play tourist for the day.", "author": "Tracey A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-12-31", "description": "Madame Tussauds in San Francisco is great for families. \n\nThankfully, I received free passes to go and I was happy to check it out. It's been open for about 6 months in Fisherman's Wharf; previously, there was an independent wax museum located here. I had never been to that one, but I have been to original Madame Tussauds in London.\n\nThe SF one is much much smaller. I took plenty of pictures, and I still think it only takes an hour to see it all. You could easily get out of there in 30 minutes or less though, if you didn't want to pose for pictures. \n\nThe first floor has a couple of figures you can check out for free including, at the time, Michael Phelps, Johnny Depp, and Morgan Freeman, but I'm sure they move them around. \n\nOnce paid, you head back to the elevator and you'll pass San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee, surprisingly. Then you'll head up to the top floor where you'll work your way down. There's two floors of figures. \n\nOddly, when you exit from the elevator, they immediately try to tell you that you've been upgraded to a VIP package and slap a wristband on you, which is all prepping you for a sales pitch at the end. Along your visit, a photographer will snap pictures of you with figures, so they can try to sell you a package at the end. I didn't care for this and the sleazy tactic of trying to pitch it to you like you were specially selected for an upgrade was ridiculous. I would have liked to have been left alone to explore the figures as I liked, not coerced into forced photos that I wasn't going to buy. By the way, the photo packages start at $35 I think. Yea...I don't think so...especially when admission is quite costly as well. \n\nAnyway, the figures are divided into sections like SF icons, musicians, politicians, historical icons, and Hollywood figures. \n\nIt was pretty cool how they had some very SF figures like Janis Joplin posed in a '60s setting with a hippie VW bus complete with a campfire and tent. This was more than just a figure; it was a complete scene from history. \n\nThere was also scenes from Haight Street and the Golden Gate Bridge. There's also props like guitars, drum sets, umbrellas, etc to use at some of the figures, so you can take some more interesting photos. \n\nThe Alfred Hitchcock figure was pretty cool because they had the shower set up from Psycho and you can step behind the shower curtain and use the knife and reenact the scene. There's special effects lighting and music too. The immersive, interactive displays were pretty fun. \n\nOverall, I think the museum is a bit too small and too pricey. The one is London is much better. However, I liked that they tried to put an SF twist to the museum. If you can find some coupons, or get a price you'd be happy with, then I think it's worthwhile to go. It's pretty cool to see the dimensions and proportions of famous people. Also, if you look at the Yelp photos on here, you can see a lot of people aren't shy about copping a feel! Grab that hottie's wax booty or feel up the biseps of Obama!

We have complained to customer service but had only promises, and no pictures.  Expensive, and not what was advertised.  Very disappointing.  I had wanted to use the picture of our whole group for a Christmas greeting and now it is too late, and we still have no pictures and don't know if we will ever have them.

I use to work at the Madame Tussauds in Hollywood and I visited the MT in New York City, Las Vegas and now San Francisco. Each attraction is different and caters to the city that they're in. Different photo ops, different rooms and props, they're all different but cohesive in a way that its true to who they are as an attraction in the city.\n\nSan Francisco was definitely worth it and I enjoyed myself. Its a bit tiny but take advantage and take every photo you can with each figure. They had a Castro area where they had Harvey Milk just relaxing, when you first enter, you enter a sort of maze but it ended up being Lombard street (super cute). The workers there are fun and they always have a good time.\n\nWe came in a lucky day because there was a Figure revealing!!! Which was reallly exciting because while working in the one in Hollywood they always had a figure revealing as a private event as suppose to a public event. Who did they reveal you ask? SAM SMITH. The man himself was there which was funny and cute. \n\nDefinitely take a lot of pictures of each of the figures there because they're amazing to look at since its life size and their exact measurements, definitely my favorite would be Laverne Cox she is queen.\n\nOne con about is that Magic Memories (Their photo department) can improve in their camera... Some pictures came out not as I expected because it looked really cheap... But I wanted to buy it anyways because it'll be a great souviner when I visit most of the Madame Tussuad's and their signiture signs and stuff. Ex; Vegas has the \"Welcome to Vegas\" Hollywood has the \"Hollywood\" sign, and New York has King Kong on the Empire State Building!!\n\nDefinitely a 5 star worthy place!!!

The Hollywood one seems like they got cooler stuff, like more super heroes and star figures. i heard they rotate a few figures around, but it felt like there wasn't much here... \n\nThis was the first time I've been to a wax museum... I mean seeing a wax figure for the first time is pretty crazy... They really are so life-like, it's just freaky as hell... Morgan Freeman blew me away. lol it feels like it would come alive and move... I know actual celebrities have done pranks before where they actually pretend to be the figures and scare some visitors.... that's definitely a price of admission!!  \n\nAt this day and age with selfies, this is a perfect goldmine photo op place for those things... I liked how they weren't strict and let you really take pictures freely. But there is one room where one of the staff will bug the hell of you to take photos for you with their camera... I can tell she was bored as hell and desperate to do her job... lol I'm sorry, but no thank you!! \n\nI went on a really dead day, so I guess the staff wasn't expecting seeing much people and they totally freaked out seeing me... LOL Do I look that scary??? Well, they told me it's weird seeing people moving when they're used to only seeing bunch of still wax figures around... I know that feeling, as I also felt a little freaked out too when I walked into a room and someone was moving -- after being used to the presence of the figures.\n\nSo the San Francisco Madame Tussauds has the mayor figure and people relating to the city at the start. \n\nSome of the figures are really well done and look like the real person... others, not so much. Obama needs work. lol There's also Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg nearby. \n\nAlfred Hitchcock has the psycho shower and I think there's a sensor or randomly it screams and lights turn red... that was pretty cool.  \n\nI like that you can put on the props too like wear the jacket and everything and pose with E.T. \n\nThe Bruce Lee one is really cool where you can stand as if he's about to kick your face. lol I like that one. That one definitely makes a fun photo opportunity. \n\nI don't care for One Direction... it should be Backstreet Boys or N'Sync. lol \n\nSome of the athletes, I don't understand... Why do we get Jeremy Lin with Lakers??!?! I want Michael Jordan!! lol \n\nIf Beyonce's wax figure is like WHOAAAAA when you first see her... she must blow people away in real life... lol \n\nThey put the good ones outside to attract people to come in... I mean, they got Leonardo DiCaprio standing right outside already... you can take photos with him without paying/going inside... Leo is taller than I thought! \n\nI parked in the public parking lot and I ended up having to pay like $20... ugh. They don't validate here\n\nIt can be fun, especially if it's your first time seeing the wax figures and depending on who you go with... but I don't think it's really worth the price... it's a short experience. The Hollywood one seems superior, but it's probably way busier.", "author": "Kiyo M."}

The whole place is set up really neat too so it is really fun to walk through. I would probably go again!\n\nThe one thing I HATED was that when you get to the end, they have pictures of you that you took at the beginning. The thing is that they have already printed your pictures and put them in little books to sell you for a ridiculous amount of money (I think one picture was maybe $10 or $25 for 4 or $45 for the book). It makes you feel very pressured to buy them because they have already been printed. I thought it was just very scammy and wasteful! I admire that many places in San Francisco are pushing to be more green and create less trash. They really shouldn't have the picture printed like that when most people don't buy them.

I walked there from the embarcadero, and as I arrived inside their doors, I took a look around. In the somewhat small lobby, there was an unorganized blob of people.  They were enjoying the figures of Johnny Depp, Morgan Freeman and Zombie-Boris-Karloff, who greeted me silently.\n     There was an employee attempting to  wrangle the blob of people, and two girls behind the counter slinging tickets. The people-blob was discussing things amongst itself, giving me the impression that they were related. So I carefully squeezed around them, approached the counter, and talked to a girl about buying a ticket to enter the museum. Girl tried to upsell me on some stuff, but I politely declined and held onto my money.\n    After acquiring a ticket for myself, (Only $21 using a coupon from the Bay City Guide) girl behind the counter gave me an additional ticket. Complimentary entrance into the place right next door, the San Francisco Dungeon. The caveat of the free ticket was that it only good until 4pm that day.  I took note of the time, that gave me about an hour or so to enjoy THIS place before having to get over there to enjoy THAT place. Probably noticing my worried look of 'am I gonna make it', Girl behind the counter assured me that I'd make it in time. I smiled, nodded, and then walked past the counter and towards an elevator to see the wax figures.\n    The Hollywood location has a similar set up as this location. You take an elevator up all the way to the top of the building, and then you stroll back down through the facsimiles of famous people.  Actors, sports celebrities, historical figures and prominent San Franciscoites were displayed.  I very much enjoyed the historical bit. That was very cool. Seeing the guy who designed the golden gate bridge, and long dead presidents in their element was a good educational touch.\n     This place has costume-bits and props for people to dress up and appear in the scene along with their favorite famous wax people. That was cool. You could photograph yourself golfing with Tiger Woods, having a rap battle with Tupac, sharing the oval office from Barak Obama, in the shower behind Alfred Hitchcock, or even eating breakfast with Audrey Hepburn....at Tiffany's. I don't remember the props being there in Hollywood. But it was a neat 'hands on immersive' touch.\n    I meandered my way down the few floors through the actors, historical figures, sports celebrities and performers well within my hour window.  I took just about as many pictures as I wanted to take, and was not rushed in the least. Afterwards, I walked out their front door, and into the building next door, which housed the San Francisco Dungeon.\n\n    While the Hollywood location of Madame Tussards was a good size larger, with more wax people in it, this was still pretty fun.

And the wax figures are much better quality than the ones from about 5 years ago.\n\nHonestly what made the experience more enjoyable was the employee Ami, this review is a little late forgive me! But she was really compassionate and understanding to mine and my sisters circumstances. We came down for the day to do the San Francisco Dungeon, when we arrived (slightly buzzed) it was closed! We were so bummed that we made the trip all the way down there and our plans were completely destroyed in a second. I decided to see if it was possible to talk to someone at Madame Tussauds (since hey are affiliated) and see if we could upgrade so we could at least do the wax museum and come back another day for the dungeon. Anyways, Ami totally hooked us up and was totally sweet and understanding, which made me really, really appreciate giving her my business.\n\nI would definitely suggest this for something fun to do if you have no plans, it's dorky but whatever!", "author": "Kelly A."}

They are pretty cool and so real looking, especially whoopi goldbergs looks dead on real. I loved it. My only downfall which is why I knocked off a star (really I give 4.5 but I can't take half a star) is because the photos at the end.

Before you were only allowed to look at them and you couldn't even take pictures. Now they all have their own settings with props to take pictures with.\nWhat I didn't like about my experience is first of all the customer service. I don't know if the staff was just cranky since its 4th of July weekend/the elevator not working, but oh man they were rude to me. Second of all they took out a lot of the old wax figures that used to have. I think they need to add more of a variety in there and more current stars.\nI also think some wax figures don't even look like the stars. For example the wax Laverne Cox and Beyonc\u00e9 don't look like the real ones. Lastly the prices are way too high and they got rid of the resident/student discount. I wouldn't come here again due to it not being that great.", "author": "Sharon G."}

So, with some happy expectations I ventured into the new Madame Tussaud's that replaced the old San Francisco Wax Museum.  I was impressed with the wax works.  Some of them were downright creepy in their realism.  I was a little disappointed at the number of waxworks though.  It seemed like that old museum had a lot more on display.  The new museum does have a lot of nice new interactive displays.  I wish they had kept some of the older waxworks around.  Robin Williams is a San Francisco icon that deserves a spot.  It also would've been nice to see some of the scientists and historical figures that the old museum had.  Overall it is a good time.

Hopefully over time they will make some great editions, and can live up to the Madam Tussauds museum I am accustomed to. The Wax museum did not have a scary section either...  My mom and I actually ended up walking through the museum backwards once we finished, because we were certain we must have missed a hall or something, but sadly we were wrong, the tour was just a lot smaller than any of the Madam Tussauds either one of us have previously visited  (NYC, LA and VEGAS).\nOn a positive note I appreciated that the SF attraction incorporated a lot SF culture- Silicon Tech magnates, as well as other well known bay area natives like Robin Williams, and of course Harvey Milk, and Hitchcock. \n\nIn short I would have rather seen more A listers and less BillyJean Kings, whoopi goldbergs and Michael Phelps.( I included Michael Michael Phelps,because I actually witnessed him at a gold tournament being a poor sport, and denying little kids autographs just because he was temporarily sucking at life).\n\n\n* PS I Would love to see tom Hanks and  James Franco here in the near future.\n\n\n\nOh & the Beatles section is missing the members.\n\nNo local discount given...", "author": "Ang G."}

It replaced the San Francisco Wax Museum and thank goodness it did... those wax figures looked fake as hell! I've been to the Madame Tussauds in Las Vegas yeaaaaars ago and I remember I had tons of fun.\n\nThe elevators to get in take forever!! -- we probably waited 5 minutes. But once you get in, you're in. Goodness... it's crazy how realistic these figures are. Plenty of times I would scare myself because I would think that from a first glance the wax figure was a real person when in all reality, it was just a wax figure. It was neat of them to start the museum off with San Francisco historic figures such as Ed Lee. Probably did learn some great things about the city. What is also fun is that they have plenty of props just laying around so there's plenty of photo ops! You also get to touch the wax figures as much as you like ;) You talk through the museum and all the wax figures are in different sceneries, based on categories. To name a few, there were San Francisco historical figures, Hollywood actors/actresses (Audrey Hepburn, Jennifer Aniston), famous celebrities, pop stars (Lady Gaga), artists (Madonna, The Beatles), American historic figures (Abe Lincoln, Obama, Rosa Parks, etc.), and more...\n\nOverall, I had fun and the wax figures were super darn realistic. However, I must complain that it was super toasty in there and I started sweating. Probably from all the lighting? Or maybe I was getting nervous from being in the presence of such famous celebrities like Beyonce, Rihanna, Leonardo Da Vinci, etc.? \n\nQuestion is if I would recommend to others to drop $21 for admission -- maybe if the museum was slightly larger.

My kids loved the lady gaga cause it had drums that they can play on.  I loved Michael Jackson too!!!  Oh of course Leonardo too!!!  The only thing we didn't care for was the staff taking the pictures by certain figures and then forcing us to buy them. That's my only complain. Great place and great wax figures!", "author": "Tina R."}

The wax figures have such immense detail and look so much like the actual celebrity it is unbelievable. It is really great that the figures are not behind glass or anything and you are allowed to touch them and take as many pictures as you want with them. The elevator going from floor to floor is quite large but they only allow six people at a time on it. At first we ought they were joking but it later seemed they were not.", "author": "Matt P."}

There are a wide variety of wax figures and even though it's a bit cheesy, you do find yourself taking selfies with them!  in some cases, t's as close as you are going to get to meeting the real people.  there are political figures, tech figures, athletes, movie stars from a variety of eras/decades, music stars, and more.  Also nice backdrops of the city in some of the displays.  i would definitely bring visiting friends here as part of the Fisherman's wharf experience.", "author": "Bebe W."}

I don't know how much the regular tickets are, but we paid $10 per person as an upgrade from the San Francisco Dungeon tickets, so for that price it was reasonable. One of the things I do like in these museums is seeing the local flavour, so San Francisco includes some notable people who are part of the history here (like Harvey Milk, Alfred Hitchcock, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, and one of the famous Alcatraz prisoners). I loved the E.T. figure in the bicycle, which was adorable for taking photos of my kids with, and as someone with a filmmaking background, I couldn't help getting a picture with the wax Steven Spielberg. The room with musicians/singers is a bit small, so it can be a bit harder to get pictures with some of them without another one in the background. Same with some of the actors. They have a decent range of personalities so you may not have heard of them all, but are probably likely to find at least one you're a fan of. Apart from Hitchcock, Spielberg, and E.T., my favourites included Audrey Hepburn from a Breakfast at Tiffany's scene, Whoopi Goldberg, Martin Luther King Jnr, Adele, Laverne Cox, Morgan Freeman, and Neil Patrick Harris. The Nicolas Cage figure is hilarious because his eyes look so dead/emotionless.", "author": "Dominica M."}

Most museums have the \"do not touch\" rule but as humans, we're a curious bunch.  What I especially liked the most was the fact that they provided props for the guests to use for pictures.  They even had photo stations where the museum would take professional pictures for you to purchase at the end of the tour.  For example, you can take pictures with the President, MJ, and etc... I really enjoyed my time at this museum and wished they had more!!", "author": "Ashley C."}

Going out, they showed us our pictures and we decided to buy it ($32.63)  together with the album. We were given the code.  As soon as we got home, check the website and input the code provided us.  Unfortunately, it gave the message \"code can not be found\"! I tried the following day again and again, next day again and again, no luck!  We feel CHEATED!!!  I sent them message today and hopefully will hear from them.  Not recommending to anybody.  :( I am going to dispute the charges in my card, if I don't hear from them thru this weekend.

The wax figures are truly well-done and life-like.  Each theme in the attraction was well-thought out.  \n\nOne can tell how much effort and time is invested in each of the celebrity figures.  Guests are welcome to touch and take pictures which completes the experience.  Naturally there is expected wear and tear on a daily basis - incredibly each figure looks fresh and ready to entertain everyday!\n\nThanks so much for coming to San Francisco Madame Tussauds!!!", "author": "Chris D."}

This wax museum is totally interactive, you can stand up next to the figures and pose with them, even touch them.  \n\nThe figures themselves are extremely life-like and not a little bit creepy.  But the posing for pictures part is great fun, some of the things people were doing were pretty funny to see.\n\nIt is well worth a visit, but it's very small.  Smaller than it should be.  They could probably lose the statue of Mayor Lee and Joseph Strauss and a couple others who no one would miss.  \n\nGo very slowly, and enjoy each figure as much as possible, because the place ends before you realize.  It should be about twice as big as it currently is. \n\nAs long as you understand this, it's really fun, though.  Got a ton of pictures.", "author": "Jon N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-09", "description": "This place is so much better than the old wax museum. They removed the ropes and let you now get right up next to them for pictures. They could include tv's next to the figures showing their best moments while they were alive/at their best. For example some of Michael Jackson, lady gaga, and Rihanna music videos, footage of muhammad ali's fights, babe Ruth hitting home runs, etc. Also they used to have movie scenes like the wizard of oz characters skipping down the yellow brick road, Jack and rose of titanic on the bow of the ship, all with background music from the actual movies. Would have been nice to see some movie scenes, but we did love how it's interactive now so you can pose with them in various scenes! All in all a COMPLETE upgrade but still could engage the audience a little more.", "author": "Megan V."}

It was fun to interact, touch, and take pictures with the wax people! The entertainment was awesome! The dungeon section next store was also very fun. It wasn't too scary, more entertaining if anything however, I wouldn't recommend it for kids under 13. The only reason why I give this place a four stars instead of 5 is because the workers there are too pushy with sales. They almost wouldn't take no for an answer with buying pictures and souvenirs. It was very uncomfortable when they wouldn't let u give them back the pictures they took of you, or put items in your face and tell you, you have to buy it. If someone doesn't want to buy something or can't afford it then they shouldn't be so pushy. Other wise this place is great!", "author": "Rachel W."}

It has changed dramatically and now has such life like wax figures that I thought several of them would get up and walk around.  The workmanship was superb and so was the lay out of the Museum itself.  They also had opportunities for group pictures with certain displays as well as interactive booths for the kids.  You can also bring your camera and take your own pictures.  They have costumes you can use and you are allowed to gently touch the figures.  Sometimes you had to because they looked so real.  We all had a wonderful time and we felt it is one of the best things we have visited in SF.  I highly recommend you visit but I suggest you go in the morning so it isn't crowded.  It is great entertainment for the whole family at a reasonable price.", "author": "Pat L."}
