{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-10-16", "description": "\"Best Pizza in San Francisco\"?  Definitely deserves that title! \nCame here on a Saturday evening around 8:30- had to wait in line for 15 min before we were able to be seated.\n\nVenue: this neighborhood joint is quite on the small side; we were lucky to have a table in the window nook so that we don't feel too claustrophobic.  Most tables seat 4 at most but mostly r better for 2-3.  There are only 4 tables inside, 4 counter seats by the kitchen, and 4 tables outside (they have overhead heaters if it's cold outside), so do expect to wait for a table (NB: some days they do take-out and these hold up well).  That being said, the restaurant still has a neighborhood, cozy feel to it so that the tight space isn't unpleasant.  \n\nService: probably some of the charm of this place comes from the friendly staff.  They all realize that the place is popular / crowded and so take extra care to make sure service is excellent.  They try to be efficient with everything without making you feel too rushed.  Ask them for recommendations!\n\nFood: I don't eat much in general, but one pizza is enough to make me feel satisfyingly full (maybe towards full full).  Probably recommend taking into account topping types if ordering multiple pizzas.  Overall, one of the best crusts I've tasted in general, almost comparable to what I would find in Italy- thin but puffy and not too doughy.  Not greasy / oily either; from the pizzas we've eaten so far (including take out), most of what we got have been clean tasting.  \n-- Farm Egg, Sweet Corn, Chipotle Creme Fraiche, Chive, Cherry Tomato ($17.50) - surprisingly light given the egg!  The corn was a nice touch of sweetness to offset the chipotle creme fraiche, which essentially serves as the cheese.  Be prepared to get your hands messy with this one, especially since the egg is still runny when it comes out.\n\n-- Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Basil w/ White Anchovy ($15.50) - highly recommend anchovies on this pizza!  Even without it, the pizza is very clean tasting; you can taste all ingredients in the pizza and appreciate a simple pizza done right.  \n\nHighly recommend if you are looking for good, thin-crust pizza- it's worth the trek out here!", "author": "Audrey H."}

Service is so good that you don't even mind the wait.  He makes you feel comfortable and taken care of while you wait.  I was impressed because I haven't seen that kind of service in a while, probably never. At least at a pizza joint.  \n\nPizzettas are all great.  We got the classic San Marzano tomato sauce, mascarpone, and wild arugula.  We also ordered the farm egg, pork chile verde, red onion, cotija, with cilantro crema.  It was hard to choose the pizzeta became they all sounded and looked so good.\n\n\nFor dessert, flourless chocolate cake of course.  I wish they were closer to where we live.  Really good pizza.

You can think you're walking through a plain ol' neighborhood and all of a sudden stumble across a piece of magic. Pizzetta 211, you're that celestial unicorn.\n\nMy order:\n\nWarm Mixed Olives - I eat a lot of olives and I do order them quite a bit, but this particular sampler was simply beautiful. When I saw that single Red Bella di Cerignola olive delicately placed within this small dish, I was really pleased. \n\nSalad of the Day - Baby kale tossed in a light vinaigrette with thin shaved Parmesan, beets, and toasted Pepita seeds. Every single kale leaf was perfectly dressed and all the ingredients, although seemingly simple, brought so much intention to this starter. \n\nFarm Egg Pizzetta - This thin pizzetta had such contrast in flavors and textures that it was very pleasant to eat. I'm not sure how they do it, but they've completely mastered the outer and inner crust; soft yet still a little stiff in order to hold up against the toppings without it being the slight bit soggy. Crisped to perfection! As for the toppings, it came with thinly sliced steamed/baked potatoes which brought in some heartiness. The Parmesan cheese gave enough of a sharpness to cut through the potatoes and crust; all the while being sprinkled with pieces of chopped bacon, lending some saltiness and smokiness. To add another layer of complexity to this beautiful culinary dish, what better to go with bacon than two sunny side up eggs? The yokes were still runny, silky, and light, greatly enhancing the wonderful mix of juxtaposed textures.\n\nWhen I came across this teeny restaurant in the middle of Richmond District, I didn't expect it to be this good. I mean, real good. In fact, I never even knew it was here! True definition of what you call a hidden gem. The chefs certainly have a deft hand with focused execution. \n\nUnicorn indeed.

It is such a tiny place,,,so for us visiting on a off day time was crucial. From what I can tell and totally believe it is a long wait on peak hours. I think there are about 15 seats inside and half as much outside. Very intimate and personal touch from the owners. I am on a very restricted plant based diet and it was accommodated with ease. High high high marks for this. I ordered the melon arugula basil salad to start and a espresso and my friend ordered a lemonatta....the salad was Devine. Small but absolutely scrumptious. \nEach of us ordered our own pizza. Mine a all veggie with arugula on top,,,this was by far the best, delicate, flavorful, balanced, pizza I have ever eaten. My husband had a cheese pizza with sopressa and friend had the margarita. Wow.. totally exceeded pizza we have ever had. Mind you this was thin, delicate pizza.  So do not expect to walk away stuffed. I only ate half of mine as well as the others,,,but most people could probably eat the entire one.

It was actually difficult to find as it was a very unassuming pizza place that blended in with the adjacent apartments and houses. I was surprised by how quiet it was when we got our table and even the waiter mentioned how strangely slow it was for that time of day. The restaurant is quite small and the I can't imagine the four small tables seating any more than 10 people. \n\nAs cozy and small this place is, their menu is kept simple. There are a few pizzas that are stay on the menu and a few that rotate bi-weekly. We just so happened to visit on the last day of a rotation and thought to try some of the specials. The first was essentially a breakfast-inspired pizza topped with coppa meat, potatoes, goat cheese, arugula pesto and two farm eggs. The lack of a sauce made sure the salume, egg, and potato really came through along with the goat cheese, which was mild. The other pizza we tried was the house made pork sausage, roasted tomato sauce, red onion, caper oil. This second pie was a standard sausage, but I really loved the fresh mozzarella and the red sauce was wonderful.  \n\nI loved the crust, dough, and everything about these pies. The thin-crust pizzas are roughly 10 inches, but one is just enough for one person. The prices are in line with any quick-bake pie places, but the ingredients here are far superior.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

Even the amount of pepperoni was right. \n\nGood thing we added the apple galette to our pick up because it was delicious! Thin crust and crunchy pizza without being floppy. You know what I'm talking about. I don't think it's a regular item on the menu, so if they are offering it when you go, get it! \n\nThe restaurant is small with not many other options nearby. Truly a locals spot. There are 2 small tables outside with maaaybe 3-4 inside. It's small. Totally worth checking out if you are in the area and in the mood for good pizza.", "author": "Jaylena P."}

I'm a bit biased as I have been using the sauce and dough recipe that was featured in sunset magazine for like 10 years. Was in town with no dinner plans so decided to give it a shot. Adorable little storefront with no sign-- the crowd outside clues you in that something fabulous is happening inside though. The wait was surprisingly short and they will bring you wine and blankets while you wait. Loved sitting at the bar with a view of our food in process. We left about 9:30 just as they were closing and they were still full. \n\nBoth pizzas were great as was the soup of the day (like seriously one of the best bowls of soup I've ever had!). The berry tart was in the basic french country style but it was amazing-- perfect crust and perfect crust:berry ratio. \n\nGo!\n\nOh, re: prices. Yep. You're gonna pay $15-20/individaul sized pie.

The menu was super short and changes so often to keep things fresh and new with cooking things that are available. \n\nOnce we were seated by our friendly waiter, we waited even more for the pizza to be freshly made. We ordered the farm egg pizza with pork carnitas, guac, and grilled corn and a basiz pizza of tomato, mozzarella, basil.  By the time it came, we were so hungry that we ate those pizzas in like 0.2 seconds. I wish I could have eaten slower to savor it and remember how it tasted, but NOPE all that comes to mind are the vague memories of HOT. CHEESY. YUM. BYE.

I loved it to bits. It was at the top of my SF list. And I even would go as far as saying this was the best pizza I had had outside of Europe. I would go out of my way to bring friends and recommend it to them.  \n\nBut then sometime in the last few months they appear to have changed the crust recipe dramatically, reduced the size of the pies, and gotten less refined in their ingredient choices. Seems like a totally different set of people might be behind it. The first time we got these different pizzas we thought it was a fluke. But now two more tries later over the course of 6 weeks we can confirm the best pizza on the west coast appears to be gone for good.\n\nIn fairness, the pizzas there now are still a passable meal. You will think \"oh, this is somewhere between fine and yum,\" especially if you hadn't had the former stuff. But if you were going there because someone told you it was amazing, or remember it being amazing yourself, be forewarned things have changed.\n\nTo Pizzetta: if you change things back I'll happily recant and resume sending all my friends your way.", "author": "Adam A."}

Cost is average ~$18 (after tax) for your personal baked pizza. To be honest, I don't eat a whole lot but when I'm pretty hungry I can finish all but one piece of their pizza. If you are a hungry boy or girl that usually eat a lot I recommend ordering more than one pizza.\n\nI tried their pizza with the ham in it and I didn't like it nearly as much as the Tomato, Mozzarella, Basil 12.50 with Pepperoni for $15.50. If you want to opt out of certain ingredients they are flexible too.\n\nThey are thin crusted and I LOVED the crunch. It's like eating toasted bread with the toppings that slid off of the slice that you just picked up. They don't overdo it with cheese and I love that!

Unfortunately, the waiter kind of ruined our experience, and given how expensive the food is, I doubt we'll be coming back. :/\n\nWe went on a Sunday around 6pm, just before the dinner rush. (I think we were second in line? Definitely not that busy.) It was our first visit, so we looked around for someone to talk to. We said hello to the man in the apron. He stared at us like we were crazy. \"Can I help you?\" he said coolly. I told him we'd like to eat (I mean, obviously, right?). He told us we'd need to wait. No big deal, we said.\n\nHe sat us at a table a few minutes later (not a clean one, though - not sure why, but he didn't wipe it off or set utensils before seating us). I told him we were ready to order, but we had a few questions. We asked how big the pizzettas were and what the appetizer of the day was. He sighed and curtly replied, \"One pizzetta can feed one hungry person.\" No recommendations (again, this was our first visit). Okay, my friend said, we'll get two. When we flipped to the back of the menu to order some wine, he snapped, \"Oh, you're 'READY' to order, huh?\" (Wtf?)\n\nHe came back with our wine, and, eventually, our appetizer. I got the impression he was in a really bad mood. He asked us if we wanted an extra plate so we could split the appetizer, and when my friend said no, he rolled his eyes (!!!). I think he eventually realized he was out of line, because our busser ended up taking care of us for the rest of the meal.\n\nThankfully, the busser was awesome. He was so polite when bringing out our pizzettas, explaining what the ingredients were, wiping our table off for us, offering us more wine, etc. He was also the one who brought us our check. We did tip 20%, but I don't think it was an $80 well spent. I'm sure I'll get crucified for saying this, but it wasn't the best pizza I've had in my life. It wasn't *bad*, but it wasn't something I'd pick over Georgio's or Gaspare's. (It's also possible I was just turned off by the waiter.)\n\nOh well, I'm still glad we tried it.

The crust was thin and crunchy. The pizza overall was very well made and would probably order it again.\n\nHowever the prices were up there and overall the price for a daily appetizer + pizza + tip came out to around $34 that still left me hungry.", "author": "Eric L."}

Luckily things haven't changed much there and it's far proximity may ensure things stay the same. The menu is updated weekly. One pizza per person seems the norm and probably the best way to avoid fights-- sharing only one may be tough here. We tried their unique farm egg, corn, shishito peppers, truffle pecorino cheese with roasted garlic panna. Though I am a firm believer all pizza must come with some sort of tomato, I did give this one a try because it sounded so damn good. It was. Our other pizza came with the classic San Marzano tomato sauce, mascarpone cheese and arugula. It was perfect: thin crust with a slight crisp and just the right amount of toppings. I could probably live on this. We added a little bit of chili oil just to spice things up a bit. For desert we scored their take on the classic panna cotta. This one had a slight, slight sour taste reminiscent of yoghurt and tastes a bit healthier than than a sibling version you may find in North Beach. The secret ingredient turned out to be buttermilk instead of heavy cream. Can't wait to venture here again-- worth the wait, just have a glass of pinot or some tea if it's cold out, which is a 50/50.", "author": "Brian J."}

This is cool so that there's variety, but sad because they were so good; I would have loved to go back and order them again. Kind of pricey, but they use very creative ingredients like purple potatoes, Brussel sprouts, and a variety of cheeses. The crust is thin and each pizza is personal-sized. We ordered one pizza per person and shared. We did try one of the regular pizzas with rosemary and pine nuts--very yummy. \n\nService: \nThis varied depending on who we dealt with. One man was not very friendly, basically telling us to wait outside almost as soon as we walked in, but we had ordered to-go and needed to pay. Meanwhile, another man was calling one of us over to pay so it was very confusing. \n\nThey told us our pizza would be ready 20 minutes after we called and even gave us a specific time. We arrived 10 minutes later than that time, and the pizzas still weren't ready. After waiting outside in the very chilly evening during winter, someone came out to tell us that one of our pizzas didn't make it onto the ticket so they were just starting it then. \n\nEventually, a nice woman came out to ask if we drove because if so, we could wait in the car and double park to wait, then she'd bring our pizzas to the car. That was so nice of her. \n\nAmbiance: \nSuper tiny restaurant. They had about 5 tables. Each table would comfortably fit 2 people, but some had 4 huddled around it. So if you're not comfortable with a tight eating situation, opt to get it as takeout. Granted, the weather was really, really cold that night so the three heated tables they had outside still weren't usable. If those could be used it would alleviate the cramped conditions a bit, but not by much. So if you have more than 3-4 people and don't want to eat outside, be prepared to wait.", "author": "Susan G."}

I decided to try out Pizzetta 211 on a whim while in the Richmond District. The restaurant is quite small and may fit no more than maybe 15 people at a given time. It's a bit concealed and sandwiched between residences in the Richmond, so I thought that was kind of a cool aspect of this place.\n\nFood: \nI ordered 2 pizzas, (shared between 2 people)\n\nFarm Egg, Fingerling Potato, Chard, Bacon             17.50\n\nTomato, Mozzarella, Basil 12.50 with Pepperoni        15.50\n\nThe pizzas are definitely on the smaller side, so if you're into hearty, heavy pizza this restaurant will not be ideal for you. I finished an entire pizza by myself, so yeah it was more like a personal pizza for me (keep in mind that I am indeed a light eater). I really did enjoy their regular pepperoni pizza, but I'm not sure it was extraordinary. I was so hungry by the time we got our food that I did devour it quite quickly. \n\nService:\nThere is an outrageous wait. Because the restaurant is so tiny, be prepared to wait 1+ hours, especially during dinner time. We arrived at 6pm on a Saturday night and didn't get seated until around 7:15pm. Yeah, pretty crazy wait. So if you want to get seated right away maybe try avoiding the dinner rush; though, this place is so popular I bet there's always a wait. I think if I had been starving I would've been incredibly annoyed at the wait and probably left. An hour is quite a wait. \n\nThere was only one girl waitressing and she did a great job at multitasking; she seated people, brought their food, took orders, signed people on the wait list...she did it all. She seemed a bit overwhelmed at times though making it easy for her to forget about people waiting for tables.\n\nAtmosphere:\nQuaint, cozy, charming. Again, it's not very spacious inside, meaning you'll almost be elbow to elbow with the table next to you. Not sure if that's my jam, but whatevs. Overall it's got a nice 'hole in the wall' kinda ambience. I'm not sure I'd be back due to the wait and the pretty good, but not incredible pizza.", "author": "Stefany Z."}

The cheese plate was amazing and of course the pizza is bomb, but I was personally floored by the gloriousness of their olive oil cake: light but rich, super moist with a delicious touch of crunch in the deep dark toast of the exterior. Also their teeny tiny bathroom is the cutest thing I have ever seen, with a little tv installed with scenes of Italy playing on loop along with ambient music, positioned over the toilet so those using it standing up, I assume, can watch (I felt a little jealous of men in this moment.) sort of wanted to just hang out in the bathroom as a result, hah.

Found the restaurant after finishing a hike down to Baker's beach and needing to refuel with some pizza.  The restaurant is super tiny-- they could probably fit a party of max 9 people and would have only 2 more indoor tables left. If you come outside of peak hours, you're more likely to avoid a wait/ get a table. \n\nThe pizzas are made on a nice thin crispy crust-- you could probably finish a whole one if you were pretty hungry. Otherwise, they can be shared with 2 people. We tried the eggplant pizza and the carnitas pizza that comes with two farm eggs, dollops of guac, and corn. It was my first time getting in on the eggs on pizza hype and I dig it. It's so satisfying to cut into a sunny side up egg and watch that yolk ooze on to your pizza. I love eggs and I love pizza and the two together are fantastic. This pizza had a unique combination of toppings which I really enjoyed and would recommend trying this one.\n\nThe eggplant pizza was good as well and had a bit of a curried flavor to it-- good option if you are vegetarian. The large chunks of creamy burrata went perfectly with the eggplant.\n\n Both of these pizzas are on their rotating menu so I'm glad we got to try them. I had to knock a star off because the place is just so tiny. The dining experience isn't the best as you have to keep getting up and moving your chair to let other patrons move around. If you can get take out, I'd recommend doing that. I also though the price was a bit steep for the size of the pizza and the amount of toppings ($16-$17.50), but hey you gotta treat yourself sometimes!\n\nDefinitely worth checking it out if you're in the hood.", "author": "Renu A."}

Yes please! Farm egg too? Give it to me! Finally in August 2013, the roommate agreed to try Pizzetta 211. We got take out.\n\n*San marzano tomato sauce, mascarpone, wild arugula, olio verde ($14.95)\nI love pies with arugula on top so I couldn't resist ordering this. The crust was nice and thin. The sauce showcased the sweetness of the tomatoes and contrasted the mascarpone well. A great simple pizza!\n\n*Farm egg, bacon, early girl tomato, collard green, gruyere ($15.95)\nAnother thing I can't resist?! Topping a pizza with egg! The egg added a nice creaminess to the bacon, greens and gruyere cheese. And the slight sweetness and acidity from the tomato cut into the richness well. Yum!\n\nI had a hard time deciding what I wanted to order when looking through all the pizzas. I really wanted to order like 3 or 4 different ones, but I restrained myself.

And hour went by and some people left the bar, so we thought we would be next, but then 3 'new' people arrived and the server/host told them the bar was available, SO THEY WALKED RIGHT IN AND SAT DOWN.\n\nWe were pissed. Here we are thinking the bar was part of the seating since it was so small and waiting patiently for them to seat us, but they never asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar!

We got a plain cheese pizza and the bacon potato pizza. The crust is perfectly done. The entire product was very tasty.\n\nA little warning, the pizzas are not very big and it's relatively expensive, $15-$20 per pizza. We had to eat again later that night because we were hungry.\n\nAnother warning is that the seating is very limited and you won't want to get there with your full party or you cannot be seated.\n\nThe service was very good.

Each pizza is artfully crafted so that every slice contains the exact right amount of every ingredient to ensure that each bite contains the perfect combination of flavors. The crust is thin and holds up nicely to the ingredients on top, but has just a little doughy chew and is flavorful and satisfying in its own right. I am not a dessert person and I rarely like restaurant desserts. This place is the exception- we always order dessert - the specials are seasonal (always accompanied by fresh cream whipped by hand) and the constants (flourless chocolate cake, etc.) are also delicious.\n\nGo.

Since I've never been, when we met up to catch up over lunch, we decided to come here. The place is located in a residential area so it's really easy to miss, especially since it's hidden behind a tree. It's a small restaurant so there's only a few tables inside and a few more outside. They even have chairs for you to sit while you wait if there's no table. Around the tree, there's a wooden bench plus blankets. I'm not sure, but I think it's so you can have a picnic in the middle of the sidewalk. \n\nI can picture it. Glass of wine and pizza on a picnic blanket under the tree.\n\nWe decided on pizzas that were on a biweekly rotation. After all, we could always come back for the pizzas that were always on the menu. Once the biweekly pizzas are gone, you never know when they'll be back. \n\nWe shared two pizzas: the The Farm Egg with ham, braised endive, gruyere, and mustard pizza and the Butternut Squash with bacon, chipotle creme fraiche, and pepitas. \n\nThe Farm Egg with ham, braised endive, gruyere, and mustard was pretty good. I loved that there were two eggs, one for me and one for my friend. The eggs weren't overcook, it was still a little runny in the middle so it was perfect. It's slightly bigger than a personal pizza so one person can finish the pizza. Although for me, one pizza was a little too much. I thought it was pretty good. The pizza was definitely one of the most unique ones I've had. But I thought it was a little too salty. I'm not sure what it was, but it could have been the mustard. There were some seeds under the cheese and I think that was what made it a bit salty.\n\nI absolutely loved the butternut squash with bacon, chipotle creme fraiche, and pepitas. It has to be one of my favorites. I have never had butternut squash before so I wasn't sure what to expect, but now, I want it in all my pizzas. The squash was creamy and sweet. The bacon was slightly salty. I felt that this pizza had it all. It played with my taste buds in a good way. And I really hope that the next time I come, that this pizza will be on the menu.\n\nThe service was very good too. Our server was very attentive. She made sure that we had everything that we need. She made sure that our jug of water was filled. \n\nI definitely recommend coming here for pizza. The ingredients are fresh. The pizza has ingredients that made me feel like I'm eating healthy. I mean, one of the pizzas even had brussels sprouts. The pizzas are a little pricy. About $12-16 for one. But I think it's completely worth it because the pizzas themselves are unique. \n\nGo try the pizzas during lunch if you can because it's less crowded during lunch. And bring a friend or two.

If they had turned us away, I would have totally understood, but they were super gracious and we were there until 10pm (they close at 9pm). \n\nThey didn't rush us, in fact, they told us to relax and enjoy, because that's clearly what they were doing as well. \n\nWe ordered:\nFarm Egg, Tunisian Pepper Sauce, Spanish Chorizo (on half), Ricotta Salata , Cilantro. \n-- really good. the runny yolk + pepper sauce played off each other super well. \nQuattro Formaggi, Slow Roasted Tomatoes, Garlic, Oregano\n-- also delicious. The slow roasted tomatoes resembled softer version of sun dried tomatoes and added a wonderful flavor and texture. \n\nThe pies are definitely meant for a single hungry adult. The crust is super thin and super crispy. \nThe toppings are somewhat light, but also very considered. \n \nAnd, as if they hadn't already been super sweet to us, they brought us a couple of desserts for the table, on the house.

I'm talking about the BEST damn pizza in SF: Pizzetta 211's. Consistency is key and my most recent visit in April was just as good as I remembered it 7 years ago during my pre-yelp era. They definitely trump Delfina, Flour + Water, Zero Zero, and even the 11 time world pizza champion Tony Gemignani of Tony's Pizza Napoletana (lacks consistency). \n\nThe size of celebrity walk-in closet, Pizzetta 211 seats just 12-14 people. However, what they lack in size they make up in flavor. Not only do they have your standard margherita pizza, they have creative flavor combinations that will tantalize your taste buds. With a small, seasonal menu that changes weekly, there's a salad, a cheese salad, 6-7 pizzas thin crust pizzas, a calzone and 2 desserts on the menu. CASH ONLY. \n\nUnless you like waiting and circling tiredly for parking, come when Pizzetta 211 opens so you can be seated immediately. If not, be prepared to wait as they don't take reservations.\n\nWe started out with the Soup of the Day: White Bean & Kale Soup ($6) which was chockfull of tender beans and topped with shaving of cheese; very hearty and comforting: http://bit.ly/10A1FOm. The Cheese Board Salad ($8) had a duo of a hard and soft cheese served alongside toast points: http://bit.ly/11yD5yN. It was nothing special so I wouldn't waste stomach space on this next time.\n\nFor the grand premiere, came the two pizzas we ordered: Rosemary & Pine Nut Pizza ($12.25) and Sausage, Red Potatoes & Farm Egg Pizza ($15.75). Surprisingly, 7x7 didn't lead us astray this time. A must order, the Rosemary & Pine Nut Pizza was uniquely delicious: http://bit.ly/13YMjUl. The aromatic rosemary, salty cheese and sweet richness of the pine nuts on a flavorful crunchy crust was insanely good. If you're a sucker for gluttony, then you'll love the Sausage, Red Potatoes & Farm Egg Pizza: http://bit.ly/146zp3l. This pizza was generously topped with rich sausage crumbles, thin slices of potatoes and TWO eggs for your poking pleasure. Take a slice and poke into one of the eggs and use the yolk as a dipping sauce. Pure artery-clogging bliss!\n\nService could be friendlier though. I did sense a bit of a Marina-Mission Yipster attitude from the staff so I don't doubt all the negative reviews.

Since it looked like a pretty cool spot, I suggested we check them out one night...and was quickly denied (\"they suck\" she said).  Long story short - we stopped dating soon after that.  Now, I'm not saying the two are related, but clearly she was wrong (in multiple ways) because Pizzetta 211 is GREAT!\n\nAfter failing on my first few attempts to come here, I finally got the chance when my friend and I found a parking space nearby, and a very short wait outside.  It's was like fate was telling us to go!  Given their physical limitations, almost everything about the place is small - from the dining room (seats about 20 total, inside and out), to the menu, to the pizzas (hence \"pizzetta\").  What's not small though, are all of the delicious flavors!\n\n- Cheese Board - Bleu di Lazio and Humboldt Fog Goat Cheese...A.Q.\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pizzetta-211-san-francisco?select=Ie9E1R3d4Dma5sp4ws0CJA#_jbudhXH8DWimik0uE7Riw)\nListed on their daily specials board, both were good...though neither really blew my mind.  While I'm not a huge fan of goat cheeses, the Humboldt Fog stood out more than the Bleu di Lazio (the latter tasted almost like any other bleu cheese).\n\n- Farm Egg, Fennel Salame, Roasted Tomato Sauce, Parsley-Caper Oil, and Caciocavallo Pizzetta...$15.50\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pizzetta-211-san-francisco?select=Ie9E1R3d4Dma5sp4ws0CJA#l7ADUdynofh9hjLQqXS9KA)\nWithout the egg, the pizza was pretty good.  It's fairly simple, but I really liked the fennel salame and the caciocavallo (so different than just mozzarella).  With the farm egg though?  BONKERS.  Who knew an egg could make a pizza go from good, to awesome!\n\n- Chard, French Fingerling Potato, Garlic Confit, and Gruyere Pizzetta...$14.50\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pizzetta-211-san-francisco?select=Ie9E1R3d4Dma5sp4ws0CJA#H6T8Qj48ae6D8hvcPZQ57g)\nIf not for the Farm Egg Pizza, I would have said this is the one to get.  Sure, there wasn't any meat, and the chard was a little different, but it was great!  The chard and potatoes gave it a nice, earthy taste, and you can never go wrong with garlic and gruyere! \n\nAlthough I enjoyed the food quite a bit, I wasn't 100% on rounding up from FOUR AND A HALF STARS.  However, they're definitely better than a four, and the service got them the rest (very friendly, and they offered us drinks while we waited).

Score!). We started off sitting outside saying we'd move in once a table opened up, and when it did the server stuck his head out and beckoned us inside. \n- We stayed well past their 9pm closing, but the staff were sitting down together to their own dinner and let us hang out for quite a while. They still got up so we could order dessert, to get our bill, etc.\n- Speaking of dessert, when we couldn't decide between the butterscotch and the rhubarb tart and were leaning towards the latter, he said he'd give us the tart for free if we ordered the butterscotch.\n- You feel like you're just hanging out at a good friend's house.

So be prepared for a wait if coming on a busy weekend night. Coming in a group of five or more will be a struggle as well. Their tables seat groups of 2-4. \n\nThey have daily starters and desserts (it changes daily), so I can't promise that the soup and apple crisp will be on the menu.", "author": "Justina L."}

With the high reviews and so many, I was excited to come here and have a nice pizza. I've lived in NYC, LA and St. Louis. I know good pizza.\nI went with my friend and split a pizza. We had no idea how small the pizza would be...around 9 inches and expensive--$16. I thought it would've been bigger for the price.\nWe got the one with the homemade sausage. Where was the sausage? I would've had to get out a magnifying glass to find it. There was hardly any on there! A couple tiny crumbles on each slice. I felt cheated.\nThe description was a bit off...I didn't realize it wasn't going to be tomato based. Perhaps the menu should be organized differently. The entire pizza was covered with the white cheese, which once it cooled slightly (the pizza didn't even come out piping hot...I usually burn my mouth) became stiff. It overwhelmed the crust. The chili oil wasn't spicy at all. The lemon over the broccolini stood out a lot. The lack of sausage just made it taste...meh...\n\n\nI should have said something to the waiter about how I thought this was unacceptable. It's really disappointing to go out to eat and have a lackluster, expensive meal and then come home and eat some more food and write a bad yelp review.", "author": "Stella H."}

With that said, I am also critical of the kinds of pizza I eat. For me, a top notch pizza has to be thin crust- this place fulfills that requirement. \n\nI also make a note of their hand picked toppings- it's really important that they pair well together. My friend and I ordered two separate pizzas: a margarita pizza with white anchovies and egg, along with a homemade sausage with broccoli pizza. I would have loved the sausage and broccoli pizza a lot more if it didn't have this orange lemony sauce on it. For me, it was too overpowering, which made the pizza taste really sour. I love adding lemon juice to meals for that extra zing, but this sauce was over the top. As for the margarita pizza, it was an \"eh\" for me. I didn't care much for the egg, but I did like the anchovy add on. It made the pizza less bland in my opinion with that nice bit of saltiness. \n\nThe pizzeria is also VERY small. The table next to us had to move over a bit, so that we could squeeze into this tiny table in the corner. I am not saying that I wouldn't come back, but as far as pizza goes, I've had better.

With a crispier and thinner crust, they're not as soggy or puffy blister crusted as the Neapolitans and (obv) not floppy NY style either. They aren't really cracker thin either so I can't really compare their pizzas with any other pizzas I know of. \n\nNote it is pretty cozy inside and got crowded quickly so we were glad to have arrived when we did. There were about 4 tables inside, some bar seating with two tables outside tables below heat lamps.

We were starving, craving pizza, and chose this place based on it's astronomical yelp status.  A couple things of note: yes, as mentioned in almost every other review, this place is teeny tiny.  We were lucky to get there when we did and snag a table.  Still though, the tables are small and you're so close to the table next to you, it makes getting up awkward.  \n\nOk, now the reason for my 3-star rating: they brought our food to the wrong table. Ok, let me explain, normally this wouldn't upset me so much, but this restaurant is a TINY room with only 4 or 5 tables- how do you mix up the tables?? Worse, they gave our order to a couple who came in, sat down, and ordered probably 15 minutes after us.  Again, the restaurant is super small, so we were keen on the fact that a table who had come in much later than us was eating before us, which is annoying in it's own right, and that they were eating what we had ordered.  Then the waiter came up to us and said, \"Sorry, there's been a mixup, we brought your food to the wrong table. We're starting your pizzas now.\" Ugh.  So we wait another 15 minutes, starving (see above), watching a couple graze the pizzas we ordered.\n\nOk so the pizzas themselves get 5/5 stars.  Yes, amazing, delicious, mouth watering, unique pizza comparable to those in Italy.  They are small though, and I would say, over-priced.\n\nTake away: Amazing pizza, though small portioned and over-priced. Sub-standard service. We will probably be back, but not dying to anytime soon.  And we definitely wouldn't come during prime-time dining hours when it's sure to be busy.", "author": "Cierra B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-08", "description": "Pizzetta is the most poetic little restaurant in San Francisco.  I love everything about it.  I love the location, for one.  Located on 23rd Avenue off of California St., Pizzetta is nestled in a cozy little space with a tree shading it's single door entrance and 2 front windows.  The vibe is residential, laid back, local, easy going.  As for the space itself, the square footprint and modest dimensions would certainly qualify it for a \"hole in the wall\" eatery.  If this is true, then what is also true is that little restaurants can offer expansively sublime experiences.  Perfect simplicity is the secret.\n\nPoetic it is, with everything proportional to the allotted space.  Four table in all, plus a small counter space.  My guess is 15 persons total inside.  There are small tables on the sidewalk for an additional 8 individuals.  You will get to know your fellow diners, if you wish.  You'll definitely see their faces and hear their conversations.  Note that babies are allowed at Pizzetta.  I saw a couple eating with their kid inside, and liked it.  One must keep in mind the family oriented Richmond district.\n\nEverything seems in its place at Pizzetta.  Order and cleanliness is essential for obvious reasons.  In such close quarters, clutter would quickly be noticed.  No one enjoys dining amid chaos.  Appearance does influence appetite, I believe.  And to me, there is something both beautiful and fine about Pizzetta's visual appeal.   Pizzetta can be seen in it's fullness in one 3 second gaze when you first step through the door.  Maybe the subconscious appeal of small eateries lies is this fact.  Nothing is hidden, the space is not intimidating but down to earth.  You feel you can easily handle it and feel at home there.  That's the beauty of Pizzetta's first impression - you have the feeling of walking into a good friend's kitchen for an unhurried dinner.  \n\nThis feeling carries over into the care applied to food preparation here.  Since only a handful of people can eat at Pizzetta, plates are just about made to order.  I saw only one cook behind the counter, and one server.  That's really all that is needed.  The menu is simple and concentrated, with several thin crust pizzas, an appetizer of the day, a choice of 2 or 3 salads, cheese board, olives, a handful of desserts.  I asked for the appetizer and a sausage/egg/kale/garlic confit pizza.  \n\nThe appetizer blew my mind!  Cauliflower puree, roasted brussel sprouts, shiitake mushrooms, crushed almonds, brown butter croutons.  It was so delicious, the best thing I've put in my mouth in some time.  I'm still thinking about how lush that dish was, and crave a return trip to have it again.  The pizza was also delicious, with sharply flavored sausage, nicely fried eggs, kale.  Very rich, and the crust nicely crisped and thin. I am excited to try their salad and dessert next time, yes indeed, perhaps in the evening so that wine can be enjoyed.  Try Pizzetta.  Perhaps you too will fall in love!", "author": "Roland C."}

The clientele there is always fun and interesting - actually that's not quite true since there seems to be at least one bozo there when I am there.  But most of them are fun and interesting.  On a nice evening it is enjoyable to sit outside at a table.  When it is cooler you can sit inside and watch the crowd out front.\n\nThe place is rather small.  So sometimes the wait is pretty long.  They try to do a good job at managing the flow and keeping people moving.  And they have 4 seats at the counter that aren't as comfortable, so those turn over a little more quickly.\n\nIt was at one of those seats where I dined alone the other day.  I had spent the day on the Presidio at the wine bunkers and then taking some shots along the coast.  Being by myself made it easier to grab a spot at the counter where I was soon joined by a couple that seemed to be on a date.  BTW, If you want privacy, don't sit at the counter - the other people there hear every word, the staff is right in front of you, and all the people coming in to order and pick up come right up behind you.  I was perfectly fine, but the male in the couple that sat next to me seemed to have an issue with it.\n\nThen again he had a lot of issues.  He dropped out of school because he didn't think the education was worth the effort. I liked one of his comments in particular \"you know I went to Berkeley for 2 years.  I was accepted into Stanford too but just couldn't see spending that kind of money.  And when they raised my fees at Cal, I just didn't see the ROI of staying there.\" Huh?  This was followed up shortly with \"An MBA is just not worth it.  All that time and money, for what?  I have more important things to do with my time.\"  You do?  Like what?  Maybe finish your first college degree at one of the best universities in the country?  She was eating it up.  Oh well, young love.\n\nAnyway, Pizzetta - it's a love hate relationship.

In fact, I would recommend all pizza places to try adding a mascarpone topping\n- asparagus + mustard greens seasonal starter: loved the grinded bread-crumb crunchy topping, nice mix of salad flavors and perfectly cooked giant white beans. I'm not sure if they always offer this style of starter, but it was delicious.\n\nOK:\n- farm egg with braised beef and kale: I love each of these ingredients on their own, but they just didn't come quite together for me on a pizza.

I loved the ingredients and the size was perfect given the thickness. However, the dough is similar to those rolls/buns they serve chicken sandwiches on (You know the kind for burgers from the grocery store? With the yellow speck-sized crumbs ... err is that cornmeal?... covering the top half of the bun?). It's not the puffy dough style pizza that I like - not chewy at all. And it's not like plain white crusty bread at Beretta because it seemed a lot airier overall, while not falling apart in your hands (Delfina). \n\nI think the service was great - friendly, efficient - and the pizzas are great quality and creative.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-26", "description": "Let me start off by saying, Pizzetta 211 is a small place. Actually, I mean to say a tiny place. Inside only seats 16 people, but really should only seat 14 people. From your seats you can see the chefs and the one server. Two of the tables are in a little nook on each side of the doorway when you walk in. The other two tables seat 4 but should really only seat 3 since they are tight against the place where they store the plates. There is also a counter for 4 people. There is a few outdoor tables too.  \n\nThe pizzas are around $15-$17, but can really only feed 1 person. We noticed that even a couple of girls next to us were able to finish 2 pizzas, a starter, and even had a dessert.  The pizzas were great, but honestly were way too small for the price. Since the menu rotates every two weeks, I am not sure what good I'll do by making you drool of over what we ordered. I have to say, the crust was outstanding though.  \n\nThe service was lacking terribly though. I am not a needy customer at all, but in a room so small, I can see or even yell to the server. I just felt like we were bothering her and interrupting her socializing. We waited outside for a table to free up. The customers left and then she waited a while to clear the table, not even wipe it. Then another 10 minutes passed. At this point it was starting to rain, so we asked if the table was ready. She looked over at it and said yea, as if we supposed to know. Bringing our menus, bringing drinks and bringing us the check, all seemed to take her a laborious amount of time. Keep in mind, I can almost reach out and touch her from my seat. My gripes were not about her perceptive and attentiveness, but it is about the time it took her to actually act on our requests. Poor chefs were hard and work (right in front of her as well) and she kept talking to them or whomever at the bar. We honestly felt like an inconvenience.  \n\nFood - 4/5\nValue -3/5\nService - 1/5", "author": "Rachelle T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-12-04", "description": "The wife & I came here with a friend from work & her husband. Parking was atrocious. We asked for the waiter's recommendations and ordered the following:\n\n- Cheese Salad - Organic Greens, Artisanal Cheeses, Spiced Walnuts\nOne strong French blue cheese and one other mild cheese--I should've paid attention to the names. They were okay I guess, but nothing mind-blowing. The organic greens were extremely boring. There were a couple of okay olives. There were spiced walnuts? Nobody told me.\n\n- Pizza with Tomato, Mozzarella, Basil (we added White Anchovies)\nWe weren't planning on getting a Margherita, but Christine had heard that the white anchovies were a must-try, and the waiter recommended that we try these on something mild so it wouldn't be overkill. The anchovies themselves were, well, anchovies--quite fishy--not horrible, but not horribly savory either. Not as good as canned oysters or mussels, for example. The pizza itself was okay--crust on the bottom was quite crunchy, the sauce was slightly dry in certain areas--none of the ingredients really stood out to me as delicacies.\n\n- Pizza with San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Mascarpone, Wild Arugula, Olio Verde\nIn this pizza, the mascarpone was deliciously creamy, however, it was cooked with the pizza rather than added afterward, so some of its magic was lost in the process. I remember thinking that the arugula was a bit wilted looking, but there was a bite or two that carried that potent arugula punch, which is a good thing. This was probably the best pizza of the four.\n\n- Pizza with Sorrel Pesto, Prosciutto, Dry-Farmed Early Girl Tomato, Goat Cheese\nI expected the pesto to taste differently as it was made from sorrel, but it actually tasted about the same a basil pesto (perhaps slightly less intense). The goat cheese really didn't have that goat-y flavor, which I was actually disappointed about. The tomatos were soft and artificially sweet  (as if overripe and then canned)--a little sloppy. There was prosciutto? Still, pretty decent pizza.\n\n- Pizza with Rosemary, Fiore Sardo Cheese, Pine Nuts (we added two farm eggs)\nNote to self: Rosemary isn't ever really that good, and even pine nuts can't hide its flavor. It's just distracting and annoying. Pine nuts, however, are always welcome in my book. The cheese was an offshoot of pecorino--pleasant but unmemorable. And two eggs, one for each couple--it's hard to argue with all that yolky goodness.\n\n- Buttermilk Panna Cotta, Preserved Fig, Ginger Cookies, Whipped Cream\nThis was very light actually, slightly less creamy than I had hoped--no noticeable buttermilk flavor (disappointing as I had latched onto that description). In fact the flavor reminded me a lot of Giant brand (east coast grocery chain) vanilla yogurt, in a positive way. The fig sauce (I assume the sauce was connected to the figs) was really light and didn't add anything in my book--I think they should've tried something tart to provide balance. The figs themselves were nice. Ginger cookies were essentially ginger snaps. It was pretty good overall.\n\n\n- Olive Oil Cake, Macerated Strawberries, Whipped Cream\nOur waiter Corey (nice guy) was beating himself up for dropping a slice of our last pizza (his first drop in 15 years or something), so he atoned by offering us this extra dessert. I was really really looking forward to the olive oil cake (still thinking of that heavenly olive oil ice cream from Boulevard), but I found no trace of olive oil--instead it tasted like a dry, slightly lemony pound cake. 'Macerated' must be a fancy word meaning \"lacking all fresh and fruity goodness\". The cream wasn't really sweet, which was a positive.\n\n- Lemon Tart, Reduced Blackberries, Whipped Cream\nStandard lemon pie--nice flavor. The blackberries weren't horribly remarkable (perhaps they'd been 'macerated'?). Pretty good if not a tad traditional.\n\nAll in all:\n\nIt was an enjoyable evening, and for all the criticism I just leveled, it was a decent place. I guess I just take a little issue with Corey's statement that \"This is a pretty well known place--people that work in the restaurant industry come here.\" It was nice, but certainly no Cafe BaoNecci.", "author": "Elliott D."}

I've been here 3 times (although I chose not to wait the 3rd time, I'll get to that in a second) and am just blown away by how good it is.  When I go out in SF, this is exactly the kind of place I hope to find!  \n\nVisit One:  I went for a walk with my girlfriend and about the time we came across 211 (which may or may not have been on-purpose...) I mentioned that I was pretty hungry.  After suggesting we stop in to check it out and getting the nod of approval, we walked in and were immediately seated at the bar.  We ordered a phenomenal salad as an appetizer and watched with amazement as the craftspeople went to work.  Incredible to watch, the employees clearly cared for and loved their product.  The salad was better than a salad should be.  The pizza came out and was absolute perfection.  Everything was just right.  I assumed I was just having an out of body experience as it was pretty Zen like overall, but nope, just the neighborhood pizza joint at its best!  The staff were awesome, food was even better, and I walked into the night giddy with happiness at this newfound marvel.\n\nVisit Two:  Same as above, but got the cheese platter as an appetizer and sat outside.  The cheese is INSANE!  This is not corner store cheese, it is very high quality and expensive imported cheese.  It is not a plate of food, it is literally a plate of experiences.  So, so, so good.  Not skimpy in the portions either.  It may have been true love.  The pizza was somehow better than I remembered.  The service was great and the outside seating (which we waited about 2 minutes for) was somehow perfect for the night.  \n\nVisit Three:  In an attempt to share with one of my close friends, we came to 211 and found a line.  After inquiring about wait time, we hung out for about 20 minutes but no seat opened up.  Here is where you expect me to get upset.  Nope.  It's not their fault that there food is so delicious that people take their time to enjoy it.  Regardless, the waiter (who actually does care, by the way) came over and apologized profusely.  He offered us a drink on the house if we were willing to wait a little longer.  I declined as I was pressed for time and said we'd be back.  Here's the thing though, the guy gave us zero attitude, was genuinely apologetic, and offered an item that did have an expense attached to it in return for us waiting due to a circumstance beyond his control.  That is what customer service should look like.  A waiter that actually cares about the experience even if they are not going to profit from it.  As good as this place is in terms of food, the attitude of the employees makes it even easier to love.", "author": "Jared J."}

But their customer service/management, as more than hinted at in my follow-up review, needs MAJOR work, and I am now finally done with them.\n\nMy husband called before 7:00 during Game 4 of the World Series to pick up a few pizzas. As is pretty much always the case at this restaurant, they were out of the 3 specials on their menu. We were going to order 2 of them. After hesitation from my husband about what to order instead, the guy on the other end of the phone kindly asked if he'd like a few moments to decide and call back. The wait for pick-up was only 20 minutes, anyway. Sounds good, so far.\n\nFast forward 15 minutes. I called back, ready with a new order. Suddenly, I'm told they are no longer taking orders for pick-up because they have gotten too many calls during the World Series commercials (there could not have been more than 1 break between my husband's call and mine). I patiently lament (assuming the guy would remember he'd just talked to my husband and understand), \"Oh no, but my husband just called and was told he could call back with a decision after being told you were out of 3 of the pizzas.\" His response? A totally unsympathetic, \"Yeah, that's where we're at right now.\"\n\nOkay, Pizzetta 211, this is just super shitty. First, you're out of half of your pizzas - specials or not, it's A LITTLE ridiculous at 7:00 on a Saturday night. Second, you gave us the impression there was no problem calling in an order to pick up, when in fact, it was a major f-ing problem. Third, for all of you reading this and supportively saying, \"But it's the World Series, of course it is busy...\" EXACTLY. IT IS THE WORLD SERIES SO OF COURSE THEY ARE BUSY. We, as basic, non-restaurant professionals, know this. Why do THEY not know this?? It doesn't take a marketing statistician to guess that they should probably prepare for a higher-than-usual volume of orders during one of the biggest events to capture this city's attention, like, ever. \n\nNeedless to say, we called up our reliable standby, Giorgio's, who quoted us a 1hr 40min delivery that they actually beat by 45 minutes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-08", "description": "Pizzetta 211 is a kind of place that makes you feel special to have \"discovered\" or tried while traveling. Located in the Outer Richmond, it does not seem like the typical place or neighborhood that a visitor to SF would want to go to or even know of. There are certainly many fantastic eateries in SF, but this was ideal. It's small and removed from the hustle and bustle of the city. This is for sure a place that I'll recommend to people. This is definitely a place that only the locals know, or at least that's the impression I got.  My aunt, a San Francisco local, recommended this place to us and after a week load of solid meals but nothing uber remarkable, I had no idea what to expect, so I went in with no expectations, which is really the best thing to try to do. My expectations were surpassed on all levels; it was remarkable. I let my boyfriend do the ordering since I tend to dwell on items and indecision can take over. The menu is small, simple and thoughtful. The place itself is tiny, as in it can seat like 20 people and that would be pushing it. There are tables outside, but weather isn't always ideal in SF. The menu is comprised of about six pizzette, some of which rotate weekly, one calzone, salad, a cheese board option and desserts. \n\nWe started with an order of the mixed olives. Simply put, the mix of Calevastrano, and two other varieties with oil, chili and fennel seed was perfection. Next, we shared the salad special, which again, was simple yet every bite was complete heaven. What looked like a small, simple and potentially boring baby green salad with baby radishes and two crostini topped with egg salad, turned out to be the best thing I ate all week on this particular trip to San Francisco. Literally, my boyfriend look the first bite out of the crostini and said something he never, ever says: \"This is to die for,\" in a monotone kind of way. I looked up at him before I took my first bite, and replied, \"really?\" His lack of enthusiasm had me questioning it. Then I took my first bite, and from there on, we ate in silence, savoring every bite. \n\nWe shared the San Marzano pizzetta with mascarpone cheese, wild arugula and olive oil. This one is a regular on the menu and it was an excellent choice. Again simple, but the richness of the mascarpone with the spice of the arugula was \"to die for.\" This pizza was so good that I think even thin-crust haters could be converted to lovers. \nWe wrapped things up with dessert: panacotta with blood orange. A complete delight. \nThe only thing missing was a glass of wine. Since we were in exploration mode, I stuck to water. One could easily spend the afternoon here drinking wine and eating pizza. \n\nAs many have already pointed out, I will also point it out again because it's important: it's cash only and it is very small! Plan ahead for an early lunch or late dinner. It will get packed and I can see how long waits can upset people. The style of this place is super organic and relaxed. It almost feels like you are eating at home. Keep that in mind when you plan a visit to Pizzetta.

It's a tiny restaurant with 4 tables inside, a handful of bar seating and 4 tables outside with heat lamps. Personally, totally worth the wait.\n\nThere are rotating items but they also have menu staples - everything is delicious. All of their pizzas with the farm egg are so tasty, you must try it. Most recently, I had the English Peas, Bacon, Pecorino, Garlic, Cream, Parsley pizza, the Margherita with White Anchovies pizza, the Panna Cotta with Strawberries and the House Made Flourless Chocolate Cake.\n\nThe pizzas are thin crust, just the way I prefer pizza and are personal size, 6 slices. It's fun to get a couple and share. The flavors are simple and not overly heavy.", "author": "Megan L."}

It was literally a few minutes ago, on a Saturday night, I saw many people outside waiting to be seated so I knew there would be quite a wait to get in. I walked into the restaurant and asked if I can put my name down on the list (with a smile on my face by the way). The worker immediately asked me, \"So you want to be number 14?\" I was really confused and asked if it was ok if I put my name down again. He pointed to the list and said, \"you are going to behind all these people.\" Obviously, I knew that by the people waiting outside. And so I responded, \"how long will the wait be.\" He responded in a very rude and condescending tone,\"well all these people have to be seated, order, eat, and pay. It's going to be a very long time.\" To which I responded, \"So, do you not want me to eat here?\" And he responded, \"Unless you want to wait a really long time, you should reconsider.\"\n\nI immediately turned around and left. I was not going to wait to be seated in a restaurant that would give me such trouble just to add my name on your wait list.", "author": "Linda N."}

They'd been wanting to try Pizzetta 211 for the longest time and we lucked out on parking and walked right in.  If it wasn't for the cute, dog-friendly tables outside, we never would have even noticed that they were open.\n\nPrices for entrees typically ranged between $10-15 for a tiny portion.  I decided to try their calzone, my sister the margherita, and my brother in law, pepperoni and basil.  The food itself was delicious and you could taste the freshness of the ingredients.  However, after we finished up, we were all still hungry and could have easily downed a whole other pizza.\n\nFor a place with such a high price point, I'm surprised that they only accept cash.  Sure, it's a small shop and all, but it seems pretty popular and I bet they turn a lot of people away as a result of the cash thing.  I expected a whole lot more for our money and certainly didn't feel like I got great value, leaving a less than thrilled taste in my mouth.  For that kind of money, I'd much prefer Basic pizza.  There's a little bit of an elitist, hipster air here as well, but if you want just a taste of good pizza, give Pizzetta a try.\n\nFood: 8/10\n\nService: 9/10\n\nPrice: $$\n\nAtmosphere: 8/10", "author": "Joe M."}

We waited over 30 minutes from just before 7 on a Friday evening. But our server, who had an amusing, dry sense of humor, genuinely apologized for the wait both before and after our seating. As the only server, he was working his butt off, but overall did a good job. However, because their menu of appetizers, mains, and desserts rotate relatively often, he didn't seem knowledgeable of all the items they were serving. \n\nI thought the tiny TV in the washroom was really neat, its small size was almost a symbol of the restaurant's size, positioned perfectly if you're a male peeing.\n\nOur appetizer, the mushroom crostini with beretta cheese, was served promptly and was delicious. The stronger taste of the mushroom and garlic balanced well with the side of cheese that almost resembled a poached egg.\n\nPizzas were thin with a slight crisp and a liberal amount of toppings. There were only chilli flakes on the side. It would've been better if they offered freshly grated parmesan cheese. The pizzas were definitely good, but not amazing.\n\nFor the appetizer, two pizzas, two beers, and one dessert, it came to about $62. I was bothered that we never told the prices of the appetizers or desserts; it wasn't on the menu and they didn't reveal its price on the bill. My guess is that they were each just under $10.", "author": "Andrew D."}

Called beforehand around 7pm to take a chance and see if there was a wait, luckily there wasn't! But, beware, they seem very serious about not seating people without their full party there. Although understandable, the waiter that night seemed to say it pretty aggressively to everyone that walked through the door. A \"hello!\" first would have been nice.. \n\nCheese salad was yummy - we had one with goat and sheep milk, didn't like how the olives were served in a bowl on the plate tipped over everything (not sure if this is normal?). Pizzas were great. My margarita was literally out of this world yummy. My date had the one with curry, potatoes etc. and we both thought the margarita was way better. Pretty pricey menu but you get what you pay for, this isn't Domino's! \n\nOne star off because I felt that the server was a bit distant and pretentious. Guy with dark black glasses. He barely knew how to correctly explain the cheese to us, and we felt he had a rude-ish air to him. On top of this, keeping the door open on cold SF nights makes it pretty chilly inside, I would have like a more warm and cozy vibe. Lastly, WINE GLASSES.

Usually for these types of places I would end up venturing all the way out to the Mission or the Marina but this place is 2 blocks from my house - 1 UP! I can easily walk over and avoid the annoyance of having to find parking in the Richmond which we all know doesn't exist during feeding hours and weekends. I can also walk over on weeknights when it's less crowded so there is little to no wait - 2 UP! Ok less digressing, more talking about food and ambiance.\n\nThis place is super small but super quaint. There were probably about 4-5 tables inside to seat 2-4 people each. There are 2 tables outside to seat 2-4 people each. Has a very nice rustic and intimate decor. I would imagine it'd be a relaxing place to have lunch on a sunny day. I feel like I just transported into someone's kitchen somewhere in Europe staring out into a green pasture. It would also be the perfect place for a casual date or to gather your thoughts for your next amazing artsy project - 3 UP!\n\nThe pies. Amazing fresh ingredients are used for these little delicious pies. Topping choices are so rustic and they work so well together. We ordered the zucchini, yellow tomato, goat cheese, feta cheese, lemon, and thyme pizza paired with the tomato, basil, mozzarella, sardines, and 2 farm eggs pizza (the farm eggs were add ons).  The dough was perfectly cooked from a brick oven. The crust was crispy, light and thin.  It was so good, we completely finished both even though we were already full 2/3 way through. They're maybe 8 inches in diameter?  Prices were not bad either. Somewhere between $10-$15 - 4 UP!\n\nBest of all, the waiters were a pleasure to talk to and really polite - 5 UP!!\n\nThis is a MUST TRY.... I mean this place sucks.

Tucked away in a residential area of the Richmond District, this place is a hidden gem.  \n\nWhat makes their pizzas so delicious is their excellent crust and exotic toppings.  Their crust is thin and crispy on the outside with just the right amount of chewiness on the inside.  Each pizza will have only 3 to 4 toppings so that each ingredient shines, marrying together in a burst of flavor when you take your first and last bite.  Simplicity has never tasted so good!  \n\nThe menu changes every week, depending on what fresh, local ingredients they have on hand.  You can't go wrong with their tomato, mozzarella, and basil pizza, but I recommend trying the maitake mushroom pizza with farm egg or spicy braised lamb pizza when they're available.  If you have room for dessert, their buttery lemon tart is a must try also.\n\nThe restaurant is very cozy, seating 10-12 people at most, so it'd be perfect for a date, but not a large group.

There are blankets and seating out front to wait on those cold foggy days.\n\nBut PIzzette is all about--of course--the pizza.  Every day they have about 8 pies, with no substitutions allowed.  A few items are standard--margherita, one with rosemary and parmigiana etc.--but the rest are daily specials depending on what succulent ingredients and imaginative combinations could be rustled up that day.\n\nThe first item on the menu always features a farm egg and these are often the best choices, but the other daily specials are often not to be missed.  There's always a calzone on the list, too.\n\nThey usually have a special dessert, which are frequently pretty special, if you pardon the turn of phrase.  I like a cold Peroni in the bottle with my pizza and they've expanded the salad/appetizer choices usually available every day as well.\n\nWe have never had a single bad item here, or disappointing pizza and it's a favorite standby when we can't decide on anything else.  \n\nPizzette 211 is a wonderful wonderful gem in a diamond tiara of a city, and I hope it never really changes.", "author": "Kevin S."}

Delfina takes the limelight. Una does too. If you know of a classic Brooklyn style pizza, I'd love to see it but clearly the crafty Neapolitans are the norm, and 211 is my choice. The ingredients are fresher. The combinations are a little riskier -- say whole anchovies. \n\nI have come to the conclusion that the best way to dine out with my girlfriend when she wants to is that I just pick a place, no waffling, confirm they're open & go for it. This was that moment. And in that one shining moment, I shined with the choice -- take that Choice Fatigue of my generation! \n\nThey opened at 5pm, and by 5:25 they were a full house -- granted they have seating for about 16.

Once seated, in a window sill. I felt more adorable than I do, normally. \n\nMaybe we didn't need the cheese board. But maybe we love cheese & olives. The egg & prosciutto pizza was the tops.

Now if only they had more pizza flavors to choose from.  \n\nI tried both the pizzetta special and the prosciutto pizza.  The pizzetta pizza was topped with green chilies and chorizo, and two sunny side up eggs.  Super delicious and not heavy.  The prosciutto had a garlic base with a 4 cheese blend and sun dried tomatoes.  I enjoyed both pizzas and continued to eat ever after I was stuffed, because you cant let good pizza go to waste.  The bar seating is the best spot because you get to watch the chefs hand toss your pizza and put your pizza together.  I would have preferred an even thinner crust, which is why Pizza Mozza in LA is still my top spot...but the crust here is very thin and crispy to my liking.  \n\nBe prepared to wait..this shop is tiny and maybe holds 20ppl max.  I see a lot of take out orders for those who don't want to wait for a seat.  The menu is pretty limited, there are about 5 pizzas to choose from, a few salads, and desserts.  For dessert I wanted the poached pears because they looked delicious sitting on the countertop.  The waiter was nice enough to give us only poached pears with whipped cream, and I got to say those were very tasty poached pears. \n\nThere are a lot of pizza shops all over town, but what made Pizzetta stand out is their fresh local ingredients piled on top of a super thin and crispy crust.

Came back this fall and sorely disappointed.\n\nIt was no big deal to start outside under the heater to wait for a table inside, but this became uncool when the waitstaff merely waved customers to come in instead of coming out to invite them in and carry in their glasses of wine and silverware. Instead customers carried their own stuff in.\n\nAdditionally, the waitress who took my order never asked how my meal was and then later left the payment iPad upside down on the table in front of me while she turned toward her own dinner. She also left the door open while taking out the trash as the fog rolled in.\n\nI give 2 stars instead of one because the cab franc was very good and worked perfectly with the tomato, mascarpone, and arugula pizza, though the pizza was over-salted and unevenly crispy. (Prefer a little soggy actually.) It was so salty \nthat it interfered with the flavor of the tomatoes. Fortunately, the pizza maker missed salting the last few bites I ate, and I had a good taste of what would have been a very good pie.\n\nOkay, now I'm adding a star, because the other waitperson came by with a box announcing it's a fig dessert that they are sharing since it's closing time. That was cool.\n\nStill, guys, careful with the salt and put the \"serve\" in service!", "author": "Kiai K."}

I'm from Southern California and I cant think of a pizza place down here that compares...well Pizzeria Mozza is awesome, but different.  This is the kind of place that is one of those finds that you don't want to tell too many people about because then it will get too crowded but then again you want to tell everyone about it.  I think everyone knows about it though, looks like there always is a good wait.  \n\nOur server was really friendly, gave great recommendations.  The people in there are also friendly, feels like a small town restaurant.  One guy actually gave me a slice of his pizza because I said it looked really good.\n\nSo if you want amazing food, go here.  Don't complain about the wait.

The menu rotates so the offered ingredients change every couple weeks, the selection is limited, and the space is tiny, but the pizzas are definitely delicious.  \n\nWe lucked out grabbing lunch for four here on a Thursday afternoon around 1pm.  We got a table inside (a tad cozy for four people, four pizzas, and drinks, but we were the only patrons on our side of the restaurant so we had a little wiggle room.  Two of us got the pizza with the fresh farm egg, pulled pork, chile verde, and queso fresco.  It was cooked perfectly and had a great balance of flavors to it.  The other two ordered a standard margarita pizza and one with butternut squash, sage, and brown butter.  Both said theirs were great too.  \n\nFor dessert we all shared a slice of the chocolate torte and the lemon tart with pomegranate seeds.  The chocolate was a little lackluster for me, but we devoured that lemon tart like it was the only thing we'd eaten all day.  It was good.  \n\nSo obviously you should come try a pizza here.  They do a great job with the crust and have interesting toppings and flavor combinations.  I was able to finish my entire pizza, though I started feeling full about half way through.  Two of us were smart and got half their pizzas boxed for later, but I didn't think fresh egg would taste so good reheated so I powered through and finished that pie.", "author": "Anne Marie B."}

Pizza always does the trick. It's a humble food, even in its fanciest incarnations still a simple plate. \n\nPizzetta 211 is off the beaten path in Outer Richmond. There's a surprising variety of tremendously good, small inexpensive restaurants in the area, it's worth a drive to search them out. Pizzetta 211 is even further off, down a residential street and sandwiched in a very small space. It was late afternoon when we came so it was empty, but I wouldn't want to fight for a seat during lunch or dinner. If there were thirteen patrons, it would be like playing musical chairs since there are probably no more than a dozen seats at best.\n\nThe pizzas, lovely thin crusted creations, are very, very good. Among the best pies I've had the pleasure of disposing of. No, they're not better than Mozza, though the comparison isn't really relevant. \n\nMargarita is the house special, with excellent reason. Its about as good a version as you'll find. Here, there or anywhere. Housemade sausage with Manila Clams was my favorite. The Farm Egg pizza sounds delightful but we had no room to put it. Pizza size is petite, but wonderfully crafted in the wood fire grill and well worth the $12-15 or so price. \n\nThere's much conversation regarding the service (or lack thereof), I didn't notice anything off, but my wife mentioned rolled eyes and other things when they thought we weren't watching. Lost a star for sure for that no matter how good your pizza is. \n\nWe closed the show with a sublime cobbler.\n\nCan't compare to the pizzas at popular bay restaurants like Beretta and Delfina because we haven't tried them, but this slaps the snot out of any LA pizza I've had, except the incomparable Mozza. \n\nBest Plates: Margarita pizza, Sausage and Manila Clam pizza, Cobbler\n\nPalate: quirky but mainstream\n\nFood - A+\nAmbience - B+\nService - B\nValue - A-", "author": "Forrest D."}

Nothing else. I was definitely disappointed by how boring and sad the salad looked. I'd skip this for sure and go for one of their other appetizers which can change from day-to-day. Ask for the special starter- it's probably (hopefully) a better bet! \n\nMozzarella, tomato, + basil ($10.50)- SOOOOOOO tasty. Perfect amount of cheesy-goodness and freshly grinded basil. :O i couldn't believe how good it was for such a small and simple pizza.\n\nFarm egg + prosciutto + crescenza, walnut, wild arugula ($15.50)- again, blew my mind how perfect the combination was altogether. Perfect amount of prosciutto and the farm eggs were somehow the perfect size and readyness! It was amazing! i've had other pizzas before that had the infamous \"farm egg\" on top- most of the time, it'd make that area of the pizza super soggy and... interesting BUT Pizzetta 211 got it done perfectly. BRAVO. [NOTE: This doesn't have any tomato sauce so just an FYi if you're looking for something with a tomato base.]\n\nPizzas are 10 inches big- super thin- so definitely don't come too hungry unless you want to order TWO for yourself and take home leftovers (.... OR you could do it intentionally so you CAN have two pizzas to yourself aka like me for my next visit :D). \nI'd recommend one pizza/person and share an appetizer if you come moderately hungry and want to leave satisfied. \n\n\nREMEMBER TO BRING CASH!

They are tucked away in the depths known as the Outer Richmond. It is very easy to pass as it is very small and not surrounded by any other restros or stores. I came  here for lunch with two co-workers because my favorite lunch buddy Jane was leaving for a new job. I am going to miss u lunch buddy!!! :(.  My other co-worker Kate is a fellow foodie and heard great things about Pizzetta, so you can bet we were super excited to finally try it.\n\nAll of the Pizzetta's sounded really yummy and it was a hard decision to pick only two between the three of us. We finally decided on: \n\nFarm Egg, Kasseri Cheese, Braised Oxtail, Tomato, and Onion: http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BJR_mdN0hkcLL2X_kA0DnA/l\n\nand\n\nHouse Cured Pancetta, Radicchio, Gorgonzola Dulce, Balsamic Reduction: http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WYifpvyhLcsQI-_T6b1yVQ/l\n\nBoth Pizza's were very delicious but the farm egg pizza was my favorite. A simple Tomato and Onion pizza in itself but when Kasseri Cheese is added as well as the tender Braised Oxtail and then toss on two sunny side up eggs. OMG it was marvelous, the combination of different flavors made it really spectacular. This was the first time i had egg on my pizza/pizzetta and for sure it will not be the last time. The house Cured Pancetta pizza was also yummy but In my opinion Balsamic vinegar shouldn't be on a pizza. The atmosphere is very warm and cozy, the people that work there are very kind. \n\nThe Pizzetta's range in price from 11-14 bucks, a bit steep but for unique delicious pizzettas it is worth it. They make a lot of their pizzeta ingredients in store and they also make fresh desserts everyday. The hardest part is finding the right timing to come into Pizzetta because I guarantee it will be busy. We lucked out on going on a Wednesday around noon. I will be back to try some more different pizzetta infusions!\n\nNote: In Italy according to my coworker Kate (Who is Italian) Egg is a common ingredient on pizza! Yum!!

Even though he lived 4 doors down from Pizzetta, we never went.\n\nFINALLY I got my chance to go, and I've gotta say that this is now one of my favorite neighborhood gems: excellent food, service, and ambiance.\n\nPizzetta is one of the tiniest, coziest restaurants I've seen.  The ideal number of people in a party is 3 (2 is even better), and they definitely wouldn't be able to take a large party.  We had 5, and even though they were able to accommodate us within a reasonable amount of time - they don't seat you until everyone is present - it was very, very squished.  There are only a few tables outside for couples, and four wooden tables inside for parties of 3 or 4.\n\nSince there were 5 of us, we decided to order one of each of the pizzas featured for the week: eggplant, fig & prosciutto, tomato basil pepperoni, egg and bacon, and a goat cheese pine nut one.  The pizzas barely fit on our table, so we did the switcheroo and gave each person one slice of the pizza sitting in front of us so we could try every single flavor.  Each pizza was a delicious thin crust (if you've been to Local, it's just like that).\n\nMy favorite was the tomato basil pepperoni one; it was super fresh and flavorful.  The egg and bacon one came a close second, although I didn't like how only one slice has the fried egg yolk on top - I got a slice with just the egg white, and I can imagine how much yummier it would've been with the whole egg.  Everyone else liked the fig & prosciutto one, but since I'm not a fan of the sweet vinaigrette, I didn't really like how everything came together.  The eggplant one was heavily eggplant-flavored, and if you're a fan of aubergines, you'd love this one.  The least memorable one was the pine nut one, because it was basically just a cheese pizza (to me, at least), with a few pine nuts on top.\n\n$75 pre-tip for the dinner, as the pizzas ranged from $11 to $15.  The menu changes based on the local ingredients that they get.  And, surprisingly, cash only.\n\nPizzetta 211 is on the top of my list now for a perfect romantic dinner, and the drive out to the Outer Richmond (aka easy parking) is so, so worth it, especially on a gorgeous, clear, warm San Francisco evening.", "author": "Tori S."}

They gave us two types of cheese (we don't remember what they were, but they were pretty yummy), olives, apples, bread, and a salad with a vinaigrette dressing. There were spiced walnuts in the salad that were crunchy and addicting.\n\nFor our pizza, we got the Farm Egg, Braised Beef, Kale, Crescenza, Gremolata pizza. The crust was extremely thin and crunchy, and the toppings worked well together. They finished the pizza off with a gremolata that added a nice tartness and zing to the pizza.\n\nTo finish off the meal, we got their House Made Flourless Chocolate Cake, which had a nice sizable dollop of fresh whipped cream. The cake tasted and felt like a fluffy brownie and was super good. Definitely try this out.

There's a longer than usual wait for a table, it's a tiny and cramped space and parking is eh depending on the night. BUT, this has absolutely nothing to do with the food or service. And at the end of the day...that's what we're judging here right?\n\nI read the reviews and opted to pick up my order. As described by others, the place was packed (about 7sih) with people waiting outside for a table (see, it's that good). I was a few minutes late so I double parked in hopes of running it and out. Pizza wasn't ready yet, but they delivered it to me curbside since I was double parked. So you see...no doubt that they're RAD at Pizzetta 211.", "author": "Penny T."}

I don't quite remember what was on the pizza I ordered, but it had Farm Egg, Brussels Sprouts and Prosciutto.  My friend ordered the Tomato, Mozzarella, Basil with Pepperoni.  We waited agonizingly for 20-30 minutes with just ice water before our pizzas arrived hot out of the oven and cut into six uneven slices.  It was worth the wait though!  A nice layer of cheese with savory prosciutto, crunchy sprouts and a delightful even crunchier crust.  The farm egg on top gave me a brunch feeling as I sopped up the yolk with the pizza with every bite.  My friend's classic pizza had a nice tomato sauce with just the right amount of cheese.  Perfect proportions!  Our leftovers tasted even more delicious after a night in the fridge.   \n\nOther thoughts: I noticed the waitress had a bunch of black underneath her fingernails.  At first I was put off by this, but then I thought maybe it was probably from the burns on the bottom of the pizzas..or at least I hope so!  Also, this place really is tiny! But if you've been reading the other reviews, you'd probably know that already.  And street parking is tough in this area so plan ahead plus more for the wait.", "author": "Renee L."}

They seem to rotate pizzas, so it seems like the taste will stay fresh. Very SF palette friendly in their toppings. They had a row of basil plants in the kitchen! The flourless chocolate cake was rather fantastic, to top it off. There's not much seating, so I'd plan for a wait if you go around 7. But, they do take out!

Thin and crisp, they've got their pizzetas down to a science. We ordered the Margherita (add pepperoni) and the Proscuitto with Asparagus and Fontina Cheese. Hands down, loved their Margherita. Not only a perfect crust but the tomato sauce (had to have been San Marzano tomatoes) was tangy and sweet, and they had the right amount of basil and cheese. I love a good margherita and don't usually add pep, but it was at the request of my dining companion. It definitely added another element to the pizzetta with a lot of flavor and it's crispy textured edges. The Flourless Chocolate Cake came highly yelp recommended, but it was a little dry for my liking.\n\nService is attentive with one waiter tending to everyone. And they've got three awesome ladies working it out in that kitchen - one for pizzetas, one for salads and apps, and one for desserts.\n\nThis place is amazing in the amount of business they do considering the size of the place.

When she took me here, I was really dubious as to how great the pizza would be, why she loved it as much as she did, and if it can compare to a few of my favorite pizza places in NY. I didn't get swayed until I had the rosemary, pine nut, and cheese pie. \n\nTo start, the service was great, even though we waited around 25 minutes and sat outside at first; I did not mind because you could order wine/drinks as you wait - this made the time go by rather easily. Once we were seated, I realized our seats can be dismissed as most of the action is inside the restaurant, but our waiter was attentive and easy to talk to!\n\nWe split an appetizer of simple mixed greens and decided to skip the special of the day as we wanted to save room for the entrees we came for. The salad was a good balance to the meal, but definitely true in how it was a bit overpriced. I still enjoyed it though; the dressing was what made the salad for me. Then, our pizzas came out quickly! We got the corn, braised pork, and roasted pepper pizza as well as the rosemary, pine nut, and cheese. I enjoyed the braised pork as it was super juicy, flavorful, and had a nice kick that I did not expect. The crust on both were nice and crisp, I loved how it did not get soggy as we took our time savoring each bite. When I dug into the rosemary pizza, I was blown away. The mixture of cheese, carbs, creamy pine nut, and rosemary aroma was a perfect combination! \n\nI think about Pizzetta 211 often and have recommended this place to so many of my friends and coworkers already. I'm pining for my next trip already, and know that I'll definitely be reordering that rosemary pizza. The best part is that there are always rotating pizza selections, so I'll be sure to try a new dish - possibly the farmer's egg next!", "author": "Serena S."}

Delicious.  \n\nSmall place (four tables, seats maybe 3-4 people each) and fits up to 3-4 people at the bar. That is it! Yes i said small and i meant it. So i would recommend going early to wait for a table or not going if you are absolutely starving. There will be a wait! I got there around 630 sunday night and waited about 20 minutes. \n\nPizzas about $10-14 each (cheaper than Flour+Water which I recently tried and didnt like as much) and calzone was $10. \n\nParking around the area is a 'female dog'.

We've been going here for...probably around 6 years now? Not once was anything less than rave-worthy. \n\nOf course, we don't live in SF and we are only in the city 1X or 2X a year (sorry, could never get used to the gloomy fog, the numerous pedestrians AND traffic, the lack of parking). But when we are in the city, we ALWAYS fit in at least one meal at Pizetta.\n\nHow could I let the chance pass me by if I'm only in SF a few time a year?!? It is THAT GOOD. (For context, my boyfriend and I are usually the kind of people who always want to try new things but we just can't pass this place up!)\n\nIf you like thick chewy crusts or deep dish - ok maybe you won't like it. These pizzas are thin crust - like a flatbread- designed to let the toppings shine.\nIf you like quick and fast...ok maybe you won't like it either. They are tiny...including the kitchen area.\nIf you like no wait... ok maybe not again... there's always a wait for a table (at least on weekends). This is a neighborhood favorite. You can call your order in ahead of time for take out though.\nAnd (I think) at least they accept credit cards now :D\n\nSo despite the caveats, Pizetta is so awesome that I bring all my out of town visitors to try it.\n\nYou have to try the farm egg pizza at least once - they never disappoint. However, I wouldn't pass up the weekly specials.\n\nMy absolute favorite thus far was a asparagus pizza with preserved lemons and toasted hazelnuts with the farm egg pizza a close second (exact one changes every now and then but what can I say, I love runny eggs). They once did an oxtail pizza that was excellent too... and another time sorrel pesto ... and once the house-made sausage - YUMM! (I'm not nuts- I swear :) - but I can probably name each time we ate at Pizetta and what we ordered .... it was that good)\n\nAnyways, you get the idea. Really unusual, fresh ingredients. Really good pizza. (also try the desert P: ) They also have more familiar pizzas too if you aren't' feeling that adventurous. \n\n(And why did I wait to write this review? partly laziness...partly cus I didn't want to give away my \"secret\" but..this place is not realy a secret anymore)", "author": "H W."}

First off all, I think that every pizza should have egg on it, after consuming (or should I say shoveling) the Farm Egg, Ham, Braised Endive, Gruyere, Mustard pizza into my mouth. Does mustard seem weird on a pizza? Absolutely! But it came so highly recommended that I had no choice but to order. I followed the pizza up with a spiced pear cake with a salted caramel drizzle on top and warm pear. We also split the fig salad, and while that was delicious, the pizza and the dessert were the winning combination. \n\nTip: Listen to their daily specials and ORDER THEM.

We had a wonderful experience all around. Luckily, we had only a 20 minute wait, and we made it in before 9 p.m. closing and before they ran out of pizzas.\n\nFor starters, we had their daily specials: a kale white bean soup and a cauliflower farro salad. Both were excellent. The pizzas were also fantastic, perhaps the best I've had in several years. My husband got the sausage pizza, and I had the tomato with white anchovies.

If you appreciate pizza that isn't simply thick bread dough, globs of cheese, and toppings dumped on it drown in tomato sauce, then this is the place. Crusts are delicately formed, thin and crispy, toppings are selected and mixed together based on their blended tastes and harmony. Nothing is over done or under cooked. The style is chic and elegant.

Like a random residential block on the outer fringes of the Outer Richmond neighborhood in way-outer S.F where the graceful geniuses of gourmet who preside over Pizzetta 211 ply their trade.  This is one of the legendary Alice Waters' favorite San Francisco spots, and the place evokes all the creative locavorian glory that Waters patented so many years ago.  \n\nThe restaurant is very small, the tables tiny (including a few outside), and the mood strikingly intimate.  Everything is close together and comfortable.  Many of the fresh ingredients that inspire the menu, which changes weekly, are displayed in plates and bowls along a counter within easy view of the pint-sized dining room.  The picture-perfect daily desserts sit suggestively between the tables and the small kitchen, presiding over the room, daring you to leave room for indulgence (which I, alas, didn't).\n\nEvery item on the menu, and virtually every ingredient therein, spoke to us.  The two starters that were offered as daily specials were the most hard to resist.  A masterfully presented and thoroughly delicious salad of shaved asparagus, fennel, arugula, oranges and hazelnuts, tossed unobtrusively in a light creme fraiche dressing.  Then a bundle of perfectly crisp broccolini, kissed with a subtle dash of chili, garlic and olive oil and served alongside a warm bowl of fresh ricotta.  At that point, it was time to do the \"pinch yourself, am I real?\" test.   Then came the pizzetta, atop a nicely blistered crust covered in pancetta, fontina, arugula, a tease of freshly shaved orange zest, and two sunny-side up eggs (a pizza topping that we believe must have been invented by one of the world's foremost prodigies).  \n\nAs we savored each bite, I closed my eyes and joyfully envisioned the chef's deft, meticulous selection of just-peaking fruit and vegetables from local farms.  A true celebration of nature's bounty.", "author": "Derek W."}

There was four tables inside, a bar seating area with four stools and three outdoor tables set for two people. The place would not be accomodating for large groups but for groups of about 2-4 it is perfect. \n\nThe staff was really nice. We ordered the special starter which was a tomato salad with green beans, burrata, grilled croutons, and peppers. It was such a good starter! We were blown away with how good it was actually. Then we got a pizza to share. It had prossciuto, pesto, mozzerella, goat cheese, and tomato. The pizza was also AMAZING!!!!! And it was thin crusted , which is my favorite type. \n\nTo finish we were offered espresso or dessert. We were tempted between the special dessert of the night which was a buttermilk panna cotta with a rasperry puree sauce and ginger snap cookies or the usual dessert they served which was a flourless chocolate cake. We were so conflicted but the server was so kind and offered to give us the panna cotta with an additional sliver of chocolate cake so that we could try both of them.

It was all pretty unnecessary and we were all pretty confused by this woman.\n\nWe told her we were leaving because of her attitude. You would think if she didn't mean to be rude she would apologize, offer us a complimentary something or other, or even just tell us she was having a bad day and it wasn't anything personal.

The waiting staff and kitchen were very friendly and the ambiance was very casual and intimate.  The place is a little small, but I think its good because more people would take away the intimacy and increase the noise level.\n\nThe food was superb.  We ordered a heirloom tomato salad with rigotte cheese? (it was not on the menu for the appetizers), the Farm Egg, Coppa, Corno Di Toro Pepper, Parley-Caper Oil Pizza, and the House Made Flourless Chocolate Cake.  All three items were DELICIOUS.  The balance of the appetizer with the different flavors and textures was intricate.  The pizza was awesome.  Thin crust, but very tasty and very filling even though it looks small.  And the chocolate cake basically tasted like a brownie in cake form and felt very fresh.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this place.  Had a great experience and will definitely come back!", "author": "Lawrence E."}

The rotating menu is a great idea, but my recommended go-to that's always on the menu is the Rosemary, Fiore Sardo Cheese, and Pine Nut pizzetta. That is, if the butternut squash one isn't in season. Always fresh and made to order.\n\nThe pizzettas are 6 slices, which is ample enough to share, but I'd recommend getting your own and trading slices. I mean, nobody dislikes leftover pizza. The appetizers change frequently, and the field greens salad never fails to make me happy.\n\nYes, there is usually a wait, but I've been lucky enough on occasion to just walk in and be seated, and there are almost always seats at the counter, too. I'm going to repeat from my old review that even if there is a wait outside, the employees will never rush you to leave, and will continue to give you 5-star service during your visit.", "author": "Jennifer B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-07-27", "description": "We almost missed it driving by for lunch because it was such a tiny place, tucked between Clement and California next to a laundromat. It looked adorably cozy - I doubt that twenty people can squeeze into this place comfortably - and I was excited. The smaller the place, the more attention given to the customers and the orders, I hoped.\n\nWhen we got there, one other table was taken, and we were seated by the window on a long, cushioned bench.The server was very nice and friendly, a UCSD alumni who checked in on us several times to make sure that things were A-OK. He kindly advised my friend and I not to spend all our time at college studying, which had been my initial plan. No idea what to do with my college life now, but I do know that when I get back to SF on the occasional weekend, I will be returning here sometime.\n\nBetween three people we shared three pizzettas, each ten inches in diameter and very thin, yet boasting a nice crust. The amount of ingredients was just right for the amount of dough, which was slightly toasted on the bottom yet still soft underneath the cheese and tomato sauce. The Rosemary and Pine Nuts pizzetta was my favorite; it definitely had plenty of the herb for a rich, delicious flavor and the pine nuts, which is not the usual fare for pizza, added a lovely crunchy texture, though it was not overwhelming in the least. And that cheese! It just melted in the mouth. \n\nThe Basil, Mozzarella, and Tomato pizzetta sounded simple but tasted fantastic, and the basil was sprinkled generously, complementing the cheese and sauce nicely. It was very yummy. The same pizzetta with anchovies, was not my favorite, but my fellow diners loved it. I'm usually not fond of fish, and especially not on pizza, but I had a bite and it was rich with unique flavor. A nice addition, though not for me.\n\nIf I did not fit into the typical broke-college-student mold, I would love to frequent this place more often, but alas, the bill came to about fourteen dollars a person after tip. A nice lunch, and definitely the best pizza I've had in a long while, but the amount was not quite satisfying. I liked the style of pizza with a very thin crust, but I couldn't see it filling up any starving customers. Anyone who is seeking a light-medium lunch and doesn't mind forking over the cash should definitely stop by.", "author": "Tina Y."}

When the dough is sold out, so is your dinner. The other night I watched diners being turned away at 9:00 pm.\n*If you are a 2-top, bring a jacket. The tables inside are mostly for groups of 3 or 4 (unless you get lucky). The tables for 2 are all outside (under heaters) plus some seats at the bar. The bar was a little cramped, nowhere to put your jacket/purse etc and you're right in front of the open door so it's going to get cool.\n*BRING CASH\n\n*Sausage-potato-sage pizza was insanely flavorful but felt greasy.\n*Daily antipasto/small plates.

We also ordered the cheese salad.\n\nThe cheese salad was fantastic.  It's less of a salad and more of a cheese plate with mixed greens thrown in.  I think we had a sharp cheddar and a softer sheep's milk cheese.  Both were quite good!  Also, they gave us 2 large wedges of both cheese, so there this little cheese hog didn't have to share!\n\nOur favorite pizza was the special.  The shaved feta perfectly complimented the asparagus.  The margherita was decent as well, but it was far more subtle.  We both agreed that there was a little something missing in both of the pizzas that made them just good rather than excellent (salt?  garlic?), especially the margherita.

I've actually been CRAVING pizza and Pizzetta 211 has turned me into a pizza lover.\nLast night I had 2 pizzas: housemade lamb sausage, garlic confit & ricottta cheese and the other pizza was some sort of curried cauliflower.\nThe lamb sausage pizza had so much flavor. The ricotta cheese cut right through the gamey taste of lamb but complimented it very very well on my palette. \nBe aware that their menu changes every week! I'm going to have to make many trips back here to try all the various pizzas they offer.", "author": "Susy C."}

I think so). Pizzetta is small. Like, super small. As in- there is a closet behind the ovens where they wash the dishes, and other than that what you see when you walk in is what you get. So there is no massive conspiracy being perpetuated by a gang of rowdy hipsters plotting to bum you out.\n\nPizzetta is in a residential neighborhood, with zoning. Zoning that says that if you are on an numbered avenue, you must close at 9. Rumblefish, around the corner, closes at 10 because it is on California. If Pizzetta tried to keep its doors open on busy nights, it would be a shitty neighbor and then the people who live on that block would be the ones writing bitchy reviews. Places have hours of operation. Get over it.\n\nThis place has the best pizza because one of like two people makes their dough in small batches every day. Like a microbrew. If you want an endless supply of food, go to Pizza Hut. I don't know, it's not a sweat shop, it's a tasty restaurant. Sometimes they run out. Move on.\n\nOK, sometimes they say they're out of dough but they can do a to-go. What does that mean, you ask? Every night, they save a couple rounds of dough so the staff can eat dinner before they go home. Pizza is all they serve- if they sell every last crumb of dough there's nothing to eat at the end of the night. Sometimes, a staffer isn't that hungry, and she'll give you her dough. So if there's a little confusion at the end of the night about the dough situation, that's why.\n\nA couple of the waiters can be a little formal for such a small joint. There's one dude in particular who is so polite it's a little weird. I think his manner makes people think he is pretentious, or ironic, or some other current SF buzz word.. He's just being nice, dude, fer real. Be polite back- you could probably use the practice.\n\nI like being able to help myself to my own water and napkin. It makes me feel like a guest asked sincerely to make herself at home.\n\nThe only thing I sometimes don't like about Pizzetta is the bad parenting I'm forced to observe on occasion. Seriously, people- pay attention to your kids. Talk to them, converse with them while you share dinner- don't just ignore them and spend the meal whining at your spouse.\n\nAnd now, as I finish writing this, I realize I should be happy that annoying bitchy people don't like eating here. More tasty food for me. Just don't go bad-mouthing my pizza-fairies, OK? This staff makes my life more mouth-watering.", "author": "Caitlin E."}

Our group of four decided to share four different pizzettas, especially since the waiter informed us that with a weekly menu, it may be awhile before we get to try certain items again.  Nearly all of the ingredients are made with organic and local produce.\n\n1.The Margherita pizza, however, is a permanent dish on the menu.  The tomato sauce and basil were flavorful and tangy, though I prefer much more mozzarella cheese. \n\n2. Outside of Paris, Pizzetta 211 is the only place that I know of that serves an egg topping; this is the place to try it out!  The farm egg pizza was light and zesty; I loved the flavor of the mint and roasted tendril.  One of my favorites.\n\n3. The arugula-hazelnut pesto pizzetta was packed with flavor and crunch, along with the salty and savory sausage.  These ingredients would also make an amazing pasta dish.\n\n4. My first time trying Bresaola, air dried beef, on a pizza.  The meat paired with the horseradish-creme fraiche, French style sour cream, gave the dish an interesting gourmet feel.  The flavors were unique, though not my top choice for a pizza topping.\n\nArrive 15 minutes before noon to score a table on a Saturday at this cozy neighborhood pizza place.  Pizzetta 211, named appropriately because it is located on 211 23rd Avenue, is proof that big taste can come in tiny packages.  The restaurant has only four tables and a seated counter area, so we got close and comfortable with fellow patrons.  Pizzetta 211, recently started serving Bluebottle Coffee, one of my favorite brands based in the Bay Area.  One Bluebottle latte with a lump of brown sugar after a satisfying meal and I'm a happy gal.", "author": "Pauline L."}

Only 4 tables inside and 2 outside.  \n\nIt was a tiny bit tough to park as it's near Clement St.  But I thought the pizza was excellent thin crust, Napolitano style.  Great ingredients and care.  Simple, ok glass of red wine.  Just the perfect kind of neighborhood place.  Lucky neighborhood people!  The inside space is filled with light (similar in look to Zuni)--pure, simple, flour dust caught in rays of light... a temple to food.\n\nI talked to the elderly locals next to me, and they wanted to close the door as it was a bit cold.  The cute teachers from the school across the street looked cold too as they were wrapped tightly in their coats.  The senior couple anguished for a bit if they should ask the fellow working the kitchen if they could?  They said he could have an \"attitude\" sometimes.  So cute.  The guy with the attitude, although not Mr. Chapeau level friendly, is probably just a purist who is fairly straight forward.  \n\nI had the pizza with egg, pancetta (not much, but remained balanced), and greens (rapini?).  Pretty darn good.  Crust was properly seasoned and not over-proteined (meaning, it was delicate and perfectly textured).  Presentation was simple and excellent.  Did not have dessert (which was beautiful fruit torte) or blue bottle coffee (people should use ritual roasters too!).  But had I wanted to complete my meal, I think that would have been a very satisfying ending.  \n\nI prefer this to Paulines, which is a slightly different style and less delicate crust.  Overall, it's more similar to Pizzeria Delfina.  A bit more rustic and neighborhoody, and less glossy/chrome than Delfina.  I thought it was a tiny bit better value (than Delfina) and hope to go back again if I happen to be out there.  Also, in case you're wondering, I think Gialina's is okay, but their combinations can be sort of untasty.  Pizetta is the best in SF in my opinion, of this thin crust style.  I respected that there was a lot of care not only in the ingredients, but in expert preparation.", "author": "Philip L."}

Really, just hightail it outta there before anything negative happened. However my friend wanted to try it. Fine whatever! We were brought a carafe of water and 2 glasses, one of them dirty. I asked for ice and was told they didn't have ice. No ice??? Shoulda known what was coming!! No ice, no Wifi, and they don't take credit cards and this is in San Francisco???

I'm allergic to tomatoes, so you can see why this is a big thing for me, and this place makes really good pizza. \n\nIt's a hole in the wall. My boyfriend use to live a few blocks away from this place, but never really ate there until a few years later. The place is in a residential neighborhood, and parking can be a b*tch to find, so patience is definitely required in that department. Oh yah, and patience is also required in the waiting-for-your-order department as well.\n\nThis is a small place, so it can be a little difficult to find, especially if you aren't familiar with the Richmond district. There are a couple of tables outside, and you think...\"oh, this is cute. There's an outdoor area.\" And for good reason...the maximum number of people that fit in the place itself is about...15? Maybe less. it's a small space, but in my opinion (as well as our friends), it's worth it.\n\nWe usually get the cheeseboard which is pretty damn awesome, especially if you decide to eat it with wine. The menu tends to change on the types of cheeses, but from the times I've been there...it's always been really good. \n\nThe menu isn't as fluffy with other types of pizzas. it's straight to the point, and I make sure to get the pizza with egg. When I first tried pizza with an egg, it was because all the other pizzas had tomatoes and this one didn't. It was delicious. So delicious that I hope they never take it off their menu!\n\nThe wait for the pizza can be a little long, especially if you're going there on a super empty stomach. It's because they make it fresh. You can see their oven in the store, and the little bar area they have. It's a cute place and I go there whenever I get a craving for a thin crust pizza with egg.\n\nit's worth the try.

It's not authentic, it's some silly mix of American Italian crap, but that's fine. Just be honest about it, don't tell me it's going to be authentic if it isn't.\n\nTrust me, I know authentic Italian. I may be born and raised in SF, and proud to represent, but I lived in Italy, and have traveled all over the country, being lucky enough to explore the culinary delights of the region.\n\nBut where do you go when you don't want to wait in line for two hours at Delfina, and you don't want (gasp!) Domino's Pizza. Of course we don't want Domino's, it's not even food. Yuck, at the least.\n\nWell we've been lucky enough to live down the street from Pizzetta 211, a tiny little homestyle neighborhood joint that just rocks. Set with heaters outside (cause you know it's cold in the city even in the summer) with cute little cozy blankets is the heater isn't good enough. Animal friendly if you sit outside (we had four dogs with us last time we ate there), it's a true locals joint for the Richmond Hood.\n\nServing up tasty pizzas, salads, and calzone, with a great but small wine list, I was happy. Dripping with gooey quality tasty cheese, my calzone was done right, with perfect crust. Sometimes you just want to eat the insides of calzones, or leave the crust of your half done pizza, but not here. We licked our plates. \n\nTheir special pizzas are rotated every two weeks ( I think he told me Wednesday but I may be wrong) and everytime we go, there is something new and intriguing on the menu, but still classic and hits the spot. \n\nThe staff was quick and attentive but unobtrusive, and they were knowledgeable, telling me where certain cheese they used came from and the greens. I love food education. I'm all about knowing where my food came from, it's important these days more than ever.\n\nPlus we're pretty broke, like most of you out there (even though we don't want to always admit) so this place gets you great food, in a wonderful comfortable atmosphere and won't break the bank.\n\nThat way you can sneak those few extra bucks in later, and get yourself some new kicks for New Years.", "author": "Danielle S."}

If it weren't for my friend's recommendation I doubt I would have gotten the white anchovies but they made a world of difference. They were plump and tangy and a delicious addition.  My friend also ordered the cheese salad with greens and walnuts.  I'm not a big stinky cheese person but everything looked very fresh.  The hard cheese was good and I imagine if I were a cheese person I would would have been very pleased. \n\nMy only tip is to NOT blot the oil on top of the pizza. After going to Cal and eating hundreds of slices of Blondie's and Fat Slice, it's just what I do.  My friend was appalled.

I wouldn't consider myself as a pizza snob, but I am pretty picky about my pizza. \n\nI like thin-crust pizza with very simple but fresh ingredients. Pizzetta 211 changes their menu quite often based on the in-season ingredients available. They have a very simple but good menu.  I heard their ingredients are all organic. They have been doing a good job altering the menu with good combination of items as well as excellent selection of ingredients. Every time I came here, I was able to have a different good experience. \n\nYou will realize that their pizza is good when you first smell the freshly out-of-the-oven fragrance and take the first bite into the pizza. There's an explosion of flavors of fresh ingredients. Very awesome experience for quality pizza.\n\nBe aware of the line. The restaurant is so tiny but popular, there's always a long line there during rush hours.", "author": "Kai Y."}

Well sort of parking around there sucks, on a good day, so you're lucky if it actually is your neighborhood pizza place and you're within walking distance, if your not lucky enough to be a card carrying member of the ORD then go home kook.  Expect to wait for your seats too, but it's worth it. plus, they'll let you start off with drinkies while you wait(actually frenchy style classes of wine, no big-gulp sized beer here). that is, if you're allowed to wait. see, they only have a set number of doughballs pre-made. so if you arrive late, after they've baked up all the pies, you're out of luck. Which is happens a lot. The wifey and I have been shut down there too many times to mention because of this and a book of other hours, rules of engagement, no-no's and other reasons that they deam to turn you away.\n\nBut if you do get in, the pizza crust and variety of toppings are excellent. If your feel adventurous try the egg pizza (not a fave of mine but try it). The simple marg's the best.  The staff is quite friendly and it was fun watching them work in concert in the cramped kitchen area. Just take what they make and don't ask for any variation on yer za. I asked for a little Parmesan cheese and they brought the main \"chef\" out to clarify what the hell i wanted and why, only to shut me down and walk away feeling insulted.  So as you can read this, and other posts, 211 is no Pizza Hut Bubba. expect good, kinda spendy, euro-style fair  and feel lucky if you get in.

It's a super cute little restaurant in a quiet neighborhood with a small dining room inside and a couple of tables outside. We couldn't have asked for a more lovely day and chose one of the tables outside. The menu was pretty limited, but had quite a few options for me to choose from. I went with a simple tomato, basil, and mozzarella pizza with white anchovies. The pizza was very flavorful with just the amount of fresh mozzarella and skinny white anchovies that weren't salty like the ones you normally get. The crust was thin and crisp with a slight, smoky charred flavor on the underside. Yum!!!\n\nThe service was quick and efficient and the people working behind the counter were super friendly and really seemed enthusiastic about what they were making.

It truly is lovely looking. The presentation here is wonderful.", "author": "Roxmarie M."}

The place is tiny and there is nothing else commercial on 23rd Ave, so it's very easy to overlook it.\n\nPizzetta is tiny, fits about 4 tables (unless you want to sit outside in the fog.)  The menu is simple and changes frequently.  \n\nI had the simple tomato and mozzarella pizza, which came in a very thin crust. It was so thin I ate the whole pizza, which I normally would not do.  Flavors were good.  \n\nMy husband had the egg and pancetta pizza.  He looooved it!  The combination does sound a bit unconventional: sunny side up egg, pancetta, green tomatoes.  But somehow it works wonder for him.  He, too, ate the whole pizza. \n\nPrices are very reasonable: we spent about $30 for two pizzas including tips and taxes.  They only take cash though.  Service is pretty fast, and each table gets a whole carafe of water (such a simple and nice gesture and yet not many restaurants implement the practice.)\n\nMy husband wanted to give it 5 stars, but guess who is writing this review?  I give it four because my pizza was good, but not mind blowing good.  But apparently the egg and pancetta pizza is that good.", "author": "Candice B."}

Cute space, cute baby pizza pies, cute people working the oven!\n\nMy kind of neighborhood restaurant.\n\nA must is the Cheese Salad with organic greens, artisanal cheeses, walnuts, dehydrated figs, and olives.  Combined, they go so well together... the salty cheese goes perfect with the sweet fig... loved the textures together.  Since they were both soft it was like eating one item with ever changing flavors.  \n\nThe pizzetta with the egg, pancetta, potato and garlic is quite hearty.  You can grow full from this real easily.  I felt it needed a sauce too.. not sure why they didn't put marinara on this pizza.  The tang would have really cut the richness of the yolk and mellow out the garlic cloves.  \n\nAlso got the margherita w/ pepperoni.  Solid.  You've all had pepporini pizza... they just do it right here.  They also do crust right... thin, almost to cracker consistency, but still able to pull off chewiness.\n\nService was mediocre.  Very casual here.  They swing by when you make eye contact, but they're not really out to check up on you and generically ask you if everything was to your liking.  If you want them, just get their attention... the place is small so they really don't want to keep squeezing in and out when not necessary.

When I went, they had very interesting combinations of ingredients including egg and fine Italian sausage -- absolutely delicious.

It's what has sadly kept me away for a couple of years, because it greatly pains me to watch others eat while my stomach grumbles and complains.  \n\nProblem solved:  we went late on a Saturday afternoon (after 3pm) and were able to snag two seats at the counter.  It's one of the best places to sit, since the staff is almost always present and you get to watch the artistry of the pies being created.\n\nIf you have not been there, know that there is some protocol to follow:\n- Order at the counter\n- Get your own silverware, napkins and glasses of water at the table inside\n- Pay cash\n\nI suggest that you order a starter or two as pizzas are made to order and can take some time.  We shared the Artisinal Cheese Salad which is wonderful and generous, and the Roasted Beets Salad, which was a plate full of sunshine-yellow beets with cheese toasts and greens.  \n\nI love the Margherita pizza, but on this day I tried the cheese, rosemary and pine nuts one - to which we added a fried egg on top - terrific!!  What lovely flavors together on the most perfect, perfect crust.  It was heavenly.\n\nFor dessert, we splurged and split a piece of the fruit galette of the day, made with raspberries and nectarines.  It's a dessert you can have even if you are full, because the crust is fairly light.  They serve it with a generous dollop of whipped cream, too.

In essence I give credit to the pizza for opening my world in appreciating Italian food, cheese and that indelible dough done to such crispiness!   The first kiss did not fare as well-- it was the last day of middle school, he was off to go back home to Ireland, leaving me with the solace of his limericks  and the comfort of  Shepherd's Pie.   \n\nSo finding a good pizza must bring out that happy sensation and must have the care and effort in making the delicious sauce and crust!  To start off, the ingredients must be fresh, and at Pizzetta's- even Alice Waters would approve of the just picked-out-of-the-backyard freshness in the arugula, tomatoes and yes even the quail eggs!  Dollops of fresh mozzarella cheese- of the buffala kind layered on top of the radiant Roma tomato sauce. The dough was kneaded, hand tossed then flattened to their Neapolitan thinness- to produce those  treasured pockets of crispiness and its unbroken golden brown edges  attesting to its baked ripeness.  \n\nThe place is small yet cozy with a rustic countryside feel to it.  I found that the best place to sit is by the kitchen- giving you a bird's eye view of the pizza preparation and access to the cheese and Italian books on the ledge. Pizza menu changes according to the season's offerings-  Pizza w/ arugula, caramelized onions and quail egg; or the Prosciutto and arugula were my favorites.  Their chocolate cake was rich with just enough creme anglaise to balance that decadent cocoa taste. The pizzetta experience delivers with 4.5 shining yelp stars enough to curl anyone's toes.\n \nPS-  It's no wonder why Italians express their approval for something extraordinary--by kissing the tips of their gathered fingers (as if the lips of of another )- and  in a grand gesture, throw it up in the air and say,  \"Molto Bene!\"  Sooo- when I find these two things together- how sublime can that be... ;-)", "author": "Arissa C."}

It was organic greens mixed with olive oil and nothing else. It was pretty plain.\n\nWhen the pizza finally arrived, we were happy. The anchovy pizza tasted like very fresh thin crust pizza with a delicious salty anchovy bite in each slice. The egg/sausage pizza tasted like this: Pretend you ate a sausage/hash brown/sunny side up egg breakfast, and you ate it messy. The juices left over are what you soak up with a slice of buttered toast. You get the picture because it tastes just like that.\n\nAll in all, it's hard to rate this place w/o going numerous times are the menu changes.

However, you could probably fit 100 of me in there. :) I suggest visiting with a max of 4 people. \n\nThe pizza was delicious and innovative. I must have tried everyone's pizza.

Kind of like when it's Thanksgiving/Christmas/Hannukah/etc. and everyone is hanging around the kitchen waiting for the fresh food to come off the stove/out of the oven. \n\nThere is outdoor seating.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-09-22", "description": "My experience with Pizza: 1) I'm from New York 2) I've eaten the \"world's best pizza\" by default; a pizzeria in Fondi, Italy that has won best Pizza in Italy's nat'l competitions many times in the past several years.\n\nOn a trip to Italy I found out that restaurants don't open until 8pm? Apparently it's because most people work until 7pm & between that one hour of work & eating, they go home, get changed, get drinks, have some appertivo. As an American, it was quite shocking for me to be told that I was not able to have dinner at 6pm. I mention this because... some people just do it differently.\n\nYou are most likely trying to figure out whether or not you should try Pizzetta 211. It's so unclear!  The reviews are on both sides of the spectrum. Ask yourself, \"What do I want?\"\n\nTypes of Pizza: Neapolitan Pizza: the \"world's best pizza\" is Neapolitan. It is considered traditional Italian pizza made from local ingredients & with a thin crust that poofs up when baked. Most Americans have never had authentic Neapolitan pizza. New York pizza is like an oversized Neapolitan fit for our oversized American appetites. Most Americans associate \"pizza\" with this style.\n\nThin crust pizza: typical to Northern Italy. Having thinner dough, the pizza supports less ingredients than some other types; smaller, usually serving 1 per pie.\n\nLazio/Roman style: Thin crust pizzas but the crust is harder & made/served in large cut squares. I haven't seen this type of Pizza served in SF.\n\nSicilian Style: Also large squares. An authentic Sicilian pizza is not served with cheese. The crust is more like bread with sauce & toppings. It's pretty much saucy bread.\n\nChicago Deep Dish Style: You all know what this is.  Point being, there are many types of pizzas!\n\nWHAT YOU WANT & NEED TO KNOW.\n\nFOOD:\nPizzetta 211 serves thin crust pizzas. Don't make the mistake of expecting New York or American style pizza. They use local & organic ingredients which is reflected in their menu. While there are a few staple pizzas on the menu (margherita (see pictures), white cheese & pine nuts, one with an egg on it), the rest of the pizzas (about 2! read: small menu) and their starters changes almost weekly depending on what ingredients they can get.\n\n211 has great N.Italian styled Pizza. Fresh ingredients come through in their dishes.  The sizes of dishes are \"European.\" If you are a hungry-man capable of ungodly damage at the local buffet, you may leave severely disappointed. Furthermore, if you're disappointed, the prices will just make you madder. $10-15 for just a pizza. $30 for a pizza, starter, & dessert (also great). $40-50 for a pizza, starter, wine, dessert, espresso. Know what you're getting into & be ok with spending that much.\n\nSERVICE\nNothing special.  In the six times I have been to 211, I have not had any issues with service nor have I been witness to any service issues. 211 has a sitting policy. If your entire party is not present, they will not seat you. The location is cramp & they realize that there are sometimes long waits.  As such, they need to get bodies in & out as fast as they can. One reviewer sourly noted that she was unable to join some friends at a table. I would rebut that single addition would hold the table up for an additional 30 minutes if they were already eating. If you go during peak hours, expect to wait. If there is a line MAKE SURE YOU ARE ON THE WAIT LIST. Again, if your entire party is not present when called, you will not be seated & your turn will be skipped.  211 is indeed cramp & such policies are out of necessity. If you want to argue with them, I guarantee you, you're just causing trouble for everyone.\n\nWhen you are seated, know that you have to ORDER AT THE COUNTER. Water, utensils, napkins are all SELF SERVICED. They are located on a small table to the left of the counter/bar. If you are immensely bothered by these things, don't go. They aren't paid to put up with you. Just tip accordingly. Again, they just do it differently.\n\nJudge for yourself; this might not be for you.\n\nDON'T GO IF\n. you are tight one money.\n. you can't adapt to different situations: mmaybe don't go. Their policies may drive you bonkers.\n. you \"don't understand\" \"fancy food\" you might consider the meal \"ok\" & feel swindled.\n\nIf you have an enormous & voracious appetite: don't go unless you are both rich & willing to spend.\n\nGO IF\n. you like healthy eating\n. you'd like to try a different type of pizza\n. you don't mind spending extra money for a decent meal\n\nI recommend going on a weekend in the afternoon. If you go for lunch or dinner, you're likely to run into lines. If you go at night, they may be out of pizza dough (only 120 made per day).\n\nI don't recommend ordering to-go/delivery (unavailable on weekends).", "author": "Nat L."}

This place is SMALL ... as in only four tables inside, four outside, and a few counter seats.  I didn't know just how small it was until I got there.  The menu rotates on what I think is a weekly basis.  I decided on the Rosemary, Cheese and Pine Nut pizza.  My friend had the Summer Squash, (I think that was it.)  A Margherita was available, and since my friend assumed I would order that, I ordered the Cheese and Pine Nut pizza.  :-)\n\nWe had a mixed green salad, and it was plain, and average.  It needed a little boost.  Small enough for one.\n\nMy pizza was OK.  A bit dry, but a lot of cheese.  I love pine nuts and the nuts give the pizza a nice toasted flavor.  But like I said, a bit dry.  My friend's pizza was even better than mine, with squash, chives maybe, and dollops of ricotta.  Very good.  Don't get attached to the some of the pizza's, because in a week, they could be gone.  They change toppings as the become available or by season.\n\nThe Scharffen Berger Flourless Cake was very good, served with some whipped cream.  The espresso was said to be Blue Bottle, but I'm not sure.  I had a latte and it was quite good ... just as good as Cafe Bello.\n\nService is marginal, and you have to get your own napkins and utensils.  Getting bread was a bit of challenge.  Hours are kind of funky ... closed on Tuesday, and opens around \"noonish\" on the rest of the week.  Open only for dinner on Monday.  I was expecting to wait a while, even though we got there at 5:30, but it wasn't too bad.\n\nWe did have the LAST full bottle of a pretty good bottle of a red called Bellesio Cannonau.  You won't be able to get it again, because we got the last bottle, and they opened the remaining bottle for a few glasses.  Once that's gone, that's it!  Just had to rub that last part in.\n\nWhile not a destination for me, I don't see myself going back.  It's one of those things where I don't get the hype.

The host was gracious and gave me a menu too look at while I waited in case I wanted to order  a drink. At no point did he say that they only seated complete parties or give me an estimate of how long he thought it would before a table became available. Also, at no point during my over 10 minute wait outside in the not-so-warm foggy night did the host peak his head out the door to ask if I had decided on a drink while I was waiting. \n\nAs parking is always miserable in that neighborhood, my bf was looking for parking and right as he pulled up to an available spot right outside of the restaurant the spot was snagged by two clueless hippies in a blue vanagon. Of course, they immediately strolled into the restaurant saying \"Oh hey, look, how lucky, there's a table available!\" and the host proceeded to seat them. As I'd been standing outside in the freezing cold for the past ten minutes, I walked back into the restaurant and politely asked the host why the available table was being given to a party ahead of us if we'd put our name on the waiting list first. He proceeded to politely, with a hint of annoyance and condescension, explain that they didn't seat incomplete parties due to the small size of their locale. Yeah thanks. \n\nMind you, at that very moment a party was leaving their table and all he had to do was say \"a party has just left their table and when I bus it shortly it will be available.\" No. He was not accommodating at all. \n\nPast that, while browsing the menu and the wine list as I sat outside in the freezing cold waiting for a table, the menu and wine list still underwhelmed me.

Pizzetta is a cozy restaurant tucked away in Outer Richmond of all places and offers some of SF's best pizza (certainly rivals Delfina for top nod).

Yes, it's fancy-pants pizza - not a place to just grab a slice - but fortunately not too pretentious, in part thanks to its Richmond location.  The salads are good, as are the desserts.  Last night they offered a flourless chocolate cake and a light olive oil cake with blood orange compote and whipped cream.\n\nThe only bummer is that I've had to wait a while outside each time I've been.

One pizzetta per person is usually enough, but if you want to sample more, stagger your order. You'll probably hear groans from the people waiting outside for your table, but that way your second pizza won't get cold by the time you get to it.\r\n\r\nThere are two tables outside. I avoid them unless it's an absolutely beautiful and warm evening. Cold wind and thin pizzas don't mix. Even if you are OK with the heat lamps and a little wine in you, the pizzette won't be. Unless you eat really fast, but why should you feed like that? If you won't do it for yourself, do it for the pizzette!\r\n\r\nThree is the right number of diners for pizzetta. Three people you can fit at any of the four tables inside and in a pinch, at the counter. You could squeeze four people into the two window tables, but you'd be, ahem, squeezed. Three people can also share easily as the pizzette are cut into six slices, which is the lowest common denominator for two or three diners. It gets dicey when you have four people eyeing six slices, if you know what I mean.\r\n\r\nFour is the radius of blocks you'll need to extend you parking search.

But this is another category all together.  They usually have two or three daily specials, which depend on what local, fresh ingredients they can get that day.  Every pizza I've had here was just so good.  And their farmers salad, with fresh greens, a couple of rustic cheeses, some olives, dates, and walnuts...this is my fav pizza in the city.

A couple of girlfriends & I went last night, it was their 1st night returning from their vacation.  We waited about 15 min at 6:30pm to sit indoors at a table.  Each of us ordered our own pizzas, and the best was the Margherita - which my friend always orders because it's staple on their menu and she can never go wrong w/ this choice.  I love the thin crust (although I'm a crush person), the sauce was delicious, and I liked that there was not a lot of cheese, plus I love how they drizzle basil atop.  I had the butternut squash pizza which was pretty good, no sauce with crumbles of ricotta cheese.

There is a tree directly in front of Pizzetta with lights dangling from the branches. Under the tree are some benches, chairs and a box full of blankets. You'll probably have to wait for a table so they provide you with warmth as you sit outside during a typical chilly Outer Richmond evening. \n\nThe inside and outside each have four tables (and the outside ones have heat lamps directly above them). The inside also has one of the coolest bathrooms in town... if you're a guy, enjoy the video on the tv above the toilet as you use the loo. The entire interior is no larger than a loft apartment. It has a few ovens for a pizza, a counter to make the food, a small bar, a table where the water and silverware are kept (you get them yourself), and 4 tables against the walls and windows. \n\nNow decor will only get you so far in my book; you need the food to back it up. And man, this place delivers. They have 5 pizzas each week- 3 that are different depending on the week, 2 that are always available. We each got the same one that had arugula, cheese, baby tomatoes and summer squash. The pizzas are about $13 and individual-sized. Before you take your first bite, appreciate what's been placed in front of you. This isn't just a mass produced pizza that has toppings thrown on it sporadically; it's a work of art. Each vegetable has been placed carefully on the dough in such a way that resembles a beautiful combination of strategy and creativity. The crust is thin and perfectly crunchy. If you're like me and need some kick, hot pepper flakes are readily available.  \n\nWe went to a friend's party afterward and couldn't stop telling people about how great our dinner was. This place is perfect for small moments in your life: first or second dates, parents visiting from out-of-town, relaxing with a friend after a hectic day of work, or just when you're in the mood for some of the best pizza this city has to offer.", "author": "Jared S."}

I will make two exceptions: the 12 to the Ferry Building farmer's market and the 1 out to Pizzetta 211.  But only on a Saturday/Sunday super early evening or late afternoon cause otherwise long wait + long bus ride = death.\n\nThis is great pizza.  Well, if you like ultra thin-crusted, delicately topped, ultra-seasonal Chez Panisse-style pizza.   If you like a sloppy grease-soaked hangover-killer go to Golden Boy or something.  \n\nMy most memorable pizza here had a little pesto and ricotta and was topped with a sunny side up egg.  The very farmers-markety ingredients were top notch.  Other standout from that meal was a definitive apricot tart: perfectly buttery crust, perfect apricots, perfect creme fraiche on the side.  And they have Blue Bottle coffee - how can you beat that?\n\nBasically the menu is tiny - only 6 or 7 pizzas that change frequently, plus a few salads, a cheese plate, one non-bread/cheese starter (last it was some type of fritatta), and maybe two desserts.

The menu is simple, but offers a fresh and inviting selection of greens, artisan cheeses and wines/beer.  The portions are personal sized, but big enough if you just want a nosh with a friend. The wines are slightly overpriced for what they are, but good. The prices are very reasonable at about $7-11 a pizza. The service can be a little wanting and slightly gruff (i.e. soup nazi's kinder and gentler younger brother) but the food is worth the wait (ordered one of each pizza, wasn't a fan of the egg pizza, but others at the table liked it). \r\n\r\nHowever, the best kept secret....is all about the restroom.

In fact, it was the best pizza I've had in San Francisco. \n\nThis is a quaint pizza place with an air of cool sophistication, not stuffy. And everything I had Saturday night is something I would normally never order.  I've never liked pepperoni or thin crust pizzas, or chocolate cake much - but this pizzetta did them all well.  With all of the aforementioned foods consumed in less than an hour's time, I didn't get the feeling that I ate too much.  Why? Because they use good portions, wonderful NATURAL ingredients and serious care in their pizza architecture.\n\nTheir standard pepperoni pizza was delicious.  Instead of that overly greasy taste you get with most pepperoni pies, this one had a surprise olive oil flavoring that was refreshing and oh so natural. \n\nThe slowly cooked broccoli, prosciutto and specialty cheese pizza was also delicious. \n\nOne of them had corm meal crust that crunched just perfectly. \n\nAnd the flourless chocolate cake with whipped cream (and this was REAL, delicious cream) is good. \n\nThey rotate their menu weekly, which means variety.  And creativity.  According to Johnny Carson, that's a double whammy. \n\nThe place is small and quaint, and the service is decent.  The workers were younger nice-without-being-too-nice ladies and gentlemen.  \n\nWe need to keep this is place around for a while - what a good find.\n____________\nTake two: \nI had dinner there tonight, almost six months after my first pizzetta 211 experience, and I'm almost positive that there is not superior pizza dinner in San Francisco.  \nThe \"waiter\" was great - not too imposing and knew just when to swing by (I'm sure the \"hole in the wall\" size of the pizzetta helps with that). The appetizer tonight was a melted goat cheese that we had to spread over a perfectly toasted and flavored thin slice of bread, with savory and soft beans that melded with the cheese wonderfully.  The greens were great, and the two pizza's just hit the spot.

The next day I was simultaneously passing gas and burping while on the treadmill. Luckily the gym was empty. \n\nPizzetta 211 was going to be my new favorite restaurant. It's adorable and authentic -- kinda like you're sitting in someone's home. We sat outside under the heaters (they offered us blankets as well). We ordered olives and wine to much on while we waited. My friend ordered the pizza with pine nuts and some kind of goat cheese. It was insanely good. I ordered some type of pizza with a salad on top, it was surprisingly good. I was bummed when it arrived; I got all excited while reading the menu and seeing \"pancetta\" and didn't read the rest of the description. In my mind, anything with pancetta would kick ass. And kicked ass, it did. \n\nSo even though we both felt sick afterwards, I will go back. It's worth it.", "author": "H H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-09-22", "description": "I recently had the chance to attend a lecture by Slovenian academic rock star Slavoj Zizek at Herbst Theater. The leit-motiv of his overwhelming ride into \"all-things-ideological\" was the set of unwritten rules that we all adhere to in order to get along in society, the social conventions that we take for granted and never question. \n\nOne very common routine is the sort of interaction that happens in a restaurant. The characters involved - waiters, customers, hostess etc. - play their highly scripted roles and recite their lines (this is the right spot to insert a quote from Ervin Goffman, the famous chief at Chez Panisse, but that would be slightly pretentious). They all have different goals and objectives and they all work harmoniously (more or less) to achieve them. \n\nNow, in a place like Pizzetta, those rules do not apply. Or, better, a different set of rules is enforced and the resulting performance is, at times, peculiar. This is not, by any means, a criticism. You see, Pizzetta is different because it refuses to conform to the standard etiquette: clients are welcome, but they are always kept at arm's length. If they don't follow the rules, they are expelled from the playground. \n\nThe rules are both explicit and implicit. An example of the former is: get your own plate and silverware as you sit on a table, like you would do in a fast-food joint. An example of the latter is: leave the place as soon as you're done, we won't tolerate any waste of time. Which is somehow understandable, because Pizzetta is a very tiny place. It's mini. It's nano. The name of the place says it all: 'pizzetta' means small pizza in Italian. Still, if you go to a restaurant to be pampered and venerated, this is not a good choice. \n\nTo make a long story short: Pizzetta offers a wonderful, artistic culinary experience, but it might appear a bit intimidating to newcomers. The waiters are tres cool, a bit edgy. They all look like characters from a Beastie Boys video. And they have little patience for those who do not play by the rules. This place reminds me a bit of the \"Soup Nazi\", the fascist soup architect from New York that we all know from Seinfeld (mental note: is it just me or every city has a soup nazi character?). Basically, you need to *deserve* to eat at Pizzetta. It's a bit like Dorcia, although nobody wears Armani here.\n\nFood-wise, Pizzetta rocks. I mean, if you're into thin crust pizzas, this is one of the best spots in San Francisco. Is it over-priced? Hmmm, if you use quantity as a criterion, the answer is definitely yes. A tiny pizza costs 14-15 bucks. However, if you care about quality, then the tariffs are absolutely justified. These guys are creative, dedicated, passionate about pizza. For them, it's like a religion. You'd better believe it because heretics will be banned forever.\n\nBottom line: if you are willing to embrace a new protocol, learn a new paradigm and obey new rules, Pizzetta is your place. Think of their sublime pizza as a reward for your efforts. After all, we all want to belong. And we all want to believe.\n\nPS. Trivia: check out the restroom. It's very creative, so to speak. Other things to consider/remember: they only accept printed money, that is, cash (I always, always forget it - and according to Pizzetta's rules of engagement, this is a mortal sin. Repent, now!)", "author": "Matt B."}

If you can ignore the bit of \"soup-nazi\" anality at the counter then this will become one of your All Time Favs.  \nThe pizza crusts are as thin as the reasoning used to go to war with Iraq but are an indulgence that is much easier to swallow -- And hey, nobody gets killed!  \nBest bets are the Margherita and Rosemary Pizzas.   Both best consumed during a hunger pang.  Supplement that with a drink of wine, beer or even water and you have found the perfect respite.

We arrived at Pizzetta which is in a residential neighborhood...much to my friends surprise there was no wait.  This place is pretty small....max 10-12 people inside comfortably.  We asked for a table of three and there was some confusion by the girl behind the counter.  First she said, you can take the table in the window, then she said oh, but we can't seat you without all of your people here....our friend was parking the car but we still had to wait for him to arrive.  This slightly annoyed me but whatever, it's their policy.\n\nThe other confusion is where to order - a waiter comes to your table but then you have to order at the counter...you also have to get your own water.  Not like it's a big deal, but it just seems a bit odd because most places are either self serve or service....this place is somewhere in the middle which confuses things.\n\nThe food was excellent though....well, what I had.  We shared the cheese salad and I also had the organic greens salad....dressing was a bit vinegar-y for me, but still good.  The pizza looked good.

Dim lighting, small 2-tops (just 5 of the or  so!) and a quirky fun decor make for an incredible date-night destination.\n\nThe pizzas here are just outstanding.  Thin crispy crusts serve as the foundation for innovative and delicious combinations like rosemary with pine nuts or whatever-it-is with the egg on top - wow!  Sounds weird, but trust me...after you try the egg pizza, you'll be hooked.  The egg is added to the top of the pizza and put in the oven just before the pizza is done.

We were tucked into stools at the bar where we got to watch the masters make their magic pizza.\nWe started with an amazing filet Mignon carpaccio with lemon and olive tapenade. It was so rich and buttery and the flavors were perfectly balanced. \nThen we had two pizzas: Tomato, Mozzarella, Basil with White Anchovies which arrived crispy and bubbly and delicious. The anchovies were not super salty but tangy and firm like pickled herring. Their tartness really balanced out the sweetness of the tomatoes and richness of the cheese. I loved it.\nThe other was: Fingerling Potato, Chard, Garlic Confit & Gruyere. It was richer, bolder and more complex. The garlic confit was zingy and the Gruyere was nutty, the chard earthy and the potatoes creamy. It was perfect to go back and forth between the two flavors.\nFor dessert we were planning on the flourless chocolate cake but the chef was chatting with us and started bragging about his panna cotta - which is one of my favorite desserts. He made it with buttermilk so it was a tiny bit tangy and not too much gelatin so it was incredibly soft and smooth and just dissolved the moment it touched my tongue. It was served with a berry coulis and homemade gingersnaps with chewy little nuggets of candied ginger in them. It was the best panna cotta I've ever had; possibly the best dessert I've ever had.

Really, the crust is like something from a college dining hall.  \n\nIt's strange, because the toppings are very good and the cheese and sauce were flavorful.  And the ambiance is great, too; I love the neighborhood feel.  But I feel like the people who started this place must have never been to New York, or Italy, or for that matter, Delfina here in San Francisco.

You'll most likely need to wait for a spot as the restaurant only has 4 tables and a few bar seats. The kitchen is open so you get to see them make the pizza and all the dishes they have to offer.

And, then, I never move from it. And I watch the movie trivia repeat a lot.\n\nWhat I'm saying here is, I plan for success.\n\nHaving said that, I have had no problems with service, but I've never eaten here for dinner or had more than 2 people in my party. 3 is stretching it. I really think this is the only way to do it here because the dining area is literally no bigger than my bedroom.\n\nIngredients? Excellent. The mixed greens salad, of all things, always blows me away. I mean, it's literally lettuce, olive oil and balsalmic, how exciting can this be? Plenty exciting! A lot of people in this town say they use fresh, local ingredients, but one bite of this salad, and I start to think everyone else is lying.\n\nPizza? Gorgeous. Delicious. It's a seasonal, ever changing menu, as it should be. The last pizza I had was sheep's milk cheese, pine nuts, and rosemary. The one fatal flaw of their pizza, however, is that you pretty much have to eat it in 5 minutes because it gets cold QUICK, and then you have congealed cheese on a soggy cracker.\n\nAnd, sadly, it's expensive, so it's more of a splurge-y lunch than a regular weekly visit.", "author": "Stacy J."}

We picked a very good time to come because as soon as 6 PM rolled around, there were at least five groups waiting. \n\nTHE GOOD:\n\nWe did not experience bad service as some other yelpers had. That said, it was not a place that required much service anyway. The utensils were on a self serve counter and the drinks we ordered were not refillable. Just do not go and expect regular restaurant service (checking to see if the food was as expected, if the customer wanted anything else, refilling drinks, etc.) It is more like extended counter service, which is fine by me. \n\nWe ordered two pizzas: their egg topped potato and chorizo pizza and the tomato with white anchovies. They were both thin crust and good in an artisan pizza kind of way. Our green salad with cheese was delicious as well. \n\nTHE BAD (but acceptable):\n\nIt is expensive. The first pizza was around $14 and the second around $12. The salad was $9. With my glass of wine and a non-alcoholic drink, it came to $44 before tax and tip. \n\nTHE UGLY:\nEVERYBODY was a (bad) Pacific Heights type, rolling their BMWs and Land Rovers and $800 baby buggies giving lots of attitude to those who are not in their income bracket (me and hubby in non-designer  threads). Reminded me of how segregated San Francisco really is. We were also the only minorities in the place but I think it was our (gasp!) working/middle class looks that they did not approve of. Hey, feel free to buy luxury cars and goods if you want but lose the snotty attitude! After our dinner, we got goceries and dim sum on Clement Street (we were planning to anyway) to wash off the yuppie-scum feel. \n\nVERDICT:\nWould we go back? Probably once in a blue moon when I feel like the pizza is worth putting up with their customers. I can stomach paying too much for food if it is good but as for the snotty attitude, no thank you. \n\np.s.

Don't expect any carrots or tomatoes or croutons.  And it's big enough for two people to share.  (You could probably even split it three ways.)\n\nThe crust on the pizzas was crispy and really good.  They didn't skimp on the toppings, but they also didn't overload the pizza so that it felt heavy or the crust was overwhelmed by everything else.\n\nThe sauce on the tomato sauce/mascarpone/arugula pizza was slightly sweet.  Normally I don't like sweet tomato sauce, but this wasn't overly so and had a really good flavor that went really well with the creaminess of the mascarpone.\n\nThis place also gets bumped to five stars because the hostess was so cool.

Regardless, you have to go to Pizzetta 211.\n\nAnd let me tell you, a fried egg on a pizza is insanely good. You have to try it. The menu changes every week, but don't worry, I was informed there is always an option that has a fried egg. \n\nStill not feelin' it? Well listen to this:\n\nThin crust dusted with olive oil, arugula pesto, potatoes, pancetta,  parmiggano and two fried eggs on top. Seriously, one of the best combos I have ever had in my life. There's no 'right' way to eat it, but the chef told us most people break the yolk and let it run and then dip the crust into it. \n\nAdditionally, D and I had another pie with hen of the woods mushrooms, green garlic, crescenza (cow's milk cheese) and lemon zest (which sounds weird, but really made the pizza). Great in it's own right.\n\nFor starters, we had the cheese salad- organic mixed greens, candied walnuts, olives, crusty baguette slices and two hunks of cheese- a petit agour (sheep) and a truffle tremor (goat).\n\nAnd even though we were full after all that, we had to try a dessert- citrus olive oil cake (think poundcake- all moist and delicious) with blood orange slices and whipped cream.\n\nAll that food is worth 5 stars alone. So to have a really great space was just gravy.\n\nThe restaurant itself is warm and inviting. The owner is, too, once you get past the usual customer/employee chatter. The two other employees/chefs couldn't have been nicer, cheerily informing us about the food amongst other things.\n\nBTW, this is a fantastic place for a date. They don't take rezzies, so expect a wait. And there isn't any room to wait inside, nor is there really anywhere nearby to catch a pre-meal cocktail. You can, however, sit outside and enjoy a drink if the weather is nice. \n\nI'm somewhat regretting the fact that I'm telling everyone about one of my new faves, but that's what yelp is for.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-09-27", "description": "Pizzetta 211 flips the bird at the notion of pizza as fast food.\n\nYour pizza will be made to order, you will wait your turn in line and you will be forced to suffer mercilessly as heavenly aromas taunt your senses. All good things come to those who wait, however, and Pizzetta 211 is no exception. What emerges from their oven is nothing short of edible love.\n\nThis quaint and cozy nook is located in the heart of the Central Richmond's residential neighborhood, one block north of the hustle and bustle of Clement Street. The restaurant is not much larger than a one bedroom duplex, and after eating your fill of crusty goodness, you're liable to want to curl up and rub your belly to sleep (beds sold separately). \n\nThere are only four tables inside, three on the sidewalk and a few stools at the counter. The turnover of the tables is slow, and so long as there isn't a line of people waiting, your inclination will be to linger over lunch or a late dinner and chat with the other patrons and the servers. \n\nTheir Neapolitan pizzetta (small, personalized pizzas) use locally-sourced ingredients. Even the flour in their dough, which is fresh-made daily, hails from South San Francisco. Our lunch consisted of two pizzettas. One featured two eggs sunny side up, sliced house-cured pancetta, nettle, and a potato and garlic confit. We spread the bright orange egg yolks around the whole of the pizza, and evened out the pancetta distribution so that every slice had a similarly sized portion. My taste buds slow-danced to the flavors of garlic and nettle, while the salt and olive oil crust was the perfect delivery vessel to add texture and chewy consistency to the mix. Our second pizzetta had thin slices of speck radiating out from the center of the pie like bicycle spokes - a spot of speck for every pizza slice. This was layered on a colorful assortment of oven-dried San Marzano tomatoes (keeping true to the Neapolitan-style) and sliced fryer peppers. The flavors of tomato, shallot and a roasted pepper tapenade combined with the speck made for a sweet and savory pie, each mouthful holding different proportions.\n\nIn all, the restaurant offers five varieties of pizzetta (technically seven considering that the margarita can be served with pepperoni and/or anchovies), and a calzone, a smattering of salads, cheeses and olives round out the menu. It isn't extensive, nor would you expect it to be given the size of the place (good things always come in small packages) and anything more might detract from the main attraction. I have some biases about styles of pizzas, and this alone holds me back from giving Pizzetta 211 highest marks. Their crust is thinner and crispier than my preference, which is to have more chewiness to my bite and crusts that fold or bend instead of break. Still, I can't complain in the slightest about the flavors, and for that, I will definitely return as this is the perfect place to lounge, indulge, relax and be at one with everyone else who is there to do the same.", "author": "Nils E."}

Now I went in for the first time, and I say this is a true Four Stars, as the attitude towards paying clients has become better.\n\nWe began with beets glazed in blood orange, served with a slice of feta cheese (the best I've ever had!),  and continued with the tomato/mozz/basil pesto pizzette, in two varieties: pepperoni and white anchovies. Both delightfully tasty, crunchy and savory! The anchovies reminded me of first class young Dutch hering. Tasty, but not salty. Two glasses of Cotes du Rhone were a good choice, albeit not great wines.\n\nThe very friendly server (with freckles and a drum T-Shirt) suggested the olive cake with creme fraiche and cooked strawberries, because \"I like it so much myself, so I want others to try it!\" What can you say to such argument other than \"Yes, bring me one!\" So she did, smilingly and it was defintitely a winner.

The pizza was rather unseasoned and flavorless.\n\nI may give this place a 2nd chance.  I've had better pizza elsewhere.", "author": "Mei C."}

Obviously, nothing too fancy was in order since we were going to be a small and casual group of four.  Since they opened at noon and closed at 2:30pm for the lunch crowd, we arrived around 12:30pm.  The seats inside were already all taken but we managed to corral two of the three outside tables to enjoy the rare sunny day. \nThree of us started off with salads, two with the cheese salad and one with the green salad. I was one with the cheese salad and it is an amazing deal. For a little over $8 you get a great tossed salad with balsamic vinegar, two little bunches of champagne grapes, candied walnuts, greek olives, a wedge of brie and several slices of a sheep's milk cheese.  It was delicious and extremely satisfying.  I honestly forgot that I ordered the Rosie's Egg pizza with egg, pancetta, mushroom and garlic.  Crispy crust and super fresh ingredients were great! I ate all but one slice to take home to the hubby. Somehow (I blame the baby) I managed to make it through dessert...a delightfully light almond cake with nectarines in the style of a pineapple upside down cake. With a dollop of fresh whipped cream on the side it was the perfect ending to a great lunch. \nLunch was so filling that I didn't even need to eat dinner and given that I'm eating for two it's quite an achievement!\nI will say that this is an extremely tiny space so don't plan on going here with more than one more person. We were lucky with four but not exactly the most comfortable. Hence the loss of the star.", "author": "Jill D."}

I can finish a pizza to myself, so if there are two or three of you, definitely get one per person and share.  Also, try the cheese salad and/or the house-made sausage (only on Mondays).  \nWhat's great is that, even while you wait, the staff provide seats outside, blankets, and bring out drinks for you.

The situation here is that they are working with a VERY small space. I mean the size of a bedroom - dining area, kitchen, pantry, bathroom, and all - everything squeezed in.

Both the pepperoni and mozza/tomato/basil were excellent and there were no doggie bags to carry around afterwards.\nPizzetta 211 will always be in my memory not only for how great the food and ambience was, but because it was also my first location ever having blue bottle coffee...\nI'd say it's worth the trip from where ever you are.", "author": "Ted S."}

Any other restaurant I would have walked away.\nThey refused to take our order before we had a table \"in case the food arrives before the table\", when they had a number of tables about to finish and nobody in line before us. By the way I am in my last month of pregnancy and anybody with a brain understands that a pregnant woman needs her food. Then we had to wait for at least 30 minutes (at the very least) before our ridiculously small pizzas arrived. When I was done, I was ready for the main course, but wait, that was the main course. This super thin crust with precious little filling are pretty much tasteless. I think they are targeting people on a salt/seasoning-free diet. The only good part was the thin crust and the insufficient dribbles of good pesto on one of the pizzas. Oh, did I not mention that they are expensive?

We were a bit hesitant as to how to attack the egg yolk and one of the cooks could tell by our looks so he helped us out and recommended just jumping right in and using it as a crust dip.   \n- Butternut Squash pizza:  The squash was slightly sweet which made for a very different pizza than the farm egg pizza.  This one was my favorite and it fed me for lunch the next day.   \n-Apple cake:  We were the last ones in the restaurant so one of the cooks offered us some of their apple cake, which does not come around very often.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-09-11", "description": "There are those restaurants that remind you, though you didn't know you needed the reminding, why you go out to eat in the first place. There's a scene in 'Melinda and Melinda' (one of Woody Allen's latter, slightly-less-about-himself films), two writers* and their SO's/wives are out to dinner in Manhattan^ somewhere and they're all debating the better way to tell a particular story. The camera pans around the table or maybe there are a bunch of jump cuts, and in and through the scene swim witty remarks, excited banter, and gentle forearm touches between spouses. Waiters slide by amidst the tables in the background, at which sit other, similarly animated groups of diners. It is a clean, well-lighted, lively urban restaurant, and you get the sense that everyone there is, if not happy, then at least the authors or recipients of pleasantly complicated lives, and a meal out with real food and real people is one among their pleasant complications.\n\nIf you are, as I was then, of a certain age (early-20's), having just made the big move from town to city (as I had just done), then that scene, and that restaurant, pretty much sum up how adult city life should be.\n\nPizzetta 211 is, in its own, San Francisco kind of way, how adult city life should be. Whereas Allen's fictional Manhattan restaurant is vibrant and abuzz and peppered with silver platter steaks and has Wallace Shawn cackl-/tittering at a table for four, Pizzetta 211 is tiny and quaint and behind a non-descript storefront on a non-descript street. 23rd Avenue, about 1/5 of the way in (they've gotta be bending some zoning laws). No reservations*^, but they have blankets and places to sit, and if the wait's at all substantial--say, more than 15 minutes--they'll begin to serve you wine. Seating capacity is around 25: four smallish tables and four-person bar and two to three tables outside for the hardy and/or blanketed (though heat lamps are suspended by the awning).\n\nI've been here six, seven times. Without exaggeration, the service has gotten friendlier over the years as they've made more and more of a name for themselves; this alone should tell you something. It is ideally lit--not too bright, not too dark--and the decor is minimalist but not spare, and not at all pretentious. Their bathroom is right out of a late David Lynch movie, and I mean that in a good way (just go in there and see for yourself). \n\nTheir salads, olives, bruschettas and cheese plates all taste beautiful: fresh, real food that is carefully and simply done in a way that lets the food speak for itself. The wine list is what it is--short, with good wines (as far as I can tell), but, Dear Pizzetta 211, Why don't you also source your wines, locally?--ibid. as to the dessert list. The pizza, though, is perfect. And since pizza, perhaps more so than any other genre of food, is a subjective experience, let me run down for you why I think it's perfect:\n\n+ great crust (thin, crispy without being crunchy)\n\n+ great sauce (plenty of places fuck this up; it needs to be a little sweet, but more importantly not just one-note (ie, tomato)) \n\n+ inventive combinations that are never shark-jumpy\n\n+ real ingredients, sourced from real people and/or real farms that aren't too far away and that, again, they let speak for themselves\n\nIt's funny. As I come to the end of this review it seems to me that the components don't exactly, or don't obviously, add up to 5 stars. Maybe I'm just a sucker for tiny places, or for awkwardly zoned places, or for places with David Lynch bathrooms...I don't know; I can't explain it. It's just the kind of restaurant to go to to help you fall in love with this life we live.\n\nGo and see for yourself.\n\n\n*Male, obviously (\"obviously\" because it's Woody Allen, not because I'm a misogynist.)\n\n^Not that this matters, and if I can write this here without seeming like an insufferable Manhattan-knower, but I always think this restaurant is Pastis, in the Meatpacking District.\n\n*^If you're annoyed by this, fine; if this is a deal-breaker for you, get over it.", "author": "T U."}

It was freezing out so everyone wanted to sit inside and they are a very small place.  I don't think they let you wait inside because of this... I think there might be 1 or 2 spots to wait inside at a little bar area.  I actually liked that though because when it was finally our turn to be seated it was nice to not have people watching us like hawks!  There were places to sit outside while we wait and a very nice man offered us a drink menu while we waited.  No one wanted to eat at the two tables they have outside under the heat lamps because of how cold it was so they allowed us to sit there as long as no one else wanted to eat outside.  The entire staff was fast and friendly.  They checked in on us when needed and left us to talk otherwise and even though there are probably always more people waiting to be seated due to how small this place is they never made us feel rushed.  I had the margarita pizza, pizza is a splurge for me but this place is going to have me eating it a bit more than I should!  It was light and crisp, the sauce was fantastic!  It was honestly the best pizza I have had in I can't remember how long!  They have a good wine and beer selection too!  Once my boyfriend and I were done with our pizzas the staff didn't seem to mind at all while we stayed around and talked while we finished out wine.  Eventually we did try to hurry out as we knew others were waiting and the place being so small we didn't want to take advantage.  This is going to be my top place for a date night near my boyfriend's house that's for sure.  I think for all the fresh, local and organic ingredients this place is very reasonable.

Although I'm a sucker for cheese and bread, you wouldn't think to get cheese and bread as a prelude to pizza, but it worked out nicely.  My one complaint is that the rind on one of the cheeses tasted a bit like chlorine.  Easy enough to fix: cut off the rind.\n\nWith regards to the pizza, I hate it when people describe food as \"sublime,\" but I'll have to say the pizza was just that.  Nice, thin crust that you could fold in half without it breaking or dumping out the contents.  The fresh lemon squeezed over the top made gave the broccoli rabe a nice bite with the salty prosciutto.\n\nThe ginger cake was, to put it simply, a nice finish.  I'm not sure how the pear was prepared (it looked like it had been caramelized in a pan with sugar), but it finished things up nicely.\n\nAs far as the service goes, they were very pleasant.  Maybe it was because we didn't try to cram into a tiny restaurant instead of waiting outside for our names to be called, or we didn't insist on sitting in an empty chair, despite the fact that there was a list of names ahead of us.  Either way, the server brought the check to the table, apparently something of a rarity at Pizzetta, and thanked us for coming in.\n\nThat said, if you, like the lady below, are 8 months pregnant, don't want to wait, there are plenty of other places a block down on Clement that you'd probably like.", "author": "Chris D."}

We got there right about when they opened for lunch on a Saturday. We snagged a cozy table in one of the front windows. The appetizer was great - I wish I cold tell you what it was called, but it was basically melted savory cheese with basil leaves in a ramekin, roasted beans and tomatoes with crostini. It was delicious. The olives for $3 are also yummy. Beer selection very good for a place this small. I had a Grand Teton Sweetgrass APA (http://www.grandtetonbrewing.com/SG.html) -- yum, it was good! For pizza, we had the egg with Tunisian spices and peppers. It was delicious. The peppers were a mixture of sweet and hot...the spices were perfect, not overpowering. The crust (most important part of a pizza) was crispy -- not doughy. Unfortunately, we also split a piece of peach pie....again...yum!! Crust was not overworked; crispy in the right places. The peaches were fresh and delicious. An extremely generous dollop of freshly whipped cream made it even more special. I would go here again and again and again.", "author": "Susan G."}

Going with this, we got there at 6:30pm(really early for us, as we tend to eat around 7:30).  I guess it was our lucky night, since we got a parking spot right out front, and there was one table open right when we walked in the door!\nSince it was still early, and we weren't that hungry, we opted to just skip appetizers and go straight for the goods!\nThe bf had the classic pepperoni pizza that he loved.  And I went for a rosemary, fiore sardo cheese and pine nut pizza.  It was delicious.  And I LOVED how thin it was!  Although, not the BEST pizza I have ever had, but it definitely was good enough for me to finish the whole thing and leave happy.\nWhat I loved the most about this place is that you feel like you are the West Village or even a little place in Europe.  The fact that it only has 4 tables and 3 stools at the bar, makes it all the more special and intimate.\nI highly recommend checking this place out if you love thin crust pizza served in a friendly and quaint place.", "author": "alex f."}

This is not much of a a take out place, and you shouldn't come here looking for salad (as one Yelper did and felt disappointed). This sweet little locale is for thin-crust pizza lovers. As a vegetarian not vegan) my favorite on the menu is the Rosemary and pine-nut. Never would have brought those two together myself, but I salivate just thinking about that pizza. They have special desserts made daily, and often have a wonderful vegetable offering, like fresh organic asparagus with a thick goat cheese sauce. Well worth the sometimes long waits.

Only wished that the server would have told us it cotained nuts.\nThere is one strange thing about this place.  You are seated, but then YOU are responsible for placing the order at the register-and it can be a little hard to get TO the register because the place is microscopic inside.  Then you are responsible for getting your own water, and silverware.  The food is brought out to you, cleared and then the server brings you the dessert.

They crack the egg on top before they stick it in the oven, so when it comes out it's still kind of runny.. like a sunny side up egg on a pizza. I didn't like it that much because I thought the egg was just a weird flavor on a pizza. However, they made a wonderful farmhouse goat cheese pizza that was very tasty.. thin thin crust. Oh, and the salad was good too. Lots of yummy cheese on it! I think the menu changes daily, so apologies if you can't order the goat cheese one! I didn't have problems with the service because we got there really early (5:30) and it seemed to be basically self-serve.. i.e. get your own forks, napkins, water, etc. The bathroom is really weird, the best one I've ever seen in a restaurant, as it has a strange little Italian video in this weird decorated box. Pizzetta only has like 5 tables, so get there reaaaaaaaally early.\r\n\r\nNew update!! I had a wonderful pizza last time I went. It was nectarine and proscuitto.

The only one of the pizettas that I actually liked was the sausage pizza...my problem with these pizzas is that the cheese on them isn't melted...so it just sits there hardening by the minute. If you're going to make a thin-crust style pizza then make it thin crust...if you're going to make regular crust make the crust tasty.

If you haven't eaten here you are in for a treat but come for the experience on its terms not through the lens of your past pizza eating experience. \n\nThis is a small operation -- they keep the menu simple, the food is well-prepared and seasoned, the choices are few, and if something is popular they sometimes run out. They serve six different pizzas options each night (three are standard on the menu and three are rotating specials) and two salads, they have olives, and two desserts (one regular and one special). In the summer, I suggest the special fruit dessert (often a tart) -- they make excellent flaky pie/tart crust. Have them hold a slice for you so they don't run out. \n\nThis is not a typical pizza place.

Got the tip from a waiter at Hyde 1550. \n\nThe honey and I went spur of the moment style, happily early enough (around 6 or so) to miss the Sunday night crowds.

Could have used a touch more cheese. The other was pinenut white pizza - my husband was in heaven. \n\nA mixed green salad, and saffron biscotti w/ vin santo to finish.\n\nOut of our way, but when we have a car, we'd definitely go back.

Rivals Pizzaiolo in Oakland for sure.  \n\nStaff is usually friendly though it's not a full service restaurant.  Order at the counter, grab your own place settings and water, they bring the food to you.  \n\nPizza is always amazing.  Nice weekly changing menu with seasonal ingredients, housemade sausages, and delicious combinations.  The Rosie's Farm Egg pizza is a must if you like runny yolks.  Smother the pizza with yolk, mmm.  Salads are fresh, though I usually opt for the daily appetizer (most recently had grilled asparagus w/ crostini topped with a white bean paste).  Desserts are always delicious and love that they have Blue Bottle Coffee.  \n\nI wouldn't suggest coming with more than a party of 4 as seating is definitely limited.  And I like to come either before the lunch rush or after as the small kitchen and small staff limit their production and speed when it is actually busy.

We started out with the special of asparagus with a lemon vinagrette, topped with bruschetta with fresh goat cheese. The asparagus were perfectly ripe and tender. Two of us ordered the classic pepporoni pizza- which I have found to be a staple on the menu. I love how they finish this pizza off with fresh dollups of basil.

My sister and I ended up sharing the squash pizza and the fennel pizza. The squash was my favorite. It was made with no \"sauce\" just olive oil, cheese, yellow squash and topped with fresh riocotta. The crust was thin and it had a really unique taste. The fennel pizza was very different as well. It was topped with cheese, kumquat tapenade, fennel, argula, and this salty ham. It was good, but I thought it was too salty. The combination of the tapenade and the salty ham was a little too much. I thought $13 was overpriced for a tiny pizza.

I sampled the pizzeta bolognese and a crazy little salad.. the Artisan Cheese salad was comprised of fabulous little baby greens, delicately candied/spiced walnuts, a medley of olives and two of the softest and most delicate dates ever (walnuts were not over sugared kind you find in most places),but the part that will melt your panties off are the two hunks of cheese.. one goat and the other bleu.. every bite of the blue made me want to lay down and close my eyes. (note: returned last night and discovered that the cheeses vary by day.. last night it was raclette and something else, but the panties still came off.. oh my God.) I think I can say that their pizza's are as close to authentic Italian pizza as I have had in the US. They had a special Roast Poussin (teeny chicken).. I abstained from making the obvious poussin reference. :O) There are about 2 tables to the left and 2 tables to the right and a few outside with heaters above them. There is a counter that features a few different wines that they are featuring that day. They have no problem letting you sample the wine before you buy. The place fills up quickly, but is worth the wait. And if the story couldn't get better, it is super casual.

But for Yelp I will share, and also everyone should know that this is an idiosyncratic little place (no, they don't care that you complain about getting your own cutlery and salt and pepper - but I have never known any staffer there to be rude and have been dozens of times), so don't come if you don't want to be part of their zeitgeist.  It is a teeny, tiny oasis of perfection cooking - meaning nothing hits the daily changing and very short menu unless they love it and are sure their customers (huge amount of regulars) will love it too.  It is absurdly expensive for pizza and the menu very limited -- like I said, go away if you do not like it -- but it inspires cult-fetish love among those who frequent it.  When our newborn was a wee one, we were going there every other day and sitting outside, and watching the sunset over Sea Cliff with good French red in our tumblers and eating the perfect pancetta and egg pizza.  And don't get me started on the flourless chocolate cake - I don't know what is in it and I don't even want to it's so good.

It was while we lived in the avenues that we happened upon Pizzetta 211 on a walk one night. We sat at the bar and had a swiss chard, potato, and gruyere pizza. It was a great experience not just because the food was great, but because the atmosphere was great as well. We have since moved out of the city. Last weekend I took my wife on a mini vacation back to the city for her birthday and her being a vegetarian, I wanted to take her somewhere nice, Greens, Millennium, etc...But we decided to try and find that little pizza place off of California. Once again the experience and the food were excellent. There wasn't a lot for her to chose from, but she loved the pizza margarita and I had the fig, house made prosciutto , and gorganzola pizza. The crust on these pizzas are just right, crisp and flavorful. The sauces taste fresh as do the toppings. The service isn't outstanding, and I am a stickler for good service, especially when I'm paying good money, but there is something about this place that is redeeming, the atmosphere? the laid back feel?

You go, you treat the employees with respect, they treat you with respect, you get what you need (water, fork, napkins) yourself - kind of like going to a friends house who you know well.  Anyway,  go there...hand out, wait for a table, eat some delicious food, and go home happy.  Don't go here if you are on an American timeline or attitude...i.e...if you need to hurry everything and need people to serve your every need.  You can go too a million other places for that....", "author": "Hagop K."}

I was bed ridden for like 3 days with the flu and was just regaining my appetite back and I finished the entire thing by myself! I got take out and it took 20 minutes when they said like 30 or 40 which wasnt bad. I was walking home with it and opened the box up and let out a large GASP*** it was so little the pizza! I ate two slices on my way home and finished the margarita in its entirely after 10 minutes. I can't believe they downsized! And the prices didnt get cheaper either, its like $10 for a standard margarita pizza. But it was GOOD,  thin crust and nice and chewy pizza. They have many gourmet type of toppings including prociutto, pancetta, goat cheese, etc. You won't find round table quality pizza here but very thin and crusty good pizza. Last time I tried the prociutto one which was a tad salty due to the ham, but it was good. The single pizzas range from $9-$13, and are big- you can share with someone else and a salad. Good neighborhood joint but nothing over the top good.", "author": "Petri Y."}

Better than Delfina (although Delfina is pretty good), better than Picino.  It's all they do, they do it flawlessly and in small, very careful quantities.  The crust is perfect, the oven just the right temperature, the ingredients fresh and always interesting, and with the wine, simple salads, espresso and desserts, it is quite literally one of the most satisfying meals in San Francisco.  This place is special.  Waiting for a table sucks, but welcome to San Francisco, what are you gonna do.  Part of the reason it's so good is because it's so small.", "author": "Thom L."}

My friend dropped me off to put our name on the list and drink wine while she parked.  (It may have been a four star, not five star, experience for her.)  We shared more wine, two yummy thin crust pizzas and a salad, and talked so much that we ended up shutting down the place.  The wait staff was delightful and not only did not rush us out of the restaurant, but treated us to dessert and an interesting discussion of the presidential candidates.", "author": "Sarah F."}

True the service can, at times, be a bit uptight or snooty, but it's more laughable and entertaining than meal ruining.   The food is always, always delicious and fresh, which I love.  The service, even if snooty, is attentive if called upon.  Bring your own wine, as their list is short, though good.  The prices are completely fair, especially considering the very small number of eaters they have a night.  The ambiance is intimate and great.  Warm nights outside are just as great as cool nights just inside the window seats.  What else can I say, I love this place.  I'd recommend it, but be prepared for what it is, a sometimes snooty, hard to get a table, fresh, delicious hole in the wall.  Try the flourless chocolate cake if they have it.", "author": "Your E."}

Excellent Belgian beer, wine by the glass, and freshly baked desserts, too.
