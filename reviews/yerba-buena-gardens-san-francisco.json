Yerba Buena is a particularly cool park because it's a little refuge to all the busy offices around. \n\nThere is an outstanding MLK memorial that I highly suggest you walk through. My favorite overall area of these gardens though comes as no surprise to those who know me: The food. There is a restaurant called Samovar Tea Lounge that's surrounded by flowers with epic food and a nice view of everything. It's now firmly in the \"must-visit\" category for me. \n\nThere are public restrooms and drinking fountains making it a nice rest stop if you're in the area as well. \n\nAll in all just a nice relaxing, great urban park.", "author": "Adam S."}

Yet, there's an urban park in the heart of San Francisco called...\n\nYerba Buena Gardens\n\nIt's a great little park found between 3rd & 4th Streets in SOMA. It covers over 2 blocks of urban landscape and includes a Martin Luther King Memorial located behind the largest man-made waterfall on the west-coast. The MLK memorial are large etched glass excerpts of his speeches that moved a nation. There's old school southern baptist inspiration in the overall design of the MLK memorial. See it! Other highlights include: \n\nAn ice skating rink, a bowling alley, and a fully restored 1905 carousel originally located at Playland in the early part of the previous century. The Children's Creativity Museum (Zeum), a children's media and technology museum can also be accessed in the South block.\n\nYerba Buena Center for the Arts, a contemporary arts center can be found in the \u200aNorth block. Eateries within the gardens include the B Restaurant and Grill & the Samovar Tea Lounge on the North block's terrace, Mo's Grill on the South block upper walkway, and a snack shop near the iconic carousel. \n\nNearby attractions include: San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Contemporary Jewish Museum, Museum of the African Diaspora, Children's Creativity Museum (mentioned above), and Cartoon Art Museum. The California Historical Society also has exhibits. The Metreon & theaters are located on the North block. \n\nYerba Buena Gardens\n\nI love this little oasis in the middle of a major city. It allows you to think or just zen. Read a book in peace. Just walk amongst the trees and kickoff your shoes on the green grass.

It is sad that it is NOT really a public space because of the over enforcement of ridiculous rules. A security person scolded my 14 year old son for going down a slide when he was peacefully playing with his younger siblings (ages 5-9). I asked her what the problem was when I saw this and she told me he was not allowed to play because he was older than 12. The rule is only 5-12 year olds can play. This is absolutely ridiculous to police kids trying to play outside and be kids in the fleeting years of childhood (trust me it's rare that the 14yo wants to play and slide) Kids are on electronic devices and playing video games enough.

I passed pathetic beggars at street corners who were being avoided by steel-faced, well-heeled financial and tech millioners making their way home from the sky scrapers.  The whole surreal tableau of American capitalism (or shall we just call it capitalistic feudalism) is disheartening.\n\nWelcome, then, to the genteel atmosphere of the Yerba Buena Gardens, where those uncomfortable truths are suspended in the designed green space.  Transport yourself to calm tranquility in the meditative sound of rushing water from fountains. Check out the memorial dedicated to Martin Luther King.\n\nThis space is removed from the street through stairs, elevation, and sculptures which bound the street edges. So, remember not to just walk by, but take the time to walk inside the park and settle down for a break!\n\nIt's a lovely space made more seductive at night through the use of spot lighting, distance from the crowds, and the mega backdrop of the walls of sky scrapers humming with business.  The chess tables and picnic stops are well used.

The 2nd block between Howard and Folsom Streets was opened in 1998. The first block is just outside Metreon, and there's a large grassy area in the middle and a stage for events like the Filipino American Arts Exposition (or Pistahan) held every year. There's always a Filipino event every year, but I tend to favor this one because it's held here. Also, my cousin was the MC for the inaugural FAAE event a while back ago. I don't attend every year, but I do like going here because it's so convenient. \n\nThe 2nd block is where they have the Children's Creativity Museum (ZEUM), an ice skating rink, bowling alley and a restored 1905 carousel that was originally from Playland-at-the-Beach in Sunset Beach. There are plenty of things to do and things to watch. Best part of all, you don't have to spend a dime to enjoy the place. \n\nAlso on the first block is the where they have the waterfall dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr. St. Patrick Church and the Jewish Contemporary Museum is directly to the north and SOMA is to the east. There's not a single bad view from here and it is designed suitably as it uses its surroundings as the perfect backdrop. This is also a photographers' playground as every angle can be framed so beautifully. \n\nSince I work a couple of blocks from the area, I often go here to clear my mind, relax, unwind, de-stress or simply just to get away from everything and collect myself. It has a calming effect and I've used it to meditate on plenty of occasions. Recently, I came here on an early morning and watched a group of Chinese senior citizens conducting Tai Chi.

It also serves as the perfect photoshoot backdrop for those who are looking for scenic places to shoot in San Francisco. You have your waterfall displays, your array of colorful flowers, your seagulls swimming in the water, your wooden benches to sit in and take in the view, etc. This garden is close to the Metreon food plaza and there are plenty of places to sit if you want to relax or enjoy your meal with a nice view. I absolutely had fun looking at all of the gorgeous architecture that made up this garden and would definitely recommend checking it out once if you haven't been here. This is definitely a tourist-y spot to take pictures at if you are in the Downtown San Francisco area.", "author": "Michelle S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-09-25", "description": "Redevelopment.  It happens, for better or worse.  Long-timers miss the old places, newbies don't know that there were once old places here.  Anti-corporate types will gripe and protest, but you might as well accept that it'll happen.  So, ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to a redevelopment success story, Yerba Buena Gardens.\n\nI'm not a long-timer.  But I read in one of Herb Caen's writings (on the other hand, if I actually know who Herb Caen is, that *would* make me a long-timer...) how this area was once Skid Row.  Then it all got razed, Skid Row moved to Sixth Street, and the Moscone Center was built.  It's a conference center built entirely underground, with a grand entrance on Howard but not much else.  The Moscone Center now takes up two entire blocks, all underground.  Aesthetically friendly, I suppose, but what do you do with all that open space on top?  The answer, as of the end of the twentieth century:  it was built up to become Yerba Buena Gardens.\n\nI worked in the Financial District for several years, and love it.  One reason is that there's no shortage of places to grab your lunch and eat outside.  Still, San Francisco built one of the largest open space areas in this corner of the city, and it's a great add.  A huge lawn area.  Trees on the side near the Metreon.  A fountain monument to MLK.  A restaurant on top and a museum on the side.  A view of old - St. Patrick's Church - and new - the Jukebox Marriott - in the same glance.  And only a block south of Market Street!\n\nWhat about the next block over?  The City decided to make this a family-friendly area.  Tall order in a city where the percentage of the population that is under 18 is probably half of other cities, and the idea of having a family is so Republican to many City dwellers.  But they did it, and now it's a great place to take kids.  The carousel, playground, ice rink, and creativity center make for a good excursion into the Big City if you live in the hinterlands.  Lots of places to eat in the immediate area.  Parking stinks, of course, but the 5th & Mission garage is a block away.\n\nSo there you have it, redevelopment done good.  Not a tourist destination, but a good place to relax.", "author": "Ron L."}

Our nanny brought her out to meet with me and my husband. This is a great mid-point meeting place, because I work in the Union Sq. and my husband works in SOMA. \n\nWe watched her run around, go on the slide and had lunch with her at one of several tables and chairs on the outskirts of the playground. \n\nThe play structure is definitely for older kids, so our baby needed an adult to help her get up the step and come down the slide together. She seemed like the youngest kid there, but she still had a lot of fun. The playground is huge, so even with lots of big kids running around, there was plenty of room for our baby to have her own space.\n\nThe ground is so soft and squishy. It's fun just walking on it. The place being so close to the carousel is a huge plus. The overpass bridge connects the playground to the Yerba Buena Garden and Metreon where you can pick up lunch. \n\nWe will be back for lunch date with our baby from time to time.", "author": "Su K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-11-06", "description": "I love these gardens.  I used to work right next door many moons ago.  I love the scent of the freshly cut grass, the circular stage near the MOMA side of the garden, the assortment of flowers circling every entrance and exit, and of course, the amazing piece de resistance, the waterfall.  It's quite a tranquil place to just sit, reminisce, and reflect on what is important to you.  I happened to visit the garden recently and had the opportunity to ponder such thoughts as I heard the rush of the water splashing behind me in a calming state as the water crashed onto the edges of the MLK fountain.  I made a wish, I wish I'd been longing to make, and I hope, I pray, and I wish that it comes true sooner than later.\n\nIt's places like the garden where you can just stare at the surrounding area and realize that you're basically hidden in your own little world.  All around you are high rises, beautiful architectural pieces, in the middle of a business hub, but in this one square block, this little piece of greenery, you can settle into your own and let your thoughts escape you.  I've spent many times at these gardens, from festivals, concerts, in passing, and run to the mill errands.  But this recent night, was the best visit of all.  It made me think that life is about the moments you live, not the moments you lost.  A very beautiful, spirited person reminded me that night to just be happy, and my depression suddenly lifted off my shoulders; she was right.  People will always second guess who you are, what you are, the people you love, the people whom you associate with, and everything else.  It doesn't matter as long as you have love.  As long as you're true to yourself. I left the gardens a new man that night.  \n\nYou should feel free to come here, let your thoughts run wild, and take time to reflect on what's important to you.  Stare into the oculus of the MOMA, gaze into the clear skies, day or night, and marvel at what these gardens truly offer you, a place of peace, serenity, and natural beauty.", "author": "Myke Y."}

My husband and I had some free time so we grabbed a spot on the soft grass and listened to some music, it was great!\n\nThe sun shines into the park perfectly since no buildings really obstruct it, there are trees, birds, it's clean, well taken care of, and no sketchy people around so that was nice. If you need a break from the city and to enjoy some tranquility, this place is it! Stop by, have a picnic, relax, lay out in the sun! You can also bring your pets there I'm assuming since I saw plenty of people with dogs there.", "author": "Akvile D."}

Here's just one.\n\n-  Take one best friend you only get to see once every handful of months\n-  Add one delicious dim sum lunch near the office\n-  Fold in an Anchor Brewery Tour and\n-  Toast well with unlimited beer tasting\n-  Set out to cool on the lush grass of Yerba Buena Park\n-  Fan gently with light autumn breezes under shady trees\n-  Top off with cookie crusted Beard Papa cream puffs\n-  And wrap with hugs, laughs, and a shared crossword puzzle\n\nIt looks like they were setting up for some kind of outdoor show while we wiled away the afternoon filling in our puzzle, but it wasn't terribly distracting.  The delicious eye candy ended up being a lot more disruptive, not that you'll hear complaints from me.\n\nWith the two of us, it really doesn't take much stay entertained.  But Yerba Buena Park provided the ideal foil to hang out, catch up, and still be conveniently located near the BART and my hotel.", "author": "Kevin L."}

I love coming here with my lunch (usually a Chipotle burrito...can't get enough of those things) & soaking up some sun on my lunch hour. Somehow it is quiet enough to make you believe you are no longer in the city. Maybe it's the MLK Jr waterfall that drowns out the sounds of buses, cars, & motorcycles on Mission St. There is no shortage of places to sit, whether it be on a bench, a concrete slab by the fountain, or on the grass. Take your pick, there's plenty of room for everyone.  You may even catch a free concert if you're lucky.\n\nThe only thing I dislike is that they seem to over-water the lawn. It is ALWAYS damp or wet. So be sure to bring a blanket, coat, or lunch bag to sit on if you don't want brown stains on the back of your pants for the rest of the day.

I reply to his questions and have a short conversation with him. When he asks me for money I explain to him that I don't give money to people. I speak to him as I would to anybody else, treating him with the respect and dignity that he deserves as a human being but I won't give him any money. he's quite insistent that I should give him some so I simply tell him that I work too hard for what I have to support someone else's lifestyle. And then I tell him that he should ask someone else.\n\nIt's really a shame that in such a beautiful city with so many resources that episodes like this are so commonplace. It's inhumane to let people live like this. We all know that these people have problems - addiction and unmedicated psychosis mainly. And I'm sympathetic to their situation. I used to be very generous. I've since made the decision that I'll no longer enable them through my financial contributions. But I digress...\n\nI walk the circumfrence of Yuerba Buena Gardens. For the uninitiated, there are actually no gardens here. But there is shrubbery around the perimeter of the park where today a young family is staging an easter egg hunt, both parents giving their little ones hints in spanish about where to look. I've always wondered where people living in the city hunted for easter eggs, not having a yard of their own. \n\nThere's a stage off to one end, and various fountains that purl and churn what a sign calls \"nonpotable\" and I suspect heavily chlorinated water. On one hand, it's aesthetically pleasing. But only if you can avoid noticing that certain areas of the pools have been fenced off because the city's large contingent of crackheads, drunks and derilects make a habit of turning any small body of water into their own personal Roman Baths.

Go there prepared to open your mind and just look around: the ambient architecture is really impressive. The Sony Center is disappointing: they spent a bomb on that place, and for that money should have employed more imagination. But the rest, including that dinky little church nearby: yeah, worth looking at.  It should make you really really happy you're not in Des Moines.", "author": "Rowley A."}
