The lady took our order and brought us some water. Not sure what my other friends ordered but i had a pineapple fried rice. Don't want the review to be too long but basically from the time we entered and were seated i waited 1 hour for my food to arrive. I couldn't wait any longer so since my friends had their food come by one by one, i cancelled my order and ate the food my friends shared with me. Bad part about this was a lady came to let us know that meal was being prepped during our 1 hour wait. Basically food started coming in after 35 min or so. Lady did apologize at the end but i lost my appetite by then.", "author": "Saugat P."}

I've only gotten Ploy II for delivery so I can't speak to the service or atmosphere. In regards to their delivery, it's speedier than most Eat24 places, delivering well in their window. \n\nThe food, is just pretty average. Nothing disappointing per say, I am full after eating the dish, but nothing that makes me want to order it again next time I'm craving thai food. One time I ordered a Tom Kha soup (I know, soup to go is the worst idea) and when it arrived, the portion was huge! It lasted me 3 meals. However, the coconut milk started separating from the broth and the soup became slightly gritty as the consistency changed. There were also a lot of pieces of galanga? or what tasted like overcooked lotus root that were very strange. I wasn't sure if they were edible or not based on how they looked, but I ate them anyway and I have survived. \n\nWith their pad thai and other noodle dishes being just average and me having an unusual experience with their soup, it'll probably be a while before I order from Ploy again. Or maybe next time I won't be lazy and actually eat in the restaurant!", "author": "Barbara C."}

The fireplace is still present (not sure if it still works) and all sorts of homey Thai decorations and random Christmas tinsel garlands adorns the walls.  I've taken a few different people here and they always ask me how I found this place.\n\nThe food its typical Thai fare.  I'd recommend the Basil chicken or the Pumpkin Curry which is rich, smooth, and fills you up fast so you can always get leftovers.  \n\nI like the tables that overlook Haight Street for people watching, but they can be hard to snag if the restaurant is busy.", "author": "Joan W."}

A little walk up some steps and you're greeted by a cozy atmosphere that others might think of as cramped. I like to think of it as my grandma's lil' cramped, homey apartment. Same vibes going on here. With that being said, if the place is full, it'll get awkward to try to walk by other tables, with your booty lightly grazing the backs of strangers chairs. For the time I went, it wasn't a huge problem since we were the only ones in the restaurant. \n\nMy party of 8 ordered our food and the whole staff seemed to disappear. We were seated right by the kitchen which we can directly see into and we saw everyone sitting around watching an asian drama and eating. Half an hour goes by. Nothing. 40 minutes go by. Then we see someone get up and start cooking and then all of our food comes out in 10 more minutes. Like I said, we were the only ones there, so the meal would've been more enjoyable if they didn't keep us waiting or at least pretended they were cooking by checking on us to refill our empty waters.\n\nI will give it to them that their pad see ew was some of the best I've had.

We were a party of 17 but my friend was able to secure a reservation ahead of time. They seated us upstairs in a semi-private room, which worked out well so we could still all talk to each other. We were split into 2 long tables. \n\nThe restaurant is inside a cute Victorian house in Haight area. The sign doesn't pop out so you may easily walk pass it if you weren't keeping an eye out! They put their ginormous menu on the outside of door so you can take a peek to see if anything catches your eye before going inside.\n\nFor my table, we started off by sharing some appetizers -- SPICY TOFU, FRIED TOFU, and SPICY CHICKEN WINGS. Both tofu dishes were very flavorful! I loved the peanut sauce that came with the fried tofu. But the spicy tofu was our table's favorite because of the sweet and spicy sauce that covered the crispy outsides of the tofu pieces. I think the same sauce were used for the chicken wings too. They left the tips of chicken wings on so it was a bit harder to eat, but still very flavorful. \n\nFor my entree, I split the CRAB NOODLES with my boyfriend. Their portions are really big so I'm glad we split this! The noodles were tender and evenly covered with sauce. You could taste the \"wok flavor,\" which is hard to accomplish at home. I would like this even more if the crab pieces were bigger. My friends had the PAD SEE YEW (with chicken and beef), TOM YUM SOUP, SPICY FISH FILLET, YELLOW CURRY and ROASTED DUCK OVER SPINACH. We all pretty much finished all our food and were very satisfied. A few of us also got the THAI ICED TEA and it was sweet but not overbearing. \n\nTheir service for our large party was good -- our drinks were refilled promptly and they didn't hesitate to bring us chili paste and other condiments when requested. However, the timing of the food was a bit staggered. At my table, my boyfriend and I were the last to receive our entree even though we ordered first. And our second table started to get their food even though they ordered 10 minutes after us. But we eventually got all the food and spent lots of time chatting to catch up, so the timing of the food didn't pose too much of an issue.\n\nNote that they automatically include gratuity for big parties. They also write out all orders in Thai on the receipt, so make sure you double-check if you received all your food orders.  One of our tables didn't get their fresh spring roll and a tofu dish and had to remind waitress to not include those charges, since we couldn't tell if they wrote it on receipt.\n\nI'd come back here again especially if I had a large group and wanted to eat near Golden Gate Park.", "author": "Bonnie Z."}

The food is solid but what I really like is the ambiance and feel of the restaurant. It's a converted Victorian house which makes it very unique, and reminds me of X-ing in Washington DC. What also makes the ambiance more unique is the Thai music and decor... for an interesting Thai-Victorian feel.\n\nI've gotten the pad Thai, pad kee mao, Tom yum noodle soup and curry. All are really good, the Tom yum is probably better without noodles though. Fantastic Thai iced tea and mango sticky rice desert. \n\nThe main reason that I knocked off a star is because the bill was $96 and they rounded it up to $100. They corrected it when we asked but that seemed odd. Also, it's difficult to read the bill handwriting - nitpicky stuff.", "author": "Stephanie T."}

Today, it was coconut-based and delicious. The entre arrived with a generous helping of white rice. The Spicy Prawns were mixed with red bell pepper and green beans. Although they were really quite tasty they were swimming in oil. The Corncakes arrived fried to a light crisp with a sweet dipping sauce.\n\nWe also tried the $12.95 Pad See Ew and Egg Rolls lunch combo. This was a beef and wide noodle dish similar to a Chow Fun. Also with soup but no rice or corncakes, rather Egg Rolls.

I have had takeout from here multiple times but this was my first dine-in experience. Based on the service, I am inclined to recommend it as a takeout spot over dine-in.\n\nI went with a group of friends and we got several items to share - papaya salad, pad kee noodles, eggplant, red curry, and the tom kha soup (all vegetarian). The papaya salad was decent but I don't think good enough to order again. I would recommend the noodles and the curry. I especially liked the cute fish dish the curry came in that allowed you to pour the sauce over your rice.\n\nThe prices are what you would expect and fair by SF standards. They do have great cheap wine options. It was very busy when we went and the servers were definitely working hard, but there was just not enough staff for the amount of patrons. We waited a very long time to order, get our food, and pay, so if you want to eat at the restaurant, be prepared for a leisurely meal!

Surface level, how amazing does that sound, right?? \n\nOrdered from Yelp24 and waited over an hour for our food to arrive. Honestly, with the amount of food apps out there, how has Yelp24 not gotten any better? All the other ones give you real time updates. Yelp24 gives you a countdown to an unreal time...sorry for the Yelp24 tangent, but maybe it was tied to the restaurant's take out issue as well. Said the food would arrive by 7:40pm (over an hour past our order time). That was a lie. Called Yelp24 at 8pm, and they said it was FINALLY on its way. Fine, fine. Warriors game night. I get it. \n\nAnyways, the food overall was not good...not like it wasn't fresh(ish) ingredients, but nothing had any flavor???? Starting with the calamari salad...it was straight up a handful of calamari pieces on top of two huge chunks of lettuce. Uhhh ok. The crab noodle had zero flavor...plus, where was the crab?! It was like a flavorless pad Thai without crab meat! Uhhh ok. Then the salmon filet peanut sauce just confused the hell out of me. Salmon was goodish. Peanut sauce was flavorful. Both things together? Tasted like both things were battling it out and neither won. Uhhh no. THEN the mango coconut rice...supposed to be the star of the show, right?!

EAT24 estimated order delivery  at 6:28pm. \nWhen I called the restaurant to check on the order, the staff did not answer the phone for over 10 min .Finally, at 6:45pm I managed to get them to pick up and I inquired about the order. Despite the fact the the order was already late, the staff was not helpful and did not even apologize, citing the storm was causing a delay and said order would arrive at 7pm. \n\nWhen the order finally arrived at 7:20pm, every plastic container holding the food was either broken or shattered. The worse was the Pad See Ew which was leaking into the bag and on everything else. Trying to salvage whatever was left of it, just made it worse and the broken plastic just mixed into the food and it became inedible. \n\nI called the restaurant Immediately to complain about delivery time but mostly about the packaging of the order and again, the staff was not helpful nor did they believe what I was claiming. Instead of taking responsibility or apologizing, they insinuated that my phone number in their system might have been the cause of the delay, even thought I called 35 min earlier and they mentioned nothing about it. At this point, I was pissed as I could not eat the food and it was already over 2 HOURS after I placed the order. \nAs a result, I asked for a refund due to the unacceptable wait time and the broken containers, the staff said they would call me back after consulting with the manager. 10 minutes later, the manager called back and asked me to pack the food (in the broken container!?!) as they are interested in coming picking it up.\n \nLess than 10 min later, the manger and one of his staff members showed up at my door step asking to see the packaging and the food. I placed the food and whatever was left from the container in the bag they deliver it and handed it over to the manager. They immediately asked for the rest of the food (Seriously?!) and instead I showed them the pictures and video I took with my phone, once I noticed the condition of the order once it was delivered. \n\nAfter seeing the status of the bag, the pictures and video, the manager refunded the money back but at this point the damage was already done, mostly due to their attitude from the get go.\n\nDespite the refund, I am just speechless that they asked to see the rest of the food as if I was lying.

Here's why:\n\n- It is genuinely authentic to Haight-Ashbury culture. Located upstairs in an old victorian over-looking Haight St, it has just the right amount of wacky SF charm. Carpeted floors, hand-written signage, christmas lights, and kitsch Valentine's decorations make this restaurant really endearing. \n\n- The food is bomb. I've had the panang curry with shrimp, papaya salad, chicken pad see ew, and duck breast curry and I would eat all of them again for breakfast the next morning - in fact, I did. I'm still day dreaming about the pad see ew from last night and strongly considering going back tonight. It's THAT good. \n\n- Good service, not crowded. Granted, I have only been to Ploy II on rainy days (also, perfect hot Thai food days) but I've never had to wait and always had attentive service. \n\nI'm all-in on Ploy II, but like other reviewers I want to know - what happened to Ploy I?", "author": "Stephanie D."}

I read someones review saying that when you get it to-go you get more and perhaps that's true because I had enough for two full meals.\n\nNegative star because I asked for it to be spicy and repeated it twice and it had zero spice. That's always my biggest issue with thai places - they never actually make it spicy when I request. \n\nAlso the lady I order from on the phone spoke so fast and hardly listened, I wasn't sure she got our order.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-16", "description": "My boyfriend and I came here for a late lunch on a sunny day and found the restaurant relatively quiet. The restaurant, as many other reviews have mentioned, appears to be a converted apartment. The atmosphere very cozy and the sunlight was shining through the large windows that point towards the bustling Haight street. Scattered along the walls are handwritten signs such as \"Thai ice tea with free refills\" and a variety of Thai decorations. One plus is that they have free delivery with a minimum $20 order, which we have utilized twice before visiting the actual store.\n\nThe Pad See Ew with Beef is AMAZING. This is my go-to order at any Thai place and Ploy II's pad see ew is the best I've ever had. The noodles are a slightly chewier consistency than usual and is the reason the dish is so delicious. The beef is a little overcooked, but regardless delicious and a good complement to the noodles. The portion size is also quite significant, which is always a plus.\n\nAnother great find was the Mango Panang Curry with chicken, which is actually not on the normal menu (but is on the picture menu). This curry sauce was infused with mango, creating a unique blend of flavors, and with several cuts of mango itself. Ask your waiter/waitress to add mango to the panang curry, which is an extra $2! \n\nWe've also tried the Green Curry with Chicken, which was okay. It does not stand out from any other Thai curry dish I've ever eaten, but honestly is still delicious and was quickly finished. The portion size was a lot smaller than the pad see ew. \n\nPad Thai with Chicken is another one of my favorites Thai dishes. My boyfriend thought Ploy II's dish was better than the green curry, though I felt the noodles seemed a little under-cooked. There is not as much chicken as I would have thought, though does come with tofu and egg as well. The portion size is about the same as the Pad See Ew.\n\nOverall: Ploy II is an authentic, solid Thai restaurant. I will 100% be back (or reorder) the Pad See Ew again and possibly the Mango Panang Curry. The Green Curry and Pad Thai were simply okay and I recommend venturing beyond these staple dishes.", "author": "Vivian L."}

You open the door, immediately walk up a set of stairs, and are seated in what was once someone's large carpeted living room and dining room. The kitchen, visible from your table, also clearly once was someone's apartment kitchen, not an industrial sized restaurant kitchen. \n\nPloy II's health score is on the low end, probably because they're prepping, cooking, and storing everything in an apartment, not a restaurant kitchen, but I've never gotten sick in the handful of times I have eaten here. That having been said the tables, carpeted eating area, and bathroom are all a bit worn out and dirty. But that's pretty typical for hole-in-the-wall restaurants in SF. \n\nPloy II's food is okay, but really I've found nothing special. They have all of the typical Thai restaurant dishes you can imagine: various curries, pad thai, pad see ew, larb, tom kha, chicken satay, etc. IMO the yellow curry with a side of steamed rice is probably the best dish I've had at Ploy II. Ordered the tom kha noodle soup and was seriously disappointed the broth was watery and bland, no flavor! Chicken satay is on par here: nice large pieces of chicken on a skewer with a bomb peanut dipping sauce. \n\nIf you're new to Thai food or just have never had better you might think Ploy II is pretty good but Ploy II just falls a little short of a lot of the other local Thai places.

Decided that I was too hungry to wait and walk home, so I called up my friend who lived in the area and we got dinner. \n\nOriginally we were trying to go to Siam Lotus, but it turned out to be closed. Stumbled upon this place and it's super like your typical Asian restaurant, decor and all. I was surprised this place was in the Upper Haight. \n\nWe each ordered our own noodle dish and wow it was like a mountain of noodles when we got them. Proportions were large and it was your standard pricing. Perhaps I was just so hungry that I actually ate so much of it, but every bite was absolutely so good. I would definitely come back here when in the area and craving Thai food. They even had larb I saw on the menu, which was pretty impressive. The staff is also really nice here too as they let us take our time and greeted us in a very friendly manner.", "author": "Julie L."}

The portion size was generous considering SF standards. It also wasn't too expensive (there are other Thai restaurants in SF that are significantly pricier than Ploy II that don't taste nearly as good). They put just the right amount of sauce and gave quite a bit of chicken with the pad thai. I will be coming back again to try some of their other dishes.", "author": "Lynn T."}

We didn't realize how hungry we were, but knew we wanted the Tom Yum Kha, Pad See Ew, and read that the Mango Panang Curry was a popular choice. \n\nAll three dishes were a little bit too sweet for my taste. My friend and I tend to like things a little spicier as well. I asked the server if the pad see ew could be made spicy and he said yeah. When the dish came out, it was just topped with red pepper flakes, which honestly I could've done myself. The servers were alright and polite, but could've been more descriptive.

Every single thing people ordered looked good, there was a fair amount of creeping happening in the name of Yelp research. \n\nThe menu is extensive and the service is quick and friendly.

After about 10 minutes the waitress came by to take our order: pad see ew with chicken & vege pumpkin curry with brown rice. \n\nThe food came out very quickly. The noodles were the first to come. They were brown and oily. There was nothing to this dish except noodles and chicken. There were no carrots, no onions, just terrible, definitely one of the worst noodle dishes We've  ever had to pay for San Francisco. \n\nThe pumpkin curry wasn't any better. Pumpkin curry was made from a yellow curry paste lacking flavor with the strong taste of Tumeric. Vegetables: boiled onions pumpkin carrots cabbage broccoli. They were literally just boiled and placed on top of the curry. I mean how hard is it to use a spoon and stir the vegetables into the curry? \nOK fine so the vegetables weren't stirred into the curry and the noodles were oily and brown but it was food right? It's nothing a little bit of hot sauce can't fix. \n\nWe asked for hot sauce, waited five minutes, then the waitress brought hot sauce to the table of diners next to us. They looked puzzled, they didn't ask for hot sauce. We asked another waitress she disappeared into an abyss and never returned. 15 minutes later we asked third waitress, two minutes went by and our fellow, diner sitting next to us passed their hot sauce onto our table. \nThen a waitress appeared with a container filled with chili paste. She made the assumption that one of the other waitresses brought us hot sauce but in fact it was our neighbor diners hot sauce. \n\nAll in all a very lousy experience. It's too bad we wasted a Friday night dinner at this terrible restaurant. The waitstaff is only interested in gossiping at the back near the kitchen. The food is no good.

We spent a lot of time in San Fran, mainly because they had never seen SF before.\n\nFor dinner, we tried Ploy II. The specials looked great, I wanted to order more but I went for the Red Curry with a side of white rice. It was really good, it was spicy enough but in my opinion could of been a little more spicy. I like more of a kick on some things. One of my friends also got the red curry. The other got the Mango Panang Curry, which was also very delicious. It had the right amount of sweet and nicely sliced chunks of mango. We also had some Thai beers, I wasn't feeling those too much. Tasted like Coors, but if you like that then you'll have no problem.\n\nHowever, the service was poor. Staff was very inattentive. My friends ordered beers and when the waitress came back she didn't bother to ask me if I wanted anything. I had to ask for a straw for my water, twice. Received our food, and curry sauce got spilled on my friends iPhone by the waitress. It was an accident but don't think she bothered to notice. Didn't really come around to our table much after that. It was also really cold inside. Windows might have been open or maybe it was the draft from the door wide open downstairs. Bring a jacket!", "author": "Jolene B."}

I had been meaning to come here ever since I got here, but it's a little bit out of my way along Haight street so it never happened.\n\nAnyway, after being repeatedly disappointed by the weird/lacking flavors in Pad Thai from every Thai place I've tried here (Soi Gow, Best of Thai Noodle, Tawan's Thai, King of Thai Noodle), I decided Pad Thai wasn't the entree to try at Ploy II out of sheer conditioning although normally that's my basis to judge a Thai restaurant.\n\nInstead, I ordered Pad Kee Mao with chicken and fresh spring rolls to go. Pad Kee Mao was very flavorful and just spicy enough, but I did need to add a little bit of soy sauce to it because it was lacking some... sodium, for lack of a better word. I'm really not one to ever add salty ingredients on my food, so that was a novel moment for me. So all in all, Pad Kee Mao was decent, but I probably would not get it again, and may zero in on the Pad Thai next time. Oh, but the star of the meal were the fresh spring rolls, which I totally was not expecting! Usually they're made with shrimp and these ones were vegetarian so I had my doubts, but it was so flavorful and the sauce it came with, a blend of fish sauce (I think) and peanut sauce, definitely completed the meal.

That's awesome. Except its not based in reality.  \n\n40 minutes pass...well I guess I should call in make sure I gave them the right address. \"It's on the way.\" Cool, no worries. Things happen, people like Thai food, place gets busy, I get it. \n\n1 hour 20 minutes pass...call back again make sure their delivery person is not stuck in walking-down-Haight-street traffic. They assure me, \"it's on the way.\" Like is it physically 'on the way?' or is it 'on the way' the way that retirement is 'on the way' for me in like 50 years. I can pick it up. I will put pants on at this point. Hungry. \"No, its not here, it's on the way.\" Okay, well.\n\n1 hour 45 minutes...now I'll just call back because I miss our conversations. Hi, it's me again. What's that? You want my phone number and address again. Why? Don't act like you don't know me. We are besties. What's that, you say, my food is 'on the way...' okay..do you happen to know where Ploy I is? Perhaps I should call home base and see if they can deliver Shrimp Pad Thai 4 blocks in under 2 hours.  If it's 'on the way' then your delivery man must be at Milk Bar drinking toddys with the boys. \n\nTen minutes later...I call...\"We are closed\"....No, Wait! It's me! How have you been? \"It's on the way\" hangup.....\n\nFinally, after another ten minutes passess, a really nice girl comes to the door with our food, she asks if we have already ate, which is sorta funny actually. She was apologetic. And also I realized she was a server that we had when we came in to eat a couple times before. \n\nAs for dinning-in, there seems to be a problem with understaffing. I waited 25 minutes for a drink one time, now that I think about it, it's possible our server took the order, then left to deliver some food that was already an hour-and-a-half late. \n\nI want to like this place a lot. It's quite yummy. But if you are going to tell some one 15 minutes, be honest with yourself.

The food was fine, albeit unspectacular and we chalked up the bad service to an off night. \n\nTonight (Tuesday night at 8 pm), we ordered take-out and it was an even bigger fiasco. We placed our order at 8 pm and they told us our food would be ready in 20 minutes. When we arrived, the host ignored us again. Eventually, we got their attention long enough to pay (they managed to get that part right), but no one came out with our food. 10 minutes passed and no one came out at all. When the host came out, she said our food would be right out. 10 minutes later, same thing. After 45 minutes, we learned that THEY HADN'T GIVEN OUR ORDER TO THE KITCHEN. No apologies even though it's almost 9 pm and we are STARVING. After an hour dealing with these dum dums, we finally got our food. \n\nThe service at Ploy II is crappy and the food is alright. There are so many alternatives in the neighborhood and it's just not worth dealing with disorganized, apathetic people.", "author": "Ben N."}

They must use some sort of peanut oil to stir fry... because it smelled delicious.  I definitely recommend it.

It's a little hidden on Haight, located upstairs in a what  probably used to be a flat. \n\nFor a weeknight at 9pm, the place was PACKED. We didn't have to wait too long to be seated, but the tables are pretty cramped together. I usually don't mind the tight seating in restaurants. As long as the food and service is good then I can deal with a little crowding. \n\nThe service was pretty slow. We asked for water, but they seemed too busy with the other 5-6 tables. We asked for water again, but it also took a while for them to bring it to us. The waiter didn't check up on our table to see if we were ready to order either. We had to patiently wait, and then ask her to come over. We ordered Eggplant Curry and a Papaya Salad. Both of which were pretty good. I liked the aroma of the curry, because I can definitely taste the distinct spices and flavoring. The proportions were a little small, however. \n\nI realize the place was pretty packed, but I would've enjoyed the experience more if they paid equal attention to every table.

The service was good, but we wanted to order an appetizer and soup to start and then keep the menus and still decide if we wanted anything more. Apparently this is atypical and confusing for the waitstaff, as every few minutes someone would come over and try to get us to order. We were not looking through the menus, they were just stacked on the side of the table. We had already explained to several people already that we were OK for now but may order additionally after the appetizer/soup, but we just gave in and said we were done ordering. If we were still hungry, we'd go somewhere else.\n\nGot a bowl of Tom Yum with Chicken. On the menu it said this would \"Serves 2-3 Persons\" and the waitress confirmed that one bowl would be enough to split between the two of us. (NOTE: This is the reason we wanted to hold onto the menus, in case the Tom Yum was not enough for both of us) \n\n\"Serves 2-3 people\" might make sense with some explanation, which was not provided. It came out and was definitely *NOT* enough even for just 2 people for a meal. It could serve 2-3 people as an appetizer, in that they would each have a small cup of soup. Anyhow, it was good soup. Also got some fresh spring rolls as well. The food was quite good, just difficult to understand portions so we essentially just ate 2 appetizers when we thought we'd be getting a full meal. Unfortunately, this was not communicated by the server effectively, and being constantly harassed about still having menus lead us to having a skimped meal and venturing elsewhere to satiate ourselves.\n\nAll in all, good food.

And I love thai food. Back in the day, the mama who worked here was a wonderful loving woman. She knew me as a teenager, wacthed as I grew up, got married and had a baby. She fed us excellent food and would have never tolerated anything less.\n\nWithin the past 2 years, the service has gone downhill big time. I live in the Richmond and call for delivery. And have had a lot of problems with their service. Once they took over 3 hours to deliver, and then after I had already cancelled my order, they still came with ice cold food and insisted I take it and sign. I refused and got a call back from sove man yelling at me that he cannot cancel my credit card so I have to take the food. The next day I found they had charged my card 3 times (accidently?!)  and it took several days before they all dropped off.\n\nI didn't eat there for a year, but the cravings got the best of me and I tried it again. No real problems but the food is not as high quality as it was before. Then, one night I ordered and they said my credit card was denied. I had no other form of payment, and even called the bank to see what was going on. The bank said they were running it as a debit card, and it was a credit card so they were denying it/ I tried to talk to the manager and she hung up on me! I called back and she hung up again!\n\nSo I am now in search of another thai place in SF that sells their yummy Thai Corn Cakes and Silver Noodles with mixed veggies. \n\nI'll probably end up caving and ordering again someday. But it has never been the same quality as it was in the 1990s. \n\nAnd if you eat there, it's upstairs in an old victorian house on Haight St. Beautiful place, and if you're lucky you can get a seat at the window to people watch.

(which is often!) I had just spent hours on end enacting the role as a tour guide, and scouring through Amoeba for music before coming to dinner, so we were starving for something hearty. \n\nThe outside of this place is VERY understated, one could easily walk by without noticing it if the proper precautions weren't taken to look out for the dinky sign. The interior of Ploy II looks like a Thai temple threw up in the mouth of a painted Victorian Lady. The restaurant itself is situated near the Golden Gate Park side of Haight-Ashbury on the very top level.  Upon entering the front door at the lower level, you are confronted with an immediate flight of stairs, which creates little intimate nooks and pocketed places within the restaurant as the tables flow around the circumference of the circular donut-shape of the restaurant. At first glance it feels like you just stepped into someone's home restaurant, but it is bigger than it looks. The heavily decorated interior is rather charming: coffered walls & ceilings, to all the playfully hilarious hand-made signage. Some notable ones included; \"we accept the right to refuse service to anyone,\" to \"you will be escorted off the premises if you start experiencing an allergic reaction\" (just kidding -it actually didn't say that but I could honestly infer that's pretty much what was meant)\n \nThe waitresses are all dressed in traditional Thai-style shuttle woven brocade dresses, and scurry around with much efficiency.\n\nReally fresh spring rolls, and my green coconut pumpkin curry was mild in spice, and a medley of warm savory-ness, without skimping out on any of the calamari, prawns, and mussels. I had a friend visiting from Australia, and he had the exact same dish except with chicken and more spicy (red curry) and he seemed to also enjoy his meal. \n\nPerhaps I underrate Thai places, because growing up with these flavors from my mother/ grandmother's home cooking has given me a critical tongue. Otherwise, I would gladly come back to this place.", "author": "Ty T."}

Essentially you are. They've reconstructed an old victorian and transformed it into a solid Thai restaurant.\n\nWe only had a five minute wait and they seated us right by the window so we could see all of the random Haight drama while we dined. I ordered the cashew tofu, and finished each bite.  Messily spooning the sauce onto my rice, well after all of the tofu and veggies were gone. The cashews cooked within a spicy chili sweet sauce and lightly fried tofu and fresh vegetables were superb. With rice for everyone and even an appetizer, we were wowed, when the total for each person came out to be about 10 dollars per person (including tip!)\n\nOne of the best Thai spots in the Haight. The menu is extensive and everything tastes  - just made. I'd highly recommend browsing through some of the regular patron yelp reviews before going though.

It's a nice retreat from the hippied-out streets of Haight-Ashbury, and a homey way to enjoy the comforts of Thai cuisine.\n\nThe food is definitely a step up from King of Thai or Best of Thai Noodle down the street (ick, that place's pad thai makes me nauseous). If I'd write home about anything, it would be their lemon chicken which we always traditionally get only at this place, though I've never tried it at any other Thai restaurants.

Whaaaaaaat?  What part of *too sweet* requires added sugar?  Also, Thai Iced tea is typically black tea with coconut milk added for sweetness, NOT pre-sweetened  tea with coconut milk.\n\nSo my partner is vegetarian, and last time we ordered, he got the Veggie Panang, which I tried and LOVED.  Great mix of curry/sweet and of course, full of veggies and tofu.\nThis time I decided to order that, but with beef, and instead of getting veggie panang with beef, I literally got 8 slices of beef and curry, with not a SINGLE PIECE OF VEGETABLE in it--a huge scoop of white rice, curry and meat and NOTHING ELSE ( no onions, nothing!).\nCome on now...are veggies really that expensive?  It's not like people who chose to eat meat have chosen NOT to eat vegetables.\n\nLast time I got the Pad See Ew and it was the same thing.

Ploy II serves up some really good comfort food in the Haight Ashbury, especially during an extra cold San Francisco night. \n\nPlus Ploy II also satisfies the inconspicuous requirement, as it is located upstairs. Once you enter the restaurant, you feel right at home as the waitresses (dressed in Thai clothing) are warm and friendly. \n\nIn terms of food, you can't go wrong with curry. I always go with the red curry because I like mine spicy. This is definitely not Thai spicy, only American spicy (if you need that extra kick be sure to speak up). I've tried the roasted duck curry, chicken curry, and seafood curry. All are good choices, but my favorite is definitely the roasted duck curry. I usually get the curry plus the Thai fried rice. It is the perfect combination, you can also get just plain white rice or brown rice if you choose. \n\nIf I dine in I really like the fried pumpkin as an appetizer. The batter is not too heavy and the pumpkin is really sweet. Imagine a really a big sweet potato fry. Plus it comes with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. \n\nAlso If I dine in, I like to get the Thai iced tea or the fresh coconut juice.

We do stray from time to time and venture into the other items on the menu - and they always deliver - the food is pact with awesome flavors and comes in generous portion enough for family-style dining.\n\nTo top off this mind-blowing dining experience - the staff and owner - Soon Yee treats us like family  - so It really feels like thai-style comfort food made in grandma's kitchen.", "author": "Michelle B."}

My friend had Phad Thai and it was great despite the shortage of noodles and overabundance of bean sprouts to cover the plate.\nThai iced tea was just okay and the cucumber salad barely had cucumbers in it. The place is not the cleanest. Years of dust build-up on the light fixtures, etc.\nThe prices are right for what you get- it's cheap.

I called to inform them and ask for my correct order to be brought.\n\nStrike 3: Second round of delivery took 30 more  hungry minutes to arrive. The food was totally cold and get this... the order was incomplete! Still wrong.\n\nYou're out: When I called to inform them again of the missing items and request a refund, they wouldn't give me a refund because I paid with my credit card. So another 30 minutes later after finishing my cold meal, the door bell rings and I open the door to see their driver literally running back to his car while he has left the bag of delivered goods tied to the door handle.

Even though they're four blocks from my house, I usually get delivery- and that's not just because I'm a lazy ass.

An okay option if you get there no later than 6:30 and don't have to be anywhere for a while.\n\nMy favorite dishes are the Imperial Egg Rolls (fried, of course), the Pad Thai (widely regarded as the best EVER), and the Panang Curry.  I've tried several other dishes but these are my mainstays.  Basically anything you order is going to be grubalicious.", "author": "Ellen L."}

The ambiance was fine, but very cramped and the decor cluttered.\n\nThe food kinda sucked. I mean, nothing tasted BAD, and it was still better than a lot of food out there. But compared to pretty much all the other sit-down Thai restaurants I've been to in the Bay Area, this was pretty weak.\n\nWe got the vegetarian tom kha. Presumably this would be normal tom kha (delicious tangy coconut milk broth, mushrooms, cilantro, lemongrass, onions) with tofu instead of chicken, but what we got was basically VEGETABLES OMG VEGETABLES with a little soup. Broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, etc. Don't get me wrong, I like vegetables, but that's not what I wanted when I ordered the tom kha. There was a bit of tofu in it--though it was the fried kind, which isn't my favorite. The broth was completely bland compared to the other tom kha I've eaten. Also, rather than being creamy and smooth, it appeared to be a bunch of little coagulated chunks of...coconut milk? I don't know. But whatever it was, it was totally not appealing.\n\nWe also ordered the tofu yellow curry. Again, PURE VEGETABLES. When I get yellow curry I expect tofu, potatoes, carrots, onions, maybe some peppers, and a lot of yellow curry sauce. Nope, not here. Barely any potatoes (my favorite!), barely any tofu. The sauce--what little there was--was more orange than yellow, and nothing to write home about.\n\nWe also got the chicken fried rice, and some sort of sweet garlicky tofu thing. They were alright. Nothing terribly exciting. There wasn't very much chicken in the chicken fried rice. I will say that the garlicky tofu thing was pretty tasty and had the proper protein to vegetable ratio (unlike the curry and the soup), but at that point we were so discouraged with everything else that it didn't really make a difference.\n\nSo yeah, not going back there. There are a billion Thai places in the Bay Area--why waste time with a mediocre one?", "author": "Heather H."}

Actually, i regretted getting the red curry only because my dining companion got the mango panang curry with prawns.  Out of this world and tempts me to avoid any other Thai place ever again.  \n\nThe mango in the mango panang curry is a sweeter take on potatoes or pumpkin, and it works out.  I don't even like prawns that much, but in this spicy sweet and savory sauce with mangos that almost melt in your mouth, it's amazing.  \n\nMasaman chicken comes like none I've ever tried before.  The sauce is a little less thick and it tastes of kefir and lemongrass.  Fantastic, but different.  \n\nSweet and sour tofu, not so much good.  Haven't tried the pad Thai yet, but may just give up a night of panang....who am I kidding?  I'll never give up my favorite dish from here!\n\nService is always prompt and friendly, even when they are busy, and it's atmosphere is something different, too.  You're in a second floor apartment, and they just put some extra tables in the living room.  Just pretend it's a family reunion and you all gathered at your uncle Charlie's place in the city and he has just enough room for you.

The atmosphere, feels like you are eating in someones living room which is unique. The wait staff seriously risks life and limb each time they bring out a dish, as there is nearly no room between the wait room and the stairwell and they come flying through there traveling from the kitchen to the dining room. \n\nThat may have attributed to this being one of the longest meals I've ever had...got there at 8 & left at 10:30! This was because service is pretty disorganized for the most part. Each dish was brought out 1 at a time, so we were somewhat forced to eat 4 apps and 4 mains family-style. They seemed to not enjoy picking up finished plates either, as each time they would just try to cram the new dish into the middle of the mess and ignore the stack of dishes that was steadily growing until we spoke up and made them take it away. \n\nThere were a few good standouts in the beef salad and the pumpkin curry, but most were typical thai dishes that you can find equal to this at any other thai resturant.", "author": "Nick V."}

I never knew it existed until my friend came into town and wanted to grab thai food in the Haight.  I couldn't remember ever seeing a thai place on Haight street.  The reason I never noticed is because it is tucked away on the second floor of an old Victorian.  The restaurant is quaint and transports you back in time.  \n\nWe had a great dinner of pad thai and panang curry.  The pad thai was really good!  Lots of veggies, delicious, tender chicken, and just the right amount of sauce.  The curry was also delicious.  We asked for it mild (spicy food gives my friend the hiccups) but it was still spicy.  She definitely was hicupping.  The curry was very flavorful with that perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  \n\nThe portions were generous and the price was right.

Whatever is inside them- some vegetable or mushroom- tastes great with sweet and sour sauce drizzled over it.\n\nThe Mango-Prawn Panang Curry is something to behold. It's chock-full of prawns and huge chunks of hot mango. It is the best Panang Curry I know of in the city and the special, off-menu choice of mango and prawns makes it a unique dish in a city filled with options.\n\nOther menu options I have tried have also been delicious: the Tom Yum soup is a classic, and the Pad Thai is as good as any.\n\nThis place is my comfort food haven.

I'd definitely say its one of the top dinning choices in the entire neighborhood. I don't know if it's just me, but I typically find a lot of haight street eateries to have a sort of dirty feel to them...well Ploy II is a real exception to that.\n\nI love how the restaurant is situated in the top floor of an old victorian, over looking the street below. It's so charming and quaint! You don't see many thai restaurants quite like it, just based on atmosphere alone. But the food is also exceptional...the pad thai is delicious! Some of the best pad thai I've ever had, actually, I would say. Full of flavor and perfectly balanced. \n\nI've also tried a few of their appetizers, which I was less fond of, namely the fried pumpkin (too heavy!). I don't remember loving the fried banana, either, but I do think that a lot of the main courses are really outstanding!", "author": "Shannon R."}

I ordered two of the exact same dishes to make it interesting. The rundown:\n\nRound 1: Veggie Tom Yum \n\nGood size serving, plenty for two. Lots of veggies. However, tom yum is supposed to be lime-y, lemongrass-y, and spice-y. This was none of that. It was a sweet liquid with veggies in it. Bummer dish.\n\nWinner: Marnee, hands down\n\nRound 2: Corn cakes\n\nFirst of all, about 30 min passed before they realized we had ordered more than just the soup. The service was WAY off. To make matters worse, the cakes had clearly been par-fried in advance and re-fried upon our order. I immediately wondered when they were originally fried. My guess is last Tuesday. Then, since they had forgotten about us, we had the additional pleasure of eating lukewarm-heat lamped-twice-fried dry, overcooked corn cakes. BLECH. It is fucking hard to ruin fried corn.\n\nWinner: Marnee, for knowing how to deep fry shit\n\n3rd dish: Mushroom Salad\n\nHigh hopes, low flavor. It was fine. Especially compared to the other messes. \n\n4th dish: Veggies and tofu in peanut sauce\n\nAgain with the sweetness? It is not my weakness - in THAI food!!! Blech. Terrible excuse for peanut sauce. It's like the cook here doesn't use any spices other than sugar.\n\nThe whole visit was a disappointment - the service was indifferent to bad. They suggested how to pace our dishes, we agreed, but then the dropped off soup for 30 minutes and crowded the table with our 3 dishes all at once. Not that we actually wanted to eat any of them anyway.\n\nI'm glad I tried Ploy, after all the hype, but now I'm annoyed with the money we spent and my lingering craving for *good* Thai food.\n\nI hate feeling like we should have just stayed home and eaten popcorn.", "author": "Shal J."}

The Tom Kha was terrible and another *long* wait.  \n\nTonight I called in an order to pick up - my usual cold remedy: vegetables with silver noodles and tom kha prawn soup (don't remember the Thai word for prawns).  I was told my order would be ready for pick up in 10 minutes.  I arrived about 20 minutes later and then waited 15 minutes more until my order was ready. \n\nWhen I got home the first thing I opened was the soup, which by the way is not inexpensive at $8.95.  I have had tom kha soups from at least 30 establishments, including many in Thailand, and feel I have tried it all when it comes to this dish!  Ploy 2's has always been satisfactory (not great), but tonight it was unlike anything I've had before.  It had little chunks of what looked like curdled milk in it - I mean throughout the entire thing . . . something off with the coconut milk?  Something wrong with the temperature/cooking? I don't know, but I am amazed they actually let me take it home with me!!!  There's no way they couldn't have noticed.  The texture and appearance were so awful I couldn't eat it - even though the taste was okay.\n\nI've been ordering food from Ploy 2 for about 5 years.  Generally the food is better than average, but I think I've kept going back, despite the fact that it takes anywhere from 50-90 minutes for food to be delivered, because the place is so damn cute and authentic.  But, there really is better food elsewhere - where the coconut milk isn't curdled and you don't have to wait so long for your order.

Thai is my favourite kind of food, so treating myself to a meal at Ploy was always going to make me happy, because the food was always delicious. The restaurant itself is in an old Edwardian house, so the atmosphere was lovely. Nice for first dates or big parties, and yes, I've had both there.\n\n\n My favourite place to eat their food, though, was in the comfort of my own home, luckily just down the street, so it was always nice and hot. One of my closest friends and I would order as much as we could carry and scurry home, and indulge in a meal where there was never much uttered other than the occasional mmmmm, or oh, this is SOOOO good! : )", "author": "Laurelei"}

One of the best Thai places in San Francisco! \nWe ordered vegetarian Tom Kha, chicken Larb, mixed sauteed seafood, and a side of steamed rice. \nThe soup is yummy - nice and rich, with veggies and pieces of fried tofu - and  with a pouch of sweetness from coconut milk ^_^ .\nLarb is an absolute must-try. It's a meat salad made with ground chicken and mint. Yep, the secret ingredient is the mint, um-num-num.\nThe star of our dinner that the mixed  seafood plate. Best of the best. Sauteed calamari rings, octopus, pieces of with fish, and shrimp. Served with salad. I loved this from my first bite.

The chicken satay was good after I assembled the chicken, the sauce, the scallions, and the cucumber.  The fried chicken wings were good, but honestly how can fried chicken ever be bad?

I called them to have them bring the forgotten drink and they told me 45 minutes. Seriously? After arguing with her that I am only a few blocks away and my dinner would be long cold after 45 min, they brought me the drink. However they tried to get me to pay for it AGAIN.

I told him there was no hurry since I was commuting from downtown.  I \"assumed\" the food would be ready when I arrived 45 min later.  Nope, they had not even bothered to start it.  Not happy, but I let that one go.  \n\nA few weeks ago, I ordered food on a Saturday night at 8 pm and was told that it would be 45-50 min for delivery.  That was fine and sounded right for a Saturday night as I knew they were probably busy.  An hour later, at 9:00 pm I called. They had not even started my food and told told me it would be another 30 min.  I was very angry and said that was unacceptable.  I asked to speak to the manager and yelled at her for the delay.  I asked her why the guy told me 45-50 min if it was going to be longer.  Why could they not be honest or call me and tell me of the delay?  All she could say was that I could cancel my order if I wanted and that they were very busy. I raised enough of a ruckus that she assured me that my food would be there in 15 min.

The service is amateurish, but friendly.\n\nOn the negative side, the food is really, truly mediocre.  The wait staff is Chinese, and I'll guess the kitchen is as well, as most of the foods on the menu are entirely reminiscent of a cheap American-Chinese dive.  And the Thai specialties are just weird.  The second time I went, I saw the staff unload crates and crates of Skippy's creamy peanut butter, oddly enough.  \n\nI then had the red curry, and understood - the red curry is basically a peanut-butter sauce.

However, their kitchen is small and ill equipped to handle the amount of business that they do.  They really need to expand and probably do some re-organizing/cleaning house.\n\nThey were out of thai iced tea (which tastes good).  They were out of fresh spring rolls.  We ordered vegetarian tom kha, which was okay.  Nice texture and consistency.  I prefer mine a bit more sour and a bit more sweet a bit more salty but all in all the taste was decent and creamy.  We also ordered vegetarian pad see ew.  Again, the taste was actually good, smokey and the tofu was nicely done but I think they must've run out of ingredients because there was no egg (: ( ) and they had used the pad thai noodles rather than the flat, thick, chewy ones I'm used to.\n\nI'd say the food gets around 3 stars.  The ambiance also gets 3 as well.  The people who work there are nice and the hustle and bustle of the back room takes me back to Thailand, however, the service sucks.  Do not order food for take-away.  You will be sitting and waiting A LOOOOOONG ass time.   You may get your food faster getting it delivered from Bangkok.  Yeah.  Serious.", "author": "erin k."}

Possibly because I was so freaken hungry I did not noticed this and expected to be served an entree portion as I was not aware that during lunch they ONLY serve the lunch special.  When the small portion of food arrived we complained that it was not what we ordered and that we expected the entree size.  The lady said it was lunch time and that they only served lunch specials and that an entree had to be specifically asked for.  I thought we were asking for it... but accepted the meager portion as it was as we obviously were not getting what we wanted.  We had ordered crab fried rice and beef param.  I was very disappointed with the portion size and the quality.  The soup is visually unappealing consisting of just water, boiled vegetables, and carried a pungent aroma.  The beef was tough and spinach tasted like a freezer.  We ate both dishes and wished we had eaten at McDonalds instead as we were not as full as we would have liked.

It was mildly spicy (I really like my spicy!!!), had good flavor, and the pumpkin was really yummy!  I did get annoyed, though, because the waitress wasn't helpful.  We asked for silverware/plating (there weren't enough places set), water, and chili sauce, and we didn't get anything/took forever.  She just ignored me!  Also, they kept giving us plates with food, but took forever to take the empty plates (and our table was small!).   I'm not sure if the service wasn't too great because of a language barrier.

I was living in the Haight with my best girlfriends (fellow Yelpers Diana S. and Linsey P.) and Ploy II was the go-to joint for Thai. Not all Thai, actually. Just Panang curry. Chicken, to be exact, and you had to ask for added bamboo shoots, because that was just the secret recipe for happiness. Warm, coconutty, spicy, delicious happiness. I turned Diana onto it and there began a period of time Linsey refers to as our \"Panang Days\". We were so addicted, between the two of us there was rarely a night without Panang or leftover Panang in the house. (The portion is quite large, almost enough for two full dinners.) Linsey would come home, smell the Panang from the hallway outside the front door, and groan, \"AGAIN???\" We would merely shrug, sniffle from the spicy nose-run, and dig in. What could we say? We were addicted. Try it at your own risk! But don't forget the bamboo shoots.", "author": "Madie S."}

When ordering my food the woman there are rude, I realize that it is busy however, you do not have to be rude I am giving you business. So after the food arrived I opened up there yellow curry and the thing was covered in zuccini when I called them to see if something could be done about this considering on there online menu it does not say that there are zuccini in there yellow curry I was pissed. They told me that it was not there problem and to not eat it. Duh I am allergic to it. I feel that if you can be somewhat understanding of food allergies then maybe you should not own a business.

The food was always decent, except for the obviously freezer-burned tofu. But the price was right so I kept coming back. Then the other night, after not having gone ein a couple years I brought a friend there for dinner. We ordered our food, it came fairly promptly, and we started eating. I had ordered the spicy fried tofu, and my friend ordered the fried chicken wings. After a couple bites I noticed the tofu had an eery chicken taste. Since my friend had ordered chicken I figured they must have fried them together...being a vegan I havent had chicken in years so i had my friend taste it to make sure I wasnt imagining things. She agreed, it tasted like chicken...it even had the same sauce as hers! So I asked the waiter about it...she at first said there was no chicken, then after I grilled her longer she admitted it was cooked together...when an older guy (i think her boss) said there was definitely no chicken in it. Suspecting they were lying I raised the stakes by telling them Im extremely allergic to chicken and if I ate it Id get very ill. Thats when the truth came out....they WERE cooked together! Then the guy tried to make light of it, and acted very rude and patronizing to me, not taking me seriously at all. At that point I decided I had had enough, told him off, and that I thought it was pretty messed up they would call something vegetarian, cook it with meat, then lie about it...and THEN tell me that they thought I wasnt *that serious* about being vegetarian! (this is also after I had double checked to make sure they didnt put fish sauce in the tom kha!) So, if you dont mind restaurant staff that lies to you, or a place that looks like they havent cleaned the floor in about a decade, then go to ploy thai 2!
