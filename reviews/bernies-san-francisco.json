I used to work next door and went to Bernie's maybe 20 times total.  I always order that same thing and the SAME girl always took my order.  Each time my beverage was a different price. I always ordered the exact same thing!  This girl tried to be friendly a few times and I told her i was married. Then she started charging me more. I always pay with cash and I get the feeling this girl is just pocketing the money.  Go to Starbucks instead it's right down the street.", "author": "Justin N."}

The mocha was just okay, and the black iced tea was delicious so I give the drink review a 5 just because it was only meh. A cute place, but not a place I would write home about!!

The honey hazelnut latte is actually pretty good. I didn't note any honey (as I'd requested it \"not too sweet\"), but the hazelnut was definitely there, and pretty tasty.\n\nService was fine, the quiche was the best thing there (Italian wedding cookie: meh, peach scone: eh), especially with a hefty squirt of Sriracha, and the prices were fair.", "author": "Adena B."}

This may seem obsequious, but Bernadette (yeah, her given name happens to be too long for the sign out front) is now pronounced by me to be one of San Francisco's royalty.  An order, for the first time, proffered by me in a most Yelperific fashion!  Go 'head, Queen Bernie.  I love what you're bringin', girlfriend!\n\nIt's really Bernadette's story to tell, I just happen to be sharing my side of it.  Way back in the last millennium, ('twas 1994), I was but a novice SF'ian, a former wanna-be now turned on by a his new, joy-filled reality...and in my new nabe of Noe, there was my fave java dispensary, Spinelli's...  I pause after I say the name, because it was a holy spot to me.  My favorite, I told you that already...\n\nNow it's 2008...\n\nGreat beans, great coffee.  It's that simple, but there's something more...a brain behind it.  It belongs to our local Fly Girl, Bernie. \n\nShe's warm-hearted, deep and fancy-free, the warm, personable Ms. Bernie.  I strolled in for the first time with the g'f and Bernadette offered us free pastry.  It was delicious, that lemon square, so sweet and tart...and the price was right.\n\nI was happy to have been drawn in by the classy, classic sign bearing her name - not to mention the cool colors and warm woods somehow assuring me that I was in for tasty, great coffee.  And yes, there was reverie, more than a distant memory, as I approached the counter, I remembered dreams and fantasies of mine that had flown through Spinelli's.

There's a little section for kids with a chalkboard and scribbly drawings from kids with java-addicted parents who make them hang out in Bernie's.  There are always at least 2-3 dogs outside, at least one of which has the look that it's been abandoned because its owner (excuse me, it's \"human companion\") left them outside for 5 whole minutes.  Everyone has some obnoxious order like a triple pump extra hot nonfat macchiato or some dumb shit like that (my large soy iced mocha, however, is by no means \"dumb shit\").\n\nBernie herself is super cool and treats both her staff and customers well.  Apparently she used to be a manager at Peet's and bought this place when they didn't renew the lease.  Smart move, Bernie.  Peet's wasn't going to survive across the street from Starbuck's, but an INDEPENDENT coffee shop was destined to thrive in Noe Valley...especially since the next-closest one is a whole block and half away.\n\nInside Bernie's you'll be treated to typical Noe conversations by pretentious do-gooders who speak loudly specifically because they want you to overhear them talk about mortgage rates, their child's grade school honors classes, their sex change operation and/or hormone therapy, etc.  You'll also see lots of Red Sox hats and heather socks with sandals, further proving my theory that Noe is a refugee camp for New England transplants.  You'll probably also see a newly transplanted New Englander talking about what a wonderfully open-minded city San Francisco is, clearly not yet jaded by the sad reality that we're all close-minded liberals.\n\nWhen I was in there a couple of weeks ago I overheard said New Englanders talking about their friend (who had a very Jewish-sounding name like Sarah Silverman or something like that) who was a documentary filmmaker who used to work at WGBH (the local PBS affiliate in Boston) and just moved out here to work at Apple (got tired of low PBS documentary pay and sold out for the big bucks).  It also means that Sarah Silverman (or whatever her real name is) is most likely a lesbian.  Noe + PBS + Jewish = lesbian.  This conversation alone cemented all my Noe stereotypes.  See my review of the 24th Street Cheese Shop for further proof.\n\nOh yeah - the coffee's pretty good here, too.", "author": "Doctor L."}

I can't tell you how many times I went in there and there was huge line of people and one person working the counter making coffee and working register  while one or two other employees where hanging out in back. The payoff for me was when they only offered \"lighter\" coffee blends in the AM like Baseball Blend - yuk. When I asked the lame-o guys that worked there they said that's what customers prefer/ Huh? Have you been in SF long? Ever been to Peets? Hell even Starbucks offers and regular and darker option anytime you go in.\n\nAnyway, enough whining about the past. Bernie and here new place are great. Place is always crowded now, much better atmosphere and the coffee is a huge improvement. Love Martha's but Bernie's my coffee gal for now.", "author": "John B."}

There was a sign in the window offering a free cup of coffee.  Instantly attracting my cheap sensibilities and addiction to coffee at any hour, my friend and I walked in.  \n\nUpon entering the shop, I immediately noticed that though the furniture had not changed, the same Tully's Pitch Fork and Axe handle chairs (what was the Tully's retail merchant thinking?), the atmosphere and attitude was fresh and welcoming.  I was also excited to see a new coffee shop on 24th at Noe that would be an alternative to the acidic and burnt tasting drip Starbucks called coffee in a cookie cutter atmosphere. \n\nWe placed our order for that free cup, and then realized the woman taking our order was the new owner.  The sign wasn't yet hung outside, so the name of the shop was unclear.  When we asked the owner what she was going to call it, she said Bernie's, her name.  We walked out and wished her well, and I hoped to see this one stick.\n\nA year later, this place is my base.  I didn't come here on a regular basis after my introduction, but being recently laid off, I went to find something in my neighborhood that had free Wi-Fi, good inexpensive coffee, and a way to get out of my apartment and continue my job search.  \n\nWhat I have found at Bernie's is Bernie, the community, and a neighborhood.  Yes, the average age at times seems to be 60, given the infants and toddlers, mimicking the Noe Valley demographic, but it is unpretentious, hipster free, and you can get a cup of coffee, sit on your lap top, and get free refills with a smile.  Bernie is ubiquitous in the shop.  She greets each patron as a regular, and jokes as if she has known them forever.  I now come here just about everyday, sit for hours on the Internet, and look forward to Bernie treating me like a neighbor, not a dollar. \n\nThank you Bernie; I wish you continued success.", "author": "Lander B."}

She is super sweet and hilarious, and she is so passionate about her coffee shop. From the beginning I see her interacting with her staff as well as her customers, and she genuinely loves each of them. It really surprised me how well she knows her customers, she would ask them about their day, and what they have been up to, she even knew some of their drink orders already, I'm guessing it's because they are regulars. But you can't get that kind of customer service at Starbucks where you're just another face in the crowd. \n\nHer coffee is really good too as well as the baked goods she has out! I've sadly only been there twice because of where I live, but if I lived in SF, I would totally be a regular. Every time I visit, I always want to go there. Two times and the coffee did not disappoint, and I love my coffee!\n\nThe decor is so cozy and cute. Like someone else said, you feel like in your best friend's living room.

It is a perfect mix of homey and a little escape from the otherwise hectic life in the city. The serene colored walls, mixed with the white molding, dark wood furniture and counter, and track lighting blend perfectly. The staff is friendly, and there are plenty of tables and chairs to settle into. There is even a kids corner with a chalkboard door they can write on and plenty of books and coloring tools available.\n\nMy only areas of suggestion for this cafe are:\n1. Having more and bigger art on the walls would really contribute to a unique, warming environment. There are a few small black and white pictures up, which is nice, but some interesting art would really add to the place.\n\n2. The counter is a bit crowded on one end with regular store bought items: canisters of tea, coffee filers, lollipops, on top of many bottled beverages in the glass case. I love independent coffee shops for their own made items, not for selling grocery items. If they did away with all of this and scaled up their in house pastries it would feel more like a cafe and less like a grocery store.\n\nOtherwise, this place is fabulous!", "author": "Deborah Q."}

I got there when it was relatively empty, and I was at a big table with my papers spread onto 1 space next to me. There were 5 empty seats at the table so this didn't seem like a big deal. Out of nowhere some guy sits down right next to me, and is about to put his stuff down on top of my papers, glaring at me the whole time. So I move my stuff to the other side. A little while later, some women show up and do the exact same thing. Really, would it kill you folks to say \"excuse me\" or \"mind if I sit here?\" Then there were folks who brought their barking dogs in.
