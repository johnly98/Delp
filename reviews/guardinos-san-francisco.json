It was probably my favorite thing I ate during our West Coast vacation. \n\nMy wife and I stopped here for lunch after we visited Alcatraz earlier that morning. We worked up an appetite and when we walked by Guardino's, we knew that's where we wanted to eat. We got a 1/2 Lobster, 1/2 Dungeness Crab roll and some clam chowder in a bread bowl. The seafood was extremely fresh and flavorful. I could have ate here for every meal and I would have been perfectly happy with that!

Being that we're a party of two and the cup size was too small, we got a quart and split it, which costs $5 less than two pints!  This time, the chowder tasted better; more creaminess and was served piping hot.  Most of all, props to the lady worker who went above and beyond my request for an empty bowl so we could make a split.  She gave us two empty bowls, oyster crackers and even bagged them up for us.

Sourdough roll STUFFED with crab, mayo, and topped with claw meat.  The crab was so goood!!  That's one thing you can guarantee around the Wharf is that the seafood is totally fresh.  The only thing that bothered me was the sourdough roll, which I'm not really a fan of, it was tough for me and by the time I finished my sandwich my jaw was a little sore.  I would've preferred something like a brioche roll like I've had at Sam's and The Lobsta Truck.  But overall, it was a solid sandwich.  The price for the sandwich that day was around $18, which may seem a lot, but not too bad considering that when it's not crab season, the price can be double that.\n\nIf you're around Fisherman's Wharf during crab season, definitely check out the Guardino's Crab Stand and try their Crab Sandwich.

The lobster roll was typical lobster in bun but top was packed with lobster meat ($20). The clam chowder was excellent as well ($7). Really enjoyed both although first time I had sourdough I would prefer something else but the bread was really good in terms of chewy texture. Perfect for sopping up the clam chowder. Too bad don't live in SF or would be going to eat at Fisherman's Wharf all the time.\n\nOnly issue is finding a place to actually eat the food. We were lucky to have room right at Guardino's on their counter but if a ton of people, could be problematic.", "author": "Chris L."}

But I am very disappointed with my orders. I ordered clam chowder, lobsters claws cocktail and the lobster sandwich. \nLobster claws are fresh but quite rubbery in texture. Lobster sandwich is bad. It's like shredded lobster with some chunks of claws mixed with tons of mayo and lacks flavor. Bread is just tough. \nClam chowder so far is the best tasting of all. Not so thick nor thin in consistency and the flavor is just right. It's enjoyable to eat even when with the fairly hot weather.\nMight go back for the clam chowder.\nVendors are very delightful!", "author": "Kam V."}

The clam chowder taste was mediocre, you can taste the distinct seafood flavor, BUT when I saw them pour the soup into my bread bowl, they threw in LARGE chunks of bread in with the soup. When I found a place to sit and eat the soup, you can see the large chunks of bread that became a little smaller after soaking up the clam chowder.

If you have ever in your life had real New England Clam Chowder, you will spit this out. Or if you are really hungry, you will chalk it up to a poor choice and finish the tiny bowl not worth its price or even half of it. The consistency is way too watery, the clams (if you can find them) have to be canned and there is no attention to the actual flavor whatsoever.\n\nWhen there are four chowder spots staring you in the face and you have never even been down to Fisherman's Wharf, I guess it's easiest to just choose the first one in line. Unfortunately, that was not the best method for making the choice. They give you oyster crackers or offer it in a bread bowl for a reason - these products soak up the water in the bowl and let you enjoy the cracker or bread, thereby masking the very poor excuse for a bowl of chowder.\n\nWe saw someone getting crabs though and they looked fresh.

Maybe the fish has been sitting out for a bit, or maybe brisk business means they're continually reloading the displays with something just prepared.\n\nToday, walking past Guardino's, the lobster roll called to me. It was tasty. I think I like the crab rolls better at the various wharf stands, especially at their dramatically lower price, but I'm glad I got it, it was quite good.\n\nI suggest you only buy one food item at a time. It's easy to go back & get a second item, possibly from a different vendor. The fewer items you're carrying, the easier it is to negotiate your way through the crowds to find a place to enjoy your food. If you only have one item it's easy to hold it while eating, if you can't find counter space.\n\nThe street-facing side of the booth has a metal counter, a luxury to sit your drink down while you stuff your face with lobster & sourdough bread. Tourists & locals alike walk haltingly along Taylor Street, to look at the menus, the crabs, & to see if what you're eating looks good. Smells of fish & cool ocean breezes permeate your nostrils. The din of traffic, the MUNI street car, tourists, happy and/or screaming children, rap from boom boxes and the gold and silver painted robot-men who move mechanically to the beat, seagulls, the light carnival soundtrack emanating from Musee Mecanique, and street musicians butchering your favorite tunes all collide for your attention.\n\nEating outside amongst crowds isn't everybody's cup of tea.

It was also a pretty big serving for $8, a very reasonably sized lunch meal for me.\n\nThe chowder was good, but not spectacular. I did like that it had a lot of potato in it, but the flavor wasn't anything more than average for fresh clam chowder. $5 for a decent size cup and some crackers is pretty hard to beat and it was piping hot.\n\nHighly recommended for a quite bite of good, fresh seafood.

I am definitely picky in this regard) about their clam chowder.\n\nCanned clam chowder is almost consistently terrible, and Guardino's serves up a bowl that is not much better. Perhaps it's the economy, perhaps they're cutting costs, and it makes sense that their clam chowder is the cheapest out of all the stalls on this corner. Either way this chowder was watery and not particularly flavorful. It was also pretty sparse on the potatoes if you are into that. They did have enough clams but at this rate that is a compliment you'd only hear in recession.\n\nPro tip: Don't buy it in a bread bowl. If you really must, do yourself a favor and buy a cup of chowder and a separate bread bowl (for $2) and pour that in. The amount of chowder you get inside a bread bowl is a universal ripoff.\n\n\nTo reinforce some of the reviews mentioning how good Guardino's USED to be, I DO recall all the stands being universally better a couple years ago.

Guardino's is a perfect example of that. Conveniently located in my favorite city's fisherman's wharf. For tourists visiting the fisherman's wharf, make sure you go past the big Boudin's that boasts original San Francisco Clam Chowder, Guardino's is only a few steps away. Guardino's is the mom-and-pop compared to the Boudin's which is the big corporate gorilla. Dont get me wrong, Boudin's has good clam chowder but if you want authentic San Francisco taste go to Guardino's.\n\nThe clam chowder spells San Francisco all over it. You can either get it in a styrofome cup or in a sour dough bread bowl. From my personal experience, you can never go wrong with the sourdough bread bowl, it just authenticates the dish altogether. The calamari is not bad either, but I would skip it.\n\nThe downside of going to this small mom-and-pop is that there are no tables or chairs to eat your food. You can either go on the few public benches or by the monument thingy and have a seat. Trust me, you do not want to be eating your chowder standing up with it on one hand and the spoon in the other. It just doesn't work. \n\nBecareful of the seagulls, THEY WILL JACK YOUR FOOD RIGHT FROM YOUR HAND. I know this from personal experience. After we have devoured our chowders, my girlfriend wanted to the try the calamari, so I went across the way to get some. On my way back to the monument thingy where we were situated, a seagull came and jacked a few calamaris from my open tray. That was comedy, but beware since the bird ruined our calamari and I had to get another tray and cautiously cover it with my hand as I cross. \n\nThis place will be a definite stop for me again next time I am in the Bay Area, hell I might even move there just for the chowder! Yes, its THAT good.", "author": "jay v."}

This was the cheapest of them all this labor day weekend at $10.95 a lb. But be sure to choose the ones that were not at the bottom soaking up water (more weight ya' know). The first crab was awesome! We picked it, the guy cleaned it, opened it, and boiled it. I was brought up to like the insides of the shell ( I know many people discard it and I tell you it's a waste!!!) :D \nTheir \"Kraft\" marinara sauce was a no-go for us, it tasted odd. But crab and lemon.. YUMM!! \n\nI sent the bf down there the next morning for a crab (CRAB FOR BREAKFAST!! :D). He ordered it to-go straight up expecting that the same guy would do the same as the day before and walked off in search of calamari since this stall hadn't started making them yet. He came back to a wrapped up cold crab. It turns out that the guy hadn't boiled it or gotten rid of the gills. Maybe that's what they do when you tell them to wrap it to-go? Not sure. So this time I had a cold crab and had to open the main shell myself. No big deal I can do it myself. \nAlthough, the boiled one did taste better.", "author": "Heidi C."}

Yeah, clam chowdah is fantastic and I've never had a bad bowl of it (nor can I really taste the difference), but for this I was diggin on the sandwich. It was fresh, tasty, exactly what I had wanted, and paired with an All-Natural Mango Snapple, it was the perfect late lunch. Even the little bits of crab shell in it; it just proved that it was real crab and not shredded and dyed white fish.\n\nAnd in Fisherman's Wharf with the smell of the bay and all the cool ass boats chillin in the background, I'd gladly give up $9.50 for this little meal.", "author": "Jackie T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-07-30", "description": "Seeing how it's located right on Fisherman's Wharf, I'd have expected a much better seafood from this booth.  We got a bread bowl filled with clam chowder, and added on a cooked crab to snack on.  The crabs are available for purchase by the pound, then they cook them up quickly for you before handing you some dipping sauce and lemon to go with it.\n\nThe chowder was okay, but not great.  It tasted like a big batch of canned soup - but I suppose you can't expect too much from a small booth like that.  What turned me off from this place was the fact that the bread bowl was cut so as to really rip you off.  They removed just the top portion of bread, didn't hull it out at all, and filled it with soup so it looked like it was overflowing.  I was pretty excited with the portion until I stuck my spoon into it, and instantly hit bread.  Big disappointment.\n\nThe crab?  Old.  Come on, this is on a WHARF, how do you sell old crabs?  Might have been the fault of the fisherman, might have been the supplier, who knows?  But really, I don't go to a wharf and expect anything but the freshest of supplies.\n\nThis place is mediocre at best, from my experience.", "author": "Garrett P."}

But what also crossed my mind was: What if I went on and on about this delicious clam chowder w/ lots of potatoes and clams, and it turned out to be canned? Wouldn't I look like an IDIOT!? \n\nWell, turns out that this stuff is canned but with a few ingredients added. Just great... You could've tricked us all! But its okay, cause I still liked it! $4.88 for a small little cup, just the wharf's price. I'd prefer this clam chowder over Sabella's anyday.\n\nOne thing that really bugged me though was that the guy working there had already stuck the plastic spoon into my soup, since the majority of customers do eat it right away. I had to ask for the lid because I wanted to take it back to work instead of sit in the middle of the wharf (its not like its the nicer Embarcadero area by the Ferries). So he took out the spoon, put on the lid, placed the spoon back into the tray and asked if I wanted a bag. I said yes, so he placed that whole thing inside the bag and put a couple of pieces of napkins in there, WITH the DIPPED SPOON still there! Of course, I took it out once I got to work and there was a little mess.\n\nBut, he did acknowledge my presence when I walked by the place and asked if I wanted clam chowder w/ bread bowl.

It comes from a can...Yeah, no shit! I speak the truth!\n\nBefore they came out with their own canned chowder with their name on a label on the can, we used to used canned clam chowder from somewhere...Not sure if it was Heinz or not...But I can guarantee you it came in a can. To make it taste less canned and more homemade, we would add potato flakes and dried parsley along with some water and dry non-dairy creamer. I am not shtting you, this is the truth. But if you taste it, you would never guess it came from a can unless we told you. Not sure how it works out that way. You can tell by looking at the chunks in the soup that it's canned. I mean, the potato chunks are all uniformly cut and the clams look the same way, too. And sometimes we tend to not stir the soup enough so some of the lumps from the mash mix will still be there...That's just us being sloppy and lazy. We're also human...But people always come back for more. Glad they enjoy it.\n\nWe also sold the normal fare like half lobsters and calamari salad and shrimp and crab cocktails. But we're the only place on the block that sells souvenirs. The inside shop used to be the old Guardino's mini restaurant. This was way back in the day. Before the Great Depression time. But eventually, they decided not to do that anymore and went the way of selling crap that tourists love to buy. San Francisco keychains, notebooks, sweatshirts, jackets, fleeces, just about anything you would expect a shop that caters to tourists. We also sold sea shells and sharks teeth and some other glass trinkets. Tons of stuff and it's very profitable...When they come in to buy. A lot of the time, the inside would be empty and the girls working inside would hate that because we would grab some of them and make them help us outside. They hate the smell and hate getting smelly from the outside but that's part of the job...It's written in invisible ink on the bottom of their application when they sign it.\n\nI only worked here maybe a year before I moved down to Sabella and La Torre's. But there's no hard feelings there because it's all business. And burning bridges out here would not be good for me seeing as how close we are together on this one block of restaurants...\n\n'eyyyyyyyy. Chowder!!! Get your hot chowder here!

You need a place of great food and rest with low price. Fortunately, there is. \n I went to San Francisco with my friends last October, to spend our Fall Break vacation. I remember it was a clear day with typical California sunshine, when I had one of the most unforgettable memories in my life, eating Dungeness crabs at the Guardino Restaurant. \nAs a matter of fact, instead of calling it a restaurant, I would rather say it is a booth. It located at 296 Jefferson Street, in the most bustling area of Fisherman's Wharf. It is a common knowledge that visiting San Francisco without tasting the famous \"Dungeness Crabs\" would be a huge mistake. San Francisco crabs are the best tasting and tenderest in the world. When my friends and I passed by the restaurant, we were attracted by a glass cabinet of Dungeness crabs. The crabs were so fresh and I could almost smell the scent of the sea. Although we didn't have much money left, we decided to try the food.\n The restaurant was very small, with only three tiny tables at the roadside. There was no waiter service so we needed to order from the vender by ourselves, which is one of the reasons why it's cheaper than other restaurants. 40 dollars will feed three people. Dungeness crabs are much bigger than normal crabs. It took about 15 minutes to wait until crabs are totally cooked. The chef cut the crabs into several parts before he carried them onto our table, so that we didn't have to use the pincer to divide the crabs. They were the best crabs I have ever tasted in my life. Without any sauce, we just enjoyed the original taste of the crabs, which was very fresh and delicious. \n Not only was the food great, but so was the environment. With its sidewalk tables, the restaurant's atmosphere was that of the street: of Fisherman's Wharf. Numerous tourists passed by and greeted us, some stopping to ask, \"Hey, what are you guys eating? Is it good?\"  A short distance away from our seats, a band was playing jazz music and attracted quite a crowd. With the best crabs and best sunshine of California, the whole thing was fantastic.\n  I strongly recommend you to go to Guardino Restaurant and enjoy the most relaxing moment and the best cuisine.", "author": "haiyi w."}
