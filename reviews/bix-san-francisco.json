The earliest time they had was 9:00 PM AND they require a credit card to hold your reservation, because if you no-show, they'll charge $25 per person of the reservation. \n\nHowever, I think it's worth the dining experience here. The live Jazz sold me alone. (But I'm a sucker for live music). \n\nMy parents are really picky with their wines, so we brought two (max amount allowed per table) for a $30 corkage fee per bottle. \n\nYeah... if it's not obvious yet from this review, expect a hit on your wallet when you visit haha. \n\nI ordered the Lobster Spaghetti and it was really light and filling at the same time - recommend! The portions are small, but they know what they're doing because all of us were full by the end. \n\nI do suggest ordering an appetizer for the table to share, because with the combination of that, the bread, and my entree, I was stuffed. \n\nBix is definitely an experience to have in San Francisco. Inside, does not feel like the city anymore. It's a nice break.", "author": "Joscelynne R."}

The decor, the way the tables are laid out, how the waiter is dressed and how they speak to you. I really liked the art they had on the walls too (and there's an awesome historic map of SF in the men's bathroom!). That was the coolest part of the experience for me.\n\nMaybe you're thinking, well if the best part was the ambiance, then the food must not be good.\n\n(I amused myself by wondering what would happen if I just ended the review right there. But alas, there are no trolls to be found here :) )\n\nOverall, the food is definitely on the good side - but kind of that \"that was a pretty good meal\" versus \"holy crap, we have to come back here for the food.\" I did really enjoy my truffle burger (burgers are my weakness), but the other dishes we had were just \"good\". If I were forced to not order a burger, I would probably go with the pork chop in hindsight. Everything else we ordered definitely was smaller on the portion size. As for dessert, definitely go for the chocolate (if they have it)!\n\nSo yeah, Bix is a pretty neat concept tucked away in an alleyway in North Beach. It would definitely be interesting to try their tastings at the bar next time!", "author": "Greg G."}

The lineup changes by day, so check their website for what's being offered each night, but if you're a jazz fan like me and enjoy borderline swanky environments like this every once in a while, you won't be disappointed.\n\nReservations are generally a must here, although you can try wiggling your way into the bar. The food is certainly not going to be cheap (remember? no cover!) and is not going to rise to the level of a Michelin star, but at least the flavors, quality, and preparation are reasonably up to snuff, in tandem with the prices. The General Tso's fried chicken is indeed a nice appetizer to begin things with, while there are plenty of meaty entrees to choose from, whether the lamb porterhouse or dry aged New York strip steak. I was perfectly fine with a lobster spaghetti dish.\n\nDrinks, in particular the cocktails, are quite solid, and overall this is quite a festive, cheery venue with good service. Even as a jazz fan who's lived in the Bay Area for almost 9 years now, I only heard about it after reading former mayor Willie Brown's column in the Chronicle, and I can see why he likes a classy place like this. (In particular, if you're here to talk business or politics, you can do so without fear of being overheard, thanks to the music and other background noise.)

Right when we walked in, the ambiance of the restaurant is what I loved. It was dim, romantic, and there was also a pianist that played songs throughout dinner. We had reservations for 7 and was sat right next to the Pianist which I loved! He even played, \"Ribbon in the Sky\" as one of my favorite old school songs were. I got a Lobster pasta which was helllllllaaaa good and I also got the Truffle Cheeseburger which was yummy and had rich flavors to it!

It's been over a year and we finally got a date night together.\n\nWe had reservations for 7:00 on a Saturday night; wanted to stay long enough to hear some of the live jazz that starts at 8:30.  Valet is $15.  Totally worth it.\n\nI wasn't sure about the dress code, the website looks suit fancy.  But we ended up casual.  Jeans and a nice black shirt.  We fit in fine.  There was the other end as well, a woman dressed more like a flapper and men in fine suits.  It's a \"supper club\" - which means they serve a meal and entertainment.  There was live piano music until the jazz started.  Oh and we sat in the balcony.  Beautiful.\n\nThe pics say it all about the decor.  The place is jazzy and smooth and it makes me want to drink and eat and enjoy myself.\n\nI had the Bix Sidecar - tasty and poured at the table.  A waiter came by and delivered hot sour dough rolls.  Um.  This was enough to make me swoon.  I'm not usually this easy but the decor AND carbs were too much to bear.\nChose safe starters, meatballs and crab rolls.  Both great tastes and fine for a table of four.  Then we had the Chicken Hash, Truffle Cheese Burger, Duck, and Pork chop.  Order of personal preference from what I tasted... Chicken Hash, Duck and Burger.  I suspect the burger was my bad, I said med well. I should have asked for the chef preference.  It was a tad dry for me.  The Pork chop was gorgeous but I didn't try.  \n\nFinishing the night with the Banana's Foster was a must and I was almost willing to embarrass myself by licking the bowl.  Don't worry I didn't.

I discovered this place because my company had its holiday party here a few years ago, which was very nice. After that, I've been here about several other times since. \n\nI generally come here on Friday or Saturday nights, and they always have live jazz music playing. The place has great vibes and has an upscale/elegant feel, so definitely dress up a bit when coming here (i.e. no jeans for men). \n\nI've also been here for Valentine's day, which requires a reservation well in advance for a decent dinner time. The menu was pre-set but you did each get a salad, an hors d'oeuvre or starter, a main course, and dessert. The price wasn't bad given the fact each of you got to select one from each category. The only thing that wasn't included were the drinks.\n\nThe service here has always been spectacular, with everyone always being very warm and friendly, and on top of the service. They're very quick to seat you if you have a reservation. \n\nUnlike many other places in the city with live jazz, the food here is spectacular. I've had a lot of the options from their menu: potato pillows, crab rolls, steak tartare, truffle fries, calamari, stuffed quail, chicken hash, lobster spaghetti, and the dry aged NY strip. My favorite entree was probably the stuffed quail, but it seems like they no longer have that as an option, and the NY strip was a close second. I will say I wasn't the biggest fan of the chicken hash or the lobster spaghetti. All the hors d'oeuvres and starters I've had have all been really good, and I generally rotate through them. As for drinks, the Bix Sidecar is my personal favorite.\n\nOverall, this has been my favorite place when looking for a romantic date night with good food and live jazz in the city.", "author": "Eric U."}

I called the restaurant at 4:30 and made reservations for 5:30 the same day. I received a text message saying we were ready to be seated. We checked- in and got seated immediately. The hostess checked-in our bags for us.\n\nThe seating for us was a little tight, some guests had to squeeze in behind us to get to their tables. But no biggie, I also found the chairs to be uncomfortable. Maybe I am used to chairs having arms. Anyhow, the seats were red/velour which was a very classy look.\n\nThe waiter greeted us quickly giving us the drink selections and asked us if we had any questions. We put in our drink order and he did recommend some great appetizers.\n\nBefore we got our appetizers, they brought us fresh HOT rolls with butter. Wow, we could of just ate that all night and been satisfied!\n\nWe opted for the Chef's appetizer which fed everyone at the table; it came with deviled eggs, potato pillows, crab rolls and a fancy version of grilled cheese. Every one of those items were delicious. The eggs were perfectly seasoned.  The pillows were light and fluffy. The crab roll had a nice chunk of crab in it. The grilled cheese was buttery and toasted just right.\n\nIn between courses, the waiters would come and clear out plates and make sure we had the correct silverware. They also asked us if we wanted more bread and checked in to see if we needed more drinks. \n\nThe waiter made great suggestions on our entr\u00e9e order and answered all our questions. We placed our orders and the food came out rather quickly.\n\nThe chicken hash was GREAT! Pulled roasted chicken made into a hash sitting on bed of smoked corn sauce. The cherry tomatoes and bourbon barrel smoked paprika gave it a bold taste. I ate every bite, the portion was just right.\n\nAfter dinner, we got our dessert menu and shortly placed our order. The warm chocolate brioche pudding was excellent! The mascarpone on top made it a very tasty treat!\n\nWe got our bill, hung around for a bit but were not rushed to leave what so ever. The staff is VERY attentive and gives everyone the undivided attention they deserve. You get the royal treatment up in HERE!\n\nI was a little disappointed in how the restrooms looked, they could use some upkeep. Also,  I understand fancy places like this need to dim the lights but it was way too dark! Being that is was so dark, I could not turn on my flash ( I did in one picture, but it was so noticeable) so the quality of my pictures are not great.\n\nBut overall, 4.5 stars baby! A must try!

The appetizers are single bite size.\n\nWe got the crab rolls, foie gras special, ceviche, albacore carpaccio, croques, deviled eggs, truffle fries, they gifted us the saut\u00e9ed wax beans and shisito peppers. Nobody had any complaint about any of the appetizers. Each one was so flavorful and the perfect texture. My tastebuds were in heaven. \n\nFor drinks we ordered a bottle of the Domaine Carneros champagne, rose Bellini, and the Nico. The Nico was very sweet so if you're not a sweet drink person this isn't the drink for you. They do have a full bar available and the other people at our table ordered a Manhattan and whisky. \n\nFor entrees we ordered lobster spaghetti, the salmon entree and the porkchop. The lobster spaghetti was amazing the tomatoes were cooked perfectly and the pasta had a great al dente texture. The salmon was soft and buttery. The porkchop was so juicy and flavorful. \n\nWe finished dinner with the chocolate brioche bread pudding topped with vanilla ice cream. It was amazing! The dark warm chocolate mixed with a cold vanilla ice cream was the perfect combination.

At $30, it should be, well, the Best. It was good, but small and definitely not amazing. I would give it a B. It came with fries, but they were in a 3X3X3 ramekin. And I'm not talking feet here. Service was tepid and disinterested.  I was able to eat at the bar, which I like and the live music was quite pleasant. My martini was decent, but the olives were mushy which is tolerable at a dive bar, but not at a $$$ restaurant. And now that I think about it, the glass should've been colder, and the martini shaken longer. And it's pretty hard to f#ck up a martini. All in all, if you want a great steak place with live music, try Harris'. For a phenomenal burger, try Street or Causewell's.

This place is pretty easy to pass by if you don't know exactly what you're looking for so luckily we did a little research before arriving and found the valet parking. \nWe were seated quickly and had a good amount of time to figure out what we wanted to order. To drink, I got the pisco punch which was super good, it kind of reminded me of a mojito. For our entr\u00e9e I got the lamb and my boyfriend got the truffle burger. The lamb was cooked to perfection, it was really tender and had really great flavor and my boyfriend really liked his burger even though he was taken aback that there was no top bun haha.\nWe decided to skip an appetizer and got dessert instead; we ordered the bread pudding and it was amazing. I would seriously go back just to have it again.\nBix is super pricey but it makes a great treat every once in a while. The ONLY downside was the service. Our waiter went MIA a few times, we had to hunt servers down just to get refills on our water, we were only checked on once during our meal and our waiter never asked if I'd like a another cocktail (I obviously could've just asked for another one if I wanted one but it's all about service).\nIn general, we had a very good and pricey experience.

Early arrivals get to hang out at the bar until the entire party arrives. There are two floors, and we got seated upstairs where the pretty tree and corner booth seating was. Our waitress was friendly and very accommodating; she also gave great recommendations for our group. We split a bottle of Riesling among us 6 and received complimentary bread and butter. Since there were so many options for starters, our waitress suggested a sampler plate for 4 different appetizers (one for each person) - win!\n\nStarters: \n- Potato Pillows (with Creme Fraiche & Caviar): (Part of the appetizer sampler with 6 pieces) Reminded us all of hashbrowns in texture and taste - which wasn't a bad thing, but didn't taste unique; still good though.\n- Dungeness Crab Roll (with Meyer Lemo Aioli): (Part of the appetizer sampler with 6 pieces) one of the harder starters to eat since the crab pieces tend to fall off the bread piece. Tasty; would order again.\n- Brazilian Queijo Fritters (with Stuffed Braised Oxtail & Pepper Jam): (Part of the appetizer sampler with 6 pieces) this was my favorite starter and I highly recommend ordering. The texture reminds me of mochi when you bite into it, with a crisp exterior. Not sure if I liked the sweet and sour sauce on top, but this was awesome in texture and taste!\n- Deviled Eggs (with Truffles & Radish): (Part of the appetizer sampler with 6 pieces) Love anything with truffle on top, but this wasn't a unique dish either; however, I still enjoyed the egg.\n- Steak Tartare (not part of the appetizer sampler): didn't taste very unique, and it was more on the sour side for me, but did like it.\n\nMain:\n- Pacific Sea Bass (with Hollandaise sauce): One of my friends ordered this, and the sea bass was good, especially with the Hollandaise sauce. I would recommend trying if you were feeling something light for dinner.\n- Lobster Spaghetti (with cherry tomatoes & jalapenos): I ordered this for dinner along with 4 others. We wanted something light for dinner, but I definitely want to try the steak the next time I return. The lobster was good, and the noodles had a great chewy texture. I didn't taste any spiciness even though the dish included jalapenos. Light and yummy; would reorder.\n\nDesserts:\n- Miso Butterscotch Creme Brulee (with Malt Meringue, Blonde Chocolate Ganache, and Black Yuzu Ice Cream): The yuzu ice cream and creme brulee tasted better separate than together. The creme brulee was too salty for me and the yuzu ice cream just didn't go well with the rest of the flavors. I wouldn't reorder this dessert.\n- Warm Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding: The chocolate was very rich and soft. Enjoyed this more than the creme brulee.\n\nOverall, great service, good food. The meal came out to be around $108 per person including the birthday girl's portion. Definitely worth trying. Something to mention, this restaurant is in a dark alley-way, so be careful when walking down to the middle of the block where the restaurant resides. There will be seats and tables outside to help you identify :)", "author": "Amanda C."}

My friends gave me a gift card several years ago so I finally used it for a business lunch.  Being the Friday of the July 4th weekend, the restaurant was only about a quarter full.  After being shown a semi circular booth upstairs, we opted for a conventional one, given my portly shape.\nOur waiter offered us drinks so I chose the strawberry lemonade while my guest had a signature Bloody Mary.  After a few questions, here's what I tried:\n\nAppetizers (all shared)\n1) Potato pillows (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=rysfMkV3XiFGPRbTzKQYLQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Think rectangular tater tot (not that one, Cherylynn?!) topped with cr\u00e8me fraiche and sturgeon caviar.  Decadent combination and, at four per order, not a cheap app.\n\n2) Steak tartare - Prepared/mixed tableside and served with some small baguette pieces, I believe, everyone complimented this dish and there was not a drop to be scraped from the plate when we were done.\n\nEntree\n3) Bix burger (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=vg32_U8Ye-7vTsWe6YEtjA) - Very efficient presentation as it allows the diner to construct the burger as they like.  Great that they separated the various sauces and toppings as pictured.  I also liked that my burger was cooked medium, leaning towards the medium rare side.\n\nWhile one of my guests also had a burger (cheddar cheese), the other had the chicken hash and enjoyed it.  Service was efficient as water and drink glasses were filled and empty dishes removed in a timely manner.  Since it was a workday for everyone, we passed on dessert.  Thanks to my friends for 'gifting' me this meal and my guess for making the lunch an enjoyable catch up meal.\nMight be back for dinner, but need to find someone for that romantic meal.\nAny takers?!", "author": "Mike C."}

The restaurant is a one of a kind experience set in a old San Francisco jazz venue. The ambiance takes you back to perhaps the 20's or 30's. The decor and ambiance was on par with what the restaurant was trying to achieve. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the piano entertainment as well as the jazz ensemble later on at night. The appetizers (marrow bones) were a hit as well as their fresh sourdough roll and decadent butter. \n\nThe entrees were subpar. We had hoped for more given that this place is an institution in SF. He had the t-bone lamb (which I tried and to my dismay found it atrocious). I had the lobster spaghetti which I found lackluster. The cherry tomatoes were too abundant as the lobster (which consisted of 1 oz of lobster claw meat, not so rich and buttery), left more to be desired. The sauce was a light cream sauce which should have tied the whole dish together, but I just was confounded and disappointed at the end. I will say the saving grace of the dining experience was the truffle fries (what was that amazing white aioli) and the bananas foster we ended our meal with. \n\nAll in all, this place is an iconic terrific venue with such an amazing old school jazz feel. The music/entertainment takes you to such a great state of mind. The appetizers and deserts are to die for. I may suggest to do your research on the entrees and to get recommendations. Stay away from the t-bone lamb and the lobster spaghetti. This left more to be desired.", "author": "Lynn E."}

I just feel like everything overpowered the caviar, so you can't really taste it like you should. It's almost just there for show. \n\nCroques - These were yummy. Not tasty enough for me to grab two but good enough to finish my one. \n\nOysters - We ordered 4 platters of which were...well...what I expected. I've had better. \n\nLobster Spaghetti - this was the bell of the ball. The noodles were tender, the lobster was juicy and the sauce was light but still perfectly flavorful. I opted to go without the jalape\u00f1os so it was also very mild.

This is not the kind of treatment we would expect at a five star restaurant or any restaurant that would treat their clientele.  When we commented to the maitre d and he said that he had to run a business and that means they won't make money unless they turn the tables and this is a business and he didn't  care about how we felt he had to make money.  This pressure moved what would have been a solid 5 star experience to a 2 star review.  So if you plan on eating here make sure you plan for a short evening", "author": "Linda W."}

I love to try deviled eggs everywhere I go and I feel like the ones here are almost as good as Leo's Oyster Bar. We ordered a ton of appetizers and I got the salmon for dinner. There was a piano player and singer downstairs which made the ambiance a little romantic. The lighting inside was dim which also made it super chill and relaxing. I would recommend this place to anyone going on a date or any type of dress up occasion really! Don't show up in jeans like I did, you will feel out of place haha.", "author": "Samantha R."}

I was a bit worried by some of the reviews on Open Table so after my experience I was compelled to write a review. First and foremost the service was impeccable! I can honestly say the best service I've received at a restaurant. The restaurant is beautiful with a retro 1920's feel which I fell in love with. The bar and dinner menu pays homage to the 20's with a modern twist. We ordered the steak tartare, porterhouse lamb,chicken hash and a few drinks from the bar and everything was amazing. Not to mention the live jazz music was a nice added bonus. We really enjoyed ourselves and we will be going back.", "author": "natasha t."}

The food was really good, but not quite 5 stars.  Cesar salad was bland. Really bland. A bit disappointing, I expected anchovies, and a lovely garlicky salad- definitely needs improvement. The steak tartare was done table-side and was lovely, great balance of flavors. Bone marrow was generous- the parsley shallot accompaniment was a little lackluster though. The NY strip was bland. We asked for sauces on the side but it came swimming in sauce. I didn't love the flavor, and wished it was seasoned. Swordfish was tiny in size - like a chunk really, and delicious. Cooked beautifully. The lamb powerhouse is awesome, and very small in size. Don't think \"porterhouse\" think medallions.  The interpretation Black Forest cake is not very good in our opinion. Strange flavor. The sorbet, however was amazing!!!!!!", "author": "Mo F."}

They are hidden down a seemingly seedy alley with a dim lit sign saying BIX. Very cool vibe here. We came in without a reservation and were lucky enough to grab a seat at the bar. A foursome had just closed out and we only waited for abut 5 mins. My bf had a manhattan I think because it just felt like you should. The bar is dark and bustling. An old school feel. The restaurant and the upstairs dining area feels formal but very old world. We also tried the scallops. They came sliced thin with herbs and a light sauce,  but a tad on the salty side. Enough to share with one other if you are sharing dishes. Not enough for your meal. We also ordered a lobster salad, they split is for us and I must say there wasn't much on either of our plates. But I loved the flavor of the dressing, the peppery arugula and the fresh herbs. The lobster was a bit fishy on both of your plates. The bartender ended up taking it off our bill which was very sweet because we didn't make a big deal about it. The dinner menu looked nice and I would have probably dined here but we had other plans.

We arrived pretty late around 9:30pm on a Sunday but were seated fairly quickly because I made last minute reservations online for hubby and I. I loved the live piano player and singer. Food was yummy. I specifically remember the truffle fries being amazing. Slightly on the pricier side, but the ambiance and vibe makes up for it. Very classy, jazz feel. I liked that it was two stories and enjoyed the decor/paintings on the wall as well. \n\nOnly downside was that the dinner/seating area is so close to the bar and there was a really drunk/rowdy guy in a group. He totally killed the mood, he kept screaming at the top of his drunk lungs, it was super awkward. Eventually he left, but I don't think any of the waitstaff or hosts said anything to him to calm down - which we didn't appreciate. Given the vibe of the place you would think they would tell him to relax or leave... \n\nOverall, would recommend this place for a date night. We came from out of town, from NY.

Plus entries (the lobster spaghetti was enjoyed by both of my adult sons), that lamb was probably the biggest dinner at our table, plus the NY steak.  Wine, dessert, coffees, and some whisky brought the bill to $600.00 including tip.\n\nThe only real negative about this restaurant is that it is unnecessarily dark downstairs.  You can barely read the menus, but the decor would look so much better with a bit more lighting.  The piano was great (now I feel bad I didn't tip him).\n\nThe waitstaff were very pleasant, but because the background noise (and music) drowned them out, it was difficult to hear about specials, etc.\n\nA bit pricey, but we had a memorable and enjoyable celebration, and nothing went wrong with the service or food!

Last Tuesday, November 3rd, the roommate realized we hadn't gone out for dinner in a while and told me to pick a restaurant. Scrolling through OpenTable (www.opentable.com), I saw an opening for Bix at 6pm and decided to take it. I've had it bookmarked forever. Plus, I've never had any luck making same day reservations for a 6pm dinner, so I thought it was meant to be.\n\nDrinks:\n*PERFECT MANHATTAN: George Dickel Rye, Dolin Dry & Carpano Antica Sweet Vermouths Bitters ($13)\n*2014 Sauvignon Blanc, Duckhorn, Napa Valley, CA ($15)\n*2012 Cabernet Sauvignon, Pied \u00e0 Terre, Sonoma County, CA ($18)\n\nTheir cocktails are delish. I definitely enjoyed my Manhattan. The wines by the glass are a little pricey in my opinion. I thought they should have offered some glasses priced closer to $10. There were a few, but no Sauvignon Blancs or Cabs in that price range. I picked the cheapest ones.\n\nFood:\n*Dungeness Crab Rolls: Meyer Lemon Aioli ($18)\n*Deviled Eggs: Truffles, Radish ($12)\n*Foie Gras Torchon: Pears, Walnut and Pear Coulis, Candied Walnuts ($23)\n*Marrow Bones: Parsley & Shallot Salad, Grilled Durum Batard ($18)\n*Compart Farms Pork Chop: Warm Autumn Salad, Squash, Radicchio, Apples, Maitake Mushrooms, Pomegranate Vinaigrette ($29)\n*Black Truffle Cheese Burger: On Rye with Truffle Fries, served open-faced ($28)\n*Bananas Foster: Dark Rum & Vanilla Ice Cream ($10)\n\nMy favorite dish was the bone marrow. Three very generous bone halves filled with rich fatty marrow. Yum! The crab rolls and deviled eggs were good small bites to start off our meal. My coworker raves about the truffle burger and the bananas foster. I thought they were good, but not mind blowing. I ordered the burger medium rare which was a mistake on my part. I should have asked for it medium as the flavors and textures would have melded together better. The bananas foster was just eh in my opinion. I'm not a huge fan of melting ice cream, but I liked the bananas and rum sauce. I didn't eat much of the duck, but the roommate finished the whole dish. The one thing that was disappointing was the torchon. It didn't have much of the decadent foie flavor that I love.\n\nI didn't really notice anything off about service, but the roommate mentioned that our server wasn't very attentive. Our water glasses were empty most of the night and plates took a while to be cleared. When I mentioned we're in a drought, he said he saw the older couple next to us getting water refills and plates cleared promptly all night long. Yes, there was a lag in between courses for us, but I didn't really mind. We did have an incredibly long dinner though.\n\nAfter spending a little over $200 on dinner for two before tax and tip, I wanted the food to better. Overall, everything was just okay. Glad I finally tried Bix, but other than checking a restaurant off my list, I didn't really walk away with much.", "author": "Elena N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-19", "description": "Saw the neon sign, walked through the doors, and thought wow, this place looks nice. \nThe decor and artwork transports you to the classy 1920s era. Time-travel + dinner? I'm in. You may want to dress nicely. Usually, I say any attire is acceptable in SF, because it's a casual city. But in the '20s, gentlemen and ladies were known for being classy, so you probably should try to look classy too.\n\nThe cozy, intimate setting was warm, inviting, and just right. If anyone is attempting an intimate, romantic, candlelit setting, they ought to learn a thing or two from Bix. It didn't feel too cozy or cramped at all. Bix has been around since 1988, so they must be doing something right.\n\nMr. Joy made reservations and we were led upstairs to the balcony level that was full of booths. Booths are comfy, kind of classy, give you a little privacy, and girls like to have a place to rest their handbags. Am I right? \n\nAll the while, the sound of jazz music lightly emanated from downstairs. \nI was starting to wonder how the waiters got themselves up and down the stairs all night, but I think they go through some secret elevator.\n\n$18 Potato Pillows - Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche, California Sturgeon Caviar:\nIt was the most interesting sounding of the hors d'ouvre choices. \n4 delicate potato puffs resting on a napkin, like pillows on bedding ... very nice touch.\nThe first thing that came to my mind: This is one expensive version of MickyD's hash browns from their breakfast menu. I'm not knocking the dish. I like McD's hash browns, but I just never get there early enough to order breakfast. \nWas it elevated? Certainly. \nCrispy & crunchy on the outside, nice and puffed up inside. \nEach had a dollop of creme fraiche. The flavor of the salty sturgeon caviar stood out, but was not heavily briny or salty as a lot of caviar is known to be.\nI tried to eat them slowly, because they were so small and I wanted to savor them.\n\n$24 Chicken Hash a la Bix - Mascarpone Vodka Sauce:\nI was attracted to the idea of hash that night, but it seemed more like I ordered two chicken patties over a light cream sauce, adorned with halved cherry tomatoes. \nI liked the vodka sauce, but it didn't have enough flavor. Chicken already doesn't have much flavor, so I was hoping the sauce would do it.\nI did feel like they did something interesting with chicken, but not something I would crave. \n\n$28 Black Truffle Cheese Burger - On Rye with Truffle Fries, served open-faced:\nThick, juicy beef patty cooked just right - medium-rare, golden brown on the outside, and pink on the inside. The cheese was melted over the patty just the way I like. It was topped with an entire ring of caramelized onions. Great, that's the only way I'll eat onions on a burger. None of that annoying raw onion nonsense. It was accompanied with a pile of arugula on the side. I wasn't all that interested in an open-faced burger though.\nI don't care for fries,  but Mr. Joy, the French fry lover, said the fries were good, but couldn't really taste the flavor of truffles.\n\n$10 Warm Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding:\nThis was more like a rich chocolate brownie topped with a mound of vanilla ice cream, and drizzled with chocolate sauce. If I didn't know what it was, I wouldn't have guessed that this is bread pudding. It doesn't have the consistency or texture of bread pudding, or the custard flavor of bread pudding. \nHowever it is, of course, delicious. It's hard not to like chocolate. Hot, gooey, rich, decadent, fudgy chocolate.\n\nThis would probably be 5 stars for me if I were more wowed by the food. I should have stuck to my usual favorites and ordered the steak tartare or bone marrow. I'm not sure about the foie gras since it has quinoa in it, but if I come back, I'd be interested in trying it.", "author": "Joy W."}

I knew I wanted to try their Friday lunch (they ONLY do lunch on Fridays) and I had taken the last Friday of the year off. On Friday morning, I woke up late, not knowing what to do with my day off, and decided, you know what? Today is the day. We're doing this. With it being basically a day that no one was working, and right before a holiday, I figured the crowd wouldn't be bad, because the financial district crowd wouldn't be there. I was correct. I made a reservation a few hours ahead of time, and flounced in there at 12:30 PM and was seated immediately. \n\nFirst of all: Bix is SOOOOOOOOO pretty. Like, my heart pitter pattered when I walked in there. It's so classic looking, so beautifully old school. I'm already dying to return on a night when someone is playing the beautiful grand piano that I saw sitting there. \n\nWe ordered deviled eggs to start, and they were perfect. I'm getting aroused just thinking about them. I had the chicken hash, which was unlike anything I have ever had. I will warn you that it is a rich dish, so I would suggest sharing it with someone, and having half of whatever they're eating. That's what I ended up doing with my husband, who ordered the burger. Granted, a burger isn't exactly a huge move from the rich category, lol. But the burger was great, the fries were great, and we both LOVED the chicken hash. I would say a must try dish, as it is very unique. Our server told us that it is one of the dishes that never leaves the menu, because it is always in demand (along with the lobster spaghetti.) We finished with the Bix Millionaire Bar for dessert, which was heavenly. iT was like a Twix bar, with caramel and chocolate. I guess IT changes flavor by the year though, because now I'm seeing that their menu has it with peppermint. \n\nOur server was very nice, and very attentive. Food and drinks came out in a timely manner. Atmosphere was dreamy. Take someone you love there and hold their hand and gaze into their eyes and order martinis and then float out of there.

The service from the moment you say hi to the valet guys outside to the moment you leave, it is impeccable. I was really astonished with how genuinely kind and friendly everyone was. I usually anticipate a little 'tude or air of pretentiousness, but not here. Service is fantastic. The decor is PERFECT. It is dark enough for my liking, dimly lit for date night perfection. Everything is wood and leather and old school elevated feeling. It has two stories, and is very spacious by SF standards. I love the vibe and music I have heard here. Even the musicians are friendly and smiley! \n\nBUT here's the kicker...the food! It was disappointingly mediocre. I had the nearly $40 lobster pasta. The pasta was NOT cooked. It definitely wasn't homemade which is OK, but it wasn't cooked! It had this really odd rubber texture. I was with a group of 4 and 3 of ordered it. I finally said something and everyone sighed and agreed! I think no one wanted to say anything. I've never had pasta with that hard rubber texture before. The lobster was sufficient, but I couldn't get past that pasta! I do wish I had said something because everyone was so helpful I know they would have fixed it without hesitation.

I loved that we walked down a hidden alley near north beach to the restaurant with a glowing sign outside. The food was good, the drinks tasty, but the ambiance was the detail that made this restaurant stand out. The live jazz, oversized paintings on the wall, dimmed lighting, and a sultry stairway leading to the intimate table tucked upstairs were the cherry on top. We ordered the marrow bones to share to start- I would give 8/10. They are delicious and classic, but I wouldn't order again. For mains, hubby had the lamb it was medium rare and seared to perfection. 9/10, the crispy rice accompaniment was paired perfectly for a fall meal. I had the famous lobster spaghetti, 8/10. It was good, but not as amazing as I had expected. The sauce had a hint of spice, cherry tomatoes, and fresh tasty lobster. I am also the type of diner that is not necessarily impressed by a dish unless it is unique and memorable. I feel I could've made the lobster spaghetti myself. Dessert was a nice sorbet with a happy birthday message. There were about 6 birthdays situated around us. The two couples to the right also had birthdays. It's a romantic place to take an intimate group of friends or partner to celebrate their birthday in style. The only negative I have about the experience was that our waiter didn't seem engaged at all, and actually seemed displeased that we had shared our first course and not ordered dessert besides the birthday gift. He seemed to want to sell more to get a better tip. We did not let his nonchalant attitude bother us.

We promised to meet at least once a month to catch up on our lives, careers etc. For the first year, we did pretty well and kept that promise. Then our lives took over and one of us moved further down the Peninsula.  So this once a month affair turned into a once year affair with all of the changes that happened in our lives.  \n\nAfter settling on a date and time, I checked out our options and decided to go for Bix. I've had Bix on my radar for years and for some reason never had the chance to make reservations until recently.   I was excited.  This place has been raved about from many of my friends and I've read several articles about it.  It's been in the SF restaurant industry for quite some time.  \n\nThe place has an old school club vibe to it.  Not too stuffy and the service was amazing.  Our waiter was wonderful and he never skipped a beat.  I ordered a bellini (get it - it's delicious!) and we shared the following dishes: \n\nfried chicken (lite crispy bites of fried chicken - my friends loved it)\nburrata with tomatoes (they dress it at your table; my expectations of this were high so I thought it could be better but definitely still good)\nceasar salad (it was ok)\nspaghetti with lobster (delicious!) \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the bananas foster and another dish.  Definitely get the bananas foster!  It's sweet but delicious.  We all loved it.  \n\nIt can get a bit loud in there so if you want a quieter area, request the upstairs.  I will definitely be back for drinks and happy hour soon. This can be a nice place for a date or a business dinner.", "author": "Christine P."}

It's off the main road in an alley, but the inside is spacious with a great dark and lively atmosphere. We were there for my grandmother's birthday - they had a table of 12, and we were placed next to them at a table of 4 since we were added on. They could've made a bigger table, but then everyone would have to do the prix fixe menu. \n\nThe food and service was spectacular. We started with the potato pillows and crab rolls which were delicious. Then we got a dozen oysters - 2 types split even. For entrees, I had the lobster spaghetti which was good but a little small for the price I was paying. My family members had the sea bass and pork chop which were very good as well. \n\nWould definitely return! Highly satisfied with my experience.", "author": "Margaret K."}

I didn't realize how big of a step down this would be, and I thought the 30s-40s theme would make this fun, but it wasn't enough to make up for mostly lackluster food and service.\n\nDRINKS: Parents ordered three drinks, none were made correctly. We shared a bottle of a decent cab, but prices are either under $50 or a couple hundred, range seemed to be inconsistent. \nAPPETIZERS: The potato pillows were divine, but be aware the portion is very small (4 bite size pieces), bone marrow was decent, and the avocado salad was better than expected. The apps were promising but entrees were a step down.\nENTREES: Pork was juicy but bland and underseasoned, duck breast was a generous portion but unusually tough, lobster spaghetti (split portion) was cooked nicely al dente but featured maybe an ounce of lobster and a mediocre tomato-heavy sauce. The side of fresh green beans that our server recommended was the highlight of this course, sadly. \nDESSERT: We got the chocolate brandied cherries, which was very rich. Coffees were better made than the drinks, surprisingly.\n\nService was awkward and table for four was a very tight fit. Server brought our wine, dropped it to the table corked, came back and opened it a few minuets later, offered to clear out serving plates between appetizer rounds then didn't follow through, just not on par with the price point or expectations for this caliber restaurant.", "author": "Stefany V."}

I found myself thinking about Beethoven and his ear trumpet, since it was hard to have a conversation with our friends.  I barely enjoyed the food or music, just because of the LOUD TALKERS and TERRIBLE ACCOUSTICS.  Speakeasy? I kept wishing the principal would show up and tell everyone to SHUT UP and show some respect for the musicians.\n\nWhile waiting for our car, one of the valets suggested Wednesdays were probably a better time for the likes of me.

I've worked in the hospitality industry for 12 years and I've never seen anyone tip on just the meal (without the tax). The suggested tip percentages on the bottom of the bill are intentionally wrong. They are calculated PRE-TAX so the wait staff, bartenders, and bus boys are all getting screwed out of 8.75% of their potential earnings when someone follows their recommendation because of a conscious decision of the management.

And... I was right. I wasn't missing out for not trying Bix any earlier. The food was just OK, in my opinion. My friends and I came here on a Sunday night with reservations. And surprisingly when we had arrived, the restaurant wasn't even that full to be needing reservations. \n\nFood-\nFoie Gras Torchon - Very tasty and smooth. Went perfect with the toasted bread. Probably my favorite dish of the night.\n\nPotato Pillows - Pretty disappointed as it was nothing special. Bite size portions. It reminded me of the small hash browns that you can get from Burger King's breakfast menu, except it has caviar on top.\n\nDuck Breast - Not the best duck breast I've had, but it was still delicious. It was pretty tender and the flavor was just right. I wished the skin was just a bit crispier though..\n\nWarm Chocolate Cookies with Whiskey Cream - These cookies came out fast after we ordered. A bit sweet with a hint of whiskey taste. Not too memorable, in my opinion.", "author": "Philana C."}

The decor was classy and the live music was enjoyable and well received by the patrons. \nNow to the dishes we had. Going by both the waiter's and most Yelpers' recommendations, we ordered the Bix Fried Chicken and it was worth every dollar spent. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the portion was large enough to split between the two of us (although a tiny selfish part of me wanted it all for myself because it was so yum :D). We next ordered the Chicken Hash (another popular dish) but this time we ordered separate plates and were glad we did since the portions were small. Portion size apart, it did not disappoint and the dish was perfect.\n\nWhy not the full 5-stars then, you ask? Well, because we were not very impressed with the cocktails or the desserts. My husband had the House Cocktail and I ordered the Dougie fresh, neither of which were praise worthy. For dessert, we had the Bananas Foster and Warm Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding and both of them were meh. \n\nAll in all, the dinner was nice and we would probably return to try some of the other entrees and for the fried chicken.

We were there for at least 3 hours. Our bill and tip was well over $425. The food was fine. Just fine. My steak was not worth $49. I've had better ones for $25-70. Our waitress was very attentive and nice.\n\nA large table was seated next to us. One man was wearing a tux. It was a Monday. After a while I realized that it wasn't the dress code (which I was told was fancy, but several polo shirts were seen), and it was because he and his new bride just got married earlier in the day probably at city hall. They chose to have their wedding night celebratory dinner with friends and family at Bix of all the 1000 restaurants in the city. They chose to start memories of this day at Bix. \n\nLast night Bix had a Pianist and a Bass player playing great fantastic music. The wedding party was quiet and respectable the entire night. Clearly their meal was over and people were starting to get up. The Bride and groom walked over to the musicians holding hands. Before they could even begin to mutter a word, the hostess comes racing over and I knew she was telling them that they were not allowed to dance. Still being polite, the new couple smiled and walked away.\n\nBix has maybe 20 tables total. 6 of them were full at this time. It was near 9:30pm on a monday. It was their wedding night and they were denied being able to simply have one dance together. It would not have hurt anyone, and I'm sure every single patron in the restaurant would not have cared less, but actually it really pissed us off. They looked adorable, seemed polite and respectful, chose to drop well over $1000 at Bix on their most important day of their lives so far. And Bix denied them this sweet memory. \n\nI can't and wont go here ever again.", "author": "Parker K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-07-04", "description": "Gosh, I remember when BIX was THE 'It' place of the late 80's dining scene in San Francisco. Even back then in 1988 when it opened, the place had a classy, 1930's-era nightclub vibe that would have made it an ideal setting for a classic mistaken identity screwball farce with Cary Grant and Irene Dunne (photo: http://bit.ly/1a4NxT5). A quarter-century later and I was back just for a cocktail and some appetizers with my good friend Rene. Owner Doug Biederbeck still runs the place though he has since expanded his empire considerably with Florio, MarketBar and Zero Zero. But BIX looks pretty much the same all these years later. Its hidden location on Gold Street still evokes the same speakeasy vibe (photo: http://bit.ly/13x1Gou), and the bar bustles with suits in the early evening.\n\nRene and I managed to snatch a couple of seats at the bar where we immediately ordered a couple of the $12 BIX Negronis (photo: http://bit.ly/16ar3bU). A stylish house specialty, it's a potent potable with Plymouth gin, Campari and Carpano Antica Sweet Vermouth. I felt like I should have been wearing a tuxedo and saying, \"Judy, Judy, Judy\". We were in a nibbling mood as we were catching up, so we ordered a classic first, the $12 Deviled Eggs with Truffles, Radish and Chives, which basically meant we got an egg each, split and decorously topped with flourish (photo: http://bit.ly/12KqiE7). I do love a good deviled egg in the right venue, and these were so BIX. Next came the $10 House Mozzarella Skewers with Olio Nuovo and Prosciutto (photo: http://bit.ly/1cXBfYW).\n\nThey were savory Italianate lollipops that popped into the mouth far too easily. To finish off our stop at BIX, we had the $12 Duck Ham and Maitake Panini, a quartet of little protein-packed triangles grilled in butter and oozing with melted cheese (photo: http://bit.ly/16areUr). Throughout our meal of high-end hors d'oeuvres, we were grazing on the constantly filled bowl of Chex mix, a throwback of a different sort, at least for me as I used to eat this stuff a lot at dorm parties (photo: http://bit.ly/10D2Lso). The jazz music was playing in the background, and the suits were starting to get their dining tables. Dinner next time perhaps, but a soup\u00e7on of BIX will do me for now. Time for Rene and me to walk over to Mr. Bing's where we can experience how the other half imbibes.\n\nDRINKS & APPETIZERS - 4 stars...still praiseworthy if rather pricey\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...darkness falls all the time at BIX\nSERVICE - 3 stars...polite though lacking some enthusiasm at this stage\nTOTAL - 4 stars...a classic San Francisco stop for an old-school cocktail with good friends", "author": "Ed U."}

The bartender then does the \"change for $10 trick\" -- he gives me just $10 in change, instead of $20.  \n\nNow PLEASE. . . .  I know that I handed him a $20 for two reasons.  First, I only had $30 cash on me before I arrived at the restaurant (I had tried to pay for my co-workers' drinks earlier, but didn't have enough cash).  Second, before I handed him the bill, I double-checked that it wasn't a hundred, which I had in my wallet last week.\n\nWhen I protest that he's given me the wrong change, the bartender plays stupid and says, \"Oh no, you gave me a $10.\"  Then his fellow bartender -- who was two feet away and didn't handle the bill -- tries to back him up, as does the hostess.  The manager then suggests that I MUST be mistaken and should just suck it up.\n\nREALLY?  SERIOUSLY?

Casual chic at its best. \n\nI am writing this review because the negative reviews on yelp of this restaurant have zero validity. I can say they are pretty much just ridiculous \"I am entitled, hear me complain\" load of garbage comments. \n\nI am  a SF native and have been dining in MY city that I was RAISED in for over 3 decades, which regretfully has been taken over by a bunch of self-righteous, entitled, spoiled, rude and oblivious group of tyrants that think the world owes them something. The only thing you are owed is a swift kick in the pants!\n\nFirst of all.. Anyone who has given this place a bad review clearly lacks attention and was neglected as a child! if you look at the type of people who left the bad reviews, you will see on their entire profile, it seems as though it is their duty to leave bad reviews.. Maybe this makes them feel important.. I say you are TRAGIC!\n\nHere are some responses for all the negative feedback left:\n\nYes, the place is hectic and busy but it's called being successful.. Yes you need to order your food and carry on with your dinner because there are other people waiting to eat with their guest, family and so on.. The \"other people waiting for a table\" could be YOU waiting to eat so don't freakin' linger and have some respect so other people waiting for their reservation can have the chance to enjoy dinner as well. Maybe you can try a bit of humanity or humility and go have drinks or listen to music at the bar if you are done.. STOP being a spoiled and entitled tyrant. It is basic Restaurant 101 and BTW: you are a complete P.O.S. if your entitled, self absorbed mentally is \"I have a reservation and I have the table all night\".. NO YOU DONT! NO YOU DONT because others have reservations too!!!\n\nFor those who \"think\" they are sneaky and don't get the reservation time they want and show up with half of their party: YOUR TABLE IS GOING TO BE GIVEN AWAY .. Why should another reservation or guest have to suffer because of you? What makes you more important?! YOU are being SELFISH & RUDE! How if someone did that to you.. made you wait an extra 45 minutes before you were sat because their party showed up at their convenience? Yeah I didn't think you'd like it! Have some RESPECT!\n\nFor the whiners who want a quiet or private place.. go eat elsewhere, it's a supper club HELLOOOOOO! \nYes the tables are close but once again \"supper club\".. not \"it's my date and I don't want anyone to hear me talk\"...Whaaaaaaaaaaahhhh  .. go cry to someone who cares! \nSupper clubs are know for their tables to be quaint and close, where people sit to have food/cocktails, listen music and socialized with their friends they are dining with.. \nI know social skills and manners are a rarity in the 21st century but try to make an effort to be aware of reality and others around you..  NO ONE CARES HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE.. Put the shoe on the other foot and remember Karma has NO EXPIRATION!\n\nMOST IMPORTANTLY.. This place is a hidden gem! I am glad not every random knows about it!  The best part is that this beautiful establishment isn't infested with a bunch of tourist with zero manners who stroll into a place with zip ups, hats, jeans, shorts and tennis shoes.. Seriously people, dress accordingly to a nice restaurant.! It disturbs the groove, the vibe and ambience of the restaurant.. It's so tacky..AND YES TAKE YOUR HATS OFF! Since when is it okay to wear a hat in a nice restaurant.? Who raised you? \n\nAnother good fact: This is NOT A PLACE FOR CHILDREN! So please leave them at home for the love of GOD..and yes I have children who are extremely well behaved and seasoned to dine out but yet this is NOT the place for them.. If you are offended by this: get over yourselves!\n\nEvery time I have dined here I have seen every single staff person in this restaurant trying to do the best they possibly can to make sure guests are having a great night with the people they came with (like taking 10 photos when they are busy as hell) and making sure all of the guests are properly taken care of throughout the entire time they are giving their service. \n\nWhat makes me cringe is that, in the 21st Century, using being NOT FROM THE USA OR CALIFORNIA to not to leave a proper 18%-25% tip as an excuse is basically A LIE and UNACCEPTABLE!! If you have never worked in a restaurant you have no say?! ZERO!\nFYI: the money left for the server goes to the busser, the bar, the hostess, the people who bring the food out and the people in the kitchen, so don't think it all goes to the server.. every single person in any restaurant gets paid minimum wage and lives on their tips.. Yes that means no tip equals no food to feed their family, clothe children or pay rent.! \n\nOn that note I leave you hopefully educated and little less entitle", "author": "Nina R."}

The bartender was great and so was the bar itself.\n\nI ordered:\n\n-\u00c0 la minute Ceviche with Chiles, Ginger, Avocado and Toasted Corn Nuts = fresh fish and the acidic texture was refreshing.\n\n- Marrow Bones = first time trying this type of dish and I love it. Had a butter soft taste to it. Very succulent!\n\n- Duck Breast with Whole Grain Mustard Spaetzle, Lacinato Kale, Hedgehog Mushrooms and Sweet Onions = duck meat was perfectly medium rare and tender. Delicious spaetzle!\n\n- Lobster Spaghetti = generous portion. Loaded with lobster meat and plenty of cherry tomatoes. It had a sweet texture to this dish.\n\n- Sorbet for dessert = refreshing with a hint of tartness.\n\nTruly satisfied with my meal and the rest of the night listening to live jazz band. I could have not asked for a better dinner. This is why I love to dine in SF, always some spectacular restaurant waiting to be discovered. This one will be in my book of favorite place I love to dine!", "author": "Owie N."}

It was a pricey experience that still left me a bit hungry.  The menu was good, but not too inspiring.  For the same money (or less), I think you can get better food in SF, however there is nothing that can replace this ambiance.  \n\nGreat to impress a date and satisfying for a newbie foodie.

My husband wanted steak tartar and I read this was a great place to get it. \n\nWe had reservations, which we booked just a night or two before we went. \n\nThe cocktails were great- especially the Manhattan. It was an incredibly smooth, very strong drink, that went down a little too easy. The Mister gave the tartar rave reviews. I also thought it was great- rich and tender-textured, with just the right amount of mustard, shallot, and capers. This was my first time having tartar, though, so take that with a grain of salt. \n\nEverything else was just meh. Not bad, nothing was bad. But everything was just sorta okay or maybe even pretty good. The caesar was alright, with nice chunky cheese slivers. But for $13, I could go for more than six little lettuce leaves. And, this is a pet peeve of mine that might not bother you: I don't love chopping up lettuce and mixing and tossing on that flat little plate. It's not like I'm going to pick up these leaves with my hands in this setting. When I'm eating out, I like when my meal comes ready to eat. The potato pillows tasted only of oil and potato. I mean, it was good potato flavor, but that's not why people are ordering this dish. I could see the caviar, but I couldn't taste it or feel it in the bite. And the oil flavor tasted a little burnt. That was a bummer. The chicken hash need some acidity and was just kinda weird. Giant crab-cake like things made out of chicken. \n\nBut even then, everything was pretty okay. Except our server, who had been great, got all snippy out of the blue. We were ready to ask for our check, and she approached the table speaking to us. Before we could say anything, she tried to clear the table and, with a pretty epic side-eye, spoke to us in a way that made it clear she thought we were taking too long over our dessert/after dinner drink. And not only did she think we overstayed. She seemed like she wanted us to know she thought that, too. We actually didn't even get to ask her for the check at that point, because we were caught so off guard by the mood change and then she was gone faster than she walked up. To be fair, we'd been there for just over an hour and a half at that point. But, like I said, we were looking for our check already and we would've have gotten it sooner if we could have asked for it then.\n\nSo that's how the whole meal was. Things started out pretty nice. Then the parts that were a bit off congealed and made things a little sour.", "author": "M B."}

When I called to make a reservation a few days before, I wasn't able to get anything earlier than 7:30pm on the day I was going to be there.  However, my class ended early and my friend and I arrived earlier to the restaurant... say about 5:30pm or so.  They were nice and seating up right away.\n\nWe were greeted about a min after we were seated by our server...and I must say, he is good at his job.  He always had a smile on his face which is always good to see on servers.  He check on us often and even make some jokes.  \n\nNow on to the food:\n\nDungeness Crab Roll - Came with 4 pieces....all I can say is....ohhhh soooo YUMMY!  The right amount of crab for the roll.\n\nSummer Corn Soup - there is a little spicy kick to this... just enough to tickle the tongue.  Creamy and yummy with a few corn kernels.\n\nDuck Breast - Pretty tasty dish, but I wish the duck was more tender.  It was more on the harder/chewier side.\n\nSnake River Farms Pork - mmmmmmm Yummy.  The pork was very tender and juicy.... cooked to perfection with the right amount of seasoning.  The only thing I don't like on this dish is the pickled Mustard seed aioli (because I don't like the horseradish taste).  Other than that, everything was yummy.\n\nTruffle French Fries - Wish it was shoestring french fries, but it wasn't.  Not bad but I love the truffle taste =).\n\nOverall, everything we tried here was yummy.  Will recommend this place for their yummy food.", "author": "Ashley L."}

I guess all you need is my love. \n\nMe: Love? no thanks, I prefer gin. \n\nTheir gin martini is all that and then some: ask for Plymouth gin for a smooth experience, because their house version is made with Gordon's. It's a small cocktail glass, but it'll pack a punch! The pimento stuffed olives don't really do anything for me as a garnish, I'd rather just have plain ones. \n\nI wish I can say our dinner was stellar, but the menu looked better on paper and I feel that the apps were all middle of the road: from their house made cucumber pickles, the duck liver \"faux gras\" and the bone marrow. The bone marrow was as expected, rich, beefy and fatty, but Wayfare Tavern's version is well seasoned and much better. The much raved about potato pillows were indeed good, but were super TINY. I'm tempted to say, \"just order more booze instead!\" \n\nWhich brings me to the cocktail list. Hmm. Except for my martini, I think you're better off with wine. The Hibiscus swizzler is an ok choice made with gin and hibiscus, I do have to say it had a bit more St. Germain Elderflower than I prefer. Their Pisco Sour? Don't bother!  It tasted more like a Pisco Punch and a very bad version of it at that! Where is the foamy egg white? It was all pineapple and was too sweet, this was a cocktail all done wrong!\n\nThe duck breast sat on a bed of rice with sweet corn and peppers, but I've had much, much better duck recently at Terrapin Creek for the same price. Do get the insanely huge (and delicious!!) black truffle cheeseburger with truffle fries! You also can't go wrong with the bananas foster for dessert.\n\nBIX's ambiance is great for those special occasions like birthdays or anniversaries, which is why I chose it. The restaurant sits in an alley in historic Jackson Square and is really beautiful with high ceilings, an open space and live music. Ask for seating on the second floor which overlooks the entire restaurant. \n\nBut for the money we paid, I could've gone to a really solid place like Gary Danko or paid extra money for Alexander's.

The combination of liqueurs worked in harmony. I definitely could order this again and not feel any remorse for not venturing out to try other interesting creations. For apps, the table got a 'combination plate' which was sold to us by the waiter (not sure if its on the menu) but it included ~6 servings of mozzarella wrapped with proscuitto, crab salad in toasted bread buns, deviled eggs, and banh mi sliders. Minus the mozzarella--which was sort of boring--everything else was well seasoned and not overbearing in flavors (which happens a lot to me on dishes like deviled eggs). I would definitely return again for a snack.\n\nAppetizers and entrees. Okay and rather pricey.\nEntrees were  ~$25-$35. Most of the table thought their plates were okay but weren't worth the price. I got the lobster spaghetti (spaghetti with grape tomatoes saut\u00e9ed into a sauce) which although fresh, clean, and seasoned lacked two things: 1) lobster (tough time finding it and most were pieces the size of a dime) and 2) when I think lobster and spaghetti, I hope for something with a creamy or at least thicker sauce -- Here it was akin to a white wine sauce in consistency with too many tomatoes.\n\nDessert. Tasty but not memorable.\nI ordered the earle grey panna cotta with orange sponge cake. The panna cotta had a wonderful silky texture and paired nicely with the freshly cut (slightly sour) strawberries and orange zest. The sponge cake, although good in its own right seemed like an after thought and didn't really add to the dessert.\n\nGo here for cocktails and apps and maybe head somewhere else for dinner.

That era and jazz are foundations of Bix, and a big part of what makes the restaurant a San Francisco treasure.\n\nJust walking in hearkens to a supper club experience from the 30's and 40's - you enter from an alley tucked away in the Jackson Square historic district, once inside the rich interior makes you feel like Bogie will be sitting at a corner table all tux-ed out and running the show. The bartenders know classic cocktails and serve them - along with copious knowledge and a few jokes - while donned in classic white bartender jackets from behind a huge (read 'real') bar. For a treat try a Boxcar - a scotch-based drink made with honey and smoked ice...\n\nThe bar is also one of the best bars/counters in town at which to have dinner, for which I always start with the Deviled Eggs with Truffle. Tough to beat shaved truffle on anything but on these deviled eggs it is especially a treat. I have friends who swear by their pork chop, but I am a bigger fan of their duck - served with duck sausage, greens, relish, and a wine reduction. The lobster spaghetti is amazing as well; you really can't go wrong with anything on their menu.\n\nBix is also a prime \"A\" date / night-out place, if that's your plan be sure to ask for a booth upstairs when you make your reservation. And try to make it on a night when jazz legend Mary Stallings is performing there, which she does now often - hearing her at all is a thrill, at Bix it is magic...\n\nDon't let the fact that this place has been around so long - and has been so well received - dampen your 'cool meter.'

I jokingly ordered it 'as rare as possible' and the waiter smugly replied 'in this restaurant you mean bleu'.  Understandable reply because that is how I do enjoy my steak but his tone was off putting. Long story short, my steak arrived pink, alerted my waiter, and to my best guess, he thought I was too intoxicated (1 drink at the bar) and told me that the steak was bleu.  No, it was bright pink. In the end, drinks ended up costing more than the entire meal.\n\nAnyways, props to seating us on a Friday without reservations.  Cant get past 2 stars for the overpriced drinks, snobby service and lying about the status of the food.", "author": "Patrick T."}

There is actual live jazz music playing on the first floor. The crowd is mostly middle-aged and reasonably dressed up for a San Franciscan crowd.\n\nThe waiter suggested a BIX Sidecar, which I wasn't a fan of because I only like drinks where I can't taste any alcohol. It consisted of brandy, dry curacao, and lime juice. For an appetizer we had the sampler plate, which came with Dungeness Crab Rolls, Pork Belly Banh Mi, Deviled Eggs, and House Mozzarella Skewers. To be honest only the Banh Mi stood out, it had an enormous amount of flavor packed in the meat, which left me wishing it were a tad larger than a bite. Everything else was definitely good, but not extremely unique or memorable.\n\nMy entree was the Pacific Swordfish with summer squash, basil crema, and Sicilian cherry tomato vinaigrette. The fish was a little fishier than I prefer, but the portion was fair. I also tried bites of the American Wagyu Beef and the Lobster Spaghetti - both of which I enjoyed very much. I'd recommend ordering the spaghetti most of all.

It's just so elegant, and there doesn't seem to be anything quite like it.  Armed w/ the right info, It's def worth experiencing once.   \n\nRecommend: dressing up (it's fun once -n- awhile)..... get carried away in the mood of it all, get a cocktail or two, graze on a few appetizers or share a \"proven\" main course & move on.  With this in mind, I'd come back.\n\nFood: B-\n1. Oysters (raw): A\nAs long as they're fresh, can't really go wrong with these puppies.  The Yuzu mignonette was one of the best I've had. \n2. Smoked Trout Mousse: A\n3. Truffle fries: A-\nGreat flavor, a little soggy.  Will rectify by requesting crispy\nStarted to go a little down hill from there...\n4. Veal Chop: C\nUnfortunately, I over looked the \"pounded\".  It was def pounded....  maybe floured (yuck) and the sauce reminded me of salisbury steak.   It was not bad by any means, but it wasn't very good (Especially at $42).... Not what I was expecting & not sure why something like that would even be on a menu of a place like this.  Weird.  I guess at least it was hearty...\n5. Duck Breast: B\nWell cooked, tender.  The stuffed morel mushrooms were my favorite bite of the evening.  The portion overall was small.  \n\nI have no issue with spending $$ on a meal, but the meal really needs to be better than just \"ok\". It's seems to be really hit or miss.  Being a pricey place, I'm not a fan of those odds (our bill was almost $400 for 4 people).   \n\nDrinks: B\nThe bartenders make the drink & your server brings it upstairs & shakes.

You step into a dimly lit room and find yourself stepping in sync with the bass line on your way to the table; unless you forgot to make reservations a few days in advance, then you'll be tapping your foot outside for a few hours.\n\nIt's quite loud in here. I could hear the table next to us go on and on about their sexual conquests (no joke) of their young up-and-coming real estate careers; something I didn't coordinate for our romantic anniversary dinner. The musicians also take quite frequent breaks though I believe there are two groups, one upstairs and one downstairs as there is never a moment without some sort of accompaniment.\n\nWe started off with the crab cakes, per our servers recommendation. They're a spoonful of typical crab meat/mayo mixture served over these super light, puffy sweet breads and are each about the size of a sushi roll. I figured, judging by price and description, there would be around six to eight (I was thinking sushi) but when it came to our table, either our server ate half of them on the way over, (quite possible, they were delicious!) or the actual serving size was four. The portion was even more disappointing when we learned just how good these were. So simple, but done so perfectly.\n\nNext was out entrees. I ordered these very homestyle chicken patties breaded in Pako crumbs with a mixture of peas and carrots inside. It came to the table as two patties stacked on top of each other. Presentation was laughable. I know I'm old enough where I shouldn't be playing with my food, but it looked so boring that the thought never crossed my mind once. My girlfriend ordered this New York steak and it was cooked to absolute perfection. You know when someone tells you a piece of meat is \"melt in your mouth\" and you just smile and nod at them like they're crazy because it's meat and it doesn't melt in your mouth? Well, this did. I've literally never had a steak cooked this perfectly before.\n\nWe got the banana's foster desert and that was delicious as well. It comes as a scoop of ice cream in a bowl and when you look at your server with your eyebrow raised like, \"I could have gone to Baskin Robbins for this\" she pours this heavenly mixture of hot chocolate, bananas and caramel and you dive right in, hardly looking up as you shovel it into your mouth. You might not, but I sure did and I definitely recommend it.\n\nAll-in-all I really can't give this place five-stars but I wouldn't say I experienced any atrocities that would deem them less than four-star worthy.

Maybe between then and now I had built it up too much in my mind, but this experience certainly did not live up to the last one. \n\nThere was some confusion about our reservation, which was very likely 100% my fault. Originally we were 3 people at 8:00pm, then I used opentable to switch it to 4 people at 8:30. I don't think my yelp/opentable and legit opentable are connected, because apparently the change didn't go through. I felt really bad when we showed up with 4 people at 8:30 and the only record they had was my 8:00 for 3. The hostess glazed right over the problem and reset the table, and sat us even though we were 30 minutes past the reservation. 5 stars for the hostess and her awesome flexibility, it was awesome and a great start to our meal.\n\n... And then it went downhill. We had done a happy hour with snacks prior to coming here for dinner so we weren't here for a big meal. Ordered a bottle of wine and two appetizers to start. Wine was Syrah and it was standard. I remember the potato pillows being delicious, so I ordered them again for the group. It was like a cube tater tot with some creme fraiche on it, very very unmemorable and we each got a small bite for an overpriced cost for the simplicity of the dish. We also got the ceviche - not remarkable, but good.\n\nThen when we ordered what we would be having for dinner, 3 of us got appetizers and 1 got a burger - we weren't hungry enough to order main entrees. The first person ordered a caesar, and the waiter said \"nothing else? no entree?\" and he said no. The second person (me) ordered the steak tartare, and he said the same exact thing. Third person ordered the caesar salad, and he asked the same exact thing. It felt like he was guilting us for not being extravagant.

So it's very rare that I would go to a restaurant twice. \n\nWhen my friend asked for restaurant recommendations for her birthday dinner, BIX immediately came to mind because the food was such a memorable experience. It's been over a year since I been to BIX but last night just reconfirmed WHY it's my favorite restaurant in the city. The food is deliciously tantalizing, the staff is like a well-oiled machine and the ambiance is stunningly beautiful! \n\nF O O D\n*POTATO PILLOWS w/ Creme Fraiche and Sturgeon Cavier ($15) - 5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PzPPcGVg5O4UuW5cTopJhA?select=M4W2q82ltDQ_Cr5SSwskKQ\nMy friend hit the nail on the head when she said it reminded her of tater tots but it was oh so refined. The potato pillows were fried to a golden brown and were deliciously crisp on the outside and pillowy soft and airy on the inside. The cr\u00e8me fraiche added a nice layer of creaminess and the sturgeon cavier a pop of subtle saltiness. Each bite was so orgasmic that I tried to savor each one very slowly.\n\n*BONE MARROW w/ Parsley, Shallot, and Caper Salad w/ Grilled Durum Batard ($14) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PzPPcGVg5O4UuW5cTopJhA?select=rKYL3S17CKsENppCUq2q2w\nThe bone marrow was just as good as the first time I've had it at BIX, decadently rich filled with bold condensed beefy flavors but there wasn't enough to spread on the crunchy durum bread. I love the parsley, shallot and caper salad which really help cut through the richness while adding a pop of freshness to each bite. \n\n*LLANO SECO PORK DUO w/ New Potatoes, Sweet Red Onions and Stone Fruit Chutney ($29.50) - 5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PzPPcGVg5O4UuW5cTopJhA?select=vKMmWG6TA6r7oLMo3caZGA\nNOPA and Spruce got nothing on this pork dish! The pork duo consisted of a grilled pork chop topped with fruit chutney and a pork sausage crepenette atop new potatoes and sweet red onions. \n\nThe pork chop was grilled to perfection. It so well-marbled and incredibly succulent that I could have mistaken it for a steak if I wasn't told that it was in fact pork. The fruit chutney added a sweet tang which balanced out the flavors nicely. The pork sausage crepenette was rich, savory and packed with porky flavor and spices with a hint of smokiness. The potatoes were tender yet soft and the red onions added a nice sweetness which complemented the sausage. Although there were 2 different elements, the dish was cohesive and impeccably flawless; it was SO good I could have easily licked the dish clean!\n\n*BANANAS FOSTER w/ Dark Rum and Vanilla Ice Cream ($8.75) - 5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PzPPcGVg5O4UuW5cTopJhA?select=vKMmWG6TA6r7oLMo3caZGA\nI'm not a fan of Bananas Foster but BIX has totally converted me! As the warm banana foster and dark rum was poured tableside atop the vanilla ice cream, I literally watched all the flavors and textures meld together. The banana slices were cooked to a soft tenderness that literally melted in my mouth. The deliciously sweet rum sauce married with the uber creamy vanilla ice cream creating a hot/cold concoction that was indescribably mouth-watering. *eyes roll back to the head*\n\nS E R V I C E\nOur waitress was professional, friendly, and attentive but not intrusive. The bus boy always made sure our water glasses were filled and empty plates were taken away promptly. My only gripe is our entrees took a little longer than expected to arrive (~30 minutes after we finished our appetizers). Nonetheless, BIX's service is everything you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nStunningly beautiful and romantic but it's a lot darker than I remember it to be. This time we sat downstairs which was very loud and it was especially hard to hold a conversation since the pianist was nearby. Definitely request to sit upstairs for more lighting, easier conversation and to have a view overlooking the entire restaurant. If you're looking for a place to \"woo\" her, look no further because BIX is it!\n\nP A R K I NG\nBIX is tucked away in the Gold alleyway which is one block up from Bubble Lounge towards Broadway (between Jackson and Pacific Streets). Street parking can be difficult. Valet parking is $10. \n\nIf you read my reviews, you'll know that it takes A LOT to impress me.

Bix, having been around now for 26 years now, captures the old school Rat Pack vibe with live jazz trio, mahogany panels, intimate booth seating, bartenders in white blazers, and classic art pieces on the walls - it is captures such a distinct, nostalgic ambiance that the old soul in me loves and craves.

Despite having been in business since the 80s I was surprised that it didn't feel stale and/or dated and patrons still flock keeping the place very much alive. \n\nSome might initially be put off by the entrance being located in an alley way and might even double check the street signs second guessing if this is really the restaurant's rear exit. But once you spot that neon blue Bix sign rest assured, you have arrived at the correct entrance. \n\nOnce we got inside I immediately thought \"classy\", \"upscale\" with a bit of a vintage vibe and a hint of Art Deco. High ceilings, a very large mural and large pillars are a few notables throughout the space. Unfortunately for us, there were no live entertainment during dinner the time we happened to come by. \n\nI would have liked to sit upstairs in the mezzanine level however we ended up sitting at the oddly positioned section right below it. A couple next to us kept complaining they had awful seats and declared it the THE worst in the house to their server. I silently had to agree as they were seated at one of the two tables that flanked regular seated tables. Rather than face their dining companion their seats are arranged so that they are sitting next to them and facing the side of the couples who are seated at the regular tables in between. Awkward and uncomfortable. \n\nWe enjoyed our orders and they had a vegetarian friendly option for the non-meat eaters that night. It was not printed on their menu but it was mentioned by our (friendly and likable) server before I even had a chance to ask. Perfect. Food was of American fare and although of quality it wasn't anything fancy. Actually quite perfect for Bix.\n\nI'm all for coming back. Sooner than later.", "author": "Esther A."}

Usually this wouldn't be an issue in San Francisco because it's usually not 90+ degrees, but wow was it stuffy in there last night!  \n\nThe three star review is, however, not because of the heat, but because of the service.  To be fair, the service was likely impacted by the heat in two ways: 1. the staff looked, understandably, just as miserable as many of the patrons and 2. a bottle of champagne literally exploded behind our table because of the heat and the staff seemed to be occupied apologizing to the table it belonged to.  Regardless, the service was bad.  \n\nThings started off fine, if a little rushed.  After placing our order, however our server checked in maybe once, never asked if we wanted another drink and, after we had both cleared our plates, we waited 10-15 minutes just to see our server again, let alone get a dessert menu or another drink.  We had been interested in both dessert and another cocktail, but by that point we were ready to get out of there.  Getting the bill took another 10-15 minutes even after asking for it as our server continually walked by our table, seemingly ignoring our attempts to get her attention.\n\nAs for the food, we had the mozzarella skewers (good, but seemed to be melting because of the heat), the halibut (fine), and the steak (good but overpriced).  \n\nAll in all, I think that we would come back to give Bix another try, chalking up most of the issues to the heat, but it wasn't a great first impression.", "author": "Kevin M."}

The cocktails are tasty and high-end although I had a glass of the red Lambrusco and it was great (not too sweet).\n\nI went with a few gfs for lunch on a Friday and we enjoyed a little lavishness on a few items.

The ahi dish was good but pretty small (believe it was a small plate) and didn't come with anything to eat the ahi with so didn't make it so shareable, although tasty!

Of course, I had to switch, because I started getting that scary drunk feeling where I stopped listening to everyone around me and started inwardly obsessing about whether there was any way I could get sober immediately.  Needless to say, I switched drinks.  \n\nThere is live jazz music (piano bar and singer) at BIX, and some really weird art, which is pretty cool.  We all noticed the picture of the clown kissing the ballerina.  I like this kind of weird art.  \n\nThe best part of this place is the food,  The reason for that is because they put truffle oil on EVERYTHING,  Grilled cheese?  Truffle oil.  French fries? Truffle oil.  Brussel sprouts?  Truffle oil.  We only ordered appetizers.  We had deviled eggs, (great!); meatball skewers (meh); lamb sliders (love me a lamb slider); and cashew cauliflower.  It was all good.  I would have to say the grilled cheese and the lamb sliders were my favorite.  \n\nFor dessert, we had a chocolate bread pudding, which seemed to impress everyone at our table, but I would have been more satisfied with a choco taco, no offense.  We also ordered a coconut cream pie.  It was average.  The crust wasn't crisp enough and there was definitely something missing flavor-wise.   \n\nAll in all, very good and fun for after work happy hour.", "author": "Sunny S."}

Loved the dark, intimate interior, live jazz, elegant decor. The restaurant is smaller than I expected, so noise seemed to be bouncing off all the walls, but overall I enjoyed the vibe. We had a \"2nd story\" table which provided a great view of the downstairs bar / jazz trio. \n\nI had really high expectations before going to Bix. Lobster spaghetti? Truffle burger? Sign me up! I opted for the lobster pasta, everyone seems to rave about it. For a nearly $40 dish, I was expecting more lobster. There were more tomato halves than lobster chunks, super disappointing. Also, the flavor didn't wow me. I understand the need for a light flavor panel as to not deter from the lobster, but there was hardly any lobster to begin! Sigh.\n\nMy mom's Chicken Hash a la Bix was delightful though - super rich, so not sure I could have ordered/handled an entire entree myself.\n\nOverall I hand it to Bix for atmosphere, service, presentation, and execution. If I return, I'll grab a spot at the bar and get the burger.", "author": "Brianna M."}

No one really likes the song and verse of where the cattle was raised and overly flowery descriptions of your impending meal, but a little would help. \nThe potato pillows were actually fried little hash brown squares.

Nice bar, beautiful yet dark interior. We sat on the ground floor. It was about 90 degrees in SF and pretty stuffy in the restaurant. Not too squished at our long table but everyone was breaking out their phones to read the menu - a bit too dark. Our waiter (and I'm sorry I didn't get his name) was terrific - patient, gave terrific suggestions for wine, and very attentive with a great sense of humor.\n\nWe ordered several apps for both ends of the table. The deviled eggs are amazing and the asparagus is terrific. The chicken bites are ok - tasty but nothing to write home about. We also ordered a side of the truffle fries as an appetizer - so glad we did - YUMMY!\n\nThe special was a lovely halibut with a \"raviolo\" served in a nice broth. About 75% of the table ordered it. I found it a bit too salty for my taste but others liked it. The fish was cooked perfectly - a bit crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. Two people ordered the truffled cheese burger. Looked very good, cooked as requested, good helping of crispy truffle fries with it. Two others ordered a steak, said it was good but also a bit salty. One ordered the lobster spaghetti and had trouble finding much lobster - lots of tomatoes. (I had read this on other reviews). \n\nOne of our party was celebrating a birthday and I had brought a homemade cake. Waiter brought it out with candles - perfect. They sliced and plated (for 4$ pp) and added a small scoop of ice cream to each plate - nice touch. A couple of other desserts were ordered - cr\u00e8me brulee and bread pudding. They seemed to like them - I tried the bread pudding (which is a favorite) and wasn't too impressed. Nice presentation however.\n\nWater and wine was refilled without asking. Nice as that doesn't happen much these days. Conversation was difficult as it was very loud, especially after the trio started playing. May have been better had we been sitting upstairs. Found I was a bit hoarse at the end of the evening. \n\nAll in all a nice company event.", "author": "Ronda F."}

There is a live pianist and jazz singer with the purest tone. Her beautiful scat singing almost made me forget I was in San Francisco. \n\nThe bar is well stocked, with a plethora of whiskeys.  \n\nI feel like we ordered the whole menu, or darn close to it. \n\nTruffles make me weak in the knees --- and the truffle deviled eggs and the truffle fries were AMAZING.\n\nI really don't like roe, but it brought a brightness and salinity to the potato pillows. \n\nProbably the most shocking (in a good way) was the General Tso's chicken.  Now, seems an unlikely menu item for a jazzy restaurant, right?  But good lord,  the caramelized glaze and the tenderness of the chicken was unforgettable. \n\nTo be truly honest, the appetizers outshine the entrees in my opinion.\n\nI had the fish of the day but was unimpressed.  Pan seared fish on a bed of greens topped with olives. \n\nHowever, one of my friends ordered the pork chop and was very pleased with the polenta. \n\nIn any case,  I'll be back.

We got the $28 openfaced burger which was very heavy with really delicious onion ontop of it. Might not have been \"the best burger ever\" but it was very good and one of the best in SF. A bit on the buttery side so it really depends what kind of burger you are going after. I love the minetta tavern burger in NYC but that was one even heavier. The brussel sprouts here are probably the best (I have found) in SF and the portion is very generous. They are very lemony but very crispy.

No detail in interior design is spared here.  There is a beautiful Art Deco mural spanning the length of the bar and two chandeliers hanging above from ornate medallions on the ceiling over the bar.  The upstairs booths are one of the most comfortable booths I've ever sat in.  They are lit with colorful sconces appropriate for the Art Deco theme.  \n\nThe service here is impeccable.

He cured my hiccups by telling me to exhale completely before gulping down a glass of water as fast as I could until I felt like I was \"drowning\". Thanks to him, I went from feeling irate and miserable to actually being in the mood to enjoy the swanky ambiance, down my Hibiscus Swizzle and inhale a subpar dinner. \n\nWhile the steak tartare was decent, the ceviche was borderline bland with the thinnest, most measly slices of fish.  Lame. We also tried the Black Truffle Cheese Burger, which they were nice enough to split on two plates without us asking (BIX knows what's up!). Unfortunately, the patty was under-seasoned and devoid of any truffle essence. The accompanying truffle fries were also too lightly flavored. Maybe Umami Burger has raised my standards to unrealistic levels, but BIX's version definitely needs some work if it wants to join the gourmet club.\n\nSkip the Bananas Foster dessert. I had hoped it would be ignited tableside but was disappointed when all that was brought out was some cooked banana slices in a cloyingly sweet rum syrup over ice cream.", "author": "Suany W."}

My parents are currently visiting from the U.K. ,  the first time in 10 years, so I wanted to bring them to 'the' quintessential SF restaurant. My wife ordered the Liberty Duck, which I thought was a signature BIX dish. The duck was not cooked properly - rubbery skin, un-rendered fat, poorly executed generally. Sadly trying not to cause a stir and upset my parents, she ate half her plate, but finally gave up and sent it back. BIX was cool - asked if we wanted to replace the dish and comped our dessert. Server was great. However, now we are at home and (1hour later) my wife is really sick - hold the hair back sick. Again, normally love this place but we really expect so much more.

Can't recall exactly, but we liked it then - and we still do.\n\nWe arrived a bit early and waited in the bar.  We stood near the jazz group setting up, and there was plenty of room for the 5 of us to wait.  We probably were seated about 9:15 for our 9pm reservation....but when we had arrived the hostess had let us know they were just waiting for the party at our table to pay their check. You know how that goes. So no big deal.\n\nHere's the one negative of the evening: hubby ordered a bottle of wine and failed to tell me I was going to take the sample sip (he was across and at the other end of the table from me). So when the waiter arrived with the bottle, I was apparently very involved in my conversation with my friend, and to get my attention, he touched the bottle of wine to my bare arm.  It was kinda weird. A light touch to the shoulder with your hand seems more appropriate to me. Especially in such a classy joint.\n\nTook a friend from the east coast there who is a firm meat eater.  Then there's me, seafood only, and son, vegetarian.  Hubby and daughter will eat most things. And their menu items were able to make all of us happy. Started with the potato pillows and deviled eggs, which were both delicious. Also got the truffled fries which I didn't get to try but they were gone so must have been good. The roasted cauliflower was yummy.  I got the market fish (trout that night) and the piece of fish was perfectly fine, but the deliciousness credit goes to the bed of kale and mushrooms it was on.  That could have been my whole meal. Dessert was bread pudding and bananas foster.  Don't think I'd particularly recommend the bread pudding...and the bananas foster was good, but so rich I couldn't eat more than 1/4 of it. Me. Can't. Finish. My. Dessert. That just doesn't happen so you know it's hecka rich.\n\nSat in the booth right next to the jazz band and I have to say that, while it was a little loud, it was perfectly fine and we kinda loved it.

I love deviled eggs in general but his place has one of  the best deviled eggs I've had (in my opinion, it beats Wayfare Tavern and Park Tavern). \n2. bone marrow; I have always wanted to see what the hype is about for this seemingly luxurious delicacy so we gave it a shot.

Very unique and well seasoned. Kinda different from the steak tartares I've had elsewhere but good in its own way\nAnd we still got 2 entrees after all those food haha\n7. the lobster spaghetti, it's just ok. I can pass on that\n8. the TRUFFLE BURGER!! yes, I know now it just seems like I am biased towards truffles. But I gotta give it to BIX on how they 100% deliver what they promise as far as listing truffle on their menu.(What I mean by that is, if you see on the menu a dish has truffle, you WILL taste the truffle unlike many other places.)

Bix only serves their burger during lunch, and they only open for lunch on Fridays. I made reservations for lunch one week, which was easy to do on OpenTable. The restaurant was only about half full at noon, and it wasn't too loud in the restaurant, which was really nice. We were greeted and sat right away, and opted to sit at the bar that day. The bartender was really friendly and attentive, and we ordered and received our food pretty quickly. Unfortunately, I thought the burger was overrated, and think there are a lot of better options in the city. However, I still love the vibe/ambiance at Bix, and would come back for dinner since I really enjoyed the last meal I had here. The food is definitely on the pricier side for dinner, but the it's worth it for the taste and quality.\n\nParking in this area can be tough, even during a Friday afternoon. There are a lot of metered spots, so at least you have a chance to grab a spot with some circling.

Our first visit was amazing - sat upstairs, had perfect service, delicious food, in a beautiful and lively yet romantic venue.  We happened to be dressed up (suit + nice dress) from work.  5 star visit, highly recommend. \n\nOur second visit was on a Sunday night.  I had requested an upstairs table in the reservation after loving it the week before, and when I looked at the restaurant seating system upon arrival we had indeed been placed upstairs.  We were casually dressed - jeans, sunday-afternoon type of button down shirt, a bit downscale for Bix honestly, but still presentable.  The hostess walked over, looked at us, clicked on my reservation, and moved us to a downstairs table in the system as I stood there watching.  Kind of an awkward move by her, but not worth complaining about so we didn't.  Unfortunately, it was compounded by consistently cruddy table service from a male waiter - reading other recent reviews (Ben, Phoebe) it seems like the same guy might have bugged other customers as well.  Combined with a few food duds (meh-for-the-price lobster spaghetti, prix fixe menu that is a decent bargain but underachieves compared to the awesomeness of the regular menu), probably a 2-3 star experience. \n\nIn all, this is a great restaurant and I'm planning to go back many times.  I just know now that I'll need to conform to the staff's image of a service-worthy customer if I want to enjoy myself, which bums me out enough to knock this from 4-5 to 3 stars.", "author": "Jim C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-09-14", "description": "Good tasty food. Nice warm atmosphere. Passable service. Bad management.\n\nThe atmosphere is warm, cozy, lively, with hints of a NYC establishment from the 40's or 50's. Our first waiter was polite, but lacked any enthusiasm or personality.  Luckily, another one approached us a few minutes later to take our order and he was great.  He took our order, and carefully explained to us the order in which the plates, drinks, and wine would come.\n\nThe Steak Tartare was excellent, the speed at which it came made us wonder whether it was freshly made or previously refrigerated. Regardless, it tasted great.  Our second appetizer was Oven Roasted Bone Marrow.  They were hum.. okay, a bit bland tasting.  Bone marrow tastes so much better if it has been slow cooked in a broth, then oven roasted.  Another way is to mix the marrow with spices and put them back on the bone, kind of like you do with escargots sometimes.\n\nFor the main courses, we ordered Roasted Duck and a Blanquette.  The duck was good, cooked with caramelized onions, pears, and I believe some apples as well.  The dish was very tasty, but the duck could have been cooked better, or sliced thinly. Unfortunately, the consistency felt like processed meat.  The Blanquette was very tasty, grilled to perfection with a delicious side of chimichurri sauce and potato puree.\n\nDesert was a chocolate brioche pudding which was decadently delicious.\n\nThe Malbec wine we ordered was an ideal accompaniment to the meats.  Velvety with great body.\n\nWhile the meal was good, it was not up to par, especially considering the high price range ($30-40 per entree).  \n\nHowever, the real issue and reason behind the 3 star rating is the poor service and management which started well, and precipitously declined as our meal was progressing:\n\n- The first waiter. It was either a bad day, or he wanted to be somewhere else. He brought us the check before we asked for it, and without asking if we wanted coffee or if we were done.\n\n- The \"Terminator\" - hold on to your plates, spoons, or glasses. The Terminator will snatch them away the second after you are done, or think you are done.  If you so much look like you're done with your plate or apetizer, boom! the plate's gone, nevermind or not if your friends are still eating. Same for your drinks, and because the place is dark, the Terminator won't see that last piece in your plate or drop in your glass.\n\n- The Manager (the guy in the over-sized grey suit) - wow, this one's a winner. At first we thought he was just a little too jolly and folksy.  Then we wondered if he hadn't sampled too many glasses of wine beforehand.  Happiness was unfortunately not what transpired.  After trying to take away my plate before my friend had finished, at the end of our meal, he made sure we knew (repeatedly) we should vacate the table after the check landed.\n\nOn that subject, and once we were done with desert, our first waiter simply slapped the check on the table, boom!  No asking if we were still going to order coffee, if we were done, not even saying 'thank you.'  Fortunately, we were in a good mood so we simply laughed.  What else to do when a waiter is an ambulant catastrophe?\n\nMy friend and I were still chilling, having a good conversation, and slowly finishing our drinks.  That didn't seem to sit well with the manager who kept sending us every staff member to tell us \"thank you for coming\" (roughly translated to get the f*$# out).  At one point, he even came himself to \"thank us\" for coming, while we were still sitting and enjoying our conversation.  That was the last straw.\n\nWhile the setting is very warm and definitely has lots of mid-century charm, the food did not match the price levels, and neither did service which was simply appalling and downright rude at the end.  Unless the latter drastically improves, I would absolutely not recommended Bix to friends or colleagues.  I have hope it will if owners are reading and care.", "author": "Stefan R."}

While waiting, tried their signature cocktails at the bar: Manhattan and (forgot the name but) the one with bourbon, honey and smoked ice mixed drink, which I REALLY loved, had to order 2 more :)\nThen we got seated at the best table (the middle of the 2nd floor, overlooking EVERYTHING of the restaurant, quite nice). They placed a little note 'Happy Birthday' for my husband, which again I thought was a nice surprise.\n\nBUT! That was it. us big eaters ordered about 3 appetizers and 2 entrees, the waiter maybe couldn't believe what he just heard because the entrees never came out even when we finished the appetizers. By that time, though, we thought it was actually better because the food wasn't really impressive. They had to put sliced/baked/any some sort of bread on the side of EVERY dish, except the salad, which I thought it looked kind of cheap. We would be fine with having just the food if it's good enough. So the presentation was off. \n\nAnd the waiter was VERY slow, asked for a whiskey menu which he never brought out, and I could see in his face that he wasn't really focused on what we were saying, apparently his mind was occupied with some other table he had to serve. \n\nSo, as a conclusion, food and service was just a okay at the best.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-04-09", "description": "Came here for my birthday, being a bit fancy in SF, looking forward to delicious food. BIX is located within a little alleyway, away from the hustle and bustle of downtown SF life. The restaurant is quite large, with an upper deck with additional seating, a large bar, and a mini grand piano on the main floor.\n\nBIX became a mixed bag of hits and misses, ultimately leading to an underwhelming [birthday/dining] experience.\n\nOdd: BIX is the only restaurant I know where a waiter comes to your table and plops a little bread role onto your bread plate. No plate of bread to pick apart and share. Just a 1 bread/person policy...\n\nAmusing: BIX is also the only restaurant where the waitress comes to you with [some] already made cocktails... and some which she brings in a shaker, shakes it for you, and then pours it into your glass.\n\nClumsy: I ordered my first drink, and the waitress came to serve my drink. She vigorously shook it, and when moving in to serve, almost dropped the entire shaker (luckily she only dropped the cap).\n\nWeak & not worth it: Throughout the dinner, I ordered two drinks. A BIX 'Perfect' Manhattan and an Old Fashion. Both cocktails were horribly underwhelming and weak. You get a watered down texture to it, and it doesn't come close to being spirit forward. For them to call it the 'Perfect Manhattan'...shame on them! I also tried my girlfriend's Huckleberry fizz, and it was horribly syrupy. Her Blossom Dearie was also not the best drink on the list...\n\nTasty: The Lobster Spaghetti was a nice saving grace to our dinner - a silver lining that was well appreciated. Good amounts of lobster, and the pasta was not overcooked. Cherry tomatoes provided some tart/sweet notes to the dish. My girlfriend's duck breast was also quite tasty - nice and tender - some pretty well prepared duck.\n\nNice: The mini grand piano was a refreshing bit to the restaurant. As the dinner crowd came in, a pianist provided some lovely music to set the tone of the lively restaurant.\n\nSigh: Surprise, it was my birthday, and my girlfriend surprised me with one of their desserts: the bananas foster. I sigh at this 'surprise' because of the fact that they charge you for the dessert. Even though it's your birthday... you are basically ordering dessert. The only difference is that they give you a candle. For the amount we paid for all our food... they could loosen up and provide a free birthday dessert. Also, this scoop of vanilla ice cream with bananas and rum cost $10. Not worth it... for this bowl of diabetes.\n\nMy dinner was quite disappointing, and now that I've visited once, I doubt I'll return. If you come across BIX on Yelp, you've been warned. There is an average of 4 stars, but don't be surprised if your dinner takes a turn for the worst...", "author": "Kevin J."}

Friday afternoons (the only time they're open for lunch) and Sunday evenings are my favorite times to sit back and relax. No crowd, just me, Peter, and a cocktail.\n\nGranted, the entrees aren't the best (nor is the variety of dessert offerings), but the hor d'oeuvres are to die for (I often opt for a tapas-style meal here).

Love at first sight.  To have an authentic Bix experience, you don't even need to eat.  Everything about Bix is a winner.  From the clandestine location in Gold Alley, to the staircase, to the famous mural above the bar, to the even more famous clown/ballerina painting...you get the gist.  Grand & majestic.  Beautifully refined.  It's like you've walked into a Thin Man film, & Nick & Nora will be walking in any minute to their table.  Known for power martinis & mover & shaker meetings, merely having a drink here is an experience.  But, have dinner too?  BOOM!  Dine downstairs for premiere people watching.  Have dinner upstairs for a bit more privacy.  Having been patronizing Bix for over 20 years now, I can tell you that I've never had anything other than a great meal here.  Ever.  Meat or fish?  You won't be disappointed.  I'm partial to duck, pork, & all things trufflesque (yeah, I just made that word up), so they tend to be my go to dishes.  Truffle burger w truffle fries, I'm in.  Piano music in the background, great drink, delish food...you're guaranteed an unforgettable & romantic time.  Even in this day of Chiarello, Florence, & Patterson restos being all the buz, Bix is a must.  A must.  Do it.", "author": "Veronica M."}

Perk: they have valet parking.\n\nTwo story building with an airy ambiance, 40's style with jazz music playing in the background.  Elegant and classic.  There was a hiccup with my reservations which kind of upset me knowing that I specifically came here to celebrate a special occasion.  I requested their best table and ended up sitting next to the kitchen entrance. \n\nRight away, our server knew I was disturbed and immediately remedied the situation by offering us a free appetizer and dessert of our choice.  That made me feel better.\n\nIn a nutshell, the food was exquisite. Come here if you want quality of food versus quantity.  It's about tasting each and every bite and by the time your finished with your plate, you are more than full. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nAppetizers - \nPotato Pillows: 4 mini bite size tater tots with a bit of cavier on top.  Light, crispy, and undenialby delicious.\n\nChilled Foi Gras with strawberries - yes, I know it's inhumane to  force feed a duck and before it's banned, I decided to try it! OMG!!! IT'S SINFUL!!!  The best duck pate hands down! The texture was soo creamy and it tasted like butter.  It was incredible!\n\nMain dishes -\nFresh Fish of the day - Salmon. Moist and tender, seasoned, and topped with finely chopped onions and relish (I think) which gave it a bit of a tart taste. It complimented the fish very nicely.\n\nGrilled duck - tasted like steak and SUPER TENDER.  \n\nSide order-\nFrench fries with truffle oil - dangerous. I couldn't get enough of it.\n\nDessert: \nBananas Foster with Dark Rum and vanilla ice cream.  This was probably my least favorite only because I was sooo stuffed, I couldn't bare to take more than one bite.  \n\nDrinks are made right - with perfection.  Our server was impeccable!

Cherylynn N. made an 8pm reservation here for our party of three for Friday, March 26, 2010. \n\nAMBIANCE:  As we walked in, this place looked fantastic!  The restaurant is bigger than what it appears from the outside.  You're greeted by the hostess area and a little beyond that is a full and large bar.  The restaurant gives off a 1940s retro theme and even has a live band.  We got lucky and had a table upstairs where we were able to overlook the restaurant as well as the bar area.  This is not a quiet conversation restaurant, do not expect to speak quietly.\n\nFOOD:\n-Steak Tartare ($13.95) - I NEVER eat anything raw, but it looked good and for once, I tried something new and liked it!  The steak tartare is freshly prepared at your table and comes in with small pieces of crispy toasts. (photo)\n\n-Dungeness Crab Rolls ($15.75) - I will admit that I thought it was going to look differently and I was quite surprised when it came out looking like a cut up sandwich, but once I bit into the roll, it was delicious!  It did taste similar to a crab salad sandwich, but the crab and the bread it came on perfectly complimented each other.  (photo)\n\n-Marrow Bones ($11.75) - YUM!  Four marrow bones were presented on a plate along with a parsley, shallot and caper salad, crispy toasts, and an upside down shot glass which contained salt.  I've never seen bone marrow on a menu and I recommend this as a starter! (photo)\n\n-Fresh Maine Lobster Spaghetti with Lobster Cream ($39.95) - If you're a pasta lover like myself, I HIGHLY recommend trying this dish.  Generous portions of perfectly cooked lobster is mixed in with the noodles with a light cream sauce.\n\nSERVICE:  A little higher than decent.  As two of us sat down and waited for our other friend to arrive, it took our waiter a couple minutes to acknowledge us.  It seemed as if there were only two waiters upstairs, split among 10 tables or so.\n\nPARKING:  Free metered street parking after 6:00pm but often quite difficult to score, valet parking at BIX is available through the Gold Street alley, and there are many paid lots around the Broadway Street area.\n\nCash and credit cards accepted.", "author": "Nicole S."}

So, ready for this story? I get news I need to be in SF for work during my bf's 30th birthday, he elects to come along for the ride all the way from New Jersey. I fret for a week before going - what are we going to do for his special day? I don't know SF and I really want to do something special for him. What's a girl to do? Thank the mighty lord everyone in my office in NYC is from SF so they all give me their tips and insight, I have been scouring Yelp for hours at this point.  Finally, I look to a cool chica in my office, I like her styz, I think she understands my concept (memorable, dude dinner, not too fancy but EPIC). She replied confidently BIX. I went for it.  I told the reservationist that it was my man's 30th bday so make it epic.\n\nThat is what they did. We got a great table right near the piano and live vocalist (love me some jazz while I dine) on the first floor. There was a little card to my man wishing him well on his birthday. (Handwritten might I add). The decor is like 1930s NYC speakeasy/prohibition dining hall.  With some fantastic art on the walls, and a dark wooded bar perfect for a Manhatten or Sazerac.  The restaurant itself is 2 floors; the top floor overlooking the diners on the first floor. Our waiter, whose name I forgotten was amazing. Truly. He was a true professional, friendly and just all around swell guy.\n\nWe started off with drinks off their cocktail menu, and moved on to the ceviche and the foie gras to start. The ceviche was so fresh and they plated everything separately as we were sharing so, there was enough sauce and fish for both of us.  The roll they provide was hot and fresh, seemingly right out of the oven. The foie gras was more of a pate that came with some delicious baguette. I enjoyed both thoroughly and would order again.\n\nWe moved onto the main plates. We were full at this point but we elected to go with the flounder with crab meat and the famous BIX truffle burger with truffled cheese and truffle fries. Holy truffle right? Both were amazing. I did like the fish better with its rich and buttery meat with the added flavor of the crab but, the burger was one of the best burgers I have ever had (for $30 it better be).  But, for reals, the truffle cheese and the truffle in the burger combo was amazing. I sometimes feel like when one orders something truffly one never truly taste the truffle; this was not the case with this burger. Every bite had this crazy intense flavor, which I am chalking up to yes, you guessed it, the truffle.\n\nTipsy from copious amount of wine and drinks, our server provides us the dessert menu in which we ordered. I completely forgot what we ate, wow the wine definitely got me but, there was a candle and it was awesome. I believe it was a chocolate mouse type desert. And though I don't remember it, I do remember being in love with it at that particular moment.\n\nOverall, this place might not be the fanciest restaurant in SF but, it may be one of the most memorable. My bf and I felt special, we were happy and super duper in love and the food was amazing. Isn't that what life is supposed to be about?", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

He grunted, as if to show us he was annoyed, and walked away. \n\nOur party was pretty talkative for the first 20 minutes or so and hadn't even glanced at the menu yet. So our waiter took it upon himself to adjust my boyfriend's menu super passive aggressively without saying a word. What?!\n\nLater, when clearing our appetizer plates, he was being so forceful that he knocked over a full wine glass. Thank goodness my dad was holding onto it (in anticipation of this loose-cannon waiter). The wine spilled mostly on the ground and on the waiter's pants. Instead of apologizing, he mumbled \"you're welcome\" and stormed off seemingly to cool down. When he came back, my dad asked him to take it easy and told him that his aggressiveness was a bit overwhelming. The waiter fired back with sarcasm in his tone, saying \"thank you sir, I am very calm.\"\n\nAs for the food. Meh. If you do happen to go, DON'T get the lobster spaghetti.

We had a reservation but were ~20 minutes late, and they couldn't seat us right away, which was fine. We had a drink at the bar while they prepared the table. Was somewhat annoying that we had to close out at the bar vs transferring the drink over to our table, but not a huge deal. I got the elixir 3 and it was very good - not too sweet and nicely balanced. One of my colleagues really enjoyed his old fashioned as well.\n\nPretty soon after we were seated, the waiter came over to describe the menu. Really nice guy and did a great job walking through the menu and offering recommendations, as well as describing the fish of the day. \n\nWe ended up going with 5 starters: fried chicken, \"ceviche\", crab rolls, arancini, and deviled eggs. All were very good - the best in my eyes were the crab rolls and deviled eggs, though my colleagues liked the chicken and arancini more.\n\nFor mains, I ordered the lobster spaghetti, and others ordered the swordfish and wagyu. The lobster spaghetti was good though a little bland - think there were too many tomatoes, though the sauce itself was really nice, and the pasta was cooked perfectly. There was a good amount of lobster meat... though obviously I'd always want more! My colleague finished his swordfish very quickly so I think it was well received. The wagyu was apparently a bit fatty (both my colleagues complained about that), though I think still pretty good.\n\nFor desert, we shared the brioche bread pudding, cheesecake brulee, and chocolate cookies. They were all good though nothing was outstanding. The cookies were probably the best, but again, more in the \"good\" range than great.\n\nOverall service was great and the ambiance was really nice as well with the live music.

The oysters were a-ok, kind of small, was probably because of the type of oysters.  We got the dungeness crab rolls (good), potato pillows (kind of like hashbrowns with creme fraiche and caviar on top - it was a-ok), and we split the short ribs with bone marrow, vegetables and toast (the short ribs were tender and tasty, the bone marrow was a thicker consistency than my friend was expecting, my first time eating it so I wasn't sure what to expect).  \n\nThe dessert was REALLY good though - banana foster with dark rum and vanilla ice cream.

The ceiling was still way above my head even on the second floor. It felt more like a balcony seating rather than a 2nd floor, since it was open to see the 1st floor.\n\nThe place was bustling for a wednesday night at 8pm. They had a bar that sat about 12-15 people and few tables on the bottom floor. The open stairs led to a 2nd floor balcony style that had about 20 tables/booths as well. \n\nI even thought that this venue would be a great place to have a private party! Piano included! \n\nNow to the food. Potato Pillows.... OMG orgasmic, it was a fancy tater tot. Who doesn't love tater tots? it was perfectly fried, crispy on the outside and I didn't even taste or feel the oil that is was fried in. You know how sometimes when you eat something fried, you can feel the oil seep out of the morsel of food into your mouth and you're disgusted cause you swear you want to believe that you're eating something semi healthy. BUT when you feel that oil in your mouth you know you're going to see the extra cottage cheese on your thighs the next day? well none of that with these potato pillows. AND the Creme Friache was the the perfect balance. I was a bit sad that they didn't put more caviar on it but I'll take what they give me. This is a must try dish!\n\nFoie Gras was refrigerated and served with a grilled bread. Not a crostini but just bread. It was lightly oiled and it went well with the foie gras.

I had reservations for 10 people and when we got there the table wasn't ready...even though we told Bix Restaurant ahead of time that its a surprise dinner for a friend. So it took an extra 20mins to get the table set up. The dinner menu is limited as well as the drink menu. I ordered the ceviche dish as an appetizer. I wasn't satisfied with the way it tasted. For the amount that the ceviche was...it wasn't worth ordering again. For my main course I ordered the chicken hash. As I took my first bite of the chicken hash the food had a piece of hair in it. The downfall of that part is I couldn't see what I was eating because it was very dimly lit. :/ My date ordered the truffle cheeseburger. That dish was amazing. Everything was perfect on that dish plus great sauces!", "author": "Marjorie F."}

I figured you were more of a tourist spot, where the food and service take a back seat to the atmosphere.  Boy, was I wrong.  \n\nWe celebrated a birthday there, and the attentive, polished staff went above and beyond to make it special, from giving us the best table in the house, to the hand-written birthday card, to the warm birthday wishes from every staff member we encountered.  \n\nThe food was equally impressive.  Everything was well-prepared, expertly seasoned, and delicious.  There was nothing that we didn't like or were even neutral on.  My favorite tastes of the evening were the Pisco Sour, with a single, huge bitters-infused ice cube, Smoked Trout Salad, Sea Bass, Potatoes in Duck Fat (!!!) and Bananas Foster.

The Satsuma Driver was refreshing and the Blood Orange Margarita was tasty.  We started with the Potato Pillows with Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche and American Sturgeon Caviar, Deviled Eggs with Truffles, Radish and Chives, Dungeness Crab Rolls in Brioche with Meyer Lemon Aioli, Chilled Foie Gras with Spiced Kumquats and a caesar salad.   A lot of food for three but what the hell!  It might be sacrilege to say this but the potato pillows reminded me of fancy, gourmet tater tots.  Truly delicious. The spiced kumquat sauce was so yummy, I asked for extra hot rolls so we could continue to enjoy it.\n\nFor our entree, two of us ordered the Bix Chicken Hash with Mascarpone & Cherry Tomato Sauce and one ordered the Grilled Duck Paillard with Spring Onions, Fingerling Potatoes and Foie Gras Sauce.  Two orders of the Creamed Organic Bloomsdale Spinach were shared by the table.  All of it was delicious.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the macerated strawberries with meringue pieces that was the special dessert that night and the Warm Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding.  Both came with a huge dollop of cream.  Devoured by the table.\n\nThe jazz started in the middle of the meal and was lovely.  Before the set started, the noise could get a bit loud.\n\nI would have given this experience 4 stars but had to take away a star because our party was seated at the only freestanding table up on the 2nd level (all the others on this level were booths) and it was next to the service door.  There was a draft each time the door was used.  This was especially felt by the person at our table wearing a turtleneck!  We asked to be moved but the manager said the restaurant was booked solid and his response instead was to raise the temperature.  \n\nIt didn't help.  \n\nFor the rest of the meal, I also watched a guest at a nearby booth drape her jacket over her shoulder.  Another thing that didn't help was Bix was only half full when we made the request.  We could easily have been moved to a booth at that time especially since later they would seat parties of two into ones that could have easily fit our party.", "author": "J. P."}

Seriously, with our expansive view of the lower dining room, we watched two semi-awkward dates between silver-haired couples. But don't let this discourage you.

We could've ordered four dozen and would've been OK with it.\n-House mozzarella skewers wrapped in prosciutto: like a savory lollipop and surprisingly delicious.\n+American wagyu bavette with grilled and pickled ramps over a potato puree: requested medium rare, but it was more medium to medium well. That's OK as it was delicious anyway.\n+Lobster spaghetti with cherry tomatoes, jalape\u00f1os and basil: had a bite of this and everything about it was fresh and pleasing. Heard no complaints from the folks inhaling it (and I don't blame them).\n+Duck breast with stuffed morel mushrooms, fava beans, served over a citrus confit: I tried a bite and still can't get over my anti-poultry tastebuds, but my dining companion had zero complaints.\n\nDESSERT:\n+Bananas Foster: dark rum with vanilla ice cream. Turned into liquid gold within a few minutes and was cloyingly sweet. Fortunately, that wasn't a problem for the person who'd ordered it. \n+Warm chocolate brioche bread pudding: I asked for a scoop of ice cream in place of the whipped cream. It was basically chocolate soup in a bowl. Warm and incredibly sweet, but quickly tiresome after a few bites.\n+Chocolate mouse served with a raspberry coulis: far less sweet than the bread pudding with a good amount of tartness from the coulis.

What's better than having the restaurant where I had my birthday dinner at as my 300th?? \n\nFIRST: Thank you Cherylynn N., for suggesting that I have my birthday dinner BIX, awesome suggestion!! =) \n\nAPPETIZERS\nPOTATO PILLOWS w/ Creme Friache and American Sturgeon Caviar- OMG, this has to be the best thing I have ever put in my mouth (that's what she said). It reminded me of tater tots but it 100 times better than that frozen stuff. =X The creme friache added a nice creamy compsition to the crispy exterior and pillow like interior and the caviar added just the right amount of salitness. I NEED TO COME BACK TO BIX FOR THESE POTATO PILLOWS!! *DROOLS* If I could, I'd come here every single day for the rest of my life for these potato pillows!\n\nMARROW BONES w/ parsley, shallot and caper salad and grilled durum batard- the marrow tasted exactly how bone marrow should taste, rich and bursting with flavor. Too bad there wasn't enough of it to spread on the batard, dammit!! The caper salad was a bit salty and if you put too much of it on top of the marrow, it masked the rich flavors of the marrow BUT nonetheless it was a very good dish.\n\nDINNER\nBLACK TRUFFLE CHEESE BURGER served open face on rye w/ truffle fries- Let me just say that this was a FREAKIN' GOOD BURGER!! I love black truffles and to stick it in between a burger and bun is just plain genius. The patty was juicy and cooked to perfection, I asked for medium rare and that's exactly what I got! The truffle added the perfect balance of saltiness to the burger and each bite of the juicy patty and black truffle was heavenly. The truffle fries were crunchy on the outside and soft and airy on the inside, they were seasoned perfectly and I think I may have gotten full as fast as I did all thanks to the fries (I could not stop eating them). \n\nTHERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR DESSERT\nBANANAS FOSTER w/ dark rum and vanilla ice cream- I love bananas foster so when we got our dessert menus, my eyes kept going back to this. The warm bananas and sauce was poured over vanilla ice cream table side and looked oh so good!! There's something about bananas foster brings a sense of comfort, it's like a home away from home. \n\nPOLITE & FRIENDLY = A++\nOur waitress was very polite, friendly and very well spoken. She was attentive and checked up on us every now and then to make sure everything was okay. The bus boy who I might add was very polite as well, he made sure that our empty plates were taken away and made sure our glasses were full. Also, he excused himself every time he reached in front and across us, thank you for being so polite!! =) \n\nCONCLUSION \nI will definitely be back and I'll make sure of it because I need to get my hands on those potato pillows again, those things are so addicting (it must have crack in it, it must)!! The service was excellent and as was the food, both aspects having me want to come back for more! BIX is one of my favorite restaurants in the city and anyone who asks me for a restaurant recommendation, will be recommended BIX. =)\n\nYOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE LAST OF ME BIX, YOU AND YOUR POTATO PILLOWS AND MARROW BONES WON'T BE AND AREN'T SAFE FROM ME! =X", "author": "Heather C."}

The rye bun is a poor choice for a burger the texture is tough and the taste is bitter.

The cocktails are original and creative, but the wine list and dessert wine lists are also extensive and not unreasonably priced considering the environment. The dinner menu is well curated and not overwhelming --- the specials are also usually intriguing whether I've indulged or not. \n\nThe open-faced burger is an interesting take and I've ordered it at least half of the times I've visited ---- it's a simple dish, but it's delicious and quite filling. \n\nWith respect to the music, they usually start at around 8p (on weekends, not sure about week nights), and, so as to prevent any confusion here, we are talking about mostly string jazz (piano, cello, bass guitar), not brass jazz, though I think they mix it up. And the music is great, just do not expect your request to hear the next John Coltrane over your steak. \n\nThe service is very accommodating --- like an offensive line in football, the best restaurant service is the service you only notice if it's doing something wrong. I don't mean that in a negative sense, the attention is personal, but only to the extent that you want it to be. \n\nAs a youngish looking mid twenty something I'd also like to give kudos to this place for not having an attitude about hosting \"under 30\" guests -- that may sound ridiculous but it's not. \n\nLast, major kudos to the service for finding a way, without a prior reservation, on a Friday evening in May, to seat my family and my fiance's family (8 total), after we had a mishap at another establishment earlier in the evening.

Since I love jazz music, and am a fan of trying out new places, I was in.  Reservations are the way to go--we had a table ready for us when we arrived. We stopped by the bar before being seated to allow the rest of our party to arrive. I have a lot I can say about this place, but will try to keep it short.  \n\n1. Atmosphere--Don't let the alley like entrance fool you... the small neon sign marking the entrance to this place is like a beacon to times past.  The venue is small but not stuffy, with an elegant staircase leading to a balcony/terrace second level of intimate tables which wraps along the edge of the restaurant just high enough above the main and slightly crowded lower floor. A corner of the first floor by the kitchen was reserved for the live jazz group--which began to set up as we arrived, and was in full swing before we left.  I had the feeling that Frank Sinatra or Rosemary Clooney would have been at home here. \n\n2. Food--the ingredients and presentation stole the show.  This meal was my first time trying caviar or black truffles.  I wasn't as fond of the caviar as I was the black truffles... which was nestled on creme fraiche and potato pillows (which was eerily like fancy tater tots with sour cream), and just added a jelly-salty consistency. But they were very pretty tater tots... For dinner, I had the black truffle cheeseburger (I know..I know..ordering a cheeseburger here, but I was very happy with my choice) with garlic/black truffle flavored french fries. The earthiness of the truffle and the sweetness of the perfectly caramelized onion on the burger was a divine combination. And I have never had better fries(especially paired with their house aioli)!  Most of my colleagues ordered the lobster macaroni--which greatly impressed them.\n\n3. Service--impeccable. The wait staff was knowledgeable about the different menu selections, attentive to beverage levels and service needs, and charming as well.  They made the beautiful atmosphere, great music, and delightful food come together to create a wonderful dining experience.  \n\nI look forward to taking my husband here the next time we're in town--but I'm definitely going to request a table on the upper balcony next time. I drop this place down one star ONLY for how crowded the first floor tables feel when the place reaches capacity.  Everything else was wonderful.", "author": "Tashara H."}

Tucked away in an alleyway of SF, this jazz-themed hip restaurant makes you feel like you're in a 1920s film upon entrance. \n\nIt was hard to decide on what to order, since I'm guessing the menu changes often. I really wanted the bavette steak, but I only found the steak tartare on the menu. Between two people, we shared the provolone wrapped in prosciutto, deviled eggs, steak tartare, truffle fries and the bix burger. The highlight was definitely the deviled eggs. Simply delectable and so well-executed. Anyway, this was WAY too much for two people to handle. Lesson learned. \n\nEach dish came out one after another; the time between our appetizers first course and main course were so widely spread out that we had fully digested by the time we got our burger. Though the burger was good, it was torturous just trying to finish half of it. \n\nTip: Don't order more than you can handle. Favorites of the night were the deviled eggs and truffle fries.

The host was extremely rude and not at all professional about this. He did not make us feel welcomed, telling me we would have a problem if they didn't arrive soon(and not in a nice or gentle way at all). This was at 615. Most of our party was sitting down by 625 or so. \n\nWhen I walked out of the restaurant I smiled at him to try to make peace and leave on a good note, and he snickered at me. There are many, many restaurants in SF in which you can pay a lot less, and have a much better vibe from the staff. The Waiter was fine,but not at all warm or funny--just all business.

I also appreciate that this is a throwback to the 20s as far as decor, tablecloths, well-dressed servers, and with the grand piano, live music, this is a classy restaurant so it's got good ambience for a special occasion.  But a couple of my friends have raved about this place for ages and say it's one of their favorite restaurants in the city, so my expectations were set high.  While the highlights were the decor and drinks (and the fact that they have a valet given the neighborhood), the meal seemed overpriced since the food wasn't as good as I'd expect for a fine dining restaurant.   It is also quite hard to have a conversation because the live music is loud.  I had the pork belly buns and the lobster spaghetti, both of which were pretty good, just not great.  Friends ordered the lobster bisque, potato pillows, and dungeness crab rolls for appetizers and the steak and several orders of salmon and their other fish special.  With a couple of bottles of wine, it ended up around $100 pp.  I'd try it again to see if it was just an off night, although based on some of the recent Yelp reviews, maybe it wasn't.  \n\nThe bar was a great place to meet up before being seated - I can see why this is a popular hangout for the financial district crowd.", "author": "Vivian W."}

There's a few entrees, a few appetizers, and salads. Their wine list is very long and I'd love to try all of the wines someday :) \n\nThe service is amazing. Robert helped us and he was so accommodating and helpful. We gave our car to the valet but didn't have the exact change. He actually gave the money out of his own pocket and we definitely returned the favor by tipping well, which he deserved! I'm allergic to crawfish, so he was very skeptical about letting me order the Lobster Spaghetti (which is the best spaghetti I've ever had) and kept warning me about it multiple, which was a very sweet thing to do. I went ahead and ordered it, and I'm sitting here with hives on arms but good food in my tummy. I'd eat it again any day despite my allergy! It's that good. \n\nOther than that, we had Potato Pillows, Bix Fried Chicken, and Chicken Hash.

I prefer the taste to be more defined and each component of my meal to have a distinct flavor. \n\nI had pork shoulder and belly and had to think a bit before I could tell which was which. Both cuts tasted pretty similar. I also tried the duck breast. Once again the taste was homogenous and the entire dish was mixed. Peppers and Creamed spinach as sides were simply that. There would be nothing different between having these at BIX and having them at any other dining establishment.\n\nTrout tartare had orange zest glaze on it which did not complement the fish at all. \n\nThe setting is great. Beautiful building, just the right amount of light and great live music. This is also one of the few places in the city were people dress up.", "author": "Marianna P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-02-04", "description": "After reading all of the great reviews, I was hoping that I would be giving BIX a higher rating than 2 stars.  However, when I look at the rating definitions, between \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" and \"A-OK\", I have to go with \"Meh.  I've experienced better\".  Here are some reasons why:\n\nWe had a reservation for 7 people at 6:00 PM on a Friday.  Two of us showed up a bit before 6, and grabbed a cocktail at the bar.  One Sidecar and one BIX Perfect Manhattan cost over $30 with tax and tip, which normally I would be fine with.  However, the drink glasses are tiny.  I literally could have taken 2 sips and my drink would have been gone.  After a while passed, 2 other guests showed up right around reservation time.  I had heard from the additional 3 guests that they would be arriving about 30 minutes late.  Given the amount of time it would take them to arrive, I approached the host to discuss options.  The host immediately stated that he would not be able to seat us until the entire group had arrived.  However, if they would not arrive for 30 minutes, he would not be able to seat us at all.  I told him that I understand their policy, and that if he was worried about revenue, that all 7 of us would be ordering drinks, appetizers, and entrees, and if he was worried about timing, I let him know that the 4 of us would order appetizers, and the remaining 3 guests would catch up when they arrived so that we would not take more than the normal amount of time.  To this the host replied that there is an \"implicit agreement\" when you make a reservation that the entire party will be there on time to be seated.  I agreed, but stated that \"life happens\" sometimes, and people become delayed.  He finally admitted that the reason he would not seat us is that they had a hard reservation at 8:30 PM.  I told him that we would have to leave by 7:30 / 7:45 at the latest as we were attending a show at 8:00 PM.  After this, he agreed to seat the 4 of us.  In the long run, I wish that he would have just stated from the beginning that we would have to be out by 8:15 for his hard reservation at 8:30...the entire conversation would have ended there as we had to be gone by 7:45 at the latest.\n\nThe food:  We really loved the appetizers.  The truffle deviled eggs were so good that we ordered a second plate so that all of our party could try them.  The mozzarella / prosciutto wraps were delicious with a hint of olive oil and cracked pepper.  The fried chicken was tangy and spicy, and very tasty.  I did not try the Arancini, but the table enjoyed them.  For entree's, 2 of us ordered the $28 truffle burger, 3 ordered the lobster spaghetti, 1 ordered the chicken hash, and 1 ordered the New York strip.  The hamburgers were underwhelming to say the least.  The truffle flavor was powerful and rich, which was nice, but my meat was overcooked.  The other guests's burger did not taste much of truffle at all, and for $28, he had expected more.  Reviews on the lobster spaghetti and chicken were \"meh\",  The steak was delicious, perfectly cooked, and totally worth $42.\n\nThe service at the table was great.  The server was aware of our time constraints, and helped us get out the door when we needed to by giving us queues on when we should order, taking early orders, etc.  I would go back to BIX to give it one more try, as I never like to completely give up on a restaurant for one experience.  Hopefully at that point, I can update my rating.  Also, for the out-of-towners who claim that this is the \"must go to\" restaurant in San Francisco, you are sorely mistaken.", "author": "Nick T."}

I appreciated the nice touch. \n\nFood:\n- steak tartare: 5 stars- yummmmmy! I loved the flavors... and didn't taste so \"raw\". must get this appetizer. They prepare it in front of you. \n- chicken hash: 4 stars- pretty good- had cheese inside and flavors went well together.\n- duck: 4.5 stars- I loved this! Probably the best non asian duck I've ever had. The meat was tender and flavorful and I loved the sauce that went with it. \n- coconut cream pie: 3.5 stars- the filling was good but the crust was too stiff! Made it hard to eat and the crust tasted a bit stale. \n\nService:\n- We came here at 6:30p on a Saturday when it wasn't very busy, but by 7:30p it was poppin and filling up. Service got slower as a result and we had to wait longer than I would have liked to order dessert. However, the server was friendly and service overall was good. \n\nTip:\nMake reservations in advance! I made reservations 2 weeks in advance and wasn't able to get the times I wanted (7:30-8pm) but was able to get 6:30p. I think theres a live jazz band around 9 so 8-8:30p would probably be ideal times. Not a restaurant you can make reservations at the day of (at least not on a Sat night) as only 10p was available when I checked the day of.", "author": "Emily C."}

That said, I think I would prefer to come back here for dinner over lunch  (the ambiance seems better suited for dinner).  \n\nIt's a two-story restaurant with very dim lighting, dark corners, a 1940s/ \"old boys club\" feel (dark-wood paneling, drinks shaken at the table, and jazz playing in the background) -- somehow Bix's ambiance seems more appropriate for dinner or if you want lunch, then maybe some covert rendez-vous (business deal? affair? who knows).  \n\nIn terms of food, our table of four shared three appetizers: half dozen oysters, steak tartare, and bite-sized gin-cured trout blinis.  Our oysters, while fresh, had rocks in them; the tartare was good; the gin-cured trout literally tasted like gin (I guess I should've known) - regardless, the taste of alcohol was too overpowering for me.  I'd be interested in trying the bahn mi appetizer.  For my entree, I ordered the swordfish (while the fish was cooked well, the flavors were lacking and dish overall was kind of bland).   In retrospect, maybe I should have ordered the chicken hash (it's what everyone seems to be raving about, but I wasn't craving something fried).    \n\nFor dessert, the banana foster with dark rum was phenomenal -- not too rich, perfect portion size, and something I would definitely order again.\n\nI wavered between three and four stars, but rounded up because the server was great and I think a dinner adventure here would deliver at least four stars.", "author": "Kimya P."}

Hidden in an alley in a nice area of financial district, away from the tourist traps, elegant, with certain old world charm, classy but not suffy, with great art work on the walls (i love the painting of the clown kissing a ballerina), a bit dark, with classic jazz (live or otherwise) and a touch of romance. Great food and presentation, awesome bartenders / mixologists (try a classic martini or one of their cocktails) and excellent service.\n\nI've visited Bix a few times over the years since, sometimes just for drinks. It's generally always been a positive experience. The last was in June 2014 for an early mid-week dinner with a friend. For appetizer, we split an A la minute Ceviche (with halibut). It is not like a traditional ceviche, but it is visually beautiful and a perfect blend of fish, greens/herbs, avocado, and nuts for a little crunch.\n\nFor entree, I had the duck breast with stuffed morel mushrooms and fava beans. It was light and perfectly cooked, pink with a little skin. The morel mushrooms were divine. My friend had the king salmon which was also perfectly cooked with crunchy skin and semi-raw center, and delicious.

My friend enjoyed the Malbec and stuck with it.\n\nThe service was excellent and they were considerate that we were on a tight schedule. Overall a great dining experience.

This place gets a 3-star because the food was disappointing, service almost disastrously slow, and hostesses preoccupied.\n\nMostly based off of Yelp recommendations, we got:\nPotato Pillows - pretty much a hashbrown, very mild flavor, almost didn't notice the caviar\nSteak Tartare - void of flavor except for black olives\nDuck Breast - very very sweet\nChick Hash a la Bix - described as a chicken crab cake, I'd say that was a pretty accurate description. the dish desperately needed acid, and came with some tomatoes to balance it out. while not a bad dish, not worth $22. At least give us some greens!\nDuck fat potatoes - all we tasted was large amounts of garlic\nBottle of Barbera - had to pour ourselves after the initial pour after waiting around for the waiter. Also should mention it took about 30 minutes for the waiter to come take our order.\n\nFor dessert:\nBananas Foster - presented as a bowl of ice cream, and the waiter pours the bananas foster on top. Reminded me of melted ice cream soup. Though the very tiny pieces of bananas were good, the dish left a lot to be desired\nChocolate Mouse - very good consistency but no flavors to write home about\n\nFor such an expensive meal, we expected much more.

It's  right down an alley, and no i don't mean one of those shady, fear for your life, mean streets of New York type alleys either, we're talking about a nice, clean, pan handler free, straight out of a movie type alleys.

I mean if you want a quiet, peaceful, \"champagne wishes & caviar dreams\" type of atmosphere then look no further.\n\n3. The bananas fosters dessert was GLORIOUS!\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n1. Now I hesitate to say that the food was BAD, however, for as much as it cost I expected it to be a WHOLE lot better. I ordered a $30 truffle burger, and in all honesty I expected it to change my life for that that kind of money. Needless to say, it did not :( in fact it was nothing more than average at best. The truffle fries however were pretty good, I will say that.\n\n2. The prices were pretty steep, so in my opinion, unless you are willing to pay that much money for the things listed above, it's not worth going there for the food alone.\n\nTHE UGLY:\n\n1. Our server was kind of a douche to put it quite bluntly. He was very condescending anytime we asked a question, so finally we just stopped asking. I got the feeling he made up his mind that we were not going to leave him a good tip before he even took our drink order. Having been a server and a bartender I realize that it is not uncommon to do that, but you should still provide the same quality service regardless. Funny thing was we actually left him a 20% tip just to prove him wrong, and managed to wipe the smug grin off his face long enough for him to apply his, more exceptional, service skills in thanking and bidding us adieu.\n\nThat's it, and please note that this was only MY experience, I do not claim to speak for everyone.

Yum! \n\nI ordered the duck breast with stuffed morel mushrooms, fava beans and kumquats for my entree, and it was divine. Great combination of flavors. Drinks were enjoyable, and included the ginger gimlet (nice balance of tart and spice), and the Aviation (a little sweet for my taste, but the creme de violette was interesting). The bartender poured a grenacha for my entree, and it was the best pairing I have ever experienced, complementing the smokey duck and woodsy morels. \n\nI was stuffed, but powered through a lovely strawberry rhubarb tart with salted caramel & almond sorbet.

I think the food itself leaves more to be desired. We ordered sidecars to start since we'd seen that drink was highly recommended on 7x7. It was your typical martini; nothing special. \n\nFor food, we had their salmon tartare to start and then shared the lobster spaghetti and duck breast with some brussel sprouts and truffle fries on the side. The tartare is really small, but decent. No spectacular flavors though. Entrees were decently sized though the seasoning was a bit too salty for me. I drank a lot of water that night. You can't go wrong with brussel sprouts and truffle fries, so those were pretty standard.\n\nWhat was nice about the restaurant was the live music that they started playing about half way through the night. The service was really good and there was no pressure to order immediately. Location is a bit odd with it being down a dark alley, but I suppose that helps with the jazz club vibe.\n\nOverall, I think it was a bit too pricey for my taste, but worth a shot if you like a jazzy ambience with fancy menu options, but pretty chill vibe.

It's rare to find a true American restaurant in the city these days where people can dress up and maintains the old school \"roaring 20s in SF\" vibe. Some items were good, but nothing that stood out as superb.\n\nFood: It's truffle season in Italy, and they have truffles at Bix! We did family style for apps so we could sample more of them. Pro-tip: you don't have to get multiple orders if you want more than 1 order, but 2 orders is too many if you are ordering many apps (most things are prepared with 4 items, but they can make it 5, 6, 7, etc.). We enjoyed the potato pillows, oysters on the half, braised meatballs, deviled eggs, and the fresh sourdough bread. Lobster spaghetti was good, but the ribeye seemed better.\n\nThings we enjoyed: Ambiance was lively with a live singer & jazz band, sizable wine selection with some of California's finest, and most of the meal was pleasant (timing, taste, presentation). Traditional offerings without all the fusion & unnecessary accoutrements. Prices were also surprisingly reasonable. \n\nAreas for improvement: the table-side service across staff was really lacking attention to detail. The water was never refreshed throughout our two hour meal, servers were shoving platters in our face at untimely moments, (it was busy, but there was clearly a more non-invasive manner of dropping off the plates) and the music was a bit loud.\n\ni'd definitely give this place another chance w/ a group looking for a casual yet upscale restaurant and classic menu items.", "author": "Tammy H."}

The hostess asked to take my coat and wished The Boyfriend a happy birthday and left.\n\nA few minutes later, a smiling waiter appeared, wished The Boyfriend a happy birthday and had polite chit-chat with him and asked if he wanted a celebration drink. He declined at first but ended up ordering a Meyer Lemon Collins. \n\nWe started our meal with the Lamb Burgers which had a faint Mediterranean flair to them which I loved, since I grew up with a mother obsessed with Greek food. For our main dish, I ordered the Bix Burger and the boyfriend had the Kobe Steak which was a hit with both of us. It was very tender and spiced just right. My burger was fantastic and cooked medium rare (which apparently is hard to do, since many establishments never get it right). \n\nWe ended the night with the chocolate bread pudding which came with two candles. \n\nOur service was fantastic. We weren't bothered and we could actually hold a conversation with each other without being worried that our waiter would come and interrupt.

For a high-volume restaurant, I have always been surprised by the excellent quality of the food.  As good as the fish and apps were, the caesar salad is less than what I would expect at Applebee's.  If you are going to serve one, it should be more than a few leaves of romaine with some dressing drizzled over the top.  Perhaps tableside with an option for anchoive, although Julia Child would disagree.  \n\nThis is a fun place to have a good martini and a gregar with friends.  My problem was that I was having a business dinner with a party of 12.  We arrived on time but were told that we could not be seated until all 12 of us were there, even though 9 of us had been waiting/drinking in the bar.  The hostess was so rude about it, that I would have left on the spot if I wasn't with clients.  The bar is always a bit crowded (and fun) but this group wanted to sit and start ordering apps etc.  Finally I was handed off to another host and he begrudingly sat us - after I insisted that all 12 of us would be there.

The duck liver was actually like a moose and was good, steak tartare was good as well and was prepared table side which was cool. Nice place and good food, but not a place I have to go to again.", "author": "Candice B."}

I agree with the other reviewer, this place does something to people.  \n\nFour friends and I went to a pinup model workshop and photoshoot over the weekend and capped it off with dinner at BIX.  We all had our glamour on, and the elegant retro vibe here only helped to elevate that feeling.  \n\nAfter cocktails, wine and a fantastic meal of (around the table) heirloom tomatoes and housemade mozzarella, oysters on the half shell, tomato soup, ricotta and grilled squash napoleon,  Little Gem salad, steak tartare, chicken hash and more (all delicious)...   we were discussing the fact that our workshop hostess walked around in a vintage slip and high heels almost constantly... and how cool that was.    \n\nI was inspired... so I changed into a gorgeous silk chiffon shortie nightie that could almost pass as a camisole top.... with my black dress pants and 1940s vintage jacket....     at the table.     Under cover of the tablecloth and giggling girlfriends.   (Don't worry... it was late, we were in a corner and hardly anyone was there)\n\nThen we proceeded to go out to the alleyway, where it is decorated with cafe tables and candles....  and since it was late and there was no one around for miles.... I stripped off my pants (my coat comes to my calves so I could cover up when needed)....   sat down on the cafe chair in high heels and that gorgeous slip.... and threw open my coat so my freind could take photos.\n\nLOL!!!\n\nI don't know what came over us!

The service every time is superb.\n\nThe entrance located on Gold Street reminds me of the Prohibition Era just a bit. The bar makes many good mixed drinks. There is live jazz (piano player and/or trios) in the evenings, and you can eat on either the main floor or upstairs. My recommendation is to get a table upstairs. It's a little more intimate and you have a view of the whole restaurant. \n\nI am a little disappointed that they no longer have the kobe beef bavette and mashed potatoes on the menu. That has long been my favorite. However, on my most recent visit I had the seared albacore tuna, which was good. For appetizers, my friends and I split oysters, and the heirloom tomato salad. For dessert, I had bananas foster and vanilla ice cream covered in rum. It was delicious.\n\nWill I be back? Of course - I love this place!", "author": "Stephanie S."}

The vibe was very Art Deco with a live piano player and singer. Usually I shy away from live music when dining, as it's hard to converse with company, but this was a mellow, good vibe. Don't get me wrong, you should dress up, I wore pants and a blazer and flats and felt dressed down. Specifically, I'd recommend the steak tartar. Not only my favorite dish in general, but exceptionally good here. Very impressed. The best part of dinner had to be the server assistant, Pedro. He was so amazing, attentive, and sweet!

We came expecting a quiet & romantic dinner for our anniversary but it was actually sometimes even hard to hear our waitress. The staff run very quickly trying to keep up with all the tables and I asked one of the waiters to take our photo in between running back and forth, but unfortunately the photo was off angle and blurry. Oh well ... Food was good but not sure we would go back. Oh the 'jazz music' is a piano downstairs in the bar area, but very hard to hear due to all the noise. Why can't they put up some sound proof to absorb rather than reflect the noise or separate the noisy bar area ... The restaurant has been around for a very long time in an off the beaten path and apparently has a loyal following.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-08-11", "description": "Things started off so nicely. We had a couple of expectedly and understandably expensive drinks at the beautiful old bar by a classic barman clad in white jacket. The place presented so much historic elegance and architecture that we were discussing our return before we even moved on to our dinner table for food. Upon being seated, we were in a great mood as it appeared everything about the place suited our tastes. It even reminded us of a small scale version of one of our favorite restaurants called The Wolseley in London.\n\nThe waiter seemed very professional and polite, food was selected, and drinks ordered. Our wine arrived, and we told the waiter \"We already expect to be returning soon. This is our kind of place.\" My Caesar salad was not bad, though I was surprised that in a \"fine restaurant\" the traditional shaving of anchovy was not present. No matter, I've seen it both ways. We also had an order of deviled eggs with truffle. These were very nice. So far so good. \n\nMy entree showed up, which was Sea Bass. I had previously asked the waiter \"how is it prepared?\" He simply said \"it's a boneless fillet, oven cooked.\" He forgot to mention that it was first mercilessly saturated and preserved in salty brine to the point of rivaling an Egyptian mummy, and that it would  rest upon the tooth less like a leathery fish and more like a fishy shoe. \n\nI really didn't want to complain or ruin our evening. Washing wine over my abused and unrecognizable sea bass and diluting it with the side vegetables as I went, my desire to be agreeable quashed my judgement and I ate half of the pickled fish slab before telling my wife that it was making me sick and I finally pushed it aside with nausea and regret. My stomach was quickly upset to the point of it becoming clear that I would have to skip my usual coffee and dessert. But for the jazz musicians fingering away, all adjacent diners would have surely heard my stomach protesting what had been done to it.\n\nI decided not to say anything, for my wife's sake, and just leave without mentioning the amazingly bad food to staff. That's when Blake, the manager, happened by. \"How was everything?\" he inquired. Well, as he asked... I recounted everything that I had loved up until the food arrived, but added \"There was so much salt in my food it tasted like shelf stable bait pulled from a vacuum pack bag.\" And that I was already becoming sick from what I had just eaten. \n\nBlake struck me as an honest and genuinely nice guy when he responded \"I'm not going to B.S. you, you aren't the first person to say that.\" Wow, really? He went on to say \"They brine the fish to remove impurities, but sometimes it gets left in way too long.\" Firstly, why would anyone brine sea bass? It's clean, light, and wonderful. Second, If the fish was brined for some reason, that certainly should have been  part of the waiter's answer when I asked how the fish was prepared. Also, if the pleasant manager had heard the fish was inedibly salty from others...why did they serve it to me?\n\nHe went directly to the kitchen, ostensibly to chat with the cook (make no mistake, there is no chef in this establishment). What he didn't do was offer to comp the offending slab of pickled bait, or even to comp my wife's dessert and coffee. \n\nTo be fair he did say \"If you ever come back, I'll buy you a drink.\" It's something, but I think that offer missed its mark. I felt quite sick and uncomfortable for all of that night and all of the next day. It's now two days later and my stomach is not yet settled. \n\nBix had us from the moment we walked in the door. They then set out by the sheer force of will from their kitchen to serve us one of the worst meals I have ever eaten anywhere in quite a long time. I am not exaggerating when I say that this food would have been considered sub par and offensive had it been served to me in a Styrofoam clam shell through the window of my car at a drive-through. \n\nTwo cocktails, one bottle of wine, appetizers, entrees, and a single dessert/coffee for the wife was just about three hundred dollars with tip. As I sit uncomfortably listening to my stomach revolt and attempt to heal two days on, I promise it has cost me much more than that . \n\nOnly if I one day hear they have actually hired a chef, will I possibly consider giving them another chance but it is amazing to me how badly they failed their first chance. \n\nStop by and have a drink and enjoy the atmosphere of a fine old building, but stay away from the \"food\".", "author": "T A."}

My only complaint was that the rye bread wasn't a good fit for a burger, and I love rye bread.\n\nThe \"Perfect\" Manhattan was quite good too, though Dickel Rye isn't my favorite. \n\nPro Move 1: You might need to be patient if you take a vehicle into Gold Street (Alley).

The valet is nice though.\n\nBIX was the site of my first SF dinner back in 2001, when my parents lived out in Pleasanton and I still lived in Ohio.

So, yeah, it was good to get inside finally.\n\nMy dad and I thought it would be very cool to own to a huge bar like this.

We came here tonight and was seated right away.  Bix is located on a hidden street close to Bubble Lounge.  Upon entering, it is very dim and you get the feeling you're in a mansion of a 20's or 30's party, very Gatsby-esque, very beautiful.  There is a downstairs and an upstairs, we were seated at one of the tables close to the pianist downstairs.  Bix is a very romantic restaurant, so if you want to spark some love this is definitely a place to bring that special someone.\n\nWe ordered the potato pillows with creme fraiche and caviar.  Wow!  What a great dish to start with.  Small pieces of perfectly fried potato complemented with just the right amount of creme fraiche and caviar.  I could have had another 10 of those.  I had the trout salad and my fiancee had the steak tartare.  Both were very good.  For entrees she had the deliciously made lobster pasta.  Pieces of lobster with a sauce that tastes bisque like, I highly recommend getting this.  If you're not a heavy eater, the half portion should be good enough.  I ordered the truffle burger which I was a bit disappointed with.  Not enough truffle flavor and the fries were too crunchy.  I do want to add that the mojito that my fiancee had was terrific.\n\nWhy am I giving it four stars and not five?  I felt the pace of the food came a bit too quickly.  We were in and out in an hour with three courses.  For a place where you want to sit and enjoy a romantic dinner with wonderful music, it was definitely rushed.  I think an hour and half would have been better.  Second we were only listen to the pianist and didn't get to enjoy a jazz trio or quartet because they don't start till 8:30pm which was a bummer.  \n\nI will definitely come back but I hope our dinner can last longer next time.", "author": "Pierre L."}

When my friend first took me here, I thought it would be this small divey type bar. Once we were inside though, I was impressed! This place is big and there is an upper balcony area for diners. The whole place is classy and has a 40's look to it. We just stopped here to get a few drinks. The cocktails on the menu are exotic and good. The bartender was nice and friendly. \n\nThe people at this place were sophisticated but there were some people here who were dressed casually like us as well. I think I had the blood orange margarita and that it cost $13.00. I liked the drink and the other cocktail that I had. I can't recall what I had after that. The decor is nice. This would definitely be a good place to go on a romantic date on if money isn't an issue as the items on the menu are on the pricey side. I think that in general, most entrees are around $15.00-$25.00 for lunch and $30.00-$50.00 for dinner. I hope to come back here the next time I'm in SF.", "author": "Butterfly A."}

It was a relaxing evening. The ambiance is fine and fun and the music, while well played, is soft enough to converse over.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-02", "description": "*4.5 stars*\n\nBIX is an incredible dining experience that takes you back to (what I imagine to be) the days of when Sinatra was king and jazz was the norm. The ambiance oozes class and you feel important to even be allowed inside. Usually, I would brush this off as a pretentious restaurant filled with snobs and douchebags, but BIX somehow maintains a welcoming and warm atmosphere that is difficult to not enjoy.\n\nOur server (Bryan) was absolutely on-point. Attentive, friendly, and informative, Bryan provided exactly what I think good service should be. Water glasses were constantly filled and the food came out at precisely the right moments -- it was great.\n\nOur group of 4 went with family-style dining (ordering all small plates) in lieu of any main dishes, so my experience did not include any of the entrees. Although I didn't get to try the pork chop (as I was encouraged to), it was definitely awesome to taste so many different flavors in bite-size form. \n\n------------------------------\nFOOD:\n\nDungeness Crab Rolls = Incredibly-fresh shredded crab mixed with a sweet and tangy mayo on a thick roll. It was a great proportion of crab to bread.\n\nPotato Pillows = Yes, these are like tater tots for the filthy rich, but they are delicious. The mixture of the creamy potato, the crisped exterior, and the not-too-overpowering caviar was perfect. It really is difficult to justify the price (almost $4 for a tater tot), but when you're swishing that bite-sized goodness in your mouth, you completely forget that finances are actually important in life.\n\nMini Croques = Like miniature grilled cheese sandwiches laced with truffle oil and mushrooms. Just rewriting that makes me salivate. \n\nBone Marrow = It's definitely not my favorite that I've had in the city, but it really is cooked well. I don't think the toast needed to be so oily and crisped, since the bone marrow should provide all of the oil in each bite, but the parsley and salt were great additions.\n\nMini Lamb Burgers = They really weren't kidding when they say \"mini\", because these are seriously one-biters. The lamb wasn't too gamy, which is good, but I didn't find too much flavor in these. Luckily, I had some saved up bone marrow and parsley, which I carefully added in there to give it the perfect oomph that it needed.\n\nChilled Foie Gras = I love all forms of foie gras, so regardless if it's seared, moussed, or (in this case) chilled in a pate-form, I'm going to love it. The foie gras here definitely didn't have as strong of that distinct foie gras flavor that I love, but it definitely hit the spot nonetheless.\n\nMozzarella w/ Prosciutto = Perfect mozz flavor. The combination was very good.\n\nTruffle Fries = Excellent fries, crisped perfectly.\n\nBrussels Sprouts = These were way too oily and salty. If they had cut down on the oil and salt, they would've been much better, because the sprouts actually had an excellent texture.\n\nBananas Foster = Incredible. One of the best desserts I've had in a while.\n\nGrand Total: $163.03 (w/ 2 glasses of wine and tax, but before tip)\n------------------------------\n\nBIX definitely holds its own as a true SF staple, with a perfect mix of class and cool. It would actually be a great place to come for drinks -- just to sit at the bar, absorbing the ambiance created by the tuxed-out pianist, the soulful jazz singer, and the classy decor. Though, that is only if the food weren't also this damn good.", "author": "Roy C."}

They played jazz and came over and chatted with us on their break. Aside from that it was not a great evening. I ordered the strip steak and my sister ordered the lamb. My steak came out medium well and I ordered medium rare also my broccoli was almost raw but the tops were horribly burnt it was not worth the $48 price tag. My sister had a completely raw piece of potato on her plate and nothing was really seasoned. Our waitress Jessica was kinda rude although she did have a good knowledge of the menu. She asked if we wanted dessert and when we declined she seemed very offended. When our check came the tip was written in on the bottom in pen by her and the total. Our two friends asked for a separate check so she split it and we gave her the 2 cards and which checks to put on which. She came back and had charged the wrong cards so we folded each check around the proper card so she wouldn't get confused again, and she came back the second time with it wrong again. Finally, the third time she did it correctly. She never gave us anything to show that she had reversed the other 2 charges and we called the manager over and he said they are getting a new system so they waiters have to just write the tips and totals on the checks which is pretty lame for that caliber of restaurant.

Aside from the neon sign, BIX camouflages wells amongst the brick buildings that line up and down this particular narrow alley in Jackson Square. Look across the restaurant and you can catch a glimpse of the the upper levels of the Transamerica building. Enter the restaurant and witness jacketed bartenders serving gimlets, sidecars, rickeys and all things martini behind the mahogany bar. Are those handles and bar knobs gold? Was this a speakeasy? Live Jazz is playing in the background while locals, tourists  and business people alike are having dinner on both levels of this seemingly 1940's era restaurant/bar. \n\nWe snag seats at the bar and order up some martinis. I order the BIX Rickey and some variety of Gimlet and my S.O. orders a Margarita and a BIX Manhattan. The drinks were delicious and well made. Both of us had dinner, but we couldn't resist the recommended Lobster Spaghetti and decided to split this dish. Generous chunks of lobster, sweet tomatoes, creamy sauce and parsley...this dish is very very good. I'm willing to put money on this dish being the the best pasta dish in the city. \n\nYou won't find this place on Michael Bauer's list and you won't for sure find BIX on SF 7x7's 100 things, which is a good thing.

They only had one and it was off the menu. This is a unique place with unique food, but I have always said that it takes a really innovative chef to create outstanding and out of the ordinary meat-free dishes than it does a meat dish. This definitely seems like the type of place that's capable of crating unique vegetarian dishes, so it's too bad they don't try. This would be the main place I bring anyone for special occasions if they tried to have entrees for everyone. \nThis was the second time I was here, but the first time I had anything beyond dessert and cocktails. I chose this place because it was a special occasion and me and my party have a flair for the 1930's-1950's. I knew this place also had a live piano player most nights. \nWe got the corner table that I requested which was awesome! Ordered the appetizer sampler, for which I could only eat the deviled eggs (which I do not like deviled eggs), but this evening was no about me. The waitress was super nice and when she found out I was vegetarian she brought me too adorable shot glass size cups of their house made gazpacho. I had never had gazpacho before as cold soup has always seemed anything but enticing, but I had it and it was outstanding! I'd actually order that next time if they had it in  full sized portion. Their hot sourdough rolls are amazing!\nSo, the one dish they had I could eat was super basic. Delicious, but not at all creative. Spaghetti, basil, heirloom tomatoes, and garlic. Maybe a couple of other ingredients. I would totally get it again if it weren't so expensive. If it had been a super creative dish I couldn't get anywhere, then $27 would ad made sense. \nThe cocktail I got was Ambrosia. I wouldn't get it again. Nothing special. \nThe ambiance is why I love the place though. If they ever start consisting offering creative meat-free dishes then this will be my go-to place for sure! But till then, there's no benefit for me to go and have to settle for a common spaghetti dish and almost no appetizers I can eat either. \nThis is the perfect place for a meat eaters who had a lot of money though! Definitely the highest bill I have ever seen for just 2 people.", "author": "Unicorn U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-04-28", "description": "We visited for our anniversary, and after agonizing between this place and that, I decided to give Bix the call to the big leagues.  And they did not disappoint. The signage is understated, and the restaurant, while not hidden, is tucked out of the way down an alley. This must be intentional as it ties into their speak-easy aesthetic. Inside, the decor feels like another era. High ceilings, large oil paintings, live music with piano accompaniment; I half expected Bogey to be sitting at the bar lamenting his rotten luck.\n\nOur server Jacquie was exceptional. She was attentive yet unassuming, always around when we needed something, but never hovering or imposing. Even my martini arrived with a little panache. Everything was executed flawlessly; she might have been an assassin in another life.\n\nWe started with the Potato Pillows with Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche and American Sturgeon Caviar. These are gentrified tater tots. The potato puree is whipped up into a light puff and served crisp with a lil bit of creme fraiche for tanginess and caviar for saltiness. The flavors were understated, but it was more about the contrast of texture that made this dish memorable.\n\nNext we had the Chilled Foie Gras with Spiced Kumquats. This was the whole reason I chose Bix in the first place, so I was looking forward to it. The foie gras was like butter, smooth and rich, served with a tangy kumquat compote with toast points. Better get this while you can, I don't know what California is gonna do after July 1.\n\nI had Grilled Duck Paillard with Spring Onions, Fingerling Potatoes and Foie Gras Sauce. I like a good duck dish, but compared to everything we ordered, this was just okay. It was still delicious, but didn't surprise us like the other dishes.\n\nLuckily the Maine Lobster Spaghetti \"alla Chitarra\" with Cherry Tomatoes, Jalape\u00f1os and Basil was a knockout. Even if you removed the lobster, the tomatoes and jalapenos totally made the dish pop. And I can only assume they use freshly made pasta, because this had a meta-pasta flavor, like pasta multiplied by itself, exponentially delicious. Of course, this dish does come with lobster, so that just kicks it all up to another level. I don't usually order pasta, but for this I would make an exception.\n\nEven though they offered some more extravagant items (Bananas Foster, Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, etc), we decided to go simple for dessert:  Seascape Strawberries with Whipped Cream and Vanilla Meringue, and fresh chocolate chip cookies. Simple, but fresh and tasty. Both were served with whipped cream that was not overly sweet, so it was a nice compliment to each dessert.\n\nIf I was local, I would come here for drinks and apps anytime. But I'm not, so I guess I'll save it for when I'm in town.", "author": "Christopher M."}

Great ambiance, friendly service, and free live jazz.\n\nIt's pretty hard to find, especially if you're driving by in a car. Gold St is a small alley and easy to miss, but the parking nearby is generally not too bad.\n\nI came on a Sunday night with a couple friends and we sat at a booth upstairs. The building has really high ceilings and has the feel of an old speakeasy. They have a lot of classic cocktails and I would recommend the sidecar.\n\nFood wise, everything was great, although the portions are a bit modest. One of our friends was running late, so we got drinks first and split the ceviche to start. For dinner, I got the chicken hash and it was really tasty. Just the right size for a light dinner and also to save room for dessert. We split the bananas foster for dessert. mmm...so good.\n\nThe live music was nice and started around 7pm. On Sundays, it is solo piano. I actually saw the piano player come in since I was sitting at the bar waiting for my friends. He talked to the bartender a bit, got his usual drink, and then sat at the piano and started playing right away.\n\nBix would be a great place to stop by for a drink if you work in the area.", "author": "Kenny J."}

We ordered two house specialties as appetizer: steak tartar and bone marrow tartar and they were both super delicious. The steak tartar was very rare and perfectly spiced. The bone marrow was very satisfying although slightly saltier than what would have been perfect. For main course, we ordered the black truffle cheese burger and the lobster spaghetti. We ordered the burger to be cooked medium well - it came very juicy and there was a very generous amount of black truffles hidden inside the beef patty. The lobster spaghetti was overall average - no surprises (good or bad). We had the infamous bananas foster for desert - it was a very generous portion, I would definitely recommend sharing it in groups. I unfortunately don't have too much of a sweet tooth so I thought it was pretty okay (maybe above average). We paired our meals with red wine by the glass and the wine was high quality and very delicious.\n\nThe ambience at BIX was classy and pretentious. Most of the customers were dressed up in suits/dresses. You might feel somewhat out of place if you showed up with Tshirt and shorts. The decor is very classy - with paintings, carpet floor, dim lighting and a grand piano. My favorite part about the experience is having live jazz music. They seem to only have live music for dinner. There was a pianist as well as jazz singer performing jazz for customers. The music was very pleasant and lively. Making this spot a perfect place for romantic/date dinner.\n\nOverall I think I'll definitely come back for dinner/lunch again.", "author": "Cindy L."}

When we pointed out the error to our server we were served the correct one but still paid for the wrong glass. The meals were slammed on our table by the servers who took no time to explain what was being served or answer any questions with zero eye contact.  This was the same for our bread, butter and water.  Both my meal and my girlfriend's were over done and dry but yet again our waiter was nowhere to be found.

One of the wait staff spilled a bowl of piping hot potato soup all over my back and hair (wrong night to wear a backless shirt...) While our waiter was very apologetic, the manager on duty (Will) was a total douche about it. After taking a look at one of the burned areas on my back, he proclaimed \"Its not blistered, you'll be fine\" I held an ice pack to the burn for the entire duration of our dinner and realized when I got home that I did have a blister on my lower back from the soup. When our bill came, we were comped the soup that had been spilled on me...and 20 dollars worth of cookies and creme brulee (we refused dessert several times) One of the women I was with is a general manager of a restaurant herself and was HORRIFIED at how they chose to take care of the situation. She spoke to Will for several minutes and his response was \"I feel I did what was appropriate for the situation\"\n\nThe situation was that your staff caused me physical harm and due to this,I had to go home early-missing the rest of a bachelorette party that I planned.\n\nI emailed the general manager, Blake, and explained the situation. He assured me that he would look into it and get back to me. It's been 2 weeks and I have yet to get a hold of him(phone tag for a while...Im still waiting for him to call me back). I did, however, get to speak with Will again. He let me know that Blake would be issuing me a gift certificate for BIX. I would not return to this restaurant if you paid me. Nor would I pawn the certificate off on someone else. The obviously careless management of this restaurant is disgusting.\n\nOh...did I mention they overcharged my credit card by 150 dollars?

Pricey for sure, but fine if you split it and I definitely recommend splitting it because it can be quite rich and filling.  Pasta with decent sized lobster pieces in a lobster bisque sauce with lobster butter?  Yes please.  We didn't get dessert because dessert was provided at prom, but I'd love to come back and try some.\n\nAs for the decor, the restaurant was very classically decorated and the tables were a decent space apart that you could carry on your own conversations.

I was stuck in traffic and my date for the night was there on time for the reservation. She checked in and they said that they could not seat her since the party was not complete.

Perfect, perfect.\n\nI'd never been to Bix; I think it hovers gracefully under the radar, nestled on a Battery Coast side alley.

We braved the cold temperatures that characterize summer in San Francisco and arrived on Gold Street to find the wait for a table clocking in at one hour. \n\nNot long after, we snagged seats at the bar. The only downside was getting periodically poked by the oversize bags of the women standing in the bar. Eventually I gave a healthy nudge to a giant Balenciaga tote and the poking ceased. I say this only because you may find yourself battling a similar issue should you choose to dine at the bar. Two pieces of advice: hang your own purse from one of the hooks beneath the bar and be prepared to judiciously defend your personal space from purses that threaten to invade it.\n\nUpon receiving a split portion of the lobster spaghetti, I quickly understood its allure. This dish alone makes Bix worth visiting.", "author": "Miriam W."}

DON'T walk in, chances are you won't get sat. DO make a reservation; a month in advance is highly advised.\nVenue has two floors, bottom floor is right next to the live band and is a little louder. Maybe for bigger groups? Upper floor is definitely more intimate. Most couples or smaller groups were sat upstairs I believe.\nThe service was impressive. Highly attentive, professional. For a dinner this price you are getting the service you deserve and more.\nCan't remember exactly which items we ordered when we went, it's been a month since our visit. I just remember that the tartare was so amazing. From presentation to delivery, and taste, each blew us out of our minds. Bill was about $150 plus tip for two people, which was pretty reasonable.\nIt is a pretty upscale place, and located down a sketchy alleyway. Parking is a pain in the @$$.

My lobster spaghetti started off really good. The lobster chunks were plentiful and the grape tomatoes were a good balance. But after a while it was super thick and creamy. I couldn't finish it.

Once you step in you realize you're in another world. The interior really reminds me of Gotham City. I was expecting Batman to jump down from the second floor. A huge mural hangs over the bar where an old-fashion white suited bartender works. The atmosphere is quite modern and on the verge of being gothic. It's great for romantic couples, business dates, or anniversaries. The feeling is somewhat stern and serious, almost cold, but it clearly knows what it wants to be.\n\nThe food is like a contrast of the interior. All of our appetizers were good. The only issue I had with the appetizers, that being there was only one textural element -- soft. That being said they executed the dishes very well and the softness felt luxurious. Our main dishes carried along the same richness and quality. Usually the appetizers turn out much better than the main course but I felt it was just as good. The desserts are good as well although the selection is tired and uninspired. How many places serve creme brulee, bread pudding, and bananas foster? It's good if you're looking for a traditional selection.\n\nI recommend BIX if you're looking for a high end experience with consistent quality food that makes you feel like getting a luxurious experience. You will certainly leave full. This isn't light fare. The service is accommodating.\n\nThe only negatives would have to be the french fries and men's urinal. The french fries are over fried so they're super crunchy, almost like potato chips. They're really oily too. My mom got a bad stomach ache from them. And the urinal... They built the urinal so close to the wall that they have a problem with \"spray back.\" So they've installed a drain board, which looks like a titled plastic cutting board.

I loved where it was located on Gold Street - hidden from all of the other nonsense on Columbus.  For starters, I had the Pisco Sour, and it had to have been THE best Pisco Sour I've ever had.  I could have thrown back at least 3 of those.  Anyway, Greg's favorite dish here is the Steak Tartare, and being that we both loved the two at Chez Papa Resto and Wayfare Tavern, I was really looking forward to this.  The tableside presentation of the mixing of the tartare was a GREAT touch, and I'm a huge sucker for those types of things.  The little toasts they gave you, combined with all of the strong (but not overpowering) tastes in the tartare really blew me away.  I don't always say this, but I really mean that if it were socially acceptable to lick a plate, I'd do it.  Every last morsel of this was incredible.  We got wonderful bottle of the 2006 DuMOL Syrah (Greg always remembers that my favorite wine when we first met was a syrah) and it paired nicely with our incredible CHEESEBURGERS.  Yep, the Black Truffle Cheese Burger served open face on Rye with Truffle Fries.  DELISH. DELISH. DELISH.  The one thing I will say about the dish is that, be prepared for truffle oil in the fries.  It was incredibly strong on the fries, so I found myself going to ketchup/mayo sauce to balance out the intense flavoring.  To round out the night, we both shared the Creme Brulee over a cappuccino and an apple brandy.  The whole experience was great, and our waitress was incredibly helpful (she went back and had a number of people from the staff look for the cork from our bottle of wine).

My curiosity about Bix had been piqued since the bf came home raving about their bread, saying that it was the best bread EV-AH. Since I am a firm believer in the notion that you can tell a lot about a restaurant by the quality of their bread, I was excited about finally getting to try Bix last Friday. \n\nI had briefly perused the menu online and the potato pillows with creme fraiche and caviar had jumped out at me so I ordered that. We also ordered another starter for the table to share: the steak tartare. \n\nWe had a nice variety of entrees at our table: I had the truffled cheeseburger with truffled fries, the bf had the Maine lobster spaghetti, and the other couple that we were dining with had the beef stew and the fish of the day which I believe was rainbow trout. \n\nSadly, the potato starter was quite disappointing. The pillow itself was bland and mealy. So much so that it covered up any richness that the creme fraiche and caviar might have imparted.  Quelle horreur!!  The steak tartare was unmemorable as far as I was concerned.\n\nHowever, the converse was true about my cheeseburger--unfortunately, it was memorable for all the wrong reasons. \n\nI ALWAYS order my meat medium rare and have never EVER gotten sick. However, this time around, I ended up with the nastiest case of food poisoning that I can remember... and from a freaking cheeseburger! Who gets food poisoning from a cheeseburger??? (This is a rhetorical question...)\n\nPerhaps I should've waited a little while before writing this review as I am still in the process of recovering and have barely eaten anything for the last two days... so obviously my review is a little biased...\n\nOn a more positive note, the lobster spaghetti and the beef stew were quite good. Their desserts were decent as well (the table shared an order of bananas foster and the chocolate brioche bread pudding). \n\nAnother negative: our waitress was M.I.A. a lot of the time... which wouldn't have been so bad, except that we noticed that she seemed to be VERY attentive to the two tables that were nearby. Could this have had anything to do that those two tables had ordered two bottles of wine a piece while I was the only one at our table who had ordered an alcoholic beverage?

Closecloseclose to 5 stars.\n\nWith Bix, you get both very good food and delightful atmosphere.  A smaller than you would expect restaurant, literally hidden in an alley, with live jazz music and people-watching aplenty.\n\nThe bartenders are knowledgeable and make very good cocktails and can also offer suggestions.  Step out of the box and let them guide the way.\n\nThe food is almost always excellent.  Although the heavier, creamier dishes will bomb your belly, I would still recommend them because they are so outstanding.  For example, I'm talking Truffle Cheese and Sweet Onion Croques.  You get 5 of these little sandwiches and they are finger licking delicious.   I could have eaten 20 of them and called it a day.  \n\nSteak tartare is prepared tableside and, again, I could have eaten 5 plates of this stuff and have been totally satisfied.  Tomato soup with a mini grilled cheese sandwich--again, homey, creamy, excellent and a belly bomb.  And I mean that in the nicest way.\n\nLobster pasta--does that sound heavy to you?  It is but it is both heavy and heavenly.  It is served in a heavy cream sauce and you'll want to lick your plate.\n\nThe only disappointment was the Kobe steak.  I know we are all supposed to swoon over \"Kobe\" (both the beef and the Bryant), but not all Kobes are created equally.  This one is mostly tasteless and that is a shame.  Skip it and go for something else.\n\nOverall,, Bix is excellent in almost every way.  But to be hold yourself up like this restaurant does, everything needs to hit the mark, and the service at Bix does not always match the high standards of the food and the drinks (and the music). And that is also a shame.  \n\nBix is still an excellent restaurant in nearly every way and well worth a visit.", "author": "Craig W."}

The menu is extensive and everything looked so delicious. I had to go for the chicken hash and my hubby had the Bix burger. They were marvelicious and delicious. No doubt about that. Service was great, ambience was decorated in a 1930s theme. Soft music which doesnt overpower your voice. Loved the cosiness of this place. Im looking forward to try their dinner menu. Im sure it will be as good as lunch!\n\n4 stars is already considered near perfection for me. Highly recommended.", "author": "Rachel L."}

You only get 4 of these, but they are really good, and the fried \"pillow\" balanced perfectly with the caviar.\n\nAppetizer special for 7/29: fried green tomatoes with garlic sauce.  Skip it.  The texture wasn't interesting, the sauce wasn't interesting, and the flavor wasn't interesting.  In general: not interesting.  Burned by the special again!  Will I ever learn !!??\n\nBr\u00fbl\u00e9ed Vanilla Semifreddo with Blossom Bluff Nectarines: very good.  Great combination of semifreddo (sort of a frozen yogurt), with a crunchy brulee topping, and perfectly ripe nectarines on the bottom.\n\nWarm Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding: excellent, with an innovative top crust of chocolate dust/crumbs (see my photo).  However, it's really, really heavy, and needs more than the scoop of whip cream to help lighten it up.  I recommend ordering it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side, to help \"dilute\" the super-dense pudding.\n\nThe only major disappointment: the espresso is really bad.  I had a decaf double macchiato.  It tasted stale, burned, and metalic: basically, the worst dreck imaginable.\n\nOne issue: the restaurant is really dimly lit, to the point where it's a safety hazard.  It's so dim that the waiters were dropping things.  It was so dim that my camera couldn't auto-focus.  I took a flash photo at the table, and I think I blinded half the diners in the room.", "author": "Scott F."}

Perfect! This little restaurant was conveniently located a block away from our office and they can accomodate large parties. Check!\n\nLooked at the reivews and checked out their pre-fixe menu for large parties. Food looked decent and reviews were all positive. Check!\n\nCame for dinner on a Thursday evening and was seated right away. Waitress was very nice and attentive. There was also a couple vegetarians in our group who, by the end of the night, was very satisfied with the vegetarian options that the restaurant offered.\n\nI requested for the 4-course pre-fixe menu for our group. The 4 course also include hors d'oeuvres, and I think this was the best part of the meal. LOL The hors d'oeuvres consisted of prosciutto wrapped mozarella, smoked salmon tartare, and deviled eggs, ALL were delicious!!! \n\nFor my 4 course meal, I ordered:\nFirst course - Potato Pillows topped with caviar - I thought this appetizer was ok. It seems a little overpriced for fancy tater tots topped with caviar. It was a bit dry, would have preferred if there was a dipping sauce or something similar. I would have preferred to order the steak tartare instead (the bf's first course - of course I had to try this along with all his other courses! :) ), as that was probably more flavorful, and I love tartare!\n\nSecond course - Salad - simple dish comprised of the long lettuce and croutons. I requested for vinagrette dressing instead of the original dressing (don't remember what salad dressing came with the salad).\nThe BF had the soup of the day which was a butternut squash soup with mussels/clams. The soup was actually very very tasty! Typically, I've seen butternut squash soup with either large cubes of squash, or melted and mashed into the soup. This bowl of soup had small diced up pieces of squash, bite-sized. Delicious!\n\nThird course - Chicken Hash - First off, I'm not a fan of bleu cheese. This dish was sort of like a crab cake but instead of crab, its shredded chicken shaped into a pattie infused with bleu cheese then seared to get a crispy exterior. If you aren't a big fan of bleu cheese, like I am, then I'm not so sure you would like this dish as much. My other coworkers ordered the NY Steak, which looked very tasty. The BF ordered fish, which was a bit plain. Meh..\n\nFourth course - Vanilla Creme Brulee - This is probably my second favorite dish of the night, the dessert! The creme brulee was not overly sweet, but was made just right, with a caramelized layer that I broke through to get to the vanilla creme brulee underneath. Delicious! I would definitely recommend this dessert over the the chocolate bread pudding (what the BF ordered). The bread pudding was a little toooo chocolatey for my taste. If you're a big big chocolate lover, then the bread pudding might be for you. I've had better bread pudding, and the bread pudding at Bix just didn't hit the spot for me.\n\nOverall, 3.5 stars for the food alone, plus one star for the attentive service for a total of 4.5 stars!!\n\nThe next time I come, I would like to pick stuff off their regular dinner menu instead of being limited to a pre-fixe menu. I really want to try the truffle burger, so this won't be the last time you see me, BIX!", "author": "Tiffany T."}

A speakeasy like entrance on a secluded, but not sketchy, alley leads into something of a supperclub from days gone by.  High ceilings, high society paintings, live music, actual table cloths.  The food is a great offering of decadent classics.  My only want would be for later hours because most of the clientele here was not actual born in the era that this place tries to replicate!\n\nSteak Tartare: My favorite in San Francisco.  Bloody and hand cut.  All the traditional preparations (shallots, capers, mustard) mixed table side, plus some Brandy!  The olive crostinis were a nice touch because they added more personality than plain without taking away from the tartare.\n\nTruffle Burger: An open face burger with a moist and juicy patty.  Sadly didn't pick up on the black truffle that much... was hoping for something Earth shattering.\n\nChicken Hash \u00e0 la Bix: Came in the form of two patties, like crab cakes.  Was expecting something that would look like stuffing so I was thrown off a bit.  It was ok, but could have been better if there were more crispy chicken confit bits.  The non-chicken section was a bit bland.\n\nTruffle Fries: More truffle-y than the Truffle Burger.  Crispy and tasty with some nice cheese shavings.\n\nWarm Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding: What a great way to end the meal!  A warm gooey bread pudding that is reminiscent of chocolate volcano cakes.  There was some cream or ice cream on top, but I barely noticed because I was in a chocolate frenzy.", "author": "Adam B."}

We met some friends there and our group burgeoned up to 9 people- an easy feat for a waiter in Chicago or New York, not so for SF. We arrived promptly at 6pm and upon entry I sensed a negative tone from the hostess. Despite her attitude, we headed to the bar and ordered a drink and off to the table.\nIt was obvious upon sitting down that he was already plotting our departure to make room for the next table. The company and conversation was good until the waiter, after asking us for the second time for our appetizer order, told us harshly that we had 2 minutes to make a decision and stomped off to tattle to the manager that we weren't moving fast enough. To add insult to injury, the manager then hovered in an attempt to convince us it was time to order.\n\nI am sure you can tell where it went from there- downhill. The food was marginal, the service continued to slip and unfortunately the only thing that escalated was the bill. \n\nAnd to add to the misery, ( there is nothing worse than bad food and service at meal where you pay a babysitter and pay $75 a head), as we were exiting slowly into the cold rainy night, the group ahead of us stopped to open their umbrellas, a log jam ensued and my brother in law had to hold open the door for 45 seconds. The manager then told him angrily to shut the door as he was \"air conditioning\" the restaurant. Well, this comment led to my brother in law responding with explanation of why the door was open and then a statement in reference to his negative attititude. The  manager ended the conversation telling him was an ass.  \n\nNow, that seems inappropriate for a manager at nice restauarant to respond.\n\nI would never go back to this restaurant and will pass on the referral just for the closing comment but the food and service didn't live up to the overall rating.", "author": "cortney d."}

I live in Los Angeles and I have already been there three times so far this year. As everyone else has noted, the atmosphere is brilliant; jazz supper club meets prohibition-era speakeasy. Getting past that, the food is simply a perfect expression of traditional American classic gastronomic fare interpreted through the lens of chic, modern foodie sensibility. Not a single item on the menu comes off as pretentious, yet every single dish seems fresh and exotic while also being deeply satisfying, comforting and familiar. \n\nThe last time I ate there our party enjoyed a ridiculous nine course meal that included Mini Lamb Burgers, Dungeness Crab Rolls, Potato Pillows with Cr\u00e9me Fra\u00eeche and Caviar, Bix's Summer Heirloom Tomato Cart with House-Made Mozzarella, Marrow Bones \"St. John\" on Grilled Durum Bread, Seared Local Albacore, Grilled Veal Paillard with Rock Shrimp, Truffled French Fries and Creamed Spinach followed by Farmer's Market Plums with Almond Ice Cream and Warm Ginger Madelines. I complemented my meal with a number of traditional Sazerac Cocktails, while my wife enjoyed a glass of Champagne and a couple of Bix Manhattans. Afterward, our party vowed that we would never eat again (having so thoroughly stuffed ourselves in such a decadent manner). Of course, that sentiment barely lasted till the morning. \n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I think it is only fair to mention that the newly appointed Chef de Cuisine is my wife's cousin, but that in no way changes my perception of this fine American eatery. Her cousin is sure to move on some day, and when he does I will most certainly continue to treat myself to one of San Francisco's great epicurean establishments.", "author": "Thomas M."}

But bite sized for an appetizer is perfect in more ways than one.\n\n - Lobster is good. Spaghetti is good. Together as a lobster spaghetti is unique, delicious and surprisingly not as heavy as one would expect.\n\n- Kale is a super food. Kale with whole grain mustard, mushroom and onions is superbly amazing.\n\n- Flounder does not flounder when combined with carrots, asparagus and yogurt. Quite the opposite.\n\n- You must make room for dessert. Otherwise you might miss the rich, decadent and brilliant warm chocolate brioche bread pudding. \n\nDon't forget you had kale already. This makes it a balanced meal.\n\nAdditional learning include retro touches (font, oversized murals, live jazz bands) can really enhance an atmosphere and enthusiastic service is contagious.\n\nOffering to split plates and glasses of wine so we can try more of everything was an unexpected and classy move.\n\nLast but certainly not least learned that 20+ years of friendships are what five stars is all about.

Only because after dating out and about in this busy little city where the continuous supply of men and women are easily updated by the push of a button, the proclivities of this erratic hobby are starting to affect me.  \"Been there done that.\"  \"I'm not impressed\" to \"WTF kind of car is that\" (meaning please don't pull up in a Mustang.  Ugh.)  And \"are you out of your f***ing mind?\"\n\nIn so saying, I love Bix.  I've loved it from every non-date visit/date visit aspect available to me.  Perhaps it is the sense of walking into an old school establishment with the live band at the center and tables centered around and above.  Perhaps it is the leaner feeling one leaves after dropping a several $$$ tab on the table but feeling quite Nouveau Riche.  I did not love the Houndstooth Sportcoat my one date wore years ago and the age of the crowd here made him look older.  How old are you again?  \n\nThe prices here are reasonable for the area.  Just don't come here to order the hamburger.  I had the Sea Bass that came accompanied with potatoes and broccoli rabbe, topped off with a citrus relish.  I know it was broccoli rabbe, because a good friend of mine is on the prowl for this delectable green at the Berkeley Bowl when the season strikes.  I have to confess, that one can do no wrong with Bass if it is prepared correctly without overpowering this delicate fish.  They did a fantastic job in that it was soft, tender and not overly flaky.  I normally do not order fish but this was superb.\n\nAnother time here found me in the company of many good friends and we split a dish (hello, it was around $45) so he was happy to oblige.  Not to mention, the waitstaff were quite accommodating since my male friends tend to get verbally joyous in speech and laughter.  Good thing they are cute to look at.\n\nI like this place.

The decor is traditional, and there is live Jazz music almost every night.\n\nThe menu is quite amazing, consisting mostly of classic dishes given a new twist.

The flavors were fresh, vivid, and the combination of colors was great.\n\nFor dessert, the bananas foster was a treat, albeit it does not come a flambe as one gets in New Orleans sometimes. Still, the flavor, especially with the dark rum instead of brandy, was exquisite.\n\nI highly recommend Bix for a fancy dinner in San Francisco or just for drinks.

At the recommendation of a friend, dined here for the last night of vacation. PERFECT way to end a great trip. Live music on Saturday night. Lively bar scene. Great drinks. Our waitress was fantastic - very nice and at a good pace (not rushed but not left wondering where she was).  Really cool decor. Such an interesting location (basically entrance is in a super small side street/alley) but the restaurant itself is really big and set up nicely - seating on balcony level and floor level. crab rolls for appetizer - yum. I had the duck breast - PERFECT. My friend had the Prime Bavette. She loved it. Panacotta and butter scotch cookies for dessert. both deelish. yes, I know, it;s just cookies. but they were warm and yummy with the side of fresh whipped cream.", "author": "Farzin K."}

I don't remember exactly what I ate, but I remember the overall end result.\n\nI work only a block away, so my boss took me and two of my coworkers here for lunch. We each ordered a starter and an entree. I believe I ordered the Salmon Tartare to start and either chicken or a fish for the meal. Both were good, but not terribly memorable, and SO SMALL. I understand that fine dining values quality over quantity, but I don't eat all that much, so when I'm still HUNGRY after an appetizer and an entree, that's just plain stingy! My poor boss paid $14 for me to have 4 tiny bites of salmon tartare. Divide that number by three and we'll talk.\n\nFortunately, our server decided we were her favorite table of the day (or so she said to make us feel special), so she brought us a dessert on the house.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-09-25", "description": "I'm not very liberal with my 5 star ratings, but this place has earned it. I have always known about Bix since I was a kid. My cousins came upon it when it first opened up in the late 80s and instantly fell in love with it. I was honored when they asked me to join them to celebrate their 23rd wedding anniversary here.\n\nIt is definitely hard to find and the only reason why I knew where it was is because I work right next door. There is rarely any parking (as is the case in downtown overall), but valet is easy, quick and courteous. When you walk in, it's almost like you're walking into a Mad Men episode. A certain je ne sais qois envelops you. With the waiters and waitresses all dressed up in white coats, the 1940's style supper club atmosphere, it is as if you're taken back into time. The service is excellent, water is never left empty... AND the staff was even so attentive that they caught the one non-ice water drinker at our table and came back with the appropriate jug of water. If that's not good service, I don't know what is. \n\nDrinks first... pretty basic highlighted cocktails, but extremely good. The Bellini was very refreshing and their Bix Ricky was like lemonade. The food was beyond awesome. We started with the truffle fries and the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella.  The truffle fries were cooked and seasoned to perfection, not too greasy and their ketchup was surprisingly delicious! The mozzarella in the other starter was home made and very moist. Great flavor. \n\nFor starters we all got something different but tasted each family-style. The Ceviche was the best I've ever had, very smooth and light. The fish seemed to melt in your mouth. We also had the smoked trout salad, the plum salad and the roasted tomato soup. The smoked trout had an amazing flavor to it and the homemade dressing complimented it very nicely. The roasted tomato soup was delicious and even had legitimate grilled cheese croutons in it. Very impressive. \n\nAs if we didn't have enough food in our bellies, dinner came and stayed. Two of us had the beef two ways special for the evening. The spare rib meet was cooked to such perfection that it fell off by just breathing on it. The other folks in our party got the steak and the salmon special. Both enjoyed the food and none of us shared, that's how good it was. The portions are quite generous, so don't think you have to load up on starters to get your food's worth.\n\nLast and definitely not least was the dessert. We all shared the Banana's Foster because we were stuffed, but we probably could have killed two of these bad boys even with full stomachs. According to my cousins, the used to give 3 scoops of ice cream back in the day. Now it's just one, but they pour over the banana, rum, caramel and the flavors are like heaven. This is their signature dessert and believe me there's a reason for that. \n\nGreat place to celebrate a special occasion or to treat your special someone to a nice dinner. Also, they have live jazz. Feel free to grab a drink and chill next to the very stocked bar!", "author": "Jamie P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-05-04", "description": "I had really high expectations of this place from reading the reviews on here.  \n\nGeneral feeling: for a $400 meal between 4 people that included wine, 4 entr\u00e9es, a few appetizers, a salad, deserts, and coffee, I expected a whole lot more.  For those kind of prices, I'm not expecting a blow job under the table, but I am expecting an orgasmic food experience.  This was not it.  \n\nThe good:  I liked the guy playing solo jazz piano.  Great instrumentalist and it was nice to hear in the background.  The decor was nice.  The staff was knowledgable and straight.   \n\nThe so-so:  The food.  I'm not saying the food was bad, it just wasn't mind blowing.  I simply have high expectations when I pay that much for food.  I had the Halibut with veggies in a basil-mint broth.  It was so-so.  Fish cooked well, I mean it is Halibut.  You can't mess it up.  Broth and flavor was okay.  I just wasn't mind-F#$ked which is what I want at a nice venue.   Two others at the table had the steak, which was cooked to order properly, but it was only served with 3 onion bulbs and this puree potato stuff that looks like they plopped it onto the plate via a cake decorator squeezer thing.   Not BAD, I'm just saying... I expect much more at these prices.\n\nThe bad:  It was hot.  I suppose we could have mentioned something about the temperature, but at this kind of nice place, I didn't think you needed to.   What else?  The waitress was a bit pretentious.  I can't pinpoint exactly what it was about here, but she just didn't have a good positive vibe about her. I don't know.  Maybe I expect people to be nice too much.  I just got the feeling like the folks at our table weren't good enough to be in this place, so service was kind of quick (slow rather - I'm talking in terms of feeling)  and I just didn't like the vibe.  \n\nThere are so many incredible places to eat in San Francisco and I look forward to trying so many more.

It was almost comical and fortunately we didn't let her ruin our evening.\n  \nAnd after looking at some of the other reviews I see a common theme.  If you are late for a reservation, or your entire party isn't there you are in trouble.\n\nAnd you pay for it throughout the evening by a bad attitude.  I even got scolded because my backpack was in a \"dangerous\" location.....near my feet.  I didn't check it in because I had an ipad in it.  Now I could have taken it out  and let her take it but the menu said \"no ipads at the table\".  This place has many unwritten and written rules!  And the backpack wasn't affecting anyone as we were in a corner table.  It's not like anyone was walking by and could trip.\n\nI watched this particular waitress all night long and didn't see a smile in the 2 hours we were there....for anyone.\n\nIn fairness, part of our party was late and we got started later than we wanted to.  But we still had plenty of time to eat before next reservation arrived at 830pm.  In fact we left before 830pm so no harm done.\n\nAnd if there is a concern on timing there are polite ways to say there is another reservation at this table later in the evening.  We are reasonable people.  We get it.   We don't need a rude, snippy attitude throughout the entire dinner.\n\nWould I go back?  Absolutely not.  There are plenty of places in the city with good food AND excellent service.

You look down a random alley way that seems like nothing exists down it, but then you see the BIX name in lights. You walk toward it and find a sunk door.

A live band of piano and cello play jazzy kind of music that really sets the tone. Once your table is ready you are escorted upstairs to a beautiful table :) The food was AMAZING!

Overall it was a great night, but I think it may have had more to do with the company than the food. Total stars = 3.5.\n\nSTARTERS:\nDeviled Eggs with Truffles, Radish and Chives: \nThis is the only thing I find myself still thinking about.  Absolutely delicious!! Not too rich, very flavorful, and one of the few deviled eggs around the city that I've seen made without bacon.\nDungeness Crab Rolls in Brioche with Meyer Lemon Aioli: \nThis was just okay and nothing to write home about in my opinion.  This starter has a little too much bread and BIX gives everyone a dinner roll so if I were to do this over, I would save room for another dish.\nPotato Pillows with Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche and American Sturgeon Caviar:\nThis was pretty good and seems to be a pretty popular starter based on other Yelp reviews.  The caviar was a nice touch, and, while good, not something I would have to get if I go back.\n\u00c0 la minute Ceviche with Chiles, Avocado and Toasted Corn Nuts:\nI love ceviche, but unfortunately I was pretty disappointed by this starter.  I am used to having large pieces of fresh fish, but this was served on a plate with slices of avocado and barely any fish (picture included!) If you're considering the ceviche, I would recommend trying something else.\n\nENTREES:\nWagyu Beef Bavette:\nThe boys had the wagyu beef which came with creamed spinach and mashed potatoes.  Since I don't eat beef, I didn't try this, but my boyfriend said it was just \"okay\" and pretty salty (which was a theme of the entire dinner!)  He's someone who loves food and loves his meat, so his lack of enthusiasm tells me a lot.  \n\nTrout with Brussels Sprouts and Onions:\nI had the trout and asked that it be made without bacon.  The dish was just okay; I definitely have had better fish.  Even though it was trout, it came out pink and tasted a lot like salmon.  In my opinion, this dish was too salty.\n\nMaine Lobster Spaghetti:\nOur other friend had the lobster spaghetti and she seemed to really like it.  We didn't try it, but there didn't seem to be complaints there.  It came out in a big dish with some bright tomatoes\n\nDESSERTS:\nBananas Foster w/ Vanilla Ice Cream:\nThis was pretty delicious and I would recommend it - the bananas weren't too sweet and the warmth of the bananas foster worked well with the ice cream.\n\nWarm Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding:\nMeh - I love bread pudding, but the chocolate was just overkill.  The whole thing tasted like a giant brownie that was too dry and waaay too sweet for my taste.  \n\nAMBIANCE AND SERVICE:\n- Definitely a romantic setting with the tall ceilings and dim lighting. I liked that there was valet which was quick and also a coat check upon entering the restaurant.\n- They initially placed us upstairs at a table and we saw an open booth and I'm grateful that they allowed us to move.\n- However, because we were in a booth, the boys sitting on the outside had to get out to allow us to use the restroom.  When we got up to use the restroom, our waiter came over and made a comment about how we can't just leave without paying.  Maybe it was a joke, but it was definitely tactless.", "author": "Alvina W."}

These are big memories to live up to and Bix delivered this past weekend.  \n\nBix has a distinctive air of sophistication reminiscent of a bygone era with the long elegant wood bar, beautiful art, old fashioned booths and low lighting.  It's the place to wear that sexy dress in your closet.  You can't help but order a cocktail or glass of champagne when you arrive to get into the jazzy mood.  In spite of all this or maybe because of it, Bix still has a hip vibe to it.  \n\nGetting to the food...I have never had a bad meal at Bix.  The heirloom tomatoes were ripe from the vine and outstanding with the burrata and basil.  The whole fish was well prepared and expertly deboned.

It was a bit hard to find parking, but we lucked out and came upon a car leaving a meter right next to the alley Bix is in. The meters were free after 6pm, so make your reservations accordingly and give yourself plenty of time to drive in circles (if you choose to drive downtown). \n\nAppetizer: Mini Lamb Burgers. This came with exactly four small burgers, a couple of bites each. They were very tasty, but make sure to say how you want them cooked if you don't want to see red meat.\n\nStarter: Roasted Tomato Soup with Gouda Grilled Cheese Croutons. This was great (also a great portion to share). The best part was the croutons- soft and gooey cheese goodness. The soup itself, although good, was not much better than Campbell's...as long as you use milk instead of water!\n\nDinner: Bix Burger for the wife, and seared Albacore for me. Both of these were really good. Again, make sure you say how you want them cooked unless you enjoy raw food.\n\nDesert: Chocolate and Butterscotch Brownies with whipped cream. These were awesome. \n\nThey knew it was our anniversary and had a congratulatory place-card on the table. We were a bit disappointed that we weren't offered anything complimentary such as a few strawberries but understand that a lot of people probably celebrate there, and it would get costly. \n\nThe atmosphere was really nice: dark and romantic, but it was very noisy from the people at the bar downstairs. The jazz music didn't start until we were getting ready to leave, so I can't say anything for that. The only bad part of the experience is the fact that you can go in dressed up for a nice dinner and be seated next to people in jeans and tee-shirts. The website specifically states \" jackets preferred,\" but people are still hooked on this modern casual crappiness.", "author": "Kurt C."}

Then moved on to our baby lettuce salad with fresh strawberries.  The amount of dressing was just right, not overdone nor underdressed.  The flavor was fresh, organic, refreshing!  Then for main entree, I had the braised short ribs with spring vegetables, marble potatoes, bone marrow and toast with mustard.  Everthing was delicious!  The short ribs and the spring vegetables were flavorful.  The short ribs were tender.  The bone marrow portion was a bit generous and rich for me, but it paired well with the mustard toast.  My friend had the lobster spaghatti.  It looked delicious and she confirmed the taste was exquisite as well! \n\nI was disappointed to find out that they removed the blood orange margarita from their cocktail menu due to it's not the season.

I specifically chose the place because of its ambiance and live music, and both were great! I love how old-fashioned everything feels. For a girl who feels like she was supposed to have been born in the 40s (at least for the fashion), this is definitely my kind of place. \n\nWe ordered the house-made mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto, the split pea soup, the pork chop (a special), the chicken hash, and creamed spinach. Everything was very tasty, especially the chicken hash which is basically a crab cake made with chicken. For dessert we ordered the strawberries with fresh whipped brown sugar cream, and our server brought out complimentary ice cream with a candle in it for the birthday celebration! Speaking of our server, he was also excellent--very attentive, helpful, and available, but he didn't hover. \n\nWe also ordered the Bix pinot noir (apparently they have a winery), which was decent, but not really worth $56 in my opinion. Still, the meal as a whole was surprisingly reasonable in terms of price. The fact that we got to listen to jazz while we ate just made it an even better deal!", "author": "Shawn B."}

Luckily, the spill-ee was very nice and funny about it. \"This is a $200 shirt!!!.... that I got for $20!\" :)\n\nThe manager was not amused lol\n\nAs for my table, the girlfriend was looking gorgeous, as usual. As for me... I could not say the same. I wore a white collared shirt with my black American Apparel hoodie! To say I was sorely underdressed would be an understatement! The girlfriend told me to take off my hoodie and walk to the kitchen and start serving people cuz I looked just like them haha!\n\nThe ambiance of BIX is wonderful. It felt like I was in a modern 1920's film where they go from a black & white shot to a colored view of the interior. Very jazzy, calm, and cool. We sat upstairs where servers would go all the way to the back door and magically end up downstairs again.\n\nSpeaking of servers and service, our server was very nice and prompt. Food came out orderly and quickly. I'm glad we didn't have to wait forever for our food, cuz I was starving! The food was good, but I don't think it was worth the price. I'll rate the food first:\n\nPotato Pillows: Cavier on top was delicious. We wondered if they ordered it in bulk by the barrel-full! Couldn't really taste the creme fraiche, it didn't add anything but color to the dish. The potato itself reminded us of McDonald's hashbrowns. $14 for McDonald's hashbrowns... That caviar better have been really expensive to charge that much for it! We enjoyed it, but not \"$14 enjoyment.\" I'll stick to $1.25 McDonald's \"Potato Pillows\" next time!\n\nChicken Hash - Chicken-y. Don't know what else to say about it. Two patties with ground up chicken mixed with mashed potato and fried. It was kinda bland. Reminded us of croquettes, but in larger form. A dipping sauce might have done some magic for the dish, but it was pretty bare. I like croquettes and sharing them like tapas, but this dish was not worth $20.\n\nBlack Truffle Cheese Burger with Truffle Fries - The burger was cooked exactly the way I ordered it. This was actually my first time just seeing truffle separately in a dish. I've only seen it incorporated within a sauce or seasoning. I tasted it without the burger and, to be very honest and frank, it tasted like a toned-down mushroom. Maybe my tastebuds aren't sensitive enough ;p  I don't think I'll ever spend extra money to get truffle in my dish lol Other than that, the burger was awesome. The truffle didn't add anything to the burger. The grilled onion on top was awesome. The bread was good. If they take out the truffle, can it cost less please? Couldn't taste any truffle on the fries either. Seemed like there was parmesan on it instead... which tasted good though. Overall, I would get this again minus the truffles for a lower price haha Without the truffle, I guess it's just a regular BIX burger? Any time a burger + fries is over $12, it's most likely not worth it.\n\nWarm Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding - The girlfriend LOVED it. She loves bread pudding though. It reminded me of a tame brownie. The whip cream on top looked like an egg shaped ice cream. I wish it was ice cream. But it was meant to not be super sugary and it complimented the rest of the meal, and ended the meal, really well. I'd get this again and thought it was actually worth the price compared to everything else.\n\nNow then, it seems like I was rather displeased with all the dishes that we ate. But, on the contrary, I enjoyed the dishes quite a lot! It's the crazy prices that were not pleasing to me. I enjoyed my entire time there though.\n\nI'm a fan, but I would not come here regularly.", "author": "Timothy L."}

He promised a table on time.  This time we were seated right away.  We proceeded to order bottles of wine and four entrees, and a couple of deserts.  Much to our surprise, the manager comped the ENTIRE meal, our alcohol included, for our previous trouble.  I have never seen customer service like this in my entire life.  We were dumbfounded.

They even recently published their own handbook offering advice on food,drinks, music and art that includes the recipes for some of their most popular appetizers. Their bar is VERY popular with the financial district crowd and rightfully so. \n\nNow about the food - I have tried almost everything and love everything here.

We had a 7pm reservation on a Saturday night, which didn't start off well as we spent $20 and 45 minutes for a 1.5 mile cab ride there (thanks, Chinese New Year Parade). Once we arrived, the unpleasant hostess seated us, and laid our \"Happy Anniversary\" card on the table. Our server was equally unpleasant from \"Hello\"... or lack-there-of (there was no greeting, just \"ice water, yeah?\"). \n\nAbout the food... They brought warm, fresh rolls and butter to the table, which helped soften the taxi-cab and bad greeting blow. We started with the dungeness crab rolls (4 perfectly toasted, buttery, crab-filled mini sandwiches) and the house-made mozzarella and prosciutto (creamy, fresh, salty, everything it should be and more). Hubbs got the truffle burger for his entree - which was pretty close to perfect, and not too overwhelming. I got the red snapper special (after beating it out of the server), which was fresh and tasty, but not as notable as the rest of the meal. \n\nThe snooty manager greeted every other table, but ours. Our server either totally missed the ball, or assumed that we were young, infrequent diners who would automatically tip badly and weren't worth the effort.

I arrived 10 minutes early for my reservation, checked in and asked where to find the ladies room.  When I returned, the host looked at me like I was from another planet and when I asked to be seated, he told me that I would be seated when my entire party arrived, but that I was welcome to make myself comfortable at the bar.  His response made me feel like I was in an SNL skit, because we were right next to the bar, which was obviously extremely crowded--no seats and very little standing room--and I was carrying a purse, coat, gym bag and shopping bag.  It was obvious that nobody could make themselves comfortable at that bar, much less someone who was carrying all of the stuff I had.  I would have understood the \"can't sit until party is complete\" thing if the restaurant had been crowded, but it was not--I counted six open tables.  So I just passive-aggressively stood with all of my stuff right next to him at the host stand for about 10 minutes.  When it became apparent that I would be waiting for much longer (my boyfriend called to tell me he was running about 20 minutes late), I asked again if I could sit at the table, and the host conceded, displaying what appeared to be some resentment.  What is up with that?  There was no way I could order and consume a beverage at a bar that crowded, but I could easily order a pre-dinner drink at my table.  His attitude didn't even make sense for the restaurant economically.\n\nOnce seated, it was a different story.  Our server was helpful and pleasant, and our food was delicious.  The pork chop was one of the best I've ever had anywhere, and the sides were very good as well.  The brussels sprouts side dish was excellent, rivaling Barbacco's (although a much smaller portion).  The ceviche starter was very good, and the bananas foster was a great finish to the meal.  \n\nThe ambiance was lovely, and I really enjoyed the live piano and singing.

You see a small lit up sign outside the door identifying the restaurant but when you walk in the door a huge lovely room is revealed.  1930's themed decor and background music (including a 3 piece jazz trio playing throughout the evening).  The restaurant is a converted State Assessor's building so there are large columns, high ceilings, and part of the restaurant is located on a top floor that looks down onto the main restaurant.  It is dimly lit which makes it conducive to a romantic dinner for two or a nice intimate family/friend dinner. \n\nThe menu is lovely.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-06-25", "description": "A couple weeks ago we went to Bix for a work dinner and were totally unprepared. Yes, it's in the Financial District but it's only three $$$ on Yelp and San Francisco restaurants tend to be a little more laid back. This smaller, alleyway restaurant however is definitely working hard to keep it's classic feel (think piano and jazz singer in the corner, fluted columns and a whole lot of mahogany). I'll be honest, while most of the restaurant customers were in suits, we were rocking a collection of ripped jeans, fleece jackets and plaid. Great apparel for SF, not for Bix. Thankfully the bar area is right near the entrance and their martinis are quite superb.\n\nHowever, it was hard to feel uncomfortable for long as the friendly hosts and servers chatted us up. We slipped into a comfy half booth, half table situation and assess the wine list, which is quite lengthy. After ordering a pinot noir we had a go at the starters menu. First must have on the list, potato pillows. How can you go wrong with something called potato pillows? These bite sized morsels were almost like gnocchi but a little more mashed potato-like. Topped with creme fraiche and caviar, they were decadent but strangely homey in a way. If you're going with a second appetizer (or you have no desire to try something called potato pillows which is just silly), go with the steak tartare. It's prepared table-side, so you get to watch them break up the running egg yoke into the steak, along with shallots, capers (a great addition to any tartare!), parsley and mustard. I also tried the pork belly banh mi (a Vietnamese style sandwich), which comes out in little bite-sized sandwiches and was surprisingly good for an American restaurant with no clear ties to anything Vietnamese. The deviled eggs were good (aren't they always?) but I think you can get better ones elsewhere. I can't recall what the oyster selection was that day but they were pretty gritty and I got a piece of shell in my mouth, so I'd pass on those.\n\nAfter the little banh mi sandwich bites, I was in the mood for pork belly so I went with the pork loin and belly entree. The pork is served atop a warm potato salad with a mustard seed aioli, which gives the dish a punch of flavor. The pork was cooked perfectly. The belly was a good balance of soft and crisp and loin was moist. In retrospect though I wish I had ordered the Bix Club Burger, a black truffle cheeseburger. A couple people at the table ordered it and it looked amazing. I found out afterward's it's on 7x7's \"2013 Big Eats\" list.  I did manage to snag a couple truffle fries from their places, which were of course delicious.\n\nAfter that you'd think we'd be ridiculously full, but what sane minded person passes on dessert? Especially when you have the opportunity to say \"I'll have one of everything.\" After trying a bite of everything and it all being amazing, I can still recommend without hesitation the  bananas foster with dark rum and vanilla ice cream. While it didn't have the fancy flambe presentation, it melted into this creamy soup substance that we were literally trying to scrap the bowl for. To summarize, I'd recommend Bix just don't wear jeans. It's listed on Zagat as a top place for a date, so get dressed up and go with someone special.", "author": "Larisa J."}

Needless to say, I didn't finish the mai tai.\n\nThen the host came after us and he told us he wanted to seat us already b/c he didn't want to \"rush us\" b/c there's a reservation at 8 pm and it's strict. Those were some of the words that he dropped to us... impressive. NOT! What a turn off!\n\nWe got seated, my sis arrived (thankfully) and on to the night.\n\nWe ordered the following:\nME: mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto with olive oil and the Kobe steak with a side of their special mushrooms. The mozzarella was delicious! Really good and just the right amount of goodiness! The Kobe steak was just cooked just right! The mushrooms were a good compliment to the steak. Wonderful. \n\nSis: potato pillows with caviar and lamb burger. She liked both dishes and the potato pillows were delicious. \n\nBro: deviled eggs with truffle and the lamb chop. He devoured both as well.\n\nSis-in-law: potato pillows and she got the special of the night (salmon). Liked it as well.\n\nThe only reason why it's just 4 stars - their host was a jerk. I don't know what was his problem. He gave us an ultimatum of how long we can stay in our table. Such a turn off! \n\nBUT our server was amazing...considering we ordered a lot! We had a bottle of champagne and a pinot. Then for dessert, we ordered a chocolate bread pudding and the brownies with drinks as well. \n\nThe waitstaff (with the exception of the host) - were all great. Would probably come back to take the boy next time around.\n\nThe jazz playing in the background ... just added a good ambiance for the night.", "author": "Cath M."}

Fortunately, Bix is the former.\n\nWhat I would like to add is HOLY CRAP, the Tomato Cart is amazing, and the desserts (try the banana foster and chocolate pudding cake) are pretty b-o-m-b as well. It's cool that they prepare the heirloom tomato mozzarella cheese dish table-side, as well as the steak tartare (American food Benihana style? So ofcourse parents loved it). Pass on the oysters, meh. Also, I don't remember the last time I was served tap water that was filtered at a restaurant. No yucky bleach aftertaste!\n\nAs for the main dishes, they were solid but nothing life changing. The halibut was served over a bed of overly sweet corn and beans, the kobe beef was prepared well but came out luke warm and didn't taste orgasmic like kobe is supposed to, and the lamb was kinda small but executed well like the kobe. All of which however, were very affordable about $28-36 per dish. They'll get you with the $15 appetizers though.\n\nI'd love to come back on Thursdays for live music, happy hour and some good appetizers n desserts.

I like the bartenders in the crisp white jackets. I like the hosts who hold your table against all odds as your party arrives at 7:10 because of some mixed signals. I liked the first two minutes of conversation with the drunk matron at the bar gulping down martinis. The last 58 minutes, not so much. But I'm a better man now understanding that it's no cakewalk being a rich white woman in SF nowadays. Nicely dressed crowd except for the guy carrying the See's candy bag wearing the fishing hat, tan shorts, white New Balance shoes with black socks.\n\nThe dining room was little loud but I would put it just this side of 'festive'. Pork chop was excellent. Bananas Foster was OK but I wasn't blown away. All in all, food was good. Service was crisp. Again, I like the whole 40-something waiter in the white jacket thing.

It appeared she was just getting in the door as the place opened so I would say that the greeting here was less than hospitable and slightly 'snobby' attitude was annoying, The finger food is probably the best thing on the menu I must say but be prepared to spend a lot  for that. The rest of it , forget it. I tried the BIX house special of the chicken cakes from the entre menu  - extremely poor and utterly tasteless. The cocktails were good , but serviced in extremely small glasses ultimately to maximize restaurant profit.\nIt may have been slow this night , but the waiter attending our table and a couple's table ,who obviously wanted left alone, was overly intrusive, likely bored because not a lot of folk were in.

Granted, I got there at 9:30 on a Sunday (they close at 10) so I understand why things may have been a little weird. I hate being the last person at a place, I feel like I'm keeping folks from going home. The server was really friendly and when he made some mistakes was completely open about having made them and apologetic, instead of trying to pretend like they didn't happen, which I appreciated. He also let me pay ninja-style when my companion wasn't looking.\n\nWe started out with the marrow bones, foie gras and steak tartare, and they were all good. I especially liked the stone fruit/fig mostarda that sat alongside the foie and the toasted brioche triangles. The tartare was peppery and brightly flavored with not too much caper and of course you can't go wrong with marrow bones. The little gem salad with bleu cheese dressing was uninspired and nothing I couldn't find in a neighborhood deli. We tried the dungeness crab rolls and they were fine, but nothing to write home about. The brioche didn't taste quite buttery enough somehow. We also had some oysters that were nice and fresh if somewhat gritty, and the dutch apple pie, confusingly made with phyllo, and while it wasn't horrible, it wasn't really anything special either.\n\nTo be honest I know I'm not the target demographic here. It skews a little older and the food is traditional and safe. For what it is, it's fine. If I were older and liked smooth jazz and geometric clip art from the 80s I would be in heaven there.

I felt like I was no longer in SF. Nice romantic place to escape to for the evening. \n\nStarters: I ordered the Steak tartare and the bf ordered Hamachi drizzled with a light citrusy pistachio dressing. \n\nEntrees: I ordered the Lobster spaghetti and the bf ordered the Truffle burger.  For an exorbitant price tag, you'd expect your meal to be excellent.  The lobster spaghetti was okay, nothing to rave about. The bf didn't seem to drool over the truffle burger as well.  The food was mediocre. (I think he LOVEs the ambiance more than anything, haha) \n\nDessert: Warm Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding was heavenly!! This entirely saved the meal...

The dungeness crab rolls and potato pillows were fastastic hors d'oeuvres.  I had a pork shoulder entree that was delicious, and very tasty bananas foster for dessert.  Everyone in my group seemed happy with their food.\n\nOnly two quibbles - the hostess wouldn't seat us until everyone in our group arrived.  That left nine of us standing body-to-body in the doorway, since it was pouring rain outside, and already very crowded inside.  I think it's a little much to expect a group of ten to arrive all at the same moment on a Friday night in San Francisco, and common sense would suggest that a large group should be seated as they come, to keep the doorway clear.  Also, as we were seated about 20 minutes late, the hostess informed us that we would need to vacate the table when the next reservation arrived.  That was two hours after our actual reservation, and the service was snappy, so it didn't end up being a problem - but that's just downright tacky.\n\nAlso, the cocktails were oddly small.  I had a gin martini, and it was just fine - shaken at the table actually, which is a nice touch.  But, frankly it was small.  If this is an effort to prevent drunk driving, I can respect it.  But, if it's a cost saving measure, or worse, a statement about the size a cocktail \"should\" be, I have a problem with that.", "author": "Andy M."}

The staff confessed to the mis-management with the tables, which was fine by us.  Once we were seated we were given delicious appetizers on the house.\n\nFood was very good, with some notable exceptions going both ways.  The oysters were very fresh, my kobe steak was cooked just perfectly at medium-rare, and the arugula salad won universal approval with great greens and wonderful fruit.\n\nOn the flip side, the one vegetarian in our group pretty much got shafted.  There wasn't a single veggie entree on the menu.  After asking the waiter for a vegetarian option, my friend was promised a \"special dish\" prepared by the chef that was served \"all the time to vegetarian customers.\"  What he got was a plate composed of all of the vegetable sides from all the other entrees.  Ultra-lame.\n\nService was good, though our waiter alternated between treating us as if we were first-time restaurant goers and as if were hardened Bix vets.  Very strange.\n\nTotal bill came to about $100 per person given appetizers, salad, entree, wine, drinks.  You could definitely spend a lot less.\n\nOverall, I was impressed with the ambiance and decor and very happy with my meal and service.  I'd definitely come here again.\n\nDudes, dress nicely.

We had excellent martinis to start and were seated promptly by a very friendly hostess.  \n\nOur waiter was frighteningly tall and spoke with a loud, booming voice to describe the specials and take our orders.  We had the heirloom tomato salads, which were made table-side, foie gras and steak tartare for apps.  I had a delicious pork tenderloin here as well (it's my latest addiction), and we washed everything down with several reasonably-priced Napa reds. \n\nYou know a business dinner is going well when the conversation gets loose (martini's and wine always help), and this was no exception.

Is the food and service and ambiance worth a magical \"dining experience\" YES! Living in LA we are surrounded with wonderful restaurants, but this place takes the cake.  We reserved our entire day to indulge in Bix's creations. \n\nFirst Course: Crab Roll: Delicious with a hint of lemon poking at your taste buds and the buttery toast surrounding the cool sweet Dungenous Crab.  A+\nMarrow Bones: Absolutely amazing, these we nice sized marrow bones they do not skimp it's well worth the price even the crostini has a slight garlic flavor which really added to the rich buttery marrow.\n\nMain Course: Chicken Hash:  Good not my favorite, I do not think I would order this again, it reminded me of a high end chicken pot pie in the form of a patty and pan fried.  The meyer lemon sauce with tomato medley served underneath was very delicious.  NY Strip with Sliced Potato Frite and small salad hands down the best steak I've EVER had my fiance agreed who is an avid meat eater.  The lemon infused herb butter atop is irresistible.  Let's not forget the potato slices alongside a garlic aoili simply divine!!\n\nDessert:  Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding : AMAZING nice and crunchy crumbles on top and underneath was chocolate warm pudding.  The Peanut Butter Cookies w/ Chocolate: Sweet, Salty and creamy as it's served along side some fresh cream.  So, amazing as these thin peanut butter cookies and quality chocolate lay atop with flakes of sea salt.  \n\nOur server was fantastic and you are really taken care of there we have zero complaints.  We even had a mishap as we ordered the NY strip Med Rare and it was More Med Well, immediately they apologized and were very attentive.  You want customer service here you have it...their policy is if your steak is cooked improperly and you have to send it back...It's FREE! Not only did the server apologize profusely, but the GM came by the table and made sure we were comfortable several times and even brought our steak out.

Its a Supper club and right when you walk in you feel the energy. They had a jazz band playing all night and we were seated upstairs where we (and by that I mean I had a nice view, my boyfriend had his back to the band) had a nice view. It was a tad noisy in there with the music and the people,  but it was definitely worth it. \n\nWe started off the homemade mozzarella wrapped with prosciutto and we found it to be very light and delicious!! My boyfriend then order the lobster bisque, which was VERY good, but was a little light on the lobster and I had what seemed to be a play on a wedge salad with romaine lettuce instead of iceberg. The bacon and blue cheese with tomatoes was delicious, although they seemed to over salt, the tomatoes were salted when they didnt really need to be with the bacon. I still at the entire thing.\n\nFor our mains, I had the special, which was albacore tuna with green beans and tomatoes and my boyfriend had the truffle burger and fries.   Mine was very light and the mixture of the beans and the tomatoes and the tuna was delicious! We also split an order of the creamed spinach and that was absolutely to die for!!! It was SOOO good! I didn't taste my boyfriends, but he said it was only OK, not worth the $27! His fries were very good, I thought ;) Once again we were both too full for dessert! \n\nThe drinks were very fun here! We saw another table down order the absinthe and the waitress brought out two glasses with the absinthe in it and a sugar cube balanced over the top of the glass and a huge water carafe, which melted the sugar into the absinthe! I have never seen anything like this before! I definitely looked cool. I stuck with the prosecco and white wine, but my boyfriend had the GBL to start with, which was Tanqueray Gin and English Fever-Tree Bitter Lemon, it looked tasty I didnt try it and then he had a Gin Martini, which was excellent. \n\nIf you 're looking for a fun place out, stepping back to the 50's and 60's Mad Men Style, then definitely try this place out!

He also reccomended the DuBol Pinot Noir to match our entrees... Boy were we pleased w/his recommendations! ALL of them were delicious.  The deviled eggs had this truffle excellence, the beef tartare was scraped off our plate, the lobster spag AMAZING, the pork chops juicy (wtih some flavor on top my husband loved!), and the pinot paired perfectly.  Before the meal, we enjoyed a couple of cocktails and to top off the meal,  we enjoyed the bananas foster with a couple of dessert drinks, a 20-year tawny port and one my husband got that I forgot which one now. :P  I think the only complaint was the size of the cocktails pre-dining; otherwise, all the drinks were also awesome.\n\nLOCATION:  Be aware that the restaurant's entrance is in an alley (speakeasy style) and could be hard to find.  Luckily, our cab driver knew the way.\n\nI'd say prepare for this dining experience by getting dolled up, having the big money prepared to be spent, and ensuring you get the right directions (or have the address for the cab) ... then have an amazing evening!", "author": "Jennifer M."}

This place was well worth every effort it took to get there.   They have valet parking for $10 - I recommend using valet, because parking in the area is rough.   When we walked in, I was really impressed with the service and atmosphere.  I loved the old speakeasy feel of it.  I loved the old school bar.  I loved the jazz feel and art.  The food was exquisite.  We had the oysters as an appetizer - they were fantastic.  My better half had the lobster spaghetti - I received a good report.  I had the swordfish with Roasted Sunchokes, Baby Chard and Charred Blood Orange Vinaigrette - It was amazing!!!!  Nothing could have prepared me for the fabulousness of the Warm Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding - It blew me away.  I regret sharing it with my man.

Did I mention they had a Jazz pianist playing!\n\nWhile they only had a few cocktails on the menu the alcohol selection was huge so they could make you pretty much anything and it will be delicious! My girlfriend wanted a sweeter drink and our waiter gave her 3 options of their cocktails that could be sweetened.\n\nThe waiter staff was extremely attentive and knowledgeable. We received some kind of crab cake on the house to \"awaken\" our pallets and it was extremely tasty. I ordered the lobster spaghetti and my girlfriend ordered the salmon and they were to die for! For dessert our waiter recommended the sticky date pudding and it was divine, my girlfriend was debating between the sorbet and the sugar cookies and someone must have overheard us because a waiter came out and gave us little sorbets on the house!\n\nI can't say enough how much we enjoyed our time at Bix!

You need to get a bit of all of the ingredients on the plate to get the fabulous flavors come out with each bite. \n\nMilk Chocolate Semifreddo\nwith Citrus Salad & New Olive Oil 9.25\n   - - This combination of blood oranges with the ice cream and chocolate is a burst of deliciousness that must be had by all!

The decor reminds me of something you'd find in NY with the dark wood, multi-floor layout, large, tall bar and mural. The food was also outstanding. We tried a bunch of appetizers: deviled eggs, crab rolls, potato pillows and the tableside made heirloom tomatoes with homemade mozzarella. We all enjoyed a variety of entrees: lobster spaghetti (YUM), chicken hash and pork...then it was on to dessert. We ordered cheese plates, wine and a bread pudding. All were fantastic.\nThe one downfall we experienced was our server. She seemed to find my friend invisible. Strike #1: When my friend ordered an appetizer (the deviled eggs) they never came. When we reminded our server, she claimed she didn't hear the order -- which was surprising since it was the first thing we asked for. It finally came after our entrees. Strike #2: Again, my friend was first to order dessert - - the bread pudding and a coffee. The coffee came, but no bread pudding. It was about 20 minutes before our server came and checked in on us again until we were able to ask her about it. Again, she hadn't heard my friend other than the coffee order. Strike #3: We asked for our check, she ran it on our credit card. When we went to figure out the tip, we were re-reviewing the itemized bill only to find out it was not ours. Clearly - - she lacks some major attention to detail.\nThe service won't stop me from going again, but if I were to sit in this servers area I would certainly ask to be reseated.

We were hooked right away.  The atmosphere is 1920's speak-easy, and there is usually a jazz combo playing on the weekends.  We had the house mozzarella with prosciutto (which we always start with) and the firecracker shrimp (sadly, this was not on the menu that last time we went).  We each had a dinner special, and then had my favorite dessert, Bananas Foster.\n\nWe have been back many times, mostly for special occasions.

Fast forward 3 years and we went for Valentine's Day. We had the worlds GREATEST waiter, Stew. This guy is straight out of the Great Gatsby folks. \n\nWhat makes this restaurant so amazing is that it was almost exactly the same as it was when we went 3 years ago. I know, I know some of you have a difficult time with things staying the same and I get that. But, when you have a great thing, don't change it. \n\nWe walk in and the Maitre d' greets us (same dude as last time) tells us to sit tight and our table will be ready in two shakes of a lambs tail. He didn't really say that but I always have Pulp Fiction on the brain. Stew comes over to order our drinks and I tell him no adult beverages for this cowboy. He comes back with Sandra's martini (filthy, extra olives of course) and tells me they have a non alcoholic beverage that I might like, so he brings it out. Ginger syrup and cranberry or something and it was much nicer than just having water. We ordered oysters, Kushi's, our favorite, they were very sweet and have such an ultra clean flavor, shrimp with chili aioli. Shrimp were perfectly cooked AND Stew brings out some truffled croques (on the arm which is always great) that  were \"not your momma's grilled cheese sandwich\" as Stew warned us. They are made with this amazing cheese from Italy that is laced with white truffles. Truly amazing little suckers. I had the new york steak, bloody (another shameless Pulp Fiction reference) and Sandra had the day scallops. The steak was cooked properly and topped with a smoked paprika hotel butter, a bit too much of it b/c it started to make the dish a bit too greasy for my taste and the scallops were gushing with flavor. Toward the end of our meal Stew comes walking over, wine glass in hand and swooshes it around a few times before he sets it in front of me. Pinot grape juice from the Nevaro winery which was to die for or maybe even kill for!! Such an amazing flavor and another great  gesture. \n\nSuperb service, quality food, wonderful music and just an all around great experience makes this one of my favorite restaurants in the city.

Things started badly and went downhill.\n\nThe food: I'll stretch and give three and a half stars. The salmon tartare was good and the crab roll good, but nothing to write home about. I had the truffle burger which was excellent. My wife had the lobster pasta which was tired and bland. The prices are skyhigh, which if the food is fresh and inventive, is one thing. The menu is the same as fifteen years ago, and is obviously coasting on past glory. Someone does not have thier eye on the ball, here - At these prices I expect to be blown away.\n\nThe service ruined the night. The front of house people ignored us after we checked in for 40 minutes, although the place was barely half full. When we were finally seated, they gave us a table that was rickety. When we asked to simply move to the next table (empty, as was all of the upstairs), talk about attitude!\n\nOK, we re-grouped, and wanted the night to be special. Not possible with our server. Again, it wasn't like the restaurant was busy, but this guy was pressing us to order entrees as he gave us menus. We felt like all he was interested in was moving us along. Once we ordered, food appeared in bullet fashion, the entrees coming before we were done with appetizers.\n\nNot once did our server check if we had everything and if the meal was OK. We were abandoned. We had to get up and chase this guy down for water, side dishes, desert, and coffee. Not once but over and over.  This is just not OK in a premier SF resturant with a pedigree like Bix. Service should not be slapdash, indifferent, and sloppy.

I came here with my cousins to celebrate a mini bachelorette night out. My cousin arrived for our reservation while the rest of us were running a little late. The host (manager?) at the front approached my cousin and told her, \"Did you know your party is running late? That is NOT Ok .\" He proceeded to telephone the bride-to-be. Here's the jist of the conversation:\n\nHost/Manager:  You're late for your reservation.\nBride-to-Be:  I'm really sorry, something came up.\nHost/Manager: Don't be sorry to me. Be sorry to the business.\n\nWha?? Are you SERIOUS? Guy acted like he'd never dealt with a late reservation before. Not to mention, it was a TUESDAY NIGHT and the restaurant was HALF EMPTY.

Burger #6 was slipping through our fingers....but luckily, the staff were nice enough to give us the next available table...which turned out to be the best table in the house!\n\nThere are 2 burgers on the menu, one that is not obvious which is the one that 7x7 reviewed (fyi, it's called the club cheeseburger and it's in small print at the bottom of the menu).  All three of us ordered the burger and a drink which the waiter brought to us with no fuss.  \n\nNow about the burger:\n\nWhat can I say!  Juicy, delicious, perfectly cooked, perfect bun, great sauces.  Their special sauce was so tasty - cornichon and ketchup roasted together with aioli.   We had started to lose hope in 7x7's list as we'd all found that #10 was one of the best and some of the lower ones weren't that great.  This burger has now replaced #10 as the best burger so far.  It was amazing and even though there were other great choices on the menu, I would seriously order this burger again.  \n\nNow about the restaurant:\nWorld class service (they take your coat...something I love!)\nGreat atmosphere (piano player and jazz singer)\nGreat service...what I can say is that I would imagine a high end restaurant waiter being annoyed when everyone orders one of the cheapest things on the menu but you would never know it.

Bonus points for that.\n\nNow, BIX is one of those establishments that can be described as classy, old-fashioned, yet elegant. It reminds me of Harris' Restaurant, another place where you can relax and rely on professional, understated service and great food. Neither is cheap, but then again, you get what you pay for in this case.\n\nOur gustatory goal was confounded by the fact that BIX has not one, but two burgers. The one that gets the main billing on the menu is the Truffled Pecorino Cheese Burger served on buttered rye, costing you a pretty $27. The burger we were after is called simply Club Cheese Burger and it's hidden in a small box at the bottom of the page. We each ordered that burger, varying only the cheese, and the waiter didn't bat an eye despite it being pretty much the lowest-priced entree on the menu. We decided to get some drinks too. Mine was a Meyer Lemon Collins, because I never pass the chance to try something new made with Meyer lemons, and it was tasty and refreshing.\n\nThe burger arrived on a big plate, along with a bowl of french fries and a trio of ramekins with condiments: ketchup, mayo, and the BIX \"special sauce\". We asked what it was and the waiter said that they take cornichons and ketchup, smoke it over something, and add beef fat and some aioli. It's delicious and I smeared it all over the burger. The burger itself was just great - perfectly cooked to medium-rare, thick, tender, a bit crumbly, juicy and well complemented by the poppy-seeded bun. I also really enjoyed the very thinly sliced pickles and the ripe tomato slices that came on the side. Fries were decent, but the burger was definitely the star of the show. As much as I enjoyed Namu's burger, the BIX one displaces it from the #1 spot.\n\nAlong with drinks, the bill came to about $30 for each of us. Pricey, but definitely worth it for the awesome burger, elegant surroundings (did I mention grand piano and a jazz singer?), and the service. I hope to return to BIX with someone who has an expense account and dig into some other fine offerings.", "author": "Andrei Z."}

Took some of the boys here as they wanted a \"true San Francisco dining experience\". Got A+ service from the staff, had some lovely entertainment from the piano player and jazz singer and all the food was amazing. \n\nStarted with the appetizer sampler of tuna tartare, firecracker shrimp, mozzarella wrapped in proscuitto and the mini truffle cheese croques (the best things EVER). The waiter informed us that the cheese is 65 dollars an ounce and is laced with truffles. Ridiculously good. We also got the steak tartare as that is what Bix is known for...\n\nI got the Ginger Gimlet (have to get the martinis at Bix if you are going)... they bring the shaker out and pour the martini at your table. \n\nFor my entree I got the Lobster Spaghetti which is amazing, I can't seem to stray and get anything different every time I go to Bix.\n\nDessert was butterscotch brownies (more resembled fudge than brownies) and the brioche bread pudding (more resembled a soufflee than bread pudding).

The wine pairing was excellent with kudos to AJ (waiter) and Krishna. \n\nFrom reading reviews I knew that we would be entering the restaurant from an alley.  The little neon sign 'BIX Here' hanging on the wall is the only indication you are in the right alley.  It seems like you might be engaging in something illicit just by ducking into the place.  There is a beautiful bar with a soaring mural and a baby grand piano.  Just as we were leaving the piano player was warming up.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-12-24", "description": "My supervisor often likes to share his knowledge of iconic San Francisco eateries, and thus, Bix was introduced into my life as a pre-Christmas lunch.  According to the Garfinkle, Bix is a type of saloon slash supper club.  Located in Jackson Square, it is totally innocuous, save for a lone neon sign.  However, once you step in, you are transported to a world of tommy guns and a bar which many magazines have said made, \"San Francisco's best cocktails\".  After closing up shop at noon, our party of four arrived at Bix for our 11:30 reservation.  We were immediately attended to by a tuxedo'd man who immediately passed us off to the hostess who ushered us upstairs to a wonderfully located corner table.  Upon first glance, Bix was rather impressive in a throwback sort of way.  The bar was elegant and huge, with hundreds of bottles lined against the wall.  There were paintings on the walls and it was very throwback of the 20's, the golden age of crime.  There was a piano at the side.  All Bix needed were a dozen men in trench coats smoking and buxom babes walking around in bunny suits.   The Garfinkle explained to me that Bix only served lunch during the holidays.  He ordered the chicken hash, I ordered the Louisiana flounder, the Admiral had the smoked trout salad and the OT had the pasta with crab.  We also ordered a bunch of appetizers.  \n\ndeviled eggs with truffles, radish and chives: 3/5  I love deviled eggs and can literally eat them like chips.  However, these were a little too fancy for my tastes.  I think it was the radish that muted the flavour of the yolk.\n\nsalmon tartare on rye with dill and creme fraiche: 5/5  The salmon was so buttery and literally melted in your mouth.  It was delicious and the only thing that sucked was that there were only four small goddam pieces.  \n\nsweet onion and truffled cheese croques: 3.5/5  These were in essence, small gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches.  We got this upon the waitresses's recommendation.  It was good, however, not great.\n\nLouisiana flounder meuniere with white grits, meyer lemon, and tory farm grapes: 3.5/5.  I was stoked about this dish as I haven't had flounder in a while however, left with mixed feelings.  The fish was very tender, however, it was so rich.  I felt that there was just too much butter used.  I was never a big fan of grits, as I never really tasted anything.  However, the heavily buttered fish went real well with the grapes.  It sort of made the entree a candied experience.  It is hard to explain.\n\nPanna cotta/creme brulee: 4/5  I am not a dessert person and because I never had panna cotta, Garfinkle insisted I try it.  It was a good dessert, not too sweet, and went very well with the quince and candied walnuts.  The creme brulee was...well...creme brulee.  Nothing much to note here.  Obviously, the torched top was the best part.  The vanilla beans were also visible.  \n\nWe had a great bottle of wine which names escapes me.  I also ordered a Negroni, which is a gin, vermouth, bitters mixture.  In french, it is called l'apertif.  It basically is good to increase your appetite.  While my supervisor liked it, it was bitter and tasted like rubbing alcohol.  It was basically shit used to clean wounds.  I am sure that it could fuel a Zippo.  I gave the Admiral a sip and he had try really hard to not spit it back out.  This is a drink that will grow hair on your chest.  I am not one who likes to sit back and sip drinks.  For me, drinking is just a precursor to a most savory adventure, often done on Thursday nights.  Our meal totaled out to almost $400 with tip, and for that money, I was not blown away by the food.  The ambiance and service was most triumphant tho and for that, I recommend you come here at least once.  We were seated in a prime corner, overlooking everything.  One thing I might add is they polish and shine the shit outta the floors.  I nearly ate shit on the floor leading to the stairs.

Bix was recommended by the bar manager at our Hotel although not her first choice she did say it was a nice place with good food. Let me start this experience by say ing I love the location and atmosphere of Bix, very unique like a trip back in time.\nWe called to get a late reservation late meaning 8-9 pm but were told 10:30 was all they could offer us; we took it. The lady that answered did say we should come in early and they would be able to seat us before 10:30, which to me usually means 30 maybe even 45 minutes before. We were seated at 10:20pm. At least the live music was entertaining and the bar staff was nice, this made our wait bearable. We decided to order some drinks and appetizers while we sat at the bar. I highly recommend the crab rolls. Its comfort food meets fresh seafood that is a delightful taste. \nOnce we were seated we figured trying another appetizer seemed worth it! We went for the A la Minute Ceviche and all though jalapenos and habanero chiles sound spicy it was not the cilantro oil gave it a fresh taste. The roasted corn nuts were an interesting taste crumbled over a very fresh dish although I loved the many elements of the dish I have never been a fan of corn nuts, so I could have done without. I do get the textural element it brings which is enjoyable I just don't enjoy the taste of them. My boyfriend thought it was a perfect appetizer; he enjoyed the flavor and texture of the corn nuts.\nNow on to dinner... I have to say I expected more our dishes. I ordered the American Kobe Bavette Steak and my boyfriend ordered The Maine Lobster Spaghetti that for this night was substituting lobster with Dungeness crab. Since my boyfriend loves crab he was looking forward to this dish. The pasta is made there and that was not bad very good texture to it, however the rest of the dish was lacking. The cherry tomatoes were very overwhelming and I am pretty sure he never even noticed there was crab in the dish... Where's the crab???\nMy Kobe steak was very bland. Truly all that needs to be said my dinner was bland!\nNow on to the best part of our night the Banana's Foster with Vanilla Ice Cream! Simply DELICIOUS! My boyfriend is not a fan of bananas but the dark rum sauce made him rave about it all night! He recommended it to the couple next to us who also enjoyed it!\nI would say Bix is great for appetizers and drink... even dessert but I was not thrilled with my entr\u00e9e. Our waiter was a very nice guy and that always makes for good experience. The hostess talked too much and another hostess looked at me like I was crazy when I asked if being seated early would be possible. Other than their lack of customer service in the front of the house the rest of our visit had its ups and downs. I would go maybe for lunch.

The dining room can only be described as gorgeous - lots of gilding and a live pianist made us feel like we were in another era. Despite my low-cut lace top and velvet jacket, I felt underdressed. It was tucked away in a little alley near North Beach. As I walked in, I got the sense that I was a special, in-the-know sort of visitor to a well-hidden gem. Of course, they designed it that way. \n\nWhile I liked everything I ate at Bix, I didn't enjoy anything as much as I normally would have. That's mostly because I was feeling really crappy that night, and had virtually no appetite whatsoever. (The next day, I'd be diagnosed with Strep throat, but I didn't know that at the time). \n\nNevertheless, I do recall starting the meal off with a scalding-hot creamy soup (butternut squash with crab, I think), which I sucked down with abandon to soothe my painful throat. Kind of expensive ($10, I think?), but delicious and served at a much-appreciated temperature. \n\nFor an entree, I had the popular \"lobster spaghetti.\" I was in the mood that evening for upscale comfort food, sort of a Campbell's chicken noodle soup for the upper class, and the dish delivered in spades: It consisted of perfectly-cooked spaghetti tossed with tomatoes, a little cream and cheese, and small hunks of lobster meat. Considering the dish consisted mostly of spaghetti, tomatoes, and probably less than 1/4 cup of lobster meat, $36 seemed over-priced to me; but still, the few bites I had were enjoyable. \n\nSince my appetite had nearly left me by midway through the entree, I asked to take the rest home, but then had a little scare when the waiter didn't deliver the quite pricey leftovers back to me. Then I realized that at finer restaurants, they wait until the meal has ended before presenting the \"doggie bag\"\n\nAnyhow, dessert arrived and although I was starting to feel like death warmed over, I took a few bites. I think it was some sort of chocolate bread pudding topped with barely-sweet whipped cream, which tasted yummy, but not in a particularly special way. \n\nWould I recommend Bix?

The burgers and crab rolls normally come in 3 or 4 but since there were 7 of us, they accommodated our orders to provide each of us with a portion.  Nice!  We also had the truffle fries, which had a generous heaping of shaved truffles (which reminded me of parmesan in both taste and smell).\n\nThe Star Route Farm baby lettuce salad with strawberries, almonds, feta & honey with sherry vinaigrette was amazing.  Equal parts sweet and tart, it had a nice balance and clean finish.\n\nAll the entrees were great, especially the chicken hash (Bix's signature dish, looked like crab cakes, delicious) and the mustard crusted pork chop (surprisingly succulent and juicy).   I didn't get to try but others at my table told me that the Bix bacon club burger and the Alaskan halibut were amazing.  The truffle cheeseburger and the American kobe bavette steak were pretty good as well.\n\nBy the time we finished, we were so stuffed we passed on dessert (although I will have to return to try their signature bananas foster and the chocolate brioche bread pudding).\n\nA great place for a special occassion, especially for impressing out-of-town guests with the quality of the food and the interior decor and atmosphere.\n\nWhen we got the bill, it was surprisingly affordable (relatively).  We didn't order alcohol so it came to around $60/person for all that food.  Great deal!", "author": "F. P."}

They were pricey $16 for the small portion, but worth every dollar. I had the Black Truffle Cheese Burger served open face on Rye with Truffle Fries. Holy shit, that was one great burger. I wondered about the truffles, but then found a stockpile of them halfway through the burger. I couldn't believe I ordered a burger, but when it came I understood why it was on the menu. At $28, it might be the best burger you ever have tried. The truffle fries were perfect. GF had the Seared Local Albacore with Fried Green Tomatoes, Tonnato Sauce and Padron Pepper Relish ($27.50)and she was blown away. It was just awesome all the way around.\n\nWorth a mention, but no reflection on the food, or service is when we left, I asked for a cab. The hostess said, \"no cabs tonight, but our 'house driver' will take you back to hotel.\" House driver, I thought, \"shit, wish I would have known, I would have called for a ride to the place instead of calling a taxi.\" So the \"house driver\" is bullshit.

I was pleasantly surprised at how easily they accommodated us and how great the service was despite our large group. \n\nThe restaurant itself is located in a little alley off of Montgomery street. The ambiance was exactly what I was looking for: upscale speakeasy, hidden away from the facade of the city. The interior was decorated wonderfully, and my only complaint about the environment would be that it was just a tiny bit too dark for my taste. \n\nThe hostess was very patient, allowing us to have a cocktail at the swanky bar. When seated, the server was very quick to address my requests for champagne for a toast. Everyone had barely a chance to look at the menu before the bubbly was poured. \n\nAfter ordering a decent Malbec, I had both the potato pillows and deviled eggs as appetizers. Sorry, Mom, your deviled eggs aren't as good as the eggs at BIX. But to be fair, we never had truffles in the kitchen at home. If you do end up going to BIX, these to small plates are an absolute must! The potato puffs especially delighted me with the mixing textures of puff, creme fraiche, and caviar. \n\nFor the entree, I was dead set on the duck trio before the server strongly recommended the lamb. She was right. God knows I love little quackers, but that little lamb was out of this world! I'm usually not impressed by polenta, but the side the lamb came with was just spectacular. That being said, I will have duck next time to see what I missed.\n\nOne word of warning, don't order the red velvet for dessert unless you like an equal ratio of frosting to cake, as well as crunchy coffee/chocolate crap on top.  I didn't take half a star for this only because I don't usually order desserts anyway. \n\nLove this place. You need to go for a special occasion.", "author": "Jeremy T."}

Hidden in a small alley, entering BIX is like going back in time. The restaurant is a throwback to the supper clubs of the 1940's and creates a swanky, jazz lounge mood with its dark mahogany walls, plush booths, and tuxedo-dressed waiters.\n\nSteak Tartare - they still serve *THE BEST* steak tartare I've ever eaten. It's meticulously prepared table-side with a medley of shallots, capers, and mustard, and served with slices of black olive toasts. It's meaty but light and satiny, and the flavors are fresh and vibrant.\n\nSeared Scallops with Butter Beans - Mmmm, butter beans. I've never had butter beans before and these were soft and creamy. I actually enjoyed the beans more than the scallops. The scallops were nice, but could have used more of a sear on the outside.\n\nBlack Truffle Burger with Truffle Fries - they don't mess around with burgers here. This open-faced burger was huge with a generous layer of truffle shavings. The burger was thick and juicy, but I couldn't really taste the truffles. The truffle flavor was actually more pronounced in the fries, which were delish! I looooooooove truffle fries dusted with parmesan cheese - seriously, one of my favorite things to eat in the world.\n\nBananas Foster with Dark Rum & Vanilla Ice Cream - I was surprised they didn't prepare this table-side...must be a fire hazard. I wish they had caramelized the bananas more, but the dessert still satisfied my sweet tooth. \n\nTo sum it up, BIX is a classy restaurant serving classic food...an oldie but goodie.  \n[TIP: Request one of the booth upstairs - it's much cozier.]", "author": "Karin V."}

I have been to Bix several times in years past due to its lovely, warm appearance and delicious food.  My experience was weird -- maybe the strangest I've ever had anywhere.  I walked in with my girlfriend, our coats were taken, and we sat down at the bar for pre dinner drinks and appetizers.  Both of us were in a pleasant mood, having had a nice day and looking forward to a romantic dinner.  I chose to take her to Bix.  Things immediately took a negative turn however as we sat at the bar and I greeted the bartender (mid-aged with glasses) with a smile and hello.  To which he responded with a cold stare, and silence.  He stood there staring at me without a word or movement (such as handing me a menu) for a good 15 seconds.  I then repeated myself and said hello again, waiting for an appropriate, welcoming response.   He still said nothing and continued glaring at me.  It was quite unsettling and awkward.  My girlfriend had gone to the restroom and I sat there feeling increasingly angry weirded out by this oddball's bizarre chilliness and it made me wonder if I had somehow wronged him in the past (never seen him before though).  He did not like me for some unknown reason made us feel like vermin.  I honestly began to feel discriminated against. We were dressed nicely but not formally.  I had a windbreaker on instead of a dinner jacket.  My girlfriend has a darker complexion.  I don't know, maybe he had a bad night, or hates tourists (yet, we're local natives of over 40 years); or perhaps I reminded him of someone from his past?  I don't know, but whatever his problem was I felt very uncomfortable.  Unfortunately, he managed to remove my smile and good mood with his coldness.  When he finally spoke he attempted to get me to order a bottle of wine -- at the bar!  I should have grabbed my girlfriend and left but gave him the benefit of the doubt.  I was determined not to let this jerk ruin my date and so when my girlfriend returned we ordered wine and appetizers.  The food and wine were excellent.  Still, the bartender remained cool to us and remained inattentive.  A snob?  But for what, why?  I just ignored the prick and focused on my girlfriend, but remained irritated and angry afterwards because I really wanted to sit down to dinner with her there.  Instead, I told her I didn't like this guy one bit and was very disappointed.  I took her to an Italian place up the street which was festive and much, much warmer than chilly, uncomfortable  Bix, ruined by snobby bartender behind the bar.  \n\nGood food, but not worth the disrespect and discomfort that can tarnish a date.\n\nPS  Called and wrote to manager over a week ago; no reply so I'm posting here.", "author": "Bill V."}

We were seated right away upstairs, but once we got upstairs and realized there was no air we asked for a seat downstairs.  We were there at 5:45 with hardly anyone there and were refused.  It then took us 20 min to get even a glass of water, not to mention our cocktails, appetizers, and dinner order taken.\n\nThe food itself was great.  We had the firecracker shrimp as an appetizer.  I had the kobe steak &amp; my boyfriend had the lobster spaghetti.  We couldn't even have dessert or finish our drinks because we were so damn hot.  There were people next to us that just got up and left before dinner even started. It wouldn't have been bad, but we felt like the waiter was ignoring us a bit and we just wanted to eat and get out of there.   We did finish our drinks by the bar, but were totally annoyed.  The only saving grace was the awesome bartender who gave us a little more wine since he could tell we were sweating our asses off the last two hours.", "author": "Kim D."}

The martinis shaken table-side were excellent. \n\nThe bad: The food was not nearly good enough to justify the prices. My wife's duck was under-whelming.  The same was true of my pork shoulder and belly.  My daughter did like the lobster spaghetti, however.  The tastiest part of the meal was the three tiny potatoes accompanying the entree.\n\nThe ugly (and incomprehensible!):  I started my entree with a bite of the side greens.  Imagine my surprise when I felt something hard.  When I spit out the food, I FOUND A SHARP SHARD OF GLASS THE SIZE OF MY THUMBNAIL!!  If I had swallowed it, a trip to the hospital would have been in order, at least. Fortunately, the roof of my mouth was only slightly scratched -- no blood. After quietly alerting our server, the manager came, asked if I was ok, thanked me for being so calm, and explained that the glass apparently was a piece of a broken ramekin.  He had no idea how it could have ended up in the greens.  He then told me that my dinner would be on the house.  The table also received a complimentary dessert. Our bill still came out over $200 before tax and tip.  Needless to say, the incident ruined the enjoyment of the dinner for our entire party!  While I didn't ask for any accommodation, it shocked me that the entire bill wasn't taken care of!  If it had been, I would have been satisfied that the restaurant had done everything possible  to make things right, and I might have passed on this review.\n\nNeedless to say, I will never go back, and I could never in good conscience recommend this place to anyone else.", "author": "Stephen J R."}

As a massive generalization, I would say the first courses trump the entrees at Bix.   The mini Banh Mi sliders were off the charts good, and you can't beat the Bix deviled egg.  Speaking of beets, the beets were wonderful with a blue cheese pana cotta and a stunning presentation.   I ordered the salmon, and it was average.

We looked up this place and it was said to be a great one for birthday dinner, romantic and all the right \"categories\" were checked that made it seem like a great choice.\n\nReservation was made one month in advance for 8:00 pm dinner at BIX. We arrived 7:55 and noticed the place was packed. The host told us to wait at the bar and start with a cocktail. I started to look around and noticed there were as many people standing in the cramped bar area as at least half of the dinning room size downstairs. Could it be that these people were just having cocktails? No they all were waiting for a table. So I wondered how we could possibly be seated on time? Ok so a popular place we can hang out for a few minutes...so it's now 8:30 and we are still waiting and more people are arriving. \n\nIt was very difficult to not let this ruin our mood. We had taken a cab from across town, already had a drink at the bar and when my boyfriend asked the host why we are not seated, he was told because the people were not leaving their tables. Well I'm sorry for a 4-5 star $$$$ category, one should not have to wait as if we are out for a brunch at Zazie's or casual dinner at Puerto Alegra (two examples of great restaurants that set the expectation correctly). We left, it was such a disaster. They almost ruined my birthday. They did not offer to buy us our drinks or anything. It made me remember another birthday I had, we went to Gary Danko and they had us wait not more than 5 minutes and right away poured us Champagne on the house for making us \"wait\".\n\nSo here is the bottom line, this place was half filled with more people that looked like they had come to dinner on their company and for business and some just for a night out. For your special occasion this is not the place. They did not CARE at all about their impact on our evening and fortunately we live San Francisco where there are plenty of fantastic restaurants and we got a table at Chez Spencer (which was our choice last year) right away, were treated so well.

Despite the seemingly grumpy woman at the door, our coats were taken quickly and we were seated moments later. The ambiance of the restaurant definitely feels \"old-timey\" and romantic with live piano music, art deco-ish details and a beautifully lit bar. Our server was very attentive and pleasant and helped us along with our food choices.\n\nThe food- I was nervous after reading previous reviews, but I found their food to be quite tasty. We ordered the meatballs as an appetizer and a Caesar salad to share--both were wonderful.\n\nNext for our entrees, we had the duck breast and the pork chop. Both were very tender and good, and we were both impressed by the \"bedding\" of kale and butter beans under our respective dishes. We also ordered a side of creamed spinach, which was amazing.\n\nThe price- We did sort of go all out with cocktails (which were okay), a bottle of wine and coffee and dessert after the meal-- but still, the place felt a bit on the pricey side. For the average 30-something, this restaurant is definitely a once in a while type of destination.\n\nTruth is- though this place was good- and there was nothing amiss- there wasn't anything that particularly stuck with me after I left. I suspect the ambiance is the biggest draw, but I think you can find similar for cheaper.", "author": "Jessica H."}

It was probably just luck, but we landed the table right in front of the piano and right between the old money family celebrating their tortured gay art student son's birthday and the couple visiting from SoCal that were finger banging each other all night.  Your experience may vary, but sitting next to the musicians would have been fantastic even without all of the peripheral entertainment.  \n\nThe food, as expected, was phenomenal.   If you want recommendations, try the gulf shrimp cocktail which is perfectly cooked and served with amazing spicy dipping sauce; the hearts of romaine with Point Reyes bleu cheese, very rich and perfectly crunchy; the fried pork chop, better than my grandmothers, just don't tell her I said that; or the Kobe beef steak, accurately described by our waitress as the less tender but more flavorful of the two steaks on their menu.  The only thing I ordered that I wouldn't rush to order again was the asparagus side.  It wasn't bad, I just wasn't a fan of the pickle/boiled egg relish that came with it.", "author": "dan d."}

Getting away from the humdrum of franchised or hotel restaurants around Moscone Center was really a treat and relief.  BIX feels like old San Francisco, with two floors of dining, an extensive bar and live music as the evening drew on.\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the deviled eggs with truffle (to die for!) and salmon tartare.  I would've ordered the bone marrow but it required a 15min wait, and we were too tired to wait.  For mains, a couple of us had the lobster spaghetti ($25 for small portion), pork chops (2 huge chops - seemed like the most value for money), and fish of the day which was halibut.  We were all complimentary of the food.  I had the lobster spaghetti, which had big chunks of lobster and the right amount of pasta cooked al dente.  You will want to specify to the waiter the portion desired as they seem to automatically put you down for the $40 unless otherwise instructed.\n\nThe place got noisy when the piano and singer started, by which time we were pretty much done eating.

We take a drive into the heart of downtown San Francisco, go down this small alleyway and stop right in the middle. A valet pops out of nowhere and opens the car door. We're quickly ushered into a classy joint,  full of history. \n\nWe were early enough to grab a few cocktails and I got to admire our elegant surroundings. The mahogany bar spoke of old cigars and C-Suite conspiracies. Golden soft lights illuminated a beautiful 2-story dining room. Although this place was definitely more suited for a romantic supper than a power dinner with colleagues from my firm, it wouldn't stop me from enjoying myself. \n\nThe meal, my God was that a meal! Having done my homework in Yelp and armed with all the past reviews, I shared some recommendations. We started off with a few appetizers. As warned by others, the potato pillows with American sturgeon caviar was like biting into a heavenly cloud. The mini-lamb burgers were cute and delicious. Torchon Of Artisan Foie Gras with spiced quince and toasted brioche is as good as any. The Marrow Bones \"St. John\" - it was succulent, sweet and my absolute favorite of the bunch! \n\nFor dinner I ordered the Fresh Maine Lobster Spaghetti with rich lobster cream. It was slightly disappointing that were no large, identifiable pieces of lobster. Hey, I'm being honest! Others ordered the American Kobe \"Bavette\" Steak with pommes puree and the Chicken Hash Ala Bix which folks polished off their plates faster than I could sneak my fork in it! After a few bottles of wine, we were feeling rather toasty. \n\nWhen dessert came around, I was very selfish. While other shared bites of their El Rey Chocolate And Butterscotch Brownies or spoonfuls of Warm Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding, I slowly and silently savored my Bananas Foster with dark rum and vanilla ice cream. Sure, they tried to get my attention, but I made sure not to make any eye contact. \n\nI don't want to forget the first-class service - it was impeccable and they missed nothing!

Very oniony and fresh tasting.\n- Mahi mahi special: seared raw mahi mahi over a fresh bean mixture\n- Firecracker shrimp: large prawns lightly fried and served with a creamy sauce\n- Pork chop: I don't even like pork and this was delicious. The spinach on the side was the best spinach I've ever tasted.\n- Kobe beef: I heard it was great but only tried the mashed potatoes...\n- Mozarella/prosciutto balls: somewhat bland compared to the other amazing dishes\n\nThen, the grand finale... the dessert! They brought candles a top of our bananas foster and the whole table sang happy birthday. I consider myself a bananas foster critic and this was five times better than the second best I've tried.

I like the fact that it's off the beaten path a little, but still accessible for folks who work downtown.  BIX has an old school traditional vibe.  You walk in and see a long bar to your right, with a mural as a backdrop.  Martini glasses are in crushed ice chilling perfectly at the bar.  The drink menu contains classics like the sidecar, sophisticated but not too fruity variations on the martini, manhattans and various wine & champagne options.  I opted for the manhattan and was pleasantly surprised to find the libation to be firm but open and perfectly mixed.  \n\nFor dinner we walked up the staircase and sat at a nice table with some privacy.  There were several booths that larger parties shared with plenty of intimacy.  The jazz downstairs transported me to the 20s and made the manhattan more relevant.  \n\nI ordered the pillow potatoes with caviar, the trout salad and the ribeye and topped all of that off with a nice Napa '04 cab.  The food was excellent.  I will definitely come back soon.\n\nThis place would be a five for me with the exception of two things:\n- It was a little loud.  The acoustics for the room aren't great so the live music plus the chatter made the room a few notches louder than what I would expect for a nice sit down dinner.\n- Our waiter was a little sarcastic.  I didn't find his style to suit the class the rest of the place exuded.  He seemed disinterested in my gf and me.  While our food was well timed and we weren't rushed, I still felt that he attitude detracted from the night.", "author": "John M."}

Somehow this place has an ambiance that keeps people returning and others snagging a sought after reservation (after waiting weeks). The food is good - very consistent and yes, a bit on the pricey side, but after several visits, I believe a good time at BIX depends on the occasion and the timing of your reservation...possibly the people you dine with, too. If you use Open Table, then it's no surprise the top rated restaurants keep the prime time reservations under their control so often you're stuck with an early time. BIX is a popular stop for the younger set to be seen at the bar, but the place comes alive later in the evening, especially when the jazz ensemble begins their speak easy tunes. \nNot sure how we snagged a four top upstairs because we're nobodies. BIX would be a stop for the SF mayor (or ex-mayor) or similar notable types, but we enjoyed the setting nonetheless. Brian was our server. When he didn't show an attitude on sight of the wine we brought was the tip off that he would treat us right. Wine corkage is $25. Upon Brian's recommendations, we ordered several appetizers, which were all delicious. Who orders fries at an upscale restaurant? I did. They had the perfect balance of garlic, parmesan cheese...yum. I so wanted to order the cheeseburger and another order of the fries, but I succumbed to inner pressure and settled with the sea bass. I believe it had asparagus and small slices of ham. Very different taste...a little salty but a nice balance that was fresh and pleasant. My husband and our guests ordered the fish specials as well. Everyone was completely satisfied and too full for desserts. Again, the food was very good but it was the efficient, genuine, and easy going service that we received from Brian that made the evening memorable for this visit to BIX. This SF restaurant should be on your list. Because of the overall experience you can enjoy, the atmosphere and servers, the extra cash is worth it - even if it's just a one time shot, especially if you're looking to wine and dine someone special. BIX is tucked away. Get directions. Don't let the snooty ladies at the door put you off. BIX is unique. There's no doubt what it is and has always been. BIX never changes and that's a good thing. **Request Brian...he's a nice guy.", "author": "Kathy H."}

Fellas, take written notes on how to court a lady:) He hit the ball completely out of the park! From the moment we stepped out of the car, the service at Bix was superb.

The timing and progression of our meal was spot-on. We started with the Dungeness crab rolls on brioche which were fabulous and I had my signature cocktail. I moved on to the asparagus soup, which I loved as well. I found it to have tons of flavor, without overdoing it. If you love asparagus, you'll really enjoy this soup. For the main course, I had the grilled Salmon. It was medium-rare and cooked to perfection!!!! My date had the Kobe Bavette steak. I don't do red meat, so I unfortunately can't comment on it. He said it was excellent and I trust his palette completely:) We both had a Pinot Noir that our server suggested and it paired perfectly. For desert I opted for the chocolate brioche bread pudding. It was warm, decadent, and just yummy. I didn't finish it however, and for a sugar fiend that is saying A LOT.

The fish melted in my mouth and that sauce was mostly buttery (which I love, despite what it does to my thighs) with just a hint of lemon.

But in addition to stuffing my mouth with animals, I also noticed that the vibe of this place was pretty great. The ceilings are super high (always a bonus), the warm glow of the room was very conducive to a good mellow time (a preferred element for moi) and the bar itself is absolutely gorgeous. Dark woods and lots of bottles, yum-E. \n\nA few weeks after the meat party, I found myself in the neighborhood craving some wine (again, go figure) and stopped in here once again for a glass of vino and it was just as cool as the first time I went... even though there wasn't mass amounts of meat. And so the point of this story is, this place is cool beans and if you like a chill environment, a really cool bar staff and an open kitchen (love that too!!) then checky check it out.", "author": "Stephy S."}

Though you should know that it can get somewhat loud in this joint.\n\nThe atmosphere is old, art deco, dinner jazz club.  Live jazz musicians play at night (not sure if it's everyday or weekends only).  Reservations recommended, but if you come without and there are no tables available, you can also eat at the bar.  There's a really cool mural for you to feast your eyes on behind the bar, too.  There is a downstairs eating area and an upstairs too (I am partial to the upstairs since it allows me to watch all the action below).\n\nI also love the area the restaurant is in.  Located in an alley in the Financial District, from the outside it looks like a hole in the wall restaurant only for VIPs in the know (and you might even miss it, if you're not paying attention).  I love the walk to and from the car to the restaurant: walking by the art galleries in the area, distinctive and elegant brick buildings--can be quite a romantic stroll.\n\nOverall: One of my favorite special occasion restaurants in the city!", "author": "A C."}

We wondered, \"Were those so incredible b/c we are starving, or b/c they are so damn good?\" \n\nSitting down to dinner, we couldn't order fast enough. The waiter knew just what we needed--foie gras and sauternes was delivered in minutes and he gave us great recommendations for dinner. Let me just say that I would personally massage and sing to the cows or whatever else goes into making Kobe beef so incredible--it was the truest expression of love that I gave a slice to the green-eyed boy. Even my side of creamed spinach (thanks for allowing substitutions, chef!) was exceptional. The pork chop and sunchoke gratin was also popular. \n\nNot wanting this hedonistic feast to end, I insisted on ordering the cheese plate and dessert wine.

Unfortunately, we were not dressed up, nor did we have reservations, but the host was still very gracious & told us he would let us know if a reservation didn't show up...and we snagged a seat at the bar.  \n\nThe vodka/sodas are strong, and the atmosphere in here was almost of the 50's.  I almost expected to see the waitresses dressed as flappers, the waiters had coattails.  The decor was velvetty red & golds. 2 stories with a winding sweeping staircase. \n\nWe chose to just get some appetizers to share: \n\nFirecracker Shrimp with Chile Aioli $10.50 - O.M.G. O.M.G absolutely mouthwatering deliciousness that just melts in your mouth.  I am seriously salvating right now as I type and think about this orgasmic dish.  The shrimps are large, 4 pieces perfectly breaded with this awesome spice..dipped in the spicy aioli and it's a flavor explosion.  So freakin' good. \n\nDungeness \"Crab Rolls\" in Brioche with Meyer Lemon Aioli $15.75 - these \"rolls\" look like little finger sandwiches with the crust cut off...and this too was little bites of heaven.  The bread on the rolls were buttery & crispy on the outside, the crab stuffed in the middle was sweet & melts like buttah.  wow\n\nMini Lamb Burgers with Cucumber, Dill and Harissa 10.95 - this i would have to say was my least favorite,but only because I'm not a huge fan of lamb.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2006-05-09", "description": "My recent visit to BIX was a parade of horribles.  We had a reservation for 8 pm.  At 8:30, the table was still not ready and the hostess told us that the people dining at the table, that we had reserved, had paid but were not getting up to leave.  In such situations, any good restaurant would politely approach the dead beats and would inform that that they are glad the free loaders enjoyed their dinner and are enjoying the ambiance but that the table is again reserved and needs to be cleared for the next patrons and that they should move to the bar.  At 9:15 (an hour and 15 minutes after our reserved time) our table was finally ready.  The hostess did not offer even an apology let alone a comped drink or dessert for the wait.  \r\n\r\nAfter having waited so long for the table and spending over $100 for drinks at the bar without a comp, I normally would be angry enough that I would not be able to enjoy the rest of the evening no matter how good the food and service.  However, in this case I was determined to have a good diner because I had been wanting to dine at BIX for quite some time.  \r\n\r\nThe first time the waiter approached he was rude and had forgotten the wine list.  When he returned 15 minutes later and threw the wine list on the table nearly knocking a glass to the floor, he was not any nicer.  My three guests and I ordered a bottle of wine along with appetizers and entrees.  Our orders covered a good variety of the menu and we were all set to taste BIX's highly touted offerings.  \r\n\r\nThe food was so bad that I am going to offer an overall review rather than item by item so as to avoid having to pen a novel.  Most of the dishes were brought out luke warm or partially cold.  The food was buried in sauce to the point of absurdity.  The quality of the underlying meat was less than that of a school cafeteria.  Sauces should accent , not overpower, the flavor of the foods that they accompany.  However, when you are serving sub-par entries, I guess you have little choice but to slop them in a mountain of sauce and grease.  \r\n\r\nShame on BIX for even serving such poor quality food.  If they can't afford to buy top quality ingredients then they should raise their prices.  I don't mind paying for quality but I do mind when a restaurant touts itself as a high end establishment and then serves food that is of lesser quality than mall food court.  I wasted a perfectly good evening eating this sludge when I could have gone to any of  hundreds of quality San Francisco restaurants.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, the wait staff at BIX is obscenely incompetent.  One of 50 or more examples of such was when our waiter arrived prior to a new course being served and dumped a handful of flatware in the center of the table as if he still thought he was still working at an army mess tent.  \r\n\r\nIn sum, BIX is the type of restaurant that appeals to people who judge the quality of the food and dining experience by the size of their bill.  However, for any real foodie, skip BIX and stick with Gary Denko, Boulevards, Fifth Floor or One Market- places that match quality with price!", "author": "Devin W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-10-16", "description": "There seems to be scant little to add to a restaurant that has been reviewed 280 times.  Nevertheless, in my own inimitable style, I present this review.\n\nI was dining with a fellow who owns his own plane.  Owns, in fact, a charter company which has a number of planes.  And he was flying himself down to San Diego after dinner, which meant (1) we were eating early, and (2) he wasn't drinking.  We showed up at about 5:15 (I said we were eating early), which is 15 minutes before the restaurant portion opens, so we bellied up to the bar.  He had a Coke, I had a Crown & Coke, which the bartender served with a VERY liberal pour.\n\nIn a town full of bars and restaurants, few establishments seem to pay much attention to their bar glassware.  And frankly, there are a lot of ways to do it right.  You come to my house and your scotch will sit in a tumbler that weights about a pound, with a thick and heavy base with a bubble blown in it.  That's one way to do it right.  Bix chooses another way to do it right, with elegant but not delicate glasses that exude class and sophistication.  Does all of this mean that you, on your next trip, will sit and stare in rapt attention at your glassware?  No, but it does mean this: when a restaurant gets the small details right, you have more confidence that they will get the big stuff right, too.\n\nThe maitre 'd very politely collected our coats and my attache case (and didn't hover waiting for a tip when he returned them at the end of the night), and showed us to our table.  I wish Bix had a few more options for people who aren't seafood lovers, but that's a common complaint in upscale SF eateries.  I had the pork chops, with the mini lamb burgers to start.  The lamb burgers were tender and juicy.  Most could have used more cucumber---the one burger which had a generous cucumber topping was fantastic, and subversively Mediterranean in flavor.  Bix made me a Manhattan with a small batch bourbon which I wanted to try, and nailed it.  Not too sweet, not too small, excellently done.\n\nThe pork chops were fantastic, and the figs which came with it were an excellent compliment.  The spinach bed was not overcooked, an almost epidemic problem.  The skin-on baby gold potatoes were nice, but a bit uninspired.  I had a glass of malbec (hey, just because my dinner companion wasn't drinking, that doesn't mean I can't), which paired very well.  Malbec is an excellent wine if you're having meat and have been drinking for awhile.  Good malbecs are dark, earthy, and spicy, brooding like a scorned wizard.\n\nThe total experience was wonderful: great food, attentive service, and comfortable decor.  And it wasn't as much as you might expect: about $50 a head.\n\nI'll be back.", "author": "Ben P."}

It was honestly bizarre.\n\nAs the night went on and we were eating, he tried to take my plate before I was finished.  Finally when were were done eating we were asked if we wanted anything more and we didn't.  We were very ready to leave.  As we waited for our check, we discussed the service and decided to ask for the manager.  My friend told the manager that the server was overly attentive to the point of rude.  I commented to the manager that I wouldn't expect this in fine dining.  His response was that this was more of a \"gin house\" than fine dining and that they were \"trying to turn the table\".  He stated that we'd been there for 2-1/2 hours.  We had actually been there for fractionally less than 2 hours.  The couple next to us was seated at the same time.  They did not receive the same type of service and they were still there when we left.  The group next to us left shortly before us and they were seated before us.  Perhaps they had different waiters.\n\nI understand this is a business and businesses need to make money.  That being said, we were rushed from the second we sat down, not just at the end.  Why were we singled out and treated rudely?\n\nIn any case, this singularly defined the worst dining experience in my lifetime.  The service was so abrupt and pushy and the response from the manager was insulting and unacceptable.  \n\nI will never go into Bix again, ever.  I'm disgusted.  I work in the S.F. Financial District and there are far better restaurants with management that doesn't support treating their customers rudely.", "author": "Patricia R."}

Excitedly came here for my bday w/hubby 8/2/14, dressed-up deco for this deco restaurant. Had come here numerous times after it opened and in past years, food and service were always top notch. Only good service remains. Two stars: one for the hostess, and one for our waiter Chris. Ordered a bottle of champagne, the \"sommelier\"? opened the bottle, and soon had champagne spilling onto floor. \"Gee, didn't expect that\" was all he said, after wasting our precious elixir and using his foot and a rag to wipe it up. I expected him to say, \"I'm sorry, let me make that up to you with a glass of our house champagne\" or something like that, but no. Appetizers--the Pacific Oysters were amazing. Entrees: Sea Bass. One bite of was enough. Both WAY over cooked, leathery, super salty, and completely inedible--for $32! Sent back immediately. Chris was super nice and professional, apologized and explained the sea bass is brined. What? Why? Really? Replacements came, much better, cooked properly and not THAT salty, but still tasted salt. Dessert: me-chocolate bread pudding, hubby-Bananas Foster. Bread pudding was hard and dry--it's supposed to be bread pudding, not an old brown sponge. We drowned it in the bananas Foster and melted ice cream, which added much needed moisture and made it edible. Ah, so much for the excitement of Bix. Needless to say, we're never coming back, and we're spreading the word. For the prices they charge, there are just too many better choices. Let's leave this place for the tourists, who packed the place in their t-shirts and jeans. Let them eat $$$ dry sea bass and bread pudding. What a disappointment!", "author": "Audrey C."}

They also had these weird electronic art paintings that looked like a chalk board from far away.   Apparently you can only see the art if you are up close.  So we walked up to it to try and see this fabulous $11,000 pieces of art - still to no avail.  We had to bust out a digital camera with a flash in order to expose the picture, so we could understand what it was we were looking at.  A waste of $22,000 if you ask me.

It's worth traversing past the homeless adorning the sidewalks of the alley to step into a restaurant reminiscent of the 30's and 40's.  The restaurant was packed for a Monday night, so reservations are highly recommended.  Also, you won't be seated until your entire party arrives.\n\nFood:  4 stars.   The menu contained so many interesting items, but everyone in my party strategically decided to order something different so we could try each other's dishes.  That made for an interesting spectacle.  Everything we had was good to excellent, including the potato pillows (glorified tater tots), mini lamb burgers, steak tartare, halibut ceviche, summer squash soup, chicken hash, kobe bavette steak, pork chop, and cheeseburger (with truffles!).  The menu is a bit misleading, as it doesn't mention that the french fries that come with the cheeseburger are actually the same truffle french fries that can be ordered as a side dish.  Best thing on the menu is the bananas foster.\n\nService:  5 stars.   Service was impeccable, from the warm hosts to the attentive and professional staff.  I also liked the fact that they had a piano player at some point during the meal.\n\nAtmosphere:  4 stars.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-03-09", "description": "This was my first real meal in San Francisco that didn't take place in a conference room or at the airport, and what an excellent meal. First, the ambiance. Bix is located in an old speakeasy, down an alley, and it gives off an almost clandestine vibe. Inside, the combination of high-vaulted, open space stretched over two floors with dark wood paneling and art deco style, smoky jazz-age lights gave a refined vibe. The service is excellent. Despite being nearly an hour late for our reservation, the restaurant kindly accommodated us. Our server was professional and friendly. Still, the food was by far the highlight of the evening. I had had a big lunch, so I skipped starters. My dining companions gave rave reviews on theirs, the oysters and the Caesar salad. For my main, I had the Wild Flounder with Louisiana Blue Crab and Chard over White Grits. The Louisiana Blue Crab was sweet and tender and blended well with the lemony, earthier taste of the chard. I liked the way the flounder was cooked, I believe lightly pan-fried for a crispy outer and softer, meatier inner. I wasn't as excited for the flavor of the flounder, which had an unexpected aftertaste, but I think that's more of a personal preference. For an upscale restaurant, the portions are generous, if not cheap. I was stuffed. But, when the dessert menu came, we couldn't resist. We ended up sharing an order of the Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding. It was excellent. Rich chocolatey flavor and gooey--the pudding middle was very decadent and encased by moist cake-like brioche, and the crust had a familiar bread pudding crunch. Make sure you save room for this!\nPrice: ~$50-70/person (Entrees just under $30)", "author": "Kate H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-21", "description": "Great restaurant, overall.\n \nThe atmosphere here is very classy, with servers in white tux tops walking around - - it makes you feel like you're dining in a fancy restaurant back in the 20's (or 30's? 40's? I dunno my eras).  Once I entered, I felt overwhelming regret for not having worn a bright red flapper dress w/ slinky little hat - and smoke out of a long pipe and let loose in the middle of the place.  At various points through the night, there is live jazz music, and altogether, the place just rocks.  Ambience-wise, BIX is awesome - - perfect for a business dinner, or a nice date.  The place is a bit too stuffy for what I would call an \"outing w/ friends\" - and it's a bit too pricey for something casual.\n \nAlthough this place is primarily a restaurant, I noticed on this evening @ 8 pm, the bar was full of people who were not waiting for tables but simply enjoying their Happy Hour.  It's not quite the spot I would have picked for a Happy Hour, but it was a good crowd - and the drinks were good.  That said, our party of our had arrived early in order to get drinks at the bar while we waited, because we saw through their website that there was a fancy long bar at which to wait.\n \nWhile our reservation was initially for 8:30 pm, the host came by at precisely 8 pm to inquire if we'd like to be seated now.  We took him up on it, and were led by the hostess to a \"booth\" -  very roomy, the lighting was beautiful - - again, transporting you to a different era.  Our party was for four people - - and it was an intimate, rather romantic setting.  This is the type of restaurant where it'd be fun to get two couples together, get fabulously dressed up and dine out before spending the rest of the evening painting the town red.  The seats themselves were perhaps a bit \"denny-esque\" but the whole setup just kind of works.  The ceilings are beautiful, and the setup with a whole slew of diners sitting upstairs with another bunch all seated downstairs - - it's absolutely classic and reminiscent of days long gone-by.... days before I even came into existence, but what I envision to be \"dining out\" back in the early 20th century.\n \nThe menu is very vast and based on just the hors d'oeuvres and starters - there were some 20 items to choose from.  We opted for the caprese w/ heirloom tomatoes and homemade mozzarella \"cart\" (which they actually serve to you from a cart), the crispy fried shrimp, crab cakes (which were actually crab filled mini-sandwiches),and tuna tartare served w/ toasted olive bread.  The latter was QUITE delicious, the others were all pretty good, except the fried shrimp was overfried in my opinion and not all that impressive.  There was NOTHING special about the caprese, though.  \n \nFor our entrees, one of us opted for the halibut, which I didn't try this evening.  The rest of us had the rack of lamb (which was OK), the pork chops (which was perhaps the best of the 3 dishes I tried), and the scallops, which were cooked nicely but I didn't think there was anything special about the dish, in spite of it being the evening's special.  Many of these choices were suggestions made by our server on what is best at BIX.... \n \nService was mixed.\nOur server was a friendly and jovial but often too busy, and too scattered.  What he lacked for in time or attention, he made up for in being polite and fun, though, so it breaks even.\n \nThe wine list was good.\nWe picked a Russian River Valley Pinot Noir on this evening (which has been my slight to moderate OBSESSION these days) - - decently priced at $60+, and it tasted wonderful.  Between the four of us, we finished 2 bottles of that, 4 scotch on the rocks, and one dessert Muscat which I did not like at all.  We also ordered a cheese plate (decent, at best), and 2 desserts.  One was a strawberry tart that tasted better than it looked, as it was presented looking like it was a  rock off of some unknown planet out there with a dollop of strawberry ice cream on top.  The other dessert was  the Bananas Foster w/ Rum and Vanilla Ice Cream, which was the hit of the evening as it was as decadent as anything I've ever tried.  Delicious.\n \nThe total bill was $440, not including the tip. (Including tip, it went over $500.)\nWhile rather pricey for four people, keep in mind there were two bottles of $60+ wine, and quite a bit of food.\n \nOn the food-front, contrary to what most of  the other reviewers have stated, I found BIX to be just \"good\".  Compared to some of the other establishments in San Francisco, in spite of who the chef is, what experiences he has, or which amazing restaurants he has been a part of, I found nothing altogether special about the food - and on the whole, I give it 3.5 stars for the food.  Good - just not special.  \n\nCombined w/ the unbeatable ambience - BIX earns 4 stars total nonetheless.  I just can't say it was all about the food.  There's better food out there in SF - - but not with this type of a historical feel.\n\nPhotos uploaded.", "author": "Grace K."}

I couldn't help but feel that way while I was having dinner at BIX.\r\n\r\nAll the food was below average - tuna tartare on olive toast (tuna was had a fishy after taste), kobe beef (more like okay beef) and the banana bread brioche dessert that looked like a hot fudge sundae from TGIFs - I wish it would have tasted that good.\r\n\r\nThe waiter was chill and made a below average meal seem pleasant.  The interior of the place is a little un-homey with the high ceilings and open space providing over exposure allowing everyone to see everyone.

Ummm, not really, no.  Not that it was a hyper out-of-control restaurant, but mellow is not the word I would have used.\n\nBix is a very chic restaurant in a small alley off the financial district in SF.  The street it's on is old time cobblestone and the lighting was perfect for a romantic walk down the dimly lit street...to bad I wasn't with my s.o., but a best friend will do just fine!\n\nWe walked in and the maitre-de greeted us, asked if we had reservations (oops, didn't know we needed them for a 'mellow' place), we answered no; he said they were full but we could eat a full meal at the bar; so the bar it was!\n\nWe bellied up to the bar, which was very neat and very fancy-schmancy & ordered our drinks & an appetizer.  I had a decent margarita on the rocks (no one I've met to date can make them as good as my mum) & Anna had a mandarin & 7.  She was pleased with her drink.\n\nWe decided on the provolone wrapped prociutto drizzled in olive oil...it was DELICIOUS!  We opted not to do dinner, we just really were feeling mellow, so we asked for our bill, paid & off we went to explore the city a little more.\n\nI would love to go back and have a proper meal here, preferably with someone who is romancing me, it's a very chic place and if the dinner is half as good as the apps are, everyone would be in for a treat!", "author": "Emily S."}

This was the upscale version of Cheers, as everyone seemed to know the names of the people that I had accompanied.  We were greeted by the excited hostesses and with the right # of bar stools cleared off for our party to sit on.  Every bar tender greeted my party by first name only which made me wonder if the bartenders are that good or that bored or maybe my party that I was with frequented that bar earlier that week and were that memorable?  I began to wonder.\n\nThe limited food that I had was AMAZING.  We had the crispy prawns in a chitpotle sauce and the tiniest of tiny lamb hamburgers on a almost brioche like bun.  These things were the size of my pointy finger touching my thumb.  The perfect 2 bite burgers, Whole Foods try to do that!

I can't believe why I haven't been in years.The place has not lost any of its special feel of exclusivity. A lot smaller than I recall though. \n\nI have to knock off a star or maybe half of one because they use the smallest martini glass I have ever seen and a couple of there signature cocktails were not that good. Other than that the meal was perfect. They make a perfect martini but avoid the Side Car (too much lemon juice) and the Ginger Gimlet (tasted like nasty Country Time lemonade with booze). The Bix Ricky is very good though. Vodka with fresh strawberry puree and sparkling water. Very refreshing. \n\nFood and service was as top notch as I remembered it. We had the Potato Pillow Caviar and the hor d' oevres for 2 (Shrimp, Tuna Tartar, and this great Fou Gras Butter & Jelly mini sandwhiches) along with the Bone Marrow appetizer. The tuna was the only thing to pass on.\n\nI am just a meat and potatoes kind of guy so I figured I will get the NY Strip w/Truffle fries, a glass of red wine, and be a happy camper. I am SO GLAD I didn't. On the way back I saw another couple who ordered the lobster spaghetti and it looked amazing. I usually stay away from pasta dishes that involve a cream sauce because they tend to be too rich for me. This dish while rich was not too much so. This pasta was so good I did not even care that it had lobster. And I LOVE LOBSTER!!! Do not miss this. \n\nI am not a desert guy, but I never turn down a Bananas Foster which too was excellent.\n\nAlso try to eat upstairs. It can get pretty crowded/loud at the bar and some people seem to spill over on the busier nights. Its also nice to look down at the whole lower level while your waiting between courses/drinks.

Needless to say, we all found this extremely rude and quite embarrassing for the hosts of this business dinner! I personally took the manager aside and let her know we found this extremely inappropriate for a restaurant that boast this caliber of fine dining. She made no apologies and truly believed she was in the right. I dont like leaving negative reviews but I would not return to this restaurant. In general, I found the waiter to be attentive.

I was a bit weary as our recommendation came from a friend of my boyfriend's, someone who indeed worked for the restaurant itself.  Of course he was going to build it up to be something special....he worked there....but he was NOT lying.\nFortunately we were lucky enough to have his familiarity and expertise guide us through the evening.  Our reserved table was the best of the house - a table on the 2nd floor balcony overlooking the piano bar (jazz lounge singer included) and entire restaurant. Our waiter brought us a tasting menu of sorts, providing littler versions of the most popular dishes.  We were blessed to experience this at this restaurant as it isn't something normally done! \n\nNot one dish failed to deliver.  It was pure enchantment as each plate practically melted in your mouth.  The most notable being the butternut squash soup with crab, lobster spaghetti with cream sauce (low calorie of course), and banana fosters with peanut butter ice cream dessert. Pure heaven on a plate.\n\nIt is no where near a cheap establishment, but for the quality of food, excellence of service, and overall atmosphere and experience, BIX is one place well worth saving up for!

The bar is swingin' (though ok,  mostly filled with the salt-and-pepper sportcoat set).  They have live jazz (appealing to fortysomethings and us young people alike).  You can canoodle in the upstairs booths (though ok, the lighting is kind of too bright up there and I have vague memories of grandma upholstery).   But most importantly, you can order a definitive steak tartare.\n\nDare I say that this is the best steak tartare I have ever had.  And that's a big deal - speaking in absolutes scares me, if only because I have a horrible memory and it's conceivable that I've had a better steak tartare somewhere, sometime... but it's this one that stands out as flawless.  Because they know how to season.   And that is an exceedingly rare skill.  Those guys at Perbacco (where, about a month ago, I begrudgingly ingested a pile of pink slop they called veal tartare) need to take a lesson from the tartare masterminds here.  \n\nWell.  After this resplendent mound of cool, perfectly accented meat, I basically couldn't be any happier.  OK, I was pretty happy with my hash.  And BF's burger was sublime.  And it didn't hurt that we washed everything down with a bottle of Caymus.  But the real icing on the proverbial cake was the caramel-oozing bananas foster, a fittingly retro end to our fabulously throwback evening.  It was perfect.", "author": "Melissa B."}

It at times can be pretentious, but mostly its just good food with good service, and good atmosphere. \n\nI enjoy that it is a 'dress' place, that you can be business casual in the daytime for lunch, but that it dresses up at night.

You walk into the place and  crave a Manhattan--this is the kind of place where you want a REAL cocktail. And they're excellent.\n\nThe host was real accomodating as our party grew from three, to four then ultimately five.

The restaurant has a cool, 1940'ish urban feel which we enjoyed. Keep in mind that this place is LOUD so having a conversation on a busy night during dinner may require talking in a raised voice. However I would not be deterred from eating here simply because of the noise level.\nAs far as the menu goes they have a wide variety of meat and fish dishes. We started out by having salmon toasts on little rye pieces, then shared a pickled veggie salad with homemade ranch dressing, then had the burger and flounder with grits, and finished off with some sorbets. Everything was really good, including the glass of Malbec that my husband ordered.\nWe really enjoy innovative, modern flavors and BIX really shines in that regard. I have noticed over the years that the best flavor combos always come in the appetizers and desserts as there is only so much you can do with a main course. The main courses we had were great, no complaints but the appetizers are what REALLY stood out, especially the salad which was divine. If you want a nice dinner in a fun atmosphere do visit BIX.", "author": "Nadia S."}

And it was so worth it. We were seated in the best spot in the house, upper floor, center booth, just for the two of us. Perfect view of the bar and very private because the booths are spaced far apart and no one is across from you.\n\nLive jazz pianist and singer started around 9:30. She had a really nice voice and it blended and drowned out some of the cackling heard from downstairs.\n\nI had a cocktail, the Ginger Gimlet, that I wasn't that impressed with. Next time I'll do wine or something else. \n\nThe food was delish. Oysters from Oregon and butternut squash soup to start. The sourdough rolls were warmed just right, too. \n\nMy entree was my first over $20 burger ($26 to be exact) that was center filled with truffle, so it was different but good. The fluffy rye half bun was good enough to eat by itself. I've had similar fries before but these seemed really good that night--maybe I just appreciated everything that came with the great setting.\n\nMy date had the special fish of the day with lentils that he ate every last bite of. He also ate most of the side of greenbeans with almonds that we ordered.\n\nI felt generous that night (actually I was too full), so I shared my ice cream sandwich dessert. Six mini sandwiches, three flavors. My favorite was the classic vanilla ice cream with semi-sweet crispy chocoloate chip cookies.\n\nWe left very satisfied and my only complaint would be the timing of the food.

The food was fun to order since there was a lot of variety.  I would recommend to start with a beef tartare (this was prepared table-side) and the mini lamb burgers are a must try.

So torn on what to rate this place, wish I could do 2 different reviews.  Let's start with the positive first...BTW, we were a group of 10 people. \n\nThe food was phenomenal. The croques were to die for and hands down the table's favorite. The halibut ceviche & steak tartare were fantastic as well. For entrees, everyone was really happy with their dishes. I had the truffle burger and it was heavenly (but couldnt finish it)...and so were the truffle fries. Others had the kobe beef and were also very impressed. \n\nNow on to the damper of the evening. My friend's mom had surprised us with 2 bottles of champagne for the table and the waiter never mentioned it when we sat down. Instead he proceeded to ask for cocktail orders to (in our opinion) rack up the bill.  When my friend, the birthday girl, asked the waiter for the champagne she knew her mother had bought us, he said he was going to save it for dessert. Super weird.  After the first bottle was poured, we each realized the bottle of Veuve-Clicquot was bad. Every single glass was totally flat. No bubble.  When my husband told the waiter, the waiter disagreed and only refilled my husband's glass and one other friend. He did not ask the rest of the table if anyone else was unhappy with their glass of champagne.  After a while, he started working the table, person by person taking more cocktail orders even though we had another bottle of Veuve!  Again, my friend had to ask him to bring the bottle out.  At the end of our meal, the waiter asked for dessert orders and my friend (who thank goodness her mom told her what she was going to send over to our table as a gift) asked the waiter why he would take dessert orders when her mother has also bought a huge cake from the restaurant for our table!!??!!!!   He apologized and brought out the cake.

Stepping through the heavy dark doors, one steps back in time to an era where cold champagne accompanies hot jazz in luxurious digs with delicious food.  My husband and I settled into a cozy booth for his birthday dinner and gazed out upon the lengthy mirror backed bar under a beautiful mural.  Beside us an elderly man played jazz on a grand piano.  The white tuxedoed waiters were attentive, informative and ready to give suggestions on what we must try.  My husband had the ceviche appetizer which may have been my favorite item we tried with its lime sauce, avocado and bit of crunchy nuts atop it.  He followed this with the Kobe steak which he said met all his wildest dreams.  I somehow managed to order an entire meal that I could eat with my hands starting with \"truffled cheese croques\" which amounts to the tastiest mini grilled cheese sandwiches I have ever had, and that I followed with mini lamb burgers and truffled french fries.  Oh...and somewhere in there I had a ginger gimlet which was a delight, though not as gingery as I had hoped.  Still, all were a delight!  We wrapped up the meal with the banana foster which was both decadent and the perfect blend of hot and cold.  mmmm...good.

Served in smallish martini glasses, dusted with sugar and made with Germain Robin brandy, it was the perfect apertif to start the evening.\n\nFor me, much of the draw of Bix (and a reason I would definitely go back) is its old-world charm. A piano and torch singer providing background ambience and white-coated waiters providing impeccable service only adds to the charm of what would otherwise be considered a flash from the past.\n\nFor Jerry's birthday, we ordered a bottle of '95 A.R. Lenoble Grand Cru Brut to accompany half-a-dozen oysters and warm, crunchy gougres. This segued nicely into a round of hors d'oeuvres that we all shared; potato pillows with crme frache and American sturgeon caviar, Kampachi crudo with blood orange, fennel, daikon, and Fiordolio olive oil, and a torchon of foie gras with French brandied cherries. Hard-pressed to pick a favorite of the three with the potato pillows most definitely billowy and light, the crudo fresh and flavorful, and the foie gras silky and elegant.\n\nJerry and Kevin opted for full entres and I for another, smaller dish served with an '01 Gevry-Chambertin Premiere Cru Lavaux Saint Jacques Esmonin. Jerry chose the fish selection of the day, Diver scallops with favas, fennel, fresh parsley oil, and a variety of other flavors... Kevin ordered the rack of lamb which we are having as a left-over breakfast this morning, served with Lentils du Puy and minted carrots, they were tender enough to be eaten like lollipops -- picked up and bitten freely at will with easy tenderness.\n\nMy weekness and third course? Tableside-prepared steak tartare. I love tableside service and watching our lovely waiter, Douglas, deftly hand cut and blend the Creekstone Angus beef with dijon mustard, capers, shallots, and quail egg was truly amazing.\n\nA note on service -- the first bottle of Gevry-Chambertin was not entirely corked but a tad off. I expressed my concern that there was a bit too much barnyard funk and there was nary a fuss on bringing a second bottle. Both Douglas, the waiter, and the sommelier, another Kevin, agreed there was some bottle variation and enjoyed tasting along with us to compare.\n\nFor Jerry's birthday, he chose the Meyer lemon pana cotta with huckleberries and a glass of Armagnac. I was concerned that the lemon and huckleberry might be too sweet, but there was more an essence of candied lemon rind with darker, pronounced lemon flavors. Kevin and I shared a cheese plate; he with a 1970 Graham port and I with a '96 Rieussac. I mentioned to Douglas my waffling on wanting a bite of chocolate and our cheese plate had a small dish of Vahlrona sauce and a few chocolate tablets, just to appease my craving.

But Bix has a number of delicious veggie-friendly appetizers, and the waiter was excited to tell me about their veggie entree plate, which was actually a totally yummy and filling version of one of their fish dishes.  I felt that the food I ate was just as gourmet as the fancy meat everyone else ate.\n\nWe drank about three bottles of wine and we all had at least one cocktail.  The drinks were great- try the Gimlet, it's sooo refreshing.  And the dessert was WORTH IT- we shared the bananas foster, the chocloate souffle, and the apple tart (that one wasn't quite as good).

He was totally stoked and most likely spent well that night after downing some purple drank we commonly call the 'tussin.\n\n\nBack to the dinner.... the interior is really nice, like a 40's jazz club complete with old guy on piano. It's a split level place so you can eat on the second floor and feel superior to the peons on the lower level. The place frowns on spitting from the second floor, be advised. The wine selection was great and the food was prepared well. The desserts were also a great surprise. Chocolate bread pudding was a win win.", "author": "Erik U."}

The entrance is tucked away on Gold street and was so unassuming and simple from the outside that once we went in we were shocked at the atmosphere.  Awesome little speakeasy feel to it.  Dimly lit, soft piano playing, a lively mahogany bar and cozy, candle lit tables.  The place was pretty busy, but since most patrons made reservations (I requested a private booth so my date and I could make out, but no such luck!)  there were no lengthy wait times or difficulty getting a drink at the bar.  \n\nThe drink selection is great - red, white and sparkling wines available by the glass or bottle, several signature cocktails, (try the ginger gimlet made with Hangar One) and even a great after dinner drink menu.\nThe food was absolutely amazing.  We started with the Steak Tartare and it was incredible.  She had the duck, I had the filet and they were both freakin heaven in my pie hole.  Our sides were also great - I had some mashed taters and she had some wacky little rice mixed with mushrooms of which I ended up eating the majority.  We finished with a complimentary sorbet for two and a marc after dinner drink.  \n\nThe service was even better than the food - if that is even possible.  We were greeted immediately once we entered and offered a table right away, (despite being 45 minutes early for our reservation.)  We opted to wait and start with a drink at the bar while we relaxed a bit and listened to the piano.  Once we were seated, our waiter took the time to explain the menu and answered a few of our questions.  After the meal, unsolicited, he delivered our complimentary dessert for my date, complete with a candle for her burfday.  So I jumped up on the piano and serenaded her with my jazz flute as she definitely deserved...  Our waiter didn't want the surrounding tables to feel left out so he even delivered them complimentary desserts...  Quite a gesture!  We chatted it up with them and they, too, were having just as awesome experience as we were.  \n\nNeedless to say, we had an incredible time.  Everything was perfect and made for a memorable experience.  We will definitely go back.  If you haven't been, I would STRONGLY encourage you to go check it out.  You will not be disappointed!", "author": "Sean O."}

An elegant restaurant with an \"old-style jazz club\" feel to it that, surprisingly, was not stuffy at all. \n\n4 out of the 5 dishes we ordered were excellent, and that's amazing considering how picky I am. It was only the Alaskan halibut that was a little dry, but the side of corn, bell peppers, and cherry tomatoes surely made up for it. \n\nFor my appetizer, I ordered the heirloom tomatoes with mozzarella cheese - which is a seasonal signature dish of Bix's - and it totally lived up to the hype! Ok, so you get like 3 slices of tomato for $14 but they may be the sweetest, juiciest tomatoes you will ever try. \n\nOverall, great food, great atmosphere, fairly easy parking, and great service.

Classic, old school feeling restaurant with an awesome bar and cocktails. \nService was great and the ambience was as well. Fridays and Saturdays they have a live Jazz band that rounds out the experience. \nSome have noted that it was a little expensive, and it is. That should be expected when you go here. It's not a hole in the wall joint (although I do love a hole in the wall). This is a nice, upscale restaurant and in my opinion they hit all the points of such (service, decor, ambience, food, drinks etc). \nStarted with martini's and manhattan's, both of which were fabulous. The potato pillows were a good, light, starter and rather unique. \nFor the entrees, we had the Lobster spaghetti and the Veal chop. \nThe lobster spaghetti was good, and there was plenty of lobster, but it was a bit dry for me. I like a little more sauce, or maybe just a bit more olive oil. Nevertheless, it was good. That would be the only 4 star portion of the night. \nThe veal chop, on the other hand, needs more than 5 stars. This was amazing. A great piece of meat, cooked perfectly, and topped with some type of lightly creamy sauce. I don't remember what the sauce was, but I'll be back for it. The waiter also recommended a perfect wine to pair with it. It was a bourgogne of some sort. \n\nOne of the better dinners I've had in a while.", "author": "T M."}

Later the bartender brought us a sample of their home made motzerella.  My girlfriend selfishly snatched both hers and my piece so we later ordered it as one of our appetizers.  So on to dinner...\n\nAppetizers:\nHomemade Motzerella - So good my girlfriend initially stole mine..grrrr!  The motzerella melted in your mouth while the prosciutto added a nice salty flavor.  \n\nCeviche - I always like ceviche but the corn nuts were delicious.  it gave the fish some good texture.  Jalepenos added good heat as well.\n\nFries - Fries are fries....good but meh\n\nMain Course \n\nScallops (my girlfriend) - Cooked just right but i don't think this is on the menu anymore.\n\nLobster Spaghetti (Em and Me)- Very delicious!

In reality, it was classic 30's (20's?) decor with a large bar and seating along the perimeter upstairs. I was really blown away by the atmosphere -- when we arrived, we decided to pretend we were there to plan a heist. Not a bank heist either -- a jewel heist because it's a classy joint.\n\nUnfortunately, the food and the service didn't live up to our initial impressions. Our waitress was a cold fish. Not mean or anything, but she just didn't exhibit much personality even when greeting us. And given the prices and the size of the tip she'd receive, that's just not acceptible. It's fine to say \"They're both good\" when we ask which dessert she'd recommend, but perhaps she could've expanded on that a bit.\n\nThe food was good -- very good, actually. I had the chicken hash, which is basically chicken salad with some corn fried up like a crab cake. I was particularly happy because I'm allergic to crab so this was my opportunity to partake in an entree similar to one that I'm forbidden to ever eat.\n\nEveryone liked their entree, but nobody liked their dessert. We actually all got the same thing -- the chocolate bread pudding. The description sounded really great, and after having excellent bread pudding experiences at Home on Market and Palomino, I had high expectations for BIX. But what we got was a mediocre pudding with an odd texture and a massive dollop of whipped cream where ice cream would have been more appropriate. The chocolate was actually very good -- a nice dark cocoa. But the dessert was a major disappointment.\n\nBad dessert + cranky waitress + high prices = 3 stars.

Suddenly, I'm finding myself craving the $$$, far-away locales than the regular places I've been frequenting around my area.\n\nI came across BIX on Yelp and was really interested in trying the marrow bones and other items on their menu. Many of the reviews spoke positively about this long-standing restaurant in a \"hidden alley\" which greatly intrigued me. So, today was the day that my hubs promised and off we went. For some strange reason, we came across bad luck with traffic leaving our area and again just before exiting.. so we arrived about 15-20 minutes late for our rezzies. Upon entering, they took our coats and were still able to accommodate us with an open table.\n\nAt our table, a cute little card said \"Happy Anniversary\" and within a few moments our server, Doug, was there to start us off with some drinks. We ordered a heineken for the husband (I know) and a BIX Ricky. A few moments later, the complimentary bread came out which satiated our empty stomachs for the time being.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\n- TRUFFLED FRENCH FRIES $8.95: These are always good anywhere I order them. They came with two sauces: ketchup and one other sauce I can't pinpoint. I really wish we ordered another one of these. They are to die for!\n- STEAK TARTARE $13.95: It was our first time ordering this so it was an interesting experience and taste. The raw steak was prepared tableside and was eaten with toasted bread. I can't say that I liked or disliked this dish.. it requires a more sophisticated palate to be able to discern its quality.. my palate is not at that level just yet. Although it was interesting to try, the flavors in this dish would not warrant my ordering it the next time I am here.\n- MARROW BONES $11.75: This is a first for us as well, at least in ordering it at a fancy restaurant. I didn't really know what to expect but when it arrived it peaked my interests. I scooped out the marrow and put it on the bread and topped it off with some of the parsley/shallot salad. This, too, requires a more sophisticated person to judge it.. as trying it for the first time I can't say whether it was good or not. What I do know is that I would pass on it the next time around.\n- KOBE BAVETTE ENTREE $34.95: My husband ordered this dish and was very satisfied with it. The kobe beef bavettes were flavorful and juicy, cooked to perfection at medium rare. The pommes puree it came with was good. I ate one of the roasted cipollini onions which was good with a slightly sweet taste. He was very happy with this dish and I agreed it was well cooked and flavored. \n- AHI TUNA WITH BLACK MUSSELS ENTREE $29.95: At this point in the meal, I was full. I had a glass of chardonnay waiting to accompany this dish and I could only enjoy both slowly before I would burst. The ahi tuna was tender and perfectly seared on the outside. The black mussels were a great accompaniment to the ahi tuna as well as the green olives and toasted bread pieces in the dish. I also enjoyed the butter beans and the syrah sauce of the dish. I ate it all even though I was full. It was packed with little goodies but nothing that was too filling to prevent me from finishing it. I would order this again.\n- 1 2007 SILVERADO CHARDONNAY $10.00: Good pour on the BIX chardonnay.

Classy.\n- BANANAS FOSTER $8.75: Cold vanilla bean ice cream with warm dark rum syrup and bananas poured on top. Perfect end to our dinner. Very sweet, but delightful. A must share! Thank you BIX for treating us to this on the house :) Very generous and unexpected!\n\nTOTAL: $200 including tip.\n\nPricey but worth the experience and trip.

I went with some friends who were throwing down corporate cards, so we got to do it up.  \nAtmosphere...very nice.  The staff was pleasant, the Art Deco vibe is fun, and we spent half the meal trying to figure out if two booths over was Gavin Newsome or not (it wasn't, but it did look alot like him).  \nFood...eh.  I mean nothing was bad per se, but I really just wasn't too impressed.  The crab roll apps-sorta bland.  Somehow they managed to take all the crab flavor out of the crab.  The wine list was good & we had a nice bottle of Hess.  My halibut was fine, but forgettable.  \n\nSo all in all I had a lot of fun, but I'd take the advice of where many of the reviews for Bix go on this one...come for a drink or two and enjoy a swanky bar experience.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-01-04", "description": "If your idea of a great dinner is spending way too much on below-average to average quality food and waiting 25-30 minutes between courses, then this place is for you. I was pleased and had high expectations when we walked in, geared up for a fancy dinner in a place with reasonably good atmosphere. But the experience didn't live up to that, nearly. While this place could probably be a 2 in my book, I am going with the oh-so-harsh rating of 1 for the following reasons:\n\n1- simply put, when you pay this much for food it should be really good. Or at least good. This wasn't- below quality meat (according to my meat-eating friends) and poorly executed seafood. That's really 'nuff said but I'll continue...\n\n2-despite having a reservation, we had to wait 20-25 minutes past that reservation time for our table, something I'd be willing to overlook due to being busy if the rest of the experience had gone well and/or if the host had been friendly about it and not look totally annoyed with me the two times I checked in with him.\n\n3-Although our waitress was friendly, she pretty much ignored us. We had to wait a good 10-15 minutes before she even came over, then another 10 to order appetizers, 15 to order dinner and so on.... it took 25-30 minutes before our apps came out, and they were only ok. \n\n4-I RARELY get scallops or any other type of seafood since I'm picky about the types I like and what I actually eat. But I figured this was an expensive place with nice atmosphere, it's supposed to be fancy, so they should do things right, right? Wrong. The scallops were undercooked to the point where they could have been described as raw and wriggling. I tried half of 2 of the four on my plate and forced myself to take a couple more bites (since I have never sent anything back in my life) before I wanted to vomit and resigned to (after an hour and a half of being starved past the point of a crazy skinny model) eating only the butternut squash puree that the dish came with (actually quite good). When one of my friends sent back her $27 burger because it tasted nothing better than something from McDonald's (she explained politely but dissapointedly to the waitress that this was simply not high quality meat and did not taste good), I also returned my scallops and turned down the offer of replacement food. My friend got her burger taken off the bill, but I did not - either I didn't complain enough or they figured they were throwing us a bone by replacing the price of one out of two. Too bad I still wanted to vomit.\n\nTo their credit, the waitress did bring out a complimentary dessert, because she said she didn't want us to leave with a \"bad taste in our mouths\" (TOO LATE!) - unfortunately, the dessert wasn't very good either. \n\nAgain, 1 star is admittedly harsh but given the price for quality and the extremely painfully slow service, I would NOT recommend coming here for dinner.", "author": "Kristen L."}

The last time I came here was about 5 years ago. This time, I got a table downstairs instead of the ultra chic tables upstairs where you can watch all of the activity below. We ordered the bone marrow appetizer and it was as tasty as I remembered but several of the bones were filled with way more fat than I remembered last time. We ended up ditching 2 of the bones instead of eating the fatty stuff inside. As for the main course, we ordered the pork chop special and the chicken hash. The pork chop was very flavorful but I was impressed with the chicken hash. I would definitely order the hash again. It was the cheapest main course but I thought it was more delicious than the pork chop which was a bit salty for my taste. Unfortunately, we did not have room for dessert, although the dessert items were so enticing. On food, it gets 4 stars. On ambiance, it also gets 4 stars, but only because I was at a small two-person table scrunched in the corner because the middle tables were put together for a large party. I would definitely recommend eating here and definitely request an upstairs table. I am still a big fan although I don't come here that often as it's a bit spendy.", "author": "Joe K."}

We were immediately taken to our table and seated.  Our waiter was extremely attentive and gave us very personal service.  \n\nTo start I ordered the Pacific Oysters, which were terrific.  I also tried a bite or two of the Steak Tartare (prepared tableside!) which was similarly phenomenal.  \n\nThe waiter gave me a martini on the house as well as a free appetizer for our table to help us celebrate.  The martini was pretty damn good.  My ONLY criticism is that is was shaken, and not stirred as ordered, but  that's not so much of a big deal...especially when it's a free martini...\n\nI ordered the Kobe steak Bavette for my main course, as rare as possible.  It was nothing short of amazing.  The edges were perfectly crispy and flavorful, the center of the meat melt-in-your-mouth soft. It was cheaper than the special (NY Steak, $49) and better too.  The mashed potatoes were nothing special, but that's alright: it was ALL about the beef!\n\nAfter dinner the waiter brought over the warm chocolate brioche pudding, which was heavenly, and we ordered the Bananas Foster and the El Rey Chocolate and Butterscotch Brownies.  I am typically NOT a banana person, but I came close to licking the plate when we finished the Bananas Foster.  The chocolate brownies were pretty typical, but the butterscotch ones blew my mind!\n\nOverall, it was an amazing evening.  We never felt rushed, the service and the food were both outstanding.

The atmosphere is so comfortable (and comforting), the service is smooth and professional, the food is delectable and they always pour a great cocktail.  \r\n\r\nPlus, you have to love the late night dining.

Late at night, it usually isn't a problem.  Of the many times I have done that they have only denied me once. \r\n\r\nOnce you get to Bix, even if you have to wait at the bar for a bit until your table is ready, all the hassles of the earlier evening seem to melt away.  Your hunger is no longer making you irritated and frazzled, it has become a slight tease that is adding to the anticipation of your meal.  \r\n\r\nI would love Bix even if every time I ate there it was 8pm and I had held reservations days in advance, but I adore Bix because it has so often been the turning point - take a hectic or otherwise imperfect evening, have a late dinner at Bix and then go on to have a fabulous night!", "author": "lisa g."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-04-16", "description": "Gravely Disappointed! My husband chose Bix for my birthday dinner since he read good reviews about it. I was happy to see a beautiful, classy designed place as we entered . We got a cozy corner booth. Started with margarita for drinks, best one that I've ever tasted. We had oysters for appetizer, another good choice. Since we don't have huge appetites, we ordered straight for the main course. My husband had Breast Duck. Verdict: Nothing special. I had Roasted Fish of the day, which was halibut. The waiter explained that it's roasted, (obviously) and with some ravioli. I was imagining it to be very tasty since I love roasted fish. When my food came, it was roasted indeed swimming in a half bowl of soup with the ravioli nestled below. Verdict: Bland like hospital food. I swear I can cook a soup fish, which I'm not fond of anyway, if needed , so much better than they do. Why they had to immerse it in a soup, I've no idea. It costs us $30 per dish, plus drinks and oysters, total $136. We were not actually concerned about the price since it's stated in the menu and we were aware of it, except for the horrible fish. And hey, it's my birthday. I would still be disgusted  though spending that much for something that I didn't enjoy eating. I ate it because we didn't want to make a fuss out of it so as not to ruin our night. I did tell the waiter that I was disappointed. He took the dessert off our check.  Appreciate the gesture, but our evening was  totally ruined.  I guess the only safe dish to order there is their pasta, chicken and hamburger. If you are not sure of what to order or  how a dish is prepared, don't hesitate to ask the waiter. As for the ambience, it's like a market place. Something's wrong with the acoustic of the place. If you're looking for a quiet or less noisy place to dine, Bix is not for you. The jazz pianist was good. We felt bad for him and the singer,  because nobody paid attention to them. Or maybe they're just there as a background music. They might as well have a pipe in music if nobody cares about live music. Verdict: we are never going back!", "author": "Eve J."}

We needed a spot for a Sunday evening and I wanted some live music and this place hit all the right notes.  We had reservations and, per the prior reviews, I asked to be seated upstairs, which we were, after a brief wait at the bar (enjoyed the gimlet!!)  Tables upstairs are arranged along a u-shaped balcony offering a view into the open dining room/bar area below.  (I was glad to have been seated upstairs, but, actually, there's nothing wrong with the main floor dining area.) This night, the music was provided by a single, very accomplished piano player who played lovely old jazz standards.  I understand the music on Friday and Saturday nights is much more lively, but we were very happy with a more relaxed ambience that evening.  We shared the heirloom tomato plate--a dish I would return for alone (plenty for 2, though I could have eaten it all up myself since it was so delicious).  If you are a tomato lover, these are heavenly; I assume it's a seasonal dish but I highly recommend it if it's on the menu.  I had the sea bass (beautifully prepared and presented) and my husband had another fish [can't recall name :(] which he also enjoyed.

I love that whole part of town, and especially the little alley that BIX is on, which gives it a bit of a secret feel. Martini at the bar was good but not as good as the one I had two weeks ago at the Presidio Social Club. \n\nWe started dinner with steak tartare and I have to agree that it's the best I've had... Now, I haven't had much tartare but it was mighty tasty, and they do a nice little presentation right at the table. Fried oysters on the other hand were not really hot, nor anywhere near as luscious as those at (again) Presidio Social Club, the only other place I've had fried oysters recently. \n\nThe cheeseburger was GREAT - sort of a fancy patty melt, open face with a big slice of grilled onion on top and thick rye bread underneath. I think the burger was stuffed with mushrooms? Hot stuff. Side of ceviche was also very good, and a very nice bright, fresh contrast to the meat, juicy burger. Dessert was a sort of chocolate thing that was tasty, but the best part was what G. did to it with her tongue. That I will remember for quite a while. We had an '02 Burgundy (french Pinot, right?) which was really good and a good match for the meal. \n\nClassy joint, and an SF classic, no doubt, but I do wish that martini had been a bit better.

Since he planned it, I had no expectations and therefore I was spared the let-downs that some other reviewers experienced. \n\nFirst, the entrance is tucked away in a forgotten alley so just walking in you feel like you're one of the privileged few that knows about this place. Second, the live music sets the tone--you're here to be entertained and taken care of. Third, the food is really good.\n\nFor starters we had the Little Gems salad and the Truffle Cheese Croques and both were delicious. For our entrees we stuck with what they're famous for--he had the Bix Burger and I had the Chicken Hash. The burger was definitely the best I've ever had, and husband said it was top three for him. The chicken has was unexpected but really good too. We were too full for dessert but nothing on the dessert menu struck my fancy anyhow.\n\nIn reading the other reviews the two main negatives are price and service. For me, the food was worth the price but then again, the husband footed the bill and we chose the lesser priced entrees. Though we didn't have any service issues of note we did notice that our waitress seemed to want to keep our interactions as brief as possible. The manager came by and said \"hello\", but it was kind of odd that he did that without inquiring as to how everything was, how was the food, etc. \n\nAll in all, the music and the food were worth a tenuous 5 stars.

He brought us a tea cocktail to try and a taster of the two types of wine grape juice (unfermented wine grapes bottled by the vintner). My mom opted for the red. I ordered two cocktails. Both were perfect! Our waiter was attentive and had great menu advice. We started with the heirloom tomato plate as an appetizer. My Mom ordered the steak. She was worried the peppers with the dish would be spicy but the waiter assured her they were a special kind with 'zero-heat' and he was right! The steak was delicious and the peppers added wonderful flavor.  I decided to try the dorado. It was cooked to perfection and the accompanying salad added just the right citrus tang.

When they mentioned this, I asked if they had informed the restaurant that we were only planning on having drinks and appetizers.  They called BIX and stressed that we did not intend to have dinner and that we were dressed rather casual (jeans and sweaters), they were told that would be no problem as they were \"not very busy\" on this Monday night.\nFive of us arrived together (my partner was coming from work) we informed the host that the rest of our party would be arriving a little bit later.  We were seated and ordered drinks while we waited for the rest of our party ( he arrived about 30 mins later because the cab driver did not know the restaurant was in an Alley).  It took them 20 mins to bring 3 Apple Martini's and one Scotch on the rocks.  \nAfter about 30 mins I got up from the table to go outside to call my partner ( I think it is rude to make cell phone calls inside ANY restaurant)- on my way out I ran into my partner being belittled by the host because he did not remember the last name of the person the reservation was listed under (because he had never met them before).  The host implied that he did not believe that he was in fact meeting anyone and that their clothing did not meet the restaurants \"standards\".  I was suprised to see my partner and more surprised by the attitude of the host.\nWe went back to the table and everyone continued to order appetizers and drinks, every twenty minutes the waiter asked if  we were ready to order our \"meal\"-each time we reminded him that we were not having a full meal, we were just having drinks and appetizers- I should mention that the place was dead, there was only two more tables of customers in the whole joint.\nSo after that it was truly painful trying to get the waiters attention- before you feel sorry for the waiter I should let you know that our bill was $365 dollars just on small plates and drinks!  When the check came they had included an 18.5% gratuity - I mentioned to the waiter that it was a shame that he didn't trust us, and that he undervalued his own service, because I realized we were a slighty difficult table due to the fact that we did not order dinner I was going to tip him %25 and his reply was \"you still can\".

Below is my prior review.  \n\nAnother great meal at Bix.  I've been going here for years and the food is consistently great.  I took 2 friends from NY and they were very impressed with the space.  We started with the firecracker shrimp with chili aioli.  The shrimp were huge and the sauce was really tasty.  The blue cheese dressing on the hearts of romaine was a little bland.  The chicken hash yet again was great.  I always try to save room to use that great bread they give you to mop up the yummy sauce.  We tried 2 deserts and both were awesome - the bananas foster was great...didn't want to share.  The ice cream was rich and creamy and the sauce was fantastic.  The warm chocolate brioche was really rich.  It is definitely something to share as I can't imagine taking more than a couple of bites since it's so rich.  \n\nOn the downside, we didn't get great service this time.  It took forever to get out first drinks, water and to put an order for apps in.  At least 30 minutes.  It was very unusual for Bix.

Been around a long time too and longevity says something in a town when restaurants come and go so fast!\n\nit was a birthday meal for my sweetie and he had never heard of BIX before.  I used to work for Real Restaurants so I always wanted to try AND I would've gotten a nice discount if I had eaten there a few years before.\n\nThe BAR!  Is astounding.  I only drank some nice Tuscan wine but i was drooling over the amber colors from afar and the choices.\n\nHad Crab puffs which were delightful and fresh.\nHad the Butternut Squash soup with pumpkin seed oil.  Yum for the oil!\nHad Salad with Romaine and Pt. Reyes blue cheese dressing.  So good and tasty!\n\nthey gave us potato beggars purses (what I call them)  Tater tots with creme fraiche and caviar (american)  These were a little greasy but it was a freebie.  so I enjoyed it.\n\nFor Main courses, ate the Pork chop! Yummmm!  with fingerlings and fig compote.\nChicken Hash was only so so.  I think it is one of their signature dishes but really didn't do much though I would definitely say the creamy sauce (almost like stroganoff sauce) and the beautiful tiny tomatoes made up for the medocre-ness of the chicken hash.  I was so full anyway but that time that I was satiated,\n\nBut....  I made some room for the bananas foster.  OMG!  that was so good.  Goodness abounded.

So, if those other hundreds of other reviews didn't convince you, I hope that mine will! My wife and I are always willing to explore and try new places, and finally, we were so pleased to actually find a restaurant where we enjoyed the atmosphere, food, and every single aspect of the meal.\n\nWe started with the appetizers... and couldn't decide on which to try, since many looked so good. So, why deprive ourselves?? We chose the mini lamb burgers, firecracker shrimp, and the potato pillows. Each and every one was AMAZING! Not greasy or overly filling at all. I thought that my wife might actually take me down over the last lamb burger!\n\nNext, I had the clam and corn chowder, and she the ceviche. Both were absolutely delicious. My wife, a true expert in the ways of ceviche, was impressed with the flavor. I loved the soup, but when my wife tried it, again, I thought my life would be in danger... she LOVED it. REAL clams (not clam pieces), and such a robust, non-fishy flavor. A definite must!\n\nFor entree's, my wife had the halibut, and I the special of the day, the sturgeon (not sure of spelling). Both were wonderful, not too \"fishy\", and decent sized portion. I had ordered a side of the truffle fries... DEFINITELY get those- so flavorful!!!\n\nWe topped off the meal with the bananas foster - quite decadent! Oh, and by the way, the alcohol beverages were delicious as well. My wife had a Mojito, and I a chocolate Martini... yum yum.\n\nSo, as you can see, we went to town! The service was really great. In fact, our waitress was a bit concerned that perhaps we wouldn't be able to eat all that we orderd... boy, did we prove her wrong! The ultimate statement regarding this meal is that my wife did not leave ONE thing behind on her plate... she ate EVERYTHING, which is very rare.\n\nAlso, even though it is on the pricier side, with all the food and drink that we ordered, it came to roughly 100 per person. Granter, high end, but we definitely feel that we got what we paid for!\n\nI would have to say that the only negative about Bix is that it is not located on the East Bay! Not to worry - we will be back!", "author": "Michael W."}

Yet, never have I been to a restaurant that hit the mark with all three.  Bix nailed it!  \n\nThe decor and atmosphere is wonderful...felt as if I had stepped back in time ..oh, about 60 years.  Now, it isn't a quiet place (and that is before the music starts) but it is romantic, especially, after the music starts.  The key is to be seated upstairs.  Completely changes the dynamic of the experience.  \n\nOur server (Kristen) was pitch perfect.  She was engaging, fun, and helpful throughout the evening.  She really did a wonderful job guiding us through the menu.  Every recommendation she provided was spot on.  \n\nNow for the food...... \n\nOur party of three nibbled our way through plenty of dishes over three hours...and even though we were full by the end, we really didn't want to stop eating.  \n\nStarters:  Steak Tartare & Ceviche - The first dishes out...and they completely set the tone for the evening.  I am still talking about the ceviche this morning...it was that flavorful.\n\nFirst Courses:  Grilled marrow bones, two-way prepared shrimp, fresh provolone & proscuitto, grilled asparagus and fried oysters (see fired comment below), and another dish involving foie gras that was silken and unbelivable. \n\nMain Courses:  Halibut and butter beans,  Grilled lamb, and the Lobster Spaghetti.  All three were prepared to perfection, with flavors that were exquisite and sublime.  \n\nDesert: Bread pudding:  I would have died very happy at that point! \n\nBy the way, we had some french fries tossed in to sample....um, I cannot, nor will I, ever eat another french fry again (unless it is from Bix).  I have never tasted something deep fried, that didn't taste deep fried. \n\nAll in all,  the single best dining experience I have ever had, in which every plate was distinct from the others.  Not one dish crossed over in flavor or presentation......it was F&^@%(@#) amazing!  \n\nOh yeah...the ginger gimlets go down way too easy!", "author": "Larry C."}

Walking down the alley, you feel like you're walking into a Humphrey Bogart movie, a feeling that continues when you step inside and see the staff in their white dinner jackets.  \r\n\r\nThere's definitely a 30's supper club feel, with awesome bartenders who make outstanding martinis (best in the city). We go here when we want to celebrate something special.\r\n\r\nService is always attentive, yet not overbearing.  The server seems to magically appear when I want something.\r\n\r\nMy recommendations:  the caviar topped potato pillows and the \"marrow bones\" (don't knock 'em til you try em).  Both of these appetizers haunt my dreams.  Also the butternut squash soup was delicious.\r\n\r\nI usually have fish, but by then we've gone through a bottle of champagne, so I can't remember what kind I usually have, just that it's white and always good.\r\n\r\nI always have the same dessert, but again, the martini and champagne fog prevents me from recalling the name.

I went here on someone else's recommendation --- the decor is very swanky for sure, with an intriguing portrait of a typical gentleman about town from the roaring twenties, wood highlights all around on the walls and staircase, and nice lampshades.\r\n\r\nHowever, service was so-so: while our server disappeared after first handing us our menus, and we had to flag down someone to ask to be served, and bread arrived fifteen to twenty minutes after we got there, the waiter that we accosted stayed with us and was very friendly.\r\n\r\nThe food was reasonable, but I've eaten better for less. We ordered the Kobe, which was ordered medium but arrived more well-done, but was still fairly juicy. The pommes puree it came with was the best part of the meal. The salmon my date ordered was quite plump and delicately flavored, but the taste profile stayed oily and citric, with little hint of any herb or vegetables that it was cooked with.\r\n\r\nOn the wine front: The special, a Priorat, had a fair amount of depth, with dark fruits and spice, but again, for $13 a glass, a bit much. I asked for something more robust to go with my beef --- the Rodney Strong Zinfandel I got was spicy and big, but not a great recommendation.

The burgers were fantastic; they came with a slice of cucumber that was a nice balance to the lamb.  The steak tartare was prepared table-side and was quite amusing to watch.  After the waiter finished mixing the ingredients of the dish he misted the dish with cognac...  and then he sprayed the air above the table with it.  Awesome.  The ahi tartare was boring but still a good cut of fish.\n\nThree of the four of us ordered the American style kobe beef with pureed potatoes, while the loaner went for the pork chop.  The beef had fantastic flavor, but the cut was a little chewy.  The outside of the meat was absolutely divine; really rich flavors.  Based solely on this dish, one of the meat crew declared their beef within the top 3 of her list.  I sampled the pork and it was moist and well balanced with the apple chutney.

We arrived after the Giants game, had made reservations, and were sitting after dinner catching up.  The food was excellent and the service superb and the setting very unique.  We lost track of time, had no idea folks were waiting and frankly were just oblivious until the General Manager, Blake Tippett arrived at our table (it wasn't until later that we found out who he was). At first we thought he was just inquiring about our evening but then he abruptly told us folks were waiting, we had been sitting long enough and he waited as long as he could before coming over. I jumped up along with my friends, apologized and headed down the stairs.  He immediately called a busboy over to prep our table for other guests. I was embarrassed and we all felt it could have been handled much better. We asked for a business card of the GM and did not realize until we were outside it was a generic business card for the restaurant so back in we went and asked again for the business card of the owner/GM.  We then found out that the gentleman that came to our table was the GM and at this point he handed us his card. We explained how we felt and instead of following the cardinal rule of customer service he blew us off and intimated it was our problem and he had waited as long as he could before coming to our table. My friend tried to suggest a better way of handling a situation like this in the future but he could have cared less which is what truly infuriated me. We also frankly questioned if we were three men how it would have been handled. Perhaps BIX has such a following that angering three well educated female executives doesn't matter.

I practically went crazy trying to think of something special to plan for his big day. \n\nAfter much yelping, I found BIX and promptly booked a reservation for 9pm on a Saturday night.  A few days before the evening, I called to pre-order desert for our night. The person who answered the phone was so astoundingly rude, she left me speechless. I actually considered canceling our reservation because of her demeanor, but the menu looked so good that I decided to risk it. \n\nI'm glad we did risk it because the night turned out to be lovely. We ordered a bunch of hor'dourves so that we could try more things on the menu. The foi gras and the lamb burgers were the most delicious and memorable. I was slightly disappointed by the minuscule size of potato pillows and I didn't expect them to be deep fried. However everything was very tasty and indulgent (in a good way).\n\nA few more notes:\n\nThis place had a lot of ambiance and our waitress was really polite and attentive - she more than made up for her rude colleague. \n\nThe restaurant remembered that it was the bf's birthday and left a card on a table - a nice personal touch. \n\nThe musicians were really good - a great show, yet not so loud that we couldn't carry on our conversation. \n\nSo all in all, we had a great night and if it weren't for the rude person who answered the phone, this would probably be a 5 star experience.", "author": "A K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-06-29", "description": "This is a hidden at the edge of the Financial District. It sits in a narrow alley between Jackson and Pacific and between Montgomery and Pine. It might be technically North Beach, not really important. It's been around since 1988 but it feels older than that in some respects.\n\nAmbiance (3): Old school steakhouse feel that is marred by wall decor that reminds me of the 80s or 90s, heck I could make a reference to the \"Saved by the Bell\" intro...just go, you will see what I mean. There are swirls all over the walls that I am sure are great echo killers (there is live music at times), but exudes I love the (early) 90s. The waiters/servers wear white jackets and are tres formal, again steakhouse vibe. The booths do feel a little aged and with the lights full on, they can't be very attractive. It does have potential and it wouldn't take much to get it into the art deco terrain. Oh and we had a guy playing the piano as we ate for a bit, which was nice.\n\nFood (4): Before I dive into what I actually ate, I have one question: is halibut the only fish out there? Just consider that next time you go to a restaurant that has the classic deployment of 1 fish, 1 chicken, 1 steak, 1 pork, 1 hamburger, 1 shellfish, 1 veggie entree deployment. Moving on...there were a few appetizers that were pulling at my heartstrings; ceviche, deviled eggs, beet and goat cheese skewers, steak tartare, but there was one that you don't see on many menus (at least not nearly as much as halibut) and that was bone marrow. It was presented in four pieces with a little spoon and accompanied by parsley/shallot/caper/vinaigrette salad, toast, and some coarse salt. Perfection. It was better than the bone marrow I had at Incanto (gasp!) even though the way it is served at Incanto (split lengthwise) made it easier to get every delicious little bit of bone marrow. For the entree, I had a Kobe beef bavette steak, which is fancy talk for a skirt steak like cut. I ordered it rare as god intended Kobe beef to be ordered, but it wasn't as flavorful as I recall my last Kobe dish (aside from those Google burgers) was. Nevertheless, it was tasty and came with a couple of roasted cippolini onions (heart) and an excellent and oh so delicate potato puree. \n\nThe wine list was ok but it had a malbec so it was game on. However, I am surprised this is a second time I see a 2009 malbec on a list and similar to the last one I tried, it lacked some soul. I think I might need to open my 2005 bottle and recalibrate my expectations once and for all.\n\nService (3): Steakhouse formality, but no real complaints. However, I would venture to say that I have had waiters at steakhouses with a bit more life. Also, I cringed every time the water guy came dangerously close to my glass of wine with that water jug. He could have moved it. Also, when they would clear the table they would sometimes leave random items (butter dish, the odd knife) on the table and we are going full stuffy, let's go full stuffy. You know what I mean?\n\nValue (4): Prices were reasonable. I should start coming here for the $11.75 bone marrow. Of course the truffled fries were a bit pricey, so stick to hitting Frjtz for that craving.\n\nOverall: I liked this place. If they overhauled their interiors, I would like it even better. Regardless of the ambiance, I will have to go back for that bone marrow. Hopefully, they don't rotate that off the menu any time soon.", "author": "Alvaro H."}

I plan on visiting the other fancy schmancy spots in San Francisco just to compare.\nWe didn't have to wait at all.  We had reservations for 8 and got there at 7:50 and were seated immediately.\nIt was my manfriend's 27th birthday.  They seated us upstairs, which was really nice and we got a view of the whole restaurant.  There was a card upstairs that said \"Happy Birthday from Bix\", which I thought was a nice touch.\nThey had a prix fixe menu, which seemed like a good deal.  Two choices of apps/entrees/desserts for $37.  But alas, we did not choose this option.\nWe started off with booze (of course)\nI got the ginger gimlet and he got the Bix rickey.  The Bix rickey was definitely not as sweet as I thought it was going to be.  It looked and smelled like a girly drink, but it tasted like pure liquor.  Delicious.\nThe ginger gimlet was TASTY and boozy as hell. I couldn't finish it, so I ended up giving it to the boy because I'm a sissy and didn't want to kill my tastebuds before I ate. \nHowever, it was delicious.\nDelicious!\nFood:\nI started off the with potato pillows with creme fraiche and the caviar.\nThen I had the ceviche with toasted corn nuts, and then I finished off with the American kobe steak bavettes.\nDELICIOUS.\nThe potato pillows were a glorified tator tots for sure.  They were delicious and served on a folded napkin, which was kind of rad.\nMy ceviche had a really odd taste to them.  It was slices of fish with slices of avocado but on top, it was the corn nuts.  The corn nuts kind of threw off the whole taste.\nIt was strange, but tasty.  Next time I would definitely pass up the ceviche and get something else.\nMy steak was DELICIOUS.  The onions, the mashed potatoes, oh my god.  Very tasty.  The jus on top was so goddamn rich and buttery.  So good!\nMy manfriend ordered the lamb mini burgers, the fried oysters, and the halibut.  \nThe lamb burgers were delicious but reminded me a LOT of my dad's kabobs.  Hmm.\nBut oh my god.  His fried oysters with asparagus and prosciutto were SO FUCKING GOOD.  I kept trying to feed him my ceviche so he would be polite enough to offer me some of his food.  No dice.  We both knew that his outrocked my ceviche.\nI tried his halibut also.  Very soft and nicely cooked, but I really wasn't too interested in his dish because my steak was damn tasty.\nFor dessert, he had the malted whopper ice cream (with a candle on top!) and I had the chocolate bread pudding.  Very nice way to finish the meal.\nI pretty much waddled back to BART after the meal.\nOne beef that I do have is that our waiter guy seemed kind of annoyed with us.  Maybe it's because we were considerably younger than the rest of the crowd, but he seemed impatient and kind of like he was humoring us when we placed our order.  And after watching him awhile, we realized that he didn't really schmooze or go out of his way with anyone, so I guess it was just a bad night for him.\nAll in all, we spent about 2 hours here.  It felt like 15 minutes.  I'm not sure what that means, but I will definitely return to try a plate of the fried oysters just for myself and the chicken hash.\n\n*LONGEST REVIEW EVER*", "author": "Meh M."}

So, I  made the initiative to make reservations for our friend's 40th bday dinner.  We had a party of 10 (with reservations)  but it took 1/2 an hour before we were seated. The hostess was very apologetic which was fine. We totally appreciate her sincerity.  I was very happy we were seated at a round table right by the jazz band.  The food was very good as how i remembered it. The reason why I deducted 3 stars is because the service was horrible! Our waitress took away all our wine glasses before she asked if we were ordering wine for the table. I asked my husband, \"Did you not want to order wine? He replied, \"Yes, I am going to order wine but didn't get a chance to. But maybe they're switching out our wine glasses??\"  Ummm.....OKAY.....We did end up ordering 3 bottles and they brought back the same type of wine glasses. What I really didn't enjoy was when they brought our appetizers they threw everything in the middle of the table.  They didn't move the small table lamp but instead used one of the appetizer plates to scoot the lamp over. SERIOUSLY?? I don't expect them to come out and orchestrate because BIX is not that type of restaurant. I think the biggest turn off was when they didn't bring out a small dessert w/ candle for our friend's bday. I don't know maybe it was our fault for not ordering any desserts because we were stuffed. However, at Olive Garden they still bring out a small vanilla ice cream with a candle even if the table didn't order dessert. Plus the hostess and waitress knew it was a bday dinner. My husband made it very clear we were celebrating a bday. After we paid  the bill one of our friend asked another  waiter to help us take a group photo. We stood up and got into our places and literally waited for good 5 minutes or so and figured he was not going to help us take the photo. LOL!!

The service is excellent, from the bar to the table. Great dirty martini and selection of high end bourbons for my husband. It is dark inside, so a little difficult to read the menus, but overall, a really great dining experience. I had the steak tartare as an app, and it was such a large portion I ended up ordering 1/2 dozen oysters as my meal, although it too, was a small plate. The jazz band fired up around 8, and was receptive to our 2 selections after tipping of course. No singer :( but a good band indeed. We only had one gripe here and it was the large table they seated behind us around 9:00. First of all they had an infant with them. And 2 of the men in the party were wearing jeans and tee-shirts. Ok, ok, maybe the sitter canceled, maybe the in laws got sick, but really, even in that case, who brings a fussy infant and passes him around to the group to calm him the whole meal into a jazz club/restaurant that late at night. And jeans I can handle, some are so trendy these days, but at least put a button down on, or a sportcoat over the tee, SOMETHING to class up a little. And yes, we have 3 children between us and can dress down or up, we are pretty flexible, but this was just way overboard for us for a classy joint like Bix.", "author": "Anne B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-10-06", "description": "My husband and I flew up to San Francisco last minute on business and I had Bix on a short list of restaurants that we wanted to check out. The idea of the jazz supper club off a narrow alley appealed to my sense of fantasy of San Francisco in the '30's. Well, first off, the energy felt flat upon entering the restaurant. No question, the space is beautiful but it was missing that smokey feeling I was looking for. I quickly noticed that there was no jazz being played, just an older gentleman at a piano playing standards, very quietly I might add. \n\nAfter we were seated we ordered a couple of Martini's that were brought in the smallest Martini glass I have ever seen...2 sips and you were done. Our waiter was nice enough and made some good suggestions. Then the trouble began. There was a table of 8 smack in the middle of the restaurant that very quickly consumed ALL of the attention of the staff. You could see that they were spending serious money on wine and I presume food as well. The rest of the tables surrounding them seemed to be an afterthought to the staff. \n\nWe ordered two appetizers that we split, both of which took way too long to get. Then the real wait began. While I can't tell you exactly how long it was, we had finished our bottle of wine and had lost our appetite. The waiter finally came over confessing that he had screwed up and hadn't put our order in. He brought us a complimentary Ahi tartare (which was some of the most tasteless Ahi dishes I have ever had) to try and compensate for his error. While we appreciated this gesture, by then we had lost interest and the moment of enjoying the rest of our meal had passed. \n\n Overall, the food was o-kay. The Ceviche was outstanding, the Chicken Hash was good, Bavette with puree of potatoes was cooked perfectly but lacked flavor, although the potatoes were divine. All around - - service & food was spotty and inconsistent. I was hoping for more!", "author": "Kelly K."}

If I had known how amazing it was, I would've opted to go when we had more time... but the food was so good and we were in such deep conversation that we lost track of time and I just made it onto my flight! (yes, so unlike me) Anyway, when we first walked in - the entrance is in a little alleyway-like street - it was a little dark and reminded me of an old steakhouse or something.  But classy old where the older gentleman at the bar sipping on a glass of $50 whiskey used to own the largest cotton mill in the country or something like that.  We were sat a cozy corner table and started to have mini issues with having too many delicious sounding options.  We ended up getting a bunch of hor d'oeuvres and split a salad and a meal.  First we started with the Tuna Tartare (with fresh hummus, mint & preserved lemon on cumin lavosh crackers) which came out in 4 beautifully crafted bites.  WOW.  I could've eaten 4 to myself.  You always hear you shouldn't order sushi/raw seafood on Mondays, but it tasted fresh and yummy!  We then ordered the Truffle Cheese & Sweet Onion Croques which were basically like mini grilled cheese triangles w/ the crusts cut.  They came with 4 again & yes I have an affinity for truffles and mushrooms, but these little buttery, warm, cheesy triangles of heaven!!!  (note: all hor d'oeuvres come in 4 except the deviled eggs and potato pillows)  Before the croques came out though, our waiter gave us a little taste of the deviled eggs (with chives, summer beans & truffles) and by far they were the best deviled eggs ever!!  Who would think that you could make them that amazing, but BIX does!  (Thank you to our waiter for that nice special treat!) We then split the Star Route Farm Baby Lettuce Salad (with strawberries, almonds, feta & honey-sherry vinaigrette) and the Fresh Maine Lobster Spaghetti with Lobster Cream.  The waiter did say it was rich, but it wasn't as creamy as I thought it would be.  Sharing it was perfect (especially because we had so much other food!)  We only had wine, but they have some great looking drinks on the menu.

Perfect date spot, fun place to take parents who are in town, really just head here anytime you want a fancier night out.  Here's the breakdown:\n\nAtmosphere: Perfectly romantic and elegant, without feeling stuffy.  There's live piano/jazz, which I love.  A huge oak bar takes up one wall downstairs - which is a great place to grab a drink and take in the scene while you wait for your table to be ready (have waited probably 5 mins every time I have gone, but nothing outrageous).  The layout is an open plan two-story set-up (the second story is more of a balcony level) and super tall ceilings.  I also love the back-alley location -- really completes the speakeasy feel that they have going.\n\nFood: Consistently amazing.  For apps: the crab rolls are mini crab roll sandwiches (think traditional lobster rolls-style but overflowing with fresh dungeness lumb crabmeat).  yum.  The croques are always a crowd pleaser.  I once went during the peak season for heirloom tomatoes and they offered a sampling plate of the freshest, most tasty versions I've had (and I'm not a tomato fanatic). For main courses: the Chicken Hash is one of their specialties and it's delicious.  Kobe steak's obviously phenom.  They prepare the steak tartare tableside and it's standout.  Really, everything I've had has been fantastic.  One downer on desert was that they aren't allowed to flambe their bananas foster at the table (fire codes are always getting in the way of my good times), which is really why I had ordered it =)\n\nService: Outstanding!  Our waiter the first time I went was in the top tier of the best I've had.  My mom, who's particularly picky on service, raved.  Our server did not overpour our wine (big pet peeve -- when they try to pour out the entire bottle so that you'll buy another, instead of letting a little bit breathe) he also didn't take plates till everyone was obviously finished, and did not remove drinks that still had sips left (also a pet peeve -- I still want to drink that last sip of great wine!).  They consistently recommend great things off the menu and offer legit wine advice (good value recs, not just pushing you to the most expensive on the list)\n\nSo many good things to say!

So I needed to find a place that served good food that wasn't overly complex in a nice atmosphere while still serving food that would appeal to more sophisticated palates as well.\nEnter BIX and Yelp.\nBased solely on reviews I put all my blind faith in the powers of Yelp and booked a 6pm reservation for a Thursday night. It bears mentioning that for a reservation of 10 BIX was the ONLY restaurant I had been able to find amongst the 5 or so that I called that didn't require a credit card to hold the table OR limit the menu to three items as Jardiniere, Absinthe and Zinnia did. For the record, I find that practice ridiculous as the dietary restrictions within our group were many so a three item menu would have dissatisfied one and all. I also feel that 10 people is not difficult for most diners to accomodate without limiting their menu so a fine dining establishment should be able to plan accordingly or allow us to order ahead.  We had a non-chicken eater (don't ask), a heavily pregnant woman (LOTS of restrictions there) and a person with allergies to grapes and olives.  So you do the math if the menu is restricted to three items.  Kudos to BIX for obviously realizing such things.\nEveryone seemed to enjoy their meals. We started with a torchon of foie gras that was amazing. It was buttery, smooth and so delicious I could have sworn I was eating the liver from the goose that laid the golden eggs. We followed that goodness with some steak tartar that was okay but wasn't as good as I've had it elsewhere (but I'm pretty picky about my tartar). Rounding it up was the oysters and they were phenomenal. Probably my favorite part (please note that our pregnant diner didn't get to enjoy any of these lol).\nWe also started with a nice bottle of Burgundy whose name escapes me because I didn't order it but which I know to be pricey because my boss fancies himself something of an oenophile. I ordered the second bottle of wine and it was a $92 bottle of Montepulciano that I and others found quite good as well. \nFor the main course I went with the lamb and was completely blown away. It was the best lamb I've ever had. Period. Tender, perfectly rare (as I had ordered it) and with delicious and relevantly paired sides; I was thrilled. Everyone who ordered the steaks and pastas seemed to love those as well but I focused all my attention on the lamb.  When dessert came around most of us opted out but I went for the cheese plate. It was decent but wasn't noteworthy and the coworker that ordered the brownies liked them but they weren't outstanding. Her husband had the bread pudding and I had a bite and found it good but, again, nothing fabulous. I asked for a double B&B and think I only got about one and a half but the glass was warmed which earns a nod.\nMy only real complaint with BIX is that they had somewhat spotty service. We had a hard time reaching a waiter and when one diner inquired of a server (who was serving her main course) what temperature her steak was cooked she was snapped at that \"I don't know! I know it's the right temperature you ordered because you are place three.\" It would also be helpful if the valet (you would most likely need to use due to the heavily congested area) took cards and not just cash. If BIX polishes up those few areas they will have an extra star from me. I DID get lots of kudos from everyone in the office though so I'm pretty happy and will most likely return.", "author": "Jill D."}

She invited 8 of her friends to celebrate at Bix. Most of them had some type of visual impairment and there was a guide dog present. The host and waiters were confrontational to my friend about the dog and were displeased with it in the restaurant. They refused to allow my friend and her friends to be seated in available tables because they were unsure whether they would be reserved for people coming late for dinner - it was 10:30pm at this time which was highly unlikely for more diners to arrive. They forced the group to stand by the crowded bar and gave every impression they wanted them to leave.

The menu has been sitting on my desk and it's taken all this time for me to write a review.  Feeling ambivalent . .. sort of like the restaurant itself.\n\nI've been going to Bix for years.  Back in the day, it was a great restaurant.  The decor was lovely, the service excellent and the food great.  For sentimental reasons I chose this restaurant as a celebration spot for a milestone birthday.  People who know me well were surprised . . my taste for birthdays usually run towards La Folie or Cyrus. . more destination restaurants but I just wanted something familiar and also the friends who would be celebrating with me had spent many an hour over chicken hash and martinis with me at Bix.\n\nBix still looks gorgeous.  I love the room with the balcony and the long bar.  The cozy booths in the corner and generally how clubby and dark it is.  We were a party of 8 people and were seated promptly and on time for our reservation.  Service was efficient.  It was good but not very warm. . . we ordered lots of drinks, spilled a drink (could have been 'cause we were ordering too much) and seemed to be working out waiters' last nerve.  When you feel like you're getting on your waiters nerves, that just is never good.  It was nothing he said but his general air. .. as warm as an ice cube.\n\nThe food was solid.  I love the steak tartare - even the sort of cheesy table side preparation is fun, especially if the person doing it has a sense of humor. . .our guy did so it was nice.  We ordered lots of Hors D'Oeuvres - standouts were the Crab Rolls, Truffle Cheese and Sweet Onion Croques and the best was the Mini Lamb Burgers. . .I didn't order those, my friend's husband did but they were so good I almost pulled the birthday girl card and demanded his plate.  Since I was raised right I didn't but I sure wanted to!  \n\nThe entrees were good but not as good as the Hors D'Oevers and First Courses.  Here's my beef (pun alert!). . .I don't mind paying $30.00 for a Kobe Bavette steak. . .well, I sorta do, but I can overlook it 'cause I like some red meat. . . you get about 6-8oz. of sliced meat over a tablespoonful of potato puree.  Mind you, I am already paying a sick amount for some steak. . but it's Kobe so I know I gotta pay for the massages, etc. but don't insult me and my pocketbook by putting a tablespoon of potato puree on my plate.  That is just wrong.  It made me feel ripped off and that is something you don't ever want to do to your patron at a restaurant - I mean, how much does potato puree cost to make?  How much does your profit percentage need to be on this?  Throw on a lavish amount of potatoes (which were DELICIOUS btw) so your guest doesn't feel gypped.   All in all everyone was generally happy with their food and the sides, which are gorgeously seasonal,  quite good although quite expensive.\n\nDesserts were good.  I really don't judge dessert on presentation as I've found that the fancier they are, the less luscious they are. . .I know some restaurants have battalions of pastry platers who's sole purpose in life is to smear your plate artfully with a huckleberry reduction and quenelle your ice cream to within an inch of it's life and some restaurants have some poor, overworked pantry guy plating salads, frites, cheese, AND desserts .. that seems to be the case at Bix. . .the plating is simple so the flavors should pop. . and for the most part they did.  Everyone really liked the bananas foster and the chocolate bread pudding.   \n\nBix has been doing what it's doing for a long time and I think it's become rote for a lot of the staff.  While we had a good time, it was mostly the people I was with as opposed to the place we were at and  that's sort of sad because Bix used to be so fabulous.", "author": "Lainie L."}

It has that kind of old school charm and class.  The bar and stairs and d\u00e9cor seem to come straight out of a different era.  It's hard to even find, btw.  You need to know where it is or else get very lucky.  It's down the Gold alley somewhere in north beach.  I like the location really since it's very close walking distance to the bubble lounge and the rest of the north beach fun.  I had the lamb and a maker's mark Manhattan - both of which were dead-on great.  the place is really all class.  They couldn't even take a reservation till 9pm which tells you how small and how popular the spot is and when it was 9:15pm, we were sipping our cocktails at the bar still waiting.  When I was about to go ask how much longer the wait was going to be, I saw a guy holding some tuna tartar fighting his way through the crowd.  Apparently, the hostess sent him to give us a free snack and tell us that our table would only be a few more minutes.  Very nice touch.  The 3 piece band was just loud enough to insure that no one else could hear your conversation but not loud enough that you'd have to shout to your dinner friends.  \n\nThe big things on the menu, we did NOT order.  We didn't get the signature beef tartare, which you should get because I got it before and it was outstanding but apparently, we had some queasy stomachs on our team and raw beef wasn't going to be working for us.  We didn't get the interesting burger entrees either even though they looked AWESOME.  My friend got the Kobe steak which, from all accounts, was amazing. And my lamb was probably the tastiest (is that a word?) dish of lamb that I can remember ever having.  I would recommend it although, wow, I do regret not trying the truffled burger!    btw, our ceviche with jalapeno chilies was definitely the right appetizer choice.  Very good and a good balance to all that red meat that we were going to order for entrees.  I'm sure it has an excellent wine list but come on people, it's Bix.  You have to have cocktails!

I had my reservations, but, I suppose I  wasn't surprised that I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at BIX.\n\nFirstly, ambiance is  classy without trying too hard.  From the outside, you'd think you were entering a Speakeasy Bar, but the inside is this effortlessly classy 1930's, Art Deco venue.  Think booths, dark reds and greens and yellows and velvet.  We were seated upstairs in a booth, perfect location to soak all the aforementioned up.\n\nFood was delicious and near perfect.  Shared the ragout of sweet corn with red pepper and fava beans with the bf and while we enjoyed it, it wasn't anything we couldn't make at home.  In fact, the corn tasted like canned corn not fresh at all.  As an entree, I  ordered one of the specials, the NY steak with french fries and a some greens that they called a salad (just some weed like greens lightly dressed with olive oil).  The 11oz. piece of meat was charred to perfection on the outside and cooked just as I liked it, medium well.  I ate every last bite.  The bf ordered the cheese burger, as I mentioned in previous reviews, he is somewhat of a hamburger connoisseur.  Meat was good quality and well seasoned, cheese was far from ordinary, but wait, only a bottom bun?  Apparently, it's an open faced hamburger...I think they should have described it as such on the menu.  For dessert we ordered the chocolate tart with strawberry ice cream.  It was not memorable and will not be the thing I recall fondly about the restaurant.  \n\n4 stars for quality food, time period ambiance and exceptional service.  The bartenders are friendly too, and can apparently mix up a decent Manhattan.", "author": "Marie B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-03-09", "description": "This restaurant is a classic example of a place that rides on reputation and fails on delivery. If the service were a little better, the prices less expensive, or the food just a little better, I'd happily give this place a higher mark, but I've got to ding it. \n\nI was excited when invited to this \"classic San Francisco\" establishment. Indeed, the little alley it's tucked into and the big front doors and dramatic, front - hall feeling bar are all nice. But the bar was hard to enjoy when upon arriving right on time for our 8pm reservation our hostess nonchalantly told us to go over and wait by the bar. We waited for half an hour, basically unable to get out of other people's way. It was tough to even get a drink and the bill for 3 cocktails pre tip: $43 bucks. Yikes. When we finally got to our table our waiter was quite good. I'll give the place credit for that. (Tall guy, grey hair). However, the ambiance was lacking. We were near the jazz band, which while good, meant we had to scream across the table to hear each other.\nOn to food: the cheese and truffle \"croques\" were really good, I admit. Like mini perfect grilled cheese. My friend got the ceviche and he said it was delicious. But it was also like 3 tiny bites. For entree I got the scallops which were very disappointing. You know I used to joke that my dad was weird because he went to really nice restaurants and ordered scallops, but I've come to love them. I order them all the time. These really did not live up to any of the scallops I've had in San Francisco (best probably being Starbelly). They weren't crispy on either side, weren't tender, the broth they were in was boring and the butter beans and weird accompaniment. These were scallops the wrong way: kind of rubbery and unappealing. I think I ate more bread than my entree... I don't expect all restaurants to serve the best food of my life but this place felt like somewhere that charges a ton just so you can feel like part of SF's old school elite for an hour or two.", "author": "Molly D."}

Great drinks, great atmosphere, great food, etc. etc.\nWhen I found out that my parents were coming to town for a visit, I thought we should check it out. So this is how it went:\nWe arrived at 7:50 for our 8:00 reservation. When we pulled up, the valet was nowhere to be found. We stood there for a few minutes and eventually he came running around the corner. Parking was $10 - he had no change for a $20 bill. \"No big deal,\" He said. \"Just pay when you leave.\"\nWhen we entered, we were warmly greeted and told to have a drink while our table was prepared. This was no easy task as there were twice as many people in the small bar space as in the restaurant itself. There was a VERY obnoxious group of 30-somethings pretending to be fashionistas ( I know cheap shoes when I see them, that's the tell ) in the way. I said \"excuse me\" at least six times and they still didn't step aside so that I could get to the bar. I wedge myself between one of them and the bar and he actually had the nerve to turn around and say \"excuse me!\" Thats what I've been saying for 10 minutes! Anyway, I ordered drinks. The bartenders do have an attitude, as referenced in earlier reviews. It was manageable, however, and not too irritating. The drinks were good. One of my party highly recommends the strawberry rickey.\nThen we were seated. This is where it actually improved quite alot. The service was outstanding, attentive but not stifling. This to me is the standout reason to go to Bix. The cute waiter kept putting his hand on my shoulder. He knows how to make the tips flow.\nThe food was good...not great. At these prices, the food should be better. The night before, we had eaten at Garcon on Valencia - half of the tab and twice as good. The potato pillows were good, although the pillow it self was a little too \"McDonald's Hash brown-like\" for me. The crab rolls were outstanding, as was the foi gras. The chicken hash was really silly. I mean, it's fried chicken salad. Why it is the signature dish, I do not know. The crab linguine with lobster cream was, again, good, but not great. I suppose the best way to describe the meal was forgettable.\nDesserts were okay. Bananas foster was good. Chocolate brioche bread pudding was better. Ginger  ice cream with fresh plums was unnecessary.\nAnother annoyance was that  the Jazz trio did not start until almost 9:30. One of the draws for this place was that my dad loves jazz. If I had known that the music didn't start until later, I would have made the reservation later. This info should be on their website. \n4 stars for the service and decent, if overpriced for the quality, food.\nThe interior is a bit shopworn and the banquettes are in desperate need of re-upholstering.", "author": "Jamie M."}

I hear the best table actually is the corner table to the left of the stairs, in which you can see the entire restaurant.  They unfortuanately do not take reservations for this table, though.  On to the food: I got the heirloom tomato cart for an appetizer which ended up being huge and so delicious.  I could eat it every night.  For my entree, I decided to go with a couple first courses: the midnight moon grilled cheese and tomato soup, and the squash florentine.  Both were delicious, but I was overzealous and didn't leave enough room for dessert.  I saw a couple cookie sandwiches pass by me, so next time I go I will need to take that into consideration.

Then a funny, laid-back but very efficient waiter came and proceeded to be excellent at his job from start to finish. Then I had an underwhelming, but not bad cocktail. Moments later I ate the shit out of some fantastic pancetta wrapped mozzarella drizzled with olive oil. My mouth was then assaulted with the mind-blowingly ridiculously exciting taste of a burger stuffed with truffles. Big, huge amounts of truffles. and cheese. and grilled onion. and truffle parmesan fries. this brought tears of joy. $27 hamburger-fueled tears of joy.

But I have a theory that the gorgeous interior is distracting diners from the mediocre food. We spent nearly $800 on food/drink and we should have had a better experience.. Croque Monsignor (grilled cheese sandwich) appetizer was slightly burnt. The house made mozzarella cheese, yawn, great crab cake tho.. \nAs for main course, meats not cooked as requested: a BIG no-no in my book. The seafood spaghetti elicited another yawn, pork shoulder was bland. \nService was a disappointment too.  We are big tippers and this guy did not deserve it. He seemed frantic and distracted. My food was served by a waitress from down stairs.. why?? and it was not as warm as I think it should have been.

The atmosphere is that of the sultry and forbidden Prohibition-era dinner hall. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, and they gave us the perfect table-- right near the piano player. This place is gorgeous, the live Jazz a treat, and the food was overall delicious. I recommend ordering your favorite cocktail here rather than off the cocktail menu-- we both found our first round to be overcomplicated and strange. When we ordered Hendricks gin gimlets after that, we were happier. The appetizer we had was a delicate sashimi-- slightly oversalted but still refreshing. My entree was the catch of the day--- a superior Mahi in a light broth with perfectly cooked spring peas. Mind you, this was over a month ago and I still remember the meal perfectly. My boyfriend decided to opt for the duck and said it was crispy and decadent. The service was perfect.

For our bar experience I would give it a five!\nWhen we asked the concierge at our hotel where Gold street was, he said, \"Ah, you must be going to Bix!\" with a tone of approval in his voice.  Gold street is actually a quaint alley, so the old-world sophistication of Bix is a bit of a surprise when you enter.  It's truly a beautiful room -- very Art Deco in its design and mood, with high ceilings and huge columns to support them.  The quality of service is old-fashioned, as well.  The hosts and bar staff were very polite and attentive in their starched white coats with the Bix logo embroidered on the pocket.  Our cocktails were wonderful (appropriately enough, I ordered an Old Fashioned), as was the appetizer sampler we ordered.  Just enough food to stave off starvation, but not enough to ruin our dinner (the restaurant we ate at did that -- see my review of Mona Lisa's). \nI also liked that the clientele here were adults, not over-aged children.  When we arrived there was a small party of 10 or 12 people at the bar.  While they were chatting and enjoying the occasion they were celebrating, they were not being loud or shrieky, and they did not overrun the small bar area.  They were mature (and by this I don't mean \"old\") enough to respect the other patrons who weren't there for a party.\nWe had such a nice experience here that we returned for an after-dinner nightcap to wash the taste of a bad Italian meal out of our mouths.  One friend ordered Absinthe, which was served with full ceremony.  A jazz trio was playing, providing a soothing backdrop after the loud clatter of the place we had dinner.  Next time we'll skip the bad Italian food and have dinner at Bix!\nOne final note -- I often judge places by the quality of the restroom -- you'd be surprised how accurate a reflection this can be!

He's a descendent of the late Bix Biederbeck of the world of Jazz and it shows in the design, dcor, distilled spirits menu and the music that fills the elegant dining rooms and bar when its open.  In addition to being a really great full service, white linen restaurant, Bix serves up a classic burger that rivals the best to be found at 21 in New York and at the celebrity chef places that dot Las Vegas like fleas on an old dog.  Biederbeck is a maestro at everything connected to his restaurants and is always fine tuning and seeking perfection in every aspect of this place.  The burger is a large, hand formed hunk of premium ground sirloin that is mesquite gilled to perfection and served on a lightly toasted custom burger roll with excellent lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle as well as the best condiments money can buy.  Great hand cut, blanched Idaho russet potatoes are cooked to perfection in a high grade heart healthy oil and what is delivered is about as it gets.\n\nOther sandwiches are offered including a great steak sandwich and they'll gladly produce a vegetarian or poultry burger to customer specifications.  The fries are first rate and come in a copious portion.  One of the great and tasty appetizers here are the mini lamb burgers that are addictive and delicious.  They're like sliders and can make a perfect meal in themselves with a side of their great fries.  Bix offers a continental menu with a lot of contemporary California and is overall pretty good, but it is the atmosphere most people keep coming back for time and again.  One of San Francisco's most sophisticated and deluxe dining and drinking establishments that is as welcoming as the finest private club one finds anywhere in the world, this place is great and the burger is superb.", "author": "Stu S."}

I was in San Francisco for my brother's wedding, and while researching options for their rehearsal dinner, my dad suggested Bix. We ended up doing it at Piperade, which was awesome by the way. My brother is the editor at Dwell, right next door, so he knows Bix well (recommended their chicken hash after I told him of my disappointing experience.)\nin any case, we arrived for our 8:30 Valentine's Day reservation and were seated upstairs as requested. got the Ginger Gimlet and must agree that for the price the size of the drinks (in a martini glass) is pretty slight. we ordered the dungeness crab \"brioche\" to share as a starter. What came was delicious but way too expensive for the price - $16! 4 little bite sized toasts.  in any case it was good so we didn't think much of it. we had both decided on the swordfish special which came with a lemon beurre blanc. it was the thinnest swordfish steak I have ever seen! probably 1/4 of an inch thick. the sauce was good, and not overwhelmingly, but I remember wishing there had been more because the accompanying vegetable was broccoli, which was very bland. and who serves broccoli with a $34 entree? it wasn't even broccolini...\nwe had some nice wine which was fine. \nThe kicker came when at about 10:00 our server brought out our check although we had asked for coffee - espresso. we had both flown from Europe for the wedding so were tired and also accustomed to an espresso after dinner. I was rather surprised that our waiter - Doug - brought the check without being asked and I was astonished that when we reminded him of our coffee order, he whisked that check right off the table and returned, with the 2 espressos (actually disgustingly strong) and the adjusted bill. Call me crazy, but I would expect that if the server makes a mistake on a small item like coffee ($6) he would just let it go.  In addition my boyfriend couldn't drink the coffee and we ended up asking someone else to add some hot water because Doug was nowhere to be found. \nthe live music was nice, but I was very disappointed.

I made an 8:00 reservation on a recent Friday night.  We were told to sit at the bar until a table opened up.  I thought an 8:00 reservation meant that we would be seated at 8:00.  After 10 minutes, I asked when what was going on, and they said some people were getting up, and it would be just a few minutes.  We did in fact see people getting up, and then we saw others being seated - I guess those were other people who made earlier reservations and were finally getting a table.  After waiting for 25 minutes, I asked again when we would be seated.  Instead of expressing some sympathy, the hostess brushed me off saying I had only been waiting for 15 minutes.  That was not true, and I pulled out my phone and proved to her that it was 8:25 p.m.  She said it was normal to have to wait that long on a busy night.  I told her she should have told me that when I made the reservation, as I would have gone somewhere else.

After consulting Yelp, I chose Bix, and it didn't disappoint.  After searching for the restaurant for a bit, we found the alleyway of Gold Street.  \nThe decor is totally 19th century.  A query of our waiter revealed that Gold Street was actually right off of the old pier and that everything from their block to the Embarcadero  was actually fill.  So, this was the Barbery Coast, and Gold Street was were 49ers came to exchange gold for cash.  It is thought that the building might have been a gold exchange at the time, but their not sure if it's an original building or whether it was rebuilt after the great quake.  \nThe dinner was awesome.  All appetizers so we could sample a little of everything, we started with the Ceviche, Crab cakes and fried oysters paired with a Central Coast unfiltered Viognier.  The wine was nice, with a great balance of fruit and acidity.  The Ceviche was delicious with a jalapeno mix, the crab cakes amazing, fresh crab, lightly browned, and with a beautiful crispy bread surrounding, then finally the fried oysters with a delicious cream sauce on a gentle wafer.  The next course consisted of lamb sliders, St. Johns Marrow and truffled oil french fries.  All were amazing, the lamb had a taste of Moroccan spice, the marrow simply decadent, and french fries that delighted.  I paired these dishes with a Pinot Noir from the North Coast that was definitely new world, but fine, delicious and perfect for the food at hand. \nWe talked and negotiated over our delicious food, but the apex of the dinner was when Fred confided in me that over the past ten years American cuisine has really progressed beyond anyone's potential aspirations.  He confided that he thought that you can actually eat better in America than in France.  Having grown up in France half of my life, I think that this might have been a wine induced exaggeration, but it's really nice to hear that from a true bon vivant.  Cheers.", "author": "Nicolas T."}

The crab pasta is very good but extremely rich. I've tried my hubby's Kobe beef steak and it was delish. Great for out of towners, birthdays, you name it!", "author": "Sarah R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-10-23", "description": "For more than seventeen years, Bix has provided San Francisco movers & shakers, travelers \"in-the-know,\" and food lovers from around the world an exceptional place to dine. Or that's what I've been told by several colleagues and friends. Naturally, I was intrigued, so I decided to give Bix a try. \n\nAtmosphere\nTucked in an alley between several high-end antique stores, Bix is reminiscent of an elegant supper club from the 1930s. Upon entering the restaurant, I stood at the enormous curved mahogany bar until my table was ready. Service was efficient, although the bartender didn't spend too much time telling me about their special cocktails or bar menu, which included firecracker shrimp with chipotle aioli ($11), tuna tartare on olive toasts ($12), seared day boat scallops wrapped in chorizo ($11).  The tuna was excellent: fresh and flakey with just the right amount of subtle fishiness, blending perfectly with the olive toasts. The buttery scallops and plump shrimp also worked well, although the chipotle aioli tasted like it had been prepared with out-of-date mayonnaise. Oh well. After ten minutes, I was taken to my table, which turned out to be a cozy, faux-velvet covered booth on the second floor. \n\nThe interior of Bix is stunning. You'd expect to see Frank Sinatra at the bar ordering a martini, or perhaps Jean Harlow sauntering down the staircase to go \"powder her nose.\" Other nice interior features included fluted columns, starched linens and polished flatware. The wait staff is dressed to impress in white jackets, which added a nice touch to the already elegant ambiance. \n\n\nThe Food\nChef Bruce Hill's 25-years of experience includes stints at some of California's finest restaurants, including Stars, Aqua, Oritalia and the Waterfront. Of course, you'd expect all of his experience to translate into an incredible meal from start to finish. And for the most part, this was the case, although there were a few misses. The chef's selection of mixed hors d'oeuvres ($9.75 per person) was a surprisingly tasty assortment of tuna tartare, foie gras mousse, cauliflower panna cotta and truffled potato puree' in crispy potato cups. I could have done with a few more potato cups, which were crispy, flavorful, and just about the best thing I've had in my mouth in quite some time. On the other hand, and due to a childhood cauliflower trauma incident, I wasn't thrilled with the cauliflower panna cotta. The chilled summer gazpacho of heirloom tomatoes, melons, and cucumber  ($8.25) was extremely light and refreshing, and really set the stage for the next courses. Other excellent first courses included arugula and nectarine salad with champagne vinaigrette ($9.75) and the romaine salad with Point Reyes blue cheese vinaigrette ($9.25). \n\nAs for entrees, the Florida gulf prawns with potato gnocchi, sweet fennel, tomatoes and bread crumbs  ($26) were outstanding. Big and juicy, the tender flesh of the prawns blended superbly with the tartness of the tomatoes. On the other hand, and what I feel is a poor description that should be clarified on the menu, is the Maine lobster spaghetti with langoustine tails ($28). At first glance, one is led to believe that there are going to be large chunks of lobster included in the dish. Instead, the spaghetti is cooked in a lobster-flavored broth. That's right, no big chunks of lobster, for what is otherwise a lovely pasta dish. Other entrees worth mentioning include grilled rack of lamb with lentils and minted carrots ($32), and Kobe \"Bavette\" steak with pommes puree, roasted spring onions and natural jus ($29). And then it was time for dessert. As a confessed \"chocoholic,\" I was quite pleased with pastry chef Aaron Toensing's warm chocolate brioche bread pudding ($7.75). Come to think of it, there's really nothing better than anything made with chocolate to end a great meal. Other desserts included bananas foster with dark rum and vanilla ice cream ($7.95), strawberries with brown sugar cream ($7.75), and Bix cookies, jellies and ice cream sandwiches ($7.50).\n\nIf you've been looking for a great place for a romantic dinner surrounded by elegant ambiance, Bix just might be the place you've been looking for.", "author": "David G."}

Made a girl date and we headed over after a happy hour at bubble lounge to try the item of choice - gin martini and their tuna tartar. I'm not really a gin drinker - but if the list says to try the gin martini thats what i order. I AM a tuna lover however so I was happy for the excuse to up my mercury intake. Gin martini was surprisingly good, actually, they may have turned me into the occasional gin (instead of vodka) martini drinker. The tuna tartar was very good, but i order it so often everywhere i go i wasn't sure how i'd rate it alone. Definitely really good - but one of the best things to eat in the city? debatable. And their menu is fabulous, everything sounds good so we were confused on how this pairing made the list. Then - it dawned on us - its the pair. Have a sip of your very strong, bitter martini then a bite of the very mellow, soft but flavorful, almost buttery tartar and vice-versa and Ta-Daaaa - they are the perfect combo to compliment eachother. I really liked the dish. We also had a few sides, bread right outta the oven, broccoli and brussel sprouts. The brussels were the best I've ever tasted, I could have had another full bowl of them. Then we orderd a banana foster to split. Divine. Hot bourbon sauce melting the creamy vanilla with a just right ripened banana - and a side of 2 coffees - heaven. The atmosphere was very classy too.

And you know, I just love the painting of the clown and ballerina (my sister took a picture of it and it's her wallpaper on her computer).\nBix has that speakeasy kinda feel.  It's hidden in one of the many alleys of the city but once you step inside, you're almost transported out of modern day SF into the old \"jazzy\" black and white era.  And actually, they have live jazz some nights!\nAnyway, we were last there for my birthday in August.  There were 8 of us and we thoroughly (and shamelessly) enjoyed ourselves ordering a bit of everything.  A few of our favorites: caviar potato pillows, firecracker shrimp, american kobe steak, the lamb, crab pasta, and bananas foster.  Oh, and we had several bottles of wine :)\nThe bill was pricey, over $1200, but the food, service, ambiance, and really just enjoying yourself with good friends made it all worth it.

The food is always good for many years now; over ten years since I have eaten here over forty times. It's located on very small one way street which you can not park on. It serves late and the wine and cocktail list is very good. Great for a date, business meeting or dining alone at the bar. The crowd is mostly professionals/thirty and over make up the mix of people. It is busy almost every time I have been in either for dinner or late night.

I would drive directly from the airport in order to get there before the kitchen closed.  I still love this place even though now I only get there a few times a year.\n\nThe decor is elegant the live music really makes the old supper club feel.  You are greeted by a host or hostess who takes your coat and shows you to the bar where you always have to wait.  I don't  mind because I love the bar and the bartenders.  They not only mix a stellar martini but they do a great job of making you feel welcome.  The crowd at the bar is alway friendly.  Mostly locals or people from out of town who used to live in the city.  It's not a place you stumble upon walking down the street.  Unless of course, you turn down a lot of alleys in your travels.\n\nI love sitting upstairs when I am with friends.  You can look down at what is happening at the bar and you have a great view of the band.  When I am in for a bite after a trip I sit at the bar and have a martini with a couple of appetizers.  I have never had a bad meal at Bix and I have eaten there a lot.\n\nIf they happen to have it, the Caprese salad is the best I've ever had anywhere.  It may or may not be on the menu, but ask.  It is worth the effort of remembering.  The tomatoes are fresh and have flavor I have never experienced and the mozzarella cheese is perfect.  They drizzle the magnificent olive oil on it and I could have a huge portion of it as a meal and be happy.  If they have oysters, that is always a great choice as well.  For the main course I usually have either the lamb or the pork chop, both of which are always prepared well.  The meat tender with just the right amount of seasoning.  Whether its the potatoes or fresh vegetables that accompany the dish, they are both great.  I have had the lobster spaghetti once and really liked it.  I don't usually like cream sauces much but this was light.  I am not much on dessert but I hear the chocolate brioche bread pudding is very good.  The trio of cheese is excellent.\n\nThey have a great wine list.  There are several wines that are made in small quantities and because of the restaurants relationships, they are always well stocked.  I have gone there several times with friends who really know wines and they were pleasantly surprised to see wineries they don't normally see on restaurant wine lists.\n\nThis is a great place for a romantic date or to entertain clients.", "author": "David S."}

A friend and I came for dinner here - the atmosphere is so much fun.  Hadn't been here in years, but it still holds up.  Very much a martini joint, but with great food.  We had the potato pillows with creme fraiche and caviar as an appetizer - so light and delicious.  Then I had the pork shoulder that was served on white polenta with wild mushrooms, and it was extreme comfort food - absolutely wonderful.  My friend had the smoked trout salad with fuji apple and a special soup with pumpkin.  I didn't try the soup (pumpkin is not my thing), but she loved it, and we both couldn't believe how wonderful the smoked trout salad was.  Two disappointments over dinner and this is the only reason why it didn't get 5 stars - (yes, I'm being picky): we ordered Banana's Foster for dessert, and if it were true Banana's Foster they would have either flambeed it tableside (as it should be done) or at a minimum served the sauce piping hot.  It came to our table luke warm.  The other reason this is 4 stars, is that I ordered a sidecar cocktail, and the bartender made a poor version.  But shame on me for not ordering a traditional martini at this place known for its martinis.  So....4 stars instead of 5, but really, I truly love this place and will go back any chance I get.", "author": "J. S."}

Before I get into the phenomenal food, there a few other noteworthy things about the place. 1. Great, friendly service from everyone at the restaurant 2. Valet parking on a weeknight!!! The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the decor. It's not terrible, but could use some improvement. On the other hand, the food is so good - you won't care!\n\nNow on to the food. Bix is one of those restaurants that you can tell each and every dish is made upon order and with great care. We started with ahi tartare on toasts, mini grilled cheese sandwiches made with $62/pound truffle oil cheese and the arugula salad. The sandwiches were phenomenal. I then had the ahi for dinner, my friends the kobe steak and the clam spaghetti. I can't speak for the spaghetti, but the ahi was great and the steak was one of the best steak restaurants I have ever had.\n\nI think Bix is ideal for a Mon-Th after work drink or meal.

Soon after we started enjoying our drinks we noticed that we kept getting bumped around and were spilling our drinks.  The place was jammed packed and most people including us were forced to stand near the front door constantly being jostled and molested as people passed through. I also noticed that no one was moving to tables.  At 9:00 pm I inquired as to the status of our table.  I was told it would be soon, and then I went back to endure the cattle call with my wife.

Take for example, \"Sformato.\" This unpronouncably-beautiful word doesn't even have its own wikipedia page, and although it is described in a few websites, I am still not even convinced it exists outside of Bix Restaurant. That being said, the fact that it is pumpkin-sage flavored makes me not really care what you call it. It, like just about everything else on the menu, though unpronounceable, was delicious. I give Bix a 5-out-of-5 on taste.\n\n    My lamb, served medium rare, was, the best lamb I have ever eaten in a restaurant. The Cheese and Prosciutto was like eating sorbet on an incredibly hot day, but the opposite. Instead of a cool citrus burst, it was like a warm, sensual caressing of the tongue. (They actually did have blood orange and tangerine sorbet for dessert which wasn't that good, a fact I am happy to overlook because a) I was too full to eat it and b) It was cold outside and it was just a bad decision). I was fortunate enough also to have a bite of my aunt's gourmet cheeseburger. It was as good as any gourmet burger out their so if you are a finicky eater, the burger is a great way to go. It comes with fries which are good, but the side order of truffled fries (french fries topped with pecorino cheese and white truffle oil) were completely, outrageously, yummy. We couldn't decide between ordering these fries and the whipped potatoes; we made no mistake. Chef Bruce Hill definitely knows what he is doing.\n\n    Atmosphere wise, I couldn't really ask for better. They had a live piano player to which my mother commented, \"I feel like I am in Nordstrom's.\" I personally think Bix was much nicer and way more special than a trip to Nordstrom's, but both places know what a nice touch a grand piano adds. They have beautiful paintings on the wall, including a portrait of Bix Beiderbecke, the prominent 1920's jazz musician honored with the naming of the restaurant. The decor calls back to the time of decadent cruising and is complete with funny old group photos with men in tuxedos. They also have cool old maps of San Francisco in the bathroom which I am always a sucker for. More importantly, however, was the urinal. It reached all the way to the floor, which is my favorite urine receptacle, but it also had a bar with a slab at shin level angled in such a way that it blocks any splash back from getting on your shoes. Very thoughtful of them.\n\n    The reason I don't give 5 stars is the pricing. As a 19 year old, I can't really every hope to go back there. If you my age, unless you have the best job ever or a rich uncle that is willing to throw you some Benjamins to take a date out, this is not really the place to go. If you do have either of those things, message me and we can either talk business or pleasure; both would go nicely with their 10+ dollar specialty cocktails.\n\n    All in all, great food, nice place to eat, good for special occasions.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, check out my restaurant blog at:\n\nhttp://www.aaronstrick.com/iWeb/AaronStrick.com/RestauranTouring/RestauranTouring.html", "author": "Aaron S."}

We asked for a different table and were told that there was one table downstairs, but that it was adjacent to the live music.  Since the music wasn't starting for more than an hour, we changed tables.  \n\nService was slow and inconsistent throughout the evening.  We had to pour our own $85 bottle of wine and we had to ask for refills on coffee.  The appetizers were the best part of the meal.  We enjoyed the steak tartare as well as the crab rolls.  The main courses were less satisfying.  The sea bass was unmemorable.  My husband enjoyed his pork chop.  The bananas foster was excellent.\n\nWe definitely won't rush back. For the price, other restaurants provide a much better combination of food and service.", "author": "RJ E."}

The slightly hidden location was a nice touch and the ambiance inside was sophisticated without being stuffy. We definately do not look like your average fancy restaurant goers, but were tll given stellar service. The staff was attentive without being oerbearing, and never missed a beat. And the food.... doesnt get much better. Go for the carpaccio, you wont regret it. Each item we ordered was fresh and cooked perfectly. This place is a bit pricey, but after the experience it was definately worth it. You get what you pay for in this case. A great special occasion restaurant. We will be back.", "author": "Taler C."}

We arrived on time with guests who had not been here before. We were told it would be a few minutes, so we said we weren't in a rush and we would go to the bar for a drink. Just as I was ordering, we were told to  follow the host to our table. As we were led up the stairs, I asked if we could sit downstairs since the restaurant was less than half full. We were told the tables were all reserved. We were brought to the upstairs far corner booth, which is quite isolated and next to the service door. I asked if we could sit at another table. since there were at least five open tables. We were told that all the tables \"had been reserved by people who have been coming regularly for 21 years.\" I said that was a pretty silly explanation. He made us feel inferior but I did not want to cause a scene. Throughout our dinner, several tables remained open both upstairs and downstairs, so someone was lying. I don't know who directed our seating and whether the explanation was just bad creativity, but it really put me in a bad mood. Unfortunately, without the downstairs buzz and other distractions, our attention went directly to our meal. The food was ok, if you like heavy sauces and overpowering flavors. As an example, the entire albacore tuna plate had a strong smoke flavor. When I tasted it, I also detected a ham flavor. Since the person who had the  tuna does not eat ham, we were hoping it was just nasty smoke. After I complained to the manager, our deserts were comped. But that's no big deal on a $350 ticket. The only thing that really saved the evening was our waiter, who did an excellent job and deserves 5 stars. Food- 2 stars. Host-0 stars. No music on Friday night-0 stars. Upstairs back corner booth- Don't sit there.", "author": "Ru B."}

Otherwise it would be so popular you would need to get a reservation a year in advance. Located in a small alleyway between Jackson and Pacific, Bix is a very traditional classy restaurant where you will find business professionals sipping on post work cocktails. Not the usually hipster crowd that fills the more trendy restaurants, this place screams old fashioned classiness. Classy with live jazz piano and a swanky bar. Classy with high ceilings and huge oil paintings. This is the kind of restaurant the rich (and I mean people from Pacific Heights) frequent. The service was impeccable, and the food was melt in your mouth heavenly deliciousness. Even the bread was offscale. Warm and buttery, flaky and light as air. We started with an appetizer of fresh home made mozzerella wrapped in prociutto and drizzled with olive oil. Then came an asparagus soup laced with a meyer lemon cream and chives. Perfect for springtime, as asparagus is very much in season right now. I had a very small salad for dinner, because I wanted to save room for the chocolate brioche bread pudding which I heard was to die for. Good thing I did, this dessert is over the top decadent. Dark chocolate with gooy chocolately bread and more dark chocolate oozing all over the place. The whole delicacy is topped with chantilly and shaved dark chocolate. The most intensely chocolatey dessert I have ever tasted. Congratulations Bix, you've won my approval!", "author": "Kate A."}

Because of delightful \"connections\" my family was comped a ton of appetizers at Bix. The ones that stand out in my mind and that I still talk about when telling people where to eat in San Francisco are the potato puffs with creme fresh and caviar, and the fried and stuffed squash blossoms (I think they were stuffed with cheese and crab or something). These apps where like little pieces of heaven. I don't remember what my main course was, but I tried my dad's chicken hash, which was splendid. The waiters were extremely sweet and helpful.

Table was not ready at 9, which wasn't an issue for us.  I had the kobe bavette, which I ordered medium rare, and it arrived at the table pre-sliced and the two end slices were grey being completely overcooked.  I didn't complain, since this was a business dinner, however it was so obvious that it really shouldn't have been allowed to leave the kitchen.  This wasn't the big issue for me, what was egregious was the fact that we were still at our table finishing after dinner drinks when the lights were turned up like it was last call at some cheesy bar.  Granted it was midnight, however we weren't sat until after 9PM.  I made a joking comment to the manager who was there, he didn't seem to care and then the lights were turned up again.  We got the hint, got the check and left.  Not a nice way to end the evening.

It was my suggestion since I had been there once years ago only for drinks and remembered how much I enjoyed the overall ambiance of the place. One thing that makes it difficult is that it is in an ally way. However, I think they have their regular fan base and don't do too bad because from what I hear they've been around a while. It's kind of cool that it's got that NYC feel being in this obscure ally way and all and you pull right up and luckily there is valet. Our party of four was all there so we immediately got seated and they seated us at the table right in front of the band set up. We had 9PM reservations so that was about the time the music was going to start which I was looking forward to because I enjoy Jazz. We ordered drinks in which took quite some time to get back to us. Although our waiter was nice and polite, I'm not sure if it was the other people he communicated with or what, but in general the service was kind of slow. The food took quite some time to get to us. I'd say we waited about close to 45 minutes. And by that time, it wasn't super busy. I mean then again the restaurant is not that big either so I didn't feel there was an excuse to take that long to serve us. In anycase, thankfully, our food was DELICIOUS! So with that I cannot complain. We ordered the special that evening which was a New York Steak and fries with some Shrimp too. My boyfriend and I split the meal, and I'm glad we did because it was PLENTY for both of us. The portioning was excellent. The cost of our dish itself was 47 dollars which was probably the most expensive thing on the menu. Not bad at all. The pricing is definitely not bad. And nothing like some great jazz to kick off a great meal. Overall, a GREAT restaurant, I would definitely come back for drinks at the bar or dinner for sure because the food was great. The only thing I have to complain about is the slow service. I did hear from another friend that they had the same experience in which it was a bit slow for them too. Hopefully that will get picked up. But looking forward to going there as often as I can otherwise! Yayyy Bix!", "author": "ST1223 T."}

They even waived the (quite outrageous) $25 corkage fee because we purchased an additional bottle. You should defiantly go this route if you're planning to bring your own wine. You have to ask them to waive the fee, but then you get two bottles for around 30-40 (if you stick the lower-end wines on the list). Apps were pretty good...mini lamb burgers were EXCELLENT.... tender, and flavorful with just the right amount of spice. Shrimp were lackluster-not fiery as promised, just over-breaded and bland. Entrees were all VERY good. Pork Chop was sizable, tender and moist. Kobe beef didn't taste all that different from a really good fillet, but was presented beautifully. My crab spaghetti with lobster sauce was rich for sure, but not overly creamy or greasy. In fact, the sauce was light and flavorful, pasta cooked al dente and large chunks of sweet crab meat throughout the dish. We also ordered the carrots cooked in mint. Carrots had a very unique (somewhat sweet?) flavor and were cooked well- still a bit crunchy. Bananas foster was underwhelming- 2 banana slices?? But the chocolate semifreddie with toffee was unique and not overly sweet.  Over all, it was BIXtastic!", "author": "Jenni D."}

There are many good reasons to pay as much as you do and to go through the effort of getting dressed up to eat at this joint. If you want a nibble on a budget, eat at a cute little joint in the oh so casual lower haight or maybe the mission in most cases. I found that eating and drinking at the bar at Bix was more entertaining and had far better service than eating at a table. The space is filled with soft live music and the chatter of people. The food is delicious and rich. My friend described the butternut squash soup as tasting  like the gourd was just pulled out of the field and prepared. My favorite is the blanched veal marrow bones. Indeed a little \"cave man\" , but a special treat none the less. Bix is also THE place in SF to have a martini, not too big, and perfectly made. This place would be exellent to bring a date to if you dine at a table.", "author": "Charise B."}

The menu also seems to rotate pretty regularly which is another plus! The decor is fun and funky-- like an old fashion jazz supper club. Definitely a fun place to treat a friend for a celebratory event. Going here for dinner feels like you are actually \"going out\" versus just grabbing dinner. The bar is a fun place to hang out too. Please be forewarned (if its your first trip to Bix) that the restaurant is located in an alley, so its a little hard to find.", "author": "Mama L."}

The buns are almost like creme puff material - smooth, silky and deliciously buttery.  The butternut squash soup has a gorgeous drizzle of melted brown sugar and the texture of rich velvet.  The chocolate bread pudding and creme brulee are both great, but if you're hard pressed, go with the creme brulee.  Delish.", "author": "Lily K."}

After a few circles, I saw the Bix neon sign glowing through the corridor. Almost appreciating the fact that you can't just 'roll up to the front.' You could hear a pin drop in the ally, but one step inside Bix and it was a great social joint. I let the lady order the Italian wine (she has more knowledge than I, so instead of looking like a fool I just nodded my head). For starters I had the lamb burgers which were very tasty. We also split a salad and shared the main dishes. I had the kobe beef which was filling, but her chicken dish was amazing. Almost looking like 2 patties, the dish was mixed with something unexplainable. After viewing the desert menu I told our waiter I'd pass, then I asked him if I was 'missing out' on anything. He responded with the chocolate bread pudding. I'm a sucker for desert, but it was rich and delicious. Great overall experience, speaking for my friend 'two thumbs up.'", "author": "omaid h."}

After being recommended by my boss, I decided to take him up on the offer.  My boyfriend made reservations, and asked that roses be placed on the table with champagne waiting upon our arrival.  We got there, only had to wait about 5 minutes (as they were packed!), and when I was taken to our table, I was definitely surprised.  So that was a great way to start the evening.  Then came the dirty martinis...ooh boy.  I am very picky about my martinis and they were sure spot on!  We both ordered salad, and an entree, both of which were to die for!  I was so happy because not only was it my birthday and I was sharing it with my boyfriend, I was loving every bite!  I really wanted to try their desserts but, we had decided long before that we were going to hope on over to Citizen Cake for dessert.  The decor is beautiful and its a pretty big space.  The restaurant itself is hidden as it is in an alley, but wasn't hard to find at all. Waiter was superb, and to be honest, the whole experience was!  It is a little pricey, but hey when it's my birthday dinner, I really don't care!", "author": "Samantha R."}

I was treating a young friend of mine who had just graduated high school. I made our reservation on open table and made a note on my dietary restrictions. I had never been to Bix and was a bit intimidated as we walked in. The clientale was older and refined (I am in my mid 30's, but I can easily pass for half my age), however the hostess and waitstaff was warm and friendly. Tthe ambiance was warm and welcoming . I loved the open second level with all of its circular seating, looking down upon the bar and grand piano. Aftter welcoming us to the restaurant, our waiter told us that he knew one of us had dietary restrictions. He told me what was \"safe\" on the menu, as well as state the chef would be more than happy to make a separate dish for me (which I ordered). The menu was sophisticated without being stuffy. The meal was wonderful and the portion sizes were ample. The sorbet was amazing (I know it sounds kind of funny, but you HAVE to taste their strawberry!). We enjoyed ourselves so much, we ordered another dessertt (chocolate) to take with us. The meal was a bit pricey, but I knew that going in. The quality of the food and service was well worth the cost.   I have been trying to find another excuse to go back ever since!", "author": "Ginger K."}

The 3 stars is for the service only - it was exceedingly slow - we waited a half an hour for our drinks and another 25 minutes before we ordered the appetizers - this was on a Tuesday night.  I didn't get the impression that the waiter was giving us time for a romantic meal because more than 3 times he'd be walking toward us, look at our table, scratch his head and turn around, knowing he'd forgotten something.  I have to say that all the other waiters were fantastic and constantly checking in on their tables.  I think we just happened to get someone with too many tables, or maybe he was just distracted.  But, absolutely no complaints on the food, it was wonderful and the music went a little way toward helping to distract us from the long waits.", "author": "Jessica T."}

The staff at Bix is just flat out rude... From the extremely unpleasant and unaccomodating host/hostesses, to waitresses with major attitudes and 100% focused on how much and how fast you order so as to maximize their tip potential.

The service was fantastic (they don't have a waitlist, but Elena was so great that she called me back when a party cancelled), and the food was some of the best I've eaten in San Francisco (and I'm a total foodie).  Lobster spaghetti, bone marrow, potato pillows with caviar were divine.  American Kobe bavette steak was delicious.  Truffled cheeseburger had amazing flavors, but was a bit overcooked for my taste.  Foie gras was good, but not a must-have.  Truffled fries were beyond delicious, and all the desserts were amazing.  Chocolate brioche pudding, bananas foster, seasonal sorbet, little peanut butter sundae, I could go on.

Our server was great, although it took him a bit to warm up to us.  We ordered a bottle of champagne and began our fabulous night out.  We were lucky enough to sit upstairs in the swanky booths overlooking the restaurant.  Make a reservation request if you can.  With the champagne, we were given samples of the potato pillows with caviar and creme fraiche.  A sweet treat to get our mouths watering.  For an appetizer, we ordered the firecracker shrimp with chile aioli.  They were fine; not great, not bad.  Just fine.  And how could we pass up the heirloom tomato cart after all we had heard?!  It certainly did not disappoint.  The tomatoes were beefy and juicy.  The olive oil was fresh and the mozzarella is housemade - how could you pass that up?!  Our server suggested the rack of lamb and he did not steer us wrong.  It was first time trying lamb and it was delicious.  Tender, flavorful and the side of ricotta and squash was divine.  Our server even suggested a glass of red wine to enrich our taste buds during the lamb.  We shared the cheese plate, complete with a candle for my birthday.  And he even gave us an entire plate of fruit to accompany our cheese.  All in all, Bix is a pricey place to dine.  I would suggest using the valet instead of driving yourself crazy looking for parking.  Ten dollars is worth the stress you are saving yourself.  We even left our car with the valet while we went to Cobb's Comedy Club down the street.", "author": "Jennifer J."}
