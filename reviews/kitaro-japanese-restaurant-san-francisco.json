Unfortunately, as time goes on, it seems that Kitaro is charging more for poorer quality sushi. \n\nVEGAN and GLUTEN FREE REVIEW:\n\nI got the avocado makimono and the seaweed salad makimono and both were sad, little things. They came randomly dotted with tobiko (fish eggs) which means that chefs don't switch their sushi roll mats between rolls. I sent it back even though I hate food waste and being THAT customer but there were fish eggs everywhere and it was not possible for me to pick off each egg one by one. My rolls came back fish egg-free and they were just fine. Sushi is just not the same for me without soy sauce for dipping, so I brought my own gluten-free soy sauce (yes, really). I would recommend doing the same if you follow a GF diet.\nIn the future, I'm going to tell the waitstaff to please take care that no tobiko gets on my food.\n\nOther vegan options are the Irish roll (make sure you ask for NO mayo or sauce) and other makimono rolls/hand rolls. The veggie donburi might be vegan, but you would have to check about the teriyaki sauce they use. I doubt the teriyaki is gluten-free. \n\nService is \"meh\". One of the waitresses is cold and condescending. The restaurant itself is FREEZING inside, so bring a layers and a blanket!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-23", "description": "If you are debating between the appetizer and lunch special, READ:\n\nI'm a pretty big fan of their lunch appetizer salmon sashimi ($8.39). It's pretty good and it's very well priced for their portions. They also have yellow-tail sashimi ($10.49) but I have yet to try it.\n\nIt's definitely one of the Japanese restaurants that are on the cheaper side. I LOVE sushi but I don't feel like coming back day-after-day and that's why the 4 stars and not 5. It could be the quality of the fish or their rice that's making me a little bloated. Their rice is not as well cooked as it should have been but it's pretty ok. Sushi rice is cooked different than regular rice and has vinegar in it. It could be the process of cooking the rice as well. That's the kind of quality I was expecting from a restaurant at this price range anyway. \n\nI'll try some of their other stuff and maybe I can add another star. I am moving soon but I will definitely come back to this spot when I get the chance. \n\nThere is another Japanese restaurant pretty much right next door so there's that.\n\nSo far, their lunch unagi-don has very generous portion of the eel. It's well made so I'd recommend trying that if you're into unagi ($12.59). The eel's texture is not as soft as some of the unagi I've had at other Japanese places but it still tastes pretty good.\n\nI will be going back to try their $6.29 appetizer ebi-fry (deep fried shrimp) and their grilled (salmon, mackerel, etc) lunch. \n\nThey will ask you if you want their appetizer or their lunch. I recommend getting just the appetizer since it's almost $3-4 more for just rice and a simple salad. At that price, you can get another appetizer or a small roll.\n\nBesides, Rice is $1 and Dinner Salad is $1.89 so for example their salmon sashimi lunch (comes with rice and salad) at $12.31 is more expensive than if you purchased them separately (by -$1.03). Appetizer Salmon Sashimi is $8.39.\n\nCheck menu here: http://kitarosushi.com/kitaro/menu_lunch.html\n\nBasically, you lose money if you buy a sashimi lunch than if you bought all of them (sashimi, rice, and salad) separately. \n\nFor their combination lunch, you get to add two items for a cheaper price so that could be worth it but I can guarantee their portions won't be smaller than if you just got the appetizers separately.\n\nPersonally I don't like salads very much and especially the free salads at sushi restaurants so I highly recommend just getting 1 or 2 rice instead of a combination/ lunch special :)\n\nIt's definitely worth a visit though!", "author": "Kimberly W."}

For what it is, which is a super cheap sushi restaurant, it gets 5 stars every time. \nTo start, I love fried soft shell crab appetizer, and this is the best one I have ever had. It doesn't have to be expensive to be excellent, and this one is gold. Bento boxes are really good and awesome for lunch. I never order salmon at most places because it simply isn't that great but the baked salmon teriyaki is never dry and always juicy. Next, their sushi is great, I can't understand what all the lackluster reviews are about. It's not 3 star Michelin sushi if there is such a thing. It's just extremely good and well-priced on a budget. More importantly, I have never had a piece of renegade fish here, and that's more than I can say about some of the fancier places I have been to. \nFinally, my favorite thing may also be one of the weirdest. They have a basic iceberg lettuce salad with cabbage and carrots. Literally, it's the most basic mixture imaginable. BUT, there's this dressing they put on it. I'm gonna say it's a Miso/peppercorn/vinegar/ranch situation. And, it's incredibly good. I order a large plate of salad just to eat more dressing. It's that good. Then it goes on literally anything  else on the table. It might sound weird to y'all. But you'll know when you try it. It's legit. \nFinally finally, the staff is wonderful.

I noticed they had an upper level that looked like a karaoke lounge, if you're into that kind of stuff :o) \n\nWhen I was flipping through their menu, font and pictures were exactly like Kiki's in inner sunset! Under the same owner maybe but the atmosphere here was way off compared to Kiki's. They even had the pink dragon roll like Kiki's! Alright enough of the comparing, let's get to the schematics. \n\nSERVICE: \nWe had all 3 waiters come up to us at one point. First the older Asian lady, then the Asian man, then a younger Asian girl stopped by once. The older Asian lady rushed my boyfriend and I. We told her 2x that we needed more time but she came to our table after a minute anyways, she wasn't rude but we felt she was a little too pushy. The older one and the man seemed everywhere, a little frazzled looking at times. So don't expect to find excellent customer service here because you won't find it.\n\nFOOD:\nLunch special(tempura roll, rock n roll and California roll): eh.\nPink dragon roll: also eh. Roll fell apart easily. \nEbiyaki: the only thing I liked about our meal. Tasty, flavorful, yay! \n\nSo overall, this place is good if you're on a budget and don't care for quality. One thing I have to say is that I find it weird that you can't see the people making your sushi. If this place is owned by the same people as Kiki's, they should really consider remodeling this place so customers can at least see someone making it.", "author": "Grace Anne D."}

It's REALLY cheap and I can get over the quality of the fish because of the price. I only have concerns about the cleanliness which worries me about the question if the fish is sushi grade or not. I am allergic to shrimp and crab, but I have never had a problem before. However the last several times I came here I had bad reactions and didn't correlate it to this place (or I was just in denial because I do like eating here). SO I put it to the test and I tracked my reactions with how long after eating at kitaro. It only proves to me that there is a lot of cross contamination between the shrimp, crab, and fish, but it also means that the work space isn't cleaned often enough, OR maybe it is the fish quality.\n\nOverall I think if you want cheap, decent eats, and you don't have allergies, this is the place for you, but be wary.

It's served with a generous amount of rice and a side salad. The shrimp and vegetable tempura are lightly covered in batter so that's it's soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. \n\nThe firecracker is also another favorite item.

It was hot as all hell and of course, SF doesn't know what to do about a heat wave, so we sat and sweated it out. \n\nMy friend ordered two side dinner salads ($1.79 each, what!) with a creamy, light, peanut sauce dressing. I was eyeballing the Sashimi, and you Yelpers said it's the best option, but I wasn't too hungry (but more thirsty), so when he ordered the 49er Roll ($4.79) and the San Francisco Roll ($3.69) I felt that would be enough food. We both liked the 49er Roll, which was spicy tuna, avocado, crab, and tobiko. The crab tasted fresh and the roll was slightly spicy. I wasn't a big fan of the SF Roll as the salmon salad was kind of mushy. \n\nOverall, I would go back since it's so cheap and I'm not really a picky sushi person: if it's spicy, raw, and fresh, I'll be happy.

She then proceeds to scoff and walks off... okaay, rude.\n\nOnce we were ready to order, we called over a different lady to take our orders. I told her specifically that I wanted the curry chicken katsu udon, she nods and then takes my other friends orders super fast, *DOES NOT REPEAT OUR ORDER*, and grabs our menus from us and runs off. Super rude. My friend ordered tempura udon, and her boyfriend ordered sushi rolls.\n\nLater, someone brings out a miso soup and just slams it onto our table. We were confused why we had some miso soup, but we didn't get a chance to ask any of the waitresses why we had one because they were too busy lollygagging elsewhere. \n\nThe first server then brings out a bento box of chicken katsu with rice. No udon. No curry. So I spoke up and said they took my order wrong. She then gives me this displeased look and storms off with the bento box. \n\nThe 2nd server comes storming over to my table and gives me this glaring look as if steam was about to come out of her eyes and nostrils. She proceeded to say, \"NO U ORDER DA CHIKEN KATSU~ Y U SAY U NO WANT THIS\" \nand I replied with \"No, I ordered the curry chicken katsu udon.\" I tried my best to be friendly but, damn, she looked like she wanted to rip my head off.\n\nShe then grabbed the miso soup (oh! so that's what it's for) and said \"I TAKE SOUP\" and she tossed it into the garbage can, and it was super loud. That was totally uncalled for.\n\nI know what I ordered. Obviously that is why told you it's wrong. Everyone else at the table heard what I ordered. We all discussed what we were going to order prior to ordering. Honestly, it won't even be that hard to put the katsu into a bowl of curry udon, like lady, just calm yoself. \n\nI have never felt so disrespected and uncomfortable eating at a restaurant before.

He claimed full responsibility for the actions of his employes. \n\nThe staff is generally cool, sometimes I can see they are a bit overworked and disgruntled.\nI recognize some of them as long term, over 5 years. I have been coming here for well over 10 years. Like another recent review, christian n noted, this place has changed from that time period.\nI remember the list on the door and waiting a long time to get a table.\n\nKitaro today vs yesterday:\nI think the food is about the same. \nThey have added some new menu items but it is generally unchanged.\nThe rolls are all the same as a decade ago for the most part with some minor additions.\nThe grilled food, fried dishes and the teriyaki are certainly unchanged. \nLarge portions and mostly traditional preparation.  \nThe selection of sushi rolls are mostly nontraditional = large Americanized rolls.  \n\nThings can get screwed up when it starts to hit the table. Most of the time the food all comes all at once. Forget ordering an appetizer and having it come first, it will come out as it comes out: out of order and quickly. From time to time they just strait up forget stuff and you will never see it unless you ask. \n\nBut the food is still the same after over a decade, even if the service has gone up and down over the years. Sometimes the tables are sticky. \nThe prices have gone up some over the years but it's still some of the best inexpensive sushi in town. Nothing overtly fancy. Kitaro's is what it is. I used to think it was great when I was young. I didn't know any better. Now I know about the varying different qualities in sushi. When you can get sahshmi this cheap you have to be willing to give up quality in exchange for a deal. \nWhen a Pacific blue fin tuna sells for over $1000 a pound Kitaro is a cheep option.

Willing to put this aside, we eagerly awaited our food.\n\nI ordered the vegetable udon, which was alright. My boyfriend was about to dig into his teriyaki chicken when he said, \"oh, God...\" I knew something was wrong and when I asked him, he pointed to a fly embedded in his rice. This fly was obviously in the rice cooker with the rest of the rice as it was buried pretty deep.\n\nI pointed it out to a server (not our server, who hadn't looked at us since we got our food), and she shrugged and said \"Oh, sorry.\" And backed away. I had to ask her to replace the plate; it was almost as if she thought the apology was enough. She went back to the kitchen and I watched her point the fly out to a cook. She came back and said they would remake it for us.\n\nThey brought out the remade plate, and we started eating. My boyfriend said he liked his food but I could tell that his appetite had been ruined (mine had too).\n\nAll in all, we had 4 different servers \"helping\" us, and not one refilled our water glasses when we gulped them down before we started eating. The glasses remained empty for the remainder of our meal, despite my asking 3 times for more water.\n\nDespite having a fly in our food, they did not offer to comp anything or take care of the dessert we ordered.

To the best place for rolls at a high school ninja's allowance and a college ninja's part time budget.  Ah yes... those were the days.  Today they are still the way this ninja had left them after he went on a journey in search of experience and tranquility.\n\nThese days, this ninja can afford finer grades and cuts of fish at other authentic Japanese sushi spots.  While this ninja would normally never order rolls, even more so with inferior fish after he left ninja school and into the real world, he has become quite the savage here at Kitaro.  He would never do their sashimi, and with all the salmon issues nowadays, he'd definitely opt out of anything salmon.  What he is game for is all their other sushi rolls!  Come on, let's be frank here, sushi rolls has become one of the best finger foods of all time with the combination of varieties of raw fish, sometimes cooked, teriyaki chicken (here at Kitaro), shellfish, all bundled up with that chewy roasted seaweed and fluffy short grain Japanese rice!  I really wouldn't recommend ordering anything else on the menu besides the sushi rolls.\n\nFor just about 40 bucks this ninja can pretty much feed his family of 4 here where their rolls range anywhere from 2.50 to 6 bucks while a few heavy hitters at 8 bucks.  The rolls you'll most likely see on this ninja's plate are (prices rounded):\n-Spider Roll $6\n-Godzilla Roll $5.50\n-Kitaro Roll $3\n-Rainbow Roll $8\n-49ers Roll $5\n-Rock n Roll $4.50\n-Kamikaze Roll $5\n-Tempura Roll $4\nFor descriptions of the rolls go to:  http://kitarosushi.com/kitaro/\n\nIf this ninja decides to claim all the rolls of the usual suspects, (do the math) it comes out to no more than 50 bucks after tax n tips for close to 50 pieces of tasty sushi roll bites!\n\nCome with a group of hungry ninjas to be sure you get to try all the different sushi rolls!  If it costs an American Gladiator about 10 bucks to super size a good beefed up combo at Mickey D's then this American ninja would rather slap his 10 bucks down at Kitaro, turn it into scrumptious pieces of sushi rolls with a bunch of ninja allies, and use the ninja chomping technique to make the little gems of ninja goodness disappear into our bellies.\n\nFor the price vs quantity and quality of their rolls ONLY... 4 ninja stars and a Yums stamp of approval.

I called my best friend and when she asked where I wanted to go, I suggested Kitaro. \"Kitaro...?\" she said, and I didn't like the way her voice sounded.\n\nI've been coming to Kitaro for 13 years, since I moved to the Bay Area in 2000. I used to wait for over an hour outside it to get in. As I learned more about sushi, how to better appreciate it, I've stuck with Kitaro -- it served a great purpose. It wasn't the best sushi around, not by a long shot, But it also wasn't the worst. \n\nWhat set Kitaro apart from its competition was a (relatively rare) mix of crazy rolls AND good quality nigiri, and absolutely the best price to quality ratio around. It simply was not possible to get sushi this good for this price anywhere else in SF. \n\nWell, forget all that. Now I know why my friend was disappointed when I suggested it. \n\nI don't think I'll be back. Crawling out to the Outer Richmond isn't as convenient as it used to be for me. There is no reason to make a special trip to go to the Kitaro of late 2013.\n\nThe quality of the rolls is very poor -- overall the construction of the sushi is very sloppy. Rolls fall apart, small and lopsided; fish is cut irregularly and layered together badly. Nothing looks appealing on the plate anymore.\n\nThe ingredients are no longer as fresh as they used to be, either. The fish is blander, and certainly some of it was older, too. Of course, freshness matters in sushi. \n\nI don't know if that's because of the obvious downward trend in the clientele (people have noticed, clearly, because it was half empty at 8:30 on a Friday night) or because of the general slide in quality, but the fish was simply not fresh enough.\n\nAlso, the place just generally looks run down now. It's not receiving care. The tables and seats are beat up. I don't know what's going on with the owners and managers, but clearly something is up. Nobody is paying attention to the way this place is sliding now. \n\nIt's sad. It's a San Francisco landmark to me. Heck, after I posted this review I noticed the profile photo I use on Yelp was taken AT KITARO. But now I would never recommend it. It's not flat out make-you-sick terrible, but there's no care or craft in the food anymore.", "author": "christian n."}

I read some of the other reviews and can imagine there being off-nights and bad service (as if that hasn't happened at every non-fine dining establishment), but luckily nothing like that has happened to me in the past...decade? Not quite sure when my family first started eating at Kitaro and ordering takeout, but it has been a long while. Of course, our family is based about a mile a way so I don't have to take a long trek there (when I'm in San Francisco). I'm not telling you people from Kansas visiting SF to seek out Kitaro (and ask for kid-sized chopsticks?? I would have given a puzzled look at that, too) or to drive all the way from wherever it is that isn't convenient. I get you - driving and parking is a hard thing to do.\n\nI live in LA now and gave some other cheap sushi place a block away from me down there a 2 star rating (maybe they were having an off-night too, but it was really terrible). Yet, every time I come back home to SF, I get some Kitaro. It has never merited such a bad rating from me. My family even felt comfortable enough to eat at Kitaro on Chinese New Year. Yeah, we're lazy and un-Chinese like that!\n\nNow...is Kitaro the most grand sushi place? Of course not. If you're even just the slightest bit of an upper class food connoisseur or sushi lover, this probably isn't your place. But Kitaro is my place.\n\nI'm a real fan of deals and value. So, if we dine-in at Kitaro, I'm not going there for spectacular service and fine dining. I'm going there for the affordable, tasty, non-Japanese food.\n\nI always get the chicken udon - I love the chicken in it. It's only $6.49. We also usually get California rolls. I love their California rolls - they are tasty! We went last night!\n\nAnd yes, going in line with my love for deals, we always have a coupon for Kitaro. They come in the mail, but if you're not fortunate enough to live in the area - you can sometimes find the coupons on the back of the 7th Avenue Safeway receipts. Hell, we even went to Safeway once to buy something in the hopes of getting a Kitaro coupon on the back. How backwards is that?? Not recommended for non-locals or most people, obviously - just us Kitaro junkies. We have four coupons stockpiled in our drawer right now.\n\nBottom line, Kitaro is where we go when we don't want to cook and are craving California rolls and/or sashimi.

I knew the salmon was cooked, but I didn't think it would be over cooked. Not only that but the rice was pretty hard; it wasn't even a bit chewy. So I sent it back because of it being over-cooked and because of the hard rice, and one of the waitresses came back and said that the pink dragon is suppose to be like that. Even though she was upset with me, she decided I can choose something else from the menu. I decided to just get the Alaska Roll.

Because simplicity has its charms and there is definitely something to be said about consistent good quality. \n\nKitaro offers a wide range of vegetarian sushi - the more trendy and upscale sushi places in the city have a one-page Ramsay-approve menu, but Kitaro does a whole 12x16 menu page of single-ingredient rolls, which feature usual veggies like avocado and cucumber rolls, and special treats like the pumpkin roll. Most cost under $3 and all cost under $4.50. \n\nI appreciate little things about Kitaro. Like how they don't assume I want my edamame cloaked in giant crystals of rock salt, but they offer salt and even a made-to-order garlic edamame. Be sure to try the potato croquettes - they're made to order and will be served piping hot, with just the right amount of breading and seasoning. The ice cream is a good quantity (and price), I even love the random storage-area (?) decor perched above the tables that looks like its barely tall enough to accommodate magical sushi elves. \n\nKitaro's no-fuss food is perfect for a quick meal and it's very comforting and trustworthy. Just like from my mother's kitchen. I know exactly what I'm going to get and I get the same consistency every time. Yes, the server barely talks and very rarely smiles, but she is alert for when the glass of water needs a refill. The person taking your order over the phone may hang up before they say goodbye and won't thank you for calling but you're not calling to make small talk and don't worry, they won't screw up your order. Like, ever. I work with a buddy who lives around the corner from here and we usually get a lunch to-go from here for under $10. I've eaten there probably at least 50 times in the last 6 months and they have yet to do so much as to give us a quantity of wasabi that varies between orders. \n\nThere's no awkward screaming of Japanese greetings as you come in through the door. I can almost guarantee the first thing someone (in a green shirt) will say to you as you walk in is try to guess the number of people in your party with a small, curious smile. Two? Three? \n\nMaybe that is what I love about Kitaro. The comfort of consistency. I'm sure I'll be back soon enough.", "author": "Meg P."}

Order hamachi, order maguro, order uni and sake and unagi and then try to tell me this restaurant isn't amazing.  In fact, let the chef decide and order the chirashi.  For you un-initiated, that means they'll give you an assortment of what they feel is freshest and tastiest served over a bed of sushi rice... and it's less expensive than ordering the sushi.

Came here on a recommendation of a coworker and I was very happy with Kitaro. \n\nThe minute we sit down, a waitress asks us what we'd like to drink. The menu featured lots of rolls at pretty awesome prices: $3-$12!! Yay! \n\nThey have a 2-Choice Combo Bento dinner which is great for sharing and comes with lots of sides. Prices are separate and depends on your choices. We got the chicken teriyaki and shrimp tempura- whole bento for about $10. The chicken teriyaki was really better-than-average quality: juicy and tender, not dried out. The tempura came with a great variety of veggies: potatoes, broccoli, pumpkin (yums!), etc. \n\nAlso got the spicy tuna roll and the Pink Dragon Roll (baked salmon on a cali roll): the PDR came in 9 thin slices and very delicious. Rice was cooked well and rolls made fresh. \n\nOverall, had a great experience- affordable, pleasant service, yummy bentos and sushi rolls!! A Yelper can't ask for more! \n\nParking is hit or miss, your best chance is around the quieter residential streets perpendicular to Geary.", "author": "Eva H."}

Everything is mediocre but at least the sushi is fresh and i don't worry about getting sick after i eat it. Also, the Hamachi nigiri is top quality.\n\nFood ranked in order: \n\nAmazing: \n1. Hamachi nigiri - SO WORTH THE PRICE. each piece was so huge it practically should have been two pieces. Love that it comes with the skin partially on. Very fresh and the best bang for your buck. \n2. Tiger Roll - generous amounts of unagi and avocado over shrimp tempura\n\nAverage: \n1. Volcano Roll - breaded and deep fried - guilty pleasure\n2. Tuna nigiri - fresh but not as big of a portion as Hamachi nigiri\n3.  Philadelphia Roll \n\nNot so good: Everything else\n1. Gyoza was soggy and tasted like something i would unfreeze and make at home\n2. Shrimp and Veggie tempura - very few pieces of veggie and very few variety, they didn't even have one sweet potato one! Also, the \"melon\" (??) pieces were way undercooked. \n\nOnly come here if you want cheap sushi grub that won't make you sick!

And the service there was okay they came around asking me every minute if I was ready to order with my friends but we just sat down for probably 2 minutes I felt pressured to hurry and decide (which I shouldn't have but I did) then at the end when we all got our food and ate our food we asked for the check no one came to our services I had to walk over to a waitress tap on someone's shoulder to get their attention and she told me to wait... I just wanted to pay with my card then leave but by then the waiter was gone to the back and seemed to forget what I had asked I had to wait around 15-20 minutes after finishing eating just to pay for my food...... then again I don't want to be so mean to kitaro because I've had better days here but that was honestly my experience lately and I was just devastated by the service and food this time around the only reason I would come back here is for their sushi and cheap prices and if I was hungry and close to this area.

I don't typically use credit or debit cards, but the time I chose to, card information was stolen. The way of coming to this conclusion was because of how unreasonably long it took for the waitress to bring back our card. When ever I tried to look for her she was no where to be seen which means that she might have been too busy copying down the card number.

It's great for cheap sushi but I've grown up a little since then. \n\nThe food is decent, service is ok, the prices are cheap (especially if you have their 15% coupons printed on the back of safeway receipts). The biggest issue I have over the years is that they changed their \"crab\" to those imitation crab sticks. They aren't going out of business... why do that?! All their rolls that have crab have those crab sticks. Yuck. So now when I come here, I either get the bento box combo or avoid all the rolls with their \"crab\". I have always loved their kaki fry though, yum! \n\nAlso, have you noticed there's a weird smell when you walk in?\n\nI still frequent here every once in awhile, but it's definitely no longer a go-to spot for Japanese.", "author": "Jeannie L."}

I've never had an issue with the food itself, but tonight the service was so egregious that we honestly won't be returning.\n\nOur party of 6 waited the usual amount of time for our table, and while the restaurant was full, there were at least a 9 or 10 servers making their way across the floor. Strike 1 came when the waiter took our drink orders. Only 1 soda and 1 iced tea, the rest of us wanted water. The soft drinks and 2 cups of water came out, but we were left with broken promises and dry mouths instead of the other 2 waters.\n\nOur table ordered our meals. I ordered assorted nigiri, and the rest of the table ordered dinner combinations and various cut specialty rolls. The waiter repeated back all of our orders to make sure he got it right.\n\nWe still haven't received the other cups of water.\n\nFood starts to come out, albeit slowly. Still no sign of water. We ask several passing waiters, who all respond with \"ok\" and \"no problem\", but still no water. The drinks that had been brought out are now empty, but no refills are offered.\n\nEveryone's food is out, except for my nigiri. We are finally given our cups of water, around 30 minutes after we sat down. My family starts eating, expecting my plate to come out any minute.\n\n15 minutes have passed, and my family's plates are now half empty. Anxiously, I ask a server if my order is coming out. She grabs the ticket for our table, but my order isn't on it. We go over what I wanted again, salmon, yellowtail, albacore, suzuki. No apology for forgetting the order, but she takes the ticket back to the kitchen. I figure, ok, the order didn't go in, they'll make it fast now that they know I'm waiting.\n\n15 more minutes go by. My family is finishing their plates and I still don't have food.\nI call yet another server over, she then calls another server (now 4 people have been involved in this order) and they say it's almost ready. Again, no apology. We're almost laughing at how absurd this ordeal is, but I'm also pretty hungry now.\n\nMy food is finally brought out - well, 90% is, the suzuki from the \"daily menu special\" is brought out 5 or 10 minutes later.\n\nI quickly eat my food so we don't have to sit around much longer. Meanwhile, my father calls a server over and asks if there's a manager he can speak with. The single word answer, \"no\". \n\nThe check was brought to the table with no acknowledgment that the order was forgotten, brought out 30 minutes late, and took 4 people to get correct. No tip was left and we will not be coming back. I'm normally pretty forgiving of service, but when they can't muster a simple apology, or let us speak with someone in charge (someone has to be in charge, right?) there's really no excuse.", "author": "John R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-13", "description": "I think Kitaro is a solid 3.5 stars, but they do offer coupons (and I'm a student), so I am going to round up to a 4 for this review.\n\nAfter craving sushi for the longest time, I asked my friend, a native SF resident, where he goes for sushi.  He recommended Kitaro Japanese restaurant, and so that night, we (along with 6 other friends) went to grab dinner.  It was a Wednesday evening about 7:30 p.m. and the restaurant was maybe half-full.  We were seated and given water and tea promptly.  \n\nIf you haven't looked at the menu (or read other reviews) yet, Kitaro is not your typical Japanese restaurant, or at least, not what I am used to.  They have a lot of variety from udon, to donburi, and tempura.  But where Kitaro is different is their sushi.  Pretty much, everything is about half the size that I would imagine it to be.  This sounds like a horrible characteristic, but actually, it works out: everything is smaller, and everything is significantly cheaper.  So, you get to order more items and try more things!  \n\nEverything is very fairly priced and the fish tastes fresh.  The rolls are nicely made and tightly rolled.  My friend and I shared so that we could try more things.  Between the two of us, we ordered:\n\n-Inari (2 pieces for about $2): Very simple and just as I expected.  I personally love inari, so I was very pleased with the cheap price.\n-Firecracker roll (5 pieces for about $4): For some reason, this roll came out by first, and by itself.  It is a deep-fried sushi roll containing tuna and drizzled with two sauces.  It is pretty tasty and a nice alternative to typical sushi rolls.  The sauces were good too.\n-Spider roll (5 pieces for about $5): The spider roll may be one of my all-time favorites.  The softshell crab inside was cooked nicely and actually decently sized (I've gotten some pretty puny-sized pieces of crab in the past at other restaurants.)  The roll was also made nicely so that it didn't fall apart when I tried to pick it up (which often happens with the spider roll because it is so big.)  This was really good.  I would recommend it.  \n-49er roll (5 pieces for about $4): This roll was also pretty decently sized.  It had tuna and avocado in it and was topped with tobiko.  The tuna tasted fresh and they filled the roll with it so that you could really taste the tuna in each bite.  \n(We originally ordered the Mexican roll, but they were out of guacamole, so instead we ordered:)\n-Salmon skin roll (8 pieces for about $2): This is a very simple roll with just grilled salmon skin wrapped in rice and seaweed.  It isn't anything fancy, but it tasted good and is very cheap/filling!\n\nOur total for these 5 items was about $18 before tip (and before coupon!).  It was quite the deal and we were both full.\n\nOverall, the food tastes pretty good and the service is decent.  They are friendly about refilling water and tea and the sushi came out pretty quickly.  Each of our orders came out at different times, which was not that great, but it was fine. My friend had a 15% off coupon, so it was a really great deal.  It was $75 before tip for a group of 8 of us, and we were all full.  Kitaro is definitely not fancy, but it's a cheap way to get some decent sushi.  The food is probably 3 stars, the prices will bring it up another half-star, and the coupons bring it up another half-star (as a student, I'm always looking for deals.)\n\nNotes:\n-Parking in this area can be difficult (unless it's past the dinner rush).  I circled for about 10 minutes before finding a spot.  Also, the meters are free after 6 p.m.\n-They often have coupons; our coupon was on the back of a Safeway receipt.\n-My friends said that this is a sister restaurant of Kiki's (in Inner Sunset).", "author": "Samantha L."}

The beef teriyaki is tender and just the right amount of sauce. The tempura batter could of had a little bit more flavor, a little bit lighter. It needed something. The mackerel was fresh and the tuna sashimi was good. The side salad with dressing is always my favorite part, but something was missing in the miso soup.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-02-07", "description": "I had always wondered about this fabled \"Kitaro\" place that kept sending me coupons in the VALPAKs all of last year. I finally had the chance to try the place out today with Mellie P., who made the suggestion that Kitaro serves \"cheap and fair\" sushi.\n\nOf course few of the sushi selections are authentically Japanese (meaning, the kind you would find IN Japan), but nonetheless, the joint seems to be a pretty popular place. It seems that people come here for the sushi fusions mainly.\n\nThe atmosphere is bustling, busy right from 11:30 (opening time); we were lucky to be one of the first few in the door so we could put our order in right away. By the time we left Kitaro, it was already packed to the brim, and it was only 12:30. Decorations are simplistic and modern, with a few Japanese theatre masks hung on the walls.\n\nThe service: they were attentive with us before the rush of customers, making sure we got our orders in on time, but they failed to come by our table to pick up our dishes/bring us our check when the lunch rush came in. I would have thought that they would have been eager to get us out the door since the stream of customers kept coming in, and we were obviously well past finished with our meal. Maybe they wanted to allow us time to relax after the meal? But I was feeling restless after awhile, so it would have been nice to have a little more service so we could get on out with our tasks for the day.\n\nThe food was decent; I decided to venture out into the sushi selections and ordered the Firecracker Roll and sweet potato nigiri rolls. The sweet potato nigiri rolls were intriguing, with the slabs of potato drizzled with teriyaki sauce on top. The Firecracker Roll was spicy and flavorful; I wished there had been more to the order than five rolls, though. Nonetheless, the prices were fair and I would have ordered more if the servers actually came back to our table and asked us if we wanted to add more to our order (more service = more tip?).\n\nI didn't expect too much from Kitaro, but I didn't expect the worst either. Maybe I'll come back (around 11:30 again) whenever I have sushi cravings (which, strangely enough, is rare).", "author": "Helene K."}

I'm not sure we came at their busiest time, but either way its as though they forgot about us. We sat down and it took about 7 minutes to realize we never received menus. Our food came out promptly, but there were some side dishes or extra requests that took some time. We always had to call on the waiter to remind them of that drink we ordered or when we wanted the check. \n\nPRICE: You get your average $8-10 meal for sushi, bento box or even your daily noodle.

The sushi was fresh. The chicken was well cooked. Salmon was a tad on the dry side, but was masked by the teriyaki sauce. The udon was very tasty and the tempura was nice and crispy. \n\nI would rate the overall dining experience as below average. While the food was pretty good, the dining environment and the hospitality of some of the waitresses were subpar. The timeliness of the food is canceled out by the dining room temperature. After eating there, it seems like I would be better off ordering to go and enjoying the food at home.", "author": "Jonathan L."}

When I lived in the Bay area, this was my go-to joint for very inexpensive and tasty sushi.  I loved it so much, that my cousin and I were here, at least, once a week.  When I go and visit the Bay, I still make it a point to visit Kitaro's for my sushi fix.\n\nMy favorite is the battered and deep fried Godzilla Roll (spicey tuna tempura roll, topped with a wasabi mayo sauce). Often times, the roll was so FAT, I couldn't get all of it in my mouth.  Not bad for $5.  The cool thing about the place is that they offer different choices.  This includes the Kitaro roll (grilled teriyaki chicken w/ avocado), for those non-seafood eaters, and the Irish roll (cucumber, grean bean, avocado, fruit and a sauce), for those vegetarians, to eat. The price range for their sushi rolls are $2.99-$7.99, most of them in the $4 range.  \n\nThe place is often times busy and if you don't want to wait, you can always order to-go.  The staff is friendly. The only problem I recall about this place is that parking sucks.  When you are hungry to the point where your sugar level has dropped, this makes the experience of finding parking all the more worse.  Though it may not be the highest quality sushi, the price and the taste of the sushi rolls are very well worth it!", "author": "Rianne D."}

I ordered takeout for lunch one day (my usual faves, Rumblefish and Drunken Sushi, aren't open til 5pm) and the whole experience was horrible.\n\nThe menu online said we got miso soup, salad and rice with our lunch order. Sweet.  We ordered two rolls from the lunch menu and a lunch portion of tuna sashimi.   So I walk over there to pick it up, they charge my card and I leave.  Then I stop and check the bag..wondering why it was $16 for 3 small items.  There was NO soup, NO rice, and the biggest portion of sashimi I've ever seen. It was like a whole tuna in there.\n\nSo I go back and find out they gave me the dinner portion of sashimi and that the soup and salad offer only applies if you eat lunch at the restaurant. UMMMM maybe you shouldn't put that on the to go menu then?!\n\nAnd why they gave me a dinner portion at lunch...I can't say.  Probably trying to make some extra $$. They picked the wrong girl.  I demanded my 2 miso soups and for them to give me a lunch portion of sashimi.  They wouldn't give me the soup for free so I told them to just give it to me and not refund me for the sashimi. \n\nInstead they charged my card again and voided the other charge. The difference ended up being $1.  Whatever.  But then they couldn't find the void receipt to give to me.  She started looking through the trash. I told her to forget it and just give me my food.  She left and came back 10 MINUTES LATER.  Just to add 2 miso soups and remove half the sashimi??? They were prob spitting on it in the kitchen. \n\nFinally, the food was just ok. No tofu in the miso soup, which is my favorite part.  My roommate said the sashimi was alright.   I'm so annoyed with this place, especially when there are so many rad sushi places to go to instead. \n\nDo yourself a favor and go ANYWHERE else!", "author": "Jamie B."}

I really used to love this place, but it's truly become a hit or miss, more miss than hit. Yesterday, we experienced our \"third-strike\" trying to order take-out. We started our order-take-out-strategy to eliminate having to search for parking or wait for a table. Although, there never seems to be a long wait, not like they used to have a few years ago (that's probably a clue that this place isn't the same as it used to be). \n\nLast night was the third time we'd ordered take-out, and when we arrived home with our order, the sushi was missing! We'd already paid for everything too! The first time this happened, we accepted it as a simple mistake. The second time this happened, we gave them the benefit of the doubt, maybe someone's just having an off day... But, after last night's fiasco, I think it's time we find a new place to patron. When we called the restaurant to let them know the sushi we had ordered, and paid for, was missing from our bag, the woman asked if we would come back to pick up the sushi. I told her, we didn't really have a choice, since we paid cash, she couldn't credit us back. So much for saving time, and now, doubling the cost of gas. To top it all off, when we got back to the restaurant, instead of an apology, or offering us something for our trouble and inconvenience, the woman was scolding us for not checking our order! When we told her, it was their job to make sure the order is complete before they bag it up and give it to us, she just yelled at us more... repeating that it is our job to check our order and our bags before we leave the restaurant! Wow, so much for customer service.\n\nSo, if you're up for the gamble of a hit-or-miss, and do decide to patron this place, stay alert and double check your bill.

In fact, the capers were a tell tale sign of reheating, they were shrunken and shriveled. The salmon that lay on top of the roll was dry and tasteless. My boyfriend and I were so offended by the quality of the food, we left a 6% tip or something equally atrocious. \n\nOn the bright side, I guess we'll never have to worry about finding parking in this area again.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

If a restaurant claims to be \"authentic (insert cuisine type) cuisine,\" then sure, I'll be pretty harsh when I critique it, or if it claims to make the best red velvet cake, then I will hold it to that standard. \n\nWhat I do not do, and what really grates on my nerves about a lot of the reviews written here, is assume that every Japanese or whatever type of ethnic restaurant will claim to be authentic. Kitaro does not in any way claim to be \"authentic Japanese cuisine,\" people. \n\nKitaro is being held to a standard that it never claimed to live up to. It is NOT a restaurant that should be compared with authentic udon or katsu shops like those in Japan, nor should it be compared to mom and pop Japanese sushi places in the U.S. that are so stringent about the quality of raw fish that they will have fresh fish shipped daily from Japan. Kitaro is run by a bunch of Chinese people who recognized what patrons wanted -- cheap, affordable sushi and Americanized sushi rolls as well as combination plates. If you don't want to enjoy the godzilla roll or the Mexican roll or any of the other specialty rolls that they offer here, then don't come here and complain about the food not being authentic, because they never claimed to be authentic! \n\nI don't understand how anyone could think that this place is not good for the money that they are paying to eat here for, nor do I understand how anyone would be ashamed to get a party platter or a specialty roll here. Keeping in mind that authenticity is not Kitaro's goal, I think that they make pretty damn good food, and it is obviously good and popular, otherwise why is the restaurant is always jam packed with a wait at almost all hours of the day? The amount of business that Kitaro gets speaks for itself. \n\n And in a time and day when there's a recession going on, and a lot of people can't afford $50-200/head for \"authentic\" sushi, haters are NOT appreciated. If you want to be snooty and assert that you know about what sushi or katsu really is, then go somewhere else and eat and be self-important.", "author": "Yvonne W."}

My parents, from who I've inherited my love for sashimi, agree that although it's not the freshest one can get, it's pretty close considering the establishment. \n\nI always ask what the freshest fish is that day, and that helps me narrow my choices.

After eating at several sushi joints, Kitaro doesn't have the creativity and originality in its sushi dishes. I didn't find much excitement in their menu selection and there wasn't anything in the menu that caught my eye or made my mouth water. Also, noticed that a lot of the rolls fell apart when I picked it up by my chopsticks plus the rice they used seemed dry...not sticky & fermented like it's supposed to.

I mean the menu itself should have been an indication of the quality but we were blinded by hunger. \n\n-My girlfriend got an ordinary lunch bento box, which wasn't terrible. California roll was decent, eel roll was eh, and the tempura roll was eh too. But for $8, it was filling and cheap.\n-I got some kind of spicy tuna roll and another fried spicy yellowtail roll. Both of them were terrible. The tuna was mushy and ground up into a mush of nastiness. Also, the tuna roll was cut into these awkward diagonal shapes, supposedly to exaggerate the meager amounts of tuna in the sushi. And then the fried roll was soggy and absolutely drenched in sauce, and served in a bowl. Did I order a sushi roll or a bowl of soup?\n-One more thing about the sushi. The tuna and yellowtail rolls were $5 and $4 respectively, which in my mind should have triggered an alarm of suspicion. Even at those prices, its not worth it. \n-I also ordered a tonkatsu-don. Pork fried cutlet with egg and rice. I was good but nothing special. And honestly, its pretty easy to make a decent tonkatsu. Only $6, so I guess it was worth it.\n\nAs they say, hunger is the best spice. Without it, this meal would have been disgusting and unsatisfying. I think you should avoid the sushi at Kitaro.

Probably not, but you're paying $2.50 for that Salmon Makimono so shut your mouth.  I have consistently enjoyed my meals here both dining in and taking out--a total of probably 20 times over the past two years.  They have the basic sushi fare of Rock N' Rolls (eel with avocado) and California Rolls, and also some other creations I enjoy, such as the Tiger Roll (tempura shrimp wrapped in seaweed, rice and alternating layers of avocado and eel).  Bottom line: you're not going to be blown away by creative culinary visions or artful food presentations, but you are definitely going to enjoy your food for what it is.\n\nENVIRONMENT/SERVICE: THREE STARS (* * *)\nThe environment is basic--no question--but at these prices, it's not much of a surprise.  Stark walls are interspersed with dusty old masks from what appears to be an elementary school project.  There is a \"second floor\" around 5 feet tall (viewable from the first floor) that holds a smattering of what seems like useless flotsam, contributing nothing to the decor.  The service is quick and to the point (the first visit to the table is usually accompanied with \"you know what you want?\").\n\nVALUE: FIVE STARS (* * * * *)\nIn terms of sushi, I have never seen such a good value.  Basic no-frills rolls start at $2.  More complicated fare involving several ingredients (avocado, green onions, etc) are slightly more, usually in the $3-5 range.  The most expensive rolls are around $8, and these include a lot of fish in them.  The menu offers many other items (seaweed salad for $4 and individual nigiri or sashimi) as well.  Make sure to bring a 15% off coupon which can be found on the back of Cala and Lucky receipts, among other places.\n\nAverage of\nFOOD: FOUR STARS\nENVIRONMENT/SERVICE: THREE STARS\nVALUE: FIVE STARS\n================\nAVERAGED GRAND TOTAL: FOUR STARS\n\nEstimated price per person (excluding drink):\n$9-12\n\nWould I recommend it to others?\nYes.\n\nWould I return?\nYes, time and again.", "author": "Benjamin L."}

Got there and was able to get a table but the madness has already descended. \n\nService was quick and precise if not overly friendly. So was the food. The best part was the Firecracker Sushi dish. It was lightly deep fried with a sauce that literally \"cracked\" in your mouth. The Spider Roll unfortunately wasn't as crunchy. The Surfer roll was basically a Gozilla not fried. We also shared a Bento box of Teriyaki salmon and vegetable tempura. They were both good. I was surprised that my Amaebi although fresh didn't come with the deep fried heads like most places. Since it was getting more crowded and the wait staff was zipping by at 100mph, I didn't have the courage to ask. It was nice to share a meal with a friend. We left a little after 7:30pm with bodies piled 5 deep at the door. It didn't help the weather outside felt like winter. It did keep the place hopping and warm.\n\nThe best part of Kitaro is the prices. The Firecracker dish was only $2.99!! That type of pricing is rare in the world of sushi and not to mention in San Francisco.\n\nMy suggestion is to go on a weekday at down time. Hopefully the service will be better and you can actually relax and enjoy the meal.", "author": "Margaret M."}

This is the place though to seek out fresh, cheap-ass discount sushi rolls if you are a student, low on funds, late on rent, are not pretentious, are not obsessed with genuine authenticity of Japanese cuisine for the sake of saving some cash for other things of value like beer and a movie and possible dinner tomorrow, or like me for computer repairs, utility bills, art supplies, etc. etc. This place will feed you well, If you cast aside your snotty attitude and notice how many Japanese students go here and do not mind it at all, how crowded it is every lunch time and night, and how actually fresh the rolls are. Yes, there is no need to even order Nigiri (note 3 and 4 dollar rolls and stick with them.) If you can despite all your bills afford something more, get Godzilla and Rainbow  rolls, and you will no go hungry. Hey, for these prices you can actually go home sated and not broke. \n\nGod knows I love me real kick-ass sushi. You can go to Shimo on Clement, and it will be amazing, authentic, it will blow your hair back, melt your faces, whatever good stuff is supposed to do. But this isn't upscale shit right here. Its affordable, its as Americanized as a Teriyaki burger or a Breakfast Burrito, but its as delicious if you only get down from your cloud and join the real world. When I went to college my friends were Japanese students who would take me here all the time. Yes, they would snicker at California Rolls, obviously, they don't have them in Japan, obviously, it's a shameful concept.... but we all were students, all were broke, and it was healthy, tasty, and cheap,   as are crepe stands in Japantown.  I lived in Richmond next to this place for seven years, and this year I am back living two blocks away from it again, and boy did I miss its simple charm. \n\nSo here, had to take a star off because it isn't a sushi place per se, but  otherwise, i have no problem with it at all.", "author": "Maria O."}

It was so bad that I didn't finish my tekka maki (which I ALWAYS finish).  \n\nOn top of that my soda was flat too.  I mean wtf, how can you have flat soda that came from a can?

BUT... if you want super cheap rolls that leave you satisfied, then it's definitely worth a try.\n\nThey have a huge list of rolls, and a wide variety of bento boxes as well.  I typically order the 49er, Kamikaze, and Alaskan.  The rolls here are huge and very very cheap, so 2 rolls are plenty for me!  The bento boxes are also very worth it and the chicken karaage is actually quite good.\n\nThe main reason why I come here is because it's CHEAP...and far better than shoving greasy fast food down my throat.", "author": "Mai S."}

I rarely go here anymore, but now I think of it as the place where the tea cups roam the table on their own.  Kinda spooky, but when the table is wet from all the tea I've spilled on the table, those tea cups slide across.  \n\nAnyway, I came recently and ordered the assorted sashimi and my husband ordered the assorted hamachi, plus the rock 'n roll and alaskan roll.  We thought the hamachi tasted pretty decent.  I love yellow tail.  Sure, it wasn't the greatest, but for the money, you get 8 hearty-sized pieces with a giant scoop of rice.  It's not the best quality, but I think at Kitaro, we go for quantity and not quality.  Come on people.  It's cheap eats.  As for the rest of my assorted sashimi - tuna, mackerel and salmon, well it wasn't as good as the hamachi.  Plus our extra rolls were full of rice.  I hate when they stuff you with rice.  My stomach just gets bloated.  \n\nI gave it a 4, but it's more like a 3 1/2.  As long as I don't get sick off the sashimi, for that price, it's good enough for me.", "author": "Stacey C."}

I normally stick to sushi rolls and occasionally sneak a bite quickstyl from the boyfriend's bento box. I regularly order the Pink Dragon, Tiger, Rock n' Roll and Surfer roll. I always avoid tempura since I'm not a big fan of the deep fried stuff and always find myself scrapping off as much of the batter as I can.\n\nFish obviously isn't 'fresh', service is quick, food is inexpensive, but don't expect super-duper-melt-in-your-mouth-and-knock-you-into-a-food-coma sushi. If you want that, go somewhere else. Only come here if you want cheap, decent, edible, fill-up-your-hunger sushi....or food.", "author": "Serena W."}

Kitaro makes it possible. They have everything that a good sushi restaurants offer, without the big price tag that comes along with it! Rolls, sashimi, bento boxes, udon, sake, beer, the whole she-bang (did I spell that right?)! They're usually very crowded since they're popular with the locals but they manage to squeeze people with not having to wait too long. If you have a big group, it's a different story though so come early.\n\nWhy do I give it a 4-star then? Because the key is \"good\" vs. \"great\" sushi. The sashimi is definitely not the catch of the day but they do taste delicious overall. Plus, at $6 for a Rainbow Roll, I'd say it's very reasonable.  \n\nRecommendation: Firecracker appetizers.

I tried Kitaro Sushi because my room mate had recommended it to my boyfriend and I. I had ordered the sushi TOGO which was a really good idea and from now on I will be ordering it to go. \n\nI give 3 stars because 2 stars go to food and the price. I love finding yummy sushi for a reasonable price. 1 star goes to the customer service. Although it was my first time actually being inside, it was the worst customer service I got from a Sushi Restaurant, well at least from the server I had. The other guy was nice and decent about saying hello, thank you, take your time. UNLIKE the other lady... UHM... yah thats why i would never eat inside. I think its wrong just to hand you the sushi rolls and place it on the table without telling you which is which. I mean i know i should know which is which by reading the details, but damn isnt that what servers are for? And they shouldnt be just slamming the plate on the table. GEES! and she never came to ask us if we were okay. And she seemed like she was in a rush all the time, PLUS they were not even busy. I know busy I use to work at a Restaurant. I never complain about customer service BUT this was the worst... So from now on, I am ordering the Sushi TO GO...

No matter where you go, no matter how good the spider roll, its not so great if it isnt hot... Also, the customer service was adequate. They brought us our food, but were not friendly at all.\n\nAll in all, pretty good sushi for the price, but I'm not sure we would go again. I am glad though, that there are places out there, affordable enough that no one has to go WITHOUT sushi.", "author": "Krista H."}

I never feel bad giving anyone here a good tip, especially when it's busy. I've been here during a crowded house and our food still came within 20 minutes.\n\nThe quality of the food is probably not the best for a sushi restaurant in San Francisco, but it's very inexpensive and some of the special rolls are quite creative. I recommend the godzilla roll, pink salmon roll, and especially the shrimp tempura rolls. Some of the non-sushi items are good as well, including the fried tofu appetizer, the tempura/sushi bento boxes for lunch, and especially the miso soup. Great job!", "author": "Conrad C."}

Really good affordable prices! food isn't especially extremely tasty but it's good enough for its price. $6 for a lunch special or rice, terriyaki, sushi, and salad? Score! Plenty enough to feed you for $5.95-$6. When most Japanese restaurants charge $7 for just plain california rolls. Also, kitaro always mails in coupons which makes things even cheaper than it already is. Sure the taste isn't extremely good, but it's satisfying enough. Most sushi rolls are under $5 which is also a good deal. One of the cheapest japanese restaurants I've been to so far. Dropped in once and now, its my go to japanese place. Aside from sushi boats though.  Atmosphere is warm, good. Nice medium sized place with pretty good service and quick food delivery.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-11", "description": "Kitaro is my favorite inexpensive Japanese/sushi restaurant around, but it definitely has its drawbacks.  I've been going for almost 7 years, and I still have yet to find a cheap place that beats it.\n\nKitaro is on Geary Street down by 20th...it's always a beast to find parking, but once that aggravating experience is over you get to wait (outside because they have no room inside) for a table...weekend nights are the worst, this place is always always always crowded (probably because the food is so cheap and decent).  You write your name on a list and they'll call you as soon as the table is available - what is most annoying is you have to have your entire party present before they seat you.  But once you are finally seated the evening will change for the better.  You've gotten all the negative experiences out of the way, bring on the tastiness!\n\nThis place has FAST service.  They depend on high turnaround, so they will serve you as quickly and efficiently as they can.  But you can take your time, they are quick without rushing you too badly.  The menu is extensive, with two large pages of hot food and bento boxes and two large pages of sushi rolls and also a page of specials.  They have great everything.  From the hot food items, their chicken or pork katsu are great, I looooove the sauces.  They also have a decent teryaki sauce, I like their salmon teryaki.  The dinners and bento boxes all come with miso soup, a salad, and loads of sticky rice.  For the bento boxes you can choose two main items from a list - and that includes sashimi!  I usually get a bento box with two of the four sashimi options - red tuna, salmon, albacore tuna, and yellowtail.  Their sashimi is really good grade, the fish melts in your mouth and has never had that iffy \"fishy\" taste - the fish is always super fresh and smooth.  A bento box will run you 9 - 14 bucks, that is damn cheap for the amount of food, we almost always have some leftovers.\n\nThe sushi here is awesome.  They have a roll for everyone...I especially like their Dynamite roll (spicy tuna roll that is deep fried and then has that  spicy red \"rooster\" sauce drizzled on top) and their Godzilla roll (tuna and crab roll also deep fried with a creamy wasabi sauce).  Try the lobster salad roll, you get two huge pieces of sushi heaped with delicious lobster in a creamy sauce with crab and shrimp meat, yum.  The firecrackers are also quite good, you get five pieces of deep fried yellowtail rolls that is covered with the katsu brown sauce and a zesty orange sauce.  Yum.  \n\nThey also cover all the basic rolls - shrimp tempura, rainbow roll, eel, soft crab, california roll, phillie roll (tuna with cream cheese), they even have two chicken rolls - baked, of course - available for those who don't really like raw fish but want to try sushi.   They also have nigiri and cut rolls - of the nigiri, the garlic albacore tuna is super.\n\nExpect ridiculously fast service - like I said, they depend on high turnaround since so many people generally like to eat here, so they will bring out your food asap.  Also expect to get a lot of good food for a little bit of money.  I'm pretty sure everything on the menu is under 16 bucks...and most of it is in the 9-12 dollar range.  The rolls are all under 9 bucks, I'm pretty sure most of them are around 6 dollars.  That is a good price these days when I see other sushi places serving a roll of eight pieces for like 14 bucks.  \n\nTry it for yourself - yes, there are way better sushi restaurants in the city - but do you really want to spend an arm and a leg for some raw fish and rice when you can get super tasty and good combinations for way less?  I ALMOST FORGOT!  If you shop at Safeway, check out the back of your receipt - Kitaro has 20% off coupons on the back of Safeway receipts, so your meal can be even cheaper!", "author": "Marie B."}

There was not much of a crowd so we had our pick of seating. I love sushi but was more in the mood for udon so I went ahead and ordered their chicken katsu curry udon lunch special, which was about $7. It was good but because half my mouth was numb from getting a cavity filled earlier in the day, I was not able to enjoy it as much as I would have liked. My friend ordered hamachi sashmi and three different rolls. I only tried one of her rolls but I really liked it and regretted ordering the special. The staff was very accommodating, especially with my friend's frequent requests. Our bill came out to be about $32, which was a bargain to me.

You might want to get there early on Fri. and Sat. nights, as there is usually a crowd and parking really sucks, but its totally worth it. I highly recommend the Firecracker roll and the Dynamite roll. They can be a bit spicy, but melt in your mouth. Amazing. And the mango mochi for dessert? Awesome. And hey, if you don't want to drive around looking for a spot all night, you can call in and get a to go order and just double park while you wait for it, so much easier.", "author": "Anastasia V."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-11-20", "description": "Kitaro is my favorite inexpensive Japanese/sushi restaurant around, but it definitely has its drawbacks.  \n\nKitaro is on Geary Street down by 20th...it's always a beast to find parking, but once that aggravating experience is over you get to wait (outside because they have no room inside) for a table...weekend nights are the worst, this place is always always always crowded (probably because the food is so cheap and decent).  You write your name on a list and they'll call you as soon as the table is available - what is most annoying is you have to have your entire party present before they seat you.  But once you are finally seated the evening will change for the better.  You've gotten all the negative experiences out of the way, bring on the tastiness!\n\nThis place has FAST service.  They depend on high turnaround, so they will serve you as quickly and efficiently as they can.  But you can take your time, they are quick without rushing you too badly.  The menu is extensive, with two large pages of hot food and bento boxes and two large pages of sushi rolls and also a page of specials.  They have great everything.  From the hot food items, their chicken or pork katsu are great, I looooove the sauces.  They also have a decent teryaki sauce, I like their salmon teryaki.  The dinners and bento boxes all come with miso soup, a salad, and loads of sticky rice.  For the bento boxes you can choose two main items from a list - and that includes sashimi!  I usually get a bento box with two of the four sashimi options - red tuna, salmon, albacore tuna, and yellowtail.  Their sashimi is really good grade, the fish melts in your mouth and has never had that iffy \"fishy\" taste - the fish is always super fresh and smooth.  A bento box will run you 9 - 14 bucks, that is damn cheap for the amount of food, we almost always have some leftovers.\n\nThe sushi here is awesome.  They have a roll for everyone...I especially like their Dynamite roll (spicy tuna roll that is deep fried and then has that  spicy red \"rooster\" sauce drizzled on top) and their Godzilla roll (tuna and crab roll also deep fried with a creamy wasabi sauce).  Try the lobster salad roll, you get two huge pieces of sushi heaped with delicious lobster in a creamy sauce with crab and shrimp meat, yum.  The firecrackers are also quite good, you get five pieces of deep fried yellowtail rolls that is covered with the katsu brown sauce and a zesty orange sauce.  Yum.  \n\nThey also cover all the basic rolls - shrimp tempura, rainbow roll, eel, soft crab, california roll, phillie roll (tuna with cream cheese), they even have two chicken rolls - baked, of course - available for those who don't really like raw fish but want to try sushi.   They also have nigiri and cut rolls - of the nigiri, the garlic albacore tuna is super.\n\nExpect ridiculously fast service - like I said, they depend on high turnaround since so many people generally like to eat here, so they will bring out your food asap.  Also expect to get a lot of good food for a little bit of money.  I'm pretty sure everything on the menu is under 16 bucks...and most of it is in the 9-12 dollar range.  The rolls are all under 9 bucks, I'm pretty sure most of them are around 6 dollars.  That is a good price these days when I see other sushi places serving a roll of eight pieces for like 14 bucks.  \n\nTry it for yourself - yes, there are way better sushi restaurants in the city - but do you really want to spend an arm and a leg for some raw fish and rice when you can get super tasty and good combinations for way less?  I ALMOST FORGOT!  If you shop at Safeway, check out the back of your receipt - Kitaro has 20% off coupons on the back of Safeway receipts, so your meal can be even cheaper!", "author": "Marie R."}

I remember the karaage used to be pretty good so I chose that. And it still is pretty good. One of the best compared to most mid-price Japanese restaurants. The tonkatsu, however, is a little dry and I could have done without it. The salad was a little bland/bitter.\n\nNow onto the rolls. We ordered the Kamakaze, Philly, Alaskan and Tekka roll.

I'm not super adventurous when it comes to sushi, but I love spicy tuna and I think it's pretty darn good at Kitaro (nothing in the roll but the fatty tuna)...definitely gives me my sushi fix (for $2.99--good grief!).  I also enjoy the 49er roll (more spicy tuna!).  And, like others have said, I love their tempura...for the carnivores, their steak teriyaki is definitely worth trying.  And, I know the place is already cheap enough, but you can always get a coupon off of their website (or check the back of your Safeway receipt!).  Negatives--parking can be difficult (take-out is great), and I would NOT recommend their chicken udon (go with tempura, or go somewhere else for noodles).", "author": "Joyce L."}

Quantity and quality used to be close to 5 stars, but has dramatically decline in recent years. I am sad to give it three stars, but I've been disappointed with Kitaro more than a handful of times in the last 4 years. The fish doesn't taste as fresh as it used to. Instead, there's an iciness to the fish (overly icy where you'd crunch on it) leaving me to think that it has been frozen for a while. The rolls are still good, but not as stellar as it used to be.

I didn't know what I wanted yet and the waitress literally stared at me for two minutes while I made up my mind.  It was really awkward and I felt really pressured to order as soon as possible.  The food came around pretty fast as well, but I felt like something was missing.  I ordered a chicken teriyaki dinner and an assorted sashimi dinner to go, both of which come with rice, salad, and soup.  When I got home, I noticed that the soup was missing, which is a huge bummer because I ordered for my grandmother and she likes soup a lot (must be an old person thing; I don't know).   I called to ask them if I could just swing by and pick up two orders of soup, and the lady said that to go orders don't come with it, even though the menu online and the takeout menu at the restaurant both say that the dinners come with rice, salad, and soup.  I could understand if somewhere on the menu it stated that soup wasn't included and I was in the wrong here, but it doesn't say that anywhere.  Such a disappointment.  I would not come back here.  The food was just okay, and the lady on the phone made no effort to ameliorate the situation when I was clearly disappointed.", "author": "k h."}

I ordered their so-called \"vegetable udon\" which is supposed to be plain udon with vegetable tempura.  However, when my food came, it was a bowl of udon with what looked like an orgy of leftover vegetables from earlier in the week.  I also ordered a spicy chicken roll which was ok.\n\nMy friends both ordered a rainbow roll which is supposed to come with different fish pieces as well as one avacado piece.  It didn't come with all the kinds of fish as described in their menu.  They left out the unagi and avacado pieces.  The only reasonable explanation for this is the same as my vegetable udon: they wanted to get rid of the fish from the beginning of the week.\n\nSo to sum it up in one simple sentence: They ripped us off.  I asked one of the waiters and they told me in a very rude tone that there was nothing wrong with our orders.\n\nThis place used to be good;  now they just don't really care about the customers since people will come here anyway.", "author": "Jeffrey L."}

The sushi is slapped together into a mish-mash that barely holds together. The words \"cheap\" and \"sushi\" probably shouldn't be used in the same sentence. People rave about the freshness. It's fresh because there's high turn over from the crowds of teenagers who haunt the place. Remember: fresh does not necessarily equal tasty.\n\nFor the more sophisticated, I would highly recommend Tanuki down the street (6th & California). It's reasonably priced and the sushi chefs are very inventive. Kitaro is not a bargain if you end up not enjoying what you eat!\n\nNote: I did go back and try the Sushi. Yuk!

One thing I hate is that your whole party has to be there in order to be seated even if it's a party of 10 and you're short 1 person, they won't seat you. It's a decent sushi place with a good variety to choose from whether you're craving sushi, udon, tempura, or their dinner box specials. Their sashimi isn't the freshest I've had, but for the prices they charge, it's reasonable. I always thought it was funny they have small signs posted that say you shouldn't eat the same fish too often because of mercury or whatever. I guess they are required to have those signs. Anyways, my favorite thing is getting the chicken teriyaki for lunch since it's the same portion as dinner but cost less for lunch. Also love their dynamite, godzilla, and fire cracker rolls. The dressing for their salad is awesome too. Great place for casual sushi dining at decent prices. Usually pretty fast service although not the most attentive. It's located on a busy street with tons of other restaurants so parking is usually bad especially on weekend nights, but I think it's worth the 20 mins of circling around looking for parking.

It arrived as a very crude looking, loosely packed rice roll with large chunks of fish on top that were barely cut.  The whole thing fell apart when I tried to remove one piece. The fish was okay. I didn't plan to return.\nI did go back. About 3 months or so ago. Must've been a different sushi chef. Ordered a rainbow roll to go. That sucker filled a small plastic clamshell to-go container! And with tax it was barely $7! AND it looked waayyyyy nicer than the first time. Like a regualr sushi roll from a \"full price\" restaurant!  AND it tasted good! Hurray!  Definitely would go back.\nWent back last week. Yep, rainbow roll. With new SF tax, it's now $7.22 total. Still filled up clamshell container, looked good. Tasted okay. Not nearly as good as second time. The fish was warm, which kinda creeped me out. Since time elapsed between pick up and destination was 10 minutes, walking outside on a cold day, it must've been warm at restaurant.  I didn't get sick, so I guess it was okay. \nI'd go back.

But a few years later when they moved to the current location, things went downhill very fast.  The quality of food and service took a nosedive.  Where there was somewhat of an authentic or at least a homey feel before, it is now too mainstream and too much cost cutting to keep up with the new rent.  While most sushi places use imitation crab, Kitaro uses the kind that is obviously fake...you know, the chunky kind with the red tips.  Anytime I see a sushi place using that kind, I stay far far away.  The last straw was when I ordered some rolls to-go and instead of giving me extra soy sauce packets, they charged me .10 each when I asked.  Pretty lame if you ask me.  Needless to say I haven't been here since.  The place at the corner with the boats is much better...and that isn't saying much.", "author": "O'Shea J."}
