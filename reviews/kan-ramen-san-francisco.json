What I like most about this joint is that you could find no frills, yet delicious ramen for an affordable price compared to the places in the city now that a basic bowl of ramen is about $15. They have a staple three options (shoyu, miso, tonkotsu) for broth base that all come with thick pieces of chashu, menma, wood ear mushroom, spinach and half an egg for 9.95. Their portions are standard for what you would expect at a ramen restaurant. They have one special which is their garlic tonkotsu ramen for 14.95, which still isn't bad considering the price point of what ramen is expected to be in the city and they have alternate, cheaper options.\n\nNo wait when I came here on a weekday evening, which I think is great as most ramen restaurants have up to an hour wait especially when really popular. I would definitely suggest checking out this place if you're craving ramen and in the area.", "author": "Kathleen S."}

We came here during Lunar New Year's as originally we were looking for Chinese food, but it seemed like everyone was pretty much booked. We went through a couple of Chinese restaurants and upon learning that there was no seating, I checked Yelp and walked around the corner and we stumbled upon here...where there was no one. Good or bad?\n\nWell, when we got seated (table of 8) we were handed the menus promptly and since it's a new thing to ask the waiters if we could split the checks...the waiter responded that it would be no problem. (Since when was splitting checks a bad thing?!)  And don't worry, people started coming in after we were seated.\n\nAnyways I ordered for appetizer (for myself) the Gyoza, and the Chicken Kara-age. I followed up the appetizer with the final meal of the Black Garlic Ramen.\n\nOverall, it was okay. As I said earlier, this review might be a little biased. The Gyoza and Chicken Kara-age was good. The gyoza wasn't stuffed fully, but it definitely had a good amount of filling and the chicken kara-age was crispy delightful when you bit down into it.  For the ramen, I thought the broth was a little weak for my taste. There was only a couple of black garlic cloves in the bowl which to me lacked for the flavor of the black garlic. Or, maybe my taste buds aren't that great when it comes to ramen. I thought overall it was pretty good, especially for the price and where it's located.", "author": "Bruce K."}

The spice is real, don't underestimate it. The ramen came with pork AND duck breast - sooo good. The restaurant was clean and modern and service was good.

On a cold day, you just need a rich bowl of broth, flesh with noodles and slices of slow-cooked meat. Yeah, yeah, it's July, but have you felt how chilly wind can get around here?\n\nI intended to go to Sam Wo in Chinatown for dinner with a friend, but that plan fell through when we realized they were closed on Sundays. We didn't wander far until we got to Kan Ramen, which was sparsely populated (probably should have listened to that warning sign). We were seated quickly and the waitress didn't delay in taking our orders. You don't have to ask for a glass of water; they'll provide it. They're also prompt with the refills, and leave you alone to enjoy your meal in peace. My friend and I spent an hour catching up as we ate, overstaying our welcome for a solid half an hour after the bowls were cleared, and they left the check as a hint to get out.\n\nIf it weren't for the company, I wouldn't have minded heading out early. I thought the black garlic ramen ($14.95) was lacking for what it was. Two slices of seared duck breast and two slices of char siu? Eh, could've given me a little bit more for that price. Duck was over-peppered but tender, while the char siu had the same flavor as the soup. Black garlic was just strange -- there were whole cloves of it, meaning all the flavor came through in a single bite. There were a few drops of black garlic oil, and it didn't taste like much. In fact, the whole bowl of soup lacked a flavor other than salty. There was no depth expected of broth that's been simmering for hours.\n\nSaving graces: bowl was massive, noodles were fine, seaweed and spinach were properly portioned. Some of the appetizers sounded tasty but weren't popular, considering that only one table in the whole restaurant had ordered anything off of that part of the small menu. CNN played in the background as a nice reminder that you shouldn't tune out from the news, even when you want to relax.", "author": "Gwen W."}

I ordered the night's specialty add-in of steak.  The steak was perfectly prepared - just pink enough to be delicious if you ate it quickly enough before the broth finished cooking it.  There weren't nearly enough noodles, but I stole some from the friend I was dining with (who seemed to have way more than I did).    The bamboo shoots evened out the bitterness of the spinach, and the black garlic was just...there.   The Diet Coke was served by the can, which is always annoying if you want a bit more beverage.\n\nService was friendly, but not terribly attentive given how quiet it was.

Based on the reviews, a lot of yelpers ordered the black garlic ramen but the idea of duck meat wasn't at all appealing to my husband and I. \n\nWe both ordered the tonkotsu ramen, mildly spicy for me and medium spicy for him. First of all, there wasn't enough broth for the noodles. I found myself pacing the amount of broth to my noodles so I don't run out. And it had spinach. I've never had spinach in my ramen before. It isn't a vegetable common to this dish. The pork Chasu wasn't that tender. The noodles were too chewy as if they weren't simmered long enough and seemed a step before al dente. While it wasn't inedible it was very standard and I wouldn't make a trek to come here again. I've eaten at Ippudo in Manhattan, NY and Kitakata Ramen Ban Nai in Costa Mesa, Ca so excuse my tastebuds because those two places alone have set the bar high for what I'm used to when eating ramen.  The mild was also pretty spicy. I should have ordered it with no spice at all. My husband said his medium was more like hot spicy. \n\nWe also ordered the chicken kara age and this was lightly battered and tasted like chicken breast meat was used served with one slice of lemon and a mayo dipping sauce on the side. This appetizer was delicious and I enjoyed it more than my ramen. \n \nThe server was fine enough. She refilled our hot tea. But she gave us two sets of thin napkins and took away our bowls with leftover broth without asking if we were done with it.  Then to top it off, she split our check without asking us. We ended up having to use the card twice to pay. I was slightly annoyed she assumed we were paying separately. It wasn't really busy at all and she seemed to be moving slowly.  I am pretty understanding because I have been in the restaurant before, but this server seemed to lack some skills common to serve in anticipating a guest's needs. She should have assumed we would need more napkins and asked about the rest. I probably won't be going out of my way to eat here, the next time I'm in San Francisco.

The atmosphere is very laid back and calming as I welcomed there. The concept is much original compared to your local Japanese Ramen restaurants across the United States although inside while I entered, it's much dark in daylight filled with low light settings across the whole room.\n\nThe employees here from servers and cookers are doing a good job for making the customers like me a spectacular service! No cons at all.\n\nNow onto the food! I ordered the Beef Udon Noodle Soup which it includes thin sliced beef, onions, a tofu, shittake mushroom, soft boiled marinated egg, napa cabbages, green onions and whole wheat udon noodles in Beef Udon broth. As I ate it, that beef udon noodle soup tasted very good! I can feel the flavors for both basic ingredients of toppings and beef udon broth combined, and it blended perfectly in a perfect harmony. The udon is much fresh and eatable to bite which I'm very satisfied about it. Not a bad meal at all for an early dinner!\n\nParking at Kan Ramen can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface street metered parking nor the parking garage available. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, Kan Ramen is the most amazing and incredible local Japanese Ramen restaurant that I've ever discovered for the very first time.

You can tell it's just a business and they aren't very passionate about getting ramen 'right'. It feels like they could just as easily be selling postcards or office supplies or poke bowls or boba tea instead. On a small college campus, this would be considered the best thing in town.\n\nThe tonkatsu broth is good but average, like it could've come from a can. The noodles are standard store-bought. The udons are a mess of inauthentic ingredients my own Chinese mom would use, which is not bad, per se, but it's definitely more southern Chinese grandma homecooking rather than well-researched professional stuff. That's fine! $9.95 a bowl is still a good 1/3 cheaper than most ramen. I'd say their price is the main draw - that and it's competently made. The waitstaff is super slow here.

They were crispy and served hot with a nice aioli dipping sauce.  The only drawback was the crisp part outshined any meat taste.  I took half of my order home as I wanted to save my appetite for my main.  The  roast beef ramen (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=5Me2Ji0kh4w9aBdMlVHS-w&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) which I added corn was served in an interesting bowl, wider than it was deep.  Given an option on the spiciness of the broth, I chose the second highest degree which is spicy.  The zing seems to come from white pepper that was likely added to the broth.  The beef was tender though cooked medium rather than the ad's pictured medium rare.  With the add on, my meal was around $25.00 but that includes my leftover karaage.\n\nThe restaurant has about ten tables so large parties should make reservations.  Dining solo, I was seated at the front corner table away from the door... made me think of \"Dirty Dancing\"... nobody seats baby in the corner.  There were three occupied tables when I arrived and a couple larger parties of four and eight came just before I left.

It's a small place with no frills but the service is nice and there's a lot of items on the menu.\n\nI came here with a party of five and we all got some appetizers to share to start. The gyoza was tasty and fried just right, but they only give you four pieces per order. The chicken karaage was good too although the skin was more like katsu skin. The edamame was adequately salted and plentiful.\n\nWe all got the black garlic ramen because we couldn't resist. It was indeed very good. The broth was a tonkotsu style broth (very creamy) and very salty. But the flavors were very rich. I got the mild spicy and I was already dying, so I can only imagine the medium and hot to be out of my league. It was about $15 for this bowl, and they give you lots of meat and veggies. They even have sliced duck, which was delicious. I thought the pork chashu was okay.\n\nI should take my ramen loving friends here to see what they think. I have been generally disappointed with ramen in the Bay, so this was a nice find.", "author": "Danielle C."}

It's not very traditional to have duck in ramen, but seriously I don't care. Duck is good. Soft boiled egg was good, not perfect, but good. Chashu is decent, broth is just ok, ramen noodles are fine, and ramen is expensive as hell. So why the 4-star rating? Obviously it was the duck.\nI would definitely come back again, but it's hard to justify around $20 for a bowl of ramen after tip and tax. I'll probably have to skip or bring lunch from home one day, just so I can have another one of these duck ramen!\n\nI had the regular tonkotsu ramen before and it didn't stand out that much, but still beats non-ramen specialty Japanese restaurants.", "author": "Mike O."}

On the border of Chinatown & North Beach, this joint serves up ramen that is just ok.  It's decent compared to nearby restaurants, but its ramen is no star among ramen.\n\nBlack Garlic Ramen: I was really looking forward to this because I love tonkotsu broth and I like black garlic.  Unfortunately, this was just ok.  The broth was cloudy looking, but didn't have that super rich pork bone flavor.  The black garlic was essentially three 3 whole cloves of fermented garlic thrown in the soup.  That created for some really intense and unbalanced bites.  Most places which serve black garlic wisely add it as a mince, pur\u00e9e or sauce so it gets evenly distributed.  The roast pork was standard.  The boiled egg had that nice semi-runny yolk.  The duck breast pieces were a little too rare and chewy.  I feel like in a soup, roast duck would work better.  Noodles were fine.  Portion seemed large.\n\nChicken Kara-age: Perfectly crispy chunks of breast meat.  A tasty spicy mayo dipping sauce.  Definitely a nice way to whet your appetite.", "author": "Adam B."}

We walked into a dark and empty dining room before noontime. Did someone forget to pay the electricity bill? \n\nWe sat down and perused the menu of 4 ramen: Tonkotsu, Miso, Shoyu, and Black Garlic and choose to go with the Tonkotsu Ramen ($11) with an added marinated soft boiled egg (ajitsuke tamago) for an additional $1.75 (typo on menu states $3.75). If you're not in the mood for ramen, they also have udon, curry, and katsu rice with the typical Japanese apps: edamame, wakame, gyoza, karaage, and tempura. I liked that they highlighted the \"O\" in Tonkotsu since it's often misspelled as \"Tonkatsu\", the fried pork cutlet. Cc's accepted.\n\nThere was a language barrier (non-Japanese owned) as I wanted to confirm that they didn't use msg in their broth. I asked three times and even in Cantonese but the waitress gave me a blank stare. I asked if she can ask someone in the kitchen and she gave me a blank stare. Ok, nevermind...I guess, I'll find out sooner than later.\n\nTonkotsu Ramen w/ chashu, hard-boiled egg, spinach, lotus root, kikurage mushrooms, bamboo shoot ($11 + $1.75 ajitsuke tamago): http://bit.ly/1ZdgWQK.\n\nThe highlight was the chashu which was melt-in-your-mouth tender but one slice was thickly cut while the other was half the thickness. The noodles were mushy and definitely from a package as I saw one of the cooks in the kitchen separating the strands so they wouldn't clump when cooking. The tonkotsu broth was porky and salty but missing that creamy depth of flavor. They should just do away with the plain boiled egg and replace it with half a marinated boiled egg which had a savory sweet molten center. \n\nMy friend thought the ramen was good but isn't picky. This is a guy who says, he wouldn't mind having his bachelor's party at Denny's.\n\nAside from the language barrier, service was quick and cordial. \n\nI know ambiance is often an afterthought in Asian restaurants but they should turn on the lights and add some background music. It was pretty much crickets until another couple arrived who also commented at how dark it was inside. \n\nParking is ridiculous because it's in Northbeach/Chinatown and this is by no means a destination restaurant. It's best suited for those who work around the Transamerica Pyramid.  \n\nFriend who demolished all the dim sum at lunch, also demolished the bowl of ramen here. \n\nMe: \"I thought you were full?\"\nFriend: \"Gotta work on that pregnant troll figure!\"", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The lunch menu is pretty sparse; there are three ramen choices (tonkotsu, miso and shoyu) and a list of add-ons (extra noodles, extra egg, etc). There were some non-ramen dishes on the back of the menu but that was about it. \n\nI chose the miso ramen, medium spice, with an extra egg. My friend ordered the tonkotsu. My ramen was SO delicious. The noodles were perfectly al dente, the broth is very flavorful, and the eggs were seriously cooked to perfection. I slurped up every last drop. The pork is tender, not too fatty, and there's just the right about of veggies. My friend's tonkotsu was a bit lackluster; the broth definitely needed a bit more flavor. \n\nThe atmosphere is average, but pleasant.

The price is indeed very questionable. But the key ingredients were solid. And the soup was very creamy and the garlic flavor was not too overpowering.  No mint was needed after eating this unique bowl of soup. \n\nI forgot to mention on my Quick tip. The newest ramen place does not serve hot tea yet.

Broth was creamy, flavorful and salty (not unbearably salty though). Noodles were perfectly cooked - springy with a bounce. I was very satisfied with the copious amount of toppings, in which all were delicious! Chasu was tender and tasty.. I was honestly impressed with this. The only downside would be the half boiled egg, which was a bit overcooked in all of the bowls at our table (however that doesn't seem to be a problem for others, so maybe it was just a minor hiccup). Other toppings include kikurage mushrooms, a lotus root, bamboo shoots, spinach and green onions! \n\n*Don't forget!!!! If you like your ramen spicy or with a little heat, ask for their house made chili sauce! It was served in a tiny tub on the side, which was great since I could control how much or how little I would add to my bowl. Their chili sauce is delicious... a little garlicky, tangy and of course... spicy! I thoroughly enjoyed adding a good amount of it to mine! \n\nWe also ordered the karubuto squash tempura, which had a lovely crispy exterior and a soft interior from the squash. We all loved this.\n\nPersonally, I was a little bummed that their black garlic ramen is $17! Once I heard they offered this, I knew that was the bowl I was going to order. After finding out it was $17, I quickly changed my mind to the regular tonkotsu instead.. ($11).

I was definitely stuffed at the end. The broth was pretty good, not the best I've had, but it had good enough flavors and the shoyu ramen was just right for shoyu ramen. I like the inclusion of spinach, something that you rarely see in Japan or any ramen restaurant unless you're in the bay I guess. It's good to know that if you want something healthy in your ramen, you can eat the spinach :P The char siu isn't as soft and tender but it's still pretty good, and the soft boiled egg is boiled to perfection. Just gotta love that egg yolk. Not a fan of the bamboo, which tasted weird even for out of a can.\nGotta say, it was probably one of the few bowls of ramen that didn't disappoint me in the bay. It's not the best, but it would definitely hit that ramen craving and at a fair price for ramen places in the city.", "author": "Jenn T."}

Broth was well seasoned and rich, but not incredibly fatty. I got their signature black garlic ramen, which came with duck and pork chasu. Their egg yolk had a great creamy texture, not at all one of those sad overboiled eggs. Lots of included fixings such as wood ear mushrooms and bamboo. Quite delightful. Best part? No ridiculous line. In and out and off to eat more.", "author": "Minh N."}

Totally underwhelmed at Kan Ramen - the noodles weren't fresh and it seemed like it came from a frozen bag from a non-Japanese supermarket.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-11", "description": "It took me a while to try Kan Ramen, partly because there isn't a lot of hype around it (unlike Mensho and Nojo) and the Yelp reviews aren't amazing. I'm glad my boyfriend and I decided to go on a random Saturday because it was surprisingly tasty! It's not world-acclaimed ramen but definitely hits the spot. \nI got the extra spicy tonkotsu ramen and the bf got the black garlic ramen. The black garlic ramen is priced at $14.95 on the lunch menu (not sure if it's still $17 at dinner) but for the extra $5 they give you another half shoyu egg and two slices of duck. My broth was perfectly creamy, not too thick or salty, and the runny, smooth shoyu egg was to die for. The noodles were pretty standard but cooked well and the chashu was very tender. The extra spicy spiciness level was good enough for someone looking forward to the rest of their day.\nHonestly, I would have a hard time choosing between Kan Ramen and Underground Ramen, which is also really good but kind of overrated. Definitely putting this on the lazy weekend lunch rotation!", "author": "Katie M."}

That's not necessarily an indictment, but it's not quite the same as the actual Japanese version:\n* Noodles were uninspired. I don't think they're made in-house\n* Duck Char Siu is just not good, and overly rubbery\n* The black garlic ramen has a few cloves of blackened garlic in it, not the pool of liquefied garlic as one would expect\n* Broth was good, but it missing something that really diminishes the richness\n\nAt the end of the day, this place scratched the itch, but only a little.", "author": "Andy M."}

We were greeted and promptly by a sweet woman who offered that we sit wherever we like. She immediately asked if we would like hot green tea (which was free), I presume because it was very chilly on the night we were there. We both ordered the Tonkatsu (pork) ramen and gyoza. The gyoza came out with a nice crisp and tender skin, the pork filling was very good. Then came the ramen. The ramen came with spinach, soft boiled egg, pork. The broth was milky and delicious, the noodles were cooked perfectly. There were other people in the restaurant but the atmosphere was nice and quiet overall (which we prefer). \nWe chose this restaurant due to great reviews and easy walking distance from our hotel (Hilton).

The topknots broth at Kan Ramen is indeed good.  I think it is actually boiled with the pork for about 16 hours or so.  The pork chasu is very tender and tasty as well.  My complaints are the noodles and egg.  The noodles looked and tasted like the instant noodles you buy in the packages.  There were not dense and chewy like they are in Japan.  Also, the egg that is included is half a very bland hard boiled egg.  To get the marinated soft boiled egg, which comes standard (especially in Japan) they charge a whopping $3.75 which brings a bowl of ramen to nearly $14.00", "author": "Max G."}
