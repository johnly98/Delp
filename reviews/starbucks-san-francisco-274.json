I'm so glad we found it in the dark! lol Yay for being opened early this weekend morning. Otherwise we would have had to change our plans. \n\nNF PSL was great. I really should have ordered a medium sized one though. Small was way too tiny!!!\n\nThank goodness for clean washrooms. Parking is at a disadvantage here though but we were fortunate to find street parking. One could even walk from the Palace of Fine Arts. That's walkable too! Yay bucket list completed! Actually several! Woot woot!", "author": "Karen K."}

Despite the fact it is not a Reserve location, I still like it. Starbucks are 2 kinds: Starbucks or Starbucks Reserve. Reserve locations are the fancy ones and they have stuff I really like. Like the Jamaican, Ethiopian, Sumatran roasts and other selections.  \n\nI saw many negative reviews about this place judging from one time encounter for the most part. If I were a business owner, I would freak out!. Even if you create the ideal perfect business in the cosmos, there will be still whining negatively-charged snappy people complaining and giving bad ratings. It's inevitable. \n\nIf you're local, you won't appreciate it. I'm an ex-citizen of SF and I respect the beauty of this location. I mean look, this Starbucks is the closest SB to the Golden Gate Bridge, the most handsome bridge in the world. Walking 2 miles from this SB to the red bridge is one of the best things you can do in SF (after eating Chinese chicken wings at San Tung). It's located at the entrance of the Presidio, the gorgeous green hilly hippie ultimate recreation hub national park in a city setting I know of. And it's next door to The Palace of Fine Art. And it has a Yoda fountain in its front yard. And and and. What else do you want!! Even if those baristas are 5-10 minutes late to give you your coffee, just go out and breathe some fresh Pacific air mixed with eucalyptus trees fragrance rather than being pissed. Yes, their staff were sometimes snippy and snooty but you're in SF, man! I mean even the homeless guys at GGP can be snobs. It is awesome to have friendly baristas. A smile can make someone's day. But whatever man! I used to study for my board exam here. So I came here probably more than 60-70 times! And to date, I still stop here almost every time checking in SF.\n\n\nTry the Milan-inspired CORDUSIO drink. It's a little bit amazing!! I usually get boring black coffee medium-dark roast. But this Cordusio is really good. It's espresso mocha.\n\n\n\n\n\n.", "author": "Ahmad A."}

I was very surprised to find out when you Yelp \"Starbucks in San Francisco\" this particular location comes up as number 83! Granted it is not in a particularly high traffic area and it is a bit hidden in that you have to know about the location ! But it is in the most beautiful surroundings of any  Starbucks to which I have ever been. Smack dab in the Presidio bordering the Marina District of SF. Think beautiful water features, lots of trees, greenery... nothing short of feeling like you have been transported to a Zen meditation retreat! I could also describe it as a very, very mini Japanese Tea Garden feel (without the admission fee) if you have ever visited that beautiful place in San Francisco.  I am usually here on weekends so the hustle and bustle of the 8 to 5 work routine is nonexistent. I read a lot of the Yelp reviewers make note of the high volume traffic at this Starbucks during work hours... Monday through Friday. And I surmise from that, and their one star reviews, that it can get pretty ugly :-) ..lots of people wanting their coffee with stressed out Baristas. So my solid 5-star review is based on visiting this particular Starbucks during weekends and holidays.\n\nIf you find yourself wandering around the Marina District near the Palace of Fine Arts and you want a quiet moment and a cup of coffee ... treat yourself with this beautiful park-like setting.  Dog friendly and kid friendly ....both the Starbucks and the park :-). You can enjoy the Starbucks' outside or indoor seating but I prefer to wander the park and find a bench where I can bask in nature and the beauty of it all.  \n\nAlso noteworthy... the restrooms in the Starbucks' building are really, really nice!!! And no codes....you don't even have to enter the Starbucks to use the restrooms (men and women).... shhh...secret!", "author": "Lizz Z."}

The staff only gave us one so I figure he was too busy I can just grab an empty cup from the no line register and even hand it up as asking for it and intended to share the tab water with my friend. Another staff - Jenn yelled at me \"you're not supposed to do that, can't just grab a cup. Your guy asked for a water only\" and gave me a dirty look.

An open secret among locals, you might never think to look for one in this spot, a converted military complex amid the sprawling Presidio, now housing Lucas digital media wizardry among other things.  There's no big green Starbucks sign, just a couple normal signs with arrows directing you to building A, B, C, D -- or Starbucks.  Tell the parking attendant at the gate that's why you're here.\n\nLook for the Yoda fountain to the left of the entrance.  The Force Awakens here -- with the help of a double or quad espresso.  Take your selfie before heading to the rear of the building where coffee awaits.\n\nGrab a rare outdoor table if it's a rare warm sunny day.

Pro tip:  It's not a bad walk (less than a mile, easy downhill) down the path to the beach at Crissy Field.\n\nAlso, it's a Starbucks, with all that entails.  With parking.  In San Francisco.

What is there to write about?\" Challenge accepted. :-)\n\nI'm anti Starbucks. Though throughout the years of travel abroad, Starbucks became so ubiquitous that you start to use it as a refuge when you are homesick.  In addition,every conference you go to they give you a gift certificate of $5 Starbucks card. So you keep on reminding yourself that you must use them but you can't bring yourself to a Starbucks. \n\nThus, this is a rare occasion to sing praises of this coffee giant based in Seattle. It's the location that made the difference. \n\nPark on Broadway, skip the Lyon Street Stairs, walk through the Presidio, and you are at this Starbucks in less than half an mile. More ambitious walkers / runners should start from Golden Gate Park, then pass through the chaotic Clement and then enter on the side of on 9th and Lake into the Presidio, then continue on down through Presidio and you end up near Lombard and Legion of Honor. A great route. Except one should always plan for a pit stop. Enter this Starbucks. It's strategically located. You can get a bathroom break, free wifi and coffee and things before completing your running/walking route. Take a look at this Building C while at it. Every firm inside of this building seems to be a private equity firm. Interesting. Long table is excellent for doing your scavenger hunt strategy session.  We were on foot and did not know what it was. It was the annual play-dash day. It started there. There were two teams of five occupying the long table. The game went all the way to Marina Green.  I ended up chatting up with that organizer who choose this very Starbucks as the beginning of the route. He also ended it there as well. \n\nThe building is very airy and warm, it faces a huge green lawn, and it felt like you are out and about (which you are until that very moment of coming inside of Building C) and so close to the nature. When did Presidio go upscale? Always living in the shadow of the GGP, it's so very much under appreciated. Now, you don't have to worry about that bathroom break you've been dreading about any more. While at it, get yourself a cup of Americano before you head to Crissy Fields. It gets windy. You will need a warm drink on hand. \n\nI never saw the Yoda statue but there was a statue of Philo T. Farnsworth, aka the guy who invented TV right next to it,  this particular statue in the Presidio by the Starbucks garnished a nice review on NYT three years back. Don't miss it. \n\nAn added bonus. A great date place. There is a man made pond just down the green lawn. Grab your coffee and things, head to the pond, watch the duckies, and then sit on the bench while holding hands, admiring the pink spring flowers in bloom on the tall branches. You are almost always alone, and it's almost guaranteed to be romantic. All that for just $3 / cup of coffee. \n\nYou may actually grow to like Starbucks.", "author": "Victoria E."}

The preserved military homes and office buildings add nostalgic nuances of American history. \n\nGrab a coffee you can count on from Starbucks and enjoy inside or outside seating options with many places to explore if you want to keep your date active. \n\nThe reason I love it for a first date is because there is ample free-parking options, the baristas are always nice, the service is quick, and the bathrooms are spacious and clean. \n\nBut there's much more to it than just that. The park's oversized evergreen trees help maintain a crisp freshness in the air, guaranteed to keep your date alert and energized. \n\nExploring the Presidio's lush greenery, serene stone ponds, and woodsy hiking trails stimulates endorphins and escalates pair bonding. \n\nBeing in nature engages the senses which helps to replace logic with emotion, a major factor in creating chemistry and stimulating sexual attraction.\n\nThe rolling green hills of the Presidio and expansive grassy nulls are likely to activate happy childhood memories of easy-going summers spent at the park with family. \n\nTake a peaceful walk through the tranquil water garden and share stories of the days you spent when you were younger, playing outdoors with your friends in the warm summer heat. \n\nThe only down side? If you're taking public transportation this location is far away from BART and MUNI but you can get there by bus and it's well worth the trip if you've never been. \n\nAnd now you know why Starbucks in the Presidio is anything but your average coffee date.\n\nPark Here For Free:\n1007 General Kennedy Ave\nSan Francisco, CA 94129\n\nOr Park Here For Free:\n1076 Gorgas Ave\nSan Francisco, CA 94123\n\nOr Park Here For Free:\n1031 Edie Rd\nSan Francisco, CA 94129", "author": "Emyli V."}

Avoid any Starbucks that just has AT&T service as it is capped at around 2-3 Mbps per user.   And no, that is not because lots of people may be using it.   Even when you go to AT&T Starbucks with no leechers, no laptops, no customers, it is still 2 Mbps.   When there are a lot of users or signal fragmentation, AT&T wifi can drop to abysmal rates of less than half a Mbps and noticable lag even on simple non-streaming  web page loads.\n\nUnfortunately, there are only 10 Starbucks in San Francisco with Google Wifi.   But this store is one of them, and it's like a jewel mounted in the golden setting of the Park Presidio.  \n\nActually 10 Google Starbucks in one city is a lot.   Most cities only have 1 Starbucks with fast wifi.   I guess San Francisco lucks out because there are so many techies around demanding speed.   Come on people, send Starbucks a message.   Don't patronize their outlets that only serve up 2 Mbps when 60 Mbps could be had with a little customer awareness and selectivity.", "author": "Trevor C."}

As a early morning barista, you should have the patience and the personality to handle a small line of morning people. Mike was making hand gestures telling me to hurry up and didn't even give me my food warmed like I asked. He was getting mad at the computer for not being fast enough and i watched as my bill went up to $19 because he kept clicking the screen HARD. Then I had to wait for him to fix it. When my boyfriend gave him back the food saying I asked for it warmed, Mike argued back saying \"no she didn't. Next time you better tell us right when you buy it\". Now I was not dressed proper like all these business people because I was traveling from a backpacking trip. I felt mistreated because I looked like a bum compared to the rest of the customers. \n\nHere's the best part- MIKE IS THE MANAGER. I work in customer service and this is the worst I've seen. \nI really hope the district manager fires this one. Without a doubt this Mike was a mistake.", "author": "Rhazlynn C."}

It's a stumble from my office, and that's exactly how I get there most mornings.\n\nThe folks who work here get to know you, your name, what you drink, and will even spare you the pain of having to order first thing in the morning by pointing to a cup and saying, \"The usual\"?\n\nMy favorite Starbucks in the whole wide World.", "author": "Doug L."}

Okay, so I don't really know what strolling is, and they probably weren't rich, but everyone knows perception trumps reality, so humor me.\n\nThanks to the calm University Campus-ish vibe, my tazo tea tasted a little more delicious and my fruit cup a little more fresh, in the way only a child happily raised on pesticides and artificial flavors can understand.\n\nThis location is off the beaten path, and no doubt provides a nice escape for Presidio-dwellers.  Since I have trust issues, I was relaxed, but couldn't let myself feel completely at peace.  I kept expecting someone with a gunney sack and duct tape to jump out of the bushes and drag me toward the Bay.  Don't be worried, dear Reader, because I took a drop-in kickboxing class when I was 17, which practically makes me a black belt.  I would have Ralph Macchio'd that predator, applied hand sanitizer, and then finished my scrumptious Starbucks beverage.  \n\nNow THAT would have been a 5-star review.", "author": "Janney B."}

I don't get the point of this being a chain store if it doesn't keep broader hours then the small time biz it replaced.\n\nI would have updated this to add another star or two if just for the beautiful LDAC scenery and nice seating areas, but back down the stars go for the abbreviated hours (conveniently not posted on the Starbucks web site) and the fact it apparently isn't even a wifi location..", "author": "GIR .."}

The George Lucas financed park is right in front of it, and they have nice outdoor seating available that gets late afternoon sun and is shielded from the wind.\n\nThis place is also high on my \"People Watching\" list.  Where else are you going to get such a continual cluster of ILM tech nerds to observe, listen and amuse yourself with?  (I can imagine the google cafeteria might be a close second, but I haven't made my way down there yet.)  Their conversations are fascinating (today's included the efficacy of punching somebody), their fashion: showing their eternal struggle with accepting/rejecting their worship of George Lucas, and their giggling is one of a kind.  \nYes: giggling.\n\nOh, and the coffee is good too.  It's Starbucks.\nWhich means it's good unless that's currently uncool to say.  In which case, just pretend it's a Peet's.
