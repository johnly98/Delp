Not as splashy as Tartine, not as trendy as Mr. Holmes, not a cafe like Jane. Just a good, honest bakery with delicious pastries, bread and cakes - the kind of place parents take their kids after school, the kind of place with regulars who stop in for a morning coffee and croissant. I personally ask A to get my birthday cake from NVB every year because the Carrot Cake is made of the stuff of dreams but I have never had a bad slice of cake or cupcake.\n\nIn addition to a display case full of treats, NVB also serves coffee and espresso drinks, though I can only vouch that the cold brew is good. They also have take-and-bake cookie dough which is a great idea but I can't bring myself to buy since I'll eat it all. Besides their standard items, NVB also offers seasonal items and special delectables for holidays (Jewish, Christian and Secular that I've seen) all of which taste like they're classics and not an afterthought.\n\nThey also do some form of \"Happy Hour\" deals from 3-6 which used to be discounted coffee though I'm not sure what the exact deal is at this point. IMO, NVB is one of the best bakeries in the city and if you're in the area, you have to stop in. My one complaint is that it isn't open later to get a late night dessert, but my waistline is probably grateful that they close at 7.", "author": "Carrie W."}

I was contemplating between the strawberry cake and salted caramel, and I ended up going with salted caramel. The cake design wasn't the prettiest but oh man it tasted so heavenly. \n\nA small 6\" cake was only $38. Initially I was gonna get a cake from 85C bakery but their cake is average and probably cost about $30, so I thought I'd spend a little bit more for something with more quality in it, and I wasn't disappointed. Everyone loved it and for the first time I saw an entire cake gone within minutes. Oh I also requested the store to write a happy birthday message on the cake and their handwriting was so pretty!\n\nTheir cupcakes were $3.75 each, many of them were chocolate based.\n\nAt the end of the night everyone asked where I got the cake from and they loved it! I'm really happy with my decision to go with a random bakery I saw while walking around Noe Valley.", "author": "Elle T."}

I used to live near the bakery in Noe Valley before moving to Silicon Valley and I truly miss it! I still work in SF, so every opportunity I can, I go there! \n\nEverything is made fresh! I've had the cup cakes, tarts, cakes, pastries and love it all! I have never been disappointed and love getting items and taking them to parties, bdays etc and introduce people to Noe Valley Bakery! \n\nASI mentioned all the items sold daily are fresh and taste phenomenal. I love the fact that there are also special sweets made during holidays. I ordered the Kings Cake during Mardi Gras, there are also other holiday cakes and pastries available. If you get a chance, join the newsletter to get notified of the special holiday goodies! \n\nLocated in the heart of. Or Valley, this family owned bakery has it all. Cookies, coffee,etc. It is always busy, so I suggest you go early and get your sweets as this is a very popular spot. \n\nParking is metered parking along 24th street, there is a small parking lot a few doors down too, which is often full. Close to the 24 Divisadero bus line which stops at 24th/Castro a few doors down from the bakery. \n\nService is always amazing, they treat you so nice, like family and all the locals in the neighbourhood o there to get their sweets and coffee. \n\nPrice is also very reasonable. You get a lot for your money and it's simply decadent. One of my all time favourite bakeries to date!", "author": "Albie E."}

The cupcake was very moist and not overly sweet. The center frosting was my favorite and it wasn't too dense. My mother in law loved it and she normally doesn't eat too much sweets.

NVB.  \nCelebrating your cat's first birthday and need to custom order a cake for the party? NVB.  \nGot hungry while walking around and need fresh milk and cookies? NVB.\nJust got a craving for a fruit tart? NVB. \n\nAll the pastries and desserts here are top-notch, but my favorite thing about Noe Valley Bakery are their cakes.  I mean, if super moist and lightly sweet cakes are your thing, this is the place for it.\n\nAnd yes, I really did order a cake from here for my cat's first birthday party.  It was a vanilla chiffon cake with strawberry Bavarian cream and fresh strawberries that went well with Prosecco .  The human guests loved it!\n\nGiven this was my go-to place for all things sweet and delicious, it was no surprise that I ordered my wedding cake from here as well.  The wedding cake was a devil's food chocolate cake with a raspberry mousse filling and cream cheese frosting on the exterior.  I still dream about that cake, it was *that* good.  Wedding Pro-Tip: I made sure to order the cake plain, so I could put fresh flowers on it later.  It kept the cost of the cake down to about 20% of the quoted price from their cake artist.  \n\nGreat neighborhood bakery!", "author": "Nancy C."}

Noe Valley Bakery is her faithful standby, whereas I like to mix it up. (Schubert's, Dianda's, B patisserie) However, I do have to hand it to Cassie because she knows how to pick the best cakes! And the ones I've had at Noe Valley Bakery has not disappointed through the years that I've been the lucky recipient. From Lemon passionfruit to Strawberry Shortcake, the flavors are always spot on, the presentation is simply wonderful and the prices are affordable for the size of cake you get. \n\nOne time, she brought Salted Caramel cake to a brunch party and I could not forget about this cake. It is a sinfully delicious devil's food cake layered with burnt caramel and topped with caramel buttercream. Imagine caramel on caramel then crowned with ganache and sea salt.

I ordered a small espresso bev and a cranberry scone and went on my way.  I finished my coffee and scone outside and was very happy, especially with the scone.  It was flavorful and light inside with perfect crispy edges.  After my meeting, having been already impressed, I went back and ordered another coffee.  While waiting for it to be made, the employee behind the bar engaged with me about the scones and her passion for the blueberry convinced me to buy one to take home for later.

You got about 8 good slices from it, but damn, when did cake get so expensive. I also wanted to try a ton more, but at about 5:30PM, they had run out of most stuff. I ended up getting the blueberry pecan scones to bake at home, about $14/15 dollars for 6 biscuit-sized scones to bake at home.

They do run out so if you want something specific or special go early or order it. \n\nDIPPED cupcakes - mini vanilla cupcakes with a light moist bavarian cream with the top dipped in hardened chocolate. Sounds so simple. I was not that excited but someone there recommended it as her favorite so I figured why not try since my previous favorite chocolate caramel cupcake was sold or at the time. FAVORITE THING IN THE WHOLE BAKERY now.  \n\nChocolate caramel cupcake: delicious. My second favorite to the dipped cupcakes. Not too rich on the caramel flavor but just enough to balance out the chocolate goodness. \n\nRed velvet: a little on the dense and dark side.  The frosting doesn't taste like a real creamy cream cheese frosting so that made me sad.  Tasted more like a cream cheese flavored buttercream to me \n\nCarrot cake cupcake - really good except it's full of raisins and other things related to raisins. And I don't like raisins. So this was a lot of work to try to pick out all of those squishy things so not my thing. But it's super real with real carrots in it. \n\nMoistess cupcake - it's good. Reminds me of a fancy homemade hostess ho-ho or ding dong (do they even make those anymore?!). So yes it's chocolate and good but doesn't seem super special \n\nBombe - super rich chocolate goodness. Like a rich multi layer mousse. \n\nMeat and cheese quiche - really enjoyable breakfast. Not too meaty. Not to cheesy. Fluffy egg. \n\nBe careful because their boxes don't always close well and the stickers aren't the stickiest so your box may spring open at the wrong time so ask for extra tape or just be careful so your goodies don't end up on the floor.", "author": "Traci H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-29", "description": "Years ago, someone brought a bunch of Noe Valley cupcakes to the office. Back then, I thought I didn't like cupcakes, because one too many stale grocery store baked goods turned me off from cupcakes. Plus I thought cupcakes were more of a children's snack, maybe because of memories of school bake sales, or because they're individually wrapped in paper so kids don't have to use any forks or plates, or maybe because the decorations often look juvenile. Noe Valley Bakery & Bread Co. made me realize delicious cupcakes do exist, and I do like them! After I tried one, I paid the store a visit and became a repeat customer.\nThe bakery itself is on the small side. There are two display cases with cakes, cupcakes, cookies, pastries. Loaves of fresh bread are lined up on the shelves. There are also candles, cards, and dough to take home and bake yourself.\n\nAll the cupcakes are very rich, heavy, and moist. The icing is so creamy, smooth, and beautifully applied. They're pretty pricey, around $3.50-$4ish per cupcake, but they seem larger than most cupcakes. Some of them come in mini size. The filled ones cost a little more. To me, the taste is superior to most cupcakes. The cupcakes are very thick too. Cutting into one doesn't smush or deflate them.\n\nRed Velvet - deep, dark red cake. Perhaps they use less red food coloring than most. The cream cheese icing is thick and creamy, almost like cheesecake filling, but so much smoother than actually eating cheesecake.\n\nMost-est - their rendition of the Hostess with Bavarian cream & silky ganache\n\nChocolate Caramel Fleur de Sel - filled with caramel Bavarian cream, sprinkled with chunky sea salt. Sea salt is the best part, because it adds a savory component, and enhances the flavor. Otherwise, I wouldn't really like this one, as I'm not a fan of caramel. \n\nBoston Cream - vanilla cake filled with a pastry cream that resembles custard, topped with stiff fudge icing\n\nPeanut Butter Cup - a tiny peanut butter cup sits atop the cake covered in chocolate ganache, filled with more rich, creamy peanut butter. It's so rich, sweet, and savory.\n\nI'm not sure if they still have the Boston Cream or the PB cup, and that makes me sad, because I'm pretty sure they were my favorites. A few other things have changed, mostly in appearance. The lemon cupcake is no longer decorated with a bee on top. The carrot cupcake that had carrot-shaped icing is now replaced with shredded carrots on top. \n\nTheir cakes are great - simple in design, but big on taste. They are a little expensive at ~$40 for a small cake. The writing on the cake is done very well, almost font-like. Clearly, penmanship is important here. They do some pretty amazing-looking custom cakes too.\n\nI've tried some of the cookies, but they didn't stand out to me. They also carry Tout Sweet macarons now, which is news to me.\n\nI'm looking forward to the next time I can grab one of these cupcakes and some flaky pastries.", "author": "Joy W."}

They serve up simple and tasty sweet and savory (though not as many) baked goods. Slightly upscale than Arizmendi offerings but not as pretentious or decadent portions as Tartine. A little bit pricey but reasonable and you get your money's worth in quantity.\n\nApricot Ginger Bread (Vegan?) $6 - So flavorful and well spiced with chunks of apricot baked in. It's a perfect vehicle for eating with cheese.\nBrownie $2.75 - Enormous, super dense and chocolatey. If you like half baked, rich and fudgey brownies, you won't be disappointed. I could stretch out the brownie into 4 servings and be satisfied, I mean I'm guessing it's like half a days worth of calories anyways. You're gonna need a tall glass of milk to wash this down.\nMilky Way Bomb $6 - The chocolate mousse dome cake. Great airy and rich mousse texture and blending of the caramel flavor. I prefer dark chocolate but knew going in this would be sweeter and milkier. Still quite good for what it is and you'll probably love it if you're milk chocolate fan.\nMexican Wedding Cookie $1.45 - Bite sized powdery and nutty cookies.\nChocolate Croissant - Flaky, light nice pastry, browned on the outside filled with generous chocolate chunk. Reasonably sized portion, buttery and not too dry. Solid, also kind of boring.\n\nSome tasty to competent offerings, but on the boring side.

Until now.\n\nAn old English tradition, the $2.60 HOT CROSS BUNS were Noe Valley Bakery's seasonal Easter offering (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/noe-valley-bakery-and-bread-company-san-francisco?select=woNNoV7IxzwnxL5sRKkwSw#WmiX2PiFtqZAn2PQ7X7afQ). I had never had one before, so I don't have much to compare it too. I did like how light the dough and how it was coated with a shiny egg wash. The raisins paired well with the spices, which tasted like cinnamon, cloves, and maybe cardamom or nutmeg...or allspice. A sharply spiced bread for sure.\n\nNoe Valley Bakery also houses a few pastries from Yigit Pura's Tout Sweet Patisserie (a winner of Top Chef: Just Desserts). As a macaron maniac, I opted for the EARL GREY DARK CHOCOLATE and the AZTEC SPICY CHOCOLATE MACARONS, $2 apiece. My first impression was, \"Hot damn, these are super firm, crunchy macaron cookie shells...are they stale!?\" But once I got past how tough the exterior was, I could evaluate the cream.\n\nFor the earl grey macaron, regular almond-flavored cookies sandwiched an earl grey tea scented dark chocolate cream (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/noe-valley-bakery-and-bread-company-san-francisco?select=woNNoV7IxzwnxL5sRKkwSw#eoqzXftPQwrKubXtA_rJvA). Unfortunately, I could barely taste the early grey, but the chocolate tasted light and woody.\n\nI definitely preferred the aztec macaron with dark chocolate, sweet-spicy pastilla pepper cloves, cinnamon, and vanilla bean (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/noe-valley-bakery-and-bread-company-san-francisco?select=woNNoV7IxzwnxL5sRKkwSw#MtuvYCtZYaKVNY8v4gNl3w). The pastilla pepper cloves reminded me of ginger, a fav flavor all day erry day.\n\nI enjoyed the seasonal hot cross bun, and other reviewers have had glowing remarks about the cakes here. However, let's hope that the brick-and-mortar Tout Sweet Patisserie doesn't produce stale macarons. I'm pretty sure the ones at Noe Valley Bakery were.", "author": "Adele F."}

It has a variety of sweet and some savory treats, and everything is tasty and looks beautiful and artistic. When I come here to get breakfast I usually get scones and a baguette for my family to share. The baguette they have is scrumptious and delicious and so are their scones. There cookies, tarts, and cupcakes are amazing and tasty too, and again, artfully designed with frosting. My favorite treat to get there is the Milky Way bomb, because of how sweet and chocolaty it is.

My husband, son and I spent a weekday afternoon in Noe Valley to have lunch, pick up groceries and indulge in some dessert.  We walked all over 24th street and finally settled Noe Valley Bakery.  We ordered a red velvet cupcake and some frozen chocolate chip cookies to take home and bake.  All of their desserts look amazingly good and the service is top notch.  \n\nI checked out the cakes, cookies and cupcakes and wanted to try every single one.  My son and I shared the red velvet cupcake.  By sharing, he ate the  cheese cream icing and I had the rest of the cupcake.  My son won't have anything to do with any part of the cupcake that has no icing, which cracks me up but also makes me a 'little' pissed off because I can't indulge in the moist cream cheese icing. \n\nI also saw their most-es cupcake which I will definitely try because it looks amazing.  I found a brief description of their most-ex cupcake (below) and can't wait to return to check it out. \n\nMost-es Cupcake:\nA childhood favorite. Rich chocolate cupcake filled with Bavarian cream, topped with chocolate ganache and white curly Q's\n\nOh and since the holidays are fast approaching, you may want to check out their site for all of their goods. Here's the stuff they have for Thanksgiving and Christmas according to their website (11/2014): \n\nThanksgiving treats: Pecan Tartlet, Pumpkin Spice Cookie, Pumpkin Cutout Cookie, Acorn Cookie, Leaf Cookie, Apple Pie, Mixed Berry Pie, Pear Cranberry Pie, Dutch Apple Pie (limited availability), Pecan Pie, Pumpkin Pie, Poached Quince & Frangipane Tart, Eggnog Cheesecake Tart with Cranberry Jam, Spiced Cupcake with Tangerine Cream Frosting, Individual Pumpkin Cheesecake, Turkey Stuffing Mix, Whole Wheat Dinner Rolls, Challah Dinner Rolls and Michael's Famous Christmas Stollen\n\nChristmas treats: Pumpkin Spice Cookie, Small Gingerbread Boy Cookie, Snowman Cookie, Santa Hat Cookie, All New Cookies!, Big Gingerbread Girl Cookie, Gingerbread Cookie Kit, Gingerbread House Kit, Christmas Cookie Box, Christmas Cookie Tin, Deluxe Gold Christmas Cookie Box, Christmas Stump, Flourless Chocolate Pomegranate Cake, Hazelnut-Raspberry Roll, Grand Marnier Truffle Cake, Large Milky Way Bomb, Christmas Stollen, Christmas Petit Fours, Candy Cane Mini Cupcake, Gingerbread Boy Mini Cupcake, Present Cupcake, Snowman Cupcake\n\nCan I have one of everything please?  \n\nAnyway, the frozen chocolate chip cookies I purchased are waiting to be baked and are happily sitting in my freezer as I type.

The chocolate cherry Sunday only loaf ($5.95) was OVER THE TOP and toasted with butter and nutella, well it should be a crime.\n I still have a blueberry pecan scone and oatmeal cookie to eat at home in the freezer. OH they have the dough's to take home in the freezer too!!\n\nI ALSO had the pumpkin cream cheese loaf i took it to a friends house. It was OK but it didn't really amaze me like everything else did. (womp womp, win some loose some).\n\nThe smell of my hot baguettes on the bart and airplane tortured everyone in a 10 foot radius. I had to guard them with my life, but we made it home.

I've been coming to Noe Valley Bakery since I was a child (almost 3 decades ago). The bread, pastries and cakes have always been top notch, A1. But as their popularity has grown, so has the size of this bakery's head and that of all of its employees.\nI hate to break it to you, but you are NOT Tartine. There is no reason to lose your customer service, or your humility. Your good pastries will only take you so far, even with the New San Francisco and all of the transplants with $ who may not know better.\nI tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt, because I'm obviously attached to a lot of the items they have to offer, and their quality ingredients. \nBut after today, no more. It has become so unpleasant to come into your 24th street storefront, to only be greeted or helped half of the time, and when asking a question, to receive attitude and snappiness (consistently). \nYou have lost a decades-long customer, and that is that.", "author": "Nicole W."}

I searched the web and found out that Noe Valley Bakery was selling king cakes for $17.50. Popular king cakes in the south are usually stuffed with cream cheese or plain cinnamon. They usually leave the baby outside of the cake so that you can heat up the cake and stuff it afterwards. The king cake a Noe Valley I had to slice it up and heat up individually so that I won't microwave the plastic baby. It's also stuffed with chocolate. The cake tastes like a cinnamon roll with chocolate filling. The baby stuffed inside is also super huge compared to originally king cakes. \n\nOverall the king cake was pretty good. It's not exactly the same as king cakes in the south but it does the job. \n\nI also ordered a cream cheese mini cake and the lemon tart. They were both delicious.", "author": "V N."}

Their mini cupcakes are life-changing. I never had a cupcake so spongy and soft. The best one is the cookies 'n' cream mini cupcake, which has a cookies 'n' cream filling stuffed inside a miniature chocolate cake with whipped topping, crumbs, and a miniature Oreo resting on top!  \n\nThe selling point for me is their awesome frosting to cake ratio and the fact that they use whipped frosting for some other cakes instead of the saccharine, thick frostings that make me shudder. \nAnother mini-cupcake for those who don't like frosting like me is the Dipp'd mini, which comes with bavarian cream instead and is dipped in chocolate ganache. \n\nFor regular cupcakes, my favorite is the banana caramel cupcake which should be a hit among those who like banana bread. \n\nIf I were to review this place solely based on the cupcakes and birthday cakes they whip out, I would give them five stars. I've went to two birthday parties that elected to get their cake here and both of them (Cloud 9 and Red Velvet) were fantastic!\n\nThey also have a great assortment of cookies. Recommendations: Pinwheels, Noe-Os (their version of Oreos also comes dipped in chocolate), Apricot Hamentashen, MmCookies, Circus Animals\n\nSome of the misses are their breakfast pastries. The raspberry filling of my croissant tasted too sweet/artificial as well as the orange glaze on my raisin bun, although they both tasted flaky after I heated it up in the toaster oven. The scones are decent, but not amazing. \n\nI've had the fruit tart and the lemon tart here. They have sturdy shortbread crusts which I like but the lemon tart consistency was really thick and was hard to get through, while the fruit tart had more of a whipped cream instead of a custard or a vanilla pastry cream, which was a let-down. \n\nThey change their offerings up every once in a while and always has the most adorable window displays that make me want to buy a custom cake for myself on the spot.", "author": "Alice L."}

That was many months ago, and I still haven't tried a cupcake yet.  Something else always seems to catch my eye at the Noe Valley Bakery.\n\nI love their scones.  The Blueberry Pecan Scone (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oHuPyoGY7nhCQeprHCv21g?select=XOowzsywUMuBGaANo9N-WQ) is amazing.  It's as buttery as Yelp friend Jennifer L. describes in her review and it's full of plump blueberries and crunchy pecans.  I haven't tried reheating it as she does because it never lasts until the next day.\n\nI love their pastries.  One of my favorites is the Apple Wrap (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oHuPyoGY7nhCQeprHCv21g?select=pEWeJUwO-6dvNdeT0Ktm4A).  It's an entire apple half, peeled and cored, wrapped in a thin, flaky pastry shell.  These are excellent fresh or warmed in the oven for just a bit.\n\nI love their fresh baked breads.  One of my absolute favorites at any bakery in San Francisco is Noe Valley's Apricot-Ginger Bread (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oHuPyoGY7nhCQeprHCv21g?select=JTsUTpi9i0To6rmRT3aMGQ).  The apricots are plump, soft, flavorful and plentiful and even though you can't see the ginger its flavor is definitely highlighted in the dense, moist bread.  I've been known to eat an entire loaf of this bread in one sitting.\n\nI often tell people that I like my cookies hard and crispy, but that doesn't mean I won't eat a cookie if it's soft and chewy.  Noe Valley Bakery's cookies are neither hard and crispy nor soft and chewy but more of something in between.  I've tried many of their cookie varieties so far, and they've all been good.  Recently I tried their Chocolate Chip Pecan and Pinwheel Shortbread cookies (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oHuPyoGY7nhCQeprHCv21g?select=6ueeFeF-7CuDMwv9_BthKg).  I liked the Chocolate Chip Pecan more because it had lots of crunchy pecans in it, but do you know the real reason why I haven't tried a cupcake from here?  These look so much more tasty (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oHuPyoGY7nhCQeprHCv21g?select=Y2r2dKmUT6oUzkyUcFZufw)!!\n\nThanks Noe Valley Bakery!", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

They charged me an extra 3% for \"SF Mandates.\"\n\nI don't give a damn about the 3% or the 9 cents it cost me.  Rather I object to the greedy owners who can't, or won't, take responsibility for their workers.  These greedy owners have a choice of providing health care or setting aside money (3%) for employee health care.  They decide to set aside the money--but they only set aside the 3% as they are too cheap to provide decent health benefits to their workers.  \n\nAnd even the SF Chronicle, bastion of downtown big business opinion, points out that most of those restaurants and bakeries just pocket the difference between what they are required to set aside and the money they spend. \n\nThey want to promote the con that SF Mandates is taking your money.  They want to hid the truth of their disregard for their employees by not adequately funding their health care.  \n\nI won't shop at Noe Valley Bakery.", "author": "Tim L."}

They are being cheap putting less custard or cream fillings inside and even the chocolate frostings are very thin now while the prices have gone up way above other good bakeries in San Fran. Forget about customer service because they don't really care.. The servers have an attitude as if you owe them something as oppose to serving the customer. In fact you see this in other reviews. Today two people behind the counter were filling online orders and only one person was serving  the 4 customers waiting in the line!  So the online orders take priority over the customers that are physically standing and waiting to buy.  On top of this, they ignored one of the customers that was waiting for a long time and served the customer behind her as if she did not exist. Even after she said she was next, they went ahead and served the customer behind her. They did not even apologize to her or offer her a free pastry, God forbid!  Some of the pastries that we bought were frozen but they denied it when we told them. The frozen pastries were full of ice as if they were just removed from freezer. I wonder how fresh the frozen pastries are. They tell you all their pastries are fresh, but that is not true. Most of the time the servers behind the counter are very young people probably on min wage and are not focused on serving customers, they can be chit chatting or just uninterested. We will not go back again and do not recommend it. The only reason we have been going there is because it is near our home. There are other good bakeries in the Mission that serve you better and don't charge you as much.", "author": "Roz R."}

So, I decided to see what all the commotion was about since I had a hankering for cookies.  Cookies IMO reflect the thoughtfulness of the bakery, so I decided to have a smattering of the cookies here so I could get some sense of this bakery's talent. Here's what I found:\n\n* Oatmeal cookie:  These were good.  Still chewy, with a little crisp outside.  Good taste, not too sweet with enough cinnamon.  Not spectacular because they didn't taste all that fresh. \n\n* Chocolate chip cookie: I really don't say this often, but yuck. How do you mess up chocolate chip cookies?  This batch tasted like they had been sitting around for more than a day, heck a week! Had a bitter finish. I was compelled to spit it out. \n\n* Ginger snap: The flavor was good, but no snap.  However, they weren't soft and chewy either, like if it was crispy at one point in it's life, but softened up from sitting out. \n\n* Chocoquake: It tasted fine, but just meh and a little dry - not really worth the calories.\n\nThis was a nice little bakery with a fantastic Christmas display.  It also gave the feel of the \"local bakery\" that the neighborhood families go to.  For that and the overall A-ok taste of the two out the four cookies I sampled, I'd give it three stars.  However, when the lady in front of me tried to point out to the guy behind the counter that there was a fly in the glass display hopping from cookie to cookie, the guy just shrugged his shoulder and said, \"Oh, well.\" He ignored her and went on to the next customer.

They are all incredibly nice, but their service could not change my mind about my 2-star review (based purely on the cupcakes and Mexican wedding cookie).\n\nOkay after reading how great the cupcakes were, I was excited to come stop by. However, maybe my expectations were too high because the flavor of the Boston cream pie fell short. The cake was dry and lacked flavor. The chocolate frosting was too thick and overpowered the rest of the cupcake. The filling of cream cheese was minimal and not enjoyable. So much for great cupcakes...I thought they could be redeemed by their Mexican wedding cookies, but even those were not impressive.\n\nI definitely won't be coming back. Waste of money & time. The only positive about the bakery was the great service.", "author": "Surge C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-02-15", "description": "Let me just start by saying, Noe Valley Bakery has AMAZING cakes which is why we wanted them to make our wedding cake.   \n\nWe started by going into the store and inquiring and were  handed a really old binder filled with many different options for event cakes in the busy and small storefront.  When we asked if we could talk with someone about ordering a cake, we were given an email address and told that all ordering would happen over email.  Seemed a little weird, but fine.  However, a week later when we were ready to start the process, there was no information or catalog online to review pricing or what we wanted to get.  I emailed the person asking for this information and about a week later I got a pleasant and vague response asking me to give details about what we wanted to get and that they could do what we needed. They said they were available for our date and might possibly be available for delivery.  Not being able to make it back to the store to review options, I gave a basic idea of what we thought we thought we were looking for, with color scheme and cake flavor, there was no response. I was excited to get the process started and talk about options and pricing.  About a week later we received  an email saying that due to staffing they were no longer available to make our wedding cake for our date. \n\nOverall, not impressed with the customer service.  We were very disappointed with the lack of information provided and the lack of attention to our needs.  We are sad not to have their product at our wedding and are now having to start from scratch.  If this is a service they wish to provide, I suggest making some changes in the way things are handled and have more transparent information on their website and or the ability to talk with someone in person to place an order.", "author": "Rachel D."}

One octogenarian raved that they were just like homemade, then she corrected herself...actually, better than homemade!

Why not one, two or three more stars?  I'll tell you why... \nthey have a younger maybe teenaged or very early twenties girl who has at least worked here for a while now and has over charged me a few times and always seems to have a bad attitude.  She will flash a smile usually at some point, I believe because she knows she has to not seem irritated at the fact that a paying customer has walked in the door.  The smile looks so forced. The rest of the experience having her roll her eyes and getting over charged only confirms it's forced.  I always know what I am going to order when I walk in, I say please, thank you, I am polite and I tip... I fail to believe that my personality if the defective one causing this situation.  Oh I almost forgot... AND I work in the area, one time another one of the good staff members mentioned to her about the discount I get for working just a few places down the block, she looked irritated at him, said \"I know\" continued to over charge me from the REGULAR price, looked me right in the eyes, said my total again and put her hand out.  Needless to say I now look to see if she is working and I won't go in there is she is.\nMy co-worker who is the sweetest woman also had a bad experience in here once as well when going in to purchase a birthday cake for her husband I believe.  I don't recall all the details but she is very loyal when it comes to places she gives her business to and she is a very understanding woman so if they had bad enough customer service to deter her from ever going here again something must be going wrong.\nLastly their pastries are okay.  They aren't bad but there are so many better places to go in the city for pastries.  If you are looking just in the Noe Valley area though then this is the place to go because they aren't bad.  They make decent breads, the morning pastries I've had such as muffins and croissants are good... they don't make their scones properly but my mother spent some time growing up in England so I am honestly probably just overly picky about my scones, and their cupcakes are decent as well.", "author": "Christina H."}

During lunch today I was bad and ordered a Pear Tart at the cafe.  \n\nThat did it for me, and I had to make my way over Noe Valley Bakery while I was in the neighborhood.  I went in at around 6:00pm, so many of goodies had already been sold, but luckily, they still had a few Fruit Tarts and Pecan Tartlettes left, a few of my favorites.  \n\nThe Pecan Tartlette was great--the crust was chewy and buttery.  It was sweet, but not overly sweet from the glaze inside.  One of the best little tarlettes that I've had before. \n\nFruit Tarts are my weakness!  Those fruit tarts from Noe Valley Baker were so pretty in the window display and I had to order three.  Upon getting home, I couldn't help myself and devoured one.  To my slight disappointment, the tart was filled in the center with whip cream instead of a creamy sweet custard. The crust was the same as the pecan tarts.  Fruits were fresh, and glazed well with sugar syrup.  But the whip cream was definitely a turn off for me.  Almost made it a bit amateurish.\n\nI'm so happy to have found a bakery that still had some whole wheat sourdough left.  So I had to order a loaf.  Tasted great, and although it was 6:00pm, the the texture seemed to be hard, as if it was day old.  But you can never tell. \n\nThe Fruit Tart was $4.95 and Pecan Tartlett was about $2.95.  Whole Wheat Sourdough was a couple bucks, can't really remember.  \n\nPrices were a bit pricey for the Fruit Tart.  Overall, presentation of tarts was beautiful, but the whip cream didn't really do it for me.  Might be back for other treats, just not the Fruit Tart.", "author": "Cass J."}

It's pretty to look at (fresh strawberry slices) and light tasting (hazelnut sponge cake - I love sponge cake and I love hazelnuts).  I get it with whipped cream.  Mmm.  I was extremely excited to hear that they had greatly expanded their cupcake line recently (still hoping for a hazelnut cupcake).  \n\nThey have fancy grown-up cupcakes and they're cheaper than ones at cupcake shops ($2 to $2.50 each).  The cake is on the dry side  and the frosting is softer than average.\n\n* Red velvet cupcake:  Dry cake and the frosting was way too sweet, but then I hate sweet cream cheese frosting.  \n* Most-est cupcake: Their best cupcake.  The rich chocolate ganache is a sophisticated touch (and it's delicious) as is the elegant white squiggle.  This is a classy Hostess cupcake.  The chocolate cake is a bit dry but the Bavarian cream filling is delicious.  \n* Lemon drop cupcake:  The handmade frosting bee with almond wings is adorable. The vanilla cake was on the bland side (and dry).  Doesn't taste like they use Madagascar Bourbon vanilla.  The lemon buttercream frosting was soft and subtle whereas the filling of lemon Bavarian was much more lemony.  \n\nOkay, so I didn't fall in love with each cupcake but on the strength of their morning buns (melt in your mouth tender but still crispy in parts), hazelnut sponge cake and Most-est cupcakes, I am in love with Noe Valley Bakery.  I'm also more lenient/have lower cupcake expectations for bakeries vs. places that specialize in cupcakes.  For a bakery, NV does a fine job with cupcakes.  \n\nThis place has it all: sandwiches, quiche, breads, pies, tarts, scones, frozen scone and pie dough, tote bags, croissants, and the most amazing morning buns.

Oh, and those adorable cupcakes they make too, especially the lemon drop cupcake with bees made of frosting and almond slices.\n\nTheir cupcakes are much more affordable and much larger than fancy cupcakeries like Kara's.  However, I still give it to Kara's for a perfectly executed cupcake.  On the other hand, the cupcakes at Noe Valley Bakery have the looks, but their cake is on the dry side.  My favorite cupcake of theirs is the Zinger'd (vanilla cupcake filled with raspberry Bavarian cream, topped with raspberry buttercream and pink coconut flakes)--so girly!

Beware of the falling blueberry though. \n\nThen got the morning bun because it looked a lot less heavy and just more gentle than the typical morning buns I see. (La Farine and Starbucks I'm looking at you) Really, morning buns are amazing. It's like the beautiful lovechild of a croissant and a cinnamon bun. Speaking of love, they also have love buns which sound like morning buns with cream in them. They're a little uglier though so I refrained. Anyway NVB's morning bun is arguably the best I've ever had.  \n\nWe also got a hot cross bun because we'd never tried it before. It was my favorite thing even though I hate raisins.

We were happy campers after our sampling session. \n\n$2.50-$2.75 per cupcake is absolutely reasonable for the medium-size cupcakes.

It was more important to us to have something that tasted good than to have a multi-tiered fondant-covered affair that was made more for looks than eating. Not to mention that a sheet cake was about 80% cheaper per slice than a traditional wedding cake.\n\nWe went with a lemon chiffon cake with white butter-cream. I can't speak to the other flavors - but this one is great! We ordered a full sheet cake, which is HUGE. We actually probably had twice as much as we needed - but with it being so affordable we thought it was better to have too much than not enough. We had a complex design that required the bakery to print multiple scanned images on rice paper - and then cut them into separate images and place them onto the cake in a final design we had provided them with. The reason we did this is there was a charge for each 8 1/2 X 11 scanned image - and at that maximum size we had to make our design into several large images so that it would look right on such a large cake.\n\nWe were a little concerned because they said they had never done a job quite like this before. However, their staff was fantastic - happy to work with us - and very professional. We confirmed with them a couple of times and they were super helpful and patient. When the big day arrived, the cake looked fantastic! They packed it in a big box with a stiff board on the bottom. It to our venue in the trunk of our friends' car flawlessly. And it tasted as great as we had hoped it would.\n\nNoe Valley did a great job and I don't have any real complaints. The only minor inconvenience is they have many people working there and some are a bit more knowledgeable than others about the custom cakes. So we didn't have a specific \"point person\" to deal with an answer questions. However - they really did a great job and we were very happy.", "author": "David C."}

Whether that is the reason or not, I am glad he did.\n\nI've had almost all the cupcake flavors here that I can't even keep up with it.  I am in love with the lemon, the most-est and most especially, the red velvet! ughhhhhhhhh.......i'm craving one right now as I write this review.  I loved the red velvet sooo much that I bought a cake for my boyfriends birthday.  I must say that the cake does not compare to the cupcakes in terms of moistness. \n\nI haven't tried the bread yet but I will soon. What can I say? I loe oooooove looooooove carbs and places like this make me love it a million times more!  Thank you Noe Valley Bakery & Bread company for being in existence =)", "author": "Mary-Anne C."}

I thought it would be appropriate to get my baby shower cake there as well.\nI left very specific instructions about the cake decorations, since I wanted (and paid for) both  frosting decorations on the sides and a photo in the center of the cake. I made a sketch for them and they took a scan of the photo. The total cost was over $100. Come to pick up the cake the morning of the party, and there is a big blank expanse of cake with no picture. It looked so odd, I was surprised no-one double checked the order. \nThey couldn't do anything on that day as the bakers were not in, so I took the cake and we made do. I was not happy, but it was my subsequent interaction that lead to this review. \nI went back to request a refund of what I paid for the picture and an additional amount for the embarrassment and inconvenience of their improper work. I didn't ask for a specific amount, but asked the manager what he would think was fair. He was very defensive, and said, well I'm sure everyone ate the cake anyway. \nThe odd thing was, the manager didn't care when I said how disappointed I was,and that I was a customer for 10 years. But he did care when I mentioned in parting that the only recourse left to me was a negative yelp review. I got a partial refund, but I am so disappointed that what matters is their online reputation and not the satisfaction of their customers.\nIt seems that in the past, the owners/bakers were running the business, but now there is a manager who is primarily responsible.", "author": "Ana M."}

I've got every family birthday cake/cupcake here for the past few years but apparently I wasn't hitting the \"mean stoner\" shift that I seemed to encounter when I went in today.  I was getting 4 cupcakes for us to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  After telling him which 4 we wanted, he asked me 2 more times before putting them in a box, then an additional time when he was ringing me up.  Then, when I asked for a bag, since I had a baby in my arms, they told me that the 10 cent bag wouldn't be enough, I needed the 28 cent bag.  FOR 4 CUPCAKES?!  Does the 10 cent bag just hold 1 cupcake?  Does the bag need healthcare?  I'm so confused!  I tried to make a joke about babysitting while I ran the cupcakes to my car and the employees gave me the worst stink eye ever.  When the cupcakes average $4 a piece, it seemed a little ridiculous to not even be able to joke about it.  The cupcakes and cakes are good, but there are plenty of other places in SF with delicious baked goods as well.  They can keep their cupcakes, their 28 cent bags and their bad attitudes.", "author": "Colette G."}

I had spoken to several people and went from bakery to bakery about cupcakes and what they think is the best in the city. I call it the quest for the perfect cupcake. Now, I know everyone has different taste and flavors they like and its really hard to judge these things. \n\nI remember two years ago, us \"yelpers\" had our very own UYE Cupcake Bake Off. It was one of the best event I attended b/c cupcakes are awesome yo. It turns out someone I know quit their job and decide to open her own cupcake business. Cupcakes has been a fav of mine since I was little. I wish I could bake and everyone says it's easy, but not all cupcakes are good. I made an \"attempt\" a few weeks ago, I know it was decent. Nothing fantastic. I am grateful for the thank you's thou. \n\nSo, on my quest for the perfect cupcake, I went to several places around my neighborhood, did a little search and came here. Came in just looking, * had a huge smiley grin on my face and thinking to myself, WTH should I order and what does ( a person in mind ) would like? I ordered the ( cupcake ) and thought this is really good, it might live up to the 4 star review. I can't give it 5 until I tried every place in the city.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-04-27", "description": "Background:\nPast research by the principal investigator has demonstrated that consumption of cupcakes is significantly linked with feelings of euphoria and mild insanity (but the good kind). Additionally, field research in NYC has compared various cupcake purveyors (http://www.yelp.com/list_details?userid=DAf3UOAONCpgETWlNTERKg&list_id=SzFCtFQ2YOJxI54pxaUr3Q) and found Magnolia Bakery's cupcakes to be the frontrunner, described as \"HOT and MOIST and HEAVENLY\" (http://www.yelp.com/biz/85x3dZCMBj4rJ2LAdW-wFg?hrid=4nvPmoOAzAzW7hJjlMIjWw)  However, there is currently a dearth of research addressing the Great Cupcake Debate in the Bay Area (by the present PI). Therefore, the present review represents one study in a multi-site, ongoing research project to determine the Bay Area's BEST CUPCAKE EVAR.\n\n\nMethod:\nThe site for Study #1 - Noe Valley Bakery & Bread Company. Samples included:\n1) Most-est Cake - popular among Yelp reviews, fashioned after the Hostess cupcakes;\n2) Z'nger cupcake -fashioned after Dolly Madison raspberry flavored, creme filled cakes;\n3) Carrot Cake cupcake - fashioned after...well, carrot cake;\n4) Asiago cheese loaf (ok, so it's not a cupcake, but my co-investigator was kind enough to give me some of her loaf so it's fair for review)\n\nResults:\nOMG!!! (and I mean that in the most scientific way possible). Eating these cupcakes is like discovering a completely new, moister, more delicious level of existence. Let's break it down by each independent variable with the dependent variable (DV) operationalized as Steph's level of euphoria (where 1 = I would rather eat dirt, and 10 = I  could die right now and not give a crap):\n\n1) Most-est - Biting into the chocolate ganache top gives way to moist, chocolate cake heaven. A second bite into the cupcake and negative memories of the nasty white pseudocream in Hostess Suzy-Q's and Twinkies dissipate as perfect portion of the fluffy, vanilla creme center melds together with the surrounding chocolate cake. A wonderful cupcake, but personal tastes favor frosting over ganache. DV = 8.5 \n\n2) Z'nger - If angels came in the form of cupcakes, they would probably taste something like this. Moist angel food cake, filled and topped with a delicate whipped creamlike frosting that is speckled with raspberry preserves and dusted with pink and white coconut flakes. DV =  10\n\n3) Carrot Cake - Perfectly constructed in sweetness, density, and incorporation of shredded carrot, raisins, and walnuts. The frosting is a traditional cream cheese frosting, but excecuted perfectly to achieve the ultimate balance of sweetness, lightness, and creaminess. Eating this evoked images of swimming in carrot cake. (I dunno?) Even my co-investigator, who doesn't like carrot cake, had to concede that this was a delight.  DV = 10\n\n4) Asiago Cheese Loaf - A sturdy bread with large chunks of savory asiago goodness running throughout. I would imagine this would be quite delicious served warm as a sandwich bread or as is. DV = 7\n\nDiscussion:\nWhile the present research did not incorporate the tasting of the plain chocolate or vanilla cupcakes(thus serving as a control in comparing against other bakeries), the intensity of the reactions formed suggest that Noe Valley Bakery is in the running for the best cupcakes in SF. It should also be mentioned that the next morning, these cupcakes were STILL moist and heavenly. The Asiago loaf also suggests that the bakery does a good job with savory items, though further research is needed for more confident results. Other observations worthy to note:  there is no seating in the bakery and few cafes nearby; plan ahead where you will be conducting your own research. At only $1.95 per cupcake, this is a great deal compared to some other places that offer gourmet cupcakes. This is located in Noe Valley, which is a pain in the ass for someone who lives in the Inner Richmond. But it is TOTALLY worth it. I will try to make more friends with cars just to have more of these cupcakes.\n\nConclusion:\nNoe Valley Bakery has some DAMN GOOD, affordable cupcakes! Dare I say...better than Magnolia?!?! The PI's conception of cupcakes has been turned upside down and requires further investigation. Future research is highly recommended to assure reliability and validity of findings...and to induce states of euphoria!", "author": "Steph P."}

To our horror we arrived too late and the bakery had already closed for the night.  We staggered home and recoiled on the couch in despair.  Hours later, after we had recovered from our grief we decided to take a walk down 24th st back to the bakery to at least feel the aura of the chocolate, the cherries and the dough.\n\nWhen we arrived at the bakery we noticed a light on in back and a baker preparing dough.  Despite a moment of hesitation we decided to knock on the window to see if we could somehow still salvage the evening with our cherished rugalech.  The baker came to the door, and we explained to him our plight.  After listening attentively to our story, he told us to wait and disappeared in back.  Moments later he returned with an enormous smile and a large paper bag containing five loaves of chocolate cherry bread.  We hadn't realized such a miraculous thing existed.  We felt that five loaves would be indulgent and after a bit of haggling with the generous baker we were able to negotiate that three loaves would be sufficient.  We thanked the baker, returned home, rejoiced, and devoured the bread.\n\nI believe noe valley bakery bakes items that do not contain chocolate and cherries.  They're probably terrific.

We had the wedding at Crissy Field on the beach (aaaaah) and then kept the reception low-key with a picnic.  Of course, I was all about cupcakes. (I thought this was SO clever. Little did I know that cupcakes are all the rage for weddings. Whatever!!!). \n\nI yelped and decided on NVB.  I checked out their website and was thrilled with their cupcake selection.  I ordered a variety of 80 cupcakes, 2 tiered stands (each holds 40-45 cupcakes) , and a wedding cake with 2 brides because people told me they carry those.  \n\n\"We no longer carry those,\" the dude told me on the phone. Huh?  What is with this place not carrying the things I want?  Grr.  Ok, so where can I get them? \"A store a block away carries them. You can get them and bring them here and we can put them on your cake.\"\n\nWow, how convenient for me (living in Tracy at the time).  Really?  It's too great an effort for someone from the shop to go a half block away, get the dang brides and hell, charge me double, I don't care!  Nice customer service.\n\nSo one of our SF friendies ran over there, got the brides and took them to the bakery about a week before the wedding.\n\nI got no less than 4 phone calls to confirm this or that about my order. Huh?  And the night before my wedding, I got a call asking what I wanted on the top of my cake.  You have GOT to be kidding me.  Really?  The NIGHT BEFORE MY WEDDING you want to get on my nerve?  You think you know Bridezillas?  You should be running, boy.  Keeping my most calm tone, I calmly (through gritted teeth) informed him of the situation, to get the following response: \"Oh. Got 'em!\"  I then calmly (still gritting) said, \"Look. My wedding is TOMORROW.  Will there be any problems on your end?  If so, I need to know now.  Because all these phone calls are getting this bride VERY NERVOUS.\"  He assured me that everytthing was hunky-dory.  Right, as if he had a cloodle what was going on.\n\nHow many freakin' people do they have working there to have such horrible inter-office communications.........?  Ok, so anyway, my friend goes to pick everything up on the morning of the wedding, and the kid hands her 1 box of cupcakes and the cake and stands there. \"Um, where's the rest?\"  He looks.  Brings back one more box. \"Uh, excuse me, where are the REST?\"  He goes back, gets another box.  Alright, almost there...  \"Dude, there are 80 cupcakes in the order!  Where are the rest???\"  Now she is losing it.  Finally he brings the rest of the cupcakes and tiered stands and she's outta there.\n\nCake was fab. Freaking deeeeliciousssssnesss times a million.  It was white cake with fudge filling and fondant.  Like crack.\n\nEveryone raved about the cupcakes, so that is good.\n\nNext day when my friend went to return the tiered stands, some kid got all pissy with her, saying that there were parts missing.  Hearing the hubbub, the manager (or someone) came over and said no, it's all here and thanked my friend.  She was SO DONE with NVB and I bet she'll never set foot in there again.  And it's totally in her hood.  Hmm. Not good.\n\nSo regarding customer service and all, this place gets about a 1 star.  I'm pretty sure their whole staff smokes a fatty right before their shift starts.  At least that is how it seemed from my end.\nBut their stuff is so good, that would get 5 stars.\nSo overall, 3 stars.", "author": "Dele P."}

Unfortunately, Ritual didn't have the chocolate cupcake with salty fudgy frosting, so I yelped cupcakes and decided on Noe Valley Bakery and Bread Company as the closest high ranking cupcakery near me.\n\nI got the vanilla cupcake.  Butter frosting.  I am not a fan of butter frosting...I like sour cream frosting and cream cheese frosting, and cream frosting...but not butter frosting.  I think it's too hard and doesn't go well with the soft crumbly goodness of cake. \n\nBut....I also got a loaf of their double raisin bread, thinking I would eat some tomorrow.  Well, of course I wanted to try just a bite, just a tiny little taste.  I haven't been able to stop eating it since that first bite.  I think there's a whole box of raisins in the loaf.  And I am not even a huge fan of raisins...but it's really good in this loaf.  It's divine... and the bread is...moist?  I don't know how else to describe it.\n\nSo, not the cupcake I wanted, but an unexpected raisin pleasure. \nOh, and the guy at the cash register was so nice.  \nGuy: What would you like?\nMe: Hmmm...Vanilla cupcake\nGuy: Will that be it?\nMe: Oh, wait, the double raisin loaf.\nGuy: That will be all?\nMe: Oh, and a small coffee as well.\n(all this while the line behind me gets longer and longer).\n\nMe...afflicted with inability to make up my mind before I get to the cash register....\n\nOh, oh, and they sell challah bread!

However, I will mention the Hostessy chocolate cupcake with a cream filling as being moist and obliterating the memory of the vanilla cupcake with the butter frosting. \n\nBut, I am still more enthralled by their breads.  They had the most delicious Asiago Cheese Bread...crusty cheese exterior...and a core of Asiago Cheese enlivening the delicious bread.  While we walked over to Ritual to partake of coffee and cupcakes, we managed to devour most of the Asiago Cheese Bread.  \n\nSteph was saying that she wished she could toast the bread.  Over the next couple of mornings, I toasted the little bit of bread leftover.  Very delicious toasted.

Also excellent pastries (the apple turnovers deserve special mention), cookies, and bread.  But really, let's focus on cake.  \n\nNoe Valley Bakery did our wedding cake 5 years ago: hazelnut sponge, whipped chocolate cream filling, and dark chocolate ganache icing.  It was so delicious and amazing that I have been dreaming about that cake for the past 5 years.  I wanted it so much that I decided that I had to have it for our anniversary.  Of course, like an idiot I didn't call them until Thursday afternoon when I needed it on Saturday.  Initially they were dubious about their ability to have the cake ready by then and told me that I should have given them at least one more day's notice.  But I told the guy on the phone that it was our anniversary and that I NEEDED to have this cake.  He checked with the actual bakers in the back room, told them the story, and returned to tell me that they would be able and happy to do my anniversary cake.  I was delighted.  I was even able to pay over the phone so a friend of mine could pick the cake up for me en route to the party.  When cake time arrived, everyone oohed and ahhed, but then once they started eating, there was silence.  No one could be bothered to chat because they were too busy having their worlds rocked by the best cake on earth.\n\nI will not be waiting another 5 years between cakes, however.

Case in point - the cakes alone are almost always a winner in and of themselves.  If you can't make a decent cake you are already out of the game.  But it's the frosting that is the tipping point, the make it or break it point, that will either put you in cupcake history or mediocrity.  Here, I hate to say it but either the frosting on some were an acquired taste or else just too thick and sweet.  Their most-ess cake was interesting and probably okay at best.  Their velvet cupcake had this sweet frosting that almost made me want to scrape off.  And a couple of others were just not memorable. \n\nIt's too bad.  I just want all cupcakes to be enjoyable.

I used to be a regular customer at this bakery and have frequently made large purchases of cupcakes as well just the occassional treat.   Last week I decided to spend the extra cash, go all out and get a fancy birthday cake for my son's 9th birthday.  Now, keep in mind that 9 year olds don't care where the cake is from and will be perfectly happy with a cake from Safeway....which is where I should have purchased the cake from the beginning. \n\nIt started with the order....I called NVB and placed an order for a 1/4 sheet cake, chocolate chiffon cake with chocolate fudge filling and frosting.  I also picked their stock transfer/decoration of a racecar.   The girl taking my order informed me that I could not choose this combo and had to pick chocolate buttercream filling and frosting, otherwise the racecar wouldn't come out.   Well I really dislike chocolate buttercream so I told her to forget about the decoration....let's just go for the flavor that I wanted, and I'd throw decorations on myself.   Although she was trying to be helpful, she said to wait and she would talk to the decorator to see if she could make it happen the way I wanted it.   They called me back later in the day and said that they could do it afterall!  I was happy.\n\nUntil my husband picked up the cake 2 hours before the party.  It was a sheet cake alright.  And it had a racecar on it alright.  And sadly....it was about 10 pounds of chocolate buttercream!  No Way.  Five days advance notice, $60 dollars later, 3 back and forth phone calls and I GET THE WRONG FLAVOR CAKE???  With all that buttercream the cake tasted like a big slice of frosting.  I am not kidding, no child at the party finished their cake let alone went back for seconds and the remainder of my $60 birthday cake was left at Malibu Grand Prix.  WHAT A WASTE.\n\nI am so annoyed at this.  I called the bakery to try and complain but the manager's were too busy to take the call.  I then emailed as they told me to do, but no response as of yet.  I was completely flexible throughout the order process and was willing to have a bare cake with no decorating even, just so long as it was the flavor we wanted.  I regret going here and will never order a cake or cupcakes again from NVB.\n\nEDIT:  I did finally receive an email back from the owner and she was very nice, even offered me a full refund or a new cake.  That being said, I will change my rating.  I still love their cupcakes and appreciated the acknowledgment.", "author": "Nicole T."}

Their cupcakes are amazing and this is now our go-to place for cupcakes and other pastries. First off, the red velvet cupcakes here are sooooo good. They are super moist and just the right amount of sweetness. The frosting is also perfect, not too sweet and not too plain. The other cupcakes they offer are also really good! The hostess-looking cupcake is really delicious, especially with the cream-filling. The lemon-drop cupcake has a nice zing to it. And the carrot cupcake is perfect, just like the red velvet cupcake! delish! Also my sister gets the personal-size cheesecakes from here and it looked and tasted amazing!\n\nI really like the location of this bakery. A lot of restaurants and clothing stores in the neighborhood. There is also a lot of metered parking so it shouldn't be too tough to find parking.", "author": "Christiana R."}

Didn't want to order the 2 tier cake for $160 but I loved the little butterflies and flowers designed on it so I asked the lady there if I can order an 8 inch round cake with the same designs as the 2 tier cake. She tried asking the owner of the store but he was much too in a rush to leave and told me to fill out a special request cake order form. I did that and was told I would receive an email from the owner today. I waited and waited still no email until 2 pm. I already found a different bakery (Sweet Art by Jennifer).

What ecstasy!  Everything was wonderful from the Mexican wedding cookies to the apricot hammentashen, to my personal favorite, the chocolate and cherry rugelach.

Nothing is dry or too moist.  Their counter people are very nice, attentive and helpful.  \n\nMy one gripe came just recently, when I ordered a birthday cake.  First of all I tried to email them, asking if I could provide my order via email.  This was a few days before my desired date.  No response.  So I figured to go in to make sure I can order and get it by that Saturday.  I went over my choices w/ my sales lady, and requested the \"Parisian\" trim, which costs an extra $4.  The day comes to pick it up; a Saturday, and mid-day Saturday on 24th Street is not always easy so I had my niece pick up the cake while I went around the block.  She said it looked good and we went on our merry way.   \n\nI get the cake home and only later to find the my Parisian trim wasn't done!  The cake, filling & frosting were fine.   I was pretty disappointed because the trim that was on there was (1) something that even I could've done and (2) wasn't even offered!  What happened?  Did the decorator do mine last and got lazy?  I later wrote an email about this to the email address provided on their website.  Only today, three and a half weeks later, did I even get any kind of response.\n\nI'd advise not to get the chocolate fudge frosting w/ the chiffon cake.  It was a bit too heavy to be on top of the cake.  It would be better off as a filling instead.  It was really good, like mouth-smacking because it was nice and thick!\n\nDon't ever try to email them about anything that has a time constraint. If they can't even respond to an email on time then they shouldn't provide it!  Also as a baker, details matter.  As minor a detail as what I wanted was, it still wasn't done and that is disappointing.\n\nSo despite the snafu, everything is a hit, from bread to cookies to cakes and tarts.", "author": "Benita E."}

I cant buy anyone, thinking the goods or service , are great.They ,  are not. I think they do a few items well, but fall short on most.  Check out the \"shut your pie hole\" on staffs t shirt, also , if you are in line, don't expect to sample any goods, in 13 years, they do not give samples. Very un-generous.

This time we tried the red velvet, zinger and of course the Most-est. The red velvet cake was denser than their other cupcakes and not as \"red\" as other places, but the frosting was GREAT. Not a straight up cream cheese flavor, but not too sweet either.  The Zinger had a fluffy and light whipped rasberry filling, and also delish (and I don't even like coconut!) The Most-est was its usual delicious self. $2.75 for filled cupcakes and available whenever I get the cupcake crave? FIVE Stars! \n****\nThis is a review of their cupcakes only. Just had some of their cupcakes at a birthday party, and boy oh boy, are these TASTY! and flavorful. Tried the carrot and Most-est (their homemade version of a chocolate hostess cupcake with the white icing squiggle) cupcakes. The carrot cake was perfectly dense, filled with all sorts of goodness (carrots, nuts, spice) and the cream cheese frosting is very light and fluffy. The Most-est cake is not very dense, but the cake part is very soft and moist., and the cream in the middle, Yu-hm. The ganache top pairs with the cake perfectly. I could of eaten another two of those easily. The cake to frosting ratio is just right. Definitely on par with Sibby's in texture and tastiness. At $2/cupcake definitely a great value.

However, my excitement quickly turned into disappointment when i bit into this cupcake. Between my boyfriend and I we tried the Lemon, red velvet, and the fleur de Sel cupcakes. We both whole heartedly agree that this place knows how to make cake. The cake part was DELICIOUS! Perfectly moist, except that the two filled ones (the lemon and the fleur de Sel) had way too much filling thus taking away from the moist yummy cake. The frosting was not as yummy as the cake. I love frosting, i think that's what makes cupcakes so delicious, the perfect cake to frosting ratio. However, the frosting on these cupcakes was way too sweet and ganache tasting. I wasn't feeling it. I actually peeled the frosting off of the Fleur de Sel cupcake and threw it in the garbage. Thumbs down. \nIf the frosting on these cupcakes was more creamy i'd give them a 5 star review. The 3 stars is solely based on cupcakes.

I first got turned onto it one morning when my hot water tank blew, and my landlord was not around to let anyone in to repair it, so my neighbors let me shower in their apartment. When I got out, they offered me breakfast--tea from Spike's and a thick slab of NVB's fig bread, toasted and slathered in butter. At the time, I thought it was terrific. But now I wonder if it was just the hospitality that made it taste so good. Because I've since bought the fig bread again, tried a cookie, an eclair, a quiche, and a couple of cupcakes (over many, many months, mind you; I don't have THAT much of a sweet tooth!), and none of them have wowed me. They are all fine, but to be honest, they're a little bland. I think I will stick to buying my fresh breads at Pasta Gina and my tasty-yummies at Tartine.", "author": "Lara F."}

First off, beyond showing me the order book, the counter person was not very helpful. When I told him that I wanted to try something that would give me an idea of what their cakes tasted like, he told me that there wasn't anything. He said that the cupcake batter was completely different than the cake batter and the mousse cupcake was different too.\nI ended up buying a mousse and a Most-ess.\nCompared to a chocolate cupcake with butter cream from Miette, the Most-est had no flavor. My friend stated that she would have preferred a real Hostess cupcake.\nCompared to a chocolate mousse from Citizen Cake, the mousse was bland and uninteresting. After sampling it, we threw the other 1/2 of it away because it wasn't worth wasting calories. (it's not every day that I throw away chocolate mousse!)\n\nMaybe it's unfair to compare it to the other 2 bakeries since it's in a lower price category, but I doubt that I would make a trip to Noe Valley for the cupcakes.

The weaknesses: The staff always seem like they have better things to do (at best) and even treat you like they don't want you in their store. I ordered a birthday cake. The person who took my order seemed to be in a hurry and asked the name of the birthday person. I gave the name and that seemed to be it. When I picked up the cake, only the name was on the BIRTHDAY cake, but no 'Happy Birthday.' The clerk looked at me as though I was asking for the moon, and VERY reluctantly sent it back to have the problem fixed. When they slapped a piece of fondant over the cake with 'Happy Birthday' written on it, they shoved the cake in front of me, and rather meanly said 'Is this OK?\" I was ordering a birthday cake. They make plenty of personalized birthday cakes. I think they should know that 'Happy Birthday' usually appears on these cakes. Anyway, even if they didn't (doubt it, though), they seemed to have forgotten that 'the customer is always right.' I will not order cakes from them again, no matter how tasty.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-10-13", "description": "I have been going to Noe Valley Bakery for their muffins and cookies for a long time, and have always been happy.\n\nWhen my mother recently asked me to help her find a bakery that could make three custom birthday cakes, I checked out Noe Valley Bakery. Most other bakeries in the city seemed to make really expensive, over the top, sculptural cakes. All my mother wanted was a cake with a drawing of a princess, one with a drawing of a pirate or captain hook or some vaguely Peter Pan theme, and one with a golf theme. \n\nThe Noe Valley Bakery site indicated that they would be able to do this type of simple illustration no problem. The website advertised their custom cakes and how you could work with the cake decorator to create the design, etc. Under \"Custom Designs\" on the \"Design Your Own Cake\" section, they state that \"each design is a carefully hand-rendered work of art in frosting.\" They list the prices for custom designs starting at 6\" for $21. They show several examples of custom designs they have done in the past. Simple, frosting illustrations. Just what we needed.\n\nMy mother made the trip to Noe Valley Bakery from her home in Marin to place the order. When she got there, the salesperson behind the counter told her that they did not actually do custom frosting designs on cakes, and that she would either have to choose one of their standard designs or bring in a photograph that they could scan onto the cake. My mother cited the website, and the salesperson told her that the website was wrong. Disappointed, my mother still placed the order for 3 6\", 2 layer cakes, and went off to find a photo of a princess, captain hook, and something golf related to bring back to scan on the cake.\n\nWhen my mom told me of her experience, I immediately called the bakery to find out what happened. I felt bad that I had recommended such a dud of a bakery and I felt like they might just be taking advantage of my 64 year old mother.\n\nThe salesperson who answered the phone when I called was beyond rude. I first asked if they did custom cakes, and he said that yes, they do. I told him of my mother's experience and he said that although they do offer custom cake illustrations, they discourage it (note: why discourage one of the services you offer??). He seemed incredibly annoyed to have to talk to me about custom cakes and he seemed to continually want to direct me to their standard designs or the photo scans. He said that the original salesperson probably said no to the  custom designs because the designs were too complicated. I told him that she only wanted a princess, a pirate, and a golf theme. Not complicated. Plus, she was flexible in how those would be executed. Basically he just threw me a bunch of BS. I explained that she really wanted the hand drawn frosting illustration and not the photo scan, and asked him how much that would cost. He said that a custom design starts at $45. I was surprised and said that on the website it states that the 6\" custom design starts at $21. He said that is the price for the cake. I said ok, but the website should be updated because that is not how it reads.  He said \"I can't control what is on the website.\" I informed him that clearly I understood that he was not the web developer but that I just wanted him to know about the misinformation portrayed on the site. After much discussion, he said that if my mother would bring in photos that the cake designer could copy, they could do the custom illustration.\n\nSince they were so uncooperative and really quite nasty, my mother decided to simply buy some toys at Target and place them on the finished cakes. She did, however, go in once more because she wanted to change the \"Happy Birthday\" wording on one of the cakes. Even though they had not yet started the cakes, they were reluctant to change the wording. Eventually they did. \n\nAt that time, she also asked for a refund for the custom photo scan for each cake that she had already paid for, since she was no longer going to be using that service. She unfortunately didn't have her receipt on her. The same nasty guy that was on the phone with me was helping her, and told that since she didn't have the receipt, how was he supposed to know that she even paid for it in the first place. She told him that she was told she had to pay in full when the order was placed, so of course it was paid for as evidenced of he order being placed! She told him to find their copy of her credit card receipt in their files and refund the extra charge. Then she marched out.\n\nThe cakes, in the end were fine. Not great. Fine. They each just had a simple \"Happy Birthday\" message written on them. We decorated them with the toys ourselves. She could have gotten them at the bakery down the street from her house since they didn't have any custom drawings. \n\nTotal waste of time and energy to go all the way to Noe Valley Bakery. They need to update their website and train their staff in customer service.", "author": "Elana W."}

Their bread is decent, the fig and apricot and interesting and the raisin is great because it's more raisin than loaf, which I like. The 7x7 grain bread was disappointing though, the flavor was just not good and the texture was both crumbly and dry. Onion/sesame baguettes, delish. Their oatmeal raisin cookies are great if you like them very dense and not soft, snickerdoodles and gingersnaps are just ok. Their rugeleh is to die for however, the pastry is denser than I'm used to but good and the fillings are not skimped on. The scones are good and they sell the dough for that and their oatmeal cookies if you want to make it at home, which is nice. The service is pretty shockingly distant, I've never seen people surrounded by that much yummy stuff be so unexcited to be there. I was really excited at first when I found the place but now that the newness has worn off I have to say, the products (esp. pastries) are very expensive for what they are. I go back for the breadsticks and the raisin loaf/onion baguette.", "author": "Allie D."}

Today I bought a Strawberry Rhubarb pie to take to a work function and it was pure heaven in a pie plate. I take my fruit pie seriously and it is crazy hard to find the perfection I had today, even in the 'food is oxygen' city of San Francisco. I'll start with the crust: it had the decadence and substantialness of a butter crust but still managed to be crisp, flakey and not at all bread-y. The fruit layer was really generous, avoided being overly sweet and held up well to baking (i.e. did not turn to the consistency of chunky fruit puree after being baked). Chunks of tart rhubard interspersed amongst layer upon layer of delicately sliced and flavorful strawberries. Let's return to the crust, shall we? Even the bottom layer had a good amount of snap to it! Writing this review kinda makes me want to try all their other flavors ASAP (I mean like this weekend) but I'll try to pace myself.

The best one I have tried since I went to Magnolia bakery in NYC about 3 years ago was just last month at another bake shop in NYC this time in the Lower East Side - unfortunately I forgot the name. I do remember is how giddy it made me - plus since I'm pregnant at the moment every meal of the day involves some type of sweet! Well I was just as happy and giddy when I saw the cute cupcakes in the window of the Noe Vally Bakery.  My sister and I bought the Boston Creme and the lemon one to share. Normally I never do this but I found the chocolate ganache overwhelming and the vanilla cake of the Bostom Creme to be dry. The creme filling was almost non-existent - I guess I was hoping it was going to come at me like a chocolate custard bar. However, the lemon cupcake with the cute little bumblebee created by frosting made up for it. The cake was very moist - the filling abundant and the lemon frosting - perfect! I'll go back to get another and maybe this time I will try the Red Velvet or Carrot Cake - just not the Boston Creme ever again.
