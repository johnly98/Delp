I got some type of alcoholic apple cider (forgot the name since my friend ordered it for me). My drink was very good and was also my first time trying hard apple cider. I also sampled one of my friend's whiskey sours drink from the bar counter which I liked more than my hard cider.\n\nThis bar also has darts for you and your group to play with, while having some type of sports show to watch on TV.

What they do have is a large (and solid) draft selection, a neat atmosphere, reasonable prices, and little fanfare.\n\nWe happened by on a mid Saturday afternoon, and the atmosphere was just right - a few people around so that it didn't feel empty, but quiet enough you could happily carry on a conversation, and you didn't have to wait for the bartender.\n\nThe bartender was also nice enough to let our friends play some music while we relaxed. There's ample seating, too, which was a wonderful attribute for our group.\n\nI got a heretic chocolate hazelnut porter and a Wyder's Pear Cider, both of which were delicious. $14 for two pints ain't bad, either.

One of my favorite places to watch any sporting event since they have so many TVs and a lot of seats all over the place! They don't employ too many waitresses, but the couple they have during big game days (such as WARRIORS CHAMPIONSHIP RUNS!) do a great job of making rounds. Guess what, they also now take credit card! For the longest time, they were cash only. That was the only drawback. Problem solved!\n\nYou're also allowed to get food from surrounding places and eat inside Yancy's. They don't serve any food, so it's awesome you can pick up some Pizza from the corner or garlic noodles down the block. It's not fancy inside, but it's not called \"Fancy's\". There's little air flow in the back, so on crowded game days, it can get quite sweaty back there. \n\nOn other days, it's fun to come and play darts (there are 3 boards in the back).

Seems to hang outside smoking or focused on his phone.  Clearly just a job for him.  Too bad, because I like the music he plays - bluegrass, folk, delta blues - have complimented him several times on his taste, thinking he might open up as to his musical background - no luck.

My friend transferred her out-of-state driver's license to a California license last week, and when she presented her temporary California license and her out-of-state license (not expired but with a hole punched through it) to the bartender he was extremely rude and refused to let her stay in the bar. His rationale was that people pass down expired licenses to their friends, which made no sense as her old license had her photo, her (over 21) birthdate, and an expiration date in 2021. If identification is suitable to give to a police officer during a traffic stop, I'd hope that it would also be suitable for admission into Yancy's Saloon. \n\nI understand that the bartender had to enforce the rules as he understood them (even if said rules were completely nonsensical) but the accusatory, aggressive, and rude manner in which he spoke to my friend humiliated her and made her cry.

It is all too necessary to have a local sports bar,  turned down a notch from the classiness of Inner Fog, casual and good for groups--whether it be for spontaneous hangouts or end-of-the-quarter celebrations with an objective of getting wasted in the early afternoon.  It is well within walking distance of 10 short blocks, though it easily goes unnoticed so it can be a bit difficult to find when you are wandering around the Inner Sunset in post-exam sleep-deprived delirium.\n\nIt's fairly spacious, with a notable large comfy loungey couch in front of the TV's in the main area.  There are a lot of tables, but the chairs have armrests so it gets awkward and clunky when you try to fit too many people around one table.\n\nNothing stands out in terms of drinks/bartenders, except the black velvet is quite popular and the layers look cool--the macchiato for after 5.  People who detest beer love the pear cider.  Beer selection is not amazing but okay.  Margaritas are too juicy.", "author": "Edna C."}

Sometimes I think we come here too often, however it's still one of our favorite spots. Although it's a \"sports\" bar, the atmosphere here is pretty relaxing and nice. Theres a diversity of groups here too. Another nice thing about Yancy's is that you may expect to run into some familiar faces every now and then. One of the best thing about Yancy's is that it's right next to a Pizza shop, so when you feel hungry you can always grab a pizza next door. Shots are relatively cheap in my opinion. The waitresses are very nice and attentive, they will come to your table and ask if you need anything instead of having to squeeze in at the bar. \n\nThere are TVs All over the bar and lots of tables and seats but when it gets crowded usually there will be no seats left. There is also a little room where there are 3 dart boards for a little more fun with friends. And if you ask them they usually have dices and cards. \n\nThe only downside is that this place is cash only so remember to go to the ATM first.", "author": "Lisa S."}

It all changed last night when we met the rude/racist bartender. He refused to give us darts and called us nasty! It was horrifying and very disappointing. I don't know what makes you think we are nasty but I sure hope you encounter some \"nasty\". We asked to keep our individual bar tabs open and he didn't like that. So I paid for the four of us and I thought it was fine after that but he walked away very rudely. Later, we asked for the darts, and he lied to us and said that three people had already given him ID's. we noticed that only two groups were playing and the middle dart board was free. So we were talking to the other two groups to see if someone else was playing and they said it had been available for a long while. They said \"we are leaving anyways so you can have ours\". I went with them to the bartender to give him my ID for the darts and he said \"no im not gonna give them to you\" and then said \"you guys are nasty\". I know people are racist but it is not okay to be openly racist like that. Do that crap in your house. If you want to refuse to Indian girls that put a board outside that says \"we are racist, Indians are not allowed\" and we will get the message. Don't be an asshole to five girls. We walked down the street and found a better bar with a pool table. Much better. They were nice and very friendly.", "author": "P W."}

I really wanted to throw some darts.\n\nI walked a few blocks and walked in. Sitting down at the bar at 7pm on a Thursday night, I found it pretty empty. I wasn't served immediately, but was helped shortly. I asked about happy hour, and was informed that it's from 2pm-7pm, dollar off pints of beer and bottles. Well, I just missed it, so I got my 5 dollar beer. They have a large selection of beers and a full bar.\n\nGrabbing my beer, I head to the darts area where some others were playing. There are 3 dart boards of terrible quality. They have been overly used, and should really be replaced soon. So, there are 3 dart boards in a row... and facing the boards I played on the most left board. I was up against the wall, and there were kegs of beer on the ground that were in the way. The middle board is the best board to play off of. The right board is in the way of people walking into the room. I pulled out my own darts (not trying to sound pretentious... I just like heavier darts. They have darts, but you have to let them hold your ID or something... not too sure about this. The most disappointing was the quality of the boards. They metal that create the circles around the bulls eyes and dividing the number sections is protruding. My darts have hit some and bounced off. Some also bounced all the way back to me... RAWR.\n\nI played darts and when I finished my drink, a staff member came over to clear my glass and asked if I wanted another beer. I said yes, and it was brought over to me. \n\nMeh, I'll see if I can find better dart boards in the area, but for now, I'll settle for the cheap bear and darts. \n\nThey have plants hanging around and large TVs.

I popped in post-taco, grabbed a spot at the bar and watched some Shark Week programming while waiting for my pals. It was a nice day out, so they had the windows open. I sat there, leaning in the dark comfort of the woody interior with my drink, wondering how it was possible that I was first. I shot a couple glances at some dude vogue-ing across the street , back to the sharks, back to my drink, and then to the oddly familiar-looking dude standing on the curb- my old pal, Yosemite Sam! That's not his real name, btw. But if they had the windows closed, I would have never seen my old friend, waiting. So, I'm a fan of their windows.\n\nThe lounging area is also pretty cool and instead of one of the wooden chairs, I claimed a spot on an old lounge-y sofa that made me feel like Lady Gaga.

Located on Irving at 9th Ave I believe.  Parking is never a problem.  Everytime we come here, we find parking right away.\n* Walk in and suit yourself.  Feel free to find a table or seats at the bar.  You're on your own here.  Make yourself comfortable like home!\n* Very soon, a host will come and greet you, check IDs, and take your order.  The girls are friendly and helpful.\n* Sip on your drinks while you enjoy complimentary popcorn! Oh the popcorn is much needed!\n\nOther things you should know..\n - They have flat screen TVs all around!\n - Dart room with 3 dart boards and tables are towards the back!\n - Draft beers are all $5! My snakebite (Guinness and cider was also $5)\n - you get your order, you pay right away at the table.  Whats better than NOT having to get out of your seat and to wait in line and pay for your drink at the bar?!\n - Shots are $5-8 ( according to the boyfriend) Depends on what you get!\n - Cocktails are delicious and strong here. Not watered down crap.\n\nOverall, Yancy's is one of those places where you will go and enjoy a drink..or a few and not need to feel stuffed and cramped.

There are also darts in the back and lots of TVs...so it's a good place to watch games too. \n\nDrinks are cheap! Only about $7 for strong stuff like AMFs and Long Islands. Granted they do use cheap alcohol...but if your aim is to get messed up, Yancy's will allow you to do it on a budget!

It's a fun place since it's a mixture of divy bar and sports bar, with a youngish Gen-X and Gen-Y crowd from nearby SFSU, USF and probably some of CCSF. And due to the vicinity to UCSF, there seem to be more grad students than undergrads? And you'll even hear people - who would never karaoke - sing along at times to whatever happens to be playing on the jukebox. Either way, it's a bar for fun drinking, not drunk drinking.\n\nFor this Wednesday at least, happy hour had $1-off beers on tap (e.g., $5 for a pint of Bass Ale) and $3 well drinks. It was a somewhat good evening since the Giants won, the A's won, but the MLS All-Stars lost to the EPL's Everton in penalties - but it was due to the top-notch play of US soccer Men's National Team's starting goalkeeper Tim Howard (go Timmay!).", "author": "Peter L."}

But here's the thing that gets me, being told by the waitress that we should order from her since those are her tables. Okay, that makes total sense, but she never comes. As in, she tells us she'll be with us in a moment, doesnt show up until 20 minutes later. We ask for more popcorn (which costs $1 jtlyk), she never delivers. At some point, we stopped ordering from her and basically just started going up to the bar and ordering ourselves. Let's be honest, when a girl wants her drank, a girl wants her drank. But in her defense, she was more attentive later on in the night, maybe its because the crowd died down or maybe because D and a few other friends were ordering more and more hard liquor.\n\nBtw, they have cards.

It's the bar where most first time drinkers lose their alcohol virginity and idealism.\r\n\r\nOn weekdays between noon and 7pm, it's a great place to study as it's empty, quiet, and void of distraction.  Because the service is slower than evolution, it's the perfect place to be if you do not want to be bothered by a waitress who really couldn't care less if you wanted service.  This is an example of where bad service can actually be benefiical to one's education.\r\n\r\nThere's a dartboard and they have dice available.  The interior slightly stairs up to a seating area with a few couches and tables.\r\n\r\nSometimes, George and the Wonders perform reggae music.  Not sure if they still come around.\r\n\r\nIt's usually a good first bar to meet at or last bar to go to when the night's over.  If you are a college student, you will love this bar and most probably will give it 5 stars.\r\n\r\nI've never had a meaningful conversation here.

We called ahead to see if the soccer game was going to be on the big screen so we were shocked.  He changed it back when we made a fuss.  Giants scored 3 in the first inning so he came back and changed the channel.  We moved and were a little upset and talked trash to the people next to us who were also watching the soccer game.\n\nOkay, so did say the bartender was an \"a-hole\" but it wasn't to his face and it wasn't loud so I suspect he was watching us because all of sudden he was in my friends' face telling him to \"f-off\" and that he was the \"a-hole\".  My friend, he's the nicest guy in the world and it's hard to get mad at him with his boyish charm.

I was in heaven when I discovered I live only two blocks from Strongbow on tap... lovely.\n\nYancy's is a great place. They have darts, huge TVs, popcorn for free snacking and they play great music. Also local pizza places such as Pasquale's Pizza (get the pesto cheese bread, appetizer) will delivery to the bar! You can bring in your own food. It was a great spot to watch the world series, you just had to get their 2 hrs in advance though. \n\nIf you haven't tried strongbow...... go to Yancy's.\n\n-JF", "author": "Jenna F."}

The wall decor and ferns everywhere gives this neighborhood bar a very homey feel, which is the idea I suppose. It was also my first time seeing an actual area dedicated for darts, which is pretty cool. There were makeshift tables from old school tabletop video arcades.

They will never, ever, comp you a round.  I've seen the son of the owner sell a seven dollar drink to someone who could barely speak they were so drunk and then three minutes later take it away from the same person saying they were too drunk.  The brunette bartender is simply a miserable person to have to interact with.  I'll do anything I can to avoid her.\n\nIt's a great place.

A hearty assortment of restaurants sit within walking distance, and the N-Judah stops 50 yards from Yancy's front door.  The crowd ain't chatty....but this can be a card in your favor if you're looking to escape the scene with  someone you just met at the Blackthorn or the Mucky Duck.  It's less of a destination and more of a getaway....a place to chill-out instead of pick-up.  If you're in the hood, stop by to check it out....but if you're not, don't make it a destination.", "author": "Mike W."}

It's easy to get free drinks here from your drunk friends when they're ordering a round of shots for everyone. But your friends might be different. \n\nEven so, Yancy's has a really cool decor that I find myself staring at when I don't understand what's going on in the games that are airing on the tv's around the place. There are dartboards in the back, next to the bathrooms and they have a pretty good selection of music. Granted, they'll succumb to playing Journey's \"Don't Stop Believing\" and Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" but for the most part, I've heard Cake, Weezer, along with some Radiohead. When I'm able to hear the music that is over HOW LOUD THIS BAR IS. That's the nature of bars, I understand but a space this large, sound likes to fill it. I like the bartenders, gave me free shots on my birthday and they know how to pour a stiff drink. My girlfriend likes this place cos they have cider on tap and she's not much of a beer drinker. Plus this place is roomy, they have a loong saloon space for tables and chairs and oftentimes, they'll have a cocktail waitress come and take your order, so your chair isn't in danger of being nabbed. \n\nAlso I hear rumors that the pizza place Pasquale's down the street will deliver pizza to you right inside of Yancy's.", "author": "Dena R."}

If anything else it makes you appreciate your regular surroundings that much more. Case in point: Yancy's Saloon.\n\nThe other day two of my friends had some news for me. Going the melodramatic route, they took me out of downtown to the Sunset a la two parents taking a child to dinner to announce their divorce (fyi: their news wasn't that earthshattering). After their announcement we needed a libation to lighten the mood. Yancy's looked promising and hey the three o of us all have a love for saloons so in we went. \n\nThe subdued vibe sat well with me at first that Thursday night. Yancy's had all the kick back feel of a good happy hour though it was way past any \"appropriate\" happy hour time. People were lazily playing darts, sipping beers, sitting around tables just enjoying some peace with their beer and companions. I eagerly enjoyed watching the 49ers preseason game while talking smack about one of my drinking companions love of the Raiders between swigs of beer. I instantly noticed though that when a bar is quiet, my voice carries like a horn on the bay through the fog (i.e. you can hear it everywhere). Once this discovery was made, I had a newfound appreciation for bar noise everywhere. \n\nThe decor is what eventually became a defining factor for me. My aforementioned drinking buddy squawked out \"hey doesn't this remind you of TGI Fridays or Applebees back in Milpitas or Fremont?\". Once that thought was in mind, I had to agree. Then my other drinking partner commented that he felt more like he was in St. Elmo's Fire. At that point I mentally started scanning for some Emilo Estevez look alike. Instead, I felt like a cast for an updated version had been dispatched. Feelings of masters programs vs. work and do we move into together/ get married, were in the air. That's when I felt the underlying vibe of suburbia of the bar and neighborhood. Call me crazy but I can deal with the nuttiness of downtown much easier than the feeling of a domestic night out. Worth a pop in for a couple of reasonably priced beers and maybe a ball game but I don't think I'd go here without company. Cheers.", "author": "Veronica G."}

I was a little apprehensive to go into a dark bar on such a beautiful sunny day in January. But I brought it up so I had to comply.\n\nThe bar is great. It's clean, it's comfortable and it's a decent sized place. There were several hanging plants and lovely old school hanging lamps. \n\nWe grabbed some tables in the front of the bar.

I helped break it in yesterday.  (One down, two to go!)\n===\n\nThe other reviewers have the drink/big tv/sports bar stuff covered well, so I will target the darting experience.  Pun intended, deal with it.\n\nRather than get my younger brother some stupid gift from ThinkGeek on his last birthday I thought it would be cool to mix it up and buy him a set of pro darts.  He doesn't throw darts, but he's a guy and guys like any game where you can potentially lose an eye when the fun's over.\n\nBut I'm a guy too and I realized that if he's going to have 24gram pro darts, I've got to get myself a set of 25g darts and practice prior to his birthday so that, when he comes to SF for a visit, I can beat his smarmy twentysomething ass.

The throw lines are clearly marked and there are plently of pens and paper pads for keeping score.  The waitress does a great job of keeping us well supplied with Fat Tire and Guinness.  This is important and appreciated.\n\nThe Bad\nDartboards themselves look like they've been broken in at a military range.  Time to replace the dartboards folks.  Once a decade whether they need it or not.  Consequently, darts frequently ricochet off the frayed metal boundaries.  Someone is definitely going to lose an eye.\n\nConclusion\nDespite the bad part, the social atmosphere and proximity to my neighborhood makes it worth visiting every now and then, but I'm still looking for better options.\n\nAnd, yes, I kicked his ass.

I brought my friend here for the first time and she couldn't stand it, so we chilled out front to let the aroma dissipate. Unfortunately it didn't and oozed it's way out onto the front sidewalk. Growing up with a dad and brother who I'd have farting matches with, the smell of butt is something I'm used to, I don't like it, but I can deal. My friend, however, couldn't. So we had to go somewhere else. \"Does it always smell THIS bad?\"  \"The bar or my farts? Because if we're talking about the latter, then no, it's usually much worse. The former, far better.\"\n\nTwo thumbs up!", "author": "Sol V."}

I thought about going in yesterday when I was in the neighborhood, but then I realized it wasn't even 3pm yet. A little early to get started on a Wednesday, but it's just such a nice relaxing space. I once spent four hours here with people just drinking beer and playing dice. If you don't like dice they also have darts. If you don't like darts they also have alcohol and a big screen TV for sports. I will say that this is not a bar I visit for a nice cocktail though. It's really more of a beer and straight alcohol bar.", "author": "J F."}

It is somewhere you can go in jeans and a sweater after dinner, or without feeling like you have to put too much effort in getting ready for.  Definitely a fun place for a low key Saturday night where you want to go out and drink, but without having to deal with the scene downtown or at some trendy club.

There was no apology, and the bar management refused to offer any recourse, citing \"this guy has been like this since second grade\". We're all for good bar fun and humor, but this was ridiculous.

The bartenders are friendly and usually remember you if you come in regularly.  The place gets pretty packed on Friday and Saturday nights but it makes for fun people watching!  Every sports channel imaginable and SpikeTV are usually on every tv.  Its a good spot for me and the hubby or with a group of friends.", "author": "Lori A."}

I like the atmosphere, and the abundance of seats, but its just sorta blah. The bartenders aren't too friendly, its cash only, and I guess I've just never had a very memorable experience here. It is down the street though, which is definitely the reason for some of the stars...and you can bring food in, but other than that it's just so-so.", "author": "Annie L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-12-21", "description": "for many years, yancy's was my \"cheers.\"  i was born and raised in the sunset and went to elementary school at st. anne's just a few blocks away.  so i guess it was only natural that when my buddies and i returned from college, looking for a watering hole to call home, we ended up here.  and i can tell you that i've spent more money, put away more beers, and lost more games of darts here than i care to remember.  (and i've probably played \"freebird\" on the jukebox more times than lynyrd skynyrd has ever actually performed it.)  i can remember new year's eve there 1997(?), the last night you could legally smoke in a bar in california.  that was a great night.  over the years, i've seen bartenders and waitresses come and go.  but they've always been great.  and there are a helluva lot more tv sets in there now.  making yancy's much more of a sports bar than it used to be.  but the crowd has generally remained the same:  locals, old timers, college kids, med and nursing students from ucsf, and sports fans on game nights.  i don't get out there too often any more, but i try to visit whenever i'm in town.  they're still cash only, which is probably a good thing, cause if you could start a tab, you'd probably end up drinking way too much.  but the bottom line is:  comfortable, friendly, fun.  can get a bit crowded on the weekends or on game nights.  but some of the most enjoyable nights of my life have been spent with my buddies at yancy's playing liar's dice over some beers and pizza from milano's.  try it.  you'll love it.", "author": "Feodor C."}
