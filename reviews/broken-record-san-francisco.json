The bartender sucked. We stood by the bar, drink-less, with money in our hands... and he sat and conversed with the people sitting at the bar. We finally had to ask for drinks.\n\nThe poor lady running the food area needed some serious help... she had a couple guys that seemed to be supposed to be working, but it looked like she was doing the majority of the work on her own. 3 of us ordered food, my crab grilled cheese was good, and the fries were standard, but everything else was not delicious. \n\nWe drove over an hour for this disappointment... my suggestion would be to save your time and your money!", "author": "Heather E."}

Let's be honest, a bar is a bar is a bar. The drink selection is good and poured cold and fast. Originally, I came here and RAVED about the menu from James Moisey and Shane LaValley (of RickyBobby RIP). Then Margo Cristein and Annie Wood, who also co-own Fremont New American restaurant The Vine took over in the kitchen. Frankly, the food was instantly different with more fried food (lots of tots) and was not as good as previously. I came back after a year or more of not going to Broken Record on Saturday....who is the chef now?\n\nThey didn't have mac n cheese of any kind. Or...two other things the very nice lady listed. It's not a huge menu. I ended up with Chili Cheese Fries.\n\nI ate four fries and left. The entire plate (minus four fries), I left there. \n\nIt tasted like salt and cheap chili powder. The tequila creme was not tangy or sweet enough. The chili was so bad it was inedible. The cheese was American cheese, I believe. Thirty five minutes to receive Chili Cheese Fries that were somehow worse than the Chili Cheese Fries at  Del Taco. At least Del Taco has some flavor. How do you even make Chili with no flavor?\n\nHow do you not have something on the menu? There are restaurant supply places and Costco and Safeway. I'm just...so disappointed.\n\nAlso, the whole place, which has always been a dive, just looked dirtier.", "author": "Tara H."}

One star less because we seem to have an issue with getting all our food on occasion. I know it can get crazy but sometimes we have to go and ask for our missing items.

The crowd here is also very friendly and unpretentious. We're talking proper \"sorrys\" and \"excuse mes\" if you accidentally bump in to folks here, as opposed to being shoved aside unapologetically by entitled Marina types.

So much deliciousness at perfectly reasonable prices - whether a burger that comes with a fried egg and Niman Ranch beef, the poutine, the fried catfish, or even a pot pie. \n\nAll in all, a winning establishment that's not only a great part of the neighborhood but is also worth the trek if you're coming from elsewhere.", "author": "Vincent L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-17", "description": "The 'bar' (pun intended) on the savory comfort food prepared at this popular dive bar, in the Crocker-Amazon neighborhood, has been set pretty high . The Food Network first gave them some notoriety and a 4.5 star rating on Yelp with over a thousand reviews suggest the food here was worth trying.\n\nFeatured on an episode of the Food Network's Diners, Dives and Drive-ins, patrons suggested the crispy tiger prawn sandwich, duck confit potato skins and the oxtail pancheta. Unfortunately, none of these dishes were still on its constantly changing menu this evening.\n\nWe, instead, ordered the following dishes: the Crawdad Mac N' Cheese, Steamed Mussels, Mexican Corn, Braised Beef Ribs and Stuffed Snapper.\n\nMexican corn, $3. Who does not like elotes? This classical Mexican recipe is virtually fail-proof. It is roasted corn smothered with cotija cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream, cilantro leaves, lime juice and red chili pepper. The version here is bit creamier and more tangy, but still uses authentic ingredients. I also did not initially like the $3 price tag for one elote. (My perspective, however, may very much be skewed now that I am a Southern California resident that can get elotes from street vendors in Los Angeles and Santa Ana for $1.)\n\nStuffed snapper, $14. A generous sized red snapper that was layered over a bed of Cajun style rice and covered with a rich Creole sauce, this was probably my favorite dish. The sauce was savory, buttery smooth and had just a hint of heat to it. The fish was perfectly baked, moist and flaky.\n\nCrawfish mac and cheese $9. This twice baked mac and cheese dish, that was topped with breadcrumbs and garnished with parsley, was nearly flawlessly executed. It even had some of the Cajun spices that get it some heat. The creamy rich white cheddar cheese was spot on. I felt, however, that there could have been more crawdad (crawfish) meat in the dish.\n\nBraised rib $14, was smoky, peppery and had a unique flavor twist to it. I believe that 'secret' ingredient is Coke or Pepsi added to its marinade. I enjoyed the moist, tender meaty texture as the ribs fell right off the bone as you bit into one. Flavor-wise, I felt that the marinade lacked sweetness and also needed more of that vinegar tang.\n\nSteamed mussels $12, was a popular dish with the group this evening. I, however, was not too impressed. Perhaps I am just not a huge fan of mussels. They lacked flavor to me. The rich, buttery sauce did little to enhance it.\n\nWhile I was not entirely impressed with all our menu choices this evening, I would not say no to another opportunity to dine here again and try other dishes. I just hope shrimp and grits are on its menu next time.\n\nCASH ONLY", "author": "Andrew K."}

Their food did NOT disappoint - but the selection did, only because I'd read a lot of reviews beforehand and a lot of it wasn't on the menu that night! Their menu's constantly changing, so that only means I'll have to come back.\n\nTHE WAIT: None on a Thursday night at 8pm! Had our choice of tables. A lot of people ate and left quickly.\n\nTHE SERVICE: Friendly, chill. You order at the counter in the back room, they give you a sign with an international city, and they bring your order out. We sat for a good couple of hours after finishing our food, just talking, and there was no rush for us to leave. But they did take a while to clear our table, and even then did a half-hearted job at it. \n\nTHE COST: ~$16 total per person. We got 5 bites, 2 handfuls, 1 dessert - a filling dinner for 4, and we had leftovers.\n\nBITES\nMenu: \n* Corn Cobb (w/ cajun garlic butter. $3) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/broken-record-san-francisco?select=e40XZy2BEihQKF2QBz0bCA#1aakVy-MWX0BN5DmzWebSQ\nLove the spicy flavor, but I like my corn more soft. I think this was a type of white corn that comes out a little harder.\n\n* Sweet Tater Tots (w/ candied bacon aioli. $6) - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/broken-record-san-francisco?select=e40XZy2BEihQKF2QBz0bCA#UjYrZWERymYkNJhYa3GShg\nThe sweet aioli (basically like a butter) was amazing. The tots had a good crisp, but I felt like the inside was undercooked.\n\n* Artichoke Dip (w/ pita chips. $9) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/broken-record-san-francisco?select=e40XZy2BEihQKF2QBz0bCA#_cjiLQ7bNEUi908rfXHn1g\nBased on comments from my fellow Yelp Elite-ers, this was great. I'm not generally na fan of artichoke dip, but I will say this had a lot of texture from the artichoke and spinach. The pita chips were very thick and more baked than fried - all very hearty and rich.\n\n* Crawfish Boil (1/2 lb live crawfish, 1/2 corn cobb, garlic butter, cajun spices, garlic bread. $11) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/broken-record-san-francisco?select=e40XZy2BEihQKF2QBz0bCA#VjgOts_0KgMXmlga_b91Vg\nVery tasty crawfish! I've never had it - like a tiny lobster. Crazy crazy spicy. We weren't sure how to incorporate the garlic bread. Also: this is messy! Be ready to go through a lot of napkins.\n\n* Gluten Free Spicy Crab Mac & Cheese (quinoa elbows, mozzarella, spicy crab. $10) - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/broken-record-san-francisco?select=e40XZy2BEihQKF2QBz0bCA#PB3ZeGKEaVNbCjJgY78ozg\nThe gluten-free definitely detracts from the texture of the pasta - it just tasted lackluster, not very rich, kind of \"fake\". But the cheese was intense, rich, and thick, and the crab added a nice seafood kick. It wasn't very spicy at all, especially compared to the corn and the crawfish!\n\nHANDFULS\nMenu: \n* Spicy Pork Sammy (w/ tempura fried pickle, ranch drizzle. $9) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/broken-record-san-francisco?select=e40XZy2BEihQKF2QBz0bCA#HJYay1cZx5B_72gxlYnkuw\nLOVE the ciabatta bun. Man that bun is amazing. Soft yet crispy, soaks up the flavor really well. And the pork was spicy yet had this amazingly intense sweet flavor as well. I dont like pickles so the tempura pickles detracted from this dish for me, but if you like pickles you'll love that briny flavor exploding from a tempura shell.\n\n* Hood Burger (sausage/beef patty, bacon, fried egg, Jarlsburg cheese, garlic bread. $10) - 4.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/broken-record-san-francisco?select=e40XZy2BEihQKF2QBz0bCA#AHegsWzz5WfEHuv_L9MVOw\nOne of the faves of the nights. Once again, that ciabatta.. SO GOOD! The patty was deliciously soft and rich, and the flavors of all the components went amazingly well together.\n\nSWEETS\n* Apple pie in a mason jar with ice cream - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/broken-record-san-francisco?select=e40XZy2BEihQKF2QBz0bCA#wQEHmvgRIZgCCb3vwjFUcg\nIntense, and seems to be fresh out of the oven. We coudlnt' tell if they bake the apple pie in the mason jar directly, or move it into the jar. You gotta eat this FAST because it's HOT and the ice cream melts! But man that Three Twins on top.. what a good call. The apple pie has large chunks of apple - I like that it wasn't cooked to a mush, as those pieces contrasted nicely with the crumbly crisp of the crust. \n\nMenu 1: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/broken-record-san-francisco?select=e40XZy2BEihQKF2QBz0bCA#e40XZy2BEihQKF2QBz0bCA\nMenu 2: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/broken-record-san-francisco?select=e40XZy2BEihQKF2QBz0bCA#A-Fi9vmRTWK9BDsKP3CCKg\nMenu 3: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/broken-record-san-francisco?select=e40XZy2BEihQKF2QBz0bCA#AtVpDdhiv_SuOFdv39A_Lg\n\nMust-try next time: Crawfish Grits, Waffle fries, Sweet potato fries, Wings (their menu changes constantly, so I didn't get to order any of these!).", "author": "Ziyan C."}

After doing a fair amount of Yelpstigating, I entered the venue and headed straight to the back where the dining area was located.\n\nFrom what I saw on Yelp, the menu changes pretty frequently. When I went, offerings included jambalaya fritters, truffle mac n cheese, pulled lamb sandwich, and oxtail ragout, all ranging from only $8-$13 per plate! The fact that the food was this cheap really made me very happy given that the food was several notches up from typical bar food. \n\nI'm surprised that this place hasn't converted into a full-scale restaurant at this point, as the food is really what seems to draw people (as it did me!) Given that they are doing very well and are constantly featured on food shows, I guess they know what they're doing and don't need my advice! \n\nWanted to end by saying that the customer service was outstanding. We saw what looked like garlic fries at another table and asked the waitress: \"hey, why do their fries look different. Can we do that to the fries we have, too?\" The waitress told us it was fresh cheese and truffle oil and that while she probably can't, she'll see what she could do. 10 minutes later she came back with a second order of fries with the requested [luxury] toppings and did so with a smile.

When we walked up to the bar we were asked by the bartender for our IDs, which we handed over right away.  He checked them, handed them back, and went back over to the group that was already there and never asked what we wanted to drink.  The bartender moved at a painfully slow pace making the drinks for the other group and chatting it up with them sharing about how he was hungover.  Finally he came to help us and made poured me a beer and made my friend a bloody mary.  They put mustard and A1 sauce in it which was a little interesting and the A1 totally overpowered the drink.  We moved into the back to try out the food which was definitely the highlight.  We ordered the sweet potato tater tots with bacon aioli which were hot, sweet, and delicious.

At first, I was like, \"am I in the right place?\"\n\nAs I keep walking towards the back, I finally saw the long line of the renowned restaurant. And the long line obviously means a long wait. I hope the wait was worth it?\n\nAfter a 45-minute wait in the long line, I had plenty of time on debating on what to order from the small menu.

Next the Sweet Potater-tots has a little sweetness to the dish. Finally, the Parmesan cheese corn on a cob was cheesy and flavorful. \n\nThere are not many seating in the bar and restaurant. So they added a patio area. I ate in the cold patio area, where people inhaling cancer-sticks while I was enjoying my meal. I lived in Reno for 3 years and accustomed to restaurants with no restriction on smokers unlike California.

Almost everything off the menu were great but like always, some were greater than others. Here were my picks of the night (and sounds like almost everyone else's picks as well!)\n\n- Crawfish grits- I thought the Front Porch had the best grits but that was until I came to Broken Record. What's not to love? The abundant portions of crawfish or the delicious grits?\n- Lobster mac and cheese- Again, lobster came in abundance.

The food here blew my mind. \n\nFew things to keep in mind when coming to Broken Record. First, this place is CASH ONLY so make sure you bring plenty. Two, make sure you come early if you're looking for a table. Kitchen opens at 6:30 but if you come later than 6:15, you're most likely going to be out of luck for any tables.

Let me start off by listing what we ate.. we ordered the lobster mac and cheese, crispy pork tenderloin sandwich, short rib dip and a basket of fries with ranch and ketchup. \n\nThe lobster mac and cheese was SOOOOOOOOOO good!

No, they weren't real armadillo eggs... ain't such a thing. They were actually deep-fried pickled jalapeno peppers as big as golf balls and stuffed with a smoked spicy brisket (http://www.yelp.com/biz/t-bone-toms-steakhouse-restaurant-kemah#hrid:wB_luPh5s2n0rdHDPlf6Hw). Those would definitely not be out of place at Broken Record, a dive whiskey bar with a surprise in the deep south of San Francisco on the way to Daly City. The surprise is that they serve some bitchin' comfort food in the back where they have an actual dining room. Did I really say \"bitchin'\"?\n\nI got wind of the place on an episode of Triple-D where Mr. Spiky Hair Short Pants devoured some tempting creations like Oxtail Polenta and Duck Confit Potato Skins.

We had the audacity to go there during the 'Niners-Giants NFC title game where we found the bar packed and the back room sparsely populated much to our delight. Even without those temptations, there were several items that sounded satisfying enough for us. Jamie tried the $10 Crab & Prawn Sandwich, which combines a fried crab cake with crispy tiger prawns along with a splotch of avocado, chipotle mayo, and lettuce (see photo). It was solid truck-stop fare but not quite edgy enough for us.\n\nI had the Lobster Mac n' Cheese, a steal at $7 since it was generously filled with lobster pieces. The spinach, corn and Swiss bechamel provided the right flavors and textures, but I wish it wasn't quite so milky (see photo). I prefer gooey when it comes to my mac n' cheese. The best dish, we agreed, was the $9 Pork Fries...yes, pork fries - waffle-cut fries slopped over with delicious pulled pork, a house nacho cheese sauce and a buffalo sauce. Chopped scallions were sprinkled on top to give the illusion that there may be something healthy on that plate (see photo). Didn't matter since it was hardcore tasty and even patriotic with an American flag on top. We were full and didn't even have any whiskey to wash it all down, just Diet Coke.

There is limited seating, so come early if you have a large party and if you are a small group prepare to be seated with other hungry patrons since every table seemed communal.\n\nWhat can I say about this place that hasn't been said?  Well here's what my group ordered:\n\nBacon Beef Burger:  This burger is really good.  I could tell pride is taken in making a nice, medium rare, juicy, flavorful, quality burger.\n\nCrab & Prawn Sandwich:  Come early cause this was sold out within the first hour.  You won't find a better seafood sandwich like this for the money.  Great bang for your buck.\n\nLobster Tex Mex Toast:  I actually didn't get a taste of my friend's Tex Mex Toast.  But from appearances it seemed like they enjoyed it.\n\nPortabella Mushroom Burger:  I love mushrooms.  I actually split this with my gf.  And while I enjoyed the thick cheese melted on the Portabella mushroom, my girl asked \"Where's the beef?\"  So I ordered another bacon beef burger.\n\nLobster Mac & Cheese:  I only got a couple bites.  But this dish is signature here.  Some of the best Mac & Cheese being made out there.  They used bow tie macaroni with cheese and lobster but apparently the menu varies on what type of Mac & Cheese they make from day to day.\n\nFrench Fries and Sweet Potato Tater Tots:  I liked the fries, nothing out of this world but good anyway.  I'm not into sweet food, but my party really liked the tater tots.  Both come in large portions.  Plan on sharing one order.\n\nSo if I were to pray before I ate at Broken Record, this is how it'd sound:\n\nBless this highly nutritious Mac & Cheese, French Fries, Tater Tots, Portabella Mushroom burger, Bacon Beef burger, Tex Mex Toast, and seafood sandwich.  And for the lives of the Lobster, Crab, Cow, and Prawn that gave their lives for my meal.  Thank You for the creative minds and talented cooks in the kitchen that made all of this possible for us to enjoy this delicious food at a reasonable price.  Oh, and Thank You for Dive Bars. Amen.", "author": "Michael L."}

The vast, vast majority of the pictures of food you see are no longer available at Broken Record. \n\nThey currently have a very small menu. Only about four non-alcoholic soft drinks; also, not much of selection when it comes to dishes. The service is terrible. I had The Hood Burger was was ok; 3/5 stars, but certainly not worth the $10 they charged.  They don't carry  fries at this establishment any more period; so, I had to settle for sweet potato tots. Maybe eighteen small tots, for an additional $5. Also overpriced. Also, the waitress charged us for their pathetic attempt of fried chicken and waffles dish which we did not order.\n\n I will definitely not be returning to Broken Record. \n\nMe giving Broken Record 2/5 is me being generous. They are deserving of a 1 in truth, but the extra star comes from the fact that it has been four hours and I have not come down with diarrhea just yet. \n\nI will be sure to edit their rating if something turns up tomorrow morning.", "author": "Nadir G."}

I had seen them on the show and then in Yelp photos. \n\nWell, the menu has definitely changed since then, and maybe the owners, but other than that we had a nice little meal.\n\nWe started with some whisky sours for the ladies (it is a whisky bar after all) and a Guinness. Everything is ordered at the bar (in the front) and the kitchen (in the back), and when I ordered the drinks, the bartender asked me what kind of whisky I wanted. I looked up at the wall and there were like FOUR BAJILLION kinds of whisky!!!! I blanked. After a few more questions and a bulldozer full of Coop-provided whisky ignorance, I somehow ended up with Makers Mark. \n\nI ended up with a Reuben sandwich because there was one on the menu. I swear if they try to elect a guy named Reuben as the President he would waltz into the White House based wholly on the goodness of his sandwich doppleganger.\n\nI also sampled some jambalaya fritters, some truffle mac N cheese, and some of the Oxtail ragout, and all of them were delicious.

With approximately 1,000 reviews a and a near perfect rating, that worked for me, although at that point I would have settled for \"open.\" \n\nI waltzed in around 7:30 (that's how long I was sitting in traffic. After leaving the Crocker Galleria at 5:30. WTF), and I sat at the bar and ordered an IPA. It pretty much all went downhill from there. I won't bore you with the specifics, but here are some highlights:\n\n(1) I'm totally gay for the girl who calls BINGO--that girl rocks. I won a prize during the \"X\" game because everyone was making fun of me that I had a full row of \"N's\" - and she said that she liked my energy.  (In case you are not a Bingo aficionado, the \"X\" game is where you get an \"X\" across your Bingo card, so N's are really not helpful. The first person to get an X wins.)\n\n(2) Bingo pairs nicely with IPA. \n\n(3) Regulars. This bar has some frakking roots regulars. As you know, this can be a positive or a negative. Regulars can be cliquey and hate newcomers or they be welcoming and supportive of your newfound watering hole. At BR, they're the latter.  Somehow I ended up in their upstairs apartment above the bar.  Nothing bad happened... These dudes just like to have some fun. \n\n(4) One guy thought I was his roommate for the entirety of the evening.  I assure you, he was not my roommate. But it's always nice when someone likes you, even if it is under false pretenses. \n\n(5) These guys do some serious drinking on a random Tuesday night. I like people who are down to do some unexpected weeknight drinking--shakes up the ol' routine.  See no. 4. \n\n(6) Cash-only. Had to run to a shady convenience store to get some cash (however, some of those lovely regulars paid for most of my drinks). Note: There's a bingo game where the prize is payment of your bar tab. I didn't win that one, but instead I scored a table top football game. Don't be jealous. \n\n(7) Hangover. No random drinking on a Tuesday night again for me. I've learned that techies can really drink and recover beautifully. That's not fair! :) \n\nThis bar is so fun! I only wish I had eaten since I see all the great reviews on BR's food.  Next time, I guess.  Anyone down for a game of Bingo? Or are you looking for a little trouble to liven up your week?  See ya there Tuesday night!", "author": "Sunny S."}

Sad to say, a lot of the reviewers are correct, the original chefs are no longer there.  I will say, though, that the menu was still somewhat intriguing and I'm definitely glad I ate there.  Still, I have some negative aspects to report on, as well.\n\nPROS:\n\n* Jambalaya fritters: one reviewer said these could use a bit more flavor, and that might be fairly accurate.  Here's what I loved about them, though.  They weren't greasy, which for a dive bar fried appetizer is pretty darn good.  Second, the remoulade (style) sauce that came with them was pretty flavorful.  Third, while it could use a little more zing in the rice, it was a very attractive alternative to other fried apps, definitely a good way to break the mold so to speak.\n\n* Fries: very delicious!  They are prepared just how I like them, blanched-then-fried again.  The first fry par-cooks them, which keeps the inside moist and soft, while the second fry (much hotter) crisps the heck out of the outside, creating, in my opinion (and many other estimable palettes), the perfect french fry.\n\n* Burger: the bacon was outstanding, not your standard run-of-the-mill mass produced bacon product.  It was thick, sweetly smokey, quite long, and definitely tasted like it was locally sourced.  The cheese was equally unique and enjoyable.  The burger itself was big, juicy, and extremely flavorful.  I believe I heard them say that they used ground brisket or short rib (both?) in the mix, which I also believe I heard was done in house.  Tasted that way, at least.  So good, and definitely worth ordering again!\n\n* Drinks: I ordered just one drink, a Sazerac, and the bartender did a great job in crafting it.  It was a thing of beauty.\n\nCONS: \n\n* Bartender: let's start with her.  She was clearly preoccupied with her friends and regulars.  While I totally dig on the love shown to the folks that are there the most, you get more regulars by showing the same outgoing verve to all customers.  You don't cut off a conversation to give someone a hug (who just arrived, wasn't even leaving).  Come on, San Fran... try to lose that rude/smug stereotype, would you?\n\n* Bartender, part II: I hate to dwell on this, but she was special in a second way.  When I inquired about a receipt (yes, even in a dive bar), she got all incredulous.  She asked, \"A what?\" like she'd never heard of them before.  When I asked again, she gave me this awkward, \"Nnnnoooo?\"  Okay, again, I understand it's a weird thing to ask for in a dive joint, but some of us still travel on expense account, you know.  Anyway, expenses aside, it was the manner in which she replied that stunned me.\n\n* Noise: even in the back room, it was impossible to hear myself think.  If there was a live band playing, then that's understandable.  But, this was just the internal sound system!  I mean, not to sound like your dad or anything, but don't you care about your eardrums?  Do you not hear that ringing anymore when you leave the bar for the night?  I'm not saying you can't listen loud, but maybe not all of your customers like their music that high.\n\nHonestly, if the bartender would have been nicer, this totally would have been four stars.

Good beer selection - whiskey on tap.  Nice service.  Not to loud or crowded.  My kind of place.  I checked out the menu while I was there and was really impressed.  Lots of good options - and I've heard good reviews from friends.  Then, I saw it featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  My buddy suggested it for dinner last night and I jumped on it.  \n\nOutstanding place.  As a restaurant it's seat-your-self, and go order at the bar or at the kitchen counter.  We started with a couple of beers and quickly moved on to food.  I was struck by the fact that I wanted to order just about everything on the menu:  Pulled Pork, Sticky Ribs, Oxtail Ragout with Papardelle, Fried Chicken Sandwich, Mussels, some good looking apps and salads, and my ultimate favorite dessert - Pecan Pie.  (I understand that the menu changes frequently. - I've heard the Reuben is legit, and the and Lobster (or Crab?) Roll looked awesome.)\n\nFortunately, my buddy and I were on the same page:  Start with Mussels and a side of Fries - go from there.  The mussels were huge for $12 - and done really well with sausage and a delicious cream sauce.  I'd love to have this as an entree next time.  My only knock was that we could have used a bowl for the shells.  (I suppose with could have asked.)  My buddy wanted to share a plate of the ribs, which I would have done had I not had ribs the weekend before - they looked good.  I had the Pulled Pork Sandwich ($10) and my buddy had the Fried Chicken Sandwich ($10).  Both were great - the meat was about as tender and flavorful as could be.  If I had to do it again, I'd have the fries with the sandwich rather than the mussels.\n\nI like the experience of ordering and paying at the counter.  It's nice to not have to wait for a check when you're ready to split.  I didn't try the Pecan Pie, but will if it's there next time.  Overall - this was a big win.", "author": "Adam S."}

This was right after I came back from Vancouver which is famous for their poutine fries, so I was uber excited  for their totine (poutine tator tots), OMG Who could resist?! :O. They don't look appetizing but they were delicious. I recommend eating it freshly hot, when it cools down, the gravy starts to thicken and coagulate, not as appetizing. The warm kale salad was pretty good too.\n\nSecond occasion, was a Wednesday night to watch the Giants game. But since we were there, might as well give the Hood Grub a second try, this time for a real meal vs a snack. We ordered the Hood Burger to share and a friend ordered their buffalo chicken dip. Both were very good. The chicken dip were surprisingly very impressive. It came with freshly made hot pita chips and the chicken dip were large pieces of chicken and the sauce was very tasty. The blue cheese wasn't overbearing. This is a great dish to try and share. The hood burger comes on ciabatta bread, which was very good, but thick, which for a little person with a small mouth becomes hard to bite. I was most excited about the bacon which was delicious and the egg which was cooked to a perfect runny consistency, but it pooped before we even ate it so the yolk ran everywhere making it very difficult to eat the burger. It made the bread very slippery and gooey.\n\nDespite our disappointment with no brussels sprouts the first time, our second visit was very impressive.

Let me tell you my history with this place:\n\n18 years old  :  I brought my dad here to get some dinner because it was truly amazing when i first had their food. Because my dad was a chef, I wanted him to try it. I got my dinner and then got kicked out  when i asked for water because I wasn't 21. Reasonable but at least I got my food. From memory, I probably ordered the pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato tatter tots. The food was really good! I let all my friends know and they told me they got the po boy sandwich. $8-9 for a sandwich\n\n21 years old : I came here a couple of times and ordered the Craw-fish grits, Pulled pork sandwich again, lobster mac and cheese, portobello mushroom burger ( really good), and of course fries.  Everything was living up to their expectations from other reviewers. Played pool with a few friends and drank a few beers, very cool vibe. Still $8-9 price range, Craw-fish grits was probably around $11 ish. \n\nPresent day( few years later): Me and my friend came around 10:00, the last hour before the kitchen closed. We had no intention of drinking and went straight to the food area. I was surprised, there's actually a name for this place now \" Hood Grub.\" Also there are New Chefs.....running through my head \"oh this is gonna be different, but I'm hungry.\" I spent a few minutes trying to order but reading the reviews of this place, some people recommended the Hood Burger. I ordered the Hood Burger and the fried zucchini. My friend ordered the lamb sliders and the crab mac and cheese. \n Here is the break down of our food, we both shared and tasted each one:\n\nHood Burger: 0/5   $10\nWhat the hell are you reviewers raving about?? \nI did not know what the hell I was tasting. I could have went to In and Out like another reviewer did and know what I eating. There was egg going on, bacon, and patty on garlic bread. Sounds like hang over food to me. I think what threw it over board was the garlic bread, or was it the stone tablet of the garlic bread I was eating as the bun.   \n\nWhether or not it was not worth it for $10. I'd rather spend that much for 3 burgers at in and out or my last resort el farolito.\n\nFried Zucchini: 5/5 $5\nWorth it. You possibly cant mess up on fried food and the pre-made sauce. If you mess up on fried food, just get out of the kitchen or close your restaurant. The sauce was good. This was possibly the best dish of the night. That is pretty sad. \n\nCrab mac and Cheese: 2/5 $10 ( not worth it)\n\nA hand pinch of crab on a mac and cheese....... I expected crab to be inside the mac and cheese. I was better off going to ABC for their mac and spam soup for $5 which will probably fill me up.... ehhh the taste was ok. Nothing special.\n\nLamb Sliders : 3 for $8, 2/5\n\nIt was just dry, nothing special.\n\nThis is probably the last time I'll be here for the food. Time to try a different place. The food was just shit for the price. \n\nTl;dr : Food sucks, move on. Save your money and go for the drinks. Maybe that will make the food taste better.", "author": "Allan W."}

Don't really frequent the bar scene, not really my thing. So hearing that a dive bar 10 minutes away from me was featured on the Food Network for having bomb ass food was probably the last thing I'd ever get the impression of when walking into this somewhat sketchy looking establishment. But boy, was I wrong. NEVER judge a book by its cover. The Broken Record would be a prime example. \n\nThe front area houses the bar: stools, taps, you name it. So my first thought was \"wait they serve the food at the bar?\" Yeah, I'm dumb. Don't judge me. Walk down the hallway and the back area is where the magic happens! Here you'll find tables and booths for the food enthusiasts. Low lighting, TV projection on the wall for entertainment, and music in the background to set the mood.\n\nThe bar opens at 5, but the kitchen opens at 6:15! \n\nTIP: Get there early because the line started to form at 5:45. You can always order to go if you're worried about getting a table. \n\nWhat we got and what I hands down recommend:\n- Lobster Mac and cheese: not really macaroni, but bow tie pasta. So much lobster meat! Not as heavy as I thought it would be. So flavorful!\n- Grilled fontina cheese and crab sandwich with spicy tomato dipping soup: Can you say \"scrumpdiddlyumptious?!\" Fresh dungenous crab meat! Ever had E-Bar's tomato bisque soup? Dipping soup tastes like that but less heavy and with a touch of spice.\n- Crispy pork tenderloin sandwich: listed under the sandwich section but I considered it to be more of a burger. It absolutely lives up to the name, CRISPY! I love texture in my food. Keeps the palette interested and this, my friend, was so delectable. Omg. \n\nPrices are reasonable as hell considering how much you get and how fuckin delicious it is. We had to force ourselves to finish because 2/3s into the food, we were already full! Spent $31 between two people so really affordable. Definitely a cheat day. Maybe even two cheat days put together, but worth every calorie, every bite of crab, every morsel of crispy pork, every spoonful of soup.\n\nYou will see me again, Broken Record. And next time, I'll leave my judgement at home. I'll just bring my \"fat jeans\" instead.", "author": "Abigail D."}

And, as Guy Fieri would say, \"That's MONEY!\"\n\nWho knew a dive bar like Broken Record could serve up such decadent comfort food w/ a gourmet twist like Duck Confit Potato Skins with Gruyere Cheese and Truffle oil, Wild Game Sausages, and Waffles smothered with Nutella and topped with Homemade Banana Ice cream?!?!?\n\nAs I was scrolling through my CB, I noticed one of my grade school classmate's FB status: \"...had the most awesome pulled pork sandwich for dinner at the Broken Record. OMG.\" Hmmm, I never even heard of Broken Record, so I looked it up on YELP and saw all the luscious dishes they served and knew I had to pay a visit there.\n\nMy gf and I came to BR this past Sunday, 3.28 after the YELP Elite Event @ BUTTER at around 8: 20PM. From the outside, BR just looked like a barren bar, so there was some confusion as to where the food was served. We found out from the bartender that the food was served in the back. \n\nFOOD: \n*Mac 'N Cheese with a Bacon Cornbread Crust: MmMmm GOOD! Mac 'n cheese is ALREADY decadent by itself, but to add bacon on top of that....OH MY! The bow-tie pasta was cooked al-dente and was wrapped around ooey goeey yellow cheese. The cornbread crust added the perfect amount of crunch and the bacon added just the right of smokiness, an additional layer of crunch, and of course fatty goodness.  \n \n*Bacon Fries: SINFULLY GOOD! The skinny fries were fried to a prefect crisp with a soft center and was generously topped with bacon bits served with ketchup w/ a dollop of garlic ranch sauce! The combination of the perfectly seasoned fries, the smoky bacon bits, and zing from the ketchup and garlicky richness from the ranch left an explosion of flavors in mouth!\n\n*Chicken Wings: It was ok! The massive wings were fried to a nice golden brown and served with chunky blue cheese sauce, buffalo sauce, and celery sticks. Although the meat was tender and juicy, the batter was too thick for my liking. \n\n*Pulled Pork Sandwich: OMFG! Believe the hype, it's the BEST pulled pork sandwich out there. A toasted buttered egg bun was generously filled with the pulled pork, which was topped with coleslaw. The slightly smoky and sweet pork was OH-SOOOO tender and melted in my mouth while the coleslaw added a great crunch to the sammie. As I was eating the sammie, the juices from the pork ran down my hand and onto my plate which shows HOW damn succulent it was! A MUST try!!!!\n\nSERVICE:\nOrder from the counter, pay, and the friendly cook(s) bring out your order. CASH ONLY, but there's an ATM in the bar. \n\nPRICES:\n*Apps like Mac 'n Cheese, Fried Broccoli, Chicken Wings are $5-6 except for the potato skins which were $9 \n*Sandwiches and Burgers are $8-9\n*Fries: $2-3 for a side and HUGE basket for $5-6\n*Desserts: $5-6\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nThe bar itself it as divey as it gets; very grim and dark with several round tables w/ stools near the bar, and dart and a pool table in the room to the left. But, when you enter the eating area, it's more lively with booths and the menu written in multi-colored chalk. There are three booths and about 4-5 tables, which can accommodate probably 25-30 people or so. \n\nCROWD:\nYoung hipster and retro crowd. \n\nPARKING:\nEasy street parking. \n\nTIP: Come hungry and with a group of 4 or more, so you can sample a bit of everything!\n\nSomeone call Guy Fieri because my golly Broken Record is definitely Triple D WORTHY!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The crab was fishy, and greasy cheddar was melted on top, but the cheese sauce on the noodles was good. The chicken salad sandwich was fine. My biggest issue is the quality of ingredients has decreased on the new menu. For example, American cheese instead of Jarlsberg on the burger. Thin slices of bacon rather than the thick cut previously used. Also, super surly service.

It had a nice crust on the meat and was done well. Also took a bite of my friend's mac and cheese...which I was not really a fan of. It was too creamy, rather than cheesy.

Then he proceeded to make salad's etc. with those oh so clean phalanges.\n\n-Got the red snapper over rice w/ lobster sauce. Sauce was stored cold and not heated. Snapper lacked texture...but understandable with that type of fish. Oh and the cook stuck his fingers into the rice to check if it was hot enough.\n\n-Girlfriend got the mac and cheese. They scooped the pre-made mix from a 8 to 12 inch tub into a bowl. When we received the reheated mac, the bottom was still cold. We nicely asked if they could heat it all the way through. The two people behind the register gave us a look like we were lying. \n\nI don't like writing negative reviews, but man these type of things could really cause health problems.

It turns out that if you don't know the place or arrive later in the night like we did, the place is usually packed by locals or regulars.\n\nThe front area is a bar, while the food was in the back. Your order your food from a huge chalkboard up top. Once we ordered our burgers, sandwiches, sweet potato tots along with fries, we managed to get seats near the kitchen, where we saw the food being cooked and prepared. Once we tasted our meals, it was impressive and so good. We never imagined that a dive in a residential area would produce such great food at great prices. Broken Record is a prime example of never judging a book by its cover, especially with portions and tastes that beats all expectations.\n\nWe'll be returning soon, as we want to try the rest of the menu and perhaps catch a game or a drink at this place.

The bacon wrapped dates with curry marmalade were okay, but the marmalade was not a marmalade. It was just a jelly. I got the feeling that several of the menu items were given fancy names with little regard as to whether or not that was the actual preparation. The rabbit and waffles was really meager.

Their menu is fresh and fun, everything sounds amazing, and has an interesting twist. 20 minutes later we received 4 blackened chicken sandwiches, no bacon, no buffalo sauce, with no tots. We then asked where the main, vital ingredient -- the B in a 'BLT' appeared in our sandwiches; so they brought us a side of blistering hot bacon. It was good bacon, it's just hard to imagine forgetting to put bacon on 4 BLT's! The tots came 5 minutes after that. The sandwiches were ok. I was a little embarrassed. I had company from out of town.\n\nAfterwards, I asked awkwardly for a free dessert, to perhaps compensate for the lack of attention paid to our meals, and was rejected. The ice-cream is organic, and apparently cannot be given out in such a way. Sad to say, but I won't be back for a while.

With last season at the stick you should be begging people to stay.\n\nOKay lets just say I am glad I remembered to write this review. After a long day/night of work I was craving a burger at 9:30 so I yelped \"open now burger\" near the new pad. This place popped up and instantly I was like oh awesome I've been there before after niner games their food was awesome!  \n\nThe man and I make the trek out there and upon walking in I immediately noticed something was different. It was a dank dingy feeling, and there was a general vibe of who are you and why are you in my neighborhood bar. The lighting was also not just dive bar low but almost creepy low like someone had forgotten to put in say... 80% of the light bulbs. \n\nWe trek to the back and I thankfully had cash as I remembered this was a cash only prices. Thankfully I had quite a bit as the prices were ridiculously high. Corn on the cob which I had remembered being delish was around $9... um ok im hungry. Burgers also expensive $12 (this is a no frills whatsoever burger). What I noticed too was the menu was now tiny as more than half of what I was thinking about was no longer there. \n\nSo I order the burger thinking meh that's why I came here. The guy taking the order could not have been less enthusiastic. I had to tell him how I wanted it cooked since he didn't ask, ask for what came on it, since he didn't offer, ask if there were sides, since he didn't mention... I felt more awkward with every question. After he took our order I made the mistake of asking about the mac and cheese which is what I think led directly to the future issues. \n\nThe reason for no mac and cheese was: that was something the \"old\" chef did and the \"new\" chef didn't want to do any of the \"old\" chefs recipes since he was a hack... pretty much quoted. We take a seat at the only bench without trash on it and wait.... and wait... and wait...\n\n15 minutes to corn. Cold to the point the butter on it has congealed... hunger has set in so I chow down.\n\nalmost 45 minutes to burgers that in the low light you cant tell are under done until you bite into it. The man finishes a few bites, I make it two. I then make the mistake of taking the food to the window and explaining that frankly they are just too underdone... I mean I can take a medium rare but this was so pink it looked scary raw. I get told \"you asked for it that way\" no offer of fixing it or refund. I actually stood there looking at him as he looked back for long enough that the person behind me got uncomfortable. \n\nI guess though this is what you get when you are looking for a later night craving mid week at a dive bar : /\n\nSo to sum up my disappointing burger adventure:\n\n- bar dirty and poorly lit\n- stale beer smell\n- trash on benches instead of being cleared off\n- overly expensive menu for food that is not at all worth it\n- limited menu\n- undercooked food\n- shitty attitude by server/chef or whatever he wants to call himself \n- unfriendly demeanor by all staff for non regular patrons", "author": "Meg N."}

Pool table, darts, bar stools filled with folks I would describe as \"the regulars.\" It took us a moment to peer towards the back and see that there was a hallway leading to the dining room.\n\nThe menu had changed slightly since the show had been filmed, but it was still filled with delicious sounding options. It didn't take us long to order: crab & prawn sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, basket of fries, and the intention of coming back to the counter to order dessert.\n\nCrab & Prawn Sandwich: OMG. It comes on a thick texas toast type of bread, super grilled to the perfect greasy crunchiness, cut just half way thru and STUFFED with crab and prawns. And when they say prawns, they mean it... no silly little baby shrimp. These are legit. (See photo: We cut it in half to share before I took the photo)\n\nPulled Pork Sandwich: Tender, juicy, mild sauce. A little cabbage on it too. Very good. (See photo)\n\nFries: yum yum yum. PIPING HOT!!! I LOVE places that actually fry to order! Fresh, crispy, complete with side of ketchup AND garlicy ranch.\n\nThe decor is simple but nice. Lots of seating mostly at community tables, each with pleasant candles to set a chill, cozy, slightly romantic atmosphere which is a total achievement in a dive-ish looking bar.\n\nONLY TWO CONS:\n1. We were too stuffed to get dessert! NOOOOOoooo!!!!\n2. They're not open until 5pm which is a total bummer for the weekends. I would be at this place by NOON EVERY SUNDAY.\n\nGoing back asap.", "author": "Meredith S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-05-26", "description": "When the former culinary team at Broken Record left, the hatred of their new menu  and chef was vocal enough by certain subsections of the internet that it seemed possible that this once-venerable eating establishment was no longer a worthwhile place to visit. Fortunately, on my most recent visit, I was thrilled to find that the internet was wrong (surprise!). The new culinary team (headed by chef Ryan Furr) continues to make excellent food to compliment the outstanding drinks this grungy dive bar whips up.\n\nIn most regards, things have remained the same as they ever were. The bathrooms are still terrifying, absurdly loud Punk remains their standard musical offering, and the dim Edison-bulb lit confines centers your attention on the golden glow of their whisk(e)ytastic back bar, which remains one of the finest shrines to brown liquor in San Francisco. Craft beer selections are still decent, and the \"Fuck Your Stupid Wheat Beer\", (which is Firestone-Walker's slightly spicy interpretation of this venerable style) remains one of the only wheat beers I'm willing to drink. You can still get shots of Fernet on tap, and the bartenders (especially Nero) continue to whip up the best Manhattans for under 10$ in The City. \n\nHowever, things have changed in the kitchen. While the focus remain on high-quality renderings of American Comfort Food, old favorites like the Sweet Potato Tots, Beef'n'Bacon Burger, variations on Texas Toast, and Portabello Mushroom Sandwich were nowhere to be found when I went. However, the new offerings I tried were pretty outstanding. I enjoyed my piping hot, New England style seafood chowder immensely, although I would have preferred the broth to be a bit thicker. However, my deep-fried Jambalya Fritters (9$ for three) were outstanding, the housemade bacon tomato mayo they came with providing a rich, fatty and creamy counterpart to the delightfully well-proportioned combination of crawfish tail meat, rice, and andouille sausage. They were so good my dining companion ordered an extra order for dessert.  \n\nMy Ruben (10$) was just as impressive, with perfectly toasted rye bread providing the perfect base for Broken Record's house-cured, thin cut, melt-in-your-mouth tender pastrami, which worked in perfect harmony with expertly cured sauerkraut, torrents of melted cheese and thick russian dressing. While it wasn't the best Ruben I've ever had (c'mon, I've spent a lot of time in Los Angeles and New York), one bite was enough to send me raving, much to the amusement of the person I was eating with.\n\nDue to the departure of the old culinary team, the lines for food are now manageable, with the cult-like masses that used to swarm the tiny kitchen apparently having relocated to Haight Street. This makes for quicker turnaround with food orders, and means its possible to get a table in their back room, a fact which amazed me. \n\nSeating is available on their beautiful back patio (which closes at nine). If you can stand a bit of cigarette smoke, its well worth it to enjoy your meal under the tin-roof veranda at twilight.\n\n4.5 Stars, its still worth it to come out for some fine whiskey and good eats. Although some old favorites are no longer around, Broken Record has maintained a remarkable level of consistency through their transitional period. \n\nExtras:\n\nClose to the 43, 8x, 14, 14l, and 54. Walking distance from Balboa Park Station (although the walk can be scary at night).\n\nCash Only.\n\nStrong Pours.\n\nBeer towers available!\n\nSketchy on the outside, awesome on the inside.\n\nBrunch is now being served on Sundays.", "author": "Casey U."}

For one, he went to Culinary Academy, worked at some of the top restaurants around the Bay Area while I was growing up, and has his own catering business.  It is very rare for me to impress my father.  I once took him to one of my favorite spots in the city and I was so offended by his tough critique, I didn't talk to him for a week.  He called the place pretentious, over-priced, and said that a \"rookie\" created the menu.  Common phrases I am used to hearing from him whenever I try to take him out:\n\n\"This isn't even fresh.\"\n\"The chef cannot even chop this fine enough.\"\n\"I can make this, but better.\"\n\"Why would you even order this $20 dish?  It only costs $8 to make.\"\n\"This is missing A, B, and it's also missing a dash of C.\"\n\"I'd rather go to Elephant Bar than here.\"\n\nThe last time I impressed my father was 4 years ago, when I took him to Shabu House.  It's been awhile...\n\nToday, was a momentous day.  CLEARLY, since I am writing a Yelp review the day of.  I already gave up on impressing my father so I took him to a spot that had alcohol and that wasn't too far from his house.  I have to stress that my father does not drink nor does he go to bars.  I had to explain what a dive bar was and give him a quick disclaimer about the place while parking the car.  I knew he was nervous when we walked in because my 57 year old, Crocs wearing father was clearly out of place.  I ordered a pitcher of Anchor Steam for my father to try (My father kept calling it, \"Aunt Christine\" with his thick Filipino accent).  We then walked to the back to order our food:\n\n-Jambalaya Fritters $9\n-Brussels Spouts $7\n-Fried Chicken Sandwich $10\n\nLong story short, my father was really impressed.  He said that the food was exceptional and he was shocked that a \"dive-in-a-bar\" would make such well made, good quality food that is reasonably priced.

This is my type of  place -  a gastropub with a great punk rock attitude and fair prices. But I ate a fried chicken sandwich from here that just wasn't that great.\n\nThe spring mix, tossed with a red wine and balsamic vinaigrette and pecans, just did not work at all with the rest of the sandwich, which consisted of a fried chicken breast and a spicy aioli on a hearty bun. It was an overwhelmingly unpleasant and heavy handed taste that contrasted the chicken in the worst of ways. I took the greens off the second half of the sandwich, in an attempt to salvage things, but the vinaigrette had already soaked into the chicken breast.\n\nI should have went with my gut and ordered the jambalaya fritters, even though they were marked as an appetizer.  I have no doubt that Broken Record makes good food, but the sandwich was a sore misstep in my book. The oxtail pasta that I sampled had a great vibrant tomato sauce, perfectly cooked noodles, and tender meat. The bar makes stiff drinks at good prices. Bartender was nice, but the service at the counter in the back was standoffish. The place plays great music at the perfect volume.

The restaurant is separate from the bar and there are no waitresses. You walk into the bar, order your drinks from the BT then walk to the back of the restaurant and order your food. They give you a table marker then you sit, and they bring your food when its done. \n\n4. Because the bar and restaurant are separate, there are no free refills on soft drinks. And you have to get up and walk to the bar to get more drinks if needed. This can be a bit jarring especially if you are alone and have to leave your food to get another drink. I didn't like that too much.\n\n5. The food is as good as people have said!! I got the Oxtail Ragout. What? What bar, I'm talking borderline seedy hole-in-the-wall makes an Oxtail Ragout??! It was Delicious!!!! Stewed oxtails mixed with a tomato sauce with mushrooms and pacheco (sp) served over homemade pasta! It was amazing. My friend got the Ruben which was really good, and the Jambalaya Fritters, which was basically a deep fried orb of awesomeness with a side of aioli that was made by the food gods themselves. The menus change every 3 days we were told.\n\n6. Don't be intimidated when you walk in.

Yeah it was featured on Triple D, but here's the thing--THE MENU IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AND THE ORIGINAL CHEFS LEFT! I wish someone had told me that before because I wouldn't have made the trip out here if I had known. \n\nWhen my friends and I first walked in, we jokingly scoffed at the table next to us because they had left without even touching their mac and cheese. Seriously...how can you not finish Broken Record's famous mac and cheese right?! Well we were about to find out reeeeeaaal soon. So when we went up to order, we realized that EVERYTHING in the yelp highlights weren't on the menu! What the hell!? So then we asked the cashier who told us about the menu changes. We were all pretty upset but whatever because their food is supposed to be amazing anyways right?!\n\nSo we start with the Jambalaya Fritters. It was alright. Could have used more flavor, but it was fried well. The server tells us that our fries are coming right up.\n\nThen comes our 2 main dishes: the parpadelle and the bbq mac and cheese. I will say that the Ox Tail Parpadelle was fantastic. The only dish that was decently enjoyable. \n\nThe BBQ Mac and Cheese was the most shocking of all, especially because this dish is what Broken Record is known for. But I shouldn't even be surprised because when I went up to order, there was another customer who had actually returned her mac and cheese because it was so dry. To be honest, I thought she was being a princess. But right when we bit into it we knew! We knew why she returned it! And why the table next to us had left without eating even half of it! It was the driest and blandest mac and cheese I have ever eaten!!! Okay I'm sounding super dramatic, but I have a real good reason to be so. My friends and I weren't even angry at this point, just upset since we had heard so many great things about their mac and cheese. Then I remember that it's supposed to be called BBQ Mac and Cheese and think...oh I wonder where the BBQ is? So I ask our server if the sauce is mixed in with the mac and cheese. He proceeds to tell us..THEY RAN OUT OF BBQ SAUCE. Uhm hello? Don't you think that you should TELL US BEFORE we pay that you ran out of a key ingredient that is billed in the dish's name? And now we're all pissed because yeah, you're a dive bar. But its a simple principle to let your customers know if they're getting a dish that is missing a main ingredient. And I don't know..maybe that's why it's so dry?! And why people are returning it to the kitchen? And leaving the dish untouched?\n\nIt's now been 20 minutes since our server said our fries are \"coming right out\" and we're not even eating our main entrees anymore because 1) we hate the mac and cheese and 2) we are %%^&^% PISSED. Right when we decide to go up to cancel our fries, it comes out. But I can't even give you an unbiased review of the fries because our PMS levels have shot off the charts at this point. Crappy, disappointing food that have completely shot down our expectations and then serving us our fries at the end of our meal? NOT COOL MAN.\n\nTo appease our stomachs, we actually had to go to Krispy Kreme for donuts, which made everything better! \nOverall, maybe Broken Record is a cool dive bar, but I wouldn't come here just for the food.", "author": "Carolyn L."}

I wasn't impressed, to say the least. \nI got the tempura fish and chips--the chips were tator tots---I was expecting a special rendition of tator tots, but no. They were regular old tator tots like the ones you buy frozen at Safeway and warm them up in the microwave. And the fish? There was one and a half pieces. The entire meal was $10 I would expect at least 3 pieces of fish. \n  \nWarm kale salad- it was good, zesty and flavorful. \n\nPeruvian sandwich- I only tried one bite but it was very tasty and my BF loved it. \n\nSweet potato tator tots with bacon aoli- yummy, but nothing spectacular.\n\nCrab Mac and cheese- good, crispy pieces of crab.\n\nI guess I'm mostly disappointed because my fish and chips were lacking a lot of fish and the chip wasn't very satisfying, maybe they we're having an off night. Needless to say, I'd rather spend my money down the block at Dark Horse Inn, it's less crowded, less of a hype, I can speak and be spoken to with out having to scream and the food is really good. \n\nSorry broken record [kitchen], as the predecessor of the old kitchen crew, you have not lived up to your expectations.", "author": "Molly A."}

Broken Record popped my bar-cherry and, I must say, it was orgasmic. ;)\n\nI was surprised that I never heard of this place, considering it's less than a mile from my friend's house. We stopped by around 7:00 and it was comfortably filled with patrons. If you want to order some food, you need to walk all the way to the room in the back of the bar. As the sign says, be patient, as there are only two cooks and one waiter/server/cashier. We waited about 5 minutes before any one could take our order at the register. Seats are extremely limited so my friend and I ended up sharing a larger table with another party. \n\nAs this was my first time here, I wanted to try EVERYTHING! We ended up ordering the Pork fries, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Crawfish Grits, and Bacon Mac 'n Cheese. From worst to best: the bacon mac 'n cheese was extremely cheesy and just ok. The pulled pork sandwich was good on a toasted brioche with coleslaw and spicy mayo. The pork fries were delicious - made of waffle fries, cheese, and pulled pork. It was crispy, warm goodness. My favorite part of the meal was the Crawfish Grits. It was a huge bowl of cheesy grits with a ton of crawfish meat, green onions, and a spicy kick to each bite! In the end, this was a whole lot of food for two people. But it was worth it for only about $30! \n\nIf you want to grab a drink, I suggest ordering food first, grabbing a table, and then going to the bar for a pitcher of beer or a whiskey and coke. I enjoyed how they project a silent film on the wall. Although I didn't play, they have a pool table, dart board, and a BEER PONG TABLE of all things! Overall, my usual-fine-dining-self would highly suggest this down-to-Earth dive bar if you ever want to grab some good comfort food and/or a drink! \n\nI subtracted one star for the long wait to order and get your food, as well as the fact that a large amount of patrons bring their kicking and crying, annoying babies to the bar.

As we walked up to the front side of Broken Record, it was all I could do from turning around saying, \"oh no I ain't eating here\". \nIt was later that I found out this establishment is listed on Yelp under dive bars and what a dive bar it is! Armael M and Ellen C are both much younger than I and are both veterans of the cool bay area scene. Me? Well, a dive bar hopping with people  1/2 my age with hip hop music would not be a place I would venture in by myself or for that matter with any of my old fart friends.

Broken Record requires that you order at the register and pay with cash. Wait staff only gets involved after you grab a table and sat down. The menu written in chalk was above the register and the daily special was on a whiteboard on the side. I decided for the special, Shepherd Pie @ $12. While the portion was a bit light, it was tasty. Tender morsels of stewed lamb covered in fluffy baked mash potatoes. Luckily, Armael M is a light eater so I grab some of his steamed mussels to backfill my hunger. The mussels were also very tasty. Lightly seasoned with garlic and cook till just right.\nNext time?

I feel it necessary now to let all of you know that the food is not the same.  \n\nThe new Broken Record menu is similar to that of the old, fancy bar food. The new staff has improved the seating situation as in placing more tables in the front by the pool table and also stocking each table with napkins and cutlery. It was quite difficult in the past to come by cutlery and napkins when there was a full house. That is where the improvements end.\n\nI ordered the burger which was advertised to be ground brisket. The cost of the burger is $10 now. I found the meat to be tasty but on the smaller portion. I was very disappointed that the bun towered over the edges of the patty  considering the price. I also found it strange that the brisket cut was hyped as what they use for the ground leading me further into thinking that what I was eating was overpriced. Brisket ain't no new york steak. Brisket isn't even good  cut for  ground beef; the patty didn't even hold together at all, good thing there was so much extra bun to hold it I suppose. \n\nMy date ordered the pastrami sandwich and a side of French fries. The pastrami was super stringy , salty, and chewy  reminiscent of a corned beef that a drunk mother would cook for her kids on a Saint Patrick's day dinner. The fries tasted fresh but were not seasoned. I could tell that they cut the fries themselves but I found them to be overpriced compared to the former BR's portion and price for a side of fries. SO what if the former staff's sweet potato tots and French fries were pre-cut and frozen? They always gave you hella and duh its a bar who cares if they weren't freshly cut fries?! If I want super fresh ingredients a bar kitchen is not the place to look for that. Over priced bar fries do not make you a buzz worthy food spot.\n\nMany of the items on the new staff's menu seem to intrigue me (Jambalaya fritters, Italian Rice Pudding and the chicory) but upon completion of my meal was left with the impression that these people are maybe a bit too eager to succeed off the reputation of the previous kitchen team. I get that the former staff did fancy bar food but at the end of the day it was bar food. I get the impression that this new staff is emphasizing the fancy and forgetting the bar part.

I have yet to try the tower, but I'm sooo tempted :) :) :)\n\nin the back however, a hidden restaurant.\nfood is AMAZING here, order ANYTHING off the menu and you'll be satisfied beyond belief. Personally, i like their lobster mac & cheese. it gets quite busy here so make sure you have friends come early and save tables if you're a big group. \n\nOverall, service is amazing, both the bar and restaurant staff. food is good quality and cheap.

I was disappointed that all the great pictures of food on Yelp wouldn't be found here but I was willing to try the place out.\n\nRecently came here with a group of buddies for dinner and drinks.  Overall we all had a good time and its my type of place.  While it was busy enough, there were no lines for food nor drinks.  Its your typical dive.\n\nBar, pool table and some seats are in the front.  You order drinks there and bring it wherever you sit or dine.  They have a water container with a spigot for self serve water at the end of the bar table.  Makes sense when you have no drink waitress/waiter. Good selection of hard liquors for cocktails and several beers.  Our group ordered 2 towers of beer/bazookas, one after the other and filled our own cups at the tables which was cool.  I think 1 tower fills up about 7-8 cups of beer with a lot of unavoidable head.  Each tower was $30.\n\nDining and kitchen area are in back half along with a back patio area which usually closes at around 9, probably so there isn't disturbance to the neighboring houses.  Menu is fairly small but the food we had was good.  The same guy taking orders at the kitchen window and delivering them was a nice and funny fella.   After ordering, you take your number/playing card (King of diamonds for example) to where you sit down and wait for the food to arrive.\n\nI ordered a smoked fried chicken sandwich which was very good mostly cuz of the nice sauce on the inside.  A friend ordered their cheeseburger which was apparently good.  Fries were good.  Others ordered different food and while I didn't ask how it all tasted, no complaints or criticisms were passed.\n\n\nI would definitely come here again if anyone suggested it.  Nice place to chill.

The woman who took our order was a sweetheart and even let us take our time trying to figure out what we wanted and didn't once give us any sort of vibe that we should hurry up and haul ass so the staff could go home. Then there was the cook in the back who miraculously managed to single handedly fire up 12 orders all at once without any errors or imperfections to our meals. Our whole party wholeheartedly agreed that the Broken Record staff was amazing. \n\nPulled Pork Sandwich - Tons of soft pulled pork meat and crispy cole slaw in a toasty bun. I only wish I had asked for extra cole slaw and side of extra sauce like one of the other members of our party, because I think it would've tasted even better that way.\n\nCrawfish Grits - I never really had grits outside of a pan of lukewarm grits I had once tried at a breakfast buffet.. so I wasn't sure if I was going to like this dish or if I would even enjoy it... but I did. These grits were so wonderful! So many crawfish tails cooked just right... Lots of cajun seasoning and butter. These grits still haunt me day and night because I really really want some more! It's pricey for the amount you get, but I found it to be well worth it. \n\nPortabello Sandwich - IMO, WAY better than the pulled pork sandwich! I know what you're thinking... A giant mushroom cap?? BETTER than MEAT?! YES. It was so good! I secretly wanted to swap my sandwich for my friend's sandwich.\n\nSweet Potato Tater Tots - Exactly what it sounds like. And yes, if you like sweet potato and tater tots, then you will enjoy these.\n\nBaked Mac and Cheese - Really gooey cheese, large slice of bacon, a jalapeno kick, all topped with breadcrumbs and baked until delicious...and delicious this was...\n\nThe food is great, the service is great, and after your meal, you can even hit up the adjoining bar to lounge about with a few beers or drinks and shoot some pool and play darts for free!

Yes, the line is long but I love how Broken Records acknowledge their customers waiting. They also wrote on their chalkboard thanking us for our patience and there are only 2 people cooking and they are working as fast as they can. And when you actually get up to the register to order, they will thank you again for being so patient with them. Brownie points there.\n\nMy party and I ordered the Crawfish Grit. Mildly spicy and not too heavy on the cheese. One person can finish this if this is the only entree you are having. If not, split with 2 people.\n\nChicken drumsticks are $3 each and it's a great option you can just order 1 for yourself. It comes with blue cheese dressing. The chicken was glazed with honey and is very juicy.\n\nThe sweet potatertots is really good as well. I think the portion is huge for a side order.\n\nWe also ordered the Pork Tenderloin that everybody raved about but after finishing our other dishes for a good 45 minutes. This dish never came. *sad face* So I went up to the register to check on it and somehow it got skipped. We were so full already so I asked if we can just cancel the order.

Good people, delicious food, and well priced liquor. Hard to beat that winning combination. \n\nBar:     \n\nIf whiskey is your poison, do yourself a favor and acquaint yourself with this bar. The vast selection they offer is impressive to say the least, and the staff is more than happy to share their knowledge for inquiring novices and connoisseurs alike. Whiskey aside, the bar also has a great selection of other liquors, as well as draft and bottled beers.\n\nFood:     \n\nThe new kitchen is fantastic. Whenever asked what I recommend, I find it hard to decide; I've never been disappointed by anything I've ordered. If I had to narrow it down to one dish, I'd probably have to say the oxtail ragout. While the menu often changes, this one is pretty regularly available and is cooked just right.\n\nStaff:     \n\nThe employees, both in the back kitchen and behind the bar in front, offer prompt service, great attitude, and fun conversation. Being a bartender can be a tough gig, having to play the role of friend/psychiatrist/etc. but the bunch they've got working here make it look easy. The kitchen staff in the back kitchen work hard and it shows as their product truly shines.\n\nEnvironment:     \n\nDemographics of this bar can't be beat. Young and old alike mingle in an unpretentious environment that is suited for anyone looking to enjoy themselves. Music is always playing over the well laid-out audio system at a level that enables you to have an easily communicated conversation. One of my biggest pet peeves is a bar with the music playing so loud you cannot verbally communicate without shouting. I absolutely love the murals they've recently added on the wall across from the bar. The pin-up ladies are lovely. TVs are well positioned to allow viewing from different seats around the bar which is nice, as I've spent many a Giants game able to clearly see what's going on. I know I need glasses, but I appreciate the large screens that allow me to forget that fact.\n\nGames:     \n\nThey've got a dart board, just inside the entry that's a ton of fun. They pool table is only $1.00. I make this statement because I've been to plenty of bars that charge more (including a bar I know that's $2.00 per game!). I appreciate a bar that offers games to socially interact with other patrons.\n\nBrunch:     \n\nAlso, they've just started doing brunch on Sundays which I'm a big fan of. Mimosas, Bloody Mary's, and damn good food to remedy the all-to-often Sunday hangover is a blessing. In this neighborhood, with brunch venues few and far between, I'm glad to have this new option available. They yard they have out back is spacious with both shaded and sunny tables, picnic and longer communal tables.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you've made it this far into this long-winded review, then you should be sufficiently convinced that this place is hella rad and you should get off your computer/smart phone/technological device and head on down to the Broken Record where good times can be had by all!", "author": "Michelle R."}

I'm not sure why they wouldn't leave syrup to the diner's discretion?\n\nBut the real dissapointment was with my order....which took longer than the fried chicken and then arrived without any corned beef hash?

Lucked out with parking right out front, don't know how easy parking would be otherwise.\n\nWent on a Sunday 49'ers game day, place wasn't too busy, people drinking beer and watching the game on the handful of TVs they have scattered about.\n\nAt first didn't think that the restaurant existed anymore but you have to walk all the way to the back.  You buy drinks in the front by the street side, buy your food way in the back by the kitchen.\n\nOn Sunday they only had BBQ choices, ordered two plates, brisket and pulled pork.  $24 total.  Food came fast, sat outside on a sunny day at the picnic tables, handful of other people eating lunch too.\n\nOrder a side of fries on one plate and a side of baked beans on the other, both were fantastic.  The two BBQ plates came as sandwiches on sesame buns, generous scoops, mild but good BBQ sauce.\n\nIt was all good but I gotta say the frieda were some of the better ones I've had in SF.

Located on the cusp of Crocker-Amazon & the Excelsior, I expected nothing less from a dive bar in my old stomping grounds. Last Friday, I played third wheel to my guy friend & his wife. We met for $4 Coronas & $2 Guinnesses & ended up catching up for a few hours before, almost in unison, deciding it was time for some grub. (Bar opens at 5, food served at 6.) \n\nEven the ordering process is very laid back; the menu (which is more creative than typical bar food) is written on a chalkboard. You take your pick from the 4 or 5 dishes listed, step up to the window & 10 minutes later, it is brought to your table. \n\nMy friend's wife & I both had the Bacon Burger ($10), which was hands down, one of the juiciest burgers I have ever had. I missed the crunch of actual bacon strips, as it was incorporated into the beef patty, but other than that, it was a perfect burger. My favorite components were the generous fan of avocado & the slightly crispy cheddar cheese. I so did not expect something this good to come out of a bar. Another thing that surprised me--the soft shell crab sandwich my guy friend ordered. Tres chic for a dingy, kick it spot in what some call the ghetto (I just used to call it home.) \n\nFriendly bartenders & staff, an obvious lack of douchbags & hipsters & food that rivals any great restaurant in the city--I'll definitely be back. Bonus points: pool table, good mix of music, tons of street parking & you won't spend a fortune eating & drinking real good.", "author": "Fancypants X."}

I got the lobster mac n cheese, the pulled pork sandwich, and the bacon beef burger shared with my bf of course. \n\nMy favorite of the three was the spicy pulled pork sandwich. First off, I have to say that it isn't that spicy, the pork was juicy, and the bread was toasty. This is probably the best pulled pork sandwich that I've had so far. I really liked the cheese dip that it came with and the pickled onions. The cheesy dip came in a container filled with more that enough to use for two sandwiches which was great and if I would have known that the pickled onions would be so nommy I would have asked for more! :D\n\nThe lobster mac n cheese was scrumptious! The portion was a bit smaller than I anticipated but it was worth ordering. It's not your conventional mac n cheese. They serve it with bow tie noodles and use a white kind of cheese. The chunks of lobster are pretty big so you get your moneys worth, but the only thing that I had to comment negatively about was the burnt pieces of noodles on top. I liked the crunchiness but not the burnt flavor it left behind.\n\nI didn't get to try much of the bacon burger because i was already full off of eating the pulled pork and mac n cheese. So I don't feel right commenting on it but I can say with the two bites that I had it was yummy.\n\nThe food took a long time to get to us but its understandable because they only have two cooks. It is well worth the wait because the Broken Record is awesome! While you wait for your food, go mingle with the locals, get some water by the front, or watch them make your food.\n\nI really want to try their craw fish grits and desserts next time!", "author": "April D."}

Who knew that a dive bar could dish out such yummy food and some that you would not expect to see like Tuna Tartare & Soft Shell Crab sandwiches?  \n\nWe shared:\n*Pulled Pork Sandwich ($9)---Freakin delicious.  The meat melts in your mouth & the spicy mayo though I didn't think it was spicy at all, adds a nice flavor to it.  I also really enjoyed the bun it was on.  Best pulled pork sammie I've had to date.\n*Side of Bacon Fries ($3)---Nice crispy shoestring fries with the perfect amount of salt topped with finely diced pieces of bacon.  I wish the bacon pieces were a little bigger, but we still loved the fries, & drizzled some of the bacon on our mac n cheese.  We got the side, but the portion was huge & looked like a basket size!\n*Mac N Cheese w/Bacon ($5)--Creamy with bow ties in lieu of elbow macaroni.  About 5 pieces of cut up bacon.  Very good.\nI can't decide which piggie dish was my favorite!\n*Mini Sundae Strawberries N Cream ($4)--Homemade strawberry ice cream with sweet cream & fine ground pistachio.  So good!!  Love the big chunks of strawberries and you can totally tell it was homemade!  The sweet cream wasn't overly sweet like I thought it would be & the pistachio dust was a nice touch.\n\nWe were the first ones to order at 6, but food came out quick.  And later when our friend met up with us her food came pretty quick too despite a pretty packed back seating area.  \n\nBF wishes that there could be different sizes of the mac n cheese & a bigger pulled pork sammie, but the portions are not teeny tiny.\n\n*Cash only, so go to the ATM beforehand, but they do have their own by the bar.*\n\nReasons to check out Broken Record:\n*Yummy comfort food\n*Easy on the wallet (but not easy on your heart, but that's why they call it comfort food!)\n*50 cent PBR Saturdays!  \n*Parking is decent.", "author": "Cat C."}

Broken Record! \n\nSo i lived down the street from this place all my life and I've never heard of it. From the outside it looks like a typical local bar that looks like no ones goes there but 25+ crowd. In recent months, thanks to a spot on Guy Fieri's Triple D show and a bunch of yelp recommendation this place is the latest craze.\n\nFirst impressions:\n\nThe whole place is not very big. Bar area in front and restaurant in back. When you get to the back you are greeted by a super slow line and self serve tables. I recommend going in at least pairs. One to order and while the other one prays to get a seat. \n\nThere are only 3 workers. Always. Behind the counter, 2 chefs and the cashier/waiter/busboy. The cashier every 3 people he takes orders for then goes out to serves the food for people that have been waiting. If you come here during prime times expect to be there for at least 30 mins. \n\nWith that being said on to the food...\n\nOne of the best quality BAR food Ive tasted in a while. You just don't expect to have food this good at a price this low at a place like this. I don't think highly of bar food cause its bar food! but these entrees can def be served in 4 star restaurants. \n\nSweet Potato tots - Essentially normal tots but made with sweet potatoes. Lightly crispy but soft and mushy in the inside with salt and i think powdered sugar on top. \n\nCorn on the Cob - I never really order this any where but since they ran out of a lot of the main entrees i was force to order it. It was really good. I love sweet and savory foods. It topped with Chile oil and sea salt. salty ness and the sweetness of the corn was excellent. \n\nCraw fish Grits - It sounded interesting. It was a overall good meal, but had a better value. Such a large portion - you could serve two people with this thing. The taste reminded me of a gumbo like type of dish. It was good, but not something i would order all the time esp at a bar. \n\nThere isn't anything on the menu that isn't good, but get there early so you can taste it. As you wait in line you will see the cashier slowly cross out items on the board. Average wait time in line is about 15-20 mins during peak hours 7-8 PM *they start serving at 5. \n\nFinal Recommendation - GO THERE EARLY ON SLOWER NIGHTS LIKE MONDAY AND TUES AROUND 5-6. DEFINITELY GET THE TOTS THATS ALWAYS A CROWD PLEASER.", "author": "Ryan R."}

How can a place so perfectly ME be so far away from my side of the city?\n\nLet's get one thing straight, off the bat: there's an entirely new crew in the kitchen.  This is not the \"DDD\" bunch -- but you know what, that's fine by me.  It would seem that the pork fries are a thing of the past.  Instead, this kitchen won my heart with a nearly over-indulgent, tender burger (made with ground brisket!) and a warming, fatty braised oxtail with wild mushrooms on fresh pappardelle.  Had I anticipated the healthy portions, I might have skipped the jambalaya fritters -- like a Cajun arancini -- as an appetizer, but they were a nice palate energizer with plenty of spice!\n\nMy favorite part of the night, however, was when I rolled myself over to the bar, where I was greeted with Broken Record's infamous selection of around 300 whiskies!  This dive bar is to San Francisco what The Pot Still is to Glasgow; everything you could want in the whiskey (and whisky) experience, curated by a bartender who knows what the f*ck he's talking about.  Although they were out of the Elijah Craig 18yr, I enjoyed my glass of Buffalo Trace 45% as well as samples of the Henry McKenna 10yr about which I was curious, and an impromptu taste of the latest Four Roses cask strength badassery.  We discussed the transition between drinking whisky and drinking bourbon.  All was good.\n\nThis place looks and feels like a dive bar, my comfort zone.

You can bet that I licked that plate clean. The whole, fried catfish was better than some I've had in New Orleans, and don't even get me STARTED on the jalape\u00f1o tartar sauce!!!

But I gave it a shot because a few friends had raved about the food here, plus it's 3 blocks from the crib. And while the bar/front section can feel unwelcoming if you're not a 'regular,' once you pass the sharks and into the back dining room, you'll realize the discomfort was worth it. \n\nI haven't tried everything on the menu, but whatever I've eaten has always been above and beyond good. The pulled pork sandwich. The buttermilk chicken wings. The fried chicken sandwich. The sweet potato fries. The mac and cheese. The crawfish grits!!!! All recommended. I haven't tried any of their more healthier-looking items (salads), but I'm pretty sure those are good too. I suppose ;) \n\nThe back room is spacious, has a few booths, some small tables, some big tables, and a bar, I think. The staff back there are pretty cool too. And they show random films (skate videos, anime, etc)!\n\nAnd yes, I've even learned to find my own space in the bar area. Just be careful about asking for a \"Fuck your Stupid Wheat Beer\" when it's crowded or someone might interpret that wrong. Order a PBR, bring it to the back and enjoy with your bomb-ass chicken wings. Or bring your wings to the front room, pick a few songs from the jukebox, and get a game of pool in with a stranger. \n\nAnd when you really think about it, the crowd at this place is refreshing just for the simple fact that it's mostly locals and not a bunch of obnoxious gentrifying mission/marina hipsters.\n\nPs.

Went to Broken Record for the first time this year and this is what I got: \n\n-Hood Burger: this is supposed to be a burger with cheese, bacon, egg, and gsrlic bread. There were so many things wrong with the sandwich. I asked for it to be made medium. I expect my burger to be somewhere between medium well to medium-rare. I got rare. You can literally see a layer of raw ground meat in the middle. The burger is formed way too thick for the cooking method used. Jesus learn to cook. On top of that, le meat was bad; it was still edible, but with that certain rotten taste to it. This is the same meat you would see at the discount meats section at your butchers. The egg wasn't seasoned, so it was bland (didn't see any salt nearby.) In fact, the entire sandwich was pretty under seasoned. The bun was actually garlic bread. You need a real bun to hold everything together. Not stiff garlic bread. I ended up attacking the thing with a fork and knife from top to bottom. This was also why I felt bad when I discovered the rare rotten meat; I had already eaten a good half before noticing. I decided not to say anything. \n\n-Edammame hummus: You get half a bowl of this stuff along with overcooked pita. It didn't look very appetizing. Make it look presentable at the very least. Drizzle a tiny bit of olive oil on top. Season the pita right after you fry it with a dusting of salt and paprika for color. Don't get this. It was bland as well.\n\n-Cod and tots: this was fishy and dry. Not sure if it was because of the type of fish, the freshness, or the cooking method used. The tots were overly fried. Some of them were a bit too crispy. You don't get a lot for the price too.", "author": "Lisa L."}

At last, we reached the room with the food.  There were a few tables and booths. and a few stools.  \n\nYou look up and you immediately start to drool.  Why??  Cause you see the chalkboard, which has the menu on it and the more you read... the more you realize you're about to eat some greasy scrumptious foods!

Chicken wings were cripsy and hot, crawfish grits were goood.  It was a little cheesy and you can taste the seafood.  Bacon mac n cheese was cheeeeeeeeeeeesy.  I couldn't eat too much of it because it was so rich.  I liked the pork fries the best cause it was like nachos, but instead of chips, it was served with criscut fries! My fave.  Droooooool.  The steak frits was one of the specials that day.  I liked it the least out of everything I tasted.  It was some sliced steak served on top of an entire plate of french fries and smothered in a brown gravy.  The gravy turned me off a little.  I don't know what it was, but to me, it didn't taste that good.\n\nThe guy at the register was nice.  He asks you were you're gonna sit so they know where to bring your food once it's done.

A PERFECT SCORE.  meaning No Flaws. If they just go around Five Starring everything Forget their opinions, because they are fruitless and hold no true weight or clarity. Trust that I got your back so you won't waste your hard earned money on crap. \n\nThe pictures of this place make it look more than it really is. On the outside there is a sign that reads they are seeking for a head chef.  We walk in and the dude behind the bar completely ignores us at first so when we question him about where to sit he's tells us to sit wherever we wanted. After a little more sternly pressing he finally lets us know that the restaurant is back behind an unlit black hallway. the place looks sketch. It looks like a meth haven stricken write out of a screen play of breaking bad. Graffiti, crumbly paint exposing bar wall or rock. and black... lots and lots of black. The menu was very sparse and written in chalk hanging above where you order.. I guess they couldn't afford waiters. We begin talking to the person who takes our order. I inquire about some items that aren't on the menu that are on yelp that look delicious. They had none of them. No prawns, no soft shelled crab sandwich, no chicken wings, and absolutely no fries. She then mentioned that all the items were 3 years old and 3 chefs ago. she made the fries thing very very clear specifying that her chef does not cook fries and only tater tots.........because grown men love tater tots....apparently..  We ordered tater tots and a pulled pork sandwich checked out at 25 dollars. It's cash only. Although I don't really see why other than they might be cooking their books. This place looks sketch so I'll go with the latter. The water is self serve from a military style looking water buffalo.  Anyways the pulled pork came out very fast in minutes. even before the tater tots.. How? how is this possible?  all you do is take the tots and throw them in oil and take them out... Put the pork came out in minutes of sitting down... The only way this is possible is if the pulled pork was pre-made... I can only pray and hope to dear god that it was made today in fear of swine trichinella spiralis. I'm pretty sure the people behind the counter are microwave warriors. gross.  The sandwich was served on ciabatta bread too. very strange considering it's usually used for Italian style sandwiches. The tots were gross. \n\nThe place looked like a place to just get drunk on high at the same time. The workers look like they all have daddy issues obscene language and artwork on their t-shirts, no uniform look, it just looked trashy. punk rock blaring. which is fine if you want a punk look.. but damn this place looked like I could get shived any moment in the gut. it was memorial day and a couple of families walked in looked at the half botched excuse of a menu and then just walked right back out. \nIn between the bad food, no service, rude bar dude, black everything, sketch looking inside and out, and atrocious menu this place is absolutely horrible. You would have to be half retarded to give this place five stars let alone more than 2. \n\nMy advice AVOID. especially at night, who knows what goes on inside these walls, I've bounced at some clubs and... lets leave it at that.  If you can't help your curiosity, then Go to the Front Porch in Bernal heights instead.. Its a much better restaurant, bar, everything all around.

Basically the food goes well with the beers but I would maybe suggest asking for less salt or something on the food if that's possibile. The food's good but just a little too salty in my book. Nonetheless, three items from the food menu, all of which were pretty reasonable portion sizes, only came out to about $20, which I'd say is a pretty awesome deal!\n\nAll in all, a great place for a more laid-back night with some friends over some drinks and good bar food.

I've had this little dive bar on my bookmarks for ages (maybe 2 years), and I finally got to go there last month.  Totally blew me away and it's one of my favorite spots for comfort food and beer.\n\nWAIT TIME:  We got there around 6 pm, snagged a table and waited for our food for a little over an hour. Was it worth the wait?  YES (as long as you aren't starved, you aren't hangry and you grab a nice cold one to relax and chit chat with friends).\n\nFOOD (5/5):  \n\nCrispy Pork Tenderloin Sandwich $9 (roma tomato & spicy honey mustard dressing) (4/5):  SO GOOD.  The pork tenderloin was crispy and we got a generous helping so that the pork was spilling out of the sandwich.  Excellent-- we ate everything up.  This wasn't a huge dish, but it was nice to try because Broken Record does its crispy pork tenderloin well.  YUM!\n\nBeef and Bacon Burger $10 (house-ground beef & bacon patty; american cheese, ketchup, & house mayo, lettuce & onion on the side) (4/5):  The bacon is ground up and mixed into the patty, so you won't see slabs of bacon in this burger.  Regardless, it was delicious.  The house mayo was finger-licking good, and the burger (though not big like the Godfather 1/2-pound burgers) was definitely comforting and delicious.\n\nPork Fries $9 (pulled pork + waffle fries + cheese sauce) (4/5):  It seems like nearly everyone gets this.  I LOVED it-- it's a generous plate of pork fries.  The cheese was a little too salty and made a nice liquid cheese pool at the bottom of the plate, but it was still good.  It's a hearty side, good to share among 3-4 people and it will definitely fill you up.  This was a messy goodness that I still dream about.\n\nLobster Mac & Cheese $9 (lobster, corn, baby spinach & swiss-american bechamel) (5/5):  It takes a lot to impress me with mac n' cheese.  Sometimes it's too meh, sometimes the cheese is too stringy and hardens into a nasty brick and sometimes the mac n' cheese is just a filler.  But here, it's a flavorful mac n' cheese with all the comfort you'd expect from mac n' cheese but the delicateness and richness that you'd expect from $9 gourmet mac n' cheese.  Definitely try this one out.  It comes in a ceramic dish, so it's piping hot, and you also get nice helpings of lobster all over the mac n' cheese.  \n\n\nKITCHEN:  The menu and signs say that there are only 2 cooks, so everyone must be patient.  That kitchen is a machine-- there are literally two main cooks in the kitchen busting out orders like there is no tomorrow.  There's a ton of waitstaff to help bring the dishes over to each person, so the service at Broken Record is fine for bar standards.\n\nMUSIC:  Love it!  Totally a good place to sit back, nosh on comfort food (you will DEFINITELY have food coma) and enjoy music.\n\nVENUE:  The bar is divided into two portions:  the first half is the dark, low-key, super chill bar and the second half is more restaurant-ish with packed tables and a bustling kitchen.   The line will typically start at the restaurant area and snake past the bathroom and into the first half of the dive bar where everyone is standing around drinking.  The venue is super cool and chill.  I'd say the crowd on the evening that I went was a little older than I expected (and there were packs/throngs of Asians), but people of all ages love this place.", "author": "Sunny S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-06-18", "description": "I was visiting San Francisco and want to try something a little off the beaten path. My wife suggested that I try The Broken Record (she had recently seen it featured on an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives). I called an old college friend and we made plans to try it out.\n\nFrom the moment my buddy and I walked in until we stumbled out, we had a blast. This is the kind of bar-come-gastropub that I wish we had in DC! The bar is just dive-ish enough to be hip for the not-so-hip and the restaurant is tasty enough to be taken seriously.\n\nWe got to the bar at 5:30 pm on a Saturday and at first thought we were at the wrong spot. It was empty. We asked the bar tender - a genuinely nice guy bespeckled with tattoos - what the deal was. He told us that we were \"just early enough.\" Suggested that we order something to drink and grab a table in the back while there were still tables to be had. The beer selection - both on tap and in bottle - was impressive. But even more impressive was the whiskey selection... on tap! I have never seen whiskey on tap. But now I have. I opted for one of their exceptionally wonderful local brews and headed down the hallway to the back of the bar were the restaurant is located.\n\nWe grabbed a table and checked out the menu (chalk) board  while we waited for the kitchen to open (it usually opens right at 6:15 pm) and went into paralysis from all of the amazing choices we were facing.\n\nAt 6:00 pm, the restaurant was filling up quickly and we noticed a few people starting to queue up at the order window (you have to place your order and PAY CASH ONLY at the window - but they will bring your dinner to your table).\n\nWe decided to jump in line and use the time to try to decide between the Crawfish and Grits, the Lobster Mac and Cheese, the Short Rib Dip Sandwich and the Crispy Pork Loin Sandwich. Then we noticed that the prices were - and I am NOT making this up - only $10 per item, so we said, f-it and ordered all four items. Silly? Maybe. Worth it? Ab-so-f'ing-lute-ly!\n\nThe food came out as it was ready. The first dish to hit the table was the Lobster Mac and Cheese. There were huge chunks of lobster meat tucked among the bowtie pasta. The sauce was rich without being too cloying - a perfect balance that let the delicate flavor of the lobster shine through.\n\nNext came the Crispy Pork Loin sandwich and the Crayfish and Grits. The pork was crispy and tender, but the spicy mayo sauce and the brioche-style bun made the sandwich sing. The Crayfish and Grits was very good (and plentiful), but the butter-laden grits were just too rich to have more than a few bites (alright - I had more than a few bites, but I paid the price later...).\n\nLast up was the Pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: The short rib dip. Ahhhhh, now this is a sandwich. The short ribs were lean and cooked to perfection and served on a toasted roll that brought a smile to my tongue. It was served with a ramekin of au jus and a ramekin of horseradish cream sauce. Both were perfect accompaniments.\n\nThe only thing I wished we had ordered were the sweet potato tots. But not to worry. The wonderful thing about the Broken Record is the communal atmosphere that infuses the place. We had soooo much food on our table that we started to share it with other tables around us - and they shared their orders with us as well. After a few more beers, it felt like family dining! Two young women who were visiting from Louisiana came over to our table to sample a little bit of everything we had before they placed their order. You got to love a place that brings that kind of community out in a dining experience.\n\nOnly one tale of caution - bring cash. The Broken Record doesn't take credit cards.", "author": "Scott G."}

We got the fries, sweet potatertots and the crawfish gritts. And seriously, I loved all of it. The portions for the fries and tattertots were pretty generous for only $5 each.

I really enjoyed the vibe of this place - it was like grunge meets gourmet food in the best way possible. My friends and I got the truffle mac and cheese, the reuben, jalapeno poppers, and the sauteed broccoli rabe. The truffle mac and cheese was all about cheesy goodness and had ample amount of truffle. The reuben was pretty good and the meat was super tender, but I felt it was a little on the salty side. The jalapeno poppers were decent, but I feel that it could have used more flavor. The broccoli rabe was sort of drenched in a lot of wine so it was a little bitter. Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place. I might have had high expectations coming in because Guy Fieri spoke so highly about it. It was good, but some tweaks could have made the food itself better!", "author": "Naomi S."}

You have hordes of people driving all the way out here to eat, and I mean HORDES.  \n\nThe kitchen opens at 6, so we showed up at 6 and there were already a dozen people in a queue, waiting at the still-closed cash register.  We managed to get the last available indoor seats not in the bar, all the others staked out.  Hey, it's popular, what are you gonna do?\n\nThe unfortunate result of such popularity is that the place gets LOUD.  In this big box of a room the high ceilings and hard tiled floor combine to turn the place into an echo chamber.  When you get 40-50 chatty people, clinking silverware and kitchen noises, it becomes a cacophony.  The louder it gets, the louder people speak until you are quite literally having to say \"HUH?\" to the person sitting across from you.

We opted to sit on the back patio because it was so nice outside, and it's a pretty great space. Nicely sheltered, somewhere you don't exactly feel like you're in the middle of the city.\n\nWe came here to try the bacon burger, and were directed toward the daily special - a bbq burger with onion rings on it. So we got one of each and split them. They were both good, but I might prefer the bbq slightly. The bacon flavor was definitely different from having bacon ON the burger - you get the smoke and the salt as it adds to the beef. Ultimately I thought it was a bit overkill on the fat with the double burgers, the cheese, the mayo. I don't know if I could finish one whole one myself, but that's because we also got...\n\nAn order of fries. Quite good, very well seasoned. And the corn. Oh my gosh, the corn.

I seriously believed that the old kitchen's pork was seasoned with tears from a god and a slight hint of pepper. As I hadn't eaten here in quite a while, I decided to check the menu. As I looked up at the chalk inscriptions, wonder and awe washed over my being; the pulled pork sandwich was back! When I expressed my excitement, the kitchen worker told me that a new kitchen had taken over, but to not fear! \"Our pulled pork is way better than the last kitchens!\" exclaimed the excitable kitchen worker. Swayed by the gusto of this employee, I ordered the sandwich and waited. Never in my wildest dreams could I even comprehend a sandwich being better than before, but the kitchen worker was so confident in his assessment, how could I not get excited? In just a few minutes, a herald from the gods arrived with my sandwich. Trumpets blared as I bit into what was assured to be a slice of heaven. Unfortunately, the trumpets were playing something akin to Kenny G: high expectations but little follow through. Although spicy, it was lacking the flavor the previous sandwich boasted. In fact, the sandwich was quite bland and underwhelming, with the exception of the kick of the spicy aftertaste.

You can eat out in the front, and you can certainly bring your cocktails and beers to enjoy with a greasy spot of food.\n\nA great benefit of having a dining partner is that variety is instantaneously doubled. To whet my appetite, I decided on a starter of sweet potatertots, a basket of deep-fried, marble-sized sweet potato balls.

It was good - the right amount of juicy and most definitely made with high quality beef between a toasted bun. But as good as it was, I'm still waiting for something to render me speechless.\n\nThe pulled pork sandwich definitely took the prize. With a slight spicy bite in the coleslaw and tender pork simply dripping with juice, I had an easy time wolfing it down without missing a beat.\n\nI'd love to come back for drinks and good company one day, but I wouldn't be surprised if I found myself in line to try their crispy pork tenderloin sandwich (of which they ran out of this time around).", "author": "Priscilla W."}

The worst part of this was that they didn't even warn or mentioned to us that they will be closing earlier than what they are scheduled to.\n\nThis is not the only thing that happened. One of their guy friend/worker, a Caucasian guy with a goat tee, approaches us and begins to yell threatening words at my friends with his first raised up.

The pork was cooked perfectly and it was juicy! You can tell the pork is fresh and marinated right. Some places have pork that has a little stench which really takes my appetite away. I usually get that at chinese restaurants ugh.. the tomato they used was heirloom tomatoes which are good on their own in sandwiches and are harder to find and are more expensive. They have this bomb mayo mix IDK what mojo they used but it was hella bomb :)\nsweet Potater tots- Interesting :) and unusually addictive haha.. specially when you dip them in the catsup and ranch. I never thought i would like something so weird. i don't even use catsup ever haha\nChocolate cheesecake- okay, i really thought this would disappoint cause it looked plain and just common. But when I had it, forget all the decorations this is one of my most favorite cheesecake. I understand that people have different tastes for cheesecake, some like em cheesy, creamy, sweet, light. This one really caught my tastebuds all I can say is that it tasted like heaven.\n\nLike I always say everyone's got a different taste, different opinions for me this place is as sweeeeeeet as it can get. Coming back for more drinks and food :)", "author": "Xyzagal A."}

Excellent selection of Bourbon, Scotch & Tequila. \n* Fun atmosphere \n\nLowlights:\n* Limited seating\n* Sometimes long wait for food which gets served as soon as it's ready. You might be half way through your Lobster Mac-N-Cheese before your date gets their order of Crawfish Grits. \n* Street parking\n* Cash Only \n* Not a place for vegetarians or those looking for low calorie healthy eats. \n\nWe got there early - 5:45 on a Friday & it was a good thing. Not long after we sat at one of the tables (seemed like there were maybe only 8 or 9 inside) we noticed people starting to line up at the kitchen / restaurant register. By the time the kitchen opened at 6:15pm, the line had snaked through the narrow hallway to the bar. (The bar is in the front & the restaurant / eating area is in the back)\n\nThe atmosphere had a fun vibe.

Was it worth the going out in the rain, face smeared, and getting f-r-i-z-z-y hair on a Friday night, I guess so.... because i'm looking TORE UP tonight but with a happy palate. Lets just say i was not impressed, UNTIL I ATE. \n\n- Food, Yumz\n- Prices, decent\n- Service, shitty\n- Ambiance,dive bar - nothing special\n\nAlot of people come here and heard of the place because of yelp. HERE'S MY TWO CENTS, ENJOY!!!! Do you really want to know what i think about this place? It's best that i write reviews coming down off of alcohol. Came here around 7:45PM on a Friday, the place is a HOT ASS MESS. crowded, no organization, you have to jump on tables to even get a table. And it's annoying the tables are dirty. In fact, I went behind in the kitchen and asked the staff \"can i have a wet towel to wipe my own dirty table down?\" and they looked at me like \"who the hell is this b* in our kitchen asking for a towel\" but politely said they'll come over and wipe the table. Embarrassed to have people meet up to eat and I'm sitting at a dirty table for them. The logistics of the place is terrible, get your food way over here and get your drinks way over there. What do you expect, it's a DIVE bar, I got to cut some slack. BUT THE FOOD... is another story.\n\nHEFFER-STYLE STATUS.\n\nLOBSTER MAC & CHEESE ($9) - i'm a loser, i had bookmarked this dive bar and noted which foods i was going to order. thats when you know you are a true yelper.This was one of them and it was pretty delicious. I love lobster and i love mac & cheese, but together... WOW. really? I especially liked the parts on the side where it has that crunch to it - the so called \"burnt\" areas of the dish. i was asked if i had a \"foodgasm\" and it was near one but not entirely. HAHA. It was just a tease, can't eat so much cheese so i didnt get to lick my plate dry to let you know if there was a foodgasm.\n\nPORTABELLO MUSHROOM BURGER (?) - i only had a bite and it was pretty F'n good. I'd pig out on one of these and i'm not really into burgers. Okay, I kind of wish i had order one of these for myself - shooting myself in the foot because i'm hella hungry right now. if a non-burger person enjoys a burger, there's got to be something special about it. i'm just happy that it didnt have meat. not like i can't eat meat, i can, i am just happy to see something less fattening on the menu and taste hella delicious. and the burgers are HUGE, so you definately get your money's worth. real talk.\n\nSMORES SUNDAE ($5) - another item that i noted when bookmarking this place on yelp. desserts steal my heart away. i love desserts and especially icecream. the smore sundae was really good and i think this was my favorite dish of the night. dessert? i know right. but the malt chocolate icecream, drizzed in a little fudge and then topped with marsh mellows and i aint talking about the marsh mellows in a bag, i'm talking about smore style. This can give me a foodgasm just thinking about it. \n\nWill I be back? I think I'd come back here again to hang out. Just not sure when though.", "author": "Jane A."}

There was a garden outside, but they told us they were closing it in 15 minutes so we had to find a table inside where it was really crowded. Some creepy guy told her that he'd give us his table if he could stare at her feet. He was quite fat and drunk.. she gave him attitude back and told him to get up since he was done b/c we needed their table. \n\nI ended up getting the Rice Bowl: Brisket, Kim Chee, soft boiled fried egg and rice.

Prices are reasonable, most things are under $10 and nothing over $13. Portions lean toward the larger side too, good for sharing.\n\nI saw the tuna wrap- which honestly was the most questionable thing on the menu.

Where? Exactly. Before looking it up, I thought that Excelsior was some mythological place where city buses went to die, a Platonic last stop that no one actually went to or came back from.  I live in Glen Park and still had to take both BART and a bus to get there. For former or current Brooklynites, it's a bit like taking the L or G trains into some godforsaken industrial corner of the city, kicking yourself for traveling that far just to go to some hot new bar or restaurant, and then realizing that you still have two more trainless miles to go. It's silly, but ultimately worth it (though getting a cab back into SF proper can be a pain).  \n\nUp front, Broken Record looks to be one of the city's great, secret dives. Great beer selection, down and dirty atmosphere, art house hipsters co-mingling with Giants-gear wearing locals, a pool table, a dart board, the whole nine. Down a narrow strip of hallway that looks like it leads to a bathroom (which I suppose it does) you eventually stumble into a secretish-feeling back room that has sit-down tables a plenty, kung fu flicks projected on the wall, and some super super tasty food. Sweet potato tater tots fried in duck fat? Yes, please. Burgers? Too good. Mushroom burger? Don't know, but the vegans looked happy.

Sadly, they no longer have the duck confit fries. They were also out of sweet potato tots. I got the sweet potato fries, but they were not a good substitute. Almost burnt, so only ate a handful. Meh. $5 for a basket\n\n2. Pulled pork. Being from Texas, it was ok to me, but probably great to most people. Texas pulled pork is often more smokey, but I felt this was good for California. Husband didn't think it was all that. He said it tasted like some seasoned pork on a wet bun. (I think he's wrong). $9\n\n3. Fried wings. Like the size since they're real chicken wings and not \"hot wings\". Red sauce is strange. I couldn't place it, but it's kind of a soured red hot sauce. The wings didn't have much flavor except for tasting fried. Could be a good bet if you're into regular fried chicken.  We don't eat fried stuff very often, but KFC is better in my opinion. $8.\n\n4. Fried pork loin sandwich. Huge. I wanted to like it, but it didn't have much flavor except for \"fried\". Drunk people would love it. $9.\n\nOn the positive side, the servers were fast and friendly on a Tuesday night, so they get a star for that. CASH ONLY, but they have an ATM.", "author": "Dee C."}

Apparently this place has gotten more and more popular, especially since these two men in back of me in line said they saw it on TV and decided to come on by. They didn't really look like neighborhood people, by the way. Broken Record is going places!\n\nI haven't been here in forever on a Friday night and let me tell you, it's like rush hour in there. The line wrapped around into the hallway near the bathroom, but people didn't look like they minded waiting. You just might have to fight people, aka politely ask them when they are leaving their tables. Otherwise you won't have a place to eat. Note to people who are just drinking and taking up tables in the back: please go to the bar area, especially when it's not full! People need tables!\n\nAnyway, I ordered pretty much everything I usually order (the grits, chicken wings, sweet potato fries, etc), although I didn't get any sweet potatertots because they ran out. A pity, but after me and my friends decided to order a plethora of a lot of meat/carb heavy items, we got the Tomato Toast to cut through with veggie power, which was super delicious, especially their homemade ricotta cheese. Absolutely wonderful! We also thought maybe we shouldn't have gotten the extra order of wings and should have spent our money on the 'smores ice cream. I didn't see that at first, because I didn't notice they had more on the specials board. Pay attention to it, it's right next to the register. Otherwise, if I saw it I would have noticed the corn on the cob special. \n\nGetting beer at the bar wasn't a problem this time, and the bartenders were really up on their game and helping everyone (not just lingering and stuff), so I enjoyed that. Love the wheat beer and its name. Always lovely to say the name. \n\nAdvice for people who haven't gone yet: don't be upset if you have to wait a long time for your food. There are only two people working behind the counter, so you have to be patient. I've been going here for a while, and they're always very nice so reading about how people complain about waiting for food irritates me. If you don't want to wait a long time, try going on a non-busy random night like Monday or Wednesday and earlier than 7pm. Also, get the crawfish and grits, it's still the best damn thing they have on that menu.", "author": "Caroline L."}

It was gloomy.  There was one customer.... creepy looking guy.... looking like he was coming down off something. We sat ourselves down... confused that there was no service and realized we had to order at the kitchen... menu was on a black board above. Nothing screamed at me to try... so I just ordered sweet potater tots. Bf ordered the hood burger and crispy fried tempura bacon. The bacon aioli for the tots... couldn't taste bacon. Fried bacon.... ive had better. Hood burger... needed grilled onions and tomato or some kind of sauce to balance flavors. Went on to yelp to see what was up with this place and found under new ownership. Must be first timer because the looks of this place looks like it has a whole bunch of health code violations. Maybe they need to close up for a bit a remodel and restaff and replan this whole joint instead of trying to pick up where the last owner left off.

Well the food has taken a drop. My group order the hood burger, the taste was not too bad however for $10 we got one of the smallest meat patties on a huge bun. The tots were good, but the dipping sauce was interesting to say the least. The tempura asparagus was bland, but covered in a good siracha sauce.

Picnic style tables, booths for 4, and groups of chairs make it the perfect area to unwind, grub, and chillax no matter if you come here with a mess of friends or are out on a date. \n\nYou also order your food in the back and their soul-food style menu is highlighted by their famous beef brisket and pulled pork sandwhiches. After a bite, I felt like one of those AIG Execs because for the quality my beef brisket sandwhich was a steal at $8. \n\nAlso on the menu were sausages that come in not so easy to find meats like pheasant and venison.  They just ran out of alligator sausage but the boar was a tasty runner up. The boar had a good smoky taste and the flavor wasn't \"boar-ing\" at all (da da dum).  The mustard (homemade?) they had on the table gave the sausages a nice little roundhouse kick. \n\nThe frontside of the mullet is BR's front bar area where they got the fun stuff. Of course you got a nice selection of beers on tap, as well as a dart, and pool table. Ironically, one of my barmates was rocking a mullet harder than steel itself. \n\nPeople are chill and diverse here.

It's nice to catch up with the people I'm usually here anyways. Grab a beer, or play pool, they also play movies on a big projection screen. The cooks bump their laptop music also.

Small in portion, but SO GOOD. I could finish the entire basket myself, but mommy taught me to share. :( The pulled pork was delish and cheesy grits was filled with crawfish! They were definitely not skimpy on that! Each spoonful had at least 2 crawfish.. I don't even think this was a grits dish anymore.\n\nTheir menu seems to change constantly because a lot of the yelp reviews said to try their truffle fries, homemade cookies, mac&cheese, and duck confit potato skins, but sadly all of them were not on the menu when I went.\n\nDefinitely going again!!

As you walk in, you might do a double take to make sure you've entered the right place since it looks like a bar. Walk in a little further and you'll see that the end of the hallway are tables and that's where you order your food. The tables are first come first served, so if you have a friend, tell them to grab a table for you while you order. \n\nEveryone who's been here keeps talking about the buttermilk fried chicken wings, so I was set on trying that. To my surprise, they were out. BOO. So instead, we got the Pork fries which had pulled pork, waffle fries and cheese and the Texas toast and gravy.

After we dropped off our son with his grandparents (first time grandparents, gotta love 'em!), we wanted to stay local and so here we went. \n\nI was excited cause we were less than a mile from where we grew up, a VERY familiar neighborhood, but definitely not the neighborhood that I'm used to traversing in checking out different restaurants. Geneva just isn't the place and it would be great but I think it has a long way to go, if  you compare it to neighborhoods like Glen Park and Bernal Height's Courtland Street, now that place is definitely not the place it was twenty years ago, but I digress.\n\nWe walk in and it's a straight neighborhood bar, hoodrats and the like, and I ask the guy checking our ID if we could just head straight to the restaurant part of the bar, so we did and I swear I felt like I walked into a secret world. It was definitely worlds apart, the type of place I would expect in some funky part of Noe Valley. Am I stereotyping? I guess I am, but it's a free world and I'm only writing what I'm feelin' so whatever. A part of me is also kinda feeling a little territorial about my neighborhood, but I guess others would feel the same about me jockin' their worlds too, so....\n\nWe order (cash only) our food and there's plenty of options. I order a fritter sandwich, which was a soft-shelled crab sandwich, fried chicken wings for appetizer, and hubby orders a bacon cheeseburger.\n\nWe're looking around for seats, it's straight crackin in there, so for me, that's a very good sign. I'm shivering with excitement, just being in the atmosphere of it all, with my husband on date night, I'm feelin good.\n\nWe find a table that faces the wall that has \"Dazed and Confused\" playing and so of course, find ourselves watching it although the music and the chatter was so loud, you couldn't hear yourself think. It's a good feeling.\n\nOur table is still dirty from the patrons that were there before us, but we move it to the other side of the table since our table was huge (minus a star) and I saw a fruit fly (eh, I won't die, but whatever). Our orders come and the fried chicken wings are ok, not the best, but still tasty. My fritter sandwich is delectable (it could've used more seasoning) but the crunch was perfect in its entirety. I declined my hubby's burger (it was a cheeseburger, come on, I know what a damn cheeseburger tastes like). No, no, no. I was WRONG. That effin cheeseburger had some crispy ass fresh bacon in it and I swear it was the most tastiest, most delightful, bacon cheeseburger that touched my tongue. I did regret my sandwich after having a bite of his, but overall, I was very happy with our date night in our old hood.\n\nAnd it was effin cheap. Can't go wrong with that!!!

Waited in line to order which was about 15-30 minutes. We got 4 beef and bacon burgers and 2 parmesan cheese fries. Then waited another 45 minutes to get the actual food. OK so the burgers were definitely good and juicy but they were small and cost $10 a piece. A little on the salty side and undercooked but good. The fries were really just fries w/ cheese sprinkled on top but they tasted great. \n\nAnyway, I have mixed feelings about this place. The food is good but everything is overpriced especially since they're not like specialty burgers. I know a place in Davis that makes the same juicy burgers plus a side of fries, salad, etc for around $8 and they'll even add bacon (it's Burgers and Brew if you're interested). I'm just not feeling the price especially if they're not giving you a side of something. Maybe I'll come again...I don't know.  Maybe.", "author": "Lily W."}

It's got a casual neighborhood feel.  The bartender and all the guys in the kitchen were really hustling, yet still able to be friendly.\n\nThe space was creative, and not cramped.  The bar had about ten stools, and there's the dart board and a banquette at the window near the door.  The other front room has a pool table with ample room, a few tables and more banquette along the window again.\n\nIn the back is the kitchen, and seating inside, maybe four large picnic tables and a few booths.  Out back, four more picnic tables, two under a sort of arbor/trellis setup.\n\nFood was quite good.  Crispy port tenderloin sandwich had tomato and a zesty aioli.  The sweet tater tots were great, probably could benefit from a few more dipping sauces than ketchup and ranch, though.\n\nOK.  This is a whiskey bar.  Whiskey and beer, really.  The place wasn't packed, but it was quite busy on a Sunday evening.  I felt sort of bad for the bartender, squeezing fresh limes to make a few Margaritas.  Really, try one or two of the 200 whiskey/whisky options.  Prices are good on most mainstream items.  Sure, Midleton and a few of the Macallan's might run a bit high but the rest are at least a buck or two less than anywhere else I've seen in, except for true dive bars.\n\nToo bad there wasn't some place like this closer to where I live, and for  most I'm sure it's a bit of a hike.

If that's the case, then I'm all for it at this joint.\n\nThis place has all the hits.  Once you step in, it just has a chill vibe.  It's nice and dive-ish but doesn't feel like eventually you might end up fighting someone to escape.  The walls are typically adorned with some kind of art and the black walls just have a calming mood even if it is already overcast outside.  Heck, during a Sunday visit there was even a couple with a baby in the corner.\n\nI hope you're in the mood for whiskey because BR will take care of you.  An impressive list of varying qualities of bourbon awaits.  If you're like me and love bourbon but haven't had many of them, this is a boon as you can take yourself on a bourbon tour, trying everything from Blanton's to Booker's all without having to buy the whole bottle.  Additionally the bartender seemed to know his stuff, able to give me a few suggestions after I mentioned one or two bourbons I enjoy.\n\nEven if bourbon isn't your thing, there are usually some cheap drinks available, typically involving Jameson or a shot and beer deal.  They have wine on draft in addition to around six beers.  The Devil's Canyon and some other random beer seemed to be the most interesting thing available so if you're looking for some heavy diversity in your beer, you may want to try somewhere else.\n\nOne of the best and least obvious things about this place is the back room.  Well, not so much the back room as the awesome food to be had there.  I'd heard from a friend the burgers here were good and I was not disappointed.  They make their burgers with pieces of bacon in the patty which keeps it incredibly juicy and ridiculously tasty.  I had that and the craw fish grits which were also awesome.  Both were surprisingly good and well made, as I was expecting some kind of dumbed down bar version of both.  They may not sound like much, yet betwixt the two I was appropriately stuffed.\n\nWhile you're probably wondering if you're even still in SF once you get off BART, this place is worth the trek not to mention the walk goes much faster after four bourbons and a few beers.\n\nPlay it again, Sam.", "author": "Steven R."}

Got there close to six and immediately went to check the menu. I ordered the totine which is tater tot poutine. It was meh but edible, and it only went downhill from there. Homie got the catfish and sweet potato tots and after asking for a refrying of the fish it was still not fully cooked. Next to come out was the beer battered peanut butter and jelly sandwich, which lacked much peanut butter and jelly but was super heavy on bread and batter. It was listed as coming with a homemade whipped cream but came without. About an hour later after asking a couple of times for our watermelon aqua fresca, we got big cups of what turned out to be pink lemonade. The system for delivering food to tables needs work, several times the guy called out for food in different places in the bar that no one was claiming. The men's room is still broken so there is one single bathroom for all. Everyone was working their ass off and I totally respect that.

They played good music that wasn't blasting loud which I really appreciated.   I hate having to yell in order to have a conversation.  There was a cool mixed crowd:  Hipsters, average Joes, semi-ghetto people, etc.  Everyone here was having a good time.\n\nThe bartender dude was cool and recommended a beer that was good.

Soft shell crab sandwich was excellent, but a little heavy on the tartar sauce. Nice crunch to it, and the crab flavor was great when not overpowered by the sauce.

We got Mac & Goat Cheese, Pork Fries, Crispy Pork Tenderloin Sandwich, Softshell Crab Sandwich, and Sweet Potatertots to share at the table. Everything was so yummy!

Honestly, this is a really great bar.  Nothing fancy, but it's not a true dive either.  In my book, the Broken Record is something special and doesn't fall into just one category.  Cool, real people hang here...the Broken Record has clientele unlike any other bar in San Francisco.  Something really likable about this place and with killer bartenders like Nero and Liz behind the bar, this place truly has a great staff...the perfect recipe for a good time.\n\nHad some strong drinks, made a ton of new friends, and somehow the headaches and anxieties of the day just melted away.  Now that's the sign of a good bar.  Shot some amazing pool and kept winning for a couple hours.  Sorry guys...I guess I was just lucky...like the guy in the movie Caddyshack said...Cinderella story! ;)  All in all, everyone I played was nice although some people thought I was hustling them, even though I never gamble when I shoot pool.  I guess depending on how you look at it, thats actually a compliment of sorts, regardless of whether or not it was intentional.\n\nAs for the pool table, I just love that it's located right up front by the bar.  One of the bumpers is dead and the table could use some re-covering, but all in all, it is still quite serviceable.  Anyway, shot pool for hours and had so much fun there.  That's what makes the game truly great.  How many games are there where two strangers can meet over cocktails and engage in some friendly competition, regardless of skill level?  \n\nEven though I wasn't planning to have dinner, I ended up ordering one of their famous bacon burgers and finally had a chance to try it.  The bacon was a little more understated than I expected, but looking back, that's to be expected since it is ground and mixed in within the patty.  As such, it was a very juicy burger and per Pulp Fiction, I felt that it was \"one tasty burger\" :)\n\nTruly a great place and regardless of whether someone categorizes it as a neighborhood bar or a dive bar, Broken Record is truly outstanding in either category.

Hands down. The place is pretty small and when my girl friends and I got there, the first words we uttered were \"sausage fest.\" Once we got inside we noticed that there were a significant amount of girls, although they were enjoying their good food in the back where they have a roomier dining area.\n\nThe bartenders here are really nice and are willing to help you out in choosing the crazy selection of beer they have. One of the favorites of the night was \"Fuck Your Stupid Wheat Beer\", which our nice bartender Brent suggested. Very light and sweet for the people who aren't beer drinkers, like my friend who isn't a beer drinker by any means but was converted that night. Also I tried out Maui Coconut Porter, 6 dollars for a can but it was some damn good Hawaiian beer. I'm pretty sure this is one of the only places in San Francisco that carries a wide selection of domestic beer. Let alone beers infused with coffee and chocolate.\n\nThe atmosphere is great. Not pretentious by any means or too \"dive bar-y\", but a friendly and comfortable place where you can just hang out with a few friends to try out some delicious beer and they even have 300 year old Bourbon on tap which I'm dying to try. Just knock back a few bottles, play some pool, and put on some classic rock or old school classics on the jukebox and you're good to go!\n\nThe neighborhood seems sketchy at night, but if you're driving, as long as you park close by and not on the main street, your car will be in a safe spot. But I would advise you to just take the 29 or 54 since it stops right in front or nearby the bar.", "author": "Leslie K."}

The dining area is in the back behind the bar where you order at the counter and they bring the food to you. \n\nIt was somewhat of a chaotic scene as the line to order food grew quickly (in large part to all my friends getting there around the same time).  Once you order, you let them know where you'll be and they bring the food out to you.  No number, no receipt, but somehow they find you by shouting out your name.  \n\nIt helps that you can just wait the bar and it's even better that the bartender makes some great drinks.  For sazeracs, he chilled the glasses and coated with absinthe, used Bulleit rye and then burnt lemon peels for an amazingly complex but perfectly executed cocktail.\n\nBut the main reason to come to this middle-of-nowhere destination?  The food.\n\nThe somewhat upscale comfort food contrasts with the atmosphere but I actually liked that.  The lobster mac & cheese was unbelievable (more of a creamy base instead of thick cheese).  Another hit was the crawfish grits ... my favorite.  The large pulled pork sandwich was tender and juicy with a slightly toasted bun and went really well with the sweet potato tots.  \n\nDefinitely leave some room for dessert because the Tcho chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting and vanilla bean ice cream was amazing ... you'd expect something this well-crafted to be served at high-end establishments.\n\nDefinitely bang for your buck too.  Everything is $10 or less and you will be stuffed.\n\nI've never really ventured into this neighborhood but I think I'll definitely be coming back to eat (and drink) here again.", "author": "F. P."}

I don't even remember where we heard about it, but on a night without kids, decided to give it a try.  I think the bourbon on tap is a gimmick, but their extensive range of delicious, and unusual bourbons, is not.  Draft beer selection is terrific.  Service is sweet, if a bit scattered sometimes, but hey.\n\nNow onto the food.  Food is ordered separately in the back.  So you can bring your beer to the back, or order your food to be brought up to the bar area. Nothing they make is bad, nothing.  We've tried the buttermilk fried chicken, a special shrimp and grits recipe (A-mazing!), but it's the burger I'm coming back for.  First time we went, we ran into a dad and son who were working their way around the country, looking for the best burger.  Broken Record was it for them.  So on our next visit, we tried it, and OMIGOD, that truly is the best burger ever.  And I get around.\n\nMy quibble is the attitude of the kitchen waitstaff (singular).  I get your food is great. I get that this is your passion.  I get that there is just one of you.   It's one thing to make folks wait to take their order while you deliver some food, and it makes perfect sense to bus another table on your way back.  But just 'cause those guys in front of me _insisted_ on ordering one at a time does not make me a bad person.  Neither does the fact that I came here from work, so I'm not in my torn jeans, with my edgy t-shirt.  Making me (and the four folks behind me) wait 20 minutes to place my order while you get everything lined up, perfect, so that the chefs eventually have no orders in the queue isn't cool.  It isn't hot.  It isn't nice.  Your mother taught you better.", "author": "Christina R."}

Seriously though, the grub at Broken Record is well worth any trip of whatever distance or amount of time on multiple occasions throughout the week. \n\nAbove all else, TRY THE PORK FRIES. Even without the pork, that cheese sauce over the waffle fries induces multiple mouthgasms which orchestrates wonderfully with any of the other items on the menu to produce a symphony of deliciousness, such as the crawfish grits. Considering I'm a fan of grits and crawfish in general, the pairing of the two with bacon and cheese is just mindblowingly awesome. Seriously. Borderline religious experience.\n\nHonestly, basically anything on the menu will not disappoint. (Bacon ground right into the burger patty. WHAAAAT?!) However, the buttermilk-fried chicken wings and the mac & goat cheese did seem a bit sub-par compared to the quality of rest of the dishes. (Though my bias against the latter may just be because I love Mission Cheese.) \n\nIt's really unfortunate that they're only open for dinner through midnight.

I'm still waiting for the day they'll have those amazing pork waffle fries with cheese - which is probably never.\n\nI have my moments when I'm totally looking for a dive bar scene with cheap drunkie food, but I also don't want to sit down in an area that smells like pee. But at broken record, once you walk past the bar to the back, it smells like urine everywhere. Very appetizing. Out of their options, I usually end up getting 1) the mussels, which are pretty good as mussels always are 2) the jambalaya fritters, which are pretty dry but what else am I supposed to get? they sound so cool, but when will I ever learn. 3) some type of wings, which are good as wings also always are 4) truffle mac n cheese, which is really tiny but good and 5) regular fries, b/c they only ever have regular fries when I'm there. What happened to cheesy waffle fries?! \n\nMaybe when they start bringing back the good food I'll update my review.", "author": "Kate Y."}

We strolled all the way into the back and BAM - I was suddenly in a well-lit room of a dozen tables and an open kitchen manned by two people. I was then promptly sent to the back of a wrap-around line of eager 20-somethings. It took an hour to get to the front.\n\nOnce I got there, I knew exactly what I wanted--a feat easily accomplished after an hour of staring at the large menu and watching fellow patrons attack everything put on their tables. Although the Buttermilk Chicken was tempting, I decided to be adventurous and go with Pork Fries, Crawfish Grits, Crab & Prawn Roll, Sweet Potatertots, and -- wait for it -- Mac & Goat Cheese.\n\nThe Pork Fries would have been awesome on another menu, but when stacked next to foods with more complex flavor, it had no footing with me. And those Sweet Potatertots are a nice idea, but tasted like they came from an Ore Ida bag. The Crab & Prawn Roll had the exact texture I crave in a Lobstah Roll-- a warm soft bun and cold seafood. But the Grits and Mac & Cheese were tops. Don't leave the place until you've had both.\n\nTwo inconveniences: 1) if you wait a long time to order, you'll wait another long time to get your food. 2) good luck finding a place to sit on a Friday. Tables are like jewels in this place and they close the outdoor patio after 9pm, cutting down on your options. \n\nBut I was blown away by these flavors, so I didn't even feel like I was standing.

We wanted to try the wings but they were out.  The portions were huge and were enough to share among the six of us.  The pork fries and the crab and prawn sandwich were delicious, but I didn't really like the sweet potato tater tots probably because I don't like sweet potatoes in general.  I also had the midori sour and it was pretty strong.\n\nThe next time my friends and I came here on a Wednesday night and it was very crowded and couldn't find any seats so we decided to order the food to go.  I ordered the Buttered Fried Chicken and Pork Fries.  I waited over thirty minutes for my food and it turns out that they messed up on my order.  They offered to give me my money back if I didn't want to wait longer but I just decided to wait since it's already been so long already.  When I finally got my order, that guy also gave me twenty bucks because I guess they felt bad for making me wait.  I paid $17 for my order and they gave me a twenty so I profited three bucks! Whoo hooo! I think the portions are much smaller when you take it to go so you should eat there if you can! The buttered fried chicken wasn't good, I don't see what all the hype is about, it was tasteless, so I was disappointed.", "author": "Amy C."}

The front of the place is the main bar area, while the back has a few booths and counter top to enjoy their yummy pub treats. Unfortunately, we were too full to give their food a try, but from the looks and smell of it- it was some good grub!\n\nAfter contemplating on what to do- stuff ourselves or go back and get a drink, we decided to get a drink. Brett, one of the bartenders overheard me talking about how clueless I was to my roomies and gave me a cup of \"Fuck You're Stupid\" to try. I LOVED IT, which was hard for me to believe since I really don't care for beer. Apparently, I have a taste for the wheat beers. So thank you Brett!

Located on Geneva, where parking can be miserable. The drinks are nothing out of the ordinary, except the fact that you can get a tower and the staff is pretty chill.

The burgers are good, the fries are good, the grits are good. Everything. You really cant go wrong with anything on their menu for food.

I like the show and have tried to go to places that they have visited in different cities, so I thought we should check it out. I also read some other Yelp reviews before visiting.\n\nA Few Facts:\nBroken Record does not open until 5pm, and don't serve food until 6:15pm. They have a limited draft beer selection, but have some decent out of the ordinary options. Bottled beer selection, very limited. A large selection of liquor, a few wine options. One bartender, two people working in the kitchen.\nOur Experience:\nI was excited to experience a little of the REAL SF area and finally got to visit Broken Record. My first impressions were that it is a very small neighborhood \"dive\" type bar, but somewhat inviting. My friends and I sat down right after they opened and enjoyed a few beers before they started serving food. The small bar top was already filled up, so we sat at a table right by the front window. We walked to the back, because there is no \"table service\", to order food. Pulled pork sandwich, beef brisket sandwich, beef and bacon burger, sweet potato tots, and mac n cheese. All of our food was very good, but not super cheap. The mac n cheese has goat cheese with cauliflower and green peas which I thought was very good. The sweet potato tots are great! All of our sandwiches were very good. The staff was very nice and accommodating. All in all it was a great experience and will definitely be back again.", "author": "Mike H."}

All I could think of while devouring my half (I shared...sadly) was this: \"I want to dip my balls in it!\"  I think I just dated myself with that comment, but I do not care. And the burger! Oh my god, the fact that the bacon was mixed into the meat and then cooked up and served with two slices of american cheese was almost too much. Almost. I was sad when my half was gone....the heart attack I could have had at the table was soooo worth it. It was so decadent and so delicious, I felt like punching a baby.

There's two sections, the front houses the bar, the locals, a pool table, and a mounted tv for those ever so important sports games. But the back room is where I like to be. It's a nice little mini-restaurant and the kitchen makes some delicious food. I like to think the the front section is designed to scare off hipsters and yuppies.\n\nThe kitchen in the back is \"cute\" for lack of a better word. Low-lighting and relaxed music. The chalk-written menu changes often to accommodate the seasons. My absolute favorite is the Tiger Prawn Sandwich, but they didn't have it on the menu the last time I went. Other good dishes include the pulled pork sandwich, chicken wings, sweet potato tots, lobster bisque, mac and cheese... honestly there's not much on the menu that I DIDN'T like. Soul food is definitely a nice change from all the Asian cuisine near my workplace.\n\nThe kitchen also has a projector that the chefs use to play their favorite videos, without sound so they usually play videos with subtitles. One that I see often, and probably the most amusing, is the Shaolin Monk training where one scene showed monks sleeping on rope, upside down and in awkward positions. There was another scene where 7 monks couldn't rip off a bowl placed on another monks belly.\n\nMy only complaint, is that the place is a little small and the food takes a while to get to your table.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-09-05", "description": "Broken Record, why must you play with my emotions? ...everyone likes you. Everyone. But me? I really, really wanted to. Sigh...\n\nI did my homework the night before coming to Broken Record by looking at their menu and pre-deciding what to order. It was settled. I told myself, by 8:30PM of tomorrow night, the fat man inside of me that's been dreaming of lobster mac and cheese and pork fries will be satisfied. Tenfold. \n\nCome Thursday night, I was left with so much disappointment. For starters, as I stood in line to order my food, the words that were written above on the menu board drove the sharpest stake right through my lobster yearning heart: Lobster Mac and Cheese available ONLY on Fridays and Saturdays. And it was a Thursday night. Le Sigh. The second disappointment arose when I noticed the pork fries were not listed on the menu. I proceeded to ask the folks at the counter if pork fries still exist, but once again was shot down with disappointment number two -- the pork fries were no longer an addition to the menu. \n\nI ended up succumbing to an order of regular fries with lobster dipping sauce (it was featured on the menu of the day.) I opted for this selection since I couldn't get lobster mac and cheese -- I decided the lobster dipping sauce would suffice. Unfortunately I wasn't the biggest fan of the sauce -- the consistency was way too watery to hold any lobster flavor on my pitiful lukewarm overly fried french fries. Despite my lack of satisfaction towards their fries, I was pleased to see that they did give a generous portion and for a full basketful of fries, I only paid a whopping $2. Besides the $2 fries AND their choice to play the freaky movie Funky Forest, which had some sort of awesome alien butt sex scene, the beer towers were probably the next best thing. I didn't get to try any sandwiches or burgers. A few friends shared the sweet potato tots, I tried a few bites, but just couldn't get into them.\n\nThe last disappointment about Broken Record was the fact that security wasn't strongly enforced at the entrance of the bar. Although I don't care too much about getting carded, I found it alarming how there was nobody to filter out the front. There was this creepy bum lady in a dirty blood spotted blue jacket that kept pestering the guests in Broken Record. She would come up to several people, invading their personal space. She would literally stand 5 inches from your face, while whispering incoherent nonsenses and rubbing her nose as if she were Tony Montana. The lover gave her a dollar so she would stop pestering our table, but after she made her round around the room, she came back to him asking for $5. Her presence did disturb a few of my friends as we were just trying to enjoy ourselves without having someone beg for money. \n\nTo visit Broken Record again or not to? I think my final decision relies heavily on what the occasion being celebrated there would be (i.e. best friend's bdays), but to visit Broken Record based on a non-mandatory occasion? I'm not too sure if that'll ever be likely.", "author": "Ally C."}

The pork tasted like they took their time with the marinade and you can definitely taste the quality.  It was sandwiched between two buttery toasted buns.\n\nFried Broccoli - When you think \"fried\" you think drenched with oil.  However, I think they \"toaster oven'ed\" the brocolli to give it a nice toasty crunchy texture.

Shit, I need somewhere to floss all these cute dresses and fierce ass heels I buy and there's only so many weddings I get invited to. But about 19.5 hours of the day, I'm really a hoody and kicks kinda chick. I wish I could look flossy and well put-together all the time but fact of the matter is I have no time. So when my homegirl took me to Broken Record in the Mission, I felt right at home.\n\nThis gem of a dive bar looks like any ordinary, neglected neighborhood bar from the outside. Once you walk in, there's a pool table and remenants of a previously played Beer Pong game. I was already sold right then and there. But if you go all the way down the hall to the back of the building, surprise there's a restaurant with the most eclectic menu (although sparse) and friendliest staff. We originally came for the tiger prawn and avocado sammich, but I'm assuming the switch it up every now and then 'cuz it (along with the fried oyster po'boy sammich) was no longer on the menu. However, the crab and corn fritter with avocado sammich was so it was a go from there.\n\nThe rest of the night consisted of silence as we became pre-occupied with the basil aoli spread and bacon fries. YES. I said bacon fries. I was so full from beer and crab fritter I only hate half of my sammich (which still tasted damn good this morning btw) - but u know there's always room for dessert! Just because it sounded interesting I had \"The Elvis,\" which is an ice cream sandwhich made with 2 oatmeal peanut-butter bacon cookies (yes i said bacon again) and homemade roasted banana ice-cream. It was a little weird because I do not eat bananas and to taste bacon bits here and there but apparently some people like to have their sweet and salty fix.\n\nI'm pretty sure whatever regulars Broken Record has will hate me for writing this review, and I can't blame them. I almost wanted to keep it all to myself and my close friends too but as a self-proclaimed food connoisseur I felt obligated to share my findings.

It's for the food silly, so go hungry!   I took a \"first -date\" because I knew we could have a great restaurant quality meal minus the formality.  \n\nIt was a Saturday night about 8pm, so the front end of the bar was hopping.  People shooting darts, playing pool, watching basketball and making friends over drinks and delightful looking fare.  We were greeted in the front by Ali who was dropping off food to patrons at the bar, and when we walked down the skinny hallway to the back room it was hopping too.  \n\nA couple of sizable groups were taking up a good portion of the space so we staked our claim to one open table (on a nice day there's also a good-sized patio of seating) and got in line to peruse the options (chalkboard menus are above the open kitchen).  The menu is strategically limited for smooth execution, but I've found the options are adequate even when you bring a vegetarian friend (grilled portabello mushroom sandwich on toasted  homemade roll, homemade mac n cheeze without the optional bacon, both yum).  \n\nI've been there a few times now and finally decided I'd set up this profile so I could give some well-deserved kudos to the 3 man crew (James/Shane/Ali) making magic behind the plexi-glass.  We asked them for ordering advice with great results in what we were soon to enjoy.  \n\nAfter we ordered the food we popped up front for beverages and were waited on by a sweet bartender with great attitude as well as hot tattoos.  Took our drinks back, had a really nice chance to converse in the comfortable din of conversation and buzz of weekend bar friends energy (there's also a screen on the wall which was playing Fast Times at Ridgemont High...nice bit of nostalgia ;)  \n\nAnd then...THE FOOD CAME appetizer first...Sashimi tuna with avocado and mango, served with home-made thick slice potato chips with coarse salt crystals (seriously, amazing flavor combo).  Well-timed arrival of meal a few minutes later, including a bacon burger (bacon is ground into the beef...why didn't anyone think of that earlier?), skinny style french fries and an absolutely perfectly- seasoned pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw in it.  \n\nNote: do not let nervousness about juice dripping off your hand in front of a first date make you miss this sandwich it's totally worth the napkins.  \n\nAll in all the experience was an absolute delight, with attentive server Ali and focused, flawless chef efforts.  As we were wrapping up eating the chef (James Moissey) came out and offered to treat us (he knows me now) to our choice of the dessert options.  \"Tcho\" chocolate bread pudding and home-made vanilla icecream...ummmm yes that one please!  Crispy-edged, soft smooth meltaway chocolate/custardy middle and cocoa power garnished scoop of icecream melting into it.  Now that I reflect back, that treat may be what clinched it for me to finally set up this profile and share Broken Record kitchen info with others.    \n\nHeck my experience was so great last night maybe I'll even return with the same guy.  Regardless, I'll keep going back and I hope you check it out too.  Say hi to the boys and the bartender, these are good people!", "author": "maila b."}

The prawns were bulky and succulent and not overly breaded. The broccoli had a nice kick with red pepper flakes and Parmesan cheese. The biscuits were large and made a great tool to scoop up the last of the mac and cheese. Ooh the bacon fries. If you've ever wondered what to do with the left over bacon fat I have your answer. Use it to make french fries. These were the reason for the coma, but don't take it from me; experience it for yourself. \n\nI would say that the atmosphere is a good place to relax.

Trivia on Monday nights at 9, as well as a dart league, beer pong tournaments, pool, and other fun bar activities. And best of all an outdoor patio in back. I LOVE their sweet potato fries and the hot wings (which are served with the sauce on the side). \n\nThe bar has about 9 beers on tap .. including F**k your stupid wheat beer which is made especially for this bar. It is named after the bar's slogan. The other beers on tap usually include .. Arrogant Bastard, Trumer, Guinness, PBR, Fat Tire, Sierra Nevada,  a porter, and a few others that I am not remembering right now. They also have whiskey on tap ... currently 4 Roses whiskey. If that isn't your favorite, there are 300 other whiskeys to choose from. This bar definitely is worth a visit. The beers are listed on a blackboard up front and they do change the selection from time to time.  On Fridays the stout beer (generally Guinness) is $2 until the keg runs out or  $4 for the BOOT of stout.\n\nHead on to the back and you will find the marvelous kitchen... with another menu on the blackboard. The menu changes constantly but there are a few staples generally on the menu .. a pulled pork sandwich, a bacon burger, a portabella burger, a fried chicken sandwich, some type of macaroni and cheese, Buffalo Wings, and french fries and sweet potato fries. \n\nThe other items on the menu vary .. including the french fries ..which might be bacon fries or Parmesan fries or truffle fries. Sometimes they have wraps, some times roasted peppers, and always something new to catch your attention. \n\nI rarely visit without having an order of Hot Buffalo Wings ... which generally has 6 pieces of fried wings and drumsticks accompanied by a bowl of HOT sauce and a bowl of bleu cheese and some celery sticks. It makes for perfectly crunchy spicy hot wings every single time..and the pieces are not the little miniature versions you get at some other places. \n\nThe sweet potato fries are always perfectly crispy and cooked to perfection and the dipping sauce which is kinda of a ranch sauce with dill is delicious. The regular fries often come with bacon (who knew fries and bacon were such a great combo) .. although sometimes it Parmesan or something different. I like them all but tend to stick with the sweet potato fries unless bacon fries are on the menu. \n\nThe pulled pork sandwich with cabbage can vary from time to time, sometimes it is great and other times it is just good. It feels like a healthier option than some of the fried items or the macaroni and cheese with bacon. \n\nI have only tried the burger once (so far). The bacon is incorporated into the patty ... not the crisp slabs you get on top at other place. It was pretty decent although ours was served fairly rare which might be a turn off to some. On the other hand the tomato was a tasty heirloom tomato not the tasteless beefeater tomatoes you get at many of the other burger places. I will have to try the burger again some other time. \n\nAll of their meat is top quality .. nitrate free, hormone free bacon, and the beef is Niman ranch or something similar. This is stated right on the menu .. and the 'bar food\" is definitely worthy of a taste. \n\nThe macaroni and cheese is quite delicious and filling. I tend to find it a bit too heavy unless I am sharing it with my companions. \n\nI constantly hear people rave about the desserts .. made by a real pastry chef .. but I haven't tried them yet so I don't know if I agree, but they do always sound delicious.", "author": "Cat C."}

The chefs are off on Monday nights and the kitchen only offers a limited menu.** \n\nAt the recommendation of my friend and fellow food-enthusiast, a small group of us headed to Broken Record last Monday. We stepped up to the counter to order Pulled Pork Sandwiches and Fried Broccoli. Bad news! The guy behind the counter told us that the chefs were all off on Monday. He pointed to a smaller chalkboard menu that listed the handful of items that would be available that evening: chips/fries, a few sausages, and tomato soup. \"For future reference\" he advised that they would only serve from the smaller menu on Mondays.\n\nWe ended up ordering 2 baskets of fries and a few beers. I'm still on the fence about this place, since I technically couldn't taste much. The fries were actually pretty tasty, perfectly well-done, and crunchy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-02-05", "description": "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives is a great show featuring great food but it can cause restaurants like the Broken Record to be a failure of its own success. Bottom line is that this restaurant hasn't adapted its business to the volume of customers resulting in chaos. I can almost handle the 30 minutes in line or even 30 minutes for the first entree/appetizers. But an average of 10 minutes between appetizers/entrees and then another 30 minutes from the last entree to desert is a bit much. The randomness is also frustrating with food runners yelling out entrees hoping they get it to the right tables and right people. BTW, plan to sit with other people because space is very limited. Dirty dishes are often left on the tables and no tables were wiped down in the 2 hours and 20 minutes we were there. Hint to owner....get more people working in the kitchen, better system for getting food to customers, don't run out of food, etc. \n\nThat said the pub grub food ranged from awesome to disappointed. The Tex-Mex Toast was awesome with a nice spicy kick, the lobster mac-n-cheese was very good (a bit soupy though), the crab cake/shrimp sandwich was just okay (and not the same as featured on the show), and the smores sunday was a disappointment with bland chocolate icecream, graham cracker crumbs, and mini-marshmallows that weren't even melted.  \n\nBottom line, the Broken Record is not a restaurant that I can recommend even for the bragging rights of having been to a \"Triple-D\" featured restaurant.", "author": "Darrin J."}

The item that really enticed me was an Ox Tail Polenta.  Unfortunately, there were not too many reviews on that and I assumed that they had taken it off the menu.  It appears that the menu changes slightly daily and I was disappointed to see that they didn't have it on the menu.  \n\nThey did have an Ox Tail Ragout (with a flat pasta).  We got that, the Crawfish and the Seafood Chowder.  The Ragout was a little bland, and the Crawfish were pretty average.  The Seafood Chowder was excellent, after we had to send it back because it was cold.  \n\nThe greatest asset of this divey bar is the atmosphere and the vast bourbon selection.  When I asked for advice, the bartender happily asked for my price range and what kinds of bourbon I liked.  I asked for something smoky, and he absolutely delivered.  There were also a few American Whiskeys on tap, that were greatly priced $5-6.  The one I chose wasn't that great, but for $5, it served its purpose.  \n\nI really wish I could go back and try some other items on the menu, but our stay was only so long, we only had public transport, and it was quite a bus ride (40 min) from the financial district.  The bus went through some sketchy areas so it's not recommended.  One of the teens that boarded the bus wore a ski mask (though it was a little chilly) that was a little suspicious.

Then Ryan and Catherine took over with a menu I can't remember cause it was like two years ago.  Anywayz they moved onto Bruno's down on Mission Street which I have only been to once and I was kinda drunk so no Yelp review on that one.\n\nSo the new team back there blow my mind when I go there to eat, Amazing menu, not overly expansive just right with all the good stuff, Beef and Bacon Burger, Portobello mushroom sandwich, Sweet potato tater tots, chicken wings and, all kinds of hella good sh*t. The food is always good quality with well sourced food.  Defiantly not the crap you could buy at Costco which I am sure would be cheaper and easier for them but that is what sets them apart.  \n\nThe only thing that you need to remember when going here is that it is a very small kitchen that is extremely busy and only two guys who work it.

We were starving so we went straight to the back and looked at the colorful menu written on the chalk board.  The overall atmosphere was cute and has that home sweet home kind of comfort that was well paired with the staff, the food and the drinks.\n\nI ordered the duck confit potato skins, and my boyfriend ordered the burger with the crab fritters and a basket of fries.  This place is completely cash only by the way, but everything is less than $10 and the portions were pretty good for the price.\n\nI really like the duck confit potato skins.  It was cheesy, the skin was crispy, the duck was shredded and it was covered in ranch and green onions.  Yum. the flavor blends well together and it was a nice pairing for a snack and a beer type of deal.\n\nMy boyfriend's crab fritter sandwich was delicious.  As soon as i had a bite of his fritters I wish I ordered that too.  The outside of the fritter was crispy and had a nice flaky crunch.  The inside was soft, crab meat, and some corn bits.  and the sandwich was like a burger with lettuce, avocado, tomatoes and some sauce.  Perfect blending of flavors, and the textures were amazing.  \n\nThe basket of fries was surprisingly yummy.  They reminded me of the McDonald's fries, the texture/crispiness and they had their own unique flavor of course.  \n\nBeers by the glass were $4 each. Not bad.\n\nThe staff was friendly.  The girl at the bar seemed a little drunk and poured the wrong kind of beer but when I told her she apologized and gave me what I asked for.

Came on a toasted bun, aged cheddar.. and lettuce etc. I usually order w/ American, so it was different for me. \nPulled Pork - My husband LOVED it. It appeared small compared to my huge burger, but my hub loved every bit of it. He is even considering coming by during his lunch time to grab a bite. (He works from 4pm-2am.. so its his lunchtime then) \nBacon Fries - Fries were awesome. The bacon part of it not so much. Paid extra for the bacon, but it just didn't work quite right.. maybe not enough bacon. \nMac N Cheese - Uhhh, I may be biased.. but I like the creamy Velveeta cheese. Again my husband enjoyed it, but I did not. I might be on the \"ghetto\" side who enjoys the cheaper.. type of mac n cheese. My favorite mac n cheese is at Red Robin.

The food in general was not bad. We had the pulled pork sandwich, bacon cheeseburger, crawfish grits, lobster mac and cheese, and fries. Crawfish grits were good. The pulled pork sandwich was over all disappointing with very flat flavors. Another thing that was rather annoying was that not every table had chairs so we basically ended up standing and eating our food which may have contributed to the lack of fullness because after all that food, we still had to go somewhere else to fill up!

I convinced an entire group of people going out for my friend's birthday to come here cause Im a brat.\n\nI was planning on not eating too much since we were going to go drinking after but uh....that plan went down the toilet quick\n\nSo I ended up starting with teh crab fritter sandwich. AMAZINGNESS. You can really taste the crab meat in here. You know how most restaurants skimp on crab anything and you're like wow this fried dough ball is good. well not here. and also they have aioli sauce. how can you go wrong with that.\n\nMY SECOND sandwich was the pulled pork sandwich. don't ask me how I was able to eat this too. but it was SOO Juicy and delicious.\n\nand for my third thing. I tried the elvis. ice cream sandwich with peanut butter oatmeal cookie, banana ice cream, and bacon. the bacon wuz a bit weird. i didnt like the bacon in the sandwich. but the rest of it was SOOOO AMAZINGLY GOOD!!!!\n\nanother one of my friends ordered a basket of fries and that was pretty good too.\n\nthis is a definitely MUST TRY PLACE\n\ni was disappointed to see that they didn't have the giant prawn sandwich but i don't think it matters anymore because everythign else made up for it.\n\nseriously EVERYONE sitting at my table was making the homer simpson eating noise. and they were all thinking about other people to tell/or take to the restaurant. and that has never happend in my life before.\n\nthe prices here are incredibly reasonable especially for the quality of the food here.\n\nEdit: Came back with my momma \n\nMom ordered the Duck Confit potato skins. Now this is the one thing I didn't think was that good. It just tasted like a normal potato skin I guess. And duck is pricey so they only give you two potato skins. I couldn't really taste the duck in there? I mean this was good because potato skins are always good but nothing special.\n\nI got the crab corn fritters which were DELICIOUS! you could really taste the crab meat in there and they are fried and golden to perfection. The dipping sauce that comes with this is so delicious too.\n\nAnd they gave me a chocolate chip banana ice cream sandwich which definitely wasn't as special as the \"Elvis\" but it was still good.

My bf decided to take me here because he knew I wanted to try this place. \nWhen you first walk in, you walk into the bar- quite dark and loud, as a bar should be. You keep walking and you'll get to the restaurant. It's kind of a high-end casual-- you have the chalkboard menu, the counter and stool (kind of like a diner), and the cashier where you order. On the other side, you'll find that there are two big tables, and the rest are four seater lounges. Its quite small and gets pretty busy. The furniture is dark & modern, with candles lit on every table. All in all, I was digging the ambience. \nWhen you order, you order at the cash register, which is perfect for groups. You won't have to split the bill or worry about getting change- you pay, sit down, eat, and leave a tip (there's a tip jar by the register). The only thing is, they only take cash, but surprisingly, they don't charge tax! A plus to counteract the cash only. \nWe ordered the buttermilk fried chicken wings, pulled pork sandwich, and the sweet potatertots. \nPulled pork sandwich- DELICIOUS! the bread was nice and soft (not soggy at all), the pork was nice and moist and super juicy& flavorful\n\nWings- this one is only okay- I think the flavoring could have been better, but the wings itself was nicely fried and crispy, and the inside was soft and moist. \n\nSweet potatertots- I had these last night and am still craving them now. Super crunchy but soft, generous portions, and the most amazing invention ever.\n\nWill I be coming here again? Hell yes I am!!!

There have been multiple occasions now where I saddle up, rest my fistful of cash on the bar and meaningfully try for eye contact, and watch not one, not two, but three or MORE people come and get a drink before me.

It had a lot of the things I look for in a bar, only down side it is not in my neighborhood.  Be sure to bring cash or pay the $2.95 ATM fee, credit is not taken but there is free street parking.  We were the second to arrive at 5pm, only preceded by a lady with big red cat eye glasses in for a salty beer.  Unfortunately the kitchen doesn't start serving till 6:15 so we were a bit early for food but it allowed us to check out the bar, enjoy a cocktail and GET IN LINE while saving our seat at the bar. Sports were on (49ers and Giants), pool was being played and drinks were flowing.  Fun was being had by all.  I can't express this anymore clearly; get in line for food even if it seems strange because everyone else in the dining room is seated and not in line.  By the time the kitchen opened the dining room and bar were standing room only and at least 75% of them were there for food.  If I wouldn't have gotten in line by 6pm I wouldn't have been 2nd in line but instead 25th.  Since we arrived early there was no way I wanted to end up behind all these people who arrived after me.  Although the write up said \"no happy hour\" we did get happy hour prices from 5pm-6pm on the beer, a buck off, $4.  My favorite looking drink was the $30 beer served it what looked like a gigantic beaker on a stand with a tap, so cool but of course you needed more than just one beer drinker to order it.  My Stolie soda remained the same but it was only $5.  My kind of pricing and why I venture out of the East bay and over to SF to enjoy cocktails.  Unfortunately this place isn't within walking distance to BART, as far as I could tell, so I couldn't indulge in too many on this particular day.  The food was also reasonably priced $12 for my lobster mac and cheese which had some lobster chunks but more than that the cheesy sauce was rich with lobster flavor.  I am pretty traditional about how I like my mac and cheese with only bacon as an addition and my lobster with drawn butter but this was tasty my only change would be to change out the bow ties.  The biggest surprise was my hubby who thinks lobster is just OK loved it so I was able to share.  The $10 fried pork tenderloin (schnitzel) sandwich had the best garden fresh tomatoes ever.  They almost out shined the pork but the pork and sandwich as a whole was excellent.  The side of sweet potato tater tots were $5, which felt a bit high but it was a large basket of tasty tiny tots with two dipping sauces (one being ketchup, the other maybe an aioli) which was more than enough for two, good for 4, but don't get me wrong, none were left.  With these overall prices (and after tasting the food), it is at least two of the reason why this place gets the crowds and why I will return.  One last note the menu changes daily so what I had today may not be available tomorrow, yet another reason to return.  Great Job Broken Record.", "author": "Dianne M."}

My boyfriend and I came here after we saw the place being aired on DDD. Of course we were curious and wanted to check out what all the hype was about. When we went, we wanted to try out what was being showcased on the show, but apparently the show was aired a year later due to legal issues and their menu had changed. That didn't stop us from getting something from the yummy menu. We shared a prawn and lobster sandwich and tried their chicken wings. I am a HUGE fan of chicken wings and these wings were cooked perfectly. The great thing is that everything is super fresh and cooked after you order (the food isn't sitting under a bright light waiting for someone to grub it up). The prawn and lobster sandwich was also great. The fish was very fresh as well and whatever sauce was on it was creamy and delicious. \n\nThe second time I came I ordered the lobster Mac and cheese. Beware because the dish is flaming HOT (hot meaning in temperature)! This is one of the best Mac and cheese dishes I have had. Very creamy and there were bits of lobster pieces all throughout the dish. I loved the bow-tie pasta as well--different from your typical elbow pasta for Mac and cheese. We also had the waffle fries and those were great. A mix between crispy and soggy fries but not super soggy--just the right texture for waffle fries with Pork and a cheese sauce on top. \nSo basically anything you try here, you're going to be very satisfied.

I thoroughly enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich and the crispy broccoli.\n\nThe family also ordered a bacon cheeseburger (which was HUGE! ), Duck Confit potato skins (which everyone enjoyed), baked mac n cheese w/bacon, and I think a shrimp sandwich.  \n\nDefinitely returning to BR for more tasty meals.  It's a must try for everyone!!", "author": "Sarah B."}

Primarily a whiskey bar, so my advice is to ASK QUESTIONS... chances are you'll receive a detailed answer. Beers on tap aren't anything to write home about though, this is where I'd typically just leave it at 3 stars. (However, Firestone Brewing created a custom wheat beer for this bar. The name of which can't be posted on Yelp!   \"FYSWB\") \n\nThe fourth star comes into play because of the free darts and pool table in main hall, beer pong table set-up for any Bros who may wander in with that itch to scratch. NOW for the kitchen, I haven't had a chance to try it, but the options and prices are definitely right. Free range/grass fed burgers with low nitrate bacon, chili, sweet potato fries.... \n\nIm frequently right up the street, but just looking at the food alone will have me back to sample with some Arrogant Bastard.", "author": "Daniel K."}

This place is definitely a dive. Walk right through a tiny dark bar, through a hallway and into a cute little restaurant in the back. There was hardly any seating so we had to play vulcher and jump on a booth once someone got up. \n\nWe ordered the bacon cheese burger which has bacon bits ground right into the meat. It was good, but I'd compare it right along side with Red Robin.. which actually has quite good burgers. \n\nTheir papas gringo or whatever they call it (cross cut fries with cheese sauce and pulled pork) turned out to be a sham. It's huge and very filling but I will never trust all these people that raved about this dish. Yes, it sounds tasty and fun but it's a plate full of disappointment. The cheese sauce is what I feel killed it. It completely takes over the flavor of everything in this dish and soggs up the fries at the bottom big time. They had no more crisp to them by the time we got to it. I think that the pulled pork juices also contributed to some of the soggage in this plate. It was unenjoyable and completely not what I expected. Where are all the star ingredients? It all just tasted pretty much the same... Like the flavor of the cheese sauce. I know that natchos gringos aren't this boring and un-thought out. I have been told that they make their own cheese sauce but it tastes like canned which actually quite sad considering the time spent to make it home made. No goo or anything.. Just drippy ooze. Really just a complete disappointment.\n\nWe also ordered some of those butter fried chicken wings but almost forgot about them... And it seems that they almost did as well. We were just finishing our meal when all of a sudden the guy drops off a basket of dark golden brown chicken. What a surprise! I love surprises but damn.. This is nearly 20 minutes late. We were already full and forgot that we still had these. I hate reheated chicken so we had to eat it now or never. They were hot as shit (heat) because they just came out of the oven or fryer. I could barely even hold them to take a bite... Which isn't neccessarily a complaint.. But the breading was all burnt and tasted funny. We put down as much as possible and had to throw away almost half of it. I would have rather tossed the papas gringos but throwing these away wasn't the part that bothered me the most... The part that bothered me was how they were completely over cooked and late to our table. What a waste of money. The chicken inside although, was juicy and quite tasty.\n\nOur three items came out to about $27 and sodas at the bar were only a buck. Not bad excluding the disappointments.", "author": "Chris B."}

Yes, it may be on the outskirts of the City, but the trip is so worth it. (In all actuality, it's a very straightforward trip - hop off BART at Balboa Park and then take the 9X.) When I walked in to Tool blasting on the stereo, and then I remarked, \"Now we need some Nine Inch Nails,\" and lo and behold, a song of theirs played next, I knew that this bar was true awesomeness.\n\nSome friends and I pre-gamed here before the roller derby championship (and came back after the main event because we loved this place so much). We were the first ones there when the bar opened at 5:00 and chatted with the bartender, Nero, who was a super cool guy. He made us feel like he was having us over for drinks at his apartment - that kind of laid-back atmosphere in a bar can be quite a challenge to find. He seriously knows his stuff when it comes to beer and plied us with many a sample to make sure we liked what we were ordering. (He has a similar level of expertise with whiskey and scotch, both of which they have an abundance of, but we were so happy with the beer, that we just stuck with that.)\n\nThe food is similarly amazing - standard pub fare this is not. It's still very much the comfort food you would expect, but prepared (and presented) so well. I went for the mac n' cheese with bacon, which came in a cute little ramekin, as well as the chorizo corn on the cob. So delicious! We returned for more drinking merriment and dessert after roller derby, with this time around my food of choice being the Elvis, a most amazing concoction of oatmeal cookies with bacon sandwiching banana nut ice cream. I know, it sounds weird, but it was uber tasty! My lone disappointment was the fact that the kitchen closes at 11:00 pm for savory items, (which seemed a little early for a Saturday night...just sayin'), so I didn't get to try the toast with tomatoes, olive oil and sea salt.

It instantly became one of my favourite spots in the city, and shall forever remain on my recommendation list.\n\nSundays are definitely the best days to visit this place, as they serve their famous \"bacon burgers\".  Except this is not a regular bacon burger.  Instead of piling strips of bacon on top of the burger, the bacon is chopped up and mixed into the patty, ensuring pieces of bacon in every single bite.  This is one of the most creative/original burgers I have ever had.  The only \"flaw\" (and this is a very difficult problem, keep on reading) is the texture of the patty.  Since the bacon is mixed into the patty, the patty has to be cooked to well to ensure that bacon pieces are fully cooked -- and I prefer my burger medium to medium-well.  A patty that is cooked to well-done is slightly too firm for my likings.  Perhaps they could somehow pre-cook the bacon slightly to reduce cook time in the patty.\n\nIn addition to the burger, I also had a tiger-prawn sandwich... it was just as incredible.  The prawns are deep fried and are slightly spicy, combined with the aioli sauce and creamy avocado, it was heavenly (well, I'm extremely partial because I love prawns and avocados).  The aioli sauce provide the perfect balance to the crispy exterior of the prawns.\n\nWe also had an order of corn with red pepper sauce.  The sauce was so delicious one of my friends destroyed a prawn sandwich just so that he could dip the bread in the sauce.\n\nAfter finishing one appetizer and five entrees between the three of us, we had the opportunity to meet our hero of the night -- head chef James Moisey (who, my friend thinks is extremely hot).  We conversed a little about his creations, I was honestly very surprised by his understanding of food.  I felt as if I were talking to a chef at a Zagat restaurant instead of a dive-bar.  After hearing our appraisal for his dishes, he offered to make us something from his secret-menu (this was already after they'd closed their kitchen) -- duck confit!  Duck leg cooked in its own oil served inside baked potato skins.  Absolutely amazing.\n\nEverything I had that night exceeded my expectations by lightyears.\n\nAfter a little research on Google, I quickly learned that James is actually the/a sous chef at Firefly -- and this finally satisfied my curiosity as to why the food was so good.\n\nDrop everything, take a cab, rent a zipcar, buy a jet, just GO!

Maybe I need to return for the crispy pork tenderloin!\nWe had the pork fries which were okay, but a bit overpriced for essentially curly fires with a cheesy sauce and some pulled pork thrown together haphazardly. Also asian bbq wings were cooked right but the glaze needs a citrus or acid element like rice vinegar, they were too soy sweet tasting. The star of the show was the crawfish grits which were delicious even though the crawfish is probably not fresh being that we are in San Francisco.\nStaff were friendly but very busy, not so hot on a place where you have to fight for a seat but have no qualms sitting with other diners, just want to know that when I order there will be a comfortable place for us. The food is priced around the same as other places where you have your own table and someone to serve you, so it's not a bargain kitchen counter by far.\nThe bar was my favourite part! Bartenders who look like they know what's up, Arrogant Bastard on tap and fantastic selection of liquor. Since it was my birthday I selected a 16yr old Bruichladdich for $15 a glass. She gave me a healthy pour but wasn't doing any favours either which is what I would expect. \nAll in all, you definitely want to go around 6pm on a weeknight to avoid waiting too long in line (we didn't have to) and getting your own table, because to me waiting an hour for this food is not worth it, since it is less than that at places like Brenda's and Front Porch for better food. Seemed to be a lot of first timers like us, noone seemed to be shouting hallelujah after their first bite either.

BF had the Crispy Pork Tenderloin sandwich that had a spicy mayo concoction. It was to die for. The outside was crispy while the inside was tender. BF's brother had the pulled-pork sandwich that the dive-in bar is famous for. It was really good as well. Very tasty. Finally,  I had the (wait for it...) scrumptious Soft Shell Crab Roll that was featured in the show, only this time it was kicked up a notch. The sandwich had fried tiger prawns and soft shell crab, avo, louisiana hot sauce, and crab mayo! It was delicious. We also ordered a side of Pork Fries that had pulled pork on top and cheese sauce, and the lobster mac n cheese that was so effing good. This will definitely be one of the spots that BFand I will come back to in the future. They also serve over 300 kinds of whiskey (although I'm not a big fan) with a full bar.

There is limited seating inside so get your eagle eyes working and scope for a table that's leaving. There's additional seating outside but SF can get quite cold and this may not bode well if you want hot food. My friends and I ordered our food (mac and cheese, pork tenderloin sandwich, sweet potatertots, portabello mushroom sandwiches, and crawfish grits). The food took a bit to come out but there is a disclaimer on their website warning patrons of the wait because of the limited cooks and small space. That being said, everyone in my party really enjoyed their food and those potatertots were depleted very quickly. Their bar drinks are pretty strong and worth your money.

(sept. 21 is my bday, feel free to send gifts.)\n\nI had never been to this bar before, but I wanted to try something new and I had heard good things.  Except for it being overcrowded with the free-pabst douches screaming over the foosball table, it wasn't a bad first impression.\n\nAs the evening wore on and the douches vacated, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I felt really at home here.  I met some regulars who were super nice and partook in some cupcakes with us.  We had cocktails and played pool and I was really happy to be around good people and my closest friends.  Thanks to the locals who live nearby who made us feel so welcome.\n\nThe best part?  The owner/bartender, Jason, poured me a chocolate cake shot for my bday and they also relented and let me listen to at least 30 minutes straight of songs by the smiths.   Free shots, free pool, and THE SMITHS?   It doesn't get any better than that for me.   I will be sure to be back (but not on free-beer fridays!)", "author": "Courtney Y."}

I don't know if I'd take a girl here on a first date (it is a dive bar) but I would definitely take a female here on a 5th or 6th date (if you even keep track the number of dates you've been on past that point).\n\nI believe this place will best serve those looking to chill out, eat great food, and enjoy cheap libations.

Yes, I can see why the locals would be psyched about getting a bar this cool in the Crocker-Amazon, and why they're hoping it gets enough business to stick around.  So never fear, the Yelp Elite is here to spread the word.  (Ok, delusion of grandeur over.)\n\nCrocker-Amazon is one of those ultra-obscure SF neighborhoods that I'm always hoping will turn out to hold some sort of secret gem, so when I saw this brand-new bar with great reviews and tales of free PBR (on Fridays), wild game sausages, and an extensive menu of Scotch, while being neither ghetto nor overrun by hipsters, it sounded almost too good to be true.\n\nBut having been I can safely say that this place has nailed it.  It's also clear they have very ambitious plans for the future, with trivia nights and beer pong tournaments coming up, among other things.  It's also a very large place with two main rooms, plenty of tables and booths, two pool tables, a foosball table, darts, a movie projector, and a beer garden.  Indeed, the only downside to the place was that there weren't enough people to fill all the space, though admittedly I was here pretty early.  Nevertheless, it's still plenty cozy in the front bar area, and you can chat up the very friendly owner and the other salt-of-the-earth patrons.\n\nAs for the sausages, I was very impressed.  They run $5 each and come on a simple roll with mustard, ketchup and sauerkraut.  I had to go with the wild boar, and it was awesome, but I'm also eager to try the venison, rabbit, pheasant, and boudin blanc.  Oh, and I must also call out that they have Kilt Lifter, a brilliant \"Scottish-style\" ale from Arizona which I had never tried before.\n\nSo for all you Yelpers who have never hit the Excelsior, or think it's only good for taquerias and such, give Broken Record a try.  Maybe someday when this is a hipster's favorite with lines out the door, I'll regret saying that, but right now it's the more the merrier.\n\n(Funnily enough, as soon as I walked in here the bartender (and several of the other customers) asked where I was from.  When I told them Miraloma Park, they then asked what I was doing down here.  So I told them all about the wonders of Yelp, and they seemed impressed.  New sponsored business, perhaps?

It's funny, being from New England and moving to San Francisco has changed my definition of 'adventure' profoundly. It used to be the norm for me and few friends to pile into a car and drive an hour, hour-and-a-half into the wilderness and go hike a mountain, or pile into an off-road vehicle and go destroy one. Now I consider it an adventure to hop on municipal transportation and go to a bar I haven't been to before. So, where do I plan these adventures? Why, on my favorite website of course...\n\nYouPorn really sucks now! It used to be all this great amateur stuff, but now it's so... uhg... mainstream. Plus it really had no recommendation to offer for dive bars, either. Yelp, however, did, and told me to go to Broken Record. You don't argue with the internet anymore.\n\nKnowledge of said bar and the bus line to get there placed firmly in my brain, my friend and I set off on a thrilling expedition on the 14 Mission line. We arrive at 6, and the bar is opened for us to drink at. Now, this bar, I'd learned, is known to have a quite a collection of whiskey. Sweet! John Wayne drank whiskey and he's a total bad ass. Also a racist, but pointing that fact out will have you branded a terrorist quicker than a fist bump ever could.\n\nI don't know jack about whiskey; I fully admit this. However, this seemed like a great time to learn, and so I asked the bartender/owner Jason if he would give my friend and I a quick lesson in the basics of it. He refused to do this. Instead, he told us everything we could have ever hoped to know about the subject, and helped guide our tastes by pouring three different samples of whiskey for us to choose from, and then selecting different whiskeys for us based on our choices. \n\nAwesome! Jason is the owner here, of the bar, and now my hear--- no I'm kidding, I'm not going to say that, that'd be a little weird. However, this bar is really, really cool and it's certainly one of my favorites now.

And if you think that sounds even remotely negative then you must have never eaten a Real Burger.\n\nI've also had the Pulled Pork and Meatball sandwiches, and both were delicious on the same pillow-soft yet crisp-to-the-crunch toasted bun that is used for the burger.\n\nIf you're not in the mood for a full meal, you could certainly get by on the appetizers alone. The fritters, chicken wings, and texas toast + tomatoes are super tasty, though the duck confit potato skins are really a can't miss.

Check the date of my review because to begin with, the restaurant is under completely new command. \n\nEating here tonight, and checking out the review(s) to even see if the restaurant had decided to change it's name with the ownership change of 3 days(!!) ago has to my surprise led me to chime in.   As background, my gf and I landed here Sundays on the regular as the reviewer Taylor S. (I'll get back to his review) (I'm not calling you out) may have, after 2am work nights the Saturdays before, and lazy other nights.  We have been party to the changes of menu and strategies that the previous restaurant underwent to try and make their situation work.  They were always gracious, accomodating and I am sorry they weren't able to make things work better. They would make things off menu for us sometimes, and really were a pleasure.  They're also probably getting notification of this review...\nThe new crew has it's work cut out for it...without a doubt.  Andrew A's experience was completely commonplace to me.  Absolutely abysmal food safety practices were evidenced by I believe one ever present cook. He was always there, and always did something extremely questionable if not cringe-worthy.. That being said there was some over-arching food safety  problem. All you had to do was inhale.  Didn't anyone mention or notice the ever present sour smell in the place? I couldn't eat inside. Foul: and being in the back of the bar is no excuse...That was old mat and old grease in deep bad long forgotten places.  The smell is gone, the kitchen is cleaner to behold easily from ten feet away, and from behind plexiglass.. It leads the diner to think....and even to dare to open their eyes a little... \n\nI had a short conversation with the disciplined young man who is the exec_chef and general manager now...and also took our order.  He appreciated my compliment on ridding the place of the um...smell, and wrung his hands somewhat in spite of his obvious competent bearing to express that he thought there were possibly illegal, definitely immoral practices preceding his \"shift\"...I felt bad.  He, also mentioned he trained at a Michelin rated restaurant.  I don't know if this was the \"dude with the tude\".  He seemed chill if concerned, and the cook I talked with later who made a point of finishing his conversation with me in a gracious way when his Michelin trained gm and exec-chef asked sharply (twice) for his attention on another matter was also attentive, forthcoming and appreciated. \n\nThe last management had to ditch the brunch menu entirely because of lack of attendance...Brunch is back...Hooray.  They now take phone in's if possible...Hooray.  Those were my gf's first two questions.. \nMine was \" do you think this menu is long term?\" He answered for the most part yes.\nThis restaurant has now undergone at least three incarnations. I'm curious to see what it will evolve into..\nThe strong suit of the last was their menu.  It was comfort food from across the spectrum, and I wouldn't be surprised if forthcoming reviews are persnickety for missing it...Personal meatloaf appetizer, phenomenal (if overly salty my one time out) chicken wings, mac and cheese with pickled peppers and cured ham, mussels in a cream sauce, a range of Sunday barbecue, Thai sweet and spicy pork \"wings\",  on their brunch menu before they abandoned it : banana souffle \"pancakes\"...all delectable and the Clydesdale of their stable: a cheeseburger made with ground brisket. That was genius, and hooked me and everyone I recommended it to like a fat shiny trout.  By comparison, the present burger on offer IS yummy.  Beef and sausage patty with bacon Jarlsburg, and a very nicely done egg..The point is, they paid more for the brisket, but the new guys have to add sausage bacon and an egg (cost?) to stop me from crying for the brisket..\nBack to Taylor S...The general manager who took our order at the register asked me my preference, and I asked for medium..It arrived somewhere between blue and rare..It was pretty bad (scary) considering that there's sausage in the mix...A bad mistake for sure.   I didn't mention it to them because it's their third day, and they need to work the kinks out,  but your review made me feel like it should be addressed.  They need to figure out what's wrong with the piece of equipment they inherited or the grill cook needs a lesson from the big guy on the proper temps.  It could be either.. Since I'm addressing T's review, I also agree on the tot's thing.. It's a small menu. Don't need to waste chalkboard space on two types of tots, and no option for fries behind a bar no?  P.S. you should have tried that pork sandwich he mentioned..My girl got it, and gave me a bite: Delicious.  \n\nI'd like to get back to my thoughts on what's come after they get a feel for their new life.", "author": "Barret M."}

My woman has been dying to try this place ever since she seen it on Check Please and reading all the great reviews about it. I finally made her dream come true on Tuesday! Haha!! \n\nIt looks a bit beat up from outside, just like any other dive bar does. We walked inside and saw the bar and a pool table. I started thinking, hhhhmmmmmm... The restaurant part of this place should be somewhere in the back and sure enough, presto change-oh!! There it was!! \n\nWe headed towards the back and saw a couple of tables that were almost filled up with people so I made sure we sat down before they were completely taken. The ordering counter for food was right in front of us. We looked at the menu, which appeared to be a set menu that probably never gets changed, with the exception of the \"special of the day\"... We had an order of their Pork Fries, which I must say.. They were the BOMB!!!! Damn they were SOOOOOO GOOOD!!! I'm usually picky with pork so to my surprise, this piggy was well taken care of before he got on our plate! Porky must have been marinated in some type of seasonings and/or juices cause the flavor of it was outstanding! They piled a bunch of it on top of these waffle shaped fries and drizzled it with some lightweight spicy cheese sauce! Boy oh boy was I really feeling this dish!!! After our appetizer, my girl had the Pulled Pork sammich (as she likes to call it) and I had the Beef and Bacon cheeseburger... \n\nAs I start munching on my burger I look around it, kind of startled that I did not see any bacon, yet the burger itself tasted like there was bacon there.  That tripped me out but I instantly figured it out!! The bacon was mixed in with the beef patty!!! Wow!!! First time I've ever had it like that. It was pretty darn tasty!! My girl enjoyed her meal as well.. The environment was cool ( for a bar/eatery joint) and the staff there were very cool and nice. So why 4 stars? I'll tell you why..... They only accept CASH, which was kinda wack cause I had a card but likely my girl had cash with her. Also, I think that they could have more items on their menu. And lastly, You have to order your alcoholic beverages at the bar and then walk down to the restaurant to order your food. I found that kinda inconvenient, especially if you are to go there on a busy day and by yourself.. Other than that, The Broken Record is a must try!!  Especially for a happy hour get together or if you're in the neighborhood and feel like a great snack and drinks!! Cheers!!!", "author": "Cesar N."}

Every single last morsel was eaten and I had to stop myself from licking the cheese sauce from the fries off the plate. \n- The bacon burger was juicy and had a nice smokey flavor from the bacon ground in with the meat. I was looking for a burger tonight and it hit the spot and then some. \n- The pork fries are a meal, in and of themselves, but they also make an excelled side dish if you're feeling piggy like me. \n- The pulled pork sandwich was delicious. The meat was tender and perfectly cooked. It was also well seasoned. I don't like overly sweet sauce and this was a good balance. I had originally thought they used the same pork for the sandwich and fries, but they have two separate flavor profiles: a more savory one for the fries and a sweeter one for the sandwich.\n\nThe rest of the menu looks incredibly appetizing and I can't wait to go back to check the rest out. \n\nSure the place is loud, the wait is kinda long and it's all the way out in Crocker-Amazon.

The good-sized beer garden is the perfect place to sip brews on a sunny afternoon, and two pool tables give you something to do when you decide it's time to protect the epidermis. There's also a dart board in the front, complete with scoreboard.\n\nI like Broken Record's layout--there's enough space for you to meet up with a sizable group, but since the space is divided into a few rooms, you'll never end up screaming to be heard over the din of everyone crammed into one big space. Tables are grouped into different areas--there's a little loungy spot for two in the front, a nice big bar, various two- and four-tops scattered throughout the place, and a nice wide counter to rest drinks on while you're playing or watching pool.\n\nSpeaking of drinks, I dig this place's options. In addition to an extensive whiskey selection (prices range from about $5 to about $15), there's your standard liquor and bottled beer options (no Amstel Light, though), plus some nice breaks from the norm on tap, Kilt Lifter and Arrogant Bastard among them. Though it wasn't installed yet when I went, I was told there are plans to install a Guinness tap--here's hoping that's true.\n\nBetween the pool table, darts, good beers, and wild-game sausage options (wild boar! duck! rabbit! pheasant! It's like a Hemingway story!), this is the perfect place to spend a lazy weekend day/afternoon, or to go for a cool after-work unwind, especially now, when it stays light so late. \n\nWe're diggin' on this place and wanna see it stick around, so please, patronize this fine establishment.", "author": "Kristen S."}

I think it is the definition of a dive!  One has to pass a shady looking bar and pool room through a narrow hall to reach the room where they serve food, if you get a table.  \n\nThe place was clean and minimally decorated, yet looks nice when the candles are lit.  The bathroom was clean enough, which was good enough.  \n\nGet there before the kitchen opens, so you can get a table, and when it does; line up!  At first I wanted the pulled pork sandwich, which sounded delightful, with an apple fennel slaw and honey mustard.  However, since I hate mayo, had to skip.  I then was informed that all sandwiches have mayo; and admit it mystified me why they just couldn't omit it.  Finally I settled on the only thing without mayo that I like, the cheesy grits with crawfish.  My friends ordered a few things, including the potater tots; which were tasty.  It was my first time eating grits, and these were amazing!  The grits were creamy, with a lot of cheese, yet still had a bit of texture.  The crawfish was cooked perfectly, and the bacon delicious.  It was a fantastic dish, especially on a cold night.  However, they should probably call it bacon grits, as it totally overpowered the flavor of the crawfish.  It was so delicious, I didn't mind one bit!  I could have had two bowls!  We wish we had room for the warm brownie and ice cream, but alas...our stomachs can only hold so much.  Too bad.

We brought some friends along for good measure.  The BF and GF(guy friend) were very excited about the prospect of free beer which I thought was hilarious because they are total beer snobs.  But the GFW (guy friend's wife) and I gave our drink tickets to the boys and they giggled like a bunch of school girls looking at Playgirl for the first time.  \n\nSeriously... why is everyone so excited about free PBR?  I mean, ew.  Even if I LIKED beer, which I don't, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't like PBR.  \n\nPredictably, the BF realized just what in the hell he was drinking and after choking down half a glass, went to the bar for a real beer.  The GF followed.  GFW and I just rolled our eyes in amusement.\n\nWhile the BF and GF were drinking their slag I was having my own cocktail issues.  I ordered my usual (martini,dry, up, twist) and was completely dismayed to find that a) it had WAY too much vermouth in it and b) an entire herd of fruit flies was lying dead in the bottom of my glass.  I mean one fly?  OK.  I can overlook that.  But a herd?  I had already eaten protein that week so I took it back.  \n\nThe bartender was very nice about it and made me another martini.  With fruit flies.  \n\nSeriously.\n\nNeither of  us was very amused at this point so he made one more attempt and before he could inspect it I grabbed it off the counter and headed to our table.  (I was getting desperate for a drink, damn it!)This time there was only one fly.  I yanked him out and happily enjoyed my drink.  (I schooled him on the finer points of vermouth \"waving\" as well.)\n\nSo the bar was pretty dead for a Friday night  and we were pretty bored given all the hype.  They did allow us to order pizza and bring it in and we played several games of pool.  But the Broken Record overall?\n\nYeah.   Not so much.", "author": "LeSLiE W."}

We went primarily because of the talk of soul food - but just because you have some pulled pork and brisket doesn't make a place a soul food restaurant. This is a dive bar that strives to be more, but in the end comes up short in delivering anything other than forgettable, mediocre food. If you live nearby it's worth a shot - but  pass if it's a hike.\n\nBrisket sammy: Probably the best sandwich we tried. Decent spicy kick, but light on meat and just generally condiments. Would not go out of my way to eat it, not anything special. I honestly don't really recall exactly what it tasted like only a couple hours afterwards\n\nPull pork sammy: pretty average crap - like I said just because you have pulled pork on your menu doesn't mean you can call it a soul food restaurant. Pork was dry and somewhat tasteless. Nothing notable about it\n\nFrito Pie: now we're talkin - probably the best thing we ate, which is a little sad.. but the chili was good with big chunks of beef and a nice sweetness. Honestly though - nothing that you can't do in your kitchen with a can of stagg chili and a bag of fritos.\n\nMac and Cheese: I thought the cornmeal topping was a nice touch and bacon makes anything good. If one of the main entrees had been anything great it would have been a very good side, but sitting by itself this tasty side made it even more apparent that the main courses were very mediocre.\n\nAlligator sausage: The exotic meats here are obviously not made on site - which I think is the charm of eat something somewhat odd. The alligator sausage was touch and overly salty. I've gotten a better hotdog at safeway.\n\nOther snacks like the hot wings were overly sauced, the garlic fries were very average.

OK, sound like everything will be alright.\n\nWith the previous chef, I can honestly say everything, I mean everything I tried was amazing.

I was reviewing my list of contenders and stumbled into the review for the Broken Record.   Needless to say after reading the review I had to go.   \n\nGot to the bar at 5:30pm  and the line was already forming which gave us time to get drinks.  As a bonus they had old Kung Fu movies playing that amazingly captivated everyone's attention.   The line looked like a collection of addicts going through withdrawals waiting for their fix.    \n\nTried the following items:\n\nMac-N-Goat cheese -- They should serve with a spoon so you can thoroughly clean the last bits off.\n\nWaffle Fries with Pulled Pork and Cheese Sauce -- Lot of food and could easily be a meal.    Dangerous because you know you are full but you keep eating anyway.\n\n***Pulled Pork Sandwich***  -- Easily the best I have had in the bay area and this is without any form of BBQ sauce.   The spicy mayo was a surprisingly tasty combination with this sandwich.   \n\nCrab Sandwich -- Not what I was in the mood for but had a bit of my girlfriends sandwich and it was perfectly cooked and delicious.   \n\nThe only real issue I have is you will entertainment eat everything in front of you no matter how much you have already eaten.  Doubt you will find better bar food in the bay area and I am already planning my next visit.", "author": "william c."}

Fairly large front room, pretty large back room with booths even, AND a back patio. It was a bit too cold for patio enjoyment on this particular evening but I could definitely see it as an alt. to Zeitgeist on the warmer days. If they decide to start opening during the daytime.\n\nCool...Wild game sausages! I tried duck and venison, I think. There's buffalo, fruti di mare (sp?), and a bunch of others too. The french fries were yummy; served hot and crispy, but they need to start carrying mayo.\n\nCool...Lots of games to play.  If you're like me: fidgety -I can't sit still and just \"hang out\" most of the time- this is a good thing. Any bar with a pool table is alright in my book. BR has 2 pool tables, air hockey, Foosball, darts, and some strange games you play with ping pong balls (not a ping pong show, unfortunately, ha ha!)\n\nNot so cool...As I said, I love to play pool. The two tables are currently next to each other in the front room courtesy of some douchebag city regulation that forced the bar to pull one of the tables out of the back room and put it up front. That front area is now cramped. Nearly every angle forces you to lift your stick over a wall table, work around the ATM machine, or dodge ping pong balls. Really dampens the enjoyment of the game. Also, one of the pool tables still doesn't have light above it, making it all but useless at night.\nWorth removing a star from this review. So sorry.\n\nCOOL...The staff! The bartender was really nice and the owner, Jason was incredibly hospitable. Right the f- on, guys! \n\nFinally-\nCool...The t-shirts they sell. Go there and read their slogan yourself.

I must be having a lot of shitty weeks cause I find myself there on more Fridays than I can recall.. Or maybe there's something else.\n\nOh yea.. The food.  You order your food in the back and you just let them know where you're sitting and they'll bring it to you.  Most of the menu will change every so often.  Not sure why, but I hope they can keep the sweet potato tots on the menu permanently cause those things are legit good!  However, two things are always there.. The pulled pork sandwich and the bacon burger.  They use a brioche roll that have a little crunch when you bite into it.. It is like something you'd find at a fancy upscale restaurant, but this is in a dive bar.  Dang!   \n\nLike others have said before.. Cash only, both at the bar and at the restaurant.

They take the same sausages that have been there and not only will corn-dog them for you, they will bacon wrap and corn dog them!!! Who doesnt want a bacon-wrapped-venison sausage corn dog? \n\nThe two things tried last night were the pretzel (house made) and the fried veggie medley. \n\nThe pretzel was a typical large soft pretzel that was just about perfect. The leathery skin on the outside kept the warm and soft dough on the inside protected from drying while providing excellent texture and flavor. Served with mustard or cheese sauce, for $5, this pretzel is reason enough to come here and pairs well with some of the milder whiskey or the lighter beers. \n\nThe fried veggies were onion, cauliflower, green beans and zucchini. Dipped in a house made batter and lightly fried, the vegetables came served in a basket with a choice of ranch or bleu cheese dip. The batter was light and rich with a sprinkling of salt. The light frying, however, left the vegetables fresh and crispy on the inside. The zucchini held flavor and crunch well, as did the green beans. An excellent aside or to pair with a mixed cocktail or light beer, as the flavors of the batter and sauces proved to rich and overpowering to drink with whiskey. \n\nAll in all, a fine first offering from the ladies in the back and if this sampling is any indication of what is to come, I may start coming here for the food instead of the whiskey.", "author": "Adam L."}

Much has been written here about how great it is, so I won't repeat the obvious, just wanted to get it down that I agree.\n\nThis place is great. In the space that used to be \"Mom Is Cooking\" (you can still see the words \"Mexican Food\" painted outside)  they've created a comfortable, cool, excellent bar/restaurant great for hanging out, enjoying some cheap or well-priced alcohol and food, and listening to music that constantly gets you singing along. (Was it a jukebox? I don't even know...) You can order your food in the back area and they'll bring it to you at the bar. Nice. Creative twists on lots of typical bar food, as well as very unusual food for a bar, for the neighborhood in general. We loved the mac 'n cheese and the wings.\n\nEDIT: very sad edit: wtf!!!!!: Well, seems as though I tried it just in time. Friends tried to go get food this past .... I want to say Friday, but I'm not sure, but it was in the past week. They said a large sign announced \"Kitchen closed permanently.\" Then I read Luis C.'s review from yesterday saying Closed. Like totally closed???? My friends said the bar was still open. What gives? An investigation must be mounted. I'm very sad about this. My neighborhood so needed this place and it seemed to be supported. Their website is still there, though there's a lot less to it. And if you call the number, it says nothing about closure. So, I'm uncertain what is actually happening, but clearly there is somethin' goin' on.\n\nEDIT: 7/31/09\nIt's true, the kitchen is NOT CLOSED. After two weeks down in SoCal, as my airport shuttle headed from Bayshore up Geneva, I craned my neck to see the sandwich board sign outside as we zipped past and I noticed the foot tall letters spelling out F O O D. Yes! Just changed hands so I'll be heading back this weekend. I'm glad this confusion has all been cleared up.", "author": "Michael M."}

Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with people coming from out of town to experience something they saw on TV but this little place can't handle that volume. Last time I was there, a freakin tour bus pulled up in front of the bar, double parked, and about 30 people came in to order food...the back only sits about 20-30 people. Their food is awesome, unforgettable, totally amazballs. And I am one of those people who is willing to wait  in lines and wait close to an hour to get good food. The non-locals aren't so willing to wait and all they are doing is complaining to the cooks. There is even a sign next to the register that says \"please be patient.\" I have recently heard they have new cooks and more of them. They also apparently have a different menu all together.

Crawfish grits, to die for. Pork fries, heavy dish, but the explosion of flavor is well worth the calories. Who else does sweet potato fries?

It is a bit out there, but totally worth trying out their food if you're in the area.

Also ordered fries, that were REALLY super good for what they were. I like they keep the skins on actually, they taste crispier without being burnt. The food took awhile to come out, but it was probably the best mussels in that sauce that I've ever had, tarragon, cream and tomatoes (bread was burnt, but just used the fries to dip in the sauce). The sauce on the sliders were really good, and you can get bacon on them too (if you're so inclined). Their menu rotates each week with different food items and they only have brunch on Sundays.

Prior to The Broken Record, he was practicing his culinary magic at Firefly and brought a number of great dishes to the table.  Now, left to his own devices and free to kick bar food to a nearly unrecognizable notch, there is really no better place to go (that I'm aware of) in this city to get such a unique and generally unbelievable take on bar food staples with a gourmet twist and lots of love.\n\nSure, you can get a burger just about anywhere, potato skins too.  But...for those of you on the indefatigable search for the best burger in the city, this is a mandatory stop.  The burger is cooked perfectly medium-rare time and time again (I'm a repeat customer), and the beef is ground with bacon, producing a luscious bacon flavored patty.  The cheddar is grilled on the griddle briefly prior to being neatly placed atop the patty to give it a crispy texture and flavor...simply brilliant!   The burger is constructed with care too, which shows the love...\n\nThe duck confit potato skins are magic in your mouth, and the pulled pork is the best I've ever had, but don't take my word for it, read some more reviews!", "author": "Ben G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-06", "description": "What an interesting place; it defies any stereotypical response and that helps make it more worth the haul--and a haul it is unless you live in the Balboa Park neighborhood. The nearest bart (balboa park) is about a mile west, so it is walkable and the neighborhood felt safe even at night (we walked it). Sunday before Labor Day\nWe arrived at opening, 5pm for the bar (6pm for the restaurant). The bar is the front of the building with a pool table, dart board, couple of seating arrangements and the bar.  It is actually owned by someone separately of the restaurant in the back, which makes for a bit of a pain juggling drinks and dinner. They've tried to make it easier by letting you drink/dine wherever you can find a seat. So you can get your food in the back and bring it to the bar and have drinks easily accessible (assuming you can find space!) or you can eat in the back, but then even if you want a glass of water you've got to go the bar, get the bartenders attentiong and take the drinks back.  I imagine if you are a regular you get used to the process. As a newbie, it seemed like a bit of work and inconvenience (maybe they could add a water jug in the back?).\nWe spent an hour and a half in the bar, most of that chatting with the very friendly bar tender. He's a young guy who knows his scotch/rye/whiskey. This is NOT the place for mixed drinks. We tried a couple whiskeys (he let us taste before we bought) and a stout beer.  The place was middling busy during this time, with many regulars coming in, getting a beer and settling on the outside patio (where some of them played monopoly), throwing darts or setting up the pool table (which was free on the day we were there--maybe cause it was Sunday?).  It's a cash only business so no  one can \"run a tab\" but he didn't have us cash out until we'd finished all our drinks.  They have t-shirts for sale which the staff also wear--kind of a heads up to parents, the back of the t-shirts say \"fuck the other guy's bar\" (or sometihng like that).  Also, no kids are allowed in the bar area, but families were happily eating in back (in fact, while we were there a bunch of soccer (?) families numbering about 20 people arrived and ate.\nWe headed to the back room for our meal about 6:30 and we were just in time because the place was picking up and majorly. We were thre until 8 and during that time, they were run ragged. This is NOT fast food. Three people staff the dining area and the one bar guy and they do everything--take your order at the order window, clear the tables (or not--if there isn't time), wash the dishes, cook the food, bring the food to the tables, etc.  The place was crazy.  but there is an energy and acceptance to the craziness. No one seemed to put out by having one of their party get their sandwich and then a half an hour later the other get their sandwich and meanwhile french fries came when they were ready.  Again, maybe this is what the locals expected. We weren't in a hurry and just enjoyed the space, so we didn't mind that it probably took an hour including waiting in line to order and when we got our last item.  The food IS surprisingly good. They have a chalk board menu which must change at least somewhat because many things people have talked about in reviews, we didn't see. We tried a bit of eveyrthing though just to make sure we knew what we were talking about. Mac and cheese is the real deal with butterfly pasta and a flour based cheese sauce that is fairly mild but flavorful. It's baked in small ceramic dishes and served with or w/o bacon.  I'd say it's good (but not as flavorful as I would have liked).  Fries with truffle oil and parm were the only disappointment. The fries were cold, but even if we got past that, we couldn't taste either truffle oil or parm.  Sweet potato fries were great--hot and crispy served with a dill dressing (they called it ranch but it's not any kind of ranch I've had). Very flavorful though.  Pulled pork is lightly sauced but the pork itself is pretty flavorful and they use these kind of egg buns that are very tasty. I would have liked more sauce, but I'm a sauce fiend (and no way was I going to wait in the line to ask for some!).  Terriayki chicken wings were overdone but still very tasty and the chicken was moist (just the outside was a bit burned). They are slightly sweet with a tangy soy aftertaste.  Not greasy at all.  Duck confit salad with a fried duck egg was very interesting. The dressing didn't work but the egg was great--huge and the yolk bursts open and coats the salad and roasted peppers (get rid of the lemon dressing though--it's just not right).  Would like a dressing that captializes more on the duck's flavors--something maybe a bit sweet?  Or maybe add sweet cherries.  This was a great salad though.  Fried chicken sandwich was a good fried chicken sandwich on the same great bun.  I'd order everything again except fries with truffle oil.  We didn't try dessert. It was a cheesecake with oreo ice cream", "author": "Vivek V."}

The foosball in the back is free, but when I went the first time they didn't have a ball. More recently we checked out the trivia night (monday) and it was pretty cool. Some of the questions seemed a little bizarre to me - there is a lot of playing random music or throwing out obscure song lyrics - but we still had fun.

I'm going back and recommending to others.\n\nI kept hearing that it's a dive bar in a seedy, remote neighborhood.  Well, it's a dive appearing not unlike many, many other dives in the city.  I like that and sometimes prefer to hang out in such a place, and it shouldn't bother a hip resident of the bay area at all.  The neighborhood is fine, and it's within the borders of SF, so how remote can it be?  It's a small city area-wise.\n\nAnyway, what clearly separates it from other bars, dive or otherwise, is the food.  THIS IS THE BEST FOOD I HAVE EVER TASTED IN ANY BAR.  Whoever is coming up with the recipes is a true artist.  I had the crispy pork sandwich, which was excellent.  I also tasted, from others' plates, the buttermilk wings, the spicy pulled pork sandwich, and a salad which consisted of asparagus and what I believe is something like crab ceviche.  Everything was wonderful, but the crispy pork was definitely my favorite.  I'm definitely going back to try other things on the menu; they all looked very good.  Next on my list is the amalgamated beef/bacon burger.\n\nTo drink, I had the wheat beer/ hefeweizen on tap, as well as the bourbon, which is also, strangely, on tap.  Both were good.  I ordered the bourbon mainly because of the novelty of getting it from the tap, but I was surprised at the quality of it.  It tasted quite smooth considering I was sipping it straight up, and I could swear it had a distinct vanilla scent and flavor.\n\nUpdate:  I went back tonight, two days later, and had the amalgamated bacon/beef burger.  If you want to get an idea of my reaction upon tasting it, simply go to YouTube and search for \"onion moon landing.\"  Also had sweet potatertots, pitchers of wheat beer, and a pitcher of another beer with friends.

But let's start with the bar side.  Sadly, the wheat bear got tapped.  Yet, the bartender was kind enough to offer some suggestions and I really dug the replacement beer.  He even remembered me when I came up for seconds.  The vibe itself was chill and I liked how the pool table was part of the scene, but not a dominating presence.  I was on a date after all.  The back area could stand to be a little bigger, but I dug the order and we bring it out to wherever you are sitting.  My date and I split pork waffle fries and lobster mac and cheese.  $20 should have filled us up a lot more than it actually did.  The fries were incredible.  The waffle fries were crispy, but still had some softness from the pork and cheese.  Much pork was found on the fries and overall, the flavors of the cheese, potato, and pork melded beautifully together.  The lobster mac was also a triumph of flavor.  The cheese was never overpowering and the bow ties held a lot of punch.  The problem with both dishes was the scant size.  The mac was especially miniscule.  I was also confused as to what was the priority.  Was it the food or the drinks?  Despite all that, I really enjoyed my first visit to Broken Record and would journey back.  But I'd probably plan only to snack and drink here.  Not the best place for dinner.", "author": "Jeremy G."}

This is definitely my favorite one ive been to so far.\n\nso lets break this down real quick, looking at bars in general: screw the food, you dont go there to eat. screw the music, every bar has a jukebox. screw the drinks, every bar ultimately has the same shit. screw the paint and how the place is designed, other customers, all that other shit people talk about. take all that away, all you have is a bartender serving you drinks.... and countless, countless bars are all the same: you go in, you squish your way up to the bar, when the bartender finally notices you, they grunt \"lemme see your id,\" then after they look at it (without ever looking at you) they belch out \"whatre you drinking.\" then its like that all night. you finish your drink, wait and wait, then a snort of \" 'nother one?\"\nnot the Broken Record. Fuck your stupid bar.\n\nMy friend and i went on a friday night for the $2 guiness, and we both commented later how appreciative we were that we were welcomed into the bar, asked what was up and how it was going, then what we'd like to drink. As the night went on, we realised that this was really how the bartenders operate- Everybody is served with a nod and a smile, in a timely fashion but without the usual stress and drama that eminates from most bartenders.  We talked with them (thanks to the guiness i forget their names) and its not an act or front. Their just genuine people. light conversation with everybody willing (they didnt butt in or bother), plenty of tip dollars were laying around, they werent automatically snatching them up and the guests werent stealing them.\n\nSo all the other aspects aforementioned? Dark interior with a rocker vibe (the bar itself, not the guests), delicious food at great prices (i got a big basket of fries for $2, they were salted but not overly so, nor greasy), the jukebox was out of order but great musc was playing anyway; all the guests seemed like chill enough people, my friend got a game going with some people we met there; some really legit art up; hundreds of whiskeys at decent prices, and how can you beat two dollar guiness and fifty cent pbrs? oh and their house-brewed wheat beer is absolutely amazing.\n after a while, three of our friends showed up thanks to our recommendation, we all had a great time, id say a spot to go for a small group, but that places is a litle too compact for anything huge.\nThere arent a ton of seats at the bar, but theres more seating around by the storefront windows, and in the back room by the huge movie projection.\n\noh! one aspect i forgot in the comparision: the restrooms. how many times do you visit a bar that seems chill, at least its decently clean, then you go use the restroom and practically lose your apetite (even for drinking)? yeah even that is superior here. super clean restroom.\n\ni wont be there every night or even every weekend but its definitely going to be a regular stop for me from here on out.", "author": "Richard L."}

After reading and hearing about other reviews I was very excited to come eat here especially since this bar was in the neighborhood I grew up in.  The restaurant is in the back of the dive bar.  I was surprised to find that they had recently changed chefs, but the menu still looked good, whatever was left anyway.  When I got there, there were 3 items crossed off the menu (out of 12).  By the time the rest of my group arrived within the hour, they had crossed 3 more items off the menu.  \n\n- Ran out of food for half their menu items before 6:30pm (Items they ran out of: macaroni balls, jambalaya fritters, truffle mac n cheese; only one entree was left)\n- Since there were so few items left, our group ended up getting almost the entire menu (minus the salads)\n* Burger - juicy, served on a brioche bun and a good size, decently priced ($8)\n* Pulled lamb sandwich - was a little bland, but there was a good portion of lamb in the sandwich (more than 3 ounces), but it was just lamb between two pieces of foccaccia bread\n*Oxtail ragout - delicious tender oxtail with pasta that tasted homemade; huge portion ($12); Of all the items I had, I would recommend this one the most\n* Pork angel \"wing\" sandwich - essentially a huge fried piece of pork the size of a hamburger patty with a sweet crust on a brioche bun ($9) \n* French fries - steak cut and large portion served in a cute little bucket, a little on the soggy side for me ($3) - took 30 minutes to make (and there were only a couple of orders ahead of mine); whhaten I asked if they had their parmesan garlic fries, the lady at the counter told me, \"We have parmesan cheese.  I can give you that to sprinkle, but we're not making that\"- They gave me a malted vanilla milkshake for my birthday; it came in a mason jar, which was cute; and it was pretty sweet and delicious\n\nThis place is CASH ONLY and they don't take reservations.  The food is reasonably priced and tastes pretty good. I was pretty disappointed that they ran out of food before the dinner rush - what kind of place doesn't stock enough food for their menu? Despite this being a bar, I would have expected a little more.  Also, I could see the chefs eating and snacking while we were waiting for them to make our food.  That coupled with the comment regarding the fries seemed a little rude.  I wish I had been able to try the food that they're a little more known for: sweet potater tots, crawfish grits, pork waffle fries, and baby back ribs.  I heard that those previous chefs are making their dishes at a new restaurant they just opened.  It would probably be interesting just to check it out.", "author": "Laura N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-05", "description": "Several things to like about this little establishment first of they have a lot of scotch at the bar which is great for a scotch lover like me. Don't be worried beer drinkers as they have a good blend of beers on tap to satisfy most and of course a full bar. The real feature of this place is the excellent food. They are often busy and there is not much room in the dining area or back porch but the food more than makes up for it. You have to get there early to ensure you get the items you desire as they could run out in the later hours. I recommend the Crawfish grits and the Tenderloin. The grits were excellent, creamy and not clumpy with a lot of crawfish in the mix that I'm pretty sure there was some in every bite, The bowl amount is enough to satisfy without making you over-full. The Tenderloin is a breaded pork chop sandwich on a Kaiser roll with heirloom tomatoes and their own sauce cooked perfectly!!  Waiting in line will take time as the place is very popular and the chefs take the time to make quality products!!  Enjoy", "author": "Joshua S."}

I imagine the conception of the food here happening between two burnt out line cooks, who after enduring the degradation and labor of a standard fine dining cooking job hatch a plan over 3 am post shift drinks (and really bad food) to cook really awesome nouvelle bar food on their terms.  They are living the dream.  Our tasting from the menu was high on the fried, bacon and finger licking flavor end, but also achieved some great balances whether it was the hint of sesame oil in the tuna tartar, or the lemony aioli of the fried soft shell crab sandwich.  I wouldn't recommend the mac and cheese, ours was too runny and in the end highly guilty and low pleasure.  Def. eat that crab sandwich, the tuna tartar, the potato skins and duck confit; all stand outs.  And did I mention, a Bourbon that will cost you $20 elsewhere is half that here--as good a reason for peripheral travel to drink as I know of.", "author": "Kathryn M."}

It's a classic dive bar, which in itself is always a good time in our book...but we came here strictly for dinner and it did not disappoint. There's a line that's lengthy at times...we arrived at 7 pm when the line was at its longest - about 15 deep - but by the time we left around 7:45 the line was down to 2-3 people. We had the sweet potatotots and the chicken wings to start. I am a fan of neither - but immensely enjoyed both. The tots were just the right amount of sweet to give them good flavor, and the accompanying ranch sauce had a unique tang that left me wanting more. And the wings - just the right amount of sweet without being too much so. I don't like the buffalo wings because I find them too spicy usually, but these were fantastic. Needless to say, we polished off both plates quite quickly! My husband ordered the beef&bacon burger and I had the pulled pork. The pulled pork sandwich was good although it was a little bland for my taste as I usually prefer them with more barbeque sauce. I would probably not order that again, but the burger was quite delicious. The bacon was ground INTO the patty, which I had never seen before, and it tasted so bacon-y that it was quickly devoured by both of us.

I only spoke to Katherine for a brief moment to ask for her name due to the fact that she keeps her dedication to serve her customers great food. The almost exotic selection of food including venison sausage and crocodile (yep croc meat) is worth every bit that you pay for. Despite not realizing at time the it was in sausage-form I continued to taste the food and wasn't disappointed one bit. The selection is vast yet simple to understand and enjoy.

I'll try to keep this part short: \nI don't know all the people that dive in time after time, but I always end up to wanting to get to know them all. \nI felt virtually no animosity whatsoever from even the most toughest, unfriendly looking people in here.

A few people playing pool, but other than that just a few tables in the back.  To be honest I only came for the food.  We looked at the menu and ordered: buffalo wings, chicken fried steak sandwich, oyster po boy, rabbit sausage, brussels sprouts, greens, and mac & cheese.  The cashier said it could be a while because all the people seated just got there and they were a little backed up.  No big deal, we got some drinks to sip on while we were waiting for our food.  The bartender made me an El Diablo (creme de cassis, lime, soda, tequila) that was quite yummy.  \n\nIt wasn't long before the food started coming out ~15 mins.  The buffalo wings are amazing.  They're deep fried & battered first so they have a nice crunchy exterior.  A definite must.  The chicken fried steak sandwich was authentic, though some parts of the steak could have been tenderized a bit more - it was chewy; however, this is the first chicken fried steak that even comes close to what I get in Texas.  The gravy was the proper white gravy, the steak was seasoned well, and the batter was quite tasty too.  The oyster po boy was great too.  It's what I wanted when I went to Yat's but was disappointed.  Now I know where to get my po boy fix.  I didn't have the rabbit sausage (I can't eat things I have had as pets), but my companion raved.  The brussels sprouts are seasoned with soy sauce and well carmelized, good, but I liked the collard greens with their bacon goodness better.  (My companion was the opposite).

What a hell of a way to start off the weekend.\n\nThe owner, Jason, is a very down-to-earth guy.  He is easy to talk to, and definitely makes you feel welcome.  I would come to this place if I was the only one at the bar, or if I was surrounded by 100 people.  \n\nCheck this place out if you haven't already done so- you would hate yourself if you didn't give it a shot.  Plus, I don't want to ever see this place shut down due to lack of business, so for completely selfish reasons, help Jason get paid!\n\nViva la Broken Record!\n\n-edit-\n\nI came here again last Friday, and I would give this place six stars if I could...  I got into a random conversation about old school Nintendo games like Contra and Super Mario Bros. 2, I got invited to play pool, I got invited to play darts.. everyone at this bar is super friendly.  I had a little too much to drink, and Jason was a true bro making sure I was taken care of- he even went so far as to call a cab for me.\n\nI came back the next night, after recovering from the nastiest hangover I have had in a while, and played some beer pong on the new table with a couple of new friends.  Then, I played some foos in the back, talked to the bartender about how she plays roller derby, and watched some girl accidently hit the light over the pool table at least seven different times with her stick.\n\nSeriously, what more could you possibly want from a bar?  If you can't get your jollies from here, you deserve to be beaten to death by a red herring.  Nee!", "author": "Jason B."}

The two folks who create the food take a huge amount of pride in their work and it shows. This is the single place I've ever been where the sauerkraut (a garnish) is actually prepared, not simply dumped from a can. The selection of meats seems to be from a Hemingway vacation. They even take time to create a tofu sandwich which is beyond the usual gelatinous anemic blob. (Sadly this may attract the wrong sort of people to this impressive drinkery) \n\nCorndogs are truly a touchstone of Slack as well as an icon of jackassy Americana; the theirs are the best anywhere. You choose the snag, and they batter and cook it. The Hot Link corndog is delux.\n\nSo...excellent hooch selection, food that is unsurpassed and yet it's really cheap.

There was no problem grabbing an empty table after we ordered at the register.\n\nWhat we got: we had the bacon-beef hybrid burger with avocado, crab-corn fritter sandwich, duck confit potato skins, and onion rings.  Despite the fact that we were both pretty damn hungry, we couldn't finish it all.  \n\nFirst, the burger.  I'm not one to use hyperbole when describing food, but this was the best burger I've ever had.  It solves an age-old conundrum: bacon is delicious, hamburgers are delicious, but the bacon that usually ends up on a hamburger is pretty foul.  Solution: meld quality beef and pork fat together into one patty.  My friend insisted on the avocado, which was a smart addition.\n\nThe onion rings were also fantastic.  The coating is super thick and stays crispy, the onions inside are firm and not slimy.\n\nThe crab-corn fritter sandwich was also tasty, but my friend and I agreed that the duck confit potato skins were also just OK.  I felt that they needed a bit more texture.  Apparently, they were a new menu item that the chef was experimenting with, so I'd be willing to try them again sometime in the future.\n\nI should also note that the chef came out to talk to use towards the end of our meal to ask us how things were.  He appreciated both our positive endorsements and our suggestions about what might make us enjoy the duck confit potato skins more.\n\nAs for value, with 2 beers from the bar up front (which you've got to go grab separately - no big deal), the total was $37 before tip.  I definitely got my money's worth, no question.    \n\nWithout a doubt, I'll be back, probably with a pack of ravenous friends.", "author": "Alex H."}

Let me proceed to rave about Total Burger Genius - bacon is incorporated into the burger itself, and it's incredibly tender and filled with flavor. A nice bonus is that cheese is included in the price - since really, how many of us order burgers without cheese? Absolutely my new favorite burger.\n\nMy friends and I also ordered a bunch of things on the menu to share, and the handmade onion rings (I love a good breadcrumb coating!) and the corn with chorizo butter were delicious. Worth a return trip for sure!", "author": "candycakes c."}

I don't drink; I don't get too excited about pool or darts; it's just not my scene.  My friend brought me to BR today because she sold it to me as a restaurant.  I had no idea it was *also* a bar till I got there.  \n\nHaving said that, I am not reviewing it as a bar (although even I could tell it was a perfectly chill place to hang out and have some beers); I am reviewing the restaurant!!\n\nThis kitchen is no joke, people, and this is NOT dive bar fare.  Don't stop at the bar; go on to the back room for the restaurant!  This place serves up a damn good meal.  \n\nApparently the menu changes, but we had the pleasure of stuffing ourselves with:\n\n1. the pulled pork sandwich.  It was perfect.  NOT overly saucy and goopy, and the sauce was just-right sweet-hot, and the roll was soft and delicious.\n\n2. the mac n cheese.  We got the one with bacon topping.  Holy cow, if you've never had home made mac n cheese, you need to come here and let this place set the standard for you.  It was so creamy and bacony and just amazing.\n\n3. the fried sweet peppers with chili olive oil and salt.  Such a nice dish to cut all the richness of the other things we had.  These were beautiful long, bright green peppers.\n\n4. the meatballs.  These were so flavorful and the sauce they came in was really amazing.  I wish I'd been able to eat another bite, because I would have loved to soak it up with an extra slice of bread.\n\nI can't wait to go back and try more things (like the tiger prawn sandwich and the heirloom tomato toast!) and see what else they mix into the menu.  \n\nI also want to add that the people working there are super friendly, and their pride in the food they are putting in front of you really comes through. \n\nI live all the way over in the Richmond district, but I see myself making regular trips back to BR.  Thank you to the kitchen!!", "author": "Julie L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-08-12", "description": "This place is a hike but the food in back is well worth it (and the price makes up for some of the travel time).\n\nFirst off, go on a Sunday, or early on a Monday, when they have their signature burger on special.  They grind bacon into the burger, put it on an awesome grilled brioche-like bun and add a nice creamy slice of avocado for an additional dollar.  This is one of the best burgers I've ever had.\n\nIn general the mantra here seems to be to add some sort of pork fat to a dish whenever possible.  Thus the saugusage (a decent sandwich, but not like the burger) includes bacon fat, the corn on the cob includes an amazing chorizo butter, and the mac and cheese includes crumbs from a bacon cornbread.  That corn is a must order as are the onion rings and nice long salty oily sweet peppers.  The mac and cheese is good but it would be better with a smaller noodle like the traditional elbows instead of the farfalle they use at the Broken Record.\n\nFor apps, the tomato toast and the wings were amazing.  The wings are a little confusing--if you expect true buffalo wings, you'll be surprised.  Instead think small fried chicken, battered and seasoned, and delicious.  It's served with a wing sauce that is more tangy than hot (not hot enough in my opinion), but the blue-cheese/ranch sauce that accompanies it is spectacular.  As for the tomato toast, the tomatoes were impressively fresh and flavorful (maybe heirlooms?) and the toast was a nice balance of chewy, buttery, and grilled.    I've also had a biscuit.  The biscuits there were good but not great, but the honey butter on the side was absolutely delicious.\n\nIt's fatty and greasy in all the right ways and the ingredients are mostly top notch.  Paired with a nice hoppy beer (arrogant bastard, a boont black IPA, and a surprisingly hoppy Firestone Pale Ale were all on tap when I went) from the bar up front, a meal here is worth the schlep and won't cost all that much.", "author": "Corey B."}

I went with a group of about 8, which I totally recommend going in a group that way to can try as many things as possible on the menu. I got the lobster mac and cheese and the salmon toast, both were so good! The mac and cheese was right out of the over and so hot that the cheese is still bubbling which is awesome cause I hate when you go to a restaurant and by the time they bring out the food its lukewarm. The place is cash only but not to worry since they have an ATM onsite. The food takes about 10 minutes to come out since there are only a few peops working the kitchen but totally worth the wait. The guys that work in the kitchen are super nice and totally attentive (bringing out extra utensils so we can share dessert, and extra napkins, etc...)

THE FOOD WAS AMAZING! I just ate there tonight (wanted to grab a quick bite to stave off the blood sugar drop, was in the neighborhood, and had NO IDEA how great the food would be. HEAVENLY.). I had the crab cake sandwich, with exquisite, red, soft, sweet heirloom tomato slices, perfect avocado, and a spicy mayo - it usually comes with scallion aioli, but i'm not ready to go there, with an aversion to raw onions. The rest of the menu is heart-attack city-but what a way to go. Can't wait to try the pulled pork sandwich, the mac-and-cheese, and oh, it's late, and I just can't remember the whole list. Oh yeah, there's something that comes with BACON cornbread. OMFG! This is just the coolest place. You eat in the back, the walls are red and black and painted on one wall with an interesting design. There are beautiful, interesting, well done B&amp;W photos - large and small - on the walls. The seating is, shall we say, eclectic - clearly recovered from old restaurants and movie theatres. Not the most comfortable, but when your mouth is having such a fun time, who cares? Drinks from the bar (NO BREWED ICED TEA! Something else I'll have to bring up with our Jamie-person. What is he THINKING!). But I do also remember there is grilled corn, and just a bunch of other options that all sound great. and the PRICES are so reasonable, I will have to make this place a destination. Here is my sad tale of woe: I JUST MOVED TO THE EAST BAY, and USED TO LIVE JUST BLOCKS FROM THIS PLACE! Well, now that I've moved, I'll have an excellent reason to come back. But you all have to help! The business needs your support - so come here and have a short culinary education in fresh excellence, listen to the loud, eclectic music, drink a gallon of beer, and tell ALL YOUR FRIENDS. It's so obvious this place is a labor of love. Did I mention the pool table? The nice bar? The friendly barkeep with the excellent tattoos? The really friendly, for-real (and also very cute) waitperson? I do think this is one of the best restuarants I've eaten at in San Francisco. I am a food snob. I have been so bored. And now I am EXCITED. And the ONLY good news is now, I get to go to a restaurant near where I live in San Leandro that gets such raves that I am gonna go in there VERY SKEPTICAL INDEED, and if it comes even CLOSE to how good the Broken Record is (in its current state, before I get my hands all over that menu) then I will come back and give the Broken Record its due. Really, everyone, come on by and give these people some biz. It is worth the trip to the Excelsior - really easy to get here - 19th, go east on Geneva, and try to find a parking place at Naples and Geneva. (I only circled the block once.) The atmosphere is totally nice, the natives are friendly, and the FOOD IS DIVINE. Go get some! NOW!!!!! (Update-was so busy & tired from my move, it took me all this time to get back to Yelp & realize that I hadn't posted this review. Haven't had time/cash to go back, but hope to, plan to.

I used to go a lot when I lived out in ButtfuckingEgypt, aka DAly City, but havent found myself there since only because of its random location. However, the owner is rad and I almost have never had to wait for a pool table. Good prices, movie wenesday's (if things haven't changed) and a smoking porch in the back.", "author": "Jessica U."}

I heard a rumor of $0.50 PBR's and $2.00 PBR pitchers??  There's a pool table as well as a flip cup/beirut table.  Also I heard there's guitar hero and trivia nights??  I live north of market and it was well worth the trip down.", "author": "Will H."}

A STELLAR, huge scotch selection (fantastic bourbon selection as well if you bat for the bourbon team), without all the inflated prices and snobbery, and a bartender who knows what he's talking about and has a sense of humor.  Great back kitchen, a down homey menu with game sausages and mac and cheese and even a tofu sammie for the veg kids.  SO much better than typical bar garbage.  I want to go here every day - it's what home should feel like, sigh.  Broken Record, will you adopt me?", "author": "Gwen S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-27", "description": "This place is pretty awesome, and they have pretty good beers on tap. Or you can sometimes get one of the gigantic Tecate cans for something like two bucks. Oh, and if you're a whiskey fan this is your place. It's got a super laid back feel to it and the people are usually pretty cool. The only down side I would say is that every time I go here I have to wait at least 45 minutes to get my food. Which for how amazing the pulled pork is, it's almost worth it. But if you're starving and there is any kind of big crowd don't plan on eating any time soon. All in all it's totally worth it. I will totally be back again.", "author": "carly h."}

I have lived in this fair city for close to a decade and consider this one of the best bar menus and execution in SF.  The wings are huge and are to die for, sauces (blue and hot) are on the side so that your wings maintain their crispiness.  The bacon fries are also bomb, skinny, crispy and only $3 although next time I will ask to add cheese as the bacon needs some glue to stick to the fries.  All the ingredients are fresh and of the highest quality.  The meatball sandwich is super good, oozing with motz, fresh basil and home-made marinara.  Duck confit potato skins are only $6 complete with chunks of duck and truffle oil -very cheap considering the pricey ingredients. The food quality has been consistently good (you will not have a disappointing night).  This kitchen takes their bar fare seriously and it shows. My boyfriend loves the wide variety of whiskeys and being able to chat up the bartenders, who are friendly and knowledgeable.  Who cares if this place is out of the way, take a break from the mission hipsters and try it out.", "author": "liz w."}

I started with the onion rings and heirloom tomato salad, which were both great.  The onions had some super thick and crunchy rings, and the bits of bacon were a yummy touch on the salad.  As it was Sunday night, I went with the special and got the burger (with avocado).  Good choice, it was awesome.  They get some bacon flavor in the beef without putting bacon on the burger, and the patty was big and juicy with a generous portion of avocado.  Really good burger.  My girlfriend and her friend both got the crispy shrimp sandwich, which was also very tasty and a good option if you're looking for something a little lighter than a burger.  In addition, they had a really good black IPA on tap in the bar, which went perfect with my burger, the bartender was really nice (note the cool and clever keyhole tattoo), and the soundtrack was solid.  Finished off with some warm cookies and milk, and that was that.  A delicious and filling me at a very reasonable price.  Looking forward to going back to try the non-Sunday menu.", "author": "Jeff K."}

(i am such a voyeur of public transit drama.)  then standing at that bus stop across the street on geneva with a hoard of people, there must have been some delay in the buses.  the fog rolling above us was beautiful, i hadn't seen that in quite a while.  this part of the city feels grittier but i suppose it's just more modest and middle-class, the crowd was mostly asian and older.  when the bus finally came, i realized i didn't know exactly where i was supposed to get off, so i asked the bus driver if he knew the cross street for the address.  an older filipino lady who overheard was really worried that i'd have to go back and wait for another bus in the dark, so she kept asking me whether the street numbers were going up in the direction that i needed to go.  i think she even told the bus driver to take care of me when she get off...  i must have looked like some clueless girl.  the bus driver was a really sweet gentleman though who told me to stay by him, he kept checking the street numbers too and telling me how many more blocks until my stop.\n\nhaha, if not for the soul food or air hockey, go for the public transit adventures, because you've never seen the excelsior, because people everywhere are kind and interesting, because you never get out of your hood, because you like fog, because hunting down a \"scene\" in the middle of \"nowhere\" is the perfect thing for a friday night.", "author": "wendy p."}
