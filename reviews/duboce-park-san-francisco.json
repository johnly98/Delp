Not that I needed a dog to come here, but I knew it would enhance the experience. I've walked through Duboce Park by myself a few times and saw it every time I rode the N Muni train.\n\nI love that there are separate grassy areas for on and off leash dogs. I wish the dog area was completely fenced in. Our puppy isn't currently allowed to play with other dogs but enjoyed from a distance (in agony) as we practiced tricks instead.\n\nThe lawn is super green and well-kept. There's a kiddie playground.

Go!\" by Dr. Seuss, then surely you must realize canines like to play in packs. Big dog. Little dog. Red dog. Blue dog. Then there was the palpable sexual tension between the French poodle and the dalmatian: \"Do you like my hat?\", \"No, I do not.\" / \"Goodbye\", \"Goodbye\". Shakespearean-inspired dialogue that resonated like emotional haiku (video: http://bit.ly/2oyVA8C). I think for non-dog owners like Jamie W. and me, Duboce Park represents that Seussian world of cavorting dogs who run back and forth over the green expanse (photo: http://bit.ly/2pBOBvH). My recent favorite was a dachshund named Dash who needed training wheels to help support his misshapen back legs as he scampered around (photo: http://bit.ly/2pkBNXw).\n\nFrankly they were all entertaining even when their bored-looking hipster owners would be indifferently using their dog ball throwing stick in one hand while texting in the other. Lassie would have never put up with such entitlement. Regardless, it was nice to sit on the bench watching all the activity as the N-Judah train rolls by in both directions near sunset. Humans, at least the ones savvy enough to know not to sit among the fecal matter (canine or otherwise), are relegated to the west of the park where there is a grassy mound for urban picnicking (photo: http://bit.ly/2pokCq3). It's really a nice little park that could use a few more trees in the middle. But more importantly, do you like my hat? Say what? Goodbye!", "author": "Ed U."}

As for it being a dog park, I am not so sure because it's not completely fenced in at all. This means that there is no way I can let my dog off-leash because he will end up running into the street, never to be seen again. \n\nOTHER: There is a water fountain with two varying heights for humans, and one low fountain for dogs although it does not shoot up the water. I also think during hot days the water is warm/hot because my dog refused to drink it. \n\nDOGFEST: McKinley Elementary school holds a fundraiser event called \"Dogfest\" every year that I've been to for three straight years. They have various vendors with informational booths. Some of them give out little trinkets and marketing materials. They hold a dog contest, but each category you enter is $10 plus a $20 registration fee. Each year they have a Dogfest T-shirt you can purchase with a different design each year. Mostly this event is best suited for children with carnival games setup. Food is your basic hot dog cotton candy carnival type food. One bad part is that there isn't much shade and for whatever reason every year it has been in the 70's and sunny so it can get almost too hot to where you start sweating out here. Too bad they can't have one of those huge big overarching tents. I feel like every year I come there are less and less vendors. \n\nOVERALL: It's an A-OK park in my book so three stars it is. It is San Francisco so parking is a challenge. You end up having to circle around and around to find a spot that isn't blocking someone's driveway.", "author": "Michelle M."}

The park is blocked off from the train tracks with a cement fence and there are water foundations at perfect doggie height.\n\nTook my shy/cautious puppy to Duboce on the way home from work (the N-Judah line stops right in front!) and he absolutely had a blast. We took a seat at one of the many benches and just let him drag his leash around as he started exploring. Other dogs would come by and they would do their bro-sniff thing and run off to play. I've literally NEVER seen my puppy run that far away from me before.

There's water for the people and for the dogs. It's not fenced but thankfully my dog is well trained, listens to me well, and is more interested in playing with the dogs already in the park than she is chasing after the N-Judah. I like that most of the owners here are responsible for their dogs and a lot of them are very friendly and nice people.\n\nI guess I relaxed a bit too much. Not everyone's dog is so nice nor is every owner so responsible. \n\nMy experience here (and my dog's), however, was tainted when she went up to an unmuzzled, off-leash dog (some sort of Husky breed). My pint sized 30lb pittie mix gal is super friendly to dogs and people and will turn around and walk away and come bounding back to me if other dogs growl, snap, flop over on their side for a break, or otherwise show any indication they don't want to play or want her around. There are pitbulls that escalate but she's not one of them and she runs back to hide in my legs the second any dog in the vicinity gets a little too rough, loud, or scary with her or any other dog.\n\nIt was getting darker and around 9pm today when she went up to this slender Husky-type breed dog and before she even had a chance to turn around the dog lunged for her, I heard a shrill loud scream. At first I thought it was human and coming from the woman but then I realized it had to have been one of the dogs. I'd never head that noise from my dog before so I assumed the Husky was just poorly socialized and making that sound for attention. My dog can bounding back to me tail between her legs looking dazed and confused. Since I'd been standing farther away and it was dusk I hadn't seen what had happened. The owner (a woman with just over chin length dark hair) who had been right next to the dogs said nothing and it was not until I got on MUNI and had some bright lights did I notice my dog was bleeding and had puncture marks going all around her entire muzzle.When I went to clean the multiple wounds on her face she screamed the same scream I'd head at the dog park that I'd assumed at the time came from the Husky. I was really upset that she very likely saw the her dog bite mine but didn't even have the courtesy to mention it.\n\nSo beware dog owners with aggressive dogs with irresponsible owners who still let them off leash anyway! Thankfully it was late enough in the day that no children were around and my dog is a service dog in training who is specifically trained not to attack even if threatened, so my little girl was the only dog hurt and it wasn't bad enough to require stitches, just cleaning and antibiotics.\n\nAlso, people gotta get better about cleaning up after their dogs.

And most people actually come here to play with their dogs and / or watch them. \n\nOne of the reasons you should watch your dog (and why the grass is always pretty green) is that the parks department fertilizes the grass with fish emulsion of some kind which makes it tasty for most dogs - that's why you'll see lots of them eating the mud. \n\nAnother impact of that is that you could trip if you're not careful. \n\nAnd given that there's no fence on the one side of the park that faces the Muni rails, really does mean you're going to have to watch after your dogs -- which is a good thing after all.\n\nThere's a set of nice drinking fountains for dogs, kids and adults.

Indeed, Duboce is both a gateway to, and the heart of, or rather the fulcrum of, the surrounding Lower Haight, DTN, and Buena Vista Heights neighborhoods.  \n\nYes, there are a lot of dogs.  In fact, almost at any given time, you'll spot (pun intended) a half a dozen dogs running around as if they're in doggie heaven.  Additionally, there are even dog planned events that use DP specifically because of this reputation...so in some ways, on the superficial level, it earns its notoriety.\n\nSo on the dog tip: there are some chains that cordon off the dog area but they are really only suggestions as ANY dog can slip through.  Moreover, the chains only block off 3 sides...if your dog runs away a lot..this isn't the place for you.  There are dog height water bowls and numerous plastic bag dispensers.  There will numerous other dogs there too so the dog will have ample social time.  Lastly, a good assortment of places to sit a watch your dog mingle and play.  Overall dog park quality is very high.\n\nAs a neighborhood center:  Many neighborhoods should look to DP as an inspiration on how to draw a community together.  On many weekends of the year Duboce is the sight of tag sales or little fairs as well as the aforementioned dog events.  It also has the N stop, as well as 1 block from a J stop, so it is readily accessible via public transit.  Lastly, there are community billboards that are updated frequently...\n\nAs something other than a dog park: On a sunny day...there are actually a fair amount more humans than dogs.  In fact, these numbers have grown since the renovation and the separation of areas.  If one has a chance, or if one has a little monster (a child), one should visit the very very good playground...it is always busy with crazy little kids and exhausted adults.  There are basketball courts...and the Harvey Milk community recreation center...it is so much more than a dog park.\n\nMy last comment...I usually take the N home...and when it starts up the little hill at Sanchez/Duboce the passengers on the car inevitably watch all the dog mirth in the park and smile.  There..they get to view the unadulterated joy dogs, and animals in general, bring to us...I always feel so lucky that this is my stop.  No matter how hard my day was..at 6pm...I can watch the dogs for 5 min and have it all melt away and walk the rest of the way home with a smile on my face.\n\nNow that is a great park.", "author": "Chris D."}

It's very community oriented and the other dog owners are really cool....most of them.  There are a few crazy dog owners, but not too many.  \n\nI won't state names, but there's a really funny dog owner who gives orders to his dog using complete sentences and paragraphs; as if the dog would know what the hell he's talking about.  He would say something like \"Ralph, stop eating the mud, you're going to get sick and I'm going to have to clean up your puke and put you on a bland diet...you don't want to go on a bland diet do you.....I didn't think so....you're just doing it to test me  aren't you...yeah, keep it up and we won't go to the pet store later today when I get home from work.\" and it goes on and on and on, I'm not kidding.  A simple \"no\" or \"stop\" order or doggy demand would be suffice, but in his case, turns into a long speech.  We all know the dog isn't listening after the first two or three words.  In the meantime, you know he's waking up the neighborhood.  He's fairly loud.  I could hear him down the street, but it's all good.  He's a really cool guy and really good with dogs.  Anyway, I would rather hear someone yelling something like that, than to hear people yelling ghetto slang and all the other crap you hear from people at times. It's also the only park you could hear \"stop eating the mud\" being echoed throughout the park by at least six to ten dog owners at any given time.  \n\nIt's really funny how a lot of us dog owners have been going to this park for years and talking to each other all this time, but refer to each other as so and so's dad, Ralph's dad, or Mandy's mom, etc.  It took me forever to learn a dog owners name, even though we would see and talk to each other everyday.", "author": "Ryan M."}

Now I get out of my home WAY more often to attend various parks, beaches, and lakes with my puppy and her dog mate Rosie. Lately, I have been taking evening walks with the dogs (Rosie and Bella) to Duboce Park also known as Dog Poop Park. Duboce Park is located on Steiner at Duboce. If you ride the N-Judah you pass the park before you head into the next tunnel. Personally, I get offended when someone says, \"You go to dog Shit Park?\" I believe that the park has cleaned up over the years. Also, the bad rap needs to go!\n\nWhen I moved here (four years ago) it was so fertile and green but eventually the dogs destroyed the grass and the beauty of the park seemed to fade away. The city has finally taken on the task of cleaning up the park. Can you believe it? We DO have city workers!! WOO HOO! They have roped off certain areas and patched the grass section by section. They have also installed many trash receptacles and a post that holds doggie bags. This is magnificent for someone who own's a dog. This has also helped people FEEL the necessity to clean up their pet's deeds. In conclusion it has also helped keep the park manageable for humans and dogs. Hopefully, this will restore the park so that men, women, children, and dogs enjoy their days of summer.\n\nAs far as cool people hanging out at the parkyou never know whom you are going to meet. When I moved here I met a cool dude at the park and he was my first date in San Francisco. I took this dog Blue I was watching to the park and his dog kept humping Blue so eventually we started talking and after hanging out all day we ended up going out on a date that night. It was really cool. It was nice to know that you can meet HOTTIES anywhere in this city. I also made my first girlfriends in the city at the park. To me that was important because I did not have any friends and I knew I could go to the park everyday after work and chat with someone I knew. It was so lonely for me when I first moved here that if I did not have to take Blue to the park I probably would have packed up and moved back to Ohio (maybe). Recently, my eye has caught some NEW hotties in the park, some have had girlfriends but that is always subject to change. The thing about Duboce Park that I love is I might see a HOTTIE one day and not get the chance to speak or interact with him but I know that he will always return to the park for his dog.", "author": "Tamara M."}

Instead when I walk past that area I see men pissing up against the trees and young kids spilling and leaving bottles of booze everywhere....  Yes I can see why people would prefer to lay on that grass for a picnic now that the dogs have been banished.  The other two sections are for dogs on leashes only, and dogs that don't need to be on a leash.  And just in case you haven't got that, there are signs everywhere stating this, and spray painted words on the ground so that your dog gets it too.  Congratulations on spending a huge sum of money making this once beautiful park into something out of the movie \"1984\".  One last thing....  The people who bring their dogs here for the most part are very nice, friendly and animal loving.  However, there are a select few who really should join the real world of owning a dog.  To those people, you know who you are, stop being protective of your dogs toys.  If you are in a dog park with your dog, and you are surrounded by other dogs (obviously you will be because it is a dog park after all), and a playful, friendly dog should come up and take your dogs toy (which by the way you do GET back along with an apology soon after it was taken) to start a chase with your pet; DEAL with it.  All dogs do this at least once in their lifetime.  They are not stealing your wallet or gold Rolex from you; they are merely trying to play with your dog.  If you can't bare to see your dog play with another, then don't go out with them.  Infact, don't even own a dog because you obviously don't understand them.  And next time you tell another dog owner to \"teach their dog out of that bad habit\" remember there are dogs out there and even owners, who are aggressive and violent, and if you should never come across one of them in the course of owning a dog, then count yourself lucky.  There are worse things out there than a puppy who wants to play.", "author": "Billy B."}
