Around 2PM on a Saturday afternoon, the restaurant was pretty empty. There's not that many high top tables but we were able to snag two to combine together for our group of five.  \n\nThe menu is comprehensive with tacos, rice bowls, burritos, etc. In addition to the normal stuff (carne asada, pollo, etc.), they also have a TON of veggie options for your vegetarian friends and some specials (shrimp). \n\nI wasn't super adventurous, so I went with the chicken burrito with whole black beans, spanish rice, and the spinach tortilla wrap. Everyone's orders came with a small bowl of tortilla chips and a BOMBBBBB sauce/salsa(?). The sauce was sooooo good I couldn't help but finish my entire bowl of chips. Then I continued to pour the sauce over my burrito until it was all gone. The burrito itself was also very well done. In particular, I like that they toast the tortilla so that it has a nice crispy exterior and soft interior. They also do not skimp on any of the filling. The chicken in particular was super tender and super juicy. I wouldn't have minded just a plate of the chicken and rice on their own!\n\nBus your own trays after you finish your meal! There is a box of foil on the counter for your to pack up your monstrous burrito if you don't happen to finish it! \n\nPro tip: the sauce/salsa is supposedly available for purchase at Whole Foods for all of you fans!!", "author": "Sherry L."}

They offer several great options for vegans with completely vegan beans - whole black beans, whole pinto and black refried! That's outstanding! Their rice is vegan too which is nice (if you're vegan, don't assume your rice is vegan). They also have two other great vegan protein options - marinated tofu and vegan soyrize (both are nice savory). The fact that they actually use the word \"vegan\" on the menu means that they take this type of dietary lifestyle seriously. I can't thank them enough for doing this.\n\nTheir food is very good. Each time I've been here either by myself or with a group of friends, the experience has been excellent. They really know how to make great Mexican food.

We ordered the soyrizo tacos, and a burrito with tofu as the meat. \nThe soyrizo tacos were a major hit, there was so much flavor in them & I would definitely recommend them. The tofu burrito was not my favorite. I added refried beans, Spanish rice, with a whole wheat tortilla. (Almost all the burrito options are vegan) Everything in the burrito tasted fine except the tofu. I've had my fair share of tofu tacos and burritos and this was not the best. The tofu isn't cut small enough so it ends up being quite chewy with no flavor inside. The refried beans, however, were great & I still ate a good amount of the burrito. Next time I would switch the tofu for soyrizo and call it a day.\n\nAlso their \"famous\" salsa was really nothing special. The flavor and spice really weren't there at all.

Good to know the food quality here never changes.\n\nI used to live down the street from here and ate here all the time. My go to was the fish burrito, super with cheese guac sour cream, and rice and beans on the side. You absolutely have to get the rice and beans on the side because the white fish cooked in white wine and butter is so delicate that the competing textures and flavor just take too much away from the fish itself. Trust me on this. You can change up the tortilla by getting a whole wheat, spinach or tomato tortilla but don't screw around by adding rice and beans.\n\nTheir house salsa is still the best salsa I have ever had and I grew up in SoCal which is the Mecca of Mexican food. I can honestly drink this salsa by the bucketful. It's a great compliment to their thin, crispy, and warm tortilla chips which come free with your food order whether you dine in or order for take out. Extra container of salsa will cost you $0.50 but it goes great in that fish burrito. \n\nI was passing through the neighborhood today so had to stop by for my usual burrito and chips. I sat for a bit to enjoy my chips and salsa, then asked to get my burrito to go. \n\nService is always quick and friendly whether you dine in or order to go.

It was one of the best egg and chorizo burritos I think I've ever had, and that's quite a lot. \n\nThe burrito is slightly overpriced in my opinion. While it is large and very good, paying over $10 for a burrito is excessive in my mind. But it's not going to stop me from going back. \n\nOn top of the burrito itself, the salsa was delicious.

Jarred it loses something but if you get in in-person, wow, it is one of the top salsas I've ever had. Although they are pretty stingy with it...\n\nBurrito-wise (you come here for burritos, FYI), there are really only three choices to consider. If you like steak, get carne asada. If you are on a diet, get pollo asado. If you are on whatever the opposite of a diet is, get a \"triple threat\", which I think is beef, chicken, and shrimp.\n\nI don't know how anything else tastes at Papalote, because all I've ever ordered is burritos. Make sure you get refried black beans! I cannot stand whole beans in burritos, it's so gross, and of course Spanish rice, not brown rice.\n\nThe quality at Papalote is high, but there are a few downsides. Of course, they are super stingy with their salsa. Charging $0.50 for extra salsa is ridiculous, salsas should be free and unlimited. It's not like it's got truffles in it, it's like 90% tomatoes!\n\nAnother downside is the wait, they take ages to make a burrito, even when you're the only one there. I don't know why, since a lot of the ingredients are sitting around, but that's what it is. Finally, with tax you are looking at about $14 for a super burrito. That is... too much. Even for SF.

The food arrived around 2pm.\n\nPrices below are what we paid using DoorDash. Comparing these to Papalote's online menu, some dishes were priced more and some less. We payed more for: the Burrito and Chile verde (+$0.55 each), making the burrito Super (+$0.51), and the Carne asada (+$0.20). The dishes priced less were: Chorizo con queso (-$0.25) and Chorizo con huevo (-$0.45). So depending on what you order, you may pay less for some items.\n\n*Pollo asada burrito ($10.50): grilled chicken, Flour tortilla, Black refried, Make it super (+$2.50), No sour cream\n*Chile verde ($17.50): tender chunks of pork cooked slowly in a tangy tomatillo and serrano pepper sauce\n*Chorizo con queso ($9.50): melted jack cheese and chorizo\n*Chorizo/soyrizo con huevo ($12.50): scrambled eggs with your choice, Chorizo, Rice and Beans on side\n*Carne asada ($8.95): grilled steak, Tacos (2)\n\nMy favorite was the con queso. Super cheesy and delicious. I also got the chorizo egg burrito. Unfortunately, they gave me the soyrizo one. Disappointing as I really wanted the chorizo. Soyrizo is just not the same! Not sure who's fault this was, but we complained to DoorDash and got a $5.99 credit. Considering we didn't want the soyrizo, I think this should have been a full refund, but I guess that's not Paplote's fault. The carne asada tacos were okay. I wish I could have ordered just one as I didn't really want two tacos. The roommate got the chile verde and pollo asada burrito. He said they were alright. He's more of a carnitas guy.\n\nThe salsa IS as good as everyone says it is! I just wish they gave us more given the amount of food we ordered. They only gave us two containers. If I could have covered the soyrizo in that salsa, it might have been better.\n\nI find it weird they don't have carnitas, but Paplote is a good option if you want the standard Mexican fare such as carne asada, pollo asada, etc. I, however, like meats such as cabeza, lengua and tripitas.

I have tried a few things here but there are basically 2 that I consistently order and recommend-\n\nChicken mole: I usually get this in a burrito but the \"naked burrito\"/burrito bowl is good as well. The mole sauce is not the best but it is pretty good and while I haven't had a lot of mole in SF, this has been the best I've tried in San Francisco. The burrito normally comes with rice and beans but I just get it with guacamole, cheese, and sour cream. The quality varies but it is generally a pretty solid option and a good thing to order if hungry. I strongly recommend getting the burrito with the papalote hot sauce (it's not that spicy) and not pico de gallo.\n\nNachos: The nachos are simple yet good. I also get them with Papalote hot sauce instead of pico and usually with refried beans and sometimes carnitas. They use shredded cheese and not nacho sauce and quite a lot of it. These are a great option if you've been drinking; when I have had them at other times, they are kind of overwhelming. \n\nThey do have a dining room but I usually either order on the phone and pick it up to go or order through Postmates (the fact that you can get delivery is a little too convenient). The food at this location is definitely not as great as the location in the Mission but it's still a pretty good (though probably slightly overpriced) Mexican option.", "author": "Seema U."}

Everything was fresh, the meat seemed to be fairly high quality, but those times have changed.  The last few times I have picked up dinner from Papalote I grabbed burritos to go only to be extremely disappointed when I would get home and take a few bites. The burrito I ordered last Friday night was inedible due to the chicken being extremely tough/chewy and the overall burrito being ridiculously salty (maybe the beans).  My boyfriends burrito was also inedible for the same reasons though we both had different beans.  We literally threw away more than half of the burritos, and this was after putting them on a plate to salvage some of the meat, rice and beans. Each piece of chicken was absolutely disgusting/inedible and the beans, rice and pico were too salty to be enjoyed by scooping up with what seemed like store bought bulk tortilla chips.  Ive had fresher burritos from the drive-thru of fast food joints.\n\nThe above is not a fluke.  The exact same situation has happened the last 3 times I have been there, which of course, decreases the frequency of me grabbing dinner from Papalote.  2 chicken burritos (one with guac, one with cheese) comes out to a little over 25 dollars and you can guarantee I will not be wasting my money on RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE, literally inedible, burritos.", "author": "Jen S."}

The burrito fell apart into a complete mess after the first few bites and wasn't that good. The worst part is the attitude of the person running the place (operates the register) he had a bad vibe about him as soon as I started ordering. I asked for a refill of hot sauce and he said we charge .50 with a snarky attitude. I told him I didn't have any cash and only had a card, he wouldn't budge on offering a small cup (less than 1oz) and gave me a dirty look when I asked if I could pay by card. Luckily a nice employee walked over to me and put a hot sauce on my table and said don't worry about it. I won't be coming back based on this experience and would suggest others spend there money elsewhere.

Getting a free burrito may have skewed my review, but I like them. My bosses love the breakfast burritos and I haven't tried those. The last burrito I had was the chile verde and they were nice medium to large size pieces of pork which were tender and flavorful. The burrito had a good ratio of rice and beans. They are slightly different from other mexican restaurants I have been to and so far those differences have been great. The flavor profile is there. The other thing that makes this place a 5, instead of a 4, is the salsa they give with the chips is absolutely delicious. It makes you think twice about salsa. It's creamy, spicy, and has different depths of flavor and spice. I love their salsa. I even try to save some to add to my other foods. They need to package that salsa and sell them in stores and tell me when they do it. Maybe they already do...I need to look into it, actually. haha\n\nOverall, I love to order delivery from Papalote. My work place loves them. Everything I've tasted so far has been spot on and delicious.

The carne asada and other toppings, lettuce and sour cream were just average. Nothing really to write home about.\n\nThe seating was kind of awkward.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-09-17", "description": "Yes, I paid $20 for a burrito.  Before you do too, I suggest you read this first.\n\nSo when was the last time you ran 13.1 miles?  When you did, might you have noticed how F%#@ING HUNGRY you were after?  A friend of mine and I ran the Giant Race earlier in the day and, as expected, we were looking to fill the emptiness in our tummies with something substantial - hey, 13.1 miles, we earned it!  Because she (my friend) had seen Papalote featured on the Food Network, she had mentioned earlier in the week that she would like to go there for our post-race meal.  Funny how the spoiled always seem to get what they want, huh?\n\nSo I guess for no other reason than because it was on TV, we decide to go for the Triple Threat Burrito to see what all the hype was about.  And, as a half marathon will help you do, we throw in a couple of tacos to help wash it down.  \n\nThe burrito:  Well, with regard to size, you're pretty much just getting a standard super burrito (depending on where you are).  There's nothing \"food challenge\" about it - in case that's what you may have been wondering, and let's be honest, for $20, some of you SHOULD be curious!  From a flavor perspective, not much stood out from this.  As the bits of rice and beans that were stuffed in her cheeks fly at me, my friend says \"something's missing\".  I agreed, something WAS missing.  If there was anything (for me) that stood out from the Triple Threat, it was the flavor of the carne asada that was in there.  It was tender, juicy, and flavorful, but that continued to be masked and diluted by everything else that was in there.  Maybe just a carne asada burrito would have been better?... Perhaps.\n\nThe tacos:  Not really much of a difference with regards to our feelings here.  They were good.  Not great, just good.  Though I don't typically find myself employing a knife and fork while eating tacos, the tortillas fell apart here and necessitated their use - a point that would have been lost had the food been over the top amazing, but that wasn't the case.\n\nThe word that continued to jump to the forefront of my thoughts was \"gimmick\".  Don't get me wrong, I get it.  I see what they're doing here and I understand the hipster S.F. clientele that they're serving, and from what I can see, its working... WELL!!!  And I applaud those that have the courage to become a part of the evolution of traditional cuisine, but I guess my palate is a little too old school to wrap my brain around what they're doing here.  \n\nWhat really summed up my (our) experience here was the fact that our conversation was ultimately moved toward the menus of other establishments that we found ourselves comparing to Papalote.  If I'm paying $20 for a burrito, your signature product, why then am I talking about somebody else's food?\n\nLike Public Enemy said a quarter century ago, \"Don't Believe The Hype!\"", "author": "Manuel S."}

This place is catering to the hipsters in SF and I get that and all, so maybe I need to check out the shop in La Mission for semi authentic Mexican grub. \n\nSaw a segment on Food Network about the triple threat burrito and that's what lured me to this place. When I got there and saw that the triple threat burrito is $20, I decided that wasn't gonna happen. I just can't do it. As much as my brain was saying \"do it, do it\" I just found it difficult to part with a 20 spot for a burrito, from a place that was given 3.5 stars by my fellow Yelpers. had this place been a 5 star spot, maybe that 20 would have slipped across the counter. \n\nWhat I ended up with was a Chile Verde burrito and it was not too bad. The meat was served up in giant chunks that were tender and almost really tasty, but just left a lot to be desired. The whole wheat tortilla fell apart as I was grubbin' and that wasn't cool. The salsa was very good. It tasted fresh, had a little bit of spice to it and packed a decent punch. But let's get real. If the 5 star item on your menu is salsa, you have fallen short.\n\nTo make matters worse, the place is the size of a Muni bus stop. Literally impossible to sit down and enjoy a meal because if more than 4 people are in the house, you are shit outta luck.

My boyfriend ordered his usual carne asada burrito and there was barely any meat in the burrito, as there was mostly just rice. I ordered the prawn quesadilla and when I received it I was confused because normally, the shrimp are so big that the tortilla is unable to close. Also, the mushrooms and peppers they put were a bit smaller in portion as well. The chips didn't taste as fresh as they normally do and the only thing we really enjoyed was the salsa.

I don't recommend it, I kind of wanted to gag. \n\nBut I did observe them cooking my carne and my boyfriends pollo fresh on the grill.

Not healthy. Never healthy. \n\nSo I took a bite of my burrito and I was underwhelmed. Their guac was terrible and I have made better guac and FAR better seasoned carne asada since I was 12 AND I'M A RED HEAD. And their salsa tasted like spicy marinara.

It's just not worth the price, or the effort it takes to walk a block from my place, and I'm bummed to say that. \n\nA plain quesadilla with just cheese and steak is $9.71. That's too much--and burritos cost more. The beans in the burritos are never drained enough, leaving a soggy, wet mess (and if you get your food \"super,\" AKA with cheese, guacamole, and sour cream, it's worse). The meat just doesn't taste that good.

A lot of people say this isn't \"authentic\" Mexican, but that's exactly the point. The city is full of cuisine that often melts various cultures together. \n\nHowever, with the Latin and Filipino influence, you would think the seating would encourage face to face or community style eating. Instead you sit at a small barstool 6inches from a blank wall. If you decide to open a new spot you should consult me about dining ambiance. Maybe get a place with a patio, that would be Ill. I know a lot of this is the SF landlords faults with their redic rental pricing. \n\nDon't order the tacos, I kinda wanted to ask for a refund because I barely got any meat and instead was greeted with a mountain of lettuce and tomatoes. If you're vegan that's cool i guess. \n\nIt's def worth trying if you go all out and get a burrito with prawns and of course the hot sauce is a thing of legend. \n\nBtw, the owner of the joint is a dope dj check him out.", "author": "Jerry S."}

This place has always been popular with the hipster crowd but with the owners' appearance on a Food Channel show the promotion of the place has reached mainstream level.\n\nThe food is actually decent.  It's not bad at all and in someways reflects what you would get at your local chain Chipotle, a Chipotle without the value.  Everything you get in ingredients at Chipotle you get a little less of it at Popalote.  It's really absurd they are now charging in excess of $20 for a single burrito.  What's even more egregious is that the raising of prices coincided with the TV appearance.  A brazen attempt to charge more just because they know their regular customers are foolish enough to spend more.\n\nThere are many Taqueria's in SF that are better not just in value but are just plainly better.  It seems such as scam to proclaim the idea that we make better tacos and burritos because we are a \"Mexican Grill.\"  I cringe at the notion that people go here instead of the other Mission Taquerias for the reason that since its decor is cleaner the food somehow must be more elevated.  \n\nThe way this place hides behind the idea that they are \"organic\" thus justifying their prices is laughable.  Go check out the Taco Shop at Underdog's for a true elevated \"Mexical Grill.\"  geez, if you wanted to get mexican food from a place that only sources organic food simply go to Chipotle.", "author": "Stephen V."}

The upside is that as a vegetarian, you have lots of options to add the you burrito, quesadilla, etc.  Soy-rizo or marinated tofu in the quesadilla are our favorites.  On the food alone, I would give them 4/5 stars, but there are certainly better burritos to be had in SF--just not really around the Panhandle.  But 0/5 for service, so that averages to 2/5.  The people behind the register here should be fired.  Where is the owner, as his/her business is suffering?  They are rude, inattentive, and would rather be watching the soccer match on the TV next to the register.  If you can get their attention, they may do you a giant favor and take your order.  They stop answering the phone about 30 minutes before closing, presumably so they don't have to serve you.  They don't give enough salsa, then charge extra if you ask for more, whereas most other taquerias have self-serve stations where you can take as much as you like.  After charging me almost $14 for a vegetarian burrito, charging me anything for an extra 1oz of salsa is pretty low.

Not the cheapest spot in town- two super burritos cost me an even $20 today with a tip included, but they were well worth it.  All orders do come with free chips and their special salsa/sauce...\n\nThe quality of the ingredients is one of the first things you will notice when you take your first bite of their food.  Most burrito spots will smother/hide the lesser quality meats in sour cream and salsa, but not here. As with any place- you need to know what to order- and I keep going back over and over for their pork chili verde burrito- their closest comparable to a carnitas which comes in a spicy tangy green chili sauce.  Order this one in a whole wheat burrito with black beans and you are well on your way to happiness.  While I am not a huge fan of the chips, the salsa dipping sauce is phenomenal.  Spicy as well as a bit creamy.  Very yummy, so popular you can now find it on the shelves at Wholefoods.\n\nAnyways, you will never go wrong if you visit either Papalote location.

However their mediocre, small, over-priced, nothing but bean filled burritos are nothing special. \n\nI got a simple grilled chicken super burrito. Barley any chicken, mostly all beans, very small and nothing fantastic about it. It was decent, but like I said I've had way better, twice as big burritos from hole in the walls for half the price. My girlfriend got the grilled Prawn burrito that literally only had 4 over cooked little shrimp in the entire thing for $10.25. REALLY! 4 small shrimp in a $10 burrito. VERY disappointed.\n\nThey also have something called the \"Triple Threat\" burrito for $19.95. I inquired about it imagining a gigantic \"Man Vs Food\" style burrito, but was told it's just a regular burrito with 3x the amount of meat. Why would anyone pay $20 for an all meat burrito when you can simply add double meat for $2. For an additional $4 you can get 3x the amount of meat in your burrito without paying $20. \n\nMaybe it was a bad first experience, maybe i'm snobby with my burrito's, maybe I like my burrito's a little different then Papalote makes them.

A super with everything at an authentic Mex place is around $8.50.  Here the barebones burrito starts at $9.50, and then everything else, such a guacamole, cheese, sour cream are each .99 apiece.  The cashier who wasn't too friendly was quick to say, how about some cheese, sour cream?  Of course, she wound up charging over $12 with these \"add-ons.\". And the carnitas wound up being about 7 pieces of beef, one so tough I couldn't chew it. Not very satisfying.  The salsa is divine as everyone always says it is, but the burrito itself is not so special as the delicious ethnic Mexican burrito shops offer. Anyway, as I walked out with my bag, I opened it to grab a chip to munch on and saw the scarcity of taco chips, so I turned and asked the cashier for a few more chips. \"Ok,\" she said.

Luckily, a table cleared so WHOO HOO!! I would suggest waiting to see if something opens up...I mean, you're waiting for your order anyway!\n\nI got the soyrizo burrito with black beans and a whole wheat tortilla and I added guac and OHHH BOY.

I kinda wish they had put on the menu somewhere that they charge extra for the tortilla rather than just saying, \"ALL VEGAN!\"\n\nThe burrito was OK, but very VERY filling! Their soyrizo was pretty good! :) The chips and salsa was good too, but they could've given more chips!

I ordered the super pollo burrito and It was not anything that blew me away. Just tasted real average. I have to admit that Iguana's back home is better and is cheaper too. I even purchased more of their highly coveted sauce. Their orange sauce was good but it wasn't even spicy at all. I guess when you are accustomed to a spicier sauce, anything else doesn't compare.\n\nI purchased a carne asada burrito for my friend and also gave him half of my chicken burrito since I am so generous and trying to watch my figure...more on just being generous though.

I ordered the super chicken burrito and took a seat. I was given the chips and salsa (before my meal) which was nice; I enjoyed munching on something while I waited for my meal. Yes, as everyone has stated, the salsa is pretty phenomenal. I ordered my burrito on a spinach tortilla because I don't usually see that at mexican restaurants. When my burrito came out it looked decent but I knew right away I wasn't going to be able to pick it up; this was going to be a fork and knife meal. I hate eating burritos with a fork and knife. I know it's hard to fold spinach tortilla wraps but if you have the balls to list them on the menu, you better know how to fold them.  \n\nThe burrito itself was just average. There wasn't anything stand out about it besides the fact that I was able to drizzle the amazing salsa all over it. There was a ton of rice and barely any guacamole/sour cream. What I also didn't like was they decided to garnish the burritos with old, spoiled, fruits and vegetables. What the hell were they trying to go for with that? \n\nIn short, it's definitely not the best burrito place in SF, for sure. I'm probably not going to come back unless someone is willing to buy my meal for me.", "author": "Tommy C."}

Papalote is one of my go-to joints for when I'm in the area and feel like a gut-busting burrito. The place is always busy but the line moves quick.

The chips!? Parking is WAY too hard in this neighborhood to drive there for just chips, if you do at least go down the street for pie at Chile Pies on Fulton and Baker to make the trek a worthwhile endeavor. \n\nMoving on...We had the triple threat burrito which by itself was almost 20 dollars, I guess because it has chicken, grilled steak and prawns. It's good but at almost 20 dollars it is SERIOUSLY over priced. \n\nMy burrito barometer is the mighty Expresso Burrito at Burrito Express (on Taraval and 26th or Divisadero and Bush) It is a \"wet\" burrito with steak beans cheese and rice inside and guacamole, melted cheese and sauce on the outside. \n\nThe triple threat at Papalote was comparable in size but the Expresso has it whipped when it comes to flavor, and value; as the flavor of the steak and chicken \"called in sick\". They were surprisingly bland in the triple threat leaving the grilled prawn to do the heavy lifting. The prawn were big and savory but not to the tune of $20.\n\n If I came here again I would give a prawn burrito a shot but I won't be going out of my way to come here again.", "author": "Jose U."}

I would order the burritos to-go or get tacos or quesadilla versions if i'm eating there. The chile verde(pork) is also very good. The chicken can be dry though. \n\nThe best thing about this place is the salsa and warm chips that you get with your meal. I just love how smooth and spicy it is. I buy a jar of it almost every time I go there. The salsa goes great over most anything. Keep it at the fridge at work, pour a bit over Trader Joe's tamales or fish sticks makes for a great lunch, spread it on bread for a spicy sandwich etc. They just started offering a factory-canned version but I just don't think it is the same. Just ask for the fresh made and they will fill a mason jar for you to take home. ($5.99 per jar of awesomeness, totally worth it if you ask me)\n\nDuring peak dinning hours though the place is a little too crowed for dining-in so this is a very good place to get a quick meal to-go.  \n\nFree Garage Parking is available under the Lucky's across the street.

It lacked in flavor so i had to pile on their salsa to add some to it.. it was much better with the sauce but the blandness to me didn't cut it.. the carne asada was also bland but a little better since the meat was more flavorful.

Which can be a downfall because I am always in Northern California and I don't think of awesome Mexican food coming from the SF area.  This burrito place is walking distance from where I always stay.  Since it's so hard to park in SF, I don't feel like being a burden on the people I stay with and ask for a ride to a different place or trying to maneuver getting around on the BART or MUNI (convenient of course, but I feel I would get lost)\n\nDuring one of my many trips to SF last year, we came to this establishment because we were told it had been on some show on Food Network.  I am obsessed with Food Network, so I thought why not.  I was very excited.\n\nMy review is almost like a lot of the other reviews.  My first time here, the place was packed and the line almost out the door.  I ordered the chicken burrito, the guy I was with ordered a carne asada burrito.  His was given first and it felt like I waited almost 20 minutes before my chicken burrito came out.  I was just going to assume the wait was because chicken takes longer to cook, or maybe they just forgot about me.  The burrito wasn't bad, the chicken was decent.  The burrito overall was okay.  I've had better.  The chips and salsa they gave however, was another story.  It was the best part of the meal hands down.  It is the only reason to go back in my opinion or if it is the closest Mexican place.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go back for a burrito.", "author": "Kate T."}

The burritos sit somewhere between better than Chipotle quality but not as good as others you will find in the city. The Chile Verde burrito was pretty good. What really turned me off from this place was their customer service, which is important to me.\n\nI had a 30% discount voucher through BBE and I followed all the fine print except that it was supposed to be good for dine-in only and I had to take it to go to bring it home because my wife couldn't come down with me. I understand that fine print is there for a reason but I thought it was ridiculous in this specific case, especially since there is virtually no seating available in their cramped space. They should actually be happy that I was taking it to go to free up space for other patrons. Instead, the girl at the register would not waiver at all and was quite rude about it too. \n\nThe funny thing is that they lost money because they didn't accept my voucher. I decided to order much less food because of this and not to buy a jar of their salsa/sauce, and now I will not be returning. I am not a \"customer is always right\" person, far from it. However, I am about taking each situation as they come and deciding what to do that is the best for your business and to please your customers, and not to be rude. The only difference from dine-in and to-go was to wrap my burrito in foil instead of putting it on a plate. Bad business decision.", "author": "Frank J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-03", "description": "What can I say about Papalote that hasn't already been said? Still, being a big fan I'll add my two cents even if I'm probably just repeating what many others before me have already expressed. \n\nFirst of all, what makes Papalote famous, aside from the burrito throwdown with Bobby Flay, is their roasted tomato salsa. It's absolutely delicious - so delicious they've bottled it and are now selling it at places like whole foods. I have no idea what they put in it, but whatever it is always leaves you feeling like you haven't gotten enough. The only drawback I can think of is that they charge you a buck or two for a second serving, which wouldn't be a problem at all if the servings weren't so damn tiny. \n\nThe ingredients they use for their burritos, tacos, and other dishes are of high quality. The steak and chicken are lean, tender, and tasty. The flame broiled flavor is very pronounced and quite gratifying. I do wish they'd put some more pico de gallo inside their burritos, because they tend to be a bit light on it; and call me weird, because I like lettuce in there too, which they refuse to put in. But in spite of those minor shortcomings I still can't get enough. \n\nI've seen some reviewers here talk about how the burritos are so huge and for the life of me I can't figure out what they're talking about. If anything they should be a bit bigger, but again, they taste good enough to me to make up for what they lack in size.\n\nSome other things I like are the fact that they offer four different types of tortillas for their burritos: flour, whole wheat, tomato, and spinach. I also think their service is top notch considering the volume they handle - everyone is friendly and proficient at what they do there. And finally, Miguel, one of the owners, is a class act and a multi-talented guy. Not only is he an entrepreneur as a part owner of two successful restaurants and now a product selling at the grocery store, but he's also a respected, established DJ.\n\nIn summary, good service, quality ingredients, and excellent flavor. The only thing keeping me from marking this one 5 stars is that I feel for the prices they charge they could give just a little bit more food. But really, Papalote is as close as you can get to 5 stars without being a full 5 stars.", "author": "Don W."}

Really, what's the difference between the ingredient and what I could make at home?  Nothing, but the flavors were decent, except for the chips which were stale and was pretty sure they were store bought.  \n\nHere is the thing about all these SF burritos, they are about as close to authentic Mexican as Tex Mex.  I mean the Triple Threat where they just pile on three kinds of meat is ridiculous. But the Tex Mex burrito was my expectation and Papalote met it without reservation.  In a pinch, I wouldn't mind trying it again.", "author": "Zack S."}

I went around 5:00 pm, for dinner, because I was already in the area and the place was already pretty full. \n\nSince we weren't that hungry, we ordered the Prawn Quesadilla ($9) to share.  You get a number from the cashier and sit down.  The place isn't really that big and my boyfriend and I were lucky to find a table.  They have water in the back for you to serve yourself.  Fairly quickly, an employee brought us a basket of chips and salsa/sauce.  The salsa is pretty unique, kind of creamy-ish? It was pretty good.  The chips are nothing special though.  \n\nOur prawn quesadilla came out in less than 10 minutes and when I saw it, I was pretty disappointed.  For a $10 quesadilla (after tax), I expected it to be super cheesy, filled with shrimp, or at least have some rice/beans on the side.  But instead, it was a flat, hardly cheesy, 5-shrimp quesadilla.  The prawns were pretty tasty, all 5 bites at least.  Needless to say, after eating the quesadilla, my boyfriend and I were still really hungry, actually even hungrier than before probably.  We ordered another bowl of chips/salsa ($1.50).  After finishing those, we then decided to get a carne asada burrito (super) ($8.50).  This was a much better choice than the quesadilla.  The burrito was quite large and tasted pretty good.  The beef was grilled nicely and the whole burrito tasted solid.  I asked the server if we could have some salsa for the burrito and he said it'd be an additional charge of $0.55 (which isn't a lot, but is still somewhat annoying considering I am not by the cash register/sitting at my table, and I just want to eat my meal).  \n\nOverall,  avoid the quesadilla.

I've had $5 dollar burritos at hole in the wall places that tasted WORLDS better than this burrito. (La Taqueria Cancun!!!) The 3 different meats didn't have much flavor to them other than dryness and burntness. It was all girth and quantity, no quality of flavor. They also packed the burrito very unevenly, so that all the special toppings (guacamole, cheese, sour cream) were all at one end! FAIL! \n\nSadly, the best thing in this meal was the orange house salsa which is good but does not justify the cost or flavor of the burrito... The salsa itself isn't super duper awesome, its just good. Not enough draw by itself to bring me back to this place.\n\n\n\n2nd Visit (today) - Ordered a Chorizo Burrito (not on the menu) Verdict: Yum, but...

Intrigued, my buddy Dave and I headed up to SF for lunch.\n\nThe Triple Threat Burrito:  4.0 stars\nJam packed with tender grilled chicken, tangy carne asada steak, and four large prawns, this was definitely a mighty pound for pound burrito.     Ask them to make it 'super\" and you'll get your breakfast, lunch, and dinner for $19.95.     Yes, the TTB is $19.95.     I know it might be expensive for most Yelpers, but I'm a major foodie so I don't mind trying this unique dish.      The prawns are the best part along with the asada (both were very succulent with its intense flavors).    I didn't care too much for the chicken.    No veggies here.   I would have liked to have the chicken moist with its natural oil oozing out.   Instead it was dry and left on the grill to long.   Now the size of the burrito isn't intimidating.   It looks normal size.    What you're paying for is the ingredients.    The asada are served in big chunks and the prawns are expensive on the market.   So it balances out when you consider the cost to make the TTB.   Definitely a come back.\n\nThe Chicken Adobo Burrito aka the \"MEXI-PINO\": 4.0 stars\nSo if I married a fine Mexican girl, I'm going to come with my own MEXI-PINO dish....aka Tamales inside a Lumpia!  LOL!  \nOh... and we'll have cute babies too!    \n\n* BAM *\n\n\nI know what you're thinking.   How can two Mexican guys come up with a Filipino dish and flip it with a Mexican twist.   LOL!   That's what I said until I saw this:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BFUXAyPrxU\nYes, the taste is there!   They got it down with the Adobo....................... however............... this time the chicken was very dry.      I'm going to suggest to dip that chicken into the adobo grease and oil for an extra hour bro!  GET THAT !@#$% GREASE UP IN THERE!!!  LOL!!    As for garlic rice, its enough for me to say they got it down like LOLA  (Grandmother in Filipino).   Good Job guys!     I'll definitely be back for this one!    I know.  I know.  I could make this at home.   But... Support your local home boys!\n\nNotes:\n- Parking.  We got here at 11:00am on the weekday.   Parking is horrible because it's all street parking.   There's a Safeway across the street, but you'll be paying meter and walking.\n- If you're not from SF like me, I suggest getting one to eat there and one to go.    And support your local home boys!\n- Ask for a burrito card.   Buy ten burritos and get the 11th free!   Sorry does not apply towards the Triple Threat.\n- If you got extra cash, buy the jar of the home made orange sauce.   Its spicer than the ones in San Jose.\n- Papalote means kite.  Check out their awesome kites hanging from the ceilings.   Sorry I forgot to take pics of them!\n- Don't come here if you're on a diet.   Seriously.  There's no such thing as a healthy burrito.  If you want make a healthy burrito, go across the street .... buy yourself a bag of tortilla....lettuce.... that's it.\n- Yes... I did buy both burritos on the same visit.   My bill was $31.14.   I ate the abobo burrito for lunch and shared the TTB.   Besides, I run weekly so I CAN eat.....BITCHES!!!", "author": "Walter P."}

But alas, I was starving and it was the only mexican joint close-by.\n\nThe staff were alright, I felt like I was being a little rushed to get out. I payed by card and wasn't offered my receipt. I didnt even know the transation was finished because the girl didn't say anything to me after swiping my card, just handed me a number and turned around to talk to a fellow co-worker.\n\nMy number was called and I brought my plastic card up only to be stared at by the cooks like I did something wrong. The food wasn't even ready, why would the call my number just to have me stand there and look like a chump? I waited a couple extra minutes until they yelled my number again, like I didn't get the memo that my number was called.\n\nI decided to get the carne-asada super burrito, but I guess that's code for bean burrito with a light sprinkle of meat. I'm not exaggerating, this was a straight up bean burrito for $11. The meat that I did manage to get was quite nicely flavored, but it was really dissappointing getting mouth fulls of refried beans bite after bite. All together it was really just a sub-par burrito.\n\nNeedless to say, I won't be going out of my way to come here.

I think it is a zoning procedure that if you have a college, you must also have a neighborhood tacqueria.  Davis has Guads, USF has Papalote.  I have eaten at a lot of tacquerias in my hayday, however, Gordo will forever be number 1.  Entering Papalote, business was bustling.  It was crowded yet the serveurs were very amiable.  I ordered the super burrito with pollo while my girl got the mole burrito.  I believe the difference between a regular burrito and a super burrito is that on the latter, they give you sour cream and guacamole.  The walls were adorned with achievements they had gotten such as best burrito, etc., however, when it comes to Mexican joints, i hardly take those into account.  \n\nWhile waiting, we were given chips and their special papalote roasted salsa.  Dipping the chip in, the salsa was different.  It was a sauce so there were no sliced cubes of tomatoes.  It tasted almost like curry and I did not like it too much.  It had a kick to it, but for me, salsa isn't salsa unless its traditional cut tomatoes.  The chips were decent, good enough to pass the time until the burrito arrived.  According to their video, all their meat is cooked fresh and their pollo chicken is their specialty.  Taking a bite of the burrito, I hardly tasted any chicken.  In addition, the burrito was already breaking.  I am used to those shenanigans from Chipotle, but if you are a legit $8-$9 burrito, that should not be happening.  As a result, halfway through, the infrastructure could not hold anymore and it broke, rendering me to eat it with a fork.  Inside the burrito was the traditional picca de gallo.  The refried beans were good and the sour cream and guac were good, however, the meat was very scarce and I felt as if I was playing hide n go seek with it.  No mater how good the condiments are, the meat is the lifeblood of the burrito and the IV drip was down to its last drop.  I took a bite out of my girl's mole burrito and it tasted like yams.  It just tasted weird.\n\nI really do not understand the hype behind this place.  I do not feel this place is authentic and I further widened the chasm between award winning \"best burrito\" given out by huge syndicated journals and papers.  The burrito was poorly constructed and while fat, do not let the girth fool you.  There is hardly any meat.  In addition, I do not like the tortilla where its semi-crispy as if placed on a grill.  I prefer it softer, steamed in that machine.  In addition, the burritos are pretty expensive.

We left, went to a favorite sf watering hole and sat down with some friends to eat our lunch.  Was it good?  Meh.  It was pretty good, my boyfriend thought.  It was tasty.  Was it $19.95 good?  No f-ing way. Bummer of a price, when there's a LOT better places to get a MUCH better burrito for less than half the price.\n\nThis leaves me to my side note that my vegetarian burrito (again, rice, beans, cheese, guac) was still hovering in the $10 range.

With out a beverage my bill was $29.00 and some change....get real!!!!\n\nThe first time my overpriced burrito came to the table it was missing the chicken, and the person that was sitting across from me was also missing the carne asada...hmmm weird...but they fixed it for both of us... \n\nIt was very mediocre at best.

I recently downgraded Ike's Place from five stars to three stars, citing an unnecessary raise in prices as well as a slight dip in quality.  Papalote has also raised their prices recently thanks to their much deserved notoriety, but as I stated in the Ike's update, places shouldn't raise prices just because they can.  Also, the burritos are noticeably smaller than they were a couple years ago, so you're paying more for less.\n\nHaving said that, it's still the best burrito in the city.  I went there after B2B and the place was packed, however the wait wasn't that much longer than usual and the quality was top notch (Ike's could learn a thing or two here).\n\nAnd of course, the sauce is still as crack-tastic as ever.\n\nI give Papalote Mexican Grill a fantastic score of 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nLove,\nJames", "author": "Cheryll M."}

Very flavorful steak, lots of delicious cheese, and their sour cream and guacamole combo are to die for!  \n\nIt was too crowded in there to sit down, and cramped to the point of feeling awkward standing so close to other people because the staff would have to walk by occasionally with stuff and would need quite a bit of space.  Having to jam pack yourself against something to make room was kinda... weird.. in a claustrophobic kind of way... even though I'm not claustrophobic.\n\nAnyway, I didn't stick around to watch my co-worker eat his Triple Threat, but I imagine that he enjoyed it ridiculously.

I had the Prawn super burrito with refried black beans ($9.25). The tortilla was grilled first, which I like and there were about 4 seasoned prawns inside. They were tasty, but too few. The refried black beans were good and vegan (for those of you out there). Burritos came with chips and salsa for each person. The homemade salsa was much different than most, but not quite as good as I had hoped. I read other reviews of it being \"addicting\", \"amazing\" and \"out of this world\". I would have just called it \"pretty good\". I think La Victoria's orange sauce is a little better. One thing I didn't like, was that there wasn't enough rice in the burrito. Because of this, mine was very squishy with the beans, sour cream and guacamole in there. It needed something to hold it together. \n\nParking was ridiculously hard this trip to Papalote and though I would come back, I don't think I'll crave it and go out of my way to visit.

A few tries, actually, because I really wanted to believe this place is as good as the original. Unfortunately, it's not even close. And after having lunch there today, I'm swearing off ever going there again.\n\nThe main thing to consider is that everything that makes the original Papalote good is sub par in every aspect here. The flavor and texture of the food is bland and mediocre, their customer service ranges from friendly to borderline rude, the seating is far worse than the Mission location (OK seriously, just a second, how is that even possible), and the worst part of all? THE SALSA ISN'T THE SAME. It's a runny, bland, watered down version of the original mouthgasmic salsa you will find at the 24th St. location. It's literally weak sauce. Their guacamole also tastes like it's store bought, as opposed to the original location's totally delicious homemade-tasting guacamole.\n\nI ordered a carne asada burrito and asked to have it cooked medium, and the cashier just gave me this confused look. I then clarified my request, and someone else behind the counter showed her how to enter that on the touchscreen (I guess?) but when I got it, guess what, it was completely well done.\n\nUgh.

The food cold by the time I got home and I live about 10-15 minutes away. I ordered the carne Asada burrito because of how good my friends said It was. The burrito was dry and kept getting dryer the more I tried to overlook it. The only way I was able to finish the burrito without having to swamp my mouth with coca cola was to douse it with the salsa. The salsa was absolutely f***ing delicious. It was the reason why this got a three star instead of a two. One thing that you should know is that the salsa is purred and not chunky. This makes it better for burritos compared to chips. I ordered a side order of the habbenero salsa which was so delicious. The problem was I couldn't taste the burrito with the amount of salsa needed to make it non dry. After this unfortunate take out experience I wanted to try the actual burrito in house. I went with a friend and he ordered the chicken casadilla. The casadilla came out cold and was really dry also which I have never experienced with a casadilla before.

I came stopped here on my way to a friends place because one of my friends told me that I have to stop by here if for nothing else but the tomato salsa, which they are known for. \n\nI like the fact that they give you a variety of choices for tortillas and beans, which is always a plus in my book. So I'm standing there waiting in line to place my order and this place is just packed. Good sign right? So I place my order and ask about having my salsa on the side and getting extra. The girl helping me says, ya, not a problem as she starts taking the order from the person behind me. Great, everything is looking good and I can't wait for my food. \n\nSo I wait. And wait. And wait. I see several people who came in after me get their meals before mine. I continue to wait. Finally after waiting for 20 minutes, they finally call my name. At this point I am so hungry I just don't care anymore plus I'm freezing to death cuz I'm still in my shorts. So I look in the bag and see that there is only one thing of salsa so I ask the guy for another. $0.50 he tells me. I just look at him like are you kidding? So I say forget it and just take off. \n\nAt this point I am really hoping that this place lives up to its name cuz damn, I am pretty annoyed. So I get to my friends place and try out the burrito thinking that its going to be on par with El Faralito or at least be slightly behind. Its not. Far from it, its a pretty standard burrito. So then I put some of this \"famous\" salsa on it thinking that it'll do the trick. Nope. Nothing special to me. Needless to say, the burrito was a disappointment to me and for the 20 minute wait I endured waiting for this thing, it just wasn't worth it.

Seating is a little bit limited.  It's not super relaxing to eat there, but if you get a spot at one of the tables in the front you'll be out of the foot traffic of people waiting in line.\n\nBURRITOS \nGreat, fresh ingredients. The anchiote chicken is my favorite.  Ton of flavor.  Try the super chicken burrito with whole black beans.  It's a nice combo.\n\nPLATES\nAside from burritos and tacos, Papalote does a nice set of plates.  My favorites are the Chicken al Pechuga (sp?) and the Chicken Mole plate.  The Chile Verde is good too but I find it to be unreasonably spicy sometimes.\n\nAll in all, they keep me coming back.", "author": "michael l."}

Since this place was on 7x7 magazine's 100 places to eat, particularly for their chips and salsa, I've always wanted to try it.  My hubby and I were going to the city anyway, so we decided to make a stop at this place for a quick lunch.\n\nThe salsa was admittedly good, but I'm not sure if I would call it \"the best ever\".  The chips were ok, but I prefer superthin chips to the thick ones they serve here.  I was here for the chips and salsa (which I can eat all day), but I figure I should at least give their other food a try.  I wound up getting the chicken mole tacos, which were pretty good.  entree-sized portion.  It was a decent-sized portion for lunch, larger than taco-trucks but not ginormous like what you would get as an entree at most mexican restaurants.\n\nIt was a good experience overall, but with all the good mexican places in the Mission, I'd probably try a few other restaurants before going back to this one.", "author": "Arlene M."}

I need much more of that house chipotle salsa (which I do like - it's smoky, spicy and thick), especially since the food is not that flavorful.  \n\nI've never eaten at the actual location (I take it to go) because the space is so small and cramped (it's uncomfortable to even wait for your order inside) but I usually do my grocery shopping across the street at Lucky's and then pick up my order when I'm done.

The same rude girl comes back and says fine, I'll take your credit card info. (I thought only the \"manager\" could?) So I give it to her, and she says ok, just bring it in with you. I tell her that's not going to happen because we have someone else on their way to pick it up, I can't have them come to the office, grab my card, and then bring it all the way there just to show it, and eitherway, it's my card, and I'm not the one picking it up. As if she wasn't rude enough, she's basically yelling at me saying that they can't do it. Now it's my turn to be firm, and I tell her that she has to do this. I have a whole office of hungry people waiting, I've already set someone up to go pick it up, and she's basically lost at least 10 customers today. \n\nAll in all, they finally agreed to process the order.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-12", "description": "Wow, how many times have I been to Papalote before finally reviewing it? I can't count. I've probably gone through 50 of those little red free burrito cards. Anyway, it is awesome for a number of reasons, pay attention and you will learn a couple tips and tricks for your next visit:\n\n-the salsa is off the chain. *tip* if you like to put it on your burrito, and you find yourself not having enough left for the chips, ORDER YOUR BURRITO WITH HOT SAUCE INSIDE IT. They call it hot sauce, not salsa, when ordering it inside the burrito. It doesn't cost extra this way, whereas it does cost extra to get another container of it.\n\n-the vegetarian options are great; Soyrizo is especially good\n\n-if you like burritos, make sure you get a little red card and get it punched every time, and get it punched when your lazy friends without cards get burritos too. This way every eleventh burrito you get is free.\n\n-If you're ordering to go anyway, call your order in ahead of time (um, no I don't have them on speed dial). If you call it in, you can skip to the front of the line no matter how many people are waiting.\n\n-the prawn burrito is unreal\n\nThe only drawback for me is that the service from the women at the register can be curt and inflexible. A couple of them are great, but many of them seem to give off the \"I'm gangster and I'm cooler than you\" vibe, which is probably true, but I don't need that when I'm getting a burrito.\n\nAlso, for the amount of neighborhood peeps that are absolute regulars here, they hardly engage at all with the local clientele, and seem to treat everyone like a tourist. They don't really ever go out of their way to hook you up, even if they've seen you for six straight days. For example, the finished red card only covers a standard burrito, and I always order guac on it, and they always charge me the extra 1.50 or so instead of just throwing in the guac because I go there all the time. A little customer appreciation would be nice, instead of only taking advantage of their superior food and knowing people will come back.", "author": "brian b."}

Four years of college, do you hear me?? Four years I spent scavenging hunter-gatherer style for something decent to eat without a bus ride. Then, as if to mock me, the neighborhood waits a few years and busts out with this.\n\nAnyway, it was cheap, delicious, veg-friendly (you know, in case that's your thing), and the guacamole was fresh.

Also, I noticed that on the menu there's no price listed for the guacamole, just \"Market Price.\" Like it's a fucking lobster or something.

I'm even tempted to go back up to three stars because the two stars looks so dramatic, but I have to be honest and think about what I'd personally like to see in a review. \nI lived for a long while in the heart of the San Diego taqueria land and of course I am partial.  However, I have lived in SF for many years now and have come to terms with the mexican food here.  And like I've stated in my other review, I think that salsa is one of the most important things at a Mexican restaurant.  If the salsa is no good, forget it. But the food has to be right too. So let's take a look:\n\nAgain, this place is not bad. But, it has no competition in this neighborhood, so it's all relative. The food is prepared well and feels healthy, but not unauthentic. I have tried many things on the menu and I'd have to say my favorite is the shrimp burrito that is cooked in white wine. \n\nNow for the other stuff.  Although I said that this place is not unauthentic, I wouldn't call it authentic.  This is a place is where my friends who don't eat at taquerias go.  The cooks are legit mexicanos and are very friendly, but sometimes the young girls working the register are a little over-zealous and at times can get a little annoying. I'm not trying to be mean. It's just a little annoying when you're looking up at the menu and no one's behind you and the girl keeps yelling, \"can I help you? can I help you!\" Even after I'd said that I need a minute. But I guess it's better this way than the opposite of ignoring you!\n      \nAs for the salsa. I don't think it's that great. It's not bad. But nothing to write home (or yelp) about. Also, they charge an extra 50 cents for a second tiny container of it. And it's not the money, it's the principal of it. The other day I paid the extra change when I ordered. Then when they didn't give me the extra salsa with my order, and I asked for it, the girl made such a big deal about it and went back and checked the old receipts to make sure I had paid for the extra tiny container.  No big deal, but weird.\n\nThe reggae and dub they play there is super cool. But the whole thing of, \"do you want to make your burrito 'SUPER'?\" is weird and too McDonald's-like for me. \n\nIn short, I'd say it's better than El Bolazo on Haight St. \nBut go down to the Mission and eat at El Toro instead.", "author": "sonrisa m."}

But I was somehow convinced that perhaps Papalote would be different due to the high praise on Yelp. \n\nTried the grilled veggies, grilled chicken, mole chicken, carnitas, even soyrizo. The meat has been dry, the veggies tasted blech, and your soyrizo was a constant reminder that what I was eating was, in fact, fake meat (good fake meat is an illusion). Beans are cooked ok, but the pinto beans are vegan (meaning no porky taste goodness). The benefit of a whole wheat tortilla (though they do grill them) is not worth it to me when the experience of eating the burrito becomes one extended episode of regret that lasts for hours upon hours as I fight my food coma of displeasure. \n\nPapalote, I'm pretty sure that you are a resident of Fattyland despite the pretense of \"healthfulness\" with your whole wheat tortillas, fake meat, and vegan beans.

The carne asada is good and there's something about the way the fixings of the entire burrito come together that make it special. Plus, I wasn't overwhelmed with grease dripping down the side of my mouth or a puddle of it sitting at the end of my burrito. The tortilla chips are fresh and crunchy and sit perfectly in a wooden bowl brought to your table before the rest of you order is delievered. Alongside the chips is Papalote's flavorful yet spicy red salsa.  While the salsa is good, it's more of a blended salsa and I typically prefer chunkier salsas. However, Papalote's salsa really is that good because they sell it in jars for those of you addicted. Overall, a must try place!", "author": "Maya S."}

Miguel, the owner is a super nice guy and hooked it up both times. The first visit I had the Triple Threat Burrito (named after some hometown DJ heroes) with refried black beans. It was a monster burrito and thank goodness my friend was there to split it with me. The chicken, beef and huge shrimp made my tummy happy. \n\nIt was a damn good burrito. And this is coming from someone who grew up in SD, where we know our Mexican food. It's definitely a different style then what is standard for SD, but it was good nonetheless. What \"hella\" intrigued me was the salsa that they serve their food with. It's crazy good.  We spent most of the conversation trying to figure out what was in the sauce. Definitely some chipotles, but the rest was hard to deduce. \n\nDay 2: So came here on another occasion to have brunch with Miguel, and so he and my friend could talk business. He is the nicest person you could meet. He decided to jump behind the line and make some special chilaquiles for us and holy heck they were delicious. The sauce and tortilla combined so well and complimented the egg and cheese perfectly. We tried to pick Miguel's brain to have him reveal the ingredients for his salsa but he said only a few select inside men know his secrets. Oh and he said the copycat recipes that you find on the internet are \"way off\". \n\nOverall, you can't go wrong in the city with Papalote's.

It's because Ed M. led me to Papalote, home of soyrizo Mexican food. \n\nIt's been a long time since I've had satisfying Mexican food. I mean, let's face it --- I'm a no-cheese no-meat girl. And that means no Mexican. You can't order a quesadilla and say, \"Um, but can you leave out the cheese, please?\" Yeeeahhh... \n\nYou can't do that.\n\nSo when I threw meat and cheese out the window, I accepted the fact that with it went Mexcian, for the most part. I had to settle for Mexican food in the lame ways still available to me (special-ordering the hell out of a burrito, for example).\n\nAnd then last night, a soyrizo burrito from Papalote changed my world forever --- again.\n\nWhat is \"soyrizro,\" you ask? I don't know, exactly. But they swore it's entirely vegan. And it made my food taste as through it was REAL Mexican.\n\nHallelujah.\n\nAnd the magical soyrizo appears in EVERYTHING at Papalote.\n\nOh --- and their red pepper salsa is pretty good, too. Weird texture and I was a little bit unnerved by it at first, but then suddenly I was picking up steam with the chips and I probably could have just emptied the dish straight into my mouth. \n\nI guess what I'm saying is, it grows on you, okay?\n\nI'd like to give this place five stars. Believe me; I would. It's really hard not to. But, I realize that the vast majority of items on the menu are indeed NOT soyrizo. And the vast majority of people eating here are NOT vegans. And there are a million taquerias in this town.

Sorely. But if you're a veggie like me and you're tired of not wanting to ask whether they use lard in their beans, rice, tortillas, water, etc., then this place will really do it for you. The tofu is good. The soyrizo is good (it really is). The seating and atmosphere are not good.\n\nI'd give this place five stars for vegetarians, but I'm trying to rate this more with the masses in mind.\n\nUPDATE:  3/22/09\n==============\n\nOK, I didn't really know what I was talking about when I wrote my initial review.  Papalote makes excellent burritos of all kinds.  I've been doing takeout regularly on Sunday nights, and although the wait can been semi-long because this place is all the rage with USF students these days, it's well worth it.\n\nThe actual atmosphere inside leaves a lot to be desired.  It's cramped, and the chairs and stools aren't particularly comfortable.  But they do play really random break-dancing movies from the '80s all the time (in addition to scary old cartoons), and the flat-screen TV has weird stuff burned into the screen.  That more than makes up for the uncomfortable seating.\n\nUPDATE:  3/7/10\n==============\n\nI'm knocking Papalote down a star for a few reasons.  First and foremost, the place isn't wheelchair accessible except for takeout.  Yes, a wheelchair can physically enter the building, but the counters and tables are all so high that a wheelchair user wouldn't be able to eat here.  How difficult would it be to have one standard-height table?\n\nAlso, I'm concerned about their recent price hike.  Whereas this place was a decent value before, it's now slightly overpriced.  I'm even more worried by the fact that my burrito from here last week seemed smaller than usual.  Hopefully, they just folded the tortilla differently or temporarily ran out of standard-sized tortillas.  If smaller burritos are the trend, I might knock them down another star--and stop my weekly visits.", "author": "John S."}

Standard burritos only come with rice, and your choice of meat and beans.  That's it.  Everything else is extra charge - including - cheese, sour cream, salsa, guacamole, etc...So an average burrito with all the fixings can cost over $10 alone.  My bf went got the green chile pork burrito and I had the chicken burrito.  We both went with the spinach tortilla, which we both enjoyed.  Each burrito does come with chips and the amazing salsa. Both burritos were pretty bland and lacked flavor.  I'm not sure how their burritos beat out Bobby Flay's creations on Throwdown.  Such a mystery! The only thing I would really come back for is the salsa - best salsa I've had in my life...I think.  And to the staff, crack a smile once in a while, will ya?", "author": "Cindy T."}

Probably not all that much, but I know what I like, and a veggie burrito that's vegan by default is one of those things. \n\nNot only do normal, regular veggie burritos come without cheese, but there's marinated tofu, soyrizo, and grilled veggies on the menu. I like to keep things simple, so I just get the normal veggie burrito (which comes with potato, carrot, and mushrooms), which will cost you a cool $5.70, and comes with warmed-up corn chips (a big deal for us Canadians who are not accustomed to such finery) and a small ramekin thing of god's own salsa. \n\nThere are those, I hear, who don't like Papalote's salsa, and they are wrong. The only thing I would change about Papalote is that in my perfect world, they would sell their salsa by the gallon if you asked them nicely.

They marinade the tofu in this amazing achiote chile sauce and then saute it until slightly crispy. The tofu mole is so so. I still prefer homemade mole, but it's still worthy of some praise, nonetheless. The fish is super fresh and perfectly seasoned.\n\nTheir guacamole is not my favorite but they do make a mean salsa. They don't have a salsa bar but they do have pickled jalapeos and carrots in the back (if you know where to look.) This place is usually crowded and there is never anywhere to sit, unless you sit along the wall in the back. I'm not a picky eater, but I don't really like the tomatoes they put in their food.

I've recommended this place to everyone I know who loves a good burrito- unfortunately, most people I know don't live close enough to warrant a trip for a burrito. Sadly, if they only knew the incredible burritos this place puts out, it would be far worth the trip. \n\nI've only ordered two burritos from here: carne asada and the prawns. I don't think I need much else. The carne asada is really nice due to the fact it's grilled right there- none of that beef being ladled (with juices galore) onto your precious burrito- this is grilled and chopped up right in front of your eyes. They do everything else the same way, which is nice. Oh, right, the prawns. Well, let me just say that the first time I had it, I couldn't talk until I finished the whole damn thing because my mind wouldn't let me stop eating. \n\nThe salsa (liquid-y rather than tomatoes galore) was incredible- thin but full-bodied, smoky with just the right kick- it has your mind trying frantically to identify that one thing they throw in there to make it so damned irresistible. (Answer is pumpkin seeds.) Also, they have their salsa available for sale by the jar. Though it's not advertised, I've done so- $5 for half a quart, I think.

Then again, this may have something to do with the fact that they are healthy, and personally I like a little gluttony in my burrito--which is another way of saying grease and lard, I guess.\n\nThis place is conveniently located in my 'hood, and it's true that the red salsa is nice, but it's not all that spicy to me, and there aren't any other options for spicing up the burrito or tacos, and no pico de gallo (the salsa is a little more in line with a mole or thicker chile-based sauce that would go over an enchilada). Personally, I like to sweat a little when I eat Mexican food--there are studies that say hot food increases metabolism and creates a sense of euphoria of sort, hence, not doubt the reason I tend to eat it so much. Anyway, this salsa doesn't provide the requisite kick, and the burritos are a bit on the bland side. \n\nNow, on the other hand, their grilled lime prawns tacos are pretty nice. They have a bit of delicious crispy singe to the edges of the prawns and are served with a tiny portion of jicama salad (I usually ask for an extra dose of this salad - it's quite good). This is a pretty healthy option to the burrito, and why bother with their large, though somewhat bland version. \n\nThe service here is courteous and friendly, but sloooowww. So sloooww. They really need to pick up the assembly-line philosophy here. They often give me something different than what I order, though. And there isn't much seating, either (I'm wishing they would take over that weird Korean bar a few doors down that seems to be conducting some sort of illicit business - they have enough seating, but rarely any customers). \n\nSo, reading the other reviews, I know I'm in the minority here, and it's no doubt a matter of taste, but I prefer my Mexican food with a bit more flavor and decadence (think El Castillito, El Farlito, La Taqueria, La Corneta, Cancun, Gordo and Cactus in the East Bay).

The marinated tofu was my favorite but I also quite often went for the chicken, soyrizo or fish. My suggestions would be the tofu and chicken with black beans, fish with pinto and the soyrizo in the breakfast burrito. They provide different tortillas for no extra charge, spinach or sun dried tomato. Don't forget to add their hot sauce. It beautiful.\n\nThey also have this black bean dip that is simply black beans with cheese melted over the top but it manages to be magical. I've had the tacos and the quesadillas and they've never disappointed but the true stars of this place are the burritos. They won best burrito in SF three years in a row or something like that. I believe it.\n\nService is surprisingly quick too, even when there's a line out the door. There's about ten people behind the counter ensuring that. You're in and out within ten minutes and a burrito and a beer will cost you less than $10. Can't go wrong.", "author": "Torey B."}

Be that as it may, if you ever end up at Papalote again, and you feel like having tacos I would like to recommend the following: The fish tacos (white fish sauteed in white wine and butter), the mole tacos (our dad's mole recipe with chicken breast or with TOFU!

I grew up in SF proper and while this place has always been damn near the closest burrito shop to my place, I've always ventured elsewhere. That's because their burritos have been just average and SF is FULL of top notch burrito shops more worthy of my money. \n\nI saw this place on Bobby Flay's a few weeks ago, though, so I decided to go back. They beat Bobby with their \"triple threat\" burrito (steak, chicken and shrimp). It looked pretty damn good. So my bf and I were all excited to give this place a new shot. We'd been looking forward to breaking our new years diet with this mean lookin burrito ALL day. But we get there, and the damn thing is $19.95! Are you kidding me? For a burrito? So I asked the nice lady at the counter how much it was BEFORE they got all the publicity from the food network, and she says $14.99. Ok, now that's just bad business. I mean you know that being on TV is going to increase volume. That's a given. you dont need to jack up the price because your foot traffic is going to double or triple anyway. But NOW that you have increased it, a lot of the people that come in are now not going to spend the $20 and would rather just opt for your regular old $9 carne asada.  So that's what we did. We opted for one of their other not so famous burritos and not to my surprise, it was as average as I remember and I will not be returning. I'm sorry, but with all the incredible mexican food in this fine city, I find it absurd to spend $20 on a burrito...even if i'm rollin' in the dough.", "author": "Catharine C."}

Well, it's not all that surprising since things seem to come in pairs around here:  There are two independent cafes on the same block, though one is being remodeled (Central Coffee and Cafe Organica).  There are even two Starbuck's on the same block (one inside of Albertson's).  What's next, a competitor to \"Gabin\"?!? \n\nPapalote serves up some good grub.  The chips and salsa are a great start, and the various burritos quite flavorful.  I usually get the burritos with pinto beans because the refried black beans tend to drown out the other flavors.  \n\nAbove all, you gotta try the CHILAQUILES.  So addicitive that I could have them on Saturday for breakfast, and then again on Sunday.  This is one of my favorite Mexican dishes, and Papalote does it right.  Note: If you are health conscious, ask them to go easy on the cheese.  \n\nMy main criticism of this place is that it doesn't serve coffee.  Bottom line is that I need a cup of joe with the my chilaquiles.  If you find yourself in this predicament, run over to Starbuck's (pick one) and get venti, extra hot whatever with shot of whatever.

I'm a light eater, but I definitely cleaned my plate on this one. And even licked my tiny to-go container of salsa clean.\n\nI took advice from a fellow Yelper and tried the soyrizo. And survey says...it's AMAZING. In fact, it's what inspired me to actually create a yelp account. I don't really like chorizo, and I don't  like fake meat, and I don't like paying extra for things (it's an extra $2.00)...but lemme tell ya, soyrizo is legit, and worth it.\n\nThe soyrizo has a wonderful spice--similar to the salsa, but I think the salsa is actually spicier. By itself, or as an entire burrito, it may have been overwhelming, but it was a perfect addition to the quesadilla, and would have likely made a great taco. \n\nI begrudgingly gave my sister a bite, and she also thought it was fabulous. She looked a little disappointed to return to her chicken burrito. However, the burrito is a better bang for your buck--the quesadilla, though tasty, is slightly underwhelming if you're looking for a solid meal.\n\nTips: \n1. If your meal comes with beans, get the refried black beans. My sister said they've got enough flavor and tastiness to make upgrading to the super unnecessary.\n\n2. If you're ultra cheap, like me, stop to get a drink from the Albertson's directly across the street. You'll need one for the spicy salsa, but they're priced to rip you off.\n\n3. Try the soyrizo. Honestly.\n\nWe ordered food to go, so I can't rate the service. We were late picking it up, and it was still hot. Which either means it was late, or they're amazing at sealing in the tasty heat.

El Castillito is the 'Loin is solid, El Farolito is renowned, I've ever met my share of El Buen Sabor devotees- but nothing, and I do mean nothing, tops Papalote.

The chicken is hot and well-seasoned- but not really spicy.  Leave the spice for the salsa which, as I mentioned above, is perfect.  I am generally a bigger fan of salsa fresca and don't fawn over smooth, blended salsas- but this stuff is magic.  The fish, the soyrizo, everything is just perfect no matter how you slice it.  \n\nPut your delici-osity in a taco, get a quesadilla if you like, but me, I can tell you what-  I'll be asking for a burrito and enjoying a gut-busting piece of heaven, courtesy of Papalote.", "author": "Jeff M."}

I've previously ordered nachos topped with grilled chicken.  They just melt shredded cheese on the chips (which gets greasy) and then add a sliced dry chicken breast on top.  More like chicken jerky!

I finished the chips in 2 minutes thinking there were free refills on chips. I heard my neighbor ask for a refill and they said $1.50 more. WHOA!\n\nLuckily the guy gave me an extra salsa when my burrito came. Salsa is as good as they say.\n\nMy gf also got the horchata and it was very disappointing. \n\nOverall, their burrito is one of the best ever. But at $19.95, never again.

Like a lot of people, I (re)visited Papalote after their \"triple-threat burrito\" was featured on the Food Network show \"Throwdown with Bobby Flay\". \n\nWhen I first arrived at the restaurant, I was excited to try their famous burrito because I was super-hungry and it is rare that my girlfriend agrees to eat mexican food because it's her least favorite type of food. I think if she wasn't as hungry as I was and not a big fan of the show and Bobby Flay, I couldn't have convinced her to come here. \nWhen we entered the restaurant, they were sweeping the floor which I found odd, but went straight for the register to order. I almost ordered without realizing the triple-threat burrito was $19.95!!! WTF, why would ANY burrito cost that much? Maybe, the price would have been justified if the beef was Kobe beef and the prawns and chicken were extremely high quality, but, as with most burrito joints, that was not the case. Honestly, I think they are just taking advantage of the fact that their burrito was made so popular by being featured on TV and they know enough people (like me) will come in and eat it just for that reason. In any case, the burrito was delicious (despite the price) but not even close to being worth it. I have had better burritos at El Farolito for about $6 and most places that have similar burritos charge at most $10. What really upset me was, knowing that my gf and I were sharing the burrito, they still only gave us one small bowl of chips. When I asked for more, they said it would be $1.25 extra. I just spent $23 for a burrito with all the fixing and they are nickle and diming me for some extra chips. Are you serious??? That's not all, they continued to clean the floor (now with a mop) and I smelled dirty mop water and cleaner the whole time we were eating our lunch. Not very appetizing to say the least.

Today I stopped by in an attempt to have a better meal.This time I tried the chorizo con huevos. While waiting 20 minutes for my meal the staff decided to open the door so they could run out a catering order and just left it open taking the place down to a nice balmy 50 degrees. The meal was below average, the tortillas were stale and the eggs were just not good. This place in a town full of very good tacquerias is at the bottom of the list.", "author": "Jon W."}

While I was laughing about their \"$9 for 2 tacos item\" in my head and figuring out whether the mole was worth trying, some folks breezed past up to the register- demonstrating how it is done. \nSo we followed ordering our 2 burritos for $20 (um what? pinkies out, folks!) and waited awkwardly by the door cuz that was the only space left. Got the stuff a while later, and I was pretty hungry so it tasted good, turbo saucy too. This was NOT car food - laundry, please. The super burrito is 2 meals so price wise that kind of evens out, right? The Mole wasn't a blackish Mole which I was hoping for, (the classic choco chili peanut pepita rad mix with sesame seeds on top) I get that a mole is any sauce that has been ground up, but I always hope for that one, and wonder why it isn't in more burritos!  The mans burrito (not Super) was d-r-y so he poured the salsa on it and was ok with that. \nThis place made me miss the East O taco trucks, I'll remember that.\nOther than competitive eaters, who orders a $20 triple threat burrito?", "author": "Catherine R."}

I consider Mexican food to be like my Chinese food, cheap and good.  \n\nHowever, after running around the Haight for The Go Game, I enjoyed two delicious chicken mole tacos.  They gave a generous amount of chicken and the sauce was tasty.  Only complaint is that they didn't double the tortillas!  If you're going to put so much sauce you have to double the tortillas!  I ended up eating it all in pieces.\n\nI would say I'd come here for a snack and get a couple of tacos for $4.75.  I don't think I'd be too thrilled to drop $8 on a super burrito that isn't so big or a breakfast burrito for $8.75.

Not only do they have a wide selection of tortillas, killer salsa, and high quality ingredients, they cook your meat after you place your order! Steak, chicken, or prawns are all fantastic, although they tend to fail at cutting the steak, and oftentimes I find myself pulling out half the meat in one bite. Let's try a little harder, guys.\n\nThe prices are semi-high considering the burritos are on the smaller side, but if you want a lot of meat you can order the special burrito that comes with steak, chicken AND prawns. I have never ever enjoyed a prawn burrito before, but theirs is so well-cooked, juicy, and a great contrast of textures. \n\nI dislike that they usually skimp on rice, beans, and all the other ingredients, but I think the tortillas must be small because the burrito always seems at capacity despite the fact that I know there's only seven kernels of rice in there. I think it could be improved if the burrito was bigger, with a better ratio of ingredients. Other than that... fabulous!

They're big, and they're made quickly. Granted, you could get them quicker and cheaper in the Mission, but if you're not in the Mission, you can't really get them quicker, now can you? I had a chicken mole burrito and a Mexican coke (since so many Americans like the Coke with cane sugar instead of corn syrup, why don't they make some here? After all, they've got 30 other types of Coke). She had the carnitas super tacos and a horchata. They bring chips out to your table. Ours seemed a bit stale, even though it was the first day, so maybe they brought them over from another store or something. The salsa was mighty tasty, sort of creamy and spicy, which helps the sticking-to-the-chip factor.\r\n\r\nLater that week I tried the chicken quesadilla.

They're made to order, with lots of crispy chips, not too greasy cheese, refried beans, and tons of yummy and garlicky roasted eggplant and zucchini. I'm not a fan of salsa, but if you wanted it, you'd get that too. (Should you not want nachos, the same dish can be had in burrito form.)\n\nDespite ordering a dish that is, essentially, chips with toppings, I always am served a dish of chips with their house salsa, which, though peppery, I enjoy. \n\nThere are only two things about both this location (and their Mission spot) that I dislike are: 1. There is not a whole lot of seating and a lot of it at this location is in the form of a bar; therefore, if you are hoping to go with a group, you had better hope you are lucky enough to score one of the few tables in front. 2. The proximity to USF means lots of hungry students who call their orders in ahead of time making what looks like a decent wait (based on the line in the store) much longer than that. \n\nOverall, though, Papalote is a super tasty restaurant that I am more than happy to travel to if I suddenly get a craving for those nachos.", "author": "Katie I."}

And he's not lying.\n\n\n Chilling out on an unusually hot Sunday, my pals and I were yearning for an overstuffed, beany, meaty, guacamole-infused treat. So off it was to Papalote, and as I entered and looked at the menu, my heart sank. No offense to the veggos out there, but vegan refried beans? Various healthy versions of tortillas? Red flags went up all over my little carnivorous mind, thinking there's no way this would hold up against a typical, meat juice-covered taqueria.\n\n\n I was happily proven wrong. I watched the grill in eager anticipation, all the while scooping up as much of their bright orange salsa as I could shovel in my mouth. It's no ordinary salsa, it's like crack salsa! Our orders then arrived, and we shared everything to get a good taste for the food. The vegetarian bean-rice-cheese burrito was surprisingly good. The vegan black refried beans were easily some of the best frijoles I've ever had. The carne asada was cooked to perfection. The guacamole had huge chunks of fresh avocado in it. The chili verde was tasty, if a bit dry. Even the vegan soyrizo tacos that my friend ordered on a lark were delicious, if a little watery.\n\n\n In fact, the only bit of whinging that drags a star off the rating is that the tacos are presented in single-tortilla fashion, inducing premature taco meltdown. Sorely disappointed by the taco offense, I slurped at my cane sugar Mexican coke to comfort myself.\n\n\n Highly recommended, but stick to the burritos. With a traditional flour tortilla, thankyouverymuch.", "author": "Omid T."}

It's made from sugar and not corn syrup, which is how it should be.\n\nThis place does do it for me in terms of SALSA.  They make it sort of, how do you say?, creamy I guess!

Too much rice and beans, and the chicken was stuck on one side of the burrito with the cheese so half of the eating only tasted like rice and beans. The chips are just eh, I prefer homemade. For 10 bucks you don't need to be all chincy with the toppings.\nAll in all, way better than Gordos but if I'm going out of my way La Taqueria totally wins on the price.", "author": "Lisa B."}

You can choose from a zucchini/eggplant combo or potato/carrot/mushroom, or if you don't like your veggies mixed together you can just add one.\nThe only downside is that my burrito cost $8.00, but that's because I'm greedy and had to stuff it with everything imaginable.

When I finally got home and ate the burrito, the salsa wasn't too hot but it was very flavorful. The carne was a little overdone for my taste, I usually like it a little more juicy. The tortilla was grilled perfectly, and the pinto beans and rice worked well. The burrito also wasn't buried in pico de gallo, which was much appreciated.\n\nOverall this was by far the best burrito I've had in SF since I moved up here and I'll be going back and ordering more when I need my fix.", "author": "Bryan Z."}

I saw the Throwdown episode and was really jones-in for the triple threat burrito (steak, prawn, chicken) but when I got there I saw it was 20 dollars. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I might as well drive to San Jose, go to Iguanas and get the 5lb burrito for 15!!! Talk about a rip off. Does anyone even order that? I got a super carne asada burrito which came out to be an expensive 10 dollars AND bottled pop so you have to pay for more. It feels like these people got arrogant that they got on the food network so they really cheap out and make you pay more than you would at Farolito or Gordos. The burrito was okay. They grill the tortilla which Gordos doesn't do and that was a plus, but wasn't good enough to convert me. I'll stick with gordos. Speaking of that, I'm going to go get one now!\n\nBy the way-the salsa for their chips is REALLY good. It must have sour cream in it because it is thick. Put that on Gordos instead of the chile verde please!!!!", "author": "Patrick M."}

How disappointing! I had never been to the location on Fulton but it is the closest one to my house. OH GOSH! the moment we walked in we were greeted by the bussing station full of dirty dishes and garbage and the strongest smell of pinesol!! ush! Strong smell of pinesol means dirty restroom in my book! Disgusting! The entire place was dirty and cramped! I was stunned!! I know the owners very well and was so suprised to find such a mess at this new location! There were 4-5 people behind the dirty counter and not one could move and go clean the tables! wow! \n\nI ordered a marinated tofu burrito and my boyfriend ordered a simple shrimp burrito. Disappointed again! The guacamole on my burrito was sour which means it had been sitting un-refrigerated for way too long.. ugh just the thought makes my stomach turn. And the tofu was certainly not marinated. HOW DISAPPOINTED!! I paid $20.00 for 2 burritos!!!!\n\nOne star because i love the salsa. Nothing else.

I was starving. I was feeling a burrito. I live in the Richmond, so not exactly burrito heaven. The two Chipotles were too far. But then I remembered that I had read some good reviews about Papalote on Yelp. And it was a hop, skip and a jump down good ol' Fulton. So I decided to go for it. \n\nReasons why I feel good about Papalote:\n1. Papalote had a parking garage across the street, so I did not have to experience massive frustration mixed with starvation. \n2. I am vegetarian, and Papalote decided to show some love by serving marinated tofu, soyrizo, wheat tortillas, and all three bean choices were veggie. \n3. I thought the employees were friendly. \n4. For some reason I thought I was going to walk to into a restaurant with a bunch of hipsters eating burritos, but it was not so, and I had a lovely time eating my burrito solo at their long burrito counter. \n5. They serve chips and salsa with your food. I am usually not crazy about chips but I really liked their salsa! I ended up eating it in my burrito and then eating just enough chips afterwards to make sure I finished it off. \n6. Bottom line foodwise: I had a marinated tofu burrito with black beans, wheat tortilla and cheese and guac. Melty cheese + somewhat crispy/soft wheat tortilla = happy camper. \n\nThe only thing I would have improved would be for Papalote to have a bigger space. They are so popular, it would be great if they had more room. But I will definitely be back!", "author": "Libbi K."}

The Mexican restaurants in the bay need to learn that fresh tortilla chips make all the difference, as does fresh salsa. When all other flavor is lacking, this might be the one saving entity.

You cannot get two different kinds for an order, even if they're the same price.  They are served in a white corn tortilla, with green lettuce (not iceberg) and fresh tomato salsa.  The cheapest would be rice and beans for $3 (I don't know why anyone would want that) to $5.95 for pescado... glorious fish sauteed in white wine and butter. \n\nYou get your own bowl of freshly fried/toasted corn chips with a small bowl of spicy blended salsa.  Very good.  Their horchata was great to mute the capsaicin effects in my mouth.\n\nI had the carne asada and pescado... so 4 tacos total (I gave away one carne asada to my coworker and just ate the fish filling of the 2nd pescado taco).  They store and get the fresh meats from these 4 small drawers underneath the grill... when they pull it out, they reminded me of those morgue drawers for da dead bodies.  I guess it's the same concept because the meats are from the dead bodies of the animals.  They even put a small scoop of salad on the side (chopped oranges with jicama, topped with a slice of radish), which was actually lovely.  I told them to hold the lettuce for my carne asada taco.. the beef chunks were a bit too big, but the meat quality was good and it was fairly seasoned, so it had some flavor.  The pescado taco they have here beats out Rubio's and El Castillito's.... which is a pretty big deal for me to say because I love the fish tacos at both locations... it's okay.. I just love Papalote's more.\n\nMy friends ordered the vegan soyrizo taco and a grilled veggie (zucchini and eggplant) quesadilla, to which she had them add some soyrizo..... that quesadilla was what secured the 4th star for this place.  I had a small bite of that fantastic and creative combination of roasted eggplant and zucchini... plus soyrizo.... plus the queso... ahhhh I wanted more but I had to finish my tacos.  =S\n\nIt's great that they have vegan and vegetarian options, the prices are very reasonable, and you can customize your orders to your taste.  They serve soda with a free refill, gringo cerveza (domestic and imported) as well as the Mexican kind.\n\n(checkit.. it's nextdoor to a karaoke joint...but that's a whole 'nuther review)", "author": "Grace M."}

The jicama in the taco was a nice touch, but can my little teeny weeny little thing of salsa get ANY and I say ANY smaller? WTF? + if you want more they charger you .50 for literally a tiny little metal cup which basically is the equivalent to a few tablespoons at the most. their salsa is not the traditional salsa, its almost creamy like. It is good, but at that rate you might as well as sell it for crack its so damn expensive. I mean come on, food cost to ratio is not even there. ridiculous!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-09-27", "description": "WARNING: Please read this review before going to Papalote's. Worst restaurant experience ever.\n\nI went last week for the first time expecting to love it. I'm a big fan of El Farolito (which I understand Papalote's is *not*), but I was prepared for something my friends described as a little \"healthier\" and \"fresher.\" When we arrived, my boyfriend was seriously put off by the lack of carnitas, but I had heard good things about the carne asada. I had also heard that the black refried beans were fantastic, so even though I don't like beans, I ordered them on the side along with a super carne asada burrito.\n\nMy burrito arrived, poorly wrapped, dangerous close to a puddle of gooey, liquidly bean substance. I cleaned off any bean contamination and started eating. I soon found that there was no guacamole. I told the waiter, who was bring food for someone else in my party,  that I had ordered a super burrito but there was no guac (I think there was also no cheese & crema, other features of the super, but I wasn't sure). He asked for my check number to verify if I had indeed ordered a super burrito. I was part of a large party and although I remembered our check number \"range\" (17-22), I didn't remember my own number. I told him I'd ordered the beans on the side and he went to the kitchen to check the order. When he came back, he said they \"needed to check.\" I thought he meant they needed *the* check, and I repeated that I didn't have it. He said no, they had to TAKE MY HALF-EATEN BURRITO BACK TO THE KITCHEN, to check if there was guacamole in it, because they DIDN'T BELIEVE ME. I was dumbfounded, as were the others in my party. We asked if he was serious; he was. But there was nothing I could do if I wanted guac, so I sent it back. \n\nWhen my burrito returned, it had been opened and poorly re-rolled, plopped down in the bean puddle, and a teaspoon of guac had been added to the side of the plate. I scraped the beans off the tortilla and finished eating because I was hungry, rationing my small bit of guac for the remaining meal. \n\nNeedless to say, I will not be returning here. I have never had such a horrible experience in a restaurant in my entire life.\n\n(And about the food: it was mediocre. Gordo's is even better, and El Farolito blows them all out of the water. And the beans were disgusting-- even for a bean dip, they should have been thicker, and more flavorful.)", "author": "Celine P."}

The bean and cheese dip had hardly any cheese taste whatsoever, the chips were extremely thick and tasted like they were a few days old, the borritos were flat tasting as were the tacos. There are so many Mexican food restaurants in San Francisco that are very tasty, but this is definitely not one of them. They do not even have ice tea, as the drink selection is very limited.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-02-22", "description": "So, I'll just go ahead and admit it. I'm a pretty simple girl. I like pretty dresses. My favorite food is fish. I LOVE my husband, I truly believe honesty is the best policy and that we should all practice random acts of kindness. We should all believe in love above all things (and love whoever we want to love without judgment) and we should all be nice to each other. There's really no need to cut in front of people in line at the grocery store or cut people off in traffic just because you think your destination is more important than someone else's. There's no need to wash your hands in the restaurant bathroom and then throw your used paper towels on the floor instead of the garbage can and there is certainly no need to put chewing gum in someone else's plants. So let's all be nicer to each other okay? Because, before we all go out to the park and gather around our \"Loving Circle\", hold hands, and sing \"He's Got the Whole World . . .\" let me tell you of my latest experience at Papalote. \n I was hungry. It was lunch time. Burritos are good. Somehow, burritos have gotten expensive, however. I was in line at Papalote and I was craving their prawn burrito. I wanted to make my burrito a super but as I was searching through my pockets, I realized that I might not have enough cash on me. I dug deep and found $8.25. That should be enough, right? If there was no tax, I was golden. Before ordering the burrito, I wanted to be sure I had enough so I asked the woman behind the counter what the price of the super prawn burrito would be. She told me it would be $8.61. My face fell a little but I had to giggle and mention I didn't have enough for that but I would choose something else. Then, the girl in line in front of me turns to me and says, \n \"I have some extra change if you'd like.\" She smiled sweetly at me and started digging through her purse. I had never seen this girl in my life and she was offering her change to me! I was touched but I felt a bit embarrassed about accepting money from a stranger for my lunch so I thanked her and assured her that while I appreciated the offer, I could totally choose an alternate burrito. Then, the woman behind the counter asks me how much money I have. Again, I'm a bit embarrassed but I confess to having only $8.25. I then try to assure her that I'm all right with modifying my order. Then she  gives me a big ol smile and says. \"It's okay. For you, it's okay. $8.25 is enough.\"  Since, unfortunately, I find it rare that people do actually perform random acts of kindness, I was a bit surprised and even a little more embarrassed. I didn't want to be causing trouble but here I have these two total strangers offering me help with my lunch. I giggle nervously again and thank them both again but (a little weakly) try to insist that it's all right. The girl in line smiles at me again and says, \"Between us, we're going to make sure you get that prawn burrito that you want!\" We all share a laugh and I finally accept the offer to pay $8.25 for the burrito that should have cost $8.61. \n Now, I do realize that it was only a $.36 difference, but to have those women offering me their help was super cool. It made me feel happy and it was such a simple gesture. They were just nice because they wanted to be nice. I like nice people. We all should be nicer people. It makes a difference. \n\nAnd that is my story. Warm and fuzzy. Rated G. Fun for the whole family.", "author": "Nuvia C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-01-21", "description": "First off, let me explain the one star rating. I have been a loyal Papalote customer since its opening during my early years of college. Along with my best friend, I would frequent Papalote on a weekly basis. We walked into the restaurant earlier this week, ordered our usual dishes, and were surprised when the employee at the register informed us that the prices had increased. Although surprised, because we had recalled a recent price increase, we didn't question the news until we realized that the increase wasn't just a minor one. I went from paying roughly $8.75 for a chicken burrito super to slightly over $10 (close to a 15% increase). Upon questioning, the employee's initial response was that the nearby lounge, one store down, was closing? OK, sad, but I never went there and didn't exactly frequent it on a regular basis. Back to the point,  I'm still not exactly sure what relevance that had to my initial question. We continued to ask the reasoning behind the sudden price increase when another employee informed us that their meat supplier had increased their prices, and that that we should keep in mind that the ingredients served are \"organic.\" Although we understand that the cost of living, working, and maintaining a profitable business in SF is higher than most areas, paying over $10 for just a burrito is insane. (Especially since recently we have been getting about 7 chips in each bag with our orders, but thats another issue). If you add a drink to this or even pick up the tab for a friend/significant other, you're out $25 easily. To sum it up: Papalote went from being an awesome Mexican restaurant at an expensive (for mexican food), but reasonable price, to an overpriced, very recently overstaffed Mexican restaurant. Same food, same service, much higher prices (less chips too, remember). I'll miss this place, but am certainly on the hunt to find the next best Mexican place with reasonable pricing.", "author": "Sean S."}

Sue-C-OH. This place was dirtier than my old freshman dorm room in Phelan building at USF. My lover and I walked in to this carbon monoxide haven and found  Two \"gueras\" (blonde haired women) burrito order takers  gossiping and seemed to care less about who over heard. One did stop while we placed the order, the other continued. \n \nOn to the food...\n\nThe famous salsa they were once known for is no longer. It is now the tomato soup concoction they sell in jars as Salsa. The jar stuff NEVER tasted like the real thing so I guess they now just serve their jar stuff. Hot mess in a jar, and not in a good way, but a bad way like a \"hot tranny mess\". No self respecting Mexicano would consider this an alternative for anything. \n\nPapalote (kite), I want to cut your string and let the wind take you faaaaaar away to Chard-Dry Land! Your burritos are flavor-less. What did I end up eating!? A char burrito? The chicken was dryer than a cup of sand from the Sahara desert in drought season and burnt that all i tasted was the taste of burnt chicken. No flavor, no seasoning, nothing. Just charbroiled nothingness in my burrito. Could of well been a charbroiled piece of carboard!!!  Your pinche tortilla was more like a tostada, crunchy and toasted, learn from other places an steam them!. The beans, well the beans were pinto and unappetizing, they needed some salt. Y la salsa bandera? (pico de gallo) was soggy and once again, with no flavor. It was more like chopped up old tomato and wilted cilantro. The guacamole? well I'd rather not go there but GUACALA, I have to!!! Was the guacamole in my burrito from a 5 pound tub being sold at costco? Because it sured as hell tasted like it!

BUT! Instead of going there a second time, we instead ventured to....Papalote _II_!!!!\n\nThis review is mainly a comparison to the original Papalote. So consider this as almost an addendum to my review of the original location.\n\nWe stopped by P2 (as I will hereby refer to it as) on the way to the Kabuki. Partly because it was closer than P1, but also to find out how the two places stack up. Well, fret not, because P2's food is just as good! For the sake of science, I ordered the same meal that i consumed less than 24 hours earlier. Chicken mole super burrito and a Coke. Well the burrito was spot-on, in typical Papalote fashion, even if they were a little stingier than normal with the jicama side-garnish-stuff. My dining compatriots were no less satisfied than I was with P2's relative quality. The one area I feel that P2 falls short of P1 is in the size & layout of the restaurant. There are maybe three tall tables crowded together in the front, and the only other seating is a long counter opposite the the kitchen/ordering area. So the place is definitely more suited for take-out or solo dining, rather than eating with friends. I do feel however, that it is located in a nicer area than P1, so we'll call it a wash.\n\nFret not, fans, Papalote's second location stays on par with the original.", "author": "Matt C."}

They even use chicken breast (can't figure out how they make it orange).  Papalote you could do no wrong.  Even when I found out you had \"buy 10 get one free\" cards and I had been eating there for months and you never gave me one thereby robbing me of a free burrito, I still forgave you.  But Papalote I think I need a break and its not me its you.  I'm sick of being charged for extra salsa when I'm a regular customer and you all probably laugh at me whenever I order, wondering why the hell does she eat here so much.  Lately your burritos have been loosely wrapped and with a lot of hard extra tortilla.  Your salsa, that used to taste like magic, is now craptastic.  Sometimes its so hot it burns my mouth and last night it tasted like sweet & sour sauce.  Not a good burrito flavor.  I have a halfway filled card right now, but I think its about time I started that diet I was thinking about...", "author": "Isi C."}

The WORST burrito I have ever had.  I have lived in SF for 40yrs. and have tried many Mexican places.  THE ABSOLUTE WORSE!!! I paid $22 for 1 awful Triple Threat burrito.  It was dry, tasted burnt and such a disappointment.  I wonder what was in the burrito made for Throw Down.  Could not have been the same ingredients as in the one that I purchased!!  I am beginning to wonder about the restaurants featured on Food Network.  I tried a BBQ joint in Pacifica featured on Food Net work....simply awful!!  The ribs bones were as large as dinasaur bones!!  and had no BBQ smoke flavor.  Totally BLAND!! Do these Food Network personnel know good food?!  I am done, no more restaurants will I try in SF featured on Food Network.  I cook better food than this mess!!  The Food Network owes me $22!!!!!  The one good thing I can say is that the tortilla it was wrapped in was really good!!  Anyone that gives this restaurant more that one star does not know good food. Oh, it is clean and well lighted.  It is too expensive for the mess you get.!!", "author": "PATRICE B."}

I'd been hearing good stuff about this place for awhile and when I went to Poleng the other night, I realized Papalotes was right next door.  I went during the lunch hour and it wasn't crowded and although the barstool seating faces a wall, I had tunnel-vision like focus on my burrito, so the view really didn't matter.  I had a burritto...shrimp and chicken so I could taste both meats and boy was it good.  The burrito comes with rice, beans (I tried the black refried), salsa, and meat  (unless you get it veggie) all wrapped in a grilled flaky tortilla crust.  The salsa was great.  You could tell the tomatoes had been marinating in something all night and there wasn't a lot of cilantro, which was an automatic A+ in my book.  The meat was well flavored and the rice and beans together....well lets just say when I got to the end of the burrito and ran out of meat, I still couldn't stop eating.  Very friendly people working in the kitchen who greeted me and made a point to say goodbye (maybe cause it wasn't really busy...I dunno) and the prices were hella cheap for the portions.  $6.95 for a regular chicken burrito and (I got shrimp too so an extra $3.50 for me).

The tortilla is always crispy and fresh, and the meat is tasty without being mysterious or of questionable quality, like many of the places around the Mission. I have to admit though, sometimes the mystery is half the fun, and it often seems to add to the unique flavor of a burrito, so some might find the Papalote burrito a bit bland. Luckily, their salsa is fantastic and makes up for it all (it goes well on pizza too). Try the chicken mole.", "author": "Matt C."}

I ordered the carne asada burrito (super).  While waiting I noticed they cook and chop the piece of meat for your order right as they are ready to put it in the warm tortilla. No mass cooking, chopping and warming stations like in many Mission District taquerias.  The slight toasting on the outside of the tortilla gave it a nice texture to bite into and the first thing I noticed was the absolutely fresh taste of the salsa.  This is a well-made burrito with each bite giving a great mix of flavors. The meat was tender and flavorful, the beans stood up and said \"present\" and the cheese was just the right amount of gooey goodness.  This place has taken the pedestrian taqueria fare that you find in the Mission and made it fresh and yummy.  The fresa was delicious, too.

Then tells me no I did not order super and dismisses me.  Um hello I still wanted some stuff for my burrito.  I sit back down and then think no I would like a little sour cream so I go back up, \"what?\" he barked.  I politely told him I would be happy to purchase some sour cream, that was gonna be a dollar.  Mind you upgrading to a super is only 99 cents and you get all sorts of things.
