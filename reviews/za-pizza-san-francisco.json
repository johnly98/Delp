After moving to the neighborhood recently, this has become a near weekly visited spot for me. They have some pies you can order, and also slices of Cheese, Pep, and then 2 specials of the day, one of which usually has meet, one does not. I have never been disappointed by a slice, or the extremely personal service.\n\nZa is small, with about 6-8 barstools and 4-5 tables, so be aware of that. I should also note that is it not the gourmet, small, brick over pizza, but deliciously greasy giant slices. I will definitely be back.", "author": "Megan L."}

I like that they add some no frills flair to this neighborhood filled with hoity toity french, italian, and spanish restaurants. \n\nZa won't break the bank and for reals they have some of the best pizza in the city. I don't know how many times I've eaten at a fancy pizza place only to be disappointed because they literally just toss salad onto your pizza and charge you an arm and a leg. Za does pizza the right way at least!\n\nMy favorite is the potato pesto. Oh my goodness. I didn't know what heaven was until I met you. \n\nThe mash up of potato with pesto and cheese on a crunchy yet soft and perfectly thinned crush is just magnificent. You have to really love potato to enjoy this but the great thing is the spuds aren't overwhelming at they're sliced thin and come out of the oven perfectly soft and chewy and melt in your mouth. I mean c'mon, how can you not love this combination? \n\nGiving this place 5 stars despite the wait sometimes and lack of seating. It's well worth it though. I would grab a slice to-go and walk eating. I wish they had the potato pesto on the per slice option but it doesn't seem like they do. \n\nI could eat a whole potesto pie if I was left to my own devices.", "author": "Connie M."}

INSANELY good. \n\nThis place is small and crowded and I would never expect good service here, but they do that just like they do their pizza, unexpectedly excellent!\n\nThey have four tables and a bar so this place fills up fast.  Yet when I came here, I was asked if I had been helped by no less than four people. One waiter worked all of the tables and was on top of his game despite the workload.\n\nThis place doesn't played game when it comes to pizza. The room left over?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-04-21", "description": "There's places that are highly reviewed by a gazillion people on Yelp because they're destination spots, + then there's places with identical acclaim because they're awesome local favorites. Za Pizza--a small hole-in-the-wall shop https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za-pizza-san-francisco?select=M4d4MDRQ9qCzNqsRfPrOfA hidden between a dog groomer, Pilates studio, + a wedding dress boutique in Russian Hill--is one of the latter. \n\nI stop in for pizza by the slice for lunch on occasion because it's only $4.75 per slice. It's absolutely a steal of a deal as the slices are pretty huge + the guys here are heavy handed with the toppings. When I say huge, I mean bigger than the plate https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za-pizza-san-francisco?select=cAa8afCdwHlsMV0RoJf5WA. Nowhere else in this area can you get such a quick, hearty lunch (or dinner) for under $5!   \n\nThe trick to their efficiency is their limited menu of only 4 different kinds of pizzas daily: Cheese, Pepperoni, a meat variety + a veggie variety. The 4 options are written on a board at the register, + then they warm up your choice in a matter of minutes. To be honest, I don't particularly have a favorite type of pizza here as I'm usually content with whichever meat or veggie selection fits my fancy at the moment. It would be difficult to have a favorite anyways as the options are always different + Za doesn't post their daily menu on a website or social media as far as I know. Unfortunately slices cannot be customized, but I suppose that's what keeps them quick. I have yet to be disappointed though as the ingredients are fresh + the crust is always nicely crispy. On my most recent visit this week, I was pretty happy with my slice of Sweet Treat (Italian sausage, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomato + basil) https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za-pizza-san-francisco?select=kNpsT3hmTMbeSFgziCPaew.\n\nIf you're looking to get a whole pizza, check the website to see the 7 specialty pizzas that they have available for ordering ($23.30 medium, $28.35 large) or you can customize your own out of a selection of 22 toppings. \n\nInterior seating https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za-pizza-san-francisco?select=oZIU8xJgi4i3W4TCWf7kAg is limited to a few tables inside + stools at the bar so this isn't the type of place you'd stay to hang out a long while in. Anchor Steam is always on tap along with a couple other options + there's a TV usually playing a sports game up in the corner. I've seen a few families here + the lovely artwork covering the walls is an overwhelmingly apparent local stamp of approval. If it's a nice day out, sometimes they'll have a small table out on the sidewalk, or the Hyde + Vallejo mini-park (https://www.yelp.com/biz/hyde-vallejo-mini-park-san-francisco) a block away has a few benches you can sit at. Afterwards, if you're jonesing for something sweet, there's plenty of neighbors to hit the spot; Swensons old fashioned ice cream, Loving Cup froyo/rice pudding, Lush gelato, Basik Cafe acai bowls, Batter bakery, Teaspoon boba/shaved ice + The Candy Shop gourmet candies are all within walking distance. \n\nParking in the area isn't too bad during the day but pretty impossible in the evenings. They deliver within a close radius as well.", "author": "Janelle Q."}

The walls are plastered with various drawings of creative pizza, I'm assuming done by customers.  These provided something fun to look at while waiting for our food to come out.  They also had a tv with football on so that's convenient if you want to catch a game too.  You can get pizza by the slice in traditional flavors or their specials for the day.  They also have Medium or Large pizzas made to order.  We got a large pizza to go and a beer to wait.  I appreciate when a restaurant will do half and half even with different sauces and this place was accommodating.  We did a half Scaliano and half Salvador Dali.

Ordered a pizza over the phone; price on the website read $28.35.  When I went to pick up the pizza, I was told that the price was $32 and over $34 with tax.

He refused to honor the online price without consulting a manager (who of course wasn't present) and told us that we were welcome to leave the pizza.\n\nI cannot support a business that lacks any semblance of a customer service orientation.

If he had to eat one food the rest of his life it would be pizza. He loves more of a New York pizza, and in his eyes any pizza is pizza worth eating, but doesn't see a ton of value in more of a Neapolitan style pizza over others. He also really likes Za Pizza and would probably give them a 4. \n\nI also love pizza, but to me it's more of a treat and I want a really good frickin Pizza if I'm going to eat it. I love a good Neapolitan style pizza with a lighter flavor. I do not enjoy Za Pizza because it's too hefty and heavy handed on flavors. But I still eat it on occasion because I love him, even if I most definitely do not love their pizza. I would probably give them a 2 and feel really bad about it because they are super nice. \n\nHope this helps!", "author": "Ally S."}

It was very crowded when I came, and was pretty small as well. There isn't much room for people. It's not the cleanest place either. We were waiting on this table and someone came over to clean it up. As we sat down I realized that I had to clean up the table a little bit myself because there was some oil and crumbs and stuff like that. Not a huge deal but it needed to be noted. The pizza itself was a little above average. Both me and my date got the bluto, and it was slightly above average. Nothing from that pizza jumped out at me and wowed me. It good, and I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the pizza. But overall, nothing was too memorable from this place. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. \n\nBottom line: If you're in the area and you like pizza.. Check it out. But otherwise, don't go out of your way for this place.", "author": "Derek W."}

I've heard awesome things about it and the reviews are all wonderful. Disclaimer: This review is not about the food itself cause the pizza is DAMN delicious. This review is about the service I experienced - particularly from one employee. \n\nIt's a Friday and it's dinnertime -obviously it's a busy time and it's made very apparent that it is busy when we walk in. We come in and we start talking to a couple costumers/locals about the neighborhood, etc. I order a Specialty slice to go and shortly after my friend orders a couple more slices and some beers while we wait. We sit and drink our beers and chat with some people. I am in no rush about my order, as I am just chilling with my beer and having a good conversation. My friend who ordered after me receives his two slices (about 30 minutes after ordering) and aforementioned employee says, \"We've run out of the Specialty pizza but it's coming up,\" so we wait for my slice a little longer. Again, I'm in no rush so it's fine. However, I begin to see people coming in and getting the same slice of pizza to go, after only waiting about ten minutes. It's when I see families who have come in long after me receiving ENTIRE pizzas when I go up to the register and ask how much longer it would be for my slice, which at this point as been an almost hour wait. No one responds to my questions- but I do see a slice placed into the oven to be warmed up and one of the cooks responds jokingly, \"You'll have to wait another hour.\" I walk back to my friends, confused but hopeful that my slice is on its way. The employee comes up to me and says, \"No one took your order.\" No apologies, nothing, and walks away after I stated that he in fact took my order and my friend's order as well. I have my receipt out ready to show him when he comes back with my slice and proceeds to say, \"You shouldn't wait an hour before telling us that you're waiting\" and shoves my pizza into a bag. I, shocked, respond, \"I was being polite and I knew you guys were busy so I didn't say anything.\" I've worked in the food industry before, I know how it goes when it's busy and how awful it is to get complaints from customers during those time so I make it a point never to be the person to complain, no matter how long the wait is. To point out, I never did complain - just simply inquired how long it would be. He insincerely apologizes and as we are walking out, I can hear him complaining about me loudly to the other employees. I, somehow leave the place feeling bad about the entire situation. \n\nI am just so disappointed with my experience here. I was really looking forward to having this be my neighborhood pizza joint but I have no desire to step foot back in there. I am especially disappointed because the pizza is sooo good and the atmosphere is awesome. Honestly, if I had gotten a sincere apology or had not felt like I had made the mistake in this situation, then I would not be writing this review. In fact, I have never written a Yelp review before but this entire experience has made me feel awful that I felt it was needed.

Fortunately Za doesn't feel particularly unhealthy so it's a (mostly) guilt-free indulgence, which is more than I can say for other pizza joints.\n\nMy boyfriend is in love with the Scaliano - It's a solid pizza that's unlike other pizzas I've tried. The cornmeal crust is my favorite part. The garlic is fresh, the spicy sausage is high quality, the tomatoes are juicy, and the scallions keep the flavor palette interesting. We tried adding pepperoni once but it was greasy and distracted from the garlic/tomatoes/scallions. Another time we asked for half Scaliano/Da Vinci and we both agreed the Scaliano was better. So now we keep it simple: Large Scaliano, straight up. It feeds us twice and reheats in the oven really well. They don't charge for delivery (SWEET!) and it always arrives in under an hour. \n\nPro-tip: The menu they attach to the pizza box has a coupon so save it for your next delivery!

I've had both exceptionally good service and exceptionally bad service. Once, I came here with family who were visiting from out of town. The servers and chefs were exceedingly kind and friendly.

In contrast: A few weeks ago I went here with a friend one evening. It was well before closing time, but the servers were absolute jerks. My friend and I each ordered a slice of pizza \"for here\", and they gave us the slices in a pizza box and told us to \"get out\". I asked why--and they said they were closing.

Sometimes there is a bit much corn meal/semolina on the bottom, but I'm not so bothered by it. The salads are pretty good too, if you're looking for a way to eat a bit less pizza.

When I ate my own crust it was sort of a tasteless dough that needed a lot of ranch. Which is a shame. \n\nThe crust is like the end of a movie, it has to be as good as the opening scene. \n\nSize: 10/10 Massive\n\nPrice: At $4.50 a slice it's expensive imo. Can't beat NYC dollar slices. \n\nService: Mixed. \nThese people hung up on me before when I called to place an order. Because I mentioned how they kept me waiting for 10mins. \n\nBuzz: Cool spot on Hyde, local style, bar, napkin art.\n\nOverall, myself and my gf give it a 6. Better than average.", "author": "David L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-07-28", "description": "My husband and I are in SF on holiday for five days and we went to Za our first night here on a whim because it was close. We've now been there twice - so far.  It's not one of those places that you have to go to because it's a tourist trap. They just do amazing pizza.\n\nBack home in England we have a friend called G (that isn't a pseudonym to protect his identity, we actually call him G). G plays bass in a band, and is powerfully gregarious. Every weekend he's doing something weird in Shoreditch or Lambeth. He's constantly backstage at various different music festivals; we know not how. He's been in Bruce Dickinson's house and dates disproportionately attractive women (mostly from the Baltic states, although this is not on purpose: it just happens to him).  Everyone who works in Za is a cleaner, Californian version of G. \n\nFour out of five of them at any one time will be wearing a baseball cap (in both forwards and backwards varieties); the fifth will be wearing a baseball tee. You get the impression that when they turn up at a house party they bring more cans than they drink and will either have on them - or know someone who can get - good weed. They all casually skate - Vans over Converse - and probably met Billie Joe Armstrong once but think he's a tosser. The entire time you're their they'll all be rushing about like blue arsed flies and doing several things at once, these including: taking orders for both in house and takeaway pizza; keeping an eye on who got there first and has been waiting for seats in the tiny venue longest; answering the phone and explaining the wait for delivery is the same as it was when the caller rang five minutes ago; manning the tiny bar and drawing pints over one another on opposite taps; checking on the bin lid sized pizzas in the oven; washing their hands; bussing tables; pausing to check the baseball on the TV and, one assumes, be slightly surprised at their own pizza-based acuity. There's a beautifully assumptive level of service: \"Hey man, you need another beer!\" and you realise, shit, I do need another beer! Sign me up, you probably-bearded dude.\n\nYour pizza will arrive about half way down the first beer, depending on the size and quantity of pizza ordered. The individual slices are just larger than an average person's head. They're thin, loaded with toppings, but not soggy, and they're pretty reasonably priced too (a comparable slice place in London is a fiver a slice which, depending on how far off a cliff the pound is today, is now probably five bucks too, and Za's pizza is way better). \n\nIf you're the kind of person who appreciates an atmosphere that someone could, at any point, decide to lock the doors and turn it into a mellow all nighter, where you won't be judged for sticking to cola but where nobody, under any circumstances, will be allowed to play Wonderwall on an acoustic in the corner, and if, above all else, you like really really good pizza, then you need to visit Za. If you deduct points from restaurants for not having proper cloth serviettes folded into the shape of two birds of paradise fucking, then you probably won't like Za, but you shouldn't be allowed to enjoy pizza either, you joyless git.", "author": "Alice B."}

We walked in with our 3 kids and a gentleman immediately walked up to us and brought over a high chair for the baby. When he saw that we pulled out our cell phones (guilty!) to distract the kids when they got a little antsy while waiting for the pizza (ordered a whole pie, didn't even take long), he quickly brought over some sheets of paper and markers for the 3 of them and the kiddos felt so special when he hung the drawings up. I can't say enough about how awesome this guy was. He checked on us, chit chatted a bit, made us laugh, and just kept it moving, making sure every customer was taken care of.

They serve slices and whole pizzas. The staff was super friendly while seating us and our waiter was very helpful and pleasant. Pizza came out piping hot and was pretty delicious. They gave us hot plates to keep the pizza warm. \n\nCons: Prices are higher on their menu than Yelp's. No ranch. They had Franks and Siracha but both tasted funky. There was something sweet, maybe ketchup, added to the hot sauce. Apparently, one of the employees was rude when my friend brought our plates up.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-10-26", "description": "No idea how this place is 4 stars. Probably not enough New Yorkers chiming in. Za Pizza gets a solid 2 stars under middle of the road review. The pizza is ok, but nothing to write home about, and really really always underbaked and soft (although my wife likes it extra doughy like that). They're always busy and totally slammed every day during rush times, but I've come to the conclusion that it's really because they're the only gig in the nabe that has pizza and delivery of its type in Nob/Russian Hill, not because of the quality or stellar service. The customer service is weak sauce and has been for at least the past few years. I have NEVER had a smooth experience with it here and I always end up needing to eat dinner hangry having wasted time and money in the process because I forgot to order right after my last meal so that theirs would get there in time. \n\n2 stars especially for the delivery guys, or anyone you need to deal with over there in any customer service capacity. They are always rude, late, not willing to come upstairs to complete the delivery. Just the other day one arrived and called, I said there's a buzzer on the side of the door, and he proceeds to say he'll park the car and come up then promptly hangs up before I get to reply. I waited 20 minutes to hear from him again and he didn't answer our calls wondering where he was. If he didn't hang up so fast I could have said I'll just meet you downstairs... (I should add 95% of other delivery service drivers at any time of day figure out a way to park even in a driveway for 1 minute and come up, and when they can't I offer to come down). \n\nAnother instance of poor service -- a few months back the person on the phone we ordered from didn't ask cash or charge - then when we wanted to use a card upon arrival, the driver wouldn't give us our pizza. He tried to call the restaurant to run the card (couldn't get in touch with them because no one answered the phone multiple times, even for their own driver...) then said he had other deliveries to complete, took off pizza in hand, went back to his car, and didn't return for over 25 minutes!?! During which time we had to call the shop again and again to get through on the phone to make the charge. The person on the phone couldn't care less about the fact that we were appalled with this situation and blamed us for not making it clear we were going to use a card, when we weren't even asked. Equip your CS folks and drivers appropriately, it's 2015 in SF people. Take an imprint or run a Square, or have a phone line your drivers can call, problem solved.\n\nAlways add 30 minutes to any delivery estimate, minimum. They like to tell you 45min - 1 hour, but it really means an hour and a half at least. We've waited up to 2 hours on a one hour estimate for a delivery before, and ended up with cold Za. \n\nEvery time I order from this place I have to deal with something unprofessional, rude, and just plain annoying and stupid. Unacceptable in a market where there a a myriad of other options for food in one of the best cities for food in the country. I don't know how they stay in business with customer service like this. The only reason I agreed to order from them these last few times is because my wife likes the pizza so much, but we both agreed too many bad times and this was probably the end of Za for us. With so many options for businesses in any flavor in this city there is literally no reason to patronize someone or some business that makes you feel bad and wonder why you gave them money for a sub par experience. So many other more reputable places in this city make you feel great to do business with them.\n\nVictor's Pizza on Polk is WAY better quality and much better customer service and delivery.", "author": "Niall D."}

They are extremely nice - I sat down at the counter and began babbling at them about my history in the 'hood and how I'd always wanted to try them. They listened more than politely and made lots of suggestions. Somehow rather than just getting a slice I ended up ordering an entire pizza. The whole staff swung by at one point or another to ask me if I liked the pie. Loved the pie I did. The crust is not bready - it's crisp and just thick enough to hold up the toppings. You're best off folding the slice. The toppings are generous. I loved my custom tomato sauce / pesto topping with shrooms, and olives. Their generous amount of homemade pesto is out of this world.\n\nOne thing we did not desire was to eat this pizza cold. It might be good, but the toasty crispy crust was too good to not have again. we heated the slices in a cast iron pan, stove top with a little foil over them and walla. \n\nThank you Za for your hospitality and for the great pie.", "author": "Roxmarie M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-09-09", "description": "I have lived in the neighborhood for years now and often walk my dogs around the hood and while doing so, we pass the many restaurants that:\n\n1. I won't allow myself to SPLURGE on such extravagant dining; and \n2. I will not permit myself to indulge in excess fats/carbs, etc.  \n\nThere are two places on Hyde that fall under category 2 = Za Pizza and Swensen's Ice Cream Shop.  Many friends in the neighborhood praise both and are always astounded and question \"you've lived here this long and you've never tried ZA or Swensens?\"  \"You're missing out, you gotta try them.\"\n\nFinally, I decided to indulge and take a seat outside of Za's Pizza with my trusty BFF's (best fur friends).  Monday nights on Hyde Street are not as busy with tourists and diners eating out, so I figured tonight is the night, I am craving pizza, let's see what this place is about.\n\nWaiter - Attentive, very friendly, suggestive and helpful.  Service prompt and food  delivered with a smile.\n\nProblem is - I was NOT as impressed with Za's as my friends seem to be.\n\nProblem is, I consider myself a salad aficionado and always when dining out I order a salad, so when I inquired about a side salad, the garden veggie salad appeared to be the server's fave and not that of the Caesar.  \n\nFor a $7.00, I had high expectations.  I expected an abundance of LEAFY GREENS, tomatoes, mushrooms, red onions and sweet bell peppers.  What I got was disappointing; the so-called veggie salad consisted of mostly white and light green parts of the core of the lettuce and also added were a few cores.  YUK\u203c!  There were no visible leafs from the head of the lettuce.  There were however very few visible tomatoes and mushrooms, and quite a bit of red onion, red and green bell pepper.  \n\nWhere were the LEAFY GREENS that make up the majority of the salad?  I dunno, but they certainly didn't make it to my plate.  I should have sent it back, but the server was busy and I was hungry so I gave it try hoping the salad dressing would mask the core salad; I ended up feeding most of the white/light green parts to my bff, Ms. Emma who was ever so eager to help (she'll eat anything).  \n\nMy Monday Meat Lovers slice was questionable too, questionable in \"Where's the beef?\"  What meat I noticed was teeny tiny bits of meat sprinkled in one section of the slice.  I wouldn't call this a meat lover's slice and rather more like a cheese lover's slice.  I didn't detect anything else outstanding about the slice either (i.e., mushrooms, olives, etc.)  The sauce was definitely good and it took back to some of my favorite childhood memories; the pizza crust was incredibly thin which I kind of liked - in that the slice was NOT thick and overloaded with cheese and oil; I didn't feel guilty indulging in the carbs.\n\nWould I go back - yes!  The atmosphere was pleasant, warm and welcoming - service was friendly, suggestive and prompt.  However, when I do go back I'll be ordering a pie made my way - with lots of meat and a slightly thicker crust (but definitely NOT Chicago style).  And the salad - no thank you, I will pass.", "author": "Cris B."}

The owner was there every time I went and you can tell he loves his business and customers. It feels very homey and comfortable in there and it's a good escape from the chaos of San Francisco.

Set up is made for grab & go or a quick bite - seating is mostly on bar stools with 4 tables for groups. Service was efficient - we got waters quickly & our order was taken shortly thereafter. Combination pizza choices have fun names but are kept simple with a couple of items, no frills but with the quality of ingredients I have come to expect from SF establishments.  Thin crust cornmeal pizza stays crispy all the way through the meal. A friend and I split a medium a Da Vinci's Palette (red & green peppers, spicy sausage, onions).

In fact, the pizza from Za Pizza is a solid 4.5 stars, so maybe would have gotten a review.\n\nWell, it took the strangest, rudest sequence of events to get me to prompt my first 1 star review.\n\nTheir pizza is solid, as most have noted, but WOW the hard to believe sequence I just had with their delivery driver demanded a public announcement.\n\nThe delivery wait on a Friday was about an hour fifteen - no big deal, the place is popular.  And the guy on the phone, while curt and not so friendly as others have mentioned, was not a big deal to me.\n\nBut that delivery driver...\n\nWhen my buzzer rang, I did what I do for every other of the dozens of delivery places I order from - I buzzed the driver through the security gate, to walk a few steps to my door in our small outdoor courtyard.\n\nWhen I opened the door, he angrily shoved the pizza at me proclaiming that he had tried to call me on my cell phone and I didn't answer (movie was on, didn't hear the ring - I know, can you believe my gall?!).  He was literally writhing in anger.\n\nI asked if something was wrong with my buzzer? He said in a straight (and very angry face): 'we don't ring buzzers, we don't go to your door, we call you, you come outside'....UH, OKAY BUDDY, wait what - you don't ring buzzers or go to doors when delivering food?!?!?!\n\nPerhaps if this was a strange requirement of Za Pizza and truly Za Pizza only that you need to answer your phone, not the buzzer and walk to the street - that they might have wanted to mention this on the phone when ordering, or on the website - or anywhere?!\n\nYet still, I incredulously signed the receipt and STILL tipped him $3 and said thank you.  After that he actually said the following: 'I will never deliver here again and you are out of the delivery area anyway'. Hmmm, I'm in Pac Heights, they are next door in Russian Hill, and now I'm out of their delivery zone? And, I'm not looking for favors, had teh guy on the phone said I was out of the area, that would have been fine by me - except they had delivered to me 3-4 times in the last year - no problems with delivery area then.\n\nWait, because I missed a call and you actually had to ring a buzzer and wait 20 seconds while I tipped you, you now like to berate your customers?\n\nOut of principle, I would urge you all to seek your delivery pizza elsewhere, at least until the driver (in a gray Mini Cooper) is either fired or realizes he truly is miserable in his job and life in general and quits.\n\nOh, and you're comment about not delivering to me again...well, ZA, you sure don't need to worry about a call ever coming from me again.", "author": "Don D."}

I was looking for good pizza and found this place on yelp so I decided to make the drive from sacramento to check it out. It's a cute little place the staff is friendly and the pizza is delicious. They get fresh ingredients (at least some of them) from their local farmers market and I love when people support farm to fork.  The slices are bigger than Rays pizza in NYC. The only dissapointing thing is they don't make custom slices and this place isn't a traditional pizza parlor in that they keep several custom hot pies ready to serve slices. Still delicious big slices and fresh ingredients! They make their pies fresh to order and they keep cheese and pepperoni avaliable for slices. A full large pie is a lot of pizza and only 28 dollars plus tax. You will definitely fill up with a medium though.  Thanks guys!", "author": "Ryan S."}

Came across this local pizza joint. O-M-G this pizza is so flippin good! You think how can pizza especially by the slice be super good, but I'm telling you its kinda like gourmet pizza. I got a slice of Olive Oil (not sure why they name it this cuz theres more too it then olive oil) it has tomato, spinach, garlic, and feta. Then I got the side salad, the homemade basil vinaigrette is out of this world!!!! I love it so much. Now I also asked the guy for a side of ranch he looked at me kinda crazy, like oh your a ranch girl but I enjoy some ranch who cares. Anyways... he suggested the homemade honey mustard that they have instead and literally its so good I dreamt about it that night in my sleep.\n\nCOME HERE EAT HERE YELPERS AWESOME!!!", "author": "Jess O."}

I haven't gone to all the big pizza places around here, but I've been to several, and after some reflection, I do think I'd go with Za.\n\nKeep in mind the kind of pizza we're talking about: big, sloppy thin-crust slices of the kind you'd find at that hole-in-the-wall down the street. The kind of pizza you'll grab with a beer on a weeknight so you can settle down and watch the game. This isn't a delicate little Neapolitan pie served in a precious cafe atmosphere. If you want that, go to Delfina. (Or wherever.)\n\nAs a point of clarification, I enjoy the Delfina-style pizza as much as the next guy. It's just a different sort of experience. It's the sort of thing you'd go out with friends to have on a Saturday night. It's a special occasion. It's pretentious--but that's fine. It's good; it's tasty.\n\nBut Za is an unpretentious pizza. And ultimately, that's the kind of pizza I love most. I like my pizza big, sloppy, kinda greasy, and absolutely 100% delicious. That's what Za delivers. They do a great job.\n\nThat said, I should mention that I've had some kind of crummy customer service experiences here. These were mainly the first few times I came here, when I was under the impression that they supported the stand-around-and-wait-for-them-to-hand-your-pizza take-out model of service. I've since come to learn that things work better if you sit down and order something rather than just walk up to the register and ask them for a slice.

Yelp mobile app told me about this place nearby, so why not? \n\nWalked in. 3 stools at the bar open. done. Ordered a medium pizza half scaliano, half salvador dali. Ordered a couple beers while awaiting the pizza to be made and having our senses teased by the aroma of the other pizza's in this place. Definitely a casual joint with seating probably for only a total of 20 people inside. \n\nFirst Bite: HOLY CRAP. I knew this place had decent reviews, but I did not expect the pizza to taste this good. All the toppings tasted fresh. The crust was thin and deliciously packed with flavor. The sauce...flawless. I personally liked the Salvador Dali a little more than the Scaliano, but both were amazing. 2 and a half slices later, and I'm stuffed and satisfied. A great surprise for only about $21 total for the pizza.", "author": "Andrew S."}

They make the best thin crust in the city, and that is quite an accomplishment considering all of the competition. The one thing that I love about them is they offer a great vegetarian option in the Moma. But my favorite is the Hawaiian (Turkey Bacon) pizza.  Their daily specials are excellent as well, and their very generous with their portions.  Find yourself ordering one-size down from your normal pizza portions.

Just as I finished paying, two people left the bar so my fianc\u00e9 sat down (unbeknownst up me), and at the same time, I was handed the beer and two slices of our three-slice order, on plates.  I presumed he saw what was happening.  I asked the cashier/ bartender if the slices and beer were ours?  \"YES\".  A moment later I was yelled at by the cashier, manager and a waiter for taking the food m.  I tried to apologize about my mistake, but all I got from the cashier/ bartender was an irritated, \"Yeah, whatever.  It's not yours.\"  So I slunk over to my seat, and not two seconds after I sat down at the bar next to my fianc\u00e9, the irritated cashier/ bartender came over and now more irritated said, \"You told me you were taking to go\".   My fianc\u00e9 responded that he found these two seats and very politely asked if it was ok to stay after all.

The cheese to sauce ratio was perfect. The combo of spicy chorizo, tangy fresh garlic, and crisp fresh green onions was killer. This will be my go-to choice on return visits.\n\nThe potesto (a potato/garlic/pesto white pie) was also good but a liiiiiiittle on the dry side. A lot of very good pizza places struggle with their white pizzas, and unfortunately Za was no exception. It wasn't bad, but it needs work. The moisture from the potato kinda boxes you into a corner because it makes it hard to get a good crisp on the crust without overcooking the whole thing. For advice, give the folks at Basic Pizza in San Diego a call because they've got potato pizza down to a science!\n\nThe only other knock on Za is that the prices are really pushing the reasonable limits of pizza,  even for SF.

I'm torn between the two - and thankfully I didn't have to decide because we got it half an half. Two people and a medium pizza works really well.

I had a slice of their meat special, which seemed to have ground beef and jalapeno slices. The sauce wasn't spectacular, and I've definitely had more flavorful meat. The crust was stiff and tasted of raw flour, which is a sign of shoddy baker's work in my view. For thin crust, it's not thin enough or flavorful enough; good thin crust should have tangy sauce and have flavorful toppings.\n\nThe wait staff was friendly enough. I noticed the owner waive the checks of two foreign girls who only had fountain drinks. Kind of made me a little jealous.\n\nI think for a place that calls itself \"gourmet\", Za has a ways to go. Yes it's good for the price, and I may well go back for more since it's convenient to my location. But memorable? Nah, not really.

Their pizza tends to consist of thin crust with delicious melted cheese followed by your favorite topping. They cook it to perfection and if eaten fresh out the oven, the cheese will fall right off yet still be delicious. I usually order for pick up or delivery and under both circumstances they are very fast and effective.\n\nTheir very large pizza is to die for. I personally am an all time pepperoni pizza fanatic and i feel that it would be so wrong to never eat at least a slice of pepperoni from any pizza spot. Therefore, here i usually order a large pepperoni or a large half pepperoni, half broccoli pizza. Trust me, this is a good combination and the broccoli half is very delicious as well.

She introduced Za to me shortly after we started dating and I fell in love. Sure, the waitstaff had attitude. I didn't care. I'm from the East Coast and that comes part and parcel with all the best eats. I put up with it. When they did commiserate, the waitstaff was cool. The pizza was yummy but far from sublime. I didn't care. The ambiance, the za, and the company made it worth it. The not so subtle, but amusing jibing of Steve and Jose made it even more charming.\n\nThat was then. This is now. I have had exactly five burned pizza slices served to me in the last ten times at Za. Now the distant waitstaff is not charming, but degrading as I sit there and gnaw on slices that take five solid strokes to cut with a knife using all my force. I'm 6' 1\", 220 lbs and most nights lately Za's pizza bests my honest attempts at dissecting and digesting. Add to that the fact I noticed they pull the slices from some slab of overcooked pie they keep hidden under the counter, and I am ready to move on. Goat Hill and Little Star are WAAAAY better.\n\nI don't think it's a random happenstance that the pizza went down hill when the owner bought Escape from New York on Polk, for all these changes came to fruition when he merged what was once tasty Za with \"I only eat it when I'm drunk Escape from New York.\"\n\nI hope Za comes back into its own. If you'd caught me two years ago, I woulda given this place 4-stars. But being as times have changed, and Steve and Jose (and quality) have moved on, the most I can justify is 2-stars.

I decided to do a walking tour - Start at the Embarcadero, walk down Market to the Civic Center, then walk up Hyde all the up to Russian Hill and Lombard Street.\n\nNeedless to say, once I started walking up those hills, I started to get weak. I needed some fuel to keep on going. I saw some cafes around, but I really didn't want any of that stuff. I just wanted some greasy food and a drink. Not much to ask, right? That's when I ran into Za. The place was a bit empty (just three other people), so I decided to go on in and order a slice of Pepperoni.\n\nNow, I was born in Chicago and just recently moved to the Bay Area from New York City, so I think I have a pretty good opinion on what good pizza is. I was a bit worried coming to the West Coast, since I just love me a good slice of pizza, and didn't think I would find pizza as good as the ones I had in NYC or Chi-Town. Za destroyed those worries. Not only was the slice huge, it was one of the better slices of pizza I've had in my life. Seeing that there was beer, I ordered some of the local selection (Anchor Steam), which along with my awesomely huge slice of pizza definitely hit the spot for the afternoon.\n\nOne of the employees (perhaps the owner, not quite sure) was assembling some pizza boxes close by, and I told him about my worries and how they were gone now. He thanked me, then proceeded to tell me about two other places around San Francisco where they also had good pizza. I don't think anyone else would've sent me someplace else and potentially lose my business. But he seemed to genuinely care about my pizza cravings. That's just plain awesome.\n\nWhenever I'm around San Francisco again, I'll definitely make the sacrifice of taking my non-exercised self up those hills for another slice.

There are customer drawings hanging up on the walls that are fun to look at.\n\nOrdering\nYou can order a slice, but since those are have been sitting out and get reheated, we opted to order a pizza to get the freshest experience :) When we couldn't decide between Moma and Potesto, he said we could get half and half :) He showed us the size of a medium and a large. The medium is HUGE, so we got it. I think it has 8 big slices. The wait wasn't bad, maybe 15 minutes.\n\nFood\nYum! My boyfriend and I really liked the Potesto. I used my fork to cut the garlic into smaller pieces so that I could spread it out more, but it also tasted good when I bit into a whole chunk. The cheese was very flavorful! \nMy mom thought the Potesto was bland. I agree that it might be even tastier if the potatoes were seasoned (more?). I ate the crust, which I don't always do with pizza, so I can say 'thumbs up' for the crust too!\n\nMy mom loved the Moma. She has remarked several times since eating there, \"that pizza was very good. I would give it a high rating'. She knows we use 'review websites', and asked if we would write a review, so that prompted me to write this first ever Yelp review! My mom ate her leftover Moma slice cold for breakfast the next morning, and I had the Potesto for dinner. Both still tasted good! \n\nThe only iffy thing was the water. We noticed nearby diners holding their cups up and examining them. We looked at ours and noticed we all had things floating. My boyfriend thought it was lemon pulp, but the sight of it grossed me out and I only took a few sips of my water after that.\n\nPaying\nZa is a really busy place. Lots of people come in for pick-up orders, and drivers head out on deliveries frequently. After we finished, we were waiting for our check and unsure how to proceed. My mom went up to the register, but it was so busy and she's short, that another customer walked up later and got his bill first. I had my boyfriend go up and he was able to get their attention. We asked if they had any foil because we just had 2 slices left and didn't want a big box (plus tiny hotel fridge!). The same guy that helped us earlier got us the foil :) I also saw him constantly seating people and busing tables. They take credit card payment.\n\nFinal Verdict\nWe're just visiting California, otherwise we would definitely go back and try other toppings, like Vincent Van Dough!", "author": "Jessica H."}

Frequently.\n\nA small place in Russian Hill, it plays host to a wonderful array of pies that come out waiting to deliver a knock out. \n\nA hungry group of us meandered here after a perfect trip to wine country and threw in our order for a Da Vinci's Palette ( Red and green peppers, spicy sausage and onions ) and the Salvador Dali ( Roasted Chicken, sun dried tomatoes, fresh pesto and tomato sauce )\n\nOrders keep the room busy, but the attendants are friendly, open to conversation and serve their stellar pizza with a confident grin.\n\nThe Da Vinci won me over. Quickly. Spicy sausage took center stage, and left your tongue reeling in euphoria. The fun combo of bell peppers brought on the final kick that left you supremely content.\n\nNeedless to say, the Salvador was a winner as well.\n\nZa's is a neighborhood institution and delivers a pizza in it's own class.\n\nAnd a nice little side note: When dining here, if you're craving the delectable bread pudding from Frascati, they will deliver it to you.\n\nYup, sometimes life just is that perfect.", "author": "Mike K."}

I think, quality-wise, it slots in nicely between the low-end, high-volume places like Little Star / Pizza Orgasmica, and the \"high-end\" places like Pizzeria delFina & Paulines. The shop itself is small (5 tables?), with probably 8 stools along the bar. We sat at the bar, and it was the best decision ever.\n\nAfter deciding on toppings, we put in an order for a medium pie w/ pepperoni, ham & pineapple. A little twist on the classic Hawaiian if you will. I unfortunately forget the waiter/bartender's name, but he suggested we add some jalapeno peppers to a small portion of the pizza as it would really contrast nicely w/ the sweetness of the pineapple. DAMN he was right. It was delicious! Served fresh out of the over, I'd recommend giving it a few minutes to cool down (I like my cheese to be a bit firmer) before digging in.\n\nWe got about 4 slices each out of the medium size, which was more than enough to fill us up & still have a piece leftover for a snack. \n\nTo accompany the pizza we had a few beers (Anchor Steam & Sierra Nevada if you must know) which washed it down well. \n\nAll said, the food was great, the price was so-so. 1 medium pizza + 3 toppings + 4 beers = ~$49 including tax & tip ($8 tip on a base of $41). It won't break the bank, but you can certainly find a cheaper place around. That said, you don't get the nice warm atmosphere, the stellar recommendations, or the delicious pizza that come with Za.

The place was ridiculously busy, but he didn't act rushed or bothered at all, taking time to joke with us and hook us up with water. Again, this is a casual place with casual prices -- tips are not something he can expect. \n\nIn addition to the pizza, they serve respectable and awesomely huge salads (one fed all four of us with salad leftover).

I finally got a call from the driver asking if I can come out to pick it up. Really now? So he handed me the pizza and I handed him his tip, which he looked unappreciative. Not even a \"Thank you\". he looks like he hated his job. I asked him if he had any pepper or cheese and he said that I have to request it when I ordered. Shouldn't all pizza delivery guys have red pepper and cheese on them?\nAnyways, the pizza was a pretty decent size, cut up into 6 huge slices. However, it was room temperature. That's probably why it was late! It was probably sitting on the counter when the driver or whoever works there realized \"Oh wait! This pizza needs to be delivered!\" The pizza itself was very good. The pesto was very flavorful without being overpowering. The spicy sausage came with crumbled sausage bits and roasted red peppers and onions. Also very good.\n\nOverall, pretty good pizza.

Nob Hill Cafe was way too crowded, sushi didn't hit the spot and we weren't sure what to do.

Why not.\n\nSo after a few minutes wait we got a corner table out in the front where we could see our first (long long ago) flat in the city and started talking to our server who was an absolute doll.

Great atmosphere.\n\nWe couldn't finish more than 1/2 of the medium pizza and when the check came, they had comp'd the beers for our anniversary.  I have never seen a restaurant with 4 stars do that.\n\nOn our walk home through the city wife bumped into the box of pizza that I was carrying back to downtown.

There is no other pizza restaurant unless you wander down into North Beach or towards Polk Street. And for those like myself that have lived in the area, there are times when you would sacrifice good taste for the immediacy of picking something up quickly. In short, they have a captured audience on the Hill.\n\nThe New York Style pizza served at ZA is not my favorite. The thin crust experience is not satisfying. I don't enjoy pizza with pools of grease collected inside pepperoni cups. It makes for a very soggy experience. There have been times when I couldn't tell if the pizza was cooked completely as the center tasted gummy.\n\nI did try ordering smaller pizza's and found they were better and seemed fully cooked. I suspect the larger pizzas are not cooked completely.\n\nThey do have an interesting selection of pizza'a and sell nicely sized slices. But again because of the large slices, they don't seem completely cooked.\n\nFor those that like thin crust and your in the neighborhood, sure try it. For those that want something better, try New York Pizza on Polk Street or just order delivery from Extreme Pizza on Union Street.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice with a few tables and seats at the bar.", "author": "Peter M."}

Don't get me wrong, a good deep-dish pie can be a wonderful thing when I'm in the right mood (see my review of Paxti's in Hayes Valley) but there's just something about the feel of a perfectly done thin-crust slice in your hands (and your mouth!) that can't be beat.\n\nAll of which brings me to Za, home of the best thin-crust pizza I've had in SF so far!  The crust is perfection!  My current favorite is the Scaliano, tomato, green onion, spicy sausage and just the right amount of garlic.\n\nThe pizza alone would justify the 5-star rating but add to that the most amazingly laid-back and comfortable atmosphere around and you've got a real special place.  All the guys who work there are extremely friendly, it really feels more like somebody's house than a restaurant.  The employees seem to know almost everyone who walks in and they're also very nice to the happy tourists who come in off the Cable Car line.\n\nOne final note, if you happen to be a Dead-Head you will receive an added bonus in the form of a steady soundtrack of Grateful Dead (assuming there's no Baseball or Football game on the TV above the bar).

Gourmet is a evil marketing tool that restaurants use to charge more for something by pretending it more sophisticated/better than the average competitor.

It would be like having gourmet mac & cheese (which oddly also exists).\n\nAnyway ranting aside. If there was such a thing as gourmet pizza than Za would be it. In this case I'm using gourmet to mean \"good.\" I've eaten at Za's many times and their pizza have always been great. I'm a thick crust kind of guy so their pizzas work nicely. They pizza toppings always taste fresh and crispy. That aside their food is still a little pricey, a medium pizza should not cost $20 regardless of how good it is.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-02", "description": "A surprisingly good experience on a Monday evening. We are A 16 pizza obsessives--we like our pizza very thin crust, crispy with burnt bits and minimal but very flavorful toppings. We tend not to like most pizza from most pizza places but we were in the Russian Hill neighborhood and yelp said this was good, so we decided we'd settle for some mediocre pizza. But, Za was far better than mediocre.\nWe ordered two medium pies for four of us with a salad and got all of this to go, calling in our order ahead of time.  The mediums are good sized and we had pieces left when we were all finished. We were told 25 minutes until our pizzas would be ready and this was pretty much on the money. We made the decision not to eat in the joint because it is quite small, the atmosphere is rather minimal and we didn't think we'd want to linger chatting here.\nWe ordered the Scaliano, a mixture of spicy sausage, garlic, green onion and chopped tomato and a pepperoni mushroom.  The crusts were thin (not super thin) but not bready, doughy or pastry like. A nice bite and, upon a second heating the next day, quite crisp.  I would say the cheese was light for this type of pizza joint (which I much prefer). I don't know if it was straight up mozzerella because it did not have that way stringy pull that mozz has and it was a bit tastier then mozz usually is. (This is shredded mozz, not fresh).  \nThe scaliano was all four of our favorites. Its quite flavorful with the spicy sausage and the bite of the garlic and a tangy sweetness to the sauce.  The pepperoni pizza was good but not great. The mushrooms were fresh and plentiful and, surprisingly, there were more tomatoes on the pepperoni (even though we did not order tomatoes so they must have been part of the sauce) than on the scaliano. That might be my one complaint about the scaliano is I would have liked more tomato.\nWe sprinkled on little packets of red pepper and really ejoyed our pizza.\nThe salad was a green salad with green bell, red bell, onion and boxed croutons. They make their own salad dressing, but I'm not much of a salad dressing person so don't have much to say about that. It was fresh.\nA note to crisp crust aficiado's.  We popped the pizza in the oven the next day on a good, solid cooking sheet and the crust got almost cracker like.", "author": "Vivek V."}

(which I would consider Joe's to the the quintessential NYC slice.) When I hear a place serves up a NY style slice my accent slowly creeps back and I throw some trash out the window to ready myself for the experience.\n\nThis is not in any way shape or form NYC pizza. I really wish people would stop writing this, because you have no idea what you are doing to us New Yorkers. It's Friday night, we're tired, we hit yelp and give in to your frivolous words. It's like me saying that Safeway has the best Philly Style Cheese steaks, and for truly authentic Dim Sum you just have to hit the Panda Express. Now, that's harsh, because this Pizza is not bad at all, it's just not NYC style.\n\nCornmeal crust such as this can be found at Two Boots, which is indeed located in NYC,  but no one would consider that representational of Manhattan. It's more for the recently migrated post college girls to stumble into at 3 am after they have worked up a mighty appetite dancing on the top of bars.\n\nThat said, if you like Two Boots/Cornmeal/modern riffs on pizza this is a pretty good one.

Whether it's simple cheese or pep, or one of their interesting creations, it's all good.  \n\nThe bad:  overpriced pizza and arrogant service don't take too well with many restaurant go-ers.  Case in point: I enjoy my pizza with a side of ranch about half the time I eat it (either ranch or garlic sauce; an addiction of mine, but I can't enjoy pizza without a sauce whose portions I control added on top).  So one time at Za I ask the server if I can have a side of ranch, and he stops, scoffs loudly, and responds, \"We don't serve ranch here\" and walks away.

I looked it up on yelp of course and when i saw it had 4 stars i had to give it a try, and let me say this place did not disappoint me at all. Im a pizza lover so Im always on the hunt for the best pies around. This pizza was thin crusted, with delicious sauce,and HUGE slices!Mannnnn was it good! Not to mention that the price is reasonably for what you get! The only down side was the space inside the restaurant, its was small, but it did give me that mama pap shop feel!!

We had the Moma (mushrooms, onions, artichoke hearts, fresh basil) with spicy sausage and the Salvador Dali (roasted chicken, sundried tomatoes, pesto and tomato sauce). I personally couldn't get enough of the Moma and the spicy sausage really brought the flavors together in this pizza. I ate more than my usual 1 slice which means this must have been good. I gave the other pizza a try and I didn't like the combination. The chicken was a little dry and I'm not a big fan of pesto w/sundried tomatoes. Other than that I like the crust - crunch on the edges and softer on the inside. I printed out 2 coupons from online so I got $2 off each pizza. It worked out to be about $9 per person for 3-4 slices.", "author": "Candace F."}

By 4:30, my roommate was preparing his dinner. Whatever it was, it smelled delicious. Consequently, I found myself feeling famished.\n\nSo I headed to Yelp to look for a great pizza spot and I found it, right in the neighborhood. Za's is fantastic. I got two slices, one with sausage and one vegetarian. Of course, the vegetarian pizza didn't feel vegetarian at all; just like a good simple tomato pizza.\n\nAnd the reason I got two slices is because I was darn near starving and felt like one would not be sufficient. I was wrong. Each slice was *literally* larger than my face. After one, I was satisfied. After two, I was super full.\n\nThe pizza was thin crust. Curiously, the vegetarian pizza, which I ate first, was crisp and steady, able to be held with one hand (despite its hugeness.) The sausage was the opposite - super floppy and requiring cutlery. They were both delicious, though. I do wish that the sausage could've had the same crispness.\n\nWhat really won me over was the service. I sat at the bar and got to overhear the incredibly friendly cashier clueing in some out-of-towners on some other restaurants to visit. After a few minutes, he reminded the cooks about my slices. It wasn't bad at all; they were on my table within five or ten minutes. I went at 5PM and it was already pretty crowded. I can only imagine how it would be during peak hours, but with good reason.\n\nZa, I will be back. (perhaps for only a single slice, though!)", "author": "Chris L."}

The rave yelp reviews and interesting menu made our decision easy and we went with this place. Unfortunately, the reviews did not equate with our experience. When we called to place our order the guy was rushed and only half paying attention. He'd interrupt to ask a question that I was already in the process of answering. I gave him explicit directions to our hotel multiple times (due to the listening problem he seemed to have) since our hotel lobby was located apart from the main hotel lobby. When the delivery driver called to let us know that he had arrived I went to meet him and found an empty lobby. I assumed that the instructions I'd given had not been shared with him and called the driver to tell him where to go. My call was received by a rude jerk who asked how he was supposed to know where to go. All in all, the pizza itself was alright. It wasn't horrible, and it wasn't great. The experience with the staff was not worth it at all. If you don't mind half-assed rude people with a decent product, go with these guys. If you want helpful staff with manners, go elsewhere.", "author": "Elaine M."}

It's all fresh and they never cheap out on the toppings.  \nYes, the place is small, but that's what a pizZA place in the hood should be like.  Those who complain about the delivery service....I don't have much to say to you.  They don't hire dozens of formerly unemployed idiots to bring you your grub.  They only have a couple people to get in their car and drive it to you.  So if you want it hot and crispy, eat there.\nOh, and I should mention that their green salad is AWESOME and the portion is very generous.

Tables were open when we got there. I went to ask the guy working the floor if there was a wait for the open tables and he immediately gave me attitude. I mean, really rude and dismissive. When we sat down, I tried to tell him we'd placed a carry-out order and wanted to eat it there. Three new people walked in and the guy yelled something to the effect \"So what?! You're gonna make these people wait cuz you called ahead? That's not how it works.\" He continued to tell us, in front the entire restaurant how rude we were, even as people next to us were leaving and offering up their table. I don't have an issue with their policy. If they won't let you sit to eat a slice of your carry-out, that's cool.

I do love local places like Zacharys and Little Star, but when it comes to thin crust goodness, Za Pizza is definitely my go-to place.  It does seem a little bit more expensive to the chain places, but their pies are sized accordingly.  A \"medium\" is about the size of a \"large\" anywhere else.\n\nThey have a great selection of toppings, but my default order is pepperoni and spinach.  If you're looking for single slices, stop by their place over on Hyde Street (good luck finding parking if you don't live in Russian Hill) and walk in and grab a piece for $3-something dollars.  It feels very NYC/Greenwich Village to me in that sense.\n\nThere are a few tables here which are never empty.  I wouldn't say this place has great ambiance, nor would I particularly rave about their wine.  Both are cheap.  But the owner is a very nice guy who is just trying to \"make it in the world\" with his wife.  They have a home in Petaluma but he spends a lot of nights in a modest apartment a few blocks from the place.  He's great to talk to about the Bay Area and takes great care of the guys who work for him.  You can tell that his pizza shop is a total labor of love.\n\nSo between the awesome pizza and good-natured feel of this place, I can assert with confidence that this is my very favorite thin crust pizza in the Bay Area.

My guy loves Za, but I've always preferred NB Pizza over them. They do have creative toppings, but I was never really excited about any of them after we ordered. The crust is a little thin for my taste, i prefer a thicker crust. The delivery takes a long time every time we've ordered too so that's always a bummer. We have ordered from them sevral times though and if it really wasn't good I wouldn't be going back, so I guess I'm just indifferent, they aren't my favorite but definitely aren't the worst either. I'll give them another shot in 09 and then update it incase I'm forgetting anything exciting that would warrant an extra star.", "author": "Audrey V."}

Nothing fancy or over the top, just real food, real GOOD food. He gave us a few names and then as we were driving around he goes \"ZA'S... ZA'S\". Thinking he half lost his mind, he finally says ZA'S pizza is THE BEST in SF and very possibly the BEST he has EVER had. Now this is a real bold statement to make considering we are both from New York so I knew we had to try it out.  Well he was RIGHT.  ZA's pizza is incredible!! The crust is perfect, slightly crisp with an outrageous texture and taste.  The place isn't fancy and with four or five tables plus counter service it is down right tiny. They have specialty pies but we opted for plain just to start off with the basics. Soda for the boys, beer for me and we were on our way. It didn't take us long to devour the large pie, and this was also one of the largest large pies I have ever seen. For a nice SF touch you can grab the table closest to the window and watch the cable cars go by. The walk back across Hyde was a bit slower but definitely worth it. If you don't over do it Swensen's ice cream a few blocks up is also worth a visit, more on that in another review.  Good call cuz, you're a foodie and didn't even know it!

For garlic fans the Potesto is tasty and there is a nice selection of other pizzas, salad etc.  Can get packed during prime time.  Good spot for pulling up a bar stool, having a couple of slices and throwing back a coldie or two.", "author": "K W."}

Special slices are offered each day and the combinations are tasty.  Low key neighborhood spot for when you feel like pizza and beer.

If there was a Supreme in SF you'd probably find most of them hanging out there giving you attitude, forcing you to think they are too kewl for skool.  But here we are in SF and they are busy serving up cornmeal crust pizza that, btw, is actually pretty darn tasty.  Is it NYC style?  Hell no.  Is it gourmet?  Not really.  It's some sort of hybrid that can't decide where its loyalty lies.  Too thick for NYC.  Too sloppy and substantial for gourmet.  At the end of the day I generally don't crave this place but when I eat there I tend to enjoy my slices.  A bit pricey for a slice but the ingredients are good and the slices are huge.  It can be annoying at night when the place is all rammed up and the music is blasting.  But, if you're in that neck of the woods it's a great option.  I would suggest if you're a regular in the neighborhood to head over to Slice of NY on Polk & Broadway (which they co-own btw).  Less money, less attitude, less busy, and generally, a tastier slice.", "author": "Daniel R."}

A place to check out if you in the hood. Good Pizza and drinks.....", "author": "jon w."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-08-08", "description": "Stopped by during a noisy lunch hour for a cheese slice. Though pre-made and re-heated in the oven when I ordered it was quite tasty. Good, thin and crisp crust with tight, compact and spongy bubbles at the very edge. Cheese and sauce weren't over the moon but definetely a step above any national chains. Friendly waiter and free refills on my diet coke, a tad pricy ($3.50) but the size, about 9 inches from edge to edge more than made up for it. Looking forward to trying some of their more adventurous pies.", "author": "Jeff H."}

Pizza is pretty good, but I've decided it's no longer worth the abuse you get on the phone. My wife and I frequently flip a coin to decide who gets to be the unlucky sap who has to call them; it's always a wholly unpleasant experience. The last straw came this evening, when we tried to order and the guy told me they don't deliver to our address (which, by the way, is about ten blocks away -- it's not like I'm asking them to drive across the city!) Told him that they actually delivered to us all the time -- I've got eight of their menus in front of me to prove it, since they give us one every time they drop off a pizza -- and he gave me some attitude about how they've never delivered to this area, then hung up on me. Awesome customer service, dude! Looks like I'm off to Victor's. Might not be quite as \"gourmet,\" but it's definitely cheaper and at least they're not total dicks.", "author": "Sean S."}
