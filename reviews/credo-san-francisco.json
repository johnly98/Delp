The combination of sweet and savory was just delicious. 10/10 recommend! I ordered the tomatoes and cucumber salad with yogurt (starter) and it was okay. I wouldn't order it again. As for our main dishes, I had the salmon and I was not super impressed. The top coat garnish was good, gave it a lot of flavor. But the rest of the salmon was just \"eh\". The beans and veggies that came under the salmon were also okay, the sauce in which they were cooked with was okay as well. My friend ordered the halibut and he said it was now the second time he'd ordered it, it was really good according to him. Looked good!\n\nWe both got a taste of a white wine the waiter suggested (cannot remember the name) and it was really really good. I've yet to find a white wine that I really like as I'm a red wine kind of gal, but this one was definitely a good one! I remember the waiter mentioning it was from the north of Italy, a little town which had the name on the bottle. \n\nNow the service. The service was great! Our waiter was super kind, very attentive and knew his recommendations well. I appreciate a waiter that knows what he's talking about and doesn't just give off random suggestions or the \"well everything is pretty good\". The manager (gentleman walking around in a suit) was very kind as well. Always had a smile and was courteous.\n\nAll in all, pretty good experience.

Four of us gathered for an early meal and found the restaurant  to be very pleasant since it was quiet enough to hold a conversation.\n\nWhat I liked about Credo was the fact that there were a lot of food options for any appetite and craving. Bonus: the restaurant starts you off with delicious complimentary levain bread & butter.\n\nAfter reading other Yelp reviews I decided we should start off with the octopus plate as our shared appetizer. Gotta say that not only was the plate very pretty to look at but also incredibly tasty. Definitely I could have had this all to myself as an entree since the vegetables, potatoes and octopus together was delicious.\n\nMy companions (who all seemed focused on carbo loading) ordered pastas: pappardelle with pork sugo, linguine & clams and cavatelli with chicken breast. They seemed happy with their dishes and gobbled up the pasta in record time.\n\nMy choice of pork chop as entree, unfortunately, was the only disappoint. The meat was undercooked and was quite pink near the bone so I couldn't eat it. Otherwise the accompanying sides of sauteed red cabbage (somewhat sauerbraten-like) and disks of baked/ grilled sweet potato were yummy.\n\nSince one of our party was celebrating a birthday, we were about to order dessert but were pleasantly surprised when our server brought out a slice of cake with a lit candle on a plate. How thoughtful & what a nice surprise! The cake was a house-made cherry blossom essence sponge cake with whip cream on the side. Very light and was a good way to round out the meal.\n\nOverall, I liked Credo restaurant. The decor was very pretty; the quiet weekend ambiance relaxing for the group; and food was satisfying. Hope to return to try other dishes in the future.\n\nBtw: Credo in Italian means \"I believe\" and this is the start of all the quotes on the artfully designed wall space.", "author": "Joanna T."}

Came here after attending a Yelp event with Credo and was thoroughly impressed. I've walked by many a time and never came in. So glad I finally did.\n\nFOOD: The food was all amazing. We had the meatballs with polenta (yum yum yum), the octopus (most tender octopus we've ever had), the pizza crust pasta, squash blossom pizza, and New York steak. WHATA MEAL! Highlights were the meatballs, octopus, and steak. Soooo good. If you love octopus, get this get this. It was melt-in-your-mouth good. I love polenta and meatballs, and these were so flavorful and light. Apparently they take 3 days to make, and you can tell how much love goes into them. The steak was perfectly cooked (medium rare for me), and the fried green tomatoes on the side were so flavorful.\n\nSERVICE: We adored our waiter, Tim. He was honest and helpful, ensuring we had the best wine to go with our meal. and that everything was to our liking. Really great guy! General service was also great- our water glasses were never empty, and they didn't take our empty plates until we were BOTH done eating. Call me traditional, but this is important to me when dining at a nice restaurant.\n\nPRICE: I thought prices were very fair. For 3 courses each + wine, we paid $200. And we were beyond stuffed (2 courses would have been fine). Great serving sizes and endless bread!\n\nOverall, I think this place is an absolute gem. Not only is the food delicious and well thought-out, but the serving staff is an absolute delight. I want to spend every night dining here! Wonderful experience.

The sausage, penne and the cheese make a great combination. The pizza crust on the top taste fantastic as well, I never had this delicious pizza crust before. \n\nSecond choice is the Riccotta Ginocchi, mushroom taste fresh and melt well with the corn. \n\nThird choice is the Kauai prawns. This dish tastes like Thai style and suddenly bring me back to Southeast Asia, the prawns are large and fresh. \n\nMy suggestion for improvement is the Mt Lassen trout we had at the end, the trout was like frozen and lacks of freshness, the meat was kinda tight and not tender.

I'm no wine expert but i'm instantly impressed by any hints of a restaurant going digital. Efficient! And not impersonal at all. Our table was well attended to throughout the entire evening...\n\nKauai Blue Prawns had killer sauce. I wanted a bowl of this. I resisted any of the table bread until i realized i needed to mop all of that good stuff up. The Ricotta Gnocchi was just as pillowy as you'd expect. I wasn't huge on the morels but that didn't stop me from shoving the gnocchi down. The Octopus was tender and buttery soft. It was my favorite dish and if you don't know what to order, order this. The Salmon with quinoa sounded \"too healthy\" for me and i ended up pleasantly surprised - it was excellent. Nicely cooked piece of fish and flavor all there. Beef short rib was very good. Nice hearty plate.\n\nThere's always room for dessert. Two desserts in fact! I was sooo tempted by the Milk & Cookies but thought i'd be adventurous with their Strawberry Shortcake and Panna Cotta.

I had the opportunity to try quite a few dishes, so here's a few of the most memorable ones from favorite to least:\n\n-Gnocchi: Loved the cloud-like texture of the pasta. The variation I had featured tasty chanterelle mushrooms and sweet corn, and I enjoyed the fresh take on a dish that otherwise would've been too heavy.\n-Sedanini: Had fun watching them cut open the dough cover to reveal the steaming pasta awaiting inside. The sauce was so fresh and tasted like it was made of tomatoes picked off the vine that very day. Bonus points for the unique fennel sausage.\n-Octopus: I'm personally not a fan of octopus but have to admit they cooked it extremely well. Was pleasantly surprised by how soft and tender it was- none of the usual rubbery chewiness.\n-Squash blossom pizza: I liked that the creme fraiche wasn't overpowering and instead allowed the natural flavors of the vegetables to shine through. And the truffle oil was an A+ addition.\n-Heirloom tomatoes: Delicious and painless way to get your vegetables in with some of the freshest produce around.\n-Kauai Blue Prawns, daily risotto, trout: Probably the most mediocre dishes. None were bad, but I thought they lacked a wow factor.\n-Crostini: Beautiful in presentation but the amount of gorgonzola used was a bit tooo generous\n-There was also this incredible burrata bruschetta with sweet pickled tomatoes that I can't find on the online menu but it was one of my favorite things of the night so definitely try asking for it!", "author": "Amy C."}

I previewed the menu before I came here. One item that sounded interesting was the lemon fettuccine with dungeness crab, mint, and chili. I was interested in that item because I was planning to cook pasta with mint for Christmas dinner. When I got there the server stated the special was chippino, which is an Italian-American style stew. I stuck to my initial order with the lemon fettuccine with mint. I never had mint in pasta before. What made the dish stands out was the chili as it enhances the mint due its spiciness. Due to the combination of the mint and chili there was a hot-cool texture. The dungeness crab was okay but the mint and chili combination made the dish delicious. I ordered the apple strudel for dessert, which was okay. My rating was based on that lemon fettuccine with dungeness crab, mint, and chili. Overall lunch was okay, but I'm not going to complain as I didn't have to pay for lunch.", "author": "Gerald R."}

We ordered the octopus and the burrata small plates for the table and there was nothing left when the servers came to take the plates away. The burrata was my personal favorite. \n\nI had the turkey burger for my main and it was crazy satisfying (and filling!).

Again, there was nothing left on the plates! My personal favorite were the oatmeal crumble bars and the homemade marshmallows.

The upstairs dining room is open and airy.  And, they have a cool private dining room with a literary theme with bright white walls with cool quotes.\n\nOnto the rest . . . their pastas are solid, but not as good as nearby Perbacco.  Their oven-baked pizzas are in my opinion the best in the FiDi.\n\nThe real problem is the service.  Unfortunately it's consistently slow and unsophisticated.  As an example, we recently dined with a large group of about 10 on a weeknight; and we didn't finish until 3 hours after our reservation.  The appetizer course was split.  She served the meatballs, then much later served the crostinis.  Entrees were very slow coming as well.\n\nAside from slow food service, our waitress was not the brightest bulb in the bunch.  I'm currently on a low carb diet due to gestational diabetes.  The special pizza of the night was said something like squash, creme fraiche, truffle oil.  I asked her if there was any cheese on the pizza.  She kept saying yes, \"cream cheese\" and parmesan.  And, I explained that creme fraiche is not cheese; and asked if there was any other cheese like mozzarella.  She went back to ask the kitchen, and came back and said yes there was parmesan and another cheese.  So, I ordered the special pizza.   But, when I got the pizza, there was only creme fraiche and parmesean, which doesn't have enough fat to balance out the carbs from the crust.  So frustrating.  It was too late to order something else, so of course, I ate the pizza, and my blood sugars went through the roof.  Thanks, incompetent waitress.", "author": "Christina L."}

Located in a former bank space, the feel is very interesting with its high ceilings and large front window.  Seated at a table just about at the center of the restaurant, we were able to carry our conversations without any noise issues.  Only one of our party of three had dined here before so we trusted his recommendation in ordering a pizza.  \nWith my lunch guests being calorie conscious, we shared the roasted octopus and sausage pizza as appetizers and ordered individual entrees; in my guests' cases, they ordered salads for their main meals.  The octopus was tasty and interestingly served on a bed of warm potatoes and greens; the octopus slices were tender but not mushy.  The pizza was still hot and the sausage had a good mix of herb flavors.\nStudying their pasta list, the one that drew me the most was the baked lasagna with chicken (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=b33jyJVrzFPKSQrplGGwAQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  When my bowl arrived, my two guests were surprised at the portions, commenting that it looked modest; actually, it was just right, as most pasta lovers know, lasagna is filling due to the richness of the cheeses and layers of pasta.  The flavors were good and the chicken was nicely done, not overly dry.  The bread slice was the perfect ending in sopping up the last of the sauce.\nService was good as empty plates were replaced and water and iced tea glasses refilled.  The only flub was my iced tea glass.  Not looking at it carefully, I thought it was an artistic glass with some molding on it.  One guest said, \"Hey Mike, your glass is cracked!\"  After a closer look, we confirmed this and luckily it wasn't to the point of leaking so no harm, no foul.\nWe were in and out of the restaurant in just a little over an hour.

From the pre-dinner Manhattan / Martini at the bar, to the appetizers, to the delicious Sangiovese wine (thanks to the great recommendation from our waiter based on what we were planning to order as main courses), to the main courses themselves, it was an all-around great experience! Our service was very good as well. \n\nStarters: \nGreen & French White Asparagus: Huge asparagus w/ tasty Gribiche Sauce - would order again. \nKauai Blue Prawns: HUGE prawns, nice taste, might try a different dish next time but definitely worth trying once! \n\nMains: \nSedanini, Penne, Sweet Fennel Sausage, Tomato Sauce, Pizza Crust: THIS IS A MUST TRY. It's pasta inside a pizza crust (the crust has a buttery garlic flavor that was to die for). Don't go to Credo and not order this. \nBraised Beef Short Rib, Polenta, Roasted Vegetables, Red Wine Sauce: Beautiful short rib tower with short ribs that melted in your mouth.

All around great service, ambiance, and food, that makes for a wonderful experience.\n\nFor starters, the service was impeccable. We came at prime dinner time (w/o a reservation too) and they made a special effort to take care of my girlfriend and me. Management was very attentive and charming and the rest of the staff was so kind and helpful. When I left to use the restroom, someone had folded my napkin and placed it on my chair. When we were running out of room on the table for the rest of our food, the management came and slid another table next to ours so we wouldn't feel crowded. I have never experienced anything like that. They definitely take pride in making sure their patrons feel welcome and comfortable.\n\nThe ambiance is casual but classy, a perfect spot for drinks after work or a fun but upscale date spot. They have hundreds of quotes on the walls that range from inspiring (Anne Frank about the human spirit) to funny (Stephen Colbert about bears). \n\nThe food is delicious, too. We've had everything from the pizza and kale salad, to shrimp and clams and always come away full and satisfied. The cocktails are also delicious and they serve one helluva old fashioned. \n\nAll in all, Credo is a 5 star establishment that I would recommend to anyone. They really care about their patrons and it shows in all aspects of the Credo experience.", "author": "Jon C."}

I understand it was lunch time, but it was so difficult to flag someone to take our order and such after we were seated by the host. \n\nWhen our waiter took our order, he wasn't the friendliest, and was trying to rush us. \n\nWe order the appetizer to start, and boy it was so salty and over seasoned that powered over the octopus. Since it was so busy (too hard to find the waiter and get his attention), and we were hungry we just ate it. \n\nWe order pasta dishes for our main lunch, the tagliatelle and the fettuccine with spinach and salmon. They worth a disappointment. They didn't taste fresh, uneventful and salty again. Again, we ate them because it was just too hard to flad down the waiter, and the food too way longer than it should to come.\n\nSo there you have it. That sums up our experience at Credo. We were immensely looking forward to dining here as big foodies. So there was such a disspointment. Especially since it has been a longer running restaurant establishment in the FiDi district. But then again, that is probably why it has been long running in the FiDi; since people are always coming and going in the area, they don't know better, perhaps they just go in and probably get one meal and never come back. Or perhaps \"desperate\" for a quick lunch near their office, they will just accept the subpar.", "author": "Sonia A."}

I really dig this place. I love the whole vibe - the walls are covered in inspirational quotes, but not cheesy ones. You feel good just reading the walls. The corporate event I held there was a fundraising mixer we did in The Archive, a room downstairs that is secluded from the hustle and bustle of the restaurant. It feels very private. The food and wine pairings were superb. The little noshes were great for grazing, and they were just heavy enough to make sure that the wine didn't get ahead of you. I remember the pizza being rather great. And...they gave us to-go boxes to take what the crowd left. Yum.\n\nMy dinner experience was great as well. I had tastes of several appetizers: the burrata, the meatballs, and the polenta. The burrata was strange and amazing. The texture was so silky, and the hit of sea salt really set it off. The polenta used really meaty mushrooms, which gave it depth. I thought it was interesting to serve polenta *on* toast, but hey, it tasted great.\n\nI had the mushroom risotto, which used those same meaty mushrooms that were in the polenta. It was delectable. Every person in our party completely cleaned their plates. My observation of our other entrees looked great as well. I liked how this restaurant does Italian without being 75% pasta.\n\nAnd one last little thing: this was the only restaurant in the FiDi within reasonable walking distance that could seat a table of eight at 5pm with more than a week's notice. I didn't think it would be that tough, but it was. Credo will definitely join my short list of preferred restaurants in the area.", "author": "Kelsey S."}

Rather than ordering entrees we followed the suggestion of the wonderful server (Sabrina) and ordered a variety of small and medium plates, one large plate, and several desserts - all to share.  It was a GREAT suggestion as we got to taste so many delicious foods! By the end of the evening, we were WOWED by the experience. I will list all the selections we tried at the end of the review.\n\nThe restaurant has a very cool vibe with walls of quotes from every side of the aisle and all walks of life (Credo = I believe). They also serve as conversation starters. When we arrived for an early dinner (6:00 pm on a Sat night) there were plenty of seats but by the time we left, the place was packed. The service was very attentive and the food just kept coming. There is a full bar and the wine selections provide a lot of choices. I could see this becoming a great local spot where you become a regular and the staff knows your name. \n\nThe stars from our small plates included the Burrata (oh so creamy!), the roasted Brussels sprouts, roasted baby artichokes, the fava bean crostini with pecorino, and the pork/ricotta  meatballs.\n \nNext were the medium plates: the hands down favorite was the pumpkin gnocchi. Added to that were a delicious chopped salad (really fresh!) and a mushroom pizza that we also loved. \n\nWe decided to order one large plate just so we could taste the New York steak with the roasted potatoes, spinach and salsa verde. It sounded so good on the menu and it was the perfect finale to our shared meal. \n\nAll that and we still had a little room for dessert. The one selection that we had to try and LOVED was the cookies and milk - the selection of cookies was right out of the oven and were the epitome of comfort food.The tiramisu was outstanding as was the chocolate budino (a rich delicious pudding). \n\nWe can't wait to visit this restaurant again.

The food isn't good enough to go out of the way for and there's not a ton of nightlife in the area.\n\n- Tons of offices nearby so it's probably crazy busy during lunch. I've only dined in when I bring interview candidates to lunch but we've always had a reservation.\n\n- I'm not sure if they stock a full bar but their bar was indeed well stocked.

It was shared amongst about 10 people and was left unfinished.\n\n* Burrata with Tuscan Honey and Sea Salt ($9) - 4 STARS: A good burrata is good no matter what you put on it. I think it was an interesting combination of honey and cheese, but I preferred to eat it plain than with the crostini.\n\n* Berkshire Proscuitto ($12) - 3.5 STARS: Pretty good, but for the portion of meat I felt it was pretty stingy.\n\n* Pork and Ricotto Meatballs ($9) - 4 STARS: I typically dislike polento for it's gelatinous texture, but it was a perfect complement to the homemade tasting meatballs. A great sharing dish.\n\n* Pork Chop - 4 STARS: So, the porkchop was quite delicious, despite my having been to NOPA just a week before. As a porkchop snob, I can admit the seasoning and execution of this bone-in chop was excellent; however, the quality of the chop itself was not as high quality (thick, fatty, tender, etc) as Nopa or Seven Hills. The accompanying side of kale was way too sweet. Almost inedible.\n\n* Bittersweet Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Crema ($7) - 5 STARS: Your traditional molten chocolate cake. Very similar to what you might have at Roy's.\n\n* Yogurt Panna Cotta ($7) - 4 STARS: I also am a panna cotta fiend and this was delicious. Just the right amount of vanilla bean and bouncy texture. Wasn't a huge fan of the grapefruit topping, but it was still good.\n\n* Chocolate cake with graham cracker crust ($7) - 2 STARS: This was more of a chocolate tarte with chocolate ganache. Very decadent and sweet. Not my favorite.\n\n* Olive oil cake ($7) - 1.5 STAR: I have had many olive oil cakes and this wasn't my favorite.\n\n* Almond Cake ($7) - 1 STAR: So. Dry.

Hopefully not, because I'd like to dine here in the near future.\n\nI wanted to take my sis out to see the Bay Lights before she headed back to SoCal.  My mom tagged along since dining with her daughters was a better option than waiting for a bus to head home to the Central Valley.  I wanted to eat at Credo because I saw it on Check Please and I pass by it almost every day.\n\nAs an appetizer, we ordered the roasted carrots and an arugula salad.  The carrots were my favorite, and definitely the highlight of the experience.  They came with hazelnuts and this buttery-nutty sauce...I ended up dipping my bread in it because it was so good.  The salad had dates, tossed with almonds in a vinaigrette.  The dates were very sweet, and I had to eat it with the arugula to balance out the flavor.\n\nThen came the pizza!  We got the magherita pizza and a spinach pizza.  Both were really good, but I really liked the magherita.  The crust was thin, crunchy on the outside yet doughy on the inside.  One pizza is enough for one person; however, if you're the type that gets full easily, then there would be enough to share.  \n\nTo finish the dining experience, we ordered the meyer lemon panna cotta, topped with strawberries.  It was a sweet cleansing to the heaviness of the meal.\n\nService was friendly.  I just want to say that the waiter was funny... not only was it Black Friday, but my sister and I no longer eat meat.  When our waiter asked how the meal was, we said it was fantastic.. and he commented that it was meat-free in a surprising tone!  Yes, a meal can be great without the use of meat.. lol.\n\nI also like the decor.. I feel like it's something I'd see in the Mission for some reason.. maybe it's because of all the progressive quotes and how they're laid out.  And you won't miss out on any quotes in the bathroom as the wallpaper is full of it.  It's kind of creepy that speeches are played in the bathroom..

However, I decided to go with the Osso Bucco di Malale (Braised Pork Shank with Maitake Mushrooms, served on Farro Risotto) since it sounded a little more enticing to me.\n\nWhen my order was brought out, it looked great (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iXjbvsGyhGttLRaV6shP1g?select=3JPPV6ocysRmJwbbh9x8cw).  The meat was tender, and I really liked the sauce on the dish (mostly because of the maitake mushrooms...yum).  Sadly though, I didn't think the shank had enough flavor, especially from the sauce.  Instead, most of the flavor seemed to be coming from whatever herb they used to cook it with.  I still can't put my finger on what type it was, but I didn't care for it.  As for the risotto, it was pretty good, but it didn't have the usual creaminess.  Instead, the farro gave it a slightly \"rough\" texture (sort of like brown rice or oats).  Nothing wrong with that, just different than what you might expect when you see \"risotto\" on the menu.\n\nWhile the Osso Bucco was fine for the most part (I picked out that herb every time I saw it), I'd say the three and a half average Credo has is about right.  Since the service didn't really do it for me though, I'm rounding down to three.  Even though the waitress who helped bring the dishes to our table was fine, our original waiter seemed to disappear whenever we needed something.  Other than to greet us and take our order, I don't remember seeing him come by the table it came time to collect our bill.  Kudos to the owners though for teaming up with different non-profits and organizations to help raise money for their causes.", "author": "Mike L."}

When you come here dress decently. \n\nAfter walking inside, we got seated because we had a 6:15 reservation. It seemed pretty crowded, I do recommend getting a reservation.

All the questions I had, he was able to answer quickly. \n\nI ordered the tagliatelle with homemade bolognese sauce. With every bolognese sauce you know what to expect. A rich and creamy sauce with some meaty chunks. This was exactly what it was. I didn't know what tagliatelle was before I came here, but the waiter was able to tell me what it was. My cousin had the lasagna with chicken, mushrooms, bechamel, herbs, parmesan,& tomato sauce. He said his lasagna was amazing and he has had it before and would keep ordering it if he came here again. My tagliatelle was absolutely amazing. It was cooked \"al dente\" which pasta should always be cooked. \n\nI didn't think I would have enough room in my stomach for dessert, but once I saw this specific dessert, I immediately opened up a little spot for it. I had the chocolate ganache tart, with bourbon caramel, and a toasted marshmallow. It was basically their take on s'mores. It was so rich and creamy and amazing. The marshmallow was definitely cooked perfectly. It was soft like in a s'more. The chocolate wasn't melted, but warm enough. It had a graham cracker type of crust. The bourbon caramel was amazing as well. You could definitely taste the bourbon in the caramel. It was all great compliments of each other. \n\nI would definitely come back here if I was in the area.

The ambiance is friendly and relaxed, with nice, clean, light modern decor.  It took quite a while for anyone to come greet our table, and the service throughout the lunch was pretty hands-off, to put it nicely. One of our starters was a bruschetta, which was tasty, but not what I'm used to. It was served separately, so you scooped the huge chunks of tomato onto the crostini yourself. The tomato was ripe and sweet, but I didn't taste any garlic or, well, anything but the fresh tomato. \nMy stuffed mezza luna pasta was tasty on the inside, but the pasta was beyond al dente, to the point I'd say a little hard and chewy, which was really disappointing. I would have asked for it to be replaced if any servers would have ever come to check on how the meal was going. Seems many like this place, so maybe it was an off day.

To my surprise the place wasn't very full. Almost all the two-tops were open. I sat down and we quickly decided on what we wanted to eat but it took awhile for someone to check on us. He supposedly went by before I got there. There were three servers in the place and we were able to flag down the server for our table. He took our order and then we got bread and my sparkling water. My friend had regular water and every time he needed a refill, he had to wave someone over. For whatever reason, being against the wall made it difficult for the bussers to notice us or his empty water glass. They would fill the glasses of the table next to us and not see my friend's nor come by. The food was good but not hot in temperature. We split everything and started with a small Chopped Salad. The portion was rather big so I'm glad we only got the small. It was a fresh salad and I liked the garbanzo beans mixed in. You don't often get beans in a chopped salad. They didn't give us any plates so we used the tiny bread plates. Next up was the seasonal pizza of Artichoke Hearts and Prosciutto. It was tasty but it was luke warm as was the Lamb Rigatoni. We had to ask for plates. Our server sent one thing out at a time and he changed out our last plates without us asking so that was good. I enjoyed having the salad, then pizza followed by the pasta.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-03-21", "description": "For a neo-Italian restaurant that appears to be trying hard to forge a unique identity in a city full of unique culinary establishments, Credo feels awfully like a suburban mall eatery. I think part of it has to do with the lighting. It's just too damn bright in here. The other I have to admit is the contrived leitmotif of their 3-D wall quotes, all hinging on the mantra, \"I believe...\", which is the direct translation of the restaurant's name. It's entertaining in the same way fortune cookie messages are after a hearty Cantonese meal, but maybe I have a problem seeing a quote from Gandhi on the same panel as one from Ted Kaczynski. \n\nThings started promisingly when Jamie W. and I were seated next to the front window this past Friday evening. We admired the Piet Hein Eek-designed tables with geometric designs of scrap wood and also the gunmetal flatware with the curled ends (see photo). Even our Diet Cokes came in unique sawed-off wine bottles. Upon our order, we received a small loaf of focaccia on a paddleboard with a serving of olives bathing in their oil (see photo). \n\nFor an appetizer, we shared the $15 Fondue of Wild Mushrooms, a large ramekin filled with steaming hot fontina, crescenza, and mozzarella, all melted together with black truffles and mushrooms. It came with four large crostini already buttered and sprinkled with oregano (see photo). It was easily the most delicious menu item we had that evening. It went downhill when we received our entrees. The ingredients seemed right, but something was off with both our orders. \n\nJamie went for the $20 Pappardelle with Wild Boar Ragu and Kalamata Olives (see photo). It was reasonably good but lacked distinct flavor. It just missed seasonings that could have made it more interesting than it was, a dull purplish plate of pasta. I ordered the $29 Liberty Farms Duck Breast, sliced and placed atop a pool of cranberry caponata next to a butternut squash timbale (see photo). It looked right, but it was sadly lukewarm with the cranberries too sweet to enjoy fully as a complement. Plain and simple, the dish simply lacked oomph. \n\nOur side dish was the $9 Cavolini di Bruxelles e Funghi (Brussels Sprouts with Mushrooms and Pancetta) (see photo). The sprouts were strangely undercooked save a few that looked charred as if they weren't mixed at all on the grill. The pancetta bits were near burnt, so it was left to the mushrooms to save the dish from complete disappointment. Throughout our meal, the waitress's appearances were a bit sporadic starting with a long delay before we could order. When she did come by, she was frankly on automatic pilot. I'm not sure what I believe now. \n\nFOOD - 3 stars...started strong but then flatlined in a sea of blandness \nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...too-bright lights, interesting decorative touches, plenty to read on the walls \nSERVICE - 3 stars...sporadic and then a bit snippy \nTOTAL - 3 stars...I believe....I believe....I believe they don't own a spice kit here.", "author": "Ed U."}

Great food, an attentive staff and absolutely packed on a Saturday night.  I tasted both the scallops and salmon and seriously couldn't say which was more exquisite!  A bit loud, but definitely some fantastic food.  Credo is on the map and a place I we will look forward to on every trip to San Francisco.  Big \"wow\" for Credo. \n\nWe returned to Credo with the highest expectations. Thankfully Credo was as good as we remembered. We enjoyed the porchetta pork shoulder and the chicken involtino - both were delicious.  If I had to chose, I'd say the chicken was my favorite.

The buratta honey crusting was very good. The filet mignon was a disappointment however. I asked if medium would be bloody since I did not want bloody. The waitress said it would not be bloody.

Their fresh bread with fresh olives and garlic was SO fresh and delicious!!  I easily could've stuffed my sell just on that!! Not sure why one reviewer complained the bread was bland - you're supposed to eat it with the fresh olives - if it had flavor it would've taken away from the olives and garlic!\n\nWe then ordered the Rucola salad! Oh my! LOVED the poached pears and that Cowgirl Creamery Goat cheese was PERFECT together with the baby arugula! Was VERY light on the vinaigerette which was PERFECT so we could enjoy the goat cheese with the poached pear with a \"touch\" of the vinaigerette...  I could've eaten that as a meal... there was ALOT of the goat cheese and pear - so perfect to share with my hubby.\n\nI ordered the Sedanini - LOVED the way they brought it out and it was SO DELICIOUS!!  with the baked bread on top that was seasoned so I could dip into the sauce... it was wonderful - along with the tasty homemade calabrese!!  BUT I have to say - I LOVED my hubby's dish even more!  He had the Maiale Osso Buco!!  That was HEAVENLY! so tender and flavorful with the delicious creamy polenta.   I want to go back to order that!!  The only issue my hubby had was it was too small of a serving.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Bucatini al Ragu di Maiale - and that was absoluted delicious - the noodles, sauce, meat - VERY yummy - so now I have to go a 3rd time to order that!  My other friends ordered the Raviolone aperto di pesce - and I didn't try it but both girlfriends who ordered it couldn't stop raving over it!  Because it's an open fased raviolone - they said it was like a seafood stew with pasta and they went for it with a spoon to get every morsel and sauce!!  OK.. now I need to go a 4th time!! \n\nWe had to rush off - unfortunately the kitchen was slow and we didn't get our food in enough time to run off to the Wine and Canvas - so we had to pack about half of it up.  The server was nice enough - she knew we were going to Wine and Canvas and I wished she came to check on us earlier to order - because we had to wait a bit - and then the kitchen was backed up - would've been nice to put a rush on our order...\n\nIf you go early - it's worth it - we were there as they opened so parking was a breeze and got seated fast... just took a while to take our orders and get the food but next time we'll make sure we have more time to just relax and enjoy the meal and the company.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

Furthermore, my acquaintance ordered a drink that tasted completely vile - we ended up sharing it around the table to pique everyone's palette and no one liked it.

I'm a vegetarian so I had a bite of every single one of those. The ones that stood out to me were the goat cheese and the burrata cheese. The combination of the goat cheese and the apricots on top of a slice of bread was a delicious combination! I absolutely love burrata cheese and the one at Credo was topped with honey, or some sweet syrup like that and it tasted great. I really enjoyed both of the cheeses and highly recommend them. They also serve bread and butter as a starter so you will never run out of bread to eat with the cheese.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the mushroom risotto. The server recommended that over all the other vegetarian options because he said it was the most flavorful of them all and I would agree with him that it had a multitude of flavors. There were large mushrooms and some green vegetables mixed in with the risotto and the whole dish was topped with some tasty herbs. I really enjoyed it and recommend it!\n\nEven though my stomach was full beyond words, we decided to order 3 desserts to share for the table: the creme brulee, the chocolate ganache, and the pot de creme. The creme brulee was served warm with fresh berries on top and was so delicious! The chocolate ganache was made with very rich chocolate and had a whipped cream topping - the combination of the rich and light flavors made it extremely satisfying. Lastly, this was my first time trying pot de creme and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I am a huge caramel lover so that might be part of the reason, but it tasted like a less heavy caramel custard (I enjoyed the texture of this more than that of caramel custard). \n\nAll in all, we had a great time at Credo, but just a tip, this place does get a little pricey if you want to go all out.

We arrived a bit early and was seated right by the cash register when there was another two person table right next to it. The lady who prepared our table was very warm but the other guy in the gray suit was very pretentious! Eh! \n\nThis place reminds me of a nicer, fancier, more hip diner. The kitchen was open to the dining area. I actually hated this. This isn't Korean BBQ! I smelled after eating there. The decor is very hip and modern. They had quotes on the walls in these vibrant colors. \n\nIt took the waiter a bit to introduce himself. AND they ran out the soup on the Dine About Town Menu. It was like 12.30 for god's sake! How can you run out of the soup?!\n\nFirst Course\nCredo \"Misticanza\" Salad with Chianti Vinaigrette - What a cheap way to have a fixe price menu. It was just some lettuce and some bits of carrots tossed in a vinaigrette. I could have made this.  \n\nSecond Course\nSeared Skirt Steak with Roast Potatoes, Beet Greens, and Natural Jus - Medium rare. Nothing special about this dish. It was what it was. Good but not amazing. Being Chinese I love veggies, I think they assume most of their customers don't like greens so their Beet Greens was over-seasoned. Overpowered the taste of the greens. \n\nCredo Lasagna with Bechamel and Bolognese - My friend ordered this. Sadly to say, this was the first time I tried Lasagna. It was good but I would not pay 17 dollars for lasagna. My friend enjoyed it but like my steak it was good but not amazing. \n\nThe bathroom is down two flights of stairs. One men and one women. Very very plain bathrooms. Clean though. \n\nI would not be coming back, the experience wasn't horrible, it was just very mediocre. Our waters was refilled in the beginning of our dining experience but neglected the second half. I rather spend my money somewhere else.", "author": "Sarah C."}

I was looking to have some seafood and thought hey, would like to have some linguini with clams and as a bonus find some place with octopus and voila! Credo had both and had open reservations on OT. \n\nTo start, we had the octopus and brussel sprouts appetizer. To my surprise, my honey LOOOOOVED this dish. I am usually the octopus fanatic but he loved it so much, he commented that he would bring his foodie friends to come try it. It's got a nice char on it and saut\u00e9ed with a bit of a kick to it. Would go great with beer but I didn't wish to drink that night so couldn't tell you from experience but some day I plan to! \n\nWe also had the buttermilk fried asparagus - very nice! Breading was light and not greasy, aioli was lemony and refreshing to offset the fried aspect. \n\nFor entrees, I had the seafood linguini with tomato based sauce which was tasty with perfectly cooked pasta. My hubby had the garganelli with chicken/proscuitto meatballs and he enjoyed it very much. I had a bite and it was perfectly cooked al dente and loved those english peas! All we can say is that every plate was eaten clean! Nothing left behind. \n\nEven though we were full, we managed to squeeze in some gelato! Our waiter recommend the caramel salted gelato and it was fantastic. \n\nWhat a wonderful neighborhood gem for the financial district! We will definitely be back for more! For sure, he will be for that octopus!", "author": "Kuishingal F."}

The drinks took forever to come out even though the restaurant was pretty empty. The waitress also gave my drink to the wrong person. We were hungry and asked for some of the bread and it was pretty mediocre. Just un-toasted french bread with butter.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the burrata and the octopus with brussel sprouts.

Instead, I had the orecchiette, which was a very basic pasta with marinara sauce. I told my boyfriend that I could even make this (and I don't cook). The pasta tasted fine. I really liked the texture, it was hard and chewy. And I guess it's partly my fault for not ordering something that was more interesting. Portion sizes were pretty small. My boyfriend was still hungry after having his clam linguine dish.\n\nLater, we brought in a cake for our friend's birthday and they charged a $3/slice cutting fee for that.

We had an early lunch reservation for 4, and the restaurant was practically empty when we walked in (around 11:15 on a weekday). The table bread was good, but not great. We had the burrata as an appetizer, and I loved it. Great idea drizzling it in honey! There was a lot of cheese, easily enough to feed 3-4 people, unless you have a major cheese addiction. 4.5 stars for this dish!\n\nFor my main I was torn between the pizza special of the month (I remember that it had gorganzola and pears), and the bucatini. With the cold weather that has been rolling through recently, I went with the pasta thinking that a warm heavy dish would match the weather well. The restaurant has huge front windows, so it felt a little drafty. When my pasta came, it seemed like it had been sitting out for a bit - very room temp. The portion size was not huge, although after my round of burrata I was still only able to eat half. For an italian restaurant having only so-so pasta, I'd give 2 stars. The sauce was good, but I was underwhelmed. \n\nService was a mixed bag - really great with the water refills, but our waiter was slow to take orders and change out the courses.

After that second round, for some reason, the mixologist offered us a complimentary third round of drinks (!!!), but I was pretty buzzed by that point (their drinks are STRONG!), so I didn't get anything.

Some might say that the quotes are lame, but I think it is a nice touch, especially \"feed the people.\" Another plus would be the open kitchen which I have always been an avid fan of. Not only is it fun to watch the chefs put on a show, but also you know the kitchen will be much cleaner since everyone can look in. \n\nMoving onto food after ordering we were given complimentary bread; I would like to say it was french bread. It was presented on a simple wood board with salted butter. The bread, this is a weird comment, was really inconsistent because some slices seemed fresh and had a nice crunch while others seemed a day old. Also unfortunately it came out room temperature.. lame. Well to start my meal I ordered the kale salad which was accompanied by some oranges, carrots, and watermelon radishes all dressed up in a citrus vinaigrette. Believe I am no expert in salad, but I know a bad one when I have one. It was literally just some vegetables thrown on a mound with a little bit of dressing. It did not have any real flavor and honestly I could have an 8 year old do the same thing if given the ingredients. I was afraid that the meal would only get worse, but I was delighted by my main entree when it came out. I ordered the king salmon which sat atop a bed of potatoes, asparagus, chard, and was topped with a salsa rustica. The dish was nice and light with all the garnishes cooked and seasoned well. The cook on the salmon was delightful and had nice flavor especially when eaten with the salsa rustica. The \"salsa\" added a nice savory element to the dish and I gobbled all of it up quickly. For dessert I ordered the vanilla bean panna cotta with strawberries and cookie crumbs. The panna cotta was very good not being very sweet and the vanilla flavor really came through. Strawberries were a little sour in my opinion, but the cookie crumbs did add a nice little change in texture which was pleasant. The sauce that came with the panna cotta was a tad bit sweet so I didnt really bother eating it. \n\nOur server was nice and friendly when he came by, but I felt was not super knowledgeable and did not seem to really give us much attention. An old teacher joined me for dinner and we finished the bread relatively quickly. From that time, about ten minutes, to the time we got our appetizers he did not once visit our table thus we were left with an empty wooden board that took up 1/4 of the table. Also I thought there were nuts on the panna cotta before clarification and asked our waiter about it. He thought there was only to come back a couple minutes later telling us it was cookie crumbs. It is my personal conviction that if you work in the restaurant business, you need to know what you are serving otherwise you make yourself look bad and the customer skeptical about the establishment. \n\nAll in all a nice modern italian restaurant. I would only go back to try a pizza possibly, but most likely not because of the tons of other great restaurants that my money can eaten by. Prices are a bit much, but what can you do since after all it is downtown San Francisco. \n\nFood: 3.5/5 Salmon was the only highlight\nAmbiance: 3.5/5 Nice quotes, radio in the bathroom is weird though\nService: 2.5/5 Figure the menu out please", "author": "Mitchell L."}

The highlight of the meal was the \"Gnocchi al cinghiale\": potato and olive gnocchi, wild boar ragu, and hazelnuts. I have dined with but never eaten a boar before, and it was truly outstanding. I asked where it came from and the waitress said it is raised in a natural habitat around Petaluma.

I asked the bartender what the difference was between them. He gave a brief explanation but then said the bar manager would be able to explain better.

We arrived early for a 7pm reservation and were seated immediately by the very pleasant host (who must have been the GM of the front of house manager).

That said it has good energy and it's still possible to chat... just not the place for a quiet dinner.\n\nThe wine list was short and sweet... I like to see some of the less typical Italian wines get some exposure and they had a couple of whites that you are starting to see but still don't get the cred they deserve.  My dining partner had not ever tried Friulano so the host very kindly brought her a taste (which she loved) and then quickly brought the bottle after he got the thumbs up.\n\nThe dinner menu like the wine list is pretty simple but very yummy.

I believe this was our second spot for the afternoon/evening. We ordered a cocktail and a glass of wine, we only got wine. We ordered some happy hour snacks, which really are just 1 bite each (and that for the price of $6-$8 is not really \"happy hour\" in my opinion). The snacks were tasty, however, there are so many better happy hour places in the area that I wouldn't go here for happy hour.\n\nThe decoration however of the place is very neat. Good quotes on the wall and everything is made from recycable material. Glasses are made of wine bottles :-)", "author": "Helen D."}

Called around to my final choices (of which Credo was one), and the reservationist at one of the places (which I won't name) practically laughed at me over the phone.  I know he was thinking (just as I thought many times while taking rez's), \"Party of 10 on a Friday, before the first turn is over?  Hahahaha! What a fool!\"  Needless to say, the person I asked at Credo, cheerfully said, \"Let me take a look.... Could you do 7:45?\"  Yes!  \n\nOne of the big deciding factors in choosing this restaurant was that they were serving one of my favorite dishes (I wait to eat this someplace at least once a year) - butternut squash ravioli.  YUM!  So all the non-vegetarians would have to fend for themselves, I was focused on one dish, and one dish only!  \n\nWhen I got to Credo, my bf was already waiting at the bar.  I joined him, and the bartender nicely let me test a few wines before choosing one (picky, picky).  Our table was ready early, and once more of our party arrived, we closed out with the bartender and made our way towards our long table.\n\nOur server promptly took over, although I never got her name, or a friendly intro before she was asking for app and drink orders....that part was a bit of a disappointment.  But, as far as I took notice, she was quick to keep everyone's glass full. \n\nFor apps, the table shared the hummus plate, the bison, and the bread & olives.  All were good and got eaten.\n\nWe drank plenty of wine, but the only bottle I recall was the Robert Mondavi (?), which seemed to be a hit all around the table.  \n\nMy meal was excellent.  My boyfriend ordered his lamb chops med-rare, but I saw they came out more med-well (there was almost no pink).  He said they were \"ok\" though.  Everyone said their food was good, but I don't think anyone was over-the-top impressed.\n\nMy waitress presented me with a little choc lava cake at the end (phoned in from my sis in Oregon) :)  They apparently close at 10pm, which seems very early to me (this is SF!  Even Seattle doesn't roll up that early!), but I noticed our server began doing side work staring at us.  We left around 10:30, so its not like we were still chatting at midnight or something.  \n\n4 stars because they fit us in, and kept the wine coming, and apps and entrees came out very promptly.\n\nNot 5 stars because I don't feel like our server connected with us at all, wasn't very friendly, and seemed kind of pissed at the end of the night (yes, she did get her grat, btw).\n\nBottom line....My celebration was wonderful which made an extra star.  As for the restaurant itself...I would like to go back with just one or two other people and see if the service is better.", "author": "Anna S."}

On the back of the menu it's like a news paper, which was quite interesting. The kitchen is a open kitchen and on top it read \"feed the people.\" The tables are created with bits and parts of old wood pieces from scrapped parts. The water glass we had was an actual wine bottle that was remade into a glass cup. I thought that was pretty awesome. Way to go green guys!!  \n\nMy highlight of the day was the food, well mainly one dish, the RAVIOLI RIPIENI - Braised short rib Ravioli/brunoise vegetables/braising jus, it was so delicious, the sauce was to die for. I also had the PETTO D' ANATRA - Seared Duck Breast/butternut squash timbale/cranberry caponata, this was good but the cranberry sauce was too much for me, it was too strong for my taste. The duck was cooked perfectly and the butternuts squash puree was delicious, but the portion was a bit too much. My boyfriend had order the special of the day, the Fillet Mignon topped with Foie gras on a bed of fingerling potatoes and string beans. The Fillet Mignon was cooked perfectly and seasoned well; personally I liked my boyfriends dish more then the duck dish.\n\nI would give it all 5 stars but my duck plate wasn't as good as I was expecting it to be, maybe it because I've had better.

There is no comparison. Zero.\n\nIt's a hackneyed menu of more than bloody awful food that tries to box out of its class by papering the walls and menus with feel good quotes or statements of belief from secular saints. Feel unimpressed by the barely cooked pasta with tomato sauce? It's OK, there's a nice quote on the walls from Anne Frank (let's think about this for a moment - a Holocaust victim's comments are appropriated by a mediocre restaurant selling spaghetti). Feeling underwhelmed by the practically inedible chunks o' tuna sitting on a bed of arugula sitting on a bed of something else that nobody at the table can eat? With un-ironic melon balls? It's OK because there's an inspiring idea from Teddy Roosevelt and Bobby Kennedy right above you. Or Picasso. Or Mother Theresa Or God knows who else.\n\nThis isn't food. It's Grade A piping hot bullshit. The staff knows it and is half ashamed of it. A customer with narcolepsy and dead taste buds would know it in 10 seconds. And the chef (Gustavo Romero) should be ashamed of himself - the idea that anything happening here is the result of 'creative juxtapositions' is an insult. A Cuban sandwich? A mixed green side salad? Penne and sausage? Do you think we're a bunch of rubes who just came over the fricking bridge from nowhere and haven't eaten in a restaurant before?  \n\nI feel sorry for the people who work here.

The pasta was OK, the sauce was just too rich for us. \n\n-  Fetuccine Classiche alla Bolognese - this sauce was so nice, well flavor & perfect.\n\n- Tagliata di Manzo - grilled Painted Hills NY steak, sliced 7 served over roasted gold potato & wilted baby spinach - nice portion, the steak was tender, juicy & cooked to my liking. Of course, it's my dish, because I can't have any carb after 6:30 PM! Ordered my Richard T ;-)\n\n- Torta di Ciccolato - flour-less! Very nice & I don't don't feel guilty at all haha!\n\n- Bailey's was perfect to end the meal.\n\n            Amanda, our server was very nice & attentive, explained very well of every dishes that we ordered.

It's not really 5 star food, but a good 4 stars and 5 star service. I rounded up again - but they deserve it. \n\nThe SHORT: \nThe food is quality, tasty and fresh; the price is fair; the staff is AWESOME! Lovely seating, attentive servers, and quick to go service. \n\nThe MORE detailed: \n\nTO GO: \n5 stars for food to go! I called in my order because I can't leave my desk today, and received an enthusiastic male voice. I asked how long it would take for a Ciabatta Pollo and he said - 5 MINUTES - score! It took me longer to get out the door, but when I did, I had all of 10 steps to take to theirs. My bag was sitting right at the door alongside a well dressed smiling gentleman. Yeah, I like it when people smile at me! \n\nThe first thing this man did right was CARD ME- THANK YOU A.J! You know, the back of my VISA says \"See ID\" and people rarely ask for my ID. What if my CC had been stolen? Kudos to AJ! \n\nThe second thing he did right was apologize for his establishment not carrying ketchup - upon my request. He did offer to go get me ketchup next door, after I expressed my disbelief. I told him it was cool, didn't need the high-fructose anyway. Yo, he was seriously about to go get me some ketchup though - so sweet - made me feel like a VIP. \n\nThe last thing he did right was tell me to come back soon - he wasn't being fresh, just genuinely nice. I could just tell he likes working there or he knows I am a VIP lol. I'll go back. I got their menu and there are many good looking options. \nFOOD \nCiabatta con Pollo: \nIt's the end of the day on Friday, and I absolutely reek of garlic from my pesto... I don't care though cause it complemented my buffalo mozzarella, perfectly grilled chicken breast and warm ciabatta roll perfectly. \n\nFries: OK, not fries, \"fried parmesan potatoes\" I know why they don't carry ketchup, cause their fries don't need it. However, IMHO, any place that serves fries/fried potatoes should carry ketchup - I'm justsayin I would like the option to ruin your potatoes with ketchup. \n\nDINING IN: \nWhen Credo first opened, I dined in and the food was good. I couldn't get a table without a reservation, but they offered me and my friend a counter seat - which worked out well for me! I was perched up high enough to look up in everyone else's plate; and, me being a seasoned drinker, I was very impressed with their liquor selection i.e Clase Azul aka \"brandy like sipping tequila.\" When I ordered it, the bartender got excited because no one ever orders this special tequila with their Italian food. I say tequila with everything - but that's just me. She agreed! I've had this for $12 - $18 a shot, I think it's $12 there... maybe $14. \n\nThe grilled salmon was a little undercooked for my liking, but I sent it back and they gave me a bigger and better cooked fillet - that's wassup. After the shot, I got a lil chatty and the bartender invited us to their tax day event - I couldn't make it but it was cool idea - cheap happy hour to drink the paying pain away! \n\nThey serve focaccia with fresh olives and olive oil for dine in: the olive oil for dipping reminded me of the fresh pressed goodness I get from my favorite Italian spot in Mill Valley - not all olive oil taste like this - it's a treat!", "author": "Rayna A."}

Tonight, for the first time in my life and apparently for the first time in the life of the hostess, my party was asked to move, as we had just received our coffees, to make way for a larger party.  She was relatively gracious about it, but it was still unwelcome. We had reservations so we weren't a surprise to their seating plan. \n\nThe service up to this point was ok, but below average.  Our server looked visibly displeased when our out of town guest with english as a second language took some time with the menu. As we debated an appetizer, rather than attempt to help us (uh, it's your job right?), she advised she'd leave us to our musings while she would be elsewhere.  \n\nSo food was city ok, service passable, making Credo nothing special. Try other options; There is so much better out there.", "author": "Chris L."}

Started off with a nice cocktail consisting of some bourbon and absinthe, hoping for that magical green absinthe fairy to show up. Damn, that was just a myth. Our group split yummy calamari with a very light, flaky breading. We also split a pizza, which was solid. I ordered the special of the day, which was a cod with a tomato-based sauce. This was good, but not \"amazing\". My friends, however, had a couple of awesome entrees. One got the breaded pork chop, which was a ginormous piece of pork, breaded and fried, and covered in clarified butter. Mmmm butter! The other got a very good macaroni pasta dish, topped with pizza-dough and baked in an oven. The pasta was cooked al dente, slightly firm and just the way I like it, and was absolutely delicious.\n\nWe went a little overboard with the desserts and ordered 3 different kinds. A warm flourless chocolate cake (which they have at just about every other restaurant I've been to), a stuffed pasta brise with ice cream covered in chocolate, and a custard creme. They were all very good and needless to say, we devoured all three things down to the crumbs.\n\n\n\nEven the freak rainstorm that hit us on our way out of the restaurant didn't ruin this meal! I'll definitely be returning here again soon.", "author": "Kazu O."}

Everyone took time to say a sincere hello, including the owner and the chef.  We were there for Valentine's Day, and definitely felt taken care of.  We were also excited to try an off-the-radar new restaurant.\n\nThe interior is so cleverly designed with \"credos\" from various famous people on the walls.  This makes for interesting dinner conversation and has a great modern look, along with the cool tables.  But then - the dishware and flatware are straight from the 80's, which is distracting and dated...like, wait, is this the same restaurant?\n\nThe food, unfortunately, was more in tune with the dishware.  A bit dated.  My favorite dish was the Veal Meatballs, but the Fritto Misto was a bit heavy with a too-thick sauce (and a too-small plate! argh!), the Margherita pizza was bland, the pasta was obviously homemade and had great flavor, but was too thick and gummy (like grocery-store bought pasta), and the pork milanese was much too thick, rather than pounded thin.  Desserts were ok but not that memorable.\n\nThe vibe they are going for is rustic Italian, and what I got was stylized Italian.  I'd actually love to see it be more rustic - some burn marks on the pizza, some spice, simple white plates, thin thin pasta, hearty meaty sauces, that kind of thing.\n\nTo conclude, I believe that would go again for lunch, but probably not for a destination dinner.", "author": "Liz S."}

But the look and feel of this place just screamed gimmick.  On a Friday night it was quite dead, and parking available right in front of the restaurant.  \n\nThe menu here is typical California cuisine, nothing special or inventive and the dishes unfortunately are quite forgetable.  We started with the calamari which were in a very good tomato sauce, but the calamari themselves were very chewy to the point of overwhelming.\n\nFor the main courses we got the veal and steak.  While they were good, they weren't great, the sides were just OK, something we make at home and it didn't add to the dish except in color.  The potatoes were quite salty as well.  \n\nAll an all, we were not impressed and even less so with the price tag of $150 for a dinner that was quite average.  I'm sure this is a nice place to take a client out to lunch and expense the tab but not for a foodie dinner.

I was meeting someone for dinner who I had not seen in more than 20 years. We had ended our friendship kind of badly so this was kind of a tense situation. We finally reconnected via Facebook, and when she came to SF, I chose Credo as a dinner place, mostly because I knew about all the quotes on the wall, and figured that would give us something to talk about in case conversation wasn't that scintillating. \n\nWhen I walked in, I was greeted by the chef who was looking through the night's reservations. A hostess quickly came over and after I identified myself said my guest was waiting for me. I recognized her right away, and we had a big hugging session and some tears. She had clued the server on to our reunion, and the server was a complete doll and very solicitous of us all night. \n\nThe food was fantastic! The bread was chewy and warm and accompanied by delicious olives. I had a wonderful ahi tuna steak that was prepared with capers, anchovies and I can't remember what else. My friend had ravioli stuffed with peas and feta, and again, it was fantastic! We were too busy drinking wine to order dessert, but what passed by looked pretty damn good. \n\nThanks, Credo, for making what would've been an awkward dinner into a great, friendly reunion..

This evening my husband and I had a party of ten friends plus out of town guests with and so having a good experience was very important.   We got a lovely big table by the window so plenty of room and somewhat private from dining with the fray.   From first bite to end the quality of food on all dishes was exceptional.   Squash blossoms and buratta were great.  Main courses the gnocchi tagliatelle and pork shoulder were standouts.   Desserts were classics created with care and excuding flavor.   All that being said when we first arrived it took 15 minutes to get a cocktail and service seemed sluggish on drinks.   Our waiter was very good but he could not control this.  It seemed that there were senior staff hanging at the bar but not paying a ton of attention.  So I discreetly brought this to the attention of said staff and they took my well intentioned feedback very well.

This was my first real meal (consisting of something other than candy, pastries, or horrible chicken--long story involving an ill-advised tour of the Mission/Tenderloin districts) in San Francisco. The minestrone (soup of the day) was a little bland--the fresh pepper added in was a bit weird given the other flavors in the soup--but had rice, beans, and other good vegetables. It seemed nutritious, which was what I was looking for after a few days of pizza, chicken nuggets, and pastries.\n\nA cute Asian couple walked in and the lady was looking at me and talking to a man who I assume was her husband. I thought she needed me to move in so that she could pull out her chair but when I looked at her, I realized she was talking about the soup. Moments later, she ordered the minestrone too. (So I guess it looked good or I looked like I was really enjoying it.)\n\nI thought the complimentary bread and olives were a nice touch. The bread was perfectly seasoned with oil, salt, and rosemary. It was also interesting to see a salt accompaniment instead of butter/oil. I liked the fact that some of the olives were pitted. GATC (see my other reviews) has fantastic warmed olives, but it's a little awkward to be in company saving pits in your mouth or trying to gracefully slip them out of your mouth into a spoon. Still a few of the olives had pits. I ate them anyway--I was alone so I didn't care what I looked like.\n\nYou should know that only salads, soup, and appetizers are served between 2:30pm and 5:00pm. Other reviews seem to have indicated that there is a lunch rush. Maybe the buzz died down because when I got there at 2:30pm, the place was pretty empty (servers outnumbered diners). \n\nIt's worth noting that the restaurant is almost directly across from the SF Stock Exchange and has a beautifully appointed window facing the street. I liked the fact that there were a lot of tables--I  am not a fan of the communal dining set-up favored by a lot of new restaurants. The ladies restroom in the basement was spacious and clean. I seldom try a new place without scoping out the restaurant inspection report. Credo hasn't been inspected yet (at least I couldn't find the report) but it seems very clean.

It feels like a good spot for a biz dinner, probably due to its location firmly in the Financial District. I've had consistently good service here both at the bar and seated at a table, and the food is tasty. I don't know that they switch up their menu often enough - I visited two separate occasions close to a year apart and I thought the menu looked exactly the same. Perhaps the pasta dish with pizza dough baked on top stood out, because it's so unique.\n\nThe pizza was delightful, baked perfectly with airy bubbles but I wouldn't have missed the squash. We also had the burratta appetizer and I'll be damned if it wasn't some of the most delicious burratta I've had in a while. I enjoyed the gnocchi ragu as well, though the gnocchi itself was a bit thick and floury.\n\nThe bartender mixed my friend an incredible Dimmi Collins, but I am really put off by the price of wines per glass. $8 for a mediocre montepulciano and $15! for a glass of pinot noir. Combined with the price of the food I can't say that I'd make this a regular weeknight stop, because while the experience is lovely, it's still pricey for what you get. 3.75 stars.", "author": "Lisa P."}

We're talking 17-20 for a \"first plate\" and 20-35 for a \"second plate\", although you typically don't have to order both! So, come in expecting to get a 10-15 dollar appetizer, 20 dollar plate, then drinks (and perhaps dessert).\n\nI'm glad I wasn't put off by the price though since the food was great! My girlfriend and I ordered the rucola (arugula) salad and the saladini (pasta served in a bowl that is covered with pizza dough - think of \"Italian pot pie\"). I also got to try my friend's risotto and brussels sprouts. The food was very good - Italian inspired but certainly not totally authentic. But that's okay, I like to see a spin on it. My only critiques: the risotto wasn't a star (definitely some hints of Mac 'n' Cheese flavor in it) and the decision to leave the sage in the saladini dish lead to one unfortunate bite. Other than that, I left absolutely satisfied. Portions were good - the saladini is enough to share, especially with a side of the brussels sprouts.\n\nService was good - no problems here. In fact, we had arrived around 8 and they close at 9. Although we didn't end up leaving until 920, when the chefs had been long gone, they never rushed us and took their time putting things away for the day without ever giving us the impression that we were imposing.\n\nThat's not to mention the good music selection and fun atmosphere. I'm glad our party of 6 couldn't be served at Barbacco, because this place was legit!", "author": "Kellen F."}

I live to describe this place as simple food made really well.   I love the spicy olives in chili oil with focaccia.  Its actually spicy and tastes amazing with bread.  And that's just the free part of the meal.  I had their Fungi Pizza, Penne in Spicy Tomato Sauce, Fritto Misto, and Mixed greens with Prosciutto wrapped Shrimp in a grape dressing.  \n\nEverything was delicious.  I didn't have the prosciutto wrapped shrimp but the dressing to the salad was really good.  The fritto misto was also very tasty with shaved veggies, shrimp and calamari.  The stand out for me was the Fungi Pizza.  It was delicious.  I mean honestly, who doesn't like truffle oil?  The pizza also had black fungus which is something i've never seen outside of asian cooking.  I added an bite to the pizza that you wouldn't usually get.  LOVED IT!!  The spicy penne was also really tasty and just perfectly done considering how simple it was.  \n\nOther than the food, everything was great.  I liked the decor, atmosphere and service.

I ordered the gnocchi, I know we had a linguini and clam order, a rigatoni in ragu, and noodles with salmon. Everybody at the table was pleased with their food.

You go down a flight of stairs and you're lead into this room.  Weird, but still nicely decorated.\n\nWe ordered the pizza and it was quite delicious. On a flatbread, so thin crust, good amount of cheese and ingredients.  Best of all, it was HUGE.  I am glad we ordered it as an appetizer.\n\nI had the pasta and it was not bad. The spicy sauce had a pretty good taste to it.  \n\nFriends tried their sandwiches and they said it tastes better than Barbacco's, so I guess I will order their sandwiches next time.  \n\nThe only thing that was missing from this restaurant is lack of service.  Waiter came, took order, and we never saw them again.  We were generally left to the service of the bus boys, which they did their job, but still, no checking back to see if the food were ok.  Also, they didn't give us plates for the pizza. We had to use our tiny plate that usually holds the bread/butter.  \n\nNow that I think about it, should've just tipped 10% instead of the 18%.

My fiance and I booked Credo for our Rehearsal Dinner since it is part of our wedding venue company (Merchants Exchange Building) and couldn't wait to try some of the menu items.  We went there for a date night and were blown away by the food, service and the atmosphere.  We really ate so don't judge us but we ordered 2 appetizers, 2 salads, 2 dinners and 2 desserts - we wanted to try options for our rehearsal guests :).  Everything we ate was just as delicious as the plate before it.  We did the meatballs and warm goat cheese appetizers and we could have licked both plates because they were so good.  My fiance had the green salad and I did the spinach - the spinach salad would be something worth going back for over and over again.  We did the steak and the garganelli - the garganelli deserves its own yelp review because it was mind blowing.  I wanted to push my fiance out of the way and eat it all myself.  We both took our first bite and said that this was a choice for the rehearsal dinner.  The whole time we were stuffing our faces the manager and staff made sure to answer our questions, give food recommendations and tell us about the restaurant.  Even though we both were grossly full, we couldn't pass us the caramel pot and chocolate grenache.  INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!! I am not even a dessert person and we were fighting over bites.  It was definitely one of the best meals I have had in a long time.  The manager Scott was the most gracious host and took me down to see the private room we booked and gave me ideas of how to set up tables, decorate etc.  We left there feeling like royals with stuffed bellies and anxiously awaiting our event.  We couldn't have had a better experience here and plan to bring friends back soon.  It is the perfect place for a date night or small group, there are plenty of food choices and the service is some of the best in San Francisco.  Go there!", "author": "Arica V."}

The pizza was quite good, though it wasn't quite what I expected. I expected it to be Neapolitan-style:  thin, crispy, and lightly cheesed (it's a word according to my browser's spell-checker). It was relatively thin, but not too crispy and quite a bit of cheese. None of those things were problems; in fact, I appreciated the extra cheese since the quality was so high.\n\nThe scallop dish was also quite good. The scallops were perfectly seared, and the risotto was quite tasty.

Ok, who am I to kid, it's not like I don't drink wine with lunches too...\n\nThere's something to be said about sharing a good plate of veggies and calamari with a girlfriend at lunch, even better if fried.

The margherita, you can't go wrong with, but the rustica just wasn't hitting the spot for me. I think the cheese was smoked last time, and for my tastes, it just didn't blend well with the other flavors. They are great to share, typical CA thin THIN crust but full of flavor, and really don't weigh you down. Unless of course, you eat the whole damn thing.\n\nThe penne with spicy red sauce and fresh mozzarella is a simple, yet satisfying dish, done well and a little too easy to keep shoveling in your mouth.

I especially love how intimately and well decorated their banquet room downstairs by the bathroom is set-up.  Seems like an excellent place to hold a big group event.  \n\nI digress.  Onward ho to the food.  Between my dinner date and I we both shared a cured meats plate.  The pickled veggies were delish but sadly the only thing I really truly enjoyed here.  For entrees, she had a pasta dish and I had the seafood risotto special.  The portion sizing is definitely on the \"don't wear a belt to dinner\" side comparatively speaking for this price range, so you can certainly get some bang for the buck there considering their entrees are mostly $20+.  That being said, I find their food mediocre.  I found the risotto very heavy and lacking some zest and after trying the pasta I thought it was good, but nothing really special.  \n\nCreative dining d\u00e9cor meets average Italian food at fine dining Italian food prices?

We came in at a perfect time (around 6pm) because happy hour was still valid and we can order from the dinner menu. Happy hour consisted of few cocktails for $5 and small plates for $8. We decided to try two small plates and split a main entree. We asked our server/bartender if that is enough to feed us and she confidently said definitely.\n\nThis is what we ordered: \n\nSmall plates-\nPici Toscano: heavenly. You can taste slight gaminess with mix of bison, veal, beef, and pork while the pasta is so fresh it was perfectly chewy. The fried kale really made it pop and savory. \nBurrata Crostini: If you've never had this before, you will love it. Bread, caramelized onions, fried kale, aged balsamic, and Burrata. YUM\n\nEntree-\nPainted Hills New York Strip: This one really surprised us. pan-seared foie gras, two cuts of of meat, brioche toast with balsamic. You have to try to really know what I mean by surreal delicacy. \n\nOverall, this place shocked me on how magnificent and filling their \"small plates\" were (I was thinking tapas size but it's more like appetizer size!) as well as excellent customer service and quality of entrees. Not to mention great ambiance with quotes striking intriguing conversations. I will be coming back!\n\nQuick tip: MUST eat for happy hour. You can get away feeding two people happily with 3 small plates with a $25 bill. Not only that but the food is incredible. 2:30-6:30pm Mon-Fri. See you there.", "author": "Johanna P."}

They were very accommodating and changed our reservation over so that we could still get the points, and they seated us immediately.\n\nThe Host really couldn't have been better.\n\nWe brought our own bottle of wine and it was quickly opened and decanted for us.\n\nFor appetizers we split the Pork belly (DIVINE - just melt in your mouth quality) and the fonduta.  Both really were excellent, and have probably helped this place in getting 4 stars and not 3.\nMy only qualm is that our bread and olives were brought out when we were almost halfway through our apps instead of before our order being taken.  But, not that a big of a deal in the grand scheme of things.\n\nFor entrees we had the Funghi pizza, the prosciutto pizza and the pork ravioli.\n\nThe pizza's really were big we probably could have shared one and had one other entree between the three of us and it would have been enough.  Out of all the entrees the prosciutto pizza was a tad disappointing; I'm not sure if my expectations were too high, but it was just a very basic pizza with huge strips of prosciutto on and spinach and other greens on top.  The dough could have been cooked for a minute longer and the prosciutto could have been sliced into lsightly smaller pieces, and the greens on top, good, but just too overwhelming.  It didn't look like a pizza made with a lot of love.  Eating it was also difficult as the prosciutto had not been fully sliced on the pizza, so it kinda came off in one glob.  It wouldn't have been hard to slice it properly and/or give me a proper knife to cut it properly.\n\nAt the end of the meal we had more or less a whole prosciutto pizza left (I only ate one slice and hubby had one) half a plate of port ravioli, and 3 slices of the Funghi pizza.  I guess the wine had kinda hit our heads by then, because despite asking to have it wrapped, we totally forgot and left the restaurant without our leftover :(  We only realized when we were getting off bart in the east bay, and of course it was too late by then.  \n\nThat's why I took a couple of days to make sure I write a fair review, I circled in with hubby and girlfriend and they confirmed that we were sat at the able for about 15-20 minutes after they cleared our food finishing our wine and chatting.  That meant that they had plenty of time to bring our doggy bags to us; of course we could have asked but out of site out of mind.  So, one star goes there.

The food lived up to expectations. We ordered an Affumicata pizza (basically a pizza with chicken, roasted garlic, kalamata olives, pecorino fresco, and caramelized onions). The crust is thin with generous amount of toppings and the taste/smell of cheese is not overpowering. The decor is modern and area is rather spacious considering it's a restaurant smacked in the middle of FiDi.   \n\nWhat I was *not* expecting was the service. My friend and I sat down and the waitress immediately asked us if we were ready to order and we barely got our menus so we said we needed a minute. Lo and behold, she returned in exactly one minute! Alright, so we told her we need a few minutes....and when we were ready to order she was nowhere to be found.

Truthfully, I was looking for a different restaurant in the area I found on Yelp but the aromas coming within pulled me in. Since it was crowded I sat at the bar. The bartender was really warm and friendly. when we were seated we were provided with warm baked bread and olives. (Note: I am a fan of olives. I mean I got olive t-shirts and key chains --no just kidding but I do love a good olive)  and hummus. The hummus was delicious and made from scratch, the olives & garlic were the kinda things legends are made of. So, I can say I was most impressed  - - but I think you get the picture. \nI ordered the chicken (which was just melt in your mouth good) I noted several people around me had ordered the chicken as well, I wish I could say it was the most popular item on the menu but....wait there's something else. My boyfriend ordered the steak with Bone Marrow,,,now if you have never tried bone marrow before, do yourself a favor &  open yourself up to the experience. And if its your first time, do  it at Credo!   All I can say about the bone marrow is... I would never had thought there would be a time when I would want to lick a bone clean & in public no less....but I have meet that time and I meet it at Credo. It was delicious. I have nothing to compare it to because it was my first time trying bone marrow, but, I imagine I have experienced it at the highest level.  I  noted that apparently everyone in the place knew about the bone marrow but me. The steak was quite literally flying out of the kitchen.  \nIn summary , Yes Credo is definitely winning!

This year, he let me do the choosing and after a little searching, I found Credo. \n\nThis is a very untraditional Italian restaurant. Yes, there's pasta and pizza, but there are so many other items on the menu that it's way beyond what I was expecting. We ordered tuna capraccio to start, then I had the seafood risotto and the bf had steak. \n\nThe capraccio wasn't too fishy (for me-- he thought it was), and came with thinly sliced cucumbers that were a perfect combination when I got both on my fork. The risotto was fantastic; it was a little milky which I've never seen before, but it worked. It comes with clams, mussels, calamari and shrimp. I reaffirmed my dislike for clams, but otherwise the seafood was amazing and there was definitely a lot of it. The bf's steak was also very good, though I thought it was a bit cold. \n\nI noticed the menu has hummus and rosemary foccacia as an appetizer; not sure why that's there because they serve you the foccacia with a side of olives, and hummus is more for Mediterranean restaurants, so I am glad we didn't order that. The bread is damn good though, so I'm glad you get it!\n\nOh and drinks! I got a glass of wine which I wasn't too in love with...some white wine the waiter recommended but honestly, I should have taken the \"sorry, no Reisling by the glass\" information to heart. The bf, on the other hand, ordered this absolutely amazing cocktail off the menu: it's the one at the top of the list that has elderflower liquor and limoncello in it....like spiked lemonade! Luckily he let me take several sips.\n\nLastly, we ordered dessert. A rare occassion in our dining excursions because we are always too full, but the wine soaked pear was totally worth it and just enough of a dessert.\n\nI liked this place.

I made a reservation online for a table and was happy to get one at short notice. Once I got to the restaurants, I realized why OpenTable was completely open--there was only about 5 customers in the restaurant. We sat at our table.....and sat.....after about 10 minutes we got up and moved over to the bar. The hostess came up to me and said in a snarky manner, \"Was there something wrong with your table.\" I replied that there wasn't but we want happy hour and it seemed that you weren't serving the tables during happy hour. To that response, she scoffed off without responding.\n\nWe sat at the bar for another 5 minutes as the bartender finished up making a cocktail for another customer. Once he directed his attention to us, we asked to see a happy hour menu, since we hadn't seen one yet. Much to our surprise, happy hour was over in just a few minutes, at 6pm. The website states 6:30pm, so we had assumed we would have plenty of time to order a drink and a few snacks. Another surprise about their in-person happy hour menu is that about 1/3 of what is advertised online is actually offered. We opted for a cheese plate of 5 different cheeses. It looked great; however, the five large slices of cheese came with 4, yes only 4 mini slices of crostini. Straight away I asked for more bread and was told it would be $1-2 for more crostinis. Fine. The food runner came back with 4 small crostinis which cost us $.50 each. I just don't understand how a restaurant can charge you for bread on a cheese plate. Four slices of tiny crostini is not nearly enough for 5 large slabs of cheese. Until they fix this problem, I would avoid the cheese plate, unless you don't mind spending an additional $10 on bread to eat with your cheese. \n\nI must say, I was thoroughly disappointed in Credo. Although, I only sampled their happy hour, I was not impressed and a bit frustrated when I left.

They were out of that wine.  Luckily, our second choice, a bubbly red wine was available.  However, there was another obstacle.  It wasn't chilled.  She had to chill it while we drank it.

And very willing to accommodate special requests and substitutions, which I always appreciate.\n\nI thought the menu offered a good amount of variety with some unique dishes I hadn't seen before mixed in with the usual Italian fare.   I started with the mixed green salad which was fresh and lightly dressed.  My main course was marinated grilled chicken paillard over grilled asparagus. I also ordered a side of penne pasta.   It turned out to be a lot of food, as the portions were larger than expected (the chicken dish included two breasts).   Overall, I'd say the food was good to very good, but fell short of exceptional.    The flour-less warm chocolate cake with ice cream which was dessert was deliciously decadent, but somewhat small and expensive at $10.   \n\nOverall, a very satisfying if not exceptional dining experience.

When you live so close to North Beach, its a bit of a gamble to go anywhere else for Italian food. However, I'm sure glad that I took that gamble. We started with hummus and calamari as appetizers, both of which were fantastic and in generous portions. Their wine list extensive, including a number of fantastic Italian wines. The pork milanesa I got as an entree was delicious and almost too much for me to eat in one sitting. The quality of the food and portions are over and above what they charge for them. Their tiramisu was outstanding, and authentic. After all that, I finished the meal with a nice glass of scotch. Overall, an outstanding dining experience. I wont mind straying a bit from North Beach to visit this place.\n\nAs a side note, I noticed some of the people who previously reviewed this complained about the decor.

The server was sweet, but I could only tell by reading her lips.

All around the walls are quotes plastered in various typography and sizes all beginning with the phrase, \"I believe...\"  Which I came to later deduct was the meaning of \"Credo\".  So smart am I.  It was pretty interesting as they quoted every reputable celebrity, politician, athlete, comedian, model, etc.\n\nNow the food.  The menu was definitely enticing.  We opted to share the PIADINA VEGETALI: Housemade Italian style flat bread folded and stuffed with char-grilled zucchini, yellow squash, eggplant, roasted peppers, and sundried tomato goat cheese, served with mixed greens.  They went a little nutso on the goat cheese, because that's primarily what it tasted like...goat cheese flatbread with goat cheese filling.  Coincidentally, I'm lactose-intolerant.\n\nWe also tried the FOCACCIA PROSCIUTTO E MOZZARELLA:\nWarm housemade focaccia cut in the middle and stuffed\nwith imported prosciutto di Parma, mozzarella, and basil, served with parmesan fried potatoes.

The food is a solid 4, but the decor and service I would say is a 5 by far. \n\nWhen you walk in you are overwhelmed by the words that are all over the walls surrounding you - it's very tastefully done and would be a great place to take client's or when celebrating something for sure. I would make reservations because when we walked in at 12:00pm it was packed. There is bar service so if you are a party of 1 or 2 you could shimmy up there and eat too, but I would call ahead otherwise you will be waiting a while to try their tasty food. \n\nNow the food. Very typical Italian menu and very much geared to the worker. I felt like we ordered and 10 minutes later we were eating which is great when you only have an hour to spare. \n\nI had the veggie lasagna which was really good - spinach noodles and light on the cheese which I appreciated. My coworkers each got a ciabatta chichen sammy which looked really tasty and they come with fries or a salad on the side.

It's a soft and inviting way to come in out of the cold.  The theme includes famous quotes that are both thought provoking and sometimes controversial.

Our group was large so we tried most everything on the menu and we all loved our food.  \n\nI like that they put their own twist on Calamari...I get so tired of the traditional deep fried, over crunchy not very exciting pile-o-fish.  Credo took a different spin and simmered them in a tomato base with cruncy toasted bread.  Yum!\n\nI've read several reveiws and I think the nod to the negative service is not entirely unfounded.  The manager was terrific and greeted us warmly.  The servers were a bit uptight.  I felt like I was in L.A. all of the sudden...and for some, that may be a turn off.  Others might dig that.  \n\nBottom line: food is good, service is good enough and you should try this place.\n\nP.S.

And one miserable Saturday evening, one where I spent all day working in my unglamorous office, I discovered Credo when I finally went out for some air and sustenance. The space itself is stunning, funky, and all around cool. It has an open, loft-like design, with walls entirely covered in witticisms and, well, credos. Note to the restaurant though, you might want to take out Tiger's credo, where he talks about believing in the values his parents taught him. I'm just sayin'! \n\nBut more importantly, the food did not disappoint. The tuna carpaccio was nicely tart, but not overly so, the calamari was served in a very flavorful broth that was also delicious with some bread dipped in it, and the buffalo mozzarella was fresh and tasty served with bell peppers and tomato. Everyone in my group loved their entrees, but I was more interested in my own, which was the Grilled New York steak. It was the perfect portion, and it was cooked perfectly! I've been on a steak streak recently, and this definitely satisfied my carnivorous craving.

All four of us were served entrees that were almost inedible (and they ranged from meat to pasta dishes).  We ordered creme brulee for dessert, but were served a cold creme caramel that hadn't been torched (we could see the sugar crystals on the mushy top).  The presentation of the dishes was also pretty gross.  My polenta was so watery I found it inedible.  Our server didn't even bother to ask what we thought of our meals (which I found staggering given the fact that all of our dishes still had a lot of food on them when they were cleared).\n\nAlso, they need a lot of help with their lighting.

Large open space with killer lighting, great acoustics, good general ambiance. The quotes on the wall are a good way to break the ice and are eclectic enough to stray from your average bumper sticker Gandhi \"be the change\"... \n\nDrinks were of primo importance, and have to say I was incredibly disappointed. We were seated near the bar and could see the bartenders. They seemed to be a little lost making these drinks. Even with minimal patrons, drinks took about 10 minutes to make it to our table. Don't get me wrong, a little TLC is necessary for a good cocktail, but the bartender TASTING a drink with a straw before sending it out is a bit much. Even after they passed the sippy test, the drinks were lackluster. We had the limoncello vodka drink, manhattans and gin and ginger drinks. Each drink didn't quite gel and felt like they were missing something, on top of being small. If they had been full price I would have been insulted! \n\nWe also had some apps which were surprisingly great. The fried olives had a great texture and went well with the arribiatia and the flavors weren't in competition with one another. The pita was light and crispy and made me really wish we had ordered pizza, because if the crust is similar to the pita it would have been divine. The rosemary on the pita was a little overdone, but it balanced nicely with the lemon's acid in the hummus. \n\nService wasn't great either. For being generally overstaffed, they seemed distracted and slow. I didn't have a napkin and although the staff were milling around, couldn't get anyone's attention and we weren't checked in with. \n\nIn essence this is a 2 star review with a benefit of the doubt third star. \nBig pluses for having a unisex bathroom and breathtaking private room which I've already thought about for our next corporate event. \n\nBut overall, nothing too spectacular and both the bar and serve staff seemed new and lost.

And i can see why ... the food is quite good, with good service.\n\nFirst, they started with some bread and delicious olives.  Plus they included a small bowl of salt.  I'm not sure why that was there ...does anyone really use THAT much salt?.  Besides, I'd prefer getting condiments and spices in a container where I'm confident prior patrons weren't sticking their fingers into things I'm going to put into my mouth, thank you very much!\n\nAnyway, the food -- I had a chicken sandwich with basil pesto on a ciabatta bread ... quite tasty.  And my dining companion had a seafood stew that had me salivating in envy from across the table.  Both were excellent ... well worth the second attempt.\n\nNow for the bad: it's just too bad I haven't mastered sign language.  Because the volume of noise in this place is so absurdly loud, that within minutes, everyone in the room is shouting, trying to be heard over everyone else.  I'd give Credo 4-stars based on the food ... plus the entertaining \"belief\" sayings on the wall art.  But the place is so horribly noisy, that one can't enjoy it.  Only once in my life have I experienced a louder dining spot (Aqua ... I'll never go back there again!)  Really: who in their right mind creates a restaurant with nothing but hard surfaces all around, turning the dining spot into an echo chamber?  Then, just when a few patrons left, and the place finally started to get to a tolerable noise level, they turned up some music.  Ugh!\n\nI believe the food is quite good, and I believe this place has great potential.  But I also believe this place is entirely too loud to actually enjoy one's time there.

Thought the various credos, etc. would dominate, but they really just form an interesting backdrop.  Service was fast and attentive, from my early arrival through the various stages of the meal.  We lingered an hour+ over a wonderful beet ravioli (amazingly good if you like that kind of thing) and a huge, tasty calzone plus bread/olives and a liter of Pellegrino.  Would have liked more pasta choices, but otherwise, definitely a good first visit.  (Had an opentable reservation.)", "author": "Carol H."}

Falling for the trick, I have pored the menu standing outside a couple of times, but desisted from undoing positive karma from a good workout, deciding to return more dissociated from gym thoughts.\n\nA friend suggested dinner at Credo and I jumped at the opportunity. The design seems functional at first, nothing too elaborate. The subtleties are a pleasant surprise. For example the tabletops seem a patchwork of laminated wooden tiles. The walls plaster a jungle of 'credos' of the famous and infamous as 'I believe' statements that contrast the dull conversations ;-) around, but some may actually aspire by ironically staring at the walls\n\nWe selected the scallops on saffron rice and the barramundi fish on a spinach bed for entrees. While the ingredients were not dramatically transformed by cooking genius, there was the intelligence of doing no damage to high quality ingredients, but even highlighting them with ribbons of garnish and subtle sauces. The opening act and finale stole the show,  \nso perhaps these paled a little but only in comparison.\n\nEarlier, biting into the appetizer of wild mushroom cheese medley, conversation stopped, jaws fell slowly, and gods smiled mischievously for flashing a glimpse so suddenly to confused mortals. That they repeated this at the end with the Panna Cotta dessert, made one feel suddenly, inexplicably, blessed. We were left deconstructing, bite after bite, what ingredients in what proportions caused this successful alchemy. Only conclusion.. We believe, in credo", "author": "anurag p."}

First, it is important to check in to show your support for OneJustice, as they get bonused from Credo.  Even better is to start your meal with the delicious Justice cocktail, a cucumber gimlet.  I had mine with vodka as I don't love gin, and it was wonderful. We shared the beautiful burrata salad and some truffle fries. And the I enjoyed the cubano sandwich. It was so tasty, and the house made pickles were perfect.  Looking forward to my lunch there next week, and my next date night with my husband.  Great place.

And by full, they meant full of you know what, because the place was literally EMPTY. \n\nAnyhow, I'm no rookie, I know how these things work (should've made a reso after the first swing and miss), but jeez, pre-lunch rush on a Monday, not a soul in the restaurant yet, and still nothing?  \n\nAnyhow, I digress.  \n\nFinally got the opportunity to have lunch here recently (outside, of course, but luckily it actually felt like a Summer day in SF).  Had the soup of the day (great bean and noodle something-or-other) and the salmon salad.  The salmon was a bit fishy for my taste and I bit straight into a shell while eating the hard-boiled egg, but it was fine.  Vegetables were fresh and green and the bread plate with olives satisfied me where my salad fell short.\n\nService was excellent.  It did end up being jammed packed inside around 12:30pm and yet our guy still managed to come around just enough.  \n\nI ventured down to the lower level to use the restroom and I must say I'm glad we didn't choose to dine down there when offered.  There's no natural light and it's just an awkward, sterile space (at least from what I saw).

Arrived and greeted mildly by matradee who seems too distracted/unimpressed with his new trainee.  Our server was very hospitable tho, good save.  Ordered Caprese for appetizer.  Not impressed b/c for $15 we got 4 slices of tomatoes and mozzerella, ea. topped with a tiny piece of basil!  Main course we had the lobster ravioli and porcini pasta at $18 ea.  I liked my pasta, which is drowned w truffle oil (yum!)/  My partner's lobster ravioli has great sauce on, but there's so little sign of any lobster in it.  It's so well blended that he thinks it's all cheese and potatoes, no lobster flavor whatsoever.  He had a Manhattan Martini, which he said was very good.  No dessert.\n\nThe place is bathed with natural light from large glass storefront.  The back, above kitchen has this large clear glass looking into an uninspiring light well btwn office buildings.  Interior decor is basic, with LOTS of more uninspiring and unnecessary quotes as \"artwork\".  The tables are cool.

Nothing spectacular, but decent pizza and ravioli. We decided to go back for dinner with a big group of international colleagues in February 2013, only to find a completely different menu with no pizza and only very obscure pasta dishes. That's fine, we're adventurous, but the problem is it was all designed to look fancy, but didn't actually taste good. The biggest disappointment was the fish dish that several of us ordered. The dishes came out and the pungent smell of fish overwhelmed our table - it was clearly not fresh. I couldn't eat it. No one was thrilled with their meals. The bill was outrageous for such mediocre food. It looks like pizza is back on the dinner menu - maybe the chef has changed again? Not sure, but I wouldn't risk it.", "author": "Anna Y."}

Insane, right?? Facing the impossible, I bravely dialed number after number fending off many \"I'm sorry, we're booked\" responses until I stumbled upon Credo.\n\nMy weary call was answered by Michael (who has a very charming and cordial phone voice, btw) and instead of shunning me like the rest of the hosts I'd spoken with he worked very hard to accommodate my request and managed to secure us the largest table they had to offer. 5-star service right there.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where the good impression ended. My party arrived at Credo, slightly early, and we were not greeted by a single employee for 10 minutes. People saw us standing there, but nobody attempted to make eye contact with me or offer a, \"I'll be with you in a second,\" smile at all. I do admit they were very busy, but employees did see us standing there and nobody made the effort to make us feel welcomed.\n\nFinally the hostess ran over up (I don't remember her name), and I had to stop and inform her that we had arrived. Another 10-ish minutes of waiting ensued. However, the nifty selection of quotes on the wall kept us occupied...\n\nI was very pleased with our seating arrangements, as we were given a very large & comfortable square table that was nestled in a little side area of the restaurant. It was near the open kitchen, but it still felt private none the less. We also didn't have to shout at each other over the noise of the restaurant. Points for that.\n\nComplimentary olives & bread were yummy... the olives were pitted (YAY!) and had a nice spicy kick to them. I wasn't a fan of the gnocchi I ordered. The portion seemed awfully small compared to what everyone else received and it was very very bland and very very oily. Maybe that's what I get for ordering gnocchi tho?\n\nThe rest of my table ordered lamb paninis (which are actually more like lamburgers...haha), chicken paninis, and a salmon salad. Nobody complained about their food at all, and everyone else seemed to have a reasonable portion. It was just me that got the short end of the stick! \n\nAlso, our table was tended to by two very attentive waiters. I don't remember their names either, but they did a great job as my water glass was never empty.\n\nSoooo 3 stars? 4 stars? I'd say they're right in between.", "author": "Caty K."}

Maybe it was because they were overwhelmed with grouponers, but i was not that impressed. \n\nDecor: pretty cool. I like the writing all over the walls, and the space was nice and seemed cozy. \n\nService: good. Attentive waitress, super nice host, and overall they made me and my GF feel at home. \n\nFood: we got 2 appetizers; the fried olives which were pretty tasty (sauce was bomb), and the squid, which was also well prepared and really good. \n\nThe reason for 2 stars here and the \"meh, i've experienced better\" attitude is because of my main course. I got the seared rare ahi. Now granted I know this is not a spectacular cut of fish in general, and seared ahi has recently soared as a pretentious, over-priced dish for people who don't like the taste of real fish, but by those guidelines good restaurants should not mess it up because it's easy to prepare. 3 mins on either side of a high temp grill with some sauce and voila, you're done. This piece of fish I got was bland, dry, and overall just tasteless. I paid $27 for a piece of fish, and they totally ruined it. Ahi retains juices well, especially when prepared almost rare, and this had none. It was like the chef wrung out the piece of fish like a wet towel before he put it on the grill. I don't know many places that mess up seared rare ahi but these guys pulled it off. \n\nSo anyway, i might go back here, i might not, but i say 2/5 Credo. Apps were good, drinks were good, service was good, but people sit to dine for entrees, not fufu crap. So get that right then we'll talk.", "author": "kareem d."}

On the whole, though, it was just too much money--omgod, and now I'm remembering that it was this much money despite not getting any wine!--for food that too rarely impressed. Even more damning, a great crime was committed. \n\nGreat crime: Serving gnocchi that looked, and felt like (i.e., texture-wise) like it came from an extrusion machine. Thick, gummy, tubey little bullets of gnocchi. Ixnay on the nocchigay! (Oh how it makes me yearn for Blue Plate's gnocchi, melty and delicate and languorously stretching, if memory serves, its sage flavor all across my tongue.) \n\nOther than that, the only thing I can recall from the meal was a wild boar ragout that was pretty good, but not good enough to plea bargain itself out of the Great Crime mentioned above, which Great Crime was, of course, exacerbated by the significant bill for a wineless dinner.", "author": "T U."}

I don't generally listen to critics, but when he mentioned a dish called Sedanini, I knew I had to try it.  Well, I had to get my boyfriend to try it.  The dish is basically a bowl of pasta with pizza dough draped over it, and then baked in the oven to cook the dough. It only *looks* overwhelming, trust me.  Pasta and pizza are my bf's two vices, so naturally we have to give it a go.\n\nThe Sedanini itself was pretty good.  The sauce tasted fresh, and the sausage in the pasta was nice and pepper-y.  Pasta was al dente, pizza dough was thin and crusty.  The other dishes we had was pretty good too: lobster/shrimp ravioli (each bite makes you think of the ocean), fritto misto (the vegetable peels were nice and crunchy), and olive all'ascolana (wish there were more fillings, or bigger olives). We finished our dinner with the panna cotta, which was dense and creamy.\n\nLooking back, I can't help feeling that something was... missing.  I can't put a finger on it, though.

The list goes on and on. The balance needs to be restored in this world. Showing so few quotes by women sends a message, and it is an insulting one.", "author": "Susan A."}

The hostess and staff were extremely attentive and accommodating both times.  I was particularly impressed with how well the Credo staff handled our dinner party of 12.\n-Lunch: I ordered the Pizza Rustica and was very happy with the pizza that came out.  The crust was a good thinness and the sauteed onions and red peppers were a delicious touch!  Great place for a business lunch.\n-Dinner: Our party of 12 mostly ordered family style and came away with only positive reviews.  I really enjoyed the Semplice salad (the Chianti vinaigrette has a great flavor) and definitely had a few more slices of the Rustica!  Great for a party or a date-a reservation is a good idea as it was crowded.\n*All in all, highly recommended.", "author": "Daniel C."}

The burrata salad is just a huge hunk of burrata on top of shaved asparagus. The burrata was excellent but I was expecting more of a salad to accompany it.

About 10 minutes after paying we were told we had to move so they could seat another party. I've worked in restaurants for years and would never ask that of a guest.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-09-13", "description": "I've been here three times.  Each time was a disappointment.\n\nI went when they first opened.  Service was atrocious.  We walked in early one evening and 2/3 of the tables were empty.  Nonetheless the hostess asked us to wait at the bar until a table could be prepared.  \"What about one of those tables - the ones with the place settings?\" I said gesturing to over a dozen empty tables.  \"Oh, those are reserved and we don't have a walk in table available.\"  So we walked 10 feet away and stood near the bar and pointedly declined to order a drink.  Then about 5 minutes later the hostess discovered that there was a table available and we were seated.  Frankly, I don't remember anything about the food.  \n\nNext time was for an office function where I didn't have a choice but to attend.  We were seated promptly.  We were a party of 10 and were seated in the main room, which is so loud that it is difficult at times to talk to the person next to you.  Forget about talking to the person across the table and one seat diagonally away - not going to happen.  So I got stuck talking to ______________ from purchasing.  No, not the restaurant's fault.  I had the gnocchi.  I know that a restaurant isn't going to make gnocchi as good as my Nanna - I accept that.  But these were like little potato shot puts - very dense and firm adrift in a sea of indifferent sauce.  Also, we were a large party, but the wait-staff was clearly overmatched.   The waiters themselves were fine, but I think there was only one or maybe two people assigned to do all of the secondary tasks (refill water, bring more bread, clear plates) in the whole restaurant.  All I remember is this poor guy, sweating heavily, practically running from table to table trying to keep up.  So, strike two.\n\nOkay, I went back a third time.  It was a Friday and I couldn't get last minute reservations anywhere downtown so we took a chance and just walked in.  I mean, the first time didn't count since they had just opened and the second time was an unweildy party, so how bad could it be, right?  Okay, the fact that we got a table on a Friday night should have been a clue I guess.  This time, service was fine all around.  Nice hostess, attentive non-harried waiter.  Good, looks like the front of the house is getting itself in order.  (There was some gaunt over-caffeinated guy (at least I hope it was just caffeine) scurring between hostess stand and back so I think he must be the (new?) manager.)\n\nBut, the food.  My god, the food.  Started with the Caesar.  The \"dressing\" was a pasty sauce overpowered by salt.  I don't really know why salt would be added at all when dish has anchovies.  Companion's mixed green salad was okay - but how hard is that to screw up?\n\nWe split pizza and halibut.  Pizza toppings were good and cheese was bubbly and perfect.  But two slices had burnt on outside and bottom.  No over-browned - burnt almost black.  The halibut was supposed to be seared - but it was prepared more like a blackened catfish or something.  Halibut is such a wonderful light, flaky fish.  My favorite fish in the world.  The piece was a bit thin (a problem in itself for a $20 plus piece of fish) so maybe that is what threw the \"chef\" of his/her timing.  As I ate it, I couldn't even tell it was halibut as opposed to just some generic fish.  I read in the NY Times that some restaurants pass off cheap fish as halibut and, while I have no proof that is what happened here, I do wonder.  Why else would you destroy such a great fish?\n\nCredo is in a great location and the space itself could be nice if they would install some sound baffles and scale back on the pretentious \"what I believe\" decor a bit.\n\nBut when the service varies between hostile at worst and merely competent at best and the food is consistently subpar, no amount of window-dressing can make a difference.\n\nSo, three strikes, lesson learned.", "author": "Octavio G."}

But much to my surprise, we lucked out and found free street parking right in front of the restaurant and the food was really fantastic!  So, here goes:  \"You were right, Honey!\"  There, I said it.  There you go, that's your \"one.\"\n\nThe restaurant was moderately busy on the Saturday night that we went.  The decor, as other reviewers have mentioned, is modern/yuppy with credos (\"I believe...\" statements) written all over the walls.  Some of them are quite amusing.  The waitstaff was pleasant and prompt, and we were very pleased with the service.\n\nWe took advantage of the 1/2 off bottle of wine and ordered the Pellegrini 2007 Zinfandel, which we highly recommend to Zin fans.  Somewhat jammy, hints of pepper, and really smooth and easy to drink.  The Zin didn't overpower any of the dishes we ordered, even the more delicate tuna tartare.  \n\nAs for the food, we took a different approach and order 3 appetizers and one of the pasta dishes to split among us:  FRITTO MISTO - Monterey squid/Oregon Bay shrimp/shaved vegetables/artichoke hearts/tomato aioli. TARTARA DI TONNO - Ahi tuna/avocado/cucumber carpaccio/hearts of palm/ginger dressing. CARPACCIO DI MANZO - Shaved beef loin/arugula salad/hearts of palm/avocado/truffle dressing. SEDANINI ALLA CREDO - Short macaroni pasta/Italian sausage/pancetta/pecorino Romano/tomato  sauce/ topped with pizza dough & oven baked.  The Fritto Misto and Carpaccio were my favorites, but I thought the tuna tartare, while delicious, was a bit under-seasoned.  The Sedanini was quite the spectacle with its puffed up pizza dough layered over a big bowl of pasta.  The sauce from the pasta was really spectacular:  spicy, zesty, with nuggets of pancetta.  We had a hard time trying to not eat too much of the fabulous focaccia and olive medley that's served before your dishes arrive.  We ended our meal with a honey panna cotta with raspberry sauce.  \n\nOverall, we had a great experience at Credo and will return to try other menu items.", "author": "Beth K."}

It feels like the entire world is just a massive playground, built just for me. The only downside, however, is that almost all businesses are closed, including my favorite local eateries.\n\nThis Memorial Day I was hanging out with my coworkers and we were imminently requiring sustenance, looking for something, anything to fill our stomachs. We stumbled upon Credo's minimalist storefront -- humble, unassuming -- and to our surprise it's open. We walk in...\n\n--and Wow, the ambiance here is incredible! High ceilings, a colorfully stocked bar, and walls upon walls of endless quotations all beginning \"I believe...\" (Credo means \"I believe\" in Latin). I can't speak for the atmosphere on a busy day, but with the restaurant nearly devoid of customers it's evident how much thought was placed into designing and decorating. Being a bit of a sound junkie, I also realized they'd placed some sound absorbing material on the ceiling and as a result the acoustics of the room were fantastic! They were playing some fun indie pop in the background, which brought a big smile to my face.\n\nWe were seated quickly. The tables were fun and artsy, and I loved the glasses they used for water which were just like the bottoms of wine bottles, with the tops chopped off. The silverware was super awesome as well and there were little flat curved hooks at the ends of each fork, knife and spoon. I couldn't wait to use them.\n\nThe food came quickly, and it was delicious. Their bread was soft and fresh and served with an intriguing mixture of pitted olives, peppers and various Italian spices. For my dish I ordered from their prix fixe menu, which consists of a salad or soup of the day paired with either half a roasted chicken or the seafood of the day. I opted for the soup and seafood. The soup was a pureed carrot and ginger soup, very orangey and very flavorful. Although I loved it, the others at my table did not seem to lust over the ginger as much as I did. The seafood of the day was a fillet of grilled halibut served over a bed of julienned mixed veggies in a wonderful basil and olive oil broth. The halibut had a perfect, lightly seasoned layer of crisp, and the insides were juicy and tender. I was really impressed by the broth, though, which really enhanced the flavor of the fish and soft veggies when eaten together.\n\nI had the chance to try my friend's dishes and they were quite good as well. The penne pasta is cooked perfectly al dente and comes with an epic tomato sauce. The hummus antipesto is very awesome and I highly recommend it, it's no hummus you know. A bit sharp and a bit cheesy, it curiously has the consistency of mashed potatoes.\n\nAll in all, a pleasant experience served with a delicious meal. Pricy? I'd say so. But I'll pay any day for a creative and memorable dining experience like the one I had at Credo.", "author": "Ayumi Y."}

You might want to try the seared scallops which, though $24 for all of three scallops, have always been done nicely.", "author": "moosedog i."}

I can't say dining because after nearly an hour of waiting to be served, I walked out of the restaurant not eating anything.\n\nHostess was rude and somehow only had eyes for a certain type of people. She was smiling and very receptive to the Caucasian gentleman that came up behind me... but somehow didn't see me, Asian female. \n\nAfter finally getting seated (10 minutes wait even with reservations) downstairs, where all the not-so-attractive people seem to be sitting, we got menus and were greeted by someone who took our drink orders. After 10+ minutes, our server finally showed up to tell us the daily specials. Keep in mind that we are here for lunch and now 20 minutes have passed. All of a sudden, she excused herself as she needed to \"take of something\". She returned about 5 minutes later to take our orders. Finally the server took our orders. Another 5 minutes go by, we wondered if we are going to get our drinks, that we ordered 20 minutes ago. Still nothing on our tables except our utensils and napkins. My friend asked a busboy to find a server to get us something. He was the only one kind enough to bring us some water and bread. My two other friends salad and soup arrives and I'm watching them eat as I didn't order a starter. Half way through their soup and salad, the main courses arrived. I looked at the dish I was served and was puzzled as I ordered a pasta but somehow ended up getting steak. Hmm... I asked for our server but no where to be found. When she finally turned up, we discussed what I thought I ordered versus what she heard. She went into the kitchen to try to rectify the situation. Another 5 minutes go by, the expediter brought out a dish for me, nothing close to what I ordered. By then 50 minutes had passed and I had no confidence I will ever get a reasonable meal at Credo. So, I excused myself from the table and left very dissatisfied and wondered if this restaurant knows how to run a restaurant. \n\nI ended up picking up a very satisfying sandwich down the street from the restaurant for a fraction of the price and most importantly, NO GRIEF. \n\nNot a restaurant I recommend or would ever want to work with.", "author": "Maggie H."}

Loved the decor and the ambiance and the high-ceilings and the open kitchen and the nice back table my co-workers were seated in.  Was really looking forward to a great meal.  My co-worker absolutely loves going to Credo and I was excited to try it for the first time until.....\n\nThe service was so so (no refills offered on our drinks....i had an empty ice tea glass in front of me for most of the lunch and it took forever for someone to come by and refill our water glasses).  \n\nThe food was so frustratingly hit-or-miss.  The food is also why I will never dine at Credo on my own dime.  My message to the owners and managers is that at $14 for a tomato salad (sorry Burrata Caprese) and $17 for penne in tomato sauce with chicken, everything should be perfect and it just wasn't.  Our table ordered corn fritters and Burrata Caprese's to share.  The corn fritters were delicious but my last bite of salad was a thoroughly flavorless and unripe tomato which was so disappointing considering the price and the availability of amazing produce all over the bay area. \n\nThen my penne showed up.  ughhh....once again it wasn't terrible or it wouldn't have been terrible for a $7 or $8 lunch time pasta dish.  However, as a $17 dish it should have been spectacular and just wasn't.  Pasta itself was fine (probably store-bought) and the tomato sauce was good but nothing special but the grilled chicken was so dry...like sahara desert dry...like every single last drop of moisture had been grilled and sauteed out of it kind of dry.  The waiter comes back around and offers everyone pepper flakes or black pepper for their entrees....I am eating an italian inspired tomato sauce based pasta dish with no seafood....where the hell is the fresh Parmigiano-Reggiano to go with it?  It was never offered and I never felt comfortable enough to ask for it.\n\nI would give it 2.5 stars if that were an option.

But read on...)\n\nBolstered by this positive experience, we bought two $20-for-$40 vouchers to a special 3-course tasting menu w/ cocktail pairings, so went in last week to redeem them.\n\nWe had no idea what was actually *on* the tasting menu, so I specified on my OpenTable reservation that I'm vegetarian. Well, two of the three courses on the regular tasting menu contained meat, so the restaurant proactively accommodated my dietary preferences, substituting a rich, dreamy mushroom soup and perfectly salty, not too oily, arancini for the originally-planned chicken meatballs and porchetta sliders. Best of all, my cocktail pairings were changed accordingly as well (I mean, they're *supposed* to be *pairings*, but this was a busy Friday night and I can think of many other SF restaurants that wouldn't have made the effort). I was seriously impressed by the attention the team had paid to my dining experience, and in fact my husband admitted that my veggie food was in some cases even better than his!! The bread and spiced olives were a yummy accompaniment, too. Portion sizes were perfect, leaving us just enough room for dessert  (a sinful molten chocolate cake) in addition to our 3 dishes each. \n\nAnna, the mixologist, also happened to be our server for the evening, and took excellent care of us, coming back to check on us with every course, and of course serving up potent, innovative, and flavourful cocktails with a flourish and a smile. She happily discussed cocktail ideas, philosophies, and community-building with my budding mixologist husband, and had us sample a coffee-based aperitif with our dessert course. Credo is lucky to have her. \n\nSo that's two out of two wins. We will definitely be back for more!", "author": "Simran T."}

I believe we went here on their 4th day of opening and it seemed like everyone was well knowledgeable on the restaurant, food, drinks, and atmosphere that this place is setting.  Speaking of which, the atmosphere was very unique and I would dine there just for that.  The silverware and table tops are what I would want to have at my house (contemplated on helping myself to their utensils) and the arrangement of the restaurant was very unique.  Seating is very interesting, you could either sit at a table, sit at the bar, or something that I will try next time, and sit at the kitchen bar.  The kitchen is an open kitchen and they were wise enough to include a few seats their, so if someone goes on their own, and after they finish reading all the quotes on the walls, they can watch their dish being prepared.  \"I believe I am the Worlds best singer.\" - Celine Dion.  While that is not true, you will have a laugh over some of the quotes that are on the wall.\nIn terms of food, they offer very unique dishes that are worth visiting them and trying.  We had the sedanini alla credo (delicious pasta with sausage hidden under a pizza dough covering).  This dish was huge, it was split up between two and it was still very filling.  But we did leave enough room for dessert.  We ordered the Tortino di ricotta e frutta candita con salsa ai lamponi (Tuscan ricotta cheese and raisin cake).  Unlike our dinner this was rather small, but after having a hearty dinner, this was a good way to finish our meal.  The flavors are light, but enjoyable.  I would recommend this place to anyone in the area, especially for lunch.

However, the food is totally overpriced and barely mediocre. It was hard to carry on a conversation even though my friend and I were sitting next to each other at the bar. We both ordered the lamb shank as our dinner entree. It came with flavorless polenta that was chock full of leeks -- the dark green part. The lamb was barely warm and not falling apart as a good lamb shank should. It was covered in some nondescript flavorless brown sauce and I guarantee the shank wasn't braised in the sauce . It also came out of the kitchen way too fast. Always a bad sign. I also thought it was strange that the shank cost less than the pork chop that was on the menu. Granted I did not sample a lot of menu items, but my many years of dining in SF tell me that if this place doesn't step up its game it is going to have a short life. The rent has got to be a killer.\n\nOn a positive note, the bartender was incredibly attentive and concerned that we were not enjoying our entrees. She comped us a gelato. But in the end all the gelato in the world won't make up for high priced, amateur food in the financial district.

The food has incredible, lingering flavor.   From pasta dishes, to the pounded pork or chicken, and pizza - the food is great.  The meatball and Tuscan toast appy is very tasty!  The sides, like spinach and roasted potatoes are a wonderful compliment to the main dishes, and don't forget to leave room for dessert!  Mario's Tiramisu out of this world!  The quote filled wall space creates a fun atmosphere, and sitting at the chef's counter is also a great adventure.  The wait staff is personable, and the drinks / bar are great, as well.

I came here with my friend and order 2 courses + 1 course. Our appetizer was the chef signature (macaroni with bean soup) and Lasagna and Chicken ...... ( I forgot). The food was okay for me (nothing special). The service was good and the most that I like is the interior, beautiful decoration. well , I'll never come back again...", "author": "Elisabeth T."}

The food is pretty good, but not something to die for.  The service is very nice and the price is right.  The pasta with the top crust looks very impressive.  Also tried the pork loin and it was huge.  The decor is simple, clean and attractive.  It's very appropriate for business casual meeting as well as just regular friend gathering.", "author": "E H."}

Not really worth the price for what we (2 of us) shared...\ninsalata di pollo: Despite the under-seasoned chicken and slightly bland home made mozzarella, the rest of the components of the salad were tasty. The corn and carrot flavors really came through, and the Chianti dressing wasn't over-powering, although there was a little too much of it. Portion was not worth $11.95. I can get twice as much salad at mixt greens for the same price.\ncasoncelli di bergamo al burro fuso (tortelloni stuffed with ricotta and spinach in sage browned butter sauce): This was the best dish, although still lacking some depth, and the portion was a bit small (7 'jumbo' tortelloni). The sauce was not too buttery and the fried sage added a nice touch. I think they used about 10 spinach leaves in the whole stuffing because I did not taste it at all, and there were a lot of hazelnuts, although that did not bother me.\nbecause I was still hungry, I ordered the daily soup (mind you, I have an appetite for my 120lb body, or it could just me credo needs to serve bigger portions). It was a tomato soup... good, although not amazing. It had a pretty strong garlic flavor, according to my lunch mate, but I enjoyed it.\n\nService was good, my water glass was never empty. \n\nDecor was modern and comfortable. Loved the wood tables and silverware, although the knife was kind of a pain in my hand. It was pretty noisy for lunch... I'd say it was at about 80% capacity and there was only 1 person at the bar. They should have had the wall posters made out of fabric, or put something in to absorb some sound.\n\nI'd only go back to try a pizza or paninoteca. Based on what we ordered, credo was not really worth the $- taste or portion wise. When you're serving a basic penne pasta in a spicy garlic tomato sauce for $10.95 for lunch, how is that worth the money? Yes this place is in the Financial District, but that's no excuse for overpriced pasta. Maybe lasagna for $12.95, but plain pasta for $2 less??", "author": "Sarah K."}

The service was excellent and the food fantastic.   The only other restaurants for which I have had similar perfect al dente pasta are Don Giovanni's in Napa and Alba, Piemonte, IT.  I have found a new favorite spot!", "author": "J J."}

It strangely has a casual vibe yet some of the food is very classy. I think that it can be a hit or miss for people depending on what they order. This place is across the street from Equinox where I work out and when feeling like I had a good work out - my friend and I hit this place for a reward. Ok - so we sometimes go even if we didn't have a good workout! We have found a couple dishes which we always order since we know they are delicious and one in particular that is unique (at least I think it is!) to Credo. That dish is the Sedanini alla Credo. The best way to describe it is pasta with sausage, pancetta, sage and pecorino covered with pizza dough and baked! It comes out the size of a full size pie and is SO good. It is also probably an entire day's calorie intake but it is worth it! I also love their version of caesar salad which comes topped with a soft boiled egg. This last visit I tried the pomegranate duck breast with fried plantains (yum) and it was really good. I loved that they crisped up the skin which gave the dish another dimension. A lot going on in this dish with the mole sauce but I really liked it. I have to admit I have not tried any of their desserts since after the Sedanini that is almost impossible without needing to be rolled out!", "author": "M S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-03-11", "description": "My friend and I went to lunch here yesterday and I was underwhelmed. On the positive side: Nice \"New York style\" space and two very friendly waiters. On the negative side: Super noisy (not suited for parties over 2!), mediocre, overpriced food. The complimentary salt/olives/bread combo are a nice touch and our water came quickly (including my special request of water without ice). Our waiter seemed a bit miffed when we didn't want to order a cocktail right away and told him that we wanted to pick our food first and then pair the wine. He did let us taste the wine we were interested in though which not all restaurants do. I ordered the salmon salad which the woman eating at the table next to us seemed to enjoy and which was served Nicoise style with hard boiled egg, olives and green beans. My friend went for the \"fish of the day\", a sauteed petrale sole with vegetables. I chose the Rose off the wine list and asked our waiter to recommend a white for my friend's fish. He suggested the French Sauvignon Blanc which was delicious but at $14.95 one of the most expensive glasses of wine on the menu. Our food arrived much too fast and we were both surprised by that, especially in the case of my friend's fish dish. The presentation was completely unremarkable (piece of fish slabbed on a pile of greens in my case). Taste was ok but not memorable. My friend's fish was bland and had no crunch/crust which I would have expected from a pan-fried fish. Overpriced at $18.95. We had a great time regardless, catching-up with each other  but when a bus boy wanted to clear my plate (that still had some fish and salad on it) and I told him that I was still eating, he shrugged his shoulders in disbelief as if to say \"There is a line out the door, eat up\". Our waiter talked us into ordering the tiramisu which was a large portion but not remarkable either. According to our waiter it was the best dessert on the menu and that has me worried. There was a strange $2.60 \"service charge\" on our bill of $65 but we didn't bother to ask what it was (SF health coverage charge??). At $42 per person (including tip) I felt this place is overpriced and also a bit overrated. Next time I want  authentic Italian food at lunch time in the FIDI, you will find me at Perbacco.", "author": "Heike H."}
