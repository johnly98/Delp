Definitely a great place to go and relax, especially after spending the day at one of the nearby spas.\n\n\nOh and one of the best things about this place is the warming toilets downstairs!! It is so amazing! Although this place shares the bathrooms with the other stores in the building, it's still amazing and a great lure to come here (maybe TMI, but just saying, a warm, sanitized toilet seat makes a world of difference!)\n\nOh and staff here is amazing!!!

There is a large cardboard cut out of Queen Elizabeth so you are at tea with the queen! \n\nThey had the table set up with crafts for the girls on one end and a few seats for adults on the other end. Our hits very graciously ordered high tea for parents as well! The hostess for the tea party takes care of everything...so parents can sit back and enjoy their tea as well. The girls made little craft bags and they were given an option of swamp tea (a tropical punch) or blue eyes (which was a pink punch of some sort).\n\nTheir menu is quite extensive and they have a range of teas to choose from. The food trays arrived and we had an assortment of sandwiches, scones and sweet treats!

I love going to tea places for the experience but also for their selection. \n\nI haven't been here in over a year and it seems like they changed the prices but also the menu. I noticed the tea for one had increased price and that you couldn't get a la carte items such like scones and crumpets without also getting a pot of tea. \n\nAnyways, I went here with my friend and we split the afternoon tea for one. It is $32 but if you want to split it, they add $8. I remember this being pretty good and filling in the past. Instead, what we got was highly disappointing. \n\nThis wouldn't even be satisfying for one person. I think what really got me were the 'sandwiches.' They took finger sandwiches to a whole other level by offering bite size sandwiches that looked like Costco samples. We got a third? Of a chicken salad? Sandwich, a micro sausage roll, and a couple of 'sandwiches' that were actually bread pieces in shapes of a small circle, with stuff on top. Lastly there was a mini biscuit that was inedible. \n\nI've never been a fan of their salad, so I cannot judge it. The crumpet and scone were okay, in addition to the jam and curds that comes with it. On top were like 4-5 mini treats. The Apple one wasn't bad but the rest were either dry or too sweet (this one is a personal preference)\n\nBefore I get any comments asking why we didn't get separate tea for ones, it's because we had always shared the tea for one between us, and remember it being pretty good and more worth it. But even then, I wouldn't even get the tea for one for myself. $32 for what was given? No. \n\nAs for their individual plates, I remember The chicken mozzarella sandwich being good. However, if you're not into cheese like myself, you're limited on the sandwiches as a lot of them have cheese. The highlight was the tea. \n\nOverall, very disappointing.\n\nEDIT: I have seen some of the owners past responses to other people's low star reviews.

Tables placed close enough to yet still preserve privacy and comfort. Everything here screams cute, and all things pink and lovely.\n\nFinger sandwiches, scones, cookies, macarons and garden salads are brought out on tiered serving plates. \n\nAs our server Amilcar (such a complimenting server..every tea is his favorite but the grapefruit is a must try he says) shares insight on tea selection while another discloses brewing tips for maximum sparkle dust in your tea you can't help but appreciate the experience.  and fun!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-28", "description": "I expected a parlor and not the lobby of a building in a space usually reserved for a coffee kiosk. While they lack the coziness and bric-a-brac of other tea salons, the owners have made the most of their nook with cute, clever touches and clearly are really trying. Their very clean, clever, streamlined aesthetic fits Japantown, yet is still entirely British. You may also see some Harajuku fans pass you to shop at the store up the stairs or some cosplayers (as we saw) sitting for tea.\n\nOne of the special touches includes a little fairy door attached to the bottom of the counter. You can easily eat here and completely miss it. When I commented on it to the owner, he pointed out the tiny mailbox next to it where kids can leave messages to the fairy. He confided that he was planning on taking a picture of all the messages and posting it on Instagram. And for the birthday of the little girl next to us, the server sang \"Happy Birthday\" and blew bubbles over her.\n\nMy husband and I shared the afternoon tea for two. I can never resist ordering chai, but here I found it to be nothing special, and thought it needed more spices. Reading other Yelp reviews now, I definitely want to branch out and try some of their more creative teas served with a bit of sparkle.\n\nWe requested no pork so we didn't have the ham sandwich which is usually included. Our first tier included an egg salad sando (the husband liked but it was a little too hard-boiled eggy for me), a chicken salad sando (good and a sizable portion compared to most tea rooms, possibly because we were skipping the ham sando), and a cucumber cream cheese sando. Usually I find cucumber cream cheese a little tiresome since it's something I can make at home. But it turned out to be one of the best I've had because of the flavorful cream cheese. The husband didn't like it - possibly because there was too much cream cheese for him.\n\nI really liked the cheese biscuit, but my husband didn't like that it wasn't \"biscuit-like\" enough. We were told a sausage roll would be included but instead we had extras of the cheese biscuits. It's possible we missed it because we asked for no pork, though our server assured us it was made of beef.\n\nThe second tier consisted of a blueberry scone, a crumpet, and lemon curd, cream, and jam. The scone was quite good. Our server suggested we eat the warm crumpet first and we did - in between bites of sandwiches - but it still got too cold much too quickly.\n\nMini desserts made up the third tier. I liked the addition of mango to the lemon bar and thought it was very good. The brownie was a bit dry. The freckled meringue was my least favorite but it was also one of the best meringues I've had. The palmier was very good and was my husband's favorite. My favorite was the red velvet cupcake. The flavor of the frosting was excellent and light and I enjoyed the crunchy heart sprinkles.\n\nThere were other beautiful cakes in the display at the counter. One had a rose that completely passed through the cake, and the stem was visible in the center as slices of cake were removed.\n\nI really appreciated the variety of food that Crown and Crumpet provided. Instead of basic sandwiches, they tried to improve on them with better cream cheese, an above average chicken salad, and even varied the shapes of the sandwiches like I saw in London. Plus they added cheese biscuits (and sausage rolls for some lucky diners). And while the other places just give you two tiny mediocre desserts (Tea Time) or one nice dessert (LIsa's, Lovejoy's), Crown & Crumpet gives you five adorable desserts.\n\nIt's pretty to get a tiered tray with all the food at once, but I wish that instead they'd offer the option of getting our food in courses like in London. It makes sense to eat in the order of sandos and savories, bready things, and then desserts, since the bready things (scones and crumpets) are sweet. But right now, since scones and crumpets arrive hot, I have to eat those first ahead of the sandwiches, and I know it's a small thing but I find it quite irksome.\n\nThis is the first time I've paid for tea with a Groupon. \n\nKathleen's High Tea Rankings\n1) Claridge's, London\n2) Le Parloir, Montreal\n3) The Fairmont Empress, Victoria B.C.\n4) Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Tea at One Aldwych, London\n5) Aubrey Rose, La Mesa  \n6) CROWN AND CRUMPET, SAN FRANCISCO\n7) Lovejoy's, San Francisco and Redwood City\n8) Tea Upon Chatsworth, San Diego (closed)\n9) Lovey's, Pacifica\n10) Lisa's Tea Treasures, Campbell\n11) Tyme for Tea, Fremont\n12) Lisa's Tea Treasures, Los Altos\n13) Dushanbe Tea Room, Boulder \n14) Satori, San Jose\n15) Charles Chocolates Tea, San Francisco\n16) Ampersand Science Afternoon Tea, London\n17) Tea Time, Palo Alto\n18) Lisa's Tea Treasures, San Jose\n19) Samovar, San Francisco (Page St.)\n20) Shakespeare's Corner Shoppe and Afternoon Tea, San Diego\n21) Cafe du The, Burlingame\n22) The Huntington Langham Hotel, Pasadena\n23) Satori, Saratoga\n24) Dartealing Lounge, San Francisco", "author": "Kathleen M."}

However, it's very cutely decorated and gives you the authentic high tea experience. My group and I came here as we had a Living Social deal that gave each of us our choice of a pot of tea, and chef's choice of an assortment of baked goods, sandwiches, and pastries. At first, I thought that there was no way that eating some light bites would be enough to satisfy me, and I was surprised that I couldn't even finish all the food on my plate. Everything was delicious, especially their finger sandwiches. The crumpet was not my favorite, although if I had put more of the creme fraiche and jam on it, it probably would have been better. \n\nFor the tea, if you like things sweet, you'll probably want to give their Stardust a try. It's made with sparkly sugar so the whole drink has a glimmer to it - really cool. I don't like my drinks sweet though, so I settled on one of their speciality reserves, the lychee congoe, which had just a hint of the fruit in it, but otherwise tasted like a regular black tea. The best tea we tried was probably their strawberry tea though - it tasted like fresh strawberries and came with cream on the side, so it was nice and milky. \n\nThe staff provided great service and the owner even came out to make sure we were doing ok.

The teas are really pleasant and there are lots of lots of different selections which are terrific. The best tea to get, is Swamp Water. It's going to sound weird to you but it's really something. I could just come here and have that and nothing else.\n\nFor people with children, this is by far the best place to eat around town. Its relatively small bite, and it has a lot of variety. Best of all, it's a great place to either come with your girlfriends and spend some quality time to catch up, gossip, or both, or to come with your little ones and have some quality family time before they fly the nest and head into the brave wide world.\n\nBonus point, a great place to people watch -  you get plenty of women who are to be wedded or to be deliverying their babies to come here - the classy way of celebrating womanhood I suppose. \n\nI, however, like to come here and watch the theatre goers - usually on weekends there are some sort of shows in the basement.

I think it is fair given the decor and more modern-day princessy, pink vibes (whereas other places in the city may feel more like 'olde English' or grandma's living room).\n\nThe $32 comes with sandwiches, 2 savories, 1 scone, 1 crumpet, and five bite sized sweets.\nIf there was an option to just do sandwiches and the scone and crumpet, that would be perfect to me (and then I'm also not paying for the stuff I don't want..) I haven't tried asking but hopefully that could be an option!\n\nThe tea is very good, and they have a high-quality and vast selection!\n\nThe sandwiches are just OK. They could use more filing since my mouth felt kind of dry afterwards.\n\nSweets are overall too sweet, but really pretty! Now that I'm getting older, I don't care much for sweets though I will say the the mini cheesecake (they use a softer cheese and the crust is light and crispy!) and the chocolate mousse are good! The meringue was pretty, but too sweet for me (though the texture was great) The mini cupcake and the chocolate strawberry were standard.\n\nThe scone and crumpet were delicious! It's hard to find a good scone OR crumpet. And they have it down well here. YAY! \n\nThe overall service was excellent. The hostess was very nice, attentive, and made sure everything was running smoothly and everyone was happy. The servers were very friendly and fast but very busy.\n\nFood left a bit to be desired, but I usually feel that at any tea place. It is still a great place to have tea time.", "author": "Emily C."}

I had a great experience here with my cousin. We each got to choose our own pot of tea. I actually don't care for english tea because it's not very fragrant and doesn't have a strong tea taste unlike chinese tea but I got the rose tea and it was still ok. The three tiers of food may not look like a lot but it actually is more than enough at least for 2 people. I had to pack up the sweets because I was already too full by then. I enjoyed the savory food, but not so much the sweets on the top plate; some of them were too sweet for me. I liked the finger sandwiches, quiche and scones the most. \n\nI saw a lot of people come here for girly dates/mother and daughter dates, parties and just for fun. Most little girls dressed up like princesses, how cute. I believe they sell macarons and tins of tea from the counter if you want to take it home to enjoy. I recommend doing reservations ahead of time because they do get filled up especially on weekends and holidays and I saw people get turned away.", "author": "Donna M."}

We've never been to a tea place nor have we ever done Afternoon Tea. So, what better place to do it than out of town?\n\nWe got lucky and found metered parking on the street. When we got there, we were asked if we had reservations, which we didn't. Luckily, we got seated, anyway. The cafe is very cute and pink. Also, if you look at the bottom of the ordering counter, you can see a little door that's reserved for fairies. Daughter thought it was adorable and took a picture. \n\n After looking at the menu, Hubs got cheap and freaked out that it was $40/pp (after tax and tip) so he went in there pretending that we went in for dessert only. LOL. The server recommended that we order from the Trolley Dolly Tea Options list.\n\nDaughter had Pot of Tea and Crumpets. The tea was Alice Drink Me Tea. She liked her tea a lot. The grape taste was strong but it wasn't overpowering, either. She liked the crumpets but wasn't crazy about it.\n\nI had Pot of Tea and Sweets. The tea was Imperial Pu-Erh. I was torn between Pu-Erh and Tieguanyin Oolong. Hubs said that oolong was a bit strong for the stomach so I chose the Pu-Erh. I liked the Pu-Erh a lot. Can't go wrong with it!  My sweets were pistachio macaron, lemon cupcake, strawberry dipped in white chocolate, meringue, and a blueberry muffin (?). After a family meeting, we decided that's what it was because I forgot the name of it. All were good.\n\nHubs had Pot of Tea and Cake. He got Crown & Crumpet Private Blend, based on the server's recommendation. Being a non-enthusiastic tea drinker he is, he made sure he got a to-go cup so he can nurse it the rest of the trip. He liked the Pu-Erh tea much better. The cake was apricot cake. Daughter liked it a lot but Hubs was ok with it.\n\nThe food was average but we came here to soak up the experience and it didn't disappoint. Service was very friendly and informative.

We ending up getting 2 of the \"tea for one\", and they were able to substitute a few of the meat options for me, which was so appreciated!\n\nI ordered the \"pretty in pink\" tea, and my boyfriend tried the \"strawberry fields\". The tea was just perfect! It was just the right level of sweetness, and so fruity! I loved the big teapots, and all of the table wear was just adorable and so pretty! \n\nThe tower of treats came out very quick, and we were told to try the scones and crumpets first since they were fresh from the oven.\n\nThe scone! It was perfection, buttery and flaky, and just melted right in your mouth! I love clotted cream, but its so hard to find stateside, so I was thrilled to just pile that on with the lemon curd and jam. The scone was the best I have had, hands down (including cafes and tea shops in England and Scotland). I had never tried a crumpet, and I loved that as well!\n\nThe tea sandwiches were pretty delicious. I could have eaten a ton of the heart-shaped cucumber sandwiches because they were just divine. The savory scones were also tasty. At this point we were both getting kind of full, but still wanted to sample the treats and tea cakes.\nOf all of the food the desserts were the most underwhelming. They all looked amazing, but the savory food was definitely the star of this caf\u00e9! I did like the vanilla teacake, and the crumble treat was pretty good too!

Gave us some great laughs with her several accents too.  \n\nEven when some of us didn't get some of her jokes and references, she still kept it going and didn't make it awkward.\n\nTea: four were prepared for us with a fifth one given for after food.  A white tea with strawberry, 2 Blacks, peppermint, and one I didn't remember.  They were good.  Each could be served with cream and sugar.\n\nFood: so many finger foods to choose from.  I liked the curry sandwiches and this curry button kinda thing.  We were presented with egg sandwiches, salad, crumpets, biscuits, and served with this imported butter, jam, and a lemon sauce.  Super good.\n\nThe baked goods were great.  I hate eating sweets, but I bake for fun and can tell the baker puts their time into it.  They did an awesome job with the macaroons, which are VERY hard to do.\n\nParty bag?: yes, we were given party bags, inside was a gummy and candy necklace.  Probably meant for the children, BUT it also came with a good amount of tea leaves for us to brew at home.\n\nWould I come back?  Probably not, cause it's not my kinda thing.  But this is a GREAT place for high school or college couples to go on a first date and have a bit of tea and fun.  Kids birthday parties would be a blast.\n\nAdvice for the owners:  keep doing what you're doing.  You have a nitch that no one really abuses in San Fransisco.  I'd have to REALLY search to find another tea place in a very key touresty area.  \n\nIf you REALLY wanted to go the extra mile, I'd recommend making sure the staff were dressed a bit more fancy or be better kept , it is a tea house after all.

The sausage rolls and quiche were so dry and tough, also inedible. Then to top it off for an already subpar experience- found a worm in our dessert.

Their afternoon tea is normally $30/person, which I presume is what draws most people here, so I'm not sure why it's only $$ on Yelp instead of $$$. It's definitely a pricey spot, especially given the small amount of food, but I guess that's expected for afternoon tea. It's been on my bookmarks for a long time after hearing about it from another friend, but honestly, without the discount from the Groupon, I probably would have never made it out here.\n\nThe space and ambiance is a lot different from other afternoon tea places I've been to. Instead of the typical cozy, homey tea rooms that are heavily overflowing with mismatched decor, Crown & Crumpet's space is a lot more open, brightly lit with large windows, and sparsely decorated with minimalistic designs. There's more of an elegant, fancy, classy feel to tea here.\n\nAfternoon tea ($30) includes:\n- Large pot of loose leaf tea\n- 3 assorted tea sandwiches\n- 2 warm savouries\n- 1 scone with strawberry jam, house made lemon curd & clotted cream\n- 1 toasted crumpet\n- 5 desserts/sweets\n\nThere's also a gluten-free option for $35, and I appreciated that they ask about any dietary restrictions when taking our order. The tea and food were just average, but after experiencing afternoon tea at several places, I've come to terms with afternoon tea being more about the company and the setting rather than the tea or food. \n\n/ / /  T E A  / / /\nThere's lots of tea options (black, green, white, fruit & herbal). I got the PRETTY IN PINK [strawberry & vanilla w/ hibiscus, elderberries, blueberries], which was light and fruity. My friend got the STARDUST [black tea with citrus, cloves and little silver dragees], which actually did have sparkle in it! I liked the Stardust a lot more since it had a bolder, fuller flavor.\n\n/ / /  M I D D L E  T I E R  / / /\nThey recommended us start with the middle tier of scones and crumpets while they were still warm. The scone was buttery, flaky and moist! It reminded me more of a biscuit rather than the drier scones I'm used to (and don't like). I wasn't really a fan of the crumpet, which was spongey/chewy and completely tasteless unless it was slathered with jam, curd and/or cream.\n\n/ / /  B O T T O M  T I E R  / / / \nOur sandwiches were egg salad, tuna salad and cucumber cream cheese, all pretty simple and basic. The 2 warm savories were tiny quiches and tiny pigs in blanket, both kind of dry/stale. There was also a little bit of salad greens.\n\n/ / /  T O P  T I E R  / / /\nOur assortment of sweets included cupcakes, pound cake with lavender frosting, palmiers, oatmeal chocolate cookie bars and chocolate covered strawberries. Nothing super special. Everything was decent, except the cupcakes were dry with really sweet frosting. I think my favorite was the lavender frosting from the cake since I've never had anything like it, but the cake itself was just okay.\n\nA nice spot for catching up with a friend or a group, but since it's pretty pricey, it's probably  not a place I'd frequent.

And, bonus, they'll switch out your cup with each pot of tea!\n\nH I G H    T E A    F O O D\nUm, firstly let's just say there's a lot of food, and so BFF and I decided we would save half of the food for our other BFF and just share the other half of the food.

I had never had a crumpet before, so it was an interesting experience.  (Those with trypophobia would not enjoy the holes.)  The scone had a fine sugar and flour texture, which I really appreciated.  Everything else was great, but a fellow patron and I decided the clotted cream portion was far too small!\n\nSAVORIES: Sausage croissant, ham and cheese, cucumber cream cheese, egg tart, and turkey bacon club sandwiches served with a side salad\n\nBFF was observing Lent, and I was observing my sensitive palette and stomach.  I always find sausages to be a little suspicious, but the sandwich was really good.  My next favorite was turkey bacon club which packed flavor.  Maybe the ham and cheese was my least favorite, but that was to be expected for me.  BFF had the others.\n\nSWEETS: espresso brownie, sugar cookie with icing, pound cake, strawberry jam cookie, and chocolate dipped strawberry.\n\nLemme say as a disclaimer that I think we got a lesser dessert plate than those without the Groupon.  We did not get macarons as part of our tea service, but others did.  Totally jealous.  So these were all super sweet, and yet my greedy tastebuds delighted in them.  None was particularly outstanding.\n\nADD-ONS: Chestnut-matcha and grapefruit-currant macarons\nThese were $1.95/ea extra, but totally worth it.  They had a good, moist texture, without crumbling too easily or being hollow.  The grapefruit-currant was the knock out.\n\nT E A\nThe service came with a teapot each, but being tea-holics we ordered more.\n1.  Alice Drink Me (Black) - I took this with sugar and cream and could definitely taste the sweet notes of \"champagne grapes\".  It's a great tea for non-black tea drinkers.  Real black tea drinkers (those of you who are all about the assams, darjeelings, Chinese black teas, English breakfast, or even Earl Grey) might find this too sweet.\n\n2.  Happiness Is... (Green) - This was very pleasant.  BFF and I did this as a blind tasting and tasted many floral and citrus notes.  I don't think I picked up on tropical fruits, per se.  I thought it was pretty decent for a flavored green tea.\n\n3.  Minted Green (Green) - Basically this one is a Moroccan mint.  While refreshing and good, I would save this one as the last one to drink so it doesn't overpower your food.  You'd also get the benefit of a breath freshener.\n\n4.  Bai Mu Dan (White Peony) - Very surprising.  BFF and I regretted not drinking this one with the savories.  It was really delicate, not too sweet and not too heavy.  I agree that it would have complemented any of the courses, but especially the savories.  (All the other sweetened or flavor teas would overpower.)\n\n5.  Swamp Water (Tisane) - DROP THE MIC.  Uh, this was the game changer.  It sounds disgusting, right?  And I hate rooibos!  This was soooooooo delicious.  I really liked how crazy murky green it came out of the pot and yet how flavorful it was.  It goes well with the scone or dessert course or is a good finisher.  GET THIS ONE!", "author": "Michelle M."}

But we got seated on our regular reservation anyways, which was a bit annoying because why would we bother to show up early when we're just going to wait in the lobby anyway? Also when we ordered our tea, they said they were only going to bring 3/7 of them because it wouldn't fit on the table... I was especially upset because my tea, the Keep Calm and Carry On, wasn't one of the three that was brought out first and I was sick so I just kept coughing away, so we had to ask for them to bring out the rest but we were about to leave at that point. I really liked my tea but I really wish I got to drink most of it before we left.\n\nThe food was really good. I really liked the scones, which came out warm, and the tea sandwiches. It was obviously hard to divide everything by seven people, but I was pretty satisfied with what I had.\n\nI'm not sure if I would want to come here again based on this experience.

Although she was really busy when she saw my friend dressed as a bride she didn't stutter and asked for some help to the kitchen to put tables together and accommodate us. We were seven! And Barbie (as she told us we could call her) didn't hesitate even tho she was really busy. She gave us a wonderful experience and was really nice, helpful and chatty and we loved her! She even put a nice wedding center piece in the middle of our table and gave the bride a complementary (and really yummy) cupcake! \n\nThanks Crown & Crumpet for creating such a nice memory for us.

Take advantage of coming here and make time to walk around Japan Town before or after stopping by.  \n\nI made reservations for 2 about a month before coming.  Simple and easy process from the website and I even rec'd a confirmation call from Chris the day before.  Super nice!\n\nI love the cute ambiance, very clean, full of pinks, flowers, delicious pastries and the teapot sets are adorable.  You immediately feel welcomed and know your stay will be well worth it.   Our tea flavors were MARIE ANTOINETTE and PARIS.  Talk about transporting you to FRANCE!! :)  The food was perfect as well from the Sausage rolls to the Tricolore, The best part was having sweets- you must have a Scone.  Do not leave without trying one.  You won't regret it. Add the fluffy butter.  So yum!\n\nWhile we had our tea date, there was a birthday party going on.  I loved seeing the little girls enjoy they tea (they were very well behaved).  Also, I noticed how helpful the servers were.  They were attentive, sweet, understanding  and patient especially during the birthday cake singing, they touched it up with blowing bubbles.  So adorable!\n\nOur server mentioned a private room that we checked out.  I took some photos and will upload later.  But the space is very cute.

You won't run out of tea, and different flavors of tea to try. The staff is extraordinary. They often check in on you, explain every item on the menu, and make sure to ask if you have any food allergies they should know about. The staff here are also very friendly, and will answer any questions you may have.\n\nBut aside from tea quantity, decoration, and their staff aside. This place is just average. The menu (for snacks, and food) is very sparse. There really isn't much. And the sweets were just average while looking cute. It was not mouth-watering nor will I go out of my way to eat it again. But the presentation of the food and snacks will definitely make a good IG post, if that is what you're looking for.\n\nAnd the last detail that made the experience a 4-star instead of 5-star is the pricing. It is definitely $$ or $$$. Very easy to rack up the bill on this one because it is very hard to just order a side of scones (without another pot of tea).

Just wasn't impressed and the photos show it all.\n\nNot even the bread stood out.

But I think this place is fit for a queen (or the many little princesses we saw here).  I made a reservation for 4 and arrived a little before our set time.  We were seated right away and someone came over to explain the menu to us.  Our server was very friendly and attentive and everyone there works as a team, with different people coming over to check on us, bring drinks and food, etc.  \n\nI like the location, heart of Japantown, because of the other things to do closeby.  We spent an hour or so walking around the mall then headed over.  We spent an hour and a half at the Tea Shop.  After tea, we checked out the shop upstairs, then walked down the street to pick up some mochi at Benkyodo.  We parked at the mall and walked everywhere, which made things convenient.\n\nI was  pleasantly surprised by the food.  I thought maybe the real food (sandwiches and lunch items) would be just ok.  When I think Tea Shop I think of tiny pastries, french macarons, and sweets on top of sweets on top of sweets.  But the savory items we had were delicious.  My husband and niece had the chicken mozzarella, my other niece had the sausage puffs, and I had the bacon apple sandwich.  They must make things fresh every day, because we originally wanted to order the soup and chicken pot pie, but they were still in the process of cooking a new batch.  All of us enjoyed our food and the portions were pretty good, each meal comes with a salad and fries.  \n\nWe also ordered a small plate of sweets which included a chocolate covered strawberry, a peanut butter tart, a fruit tart, an earl grey cookie, and a lemon cake.  I tried to lemon cake and earl grey cookie and both were good, not too sweet.\n\nWe ordered a pot of the Marie Antoinette tea and it was so good we also bought some to make at home.  The Marie Antoinette is a strawberry flavored tea.  Each pot makes about 6 cups and they have milk and sugar at the table.  It comes with one free refill.  During our lunch, we finished both pots between the four of us.  We probably could have ordered another pot, but decided to get boba instead.  \n\nOverall though, I had a great time and felt like it was a great place to take two smaller girls.

Phone reservations were required for this, as was a credit card to hold the reservation.  Most of my calls went to voicemail, but they were always returned the same day.  The cost of the tea was $85, with tax and gratuity included.\n\nTea Under the Tree took place on the mezzanine level of the Sir Francis Drake.  The tree was beautiful, and we were lucky enough to get a table right next to it.  The chairs were banquet type chairs and not ideal for hanging purses on, but they had a coat rack off to the side and purse hangers for us to use at our table which was a nice touch.  \n\nI was still taking pictures of the tree and our table set-up when someone came by to pour our sparkling wine and take our tea order.  There were quite a few teas to choose from, but once I saw \"Pretty in Pink\" under the fruit section, I knew that was the tea for me!  Soon after, we took part in a tea tradition that I had never heard of but was something I got a kick out of and that each table ended up doing.  It involved some singing and tube pulling, as I'm not sure how else to describe it.  Each tube contained a tissue paper crown, little piece of paper with jokes on it, and a small gift.  Mine was a miniature picture frame, while my sister got a small luggage tag.\n\nWe didn't have to wait too long for our food to be brought out.  The usual was included: bottom tier with sandwiches, middle with crumpets and scones, and top with desserts.  It was recommended that we start with the middle tier as those items were warm out of the oven.  The crumpet tasted pretty plain, like an English muffin but less flavorful, while the scone was pretty good.  The sandwiches included egg salad, cucumber, and a few others.  Not the best-tasting sandwiches I've had at an afternoon tea, but they were ok and portions were big.  As for dessert, I say this with every afternoon tea review: they've just never been my favorite part of tea and there has maybe been only one or two exceptions to this.\n\nWe got to spend a leisurely couple of hours or so here.  Before our check came, we were given more presents - cute holiday tea ornaments for us to choose from.  While I personally thought the food was just ok, the whole experience was quite lovely, and I would do it again and recommend it to others.

Honestly I think it's best to drink this on its own, no tea or sugar.\n\n- Alice in Wonderland: I actually preferred this over the Strawberry Fields... good balance of flavors and it was good on its own or with a bit of milk and sugar. It's a bit stronger, so it really wakes you up... but the sweetness makes it easy to drink.\n\nThe Afternoon Tea set comes with a tower of sweets and savories to go with your tea. If you ordered 2 sets, then they combine the 2 sets on the tower. I can best describe each tier as this:\n\nMiddle Tier: Scones and crumpets - these were warm and fresh! I'd recommend eating these first. We got blueberry scones that were so buttery and flakey. Crumpets are a little like English muffins, but they're way better. Already buttered and toasty. Both were heavenly and went great with some creme fraiche and the strawberry jam they provided.\n\nBottom Tier: Savory items like cheese twist, turkey BLT sandwiches, egg salad sandwich, open-faced mint cucumber sandwich, tiny sausage rolls, and a salad with strawberry balsamic. Fav item here were the sausage rolls... but they were so tiny! Cheese twist was nice and crunchy. The sandwiches already have the crust off and went really well with the tea, since they gave a nice refreshing contrast. Though apart from the Turkey BLT, most of the sandwiches were pretty bland.\n\nTop Tier: Desserts... from chocolate crinkle cookies, mousse filled chocolate raspberry cups, lemon poppyseed cake, and meringue cookies. We were so full from the last 2 tiers that this was hard to finish. Meringue cookies were my favorite, along with the mousse. It was a great way to end our tea time meal.\n\nI came here expecting the food to be small snacks. Between the tea and tiers of food,  their Afternoon Set really fills you up! Really glad we didn't eat lunch beforehand. If you don't come here super early, I'd suggest sharing an Afternoon tea set and ordering a scone.\n\nI'll be honest - it's a little expensive at regular price... $30 per person for an assortment of pastries, savories, and desserts, and a pot of tea. If the atmosphere was even more intimate, like in a room or something then it might be worth it... but in an open space, you don't get so much of the \"afternoon\" tea feel. For what I paid in the Groupon ($40 after additional discounts), it was worth it. Service was super friendly - our server was nice enough to make suggestions, give us water, and even take a cute photo of my sister and I.\n\nDefinitely looking forward to coming back some day either with a Groupon or a very special occasion. This is really fun to do with a sibling or friends. Tea, food, and conversation? Sounds like an awesome combination.", "author": "Alyanna C."}

They can accommodate requests for gluten free and vegetarian.  I got the afternoon tea ($32 plus $5 for gf). It was a lot of food and I couldn't finish so I got a cute little box to go. I love the matching dishes with the Crown & Crumpet logo on it, some with cute quotes. Service was good and the staff knowledgeable. Food was DELICIOUS! If you get the afternoon tea, the food is pretty much set for you and you don't get to choose the options but that wasn't an issue for me. I just told her gf vegetarian and they took care of me and it was fantastic. It's all the items you'd expect, scones and jam and clotted cream and lemon curd and tea sandwiches and savories and sweets etc. Presentation was beautiful, including fresh flowers on the table, which really made it special.

The workers are helpful and friendly, and they are very tentative and patient as well.\n- Can cater to big parties or to small parties (or even if it's just you coming in for tea!)\n- Tea Service is extremely fun for those who love tea parties with friends, or even for those who want to have a tea party with their little princesses :).\n\nCons:\n- Expensive for just a head for the tea service ($28 per person)\n- Parking is extremely difficult!\n\nFor the tea service, it comes with three layers: \n3.

My friends and I planned a bachelorette party here. Their party package is a great deal. You get to choose your own teas and food before the party. You also get a private room on the second level. At the end, they give you a little goodie bag. My goodie bag had candy and tea. It's not much but at least it was in a pretty packaging and everyone went home with something.\n\nWonderful service. The lady who was helping out our party did a great job. She came to check in on us from time to time, refilled our tea, educated us on why we SHOULDN'T drink with pinkies out, etc. Our private room was also beautifully decorated. Would not have done any better ourselves.\n\nIn terms of tea, I didn't like the Blue Eyes. It tasted very artificial and sweet. Peach Crumpet was very refreshing. I liked the light taste in the peach. And lastly, Lychee Oolong and Jasmine Fancy were my favorites. They taste the most natural with just a hint of flavor.\n\nFor food, the desserts at the top were really sweet. I usually have a huge sweet tooth but these pastries are too much. The second layer were scones and muffin. They were tasty with the strawberry jam and clotted cream. I'm not a huge fan of lemon curd so... Bottom layer, the sandwiches, quiches, and mini sausages. They were tastyy. My friends liked the sausages a lot and ordered another plate. The mini quiches were also good.

The cafe is, however, located inside of the New People building, and it detracted from the experience a bit to see people walking in/out and gawking as they passed by.\n\nMy friend and I decided to get the afternoon tea for two ($28/person), although the menu does offer other separate lunch entrees. The afternoon tea consists of salad, sandwiches, savory pastries, and 4 different small desserts on top. It didn't SEEM like a lot of food (I daresay I could've eaten both of our portions combined), but I actually felt reasonable full afterwards! My favorites were the sandwiches, quiche, and pastries (I just like carbs I guess), especially because the lemon custard and clotted cream were so good! I wasn't as impressed with the desserts; I do think they change this up every so often, but one of ours was just a simple cookie with sprinkles...kind of underwhelming.\n\nAs for the tea, they have an extensive menu of black, white, fruity, and more. Afternoon tea allows you to pick a pot of your own. The descriptions sounded intriguing but the tea itself was not very strong nor flavorful. We got our tea over ice because it was sweltering outside, but were disappointed to find it came in plastic cups and not in a pot, therefore we had no reason to use our dainty little cups with our pinkies out...\n\nService was great however - our waitress answered any questions we had in detail and stopped by periodically to see if we needed refills on our tea. Food came out surprisingly quickly as well. We did make a reservation but it was not crowded at all on a Saturday afternoon (I'd err on the side of caution if there was an event going on in Japantown though).

WOW. The Pretty In Pink tea was a fruit based one, and had delicious hints of strawberries and vanilla, complementing the variety of finger sandwiches, hot savory selections, desserts, scones, and crumpets. The hot chocolate was garnished with a dollop of whipped cream and colorful rainbow sprinkles. Smooth, creamy, and not too rich, it was exactly what I would hope for in a classic cup of hot chocolate.\n\nOn to the food... where do I begin?! The scones and crumpets arrived fresh out of the oven, and both melted in my mouth. Complimented with fresh strawberry jam, clotted cream, and lemon curd, it is easily one of the best tasting scones I've had. I was surprised at the crumpets, as I have had tea at the Ritz in London and wasn't served crumpets... what a great addition! The cucumber and cream cheese \"sandwich\" was out of this world. (I say \"sandwich because it was actually a bread in the shape of a circle with cream cheese and a cucumber on it). It wasn't too rich, and it left me wanting more! \n\nThe twist on a traditional chicken tarragon sandwich (the twist being avocado) was awesome. The egg salad sandwich was as traditional and delicious as you get. \n\nOur waiter was very polite and helpful, recommending what the best tea experience for my friend and myself would be, even giving recommendations on the variety of teas on the menu! \n\nOverall, I will definitely be returning to Crown and Crumpet.

All the girl family members were in attendance to celebrate with her.  We were all lady-like for a day in our summer dresses, cute shoes and adorable handbags.  No white gloves and big fluffy hats were needed, as the decor and tea sets made for a girly fun time of tea and crumpets.\n\nLet me start by saying that all the chinaware are adorably cute and very English-like.  The tea was of high quality because you can actually taste the fruity sweetness from the black tea leaves of Darjeeling, one of my favorite pots of tea.  No sugar or cream required, just taste the full body flavors from the tea.\n\nHere's where I was a tad disappointed.  The tiny cucumber sandwiches, which were impeccably cut tasted dry and a bit stale.  The crumpets, were weirdly mushy with an odd chew texture.  The scones, which are supposed to be dry and crumbliness were too dry and crumby.  I guess the food didn't give me the same joy as seeing all the sweet decoration.  I love the table clothes and cute table sets but it was in a weird location, right at the entry way of the building.  It didn't quite fit in and felt forced.  We ended up sitting close to the doorway where all the passerby's were going in and out of the building.  High traffic was throwing off the cute mojo.  I think adding a white picket fence with flower pots may had made a difference instead of having barrier ropes that look like your going to a nightclub instead of having High Tea.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the overall idea of a tea party is always fun!  It's just a few things need improvements to make it an ultra wow experience.  Customer service was great.  The owner was so nice.  She even complimented us on our handbag choices, which is makes any girl happy.\n\nNOTES: Street parking is tough, save yourself a headache and pay the high price parking lot fee.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-12-17", "description": "RESPONSE TO OWNER'S COMMENTS:\n\nI appreciated Amy the owner responding so promptly to my review. Here are a few things that I would like to address for the readers.\n\n1) To provide some context, I rarely give 1 or 2 stars - check my Yelp profile and you'd see that most of my reviews are 4 or 5 stars. My goal is to be fair to the business: Give credit where it's due, and call it out when there is room for improvement. \n\n2) Consistency of reviews: If you read other reviews for Crown and Crumpet which are 2 stars or less, a few others also mentioned that the service felt rushed (one other reviewer even described it as \"insincere\"). \n\n3) Amy is thinking in the right direction to want to learn from feedback, and I could provide an actionable one: Setting expectation is very important. When I go to a Chinese restaurant that on average charges $10-15 per head, I understand that the service will be very basic and I might get kicked out in an hour. No complaint there because that was expected going in. However, when people think of afternoon tea (especially one that charges $30 per person + tips), it isn't unreasonable to expect to be there for 2+ hours. If I had to give up my table by 4.30pm (for a 2.45pm appointment), the server should have let me know right at the beginning and perhaps I would have ordered something smaller that my friend and I could have finished in a shorter amount of time. \n\n4) Calling out this paragraph from Amy's comment: \"OH sorry, some millennials arrived late and they don't want to leave yet so you can wait or go somewhere else...?\" - It sucked for everyone that my friend was late (she's usually on time but shit happens), but stereotype and attacking of the millennials (or in fact, any generation) is not cool. (And hence this review stays at 2 stars.)\n\n5) Another of Amy's comment that I had to respond to: \"You say that most restaurants in the US \"rarely rush their diners to try and turn the tables quickly\", well that may be true if you run a 60 seat restaurant with plenty of room but we have 12 tables that seat 32 people.\" - Also not true. I've been to plenty of places that are small and busy (including New York where the people are supposed to be more rude), but they'd either set the expectation up front that I could only have the table for x amount of time due to an upcoming reservation, or they don't rush you. \n\nAnyway, I've spent more time than I should on this. Just want to give the readers a fair representation of what happened and what to expect. As for Amy and team, try to set expectations upfront. That could have made everyone happier. Cheers! \n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: \n\nDO NOT come here if you expect to enjoy a leisurely afternoon tea. \n\nOn Friday night my friend suggested this place for Saturday afternoon and the latest reservation they have for 2 was at 2.45pm. I arrived right on time but my friend was stuck in traffic. I got seated promptly, and my first impression was how close the tables were to each other. It was also at the entrance of an Asian mall, fenced off by some ropes. Like a few other reviews have mentioned, this place doesn't have the ambiance of a leisurely tea room, it's more like a tea cafeteria. \n\nI was in for an unpleasant surprise when I saw the menu because they have replaced the $30 tea for one with a $48 \"holiday\" tea for one and the split charge (for sharing) has increased from $6 to $8. (The $30 regular set is off the menu - basically you have no choice if you want a tea set in a 3-tier set.) There was no mention of this when we made our reservation - basically we had to pay $18 more for some cider (which came in a paper cup), 2 tiny pieces of sweets and a useless \"holiday gift\" that I am sure costs less than $1.\n\nDuring the 20 mins while I was waiting for my friend (yes she was super late), the server came by at least 3 times to ask whether I was ready to order. By 4pm (1 hr 15 mins after my reservation/ less than an hour after I've placed my order), the server came by with the check, and kept coming back every 5-10 mins to try to clear away our plates. Apparently they had another reservation around 4.30pm. Um hello?!?! This is afternoon tea, which should be done at a leisurely pace. Instead, we felt rushed the entire time we were there. (Actually, restaurants or cafes in the US rarely rush their diners to try to turn the tables quickly, except really cheap Asian restaurants.)\n\nThe only pros were the scones that actually tasted pretty decent by American standard (I've been to afternoon tea in many places including London, New York and Hong Kong, and scones is my benchmark for how good the food is), which was the reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one. The total check came up to be ~$60 + tip for 2 people - at that price I'm better off going to Samovar (their scones are inferior, but everything else was better) or Dartealing. I totally regretted tipping them even 15% - should have done only 10% to reflect their pushy and opportunistic attitude.", "author": "Mel L."}

My cousin took me to Crown & Crumpet because she saw it in a YouTube celebrity's video. I don't think I would have found this place otherwise! I was immediately enchanted but it's quaint and dainty atmosphere, as we sat down for some afternoon tea.\n\nWe settled on the Afternoon Tea for One which is $28 with a split charge of $6. We should have gone for that split charge but instead got two orders of that special. Lots of food, including scones, crumpets, tea sandwiches, green salad, and three pieces of sweets. \n\nI chose the Alice \"Drink Me\" Tea which is blended with champagne and tiny sugar crystals. Once of the best teas I've ever had! Would definitely come back for that. The teapot has so much tea, too... so all I would want for a future afternoon snack is that tea and perhaps a scone. The food, however, was gross. I physically had trouble downing the sandwiches, and the sweets did not look appetizing.

But to be blunt, Crown & Crumpet is good enough, but nothing to knock my socks off.  \nIt's the tearoom I go to if I really want a high tea service but can't get a table at (or don't want to pay for) a nicer or more authentic place -- note though that reservations are recommended, especially for the weekend.  There's nothing bad about their tea service, but in terms of the atmosphere, customer service, and quality of the food, Crown & Crumpet is just middling.  \n\nI think the atmosphere (in an open, modern space that shares area with a bunch of different businesses) is what really gets me-- it's not a cozy, dark, quiet tearoom; instead you are in the middle of a public mall, separated from the front doorway and looky-loos coming in and out by a mere line divider.  The wall of windows on one side of the tearoom lets in a lot of natural sunlight (depending on the time of day, sometimes too much) and provides ample people-watching, which is nice.  Overall, I find the location and layout rather distracting, though I'm sure others would like the more modern atmosphere (it's definitely not as frilly as many other tearooms).\n\nStaff was pretty friendly, although the way the shop is set up makes it a bit confusing to check in for your reservation.  We also had to wait a while for our teapots to be refilled, although it was quite busy the last time I was there.\n\nThe food is, again, good but nothing extraordinary.  The scones were a bit dry, but still perfectly edible.  The tea sandwiches and mini desserts were a little hit-or-miss; the quality of the ingredients used seemed to vary.", "author": "M. T."}

Not very intimate or quiet depending on who is coming in and out. But decor and set-up is very cute. We made an 11am reservation on a Saturday because parking would be easier since it doesn't\nreally get busy or crowded until a little later. We all ordered the Afternoon Tea for One which comes with a variety of finger sandwiches, savories (no variety on this visit..little wieners in puff pastry), scone, crumpet, and assorted sweets. The sandwiches were good..egg salad, cucumber, and ham. The scone was warm, fresh and buttery. Yum. Served with clotted cream, lemon curd, and strawberry jam. Unfortunately, they scoop into dishes that is the same size and amount whether you are a party of one or three. Other than the sandwiches and scone, I could and did skip the rest. The sweets just did not visually appeal to me. They look \"used.\" My perspective might have been skewed due to the fact that since we were the first customers of the day and we saw half cut cakes in their display, it was clear that they save baked goods from the previous day. So why am I still giving four stars? Because what was good there was really good. And they do serve AMAZING tea. All the teas we chose were robust and flavorful... Happiness, Alice Drink Me Up, and Darjeeling Second Flush. My friend was sad they were out of the Swamp, but hope they restock by the time she returns. The service was also very nice, except at the end when another server asked us to leave because the next reservation had arrived. Plan ahead, our server could have let us know when we paid the bill. Another server telling us to get out felt unwelcoming and rude. But again, I did not allow that one faux pas to taint this review.", "author": "Carrie W."}

Also she attended with me, I did get to speak with the owner probably more than the average guest.\n\nThat said, still a wonderful experience that was recommended to me by a number of friends, and even one of my guests had been there the previous weekend.\n\nI've always wanted to do a tea room: I like tea, I like lots of different food, and I like new experiences. Besides my friend working here, as a fan of Japantown I've been past the shop a number of times and my friend set up a reservation for me. \n\nNote: If coming on a weekend, you might want to make a reservation.\n\nNow not going to lie, my party was one of the few with men - for the most part the customer base was female. And if that bothers you, go hang out in the Marina. I enjoyed the low key atmosphere.\n\nWhile I knew I was going with a tea for one, picking a tea itself was far more difficult. They have an impressive selection of classic teas, house favorites, fruit teas and more. I went with a vanilla caramel flavored tea, though the Strawberry Fields was also intriguing. Everyone at my table ordered a different tea and we should have shared, but the bottle sparkling rose may have had a hand in that.\n\nWith the tea for one, the bottom level came with three sandwiches - all made that day. One was ham and cheese, one was turkey and bacon, and one was tuna. All were delicious, as was the side salad with a raspberry vinaigrette. Lastly on this level was a biscuit with cheese and mushroom, and a small pig in a blanket.\n\nThe middle level had a blueberry scone and a crumpet. One of my guests got a raspberry scone, and a bit jealous but the blueberry was excellent. And I love crumpets! To spread on these were strawberry jam, house made lemon curd & clotted cream (no idea what the last one is). I put all three over both savouries and they were delicious. Starting to get full at this point...\n\nThe top level was 5 sweets - a homemade churro that was awesome and I should have dipped into my tea, a chocolate chip cookie that had a lot of weird things on it but still good, a great tiny brownie. The last two were not things I eat so I offered to the table - a bit of tea mousse in a chocolate tulip, and a meringue. My friend who ate both really enjoyed them.\n\nWith that we kept drinking until roughly closing time - much to the staff's chagrin people still kept coming in, but my friend told me they are pretty flexible with the closing time.\n\nFor tables of 2 to 8, they can easily sit you in the main area, though they do have a private room.

My boyfriend and I were very pleased with our food, tea, and experience. \n\nFood- My boyfriend being on the less adventurous side, got the cinnamon toast. I tasted it and it was very good for what it was, cinnamon and sugar on toasted pillowy bread. It was accompanied by a large strawberry which was very sweet, I found that generous. \n\nI went for the afternoon tea, which I loved tremendously. \nThe savories were the open face cucumber sand which, ham salad tea sand which, egg salad tea sandwhich, sausage roll, and veggie quiche. The tea sandwiches tasted delicious as I could tell they had detail put into the flavors, as the very light cucumber and herb flavor and rich egg salad flavor was rightfully accompanied by white bread, and the more robust taste of ham and scallions was great with nutty whole wheat bread. My favorite thing about the quiche was that the crust was crisp like a freshly baked cracker and still warm. Maybe my only complaint is the sausage roll not being big enough, since I loved it so much I for sure Wanted more of that smoky sausage and puff pastry combination. All of it was accompanied by a light raspberry vinegrette spring salad with cherry tomatoes. \nThe next layer was to die for, a fresh warm blueberry scone and crumpet? Sign me up. The strawberry preserves, lemon curd, and clotted cream were flavorful but didn't over power the pastries. I had the scone with the cream and jam, very soft and moist with good crumb but didnt fall apart, not at all too sweet either. The crumpet was TO DIE FOR both my boyfriend and I split it with lemon curd and I practically had my eyes roll to the back ofy head. The soft texture on the top and very crunchy bottom with all the nooks and crannies filled with lemon curd was just the most delicious thing on the tea tower. \nThe third layer, the sweets, were all delicious. I appreciate that they are all handmade and had sprinkles! We had a mint mouse cup, chocolate strawberry, carrot cake, lemon poppy cake, and coconut brownie. All of these were delicious, my boyfriend loved the mint mouse and was attracted to its little tea cup chocolate shell and coconut and mint candy decorations, my favorite was the lemon poppy cake, since it was so dense and fudgy with the zip of lemon and crunch of poppy seeds. Though I was too full to enjoy the other sweets while they were fresh, they were great the next morning as a treat after easter breakfast, my family loved them, highlight being the moist carrot cake and rich chocolate flavor of the brownie. \n\nTea- We had two tea pots, the mint tea and the special sakura green tea. Though I dont have nearly as much to say about it, they too were delicious! The perfect thing when relaxing from the huge sakura festival crowd. The green tea sakura had the pleasantly bitter and floral taste I adore, I had it with cream and a teaspoon of sugar each time. My sweetheart had the mint tea, not my forte, but he seemed to like it as he is a huge mint lover and big on tea. The thing that I loved about it was that it was enough for 5 cups worth! A super deal and I felt so much like a princess having my own tea cup! \n\nExperience- Delightful, amazing, wonderful. Our \"Trolley Dollies\" were very kind. and I'm so happy that they were accommodating to me not being able to make my reservation as the San Fransisco parking during the festival threw us through a loop. They explained to me everything on my tower and asked us about dietary restrictions before we had finished ordering, very considerate of this place. I love the cute decor, and casual vibe. I didnt feel like I had to be too nice to enjoy myself. I also certainly loved the 30$ price tag for tea service. It was a bargain for tea service considering at hotels its usually 70$+ for tea and doesn't leave you nearly as full! It was the perfect city getaway since im from the California central valley. I loved it as my first afternoon tea experience and celebration for my year and a half anniversary! I can't wait to go back for the planner par-tea to celebrate my graduation! \n\nTLDR: Everything was good and its worth the price as afternoon tea.

Well, I guess it really was morning tea. I've had afternoon tea before, and the experience was \"meh\". This time, I hoped that it would be better. I was wrong.\n\nAMBIANCE: Crown and Crumpet is in a huge building in Japantown SF that has multiple uses. I have to say that I haven't been to that particular building in a while, so I was greatly surprised by the location of it. It's literally in the first floor lobby of the building. We constantly saw people going up and down elevators and walk around us to go to the escape room on the second floor. The ambiance was definitely not that of an afternoon tea place and certainly withdrew from the experience that I was expecting. \n\nFOOD: The food options that they gave us, or the \"Afternoon Tea for One\" was LACKING IN QUALITY. They gave us the following, which I will presume to critique:\n\nAFTERNOON TEA FOR ONE: $28\n\nLAYER ONE: \n-mini cupcakes with sprinkles: nothing much\n-blueberry lemon tart: pastry was nice and crunchy and the lemon filling was ok\n-chocolate mousse cups with sprinkles: it was OK.\n-lemon cakes: I didn't really like it the taste of it and it stuck to the roof of your mouth\nLAYER TWO: \n-crumpets with jam, lemon sauce, butter: crumpets were amazing\n-blueberry scones: it was all right\nLAYER THREE:\n-ham and cheese sandwich with wheat bread: the saddest sandwich I have eaten in a long time. They simply chopped up ham and added shredded american cheese. It did not taste good at all.\n-cucumber sandwich: only one slice of bread with cucumbers and cream cheese resulted in a small sandwich with a boring taste.\n-egg sandwich: meh.\n-mini hot dogs: I've never eaten such a small hot dog in my life.\n\nTEAS:\n-Marie Antoinette: roses and strawberry. Wasn't too fond of this tea. \n-Blue Eyes: orange, apple, rosehips, hibiscus, and cornflower petals. I don't like fruity teas and this was no exception.\n-Strawberry Fields: Green tea with strawberry and vanilla flavor. it was OK. I'm a sucker for green teas so this added a nice and fruity taste to it even though I don't like fruit teas.\n-Minted Green: mint added to green tea. Was nice and refreshing.\n\nThe experience could have been improved with the following: \nIncrease the size of your protein items.\nAdd more protein items (smoked salmon maybe?)\nCut the ham and cheese sandwich since most people can make that at home.\nAdd another dessert.\nAmbiance: 2 stars for a weird lobby location and people staring at you as they come out of the elevator\nService: 4 stars since it was nice and sufficient.\nFood: 3 stars since the food was meh.\n\nBottom Line: Service was OK, tea was OK, but food was lacking for the price. Try someplace else.", "author": "Andrew C."}

It ranges from $45 at the Fairmont to $68 at the Palace Hotel for their basic tea service. (Alcohol is  more!) Crown & Crumpet is at a fine price point for tea, and for tea in SF. Now, if you don't want to spend $30 on tea, you can just get a small pot of tea and a pair of scones for around $12-13. There are also sandwiches. \n\nMy mother and I enjoyed our tea very much. We thought there were a couple items on the tea which were not as good as they could have been. The chocolate chip cookie was very hard (not just butter crispy), yet the chocolate was soft; overcooked? The little hot dog in puff pastry was just a tad over cooked also. The sandwiches were fine, basic, but fresh and tasty. The sweets were fine. \n\nExcellent selection of tea. It was properly brewed and delicious. \n\nThe 5 star item on the tea were the scones. Our were currant and were fresh, hot, and very tasty. The clotted cream and lemon curd went perfectly with them.

Too bad I didn't come sooner when they had their main location at Ghirardelli Square, because this tea stop cafe left much to be desired. \n\nTo me, afternoon tea is all about the ambiance and experience. Usually you're sucked into a vortex of pink & floral everything, or a cute homey mismatched vibe (think Lovejoys), but I felt like this location definitely lacked that. It was sectioned off from the building with those ropes (are we at a nightclub?), tables just lined up, and just lacked the atmosphere of a tea room... more like a tea cafeteria? \n\nWe each ordered the afternoon tea for one ($28) and it came with 3 tea sandwiches, salad, a scone, crumpet and a few sweets. I don't expect much from the food at tea places, but the scone was pretty good here! Our sweets weren't anything to write home about though, the meringues were chewy/sticky, there was a cake or caramel bar no one was a fan of, a chocolate cookie and a chocolate dipped strawberry. Although service was friendly when we got seated, and she did check up on us a few times at the very beginning, our tea pots were never checked on and refilled, that's a first at a tea place for me! \n\nI'd hold off on coming here if you want the frou-frou afternoon tea experience, but if you're hankering to shell out $28 for tea and some food served up on a 3-tier stand, be my guest! I hope they open their full location again soon.", "author": "Teresa N."}

I don't know how my messages got lost, but finally someone put me through to their event coordinator Amy. Unfortunately I didn't get the time that I wanted but I was still able to book the day that I wanted. Amy was very accommodating and thoroughly explained their process to me. \n\nI chose this place because my girl wanted high tea and this place looked really cute. It had a nice private room for guests. It can be hard to find a venue for 10+ people in SF. I also liked that party favors were included with the price. Corkage fee was $10 per bottle and included flutes for all the guests. \n\nThere was more than enough food for everyone. Although I felt some of the bread on the sandwiches were a little stale. The desserts weren't as cute as they were the last time I had high tea with C&C. We enjoyed the privacy of the room and it was quite spacious.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-02-24", "description": "After my last visit to Crown and Crumpet I think I will wait a while before I return. \n\nThe first time I'd been here I had a small pot of tea and a scone with a variety of jam, clotted cream and lemon curd. It was tasty but pricey. It wasn't very crowded but the service was slow and I felt almost like I was bothering the young woman. I had Marie Antoinette tea and it was very good. I enjoyed myself even if there were minor things that needed improvement. \n\nI came back with my mother and daughter earlier this month for my birthday. It was after noon on a Friday and we didn't gave a reservation and I had a Groupon. \n\nWe were greeted and seated but almost begrudgingly. There was one person behind the counter and the same young woman as my previous visit tending to tables, it wasn't very busy (4 other tables?) but our table was all but ignored. The Groupon was good for two adult afternoon teas, so we purchased a separate child's afternoon tea for my little girl.\n\nThe waitress (trolley dolly) was rather curt with us and so much so I wondered if I had said something wrong or they were closing early (they weren't). I wasn't demanding and she didn't know it was my birthday, the only special request I had was that the tea sandwiches have no beef or pork for dietary reasons. I was told we couldn't pick what sandwiches we got, it was \"chef's selection\", but we were accommodated because it was a diet/nutrition issue. \n\nOur teas were just ok this time--my mother and I both had the black house tea. It was truly nothing special. The tea I had had on my previous visit was much better. My daughter got a small pot of strawberry tea which she liked and when I tasted it I found it pleasant and appropriate for a child. \n\nThe food was really disappointing. The tea sandwiches tasted old/stale/dry. I've had canned tuna fish on white Wonder bread that tasted better. The cookies were sloppily made/iced and I wouldn't be surprised if they were store bought. Again, the highlight was the scone and the accompanying jam. \n\nThere was a lot of food left over but we were all so unimpressed we left most of it. Had I spent full price I would've been very upset--the price does not match the quality or quantity of the product. The pot of tea was very large and each person had their own, but that was the only plentiful item on our table. \n\nI had alerted our server we had a valid Groupon and she even took it before we had been served. However, when we got our bill there was a special note left with our tab that advised patrons of paying the tip for the full price of our tea/meal. I found this in really poor taste. If we had been in a small town perhaps I could excuse it, but as locals it left a really bad taste in my mouth after the spotty service and sub par food. We tipped on the pre Groupon price. Isn't it common knowledge that this is standard, especially in San Francisco? \n\nThe shop itself is cute but oddly situated. For $29 per adult/$15 per child I expected a lot more.", "author": "Bianca U."}

The Marie Antoinette tea was delicious and flavorful. There were at least a dozen others that also sounded worth trying. Tea for One comes with a little taste of everything you could want, a tiny sausage roll wrapped with puff pastry, chocolate dipped strawberry...a crumpet, a scone, with generous amounts of clotted creme, lemon curd and jam.

It is definitely something different for San Francisco and fun for kids and well as for adults, BUT honestly if you expect a good food as good as the ambiance you will be really disappointed and even more disappointed when you get a bill. Food experience is leaving a lot to be desired:( \nWe ordered \"Afternoon Tea for One \"-$32 where deserts were not good at all. They had one Safeway type of mini cupcake, one mini raspberry crumb cake, which tasted more like from a refrigerator where the crust was absorbed by the raspberry jam and was cold and soft rather than a freshly ordered coffee shop desert. \"Chicken Pot Pie \"-$14 was warmed up in rather microwave than in the oven otherwise the filo dough would have been crispy:( Salads were very typical to a supermarket type premade rather than something you can order even at a deli section at Whole Foods would taste a lot better for the same amount of money.\nThen we also ordered sausage plate with the same salad served as part of the \"afternoon tea for one\" item and 5-piece mini sausage in filo dough. So basically we got three plates with the same side salad, ok sweets, and generally Ok service. For all that our bill was $87 where my son had to get up and ask them to bring the bill because no one was coming to check on us for sometime. We were brought a square tablet to pay where you cannot avoid leaving tips 15% - all came to about $97. Considering nobody is cleaning your table after seeing you are done at least with salad part. Any way the point is that San Francisco nowadays has so many great coffee shops, lunch places where they offer if not a huge variety of salads but they would be interesting and unlike something I can make at home. Makes this place becomes not about food AT ALL. And it is not about whether you ever traveled to England and had a real tea time experience where you can compare. Sadly the quality of the food really disappointed us for such a great idea to have this type of restaurant here in SF. So I guess we are not going back there again:(", "author": "LOVEMYKIDS L."}

Crown & Crumpet is located on the ground level of a mixed-use building in Japan town that includes a movie theatre and eyelash extension spot. It's cutesy and modern with lots of wall to wall windows that invite the sunlight to bathe over you.\n\nMy friend and I each got the afternoon tea special which included a pot of tea, three chef's curated tea sandwiches, a warm scone, crumpet, pig in a blanket, quiche, and dessert. Looking back, it probably would have been best if we split just one order even if there is an additional cost to do so.\n\nWhen the owner was around it was obvious that she was super excited and passionate about giving each individual a great experience but the level of detail was not provided by the other servers. The service provided was not terrible, but you could just see the stark difference in energy. \n\nTo be honest, the food was okay. I was not a fan of the tea sandwiches, quiche or crumpet.

But today was anything but.\n\nI made a reservation a week in advance for 10 guys -- no special occasion, we just wanted afternoon tea. I got a phone call no less than three times asking about our party and whether we'd like to place pre-orders. I think Crown & Crumpet must be used to getting crap about food arriving at different times, because my group was constantly reminded that they have a \"tiny kitchen\" and orders that are not tea services might take longer.\n\nWell, they didn't. Tea, the food services, and other menu items all arrived promptly, with only one waiter (that I saw) serving our table. Moreover, the other menu items were really good! I remember specifically two friends getting the sausage roll plate and thinking it would be little microwaved pigs in blankets. But these were actually full sausages with salad and chips.\n\nThe tea was good. I didn't ask them to fix this, but one thing that sucked is the teapots don't fully contain the loose leaves, and some of them end up at the bottom of your cup. Restaurants typically will have a filter to put over the cup, or maybe our waiter could have replaced us with fresh cups.\n\nThe other thing you should watch is how much tea you're getting. We didn't have to pay extra, but I did notice they capped refilling a teapot to just once, which I think makes sense on the business end of keeping tables rotating. But especially for expensive services -- even though this one runs cheaper in SF -- the whole darn point is the tea, so I don't think Crown & Crumpet should be stingy with the refills. It's not something that actually was an issue for our group, but customers should watch out for it anyway!\n\nDefinitely a place I'll come back to someday, and sort of a gem considering how easy it was to make a reservation.", "author": "David S."}

I think it's a little expensive for what it is - I saw some other reviewers point out that it's affordable compared to the Fairmont or the Palace Hotel, but i don't think that's a great comparison - this place has people who are visiting the rest of the shops in the building shuffling by and staring, and in general, is MUCH more casual than either hotel. That being said, I still really recommend it for a special occasion, catching up with friends, or even feeling fancy on your own. I've also seen private parties do well here. \n\nAs for catering, I did meet with the owner to get a catering quote for a friend's wedding a few months back, and despite repeated follow-up, she never got back to us with an email. Based on that experience, I wouldn't choose them for event catering.", "author": "SF C."}

Within minutes a fresh pot of private blend black tea was brought out followed by a tray of pastries, and sandwiches. \nFood was average with the ham sandwich and scone being some of the standouts in addition to the jam, lemon curd and clotted cream. If you are looking for a meal this is not the place. Food is light, and minimal in portion. Some cons to take note of with regard to the overall aesthetic included chipped ceramic being used as well as a loud atmosphere with multiple parties housed at various tables snuggled within a small space. \nA FYI note; beware!

I was surprised how small it is and for the price I was expecting  a tea service in a full scale tea room or restaurant for the price per person. The tables are so close together barely enough room to move in between the tables. There was a bridal shower party at the table behind our table and they were taking pictures, I felt that I was in their way. But the place is too small nowhere to go. I felt like I was in a lobby or a hallway.\n\nThe service staff was nice and helpful, explained what was what on each tier of the serving plates.  I would give them 5 stars. I don't like that they charge $6 to split the tea plates and you don't get to pick what sandwiches you get, its pre-selected. I am not a kid who can't make up my mind.  For 2 people including tip was $71, so 36 per person for tea.  They have tea for one, it should be tea for 2.  It was worth to try, but I don't think I will go again until they find a new location downtown that is an actual restaurant.", "author": "Alix J."}

When I saw the decorations in Crown and Crumpet from outside, I was determined to love it. \n\nComing in, the decorations were gorgeous, each table is adorned with adorable table cloths and fresh flowers. The plates are also really cute with nice sayings on them, and some of the crockery has the Crown & Crumpet logo on it which is so cute and fancy. The clock on the wall was made of little tea cups on saucers which definitely added to the atmosphere of the place. The shop is so beautifully decorated but in my opinion, pretty decor is all that Crown and Crumpet has going for it.\n\n\nCons:\n1. The menu for teas was very limited. The BF and I shared a teapot of Peach Crumpet tea which smelled amazing in the pot, but tasted very mediocre and bitter. Almost like the kind of tea you could get just anywhere, which did not at all justify the price point.  I was so disappointed because I love tea. On the plus side, I did love the way the teapot was designed so you could pull the teabag out of the teapot before the tea became too bitter.\n\nFor tea lovers, Dartealing Lounge offers a much better tea menu with really amazing and fragrant teas. \n\n2. I had some of their scones and was not particularly impressed. Each serving of scones cost $6 and comes with a lemon cream, strawberry jam and clotted cream. It was okay. :/ Not something that would draw me back again\n\n3. Price - It was disappointing to see that they charge an additional $6 for two people to share their afternoon tea set. \n\n4. The service was really sub par, and unhelpful and a little snooty. \n\nIn conclusion, Crown and Crumpets has a great concept, but in order to be worth the price point they are charging, they have a long way to go in improving food and service. I suggest checking out other tea stops like Dartealing, which has much better food, service and teas, and overall value for money than Crown and Crumpets. Or if you are looking for a more high-end place which is worth your money, Lovejoy is a really nice stop.\n\nC&C wasn't terrible, it was just terribly unimpressive.

They also have an Afternoon Tea, which I will definitely try next time I'm here. The only con is that they are pricey. My scones were $8 (but so worth it!), Afternoon tea for one person is $28 and any split plate is an additional $6. Also the place is relatively small.

As recommended by the waiter, we attacked the warm scones first and it was delicious and fluffy, I highly recommend!

I was so sad when they were no longer a business I could visit for tea so I went elsewhere. It wasn't great. \n\nWhen I say devastated - I mean it sincerely.  With the harsh economic climate forcing so many businesses to close, Crown and Crumpet was one I didn't want to bite the dust. \n\nIt was too special. Such a great place to have relaxing mother-daughter dates. My daughters are 23 and 16. We are very close. We still do a lot of things together. Like Mother Daughter tea. \n\nRecently my 16 year old wanted to have a mother daughter date with me to close her spring break so we chose tea. The usual suspects came to mind - nothing special.\n\nThen she found Crown and Crumpet Tea Stop in Japantown! Oh I was so happy. I was jumping for joy! \n\nYou know me - I asked the owner the question we all want to know: \n\nWhat happened? Why did you leave that amazing setup in Ghirardelli Square? \n\nAnswer: Because they doubled the rent which would have made a profit impossible with the foot traffic there. The goal is to move downtown for that rent, knowing the foot traffic makes stable profit a stronger possibility. \n\nIt made sense for Crown and Crumpet to downsize and keep the business functional than to completely shut down. Yes, the new space is different - but the whimsical varietals of teas you can't get anywhere else still reign here. \n\nOh come on - you aren't going to get Stardust Tea with silver sparkles, or Marie Antoinette with Champagne, or Snow White feminine fruity flavored tea anywhere but here! Those are just a few of the special teas they serve. \n\nI know. I've been to tea all over the city. Imagine my disappointment with the bare bone basic tea offerings I could easily have brewed at home. \n\nThe bites? I love the dainty bites that are deceptively filling! Afternoon tea for two is a lot of food. We never finish everything. \n\nMe and my girls love tea with panache, girly flair, and so much fun! We always get that at Crown and Crumpet! \n\nSo Yelpers - put your money where your mouth is. Stop complaining about a space that keeps this great mom and pop functioning. Embrace the change and support them with your business so they can eventually move to a downtown location with the setup we all know and love....or more correctly, \"All the bells and whistles\" as the owner said. \n\nAfternoon tea for two? $50\n\nA date with my daughter in a business we both love? Priceless. \n\nI joined Yelp 7 years ago to support great mom and pop's in my community. Crown and Crumpet is one of those businesses.", "author": "Jennifer C P."}

I almost missed it when I was trying to find it because I was looking for a stand alone store, but it was inside the New People Building. My friend booked the reservation for 2, but because we got their early from the South Bay. We decided to give them a call to see if we could be seated earlier and they were very accommodating.\n\nThey have a bit of an odd set up since there's a lot of clothing shops and other things in the building. The decor is cute, but I think it would be cuter if they could decorate the whole space. They have a room upstairs that is for parties, it's a decent size but seemed kinda stuffy inside.\n\nIt was pretty empty when we got there at 1 on a Monday. Since it was my first time, I asked the waitress about the different kinds of teas and what she recommended. I like stronger flavored teas and picked the Paris tea which is a black tea with caramel, vanilla and more. We also ordered the Tea for one and were given a choice of a plate splitting fee of I think $6 or we could order another pot of tea. So we tried a lighter tea: strawberry fields. I absolutely loved the Paris tea! It was so flavorful and delicious! The strawberry fields tea smelled just like strawberries and definitely had a lighter taste in comparison.\n\nThe tea for one was just okay. Nothing was stand out amazing. It was my first time trying crumpet though, and that was quite yummy. The service was just okay too. It was hard to wave down someone whenever we needed something like our tea pot refilled.

I practically drooled over those goodies that I knew I wanted to go to Crown & Crumpet Tea Stop Cafe and it would be the perfect place to celebrate not only Easter but also my younger sister's birthday (April 18).\n\nThe original plan was to attend the Cherry Blossom Festival Parade and find a place to dine at.  I did not have to search far, as I knew my sister loves to drink tea and we have never had afternoon tea.  I was also glad that Cousin Connie was with us, and also she has never had afternoon tea.  It was our first time.\n\nI called and booked the reservation for 12:30 PM, and I must say it worked out perfectly.  By the time we were finished with afternoon tea, we headed out the door in time to see the commencement of the parade...wow...perfect timing.\n\nEven though the cafe was in the lobby of 1746 Post Street (the New People Building), the ambiance was quite charming and took me back to imagining little girls dressed up with their favorite dolls/plush animals sitting in the chairs next to them, sipping on imaginery tea in tiny colorful teacups with matching plates and giggling at each other.\n\nThe three of us ordered the afternoon tea, which came with three large pots of teas - any flavor that we desired.  The three-tier trays consisted of delicious finger sandwiches (turkey/cranberry, chopped ham 'n cheese, and egg salad), miniature bacon and spinach quiches, blueberry scones, crumpets served with clotted cream, lemon curd and strawberry jam, and a delightful tray of bite size fudgy rich brownies, raspberry and apricot tarts, and mousse tarts.  We couldn't finish the scones and crumpets and the accompaniements of jam, curd and cream and the large pots of tea.  In other words, our eyes got bigger than our stomachs.

I don't like the idea that you can't split  the 28-dollar 'tea for one' set unless you pay 6 dollars split fee. Even on the 28 dollar plates, every bite is so tiny. Not sure if all the sweets are baked in house. But in general, it's worth trying for at least one time.", "author": "Carrie Z."}

The quality of the food is excellent.  The scone made me fall off my chair.  We'd stopped going to the Palace because the food had gotten downright crappy, not worth any price.\n2.  We really like high tea, as well as a la carte tea stuff.  We like to go in jeans & a t-shirt, on a whim, without it being a special occasion.  We can do that here.  Going to the Palace was always an Event, which was fun once a year but not something we'd indulge in often.  And it seemed like we always needed a reservation at Lovejoy's.  I guess I should hope these folks were popular enough to require a reservation, but during the week you still don't.  Score!\n3.  Service is excellent, perfect for the ambiance, attentive and friendly.\n4.  Price is appropriate for the quality of the food & the environment.\n5.  They've done a great job creating a homey spot in a somewhat - um - alternative environment.  Would I like to see them in their own cute little shop?  Initially I thought so but now I'm not sure.  I never visited when they were over at Ghiradelli Square so I don't know how they handled it.  Lovejoy's has a cute little shop, but it's too crowded & too twee for my taste.

I called right at 11am Sunday morning to see whether we needed a reservation or not. The person on the phone highly suggested we did since it gets busy. The earliest reservation was at 2pm which we gladly booked since we had some errands to run before anyway. My mom, two siblings, and I arrived a little early but luckily they had an available table so we were seated right away. I told the server (Christopher) it was our first time visiting and he did an awesome job explaining the menu and tea selections. My mom and I ordered Tea for Two which we were able to opt for a vegetarian option (brownie points!!!). Being big Disney fans we obviously chose to pair it with 'Alice Drink Me Tea' and 'Snow White Tea . My brother ordered the chicken mozzarella hot pressed sandwich with a matcha latte. Lastly, we ordered my little sister a nursery tea with which she choose to have hot chocolate instead of tea. \n\nWhen everything was ready, our server nearly placed the towers, plates, and pots on the table. He then went on to describe each tier of the tower and the specifics of my brothers dish. Since the crumpets and scones were fresh out the oven he suggested we started with them. They were so perfect, I've never had anything like it. My favorite spread was the lemon curd. It was so good I wanted to put it on everything. We moved on to the bottom tier of the tower which had mixed greens, egg salad sandwiches, cucumber cream cheese thing, and mini quiches. All absolutely delicious! I was already getting pretty full by the time it we were moving on to the dessert tier, so I only tried the brownie and mini cake. Both pretty good. All of our delicious foods were tied together with literally the best tasting tea I've ever had. The Disney names made them even better. \n\nSince it was my moms birthday, she was surprised by a candle lit cupcake! Our server sang with us and even blew bubbles while she blew out the candle. Not sure what flavor the cupcake was but it was very good. Everything about this visit couldn't have been better. Even when my brothers matcha latte was forgotten, when reminded our server quickly brought one out with a complimentary matcha macaron for forgetting. Great food, even greater service!!!

They have been at this location on Post for 3 years now, and we were in search for a place for high tea for my MIL for December 26. Of course, Love Joy, Palace Hotel, etc., were all booked, so we decided to try this place. We booked a 11am reservation and apparently it was the first reservation of the day. We had difficulty finding the place, it wasn't in its own stand alone shop and it was in the middle of Japan town. An unusual place for an English Tea shop, in my opinion.\n\nWe opened the front door of 1746 Post Street, which seemed to be a mini mall of small shops, a tiny cinema, and Crown & Crumpet .... right in the lobby. It seemed like a pop up location and very odd set up. We arrived 15 minutes early and the were still setting up. It was a little awkward.\n\nAt 11:01am, we were finally asked to be seated. I honestly don't know why they couldn't have seated us 5 minutes earlier as a courteous. It's not like there was comfortable seating in that lobby, as we watched them set every single table. Bad points for not so great customer service thus far. \n\nAfter we were seated, I felt a little more comfortable... and we looked over the menu. They had a lot to offer, but we came for the holiday tea - scones, crumpets, tea sandwiches etc. We placed our orders and tea selections. My SIL asked about the difference between the Chai and Roibois chai (sp?) and was told one was caffeinated and one was not. The answer from our waitstaff seemed a little short and snarky... and I was expecting a tiny bit of feedback about some sort of different... but perhaps not.\n\nIn my past experience with high tea, we typically select our own tea sandwiches, where this place it is all pre-set. The scones were good, but likely store bought... the crumpet was flat like a pancake and not what I was use to, but both were OK. The tea sandwiches were only OK... and the bread seemed a little stale to me. No petty fours....    =(\n\nI won't be coming back. I do not recommend this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-12-19", "description": "Very disappointing visit. The service was very kind and upbeat, but other than this, the entire experience was a let down. Let's break it down:\n\nEnvironment\nThe area looks very nice in the pictures, however upon arrival It almost had a food court vibe since it's in the open but small lobby of a mall/department store. There were cute but cheap looking decorations slipped everywhere and there were stains on the seat cushion, so needless to say, not a very good first impression. It just seemed a bit messy and thrown together; not neat or organized. This was the biggest disappointment for me, as I really value the ambience in a cafe or restaurant. This is especially so when it comes to afternoon tea, as you're often paying for the elegant/experience and not the food and drinks itself. I see that a few other reviews have written about this (the setting), and obviously I agree with them.\n \nFood\nMy friend and I both ordered the Holiday Tea for One sets. It comes with a pot of tea for each, and a three tiered set of desserts and finger foods to share between the two of us. If I remember correctly, there were three different sandwiches, a small salad, a few tiny appetizers, a scone and crumpet, and finally an assortment of desserts at the top. Unfortunately, it was nothing special - the bread was stale on the sandwiches, a lot of it was VERY buttery, and the gingerbread cookie was so hard that when I snapped it in my hands (after a lot of effort) the sugar icing and sprinkles flew up everywhere and all over me. The only pieces I enjoyed were the macaron and tiny cheesecake tart (those were tasty!). I'm not much of an expert of teas, but my friend is and did not enjoy hers (Blue Eyes) much. Lastly, I did realize afterwards that we were never served cider, which is part of the set. It apparently comes with a take home mug which we were not given either.\n\nService\nOur server was very nice! Very energetic and helped us navigate through the tea selections; super helpful. No complaints here :)\n\nPrice\nAt ~$48 per person/afternoon tea set, I really expected a bit more. I really regret spending my money here. I would be much more satisfied with the experience I got with about half the price, if even.\n\nConclusion\nOverall, the afternoon tea really did not justify the price. I would say this is a cute, pricey place to take a child for a fun meal and that's it. For my situation - 2 young women catching up - We would've been better off going to one of SF's many coffee shops or bakeries. If not, come prepared with a Groupon (I saw a few reviews mention this) or come with lowered expectations.\n\n*EDIT: after scrolling down and reading a few more reviews, I see that the normal price for the afternoon tea set outside holiday season is closer to ~$30 per person and not the $48 we paid. While this sounds better, it still seems very pricey for what you get and I would still not return at that price point.", "author": "Ai-Lun L."}

This was my first time at the Tea Stop Cafe location and it was such a sweet place. The man who called to confirm our reservation was very professional and answered all the questions i had. When we arrived our server was wonderful. She was patient with us when we were figuring out what to order and super helpful when i was asking about some of the different things on the menu. My husband and i ordered a nursery tea with a pretty in pink pot of tea and a crown craft for my two year old. She was absolutely amazed with the whole experience! Getting to wear a princess crown she made, the beautiful environment, the tea and learning to strain and add sugar to her tea was so much fun for her. My husband and i ordered the Avocado toast, Chicken Mozzarella and Almond Butter toast. Everything was SO delicious! We also bought some Pretty In Pink tea to go since my daughter loved it so much. We will definitely be going back for more enjoyment and to buy more tea!", "author": "Rachel Rose G."}

Didn't quite have the feel of an afternoon tea place. However, the service was excellent and because there weren't many customers at the time my sister and I went, we received a lot of attention.\n\nThe Groupon deal includes two types of teas and an afternoon tea set of three: finger sandwiches, blueberry scones, and of course, sweets. \n\nWe ordered the Alice Drink Me tea and the Stardust tea. I was a bigger fan of the Stardust tea- I'm a sucker for Chai teas in general so this particular type was right up my alley. \n\nThe finger food was interesting. Some unique morsels on the plate including a sandwich with a curry meat of some type (Chicken?). My sister wasn't a fan. I consumed both egg salad sandwiches as they were delicious! The sweets included lavender cookies, which were a tad too hard for my taste, meringue, and a variant of Rice Krispies. I was unimpressed with those Rice Krispies which definitely seemed like fruit loops...\n\nI think the winner was the blueberry scone though. Eat it warm and the crumbly insides will make you melt. So so so good. My sister and I wished we got a whole plate of just those scones! \n\nOverall, average place for afternoon tea. The Groupon made this shop a great experience but I'm not sure I would return without a good deal.", "author": "Kristi L."}

Let's pop in for a spot of tea, shall we?\n\n\"Tea Under the Tree\" by Crown and Crumpet is a spiced holiday blend of fun, sweets, savories and bottomless bubbles, set against the gilded, iconic backdrop of the Sir Francis Drake Hotel mezzanine salon. \n\nWhy am I a reliable judge of a high tea, you ask?  (Even if you didn't ask, I'm going to tell you).  I have been lucky enough to partake of high teas at the Empress Hotel in Vancouver and the Savoy in London.  Crown and Crumpet can hang with the best of them but still retains it's own unique flair.  \n\n(Did I mention the bottomless bubbles?  Just saying...)\n\nIn terms of setting, The Savoy, The Empress Hotel and The Sir Francis Drake are all equally elegant and charming in their own way, so let's take that out of the equation.\n\nC&C has a memorable tower of treats that hit all the targets, from salty and savory to sweet and tart.  I particularly enjoyed the salmon sandwich and the adorable open-faced bites with cucumbers splayed like petals.  Their clotted cream, a special, in-house blend, was yummy, though I would have liked a bit more, and their lemon curd is ultra smooth and deliciously zingy.  The scones were timed to come to the table warm and had so much butter packed into the dough that they quite literally fall apart in your mouth.\n\n(Reminder: Bottomless bubbles!  Seriously, they just kept coming!)  \n\nIn thinking back on the Empress Hotel's tea, I would say the main difference is in the style of C&C's service.  The Empress was phenomenal all around, with stellar tea, precise and snappy service, high quality nibbles and sweets both beautiful and tasty.  While C&C also had stellar tea and delicious treats, they provide a slightly less stuffy service, with an effervescent and whimsical approach that is almost a bit Seussian.  Case in point, there was a table with three kids (sat near their accompanying adults) who were clearly enjoying themselves.  Not to mention, the owner herself visits each table and exuberantly leads everyone in a quick holiday song and a traditional pop of English style \"crackers\" (you know them, they're those colorful tubes that pull apart with a \"crack\" and produce some funny bits and bobs, including a crown for each person).  As far as I know, it isn't something done at most high teas, but it really starts the event off with a festive feel.  Between the pop of champagne corks and the crack of crackers, the whole event felt like a real celebration. \n\n(See how I worked in another reminder bout the bottomless bubbles there?!)\n\nFinally, there is the outstanding tea selection offered by C&C.  Both the Savoy and the Empress had a few options, but the C&C really shines with it's tea offering.  Not only are a wide array of distinct teas offered, from spicy to floral to traditional, the tea names are really on another level.  My particular favorites were: \"Marie Antoinette\", \"Paris\", \"Duke of Earl\" and, of course, the \"Swamp Water\".  I mean, you know a tea place is havin' a laugh when they have a tea named Swamp Water! \n\n(Also, bottomless bubbles!)\n\nIndeed (I don't really need to emphasize here, but one must use words like \"indeed\" when reviewing a high tea), I enjoyed the C&C Tea Under the Tree event so much, I will undoubtedly be going to their Japan Town location.  I also think their teas would make great holiday gifts.\n\nHappy Holidays!\nThe Loving Critic", "author": "Haps P."}

It's wide open with simply a rope that hangs around the space they rent.  The service was good but why I can't give them more stars is the limited menu.  There are not a lot of choices on their finger sandwiches.  It's not even listed on their menu.  They will simply just bring you the assortments.  For vegetarian options, they had a choice of egg salad and cream cheese with cucumber.  Even for non vegetarian options, there were only three kinds. No wonder they don't list them on their menu!

Because of traffic and some miscommunication among our group, we were actually late for our reservation and did not order anything until over a half hour after our reservation time, but even then the staff was very helpful and understanding.\n\nThe ambience was a mixed bag, as on the one hand it was in the lobby of a larger building, but they did try hard to have their section decorated up. The teas were very good and we could get refills on hot water so that we were all very full on tea. Pretty much every tea we had tasted good, you could not go wrong with any selection. As for the food, we were not as impressed. The sandwiches were probably the best aspect of the food tray, as the scones were on the smaller side compared to a scone you could get at tea in England.

My mom and I came here early on a Thursday morning; there was just this one other table enjoying their food at the time. We were seated promptly once we got to their counter. We used our Groupon voucher to have their Afternoon tea for two (when it wasn't even noon yet, ha ha.) The waitress/owner(?) was really nice and patient; she showed and explained clearly to us about their tea menu. Per her recommendation, my mom and I got a pot of their Crown & Crumpet Private blend, and a pot of Marie Antoinette. My mother was thrilled about the private blend as it Classic English tea taste that reminded her of the ones she has had when we still lived in Hong Kong. I loved the sweet floral scent from the Marie Antoinette. \n\nTheir food was decent and more than we could indulge. On the bottom tier we got two pieces each of three different types of sandwiches (ham and cheese, egg salad, and curried chicken), couple pizza bites, and tiny size salad. The mid-tier which was also our favorite we had crumpets and scones with strawberry jam, house made lemon curd & clotted cream. On the top-tier we have a variety of sweet treats including chocolate covered strawberries, cookies, etc. We both enjoyed the crumpets and scones the most. My mom also loved the lemon curd a lot. \n\nOverall, it was a pleasant experience, as it hasn't been as easy to enjoy afternoon tea here in the bay as it was when we lived in Hong Kong.

It's out in the open like in the entry way of a mini shopping mall. But, you have to admit the decor is cute. The owner is also friendly, which makes supporting a business like this worth while.\n\nThe place is small, so there isn't room for much walking or many people. In fact when we were there, some people were waiting to get a table. And I'm not sure if they do reservations. We came early and told them that we had a party of 5 and needed a table. Walked around Japantown and came back to our table already set up for us.\n\nWe had a bridal shower here, just us close friends and girls. The owner placed a centerpiece I think she had lying around in the middle of our table. (I posted a photo if anyone wants to see). But then we had to ask her to remove it because the table space was so small and our treats didn't fit.\n\nFor $28 you get afternoon tea enough and more than plenty for two. $24 for one. But if you opt to split there is a splitting fee. And if you don't pay the splitting fee, you must get a side or a la carte item. We ordered 5 teas, two trays and a few macaroons on the side for a total of $124. It's pretty high and ended up being $30 a person with tip, but I say that's a good deal for city prices.\n\nMy only concern and complaint is that they could not accommodate me very well due to my choice to not eat dairy. Every sandwich has dairy. And the girl kept suggesting I order an egg sandwhich *shrugs shoulders*, but (that's also dairy ahem). I had to opt for a ham sandwich with apple (which I much rather have preferred PB&J, no offense). So if you're allergic, eat certain things by choice.. this place may not be for you. \n\nThe teas are very good and we had a few favorites.

The decorations are really cute and over the top but that's what they're aiming for so it makes it really fun. I wish this place had a little more privacy. It's right by the entrance of this little mall type building so people are always staring as they walk in. \n\nThey have a pretty good tea selection from traditional teas to fruity blends. We had a larger party so we just shared 5 large pots and ordered extra food on the side. All the teas were really good and you could ask to refill the hot water. The afternoon tea set came with a variety of sandwiches which were the only savory things on the menu. Was not a huge fan of the crumpet or scone, both were too greasy for my liking. I'm pretty sure the mini quiches they had were from Costco and the desserts were probably not home made. Was expecting some higher quality food but the experience was pleasant enough overall. \n\nWe wanted to do this as a birthday surprise for our friend so they were able to set up the table with special birthday decorations. They also gave our friend a complimentary macaron, but I'm sure they just use whatever dessert is available. This place seems like it would be a good option for just a light snack and some tea in a more casual atmosphere. If you're looking for a real afternoon tea experience, this probably wouldn't be the best place for that.", "author": "Maryann S."}

There other location is so much better in terms of ambiance.\n\n I had a little tradition a couple of years ago where I would go to Gary Danko on my birthday and then the next morning I would come here for tea. I also would come a couple of times a year and have tea for no reason. \n\nThe last time I was here, the day after my birthday, I was really disappointed with the food. We got the tiniest sandwiches and 3 out of 4 just had peppers in it. The one sandwich that had some kind of chicken sandwich had about a half a teaspoon of filling.\n\n After feeling dissatisfied and ripped off, I told myself never again. A couple years went by and I decided since it was a new location that I was going to give them one more chance. \n\nI ended up coming on my actual birthday a couple of weeks ago and again I was disappointed but for different reasons. The sandwiches were actually slightly bigger and had minimal but a decent amount of filling but the place was sooooo hot. We were sitting there sweating while we were eating and we didn't even have hot tea. \n\nAlso, its like in the lobby of a building which really takes away from the ambiance.

The table cloths were flowers and like a scrapbook with hotel cards, stamps and other souvenir of sorts.  Against the window is a cushioned bench. We arrived at 10:55am but those seats were already reserved. On those particular table also they had pretty fresh roses displayed in tea pots.   \n\nI love all the options of tea.  Our server has short blonde hair with also greens and blues.  She was very sweet and knowledgeable.  We chose the afternoon tea so that we could try a little bit of everything along with the stardust tea for the \"sparkle\" factor.  The tea pot she brought out, let steep then pull up the chain to complete the process.  She suggested 3 minutes for full body.  5min seemed to be right for me. You could barely see the gold flakes in the tea, but the flavor was perfection.  Add some whole milk and it was complete.  And for the price of $24 for all that we ordered it also comes with 1 free tea refill! More than enough for the two of us.  The savories and sweets were plated on 3 tiers.  3 sandwiches: Ham and cheese (Cut and mixed not layered in slices) I didn't like bread with seeds on this one. Egg salad, everything you can expect.  Lastly cucumber cream cheese! That we had to add another order even though we were full, it tasted so good.  I found the scone tastes good with the lemon curd.  The sour and sweet balance each other.  I spread both the clotted cream and the jam on my crumpet soooo yummy!  By the time we reached the sweets I was full!   I had to taste a bite of everything.  The eclair was petite and good. The sugar cookie was also nice. The peppermint mousse is best describes as this... Liquified sugar canes! Not really my taste.   Our server was truly attentive had answers to our and every guests questions.  From what to order to the origins of teas she knew it all. Bill totaled to $32 before tip.

I haven't had any tea parties really but from my experience, I didn't think this could be the best it'll ever be.\n\nFirst off, I think they're expensive (Surprise! We are in SF after all in one of the biggest tourist spots) and that the staff was spread a little thin.\n\nTara P. decided to have a tea party for her birthday here and we got together to try this place out. The little party room upstairs was all decked out in cutesy plushiness. Honestly, I felt a little claustrophobic but it does add to the decor. The chairs were small white wood chairs that were uncomfortable and, in my opinion, almost scary for anyone larger than me. I can almost imagine  little girls wearing princess dresses (or I guess big girls in this case) with frilly bows and crowns offering you a spot of milk for your teal. There are stuffed animals, dishes and various other types of eclectic pieces all on the wall, the tables, everywhere. My gripe is that apart of this room seemed like it was storage. While some of the random stuff was covered by doily-like cloths, workers were coming in and out of the room to grab things and to prep during our party.\n\nFor the party, three plates are set out on a plate holder that held sandwiches, pastries and sweeter pastries. For our party, we received 3 sets of these. I really have to give it to them for the food. I've nary a better quiche, scone and chocolate covered strawberry in the same place. Sandwiches are meh but for all of the other items listed, I would gladly come and get them. I don't know if they sell the items individually, if any one knows!\n\nThe tea, itself, is good. They were all crisp, flavorful and refreshing. Each pot came with a little marker so that we knew which was which. Here is another issue that came up, I'm not even sure if we were supposed to have wait service but this is the part where I'm going to explain why I thought the staff was spread too thin. Our teapots at some point ran COMPLETELY dry. I had 1 cup and nothing for the next 20-30 minutes. Nobody was checking in on us and nobody was available for us to call from our private room. When the person who was assisting us was there, she tried her best to accomodate us and even did an English accent and made jokes with us. I truly appreciate her going the whole nines in this act so that we get the full experience but she seemed rushed and distracted.\n\nAll in all, I liked Crown & Crumpet but I don't think they're the best and I'm not particularly sure about whether or not I'm a fan...\n\nEither way, enjoy!", "author": "Win\u00e8 C."}

I have had tea in all the so-called \"best\" places around the world, but the Crown and Crumpet is by far one of my favorites!", "author": "Barbara V."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-04-09", "description": "My first experience with afternoon tea and English tea rooms was with C&C in Ghiradelli Square in January of 2011, and it changed my life. Not even exaggerating. Now I'm always on the hunt for new tea rooms to try out. So I was obviously crushed when C&C had to close their Ghiradelli location.\n\nFast forward to 2013: I was super excited to hear that C&C was once again back in existence!! Unfortunately, I couldn't help but compare this new location to the old, and it is just not the same.\n\nLOCATION:\nThe Crown and Crumpet Tea Shop Cafe is located on the ground floor, essentially the lobby, of the New People mall building. It's much more downsized now, with fewer tables and decorations but still maintaining some of the cuteness :)\n\nAMBIANCE:\nIt was a little strange to be in so \"public\" an area and I can see it getting rather loud and echo-y on busier days. It was alright when I went.\nNeeds more decorations: it had little bits of cute here and there, but still felt like it could do with some more personal touches.\n\n\nFOOD:\nMy friend and I got Afternoon Tea for Two:\n-The sandwiches were very delicious, the salad light and refreshing. I really loved the little mushroom bite, very savory: http://bit.ly/10HwIX3\n-The blueberry scones were GREAT. Fluffy and moist and amazing. Loved the crumpets as well: http://bit.ly/10Hwyia\n-Desserts were both delicious and adorable (LOVE the little chocolate teacups: http://bit.ly/10Hw6k3\n-For tea, my friend got the Earl Grey and I got the Chai-ed and Loving It. Both were very good and of course, they gave us a little bit of milk in a tiny adorable pitcher to go with it.\n\nSERVICE:\nThere were only two ladies working there when we arrived, so they didn't have our reserved table set up yet, but no worries. Both were very nice and helpful during the whole process and expanded on the teas when we asked. It actually got rather busy even though it was a Monday but they were on top of everything. Our food came quickly, and they explained about each of the sandwiches, the scones, and the desserts.\n\nAlas, however, I could not help but compare to \"the old\" Crown & Crumpet the whole time. I realize they probably had little choice in the matter, but the new location is but a shadow of the C&C most people have come to know and love.\n\nThe differences:\n-Likely because of the small space and small kitchen, the tea selection is very small compared to before. No more long, lovely descriptions either, so you'll have to ask your server for more info! (See photo: http://bit.ly/10HsRcy )\n**My best friend said this actually made her feel better because she's horrible with having a large number of choices, and the list given was already a bit much lol...so to each their own**\n-Again, likely because of the same reasons, the a la carte food menu is smaller, and you are no longer able to pick the sandwiches you would like to go with your afternoon tea. (See photo: http://bit.ly/10Hu4QU )\n-Afternoon tea no longer includes lemon curd and the clotted cream is in a little jar(i.e. no longer homemade); I've seen the same one sold at Cost Plus.\n\nTo some, these may be a deal-breaker, and at the least it was somewhat disappointing.\n\nVERDICT:\nI trust in C&C, but I probably won't be back for a while, since there are many other \"complete\" tea rooms in SF and the Bay Area I have yet to try. If they find another location that allows them to be the amazing tea room I know they can be, I'll be back for sure.", "author": "Rissa F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-04-01", "description": "I am really heartbroken at how my recent visit to the Crown and Crumpet Tea Stop turned out to be. :( The Ghirardelli location is like Tea Stop's pretty, overachieving older sister, no matter what little Tea Stop tries to do to emulate big sis, it fails. It's heart wrenching to watch the \"it\" place to go celebrate your birthdays and anniversaries, become a out-of-place lobby coffee-shop-type front.\n\nThe location is quite awkward. It is literally in the lobby entrance of the New People's building. When I first heard about the Tea Stop, I thought that it would occupy it's own private floor in the New People's building. I didn't mind this at all at first because there were several cute shops housed in the New People's Building. I thought that C& C would fit in perfectly fine amidst Baby the Stars Shine Bright & Liza Lisa. Sadly, but thsi new location lacked the inviting and cozy decor and atmosphere that made me fall in \n\nEnters Anna and her BF. We stood there debating should we pick the most comfy table and sit down or do we approach the counter tucked far away from the entrance. The area was roped off with a deco-flower post stating \"Open\" in calligraphy, but the girl at the cash register seemed occupied with what seemed like an inventory task. The table each had a \"reserved\" placard, but no guests were to be seen in sight. It was very confusing and awkward. It took a full 5 minutes for us to get seated. My suggestion is to walk up to the cashier and ask to be seated - regardless of if you have a reservation or not.\n\nOn to the food - The menu has been cut down to 2 pages with limited tea selection and meal options. The afternoon tea is now $22, decrease from the past $26 (per person for a Tea for Two). It comes with four sandwiches, a scone, a crumpet, and a selection of four desserts. You get one less scone than previously before but at a savings of $4. :P They also didn't do a split plate fee, which is awesome.\n\nWe ordered Strawberry Fields tea, a green tea that's very fragrant of strawberries (obviously). I shared it with the BF because from past experience, we never finished two full pots of tea. We craved the lychee oolong, but I guess that'd have to wait till the official C&C opened.\n\nBF ordered the sausage rolls which were sausages halved and enveloped in a puff pastry. They came with a side of vinaigretted greens and a mustard looking condiment. They looked like glorified pigs in a blanket but tasted delicious. It kinda made me regret ordered an afternoon tea for one for a bit, but he shared. :)\n\nThe sandwiches have decreased in quality. I guess with limited kitchen and storage space, it is hard to make their unique sandwich creations with such wide selection of ingredients as before. The tuna felt bland and dry, as was the egg salad. They didn't have any spices or flavors added to it to give them a better flavor. The other two sandwiches were very boring, one was grated American cheese and the other was cucumber. I thought that was very unoriginal and could definitely be improved upon. I remember these sandwiches used to have a variety of unexpected combinations that were a combination of surprise and delicious. Please bring that back!\n\nThe crumpet was very...oily. Each bite yielded hot drops of oil all over my plate, napkins, and my dress. :( I don't care much for crumpets so NBD. The scone was was blueberry and gluten-free and was very crumbly and delish. I would have preferred two scones to a scone and a crumpet, but that'd defeat the second C in C&C. The strawberry jam went very nicely with the scone. There was no lemon curd which resulted in my great sadness, but there is Devonshire cream in a tiny jar. They are no longer house-made and piped perfectly onto tiny plates.\n\nThe sweets I got were a chocolate mousse, a tiny cheesecake, a minuscule chocolate cake slice, and a itty bitty graham cracker and brownie bar. The mousse was very rich and topped with white chocolate shavings served in a tiny glass with a faux-silver spoon. I don't really like chocolate much so BF ate it. The cheesecake was pretty good, I wished it came in bigger portions. The bar and cake fell into the same chocolate category and were promptly fed to BF.\n\nOverall, I long for the official C&C to open. The Tea Stop would have to suffice for now, but there is so much to long for that cannot be satisfied.", "author": "Anna F."}

The desserts that come with the afternoon tea are delicious too - usually these are my least favorite part at other tea shops, for one reason or another, but here, they were almost my favorite!

Naturally, I was ecstatic to learn that they had reopened earlier this month in Japantown. My friend and I made reservations through open table and we were off!\n\nFirst of all, my friend and I got lost for 45 minutes. It was raining on and off that day and it's not pleasant walking up and down the street looking for some signage that says \"Crown & Crumpets\" All I got from the previous reviews was that the shop was located at the entrance of another building. The Japantown mall is across from the shop so we thought we would find it in one of the entrances there. I called 3 times. All 3 times they never picked up. We asked around and one of the girls at a bakery knew what we were talking about and told us that we could find the shop at the New People store across the street.\n\nTIP TIP TIP: Crown and Crumpets is located INSIDE the New People Store\n\nThey should really have some signage outside.\n______\n\nFinally we were seated after a good workout outside. There were very little seating inside, and the decor was kept minimalistic. Everything was white was random buttons plastered onto the walls. I would say that it was Alice in Wonderland inspired. Good idea, but bad execution. The shop definitely was not as cute at the other tea rooms I've been to. The only thing I found cute were the tea pots and cups. They all had adorable quotes on them that I liked reading.\n\nWe had the afternoon tea for one with an extra pot of tea. For our teas we ordered the stardust and the after 7:59 (i believe this was the number). The 7:59 tea went really well with the desserts and the chocolate mousse. The scones were good, but the crumpets tasted stale to me. The sandwiches were standard fare. They weren''t anything spectacular. I ended up not taking more than 2 bites of each slice. The food came out lukewarm\n\nService was slow. Our server seemed nice but they had enough people in the back to get our order in a timely manner and get us our check. It wasn't particularly busy so I don't understand why it would take 30 minutes to our order and 30 minutes to get us our checks. \n\nMy experience here was not a positive one and I won't be coming back.", "author": "Tawny L."}

I'm not sure what I was thinking haha it functions just as any other restaurant would. So my friend and I looked over the menu and decided to order a pot of tea, an entree and an extra dish a la carte.

The two of us came here last Saturday before a CAAMFest show for lunch and were a bit surprised and a little confused about the location (lobby of the New People building) and layout of this place, which is set up like a self-serve bakery / coffee shop but the seating area is exclusively for tea service, so we ended up kind of standing around looking awkward for a while until we were asked if we were there under a reservation (which we were). They seemed pretty busy, though, so we had to wait a while.\n\nAnyway, we ordered the tea for two, which was surprisingly filling. It comes with three plates -- sandwich plate, crumpet and scone plate, and dessert plate -- and tea. The sandwich plate had 4 different sandwiches and a little side of lettuce. I thought they were all good, though the shrimp + mayo sandwich was definitely my favorite. The scones were nice and flaky and went really well with the soft, creamy richness of the Devonshire cream and jam. The crumpets were buttery and a bit chewy, but I was getting pretty full and the crumpets had cooled by the time we got to them so I couldn't finish them. I recommend eating them while they're hot. The dessert plate was nice, though a bit sweet for my liking. I liked the mini cream puffs.\n\nAnd finally, the tea. I'm not sure how I feel about leaving the leaves in the pot since it can oversteep, but you can pull up on the chain to lift the infuser out of the water. I had the strawberry fields tea. Yummy, especially when left to cool a bit.\n\nOverall I had a nice time, and I came out much fuller than I would have thought.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-05-24", "description": "So I'll try and keep this short. I've been to Crown & Crumpet about 2-3 times before this most recent time, and I've always thought that they were good enough to go back. The staff is overall very nice and accommodating, however, I do want to talk about my most recent visit with my best friend and little sister. \n\nFirst of all, it was our fault that we arrived a little late. I kept updating it to a later time, and we were still a bit late because of SF traffic (on a Saturday afternoon of all days...) They said that they would accommodate us but that they didn't have any other reservations for later in the day ( we had attempted to change it since we were running late). They told us that they were fully booked, however, when we looked online, the app said that there was an appointment available for 4:30 pm and 5 pm. \n\nAnyway, we arrived at the New People building and were seated promptly, although I think they were rushed to get us seated since we were late. However, when we arrived, not many people showed up for their reservations until we were almost done eating. \n\nMy best friend and I ordered the tea for 1 which was brought out on 1 3-tier platter. My friend is pescatarian, and can therefore only eat fish as a meat and they did not have any fish available (such as a salmon sandwich). They only had a vegetarian option which was egg salad sandwich. My little sister ordered the soup, which she said was overflowing with peas (it was a veggie soup) and her salad had minimal dressing on it. \n\nREVIEW: \n\nMy biggest complaint is with how the 3-tier platter was set up and what we actually got. For 1 person, at $30, we got 2 sandwiches, a scone, a crumpet, a small \"savory\" (in my case, a 1 inch hot dog wrapped in a croissant....literally 1 inch.), and like 3 desserts. I do not think this was worth it at all. \n\nThe sandwiches that I received were an egg salad sandwich and a ham sandwich. Since my friend was a pescartarian, she just got two egg salad sandwiches (which she didn't even like and no savory at all). They didn't even ask her what she would prefer for a vegetarian option. The sandwiches were alright, however, for both of them, they had green onions in it. I've never heard of green onions in egg salad before. The bread was also a bit dry. \n\nThe mini savory was....pathetic. Literally 1 inch. The salad was pointless and I don't even think they put dressing on it. \n\nThe only redeeming good thing was the blueberry scone which they said had \"just come out of the oven\". The lemon curd, clotted cream and jam didn't disappoint. The crumpet was supposedly fresh as well, but mine was slightly burnt and hard. \n\nFinally, when it came to the desserts, it was just a big disappointment. We got a strawberry covered in chocolate, a ganache-filled chocolate, a small piece of vanilla cake and a chocolate chip cookie. The cookie was hard as a rock. Literally. I tried to bite into it and couldn't, so I just spit it out. The vanilla cake was alright, although it was cold, like it had been in the refrigerator. I feel like it could have been room temperature at least. When I looked at what others around us were receiving, they got different sandwiches and different desserts from us that looked a lot better. I'm not sure why we were the only ones to get cake and the cookies while others got a nice looking pudding cup and a nicer looking cake. Maybe because we were late? I don't know. I feel like there could be more selection from the customer's standpoint on what we get to eat, especially for those with dietary restrictions and preferences on certain sweets. \n\nThe best thing about the food/drink we had was the tea. Except my sisters, which was the jasmine green tea. It was way too strong. I had to change my cup because the flavor was overpowering. Our waiter did balance it out again with water, so that was nice. The tea that my friend had was the Stardust black tea. It was subtly sweet with cinnamon undertones and the half and half complimented it pretty nicely.  \n\nSince my sister ordered a green and my friend ordered a black tea, I decided to order something from the fruit/herbal tea section. I asked for a popular choice and our waiter suggested the \"Murky Waters\" tea, which was a dark fruity tea mixed with subtle hints of pineapple and mango I believe. It was my favorite tea. I really enjoyed it. My sister and friend liked it too. On the tea tag though it said \"Swamp Water\" that threw me off, I think they just updated the name. \n\nAnyway, all in all, the staff at Crown & Crumpet are really nice and accommodating, however, I feel like they missed the mark this time. For the price I paid (over $80 after tip), I was expecting better food. In my opinion, Dartealing is a much better tea room. I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon for tea time here.", "author": "Michele M."}

The crystal chandeliers are no longer, cute wall paper gone, couches and fireplace no more.  The food that once was made from scratch seems store bought, definitely microwaved, and mass produced from an outside source. No homemade marshmallows for the hit chocolate, no cute shaped sugar cubes for tea.  This is not what I was expecting, nor is it a place I'd want to revisit. On our tower of goodies, some of our selections were burnt, and rubbery. This just wasn't the tea experience it once was.", "author": "Melanie P."}

This new location is inside the new people building across from Japantown which is bit hard to find if you didn't know it was inside new people. This is considered high tea with small bites and teas which too me is cute but a bit pricey since many of these stuff you can whip it up yourself for a way cheaper price. They do have a good variety of small bites ranging from cookies, crumpets, scones,salads and sandwiches and etc. They also have lots of different flavor teas to choose from too!

It was super sweet, just as I always hope for in hot tea. Honestly the best I've ever had! There were 5 of us, so each of us ordered some food and one pot of tea (came with one free refill whoo hoo!), otherwise sharing food would bring the a la carte prices up to $6, yikes! Cinnamon toast was the best (of course I can make this at home for way cheaper). I loved that they had almond butter toast, though! Almond butter is MAD expensive, upwards of $7 a jar, so I was excited they had it here. I don't recommend ordering it along with nutella toast as I did, though... they were both hard to eat because everything kept sticking to the roof of my mouth LOL!

For 4 of us it came out to ~$150 (tip included) and I just don't see why anybody would pay so much for what they get here. \n\nI arrived with my sister earlier than the rest of our party so we checked in at the cash register and the person who greeted us told us we had a 2 hour limit because another party was reserved at 4pm, which was completely fine. However, the way she said it was really... off. She said, \"So yeah, after 2 hours we're going to have to kick you out.. ahaha.\" Super awkward and rude. \n\nThey seated me and my sister and we waited quite a while before the rest of the party came (maybe 45 minutes into our 2 hours slot) and during this time they had already given us our menu, but the party wanted us to wait before ordering so we did. Our server kept coming and asking us if we wanted to order and we made it known we were waiting for the rest of our family, so we felt pressured and rushed. I understand they may have wanted us to get started in case we were to go over our allotted time, but I didn't like the vibe I was getting from our server. He didn't offer us water while we waited too, he just kept asking us if we wanted to order when we already told him we were going to wait. Funny thing is later on when the rest of our family came and we had our food on the table, he barely checked on us or asked to refill our tea. \n\nTHE FOOD:\nWe had the holiday tea set and if I remember correctly, that came with a pot of tea (can't remember what we chose off of the holiday menu, but I didn't like it because it was sour), three different sandwiches, scones, crumpet, some desserts, and little pigs in a blanket, quiche, and a weird sandwich with cream cheese and cucumbers. It also comes with 2 cups of hot cider and crackers (that contain a present, some jokes, and a paper crown). We also ordered more sandwiches and another pot of tea (strawberry fields). The only things I liked were the scones and the lemon spread that came with it. Strawberry fields was okay, it smelled great but the taste wasn't anything special. Besides that, the sandwiches weren't impressive, the quiche (if you can even call it that) didn't even have much filling and was super dry, and so were the pigs in a blanket. The crumpet was okay I guess. I've never had it before so I have nothing to compare it to. However, when I was going to the bathroom I'm pretty sure I saw an employee holding prepackaged bags of them. Meh.\n\nTHE OVERALL EXPERIENCE:\nMy initial experience with the person at the register and our server really set the tone for the rest of the time we were there. Another server did the cracker thing with us and that was nice. We sang and then ripped the crackers apart for our presents inside. I got a tiny picture frame for my present and it's cute. Besides that, like I said the food really isn't anything special and service is pretty meh. Also kinda weird that it's located on the first floor of some building and roped off. Pretty disappointing since it was my first time ever doing this sort of thing and it's outrageously expensive for what it is. The only reason why I'm not giving it one star is because the server who did the cracker thing with us seemed at least a bit enthusiastic about it and wished us well when we left, but too bad we won't be coming back.", "author": "C K."}

The finger sandwiches (cucumber, ham/cheese) were standard and I wish they had more of a unique taste. Aside from the tea, something memorable was when our waitress brought our food. She saw me reach for the macaron on the top tray and curtly stated that we're supposed to start from the bottom tray (finger sandwiches) and walked away. Well, maybe I choose desserts first because life is short? I found her comment unnecessary and of poor customer service. Their tableware was decorated with tea-related quotes and the setting is cute. However, the location lacked an intimate feel because it wasn't in an enclosed room. It was in a lobby-esque area of the ground floor that experiences moderate traffic of people passing by to go to other floors of the building for activities such as Room Escape or, the day I was there, for the screening of a Naruto movie.

I want to support this type of enterprise! \n\nWe arrived late on a Friday afternoon with a Groupon and no reservation. No problem - warm welcome and friendly staff.  Excellent service. They have an individual loose tea menu with a large and diverse range of offerings to tempt even the most discerning tea enthusiast. Each guest given their own large pot of tea which was great, because we would not have been able to agree which one to share. The food was delicious and lots of it. We left full. Particular favorites were the egg salad sandwich, crumpet and meringue. The chocolate covered strawberries were also a treat. \n\nI cannot wait for them to find a more permanent location to get their many British tea house treasures out of storage and share with customers again. Until then, Post Street is a good location - or join them at their special event High Teas at the Sir Francis Drake Hotel in downtown Union Square such as Christmas and Valentines Day. \n\nTip - underground city-parking garage directly across the street is much cheaper than street parking.", "author": "Angela L."}

The tea brews my worries away withing 2 sips.\nThe only drawbacks of this place is that the snacks are not as wow-ful. Many of the snack options are a little unconventional for tea.

(When we finally got there, it wasn't busy and the staff was lazy)\n-Slow service, we had reservations. They seated us....waited for like 15 minutes before someone came and asked us what we wanted. Took another 30 minutes to get us our teas and lunch platters. AND ANOTHER 30 to take our bill. Only checking on us once between these transactions.\n-We got the whole three tiers lunch platter, nothing on there was exceptional. The only decent thing was the scone. The sandwiches were gross. \"Tuna\" sandwich tasted too fishy and it was like it was from a can or something. The famous crumpet was too soaked in butter.\n-The place isn't cute. Plain and inside a hidden area with limited seats. Only fit like 20 people?\n-I asked one of the staff where the restroom was, she rolled her eyes and said, \"downstairs\". \n-Limited menu\n-Pricey\n\nSo to be fair, I think their teas are wonderful, but customer service, location, shop, and food are no good.

I've also been to LoveJoy's so I do have a point of comparison. The ordering was super easy, each of the 8 or so girls I went with ordered the \"Tea for one\" which was $24 for a pot of tea of your choice,  3 types of sandwiches, scones, crumpets, a salad and some mini desserts (i.e mini cheesecake, eclairs, mousses, etc). This made the usual payment process super easy, it came out to $31 per head ($24 for a tea for one + 8.75% tax +18% gratuity for parties of 6 or more).\n\nI actually really liked the simple, clean, modern decor unlike the overly girly (pink, very lacey) design of LoveJoy's. However this is purely just a preference thing, when you go to LoveJoy's I literally felt like I had to sit with upright posture, speak in an English accent, drink tea with my pinky finger up, and dress in a lacey dress to fit in with the rest of the lady customers. In contrast, Crown & Crumpets felt like a more relaxed atmosphere in a simple, clean, modern setting which I liked.\n\nI also loved the automatic toilets they had in the bathrooms downstairs! For anyone who has ever used one, knows that they are heated (not cold and uncomfortable!), washes you based on control buttons (no need for toilet paper how awesome!)\n\nThe reason why I give this place only 3 stars is that the food was fairly average - the sandwiches and scones weren't as high-quality, I definitely had better at LoveJoy's. The tea, however, was fine and they had a good variety to choose from. I went with the Chai which was delicious and a solid option.\n\nThe service at this place was great, initially they did not give us enough food portions for (all of us ordered the \"Tea for one\"). We initially brought it up to the waitress but she didn't seem to understand how many additional sets of food we needed, but once we got up to explain to who seemed to be the manager, she was extremely understanding and accommodating. She was super friendly and immediately brought out the additional sets of food we needed.\n\nOverall, this was a solid place and I loved stepping out to the heart of Japantown.

What a huge disappointment.  The only thing cute about Crown and Crumpet is the website. \n\n I have a tradition of taking my daughters to tea for Valentine's Day, and I was super excited to take them here.  Much to my disappointment, the location was in an oddly modern building and the tables were all squished on one side.  Meanwhile random people could just walk through to the place to get to the whack Harajuku stores upstairs.\n\nI mean, for the price I didn't even get a quaint room?  What a joke.

Everything was very elegant, the place is finely decorated to make it look like an authentic English tea cafe. The best part was the mini sandwiches that come with the Afternoon Tea- they were so soft and delicious!! The workers also are straight from Europe, most of them have accents! \n\nThe only drawback is that there was a piece of hair in one of the desserts they gave us.

We do appreciate feedback from our guests whether is is good or bad as it always helps us to be better at offering everyone the best Afternoon Tea Experience they can have. \nI am so sorry that you did not get to stay and have tea with us on the day you and your niece and her mom came to see us. It sounds like it must have been a weekend  and those are days we get super busy. We do mostly have reservations booked about ten to seven days in advance and it gets really tricky to seat people who walk in and did not have a chance to book or just want to be spontaneous and pop in for tea! I know how frustrating that can be and I am so sorry we couldn't seat you before 4:00 pm.\nWe are hopping you will give us another chance and come another time. Weekdays are generally not as crazy so if you have a chance to pop in on a day off you don't really need to book a table. If you want to come on a weekend try and ring us, even that morning, we may have availability or a cancellation and we can get you in.

The staff members were upbeat and greeted guests graciously and many snaps go to Micah--an entirely too-enchanting young lady--who did everything to make my friend and me welcome. \n\nI have lived in Japan, London, and Italy, and enjoyed the famous afternoon British \"real tea\" at The Savoy (be careful describing \"high tea\"--that's different animal altogether and not served here).  British tea service is a bit different and this is not that.  However, this San Francisco presentation is bright, completely fresh, appealing, tasty, and crisply presented.  Micah explained every offering on the three-tiered tea cart in detail and her knowledge of the many teas available was impressive.\n\nAs other Yelpers have described, this is a retreat from the bustle of the outside world and mother-daughter events are especially suited for this cheerful setting. There is a private room upstairs for special parties and in that room, there is a life-size \"cut-out\" of the \"it\" couple, William and Kate--perfect for photographs.\n\nI miss the Ghirardelli location that housed this business originally; but the owner had to move somewhere and here is just fine.  Don't miss the enormous, original \"Time for Tea\" clock that presides over the whole enterprise.\n\nA lovely respite from a busy shopping day and worth your time.", "author": "Elle W."}

Downstairs is even more casual. I wouldn't describe this as a place for an elegant tea party, but if you want something casual, laid back, and light-hearted this is the place. \n\nWe had our own \"trolley dolly\" who attended to us in this party. He was attentive indeed. He was attentive to the point where he would ask us if we wanted tea in the middle of our conversation. To be honest, he did a really good job in making sure we got what we wanted and my tea cup was never empty, but I am the type of person who prefers to have my cup silently filled so this is not my type of service. Overall, he was excellent.\n\nI really appreciated how they presented the tea trays so I knew exactly what I was eating. Everything (except the salad) was presented wonderfully. However... I think most of the pricing goes towards presentation, location, and the experience of afternoon tea. The sandwiches are okay. In my opinion they are a tad dry and I have had better tea sandwiches at my work. They aren't bad. The other offerings... I'm not sure if they make them in house or not. The quiche was ok (a little bit salty) but I loved that they came out warm. I'm not a fan of crumpets, so naturally this place didn't win me over with theirs. To credit, they were warm and toasted. Their desserts were good... I really loved the pear galette. \n\nWhat really stood out was the scone and the salad, for opposite reasons. The scone was spectacularly delicious and the salad was spectacularly dismal. Skip the salad, go for the scone. \n\nIn all, I paid $50 for this experience. I don't think I want to do it again. It was an incredible amount of food. I do want to try their \"tea for one\" though. \n\nOverall, a very cute place that's best suited for hanging out and getting something sweet with a pot of tea. \n\nI ended up with stomach problems after my visit, and I'm pretty sure it was because after two months of eating mainly salad at work, the rich food here upset my stomach.

I've loved the space, the afternoon tea, the trolly dollies, the owners, and appreciated all of the design they've infused into every card, menu, and tea cup. \n\nI am under the impression that there are plans are to open a larger space in the near future and this is a only satellite or pop-up. It's a Tea Stop, or a short stop - not a lounging place. That said, this location shouldn't have opened before the larger space because It really gives off such a different impression from the old one - it doesn't feel like you're getting the whole experience of a tea lounge. You cannot see the tea stop from the street at all, I almost missed it. The space is shared with a clothing store, so it doesn't have much of a commanding presence and signage is minimal. Like the space it resides in, the menu and tea selection is much smaller. \n\nThose not familiar with the old space or the big plans in the works (which I hope there are) will be dissatisfied by this location. They will, however, enjoy the food and the tea is quite nice. But the overall experience is lacking for serious tea time. \n\nThis is a location that I would come to when passing through the neighborhood. They need to incorporate signage here or on their website that there is more to come. There needs to be more communicated overall that they haven't become a smaller business. \n\nGiven the location, I think devising a menu that balances and complements both British goodies and Japantown sensibilities would help to make it fit in better.

Its sunny and comfortable. The level of noise is just right. \n\nThe only reason I didn't get them 5 stars is because of the service, which really isn't too bad.

Despite having reservations, they always seat us about 5 - 10 late (yes, I know, its only 5 - 10 minutes, but the problem is consistent). And the wait to place the initial order is also too long.

It was disappointing how the first 3 choices of tea was so popular that they ran out of it at around 12pm. They suppose to serve the afternoon tea till 5:15pm. We end up with \"Alice Drink Me Up Tea\" which was a strong black tea with little flavor. The second pot of tea we order \" Strawberry Fields\" . That's a green tea with a touch of Strawberry flavor which goes great with the tea set. The sandwiches was delightful and so was the warm savories. But the crumpet doesn't seem fresh because they put so much butter on it that it feels like were eating bread soaked in butter so I didn't even get to enjoy it that much with the wonderful spreads.

So unless you're really hungry and wanting to drop $50 on tea for two, one will do or a side pot of tea in another flavor for $5.  The staff was nice and explained things well.   It did get a little rushed though toward the middle.  They took our tiered platters away when we had only cleared the bottom one and crowded the table with the rest of the plates.  They steeped the tea we had left over and put it in to go cups for us so we did feel like we got our money's worth.  A fun experience and glad hubby humored me for the experience.", "author": "A.

My sister and I come back as often as we can because it is our favorite place to go get tea, especially for me because I am gluten free and they have delicious gluten free options or a gluten free tea for one, which comes with little sweets, little sandwiches, and a pot of tea that they refill for you, unsure how many times I've only ever gotten one refill the pots of tea are pretty big for one. My two favorite teas are the \"Alice Drink Me Tea\" because it has amazing champagne flavor and a perfect amount of caffeine and the \"Stardust\" which sparkles when you pour it and is also a flavored tea with a vanilla-y flavor. Love this place can't wait to come back !", "author": "Bianca A."}

It's a special outing that my daughter and I always enjoy together.  However,  I was super disappointed on our visit this weekend to be charged the Adult price for tea for my 9 year old daughter.  I ordered \"tea for two\" assuming that the waiter could physically SEE that my daughter was a child, yet when the check arrived I was charged the adult price for her ($28).  When I inquired he stated that I ordered tea for two and didn't specify that I wanted a child's tea.  No offer was made by the waiter to fix this.  I let the host know on the way out, and though he was sympathetic I got the same argument - that unless one specifies a child's tea, it's assumed they want an adult portion.  After a fair bit of arguing back and forth (which sort of ruins a nice afternoon tea, no?) he offered to give me a credit (which was declined because we were now late for our movie and I didn't want to spend an extra 15 minutes).  I don't think it should have been an issue in the first place and will definitely make me think twice before coming back.  \n\nMy second issue is that it's always very HOT inside.  Turn down the heat!!  \n\nThose issue aside, the food is decent and the tea is good.  It's a very cute shop, but oddly located.  I preferred the Ghirardelli location.", "author": "Rebecca W."}

My reservation for 1 was at 3pm, so I was glad that I was able to seat early due to the rain.  I was seated right away.  I got my order in about 5 minutes.  It was nice that she brought me magazines to read.  The tea, however, was lukewarm.  Not searing hot as it should have been.  The scones, salad, and tea sandwiches were okay.  I was disappointed that they did not have clotted cream for the scones, but whip cream, which I thought was odd.  Also they did not have cubed sugar.  The bill came out to a whopping $38 plus tip for 1 person.  I thought that was highly priced for 1 person.  I've been to other tea rooms and it was close to $30 and the food was a lot better.  Got ready to leave, and my umbrella was stolen.  Unfortunately I had to walk out in the pouring rain.", "author": "Henny V."}

If you're reading this on February 13-15, call ahead as they have a very special tea service for Valentine's weekend--DO call as you will enjoy it whether you're a tea place person or not.  I was blown away by the deliciousness of the food and special Valentine's tea blends, complimentary mocktails and cocktails, best-ever biscuits, fresh crumpets, sausage in a blanket and quiche savory delights, sweet heart shaped open faced finger sandwiches (which I was certain would not taste as good as they looked, but no, as ever, their ingredients and creativity rocked my taste buds).

I have to go down to 3 stars because the \"afternoon tea\" service for $28 is really too stingy for that price. It comes with ONE scone and tiny bites of various other sweets. For $28 you should at least be able to share \"tea for two\" without splitting one scone. The service is usually fine, but can be lacking - such as yesterday when I arrived with two friends and we were told to wait 15 minutes even though we had made a reservation. What's the point of a reservation system if you require that long of a wait? The server who is usually there is nice. They seem to get overwhelmed on weekends when it's crowded.

I made a reservation well in advance and asked about a gluten free, dairy free option for one member of our party. I was assured this was available, and I spoke with them by phone the day before to confirm the reservation and the special arrangement for one person. When we arrived they had our reservation, and knew we were the party who asked for gluten/dairy free. My aunt was served a handful of lettuce with a small scoop of egg salad on top. They had run out of gluten free bread, and scones, even though we'd arranged for it in advance. There was nothing else for them to give her except a pot of tea. They couldn't arrange anything else, perhaps involving the salmon, or cucumbers, or strawberries, etc.\nIt was shocking to be charged $85 for this. \nThe rest of us had a very nice array of food, with yummy desserts, lovely presentation, and attentive service. Worth $85? Nah, but it was a special present.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-21", "description": "My bff and I have fallen off of our monthly tea outings, mostly just because we are both super busy and because we ran out of new places to try in the Sacramento area. Last year I found out about Crown & Crumpet right before they closed their Ghriradelli Square location, so we were eagerly awaiting  the opening of their new store. Well, the new store has taken longer than they expected so they opened up this much smaller tea stop cafe in Japantown in the meantime. There are probably eight tables and it is essentially in the lobby of the New People building which houses several clothing and art stores. Lots of people walk though Crown and Crumpet to get to other parts of the building. It's not ideal, but it works as a smaller version of their flagship shop, which hopefully will open soon, I believe in Union Square. One nice upgrade to this location is that the bathroom is just downstairs, rather than on the other side of the shopping center like it was in the previous location. Because it is in a Japanese building they have the fancy toliets with heated seats and lots of buttons to play with, it was good for freaking the teenager out. \n\nMy friend and I, along with her teenage daughter, came here on a Sunday afternoon and while reservations are required to sit and have tea, they accomodated the fact that we arrived a half hour early. You can walk in and order tea or treats to-go, as well. They sat us in a cute booth, with all of their mismatched floral table cloths and cute teacups and saucers with sayings on them. The building itself is fairly modern and sleek, so it is an interesting juxtaposition with the large teacup clock on the wall. We ordered afternoon tea for all three of us, which comes with a large pot of tea apiece, although my friend's daughter does not like tea so they allowed us to substitue hot chocolate, which came with multicolored marshmallows. I got the Paris tea, which has little silver dragees in it and was pretty good, my friend got the Crown & Crumpet specialty blend, which she let me try and it was our favorite. \n\nOur three tier stand of food included a crumpet (naturally), scone (with all the appropriate accompaniments - clotted cream, lemon curd and strawberry jam), three tea sandwiches, a mini-pizza quiche, a mac and cheese bite and four mini desserts, which were a cream puff, a strawberrry cream mousse, apricot bars and a blueberry cheesecake bite. They accomodated my friend who has a nut allergy well and because they could not be sure if the granola on the apricot bar had any nuts in it, brought her a chocolate dipped strawberry to compensate. I thought all of the food was decent, if not stand out great. I liked all of the savories and loved the addition of the crumpet, which I have not had in a long time and my friend and her daughter had never had before. By the time I got through both of those tiers, I was stuffed, so I was not too dissapointed that I didn't really have room for dessert. I am not a big fruit dessert person, so I only ate the cream puff, which I actually found to be too sweet, and took the leftovers home to my husband and sons. \n\nTo be perfectly honest, I was a tiny bit letdown from what I had originally heard about Crown & Crumpet, but I expected that from the other reviews. I would probably not go out of my way to come to this location again, but we will definitely give the flagship store a try once it opens. I would, however, definitely stop in if I were in the area and grab a cup of the Crown & Crumpet specialty tea or if we had plans nearby might have a full tea again.", "author": "Lisa H."}

I am a HUGE fan of Lovejoy but it was booked so I looked for an alternative. This place had over all good reviews but I wished I had read them more carefully. For starters, C&C is in fact in a lobby of a building which takes away the potential charm. There was a line just outside the seating area for a film festival which again, killed the ambiance. It was incredibly hot and indeed not climate controlled. \n\nUpon arrival with 4 eager children (for a party), we were sat at our table 30-45 minutes behind schedule. When we were finally given our spot, it was not well cleaned. The menu was not all available as they were out of items and the server, who was also the owner, offered to substitute in whatever we needed to keep the kids happy. Little did I know they were charging for all the changes. She had offered it to us! \n\nThe food was OK at best. The scones were flat and there was no lemon curd, only jam. The kids sandwiches were pretty good but the bread seemed a tad old. I had a salad which was teeny and seriously NOT worth the $10-12 I paid for it.

I'd been a little concerned since it was middle event that it would be really crowded and loud (though filled with kimono's, cosplayers and lolis), as I've seen previously.  It was actually still peaceful. I think that's because many (including myself, until the gluten restriction) love the festival street food.  Also, while it fits in great with certain Japanese themes, it isn't Japanese food.\nOur party consisted of meat and potatoes, vegetarian and gluten free (no pork) and they definitely accommodated all. If you don't want sashimi or some deserts and you need a gluten free meal, you generally end up on the edges of japantown, particularly Fillmore, rather than in it, so this was an obvious \"brunch\" choice.\nThe water is some of the coldest water without ice in it, I've had the pleasure of.  The macarons are smaller than average (and gluten free), but I liked it.  I could take bites or pop the whole in my mouth.  The green tea ganache really packed a punch and was my favorite of the lemon, red current and green tea.  \n\nThe gluten free scone (with berries) might have been crumbly, but it was really good.  So was the cream and strawberry jam and the lemony stuff.\n\nThe salad was good, not too much dressing, plenty of the avocado, sunflower seeds, etc.\n\nService was attentive and helpful and our server's were sweet and had cool hair and accessories.\nI got green tea strawberry fields tea, it was nice.  Since I didn't get extra water (offered) it did get a little bitter towards the end, but there is more than enough sugar.  I really like it when after drinking tea, you are kind of left with that velvety lingering flavor mouth feel.\nMy sister was disappointed to discover the sugar was loose, instead of cubes, but only because she likes to just eat sugar cubes.  She really liked her Murky waters iced.\nOur friend said the espresso was good.  Both guests enjoyed their sandwiches, which looked great.  I don't normally think filling when it comes to tea, but that's exactly what we got and needed this day.\nOverall it was a hit and I definitely appreciate having the option right in the middle of things.\nThis is easily a $12-25 per person place.\n\nI understand, you are in a modern open, everyday lobby space, not being whisked away to Wonderland (The people in their private tea room up stairs, were having a loud crowded happy gathering).  If you're not going to take advantage of Japantown and want fancy tea party, then maybe better off at Ghiradelli location for a special party.  For a little slow down indulgence, a Japanese themed party (lolita, follow up with pikapika & karoake, etc.), this location is quite accessible.   Seeing it, rather than it hiding in some corner, is bound to bring more business to keep it alive.", "author": "Denae W."}

The real Crown and Crumpets will open at the end of the year at a separate location but for now they have this mini coffee bar with some tables and decorations on the side. I was disappointed by the initial service. I took my mom here for the friday before Mothers Day and the lady working didn't greet us nor tell us whether to wait to be seated or to seat ourselves. After 5 minutes I sat and she asked if I had a reservation (yes) and then asked me to wait. Rude because there was only one table with two people that she was talking to and nobody else was there so it wasn't like she was too busy to welcome us. Then a couple of people came in and walked up to the cafe bar. The lady finishes servicing the table then proceeds to take the orders of the people at the bar. Huh?? Finally the washboy seats us at our reserved table. I showed the oblivious worker lady my Gilt city purchase and she served us the infamous tier I've learned to love. The scones were good, the sandwiches were good and the desserts were bad. Just tasteless and unimpressive. I was grateful that an alternative waitress came in and finished up our order because she was delightful. She explained why this crown and crumpets wasn't as \"cute\" or \"nice\" as the original location. (It's just a place holder for now) Overall it was an ok experience but I wouldn't return to this spot and I'd recommend that you wait until the real deal opens up at the end of the year. Hopefully our initial waitress won't be there...", "author": "Kristy F."}

I had heard about this place, but didn't really know too  much about it.  Anyway, they are in this open atrium place, which seems a little odd for a place for high tea, but don't let that disappoint you.  We were served by two lovely servers who were not only very attentive,but very good conversationalists.  The tea selection is quite large, and their choices we tried were excellent.  My youngest daughter tried their Snow White tea which was fruity, and was so good that we bought some to bring back home.   I had the more traditional Earl Grey which was wonderful.  DO NOT EAT`before coming here.  They provide you with a three tier stand filled with fantastic sandwiches (roast beef, chicken curry salad and egg salad) as well as the most flaky and delicious scones we have ever had,  Usually, I find scones a little on the dry side, but these were so good.  The crumpets were also wonderful, with the bottom so crisp and the nooks and crannies on the top, soaking in the butter  and jams.  Finally, the top layer had a sweets which was truly the topping to a wonderful experience.   Chocolate covered strawberries, apricot crumb.  So much food, so little space! By the way,if you are a male,  like me, you're definitely outnumbered, but everyone should try this place.  A little more casual than the average place for high tea,  but not to be missed.

Anyways, we were a little late for our reservation, but we managed to still get a table. We had the basic afternoon tea with scones, sandwiches, and other pastries. We also had the Strawberry Fields tea. The tea was really good and refreshing, perfect for a windy cold day in SF. The pastries were also really good. I especially liked the scones.

Have visited this tea room & shop for years in the previous location & have always loved the experience.  On this trip to San Francisco I made the treck to the new location in Japantown.  I would change the name of the business because this was NOT the Crown & Crumpet I knew.  Here are a few reasons why I will sadly never be back:\n1. Parking SUCKS.  Nothing on the street within a mile.  Parked in a shopping center across the street & had to get through Japantown to arrive at a British tea room.  Very weird.\n2. There is NOT a gift shop anymore.  Their website states the shop is located on the 2nd floor, but this is a lie!  I asked where the shop was & was told they don't have a shop anymore.  Then take it off your website!!!\n3. Atmosphere used to be adorable & relaxing.  I would compare the new location to a Starbucks.  There is none of the girly tea room personality that it used to have.  It felt like you were in a large hallway instead of a tearoom.\n4. If I am at a Starbucks I will NOT be paying tea room prices!\n5. Location.  British tea room in Japantown.  WTF!

I unfortunately never made it to their old location which seemed the definition of girly tea time. I patiently waited months for this new location to open thinking it would be the same just in a different location but my expectation were evidently set too high! From pictures on yelp of their old location, it seemed that Crown and Crumpet would be an experience akin to being transported back in time and reliving a childhood fantasy of a shiny, sparkling, tea time, pink galore, with life-sized tea sets, and extra yummy foods. This was sadly not the case. While the food was excellent and the service was good, the location was definitely lacking. The ambiance of this place was very modern, almost futurey with a small twist of girly-ness which only came about because of the floral table cloths. The location/set up of the place also seemed a little weird. I read on another yelp review that the tea place is actually set up in the lobby of a building. I guess in retrospect I can see that now... at the time though I just didn't know what was going on. We walked in just in time for our reservation and waited by the sign that said open not sure what the big crowd of people in the middle of the room by the stairs were doing. Where they waiting to be seated or just hanging out? After a little bit we just walked in all the way and went up to the register. They seemed really understaffed that day. We were finally seated and it turned out the big group was there for something else maybe. It seemed the tea place actually just took up a small portion of this ground floor area. Upstairs it looked like it must have been a completely different store/business that was selling Japanese Lolita style girl's clothing and accessories and something else all together was going on downstairs, bathrooms and I don't know what else. We ordered two afternoon teas, one for each of us. The sandwiches were good. the afternoon tea also came with salad but no savories. There was also a crumpet and a lemon scone each, both were good sized portions. The scones and crumpet were served with a small portion of jam and cream, no lemon curd. This portion was a little small. I felt like I had to really ration what we had and only spread on half my crumpets and scones. The service was pretty nice though and I'm thinking they probably would have given us more of the jam and cream if we asked. The whole tea service was topped with very tasty abundant sweets which was some of the tastiest, freshest tasting sweets I've had at tea time. The little cheesecake bites were amazing, fluffy without being whipped with a pop of fresh tasting fruit swirl. Overall the food was great. \n\nI really wanted to love this place but it just wasn't what I expected. Maybe 3 stars is too harsh though and my initial expectations were just set too high.

We enjoyed a special holiday tea at the Sir Francis Drake hosted by Crown & Crumpet. It was a stunning setting at this historic hotel which was beautifully decorated for the holidays. The tea room had soaring ceilings and beautiful architectural details. There was a lovely overlook to the grand lobby. We were impressed that the owners, Amy and Chris, carted their beautiful quintessential English table clothes, tiered trays, teapots, tea cups and vintage silverware to set up the festive tea in authentic C&C style. As always, the tea selection was exceptional and the tiered trays of sandwiches and sweets were divine. Amy even came around to personally deliver their signature party favors and a special C&C ornament which we will treasure. Amy gave us party crackers and instructed us to cross hands sharing the poppers, sing a Christmas song and pop simultaneously. It was great fun and a memorable holiday experience. It was worth the high price for this event (which included a charitable donation).

Everything is more or less pre-fixed (maybe Lovey's Tea Shoppe spoiled me) - we couldn't choose what sweets, savories, or sandwiches we got. Which is really upsetting because the sweets we got were untouched (looked grossly sweet and clearly a waste of calories if consumed) and I could have really passed on white bread with cream cheese (really?). The worst part was that all the sandwiches had stale edges which meant these guys were sitting out, pre-sliced, for who knows how long. Thought your customers wouldn't be able to tell, huh? The icing to the cake was that they charge a sharing fee. If you order off the a-la carte menu, that fee is waived. But still, the options are already slim to begin with.

She gave great tea recommendations for the guests less hardcore about their tea than I am, and got so excited about the elaborate scheme to surprise our birthday boy, walking me through all the usual set-up of the party to help figure out the best way to spring it.\n    The day of the party turned out to also be the St. Patrick's Day Parade, so the last guest (our decoy birthday girl, so we couldn't really start until she got there) didn't even make it until half our time was up, but Amy was so great about checking in on everyone while they waited, keeping them entertained and well-teaed while I was running around Japantown gathering incoming guests every fifteen minutes.  She even managed to trick the birthday boy into sitting in the seat of honor without tipping him off, and even with only an hour left never made us feel rushed even though she had two more parties after us.  \n\nTea and food: We had the Paris blend (a suggestion of Amy's that got a lot of happy comments), Calcutta Assam, genmaicha, Star of Africa and Keep Calm and Carry On, all of which were delicious.  No saucers or anything that I noticed to put the teaballs on, so the teas were a bit oversteeped by the end.  On the food side, I loved the tiny quiches and scones in particular, but the selections were such that everyone found plenty to nibble on and even with six or seven hungry boys we didn't come close to finishing it all.\n\nThe venue:  The private party room is ridiculously frilly and so perfect for a silly fun tea party.  We had 13 people at the party and everyone could mill around comfortably, but I think many more would be a squeeze unless people stayed mostly seated.  From what I saw of the lobby/public seating it is definitely a bit of an odd place for a cozy afternoon tea (I'm guessing that's not their fault and the best they could find; I don't know the story behind their relocation), but the private room is fantastic.\n\nIf you ever want to have a delicious, frilly tea party and the most helpful hostess ever, this is a top-notch place to go.", "author": "Hadidjah C."}

However recently I went with a friend of mine, her two kids and my daughter and felt disappointed with their new menu. We ordered what I thought was \"tea for two\", which now is tea for one and is very expensive and also a kids afternoon tea. I felt nickeled and dimed after they had to charge us a split plate fee if my friend and I shared the platter and they also pushed for each child to get their own platter because the food was enough for only one child. We had to ask about this because we were confused as to why this happened since I had been there a couple of months prior and this was not the case. Well as the owner explained it, because they have large groups coming and buying only a few platters and splitting them, then they were not making money off of them. Well Ok, I can see that, but there were only two adults not a party of 12 sharing a platter. Anyway, I was disappointed by this and felt like they could do something differently in order to not put all their cost on their smaller party customers. I am not sure if I will go back.
