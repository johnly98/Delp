I ordered the turkey burger quesadilla (yes this is an actual thing), as I didn't want a traditional burger. The quesadilla came with two huge turkey burger patties, sandwiched between a cheese filled tortilla. I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty this quesaburger was, as I had never had anything like it before. After a few bites, I was stuffed! The portion was huge. If you are in the area, and have a big appetite, I would say this would be the perfect spot for you. There is ample seating, and they seem to be pretty quick with service. As I came around 3 pm on a Saturday, there wasn't a wait; I'm sure this place fills up pretty quickly during peak hours. They also have quite a large menu; they serve salads, hot wings, pizza, burgers, and so much more! Check this place out, if in the area.", "author": "Alexus S."}

The atmosphere is generic but clean and I don't have anything to complain about service-wise. \n\nThe meal prices are horrendous unless you're there during happy hour (5:30-9:30, I think). I couldn't decide on a veggie burger to split with my friend so opted for a side of fries to hold me over until dinner. They were about $6 and a hefty portion for the price. \n\nOne of my friends got a veggie sandwich with sweet potato fries for ~$15 and my other friend got a 10\" pizza for ~$17. With a name like Burger Urge I expected the sandwiches and fries to be the highlight but surprisingly the pizza was everyone's favorite. The crust was uninspiring but crispy while the sauce was decent and the pineapple was grilled -- a nice touch. \n\nThe veggie sandwich was dry and the sweet potato fries were nowhere near crispy enough. Pretty common occurrence with sweets but again, the place is supposed to be all about burgers and in turn, fries! \n\nMy regular fries were crispy albeit a bit bland and got soggy quickly. \n\nThis is an ok stop for a desperate bite or if you're fine with paying big for something not exactly worth it.

But usualy I just pass because I don't want a soy burger.  I don't miss meat perse but I miss the texture of meat at times.\n\nWe were hungry after a day of hiking the redwoods.  Bunny needed a nap. I stayed up because I thought if I went to sleep I would not get up until 3am and then be hungry and not be able to go back to sleep.  So I stayed up.  I gave him 30 mins to nap then we got up and went out for dinner.\n\nWe were not feeling like walking to far or taking Uber anywhere and spotted this place at the corner as we were walking.  I wasn't sure they would have anything for me to eat since this is a BURGER JOINT so I figured I would get fries, onion rings, maybe a salad of something.  I wasn't trying to be picky I was just hungry. This place is located in the Haight Ashbury area so there is plenty to see and do.\n\nWe walk in and are greeted right away.  We peruse the menu to see what they had and I decided to ask about veggie burgers thinking they wouldn't have anything but I was WRONG and they did have veggie patty's.  YEAHHH!\n\nThe young lady told me I could get any burger I wanted and swap the patty for a veggie one, or turkey if you like those instead.  SO MANY CHOICES I had.  I normally ask what type of veggie patty it is but I wasn't caring at this point.\n\nI ended up getting the DOWN N DIRTY veggie style which was cheddar cheese, BBQ Sauce, onion rings on griddled rye bread but I swapped that out for a wheat bun.  Bunny got the basic CHEESE BURGER which was a meat patty with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle.  I asked if they had fruit instead of fries but NOPE so we didn't get any fires either.  Bunny got a chocolate shake and I got a diet soda.  What a treat I almost NEVER get soda anymore.\n\nWe paid and got a number and went to find a seat.  The restaurant was decorated in a rock style with murals all over of San Francisco and different musicians.  The ENTIRE ceiling had old guitars painted and adhered to it.  VERY COOL!  There was even a couple that were like 3D images which laid over the painted ones in the murals.  They also had 2-3 TV's up and on.  One was on the Worlds Series but both teams had 0 at the time and while I USED to like watching baseball it is painful now and feels like I'm watching grass grow because it moves slow.\n\nOur food soon arrived with a loaf of bread on each burger.  Yes I'm being facetious but the bun was SO FRICKIN thick I took off the top.  Their buns are VERY THICK and not on the SUPER SOFT side like brioche buns at all.  JUST THICK!  \n\nWe could hardly pick it up to eat it so we dug in with a knife and fork.  I liked my veggie burger. It was a little different and I could see it had some carrots or sweet potato in it which was good.  Very filling. Bunny liked his burger as well and we both were happy we didn't get fries or fruit.  The burgers were more than enough with something to wash them down with.\n\nThe staff was super friendly and nice and didn't look like slobs. The restaurant was clean and had a steady flow of eaters all night but they were able to keep all the condiments stocked and everything clean.  I appreciate that.", "author": "Ryan P."}

It was cooked til you couldn't squeeze an ounce of juice from it. And the outside was burnt and charred as black as you can. The only reason I made it to this place was the happy hour deal labeled outside on the window. The next part of it was the garlic fries. There was NO garlic on the fries whatsoever. It felt like they just drizzled some garlic flavored oil over it, creating your Burger Urge poor man's garlic fries. \n\nAlso, there is no beer on tap here. Everything served in a bottle. \n\nIf you're able to pick between this place and ANY other place in SF.

My daughter, friend and I ordered 3 burgers, 2 sides of different fries, 3 sodas, 1 water, and 1 milkshake.  The lady rang it up - $68.72!! I'm like WHAT??  She said \"do you want a receipt?\" (had only given me the credit card receipt - not the detailed receipt) I said \"Yes\" - and I noticed she added $8.74 service charge! I read the blurb below on the receipt and assumed it was a San Francisco city ordinance, so let it go considering we were starved.  But when I got home I saw that I could have asked for that to be removed! (see photo of receipt). And they charged $7 for the milkshake! Which they took forever to make - by the time it arrived - we were about done.  The burgers were really thin and super high-fat and greasy - my daughter's friend got a bad tummy ache soon after which ruined the rest of her afternoon.  So on top of it she got food poisoning!! I nor my daughter didn't get sick but I was burping mine up for hours afterward.  I highly doubt they were \"Neiman Ranch\" as advertised.  The sweet potato fries were dry and without the chili pepper seasoning on top as listed on menu.  This place is the BIGGEST ripoff and food is SUB-PAR and RISKY!!

They always had a clean larger bathroom, and drinks to pack away for long shopping trips.\n\nBut this last experience was so not good. I ordered a burger, simple - but in watching her ring up the meal I was charged a 12% gratuity fee. I didn't think about it until I was waiting for my food and had used the extremely dirty restroom. I mean, many SF (and now SB!) spaces have a surcharge for employee insurance so at first glance that's what I thought it was - except at 12% that doesn't really make sense.\n\nAdding to the fact there is a \"tip section\" on the receipt I signed, this leads me to believe Burger Urge is not an automatic/non-tipping establishment and that the cashier charged me (1 person, 1 burger) like I was a party of 5 or 6. Then conveniently did not give me a copy of the receipt afterwards.\n\nIt's a nice scam they have going - which lead me to pay $15 for a super thin pattied burger and a bottle of water.

Of course, since the charge is added indiscriminately to every purchase, it's not a service charge; it's just part of the price. The (already high) prices listed on the menu are there to fool you. You are then handed a non-itemized receipt, with no mention of the charge, encouraging you to add a tip. If you hadn't noticed the fine print on the menu where the charge is mentioned, you might be inclined to leave a tip if you are a good person. But you're being swindled.

I wasn't sure what to do for dinner, but  was walking down Haight street (I try to avoid driving to Haight, I don't like having to deal with the parking), and had a vague idea that a burger would be good. I took a look on yelp and Burger Urge seemed like it would be reasonably priced, even thought it didn't have the best reviews.\n\nI walked in and liked the ambience. TV on the Radio was playing, which put me in a good mood. The rest of the music was a mix of more mainstream, and a little of lesser known artists, mainly rock and pop. The restaurant was about a quarter full, and pretty quiet. There was a fire place, which was a little surprising given that this is a burger place, but it was a nice touch. The waitress at the register was friendly and attentive. I ordered the cheeseburger and regular fries (fries aren't included). It was just under $16, which was more than I had expected, but not a huge deal. \n\nAfter a 5-10 min wait the waitress bought my food out. There were a loooot of fries, it was a huge serving. The burger looked pretty good too, except for the beef, which was sort of shiny (with grease). I was excited about the grilled pickles. The burger was sort of difficult to eat, if that makes sense. Maybe it had something to do with the size, but it kept falling apart. And the beef ended up dripping a good bit and making the bun wet, and I had to keep stopping to wipe things up. It also seemed a little rubbery. The taste was just kind of bland, it just lacked a whole lot of flavor. Even the pickles that I'd been so excited about didn't have much flavor. The fries were better, about average. Nice and crispy and actually tasted like potato. A little less salt than I like, but a table full of condiments was available. \n\nEven though the food wasn't all that good, I ended up eating most of it. I think that's because I was hoping it would somehow get better, and trying to get my money's worth. It never happened and I finally gave up. Maybe I was wrong to come for the food, maybe people come here more for the ambience or after drinking. Based on the food, I don't see myself coming back.", "author": "Dana C."}

My burger had no flavor, it was very basic. And the French fry serving was way to much , I don't need a mountain of fries not trying to get fat here. My friend that was with me was vet disappointed even more so and her sati which was fucking shit. Plus it gave me bad diarrhea, and good burgers don't do that to me. I don't suggest this spot and it's a little pricey, and not worth the price. I feel like I paid and extra 10$ than what the food is really worth.

Really really filling burger on sourdough with grilled onions and mushrooms.  A little ranch on the side and I was set.  We added an order of sweet potato fries which was HUGE.  Plenty of food, and reasonably priced for what you get.  \n\nA nice thing about this spot too is that it's really large and spacious inside.

Now there is a place where everybody can - and definitely will - satisfy their burger urges, yearnings, and wild desires. No compromise, Burger Urge has something for everybody - juicy meaty options (pretty much everything on the Signature Urge list, Pineapple being our favorite), classic options (BLTA, Chicken Club sandwiches, Classic burger), something for staunch vegans - Portobello Mushrooms are strongly recommended);  something for your skinny ever - dieting friend (yes, the one you hate) - tons of salads, hummus sandwich, pretty much everything, if you skip the bun (and it's not going to be wasted, bread is good here, your friends will happily devour it :)\n\nSavvy options are there, too - soup and salad combo is good example.\nSpecial kids menu is not even necessary (though pretty ample), since even picky little eaters can find something yummy - Classic Grilled Cheese sandwich makes everybody happy. We personally didn't dare to try the Elvis (banana and bacon) but hey, who knows? As they say in German, there is a lid for every pot, someone might be brave enough and enjoy it :) \nSkip the Vegge-tastic salad, though - with so many thrilling options, this is something you can replicate at home, but by all means, try the Garlic Fries - they just hit the spot! The pleasure spot, that is - not too crunchy, not too mushy, not too overwhelming garlicky, just pure indulgence.\nPrices are reasonable, portions are big enough to stuff a hungry (old) hippie and to share some with friends, too :) \nRecommend to a friend? You bet! To all of them! \nComing back? For sure, lots of things are still there to try.", "author": "Chris V."}

It was cooked as we asked it to be and the whole thing was good, albeit a little on the salty side.  What gets us is that for a $14 burger it didn't come with anything.

With the recent cold and windy weather, \"heck yeah\" I quickly snag that table near the fireplace after I placed my order. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/goW9LHk_2ozTNypmq2pO8g?select=R1wv7c59FBWZ81VQBf_xyQ\n\nI ordered the \"Down and Dirty\" burger. For $8.99, the sandwich had a third of a ground beef patty, melted cheddar cheese, BBQ sauce and onion ring in a toasted bun. There are no combo packages here. So for another $3.99, I got a side of Onion rings and a $5.00 bottle of Sierra Nevada Pale ale. This is a very solid burger, especially for the area that lacks any decent burger places.  The onion rings are good. But I wish I got more, which is always the case. There is not much of a beer selection. At least they have my Sierra Nevada Pale ale.

I had onion rings and the San Francisco Original burger which consisted of sauteed onions, mushrooms, Swiss and cheddar cheese and steak sauce on sourdough bread.

However, since it was right next door, we decided to just walk over ourselves and order it (cash only if you order at Hobson's and they also charge an extra $4-$5 per burger).\n\nAll of us got the Love and Haight (love the name!) and it was so yummy. Came with sprouts (very unique) and avocados (my favorite). My boyfriend and I were able to share a burger 'cause it was just that big!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-07-31", "description": "Burger Urge is doing what no other restaurant has the courtesy to do: prove they care about customer experience by doing construction work in the restaurant during the lunch rush, not to mention having the two guys working on it argue loudly with each other about how it should be done to maximize customer experience. \n\nWe walked into Burger Urge at about 12:15pm on a weekday, when every restaurant SHOULD be doing construction, and found that the place where we were to place our order was blocked by a ladder with a man on it using power tools - just like you'd want for your dining experience. Then, after shouting our order over the sounds of the power drill, I was also lucky enough to then get to repeatedly say \"excuse me\" to another employee who was standing in front of the water cooler arguing with somebody into his phone, just to get some water. Finally - a restaurant that understands that what the customer wants is to be treated like an inconsequential, meaningless annoyance by the people taking their money!\n\nThen we sat down and waited. We had ordered our burgers medium rare, but luckily Burger Urge knows that the BEST way to get a burger is medium-well, so they took their sweet time and overcooked the burgers for us. Then they brought them out and we had to remind them that we had also ordered fries. But hey - they're busy doing construction, who has time to remember who ordered fries? \n\nThe overall experience was also helped by the nonstop power-drilling and arguing that went on through our entire visit. It was much nicer than listening to some boring muzak over the stereo or even the inane chatter of the people we choose to spend our time with and really made for a relaxing, fun lunch. \n\nAnd then the price - about $25 for two regular burgers and an order of fries (that we almost didn't get). What a bargain! I would expect they would start charging more in order to pay the never-ending construction laborers. \n\nSo if you enjoy being treated like garbage, disregarded as a human being and customer and you couldn't care less about flavor, try Burger Urge! Yum-yum! *DRILL SOUNDS* *DRILL SOUNDS* *DRILL SOUNDS*", "author": "Drew H."}

Great bun but a horrible combination with the layer of cool cheese between the hot bun and the hot fried veggie burger crust. So yeah that gets us to describing the patty itself which boasts a hot fried crust giving it an exterior texture similar to the chicken patty things you used to find in the grade school cafeteria but with a ground combination of veggies on the inside that barely has any flavor. \n\nAnywhere on Haight street is better for a veggie patty... \n\nSide note- they make their milkshakes with Mitchell's ice cream which is a plus but even if you eat in they don't offer or ask if you'd like it with whip cream and it comes in a medium sized plastic cup for basically 6 bucks. Mitchell's = SF joy but the rest just makes me neutral on the shakes.

Even with the ugly color, it's a nice addition to the neighborhood.  Any use of the word \"urge\" on a sign is a plus. \n\nI asked for well-done but it came out medium-rare. Pink hamburgers make me squeamish. Overall impression: It tasted really good. The condiments were good and the bun was great!  They've been open only a week so they're probably still working out the kinks on the grill line, so I'll give them a couple weeks. Three stars.\n\nMinus one star for onion ring situation. I asked for onion rings on the side. They charged me four bucks for an order of onion rings, but there were only nine in the box (see my photo).  Nine rings is just fine for a side order, but a side order should cost two bucks, not four. I expect to pay four bucks for a full order, but a full order should be a whole crap load more than nine rings.", "author": "Tim W."}

We went inside and I totally understand that restrooms are for customers only, so even though I didn't really want anything, we were all going to order beers so there aren't just 6 people coming in, using the restroom and leaving.  It would also be a nice time for us to grab a quick beer.\n\nI asked for the bathroom key while the other people I was with were waiting in line.  The lady behind the desk smugly gave me the key.  I used the bathroom and on the way out I her my friends talking to someone over the counter saying we aren't supposed to use the bathroom before ordering, even though we were telling them that we were in line.  It was very rude to me how they were talking.\n\nBut whatever, we got to the front of the line and ordered 6 beers, 1 for everyone, and also by doing so thought we more than \"bought our right\" to use the bathroom.  Nope, I couldn't hear what the lady at the counter said but basically they can serve us just beers, we had to buy something else as well, like some fries. Needless to say we all just walked out... think someone was still convinced to buy a can of orange juice or something...\n\nSo basically, we can't use the bathroom without ordering.  We have to order first before using the bathroom.  We can't just order beers, we have to order food. I feel like the only way they can sell food is to swindle people into buying something...  It was pretty ridiculous, as we were about to spend over $30 (just to use the bathroom really) and that still wasn't enough.  They even seemed pissed off about the entire thing... just a smile would have changed the entire situation and would have warranted at least 2 or 3 stars since I hate giving out 1 star to a business. \n\nLike I said, I understand the rules of the bathroom.  It sucks, but I get why the establishment does it.  This, however, was completed stupid and made me give this place 1 star without even having it.

It's like meat-loving America teamed up with some would-be fast food mentality to make a big, overpriced letdown of a burger joint.\n\nThe decor is whatever, license plates and TVs and some pop art. That's cool, that's fine. The cashiers and servers are nice and friendly. It would be an added bonus if you could get a burger and fries for less than eleven bucks, let alone a standalone burger (no, burgers do not come with fries), but that's fine too.\n\nAnd they mayonnaise things, which is just not right. If it's gonna somehow end up on your burger, it should at least be listed on the menu board too. That pisses me off. And then if you return the burger - oh, it's got mayo - they will merely scrape it off and give it back. Big red flag there. I mean, I get it, not wasting food, but it's a big, expensive slab of meat coated in crap. Just make one not coated in crap to begin with. Problem solved.\n\nI don't eat red meat anymore, so I had the Elvis with a turkey burger instead - peanut butter, fried bananas... great idea. Really though, it's creative, but the excitement is gone after two bites when it's just kind of dry and the only enjoyable thing is the size of the thing.\n\nUltimately, Burger Urge just isn't what you so badly wish it was.

I treat it almost like a draft board, where everything listed has a chance to be bought. When I read \"Fat Boy Burger,\" it was destiny, cuz I definitely eat like one. Case in point: two burger places, in three days, where I ordered two burgers each. But this time, I held back on the fries and rings (yes both)....Fat Boy uses a damn quesadilla instead of a bun.\n\nYou definitely get the sense of a kitschy Americana theme here - perhaps a little forced, but not terrible or unwelcoming by any means. Plenty of good tv's, with the sound from a live Sharks game. Digging the fireplace and wishing more seats were next to it. But some guy spread out his hat, coat, and keys beyond his personal space across a table so he could read by himself in front of the fireplace, the entire hour while I was there. So annoying....Ok, I was kinda cranky. Sorry. \n\nI talked to two folks at the counter about what would be pink without being raw, so I decided on medium. Some places undercook, and some overcook. I'm disappointed without my rareness and juiciness. Obviously I need to start specifying medium rare when in doubt. You don't need to say it.\n\nThese folks were really nice and hopeful/confident that I'd enjoy my burgers, which goes a long way, and why I feel bad for dissing the burgers. They're conscientious as well. When I came out of the bathroom, the manager asked for the key back to give it to the next patron. I mentioned they were out of paper towels and he immediately apologized and wouldn't pass along the key  until he'd replaced them.\n\nBut regarding its burgers, Burger Urge remains a head scratcher. The Fat Boy wasn't pink but still tasted interesting due to the mild peppers and cheese (see pix). The Bacon Cheese burger was pink but tough and dry, is the only way I can explain it. Just odd, and disappointing. The burgers just don't live up to expectations, even though a 3-star average on Yelp isn't high in SF. Much of that is due to service and a clean, bright ambiance IMO.\n\nI have no problem with the pricing when you consider fresh ingredients, service, interior, and location. None of them is cheap.

When my order finally came after a 20 minute wait the French fries were cold.  The burger itself wasn't bad but it would have been much better if the roll wasn't stale.  From my perch I watched as a couple of young people walked away from the counter and moved on when confronted with the price while older, tourists, just pulled out their credit cards.  I will say this, the bathroom was clean and on Haight Street that's good for a couple of bucks. \n\nBurger Urge is certainly no Super Duper in the burger dept.  It is, however, a way overpriced tourist trap with a good clean bathroom.", "author": "Nick C."}

The quality of the meat was a nice slab of Niman Rancher's chuck I believe- good stuff. I ordered the Italian Stallion with sweet potato fries. The burger comes with basil, mozzarella , garlic aoli. I opted for the Gouda instead - felt right. So off the bat I notice the crabby patty sized bun-a chewey texture with a nice pull apart consistency, but a little too greasy. I ordered my burger medium well and got it medium. Big whoop I know, but the little things count and preparing your food how you ordered it should be a standard. The meat overall was good, a step up from Fatburger. I could barely trace the garlic aoli which I was looking forward to. The Gouda was not melted well onto the meat. It looked like a half ass attempt at what usually happens when I try to  make a cheeseburger, except i didn't pay near as much lol. So maybe the Gouda was not the best substitution- nonetheless still tasted descent. The portion of sweet potato fries were good and they tasted very plain with no seasoning in \"sigh\" (i crack myself up). But regrettably after lf trying the garlic fries from a colleague I had to slap myself 2x for not getting them.\n\nThe price is insane. For a burger, fries, and a bottle of h20 it cost around $20.

I would say its menu could be tuned up and its prices are a bit high for what you get, but I'm not about to lambast the place for accomplishing what it sets out to do: make serviceable burgers and part tourists from their money. I've been in multiple times because I used to work in the area, and found the counter staff to be courteous and helpful. \n\nSo, let's talk about their food. Their garlic fries are delicious and greasy as one would expect. I love their milkshakes, and due to the open kitchen layout you can see that it's straight up ice cream and milk going in there, not some weird pre-mixed sludge. Their salads are enormous, easily two meals worth of food, making them the ironic standout in terms of bang for your buck. And their burgers are ... adequate. The portions are hearty and some of their specialty burgers are pretty great. If you're the adventurous type, I'd highly recommend the Elvis, and if you're opting for something more conventional The Love & Haight or The Italian Stallion are all strong contenders. Their Pineapple burger was weak, though: it just had some canned pineapple strewn atop it, which was not what I pictured when they said it came with \"grilled pineapple\" \n\nGiven the price for a burger (high) and the relative cost of french fries (low), I think an order should really come with a nice handful of plain french fries.

I have honestly never seen that in a restaurant before and this place gets major props for that.  \n\nThe food on the other hand was so-so.  The burger was cooked well, however the bun overwhelmed the sandwich quite a bit.  Too much bread, even though the burger was pretty big which means the burger came out looking big and awesome, but it ended up being a lot of everything but the actual burger.  I'm wondering if I got the San Francisco burger which came on toasted sourdough if it would have been better.  The fries were shoestring cut, thin and sadly under seasoned.

If it wasn't for a decent milkshake - I honestly wouldn't have had over 100 calories based on what I actually ate.  I ordered a veggie burger - and while some places have good homemade ones - and others have clearly frozen patties - Burger Urge had the worst concoction I'd ever seen.  It was as if the thing was breaded fried, and seriously it was crumbly and fell apart.  I likened it to the leftover stuff that accrues on a flat grill like they use - it was as if that was put into a patty of some kind - and covered with onions, bean sprouts, and a poor excuse for good bread.  They claim this was homemade - I claim they have no idea what a veggie burger is.  Seriously it was so bad - I was going to save it and show it to my neighbor who is in the food business. \n\nThen I not too smartly order Cheese Fries.  This was an adventure - the fries honestly were not freshly cut - and in a place like this, how do you expect to differentiate yourself? Cut 'em fry 'em - serve em! Nope, these were truly awful shoestring french fries, and instead of a nice you know, cheese sauce - which is what one typically thinks of when they order cheese fries - these geniuses threw it onto the grill with some cheddar cheese forming a nice block of bad french fries and clumpy cheddar that only hung onto a few fries.  \n\nSo not only was it truly the worst veggie burger I've ever been served, it also came with french fries that were awful - and not cheesy.  \n\nI am not a vegetarian either, I just like a good veggie burger - and I'd say goodbye to ever considering a burger from this place again - of any kind.  The milkshake was good, but of course, small in size for the nearly $6.00 I was charged for it. \n\nI don't think the owner understands that there is a mix of walk about tourists - and locals that eat here all the time.  Your location will need both to survive - tourists will find something more niche like and interesting - unless they are from the Midwest, you'll get those folks (me).

The burgers I ordered were overpriced and bland, and my experience was less than accommodating. For instance, I came here seriously hungry for a juicy, mouth-watering burger, that would fill my stomach, and make me satisfied in a comforting way. The large sign \"Burger Urge\" pulled me in. My sister lined up, ready to make a purchase that would satisfy my craving, as I waited in another line to use the bathroom. \n\nAs I was waiting in this line, one of the workers started barking at the people waiting next to me, saying you have to make a literal purchase before you can use the bathroom. In my opinion, I think if your party is about to make a purchase for you, that counts as being a customer. A tourist said to the barking employee, \"I have someone waiting in line,\" but the employee said \"no, it's our policy that you have to make the purchase first.\" I felt bad for the tourist, who obediently left, while I stayed quiet and used the bathroom. \n\nI ended up not finishing the mushroom cheeseburger my sister ordered for me, and the tuna melt for my mom was too salty.", "author": "Jenny L."}

I truly hope this place improves by actually making some easy changes.\n\nI've lived in the Haight my entire life and have tried all the restaurants the neighborhood has to offer. I waited in anticipation for Burger Urge to open! Alas, my expectations dwindled after the fist bite.\n\nI ordered a basic cheeseburger and the basket of fried vegetables. I was happy to see something other than fries on the board. Sigh.\n\nThe burger: BLAND, under-seasoned and uneventful. The bun was tasteless and close to eating a piece of dry foam. I sort of ate around the bun, but since the burger wasn't much better, I left half of it on my plate.\n\nThe fried vegetables: On a good note, there was broccoli and asparagus! On a bad note, it came with no dipping sauce or anything to combat the dryness. Even a small side of ranch dressing would have worked here. The only condiments on hand were ketchup and yellow mustard, not really what I want on my broccoli. I didn't even see any mayonaise in the house. Maybe there was some int he back if I had gone back to the counter to ask.\n\nIn short, skip this place for now and maybe they will get the kinks out in the future.

That's how I feel about Burger Urge. I passed by Burger Urge on a regular basis because it's in my 'hood. So when I saw the \"coming soon\" signs I squealed with joy. Could there finally be another restaurant that serves up a burger that is comparable or perhaps even better than Magnolia's famous burger?\n\nTheir menu is packed full of delicious sounding burger concoctions. But oh wait half their items aren't even available. Why put it on the menu when you can't even order it? Makes no sense.\n\nI ordered a bacon cheeseburger, sweet potato fries and regular fountain drink. That's it. In total that cost me about $19. WTF. That is so ridiculously expensive. At least offer some sort of combo value meal. No joke I ordered two double-double meals from In-N-Out the other weekend that in total was less than my meal at the Burger Urge. If you are in the business of benchmarking, Burger Urge you fail big time in comparison to your peers.\n\nMy friend ordered a breakfast burrito from this place and he hated it. Let me qualify my previous statement by saying my friend I ate with likes everything. His standards of food is low. As long as it is mildly edible, he will enjoy most foods. And even he hated his food at the Burger Urge. Plus the side of potatoes his breakfast burrito came with were as hard as rock.

Along the way I experienced a 1 hour delay - thanks MUNI. Anyway, I eventually got to the Haight around 8:30 and discovered all the stores I intended to make rounds at were closed. I was hungry and stumbled upon Burger Urge. I used to know the neighborhood really well because I went to high school in the area. But it had been a long time since I'd been back, so this place appeared new. \n\nI was really impressed with the amount of seating, that was all wood stock, and the flat panels that were all around the place. This being the Haight, I really wondered how much of a problem with the homeless they had. It is a fine line that the local Haight stores walk. From what other reviewers have mentioned about the bathroom situation, I would say you need to realize that because this is the Haight the standards are different. You can't have the homeless people walk in there and shoot heroin and snort crack in the bathroom. It happens. Regardless, the place is kept very clean and the place looked nicely lit when I visited.\n\nWhen I visit for the first time, I usually like to go all out to do a mini stress test. I asked what was their favorite and predictably it was what my heart was craving. The  Southwestern burger I believe I ordered, it included bacon strips! I was too chicken to order the $29.99 burger. I thought, wow that better be a damn good burger. I added a kicker of Sweet Potato fries and an Anchor Steam. I was not really happy that this all came out to about $20. But I gave them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nI should mention that the service was awesome that night. Shaana was really sweet and really engaging. Even liked that she threw in a little \"fa'sho\" while taking my order. That's the only in SF character that made me smile.  As I sat for my order she brought me my beer and poured it out. Then brought out my food. She then said she'd get me some honey for the fries. In which I returned saying, \"oh you're sweet enough!\" \n\nI think the arguments about value are quite valid, I can't exactly say that this was worth the 10-15 dollars in terms of solely the burger. A burger from Bull's Head out in West Portal station is unrivaled and far better if you get a chance to try theirs. It's highly unlikely that I'd return to this place again, but only because I'm not exactly close in proximity to this neighborhood. I had to mark it down for the value, but I bumped it up for the service. Too good to go un-noticed.", "author": "Michael C."}

For the $4.50 we paid for each item, we couldn't believe how little we were getting.\n\nAs if the wait and price weren't enough, the sweet potato fries were soggy (gross), the chili cheese fries had American cheese on top (whaat?!) and the chili was more like beans and water (no thank you).

I think my burger and fries order came to about $14.50, without a drink.\n\nMy 'medium' burger was 'well done', dry and mostly flavorless.  I was a bit disappointed.  The \"crispy bacon\" wasn't as crispy as I like so I had to throw it in the microwave for a minute.   Generally when a place asks you how you'd like your burger done in this city, you can expect a pretty good burger that taste custom and handmade versus the \"we only serve it one way, well done, frozen patties\" that many places serve, like bars.  This burger wasn't much better.\n\nThe fries were pretty good but still expensive.\n\nThe service was very nice and courteous.

So when I saw that they had a burger with peanut butter, bacon, and fried bananas called The Elvis, I was stoked!  It immediately brought back nostalgic memories of a place called the Corvette Diner in my home town of San Diego, only there, on their Brenda Burger, it's lettuce instead of bananas.\n\nAnyway...\n\nSo yes, as another yelper said, the look was initially quite impressive, and they don't skimp on the beef by any means, but when I opened up my burger I thought they had forgotten the bananas.  But then I saw the two or three little burned pieces of banana which ended up devoid of flavor.  (Bear in mind, I've had fried bananas my whole life.)  Whatever.  Then I took a bite and it was soooo dry, and I reopened my burger thinking they'd forgotten the peanut butter too!  But then I found it.  Yeah.  I found the peanut butter.  I don't think I realized it was peanut butter because it just looked like a little bit of discoloration on the bun.  Seriously!?  If you're going to have a peanut butter burger, you should be able to see and taste it!!  I think I tasted it during one bite, but it was more like \"essence of peanut.\"\n\nSo basically I was left with a dry hamburger with a couple tiny pieces of hard bacon.  And this isn't the kind of burger you can put ketchup and mustard on, ya know?\n\nAfter three bites I'd lost my appetite.  I just don't like that feeling of \"I could make this better myself at home.\"\n\nAlso, it's not that cheap either.  Two burgers, one side of fries, and two drinks came to $33 or so.  I felt like it was kind of a ripoff for bad quality food.  All You Knead down the street has an amazing burger with waay better fries, and the one at Zazie is off the charts as well.  By the time you spend that much money, you could have had the AMAZING  cheeseburger at the W Hotel San Francisco, which is a 4 star hotel, AND comes with perfect french fries, actual casual fine dining table service, and the ability to order a beer to go with.\n\nI'd say I was going to try it again, but I don't think I'm going to have \"the urge\" ever.  I was soooo looking forward to having a new spot too!  Oh well, better for my wallet, and my waistline.", "author": "Kicker .."}

I live only a few blocks away, so the suspense was killing me as I waited for it to finally open.\n\nAnd I'm sorry to admit that it was a disappointment. I ordered the Love and Haight burger, while my boyfriend had the Elvis. They both sounded quite flavorful. One with sprouts, avocado, and garlic aioli...and the other with typical Elvis ingredients (peanut butter, bacon, etc).\n\nBut they were very lackluster. The Love and Haight just didn't have much oomph to it at all, while the Elvis literally was just meat, bun, peanut butter, and some bacon. I felt ripped off. We shared the chili cheese fries, along with 2 sodas. and our total came to over $30. Talk about expensive.\n\nFor all the burgers being mostly $9 and up, I would expect to be blown away with them. Even the chili cheese fries were unimpressive. Their housemade chili seemed more similar to some sort of tex-mex bean salad. Not the sloppy, gooey, stoner mess that I was hoping for.\n\nI'd give them 3 stars because the service was very friendly, and the restaurant is spacious and clean. But the food is so overpriced and bland. And for being on touristy Haight St, they sure play out-of-touch music. Evanescence and Phil Collins aren't exactly \"happening\" music acts. It really added to the strip mall vibe of the place.\n\nBut the place is new. Hopefully they'll make some improvements, and perhaps make specials available.

I had lunch at the Burger Urge this past weekend with my wife and daughter. Together we ordered 3 sandwiches, two orders of fries, a beer, a root beer, and an apple juice. The bill came to $61. That seemed high to me, but I just signed the credit card receipt that I was given (not itemized), then went to my table to wait for the food to arrive. As I was sitting there, I looked at the menu board posted above the counter and couldn't figure out how my bill got so high. At that point, I went back to the cashier and asked for an itemized receipt. The first thing I noticed on the itemized receipt was that there was a 15% GRATUITY added to the bill. I immediately asked the cashier why she hadn't told me that a gratuity was automatically added to my bill (in addition to the small tip I had added to the credit card slip myself). She explained in a matter of fact way that Burger Urge \"ALWAYS ADDS A 15% GRATUITY FOR PARTIES WITH MORE THAN 2 PEOPLE\"!!! I then asked where I could find that policy on the menu board. At that point the cashier called her supervisor over. The supervisor explained that the policy is not shown on the menu board (or anywhere else where the customer might see it). When I asked the supervisor why I wasn't told about the gratuity, she simply repeated that \"we always do that\" (or something to that effect).  The supervisor promptly removed the gratuity from my credit card charge and apologized. We hadn't received our food yet (and we were really hungry), so I didn't make a big deal about the obvious attempted theft and risk getting some \"payback\" in our lunch (figured it would be safer - and more useful - to simply post this review on yelp). \n\nIt's a bummer because I really do like the food and the service is super-friendly, but the owner needs to be held accountable for a policy that is clearly implemented in a way that dupes unsuspecting customers into over-paying for their food.\n\nI look forward to hearing back from the owner on this one!", "author": "Chris S."}

My friend and I didn't finish our meals and when we got home we both felt sick.  The space itself is pleasant and atmosphere good, too.  But, the cost is waaaay tooo much!

But that is where the good news ends.\n\nThe man who took our order was disgruntled at best.  He was inpatient, unfriendly, and unhelpful.  \n\nThe bacon on the bacon cheeseburger was so overdone that it crumbled into small hard pieces.  The fries were overdone and only mediocre in taste.  I ordered my burger medium rare and it came out completely grey.  My wife ordered hers medium and it came out very pink.  \n\nThe menu says \"milkshakes: ask for flavors\".  But they seem to only ever have chocolate, vanilla and strawberry.  If you're menu is going to hint at variety, you might want to try some, well, variety.\n\nI'm sorry to say we won't be back.

My daughter had only driven though on previous trips and wanted to see it up close.  We stumbled upon this place and decided it was time for a bite, so in we went.  The order-takers were a little ditzy. Like an idiot, I added a 10% tip for the table service. BIG mistake.  That said, they did appear to put our orders in.  I ordered a BLT sandwich for my daughter and me to share with a bowl of tomato soup and my son ordered the bacon  burger and fries.  He also ordered a shake.   The sandwich came.   Then, a little later the burger came.  The shake came.  The soup?  Didn't come.  So I reminded the runner and she gave me this diatribe about how burgers and sandwiches are ordered through the system one way and soup is ordered a different way.  Oookaaaay -- so just bring me the soup. Whatever.  Some time later after all of our other food had been eaten, the tomato soup comes out.  It was literally swimming in grease. This soup wasn't just made with tomatoes and broth or milk.  I am guessing it must have had some kind of cheese melted and incorporated into it.  It didn't say as much on the menu, but I don't know what else would create an orange oil slick on top of a bowl of ... soup --  tomato soup.   If there were animal products in this soup, I would think vegans would need to know this. I'm not a vegan, and I will eat cheese, but still.  People should know what they're eating.   I didn't really want tomato cheese soup. Cheese is fine. I just prefer it not to be in the form of an oil float on top of my supposedly healthy soup. \n\nHorrible service.  Overpriced food. DON'T tip the order takers until your order has been received satisfactorily. The sandwich was mediocre. The burger was good, but still not worth the price they were charging. $50 blown and a lesson learned.  We will never, ever go back to that place. \n\nPathetic.", "author": "Melissa L."}

Ummm, yes you did have milk because I have always ordered it for my son, so thanks - now he gets juice. My \"medium\" burger was more like medium rare, the onion rings really greasy, and the kid's grilled cheese used to be a whole sandwich - now it's a half.\nMy husband pays and comes to the table wondering how our bill got to $51 - no itemized receipt given. We do the math - which doesn't add up, he asks for a receipt & we notice a 10% surcharge (on top of the Healthy SF fee). He asks about this and the employee points to a sign about an add'l fee (basically a built in tip) - well, hey guess what - my husband added a tip on unaware of your extra 10%.

I went back and walked in with the newly released SF Weekly because I couldn't find the new issue of Bay Guardian.  It's almost garish from the outside and kind of a formula approach, think CHAIN, to it's bill of fare.  Windows and Wood are the main ingredients of the look and decor, toss in a bunch of flat screens and sports from around the world and updated color menu boards.  Very au courant items populate the menu and the place is new, so I forgive them their simple glitches like no napkins with your food when it's served and no cutlery either.  You order at a counter, pay and are given a number on a pointer, then grab a seat and wait for the food to be brought to your table.\n\nI picked a window table fronted by knee high to rooftop level windows that slide open when weather permits, and this is the heart of the Haight Ashbury so there is always plenty to see, probably a lot more than whatever sports are chewing up the flat screens.  So I ordered half pound Niman Ranch burger, the menu said it came on toasted Ciabatta but not this time, some regular fries, battered onion rings and an order of the Slider's which were only $7.99.  The prices are all very good and they're brand new so they are bound to have a few shortcomings in the beginning.  The fries and onion rings were delicious and generous in portion, and they weren't greasy at all.  I repeat that the fries and rings were free of grease and tasty as can be.  I was surprised that the menu said the burgers come on either a toasted whole wheat bun or a toasted Ciabatta roll.  I had my heart set on the Ciabatta but what I got was a very lightly toasted, heavily seeded spongy bun.  The meat was cooked just right and it came with pickles, sliced red onion and lettuce with a small swath of mayonaise on the bottom half of the bun.  I ordered my burger with Swiss and it was melted just right.  The Sliders were just OK.  The meat was good and each tiny meat patty was presented with catsup and a pickle slice and served on what appeared to be some kind of French Roll cut into thirds and it was too chewy for easy eating.\n\nAll in all Burger Urge is a welcome addition to the Haight and should do very well in that burger deprived neighborhood.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-12-11", "description": "This is the closest place to my house, literally two doors down.  I want to love this place.  I am incredibly partial to burgers and would literally be their biggest patron if only they put out a better product.\n\nI'm writing this is because I want them to be one of my default places.  Honestly they'll succeed without my patronage, there's to much foot traffic for them to need to rely on locals.  I just want to feel like I'm getting value when I go there and I don't feel I do.\n\nAt the price point they're asking they should have the second best burger in the neighborhood, only the legendary burger at Magnolia should be better.  Fortunately there are two other places within a block that offer better tasting burgers at a much more reasonable price-point with waited service and a less chaotic atmosphere. \n\nHere's the deal, after spending $11 with tax for a burger and only a burger the highlight of the experience shouldn't be the Brioche roll.  Granted the Brioche is an extraordinary choice and I applaud it, but it shouldn't be a burgers singular outstanding feature.  Notice if you will I'm not using the word \"meal\".  \n\nFries or any other side are not included.  For that you will spend another $5 min. each and another $5 for a shake or beer.  More than $20 for a mediocre meal isn't a quantifiable expense for me.\n\nWhat makes it mediocre.\n\nLet's start with the patties.  The Neiman Ranch beef is lacking on the flavor scale.  With 1/2 pound patties that's a whole lot of lack.  Smaller patties would be advised.  Frickin' 1/2 a pound of flavor deficient beef is wasteful.  Smaller patties would allow them to have less offensive pricing and not run their patron's caloric index to dangerous levels.  When you include this with the price and lack of reasonably sized and priced portions of most of their sides there's an issue.\n\nSpending nearly $25 for a burger, fries and beer/shake is reasonable if you're putting out an extraordinary product or experience.  Burger Urge currently offers neither.  There are places within a couple blocks that do and I'll continue to frequent them.  Until Burger Urge compels a change I'll spend my $20's elsewhere.\n\nI'm actually disappointed by this.  I want to be a regular here, I want to like Burger Urge, but from what I see they are just interested in being a place that exploits the tourist traffic in The Haight.  That's their prerogative, as mine is to eat elsewhere.", "author": "Jim S."}

So tonight, when we were in a hurry and hadn't yet had dinner, everyone said YES to burgers and I called ahead to place our order for pickup.  I used the menu attached to this site to make the selections.  I ordered three burgers, each priced at $9.50, no drinks, no sides.  As I was completing the order, the guy asked me for my name several times (how hard is it to get \"Jeff\" right?), so I assumed he was having difficulty hearing me. As we were finishing, he said \"That will be $?1.88\".  Since we had only ordered three burgers for less than $10 each, I assumed that the first word was \"thirty\".  Even though the connection was fuzzy, it didn't occur to me that it could have been \"forty\".\nWe pulled up outside the place and my wife hopped out with two $20's to pay for the food.  She came back a minute later saying she needed another two bucks.  As I handed her two bucks I asked her how that could be given that the online menu said it was $9.50 each for three burgers.  When she told this to the guy at the counter, he scoffed dismissively, saying \"That's always been wrong\", to which my wife answered, \"Don't you think you ought to fix it?\"\nHis answer: \"I told him how much it was.\" \nMy wife: \"Well, apparently he didn't hear you clearly, and your published menu advertises a different price.  Can I speak to the Manager?\"  \nHim: \"She's not here, but she's not going to do anything about it anyway.\"\nMy wife: \"I think she'd want to be aware that the place she's managing is committing false advertising... I'd like to leave a message for her, anyway.\"  \nHim: \"I'll tell her when I see her.\" \nMy wife: \"How do I know that you'll tell her?\"\nHim: \"Don't worry about it.  I'll remember.\" \nAccording to my wife, all of this was conveyed with a \"F... You\" attitude.  Granted, I was waiting outside in the car and not present myself, but my wife is not a hothead and she came back to the car STEAMING, saying \"We are never coming back to this (expletive deleted) place again!\" \nIf I were the manager of Burger Urge and I witnessed this, I'd fire the SOB who was on duty tonight, then I'd get online immediately and make sure all the menus that are out there are current.  \nIf I were the owner of the place, at very least I'd rip the manager a new one for allowing this sloppiness and for commanding so little respect from her employees.", "author": "Geoff H."}

We were at another place having drinks, when this new burger joint was mentioned. Just outside the window, sat a clean looking new spot I can yelp! A veggie burger and a small Caesar salad were on my mind all morning and this place was like a beacon of hope. Horray!! \nWe walk over, starving, and look through the menu. You order at a counter and they bring you out your meal. The place had plenty of open tables, but ALL of them were piled high with dirty plates and food. I mean to say, not a single table was bussed. We had to ask some people at the tall center table if they could make room. \nNow, the order. Some fun menu choices. All pretty pricey....but wait....ala cart menu? Meaning you order fries separate. That bumps your $11 burger to $15. I hate being cheated in restaurants! That's insane. We get to the counter. My friend orders the spicy chicken sandwich for $11 with no side. I order the basic burger but with a veggie patty. I ask if they make small salads and the girl behind the counter snaps back at me, \"NO! Only full size!\" Then just looks at me like I'm the asshole. So my friend and I agree to split a Caesar. We both just get tap water. This comes to $30! Whatever. As long as I get some good lunch. \nWhile waiting for our meal, I notice the woman next to me eating a burger that's oozing out of the bun. I start to realize she has the veggie burger! It's like liquid!! And its making a pile of sludge on her plate. I'm praying at this point that she's ordered something I have not. \nSure enough, my burger comes out. It's huge. So I cut it in half and the patty smears out of the bun like watered down play dough. I don't care. As long as it tastes good. It doesn't. Really. It was so bland and grainy....like wall paper paste. It was the WORST meal I've had in SF! I couldn't even eat it. it was disgusting. I gave up and ate the salad. \nI'm never coming back here. I'm telling everyone I know how turrible this place is.

There is actually a salmon sandwich that is $15 and that doesn't include sides.  I don't even think it's wild salmon.  I didn't get it but have to say I was shocked at the price at a walk-up burger joint.\nOn to the burgers.... we got the specialty burger with avocado, bean sprouts and pesto aioli... first of all they were out of sprouts but didn't mention it until we got the burger and I asked where they were.  Would have been nice to know a key ingredient is going to be missing before paying for the order.  The burger was pretty bland.  Just not much flavor at all.  The bun was lacking too.  Never paid too much attention to the bun on burgers but this was dry, flavorless and just not right.\nAlso got the BLT which was ok.  Hard to screw up a BLT.\n\nOne thing I have to write about since it really annoyed me.  The menu says beers are $3.99.  Well it turns out half the bottled beers they have are $10 each.  That is not on the menu anywhere.  I found it very misleading.  The guy at the counter said with tax these beers would come to close to $12 each.  For a bottled Chimay?  I can buy a Chimay draft at a bar down the street for $7 TOTAL.  Total ripoff on beer here.\n\nBottom line I was disappointed.

It's HUGE for a burger joint, and I am not sure where they are going with the strange decor? (or lack there of) I ordered a cheesburger with pepperjack. They had a few speciality burgers, but I wanted to try the basics first. At $7.99 plus tax, totaling $9.07, this was a bit much for a burger! The Niman Ranch beef is so overrated, and everyone uses it as a \"marketing strategy.\" As long as the beef is high quality, it will speak for itself! I liked to brioche style bun, lightly toasted. It's a 1/2 pound burger, so it is filling. I am still trying to understand the orange twist garnish. Overall, if you just want a basic burger, this place will do you fine. Me however, I don't think I will be getting the \"Urge\" to go back anytime soon.", "author": "Damon W."}

The beef patties were the highlight of the meal -- juicy & flavorful.  The buns were also noteworthy- definitely not your ordinary bun.\n\nSam the owner was on site that night & going around greeting patrons- great casual atmosphere, will definitely be back!", "author": "Karen F."}

No burger here was less than $8 and it doesn't even come with fries. Someone in the place ordered a $6 shake and it was the most disappointing thing I have seen in a long while. Nothing in this place was great and in my opinion below average. The place just looks cool from the outside that's about it. Not worth the time.", "author": "Tyler C."}

These people really know what they're doing.  The place was absolutely packed (presumably because it's new), so the wait was a little longer than I would have liked, but the service was good, and the food itself was fantastic.  They clearly use the highest quality meat for their burgers.  I would say that every self-respecting carnivore in SF owes it to herself/himself to make a pilgrimage to the Urge.", "author": "Mike M."}

So I go in there the first day they open order a medium done burger with mushrooms, mustard, and onions. I waited an appropriate amount of time, got my burger to go and left. When I bit into it I immediately spit it out and looked inside. This burger was not even close to being done it was 70% raw! There were no mushrooms or mustard packets inside. So I went back to tell them, they say oh I'm sorry and proceeded to \"fix\" it. After again waiting, I got it and left, somewhat annoyed. I open it, look at, when I got the chance to sit down and wow...They used the same bun I had bit into, put more fries on top of the existing ones...this was ridicules. Oh and I got the most dry burnt piece of meat EVER! Besides this, the bite I took had no flavor and I was very unsatisfied for the amount of money I basically put in the trash.", "author": "Valerie N."}

It's a good place...ambience is fine, decorations are fine, menu is clear. Service is friendly.  The burger I ordered (Love and Haight) was delicious and fries were bountiful. They forgot to put my order in, adding 15-20 minutes to the wait...longer than it should have been for a \"fast food\" experience. They should have offered a free shake or something.   I compare this place to In n Out, Burger King, etc.  I know they have to cook after the order, so I'm willing to wait an extra few minutes, but this was a bit too long. I almost canceled the order and left.  Price was also about 30% more than I would have liked to have paid for such a meal. I hope they can maybe give me a few less fries and charge less since I couldn't finish the fries.  Burger was good though, so I'm not saying it's not a bad place.  I wanted to like it more. Hopefully they can get their act together on speed of service.  I would not say no to trying it again, but honestly I would prefer something like a $7.99 Simpleburger with pickle, tomato, onion, lettuce, and thousand island dressing. One big patty.  Mmmm.

It sits on a nice bun and the toppings are fresh, but the patty itself gets a thumbs down (ok, i think i made my point).  The fries aren't that good either.  the fries down the street at mc d's are better (and cheaper)(i hear, because you would never catch me in a mcdonalds...never, i swear, never).  Onion rings get a thumbs up.  The people behind the counter are super nice, so it doesn't seem to be for a lack of trying that this place misses, but man you have to fix that burger.  and god, it's awful bright and flashy for the haight.", "author": "howdy d."}
