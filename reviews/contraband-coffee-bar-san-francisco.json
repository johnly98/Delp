I ordered a regular coffee because I was a little nervous to go outside of my comfort zone when it comes to coffee.

Contraband definitely fits the bill for that. The barista there recommended the Ethiopia bean when I asked for something with a nice bold fruity taste with low acidity. Not only was he spot on with the rec, the bean was just as good as Four Barrel or Sightglass. I ended up getting a bag of it to brew at home and so far it's been great.\n\nThe interior was very nice, bright, and airy. Lots of table space and chairs along with a strong wifi connection.\n\nClientele primarily comprised of 20 and 30 somethings working from the coffee shop or chatting about life.

Originally was on the way to Saint Frank Coffee which has 373 reviews 4 1/2 stars. We started from the Embarcadero, took the Muni, then the cable car, then got dropped off at Polk St. and was walking towards Saint Frank but made a loop around as I saw that Contraband Coffee Bar have 4 stars with 592 reviews. \n\nAfter a long walk in the cold I was excited to try this place out. As we approached the register, we were not greeted and we felt like he was rushing us to place an order. It wasn't not even busy. Being my indecisive usual self, I asked questions about the drinks. He seemed impatient so I settled with a drink called Dark White (Flat white with a piece of chocolate on the bottom) and my boyfriend ordered a drink called ice separator. \n\nAfter I came out of the bathroom and saw my dark white drink, I was shocked. For a drink that cost $4.75 plus 75\u00a2 for almond milk, the drink was the size of my fist and it was bitter and sour. I even added a piece of chocolate I brought and raw sugar. My bf's drink tasted gross also and it cost $6.50! We walked out and tossed our nasty drinks. \n\nI am thoroughly disappointed with this place, customer service-wise and the craft itself.

It was fairly packed on a Sunday afternoon with a primarily clientele of people studying or doing work, so it was a bit difficult to find a seat. I got a latte, which was decent, but definitely nothing outstanding about this latte that I'd rave about.

Pour over was exactly as described (read: I actually tasted the flavors in the description) and definitely the highlight\n2. Lots of seating, free wifi\n3. Coffee and espresso were smooth and well prepared\n\nCons:\n1. I ordered a \"dark white\", which was supposedly a flat white mixed with dark chocolate, a \"really intense mocha\". In reality it was a flat white with a bunch of dark chocolate stuck at the bottom. Could have been mixed better.\n2. We ordered waffles with our drinks. After about ten minutes of waiting it turned out they had forgotten to take them out and had burned them so they made new ones. The new waffles tasted undercooked and were not very good.\n3.

Conveniently, Contraband was just a short walk away, about 4 blocks. It was easy to spot with the red signage and outdoor seating. Inside, there's a decent amount of seating, including a communal high table in the center, high chairs along the windows, as well as a couple of side tables for 2. Saw a couple people with their laptops out, so I assume wifi is available. Good beverage offerings; there's a good photo of the menu in the gallery here. Also noticed they served Dynamo donuts - cool. We got a latte and a single origin Ethiopian pour over. Girlfriend enjoyed the latte, but mentioned it had a bit more foam than normal, almost like a cappuccino. The single origin Ethiopian was light and bright. I believe it is their lightest roast. We both liked their mugs. The latte came in a slim, tall, black mug with a generous handle, which we appreciated. The pour over came in a simple white mug with some cool Contraband branding.

I've been many of the better coffee shops around SF and Contraband stands out out as overpriced for what you get. This is most obvious with their drip coffee and $1.50 au lait surcharge.  An almond milk au lait, for example, would cost you more than $6 at Contraband - that's drip coffee plus steamed almond milk..nothing too fancy. The regular coffee prices are up there with the latte prices which just doesn't make sense and seems very unusual compared to other stores. I understand they source good quality beans and that costs more, and I would expect to spend between $4-$4.75 on this in most higher end shops, but $6+ for a basic drink is over the top. I'd recommend going to Saint Frank down on Polk, where they make their nut milk homemade everyday and it still costs less! The coffee is better and they are friendlier, too.  That said, Contraband coffee is good and they have some really interesting latte drinks with sage and rosemary for example, and those are totally worth the extra splurge once in a while", "author": "Liza M."}

The guy behind the counter came charging outside and snapped at me that I couldn't smoke in front of the place. So I meandered up a few feet past the story front, had a couple more drags, then went inside. He was definitely on edge, but I'm a New Yorker and a little tude is easily disregarded. I apologized for my faux pas (he didn't acknowledge my aquiescence or apology, but again who cares) and proceeded to order a red eye. \n\nHe then proclaimed that their coffees were all strong enough and he wouldn't make that. I looked over the menu and there were lots of choices for single origin drips/comexes. I chose the black market blend though because it's explanation was bold toasty and full bodied. I also ordered a shot of espresso. He pulled the shot and I sipped it well he brewed my cup. It did have a full flavor, but was a little watery and I'm glad I had the extra kick of caffeine to start off my day. I left Contraband with my brew and captain snappy didn't say another word to me.\n\nI've worked in the food and beverage business for 20 years and still do. I love good coffee.

Which is unfortunate, because it's the closest coffee-focused coffee shop to my apartment.\n\nI've tried their espresso and their pour-over, and got a bag of beans to brew at home. The espresso was pretty decent, if you don't mind a bit of acidity. The pour-over was a washed Ethiopia Yirgacheffe. It was OK; not much of the fruitiness you often get with Ethiopian coffees, but drinkable. Not really worth the four bucks or whatever they charge for it. I wasn't sure whether it was underwhelming because of the beans or the brewing -- pour-overs can be temperamental, after all.\n\nSo I brought  some beans home to try in my Aeropress; Costa Rican this time. Opening the bag, I got a whiff of something acrid, like burnt rubber. I used to play around with roasting coffee at home, and these beans smelled like some of the batches I messed up. The roast *looked* fine -- not too dark, pretty even-looking -- but smelled all wrong. I brewed up a couple of cups, and didn't finish them. They tasted pretty much how they smelled. So now I've got about 11 oz of Contraband Costa Rica coffee beans that I'm probably not going to drink; not a good use of eighteen bucks. (UPDATE: they got a bit less burnt-tasting after a couple more days' rest. Still not great, but drinkable.)\n\nNow, I don't want to be *too* harsh. Contraband is a fine neighborhood coffee shop, if you adjust your expectations. It's a pleasant space, lots of sunlight, and the espresso drinks are fine. I'll probably come here from time to time, when I don't feel like elbowing my way through the bruncher crowd at Jane's. But my search for a go-to neighborhood coffee shop continues.\n\nUPDATE: Adding a fourth star because this place has, in fact, become my go-to neighborhood coffee shop, albeit only for the occasional espresso. I'm still not going to buy any more beans to brew at home.", "author": "Nath A."}

I'm pleased that I gave them another chance. And another after that. And probably twenty more after that until I felt I had achieved a fair sampling. They really have changed their customer service for the better. The systemic douchbaggery from behind the counter has gone. The people who are working there are chill and won't make your grandma cry for asking why they don't just have a pre-made coffee pot. ***\n\nContraband's space is small, but well suited to accommodate laptops and coworking without rendering the space a cultureless office humming with the buzzing of drones. It's anything but. The spirit of the space is dominated by art. Usually good art. Local art. \n\nThe coffee is expensive. It's expensive for good reason. Their location is awesome, rent is probably astronomical, pour overs are labor intensive, and their beans are goddamn amazing and totally worth the price. Yes they have some crazy green matcha tea latte that probably tastes good if you're into matcha but their beans and pour overs are why this place is amazing. The two shining stars are both Ethiopian single origin. Despite a little batch to batch inconsistency in the amount of sour, the Ethiopian Yirgacheffe is consistently light, complex, bright, and citrusy, with a clean finish. On those days it is a tiny bit sour, this is easily the one of the best coffees I've ever had, anywhere. The Ethiopian Sidamo is consistently a thick bodied texture, rich with berries and sweetness, without much acidity. The finish is fairly clean but a little earthy boldness lingers. Their default size is 12 oz, but if you're an a-hole with a big personal cup, they are happy do the math and figure out how to get you a 16 oz. \n\nLook, the coffees are on par with Sightglass and Four Barrel but you don't have to expose your grandma to SOMA sidewalk surprises or mission penny-farthing enthusiasts respectively. You can come here and have a good cup of coffee even if you don't know a damn thing about coffee. You can eat a pastry that will make you fat and happy. Put a maple donut in your face, unless you like kale, in which case you can put a savory tart right in your precious little mouth hole. You can appreciate local art or get lattes that are a reasonable facsimile of art.

We came in last Saturday afternoon and ordered 2 regular lattes and a chai latte.  The chai latte and one of the regular lattes came out in a timely manner, so we waited for the other latte.  Finally after it had become apparent that we weren't going to receive the second latte we got back in line to inquire about the third latte, the barista insisted (read: argued) that that's not what we ordered, he said we ordered 2 lattes and an empanada.  The original woman who took our order must have made a mistake, in fact she had admitted she was having an 'off day' - no big deal just correct the problem, right?  Keep your empanada and just make us a latte, not that difficult.  No need to give us attitude or a hassle about the situation.  It took another gentleman (possibly a manager?) to intervene in order for us to get our Godforsaken latte.  We paid in cash so no receipt to show for it but should there even be a debate over who's right or wrong?

BUT the service I've got from the same guy is always terrible. He's incredibly rude.\nToday while waiting for him to take my order I was on the phone with my sister, he was busy making two other drinks for another customer and there was no one else waiting.  He hadn't even greeted me when he looks over and says \"there are no phone calls on the line\". No where did I see a sign saying this but I politely hung up my phone call and proceeded to stand there awkwardly in silence while he continued make the other drinks. After he takes my order he makes my drink and just drops it at the pick up station, doesn't say anything doesn't even say have a good day! It wasn't even busy for him to not have had the time and he seemed pissed off for no reason.\nI can understand the no phone rule if it was written down, but I was not just mindlessly talking and not paying attention to him, when he was ready I would have put my phone call on hold to give him my order. his tone was rude and it wasn't the first time i have received this bad attitude from him.

I don't know if I got the luck of the straw but I entered with two others just squeaking in front of me.  So there's 3 of us in line and a single barista.  The barista is trying to be efficient, but takes an order and than makes said item.  So instead of ringing and taking orders for 3 of us all at once and letting us get comfortable, I patiently wait for 10 minutes while she executes a chai, rings up next customer and than makes a latte.  \n\nWhile this is happening, another co-worker comes in.  No acknowledgement to customers patiently waiting in line.  He just opens his laptop and starts surfing.  Then takes the garbage out.  Almost walks into a customer with a mop not saying excuse me (even if it wasn't his fault).  \n\nTo be fair, the barista had a smile on her face.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-03-19", "description": "I remember the first time I visited Contraband. \n\nIt was July of last year, and I had just spent the weekend moving in to my apartment. I was eager to explore the surrounding area, where some very different (and recognizable) neighborhoods bleed into one another. Russian Hill is easily accessible to the north; the affluence of the top of Nob Hill looms to the east; Pac Heights is just a little west - but you need to cross the bar-and-restaurant-filled Polk Gulch first; and the beautiful California Street bustles with its cable cars toward the south, with the TenderNob close by. \n\nAdmittedly, I was overwhelmed. I was determined to find an identity within this seemingly hodgepodge intersection of lifestyles, activities and communities. I spent most of my afternoon trekking through the area in a wide loop. By the time I reached California and Larkin, I was exhausted and, like the caffeine-addicted San Franciscan I am, really in need of coffee. \n\nWalking up Larkin, that's when I saw it. A welcoming red awning jutting out over the sidewalk. Two large windows showcasing locals sipping on coffee, some chatting in pairs, others busily working solo on their laptops or peering back out at me. Wire tables and chairs outside with a few groups, smokers and dogs lazily enjoying the weekend. It was like the light at the end of the tunnel. Could this be my new go-to coffee shop? \n\nThere was only one way to find out.\n\nI walked through the door, and was immediately greeted by a wood, white-black-and-red-themed interior. A cool old-school letterboard on one of the walls listed some standard espresso drinks. The smaller menus on the counter had an assortment of drip coffee, teas, and snacks. The barista could tell that I'd never been before and was pleasant enough to walk me through some of the menu. In the end, I went for the soy cappuccino. You can tell that the baristas here treat the process of making espresso drinks as a true trade. My carefully-crafted soy cap had some beautiful latte art. Just the right amount of foam. \n\nIt tasted like the best espresso drink I'd ever had...except better. This was my new home coffee shop. I've never looked back.\n\nAs I started to go on a regular basis, it didn't take long for me to strike up a conversation with Josh, the owner. He's a really great, hands-on guy who knows how to run a coffee shop. He often works the morning shifts on his own. Always sociable and welcoming, Josh does his best to promote a sense of community in the area. Contraband has hosted numerous events on weekends, such as waffle-making or brewing lessons. They rotate local artists' pictures on the walls. Josh and his business partner clearly have a sense of humor (ask them what the wireless password is). No matter what time of day you drop in, if there are two or more baristas behind the counter, they're having a good time, even when the line gets long. I'm pretty sure Josh knows most (if not all) of the regulars by name...and their favorite drinks. \n\nOne of the greatest things Contraband has done - besides the excellent coffee - is to create a focal point for the people in our neighborhood. Many of the local store owners frequent each other's businesses, and Contraband is no exception. The 'regulars' tend to run into each other throughout the area as well, whether it's over food, drinks, or grocery shopping. They all have Contraband in common.\n\nI've noticed the main points of contention that bubble up in Contraband's rare negative Yelp reviews are the 'hipster vibe', or the 'pretentiousness'. To those of you who feel unwelcome, I urge you to stop in a few more times. I think folks are often intimidated by a coffee shop that roasts its own beans, boasts a snazzy espresso machine, and has baristas who actually know a thing or two about coffee. Like any relationship, it just takes a little time. I've never felt so at home in a coffee shop before.", "author": "Alyssa W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-08-20", "description": "Not even 15 seconds upon entering and this place already went off to a bad start. There was no one in line. One lady just paid for her order and the barista told me \"Oh. It'll be about five minutes.\" Five minutes for what? Tell me why at least so I won't be judgmental about it. Did she have a big order? (A few minutes later, I saw she only ordered two drinks. Again, there was no line. If this is about giving customers personal attention or devoting all your energy to making drinks, that's fine. But apparently he cancelled out that rationale for me.) And then when I asked him (since he needed five minutes and I needed to kill the time) if there was a wifi code, he said \"Sir. I will get to you in a minute with all that information.\" \"Umm... okay...\" I was just about ready to go, but I paid 2 bucks on the MUNI to get here and I'm gonna stay. Hey, I'm a grad student so 2 bucks means a lot --- especially in an expensive city like this. He said \"I can help the next person.\" I walked over from the communal table/stools, and I said \"Could I please have a double espresso over ice?\" \"I don't do espresso over ice.\" Hmmm okay... then he said, \"I can do an iced Americano.\" I don't understand why you can't do espresso over ice when that's basically what an Americano is after the ice melts (I can't stand watered down Americanos.) Anyway, the Americano came out to $3.80. Holy smokes. I know this is a gourmet coffee/espresso boutique brand, but $3.80? (I think the most I've paid for an Americano is $3.50 from Intelligentsia so Contraband wins! It's the Robin Leach of espresso bars!) I felt like that should come with at least a few biscuit! Geez. \n\nHe gives me the password information for the wifi, I get my drink, and it's fine... I'm not altogether crazy about the flavor of their espresso. It's silky and creamy (I'll give them that.)... but there's an aftertaste of something like stale espresso. For $3.80, I expected to taste like liquid gold. It was more like liquid silver. Meh. \n\nThe interior is fine... not very cohesive in style and aesthetic. The communal table has fresh flowers in sunken vases. Lots of birch action happening with the wood (not really a fan of birch. So generic!)... and there are some interesting (the default word when you don't have anything else to say) art pieces inside. Anyway, between the passive aggressive barista (I couldn't tell if by his \"sir\"s and strange way of dealing customers -- or, at least to me if he was being respectful or... passive aggressive), the humdrum espresso (and annoyance that I can't order espresso over ice), and the Willie Nelson or Garth Brooks (I can't deal with this country music. My ears were bleeding!) playing, there was no chance of me returning. I was hungry and wanted one of the famous Dynamo Donuts, but I didn't wanna spend another dime there. First impressions matter, and though it might be just one barista, that was enough for me to say \"No thanks, Contraband. Buhhhhhbye.\" I've been to over a hundred coffeeshops in SF, Chicago, LA, DC, NYC, and other cities (yes, I've kept count) and this has the honor of being my lowest rated one. Luckily, there are dozens of other places in San Francisco to patronize. \n\n(Oh... and after just reading the other reviews of this place, apparently several other folks have had issues with the barista with the mustache. Okay, I guess it makes me feel a little better that he's rude to others -- not that that is something to feel good about! Not exactly needing warm and fuzzy, but just be cordial!)", "author": "James Z."}

Contraband has to be among the worst for several reasons - rude staff, uninviting/stark atmosphere and bad coffee. We go there on occasion because my wife loves one of their signature drinks, but caveat emptor for everything else. This most recent visit, I ordered two things and they got both wrong. I asked for a regular latte (was given skim) and a bacon and egg empanada (was given vegetarian). When attempting to reconcile the situation, we were told they didn't hear me.

Friendly baristas, great espresso and coffee, square payment systems, slow drip coffee, plenty of seating, cool vibe, and so on. The list goes on. This is where things tend to get tricky. These things would normally warrant a 5 star rating in most cities. If you can pull these things off, you're doing it right. But we're not in any city. We're in SF and the competition is fierce. Slow drip coffee is the standard and the devil is in the details. I really love this place and they do everything really well. The only things I wish I could change about Contraband is the limited plug situation. I tend to work a lot from coffee shops, so this is crucial. To offset the lack of plugs, I find the balance and trade on this is they have great outdoor seating.

Loved the place, good-roasted coffee, and the staff is nice.\n\nI am giving two stars though because today I decided to bring my dog and found the treatment to be just a bit unfair. I had seen people bring their dogs in the first two days I was there. Some dogs came in off-leash and wandered up to everyone in the store and sniffed their bags/shoes. None of the staff complained so I thought it was safe to bring my dog as well. I left my dog(english bulldog) outside while I ordered. I went outside untied him and grabbed a seat. When my coffee was ready, I walked in with my dog picked it up, got milk + sugar and walked out to take a seat again (about 30 - 45 seconds). A few minutes afterward taking a seat, I was approached and told that I couldn't bring my dog in while I ordered unless he was a service dog (they were nice about it). I apologized, had my coffee, and then left shortly after.\n\nMy complaint is that I was asked not to bring him in because they didn't like my dog (and not because of the rules). When another dog comes in off-leash and no one complains vs my scenario ...it's just unfair treatment. \n\nBut again. Great coffee + nice staff.", "author": "Christopher K."}

There aren't alot of frills and whistles here - actually there aren't any, including sweetner for your latte, or cup sizes...But the minimalist approach to customer service is oddly charming, and unique to a coffee cafe.  \n\nThe coffee here is superb, each different bean has a distinct essence.  The quintessential taste and aroma of the bean is locked inside until it is violently released by the cupful through a necessary grinding and leeching process for your specific order.  Each cup of coffee is made to order, I love it!\n\nI also like their empanadas, the beef one is my favorite, and I also like the mushroom and gorgonzala one.  I recently brought a bunch to a staff meeting at work and they were a huge hit - everybody was so distracted by the yumness that they didn't even notice I was 15 minutes late!!\n\nThis is a comfortable place to hang around, free unlimited wireless, and in a cute area of Nob Hill.

Hayes Valley Espresso in the form of a perfect cappuccino was my staple for a decade. I've subsequently had some great espresso drinks from costa rican beans at Ritual and some well made drinks at Sightglass. Hit and miss at CoffeeBar. Usually always a miss at Four Barrel, where the espresso always seems over extracted and harsh. Recently went to St Frank where the gibralter had no flavor profile at all. Making great espresso is an art. There a so many minutia that can affect the extraction and I go to cafe's in hopes that all those things come together for my drink. I don't judge on a single drink. I try places and settle in where the flavor profile of the drinks generally suit my taste.\n\nFor the past year or so, Contraband Coffee is where I go most often to get the perfect cortado, macciato, or cap. Their house Illicit espresso blend is perfect with a little milk. It has a bit of citrus to cut the dairy and raspberry chocolate flavors underneath. I occasionally try their special and exotic roasts, just to compare, but in my opinion Contraband has the most consistently great espresso drinks anywhere.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-05-29", "description": "If I were rating this shop on coffee and service alone it would be 3/5, however, for those who study at cafes this is a 2/5. The coffee and tea here is quite exceptional, however, I visit cafes and spend hours here, so my review is based on multiple factors and not just the coffee. \n\n1.Music/Noise Lvl 2/5: This cafe is not jammed full of customers, however, the noise level always seems to be distractingly high (which some people like). Every moment there was someone around me talking loudly (and I wear noise canceling headphones). You cannot control the people around you, however, you can control the background music, machinery used, employees, etc. Employees are loud, music is played way too loud, coffee machine is also loud and distracting so this cafe is extremely loud. I feel like a old man complaining about noise level, but for someone who studies in a coffee shop this is not a good situation. It would be okay if you're casually grabbing coffee with a friend. \n2.Stud-a-bility(env which one can study) 2/5: This is a smaller coffee shop but there are tables just not a plethora of them. Also, the outlets situation is a struggle here. So either charge your laptop or study using your books.  You can def' study here, however you may have to wait for a table. Most of the tables are high off the ground which is not my thing. Also, the noise level in here is usually loud. Employees, customers, and music are always pulling my away from my books. So while there are tables to study and chat with friends it is not meant for those who need to focus and study hard.  \n3.Bathroom 3/5: nothing spectacular. SF cleanliness level of public bathroom \n4.Decor/Env 3/5: I generally study and dont look around in coffee shops, however, when I did here I noticed the art, decor, design, and layout is passable.   \n5.Price/Selection 3/5: While there is a decent selection of bakery goods, coffee, tea, etc the prices here are steep. I have accepted SF is an expensive city, but this is a little bit on the high end. But you pay for what you get. If you are okay with a $5 tea you will be given a higher quality beverage. \n6.Service 4/5: Employee seemed nice but didnt do anything to merit 5/5.", "author": "Soroosh A."}

Ordered a cortado, simple and a great way to compare beans. \n\nThe Scoop: \nCoffee was a bit bright, but that's a personal preference. If you like it on the brighter side, this is your place. Milk to espresso ratio in the cortado seemed high, too much milk. Didn't try the food, again not a sugar person. Prices seem a bit steep, $3.50 for a cortado. Even so, I spent quite a few years in the service industry, threw $1 in the tip jar.\n\nAnd Finally the Miserable:\nThe staff, especially the guy with the ironic mustache are incredibly rude.

I had two bags of coffee beans to purchase when I approached the counter and simply asked for the price. There were no price tags on the product or the display shelf. I was going to buy the beans and order two drinks. When I asked, \"how much are these?,\" the guy rudely brushed me off to a sign that listed the prices and quickly helped the next person in line. What are you, the coffee nazi? I couldn't have a second to complete my order? I had to wait there for several minutes until I got another turn. When my drink was ready the barista was pretty pissy when he had to call it out more than once. Like another reviewer said, I was sitting right in front of him at the bar but I had to get up and out of my chair to get my drink. Could have just handed it to me. I don't need people to be super nice to me but don't be a D*CK! Looking back I don't know why he was in such a hurry to justify rushing me like that. There wasn't a long line or anything. He seemed way speedier than the whole vibe of the place called for. And it was a lazy early weekend morning. Jerk.", "author": "Suzanne M."}

Maybe I'm not a coffee connoisseur (heaven forbid, I'm not a SF hipster), my palate having mostly been subjected to Starbucks over the years, but I just didn't find the gourmet blends available here worth the price premium (or maybe I just couldn't tell the difference, I'll admit it, I'm not hip enough yet for the artisan coffee movement).  \n\nIt wasn't the coffee, however, that ruined my experience.  It was the irate Howie/handlebar mustache sporting barista, who thought he was God's gift to coffee, that was responsible for  tainting my experience at this place.  \n\nHis manner was brusque and supercilious. The first thing we tried to order resulted in a disdainful \"I'm not doing those anymore\" response.   He offered absolutely no help with picking between the different blends.  We tried asking for a recommendation and received a rather world-weary \"what type of coffee do you like\" retort as though he was exhausted with dealing with imbeciles like us all day.\n\nSecondly, we were seated outside and my girlfriend made the fatal mistake of setting her bag down on the \"no smoking\" sign on the table.  Within 20 seconds of me lighting my smoke, this guy rushes out and in the most condescending fashion imaginable goes \"we have signs posted EVERYWHERE (slight exaggeration), there is absolutely no smoking allowed beyond the fence\".    Instead of escalating the situation with a \"dude chill the &%^$ out, it was an accident\", I simply just got up from the table and walked away.   Horrible experience.

My GF stuck to her lattes but was really happy with them in general especially with the house espresso blend which held up well to the milk.\n\nWe grabbed a Dynamo maple bacon donut one day and some granola bars for the road another.

I opted for one of the 'Amazing Bars' granola bars which was incredible (filling and healthy). My non-fat latte was perfection. \n\nI sat my butt down in a barstool facing the window, pulled out my laptop, and stayed there for a good 3.5 hours. The staff was incredibly friendly and never seemed annoyed that I stayed there as long as I did. It never got too crowded to the point where all the chairs were being used up anyways which was nice. I was actually able to take a call for work in here comfortably. The music volume is set just right, and the crowd seemed to all be quietly chatting or working on their laptops.\n\nThis may very well be my new favorite coffee spot in the neighborhood. The only downfall is I'd like to see more outlets near the window side walls, but thankfully I came fully charged today so it wasn't much of a problem.

Still nothing. I have an original edition Quickmill Vetrano (high end) and could not pull a decent shot even with a more forgiving double shot.

Needed beans for my espresso machine anyway and was headed to SF, but the coupon brought me here. Loved most parts of everything here. I am giving 4 stars because I loved it so much, but there were some things that could have potentially lowered my rating: no parking (at all, parked 4 blocks away!), my cappuccino was a bit milky/non-strong for my taste - but I also brew my own at home so ......\n\nThe best:\nSuper friendly staff. Freakin' nice. Incredibly knowledgeable. Knew how to recommend beans for home and then upon discussion re-recommended Yergacheffe for my preference...! Talked espresso machines, grinders, roasts, pull times, basket size etc. Definitely could hold his own. They even greeted us as we walked in the door even though there were some indecisive people mulling around at the counter.\nAtmosphere is relaxing without being stuffy, overly decorated/furnished. Just calm.\nSnacks were YUMMY. Got two sandwich cookies with dulche de leche in the middle, one covered in chocolate and the other plain vanilla. So good. wish we'd bought more.....\n\nBack to the actual drink: It was beautiful and positively smooth. Thick dense foam, etc. But the espresso flavor that should be prevelant was somehow missing. So it was either too wet (too much milk) or I just don't favor that espresso, Illicit I believe.\nI haven't tried my home beans yet, I'm letting them bloom and finishing off my other beans, so we'll see how they compare.", "author": "Beca B."}

The baristas here are friendly even to those who I would even dub as annoying.  That is, the person who asks  for 'just a bit more coffee' in their cup because they added too much sugar initially. Note that each cup of coffee is brewed individually so even if he just wanted a little more to even out the sweetness they'd have to brew more just for him.  Anyway, the barista did so.  Is it odd that I was annoyed on their behalf?  Maybe it's because I find that adding sugar and milk to individually brewed coffee an adulteration of the coffee. \nAnyway, there's plenty of seating considering its size with a communal table, seating along the window and barista bar.

Also the worker was rude before the change incident. Did not tell us to wait when it was our turn just ignored us and when we did order he said it would take 5-10 minutes, it took only about 3.

There's a large selection of coffee beans, all medium-ish roasts, sourced from different parts of the world.  After browsing and talking to the knowledgable guy behind the counter, I selected a Yemeni coffee.  It was a medium roast, slightly on the darker side that was quite good, earthy and nutty, for $4.  They have options for other sizes and may involve different ways of preparation too.  Had some value left over, so I ordered a Spinach & Feta empanada.  Flavor was good, but even after heating it up the outer crust was a little thicker than I'd like, but that's just my preference.\n\nDecent amount of seating for a small location (~20?), but the wifi/internet connection was acting up.

It was a short walk, but I was consumed the entire time with a sense of perambelation, which is a word I made up to capture that feeling of euphoria induced by a particularly lovely or particularly needed walk.  The sun was so shiny, the streets so scrubbed and fresh.  All the shop windows gleamed and the Tenderloin seemed, for a moment, tender.\n\nYou may, as my boyfriend did, suggest that perambelation already exists in the English lexicon.  And it's true that \"peramb-Ulation\" does.  One definition is \"to walk or travel about; to stroll\" (dictionary.com).  \n\nBut \"peramb-Elation\" is that joy experienced in the pleasure of taking a walk.  It comes from 1) the deliciousness of moving the body after sitting at your desk, at a computer, for most of the day, combined with 2)  looking about and seeing your City trying to impress you for a change.\n\nAdd a touch of caffeine, and voila.  \n\nPerambelation.

The outlet that was once available by the bar/counter is now covered because the bar is meant for chatting.

A first for me (the cortado, not a free coffee), and it was the best damn coffee drink I've ever had in my life -- smooth, creamy, incredible mouthfeel -- just perfect really.  So good I even made a detour in my last-minute shopping last Friday to get another one (not free, alas, but well worth the money.)   \n\nHaven't tried anything but the cortado, but I have a feeling everything else is just as tasty.  Dynamo donuts -- hey, you know that's a sure thing.  And I'm sure I'll get around to trying their drips and lattes and all.  But I can't get that damn cortado out of my brain.\n\nOther than the coffee itself, nice mix of customers (had a lovely chat with a sweet retiree at the coffee bar), outgoing and helpful people working there (I don't know much about coffee but they obviously do -- and can talk about it with someone like me with not a whit of attitude), light and airy room -- only drawback is it's not in my neighborhood.

I walked out feeling like, \"why open a business if you're going to be acerbic and confrontational to the customer?\" There's a rule in the theatre which I think can apply to life....\"always say YES.\" Even if you only have one type of Decaf roast, just remain open to a customer's question and say \"we can offer this bean today\" or \"this is what we have available.\" \nEven if you only serve double shots as a matter of course, just tell the customer \"yes\" when they ask for a double - it's bad form to immediately bark back at their order saying, \"we only serve double shots.\" \n\nThere is a way to include the customer in the experience of the coffee bar instead of insisting on keeping them at arm's length with explanations of what you can and cannot do for them.", "author": "Melody M."}

The drip coffee, which they pour individually, is excellent and they offer a changing menu of some of the finest roasted single-origin beans.  After going back a bunch of times for the strong-bodied coffees, I finally tried one of their excellent peasant pies and a scone.  Both were very satisfying pastries (one savory) and were complimented excellently by the beverages.  I have had the tea here as well and was very impressed with the presentation (a unique in-cup brew technique) and quality.\n\nIncidentally I spoke extensively with one of the baristas and he has a black-belt in espresso-making.\n\nThe best part is the people here are just so nice and easy-going, making all of the customers feel comfortable and relaxed.  To see other satisfied costumers just makes the experience that much better.  I will be a regular at this place, which, as has been noted, fills a void in this part of the city, and I would argue, in the entire city.\n\nOne notable perk here is the fresh flowers.  I challenge anyone to find a place that still does this.\n\nOne issue or potential issue:  dogs.  It is time that all SF establishments honored health codes by not allowing dogs into restaurants and cafes.

So here at Coffee Lab I got to try some different options and discovered how much I like Ethiopian Yirgacheffe.  \n\nSo just came in again today and thought I'd give their mocha a shot.  Now I'm a bit of a mocha snob, and I've only ever really liked the mocha at Cafe Trieste in North Beach.

And BOOM - it's a great mocha!  \n\nThey use Ghirardelli chocolate for their mochas, which is a big step down from Cafe Trieste's Guittard chocolate, but their eithiopian yirgacheffe was so awesome, and the chocoloate not too sweet, that made for a really delightful mocha.  \n\nBesides the coffee, great atmosphere, great internet, friendly baristas, and I even really liked the croissants.  \n\nSo definitely I'm planning to come here a lot more, and I highly recommend the coffee labs, which I think are every Saturday at noon.", "author": "Charles G."}

And it really destroys the mood on top of the fact that it's mostly a closed space. So I will say for TO GO, it is okay, but for sitting down, this is not my spot.", "author": "Fung S. O."}

I had heard about their Saturday Coffee Lab sessions from an AskMen e-mail blast earlier this month, and was excited to finally get a chance to go up and check them out. I wasn't disappointed!\n\nNathan, the boss of the joint, greeted me almost immediately from behind the bar. We got to talking and I settled on a Chai Latte, with his recommendation. They use a small brand Chai base from Oregon, with no sweetener added, and it didn't need it. Delicious.\n\nThe highlight of the trip was Coffee Lab, where I and a few other participants were given the change to experiment with Nathan, tapping in to his expertise to learn more about coffee. He took our feedback to heart throughout the process of creating a blend of three different coffees, and really helped me to understand why we were using which and how much of each coffee in it.\n\nI'll definitely be back for another Coffee Lab session soon, and I really hope that Contraband can thrive.

My friend liked her single macchiato, however, my triple with a splash of milk was SO bitter that it was undrinkable. Without hesitation, they made me another but it was equally bad. My friend agreed and we got into speculating why her single was so good, but my triple so horrible. I didn't bother to ask them to do it again because I was so put off by the bitter taste in my mouth. Bottom line, my friend loves the place (she's visually oriented and non-confrontational), however, I wouldn't go back except to watch her enjoy the place.

I've not had this  kind of goodness since living in Switzerland. So, I have been coming here for about eight months now: I've brought dates, applied to grad school and stayed probably far too long each time  (is it 1 drink per 2 hours?!) Yes, you need to pay a little more for good stuff but I've seen the staff giving free lessons/tutorials about coffee etc. so you can see all of the effort that goes in. You might make some new friends too, win.\n\nThe owner has taken great care in the ambiance: so much good music, that I think is chosen by each worker. He has rotating art shows on the walls; paintings are always unique and interesting. Ample seating, easy to use lap tops and it's really great to sit at the window and watch people walk by (like looking at the glass tank in the aquarium.) The owner is pretty much always in his shop, making sure everything runs smoothly.\n\nI like that he has staff that know how to make great coffee.  I don't like big chain coffee joints, I like to go to a place where \"everybody knows your name.\"  It's a nice touch when my drink has a special design on it, Starbucks doesn't give me that kind of lovin.\n\nFood selection has just changed recently. He's still got a selection of savory empanadas (my favorites are the sweet beef and mushroom gorgonzola) and Dynamo Donuts. Newest additions are the pear spice bread, rosemary oatmeal bread and a lavender shortbread cookie - all of which are excellent. \n\nI hope the owner of this shop wakes up in the morning and feels that he has accomplished something truly amazing.

The latte was really good, though, so no complaints on quality. Note for the newbies: they don't do \"sizes\" here, I guess it's just based on how many shots of espresso, etc. The staff were nice enough, definitely not a \"go out of your way to make you feel welcome\" type crowd, but also not totally unapproachable or snobby either. Came here on a crowded weekend morning, and there were barely any spots to sit at which had outlets, which is always annoying. So, overall, not a bad spot if you're just looking for a really good cup of coffee or espresso on the go, but probably not the best spot to sit and do work for a while (for that, check out Another Cafe, that's my go to study spot...wait, on second thought...please don't check it out, I don't want it to get too crowded...).", "author": "Jennifer M."}

In my opinion it beats Blue Bottle. It is like drinking a light chocolate - perfectly smooth, velvety bliss with all the nuances you could muster up to describe the complexities (I never knew you could describe coffee like an oenophile describes wine but now I know how this is possible). \nContraband is absolutely my new weekend coffee spot. Nothing will likely ding a star for the review because the coffee is so stunningly awesome, however it would be nice if service could be sped up a bit.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-19", "description": "Contraband is really good.  It is the first quality coffee shop I have been to in the neighborhood.  I used to always have to walk down to Blue Bottle in Mint Plaza to get coffee but not any more!  In fact, I enjoy Contraband more than Blue Bottle.  \n\nRight now I think I would rate my top three as:\n#1 Contraband\n#2 Four Barrel\n#3 Blue Bottle\n\nOf course Ritual Roasters belongs in the list also but I said top three so had to make a choice. \n\nI have had soy lattes/caps and drip coffee and they were all amazing.  I have also had several of the savory snacks they have and they were great also.   I have not tried using my laptop there yet so I cannot comment on that but I do see people in there using their computers regularly so it must be OK.\n\nI highly recommend Contraband.   As mentioned before it is still very new and so things may have been a bit bumpy right at first but the quality of the place is worth any of the minor hiccups I have witnessed due to being new.", "author": "James S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-05-14", "description": "Supremely disappointed with this shop, which has so much potential. Mainly, the barista with the mustache is rude. He doesn't greet customers when they enter the shop. He was unwilling to clarify for me what an item on the menu was, and when I pressed him, he was dismissive. He apparently always feels it necessary to inform me when the shop is closing (8:30), even though I arrive at 4:00pm (which translates to make sure you get out of here when I'm ready to leave). He also closes down drip coffees at 4:00, and he was out of all green teas (which is out of his control, I'm sure, but having to change my order multiple times because the vendor cannot accommodate for something on the menu is a terrible customer experience). All in all, this is a nice local shop with good coffees and convenient wifi, but I refuse to go back while this man works there because he makes the experience so unpleasant.", "author": "Stewart M."}

The inside was welcoming, nicely-lit and clean. And the staff takes their coffee to an almost fanatical-like plateau of gourmet worship. I chatted with the owner Josh, and he gave us some small free tastings of their Bali grown espresso- it tingled my toes and rought back my re-occuring heart murmur. Contraband definitley knows their stuff and I will be coming ASAP to see what else they will be brewing up for me on a bleary-eyed morning before work.
