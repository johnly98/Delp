I got a reservation a few weeks in advance (you must have a reservation to get in) and received an email detailing the process of getting in and what the password is, which added to the novelty and fun of the place.\n\nThe interior is cozy and dressed up to feel like you've transported back to the 20's in a real speakeasy.  One of my favorite decorative elements was the candle lamp by every table/bar seat.  It helped out a lot with reading the menu, but also added a really nice touch to the ambiance.  The bar isn't very large -- there were only two bartenders -- so it gave us the opportunity to talk with our bartender throughout the whole drink tasting.  \n\nI really liked how they segmented the cocktails menu into three sections to fit with their three pairing menu.  You can choose one from each to flow naturally into different types of cocktails or choose a different combination from each.  The menu was stylized as a detectives case, which we thought was a puzzle to lead to something else, but turns out was from the original building in which Wilson & Wilson is established.  We saw another couple being escorted to another bar, the Library, and our bartender offered to take us there after we finished, so we were able to experience another side of the place.  Overall, Wilson & Wilson is a fun experience with really delicious, unique drinks.", "author": "Kelsey P."}

Made our reservation the day before on Yelp and got our instructions and password to enter within minutes. \n\nPersonally I didn't think the location was too difficult to find but attached a photo for those who need help. You go in through Bourbon & Batch (please don't knock on W&W door it's not an entrance) you will be taken through the bar into a private room where a wall of whiskeys greet you. \n\nIt is quite dark as others have mentioned so if you have difficulties with seeing in low light maybe look elsewhere. Also this a cocktail only bar so don't come hungry. \n\nThe staff was fantastic; attentive, friendly and charismatic. Everyone we spoke to was just wonderful and willing to provide suggestions. \n\nMy absolute favorite cocktail was the Red Scarab - light and refreshing without being overly sweet. \n\nIt's important to note there are 3 bars attached as well as other private spaces - there is Bourbon & Batch that requires a separate reservation, Wilson & Wilson, and the library that you can enter at any time if you know passcode. \n\nThis is an intimate setting with lowered voices + no phones as part of the requirements - so don't be rude and break them as it totally adds to the atmosphere to be in the moment, enjoying the aromatics of the cocktails and whiskeys. \n\nI would highly recommend to whiskey lovers, speakeasy fans and to those who appreciate a beautifully crafted cocktail.

They are so enigmatic and full of charm and history. I've always wanted to check out Bourbon & Branch but never got the chance to until a couple of months ago. \n\nI tried to make a reservation at Bourbon and Branch but they were all booked. I later learned that they had another bar Wilson & Wilson inside Bourbon & Branch which would require a separate reservation. A speakeasy inside a speakeasy?!?! Seriously?!?! I was immediately sold! I guess not many ppl knew about it so I was able to score a reservation just a couple of days in advance. \n\nI got an email with a password and the establishment called to confirm before my visit. Damn! This already made me super excited before I even got there! \n\nOn the day of the reservation, my guest and I showed up after visiting another bar in the TL. This spot was kinda hard to find b/c it doesn't have a sign. It was and still is a speakeasy after all! We saw a gentleman standing outside and confirmed with him that we were on the guest list after giving him the password. We were then taken inside by a hostess into a very dark space. After entering many doors, we finally arrived at Wilson & Wilson. \n\nWow! It was like another secretive world! The atmosphere was swanky and intimate and took me back in the old days instantly. It certainly lives up to its private detective agency name. I was mesmerized and in love. \n\nThe cocktail menu was designed like a case file. We opted to order a la carte instead of doing the 3 course tasting. We both decided to try this coffee infused cocktail and were absolutely blown away. I mean I'm serious that IS the best cocktail I've ever had in my life. And my guest was wowed and said the same thing. \n\nBOTTOM-LINE: it doesn't matter if you live here in the bay or are just visiting, you MUST come to this spot if you haven't. You'll have a hell of a good time here like I did, I promise!", "author": "Angela F. W."}

In both cases, I was expected to study materials ahead of time and show up prepared. I was always a good student, but apparently I lost my \"work ethic\" since then.\n\nThis is a strict speakeasy bar but a whole lot of fun. You need to make reservations online, which isn't hard to do, then you wait outside until prompted for the password. You're taken through several doors as your eyes adjust to the darkness. Finally, you arrive in a small room in the back of the building.\n\nThere's candles on the counter to provide minimal light on the menus. Lots of options but the \"correct\" thing to do is order the three courses of cocktails. There's drinks for every taste pallette, and the bartender can help you decide. \n\nI ordered the following, all of which I'd recommend:\n\n* 3rd course - Deadline at Dawn\n* 2nd course - Maltese Falcon\n* 1st course - Murder My Sweet\n\nThe most unique and memorable aspect was having sesame oil in my Maltese Falcon cocktail. Wow! Makes you go, \"OooOoOohhhHh.\" Where I failed in coming to Wilson & Wilson was not reviewing the pre-visit email. Oops for missing the \"no phones\" rule, which the bartender was (rightly) not nice about reinforcing.\n\nAnyways I'd definitely love to come back here again.

Wilson & Wilson is a speakeasy inside of what's already an amazing speakeasy. W&W is much smaller, and therefore reservations are even more limited than they are at B&B. \n\nThe experience is a bit different. Whereas the outside of Bourbon & Bourbon is unmarked, Wilson & Wilson is masked as a private detective agency. Reservations are made separately if you want to go to both, but due to the smaller space and the more limited hours, W&W requires reservations much farther in advance. \n\nThe menu at W&W is more limited, but the drink selection is different than the selection at B&B. I fell in love with the menu because keeping with the theme, it looks like a case file. And of course, as expected, the drinks were all amazing and of the same caliber as B&B.

If you're a speakeasy type of lady or gent, you definitely need to try this place once. There are less than 30 seats inside the speakeasy, so a revservation is a must; unless you're really lucky that someone cancelled. \n\nHow to get into Wilson & Wlison? Well, W&W is located inside Bourbon & Branch. So, first, you need to knock on the door to let the host know that you are here for W&W. Once there is availability, he/she will take you into Bourbon & Branch and walk you all the way to the back close to the bathroom. Yes, another speakeasy next to the bathroom. The host will need to unlock the door to let you into Wilson & Wilson. The atmosphere is extremely exclusive and is extremely private. It has a Gatsby type of feel, so if you're into that type of vibe, you'll definitely love it here.\n\nAs for the drink list, well it is extremely over priced, but it also has many rare selections that you won't mind elsewhere. The mix cocktails here are hit and miss pending on what you order. However, they do make their drink stiff and with only 90 minute seating, one drink will definitely be enough before you hit to the next bar.\n\n\nTip: Make your reservation at least 1 week in advance.

Recently I've had several interactions with businesses and it's just like, \"the hell???\" As someone who worked in the service industry for a long time, I simply don't understand the inclination to double down when it's always easier to do the right thing.\n\nI was in town visiting my sister and she made a 10PM reservation at Wilson and Wilson. When two of her friends wanted to join us, she called and while they wouldn't be able to get us into W&W, the main bar would be able to seat us at 10:30PM. No problem there. \n\nWhen we arrived, we were told that the receptionist had made a mistake and our reservation was for 11:30PM. My sister received TWO calls from W&W confirming the 10:30PM seating time. What should have happened was the following: \"Ma'am I am so sorry for this mix up. Please go around the corner to the Library Bar where your first round of drinks is on us for the mistake.\" What happened instead was, \"I'm sorry but the receptionist doesn't know any better and you can either go next door or come back another time.\" WTF?! There are so many things wrong with that statement I don't even know where to begin.\n\nSo we go to the Library Bar, and luckily we're seated in Wilson and Wilson (yay!) just after 11PM. It is EMPTY aside from two couples at the bar. REALLY?! You make a big stink to us about reservations only to then seat us in essentially an empty bar. Whatever. #eyeroll\n\nSo apparently there's a no cell phone rule at this bar, which, frankly, who do you think you are? What a needlessly pretentious SF thing to do. I would understand and respect a no flash photography rule, because the space is quite small. But if you are going to enforce a no cell phone rule, the least you could do is have prompt service. We waited over 20 minutes for the bartender to come to our table and then another 15 minutes for our drinks to be prepared. In a bar with only 4 other people. We actually had to get up and ask the bartender if he'd be coming to our table to take our order and then he was rude about it!\n\nSo while we waited 8 years for our order to be taken and drinks to be made, of course we were sharing photos on our phones with each other (I recently worked on a home renovation project) which was met with side eye.

When I made the reservation the confirmation was emailed to me. This confirmation is important and will give you needed information to a nondescript door where your journey begins.

My first instinct was: a speakeasy inside a speakeasy, it must be even cooler than just a speakeasy, right?? It's like having a secret... about a secret...  No? Okay..\n\nThere was a separate password to get inside Wilson & Wilson. You only need one password, not two (you just need the password for Wilson & Wilson.) Entering from the same door on Jones St, there was another door at the end of the hall inside Bourbon & Branch, opened only by its key. This door opens into yet another small, intimate space... This time with a large frosted window that allows some light from the outside world to cast inside. On this window, it reads \"Wilson & Wilson detective agency\" -- clever, a secret bar disguised as a detective agency! No one will ever suspect it... \n\nMenus here are disguised as dossiers, adding to the theme. Only one bartender serviced this area, but he was adept and efficient with his bar-tending. Not sacrificing personable-ness, he chatted with patrons here and there while making the drinks. I was set on ordering the 3 course \"liquid-dinner\", but had already gone to Tradition and Bourbon & Branch prior to coming here, so we split the 3-course, add 1 whisky for our time there.\n\nWilson & Wilson is slightly more cramped, no booths here, only tall tables with two tall chairs facing each other... Personally I thought was really odd that they only gave us 1 menu, it was hard enough reading in the dark... Let alone reading *upside down* in the dark! Eventually we asked to move to two open seats at the bar, to which they allowed.\n\nI liked Wilson & Wilson.

It's kinda ridiculous.\n\nWe were early for our time slot so we kinda just wandered around until it was time. Spoke to the doorman, gave him our password and we were in. The doors are kinda confusing, we almost tried to knock on the door outside of the Wilson window, but the doorman called us back over to where he was. Someone inside Bourbon will let you in, walk you through Bourbon and sit you down over at the Wilson side. Definitely a lot quieter over here.

The Pinkerton on the hand was both strong and delicious. It tasted pretty much all of bourbon, which was perfect! \n\nFast and friendly service.

This place is huge--I was told Bourbon and Branch expanded the room we were seated in like 6 years ago. I'm not a huge fan of the \"provide a password, we're exclusive\" concept, but after dealing with it in NYC all those years ago, I just accept it at this point. You are led through a very cavernous walk until we got to our final destination. It was a little warm inside (also warm outside too), but spacious. The theme is of a detective agency, so the attire of the staff and the menu is very old-time Jack Nicholson in Chinatown\"-esque. I wish all the chairs had that bar across the bottom though--if your legs are too short (as my wife mentioned--some of the seats don't have that resting bar) your feet are left to dangle, and you're forced to try to sit them on the bar that runs along the bottom of the wood bar itself. The drinks were good (I had one with rye and egg white which was solid) but man, the bartenders work hard in here. There appears to be no designated server/barback, so the bartenders are forced to bus the bar and the tables, take orders, deliver drinks, and of course, make drinks for the people sitting at the bar. Wonder why there's not a few more designated staff to assist them? I saw a barback at least once there, but he wasn't there the whole time like most establishments. Maybe they were just short staffed that night, I don't know. I think they got a little backed up from having to wear like 4 hats. My only grievance is that our bartender seemed to be hosting a lot of people that night--two inside when I got there, and then was working on getting at least 2 more inside later on. It was ok when I got there, but seemed to cause more delays with service as the night wore on. She was chatting with her second group more than attending to the front in the second half of my visit, so when I wanted another drink, there was a reasonable delay in placing my order. I get it, your friends are there and there's a lull in the action so you have some time to catch up--but after around 5 minutes or so, it seems a tad excessive. When she was in front, she was attentive, but I think if they can provide the bartenders a little more relief, they'll be able to focus more on the task at hand rather than having to do it all by themselves.", "author": "Dan M."}

What better place than Wilson & Wilson to have our late celebration? It was on Friday, April 10th. A couple weeks before, we couldn't find a reservation for a big group. However, three of us managed to make reservations for two each at 6pm. Altogether we had six seats.\n\nOur email confirmations stated they would only hold our spots for 15 minutes. Or course, we had a lagger in our group. Luckily, as long as he knew the password, we could go in without him. We all ended up sitting at the bar.\n\nInvestigative cocktails:\n*Pinkerton: knob creek bourbon, coffee syrup, cranberry infused angostura orange bitters, angostura bitters, tobacco bourbon tincture, orange peel\n*Truth serum: highland park 12, amaro nonino, brown sugar cinnamon syrup, sarsaparilla aromatic bitters, licorice root tincture\n\nStarted out with one cocktail since that was the bday boy's choice. Got the Pinkerton. It's a good starter cocktail. Reminiscent of an old fashioned. I didn't try the Truth serum, but it looked like my kind of drink.\n\n*Aberlour 18 year, abv 43% ($20): vanilla ice cream, stone fruits, honey, heather, apples, oranges, sherry\n*Dalwhinnie 1995, distiller's edition, abv 46% ($30): pear juice, cocoa, espresso, hops, dates, walnuts, chocolate milk, honeydew\n*Auchentoshan three wood, abv 43% ($16): peanut brittle, vanilla wafer, almonds, butterscotch, sweet roasted nuts, flowers\n*Gordon and macphail, old pulteney 21 year, abv 43% ($42): dried apricots, vanilla, peach, barley sugar, honey roasted nuts, milk chocolate, brine\n\nThe rest of the night involved pours of scotch and whisky. I really enjoyed the Aberlour. I could taste the notes of fruit, vanilla and honey. The middle two pours involved some guessing and blind picking. Their menu is huge and I'm in no way a connoisseur, so we decided to be adventurous. I don't remember much about the flavors as I think my palette was a little overwhelmed at that point. I do remember liking that last pour of Old Putney. But who doesn't love a 21 year?\n\nOur bartender was great! He knew we were there to have fun and didn't seem annoyed that we were randomly picking drinks to order. I do love that he left the bottle for us to look at. It makes for a great pic and I love reading the actual bottles.\n\nThe rest of our group got the tasting, which involves a 3 course drink menu. If I ever come back, I may try that next time. Looked like a great way to try what Wilson & Wilson has to offer.\n\nI loved the vibe of the place. Laid back, but not in the dark speakeasy kind of way. Wilson & Wilson is brighter and really does feel like you're in an exclusive bar. They only had one table that looked like a four-six top and two tops along the wall. Other then that, there's seating at the long bar.\n\nFun, light and laid back.", "author": "Elena N."}

I've been wanting to try out a speakeasy bar in SF for quite sometime but I don't live in town.  Fortunately a friend was visiting which gave the perfect excuse.  She picked Wilson & Wilson and we locked in reservations for 9:30pm on a Thursday night.  Confusion started upon arrival. We got the email and the call for where the place was and our password for entry.  Getting to the building there are 3 doors on the Jones street side and one with a bouncer on the O'Farrell side.  told us that the reservation locations in the building enter on Jones.  So we try the door knocker closest to the Wilson & Wilson window.  No answer.  Wait, try again, no answer.  Try the knocker on the next door down.  Same reason (keep in mind, this is door hardware knockers, not me just pounding on a door for the fun of it.  Finally we try the one door that had a door buzzer which I had assumed was for Bourbon & Branch but guess not since that was the only one to answer.  Password was brushed off, they didn't care about that. They just wanted reservation name and IDs.  So much for the speakeasy atmosphere.  Leading us into the bar and around the corner to the internal entrance to Wilson & Wilson had no mystique at all.  only difference from any reserved table at any other venue was needing to unlock the door that led into Wilson & Wilson.\n\nWe were offered our choice of bar seating or a high top for two, we opted for the latter. After going through the menu some, the waitress came by the email the concept.  Except we couldn't really hear here over the noise of the people around us.  Bless her heart but she did go to each table and tried to ask them to speak a bit softer.  Didn't last once she walked away.  Oh well, the menu was interesting with flavor combinations I've never seen before.  We both opted for a 3 drink tasting, going from Aperitif to a Main to a digestif.  It actually was the perfect way to do it with the progression in the styles of the drink from citrus forward to deeper flavors then a citrus absent one.  And the drinks were all very good.  I would come there just for the drinks.\n\nUnfortunately I wish the drinks were available elsewhere.  I went ready for the novelty fun of a speakeasy. Even the rules I read before hand would support that... but the staff didn't seem interested in trying to explain to people the rules or police them.  Tables of people speaking loudly and all with their cell phones out ruined the speakasy vibe.  It was so loud you couldn't hear the music till half the bar cleared out closer to 11pm.  Its a shame.  If you're going to do a fun shtick like speakeasy, then do it.  but ignoring people with their phones out or how you progressively have to shout to be hard in a place thats supposed to be under the radar ruined the experience.   I'd go again if it was only half full of people so quieter.  But they might as well let the cell phone rule go if they aren't interested in enforcing it for the benefit of all the guest's ambiance.", "author": "David M."}

I like to think of Wilson & Wilson as my first prohibition/speakeasy cocktail experience and at first sip, I fell head over heels in love...\n\nLocated inside of Bourbon & Branch, W&W and is a speakeasy inside of a speakeasy. The hostess walks you into B&B and through another secret door into a dimly lit narrow bar that oozes with secrecy, mystery, and intimacy. With the velvet walls, exposed brick, and gold foil ceiling tiles, this is a great date spot. There are probably 4 2 person high tables, 8 spots at the bar and then a single table for 4. So make sure you plan in advance and grab a reservation. These slots are for fixed times and a perfect amount to do the 3 course drink menu. Or, you could just sit with a buddy and sip on a fantastic selection of whiskey and bourbon. In fact, the whole wall behind the bar are shelves of uniformly placed bottles that are back lit against a bare brick wall. \n\nThe whole theme of the place is like a detective agency so the menu comes with an introduction and is a case file that you can flip through for various drinks. The 3-course menu is designed to mimic a dinner course and the heaviness and flavors in each course tend to reflect your starter, main course, and dessert. These cocktails are interesting, unique, complex, and strong. Within each course they do provide both strong&boozy and the light&citrusy options for whatever you're feeling. The drinks themselves aren't priced differently from you standard cocktail in Bourbon & Branch, but they're crafted and tailored for the menu.\n\nIn a nutshell, this place is fantastic.

Apparently, it's hard to get in, so I had previously reserved a table.  This bar is located inside of another bar; Bourbon & Branch.  With the reservation, they give you a password you must say before being let into the bar.  Ours was \"ANGELUS.\"  The hostess then led us through Bourbon & Branch to a back room where Wilson & Wilson was located and sat us at our table.  I liked that Wilson & Wilson was quite private and a chill atmosphere.  There was soft music playing (not too loud), so you can definitely get into some interesting conversations here.\n\nThe waiter came to our table and explained the entire menu, which was quite unique and composed of 14 specific cocktails ($13 each), amongst other drinks.  In the cocktail section, there was a list of 5 cocktails for the Ap\u00e9ritif, 5 cocktails for the Mains, and 4 cocktails for the Digestif.  If you wanted a full \"3-course cocktail meal,\" it would cost $35.  I am not a strong or heavy drinker, but I went with the full 3-drinks!\n\nOff the Ap\u00e9ritif menu, I ordered the Night Gardner which was composed of St. George Pear Brandy, Dubonnet, Lemon Juice, Rose Syrup, Star Anise and Vanilla Almond Tincture, and Egg White.  This was the best cocktail.  It was so refreshing and cold, and I loved the way it tasted.  Off the Mains menu, I went with the Miamy Blues which was composed of Ancho Chili Infused Denizen, Coconut Cream, Cane Syrup, Lime Juice, Lapsang Souchong and Toasted Coconut Tincture, and Banana.  This one was also quite delicious and tasted actually spicy!\n\nFinally, off the Digestif menu, I went with the Forgotten Man.  This one was composed of Mount Gay Black Barrel Rum, Madeira, Stout Syrup, Cardamom Tincture, and Cinnamon Infused Laphroaig.  This was sweet tasting, and a nice drink to chill and end the night.  Overall, these were the most amazing cocktails, and I highly recommend coming here!\n\nWhat I ordered:\n-Ap\u00e9ritif Menu: Night Gardner\n-Mains Menu: Miamy Blues\n-Digestif Menu: Forgotten Man\n\nPros:\n-Best cocktails I've ever had in my entire life and worth the price of $13 each (or offered as a course of 3 drinks for $35)\n\nCons:\n-Bathroom door lock doesn't work, so somebody can walk in on you doing your business quite easily", "author": "Justin A."}

I have previously tried to get a reservation last year with another group of friends and it is pretty much impossible to get a spot like a week before, so do plan like 3 weeks ahead if you want to visit this part of the bar. Located by the corner of Jones and O'Farrell St, this place is pretty discreet as the W&W entrance is locked and dark. There will be a guy by the corner guarding a door and that's the person you would talk to. Tell him the password and boom! You're in.\n\nGoing past the Burbon and Branch, if you go to the right, there would be a secret door where that is the actual entrance to W&W. The bar is small and intimate with a very limited amount of people being in there. There was 2 bartenders and they bring the drinks to you which makes you feel like you have a personal bartender. They have this deal where you can order 3 different of cocktails for $35 which is well worth it because it gives you a chance to try out the different cocktails they can make, to which I have no complaints on my drinks, all of them were delicious and went down smoothly. \n\nDrinks are excellent, bartenders are awesome, the space is great! So why the 4 stars? Well, I know this may not be a big deal for some people but for me it kinda did, and that, is the music in the background. Music to me lays out the environment/vibe of the place so when I heard of W&W: Private Investigations, the first thing that comes in my mind is like a film noir style music, like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwvVhXItl1w\nWhat I heard throughout my 2 hour visit was more of a folk-style type of music, which in my mind, didn't really match to the theme of the bar. Besides that, everything else such as the menu being in an old school file folder and the bar itself, matches with the theme and time that they were trying to depict. \n\nOverall, no doubt, I'm a big fan of this place. The service, the quality of the drinks, the amount of people allowed in, the theme of the bar, it's all excellent. I would come back to this place and would recommend this place to anyone who would want to take someone special or being with close friends. The only fix I would make is the music that they play for it to be perfect but that could be minor for some people.", "author": "Tito G."}

You have to make a reservation online and it'll likely be two weeks out.

As we move to the \"main\" and digestif, the cocktail choices are stronger. This three cocktail option is $30 and not shareable. Otherwise, it's $12 a cocktail.

Upon arrival after making a reservation, you ring a doorbell & someone comes out to ask for the password given to you by email. We are then escorted in through the darkness of B&B to a small cocktail bar which is Wilson & Wilson. My wife and I are sat at a couple seats at the bar which are metal & a bit unstable. \n\nAfter being sat, you are given a list of set cocktails & selection of whiskeys you can order straight up or on the rocks. There was only one bartender/mixologist working behind the bar for the whole area so we didn't know the format of ordering the cocktails. Then all of a sudden, a guy appears who looks to be the bar back & wreaking of smoke like he had just come from a hotbox of cigarettes. He tries to explain that the cocktails are \"flights\" that are to be ordered like a meal. The thing is, I wasn't into wanting to order 3 cocktails that looked to be on the sweeter side. I only wanted to try 1 cocktail and then order a whiskey straight up after that. He didn't seem to explain this right and told me I had to order 3 cocktails or nothing. When the bartender came by, he clarified that we could order just one cocktail if we wanted & didn't need to order the required 3 we were told.\n\nI ordered a refereshing cocktail with sparkling wine & grapefruit because I just wanted something fresh to start my evening of drinking. It was just okay as it tasted more like a mimosa with grapefruit juice & topped with champagne.\n\nThey do have a pretty amazing whiskey selection & my taste usually gravitates to bourbon but I saw that they had a stellar Yamazaki 18 year on the list and decided to get a pour of that. Fantastic.\n\nIf it wasn't for the ash tray smell I got from the bar back and the disappointment in the cocktail I ordered, an additional star may have been earned.", "author": "Mike G."}

We were about 10-15 minutes late due to bridge traffic and catching BART at the last second (easy walking distance from the Powell station), but that time was lost in our allotted 1.5 hour reservation. If anything, that'd be my only complaint is that you are not given a significant amount to time to linger and go slow, but I'm sure it's due to the fact that the capacity of this space is 40 people, it's reservation only and possibly to control over drinking (they do not serve food and they pour heavy, so come prepared). They will, however, allow you to take your drink into the library if you're not finished, but are strict about ending on time.\n\nThe atmosphere, secret passwords and passageways, \"house rules\", and the bartenders were all amazing. Our server was extremely knowledgeable, not only about the drinks, but about the history of the building and that room, specifically, as well. We didn't feel comfortable attempting the flight with amount of time we had left, but were able to order two cocktails each. We managed to order differently each time, allowing us to try others and share, and every single one was delicious and well crafted. Beautifully balanced, creative and allowed us to go outside of our comfort zone to try something new. The menu, for that matter, is set up nicely, moving from creations that are lighter and easier to drink, to more full body, powerful and flavorful - they will recommend that you move through apertif to digestif in order to fully appreciate the complexity of the drinks and build upon the flavors. \n\nAgain, this place was so much fun and has a wonderful vibe.

Some of the more popular bar times were taken, but I think as long as you plan a day or two in advance, it isn't too hard to get some prime time here.\n\nAnyways, like many have described, this is a speakeasy inside a speakeasy. So cool, much wow. Actually, it was a little less cool than I actually imagined, but still pretty nice to give a password and pretend that I was going into something that was super exclusive. Wilson and Wilson does have its own door, but we entered through B&B. They take you through the bar and then to a side door that's at the back of the bar area. That door then takes you into what is Wilson and Wilson Detective Agency.\n\nThe menu looks like case files from a detective cases. Cool stuff. The front half is the actual menu and the back half is random clippings that suit the atmosphere of the place. Conceptually, they have three \"levels\" of drinks. Starts with apertifs and then becomes progressively boozier. You can also get a flight for $30 which is actually probably a better deal especially given that we got two drinks each separately which came out to be around $30ish anyways. \n\nI started with the Amoral Drifter and then got the Charlie Chan. Both are awesome and I'd highly recommend. Because so much goes into the crafting of the drink here, they don't take custom requests. But honestly, even if you're a wimp like me and don't like super alcohol tasting drinks, these drinks are DELICIOUS. You can taste the alcohol but it's just subtle enough that the flavors from everything else are much stronger. \n\nAtmosphere here is chill and great. It's not too loud, definitely on the intimate side. The bartenders are all pretty friendly and service is nonintrusive yet attentive. Right when we finished our drink, they perfectly timed offering the next drink which was great. But yeah, awesome vibe. \n\ntldr; super awesome speakeasy with delicious drinks.

I just had one of the three most outstanding cocktails of my life at Wilson & Wilson this past Saturday night.  But I'll tell you about it after I provide a little more background on the menu.  The cocktail menu is divided into apertifs, mains, and digestifs.  You can get a 3-course liquid meal for $30 or order cocktails individually for $12 each (no sharing the prix fixe allowed).  The apertifs are the least boozy, the digestifs most.  Each category has about 5-6 drinks to select from.  There are only 2 bartenders and you get their full attention, and the service is excellent.  I learned that apparently every drink on their menu has at least 3 house-made ingredients!\n\nSo finally onto the highlight of the evening, the Forgotten Man.  We most certainly almost missed it since it was alone on the last page of the cocktail menu.  In the digestif category, it was composed of rum, cinnamon infused Laphroaig, stout syrup, and at least another ingredient, and was served on 3-4 ice cubes.   What made this cocktail so memorable is the intensity of the cinnamon spice, both in the nose and on your palate!  It annoys me when I order a drink and can't taste the spice or herb advertised on the menu, and I love that I don't need to worry about that at Wilson & Wilson!  I need to make another reservation just to enjoy this drink again, though I'm inclined to ask for it on a large rock or served down next time so it doesn't get diluted as much.\n\nWhile I'm on the topic of digestifs, we also tried the Pinkerton.  Oddly enough, the Pinkerton didn't taste very unique, more like a standard rye old fashioned (and served on a large rock).  But then you remember it's made with bourbon and multiple types of bitters which removes the sweetness and gives it a bitter bite, and you're mind is blown.  We also had the Farwell My Lady, made with tequila, smoky mezcal, a spicy tincture, sherry, pumpkin, served in a coupe.  The sherry was prominent but the pumpkin added a very unique finish.\n\nI only tried one Main, of which I've forgotten the name.  But it was composed of tea infused vodka, coffee liqueur, cardamom, coconut, cranberry, served up.  It was kind of funky smelling and upon initial taste kind of sweet, but it had this fascinating complexity I just couldn't pinpoint so it grew on me with each sip.\n\nOverall a most excellent experience that has convinced me I need to frequent W&W and B&B more, even if it means planning my drinking adventures a month in advance.  And even if they charge that obnoxious SF Healthy tax.  I cannot wait to return!", "author": "Beatrice W."}

I won't give away spoilers about the experience since its best experienced first hand but the bar is located on a unmarked block with one door with a guard and bell. You ring the bell and a person comes out asking for a password. He walks in, confirms your name and reservation and you're in Bourbon and Branch.

Both Bourbon and Branch and Wilson & Wilson have the best drinks in SF. If you're into craft cocktails, like me, I highly recommend getting the 3 course \"meal\" which contains an appetizer light drink, the heavy hitter \"entree\" and a digestif at the end. I must note that none of the drinks are \"light\" and by the time we were done, we were walking crooked. Also, if you're looking for your favorite drink, they don't make any drinks out of the menu.\n\nIf I had to complain about one thing, I was trying to get reservations for Bourbon and Branch and ended up instead getting them for Wilson & Wilson (which is supposed to be the more exclusive bar) but when we got there, the password I was given in my confirmation email and my name was not on the list.

We arrived a little early so we couldn't go right into Wilson and Wilson. We were directed to wait in \"The Library\" which is another speakeasy bar that offers a lot of old time drinks with a great environment. Once our table was ready, the hostess leads us through a bookshelf in the wall, through another speakeasy and into the back where Wilson and Wilson is located. This is the only original speakeasy left in San Fran, that's what the door man told us as we were waiting to get in. \n\nEveryone we encountered was beyond friendly and nice. Our main bartender in Wilson and Wilson was an amazing \"mixologist\". I simply told him I enjoy, berries, sweet not sour, champagne and vodka style drinks and he went to work. I loved everything he gave me! He joked around a lot with us too, so fun! He told me to stop drinking vodka because your alcohol should \"enhance\" the drink and not be tasteless. I told him I love tasteless alcohol. Haha!! My husband was much more open and just wanted to enjoy any and everything! They offer \"flights\" which are three drinks for a set price, I believe $35. Individual drinks are $13 each. Either way, for the atmosphere, drink quality and staff I would gladly pay twice that amount!! There is a private one stall bathroom in Wilson and Wilson and an exit that leads to the street. \n\nI recommend everyone come check out and enjoy this place.

The birthday boy wasn't drunk, but had simply opened the wrong door initially (not knowing where the library bar was). The doorman overreacted, was incredibly argumentative and condescending, not to mention humiliated my friend in front of strangers for no reason. He was irrational and immature.

Reservations are required, and when going inside, you look for a corner with no sign, a bouncer, maybe a few people outside, and dark colored walls and doors. I know, it sounds sketchy, but that's how a speakeasy is. Reservations give you a password, which you tell the bouncer to get in, and inside, someone leads you to Wilson and Wilson.

He really focused on trying to find the perfect cocktail for each customer and knew every detail about every drink. I definitely plan to make reservations and come back because it is classy, delicious, bougie, and one of the best bars I have ever been to.", "author": "Annie C."}

We were pleasantly surprised to learn that a great one was just a block from our hotel. Wilson & Wilson is a detective themed bar located inside a larger speakeasy, Bourbon & Branch. They send you a password after you make a reservation and you must be there on time. If you are 15 minutes late, they give your table to someone else. Upon arrival, you'll push a button near an intercom and will be escorted inside to Wilson & Wilson. Once you're in, you'll notice it is very dark and the only lights on the bar are oil lanterns. You'll be presented with a menu of the most creative cocktails you've ever seen. Don't try to imagine how they will taste just go with whatever sounds fun/interesting. The bartenders are very helpful and can guide your tastes if you have certain preferences. We really enjoyed the Charlie Chan and Asphalt Jungle. It's a great way to spend an hour and a half and runs about $35 per person for a 3 flight tasting menu. Put your phone away, lower your voice, respect the vibe, and you'll be rewarded with a unique experience.", "author": "Heath H."}

Our bartender explained the details of how they came up with the drinks, what they had tried and hadn't worked, and took time to just describe some of the ingredients we had questions about and how those were made.\n\nAnd the cocktails were BRILLIANT. I love cocktails, and without question these were the best I've had. They have something like 5 flavors each, including spritzes here and drops there, and the balance is perfect. Every cocktail I tried was a flavor combination I'd never have thought of (usually a core of 3-4 flavors you'd expect and 1-2 wacky additions), and they worked.\n\nUsually, I like a place that's a bit more lively, but the cocktails and experience were so excellent here, we'll be coming back for sure.", "author": "Adam W."}

In order to get into Wilson and Wilson, you first need to know the password for the other speakeasy, Bourbon and Branch.

The menu seems never-ending with so many types of bourbons and whiskies.  \n\nI tried the Buffalo Trace 6 year experimental Zinfandel ($80 a pop) just for fun, and it really was worth every cent... three friends and I also Easter the tasting menu... For about $30, you get three drinks, starting with an appertif and ending with a digestif.  While I enjoyed each of mine, some in my party did not enjoy their drinks. One was tobacco infused (I cannot recall the name), which ultimately just didn't sit well with my friend.  So luckily for me, I got an additional cocktail ;-)\n\nAs a New Yorker, I really enjoyed these types of places. It's a way for people to escape, and taste a variety of interesting drinks.

My friend and I had originally wanted to go to Bourbon & Branch, but were redirected to this sister location when we weren't able to get a reservation even though it was 2 weeks in advance. \n\nIf you're tired of the same old bar scene, come visit this detective agency themed speakeasy that makes you feel like you've stepped back in time to the prohibition era. First of all, the entrance is an unmarked wooden door along a dark building with boarded windows underneath a sign on the corner of Jones that says \"Anti-Saloon League\". It can be hard to find, but you'll probably find groups of random people waiting outside the door giving it away. \n\nRing the bell and give the person your password (from the reservation) to gain access. Secret entrance and password? Doesn't get much cooler than that. \n\nYou then take a dim but romantically candle-lit stumble though Bourbon & Branch and past several locked doors to a smaller bar area. After being seated at the bar in one of the most uncomfortable and wobbly high chairs ever, we were given a mock detective case file with a story and an extensive menu leaning heavily on bourbon, scotch and gin drinks. \n\nCocktails are an average of $10-12. We went with the 3 drink flight for $30, in which you pick one drink from each category, getting stronger as you go. Most of the cocktails had a long list of ingredients I didn't recognize and too complex in flavors to really know what the heck I was drinking, much less describe on Yelp! \n\nAPERITIF(light and refreshing):\nI had the Black Mask and Red scarab, which was fruity and the favorite of the night. If I were to come back I'd probably choose all my drinks from this section. \n\nMAIN (like the main course of a meal):\nWe tried the Charlie Chan and Fu Manchu. The Charlie Chan was supposed to have black tea infused vodka, coconut marmalade, black pepper and clove tinctures, and ginger syrup. Sounds pretty good, right? What I got tasted like none of those things and was completely inscrutable. Fu Manchu had the same story but was probably the winner in this category. It had gin, grapefruit juice, 5 spice syrup, puerh tincture, egg white, and vanilla angostura bitters. (umm what...?)\n\nDIGESTIFS (heavy on the liquor):\nWe ordered the Hard Boiled (seemed like the most fruity with apple brandy and orange bitters) and Pinkerton (keywords I saw were coffee, cranberry, and orange). Both were pretty difficult to finish because of how much liquor was in it and it was extremely bitter. Also did not taste anything like what the ingredients listed. \n\nThe place is small with only one bathroom so it's really only good for couples and small groups. But I think you can rent a secret room in this establishment for really large parties. ;)\n\nBefore your vision gets blurry and the night gets hazy, notice the window scene that has shadows of people and car lights passing by (even though you already know that window is boarded on the other side). I love the decor of the place!\n\nFinish the evening by visiting The Library, which is essentially a louder, more crowded part of the bar with a separate drink menu.

At The Wilson, take those methods and add a bit of mad scientist to it. The levels of complexity in the drinks have definitely been spiked up and the creativity behind the combinations are excellent. However I warn you, this isn't for everyone nor is it for you if you're not in the right mood. These are libations with a certain tone so you must be open to the experimentation.

Wilson & Wilson is normally a reservation only type establishment, similar to our own phenomenal Columbia Room back in DC, so to have the ability to pop in and out for drinks here is extra unique and highly recommended for anyone who hasn't visited yet but has wanted to. Like the other rooms, they did offer a list of pre-determined libations for you to choose from, but they also continued to make single drinks by order to suit each customer if you wanted something more original. I've got to say, the bar performance by these bartenders, on one of the busiest nights of the year, to make the quality of drinks they did for me was really unlike any other skilled bartending exhibition I've witnessed. These guys are top notch at their game and I can only imagine how superb the drinks would be if you had their sole attention.\n\nThere was a definite 70's \"Blaxploitation\" movie vibe in this room, with drinks like Booty Collins and Super Freak (both of which Suzy ordered and enjoyed), and bartenders sporting chops and afros. It was upbeat, lively, and definitely featured a bit of lascivious behavior that probably wouldn't normally go down here. It was all in good taste though and I think everyone really had a blast, even if they only popped in for a few seconds to see what was going on.\n\nFor my drinks I went in a slightly different direction, and the quality was never unwavering throughout. My first inspiration was the bottle of Old Raj I spotted, a favorite of a friend of mine and one I never turn down when at a bar like this. It makes an excellent first drink of the evening, and the Turf (Old Raj, dry vermouth, Meyer lemon, maraschino liqueur, orange bitters, absinthe) that I was presented was exactly the kind of vibrant, refreshing drink I had in mind to start the evening. After spotting their array of homemade bitters and syrups I knew I wanted my next drink to feature their chocolate stout syrup, and the concoction featuring Wild Turkey 101, lemon, chocolate stout syrup, Gran Classico, cinnamon orange bitters, and Angostura bitters was rich, complex, and did a great job of showing off the syrup itself while giving it an appropriate platform to shine on. I wanted something with a bit more heat on it next, as we had just turned the clock past midnight, and was given a drink of Cognac, Green Chartruese, sweet vermouth, cinnamon orange bitters, which hit the spot with a nice fire in my belly from the Cognac. Of all the drinks it was probably the most \"simple\", although that description really wouldn't do it justice. I finished off the night with an Old Cuban (solera aged rum, lime juice, prosecco, simple syrup, mint), the perfect ending to a night of fascinating drinks and entertainment.\n\nObviously, a regular night here is a vast departure from the wild night you'll get on New Year's Eve, but there's one thing you're guaranteed to find and that's a damn well made drink. In terms of quality of composition, this would fall somewhere between #2 and #3 on my list of all-time bars, and might be #1 if I were able to get here on a regular night. Wilson & Wilson gets my highest level of recommendation.", "author": "Justin C."}

You can get the total experience, walking through B&B to your small table, where you can see the window with the ginormous sign on it.  From that, to the crazy wallpaper, exposed brick wall and awesome crafted bar, it's really fun to sit in and have a drink with someone (I would highly suggest as a first date or to take someone who's visiting for the weekend).\n\nAs for the drinks themselves, I love that you can get a tasting of 3 for $30.  Strangers on a Train (fruity, sugary), Farewell My Lovely (a little watery for a spicy drink), were original choices, but I'd love to probably just drink a glass of whiskey since the drinks were either too sugary or missing the mark.  Either way, the atmosphere makes this place. Do it.", "author": "Reyana F."}

My mancat doesn't do very well with surprises and this catbitch was like oh hellllll no i'm going to surprise the crap out of him! \n\nSo I booked a reservation for 2 for 6pm on a friday a week in advance and only told him the password, which after a quick google search, I knew was not linked to the bar or anything else in SF, so he'd be royally confused. \n\nFriday comes, we walk to the \"secret location\" and end up at B&B. \"Um.. how is this a surprise, we've been here several times.\" \n\n\"...

We were so excited to come here, and were craving excellent, balanced cocktails, just as all the reviews praised the mixology skills here. I love the concept of 3 separate bars within one establishment, there was definitely an air of excitement with all the people in B&B waiting to be seated for their reservations in their respective bars. \n\nOur reservation was at 6p, and they were late to open, which cut into out 1.5 hour time limit, which they were not apologetic for at all, and still made sure we knew we had to get out soon. Fine, I don't even mind as much because we had a busy night planned anyway. But I was incredibly disappointed with the cocktails!! \n\nThe four of us each got a different drink each time so we can each try each other's, so it's not like I had a limited sampling. I don't know if it's because I was just coming from New Orleans where the drinks are perfection, but these at W&W were WAY too sweet, and not balanced. The drinks from the first two menus, the Aperitif, Main, I made an involuntary puckered sweet face with each sip (couldn't come close to finishing them), and the drinks from the Digestif were not balanced. None of the drinks were on point. The Aperitif I got tasted like the frat house specialty jungle juice (typically concocted in a garbage bin lined with plastic, and had a super bright color). \n\nIf cocktails are their main draw, I think they should reconsider their menu and go over it w a top tier mixologist. Taste the drinks before serving them! I couldn't even finish my 3 drinks. I kind of felt like it was \"wham, bam, thank you m'aam\"...we were there for 60 mins, rushed to guzzle saccharin drinks, and were then slapped w a high bill and asked to leave. \n\nI really wanted to love this place.", "author": "Jackie W."}

The answer's not a definite yes, but a maybe. \n\nI made a reservation almost exactly a month ago to make sure to get in. The password didn't really live up to the hype -- it was the same for everyone that day! Another party of two and we laughed about it. \n\nThe interior: there is an area where there are tables for four and then, there is an area with a bar and tables for two. The ambience is -- well, think \"The Great Gatsby.\" Lively jazz is playing in the background, and the place is pretty dark with a little candle on the table. It's quite romantic, really. \n\nThe menu was extensive, and had three parts. The first part was for fruity and light drinks - think a lot of sparkling wine and fruit juice. The next part was a little more daring but still pretty fruity. The last part was \"very alcoholic\"; the alcohol in the cocktail dominates the flavor, according to the very friendly bartender taking our order. \n\nI tried two cocktails from the second part. One was a twist on pisco sour, and tasted as it should. The other one was more experimental: it had chocolate flavors and heavy cream together with rye - a combination you could not quite imagine how it'd taste. And of course, Wilson & Wilson pulled it off! \n\nMy friend ordered two cocktails from the first part. One was your generic grapefruit-flavored cocktail with a lot of sparkling wine.....until you smell sesame oil! She just kept on smelling the cocktail, tasting the cocktail, and looking puzzled. It somehow works! I didn't taste the other one, but my friend was satisfied. \n\nI didn't think it was worth a month's wait, honestly. Bourbon & Branch just right next door does an honest-to-God great job, and it was practically empty when I got there on a Thursday night. But the menu is definitely very unique and the ambience has this almost smug feeling of exclusivity to it (or is it intimacy that I am mistaking for something else) that makes you feel special for just 1.5 hours. Haha, maybe that's what this place is going for. \n\nWhile you are in SF, this is a must-go place but if you don't have the patience to plan a month in advance, you are not missing out on the best, mind-blowing cocktails of all times either.", "author": "Wonhee P."}

The booze is not overpowering and each drink is DELICIOUS to the point where you won't notice that suddenly you're feeling the buzz. I particularly love the drinks with egg white. \n\nThe awesome thing about the 3 course is that each TASTES like what course it is. The aperitif is a good starter drink, light but flavorful.\u00a0The main is a full-body drink and definitely hits the palate but never too much so. And finally, the dessert is more like a \"if you're not feeling it, here's the kick\" drink but still delicious.

I've been dying to try Wilson forever since I love B&B's line of bars, and was so freaking EXCITED when I finally made my reservation. I really wanted to love the place but shit, I was so let down. Review is moreso for lack of service and response from management - drinks were good, though I was expecting more.   \n\nThe good stuff first though: making a reservation through the website was a LOT easier than I had anticipated, though it may have been due to the fact that it was on a Halloween celebration weekend. We walked up to the door, gave the password, and was graciously taken through the back entrance (I felt so sneaky!) and shown to our seats by the hostess. So far, so good. \n\nTony was our bartender that night and, maybe he was having an off night, but man it was hard to get anything beyond a cursory explanation of the menu. My attempts to engage in conversation were met with abrupt responses as he made our drinks as quickly as possible. During his down time, he was browsing his phone - behind the bar, in the corner - which was off-putting, because if No Phones is a thing for patrons at B&B, I'm pretty sure that bartenders would be extra beholden to that. It kinda sucked, sitting in silence on our end of the bar while the bartender on the other end was engaging and laughing with his customers on the other end. Didn't bother staying through the 3-course drinks. While we waited outside for our Lyft, we saw Tony speedily hightailing it out - looks like someone was anxious to leave. \n\nI've never been so disappointed with service that I've written directly to an establishment, but there's a first time for everything. I used B&B's Contact Us form (Wilson & Wilson didn't have its own), detailed my night to them, and didn't even receive a response back. I wasn't looking for free drinks, a simple \"Thank you for making us aware of this, we're looking into it\" would've sufficed.

On the Yelp scale of five stars, I think I expected this to be, oh, about a 10. \n\nThe concept is \"Prohibition speakeasy.\" Inside, it's small, dark and sexy. You typically have to make a reservation well in advance. Remember your password, they take the speakeasy theme seriously here. No cell phone usage inside, which is difficult for people like me who like to take pics and make notes for the purpose of remembering what I was drinking so that I can write about it here without coming off as a dumb ass. But I dig the theme and played along, so dumb ass, it is. \n\nAs for drinks, you can order a la carte, or you can go for the $30 \"tasting menu.\" I'd recommend the latter, as it nets 3 drinks in total - an apertif, a \"main course,\" and a digestif. It's not a bad deal at all. \n\nI have forgotten exactly what it was I had for the apertif, but it was light, icy and refreshing - I believe it was a concoction based upon Lillet Blanc, if I'm not mistaken. It was almost too breezy; it went down way too easily. \n\nThe \"main course\" was the Fu Manchu, which was also my hands-down favorite of the three. Again, I forget exactly what was in it, but it was spicy, sweet and bitter, showing off the finest balance and overall feel. \n\nFor the digestif, I picked a whiskey-based cocktail. This one was just too much, with none of the balance I enjoyed with the last course. Way too fiery-hot for my liking, this one required sipping over the course of an hour or so, which took me well over the span of our allotted reservation...so we were escorted over to the main \"Library\" bar where I hung around and finished my drink. It wasn't my favorite, but I'm sure that if given several visits to try the other digestifs, I'd have found one I like better. \n\nI'd come back.

Our bartender said in the bigger bar areas they have 62 listed specialty cocktails.  I don't know about in the other rooms, but because the room we were in had very labor-intensive cocktails with very specific ingredients you are not allowed to order cocktails not on the menu. So take that for what it is worth. I honestly think it makes the whole experience better because, seriously people, their cocktails are magical.

Also, there was no mixing with other guests, which was great to give a relief to the meat market bar/club scene.\n\nNow to the drinks!  The cocktail menu is either $12 each or 3 for $30, which is what we chose for our night.  The 3-drink set was encouraged by the bar so as to provide new, maybe challenging experiences.  Each drink option was full of contrasting and complimentary ingredients that, at first, read appear incompatible but are amazing when imbibed together!  We had fun choosing one well-crafted drink from each section: aperitif, main and disgestif.  We all started with the champagne cocktail, the Red Scarab, then diverged.  I chose the Skull Island Sour for my love of egg white in a cocktail, then chose the Hard Boiled for a slow-sipper to end my evening.\n\nWe definitely got our $30 value and left with a pleasant buzz!

Somewhat uneventful, to say the least. This review is specifically for New Year's Eve for the previous year...and NYE at Wilson and Wilson is NOT like any other night of the year. \n\nW&W is a speakeasy inside a bar inside another bar. In essence, it puts the 'chicken' in 'turducken'. From everything I've read I know I would love W&W on any given day, 364 days of the year, as it embodies all that is magical about a speakeasy - a sense of intimacy, romantic vibes with candle lighting and dark hues, personal attention from the bartenders and, most importantly, incredible custom made cocktails with homemade additives (bitters, syrups, tonics). NYE is not any given day; it is the 365th day.\n\nOn NYE W&W becomes alive. It is the antithesis of my 2014 NYE and my memories of that night, just over one year ago, were enough to make me feel not so let down by my lack of celebrations this year. Each bar within the \"Anti-Saloon League\" was themed for the evening and W&W was rocking the '70s. They had a short drink list to make ordering on such a crowded night easier but even those were much more intricate than your average cocktail list at a poppin bar on a holiday. I sampled a couple of the offerings, all of which were named to fit the disco theme, and they were very good. We had the best seats in the house, right in front of bartenders Eddie and Tony doing their magic, which was great as I was able to notice that my Booty Collins (cognac, brown sugar, cinnamon syrup, lemon, soda) was different than the others I'd seen made (it was missing the cinnamon syrup). Given how busy the bar was (and, shall we say, their somewhat inebriated state), one error for the evening was less than expected and it was quickly remedied. All of Justin's drinks and my last were created by the bartenders based off our preferences instead of the menu and really hit the spot. W&W isn't our local spot yet they were able to find just the concoction to suit our tastes. \n\nThough W&W can never be called an average bar, nothing about our evening there was normal, and that made it perfect. Great cocktails, entertaining bartenders, and the best company in the world was only made even more perfect by sealing the night with a kiss and starting 2014 off to the fabulous year it became.", "author": "Sue C."}

He was rude and condescending to both me and my friend and I'm not sure why. He wasn't like that with  most of the other customers, but he did have the same attitude towards his coworkers. I honestly wanted to leave zero tip but I tipped anyway, because while he needed work on his personality, he made good drinks. But seriously, his attitude kinda ruined it a little for me,\nReason 2 - Their drinks tended to be more on the sour side. Especially the ones on the 1st and 2nd course. So I'd preface that you don't like sour upfront, if you have a sensitive palette. \nReason 3 - their chairs or bar stools were ridiculously uncomfortable.

A variety of liquors to choose from. Sadly I dont remember the names since I knocked down 3 within 2 hours. It doesnt sound like a lot, but they know how to mix it so that you barely even notice how much you're drinking!\n\nThey really do play the parts of those at a speakeasy from the password, to the wardrobe, to the music. Makes you never want to leave this place!\n\nThe Bad: We booked online, but didn't get Bourbon and Branch which I think is a lot better in comparison because they offer flights there. More bang for your buck since you get to try out more drinks. Since they're opening another branch out at Berkeley soon, I'm sure a lot of regulars will be happy to see if they can get reservations there instead.\n\nNo pictures and no phones. I love how it's so secretive, but obviously as a foodie or drink afficionado, you'd like to have some photographic evidence of what you had for the night. And everyone working there really does dress the part. \n\nIt's just on the peripheral of a sketchy neighborhood (Tenderloin) which is fine in the daytime, but since the place is only open at night (and ppl usually drink at night), you may feel a bit uncomfortable leaving the place late. If you're in a group and just head East as soon as you leave then you're fine. If not, I'd suggest calling yourself an Uber taxi.\n\nThe Overall: Authentic, unique drinks, and just a fun night out, a must for tourists and a go to for a good drink in town.\n\nRevisit: For sure!

The prices at W&W is pretty similar to that of B&B, but W&W gives you the option to select your drinks from a prefixed menu. Three carefully crafted drinks for $30?

I like the added touch of needing a password and having the outside look like a detective agency. Nonetheless, you definitely should get a reservation so you can make sure you get some seats.\n\nI think the coolest part of the experience at Wilson & Wilson is the cocktail tasting menu: three drinks for $30. Each \"course\" has a set of drinks to choose from, and they get heavier and fuller with each. I have to say that my favorite was my first choice, the Red Scarab. Fruity and light, which is exactly how I like my drinks. As I wasn't sure what I would like to try for my second and third drinks, the bartender easily broke each choice down for me in terms of texture and taste (super helpful). All in all it was a unique experience I definitely wouldn't mind repeating.\n\nIf you're not into the cocktail course menu, you can order spirits from their vast collection. I'm talking huge. They have so many different whiskeys and other types of spirits that there is no chance of you not finding something for your taste buds to revel in.\n\nOnly down side is the chairs at the bar were kind of uncomfortable.

We definitely had drinks for dinner.\n\nYou receive an email confirmation with the password. What is also nice is that you get a phone call confirmation as well. They say they honor your reservations with a 15 minute window. OMG...  I forgot how annoying SF taxis are!! It is not easy to hail one esp if you're in SOMA... But we got there at 20 after AND they were still kind enough to let us in- NOT strict at all. We walked up to the door and buzzed the intercom and there were some stragglers hanging out at the door trying to get in with our password :P HAHA Silly people!! Good thing the owners accommodate people like that in the library. We were escorted to this darker part of the building, going up some stairs and hallways and hoping we wouldn't trip on anything since it was SO DARK IN THERE!! Candles were lit the way but that is the dimmest of dim places I've ever experienced! \n\nFinally arrived to the Wilson&Wilson Detective Agency :) LOVE the ambiance and setting! Sat at the bar and the bartender, Russell, the COOLEST bartender EVER greeted us with a file. The file contained the drink list/menu. His best suggestion for tasting a little bit of everything with a gradual growth of alcohol libations was the 3 for $30 digestifs. Great idea! We chatted him up the entire visit! He is VERY well versed with his liquors and flavors. There was another fella behind the bar as well in really neat square frames- the two just completed the look of the bar! I definitely enjoyed my experience there. There was never a dull moment. As we all spoke easily, the volume grew when more people filled the room. So kind of lost a bit of the touch. But at that point, we were a few drinks deep and we were adding to the volume. \n\nI especially enjoyed watching Russell make the drinks. It is SO intricate. I wanted to order a traditional french 75 but that is something that the Library makes. Behind these dark halls and doors, they make custom drinks that we later learned are concocted by the bartenders themselves! I think the custom drinks are more fun and interesting than the traditional ones that are ordered anywhere. \n\nRussell and the other bartender made our experience a lot of fun! We will definitely be back again. They were THE MOST friendly and well versed bartenders I've ever met in a bar setting like this.\n\nNext time, SF, I'll be back.

I was a little off the night we went, so that might have contributed some, to be fair.\n\nFirst the good, I really dig the concept and it's well executed. It feels like a secret, hard to get into place, and it's got the dark paneling and low lighting that one would expect from a speakeasy. The menu and its accompanying \"case file\" are really cool, and I loved the extensive spirits list. I feel like it would take at least a dozen visits to try everything that piqued my curiosity there.\n\nThe drinks were okay, but I think sometimes this whole mixology scene takes things further than is necessary. Good, classic cocktails don't require keeping a dozen different tinctures, spritzes of butterscotch and kaffir lime leaves run over a microplane. Don't get me wrong, they tasted good, but in my opinion the result didn't quite keep pace with the effort.\n\nI wasn't the only one a little off that night, our bartender was apparently not all there either. He made good drinks, but for the first round he completely pooched them. he handed us two drinks and said, \"Here is the X and here is the Y.\" We questioned him because it didn't sound right and he switched the location of the drinks and said, \"no, wait, here is the Y and here is the X.\" When my wife pointed out that I hadn't ordered a Y, I had ordered a Z he took both drinks back and started over. He wasn't rude about it or anything, it just made it come across like he wasn't really sure what he was doing. I did enjoy my drink, though, right or wrong :).\n\nThe only boo I'll throw in is that I really didn't like the barstools.

Every now and then, I find myself googling: \"things to do in SF\" and usually I find some pretty interesting results.  A few weeks ago, I came across this list of things to do http://www.7x7.com/arts/big-do-sf-100-things-do-you-die\nand Bourbon and Branch stood out to me.  When I visited the B&B website, I then found out about Wilson and Wilson, and then made my reservation. \n\nThe reservation online is very simple: name, date, time, and length of reservation.  Within minutes, they'll send you a confirmation with the secret password to get in.  On the day of the visit, they'll even give you a call to remind you.\n\nMy boyfriend and I showed up a few minutes early for our 6 p.m. reservation and there was a crowd of adults crowding around the door.  They don't let people in before 6, so a line formed, but it was fine.  We entered through the door for Bourbon and Branch and then were led through that bar, through the back room, through another door, to the next door, Wilson and Wilson bar.  The host walked a little too fast, considering how dark it was (and that there were steps!)- but oh well.\n\nI was glad when we made it to the Wilson and Wilson bar, which is a lot brighter than the Bourbon and Branch bar.  We were seated at the bar and given a portfolio (menu).  It had several papers filed in it- including the drink menu and many papers about the missing persons case (which is a part of their whole private detective agency deal).  The case itself is pretty interesting to look over- but of course, we came for the drinks.\n\nMy boyfriend did the flight (3 drinks for $30; one from each section):\nApertif: I believe it had some lemon flavor to it.\nMain: The charlie chan.  This was our favorite drink of the night. It was black tea flavored- definitely something different from the usual type of mixed drink.\nDigestifs: Hard boiled.  This was also really tasty as well.  Gin, apple brandy, cardamaro, with some cinnamon and orange flavors.  I would recommend this as well. \n\nI ordered one drink from the Mains ($12 a la carte): don't remember the name, but it had strawberry flavor to it.  It was really tasty.  It was strong, but still easy to drink- all of the flavors worked so well together.\n\nThey also have punches ($40), which are for sharing and a long list of other alcohols.  \n\nOverall, the drinks were quite impressive.  At $12 each or $30 for three, it's obviously going to cost more than making them at home or going to the local bar, but it's definitely worth it- maybe for a special occasion.  The drinks each have a good amount of alcohol to them and they use quality ingredients.  The bar tender was very friendly/helpful, but also gave us plenty of space. We didn't know what some of the ingredients were and he was very knowledgeable and even let us try one of the alcohols.  The drinks were made with attention to detail and you can definitely taste all of the unique/complex flavors.  Plus, the bartender gave us water and consistently refilled it.  \n\nRemember: you have to make a reservation online, and remember the password.", "author": "Samantha L."}

Biggest problem: the stools. They're made out of some sort of steel/bronze that look kind of like a ribcage. And they are terribly uncomfortable. So uncomfortable, even if the rest of the experience was amazing, I would never return. My stool kind of sloped downwards and since you're sitting at high tables where your feet don't touch the floor, the downward slope made me slightly slip on the stool unless I supported myself with my arms on the table. Terrible! We only sat there for 45 minutes and my back was aching! And my friend complained that the stool was so hard it was hurting her butt. The stools look cool but are just awful. \n\nNext, we had two drinks recommended to us by the server and both were bad!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-06-06", "description": "Wilson & Wilson, the speakeasy within Bourbon & Branch, has so many failings that I have no qualms calling it a bad bar, but a handful of its unusual cocktails are so successful that I might send a serious cocktail-drinker there anyway. Of the six drinks we tried, one was a well-mixed, conventional drink; two were commendable innovations; one was a remarkably interesting creation that was enjoyable for a few sips; two were all-around failures. This isn't a particularly good ratio for a fun night out, but it may be quite acceptable to the cocktail-aficionado seeking adventure.\n\nAnyone going to Wilson & Wilson, however, should be prepared for the shortcomings in infrastructure and service. While the room is nicely appointed and generally pleasant, the stools are uncomfortable (both of ours were frighteningly wobbly) and closely packed. Regarding service: while the hostess managed to navigate the speakeasy theatrics in a friendly and efficient manner, we still lost five of our ninety minutes to the process. That proved to be minor compared to the next nine minutes we spent at the bar waiting for the bartender to acknowledge us, pour water, and remove the dirty cloth coaster that was left from the previous guest. No bar should welcome a guest without a glass of water, but a bar with a time limit for each guest should be doubly attentive. As it happened, this particular bartender paid us so little attention that by the end of the night we had exchanged more words through casual greetings with the bartender working the far end of the bar that we had with our alleged host.\n\n[For anyone wondering about the specific cocktails, here are the six we tried, grouped by course: (1) Kiss Me Deadly is a tantalizing failure, promising notes of wasabi but losing them in an overpowering blend of citrus and honey. The Maltese Falcon grabs attention with pronounced orange and sesame flavors but would be better served as a much smaller portion. (2) Red Harvest is only for those that enjoy heavy-cream cocktails, but it's a homerun for those that do. Double Indemnity is a traditionally profiled, well-balanced tequila drink. (3) The Long Goodbye has the standard proportions of a Manhattan but defies expectations with pronounced smoke and barbecue aromas. Sanctuary is a one-dimensional failure; promises of black pepper are lost in an unending assault of sweetness.]", "author": "H James L."}

Unless they need to check if your place is ready and cannot raise anyone in the bar by phone and eventually send you back there with another couple.  The hush-hush thing is kind of fun, but they seemed a little overrun when we arrived.\n\nAnyway, the room was cozy and almost disturbingly warm.  We were seated at the end of the bar, near the single restroom, the door to which the bartender kept having to close while performing his other duties.  There were two bartenders that relatively busy night, one of whom disappeared for a prolonged time guiding a couple to the Library, and after several increasingly desperate inquiries by his compatriot was suggested to have perhaps gone out to take a smoking break, leaving half the bar rather underserved.\n\nThey have a wall of liquor - much of it quite interesting - and a very deep bourbon list.  The main thing is the cocktails - about ten on offer - as others have said, you can order individually, or as a flight of three ( though as mentioned the rules regarding this seem at once fluid, arbitrary and convoluted ).  It does take about 90 minutes to be served three cocktails - a leisurely experience.\n\nOur bartender explained to us that the concept behind Wilson & Wilson was to offer a more modern style of cocktail incorporating house-made flavorings.  Indeed, all the syrups, tinctures, bitters and so on in the offerings were either made or modified in-house.  Think vanilla infused Angostura bitters, for instance.  They took great pride in this, and in fact were willing to talk at great length about the difficulty of, say, infusing bacon into vodka.\n\nWhere this all fell down, in the end, was in the actual cocktails.  They were well thought out.  They were varied in flavor.  They had interesting premises.  But to my taste, they were *not* well made.  Each one combined such a large number of flavors with the base spirit that what resulted was unsubtle and muddy in flavor - not a clear layering of bright and interesting tastes, but an unfortunate melange with no one thing standing out.  Six cocktails like this - some good flavors on occasion, some promising concepts, but overall very disappointing given the thought and care that went into it all.", "author": "Albert H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-10-21", "description": "I'll admit, I was a bit skeptical of this place before arriving. The whole idea of a \"secret password\" to get into the back room of the bar didn't make much sense when all you had to do was make a reservation in order to get said password. We arrived on a Saturday night at 9 pm and at first had trouble finding the secret back door entrance on the corner of Jones and O'Farrell Streets. It was kind of awkward milling around the side of the building looking for a buzzer or bell or anything to ring to be let in. Finally a hostess opened up this door out onto the street. We gave her our names and password for the night, then were led inside of Bourbon and Branch, a speakeasy. Because we had made reservations and received the password ahead of time, after about a minute of waiting in Bourbon and Branch, our hostess (decked out in 1920's flapper attire) led us around the bar to a liquor shelf that opened, serving as the entryway into the exclusive Wilson & Wilson Detective Agency, an entirely different speakeasy inside of the speakeasy! The mood inside Wilson & Wilson is much more subdued, and there were only about 10 people inside. The setting is incredible: the back wall is lined with hundreds and hundreds of bottles of alcohol, and from the menu you'll see these aren't your average drinks. We decided on the \"prix fixe\" cocktail flight that includes a light aperitif, followed by a \"main course,\" and ends with a digestif, all for $30. The aperitif was excellent, the main course was okay, but my digestif, the Hard Boiled, was kind of gross and I had to just gag it down before our strict two-hour reservation was up. It is nice that they discourage cell phone use and cameras in order to maintain the 1920's speakeasy vibe. The bartenders at Wilson & Wilson are superb: they are true cocktail masters, precisely pouring and mixing right before your eyes. They taste every drink, and if it's not up to their standards, they throw the whole thing out, even if it took over 5 minutes to make. The bartender making our cocktails was nice and as we chatted he offered us free shots.

I even get dressed up in period dress. I'm serious about my nostalgia!\n\nSo I was set to love Wilson & Wilson. It was my birthday and I was with my best friend. We rang the bell, gave the password, were led through a locked door into a secret bar....manned by two mysteriously sullen bartenders.\n\nAs soon as you make your reservation, you receive an email about the rules of the bar. We followed them--no cell phones, no lingering at the bar, etc. But no one warned us about the other unprinted rules...\n\nMy friend wanted to get the flight and I was going to get just a regular cocktail. A total of 4 drinks for two people. We expected they'd be strong, so we thought we could share, but we were told that if we shared the flight, the drinks would count as regular cocktails at regular price. Ok. Kind of random, but if that's their policy....\n\nSo we went ahead, but wondered if the price would change if I was caught sipping his drinks. Not that a few bucks are a big deal, but the paranoia about the rules! Perhaps it's just another note of ambiance--the feeling of being watched?\n\nWe ended up getting 3 drinks each--two flights, we thought. But when we went to pay, we were told that only 3 of our drinks counted as a flight, because to be a \"flight,\" there had to be one drink each from each of the sections of the menu: apertif, main, and digestif.\n\nAgain, fine. But it felt like playing dodgeball with an ever-shifting set of rules. I didn't recall seeing that specified on the menu--and I read that thing thoroughly (seriously--quiz me about the contents of Lorraine Adeline Wilson's purse!). But the real kicker was when I asked the bartender about it, she snapped, \"I'll fix it,\" and crumpled the original bill and tossed it aside.

The price is right. Chairs at the bar are a bit uncomfortable. I wish the cocktails were made in front of us, but it looks like the main setups were in the corners of the bar.\n\nFor dates and small groups, it's nice to be able to get a reservation. Otherwise, it's a worthy stop on the bar rotation. Here's what we got, and thoughts on each:\n\n-------------\n\nThe Seraph's Curse: recommended to us as very botanical due to the aperol, but balanced a bit too heavily on the sweet side for the flavors to express themselves. IMHO.\n\nThe Red Scarab: Something of a distant relative of the French 75, or actually the French 77. I thought this was done really well.\n\nFu Manchu: This drink is all about the five spice. Some of the other complexity gets drowned out because five spice (esp. star anise) can be really strong, but you may not be used to drinking five spice like this, so it's still enjoyable for that.\n\nSkull Island Sour: A nice sour-style drink. Ordered for the butterscotch flavor, but it didn't hit me at first. Probably would have if I had stayed with the drink and not switched. Some drinks do grow on you with time.\n\nTruth Serum: Opens up as your average scotch-with-sweetness-and-flavors cocktail, then finds its niche as you stick with it. I don't favor scotch cocktails, and I found myself enjoying this quite a bit at the end.\n\nHard Boiled: I was underwhelmed - the amaros carried most of the flavor for me. Good to try, but I wouldn't choose to order it.\n\nCharlie Chan: This drink is all about the tea, so if you like tea, you'll like this. As with the Fu Manchu, a lot of complexity seemed to get lost in the mixture, but it's also possible that at this point I had lost the ability to discern subtle flavors.", "author": "Ganesh R."}

Wilson & Wilson is one of the settings inside Bourbon and Branch.\n\nAs far as reservations go they operate independently, and because of the size it is better for small groups (when I say small groups I mean two people). I went there and we were a group of four; we were lucky to get a reservation because they only have one table that fits a group larger than 2, and it only fits 4.\n\nIf you plan on coming here, you must make reservations about a month in advance, maybe even more, but it is worth it!\n\nWhat distinguishes Wilson & Wilson from the rest of Bourbon an Branch is the cocktails available in that area. They have home made ingredients and are quite fantastic. There is a huge range of flavors and styles, so don't think there won't be several cocktails perfect for your taste.\n\nI really really recommend this establishment!", "author": "Gerardo C."}

I also believe in maximizing your exposure to as many good things as possible (since life is short), and Wilson & Wilson is one of them.  \n\nAs much as I love Bourbon & Branch, I can see why people can get turned off despite the excellent cocktail and liquor selection - the waitresses are a bit snobbish and need smoothing over, plus recently it seems like the  waitress I get all the time can't seem to recommend anything other than the same cocktail to everyone.  To me, this indicates lack of training and true understanding of ingredients, which is a tad alarming in an establishment like B&B. \n\nIn contrast, Wilson & Wilson offers a more intimate, one-on-one experience that greatly benefits from its smaller, more exclusive room (40 people max) with two dedicated bartenders.  It's quietly whimsical,  taking you back to the days of nostalgic Mid-Atlantic accents, wide-brimmed fedoras and impeccably tailored femme fatales.   The service is friendly and laid back, and our bartender Russell was both attentive but respectful of our space.  I sense that the staff here is flexible for custom requests, but takes a lot of pride in their special menu and will definitely give some background on each item listed.\n\nMy fiance and I shared a 3 cocktail flight and an extra digestif:\n\n1. The Seraph's Curse - light, herbal, sweet and citrusy with a foamy bitter  fennel finish. Delightful.\n\n2. The Charlie Chan - Nuanced, elegant, and utterly unique.  I can't really add more than what others have already said, but it's a must have on any visit.  I recommend drinking this almost like tasting a fine wine - smell it, taste it, and aerate it a bit in your mouth.  You'll get the subtle coconut  in the froth that leads into the lovely clovey peppery finish. \n\n3. The Hard Boiled - Honestly, this one escaped me a bit.  The aroma was like apple pie filling with less of a spice presence - though the apple brandy was pretty excellent.   It's not my cup of tea, but if you like brandy, apples, citrus, and something a bit sweeter, this may be for you.  \n\n4. The Pinkerton - Easily my favorite of the cocktails that evening.  It was almost like what a tough-as-nails Noir gumshoe would have for breakfast - OJ/Cranberry Juice, Coffee, and Bourbon.  Presentation was also quite classily masculine - a simple highball with a large cube of ice and the orange peel twist to garnish.   The excellent aroma hit me first - top notes of sweet orange deepening into the middle spices, berry and bourbon, rounding out with the bottom bitter coffee undertones.  The taste really featured the great bourbon - but what I absolutely loved was the lingering dark coffee aftertaste, like the smell of cigarettes after an old lover leaves the room. \n\nAll in all, a great evening.  Two complaints though - I suggest that the seats be redone for the sake of XY chromosome inclined customers.  My poor fiance was constantly fidgeting until I suggested he stand up to savor his last drink.   Second,  no self-respecting gumshoe wouldn't have Venetian blinds on his windows.  As a giant Film Noir geek, I find this a bit of a sore point. :-P\n\nGo there. It's great, and if you mind the seats, then just order another drink.

Dangling legs are no fun.\n\nWe both got the three cocktail flight for $30. I can't remember everything we got, but I recall my Hard Boiled and Skull Island Sour cocktails were excellent.

Its more like a sit down restaurant with waiters but instead of food they serve drinks. The drinks are even divided into Apertifs, Mains, and Digestifs.

It has the authentic, Prohibition-era speakeasy vibe as Bourbon & Branch, as well as the fun and laid-back feel that Bourbon & Branch unfortunately doesn't. I love the entire ambiance of the tiny bar, every minuscule detail perfectly executed to reflect their unique 1920's detective theme. I loved the frosted window pane -- it made me feel like I was in a Hitchcock thriller; and when cops drive by (which happens pretty often in the Tenderloin), the flashing siren lights make the window look that much more cool.\n\nThe number of cocktails at Wilson & Wilson pale in comparison to the encyclopedia of a menu at B&B, but I think that the quality of the drinks at W&W are far superior. I love the tasting flights of 3 different cocktails for $30. It was a great opportunity to try out different drinks, the vast majority of which were phenomenal. \n\nMy favorite drink of the night was the Charlie Chan. It smelled great (black pepper aroma) and had a gentle sweetness that wasn't too overpowering. The black tea infused alcohol (vodka?) provided an excellent balance for all the flavors. Other great drinks include the Truth Serum and Skull Island. The Pulp Fiction was good too, but I had too high of expectations for it, since it carries the same name as that of my favorite film of all time. \"English, motherfucker, do you speak it?!\"\n\nWhat made our night awesome, however, was our bartender, Lauren. She had a great humor and was very sweet to our party of 5. Her mixology skills were on point. We all agreed that she was the primary reason why our visit to Wilson & Wilson was incredible. \n\nAs much as I love Bourbon & Branch, the problem there is that you don't feel important at all. You have stuck-up waitresses yelling at you for talking too loud and none of them try to get to know you. There's a disconnect from its patrons that borders on arrogant. \n\nAt Wilson & Wilson, however, you feel important. You can relax, have good conversations, and drink amazing concoctions to your heart's content. And that makes the experience so much more enjoyable.", "author": "Roy C."}

At Wilson & Wilson, it was worth it.\n\nCocktails are amongst my favorite pursuits, and when I heard that a more intimate venue was opening within B&B, Wilson's instantly became my summer vacation destination. \n\nWhile I applaud the reintroduction of honesty and craft to the cocktail that the last ten years has brought, many head to the flagship venues more for their cache than their craft, leading to a less personal experience -- there's often far too little opportunity to interact with the bartenders when they have to stir and shake cocktails that require careful and time-consuming preparation for growing and often impatient crowds. The 'backroom bar' like Wilson's is a way of solving that problem that I entirely encourage -- those interested enough to make the extra effort then have the opportunity to really engage with a bartender who is passionate about their craft. \n\nAt Wilson's, it's passion you can taste. All three of my cocktails -- Truth Serum, Hard Boiled, and the Charlie Chan -- were excellent. Some cocktail bars have 'jumped the shark' by getting too focused on an arrays of infusions, fat washing, molecular mixology and other cocktail trends that they forget that, in the end, it's about the taste. Wilson's (and presumably B&B by extension) have not forgotten this. Truth Serum is a classic, and the Charlie Chan highlighted why I'm glad that Wilson hasn't fallen prey to the notion that vodka has no place in a proper cocktail program, because it was superb. But my standout cocktail of the night was the superlative Hard Boiled -- a harmonious combination of Old Tom Gin, Applejack, and two amaros. It had 'pop' -- that wonderful quality when your senses respond almost viscerally to the symphony upon your tongue -- I wish I was drinking one now.\n\nIn addition to great conversation, shaking us excellent drinks, and educating us on some specialty spirits, our bartender Jason even offered me a taste of a spirit I was particularly excited to see. Thank you so much!\n\nBonus Points: We had serious travel issues getting to SF, and wound up there over a day late, missing our reservation time by an *hour*,  yet they graciously seated us for the remainder of our reservation period. I didn't even expect we'd get in the door, and I would have completely understood that. That was a classy move.

The entrance is not as hidden and cool as B&B's library entrance.  If you thought B&B was quiet, The Wilson Bar is quieter!  They fill it to seat capacity, meaning no one is really standing therefore this is strictly for dates, small group outings.  You won't be bothered by any one outside of your party.\n\nThe decor is very much like a combo of B&B and The Rickhouse.  All three bars are managed by the same owners so I can see why they are so similar.  The lighting is dim with nice ambient lighting reflecting off the walls and pressed tin ceiling.\n\nOnce you sit down someone slides a personalized envelope and talks out of the side of their mouth (\"Look here, see...\"). They look left and right making sure they're not associated with you.  Totally kidding.  The whole menu in a \"hush-hush\" envelope makes it seem it should be presented that way.  It's cute, a lil gimmicky, but not totally tasteless.  They definitely promote the speakeasy theme here.  When they called confirming my reservation, their number was Blocked!  ha!\n\nThe drinks are well-crafted and inventive.  Not overly sweet, not powerfully bitter.  Great care down to choice of glassware to the type of ice used in each cocktail.  Digestifs were the strongest for me and run on the burny side.  $30 for 3 cocktails seems pretty fair considering the actual ingredients and craft being used.\n\nMy only complaint and it did bug me the entire time were the actual stools we sat on.  It's made out of iron? or some form of hard metal that contours your derriere plus other parts.  Speakeasy and Siteasy, boys, you may get a lil unexpected poke from the front part of the stool.

The host then leads you through B&B to a locked door that leads to Wilson.  The space consists of a bar with seating and a few two-person tables against the wall; in all, there's space for maybe 25 or so people.\n\nThe menu is organized into aperitifs, mains, digestifs, and punches; you can order a 3-drink pre fixe for $30 (one aperitif, main, & digestif), or go a la carte for $12 each.  (Punches are $40 for ~4 drinks worth & are served in a tea pot.)  We did a pre fixe each & then ordered one more round, so all told, we ended up tasting eight of the eleven cocktails on the current menu.\n\nThe drinks absolutely live up to their heritage.  Be prepared, however, for slightly more adventurous offerings than you'd encounter on the regular B&B menu; these tasty concoctions feature the likes of black tea-infused vodka, sasparilla-infused bitters, black pepper tincture, and coffee syrup.  Our favorites included the Charlie Chan (black tea-infused vodka, lemon juice, honey syrup, coconut marmalade, black pepper tincture, clove tincture), the Red Scarab, and the Pinkerton.\n\nFrom talking to our server, it sounds as if the menu will rotate at least seasonally, & will potentially feature a guest selection or two from the regular B&B menu.

With the segregation of W&W and B&B and the library, they did a really nice job of giving a tiny bar feeling to a pretty big place. Also the intricate reservation system makes sure you're not in a packed house. All in all really nice experience.\nBut I wanted to talk about cocktails. We, of course, did the flight of cocktails. 3 drinks for $30, generally speaking, I'd say worth every penny! I had read that part. I didn't understand this is set up like a prix fixe dinner, pick one cocktail from each list (not just pick any 3). I have two points here, first, the Charlie Chan (my \"main\") was possibly the BEST cocktail I've ever had - and I've had a few. The second is this. The \"digestifs\" are, as our bartender described, very liquor forward cocktails. There are three choices - a gin drink, a scotch drink and a bourbon drink. We didn't do the gin, so can't speak to it, the bourbon drink basically was a manhattan, but the scotch drink...oh dear lord. It's a VERY smokey scotch. This just speaks to my (our) individual tastes. I could not finish it, and after my husband had a sip of it, he couldn't finish his bourbon. I think I managed about 5 sips. Here's my point. If you aren't a bourbon, scotch or gin drinker - don't order the flight. even if it is a good deal.\nThis place really deserves 5 stars, and I'd totally give it to them if it weren't for the sick feeling we had for a couple of hours after that scotch drink. and the rather uncomfortable chairs.", "author": "Carrie W."}

Just love the idea of classic and incredible cocktails served in such an elegant environment. I also love the fact that when I go to Bourbon and Branch, I can arrive at the time scheduled to me and know that I will be able to get a seat! Also there is no worry about being able to hear my friends. \n\nWhen my friend from Portland came down here, I knew I had to introduce her to this establishment. However, like most people writing reviews here, I was unable to schedule a reservation at Bourbon and Branch. However, their website easily guided me to Wilson and Wilson, where there were still many openings. After reviewing exactly what this Wilson and Wilson was, I decided we definitely needed to go. \n\nI am happy to have made the decision! Although the menu of creations is not as extensive as Bourbon and Branch, it is more creative. Their creations use tinctures (black pepper tincture for example) to provide you with that unique flavor. \n\nAfter leafing through the menu which is cleverly disguised as a case file ( of course we read through the case file and reviewed the photos - that's part of the fun!), my friend and I opted for a punch. It was served in a teapot and drunk in little tea cups. How could we pass on that. The flavors were amazing. It was sweet but not syrupy sweet as some other drinks you will find, such as Mai Tais. It tasted simple but I saw our bartender make it, and it was anything but! \n\nWe then moved on to try a single drink. I opted for the Charlie Chan as the ingredients were as unique as I could find. Coconut Marmalade, hello? \n\nMy first sip was good. It definitely had a spicy kick to it with the black pepper tincture and cloves, but the coconut marmalade cooled it down a bit. However, as I continued to sip, the spices became a bit too much for me. I did finish it, but don't think I'd order that one again. \n\nHowever, there are many other options to try. When I return I shall go with the thirty dollars for three cocktails and try three more lovely cocktails!", "author": "Debbie H."}

Like a real restaurant, if that restaurant's only goal was to give you liquid mouth pleasure and get you all drunk-like. All six of the cocktails we tried were really good. My main drink (the Skull Island Sour) however, was transcendent.  Well as transcendent an experience as one can have with fancy, expensive cocktails. Frothy (egg whites) at the beginning, sour-y (citrus) in the middle and smooth butterscotch (butterscotch tincture) on the finish -- it left me wanting to Skull (island-sour) F it over and over again. \n\nI'd go back to see what they had cooking and to share a $40 punch bowl, which we didn't try because there was only two of us and I didn't want to Richard Whiskey myself or commit Assault & Battery against my liver (hey, maybe A&B can be the next Future Bars project?).\n\nDecor: B\n\nIt's always cool in Bourbon and Branch, but Wilson & Wilson is supposed to be a separate experience from going to B&B -- hence the stand alone website/reservations and 'private detective' theme. Only its exactly like Bourbon and Branch and doesn't follow through on it's private detective theme except for a sharp looking window cover.\n\nI thought they could have gone further either in theme or at least in making the decor a departure from your B&B experience. That said, the overall vibe at Bourbon&Branch/Wilson&Wilson still leaves you with the feeling that you're cooler than you are, even if that cooler version of yourself isn't a hard boiled noir private detective. \n\nService: B+\n\nNow, before anyone gets mad at me, hear me out. This rating is again in relation to the expectations that were set for me beforehand. This was billed as an opportunity to have a smaller ratio between bartenders and patrons, with the goal of increased interaction and a heightened experience. We got sat at one of the side tables against the wall instead of at the bar and maybe this was the issue. \n\nWe got the normal incredible service from our cocktail goddess that you get at Bourbon and Branch, but no increased interaction with the bartenders. I don't think this was because it was too busy. In fact, there were periods during our time there that it was half full between reservation line changes and the bartenders were just kind of hanging around talking to each other. Maybe they were scared off by my grunts, moans and gesticulations when I got my Skull Island Sour -- can't say I blame them.\n\nConclusion: \n\nWilson & Wilson is a great addition to the Bourbon and Branch family. If you've never been to B&B, feel free to go to Wilson & Wilson first, or go after you've been to B&B -- you'll be happy either way. If you're a B&B vet, you will love this place more if you adjust your expectations to anticipate more of the same exceptional drinks with the twist of the pre-fixe structure.", "author": "Cory C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-11-13", "description": "When it comes to the full experience, Wilson & Wilson nails it. Beyond the amazing drinks, the attention to even minor detail goes far in giving you a glimpse into times-gone-past. I'll admit, I was skeptical. Usually, places that have a theme seem to get something totally obvious, totally wrong. But from the second we walked up to the (unmarked) door, Wilson & Wilson delivered. \n\nThe hostess was dressed to the nines in 1920's flapper gear and played her part perfectly. She accepted the password (provided by emailing ahead of time for a reservation), brought us inside and picked up the phone for a brief conversation after asking us what name we'd used for the reservation. She then asked us to follow her through Bourbon & Branch (which was surprisingly noisy and absolutely packed at 10pm on a Friday night). After stopping at what appeared to be a heavy wooden door, she produced a key, unlocked the door and ushered us into a separate room where we were greeted by our waitress by name and provided with a reserved table.\n\nMy husband was watching me carefully at this point to see if I'd bring on the snark about something, but I was speechless. The room itself was small but impeccably decorated with the dead-on feel and look of a speakeasy. A tall, liquor-lined wall behind the bar featured bottles I'd never seen before, along with apothecary-style bottles filled with what I can only imagine may be the famous \"tinctures\" they create to use in their mind-blowingly-amazing drinks. The mood was a bit dark but upbeat, and even the music was appropriate for the place (no club beats or anything stupid - it was \"speakeasy\" music). The bar was full, as were the tables lining the walls, but it didn't feel claustrophobic. \n\nOur waitress, also dressed in character, immediately gave us our menus, which were designed as case files... and I feel even deeper in love with Wilson & Wilson. I poured over the case file like it was my job. We opted to go for the \"dinner\" of cocktails, which is an appetizer, main course and dessert. \n\nThey take their time making the drinks, and when you get your first one, it's obvious that it's worth it. I started with the Black Mask, moved onto the Phantom and ended with the Pinkerton. Every single drink was complex and I could literally taste each individual flavor. It was like that scene in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory where Violet steals the gum that becomes a full meal as she chews it. The flavors crept up on me at different times while I was drinking. By the time I got to my last drink (which seemed to be the strongest), I was in sheer bliss. And an added bonus: even though I was loopy by the time we left, I woke up the next day with no hangover *whatsoever.* If it's true that high-quality alcohol is less likely to leave you with a next-day hangover, Wilson & Wilson must use the highest quality on earth.\n\nIf I had to choose one thing about Wilson & Wilson that blew me away, it would have to be the drinks. However, everything was spot-on, including the service - our waitress was fantastic. If you're looking for a truly interesting experience that's unlike probably anything you've had before at a bar, make a reservation at Wilson & Wilson.", "author": "Gina T."}

It is such a unique offering to associate with the B&B family of establishments- and in the same sentiment - they do NOT offer appetizers... which means their only focus is their devotion to the refined spirits they prepare for you! \n\nI love the Prohibition-era theme they maintain, and the drinks are so unique... their extensive collection of spirits makes for a refined learning experience with their knowledgeable bartenders and souvenir menus. You get a slotted appointment time, thus making for a great place to start your night. A few take-aways to sum this place up: sexy, intimate, exclusive, password-protected, bar inside a bar, great hospitality, and a refined approach to spirits. They have a great prix-fixe menu (but at the same time, you can opt out and do an individual drink approach, if you prefer) and it is just like a meal - to start, they have an aperitif, the main course is main, and the final course, like dessert, is the digestif to finish.\n\nFortunately for us, we had the resident expert - Jayson Wilde, the bar manager to attend to our needs. Poor guy had to educate 4 knowledge-thirsty ladies on lilliet. We had a range of interests from tequila, gin, champagne, and vodka - and everyone left very satisfied.

Then this is the place for you.\n\nUpon hitting the buzzer outside and presenting the password to the hostess at B&B, my brother and I were led to the back, through a door in the wall, to W&W, which occupies a fairly tiny, rectangular shaped room. Cool prohibition era vibe mixed with a detective agency theme. About 8 tables and a bar, a nifty bathroom and that's it. Our server, Rachel, was friendly and knowledgeable. Although you can order your drinks a la carte, we chose the three-course option. First two drinks were stellar, but the dessert drink (and I wish I could remember the name of it) looked great (and even had the nifty one big ice cube like I love) but tasted like cough syrup.\n\nThe only other downer was the chairs. They're essentially metal high chairs, but they don't have foot rests. Without something to prop my legs up, they kept on digging into the metal chair.

Was unable to make reservations for B&B and was instead redirected to Wilson and Wilson. Finding the place was pretty interesting, as others have noted. There are no actual signs telling you where it is, so just follow the people at the corner of Jones St and O'Farrel St. Look for the people standing aimlessly at some door with a ringer! Tell them your password and in you go. \nOnce inside, the place is rather dark, but your eyes adjust fairly quickly (at least for me). Had to wait near the front door for someone to take us to our destination. Wilson and Wilson is right next to B&B and you get there through a door at the side of the place. The place was smaller overall, but I liked it. It wasn't too loud or too quiet. It was just right. The chairs were \"ok\", but rather wobbly...but manageable. \nCan't remember what I had, but I basically chose whatever seemed interesting and something I've never really had. Total of 3 drinks and only really liked 1, as the others weren't really to my liking but was still pretty drinkable.\nBartender was really nice and helpful with a fitting name to the \"detective\" theme. Take a guess? Honor? Nope. Law? This isn't Tekken! Justice? Yep! Haha, thought it was pretty cool either it was just a name for the theme or his actual name. \nTotal bill came to around $65 for two if you chose from the 3 for $30 menu.

My husband and I heard this place was pretty cool so we took an $18 taxi only to get to this place, as it was well out of our area.  As tourists, we had no idea how difficult traffic in San Fran would be getting there, until we arrived \"late\" and ended up in one of the seediest/shadiest areas of SF.  The door guy was cool and we gave him our password (Flannigan by the way) and we waited outside (again in a crappy area) for another 5 minutes until the door opened.  Some waitress girl/hostess then opened the door and asked again for the password, only to leave us waiting again for another 4-5 minutes while she looked up our reservations, only to come back with a huge smirk on her face, to tell us \"we were too late and couldn't come in\", closing the door on our face. While we understand that we were late, this is a BAR, not a five star dining restaurant that has to worry about available tables and dining reservations.  And when we looked inside we saw plenty of available space as it was only 6:30pm!  Seriously chick, get a clue,  and then get a life.  For that girl who is on a power trip and takes only too much pleasure in turning customers away for being 30 minutes late to a 1.5 hour long reservation (as their email indicates) this is ridiculous. Remember waitress girl, that you're the one opening the door and seating people, while we're the ones paying pretty high costs for those drinks,  and we're the ones probably paying for your rent.  So get off your high horse, get a real job, and then find out what it's like to get terrible service such as what you give.  Especially in a city like SF, where there's countless bars/restaurants and amazing bartenders who treat their customers excellent, and serve delectable cocktails.  Who do you think you are?  Remember that much when you go out of business as you lose money to the better places.  Not to worry however, when you turned us away, we got in touch with our friends who were also on their way to your dump, and we headed to the Marina District (another $20 or so taxi ride back to the nicer side of town) where we spent the next 3-4 hours of our Friday night drinking fabulous cocktails, tipping our awesome bartenders and spending lots and lots of $$$!  Glad they were able to benefit from your lack of class.  And to the business owners, get a better customer-facing employee who knows how to treat customers and remember that you're competing with an amazing city full of nightlife.

With all of the great mixology bars in this town I will certainly go elsewhere. The lack of attention to details here was surprising. For example, the bartenders and doormen wore nice period piece attire yet our waitress did not. The music was awful - playing some bad Mardi Gras style music too loudly instead of some nice sultry and smokey jazz or blues from the era.\nThe drink options were minimal - offering a \"flight\" of 3 drinks for $30 but there were only 3 or 4 choices from each of the three categories. Beyond that they offered no other unique drinks but you could pay WAY too much for a bourbon or rye on the rocks. \nBecause each of the drinks in the flight were made of different ingredients and thus different tastes, me and my friends thought that it'd be nice if they offered a bowl of salty snacks such as pretzels or peanuts in the shell - something of a palate cleanser between \"courses\" of drinks. When I suggested this to the waitress she told me how the owner REFUSES to allow ANY food of ANY type into ANY of his establishments because of the wide range of drinks they offer it would be too difficult to match food to cocktails. \n\nI am talking about peanuts or pretzels people! Plus the salt makes us thirsty and drink more.\n\nOh - and nowhere for me to hang my nice coat in the bathroom.\n\nI think this cocktail empire has become arrogant in their successes - and they don't care about what their customers want or need - because they know that the next reservation is right on your heels.\n\nI say take your business elsewhere - to one of the many other creative and detailed oriented bars in San Francisco.", "author": "Joel B."}

It's tiny, incredibly classy, vintage, romantic, secretive, dimly lit, and fun. The bartenders are on top of their game, being that they are extremely knowledgeable about anything you would possibly want to know about a drink. Not to mention total cuties. I only ordered one of their Main drinks- Skull Island. It smelled like Candyland and tasted like some rare candy fruit I would pluck from a tree at Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Basically it tasted like my imagination, and that is a pretty great taste. So why was it called Skull Island? Maybe b/c you could develop alcoholism from this one drink alone. I asked for a straw, and he refused to give one to me b/c he said I would miss out on the amazing mixture of flavors. The top was egg white w/ a spray of butterscotch. I will steal my friend's quote and say that I could smell it for the next month as well. Happiness is a good smell!\n\nMy other friend's ordered their 3 for $30 drink deal, being an Apertif, a Main and a Digestif. I of course got to try them all, and they were unbeatable. So basically every single drink that these geniuses mix up is going to be amazing. Yes they are pricey, but after one drink you feel buzzed.

They recommend a 3 course experience, where the cocktails are grouped into Aperitif, Main, and Digestif categories and you get one from each in that order.  My friend and I got two completely different sets of the 3 course experience.  The staff will help you design a coherent set and it's good to listen to their advice (which also includes what to pay attention to as you work your way through the drinks), so that your drinks complement each other.  I find the recipes complex and ingenious.  Most drinks are composed of no less than 4 total flavoring agents (that's on top of bases), many of which are house made, and the resulting balance is impressive.  The drinks are incredibly smooth and subtle, not the often confounding you-just-threw-stuff-together experience you can encounter in a lesser cocktail place.  In this San Francisco visit I had no less than 30 cocktails from half a dozen famous places in the span of 3 days and I consider this place the best of the bunch in terms of the craftsmanship.  \n\nI also find the setting very cool, although it's troublesome to have to make reservation for a time slot.

They even offer a prix-fixe menu, where you get one cocktail from each section for a total of $30 (otherwise drinks are $12 each).  This is worth doing, trust me; you'll want at least one of each.  Wilson's cocktails focus on the custom and the unusual, bordering on bizarre - nearly all of them involve house-made bitters, tinctures, and/or infused alcohols, and the combinations are truly unique.  The Truth Serum (involving Highland Park 12 and sasparilla bitters, among other things) and the Skull Island Sour (including Pampero rum, butterscotch tincture, and also sasparilla bitters) were some of the most unusual, crazy, challenging, fascinating cocktails I've ever experienced.  The Charlie Chan (with black tea-infused vodka) and Pinkerton (with Knob Creek, coffee syrup, and tobacco bourbon tincture) were true standouts for me - flawlessly balanced and spectacularly good.\n\nThe cocktail list at Wilson & Wilson is, for the moment, fairly limited - only 11 cocktails plus an additional 3 punches (designed to serve 4 each).  They plan to adjust the menu at least seasonally, with the punches changing more often, and perhaps rotating through some of the Bourbon & Branch drinks as well.  But the main menu entries will be available nowhere else - Bourbon & Branch won't offer them - so for the level of creativity offered Wilson is the only place you can find them.\n\nLike the Bourbon & Branch atmosphere, but looking for something even smaller and more unique?  The Wilson & Wilson Detective Agency is the place for you.\n\nI only recommend you ask for a seat at the bar until they figure out how to add footrests to the table seating, because after an hour or two, your legs are going to be a bit uncomfortable...", "author": "Don H."}

Each cocktail has no less than 5+ different kinds of flavors and ingredients, leaving even the most sophisticated palate befuddled. My cocktail was way too complex and each flavor didn't complement, but rather obscured, the other. \nI actually was really grossed out by my date's digestif \"Pinkerton\" cocktail (Knob Creek Bourbon, Coffee Syrup, Cranberry infused angostura orange bitters, Tobacco bourbon tincture). I don't know what they were thinking there but this cocktail does not work, in my humble opinion, and while infusing alcohol with tobacco may be neat in theory, that doesn't save the fact it smelled and tasted terrible. Worst still, my date told the bartender he didn't like it and the bartender just said, \"that's too bad\" and didn't offer to make him another drink instead. Wtf?\nNow, Bourbon And Branch has amazing, knowledgeable bartenders who make fabulous classic cocktails (my favorite being the Manhattan--best I've ever had).

And in this part of the Bourbon and Branch empire, you actually get to talk to the bartenders. I had a terrific scotch-based concoction called a \"Truth Serum\" that featured brown sugar cinnamon syrup and sasparilla bitters among other things. The smokiness of the scotch and the spicy bite of the cinnamon were a perfect match. I found myself sipping contently.  It was an excellent recommendation on my bartender's part. I also really loved the little touches, like having my own copy of the drink menu and the housemade ingredients. They really added to the overal experience. I definately want to go back and try either a punch bowl or a three couse menu. Wilson & Wilson is a great addition to the B&B family. I highly recommend it.", "author": "Nicole M."}

The detail is captivating and the menu exquisite.. dark, moody and mysterious - we should dress accordingly for our next visit ;)", "author": "Alex L."}

Just the right amount of sweetness.  Complex, with a honey aftertaste.  I will be back to get this again...", "author": "Mike C."}

Since it's really a bar-within-a-bar, you're still issued a reservation password and buzzed in through B&B's regular entrance, but after being ushered through a panel into the Wilson & Wilson Private Detective Agency, things are a tad brighter -- an envelope with your name discreetly written on the back flap awaits at your designated spot ... and the visibly favorable artisan-to-patron ratio reaffirms they're going to take good care of you. You can elect to imbibe cocktail by cocktail or choose a combination of three drinks from the Apertifs, Main and Digestifs sections on your menu for a flat rate (highly recommended). Then sit back, relax, and ponder this speakeasy's rich history and just who that Lorraine Wilson dame was. Then I double-dog-dare you to not speculate about what became of her. Oh, I'll be back. Maybe a fling with their Dark City punch next time will help me solve this case.", "author": "Gregor G."}

Wilson & Wilson did not let us down! I got the reservation online 6 days in advance (for a Wednesday night) which was fairly simple. We showed up at our designated time filled with carbs and starch (since most reviews warned of the strength of cocktails) - you can show up, however, up to 15 minutes after your reservation and be allowed in. Rang the bell, said the password, showed our ID's, and were escorted by a hostess in period costume to a door after winding through Bourbon & Branch. She unlocked the door, and locked us back in after showing us to 2 seats at the bar and handing us the \"case file\" menus. W&W is significantly smaller than B&B and The Library, which is perfect for a romantic evening. There are about 10 seats at the bar, about 5 small high top tables on the wall and 1 4-person bench table by the window. It was very quiet and laid-back. The decor was perfect and the jazz playing softly in the background suited it very well. We chickened out of the $30 flight and opted for individual drinks at $12 each. I ordered the Charlie Chan (Black Tea vodka, cloves, coconut marmalade and black pepper tincture - very adventurous and delicious) and the Hard Boiled (Old Tom gin, 100 proof apple brandy, cinnamon and orange peel - tastes like spiked apple pie). My boyfriend ordered the Pinkerton (Bourbon, orange peel, coffee tincture and tobacco tincture - tastes like a sophisticated bar) and the Phantom (don't remember the ingredients). He enjoyed the Pinkerton and I think I preferred the Hard Boiled. I felt nothing after the Charlie Chan, yet after 45 minutes of sipping on the heavy-handed Hard Boiled, I was a goner. In a good way! My boyfriend did complain of the bar seats, although I think this is more of a \"male problem\" since I was comfortable. It was also probably 80 degrees in the bar, which is warm after a few drinks. Downfall? You must leave after your 90 minute reservation, which is not much time to drink 2 - much less 3 - cocktails when it takes 5 minutes to wait on a bartender and another 5 for the drink to be made. Waiting isn't a problem, though, since the drinks are excellent and the environment perfect. We asked to go to the Library for me to finish my drink and they said yes. The Library is beautiful but quite loud and crowded after getting accustomed to a quiet space. The drinks are only $11 in the Library and are different from those offered in W&W. My boyfriend ordered 1 more drink here, something very ginger-y, and when we left a half hour later, we were both more-than-buzzed. A wonderful experience and we can't wait to go back!", "author": "Dallas K."}

We were greeted by the Bourbon and Branch host and asked to wait for a moment while he seated the party before us. As we patiently waited outside, 2 loud and oblivious parties butted in front of us. But oh well. We were led through B&B and into Wilson and Wilson. The feel was similar to B&B, but a little darker and quieter. A steady stream of people came through, but it was pretty quiet overall. I had read an earlier comment about how the chair sucked, and I would have to agree. Not comfy. However, the drinks made up for it. The bartender recommended 2 drinks that I absolutely loved -- Phantom and Charlie Chan. Both were on the sweeter side and had hints of spiciness to them. Brilliant. My friend at I marveled at the huge whiskey and bourbon selection. Might have to come back and give some of them a try!", "author": "Manisha M."}
