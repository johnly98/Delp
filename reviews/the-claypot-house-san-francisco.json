One special service they have is the small pot of soup they bring at the beginning for free (call it appetizer if you will) while you wait for your food. The soup is light with pork, carrots, bean curds, and yellow beans. For the clay pots, I've tried few different ones here before, and they were all pretty good. But the Taishan Yellow Eel (\u9ec4\u9cdd\u996d) is my go-to dish because I like Eels, and the dish bring back a nostalgic hometown taste.\n\nThe Service and Restaurant\nThe service in general is normal and good. The food comes out to table in a reasonable time. Out of all the time I've been there, I have yet to have a bad experience with their service. The restaurant quite spacious with good amount of room and lighting. There are different size tables to accommodate various party sizes.\n\nThe Menu and Price\nThere are a few places around the area that serves clay pot dishes, but not so much clay pot rice. The Claypot House is of a niche place that serves clay pot rice and have a good variety. Along with their clay pot rice, they also have Steamed Lotus Leaf Dishes, Taishan Specialty Dishes, and variety of Soups. Though the prices of these dishes are not what you would call cheap, I believe they are still reasonably priced.", "author": "Food W."}

Also got the duck here.\n\nLet's start out with the duck. For the sake of the review, I'm going to pretend I never got the duck. The meat was fine (maybe a little on the tough side) but the sauce was really bad. It was sweet and thick. Combining that with duck just didn't sit well. Maybe it's authentic, but I won't be getting this type of duck again.\n\nThe clay pots are mostly rice and some meat. Like others have mentioned 70/30 split is about right. The rice is somewhat seasoned with soy sauce and the sauce from the meat (definitely oily from the meat which is great!). The bottom has some of the crunchier rice pieces. It's not the same as the crunchy pieces in bibimbap and instead it's like a thin layer of hard rice. It wasn't great, but wasn't bad either. It did add a little uniqueness. Given that each clay pot was about 11 bucks, the price seemed fair too. The meat between the two clay pots were relatively the same and enjoyed both. \n\nIf you stick to clay pots and are ok with mainly eating rice 4*'s. Otherwise, might be a 2 or 3 star", "author": "Victor D."}

The place is in the heart of Richmond and among the growing Chinese neighborhood, surrounded by tons of other great Chinese restaurants. Just coming back from HK and craving for some crispy claypot rice, we chose to try this place out.\n\nOn a Sunday morning, this place was fairly busy - local Chinese family hanging out, young people chilling. The service was fast and good. We ordered Yuzu tea and red bean smoothie for drinks. Yuzu tea was good but red bean smoothie tastes weird and stale. We got bitter melon stew as vegetable - it was huge portion but cooking was mediocre. Ingredients look a bit unfresh and the taste is underwhelming and blend. Bitter melon was overcooked.\n\nFor rice, we ordered lotus leave wrapped lamp rice and yellow eel claypot rice. The lamb rice had an excessive amount of rice and the lamb was a bit hard to chew and came with too much fat - I thought lamb was supposed to be tender. The eel rice was probably the only memorable dish of the meal (and granted it's their must-order dish). This eel is not the Japanese type of Unagi eel - yellow eel is much smaller so it comes in tens and hundreds of them. Eel is super fresh and tender. Very umami. Rice is very crispy and blends perfectly with the eel juice. A bit oily though.\n\nI'd order the eel dish again but don't think would go back intentionally.", "author": "Shen Q."}

We came at around 6pm for an early dinner on a weekday, and there wasn't any wait. The restaurant is quite old and dirty on the inside, but the food definitely makes up for its appearance. \n\nI ordered the lamb stew claypot rice and my friend ordered the classic Chinese sausage/ bacon, porks ribs, and duck claypot rice. We ordered a portion for one, so that we could try two different ones. Each pot was about $10-12, and the portions were enough for two people for each pot (if you're a smaller eater like my friend and me). The waiters first gave us a soup that was free of charge, made with tofu skin and carrots. Since we were both freezing from walking outside, the soup definitely hit the spot. The claypot rices took around 10-15 minutes to make, and when it came to the table, I could smell the amazing aroma of the charcoaled rice and meats. The lamb stew pot came with a good amount of meat, and the rice was extra crispy. My friend's pot was more aromatic, with the fatty bacon and sausage seeping into the rice, but nonetheless, both were amazing. \n\nPro tip for first time claypot rice eaters: let the rice sit on the hot claypot for a while before trying to scoop it out of the pot! This allows for the rice to char and get crispy on the bottom. \n\nFor the amazing prices, the great portions, and a memorable childhood food, I will definitely be back!", "author": "Sandra S."}

The place looked promising, was not full and two servers.  5 parties came in after we were seated.  4 ordered before us and were served their food before we ended up being served.  Our wait for attention to order was 20 minutes another 30 before we were served.  In seeing the yelp reviews, we did not get the complimentary soup as all the other tables did.  The claypot spareribs in black bean sauce was okay, skimpy on the spare ribs and the rice on the bottom of the claypot was burned.  I mean black burned.  The seafood combo was pretty good, a nice kick of ginger in the sauce.  Now, I rarely expect friendly service, usually it is perfunctory and that is okay.

You can't go wrong with crispy charred rice mixed with meat. This restaurant does a good job with the clay pot. The meat to rice ratio was 1:1, had a good deal of charred rice that was not too burnt. In addition there was enough flavor as we did not need to add soy sauce. We ordered the #6, spareribs, sausage, all the basics. Highly recommend as the go to if it's your first time trying clay pot casserole.\n\nWe also ordered the bitter melon and beef. The bitter melon was extremely fresh. It was not too bitter, the texture was soft and grainy, indicating it isn't too young or old. Beef was soft and tender as well.\n\nThe last dish we ordered was the salt and pepper fish. The fish was also very fresh. The breading and fish was soft, airy and moist. However I found the seasoning to be a bit too salty.\n\nThey do provide you with a pot of chicken soup, free of charge. The soup had a bit too much msg and not enough natural chicken flavor.\n\nOverall great experience.

This place mainly serves claypot rice (duh, hence the name!).  You can choose the dish in different sizes : personal size, small size (serves 2-3 people), medium (3-4 people) and large (5-6 people).  You can order the meal in different sizes depending the size of your party. Even if you have a huge party, you can order the small size and order different ones so you can try the different varieties.

The minced meat was pretty flavorful, as was the preserved sausages and such!\n\nThe service was also pretty good--nothing bad I can point my fingers at.

This is the most authentic Toisan restaurant I have ever been to.  Actually, come to think of it, this is the ONLY Toisan restaurant I have ever been to.  I was saddened to hear that Taishan Cafe had closed down but I am thrilled that they opened this restaurant instead.  For those of you that visited Taishan Cafe, this one is like 100X improved.  At Taishan Cafe, I thought I was literally eating out of someone's garage but here there are actually tables and servers that actually come to take your order!  Now, if you're expecting five-star service, you won't find it here.  But, you will find truly authentic home cooked Chinese food like you've never had before.\n\nAlso for anyone who was not impressed by the complimentary soup, clearly just doesn't get it.  This is not meant to be gourmet food.  This is home cooked Chinese food like from your Toisan grandma's kitchen...if you had a Toisan grandma, like myself.  And that soup was legit.  So heartwarming and comforting on a cold windy San Francisco day.  Seriously it was perfect and transported me back to my grandparents' tiny little house in ghetto DC.\n\nThe claypots are pretty generous in size and are a must to order.  Basically, instead of ordering white rice, you would order a claypot or two and eat it as a dish but also as the rice to eat with anything else you order.  The bottom of the claypot always gets a nice crispy skin to enjoy at the end of the meal.  Our favorite of the claypots was the Taishan Chicken--it was smothered in green onions...which is basically the best herb ever.  We were super impressed by the other dishes that we ordered in addition to the traditional claypots:\n\n- Lamb Stew - really flavorful tender chunks of lamb and bean curd sheets (made from the soybeans that comprise tofu but are chewier and almost have the consistence of pasta) and lettuce. very generous portion and probably my favorite dish of the night.\n- Salt & Pepper Fish - fried crisp and delicious with a great pepper/garlic/salt flavor.  We originally ordered the S&P Tofu but apparently they ran out...I'm not really sure how that's possible since they offered us other tofu dishes but just couldn't make the salt & pepper tofu dish.  Anyway, we were perfectly satisfied with the substitute of fish instead.  Absolutely delicious.\n- Sweet Potato Leaves - I know it's just a veggie but it was still delicious.", "author": "Jess Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-26", "description": "My, how things have changed.  \nTai Shan Restaurant is the original name of this restaurant which was located across the street.  After a fire wiped the slate clean, they moved to this larger space and modernized everything, including their I-pad order system.  I used to frequent their satellite location on Cabrillo which closed and morphed to become Hakka Restaurant.  My parents enjoyed going there as parking was convenient and the owner/host was very personable and friendly at that time.  Now toting his I-pad, the owner is all smiles when he greets his guests and takes orders.  Here's what we shared on a recent Friday evening:\n\nPreserved meats and Chinese sausage rice (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=oOi6KjQxhbvEC3UKMaL3Yg) - Classic menu selection, this is the most common version of claypot rice that families order.  With the salted meats and crusty rice that sticks to the claypot, one of the better renditions that I've had.  Be sure to add their spicy soy sauce left tableside if you like a heavier flavor.\n\nDried scallop pork patty rice (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=6czl0qfB7ra8brv1iakXUQ) - The lightest and probably most healthy dish that we ordered for dinner.  Nothing really stood out as the dried scallop flavor was feint if at all existent.  Needed the spicy soy sauce to perk things up.\n\nLamb stew rice (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=SsxJajGvD06-qCsE7as_cQ) - The heartiest of the three rice selections that we ordered, the lamb was tender and not at all gamey.  Liked the Yuba pieces that infused the sauce flavor and mixed well with the rice.\n\nSteamed tofu with pork (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=jUKRmWoEeVPn7H3YHJWLsQ) - Another one of the healthier dishes that we ordered, this was just okay.  Our dinner hosts who are regulars here said that the portions shrank from before (seven pieces now versus nine or ten in the past).\n\nLotus root and mixed vegetables (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=WMOkuU7QB7Wlt55WWuMQwg) - Nice stir fry selection with a good variety of veggies including cauliflower (in season), wood ears, and snap peas.  There is Chinese sausage in this dish so it is NOT vegetarian by any means.\n\nPreserved vegetable and pork belly (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) -  Artery clogging good... no really, good in a delicious way, but not so sure whether my heart can take this, Elizabeth!\n\nThe above plentifully fed our party of four and there were no leftovers to be had.  They also served us a small gourd of house soup which consisted of veggies and pork pieces.  The restaurant was about half full when we arrived but filled when we left around 8 pm.  We happened to meet two gentlemen sitting at the next table who, like me, dined here for the first time.  When we struck up a conversation about the menu, we learned that we shared many dining experiences from growing up, living, and working in Chinatown during the '70's and '80's.  You could say that this place is a bit of a throwback to the food from that time. \nThe menu is pretty straightforward and they have seasonal specials like black bean snails when we were there.  Besides the traditional claypot rice, they also offer lotus wrapped rice dishes.  All of the above rice dishes had nice crispness to the bottom, though the rice above was a bit on the dry side.\nThe best description for this cuisine is Cantonese or Taishan comfort food.

Please don't complain if it takes long for your claypot to come. It requires time to cook rice, so if you have to wait 20-30 minutes for your food to come it's completely normal. Once the claypot comes, be careful! Everything is piping hot in there! Scoop some rice and add jalepno soy sauce into your rice and you'll be enjoying the best claypot rice in the Bay Area. I recommend ordering the claypot chicken rice and the claypot pork patty and salty fish, those are my top two choices. I love it when their rice is piping hot and in the bottom of the claypot, the rice is crunchy! They also have seafood, spare ribs, frog legs, etc. pick and choose what you like but don't expect it to come quick. I recommend this place to anyone who likes piping hot food, if you're not one of them, this might not be the place for you.

Yes it had flavor, but that just came from the duck sausage. Basically the dish tastes like duck sausage. Also they have me a jug of soup and I ladeled some in a cup to drink. When they served my dish they confiscated the not-empty jug of soup. I really wanted that soup, but I noticed too late. I'm writing this review as I wait for them to notice I'm done. It's been like 20 minutes. I'm just sitting here typing this review. This could be a fun game actually, where I just write terrible things about them until someone comes and helps me. I think you'll agree that it's only fair. So, what else. Some of their patrons are annoyingly loud and vapid to boot. Like, shut up about growing up Asian already, we all did it, you're not unique. Just like a millennial to expect attention for something so normal. So what your parents made you play the violin. Unless you're in an orchestra I don't want to hear about it. I wonder if I make eye contact this guy will come over and give me my bill. I mean, I bet I could just walk out of here and no one would notice. You know that old adage that the worse the service in a Chinese restaurant, the better the food? I found the exception to the rule. That sentiment has hereby been debunked. Not true. And who the f*ck serves toothpicks in a Parmesan cheese shaker!? These guys do. Also their chopsticks are this weird shade of orange. Like they were once bamboo but have petrified over the years. I mean, it's just not attractive. Get some fresh chopsticks. Oh man, the couple who came in some time after me just got their bill. They must know some secret that I am not privy to. Or maybe they're personal friends, but I doubt it since they look like they're from Minnesota and should be eating hot dish or whatever it is they eat up there. I just pushed my plate a little further away from me. Maybe that's the secret. No one's around to see it though, so I might be here a while. Strap on a seatbelt folks this ride might be longer than you expected. Crap the waiter just walked right by me like I'm not even here. Holy crap. Am I dead? Did I get food poisoning, pass out, and die? Am I doomed to haunt this joint for the rest of my life? What kind of special hell would that be? Haunting a restaurant, forever waiting for a bill that never comes? Knowing that my last meal was basically over-cooked duck sausage?  Well, isn't that special. The next table just got their jug of soup. I'm watching carefully, buster. Now I'll finally know if you confiscate soup jugs from everyone or just me. Man that lady has waaaay to much makeup on. I'm getting a stomach ache -- that must mean I'm still alive, right? Not sure if that's a good thing because I pretty much wish I was dead right now. Where's my goddamn bill?! Tick tock mother f'rs my time is money. My mind is on my money and my money's on my mind. Badum-chick! Thanks for the laugh folks I'll be here all night. Be sure to try the roast beef! (Because the duck sausage is questionable). Oh man their dishes came out and THEY STILL HAVE THEIR SOUP JUG. WTF. I was robbed. Just plain robbed. I want my soup dammit. You know what, I was gonna be generous and give you guys two stars but I'm just gonna have to change it to one at this point. Man that waiter Just. Won't. Make. Eye. Contact. Why so shy buddy?

Not surprisingly, things were a bit confused and unpracticed, so this review is going to overlook those sorts of things.\n\nBefore we ordered, a big crock of tofu skin / corn / chicken soup arrived. It was good -- simple, but nice enough. It wasn't very hot, though, a detail that I imagine the Health Department will ding them for before long.\n\nHot tea arrived, except that it, too, wasn't very hot. In fact, it was practically luke-warm. More interestingly, it was a pu-erh tea, not the usual Oolong you get in Chinese restaurants. I thought that this was a nice touch -- if you like pu-erh as I do. (Otherwise, one might just think that it's dirty-tasting tea.)\n\nWe ordered three things:\n\nSweet and Souse (sic) Chicken for the daughter unit. This was good enough for its genre. Simple, not too syrupy. Sweet and Sour Chicken just isn't my bag, though.\n\nTwo clay pots:\n#3 eel, frog & Chinese sausage, preserved pork and duck\n#6 spareribs, preserved Chinese sausage, pork and duck\n\nThese are generous portions of rice put into a super hot clay pot so that the bottom gets brown and deliciously crispy, with whatever meats and whatnot placed on top. They were both straight-forward, simple and enjoyable.\n\nThe three of us ate more than we needed and brought some home for $36, including tip. That may be the cheapest dinner in SF. \n\nBy my math, this meal earned a solid three stars+. Since it was opening day and because of the great value, I think they deserve a benefit-of-the-doubt and thanks-for-the-cheap-eats fourth star, at least for now.", "author": "Todd H."}

If you ever go there make sure you have a friend with you whom speaks Cantonese or Mandarin so you wont have trouble ordering. There are numerous times where I see people who doesn't speak Chinese having a hard time understanding the waiters or having trouble placing an order. Maybe that is the reason why they have pictures of the dishes on the menu. \n\nAlso don't mistake the big picture hanging on the wall as TaiShan in China that is actually a night view picture of HongKong from back in the 90s! I don't know why Chinese restaurants around the bay area who names their restaurant after a Chinese city always hang a picture of HongKong or Beijing? That is so so misleading. What if some of us really thought that is actually taishan and ended up going there and find out that Taishan is a small beat up village.... Imagine what a shock that will be....On the left side of the wall it has a chinese saying which translates to: You can try all the delicious cuisines around the world but your hometown cooking still tastes the best! I think I totally agree with this. \n\nNow move to the dishes, all their clay pots are good and if you are adventurous try the yellow eel clay pot, it is pretty good and also one of their big sellers.  The rice wrapped in lotus leaves are very good also a must try! No matter what you order the restaurant will throw in the soup of the day and some chicken feet, both taste greeeat!\n\nOverall a great place for some different style of Chinese food. You will either like this place or hate it. \n\nDon't be shocked that you might be the only none Chinese in this place and when this place is full it is LOUD! Chinese speaks loud but even louder when they speak in Cantonese! One last advice: during weekdays avoid going there during lunch time, apparently this place is filled with Taishanese contractors during lunch time, no offense but they are all wearing dirty work cloth and the smell of paint and sweat will totally ruin your appetite!

My mom ordered the preserved meats claypot which came with various meats and  the house special claypot (frog, eel and lap churng). I was definitely not a fan of it because there wasn't enough flavor. I had to add their spicy soy sauce (which they have on every table) in order to enjoy my meal. I didn't like the house special since I don't eat most of the stuff in that dish. My favorite part would be the crispy parts of the rice where it's on the side of the claypot.

Over 5 minutes passed and no sight of our check or any waitresses. Finally, the waitress passed by and we made eye contact with her. NOTHING...So I went up to her to request the check again. I think she finally realized that she forgot our check and apologized. \n\n2) Food is not as good as it used to be. We ordered #7 (Preserved Chinese Sausage, Pork, & Duck) and the eggplant fish clay pot. \n\nOur #7 looked okay...I guess, seemed like they skimped on the meat though. Not to mention it hardly had any taste. We used quite a bit of the spicy soy sauce just to taste something. Mmmmm msg and sodium. Nomz (sarcasm)\n\nThe eggplant fish clay pot was pretty good.

Located on the corner of Clement and 11th. \n\nWhen I first found out the old location was closed down, I was devastated. I kept asking myself and my bf, \"What happened? Why did it close down?!\" Even though he was totally clueless about it cause he's never been there. When I found out that it got \"rebranded\" and I found a new review for it, I thought \"Omg yay!! There's hope! Someone said it's newly open!\" After arriving, I was welcomed with the boarded walls and windows .. and now I was sad again. I looked around in hopes of finding a new place - nothing. I saw a restaurant a block away, on the corner of 11th and Clement, that looked brand new. I told my bf I wanted to check it out but all he wanted to do was leave and go to Gordo's. I got in the car and as I started to drive off, I drove by the new restaurant. I saw the name \"The Claypot House\" outside and I yelled in glee \"OMG! It's the claypot house!! This is their new location!!!\" Yayy!! IT LIVES ON! \n\nMy bf and I came on a Sunday night. There was plenty of parking in the area. The restaurant crowd was quite packed. My bf and I had to share a big table with another couple .. a little awkward but as long as we were seated immediately, we were fine. The decor inside the restaurant is the same as the old - same panorama pictures, same paintings. The difference compared to the old restaurant is, more big tables, so bigger seating area and bigger kitchen for the cooks. The service is good, because the owners are friendly and they always come around to check on you when they can. They have a waiting area outside. \n\nThe night I came for my visit, they were still using the old menu. According to one review I read, they're still currently working on the new one. Whenever I come here, I like to order the #1, Taishan Yellow Eel Claypot (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-claypot-house-san-francisco?select=FQNlqyiX-7LWxjqG9W9A7Q#KgNnNOlvsOoM37rJAJvXGQ) [~$13]. Like every other claypot, this dish consists of crispy rice mixed with soft rice. The crispy rice is normally on the outer layer where the claypot is. This dish also has the yellow eel and sausages. Mix it, stir it, and yum!! You got some foodgasm going on in your mouth! I don't like to add sauces to my food (yes, I'm weird), but my bf added the Jalapeno-Soy Sauce (it's in a container in the middle of the table) to his rice and he said it made it taste so much better. Before the main dish arrives, they also give you complimentary soup that has tofu, corn, and some other stuff (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-claypot-house-san-francisco?select=FQNlqyiX-7LWxjqG9W9A7Q#9-nGhMH82biT_s7oGJCgCA). It's simple and good. I think one claypot is good enough for 3-4 people. I ate half the claypot myself and was filled by the end of dinner; I saved the other half for the next day. :) \n\n***Because they're still currently new, CASH ONLY!!!. They're working on their credit card machine due to the move.   \n\nSide note: They have a mini-bar (not an area for seating) that serves beer!

I would definitely recommend going there with someone who can speak the lingo, as it helped a ton with getting just their attention. We arrived there last Sunday night around 7.30pm and there was a line out the door, although nowhere to put our name down. There seemed to be only one lady running around to take names down, although it took us a good 15 minutes to get her attention, as she was the only one taking orders too. Seemed very disorganized. \n\nHad a couple of clay pots - the eel was great and so was the Chinese sausage with pork/duck- very traditional ingredients. While the prices seemed reasonable, there was a fair amount of bone so not as filling as it could be. We wanted dessert but despite having about 15 things on the menu, they only had 2 things when we asked about it. Despite the restaurant being about half full by the time we finished, we had to chase them to ask for service, the dessert menu and the bill. \n\nI haven't been to any other clay pot restaurants, but I'd rather check out other places before coming back here.", "author": "Lisette P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-07-22", "description": "The food served here is very close to the authentic \"Toishan\" clay pot rice in Canton, China.  They cook the rice from scratch inside the clay pot so you end up with a nice crispy burnt layer of rice at the bottom which tastes wonderful by adding soup.  You end up with something similar to the Northern China dish \"sizzling rice soup\".  Most of the other food items they offer are also close to the \"Toishan\" authenticity.  So food wise, I have no complaints.  BUT, I have run into more than one occasion where price gouging is a problem with this restaurant.  On one occasion, I ordered the Pig's Feet in Vinegar for takeout and upon pick up, I inquired if there's an egg inside, and I was told that yes there's one egg but I could add additional eggs if I want to.  So I ask to add one egg to the order.  This dish was originally promoted on the window as $5.75 but my bill came out to $6.95 without adding the egg.  With the addition of the egg, I was billed $8.95.  Hmm, $2.00 more for a hard-boil egg.  Ok.  I won't order the next one with the egg addition...  Today, I ordered another take-out dish:  steamed pork patty with preserved veggies on top.  When I picked up the dish, I was charged $16.40 and when I stated that it's pretty expensive, the person looked at the menu and promptly charged me $14.00 instead.

The rice on the bottom is still as crunchy as I have remember it to be. I always like eating the crunchy rice bits. For some reason, I felt like the spareribs were a bit under cook than the usual.

After attempting to flag down our server several times, we finally walked to the kitchen and made the order there. We only had an hour so by the time the food showed up - 30 minutes later (again, after walking to the kitchen to inquire) - we had only a few minutes to eat. \n\nThe food itself was very so-so. We had beef clay pot and crispy green beans. The crispy green beans were the best of the two. The beef clay pot had pretty good flavor but the meat was extremely fatty and full of gristle. Rice didn't arrive until we were almost done with the meal which is probably a good thing as it was very dry. I would have liked some hot sauce but, knew it would take another 20 minutes so passed.\n\nIt's not important to me but, In terms of decor this restaurant has none. It is very cluttered and messy but again, it's Chinese food on Clement, this is pretty much the norm from my experience.\n\nOverall, the food was nothing special, it wasn't particularly inexpensive, and the service was horrendous.
