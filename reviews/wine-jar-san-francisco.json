Our choices ran from a glass at $11 to a bottle around $120. Something for every taste, right?  We started with some sparkling wines; mine was a prosecco that was not sweet at all.  So much for past experience and stereotypes!  This prosecco I would classify as brut and it was delicious!  \n\nRound two for me was a barbera and, oops, here came the substitution. But the sommelier or bartender or wino authority in the back room obviously had taste!  Smooth is only the beginning of this wine. It had legs and body and no aftereffects. Except maybe I'm a little tipsy now; there's a reason I observe a 2 drink limit these days. \n\nConversation around our table was congenial  and intimate. Conversation at a nearby table sounded like a first date. This brought me to reflect that even in my single years, I was not a dater.

I offered him to pay 50 cents extra plus a generous tip. I just didn't want to pay $15. He told me that he was going to charge me $15. or I had to pay with cash. i tried to ask him nicely to help me out, but he told me to pay 15 NOW. i reminded him that by law the minimum was $10 - which was my bill and he was violating the law. He went on to forcefully take the card from my hand without even giving me a second to react. i said, \"don't charge $15\" he told said 'GET OUT' read rude tone. A girl standing by got so freaked out by his rudeness that she looked at me empathizing and left. I needed my card so I waited. Then he gave me the card and receipt and shouted.

He also knows his wine, for when we asked him for suggestion, he gave us some pretty amazing choices. I had a glass of their Sauvignon Blanc and that time it was from New Zealand. It was really good and tasted like the wine you get when you go to wineries. My friend had a Malbec which was from Argentina and it was full of flavor! My friend and I were both happy with our glass, and take note, there were actually half-full!! \n\nBesides those two amazing wines that we have, they also offer other kinds of wine.

Being a wine enthusiast I have been waiting for a cheap wine place like that to take my friends to, so they can relax and enjoy my favorite liquid with me without stressing out. The dark romantic, and trendy decors, in a dimly lighted room, some small tables, lounge couches, and a bar with counter, the inside is much more glamorous than the poorly decorated outside: just the title and one string of xmas lights. \nThe thing that has changed my view completely is that I have several bad experiences with the service:\n\n1. my significant other and i stood in the door way for 10 minutes and watch the waitress go back and forth but never acknowledge our existence (this was the last straw, i haven't been back ever since). And we understood why an elderly couple just walked out before we arrived without ordering anything. \n\n2. Several times i observed the waitress is obviously too swamped by the full house to be in a good mood or serve us with smiles\n\n3. Once/twice the menu was threw on the table when we were seated.\n\nThis is still a neighborhood spot, and often a full house on the popular weekend nights. And that says something about the price and the atmosphere for relaxing wine, pressure free. But at the same time that neighborhood lingering love made the bad service situation even worse. \n\nAnd yes, I am a neighbor only 4 blocks away, yet i would drive to north beach looking for parking for 30 minutes to find another wine place. Don't forget, price, setting aside, wine is in every way a service experience, good service is key to get people to enjoy wine and order more. The thing Ilove the most about wine is to enjoy it over conversations with good friends, not having my mood ruined by bad service, and worse yet, not being seated in the first place", "author": "Dilys S."}

The bartender/manager Tyler (he said he was the manager,  when asked) chased us out of the bar when we decided not to patron the establishment due to Tyler's hostile attitude.

When my partner and I decided we did not want to contribute to the establishment due to his aggressive demeanor, he decided to chase us outside. I filmed the entire ordeal because I was worried he was going to get physically violent. I'm writing this review because I am shocked at this horrible/un-nerving experience and hope the owners are aware of the type of employee they are currently employeeing. This type of attitude will surely drive away business. We will never be back and will be more than happy to warn others about our experience there. \n\nNo one should be treated so poorly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-11-06", "description": "After going to Fat Angel and seeing a crowd outside huddled over a table, shivering with their wine glasses in tow, I bravely walked into Fat Angel and requested a table for two. I looked around and it was packed. All I wanted was a glass of wine. And some cheese. The bartender looked and me and nicely informed me that there'd be a 20 minute wait. \n\nI managed a smile, which was both forced and sad. I Yelp'ed nearby places and was fill with optimism when I saw that Wine Jar was only a few blocks away.\n\nIt was a cute place and possibly the nicest, most elegant wine bar I've seen yet. Whoever did the interior did a fantastic job. It is sexy, dark yet you can manage to see your date, and it was lush. There were some private seating areas that could be blocked off with the somewhat velvet-y curtains. \n\nWe chose the couch in the middle and sat down. \n\nA nice gentleman with a vest asked us if we were ready. We said yes and proceeded to order some glasses. \n\nThings went downhill after we got our glasses. I noticed that there were a few tables open and one of the private seating areas was open, but a group of 4 came in and stood there -- obviously it was their first time - not knowing if they should sit down or wait to be seated. They stood and lingered near the doorway for about 4 minutes. Given the fact that the place is so intimate and there were two servers that night, making your patrons linger around is really not the way to go in the food industry.\n\nAfter looking at the menu, i decided I wanted to try their cheese ($11 for one selection, $16 for 2). I went to the bar after looking around for about 5 minutes - no one had bothered to check up on us - and encountered a guy with blonde hair who just stood there - behind the bar -  staring.  In the process of wondering if he was working or just another patron, we just had a staring contest. He never asked, 'Hey, can i help you?' or 'What would you like?'  I made a safe bet that because he was behind the bar - he was likely working there.  i asked if i could order some cheese and he just nodded. \n\nI told him what I wanted and I'm not sure if he didn't want to work that night or if he was just having an 'off' night - but I regretted ordering anything. When he came to give us our cheese, he practically threw it down on the table. I'm sorry, did we offend you? Usually, the servers will tell you which cheese is which...but here, the servers are way beyond that. The attitude and lack of any sort of hospitality that is custom in the restaurant industry is just laughable here. \n\nWhile both cheeses we ordered were good, the wafers/psuedo crackers it came with were bland..with no sort of texture or anything. i felt like I was eating solidified air if there was such a thing.  How about some bread? The plate was filled with nuts and olives..both of which I don't like on my cheese plate. \n\nIf anything - he is an expert credit card swiper. I've never given anyone my credit card and within seconds, had everything handed back to me to sign.", "author": "Vanessa W."}

While it is conveniently located in our neighborhood, we would come here regardless for the wine, cozy yet chic ambiance and great service. \n\nThey have a pretty good selection of red and white wines as well as sparkling wine. We are big fans of the Russian River Pinot Noir and any of the three sparkling wines they currently offer. With an almost \"Cheers\" type of feel, Jeff (the bartender) always has a glass of the Pinot poured for us when we walk in. Of course, when they add a new red or we are in the mood for something else, he's quick to offer recommendations including some tastings. \n\nFriday nights can be busy with pre-show drinkers given its close proximity to Kabuki - but, do not fear - while you may have to wait for a chair, you won't wait long for a drink.  Wednesday and Thursdays are a little more relaxed, making this a great place for happy hour. Their cheese plates are delicious (including four different types of cheeses, olives, and crackers) and they also allow you to bring food in from a few nearby restaurants (e.g., Out the Door). This is great when happy hour extends into dinnertime! \n\nWhile we have never reserved the entire bar for the night, we have hosted a few large-group events. Jeff makes sure to reserve an area appropriate for our sized group and is very attentive to our guests. As one reviewer mentioned, Jeff has the perfect balance of checking in - making sure you have a drink and anything else you may need - but not hovering.  Come bill time, Jeff is so organized that he helps minimize those awkward conversations at the end of the night around who owes what. \n\nAside from Jeff, we have found the other bartenders/servers to be just as personable. - making the Wine Jar a place you feel welcome and want to return to.", "author": "Shelley O."}

Then the bar had no lime or lemons for our designated driver's sparkling water.  Odd for a bar, even a beer & wine place only, but whatever...not a biggie.  All in all, the general impression of the group was that the service & space do not warrant the prices.  \n\nFast forward a few months, and livingsocial prompted us to give the place another go (well, nobody was going to pay full price to give it another go, but it WAS in the neighborhood, and it'd be so nice & convenient if the last time was just an off day).  Purchased the voucher.  And let it expire.  As per state law, the paid portion of the voucher is apparently valid for 5 years, and I've had other merchants honor it for that amount.  But not these guys.  They just outright said that they had stopped accepting them, and I should deal with livingsocial from here on.  He wasn't rude about it, but the message was loud & clear that they were not going to honor what was apparently the law here.

And I do *not* recommend it to *anyone.*\n\nYou gotta just shrug your shoulders, tho; when two 19-year olds get married, and half the guests are underage, you can be sure that the reception is going to be serving cool glasses of... juice.  And foaming bottles of... Martinelli's sparkling cider.  Sodas.  Mineral water.  SIGH.\n\nNeedless to say, by the time Rachael J. and I got out of there we had a powerful thirst, and it wasn't for no damn mineral water.  Not unless it had Scotch in it.\n\nThe ceremony had been at Grace Cathedral and the reception in the Fairmont penthouse (yeah, and no booze--what a waste), so we were pretty close to Union Square, which, while it has many places to drink, is also chock-a-block with those tubby narwhales we all know as \"tourists.\"\n\nI hate drinking with tourists.\n\nSo, after a little consultation to determine what neighborhood would be appropriate for two nattily dressed people to go and get a little tipple on (i.e. \"not the Mission\"), we headed over to the Fillmore.\n\nNeither of us knew that 'hood very well, so I SMS'ed a friend of mine: \"yo, what's a good place to drink in the Fillmore?\"\n\nJust as we walked into The Wine Jar and were sitting down, my friend texted back:  \"I don't drink in the Fillmore, there's nothing there but bourgeoise wine bars.\"\n\nBa da bing.\n\nThe Wine Jar had a sandwich board outside advertising 20% off bottles during happy hour, so in we went.\n\nHonestly, despite being a wine bar (and thus, by definition, totally bourgeoise), The Wine Jar really struck a chord with me and Rachael J.  Mellow, low volume music, numerous places to sit, all with their own character and comfortable, and just generally relaxed--not snooty or \"superior,\" as some of these places can be.\n\nThe 20% discount helped, and we found a nice red from Santa Barbara for $38 before the discount, tasty and a bottle of wine is a great way to knock back a few without having to get up and order anything else for a while.\n\nAll in all, it was a lovely stop.  Maybe a 100% markup on the wine, but like I said, the 20% discount took some of the pain out of the exchange; this would be a really nice date spot.  They even had a giant goblet full of chocolate candies (hello miniature Mr. Goodbar!).

I didn't end up waiting at Wine Jar but went one Monday night after dinner at SPQR.\n\nTrue, Monday nights aren't particularly busy but the place was very empty (only 2 other people there), and there was no music or any other ambient noise. It made for a slightly odd experience since I could hear every word uttered by the other patrons and waitstaff. My friend and I huddled in the seating area closest to the door (and furthest from everyone else in the bar) and talked in hushed voices - not because we had anything particularly secretive to share but that it was just an awkward and not terribly relaxing environment. Based on the other reviews I've read, I must have arrived near closing time since there was no music at all.\n\nWe just stayed for a glass of wine (they were closing early and had us leave by 10:30 or so). I found the by the glass menu to be relatively limited but decent enough for a quick catch up and the wait staff to be pleasant.

I do commend you on defending your staff, however your facts are not straight. Not only does Jena cry wolf, but she also makes false claims herself. First, if it was 11:15pm then why was it last call when the business hours are until midnight? It took us at least 10 minutes to get served so if he input our order after we ordered maybe it was a few minutes past 11pm, give or take it was still around 11pm when he informed us that we could only order 1 glass. 2nd, we were only given the option of having 1 glass so we both drank our glasses slow....even then I was still rushed out when I was asked to close the bill while my glass still had wine it. This was well before midnight because you confirm that the 3 other patrons at the bar were allowed to drink as long as they were out by midnight. Thanks for the confirmation. 3rd, if my review is riddled with falsehoods then why are there countless reviews from other yelpers that confirm my review of how rude your bartender is??? Do we all have it out for your bartender or is it a reflection of him??? Are you insinuating that we are all liars?\nLaura, Lydia, Soph, Jane to name a few. Maybe it is a conspiracy theory. Just read below and the reviews speak for themselves. How many reviews will it take before it is addressed? What's the magic number? 4th, in an effort to undermine my review you blatantly state that I left a 75 cent tip (who's crying wolf now?) with nothing but malicious intent, suggesting that I needed it more than you do. Can you say - \"shoot myself in the foot?\" No wonder your staff has this attitude...it seems like it mimics the owners. I actually left $4 and some change for 2 glasses of wine at $24 (I paid cash dear so if there is a small tip from another customer's receipt then you obviously know why) even though the service warranted a ZERO tip. Tips are not automatic, they are earned...this is the nature of the beast of the service industry...come on you should know this already. 5th, I worked in the service industry during undergrad and I'm sorry Jena, your bartender is a prime example of how NOT to provide customer service. Your place lives and dies by its service...not just the products you offer. 6th, do not close the register when you still have customers inside the place and it is still during normal business hours, that is saved for after closing....hence the term closing.

Inside is cozy and I can see it getting almost too crowded at night. I'm guessing  the bar also morphs into a cougar/puma mating zone, so beware!\n\nThere are a couple of outdoor tables, and I believe there's a nice happy hour discount in the early evening. Fillmore Street is also one of the great avenues for people-watching, so I'd recommend stopping in on a weekend afternoon to witness passerbys stroll/strut on by.

I lean towards a more divey atmosphere, and being on the upper Fillmore stretch, it caters to the Pac Heights clientele, but it's tolerable during the week.  \n\nBackground music and incessant chatter make for a noisy environment, so it's not the greatest place for an intimate conversation.  But even with a bustling crowd, the cute server had a knack of keeping tabs on everyone, knowing just when to come around so you're not waiting too long for another glass or feeling rushed to finish your drink already in hand.  \n\nI can't speak much towards the selection.  Though I've tended towards drinking wine over hard liquor this year, I am still just as clueless at deciphering the different types of wines and regions as I was before.  What I do know is what I like, and Wine Jar serves some tasty wine.  (Then again, I'm not hard to please on the alcohol front.)  In addition to their 1/2 glass, glass, and bottle offerings, they also serve a number of beers.  Food wise, there are cheese plates to help tide you over.\n\nBottom line, it's a choice spot to unwind after work for a drink or two with friends before heading elsewhere.", "author": "Marsha Z."}

Comfortable seating with several spaces for groups to congregate, well-chosen colors and low lighting make it classy and cozy.  \n\nWhile they don't have an overly extensive wine list, the two relatively large groups I came here with never ran out of things we liked.

Muted tones and low light set the mood for a date or a relaxing evening with a few friends.

And they have a really, really fabulous menu of obscure and amazing mostly-California wines. A handful of imports, but the strength is in the domestic juice like T-Vines Zinfandel and Zapaltas Syrah. The interior is the now-standard warm brown floors, walls, ceiling (okay, I'm getting a little tired with this BROWN thing in this city -- there ARE other colors with which to decorate!) but comfy settees and low-to-the-ground leather chairs were inviting enough. And the mix of 80s New Wave and Moby music was a tad too loud for comfortable conversation; not a bad mix, just a bit too much.\n\nThe main detraction? There are only two cheeses currently available on the menu and each one is $9.00 (I'd like a selection and perhaps multiple cheeses on one plate, please). And sorry, whatever the two cheeses were, they were pretty forgetful. I have to believe that Saturday was their first day as it took almost 15 minutes to get those cheese plates and when they arrived, one could only assume the cheese (and mushy olives) had been stored in the freezer. It took several additional minutes before the cheeses were at an edible temperature. And Saltine crackers? Puleeze...\n\nWe chatted with one of the guys working there who indicated he was a consultant (versus an owner, I assume) and he agreed that there are some things which need tweaking. We talked about the great quality of their wine list as well as the need to fix the cheese course. They seemed to get a lot of business on Saturday; we were one of the first parties in and the bar was quickly filling up.\n\nBut one other point of contention which I noticed; one of the servers behind the bar was pouring a glass for a customer and needed to open a second bottle to complete the pour; the server did NOT check the newly opened bottle for cork taint before adding it to the partially-poured glass. For a wine bar, this is a major indiscretion. With the exception of two plates of cheese, there is only one product being served and it better damn well be good. Not checking for flaws before service is a big faux pas.\n\nOf course I'll go back and hopefully become a regular. But I also hope they see these notes...", "author": "Carolyn T."}

First, it's long overdue that a Wine Bar situates itself on Fillmore street....especially after a nice meal at Jackson Fillmore, La Med, or Fresca. This place is exactly what I have wanted. A nice, cozy place, not overrun with pretentious people, rather small groups just looking to chill and chat over a glass of Bordeaux. \n\nThe place has a great dark lounge-esque ambiance. The wine selection is pretty good, and the people working there are really friendly. But let me explain to you exactly why I gave it 5 stars...\n\nSo a group of us is sitting there, enjoying a glass of red wine from the Alsace region, and chit chatting about life. Apparently someone told a joke because my friend sitting next to me laughs really hard and slams her glass down thinking she's drinking beer or something. The stem of the glass breaks and somehow all the wine gets all over my shirt.  In a split second, one of the bartenders yanks me by the hand and take me outside, only to start spraying this Wine-away spray all over me. \"It works great....just wash it when you go home and it'll all be gone\". I look like a moron with my arms spread out while some dude is spraying stuff all over me. But lo and behold, the next morning when I took the shirt out of the dryer, it was CLEAN! Amazing. It worked.....and I owe it all to the bartender!!! Thank you Mr. Bartender, if you're reading this review. You da man!\n\nI'm definitely going back...hopefully without getting wine spilled all over me. But then again, even if it DOES, I know I'm safe!", "author": "Samir P."}

It can get crowded quickly, but we hit a nice pause at about 8PM, a little late for the after-work crowd, and a little early for the night-lifers.  \n\nI had the Argentinian blend, which was quite good, and she had the Syrah, with no complaints.  We ordered a plate of Manchego, which comes with crackers, nuts, and olives.  The crackers reminded me of ice cream cones, the cake kind, but not sweet.  The nuts were salty, and sadly no napkins were forthcoming.  \n\nIt was a bit loud with all the carousing of the group at the couches and the Radiohead on the speakers.  Wouldn't have an intimate conversation here, but it is lively.\n\nOverall, this place serves its purpose well.

The wine was served at the right temperature and the beer had a good foamy head on it. I had intended to email the establishment first before posting this but they do not have email on their website so here is my review.  My boyfriend and I went yesterday to have drinks after reading several favorable reviews. I was very disappointed.  The one thing that would have made this place a 5 star was the service. The bartender demonstrated the height of unprofessional behaviour.  He was the only staff person there and besides us & his friend at the bar, there was only one other party that was getting ready to leave.  We received no greeting or acknowledgement when we arrived, he didn't come over to take our order until we initiated getting up ourselves to place the order.  He talked loudly with the person sitting at the bar and divulged all sorts of information, dishing on friends, talking about the screenplay he was writing, talking about his roommate situation, it just went on.  He and his friend were eating at the bar and dropping f*&k bombs every few sentences. We decided to order a cheese plate and have another drink, even though I was ready to leave, my boyfriend didn't want to search out another place.  Again, we got up to place our order and only then did he come by.  Later another couple walked in and I watched the same poor service play out.  No greeting, no walk to the table until they started to get up to do so themselves.

This wine bar is a true wine bar in the sense that they concentrate on the wine and not so much on the food - in fact, for food, they basically only have a cheese plate.  But, have no fear, they permit you to order food into the bar and enjoy it while you drink delicious wine.  They even have menu suggestions.  The first time I went, we did not eat or order, but we had a wonderful rioja.  The bartender recommended the rioja and it was really good.  I even bought a few bottles when I got back to NYC!  I went back recently (a year later), and found that although they not longer served the rioja, they had a lot of other great wines.

Wine Jar is located in what I would describe as a mini-strip mall on Fillmore (I think it's jammed between a nail shop and a florist). When the arctic winds aren't blowing up from the water, there are usually a few tables sprinkled around in front. I have never seated myself out there, so I can't make an accurate comment on what the service is like should you choose to take in a little fresh air with your fortifications. Wine Jar's menu is fairly extensive when it comes to non-snobby establishments such as this. They even have a decent selection of beers. As far as wine goes, I have tried several but find myself going back to the Twenty Rows 2006 Merlot and the Maramonte 2005 Syrage. At first, the service at Wine Jar might seem a little lacking since the staff doesn't get right up in your grill the second you sit down. The atmosphere at Wine Jar is very laid back, and they give you some time to settle in, make a decision and get the conversation going. If for some reason you are in a time crunch, you can go up to the bar yourself or politely get the attention of someone who works there. Wine Jar is not a good place for a large group unless you plan on renting the entire place out. It's a great place to bring a date if you don't mind sitting close to each other to hear and talk over the music, or a couple friends before heading off to dinner. There are a few lounges that accommodate 'larger' parties, otherwise there are a few small tables and the bar. The first time I went to the Wine Jar I fell in love with it because every song they played could be found on my own iPod. It turns out they just run a certain Pandora station, but I wasn't disappointed, as long as they kept up the jams. Heavy on the rotation were The Killers, Modest Mouse, Death Cab, etc. They do have a happy hour, but I'm never out of work in time to enjoy it, so I can't help you out there. So, WIne Jar is a great place to start the night but don't plan on it being your only stop, or if you plan on having a low key evening, you could easily pass a few hours there.", "author": "Breanna L."}

I can't even picture Trio Cafe anymore...dark grey walls, black and chocolate brown leather furnishings, black granite bar top, very sleek yet still cozy; not cold at all.  Good lighting.  VERY important to have good lighting.\n\nThe owner(one of the owners?), Cameron, was our bartender and he was quite knowledgeable, friendly and conversational.  The wine was delicious.  We were offered as many tastes as necessary to determine which one we each wanted.\n\nI agree with another Yelper that this neighborhood needed this.  And with another Yelper that gives 4 star automatically to ANYONE who gets a business opened in this town...it's tough out there people!\nEven though the neighborhood needed this, they have to be GOOD to keep my business.  Wine Jar is.", "author": "Jill C."}

The T-Vine Zinfandel, mentioned in a couple of reviews already, was excellent...much nicer than the pricier Chateauneuf-du-Pape we also tried. French wine, PAH!\n\nIt's very small, I imagine it probably gets very cosy indeed at the weekend...not necessarily a bad thing.", "author": "James B."}

Large glasses of wine small snacks and great atmosphere- depending on when you go the shrieking level of voices can be high, thats when you just order another and after a few glasses you are the loud one.", "author": "Sarah C."}

AND that ppl actually came IN HERE to enjoy the other person's company ... unlike nectar, you can come in here with casual attire and be comfortable ... \n\nthe service was a bit slow, and there wasn't a whole lotta folks to begin with ... the place is cute and small, and they offer a fair amount of wine in 3 simple selections: 1/2 glass, a reg glass and a bottle .. i also loved how the interior had this earthy tone making it comfy ... and LAST BUT NOT LEAST, i have to say, i was really happy with the selection of music ... they PLAYED movie scores, and one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE ARTISTS... *dun dun dun* E-N-Y-A! most ppl can't appreciate enya, but i do ... and that made my experience SO much better ...\n\nooo ... how it soothes the soul ...\n\njust needs a lil bit of work, then it'll be all good ...", "author": "Jennifer S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-04-03", "description": "Every neighborhood needs a wine bar, and lucky for Filmore Street they got a good one!  The wine list is nice and seems to have something for everyone... although better descriptions of the wines would be great, they were a bit vague.  But the vagueness wasn't so much a problem because the staff seems very knowledgeable and even gives you a generous taste if you're unsure about your choice.  The ambiance is great... very stylish and I like the zig-zag bar.  I also love the artwork, which I'm assuming is local and possibly will change.  My only other complaint, and this is a minor one, would be for them to expand their snack menu and offer a better cheese assortment.  Although we didn't order bites ourselves, someone next to us did and the presentation looked a bit lacking.  The owner himself, Cameron, served us and was very friendly and eager to please.  He has done a fantastic job with the space and with all this taken into consideration I will be back for a repeat visit.", "author": "Ms. M. M."}

This is a great place to catch up with a friend and enjoy an opportunity to lounge with a glass of wine.  The wine selection is abundant and the bartenders have excellent recommendations if you tell them what you like.  Sparkling, red, white, dessert wine, beer . . . you can find it all.   It's a pretty small place but there is comfortable seating to accommodate any size group, although I think it is more suitable for small groups.  If you want to have a mellow night and enjoy a place where you can actually carry on a conversation, this is a great option.", "author": "Brenna C."}

Between Planning, DBI, Community Out Reach, ABC, and City Hall as a whole, anyone trying to open a business now starts out with 4 stars.  I like the charming and polite people that work there as opposed to the attitude you get everywhere else in the City.  My wife LOVES the wine list and she's a total wine snob.  I LOVE the small intimate space and when it gets crowded, Wine Jar reminds me of all the tiny joints I hang out in in London.  I wish this place the best of luck and will support it with all I've got.  This place is a rarity in the City.", "author": "Frank B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-06-02", "description": "The Wine Jar is a classy and hip place to enjoy a glass of wine. It's clear that the owner is a pro at the business, and has taken every little detail into account when designing this place. The dark floors and dim lighting offer a very intimate setting and although the place is not very large, it is stocked with a great selection of domestic and imported wines and beer. The staff is very knowledgeable and attentive. On Friday and Saturday nights you will find an upscale professional crowd . It's a great pace to grab a drink before or after dinner on Fillmore.   I've been here two weekends in a row and will surely return.", "author": "Bryan B."}
