I went here with my friend about two weeks ago, she used to go here frequently (but doesn't plan on going after our experience).

We ordered two cups (for $7 total!), and the barista proceeds to put down the jar of loose leaf black tea that she was holding from a prior customer and pick up a ziplock bag with ~3 tea bags inside.  We couldn't see what type it was at first, and we were handed two cups with boiling hot water (way too hot for green tea, this type of water makes the tea bitter and ruins it) and tea bags with the labels hidden/tucked in a second cup.  It turns out the bags were from Twinings, a very cheap tea and you could get a whole box for the price charged for one cup at Hole in the Wall.  \n\nAt $3.50/cup, please inform your customers when you run out of your regular tea rather than giving them an exceedingly poor quality substitute  so they have a chance to order something else or save their money.

It's real good and worth a try if you're in the area.\n\nNow, unnecessary story time.\n\nSo here I am, arriving in Chinatown this previous Saturday at 8:30am in the morning when I have lunch plans with my friend at noon. I feel like grabbing a cup of coffee before situating myself on a nice reclining chair at my grandmother's apartment to take a nap. I suddenly remember passing a hole in the wall coffee shop about a month prior. I find it where I left it and silently giggle to myself as I realize that it's legitimately named Hole in the Wall Coffee. The name fits quite nicely since it's like a janitorial storage room for an apartment complex with a hole drilled through the outside to be repurposed as a coffee shop.\n\nI'm not a big fan of pour over coffee as opposed to espresso based drinks, but I'm already here so I order the brunette which is the dark roast. The one barista here does the pour over process in front of you and is very amiable to talk about where the beans are from and what not. There was no line when I first got here but by the time my drink was ready, there were possibly 15 people standing around this little coffee shop so it can start to get busy. There's a couple of chairs on the sidewalk to sit on, but not much. On a little table outside, they have the typical creamers, sugar, and syrups to add to your coffee (including almond milk). \n\nNow that I've wasted two paragraphs of your time and energy, I now drink the coffee and as Emeril Lagasse likes to say, \"BAM!\". It is strong, but oh so good. The dark roast is truly dark as I could really feel the caffeine running through my veins far more than I would from an espresso. I got back to the apartment in Chinatown and that nap was impossible to get. I've managed to fall asleep in bumpy swervy car rides, standing up in the shower, and once in a loud booming rock concert, but this coffee kept me up until the great caffeine market crash of 1pm. I'm lying there in this reclining chair, staring into the deep dark abyss of my $3.50 cup of coffee, deep in thought about the perplexing existence and nature of Javascript while texting my college roommate about kdramas I never watched and how his friend he always buttdials is doing.

Very good, and neat concept for the storefront! Their beans are based on Kenya coffee, which is my favorite (except for Yemeni beans, which are hard to find). Had to skip getting a coffee when the barrista ran out of the hole in the wall, leaving customers stranded (and I was in a rush). Must be hard to not have backup to help, to get more change, etc. But, it is something to be aware of for customers. (minus one star)\n\nThey are basically selling coffee made with the same process that the Chemex has been making available since the 1940s (and the filters make the difference), but only now is being 'discovered' via Philz, Blue-bottle, etc.\n\nPrice is way reasonable (around $3.50).

She was cheerful and knowledgeable about the coffee and the surrounding area. We tried the Red Head and the North Beach with a little almond milk and no added sweeteners.
