Creamy and rich and so smooth.\nThey're a little hard to spot from the street, as there's no large sign or markings.

Of course, it was our first time and we only tried one antipasti - the eggplant, which was good and could actually make a main course given its size, and two pasta dishes. \n\nAs for the two pasta dishes we tried, the ravioli sauce is a tomato cream sauce. I'm more of a real tomato sauce fan rather than cream sauce as the cream sauces tend to grow \"old\" quickly as you eat them (i.e., too much / too rich).  The house made pasta with pesto sauce was our second dish. Again, generally speaking pesto sauce is good, but when you have a whole, large dish of it, it also becomes too much. \n\nDesserts - affogato and sorbet, good, but once again, too large for our tastes.  \n\nNow, I will admit, we live in Tokyo much of the year and truly, it is very, very difficult to beat the quality of Tokyo's many Italian restaurants. There are a few restaurants in San Francisco that can match or better those Tokyo restaurants, but unfortunately, Manzoni is not one of them. Portions at Manzoni are too large; we've found, over the last few years, that many San Francisco restaurants are cutting down a bit on the portions - too many \"doggy bags\" get taken home and in many cases, I suspect, thrown out within a day or two. \n\nOn the plus side, the service is friendly and on a Sunday night there were only a few people there so the noise level was very good. \n\nWe're willing to give it a second chance and next time we'll try one of the chef's special dishes for the day or perhaps the risotto, which they told us is plenty big for two to share for a meal (again, those big portions?).", "author": "Joe P."}

Gee, it's like I gave away the whole plot in the first sentence, but I thought I'd cut to the chase since attention spans are getting so minuscule in the age of social media. Too bad since the signs prior to my recent virginal visit would indicate this could be the hidden jewel of Glen Park, a neighborhood with a lot more dining options than I always expect. This one is up on the second block of Diamond from the BART station just as the area starts to feel totally residential. The stone entryway gave way to a compact dining room.\n\nThe space was half full when I arrived by myself and fortunately there was a small table next to the front window just for me. Sometimes I wonder if the staff is immediately disappointed to see a solitary diner at a table for two. I definitely got that impression the minute I sat down. The server was quite chatty with the large, mouthy parties and even the couple seated next to me, offering suggestions on the menu, the wine and so forth. He barely said anything to me, just left the menu, some bread and olive oil (photo: http://bit.ly/2kzF16o) and came back about five minutes later to take my order.\n\nGee, I didn't think I was giving off an anti-social vibe, but it did throw me back to the dance in the gym at my high school when no one wanted to do the electric slide with me. Anyway, I ordered the $11 Insalata di Finocchio e Arancia, a refreshing plate of shaved fennel, orange segments, and shaved parmigiano reggiano doused in extra virgin olive oil and accessorized with black olives (photo: http://bit.ly/2kzJqpK). This was a terrific house salad with the fennel providing just the right crunch compared to the sweetness of the orange. I'd come back for that. For my entree, I decided to go with the $19 Pappardelle con Brasato di Maiale.\n\nA hearty dish indeed with big chunks of braised pork ragu wrapped around the thick pappardelle noodles (photo: http://bit.ly/2kgZWPq). This one didn't work for me. First, it was lukewarm. Second, the pork pieces were too big to savor with the pasta and required further cutting up. Third, the braise yielded just a watery base, not a thicker sauce that could have lent warmth to the dish. I was thinking dessert would be nice, a little tiramisu perhaps, but I never found out since the server never asked and simply left the check for me as soon as my plate was taken away. OK, I get the hint.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...the fennel and orange salad was excellent, the pasta less so\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...actually a charming space\nSERVICE - 2 stars...well, I don't know what I did wrong\nTOTAL - 3 stars...saved by the salad", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-18", "description": "I have been wanting to try Manzoni for months but was hesitant since I knew it was a very small restaurant, and sometimes restaurants like that give me anxiety because I have a service dog which can be uncomfortable to bring into a small restaurant because it's harder to be inconspicuous and ppl can be really mean and awful when they assume you have a pet. Luckily we were seated back towards the kitchen by their small bar, so it was actually quite Private. When we return, I would ask for that table again, or one of the tables in the window nook.\n\nThere were two servers working that night and ours (a female with long blond hair and an accent) was so sweet and friendly. The man who was the other server was not quite as friendly, so we were really happy that we lucked out with our server. I couldn't find an appetizer that fully appealed to us. They have an eggplant roll up that contains goat cheese but my dining companion doesn't like goat cheese. None of the salads really sounded super appealing and I found them to be a tiny bit overpriced. I was hesitant to get the polenta because neither of us like bleu cheese and it contains Gorgonzola but when the server came I sort of just pulled the trigger and ordered the polenta. It's a small ramekin and we shared it by each taking one spoonful and then having a second spoonful each. Both of our first spoons full were excellent. The mushrooms were the star of the show, the polenta was creamy and the cheese was very very mild. I was not able to even detect the Gorgonzola in the first bite. But the second helping was where all the Gorgonzola was contained and I think we both agreed that it was really overpowering. If you like Gorgonzola than this dish would be a five out of five for you, but for me it was just too funky so I wouldn't order it again. \n\nThe two dishes I was really interested to try were the rigatoni bischero and the gnocchi.  Lucky for me, my dining companion wanted the rigatoni so I went ahead and ordered the gnocchi. Both the dishes were excellent, I'm actually not even sure, in hindsight, which one I liked better. Following the creamy polenta, I think the rigatoni was more of a switch up in flavors, so at the time I really enjoyed that. But in hindsight the gnocchi were some of the best I've ever had. The sauce was creamy and cheesy with black truffles and really lovely Parmesan flavor. The actual gnocchi were so light and pillowy and had exactly the delicate flavor that I always look for in gnocchi and don't often find. The rigatoni has a meat sauce that's finished with some cream. It's silky, tomatoey and incredibly flavorful with a velvet creamy mouth feel. If I could change one thing about this dish, the vegetable in it would be something other than green peas. The sauce was slightly sweet and peas are very sweet; I really thought it would've been better complemented by something more bitter or at least less sweet than a pea. Don't give me wrong though, it's fantastic as-is.  I would highly recommend both of these dishes. \n\nUnfortunately, one thing that makes this restaurant more of a special occasion spot than a weeknight dinner place is the wine list. I'm pretty sure that the least expensive glass of wine was $12. I opted for a bottle of Sangiovese say that was $60. The wine was fabulous, and I really enjoyed everything about evening, but I would love to be able to come to Manzoni much more often, but if you like to drink the way I do during a cozy and romantic dinner (at least two glasses) Manzoni will get pricey. One should also note that the pasta dishes were all around $20, even the ones which did not contain meat (gnocchi and rigatoni are both $19). \n\nThe dessert was looked amazing but we were stopped. We both agreed that when we go back we are going to split a lighter appetizer, split an entr\u00e9e and then share a dessert.", "author": "Emma H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-18", "description": "I lived in San Francisco for close to 4 years and regularly complained to friends about the lack of quality Italian food (there's good pizza if you know where to look *Mozzeria for thin crust and Little Star for deep dish* - I was complaining about actual sit down meals). About 3 years in, I was dead tired after work and accidentally missed my stop at Bart. So glad I did, as that's when I stumbled across Manzoni.\n\nManzoni is literally the best Italian food I've ever had in a restaurant, despite living in Boston (but still, eat in Boston's North End - very good) and having visited Rome, Bari and Florence. (The exception to \"best I've ever had\" was the Bistecca Fiorentina in Florence but I've been told that you can't get Bistecca Fiorentina outside of Florence. From what I've seen, that's true.) Specifically for a Manzoni meal, I recommend the Vitello al Prosciutto (I probably spelled that wrong, but it's the veal and prosciutto). For dessert, the affagato (I also probably spelled that wrong, but can pronounce it for sure ;).\n\nThe staff is amazing. The genuinely care about their customers. For example, one of my friends has a shellfish allergy but wanted a steak. Our server checked with the kitchen and let us know that shellfish was cooked on the same grill as the steak, so it's unadvisable for her to have steak. He offered multiple suggestions for alternatives. Someone overheard this conversation and recommended cooking the steak in a saut\u00e9 pan instead of on the grill. Our server honestly (but politely) let us know that the steak would not be as satisfying saut\u00e9ed and steered us clear of that recommendation.\n\nYes, you are going to spend *at least* $50 per person, should you get a meal, an alcoholic beverage, desert or appetizer, and tip properly (20% or higher). It's worth it though, whether you're on a date/anniversary, hosting friends from out of town, trying to impress, splurging for a birthday, or are just someone who's accustomed to that prices range. \n\nIt's a small restaurant, which makes the setting intimate, but not uncomfortably so. If you have more than 2 people in your group, I highly recommend making a reservation, particularly during peak hours.

So, will not be back.\n\nIt was actually physically painful.\n\nYou should always consider the context around people's comments:\nWe've been eating in SF restaurants for over two decades. We've eaten in all kinds of restaurants around the world, including (perhaps relevant to Manzoni's) numerous cities and little towns in Italy. We go see a lot of loud bands -- up close-- at the Independent, the Fillmore, Slims, GAMH and Club Deluxe. We're fine at the movies (had no problem listening to machine guns and explosions in \"Hacksaw Ridge\" or \"Straight Outta Compton\" in the big movie theater). But this was different. \n\nThis was a hard-surface high-note kind of loud. Not because of music (I didn't hear any at Manzoni's), not just because of kitchen noise (we were closer to the front) not just because of the people who were eating there that night. \n\nWe couldn't hear our own conversation easily, we couldn't hear much of the what the (gruff) waiter said. \n\nI'm no expert on how to fix this. Hanging fabric? Acoustic panels? Egg cartons stapled to the walls and ceiling? Figure it out before you scare aware more locals.\n\nIf the food was great we could just use an app and have it delivered to our home, but the food wasn't worth having again.\n\nLike most large countries, Italy has regional variations on style. So maybe there are places I've yet to go where a pork rag\u00f9 is a thin, relatively flavorless broth accompanied by tough, dry relatively flavorless cubes of meat. But I prefer what I've understood in my experience to be the traditional rag\u00f9 (brasato or not)--a thicker, stewier sauce with ground/minced/chopped/shredded or just falling-apart meat that's inseparable from the sauce itself. And full of flavor.\n\nReviews suggest that others may have had a very different experience at this place, noise-wise or food-wise. I can only vouch for our experience, and just one night. But once was enough, so caveat emptor. Don't let the rustic rock facade fool you.", "author": "Brian C."}

The polenta is the perfect. Smooth and creamy with a textural surprise from the mushrooms. The use of gorgonzola cheese also added a little extra oomph to the dish to make it memorable.\n\nFor my entree, I went with the pappardelle. The sauce is light, almost like a tomato soup but went well with the braised pork. I loved it! Mom had the clam fettucini in white wine sauce and liked it too - she also appreciated the amount of clams and remarked that they were very fresh and sweet, still in shell. Dad had the rigatoni with Italian sausage; he also enjoyed his dish. I thought the sauce was a little strong, but that's my opinion\n\nEnded our meal with the panna cotta. Perfect end. Not too sweet - very fragrant vanilla flavor balanced nicely with the more tart bing cherries and sauce. Did kind of have a cherry cold medicine taste though....just a fyi.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

I like the fact that we were given a choice of which table to sit at, but soon enough I knew service would be super slow. Two staff were at the back counter just chatting chatting away. We were not in a hurry and have been to Italy, so we know 'authentically', service should be slow because people in Italy take their time to eat meals over 2-3hr period.\n\nFood- was okay. Not impressed. Read some great comments about their bread and olive oil, but I didn't think the bread was any special, actually not that good in my opinion. Mussels and clams in tomato sauce was standard. Spaghetti with anchovy/tomato sauce was a bit too salty, but the pasta itself was nice. Prawns was okay, lightly flavored, could tell it was most likely frozen. \n\nAmbience/decor- pretty big space with maybe 30-40 seats. A bit dimly lit, feels like it could be in Italy.\n\nService- friendly, but slow and appears not focused. We overheard the diner next to us got billed incorrectly, then when we got our bill, it was also incorrect. We were charged for an item that we did not order. A bit outrageous because we didn't order dessert after being presented with the dessert menu, the staff took the dessert menus back then brought us our check... And the added item was a dessert!!! What was she thinking?? She apologized and told us she mixed up our bill with the table next to us... But how could it be when the table next to us already paid and ordered all different items than us?? The only two waitstaff whom I think are the owners hung out at the back counter the majority of the time watching perhaps YouTube videos. I'm okay with slow service when staff are nice, but to get the bill wrong then to explain with an obvious untrue reason is a big turn off for me.\n\nOverall, the food is okay, hence the three star rating from me, but there is no particular reason for me to choose to dine here again.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-04", "description": "I've been in a 3 star rut for a while now. Trying to pick from 70+ pending reviews that are 2-3 stars to post is as depressing as pinching fat rolls and having to do the tripod bend when picking up something from the floor.\n\nOne of my gfs was visiting from Texas and wanted to have a group dinner. Her favorite cuisine is Italian. With a 4.5 star overall rating on Yelp, a quick walk from BART (~2.5 blocks), and easier parking than most parts of the city, Manzoni was an easy choice for our group dinner. Do make reservations as Manzoni is a small restaurant that can accommodate about 35 people. \n\nManzoni serves up rustic, Italian dishes with reasonable prices and portions in a very warm and inviting environment. It's a charming neighborhood gem that's highly recommended for an intimate date. \n\nOur group of six shared the following apps:\n*Parma Prosciutto & Burrata ($12): http://bit.ly/1x3mLmq\n*House Cured Salmon Carpaccio w/ shaved fennel & meyer lemon dressing ($11): http://bit.ly/1zub1wL\nSoft Polenta w/ wild mushrooms, fontina & gorgonzola ($9): http://bit.ly/1AbF0uT\n*Mediterranean Mussels & Clams in Spicy Tomato Broth ($11): http://bit.ly/10qxeNm\n\nFrom the apps I tried, the Polenta was my favorite as it was a stick to your ribs, hearty, cheesy, and earthy goodness. It's perfect cold weather food. Burrata is my vice and I just thought Manzoni's was just ok; I usually like burrata with a more milkier, creamier consistency. I appreciated that the House Cured Salmon wasn't too salty but I couldn't really detect any of the meyer lemon dressing. I didn't try the Mediterranean Mussels & Clams.\n\nOh and say, \"YES TO THE BREAD\"! We cleaned about six plates of it. The rosemary infused olive oil and balsamic vinegar dip was simply addicting. \n\nI had a hard time picking an entr\u00e9e because I wanted pasta AND a meat dish but I thought about the depressing fat rolls and decided to just get a pasta dish. After much debate, I choose the Pappardelle w/ braised pork ragu ($17): http://bit.ly/1sdo5Pu. I was disappointed that the pappardelle were more like thick egg noodles than sheets of pasta (just my personal preference). The pork chunks were uber tender but the sauce was one-note and quite bland. Had this dish been stellar, this review would be 4.5 stars rounded up to 5 stars. \n\nRedeeming my mediocre entr\u00e9e were the desserts. We shared the Eggless Vanilla Panna Cotta ($8.50), Hazelnut Budino ($9) & Tiramisu ($9): http://bit.ly/1uqWsIr. All were perfectly executed and equally delicious. The Panna Cotta was firm yet decadently creamy. The Hazelnut Budino was moist, chocolately, and nutty without being overly sweet. Loved the accompanying cr\u00e8me anglaise. If I had to pick a fav, it would have been the Tiramisu which had a great balance of coffee flavor, rum, mascarpone cheese and fluffy whip cream. It's the best Tiramisu I've had thus far and I get googly eyes just thinking about it.  \n\nService was most excellent and was everything you could ask for a neighborhood restaurant. Our server was friendly, attentive, and made great recs for the wine. Food service was timely. The owner even passed by several times to ensure everything was fine. We were the last ones to leave the restaurant but they didn't rush us out. \n\nParking is becoming increasingly harder in the area so do allow yourself an extra 10 minutes to find street parking.\n\nEveryone in our group left with happy bellies. I left with several. *Tripod bend*", "author": "Cherylynn N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-28", "description": "Unless you are looking for this place, Manzoni can be easily overlooked because it is further away from the Glen Park Bart station and right at the end of the businesses and the beginning of the residential area.  Despite living nearby, we only stumbled upon it as we were checking the other newer places that have opened up recently.  We finally found the opportunity to try it out last night.  We were a party of 4 and had a 6 pm reservation.  It is a very quaint restaurant with wood panel ceilings and the stone and brick wall is reminiscent of the family restaurants found in Italy.  The server, Mereena, was very good and offered great recommendations off the main menu and specials.  We ordered the endive salad and the faro and cucumber salad to share - both were excellent.  For entrees, we ordered the gnocchi, spaghetti puttanesca, the gamberino and fettucine vongole.  Everyone enjoyed their dishes.  We ended our meal by sharing 2 desserts (both homemade as we were told - $9 each) - the tiramisu and the hazelnut budino.  Again, very delicious.  \nBread and olive oil was brought for the table; water glasses were refilled without asking. The only area for improvement is their coffee - it tasted watered down and wasn't very flavorful. Overall, a very pleasant evening out with family, friends and good food.  The place is a little pricey for us, but well worth a splurge for a special or celebratory occasion.  We will definitely be back.", "author": "Will L."}

I'm not sure if there is too much parking.\n\nWhen looking for the building, I was a little bit confused because the name of the restaurant doesn't really stick out. I thought a dentist building replaced it, but alas, it was to the left of the dentist building.\n\nI walked in and we were seated. The restaurant itself is fairly cozy and quaint. Very cute. We opted for a window seat. \n\nWe were handed menus and when I saw it, I recognized it as a fairly traditional Italian menu... in that there was a more extensive food hierarchy. (If you go to Italy, you'll understand what I mean.)\n\nStarted the night with a bottle of wine:\nSan Angelo's Pinot Grigio 2010 - $40 - This was very crisp and refreshing. Very delicious.  \n\nThen the complimentary bread came out and the olive oil that came with it was DELICIOUS. \n\nAntipasti (Appetizers): \n---Mussels and Clams in Tomato sauce - Yum! One of my favourite dishes in general, and Manzoni's take on it was very traditional. Comes with 2 pieces of garlic bread. The base is yummy, and great to dip bread in.\n---Polenta - Might be slightly different from how you've had it before, but this was very good.\n\nPrimi (First Course, generally pastas and the like):\n---Rigatoni alla Bischero - This dish is good, but very very heavy. You'll need a stronger white wine, like a Chardonnay or something to pair with this.\n---Ravioli alla Verdura con Carino - This dish isn't as heavy as the Rigatoni, and is very delicious. It comes with 6 pieces of Ravioli. I think these were eggplant filled.\n\nSecondi (Generally a meat dish)\n---Gamberoni al salmorigano - Prawns (6 pieces). This dish has candied potatoes which I'm not a big fan of, but the prawns were well cooked and yummy. The veggies I think had a hint of bitter (just a hint!) and was a good pairing with everything, especially to offset the candied potatoes.\n\nDessert:\nPanna Cotta - I'm not a big fan of sweet stuff, but this actually wasn't overwhelming for me. It did make my wine a little bit more bitter though :p I enjoyed this dish, but I have no way of judging it because I'm not a big dessert eater.\n\nService:\nCute cute cute. The owner and his wife constantly checked up on us or had us in the corner of his eye to make sure we were okay. Refilled waters, and cleared dishes as we finished. He's the type of owner to really want to make sure you're at home. He makes you feel so at home, like a grandpa taking care of his grandchildren. He seems genuinely thankful towards each customer who comes in. \n\nNote: \nEach tier of food comes out after the prior one is finished. Thus if you don't finish your appetizers, your main dishes don't come out. And if you're primi isn't finished, your secondi doesn't come out; (they don't serve the pasta with the meat dish). In american culture, this is usually only reserved for fine dining, and in most asian cultures, this never happens.\n\nPrices:\nThis is a bit more expensive, but not unreasonable. I think the prices were extremely fair. \n\nSummary:\nI love love love this place, and I really hope to return sooner than later. I hope more people venture out here and try it. HIGHLY recommended and will return.", "author": "Kaje Y."}

I'm very unfamiliar with Glen Park and had a long day at work with the 31st being Halloween AND the Giants parade. I couldn't even get home after the parade (delayed bus after delayed bus.. standing around for an hour? no thanks!), so I prayed Manzoni was just a short walk from BART.\n\nWorry not folks! Manzoni is indeed, a short walk from the Glen Park BART station. It was about 4 short blocks. Parking can be tough, so if BART is easily accessible to you, TAKE IT.\n\nThe restaurant is small and cozy. All wood and brick interior. It's quiet and very casual, no need to dress up. (I guess I totally could have dined here in my Nyan Cat onesie costume.. just kidding. or am I?) Well, it seems like it is usually quiet in here, but I'm loud , SORRY! \n\nGreat service. Our server recommended some great wines based off what we were looking for. Pretty attentive, my water glass was never empty. But I did tell them that I didn't need anymore water before we were completely done with our meal. (C'mon folks, get in the habit of doing that - we are in a drought!)  \n\nWe ordered a great variety from the menu. I would say we ordered most of their appetizers and desserts (haha) \n\ncarpaccio di salmone con finocchio - salmon carpaccio with fennel. ehhh this was somewhat bland for me. I wish the fennel was more flavorful. \nparma prosciutto e burrata - prosciutto and burrata - I don't care for burrata. I enjoyed the prosciutto and arugula on this dish though. \npolenta alla valdostana - polenta with wild mushrooms , gorgonzola and fontina cheese - SO GOOD!!!!!! sort of stinky from the fontina but it's cheese, so it is the good stank. Loved all the mushrooms too. Creamy, earthy, cheese. YUMMMM\nMediterranean Mussels & Clams in Spicy Tomato Broth - my favorite appetizer that night. I kept hogging all the bread to dip in the tomato broth. Excellent. Loved that it was a mix of mussels and clams also. Perfectly cooked, plump and sweet. \n\nI had the spaghetti alla puttanesca. I love spaghetti. I especially love puttanesca sauce. Noodles were just right, great amount of olives in this dish but it needed a little more tang. Maybe more anchovy? The portion was huge. I really wanted to eat it all but I couldn't although I put up a damn good fight. I was sleepy toward the end of my meal. My gfs also loved their dishes and only ate half. They were smart and saved the rest for later. In retrospect, I probably should have done that but I am a carb wh0re. \n\nWe had 3 desserts: Eggless Vanilla Panna Cotta, Hazelnut Budino & Tiramisu. If there's anything in life you shouldn't miss out on, it is Mazoni's eggless panna cotta. This thing is decadent. It is the way panna cotta should be. It is.. perfect. Thick but not too rich or overwhelming, not too sweet. Probably the best panna cotta I've ever had in my life (Sorry E Tutto Qua, your panna cotta is getting booted down to number 2) The tiramisu was standard, and the hazelnut budino was excellent.\n\nAll around I would say excellent food for the price and atmosphere.

The service was friendly and attentive, atmosphere pleasant and warm, and the food...oh man the food...burrata actually done right (served room temperature with olive oil over thinly sliced prosciutto and arugula), risotto to die for, and ravioli in vodka sauce that rivals the best of NYC or South Philly.

I ordered the parpadelle with braised pork. The noodles tasted fresh, the pork was decent, and the sauce was flavorful. \n\nI also tried my friend's gnocchi with black truffle. The sauce seemed like an average white sauce and the black truffle flavor was light. However the gnocchi, was a little too soft for me\n. \nLastly, I ordered a tiramisu, which took a long time to get to me. The tiramisu was made very well: the mascarpone was light, the soak gave a really good flavor complement, and the lady fingers were perfect. \nI think it almost justifies the $9 per slice. \n\nJust a few recommendations:\n-have a reservation. My friends didn't have to wait because there were some spaces at the bar. \n-parpadelle is good pasta option \n-tiramisu is really good if you're going for dessert. \n-they also have other desserts that looked very well plated.", "author": "Jonathan C."}

I had the rigatoni and my partner had the pork medallions. There was a little too much spicey mustard on the pork that you ended up losing the flavor of the meat altogether, but it was still tasty. The pork came with roasted potatoes with rosemary and some roasted asparagus and carrots. Nicely presented!\nMy rigatoni was delicious. It had a creamy tomato sauce with sausage and peas. We also shared the arugula salad. It had roasted corn and a lemon vinaigrette. It was an interesting flavor. I enjoyed it.\nOverall, a very nice experience.

The place was a little hard to find, but from a fellow yelper tip, it's under the dental office sign.\n\nFirst off, the stars are subtracted mainly for the slow service. We go there at our reservation time, and had a table already set up for us. We were seated right away. Great start! But then it went downhill. It took them 30 mins just to start taking our order. The place was probably about 80% full, but still, come on. Once we finally ordered, it took a while for the bread to come out, which I don't understand, shouldn't it be readily available? Most importantly, we didn't get our dishes until 1+ hour  later!! And worst of all, the dishes were cold... Hmmmm. I understand that they wanted to wait for all dishes to come out at the same time, but still, this could be prevented or better organized. Hot dishes should not be served cold. \n\nI do have to give them props for one of the penne dishes that my friend got, not sure what's the name, but it was pretty delicious. The others were just okay (we like to family style, so got to try every dish our party got).", "author": "Sandy C."}

Great service and a charming, clean venue (very quiet when we ate, about 6pm on a Wednesday night). We started our meal with a baby spinach/prosciutto/shaved parmesan/pine nut salad which was good but not worth ~9.50 IMO. The other dishes justified their price tag, however. I had the gnocchi with fontina cheese and black truffle sauce=to die for. My boyfriend had the riggatoni with tomato cream sauce and peas which was also super delicious. I can't find one negative thing to say about this place and highly recommend it.\n\nBonus: this place is only a couple short blocks from Glen Park BART station and next to a funky little neighborhood full of interesting architecture.. perfect for walking all that pasta off!", "author": "Nikki O."}

It's the only place I can bring out of town family to and advise them to order anything from the menu - it's all equally superb. Very friendly spot. At the end of the night, the stories come out, Manzoni has traveled for the love of food and wine. It feels special to be able to taste his curated menu.\n\nThe other friendly bit, is on weekends it's always 80-90% full, so the wait for a table is rarely all that long.\n\nManzoni, if you read Yelp reviews, the only change I might consider experimenting with is one dish for a rotating calorie-lighter 'for the locals' menu item.

Until I came here. This is, hands down, the worst Italian restaurant I've ever been to, and the entire family agreed. I have no clue how this place scored a four star average with lackluster food and a dishonest waitress.\n\nI made an 8:30 reservation through open table and came twenty minutes early to check in. Since it's a bit cramped inside, I went in alone and my family waited outside. There's no specified hostess so I waited for five minutes and the entire staff of 4 literally walked right past me. I get that they're busy, but they could at least acknowledge me and say, \"Hey, I'll be with you in a moment.\" But no. So I dragged my family in, hoping they'll notice a larger party. After a minute or so, the waitress finally came around to confirm our reservation and told us it'll be around fifteen minutes. Okay, so we went out and walked around the local grocery store for twenty and came back at 8:40. When we arrived, a couple was waiting there. I saw the staff place a table in the corner, assuming that it was for us. And of course, the couple that walked in after us got to sit down first. So we asked why they got the table and the waitress said that it was a table for two. We were pretty far away at that time, so we didn't see the extra table that they could have parked together for our party of four. After we finally sat down after an additional ten or fifteen minutes, I spotted the table. Strike two. \n\nMussels and Clams Appetizer\n\nFor $14, there wasn't enough on the plate. The mussel that I ate was fishy. But overall, the dish was okay with a flavorful tomato sauce that also worked as a dip. When we ran out of bread, we joked about getting it ourselves, since it was next to our table. We asked for a refill, and the waitress brought the remaining roll, stating that it was all they had left. But halfway into our meal, I watched as a different waitress opened a box from the cabinet and pulled out a roll of bread. Wow.\n\nPappardelle con Brasato di Maiale\n\n(After we placed our order, she came back to tell us that they're out of the fresh pastas AKA the pappardelle and fettuccine, 2/3 pastas that we ordered, so we had to replace all of the dishes with rigatoni.)\nThis was below average. It only had a small hint of flavor and the ragu was disappointing compared to the previous times I've had it at other Italian restaurants. My sister said it tasted cheap. Too bad it wasn't at $19.\n\nRigatoni alla Bischero\n\nThis was the best among the pasta dishes. The tomato cream sauce was good and the family kept reaching for it. But the sauce overpowered the sausage so I couldn't taste it at all.\n\nFettuccine alle Vongole\n\nThere's an option of getting this with a white wine or the tomato cream sauce. My mom opted for the wine sauce and that was a mistake. It had no taste whatsoever. We flagged down the waitress, explained that it was bland and asked her to bring out a side of the tomato sauce. But she decided to counter us and say that that's how a white wine sauce is. Um, we know what we ordered and how it's supposed to taste. No apology for the food or attitude.\n\nBistecca di Manzo al Tartufo\n\nAt least the steak was redeeming. Cooked at a medium like we requested, and the char was great. \n\nOne other thing that was commendable was the interior. It wasn't too crowded like most SF restaurants, and it was very warm (unless you're sitting right by the door).\n\nThis restaurant is now forever engraved in the Hall of Lame.", "author": "Tiffany P."}

I was going to order the fennel salad but heard a lady next to us tell her companion not to get the fennel salad because it tends to be slimy.  So I ordered a crostini with fava bean spread instead.  It was ok but the salad that came with it was over dressed and limp and slimy.  My husband had the mussels & clams that he said were ok but the bread that came with it was burnt around the edges.\n\nOur entrees were disappointing as well.  My husband ordered gnocchi and it looked awful and was completely drenched in a thick and oily cream sauce, it looked like clam chowder.  What a shame it was because the gnocchi had a good texture.  I ordered a sole special that came with polenta and spinach.  It was ok but the spinach was plain.\n\nWe skipped dessert and just wanted to get out of there. We both left very unsatisfied.

We made last minute plans, so I was struggling to find a place that would take us, but I called Manzoni's around 5'30 and they were able to accommodate the 2 of us for an 8pm reservation. \n\nI had the red wine special per our server's recommendation and my date had the white. The red was definitely better than the white, but if you like a really buttery finish, you might like the white wine. I don't know how often they change their glass wine specials.\n\nWe ordered the procuitto burrata for an appetizer and it took 30 minutes for the food to come out. My boyfriend was definitely getting a little peeved that the food was taking so long. When it finally came out, our server was very apologetic for the wait, and I believe the food was worth it. The burrata was delicious!\n\nI tried to order the Pappardelle with pork ragu for my dinner. He had the shrimp. Unfortunately, they ran out of the pappardelle (they had run out of several items last night). The server was again, very apologetic, and made some other suggestions. I was having trouble deciding between the gnocchi and the ravioli. I finally decided on the ravioli, but to my surprise, my server returned and told me she had begged the kitchen staff to do a half/half plate of BOTH the ravioli and the gnocchi so I wouldn't have to decide! \n\nMy boyfriend's shrimp was cooked well and it was flavorful. The ravioli was the best entree of the night. I highly recommend it. The gnocchi was soft and creamy and delicious as well, but I think the ravioli was better. We also had the tiramisu for dessert, which was good.\n\nOverall, this is a small homey italian restaurant that serves unpretentious solid food.

The owner (who also owns the nearby Higher Grounds coffeehouse) has made the place something of his labor of love, and it shows in the ornate brickwork he installed -- having shipped it in from overseas and carried by special trucks up from Long Beach.\n\nThey have a good, relatively inexpensive, and rather brand-name-heavy wine list. The service is spotty (though it opened only a week ago), and the food can vary from quite good to forgettable. For example, the gnocchi alla Piemontese is excellent: soft and pillowy with a cream sauce that doesn't overdo it and black truffle added to the mix. But then the Parma prosciutto with burrata is merely decent. The burrata lacked that freshly made irregularity -- it was a consistent texture, lacking the outer vs. inner layers that makes it a true burrata -- and the prosciutto was sliced a bit thick. And then the panna cotta was outright rubbery. So yeah...uneven.\n\nWhich makes us baffled by all the Yelptards who gave this place five stars. Seriously?! Must we act like yokels who have never been inside an Italian restaurant this side of a Sbarro or Pizza Hut? Talk about hyperbole. Not every good performance deserves a standing ovation, and not every good meal rivals the French Laundry in terms of quality.\n\nIt's a respectable three stars -- no more, no fewer.

Nice serving split for two!\n\nWe each had our main dishes:\nI had the Pork medallions with capers/butter - was very good and pork was super tender!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-08-22", "description": "Italian food, much like Chinese or French or any other cuisine, will vary from country to country. An Italian restaurant in Germany will not taste the same as in the US. It is easy for restaurants to fall into the trap that they have to pile your plate with pasta, rush you through courses, remove a plate when your partner is still eating, the list goes on. Not so at Manzoni.\n\nThe joint is pristine inside and outside (we spotted the owner taking pride at his job by sweeping the sidewalk before opening). Again, a great sign of how things are done here.\n\nA warm, genuine, unpretentious welcome starts the experience. We sat at the table closest to the bar and had a great view of the whole place, allowing us to enjoy the details, the cleanliness and the view of this small neighborhood's side street. With no signs outside, we had no idea this restaurant existed until we learnt about it through word of mouth.\n\nThe wine selection is very unusual: You will try a few and quickly realize that there is no bad wine at this restaurant.\n\nThe portions are just right and luckily closer to European standards. So is the service: No one will bother you with unnecessary questions that do nothing but rudely interrupt conversations. Instead, at all times attentive, staff will gently and politely do what they know how to do best.\n\nIt is an expensive night out and it was apparent that most parties were there to celebrate a life event. However, it money was not an impediment, we would certainly opt to dine here more often and already consider it a favorite if we fancy Italian food and a 'hidden' night out in town.", "author": "Nena G."}

I wanted a nice, predictable, no-nonsense-service trattoria experience like we've had in Italy and all I can say about Manzoni is SPOT ON.  Really, if I could figure out how to give 4.5 stars it would be only because I like a little citrus taste with my salmon and the salmon fennel carpaccio with which we started could've, accd'g to my taste, used some.  But that's just me because it really was delicious.  Our server was Italian and he knew his Italian wines.  I first chose a Friuli and he applauded my choice.  But with the gnocchi... which hands down, was the BEST gnocchi my partner and I have ever head (little pillows of tender flavor explosion, garnished with a peppering of black truffle in a cheese sauce that was light and partnering like an experienced dancing leading man)... he suggest another white which escapes me now (Gravi a Gravi or something like that).  Light, yet full of character and complexity.\n\nThen the salad, which was mixed spring greens with julienned apples, with a berry vinaigrette that just floated on the greens... not heavy but a great partnership  ...Are you getting it yet?  We were having a GREAT time.  All you detractors, I'm sorry you had a bad time but I'm glad we didn't go on the nights you did.\n\nFollowed the main meal, which was vitello scallopine... veal scallopine toped with pancetta and a cheese which I forget. Again... a pillow of texture and flavor and our waiter suggested a wonderful Piemontese red which he had me taste first (hot... high level alcohol I thought, but delicious).  When I confirmed that I liked it and he brought a glass, he explained that this new glass may taste differently because it was a new bottle and hadn't breathed yet.  Detail.  Love it.\n\nTiramisu and chocolate budino for desert.  Both the best we've had... and another wonderful suggestion for a desert wine by our waiter.\n\nPrices were just right... I mean we spent close to $200 with tip but we ordered like it was our 26th anniversary, and I know we would have paid $100 more for the same experience at some nouvelle Amero-Italio-nouvelle whatever place.  The service was attentive and non-intrusive, and detached in that charming European kind of way.\n\nI'm sold.  We will be back.

You would not recognize it today! The restaurant opened this week and is still a bit rough around the edges in terms of moving plates from kitchen to customer, but the staff are all pleasant and sincere. We were seated promptly in the early evening and our water glasses were attentively filled. Unfortunately, timing was a bit of an issue as we waited over 45 minutes for our pasta entrees after the appetizers came and, at one point, we were asked whether we wanted to see the dessert menu before our entrees had arrived. I think they forgot our order for awhile. Even so, I do not have the heart to give this place less than 4 stars, because it is opening week afterall and the dining choice is much-needed in the Village. If you've ever been to the owner's other establishment, Higher Grounds Coffee House, you know it is a humble operation but excellent, excellent food.\n\nI had a sliced fennel salad that was fresh and crisp and a pork ragout pappardelle. The food is very straightforward and satisfying. The menu has a diverse selection of pastas as well as main entrees (New York steak, roasted half chicken and others) . We did not try dessert, but the ones that passed our table looked substantial. The prices are reasonable, with appetizers and salads in the $8-10 range, pastas about $16 and full main entrees around $22. The wine list fills two pages.\n\nThis week, the place is cash only as the credit card machines have not come in yet.

My partner and I both had a delicious shrimp dish with beautiful lemon garlic and mediterranean aromatic flavors.  It was served with gorgeous roasted squash and Brussels sprouts.  The whole thing was presented with glamour and was filling and delicious.  To start we had a beautiful roasted eggplant dish--goat cheese, avocado, smoked salmon, rolled inside--which was stunning, and a fennel salad, made with a light, flavored olive oil or some other fine oil, also excellent.   I rate this shrimp and eggplant as outstanding worthy of five stars and the fennel salad as excellent four stars.  We also had a great and reasonablly priced wine from Sicily.   The service is warm and professional.  The restaurant is beautiful, comfortable, warm with soft light and the wooden interior seems to absorb noise well so if you like to talk to your dinner mates, it's a find.  If you like the bistro food and the vibe at Petit Laurent, you will also love this place just diagonally Diamond Street.  We will definitely go again soon.  \n\nBy the way, in contrast to a prior reviewer who complained of grade inflation, i.e. giving five star ratings when The French Laundry is a gold standard for five stars restaurants, I note (having been several times) that the French Laundy costs about $250.00 per person on a cheap day.  Manzino offers wonderful food with  professional, warm service and a friendly atmosphere in our neighborhood for $30 to $50 per person without driving anywhere or making a reservation six months in advance!   There should be five stars for different classes of restaurants, not just the super luxe of the luxe.  Manzino is doing what it sets out to do on its terms wonderfully.  I have also had a lot of two to three star dishes at Incanto over the hill in Noe Valley.

The ambiance and decor were so reminiscent of an old Roman osteria was remarkable. The food was very good for both of us. I had a grouper fish special and it was outstanding, perfectly cooked and seasoned and served with broccoli rabe - love it. My friend had a rigatoni dish that was light and tasty.\n\nI highly recommend Manzoni. The owner was very kind and attentive. I'll be back.", "author": "Garrett S."}

I went  with two friends, we ordered two different starters ( great bean soup) and three main course plates. All were good, only one was a disappointment, Risotto, too salty.   Wine list very fine and may I say the prices are most reasonable. \ni'll be back.", "author": "Mary S."}

The \"wine of the night\" was flavorful and reasonably priced. The server suggested appetizers to complement the main courses, when we asked for suggestiond ... and his choices were spot-on. The service was friendly and attentive. I'm not usually a big fan of Italian desserts, but the panna cotta was thick and rich, with just the right amount of dark cherries to add a counterbalancing flavor note. We'll definitely be back to this neighborhood gem.", "author": "Rich W."}

The owners have created a warm inviting space that transforms you to Europe. The staff is very friendly and efficient which adds immensely to Manzoni's charm as a wonderful neighborhhood restaurant.  The food is solid, though not exceptional. Most of the dishes  we had (lentil soup & risotto special, corn/arugula salad,  pork entree, and budino) were very good.  The fish special I had was good, but not so good that I would order it again.  Overall our first experience was wonderful and we will definitely go back.", "author": "Brad W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-07", "description": "great food but I can't afford to go back because the Nero d'Avila, the cheapest wine in the house, was $9.50 a glass.  My bad-- the wife and I like to linger over a two glasses each and, including tax and tip, that means fifty bucks on the bill for vino.  The waitress told me the corkage fee was $18.50.  If they lowered their corkage fee, or offered a house wine for a reasonable price we'd be there once a week.  Great resto for techies just off the bus, but not for us", "author": "greg c."}

It's a bit tight on space and can be noisy but is worth the trip. Do not be in a hurry or prissy when you get there. The staff is very friendly, even if a bit unorganized at times if the place is packed . The food is amazing that's all I can say about it and the tiramisu  is to die for. \nThe place is new and has a few bugs to work but overall it's got a great start as far as I'm concerned.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-08-27", "description": "In reading a lot of these reviews before coming here, I wasn't sure the lesser reviews were snobby entitled folks or those with general and valid complaints. I decided to try the place and it seems there is a lot more snobbiness and entitlement than merit. It really makes me question the value of yelp. It seems that people either love or hate things enough to write about it. It reminds me of a study that I read about surveys in general that elaborated on motivation factors which include passionate experiences, bad experiences, or financially motivated ones. Bottom line, all reviews fall into one of these three categories. Yelp has created a new category. I like to call it the \"I'm bored but think I'm clever and witty so i will write about places and judge them harshly\" category. Yelp is full of reviews like this. They have no merit. For that reason, I pledge today to never again consider yelp reviews as fair or accurate, just entertaining at best.  So read my  review if you want...trust it if you want...but don't get let down if you disagree...\n\n...and don't complain if the kitchen won't make your snot nosed little kid a special pizza\n\n...and don't complain if the credit card machine goes down\n\n...and if you don't like it, go to another restaurant and don't take it a personal vendetta against you such that you have to write a review like you're friggin' Anthony Bourdain or something. \n\nBasically get over yourself.  OK onto my review.\n\nFood was great...nothing frozen...all prepared fresh and it was obvious!  Well served, well presented, great menu options for a true trattoria experience, which I believe was the concept here (tuscan if I'm not mistaken).  A really great example of what you would get in Italy...none of the California or American fusion that perverts a lot of Italian restaurants.  Keep it up Manzoni...I'll be back", "author": "jacob s."}

You can get a delicious crepe from him the the morning across the street at Higher Grounds, and then be warmly greeted by him at night at this fancy Italian restaurant. The atmosphere is very warm and inviting. They play opera. I hate opera, but I liked it when I was there. All of the dishes we got were delicious, but the best was a salmon appetizer. They have plenty of fish and exciting vegetarian options for those of us who are carnivorously challenged. I'd give them one more star if they featured organic meats. At the end of the dinner we had the door opened for us and were told \"Goodnight.\" I love these people and I hope they stay here for a long time!", "author": "Diana M."}

I usually woof my food down, but I made a point at taking my time once I took my first bit.  Definitely try the tiramisu...authentic and homemade.

When our ahi tuna dish was late in coming - even before we knew it was late - our server brought us a gratis (and yummy)  shrimp and pasta dish to fill the delay.   We didn't order dessert, mentioning we were tempted by the hazelnut chocolate cake but were just too full;  but because the server knew this was a birthday dinner we were surprised with a takeout box of hazelnut chocolate cake with \"happy birthday\" written on the box, accompanied by the owner and two servers quietly singing a happy birthday song in Italian  Real class!

It's another great win for the neighborhood (which already had a fantastic French place) with nice decor, a ridiculously friendly owner that really goes out of his way to make sure you're having a good time, and very good food. We had a party of 6 and one just average meal, the rest were top notch.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-01-08", "description": "Starting with the plus side: Manzoni's food is terrific, and the prices are in line with San Francisco. It's wonderful to have an Italian restaurant in Glen Park at long last. On the down-side, there's no organization to the wait-staff, they all seem to just run around without a clue as to what they are doing. No one is assigned to water or bussing tables or greeting at the door. That everything eventually gets done is kind of a miracle. The room is typical of San Francisco: way too loud - nothing was done to mitigate the sound (a little acoustic softening goes a long way - drapes, anyone?), and the chairs have wicker seats, which will certainly help them turn over tables quickly, but which don't add comfort to the list of attractions. By all means go - but you may want to pick a slow night (we went on a Saturday), in order to save yourself some grief and some hearing loss. Manzoni's is closed on Sundays and Mondays.", "author": "Jeremy C."}
