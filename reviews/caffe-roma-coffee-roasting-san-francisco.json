(They start breaking down the lunch cooler by about 12:35, so if you are a later luncher, be ready for scraps.) You will notice that the line moves at a snail's pace, for generally there is but a single employee taking and preparing lunch orders. There is also but a single register by which to process payment. Customers who are there only for coffee merge into the lunch line between the salad cooler and the register, so don't think your mind is playing tricks on you if you feel yourself moving further back in line rather than moving forward. It's actually happening. When you finally get to place your order, don't be surprised if they are out of the soup you planned on ordering. They will not do you the courtesy of erasing it from the menu board when the supply is depleted.\n\nTheir salads seem to be assembled with eye toward using up whatever random ingredients they having lying around, rather than with conscious consideration of what ingredients best compliment each other. Salads and pasta are available in three sizes: squat, small, and large. You'll notice there are containers demonstrating the sizes displayed behind the counter; you'll also notice there is absolutely no indication of price for any of the sizes. I have paid as little as $2.95 and as much as $5.75 for a squat of salad. There seems to be no consistent logic to how the price determinations are made; regardless of how much you pay for it, chances are that your salad will be salty or your pasta will be overcooked. On the several instances where I have raised the issue of this discrepancy at the register, I was admonished that different salads have different prices, and was generally made to feel a petty cheapskate. \n\n\nBut perhaps that is to be expected, as Caffe Roma evidently runs on a \"petty cheapskate\" business model. I've noticed that of late, they process your order as \"eat-in\" (it displays these words on the register, visible to the customer) even when your food is visibly packaged to go. I don't know if they are pocketing the \"sales tax\" or what, but given the lack of transparency in their general pricing scheme, I wouldn't be surprised. Additionally, for about six months, they had a buy-ten-cups-of-coffee-get-one-free club, but apparently the goodwill this engendered within their core customer base did not mitigate the deep fiscal hit caused by giving away all those free coffees, and the club was unceremoniously disbanded.\n\nThe coffee is fine, though sometimes burnt.\n\nOverall, their service is infuriatingly inefficient, and, on their best days, the food is mediocre and overpriced.

In fact, my parents bought a coffee maker on one visit as a \"gift\" to me.  But really it was so I could bring them coffee in bed instead of shipping them off to Starbucks.\n\nBut of course, a coffee-maker isn't enough; you also need top-quality coffee grounds to get those sleepy peeps out of bed.  So when my Cost Plus supply ran out (it came free with my coffee table--how cute), I started looking for a serious bean supplier.  Enter Caffe Roma--it's a North Beach institution, but the important thing is that they've also got a location on Bryant, near my work.  In addition to the gourmet beans (about $12 a pound, and worth it), it's also a great lunch spot.  Indeed, I'm really surprised there's not a huge lunch rush from the courthouse.  But it's actually quite peaceful, and the perfect place to enjoy a latte and a delicious (albeit slightly small) toasted sandwich.", "author": "Wes M."}

I work across the street, and this is by far the best place to get food.\n\nThe Good:\n1. BEST Ice Tea ever.  I love it.  And the lemonade is good, too.\n2. The soups are delicious.  They now have tomato bisque twice a week, due to popular demand.\n3. The desserts are so good.  They have these seasonal butter / sugar cookies that rival the ones I bake.  And they're gigantic - I pick one up and share it with three co-workers, and all of our sugar cravings are fixed.\n4. The chicken pesto sandwich!  It's BIG (all their sandwiches are) and flavorful.  I can't eat a whole one, so I usually split one with a co-worker.\n5. HAMBURGER TUESDAYS!  Burger options in the 'hood are thin on the ground.  One of the deputies turned me on to the burgers... The cops and deputies line up for them weekly.\n6. If you're a regular (which, apparently, I am), the staff and owners typically know your name and \"the usual.\"  It's nice to have that level of personal service.\n7. The owners really are the best.  They care about their customers and work hard at customer service.\n8. The food is always fresh and there's always a good variety of salads.\n\nThe Bad:\n1. It's expensive.  The quality is excellent, but a $12 take-out lunch bill can make a dent in the wallet.  Still, you get what you pay for... there is no comparable sandwich or soup in the neighborhood.\n2. There can be errors in orders...  I once ordered a tostada with no beans, and instead got one with plenty of beans and no chicken.  I once ordered a chicken wrap and was given a crab wrap (no thanks, no crabs for me!).  Alas, if the owners are there, they'll always do their best to right any wrongs, and they're sincere in wanting to please their customers.  I think that's more important than getting it right all the time.\n3. They sometimes run out of things.  Some days see mad rushes, other days are quiter around the Hall of Justice.  It just depends.\n\nAll in all, if you're anywhere near the Hall of Justice and are in need of some good fare, you will be pleasantly surprised by this place.  It's my favorite lunch place and I'm there several times a week.  It's popular with the cops and the deputies for a reason.", "author": "Melanie K."}

I actually travel here once a month to buy three pounds of coffee.  I brew it at home every morning.  I also like that they give you a free latte or coffee when you buy a pound of coffee.  The only coffee that is better is in Paris!", "author": "Jane A."}

And who makes a salad w balsamic dressing in a mixing bowl that already has Caesar dressing in it? Is that not a food code violation? No one asked me what i'd like to drink, so I asked the cashier. Her exact words, \"oh you need to be ready for me to charge you. I'm not gonna run around and get it for you.\". I guess the fact that it's the only decent place by the court house means they don't have to be polite.", "author": "shelley p."}

The coffee is good, but it was pricey for the size. There's only one cashier counter, so the line and wait can get long. Their food is pricey too for their portions. Their bagels are on the small size. And the quality is decent.", "author": "Sam W."}

Starbucks doesn't do anything for me if I need a pick me up. Peet's is not within walking distance so I go here. Tasty lattes and mochas. A little on the pricey side for lunch though. $8 for a sandwhich is a little steep... but $3 for a great tasting mocha is A-OK! The occasional Gavin sighting is worth while as well. :)", "author": "Kat L."}

After requesting a large cup with ice for my small coffee, I was informed I had to pay for the large coffee and then was educated in the costs of cups for 10 minutes by staff.  I had been on an anti-roma kick for about a week until today when I went in to give the place a second try.  This time I bought my small coffee @ $2.95 and when reached in for the beloved credit card, was told by the same employee that there was now a $3.00 min purchase.  I get minimum purchases, however this was 5 cents a way!  I called the owner myself this morning and told her my concerns.  I was told the $3.00 min purchase is a new policy that they just started, of course there is no signage in the store or at the register and was again educated on how expensive credit card transactions were with no sight of an apology.  Save the lectures on cost and go down the street to Caf De Leon or better yet McDonalds... you can pay for your coffee and actually get what you want.", "author": "sean m."}
