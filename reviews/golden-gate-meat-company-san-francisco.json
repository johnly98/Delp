I am very frequently at the Ferry Building when I have a Ratatouille-like imagination for what to cook for dinner.\n\nI don't do my daily meat shopping at the Golden Gate Meat Company (you can go poor doing that), but it is reliable for great quality meats, GAME, offal, etc. that you just can't find at a regular old butcher shop (at least without calling ahead). I feel like I'm cheating on my butcher by coming here! Duck breast--they've got it. Wild boar-- they've got it. Cornish game hens, quail, and squab-- they've got it. Foie gras, veal galore, beef galore, all the makings of your culinary dreams-- hell yeah they've got it.\n\nI especially prefer the osso buco here. At many other butcher shops, the veal shanks are small and sometimes even prepackaged. GGMC has the largest veal shanks I could find! This one time I was cooking a big dinner and they even sawed more pieces for me from a whole shank. It was so hardcore butcher, I was impressed.\n\nThat just about completes my shopping list, but they have an intense game selection including venison, buffalo, elk, & pheasant.

There are so many food places to choose from. We decided on Golden Gate Meat Company when we saw the chicken pot pie. Neither of us are big meat eaters. In fact, I don't think we would have ordered anything else on the menu. This place is inside the Ferry building and not a proper sit-down restaurant, so we weren't expecting it to be that great. OH MY GOSH!!!!!! The chicken was so soft and delicious. All the contents just melted in your mouth. Even the crust was so soft and not hard or crumbly. It was so great to get a home cooked meal in the middle of all the bustle. We were already really hungry, but the pot pie hit the spot. I think this is probably the best pot pie I have ever had. It's a little shop where you can get restaurant quality food. I may be taking more trips out to the Ferry Building just to eat here. The only thing that was kind of annoying was that there was no place to sit. It was close to Christmas, so the place was packed with tourists, we had to stand. The cashier was kind of moody. That being said, we only paid $9 each, and I think most of the menu items are reasonably priced compared to what you would see in some of the other shops. It was also very filling and didn't leave me feeling heavy or sick to my stomach. Pot Pie FTW!", "author": "D. K."}

So what elevates this breakfast sandwich to a five star rating? The same reasons that separate great food from the chaff, perfect execution paired with quality ingredients at a reasonable price.\n\nEgg in this breakfast sandwich was perfectly cooked. It was skirting raw, but clearly firm and cooked. Any longer and the egg would've been the standard hard-ish, boarderline powdery, egg you can find in a mcmuffin. Stopping before the mcprocess made the egg white silky and flavorful. The melted cheddar atop the silky egg created a creamy sharp contrast for the sandwich. \n\nBacon was crispy, smokey, and a thick generous cut. They use bacon that's sold at the meat counter. You can taste the difference in quality compared to that of generic diner bacon.  \n\nBread was soft and buttery. After eating artisan sourdough all weekend I was delighted by how soft and \"biteable\" the bread was. No chewy crusts here!\n\nFor $6.50, this sandwich was the perfect way to start my day as a faux SF tourist.", "author": "Catherine S."}

I did not even know of this place was in the Ferry Building.  I went to Farm Fresh For You to pick up some producer and noticed it.  On that day, I was purchasing a flank steak from Prather Ranch but made a mental note to find out more about Golden Gate Meat Company.\n\nA little later on, I did a little research.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was considered another great option for purchasing quality meat in San Francisco.\n\nWhen I decided to make pulled pork, Golden Gate seemed like a nice place to purchase a pork butt.\n\nI made my way to the Ferry Building.  It is a short walk.  One of the first things I spotted behind the counter was a beautiful pork butt.  The attendant quickly asked if I needed assistance.  I asked him how much the pork butt weighed.  It was 5 lbs.  I was mentally trying to calculate if it would fit into my Dutch oven.  I had initially been thinking about 4 lbs.  But, come on, it's pulled pork. Isn't more pulled pork better than less?  I decide it will fit.  Luckily, it did, barely. He wrapped it up and gave it to the cashier.\n\nPork Butt Before Rub:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/79zgzm8\n\nPork Butt After Rub:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/7g4tonr\n\nTurned into pulled pork sandwich:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/7wd5a8n\n\nI paid for it and carried on with my shopping.\n\nThe staff was friendly and helpful.  The meat behind the glass all looks amazing.  There is quite a selection displayed.  The cut of meat I purchased was very good.  Oh, and I did mention pulled pork didn't I?  Well, I took the pork butt home.  Mixed up a rub.  Rubbed it down.  Cooked it for five hours at 225 in a cast iron Dutch oven.  That pork butt made some very tender juicy pulled pork.  I would certainly return to try other cuts of meat.", "author": "Mark D."}

The pot pie was calling my name (I have been seeing the commercials for KFC's chicken pot pie, and I knew that I would never get one from that gross place, so I figured if I was gonna dive, diving here into a pot pie seemed like a good bet.  They are $7 if paid with a credit card $6 if you pay cash - Now who would pay the extra dollar just to charge it???, unprepared morons I'm guessing \n \nI asked the lady if I should get the meat or the turkey, she said meat (I agreed, since it is GG \"Meat\" Company after all).

On a quest for the best meals in San Francisco, I Googled these two classic comfort foods and arrived at the Ferry Building to see if GGMC actually deserved it's near perfect score of 4.5 out of 5 pts on Yelp.\n\nSigh.\n\nThe pot pies sit all day in a display case, and are served at room temperature, which may not mean much to Brits, but at $7 a pop, and only 5 inches in diameter (think Swanson's pot pie), this Yank expects the filling to be silky smooth and juicy, the meat and vegetables, moist and flavorful, and the crust, the essence of buttery, flaky goodness. Sigh. While the crust may be flaky, it only made the thick, mediocre filling feel that much more gummy in my mouth. I didn't get past two bites before moving on to the mushroom gravy-covered meatloaf, which comes with mash potatoes or grilled fresh vegetables, $8.\n\nAck!\n\nThe meatloaf was a little slice of tender pink flesh reminiscent of canned deviled ham, with an odd, gritty finish, which might explain why it was the size of a biscotti. The sour tasting mushroom sauce suggested wine that was not allowed to cook off completely, thus masking the mushrooms, bits of which relied more on your imagination than plain sight. The only saving grace were the grilled vegetables, delicious onions, green beans, peppers, and broccoli florets seasoned to perfection.\n\nSearching for better?\n\nKFC's Chicken Pot Pie. You heard me. The Colonel gets what makes our mouths dance and drool, in a pie that not only dwarfs GGMC's puny chick-a-don't, at 6 1/2\", but comes full of fresh pulled dark meat, silky smooth and plentiful butter yellow gravy, big pieces of carrots and potatoes, peas, and a crispy, toasty, buttery crust that begs to be broken into dipping pieces. $3.99 everyday, dollar off on Mondays. Some stores are better at making these than others, namely the Duboce and 3rd street restaurants, but I daresay you won't find better at any other restaurant in the city.\n\nMax's Opera Cafe meatloaf. Yes, the uber fancy eatery knows from mom's favorite baked meat, serving up an actual loaf the size of a butter pound cake, with surprisingly similar tenderness, and remarkable for it's meaty taste, and excellent color. The mushroom gravy is a shining example of silky brown glazing, full bodied meat flavor, and chock full of sauteed fresh mushrooms. Served with a mound of fresh, chunky mashed potatoes and tender fresh carrots. At $14.95., the portion is so large you should share it, and the restaurant is so beautiful, you'll want to do so with a date. Did I mention it has a full bar?", "author": "John Z."}

I actually like the gal who serves up the breakfast sandwiches in the morning but I don't like the guilt trip I get every time I whip out an ATM/Credit card.\n\nHere's the thing. For about a year now, I've purchased tasty breakfast sandwiches at GGMC and in spite of my two star review, I can' t knock their quality. These little morsels are a great way to start my morning, twice a week, when I commute up to Marin.\n\nHere's the catch.\n\nI live in Nob Hill, and my checking account is with Citibank. This means that I have to walk almost a full mile, round trip, to get cash in my wallet without paying 15% on $20 (granted, this goes down if I decide to guzzle $100 at a time). This means that when I haul my a** out the door around 7am, I'm not likely to have a fist full of dead presidents to buy my breakfast with.\n\nI was willing to put up with the dirty looks every time I cost the poor shop owners 2.29% (that's roughly 12 cents) on a credit card transaction first thing in the morning. When I went to pick up my usual breakfast on May 29th, I was told that I would now be billed $6 for my breakfast sandwich due to my use of a card.\n\nWow, really?\n\nAllow me to clarify something for the management at GGMC.\n\nIf I take out cash so that you don't have to spend 11.5 cents extra (how much do those ingredients actually cost you?), it costs me $3 at the local ATM robbery station. I understand that 12 cents is an inconvenient amount to have to spend on the lazy commuters who don't want to spend $3 to give you cash, or walk the extra mile in the morning, but your policy has gone from obnoxious to insulting.\n\nI like your product. I don't have any love left for you. I can just as easily buy my breakfast on the other side of the bay when the ferry pulls into Tiburon. The Servinos own a lovely little cafe at that ferry landing where they don't act like my plastic is going to put them out of business if I patronize their shop with it.", "author": "Ian A."}

There is the Hot Food section where I go to buy their, OH. MY. GOODNESS. Chicken and Turkey Pot Pies.\n\nChicken Pot Pie- filled with lots of shredded chicken, seasoned with herbs (I believe oregano and lots of it...), mixed with onions in a delicious velvety cream sauce that will knock your socks off! Topped off with the most buttery and flaky crust. I'm going to need a minute to recollect my thoughts...\n\n...okay, I'm back.\n\nTurkey Pot Pie (Thanksgiving dinner in your mouth)- filled with lots of shredded turkey, mushrooms, potatoes and carrots in a velvety cream sauce similar to the Chicken Pot Pie minus the oregano. Also topped off with the same buttery and flaky crust *drools*. Not only does it taste like Thanksgiving dinner it also smells like it.\n\nThey also offer a wide variety of other delicious meats and sides such as...\n-Beef Pot Pie (will try soon)\n-All Beef Hotdog\n-Meatloaf\n-Sausage on a Stick (mild or spicy) served with brown mustard (one of my favorites)\n-Pastrami and Italian Beef sandwiches \n-French Bread Pizza topped w/Cheese, Pancetta and Olives\n-Macaroni and Cheese (YUM)\n-Grilled Vegetables\netc. etc. etc.\n\nWhat is also great, is the actual Golden Gate Meat Co.

Then to Golden Gate where the service was also great but the \"so called\" pastrami was $18/ pound so at that price it would want to be good.\n\nI say \"so called\" quite deliberately because the meat they gave me wasn't pastrami at all but rather an el cheapo smoked beef that had not really been smoked at all.  It had been rubbed with whatever the chemical is that is used to make extra smoky immitation bacon.

For me, at least, the location is the one minus.  On the positive side, this is the second year I have ordered and bought my Christmas birds from Golden Gate, and been incredibly happy with the quality.  For 2010, I called every butcher shop in town looking for fresh pheasant, every one except Golden Gate told me there was only frozen pheasant in San Francisco.  Golden Gate said they could get fresh pheasant and it was less expensive than all the other shops.  I didn't really believe them after what every other shop told me, but they were sealed by the farm.  I looked it up and the farm said they only ship fresh, never frozen pheasant.  Great tasting too.\n\nThis year, I wanted quail, but the frozen ones in the Asian markets don't ever taste as good as the ones in better restaurants.  I haven't tried the store in Chinatown that appears to have them fresh, but they are even more inconveniently located.  So I went back to Golden Gate, ordered my quail.  Expensive (really expensive) but never frozen and deboned.  Usually I debone my own, but this saved me some time.  Stuffed them with cornbread andouille stuffing and roasted them.  Best quail I've ever made.\n\nThey also carry Mary's chicken, which I buy close to home but can say is the best chicken I have ever had, and I also picked up my andouille there, which was fresh and good, far better than buying packaged.\n\nIf I am in the Ferry Building for lunch, I usually get their pulled pork sandwich, which needs a lot of hot sauce but is otherwise one of the best deals there.", "author": "Spike S."}

I like some vegetables on my sandwiches, not just slices of meat and bread.\n\nSo instead, I purchased a turkey pot pie. The crust was flakey but there wasn't nearly enough turkey for my liking. The pie tin was primarily full of over-salted gravy without the veggies or meat like I expected from golden gate. It was $6 for a very filling pot pie, and with sandwiches at $8 it's probably still the cheapest lunch in the Ferry Building, but I would rather pay a little extra for my lunch and get something exceptional instead of mediocre prepared food from Golden Gate.\n\nThey're still a 4 star place for their selection of meats, but I won't be going back there for prepared lunches in the future.", "author": "Stephanie H."}

This co-worker had made anti-gay remarks in front of me in the past. On my last day on the job, my boss asked me to leave early and said she needed to speak to me. She walked me to the back room and without any explanation immediately said \"We have to let you go.\" and handed me my last check and some tip money. I was shocked and didn't know what to say. I asked her if I had done something wrong and she told me, \"You're not a good fit. It's just not working out.\" She didn't apologize or convey any empathy towards me whatsoever. The next thing she said was \"Could you go ahead and leave your work shirt behind?\" I couldn't because I had no undershirt. I don't know whether to pursue a legal case or what, since I was let go before the end of my 90 day probation period. I was never given any indication that my work performance was lacking. I'm a good worker and a friendly employee, and never did anything to deserve this kind of disrespectful, cruel, and dismissive treatment. The co-worker who made anti-gay remarks since the second day I had been working there, happens to be my boss' niece. I believe she either made up a story about me to her aunt, or she straight out told her I was gay and/or that she didn't want me working there, and that was the end of my job. A comment she made shortly after I began working there, was concerning two men who were greeting each other in front of our store. We were talking and as they approached each other she asked me if they had kissed. I said \"No, why? Do you know them?\" and she responded \"No, I just don't want to see that.\" I was shocked by her comment, and immediately became fearful for my job there. I never lied or denied being a lesbian. The question never arose, since she was never very friendly towards me anyway. I've never dealt with discrimination such as this. I feel completely crushed and confused. All I can ask people to do at this point, is to not give Golden Gate Meat Company your patronage.

I think the only non-meat items I saw were the mac-and-cheese and the small tray of potatos and vegetables (garnish), but they were easily dwarfed by the selection of meat foods.\n\nIt's a small joint, so walking through the Ferry Building you might miss it, but if you stop for more than a moment you'll see the fine selection of meat-centric meals waiting to satisfy your luncheon needs.\n\nI had the Pastrami (with cheese, no mustard - sorry NYC heritage!) and mac and cheese.  Both were delicious and I couldn't even come close to finishing them.  $10 total.  I grabbed one of their lemonade cups and it was also unusually delicious (that was $1.50 extra, but perfect for the meal).\n\nBest of all, for a OCD hand person such as myself, they have a bin of handi-wipes right at the register!  That pushed them from 4 to 5 stars.\n\nThere's no lack of good food at the ferry building, all of it expensive, but for a walkaway ten spot this is a must-visit.", "author": "Matt H."}

It is HUGE.  Served on a fresh sweet french roll from Acme next door, squirted with spicy deli mustard, the fresh slices are pulled right out of their own au jus and stuffed into the bread.  Must be a pound of meat on there and they don't bother weighing it or anything.  The hot meat girl wraps it up in foil paper and you're good to go for 6 bucks.  \n\nThe not quite so good: I've tried a number of other things here, none of which were as good as the pastrami, that's why I can't give this deli and butcher shop a full battery of stars.  The ribeye steak wasn't as tender as a good ribeye should be, the chicken pot pie was mostly crust and a little skimpy on the filling, the pizza had little chunks of fatty diced pork on it and was far from tasty, and the ground chuck is nothing too out of the ordinary, giving my burger an unwanted mealy texture. \n\nAnyhow, go for the pastrami.

I want to go for lunch, I go out hoping to eat some meat on a nice sunny Friday afternoon, I do not check my android for any recommendations and fall for the name.....how bad could be the meat at a place named meat company !! Well guess what, if you are looking for dessert made of barbeque beef, this is the perfect place. I have had sweet bbq sauce and I have had sweeter bbq sauce, but if the sauce is made of sugar syrup, I think its no longer a bbq sauce but a dessert dressing. The meat was not bad in itself, it could have been so much better if paired with the right sauce instead of a very sweet liquid with no condiments !\n\nWell, thats not the end of it though or actually not the start, even before you have tasted your food, the cashier girl gives you a taste of her attitude. Smiling at customers who are paying almost $10 for lunch might just get you some tips in that empty tip jar, or probably she was practicing for her poker night.

At $8, you get a huge sandwich with a lot of thinly sliced, tender beef and tangy BBQ sauce.

Well, that's usually...\n\nYesterday I went to GGMC because I had decided to make my boyfriend rack of lamb for his birthday dinner.  First off, I should admit I know less about cooking than I do about buying meat, so this was going to be an ambitious project all around! However, the counter guy at GGMC in the Ferry building was so amazingly patient and helpful that all of my fears disappeared! Not only did they have exactly what I was looking for, but the counter guy actually talked me into buying less meat than I was planning on.  For me, this is a sign of a great butcher.  He knew how many servings I was looking for, and he didn't try to upsale me.  Which  is awesome, considering rack of lamb costs about $19.99 a pound and I ended up buying a half rack (for two people) for $11.70. \n\nSo, next time I need something to cook that was once an animal, I'm heading to GGMC, no question!\n\nMany thanks to everyone who helped yesterday, dinner came out amazing and the boy was incredibly happy!", "author": "Tiffany S."}

Gosh, i wish they told me it sucked before i bought it so that at least i could've had my expectations set and lowered before biting into the damn thing. The pizza had bacon and mushroom on it. it looked good on display but when i bit into it, it was hard and dry so it all crumbled apart after that first bite. I have a yucky feeling that it was yesterday's pizza just reheated. I went back to tell them about it. The 2 girls at the counter laughed and apologized but no money back or replacement pieces.

The meatloaf was too dry and salty, and still flavorless. It had a very dark black color to it, so it wasn't attractive looking. I'm used to meatloaf that had ketchup/bbq sauce on top and that was missing. Also the sauce wasn't good either, it was equally flavorless. \nthe vegetables with potatoes were alright, nothing special. i could've made better at home really.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-02-24", "description": "I think that America needs to take a step back in time to an era when everyone got their chops and loins  from a neighborhood butcher.  Y'know, the kind that'll save a lamb legbone as a treat for your dog.  Now that most of America gets prepackaged meat, Golden Gate is a rarity ensconced in the gourmet shrine that is the Ferry Building.  Golden Gate has quality meat, and like any good butcher, you can call ahead for unusual requests for non-standard cuts or variety meats.  You can ask them to French a crown roast and they won't look at you like you're a perv.\n\nHowever, Golden Gate leaves me wanting because sometimes, the people who work there can be a total stick in the mud (or something else that rhymes with \"stick\").  Now, I would never malign a purveyor of meats without good reason.  And I'm sure they have to deal with a lot of douchebags who think they're Emeril or Thomas Keller due to the Ferry Building locale, but sometimes, I ask a simple question and get stonewalled with attitude.  Is it that stupid to ask what the difference between two pastramis if there is a tag that says \"Golden Gate natural pastrami brisket\" and one that says \"David's pastrami\"?  Well, excuuuuse me if I don't know that the two separate tags are for the same hunk of meat!  And it's not even the kind of goodhearted attitude I appreciate, like the dudes at Genova Deli in Oakland.  The grumpy old guys there would mock-groan when I ask them to carve out the bread a little for my meatball sandwich, but they do it and give me a \"Weeelll, I'm only doing this special for you\" smirk.  They know how to charm, and it makes their food taste extra good.\n\nI guess what I hope for every time at Golden Gate, besides thick cut veal chops or beautiful steaks, is a special little interaction you get when you buy from someone who gives a damn.  What can I say, butcher shops make me sentimental about the way things used to be in this world.  Golden Gate gives a damn about meat, but sometimes I get treated like I'm a piece of meat, chopped liver to be precise.  And that, my friends, makes me a little sad, like when I think about carbon monoxied-treated prepackaged meat.", "author": "maiko h."}

We got suckered into a couple of sandwiches. I was torn between the hot pastrami and their signature pulled roast chicken sandwich. We decided to get both and share. My bad for misinterpreting the menu. It said, \"Pulled roast chicken sandwich with our own honey mustard\" Ok, sounds harmless enough right? I love me some mustard. Man, I don't know if there was more mustard or more bread. The chicken was absolutely doused in mustard. And we're not talking just spread on, it was literally tossed through every single piece of pulled chicken. Now I love mustard, but not this much. The pastrami was good too...nothing to write home about. It was hot, that was for sure but a little fatty. Luckily, the mustard wasn't too heavy on that one. \n\nNext time, I might ask for the chicken sandwich, hold the mustard.....please!", "author": "Josephine H."}

Never liked the looks of it soaking in all thsoe juices, but turned out to be superbly delicious. They use David's pastrami which is one probably the best stuff not coming out of NYC.

It doesn't have much of a menu, but there are daily specials that change regularly and the food is decent priced for being in the ferry building. The first time we went i had the meat loaf, which was excellent and a side of vegetables that were decent and some oily potatoes. Sharon had a hot dog...normal. The second time we split the special chicken enchilada casserole, which was delicious.", "author": "Matt H."}

Their products are absolutely excellent and their service is even better.  You might pay a slight premium over chain supermarkets, but Golden Gate's prices are better than any of the \n\"high-end\" markets in the city or Marin that I've been to.

I've been going to them 2x a week or so since they opened in the Ferry Building.  Everyone who works there is friendly, knowledgeable and when you're not sure what you want, patient. The NY Organic steak is to die for, especially with the dry rub (you MUST get the dry rub!) A little expensive, but great for an exceptional piece of meat (or chicken, bacon, or whatever other meat you're looking for).  This place has spoiled me...I can never go back to eating supermarket meat again.", "author": "Madhavi K."}

Even better than the overpriced stuff on the Lower East Side (sorry but it's true). And they used fresh bread from the bakery next store. Can't beat that! Shame is that only topping available is mustard which is good but I had to go to Max's to buy pickles. What the fuck is up with serving the best pastrami on earth with no pickles? Sounds like my personal hell. Next time I'll brind my homemade pickles with me. It's actually really hard to find good pickles around here. Don't know why Bay Area is crap for delis in general. I mean jeez it's too the point where I think Lee's is good because it's cheap, consistent, and efficient.", "author": "Todd H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-11-24", "description": "While I am surprised at dismayed by the scarcity of quality butchers in San Francisco, Golden Gate Meat Company eases the pain.  The meats are generally of excellent quality and the selection is wide -- offering both standard and less common meats (i.e., quail) and cuts (i.e., true hangar steaks).  Most of the countermen are true butchers -- they know their stuff and are happy to cut to order.  One star off, however, for the one or two occassions that I was served by someone less knowledgable.  Bonus: the barbecue and other hot sandwiches available for carry out are delicious and a great value when you need a bellful of beef in a hurry.", "author": "Charlie Z."}
