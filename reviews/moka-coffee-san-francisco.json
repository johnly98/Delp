She was wearing rubber gloves, touching all the ingredients, then also opening the microwave with those same gloves!! \n\nNot impressed how they touched the food and appliances! I suggest you guys put forks or spoons on all of your ingredients so your employees don't touch food and everything else at the same time.

Here's how it went down:\n\nI order a Cafe Au Lait from the smarmy guy at the register. He tells the other guy near the espresso machine to make a cafe au lait. Other guy grabs the teeniest cup (4oz) and proceeds to make some type of drink. When he hands me the mini cup, I ask if it is a drip coffee with steamed milk and he says no. \"It's a double shot of espresso with foam on top.\" Hm, well that isn't what I asked for. So I politely tell him cafe au lait is just drip coffee with steamed milk, no espresso. Cafe (coffee) + Lait (milk).\n\nHe dumps out whatever was in the teeny tiny cup, fills it with a splash of drip coffee, and proceeds to steam some milk. I ask if I could have a bigger cup (is it really $4 for 4oz of drip coffee?) so he tosses the baby cup, grabs a larger cup (12oz) and fills it halfway with drip coffee. No matter, I think, the steamed milk will make up for all that empty space in the cup. Nopedy nope, wrong I was. After he finishes steaming the milk, he scoops out only the foam (what is it with this guy and foam?) and places it atop the drip coffee. By now the 12oz cup is a little over half full. He slides it over to me and I actually get two steps out the door before I decide to turn around and ask for a drip coffee instead. \n\nI could have walked ten more feet to Bob's Donuts for drip coffee, or two blocks up to Contraband for fancy pour-over, or even down the street to It's a Grind where the coffee is subpar but predictable. I should have read a few reviews before wandering into Moka. Even the dirty diner nearby (which I won't name) can make a Cafe Au Lait, and their drip coffee is better.", "author": "Shaina V."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-05-13", "description": "Moka Coffee used to be the Nob Hill outpost of Royal Ground Coffee. Closed since January 2013, they opened again today after a heavy remodeling (May 13, 2013).\n\nAlas, the new look is proof what happens when you don't get a good interior designer for a remodeling. Let me explain.\n\nThe good: The space is much brighter now. They retained the same great baristas (hey Hennessy!). The coffee still packs a punch, though it's 30 percent more expensive now. Espresso drinks saw a 50 Cent mark-up, too. Someone's got to pay for them new chairs.\n\nThe bad: The coffee bar got moved to the left side and is much bigger now - it easily takes up 60 percent of the space. The unlucky Fourth Wave at Polk and Bush comes to mind, incidentally closed for a remodeling right now. As a side effect, there seems to be much less seating now - gone are the quirky bench and the round tables on both sides of the shop. There is a window bar where you can sit and face Polk Street, but then you will block the view of the folks sitting on the four tables seating four persons each. On those you will feel oddly trapped, looking at backs and butts of people instead of at Polk Street. Five tables with two bar stools each are directly across from the bar, further narrowing the space between it and the right wall.\n\nThe ugly: The bar also contains a food area (not in operation yet). With a fridge. That runs so loud that even the music has a hard time drowning it out. You can even hear it from the outside of the coffee shop. With so many flat surfaces inside, the acoustics are horrible. With seven patrons and three guys behind the bar, we already hit 80 dB and my friend and I had to speak up to understand each other.\n\nRoyal Ground used to be a place that fostered community. You were able to sit back and relax, maybe listen in on other folks' sometimes rowdy conversations, share some of your own wisdom and make new friends in the process. Now it's more about being lonely together - you face a maximum of three people and have to talk in raised voices to be able to be heard by them.\n\nIn a nutshell, this rebirth is a metaphor for what's happening in San Francisco right now. Quirky places with character are going away, making room for identikit spaces without soul. If that's what the folks riding the Google bus to Silicon Valley like, okay. But it's not something that I or my friends enjoy much.\n\nThat said, I'm not one of those that say everything old is good and needs to stay. Top loading washing machines are bad. So are 100 year old sliding windows with a gap that allows the wind to blow into your apartment with force. I just wish the remodeling would have been more in tune with the previous vibe of Royal Ground.\n\nI will be back for a coffee. I just won't enjoy sitting down and watching people while drinking it anymore.", "author": "Roland A."}

A tea bag in a cup of water was nearly $3.00. I had to ask for a sleeve so I could pick up the cup and she looked annoyed.

The place feels clean; the folks behind the coffee bar are sweet and welcoming; and, the mural and \"life\" quotes on the walls are great.  \n\nI ordered a latte for $3.50 and while it was nothing spectacular, it definitely hit the spot.   I sat on the stools along the front window in the sunshine and read my book while occasionally checking my email.  Perfectly relaxing one hour break from my day.\n\nThings to note: there's a $5 minimum for credit cards; they serve food (bagels + cream cheese and a variety of sweets); and there's two tables out front if you want fresh air while getting your caffeine fix.", "author": "Kimya P."}

She makes food fast and hot, and is really pleasant to her customers.\n\nThis is the cafe that used to have the weird vibe - and 99% of that has gone. It's now more hipster. In a good way :-)\n\nThe lattes are always stellar! There is a gluten-free pastry available, along with yoghurts, sandwiches (BLT is good!) and a basket of fruit.\n\nOne request for the manager: Some wacky customers harassing other customers on the premises. Oh Mister Manager, please can you make your customers feel like the cafe is more safe and welcoming?\n\nOtherwise, still a great place to hang out!!", "author": "Jen S."}

The staff is really nice and the vibe is good, though.  It is near TOAST, which always seems to have a line wrapped around the block for American brunch these days.  So, the overflow crowd seems to stop by here for a coffee while waiting.  There is wi-fi and some tables for seating and people watching on Polk.  Also, on warm days, they leave the windows and door open, which makes a great spot to enjoy the nice weather AND your coffee.", "author": "Hiromi N."}

Had an almond milk latte and a sandwich and my friend got a cappuccino with a cookie. I told them we were eating there (and not taking our orders to-go) so I was surprised they served my latte in a paper cup, unlike my friend's drink which they served in an actual mug. Thought service in that case was a bit off. They also didn't bother to bring out my order as we sat outside, so my sandwich had been sitting on the pick up counter forever. If they called it out I definitely didn't hear it. Another service point docked there. I've had many almond milk lattes from various places and I'd say theirs was ok. Service was spotty.

I have lived in this neighborhood for six years, and I used to walk by the old Royal Grounds every evening... quickly... trying to ignore the odd characters parked outside sipping coffee and smoking cigarettes.  You could not pay me to go in there.  The old dark, dreary cafe is gone, and now we have a nice, bright local establishment that provides a much needed alternative to It's A Grind (meh) and Crepe House (I am still upset at how much their coffee started sucking as of a few years ago) and is not as far of a walk (uphill) as my new favorite coffeeshop Flour + Co. and the tried and true Contraband (also farther and slightly uphill).\n\nI tried the carrot ginger bread this morning -- moist, spicy, delicious.  Their coffee is good, not great, but it does the trick.  I will be getting morning coffees from here instead of the Starbucks by my office from now on.
