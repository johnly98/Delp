I ordered the roasted turkey, which had the correct combo of flavors with pesto, spinach, avocado...just a great twist of flavors. I also got the s'mores crepe and added strawberries.

Also, I was pleased that the s'more was offered in dark chocolate, as I am a fan, and I think it would have been ruined. \nThe crepes are a bit pricey at over $10 bucks a piece, especially since there is some competition in the area at a $7-$8 range. Also, depending on when you come, the wait can be long, because they are made one at a time, and if person before you has ordered multiple for their office, it could be awhile!

My coworker calls it \"requesting a crepe from the crepe gods\" due to the towering height of the window.\n\nThere's sometimes a little bit of a wait, but it's never been more than 5-10 minutes.

I've been meaning to try Creperie St Germain for some time now so I figured why not? I ordered the #1 (cheese egg ham) and the #18 (salted caramel).\n\nFirst off, these are not true buckwheat galettes. They don't have the gritty grainy texture of buckwheat, nor the crisp texture or the bubbles. If there is buckwheat flour in these crepes, it's definitely mixed into a while flour batter because the color and texture aren't right.\n\nNext, my savory crepe was missing the egg. The ham was cut into chunks which wasn't what I expected. I don't know why but in my mind I pictured sliced ham instead of diced ham. Unfortunately, the caramel crepe was also a disappointment. The caramel was a thin, watery caramel and you could barely taste it between the layers of the uncrisp crepe. It was reminiscent of the \"caramel\" used in Starbucks drinks.\n\n$13 lesson learned. Won't be going back here anytime soon!\n\n\nETA: I posted a photo of my crepe that was missing the egg, and Yelp removed it because it was \"not representative\" of the business. Well, it was representative of *MY* experience with the business. SMDH", "author": "Bella L."}

I shouldn't compare its flavor to that of the Braised Beef because the Smoked Turkey fell flat in terms of character. A friend chided me about it. The whole ensemble's flavor should be mute given that it's turkey. I'll stick with my #12, thank you.\n\nUnfortunately, their #20 chocolat, brownie chunks avec la cr\u00e8me chantilly was a disappointment. Elle m'a de\u00e7ue! I needed my chocolate fix, and I ordered this to satisfy my craving for chantilly  (j'adore). The entire piece was dry, not just because of the crumbly brownie chunks, but because they forgot to include the chantilly. :( My chantilly!

At least the CAGG truck has reliable hours (evenings only).\n\nSecond, the hours listed in every single media article has been wrong. Last year, I came to this location 5 or 8 times only to find it closed. Argh!!! (I didn't deduct any points for wasting my time). Their occasional random twitter posts are ineffective in comparison to other street vendors. Because most other vendors post twitter updates ASAP when they decide to change hours or close early. So far CSG has not done that, leaving many prospective customers in the dark. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QCZP-ZX487RXaVncZzeo2A/l\n\nWell then, I'll be the helpful one to tell you their hours. They are open for lunch and close around 3pm on weekdays. On Friday and Saturday they open at 9pm until around 2am (maybe).\n\nThey use buckwheat on the batter which supposedly is better for you. Just like a thin soft unsweetened pancake, folded and filled with your choice of sweet or savory items. I ordered the crepe with apple, brown sugar and cinnamon ($5.50). http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/oixCo2vGHoULlgFhehrXgw/l All prices are under $10, and many are under $6.

Don't bother ordering if you see many people ahead of you (unless you like to wait). http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0BwGnQRXsFhn1caZe7QZTw/l\n\nPersonally, I prefer the crispy Japanese crepes from places like Sophie's Crepes, Genki, or Belly Good Cafe (and other places I can't remember right now).\n\nUpdate: They've moved.

I was searching on yelp for a new place to eat for lunch and came across this creperie I remember seeing some late nights at Temple.. I've always wanted to try this place but never had cash on me when I came around.. I decided I'd have time to go to the bank, get cash, and try this place out in my short 30 minute break.. I assumed it was still in the same place but it wasn't so I called to ask where they were.. \n\nThe girl who answered the phone was friendly, telling me they were actually on 2nd and Howard in front of Umbria.. Okay cool. So before she hung up, I SPECIFICALLY ASKED if they had SHRIMP still because it was the only thing on the menu that I had interest in trying.. She said yes and so I said great, I'll be there in a few..\n\nI get there, and this couple in front of me were rummaging through their stuff because they didn't have enough money to pay for their two crepes.. This goes on for awhile, then the girl suggests an ATM nearby.. They end up finding more cash/change/whatever but they were still short .20 cents.. The girl says it's okay but you can tell it really wasn't because she was slamming around the cash in irritation.. They already had their crepes so she just turned her back on them and the couple went on their way and even shouted out that they'll be back to cover the 20 cents.. I'm sure he said that because he saw the irritation in her actions.. \n\nSo I get to the window and awkwardly stand there for a while because she had her back turned to the window.. When she finally turned around, I placed my order for the #19 and she goes, oh that was you that called.. I was like yeah, I thought you guys were over there by Temple cause that's where I saw you before.. Then we make a little small talk about the Transbay Terminal being built there when the guy in the back tells her they're out of shrimp..\n\nThe girl seemed to be concerned, telling him that I had just called asking for shrimp.. He goes and says, well we had shrimp when you called but that girl before you ordered it so we ran out.. Really? You couldn't tell me that when I called? That you only had enough for ONE more order that wasn't mine but instead, the girl who didn't even pay full price? Unbelieveable..\n\nAnd even worse, they didn't really recommend an alternative or offer some kind of restitution for having told me they had something and then coming to find out they don't.. I asked if they could substitute the shrimp with anything else since I wasn't really interested in any of the other crepes.. They kept suggesting to put the little shrimp into an entirely different crepe.. I don't understand why they kept trying to push me to try something I didn't really want. I also don't understand why they couldn't just add more avocado or even leaves to the crepe I had wanted.. I would have been okay with that.. I even asked them if they could just make it with what they had, and they just kept saying no they don't have enough.. So I relunctanly asked if they could suggest anything else in hopes they could convince me something else was as enticing but no...\n\nThe guy then said, we'll have more shrimp tomorrow.. We would usually have more shrimp but the guy didn't deliver us enough today..\n\nI'm sorry but I don't want to wait until tomorrow to try something I wanted TODAY.. If you advertise something on your website, or any other media available to consumers, I expect it to be there at the time of order. \n\nBy the time he said that, I felt like they were just trying to get rid of me, so I just asked for my money back and walked away.. I ended up wasting all my lunch and didn't even get to try ANYTHING from this place.. So now I'm back at work, hungry, grumpy and antsy to share this with all of you..\n\nThough this shouldn't seem surprising since it looks like they've shorted a few other yelpers out there too.. \n\nTo think, I was ready to tip them and cover the 20 cents that couple was short of, but it looks like I won't be coming back.. Sad.. I was really excited to have a new go-to-place for lunch..\n\nI guess I'll just stick to Metro Crepes which is much closer to my work and probably won't run out of stuff like this cart..", "author": "Jayne S."}

I have been to much better, much more generous crepe places. Ordered a nutella crepe and one with sundried tomatoes and spinach. When I got in my car and pulled out the nutella one (I was hungry after dancing three hours and dessert first is always a treat!) I was surprised to find it hard, too crispy and with very little nutella in it. It was tiny for $5. \n\nWhen I got home the savory one was in the box in a white paper cone wrapper. I saw the size of the paper cone and thought \"finally, a big crepe.\" Well, the cone was totally false advertisement. The crepe inside it was barely half the size of the paper. There was very little cheese, very greasy sundried tomatoes dripping every where and hardly any onions. Again, a dry crepe and it had been in its box steaming. \n\nHow much did my duo of crepes cost? $15 plus I put a dollar in the tip jar (it was a food truck). So glad I did not tip better cause I would have been even more mad than I was. The crepe truck over near the DNA lounge does a much better job, at a similar price but they give you so much more. \n\nWas it good? Yes, but not worth it for the price and size. My suggestion to them is to ditch the cone wrappers unless they are actually going to make a crepe that fits it.

The savory one was pretty standard -- what you'd get at most chain creperies like the crepevine, etc. -- but nothing special. The dessert one was also pretty standard, but the chocolate/fillings were not spread evenly and so 1/4 of  the time I was eating it, it was just the buckwheat... :(\n\nAnyways, the reason I'm leaving it at 3 stars is because sure, I'd come back -- what else is open so late on a Saturday night in my hood?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-12-07", "description": "So, I've eaten a lot of crepes in my lifetime.  Like, a lot of crepes.  I've had hand-held crepes, fancy dinner-type crepes, traditional crepes, fusion crepes, savory crepes, sweet crepes.  You name it, I have probably found it in a crepe and eaten it.  With that background knowledge, I will now make a statement:\n\nCreperie Saint-Germain makes the very best crepes I have ever eaten.\n\nLike, hands down.  The first time I had one of their crepes I bit into it and actually literally thought, \"This is going to be the best crepe I have ever eaten.\"  And then it was.  And then I went back over the weeks and had some more.  And my opinion has not changed one bit.  If anything, every bite of crepe only serves to strengthen my resolve.\n\nWhy?  Well, I'll tell you!  For starters, I'm super conscious about eating healthy, and while crepes in general are usually on the short list of things I can eat guilt-free, CSG crepes are made with buckwheat - and that's even healthier!  They mention that.  What they don't mention is that, despite being healthier, it's also the squishiest, butteriest, richest tasting crepe around.  I don't even care what they fill it with, as long as I can eat something that tastes that good and is that good for me.\n\nExcept I lied.  I do care what they fill it with.  Which is AWESOME.  They could pretty much change all their menu options to \"awesome, awesome, and awesome with awesomecheese\" and it would be accurate.  This is definitely not objective at all, but the combinations of ingredients they put in their crepes seem very fresh and innovative to me.  They have a lot of vegetarian options, they have shrimp, they have beef, they utilize turkey in a variety of different ways, and the flavors range from the classic to the creative - goat cheese and jalapeno?  Count me in.  My favorite is the ratatouille, and I pay the extra for the goat cheese; it's totally worth it.  Creamy cheese, creamy eggplant, creamy crepe - and then the crunch of the spinach and green onions.  I just had one not 12 hours ago, and I'm ready for another.\n\nI also really, really like the customer service.  When I've been there, the servers are always really friendly and smiley, and don't even mind making a little small talk if they're not crazily busy. :)\n\nOne of the issues that I've come across with is that they do run out of ingredients more often than I might like.  I really don't know how this could be prevented, though, since they're essentially a food stand with a limited amount of space, and are cut off from any sort of larger kitchen.  It definitely pays to have a backup plan if you absolutely don't want your beef to be substituted for chicken, for example.\n\nI also know they don't really do substitutions on request, which would seem odd since they substitute when they run out of things, but not before.  Today I learned that it's because all of their pre-made crepe fillings come pre-mixed.  Fortunately, they also have a really affordable make-your-own option: at other places, custom orders can get pretty spendy, but a custom CSG crepe really isn't too much worse than a regular one.\n\nAlso a downside that goes along with being a food stand and not a restaurant is that there's no seating.  But I do find that it's a perfect way to get out of the office around lunch time, take a nice walk, and either bring a crepe back to work or start stuffing my face on the walk back.\n\nCSG is truly my new favorite crepe place and if you like big, buttery-tasting crepes that aren't actually buttery at all, then eating a CSG crepe will be like dying and going to a heaven where skinny, beautiful people alternate playing harps with gorging themselves on crepes.  And be sure to get a stamp card!  Every seventh crepe is free!", "author": "Becca S."}

It's also folded into a cone so it's more conducive to eating while standing up as opposed to the traditional knife and fork half moon.  I prefer the half moon shape, but appreciated the cone as a good grab-n-go compromise.  The filling options aren't terribly innovative, but as one of the only cr\u00eape stands around, I don't think they need to get into the business of bulgogi and kimchi filled cr\u00eapes like numerous taco joints have started to do in order to have a competitive edge.\n\nChicken Cr\u00eape: So much for light and wimpy cr\u00eapes!

Thank goodness the chicken and mushrooms are smothered in buttery b\u00e9chamel else I might be tempted to start doing yoga.\n\nChocolate & Strawberries Cr\u00eape: Melted scharffen berger chocolate sauce with fresh strawberries... so nice to see this option compared to many cr\u00eape places that get nutella-centric and leave out the chocolate.

There was a good size crowd in front of the creperie around 2:30AM in the morning which I took to be a good sign.\n\nCreperie Saint Germain has a lot of choices, with about 20 savory crepes and 20 dessert crepes to choose from.

I've had crepes in France when I studied abroad and one summer I worked in a cafe making crepes, so I like to think that I know a thing or two about them. From my experience with crepes, I can vouch for the ones at Creperie Saint Germain. They are good. The crepe wasn't too thick or too thin and they were generous with the nutella and strawberries. BUT I will say this, they took waaay too long to make. There were 3 people working in the stand, and yet we had to wait 15 minutes for our crepes after we ordered them. Due to their inefficiency, I think they even ended up making a couple orders twice because they made 3 or 4 unclaimed crepes. On the bright side, since no one claimed them, we snagged a cheese, tomato and mushroom crepe for our friend who hadn't planned on getting one.

I've experienced trauma eating crepes at a different creperie prior to my first visit to Creperie Saint Germain but decided to give this place a chance because of a few recommendations.  \n\nOn a cold and foggy night in San Francisco, I happened to check it out with some friends. This place seems to have crazy lines filled with hungry people ready to feast while being eager to engorge the sweet and savory snacks in front of a crepe truck after a long night partying.  \n\nWith anticipation of disappointment,  I soon realized that the Savory Chicken Crepe I ordered tastes good.  It had sauteed Chicken with Bechamel Sauce and Mushrooms, Tomatoes and Spinach. The combination of the ingredients complemented well with each other.   I had also tried a Crepe filled with Nutella, Strawberries and Bananas .  The melted hazelnut Nutella with warm strawberries and bananas had reinforced the idea that I should try eating Crepes more often.A bit of the juice from strawberries leaked from the crepe.  As the Carl's Jr. slogan goes \"If it doesn't go all over the place, it DOESN'T belong in your face!\" \n\nI tried going back to the crepe truck on another night with some friends, with ridiculous crepe cravings, from out of town to try the awesomeness of this Creperie. The line was longer than last time and did not seem to budge. As we were waiting we had been entertained by some amusing people, such as a stranger with sunglasses that had green lights asking patrons of money.  Eventually hostility arose due to the long wait time and hungry drunk people.  Tensions grew so high that a brutal fight broke out.  It seemed as if multiple fights happening at once, things felt as intense as a scene from the movie Kung Fu Panda but that is just my imagination retelling the story.  No one came in fighting in panda suits.  \n\nI assume fights are not frequently happening in front of a Crepe Truck.  From this recent experience I had my ah-ha moment.

Alas, I came across this adorable little crepe cart after my first day of work and I've been dying to try it out ever since. Fast forward 2 weeks and I find myself debating over which savory crepe to order. \n\nThere's a large variety of sweet and savory crepes including many unique combinations (like smoked salmon with capers, sugar and lemon, chestnut spread, etc).  You can even customized your own crepe!\n\nI'm one of the most indecisive people when it comes to picking what to eat.  After debating for several minutes, I decided on the savory rataouille crepe which is filled with onions, spinach, eggplant, and goat cheese (an add-on). The crepe looked delicious and they definitely didn't skimp on the fillings. \n\nThe crepe was hearty, filling, and thankfully, didn't make me feel weighed down. I liked that it's a healthier alternative to typical street-food. \n\nHowever, what disappointed me about the crepe was its texture. I would have preferred a crisper crepe to compliment, for lack of a better word, the mushy texture of the vegetables inside. Come to think of it, caramelized onions would have been THE perfect addition since it would provide a much-needed \"crunch factor.\" Additionally, the spinach wasn't, surprisingly, not cooked and the vegetables needed more seasoning (salt or pepper). \n\nOn the other hand, the service is great. The guys are lively, funny, and really nice. I even got a free sample of the chestnut spread while I was waiting. \n\nOverall, I had a pretty good/decent experience with this place. For the price I paid ( more than $8), I got a mediocre crepe. Nonetheless, I'll probably visit the card again. But from now on, I'm going to stick with  classics like nutella with whipped cream (yummm). \n\nAnd AWESOME news:  The truck will now be open Friday's and Saturdays from 8pm-4am. YES, until 4 am.

Even though they had JUST SET UP and I was one of the first in line, I was told they were \"out of bananas.\"  :-|  I heard one of the staff suggest getting bananas from the nearby Safeway.  That's fine, but I wasn't aware my premium crepes get their produce from the local supermarket.  Then, the person making my crepe didn't know what went into the crepe and kept asking me, even though there are only 5 ingredients (now down to just 4), and even though it's one of the \"suggested crepes.\"  Also, in case you're wondering, \"Creme Chantilly\" is actually just Redi-Whip from an aerosol can.

If I go to subway, I can get a full meal with chips and a drink for $1-$2 less than this.  I also can get a sit down meal at a cheap Thai restauraunt like King of Thai noodles for the same price.  It also took forever to wait for my food.  I purposely went late hoping to miss out on the crowds and there wasn't a line when I went up to make my order.  However, there was a long line for those who had already ordered and paid.  There were only two people who worked there.  The person taking orders also doubled up making crepes in between taking orders.  There was only one full time person on the crepe line, but I don't think they could fit another person in the cart.  I could see they were scrambling to get the crepes out. My wait was 15-20 minutes for my single crepe.  There were about ten other crepes ahead of me.  If you are expecting something fast and cheap this is not your place.\n\nThe crepe itself was okay.  I had crepe #14 with bacon, mushroom, creme fraiche, and cheese.  It sounds like it would be super yummy and that's what I was going for, but I didn't see any creme fraiche and it was a little bland.  Also, it wasn't served hot.
