Firstly, the owner lady is really nice and friendly. I liked her a lot. She is like your older Chinese aunty (the nice one) that is quite charming and nice. Thing is I was a bit turned off my the paper plates and cups. Not only is it not environmentally friendly, it's really low class for a sit down restaurant, even for a hole in the wall. The food was tasty but salty, however, I did like the freshness of the ingredients. I would give this place another chance to try some other dishes, but for to go orders if I am in the area. \n\nI would say, I would like to continue and support this local business. Good people, good ingredients. Just keep your expectations low and you may be surprised.", "author": "David K."}

The owners/operators Mr. And Mrs. Wong have been opening and closing the doors to their successful business for the past 26 years and counting.  They got to be doing something right, like making sure customers are :)\n\nShe always starts my meal w/ piping hot tea, a cup of hot & sour or corn soup b4 my entree arrives. While having my meal, I usually request an extra bowl of steamed white rice on the side which she never adds any additional cost to my check for this request even tho she has every right to do so.  For this reason, I always leave a bit extra to show my appreciation for her kindness and generosity.  After I'm done with my meal, she offers several slices of orange, a fortune cookie, and a piece of chocolate w/ the check.  For $8-9 plus a buck or two for tips, I can get a huge plate of Mongolian beef over steamed or fried rice, or I might order Kung Pao Chicken over chow mien, but my favorite dish would have to be filets of fish w/ fresh vegetables stir fried in garlic oil.  \n\nI've been eating here for about only 1.5 years, and I've notice 100% inspection card hanging on the wall from Day 1 so they do run a neat & tidy ship here FASHO!!  The phone rings nonstop usually, and a good amount of their business must be for pickup since they don't deliver.  They can also prepare large trays of food for special occasions but require at least two days notice in advance.  They will even let u park in their driveway if u can't find parking nearby.  Since they owned the building as well as the business, they can afford to be more generous than the competition b/c they are not faced w/ a huge overhead that comes w/ commercial leases.  \n\nWhen I'm on a budget, or I just want to grab some food really quick and easy, J & A Restaurant opens 7 days a week even on holidays.", "author": "Randy L."}

Sounds strange, but this place is now one of my all-time favorites. \n\nOrder the shrimp fried rice. It's hot, fresh, and always has a nice crispness to it. Most places drown their fried rice in soy sauce, but this is actually browned on the grill. No nasty frozen peas in this stuff! Just good ingredients, and always consistent.

I called in to place my order and a friendly Chinese lady picked up and took my order. I ordered fried squid, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef over rice, sing chow rice noodle, and a combination wonton noodle soup. She said it'll take about 30-40 mins and I was excited because knowing they have to make everything from scratch and it would be fresh!\n\nWhen I got to this place, it definitely looked like a hole-in-the-wall. But that didn't bother me, I was looking forward to trying the food! Boy, was I disappointed. The squid was decent since it was fried. Fried food in general is good. The hot and sour soup was different from what I had at many other restaurants. It tasted ok overall. They did not separate the wonton and noodles from the soup. They just stuffed it all into a clear container which soaked everything in there... No good. The Mongolian beef wasn't spicy at all when they specifically asked if I wanted it spicy. The texture of the sauce had a bit too much cornstarch and the rice was overcooked where it was mushy. I pretty much picked out the beef and just ate that. Sing Chow rice noodle was probably the most decent entree out of all I've ordered. It was still very greasy.\n\nI really tried to give this place a better rating and I had much higher expectations due to the highly rated reviews.

Now that's classic mom & pop.\n\nThe menu prices need to be updated because their price disclaimer is confusing; essentially, everything was actually an additional $1-2 more.

I went with my mom and my stepdad, and we ordered the sizzling rice soup, the vegetable chow fun, and the cod with curry sauce. The waitress was a very friendly Chinese lady who seemed to be the owner as well (her husband was cooking in the kitchen. The food was all good, but nothing special, and the portions were large as well. Would probably give the food 3.5 stars,  but bumped it up to 4 for the good service.", "author": "Hannah G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-22", "description": "Do you ever notice that many Chinese restaurants have signs or menus touting \"excellent Chinese cuisine\"?  In general, most of them should be charged with false advertising.  J & A has a rag tag outdoor sign (see Google maps) and a menu with pasted on prices.  Their to go menu advertises free delivery, however, since it is just a ma and pa shop, that is not correct.  They have long hours and are open 7 days a week.\n\nWhen our luncheon with a neighborhood couple fell through, my wife surprised me and took me here.  We have been looking for a replacement Cantonese cuisine ever since the \"old\" Kams on Balboa went out of business.  J & A is not quite there, but it is certainly a lot better than many that we have tried.\n\nDriving on Mission Street, you won't even notice the place unless you are actively looking for it.  It looks like a converted residence.  The interior is narrow and rather grimy with stained walls, linoleum floors, and formica tables.  Seating is limited and the waitress is the ma while the cook is the pa.  Payment is cash only.\n\nShe was very friendly and when we placed our order, she immediately brought us some complimentary soup of the day.  Many Chinese restaurants soup of the day consisted of a thin broth with a piece of floating vegetables or some fatty meat.  However, this one had chunks of corn, tofu, carrots, green onions and eggs.  It was very tasty.\n\nWe ordered sizzling rice soup ($6), mongolian beef over rice ($5.50), beef with broccoli ($6.50), and J&A special chow mein ($6).  Our meals came on regular porcelain plates and bowls, but our we were handed paper plates with well-worn silverware to eat from.\n\nThe sizzling rice soup arrived and our waitress dropped the hot rice onto to the bowl of soup.  We knew that we had ordered too much and didn't finish the soup, but ate most of the sizzling rice since it gets too soggy the next day.  The soup had chunks of beef, bbq pork, zucchini, carrots, green onions, broccoli, etc.  It was tasty, not like the old Kams, but still good.\n\nThe mongolian beef was good, but not as spicy as we expected.  It had chunks of bell peppers, and hot red peppers poured over a bed of rice.  The beef and broccoli was also good, but then what could go wrong with this dish?  Our chow mein noodles were similar to what I have made.  The dish had chunks of beef, pork, shrimp, cabbage, onions, etc.  These 3 dishes were very well prepared and not too salty.\n\nOf course, if you are trying to impress a first date, expecting white table cloths and stuffy waiters, this is not the place go.  But if you are interested in excellent food and can tolerate the decorative issues, then this is the place to eat. \n\n We will be back.", "author": "Robert J."}

I'm so upset I found this place so late when it's literally down the street from my place (I could walk here!).  They close at 9 & I came in at around 8:30. The owner-lady asked if we were doing take-out or dine-in & she asked if we could do take-out because they were getting ready to close (not a big deal since we were planning on taking it home anyways). The best part? she felt bad and was apologizing for having us do take-out instead.  She is just the sweetest little thing (reminds me of my mom!). Also when we had to go grab cash (it's cash only) she felt so bad and said next time she'll put a bigger sign LOL I would really love to try dining in here someday. I think their service will probably be one of the best for a chinese restaurant.\n\nThe food was sooooooooo good.  The little chili sauce she has (and recommends) for the entrees were the best little compliment for them.  I think that was what made the entrees so good (we got mongolian beef & a chicken dish I can't seem to remember the name!!!!) \n\nalso instead of fortune cookies, we get chocolate, +1 for them!!!!", "author": "Alice L."}

My grandmother and I we're looking for something quick yet yummy to eat for lunch and that was nearby, so judging from the great reviews, we tried J&A. We we're a disappointed from the service, first and foremost. *Note that it is cash only here!* the review stayed it was a one-dollar-sign, inexpensive place to eat, but from the menu, they hiked their prices up by at least $2 more per entree! I was appalled at how much their food was because we're so used to getting Andy's Chinese food that is well-priced and delicious at the same time. J&A's westlake beef soup was saltier than expected, and the beef with brocolli dish was messily put together on a paper plate. The service wasn't great, but I do respect that it is a small mom & pop business. Our check was given on a ripped out piece of paper place mat, and we we're never checked on during our meal or almost ignored when we asked for to go boxes.

I used to own my Martial Art school across from this restaurant.  A few of our students & I drive down there for our lunch on every Sunday. \n\nOcassionally, we go there for our dinners on Tuesday or Saturday evening. Also, we order some food to go from this restaurant. \n\nThe 2 owners, a husband & wife work so hard to operate this Restaurant.\n \nOne Sunday on every month we conduct the monthly sword study meeting at this place. When approximately 10 of us arrive at this restaurant, the table is already set up and ready to order and eat. We always have various vegetables for our appetizer followed by our individual meal. They do not use the MSG ( Monosodium Glutamate ) for their cooking.\n\nThey serve us many cancer prevention leafy green vegetables ( Pea sprouts, Baby Bok Choy, bitter melon, asparagus, bean sprouts, etc. ) Some vegetables are good for diabetic person. They also have fried chicken, fried prawns ( Entire body or tail portion ) and fried squid as excellent appetizers. I do not eat out often, however, this is the only restaurant we go with our students & family members since their location is near our home and our Martial Art School in the Mission Street area.\n\nA few of our favorite plates: \n1. Shrimp Chow Mein \n2. Curry fish over rice \n3. Wong Ton noodel soup \n4. Curry chicken over rice \n5. Curry prawns over rice \n6. Mongolian beef over rice \n7. Scrumbled egg & shrimp over rice \n8. Hong Kong style cripsy noodle with vegetables \n9. Mixed vegetable fried rice and much much more ! \n\nNow they have a new menu since December 24th, 2010.  The crispy fried onion rings !\n\nWe celebrate our student's birthday party every month at this place. A few times, we had over 20 people attended.

No one thing was particularly out of this world but everything combined is bigger than the sum of its parts. Very much akin to homecooking. The trip out of the Mission district was well worth it. The lady also came to my table on on her own, giving me the check (written on some paper-towl like product) and packing up my remaining food in a  to-go container without me even asking. In all other circumstances I would deem that extremely rude but at that moment, I was so memorized by her food that I was equally awed by her psychic abilities, and happily surrendered myself to her caretaking.", "author": "pH R."}

Yes, the food is normal, deep fried American Chinese food, but that doesn't stop it from being the best Chinese food I've ever had.  The Sweet and Sour pork was amazing:  totally melt-in-your-mouth tender.  The only comparison I can make is like excellent BBQ pulled pork, but this was large chucks of pork, deep fried, and covered in tasty Sweet and Sour sauce.\n\nThe lady who owns the restaurant is really nice!  As you chat while you wait, you can hear her bustling about in the kitchen behind you, making your food fresh like mom used to.  The difference is here, the food is cooked to perfection (no offense mom) and you don't have to do dishes afterward.\n\nHowever, the best part was that she gives you a Bite-sized Baby Ruth with your fortune cookie.  How cool is that!?\n\nOne caveat:  they take only cash, so if you don't have some with you, head down the block to the 24 hour laundry place for an ATM.  It's the closest one nearby.\n\nI recommend it to anyone looking for Chinese food is the Bay Area.  Doesn't get much better than this!", "author": "Nicholas C."}

I think one good way to judge the cleanliness of a food establishment is by the upkeep and maintenance of the bathroom. If it's in a horrible state and reminiscent of an outhouse in a third world country, who knows what's going on in the kitchen. Here, the bathroom is clean and well maintained and nothing to worry about.\n\nBesides that, the food is cooked fresh when you order and very tasty. My favorites are the curry chicken, lemon chicken, salted shrimp, and the thick water bottle-sized egg rolls. I should also mention that the portions are very generous and filling, even for a glutton like myself. \n\nIt's a family owned and operated, literally a mom and pop shop.

I told her I liked her amazing chili sauce/oil and she gave us tons of little containers of it. Then, after thinking for a few seconds, she gave us 1/2 QUART of it. She also throws in stuff for free if you order a lot of stuff. And the prices are already SO low. We ordered tons of food for 5 adults and have enough leftovers for at least another round for us ALL (so that is 10 meals) for $50. The food itself is pretty good, too. We got beef and broccoli, chicken chow mein (big hit with the baby), chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken (which has a comfy, fried flavor), mixed veggies with tofu, ma po tofu with pork (REALLY good here, and I've had that all over the city), and potstickers. All the food is good and did I say that the lady is just so nice. I think everyone should go here and eat so that she can stay in business. It is always empty when I pick stuff up, but I think they do a brisk take-out service. I would actually recommend take-out because the restaurant itself isn't a destination or anything.

The portions are generous, and the old lady who runs it is nice in her own reserved way.  The decor and condition of the restaurant are very \"third-world\" (you know, like you're in some impoverished foreign country).

But Im Chinese and i sometimes want noodle soup or stewed beef brisket, which they don't have.\nSo, I did try their curry chicken and asked for extra spicy and it was decently spicy so that is a plus.

As another reviewer stated, the Mongolian beef over rice is excellent, and their sweet & sour dishes are delicious.  The chicken with corn soup has always tasted fresh, and the mixed vegetables with chicken as well incl. bitter melon etc. which one doesn't taste in some of the more Westernized Chinese restaurants.  It is convenient for take-out, and once you know the neighborhood parking is not a problem.  I have come to realize that some smaller rest's off the beaten track may not have their entire menu on hand, and the owners usually recommend some appropriately similar dish if that is the case.
