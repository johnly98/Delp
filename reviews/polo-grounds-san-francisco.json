When we parked we noticed tgis pub we were next to.  We decided to go there instead and I was glad we made that choice.  When we came in it was a nice atmosphere with clean and friendly staff.  Kyle, one of the bartenders was very nice and conversational.  My hubby and I both orderd  our drinks and found out, that despite it being 10 pm, they were still serving food.  This is unusual for bars/pubs but apparently they are known for their food.  Here is what we ordered:\n\nSteak Street Tacos:  you can't mess this up.  It was delicious and not oily.  The salsa was yummy too.\n\nSide order of tater tots: don't let the name fool you.   This is a large platter of ever crispy tater tots, not oily either.  Comes with nacho cheese and their special spicy ketchup.   \n\nBuffalo wings:  the chicken was meaty and their buffalo sauce....DELISH!\n\nJust these 3 things and we couldn't finish the food.  They were all good and big portions.   Good enough for 3 people.  \n\nAlso while we were there, there were so many take out orders of their burgers which is what Kyle saud is most popular.  Will definitely go back to try other food out.  Oh, and on different nights they have events that go on! Check it out, you will be pleasantly surprised.", "author": "Cecilia D."}

After yelping bars nearby, we decided to check out Polo Grounds. We arrived on Friday, May 11th around 11:15pm. It wasn't too busy, so we easily found four seats at the bar.\n\nFor the first round, I believe some started with Jameson on the rocks (or Jameson and ginger?) while my girlfriend and I had Bulleit Rye on the rocks. Both were somewhat normal pours. (Maybe a little smaller than the standard pour?) After having several cocktails throughout the evening, this was a good way to end the night. For our second round, my friend ordered everyone a Jameson neat. By then I didn't want to drink anymore, but I never waste, so I managed to finish the shot.\n\nThe bar itself is very laid back. It's a pretty good size and that night, there weren't many people here, so we were all able to catch up and talk while sipping on our drinks. The bartender was nice and attentive when needed.\n\nDecent bar to wrap up our Friday. Good for whiskey sipping and catching up on a low key night.", "author": "Elena N."}

There is plenty of space to move around (or dance if that's your thing) and plenty of seating if you just want to hang out and chill. I came with a large party and both the patrons and staff were very friendly. Our drinks were fast and accurate and the pricing was great. Shera helped our big group for the night and she was amazing!

The tots are amazing! So crispy & crunchy. The pupu platter was interesting lol. They had 2 types of wings, which were great (even 2 dipping sauces). There were more tots in the platter.

My meal was excellent! The sandwich had big chunks of lightly fried chicken with a little bit of buffalo sauce, along with lettuce and tomato. The French roll was soft and chewy, just the way I like it. I asked for extra hot sauce because the chicken was a tad dry, but adding that on made the sandwich perfect. And the chili, boy-howdy, that was some of the best chili I've had outside TX (and better than plenty I've had inside the Great Republic!). It was a decent-sized cup as a side, it was hearty, meaty, thick, with beans, meat, and onions. It had a little bit of a kick of spice, just enough to make my mouth tingle a bit.\n\nI had a couple beers, which were solid. I also ordered a cocktail which was not great and about twice what I would have expected to pay for such a drink. So, moral of the story: don't get a cocktail here.\n\nAll in all it was a great bar with great beer and food, just don't get a \"fancy\" cocktail (i.e., shots or 2 ingredients max).

I had to choose either here or Momos. From the horror stories that I have heard about Momos I knew exactly where I was heading. \n\nI walked in and found this place exactly as how I imagined. Couple of suits and then the rest seemed like patrons. I walked up the counter and order a beer and then took my seat. The first thing I noticed is that there are no stools near the windows for sitting. I guess you are suppose to stand and drink your beer if you are over there, hmmm, ok.\n\nThe bartender seemed nice enough. Asked if I wanted to open a tab and I told her no. I am more of a cash guy. In carrying cash you don't spend in excess!!! Cash limits mean moderation and control. Remember that for all you young and underage drinker. Well, if you are underage you probably think you know everything anyway so don't even worry about it. \n\nAs far as the entertainment, there are several TV's inside and they constantly have them going. I think I counted somewhere around 4 TV's I think, maybe more. \n\nThere is an awesome piece of Giants artwork on the wall on the right corner here. \n\nThere was one gentleman that came in that left disgruntled. He came in and sat at the bar but was never greeted or served. I saw him sit for approximately 15 minutes. I do not know where the bartenders were but they were no where to be found. I felt bad for the guy.\n\nAlso, there was a guy and girl that came in and the dude was just odd. He kept lifting his shirt and talking very LOUDLY!! Eventually he and his friend descended to a booth but he was just no appropriate for this place. The sad thing about it is that he seemed like a regular. \n\nEventually as it closer to game time more people came in. A family even came in with their baby. It was weird seeing a baby in a pub but they also serve food so it's okay, I GUESS!!! \n\nThe pricing of the beer here is decent. Nothing too obscure in the pricing of the beers or well drinks. \n\nI will return again at some point. Oh, and nobody bothers you too much either.

Folks were visiting and we decided to grab an early dinner before the Giants game. First off, be prepared, because their cocktails are damn strong. I ordered the Blueberry Lemonade Vodka something-or-other. Not only was it delicious but boy buddy, shit hit me quick!!! When the server came back I got another and was smashed before 5. Then I ordered onion skins and sweet garlic wings for us, and boyyy those did not last! Chicken was tender and juicy, sauce on it was to die for, and those onion strings were sooo delicious, especially dipped with ranch! We should have ordered two for our table of five, but our entrees came out and those were so worth the wait! I got the amaze-rolls, which reminded us of lumpia but stuffed with pulled pork and super crispy on the outside. The rolls were drizzled with chipotle and had a dipping sauce that reminded me slightly of the sweet chili sauce we usually use at home for egg rolls. It might've been, I was too drunk to tell. My dad kept reaching over and grabbing my food, because, don't get me wrong, his Asian Ginger Chicken Sesame salad was apparently very good, but my Amaze-rolls were irresistible!

My coworkers and I came here for a few drinks and appetizers during the 5 inning of a Giants game. We ended up ordering over $300 worth of food and drinks. However, I have never been so disrespected and utterly upset at the way we were treated by the staff.\n\nThere was a pool table that had its cover on and we asked the bartender if we could play. She blatantly ignored us and went back to helping the regulars sitting at the bar top. There were a total of 10 people in the bar, 6 of them were myself and my group. We wanted to play pool so we took off the cover, there were no rules or signs stating that we couldn't play or use the table, so we went for it.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later, the bartender that originally ignored us came rushing over. She called my coworker a drunk idiot and continued to cuss at him and our group. She told us that we were making her job more difficult than it needed to be. She then grabbed the pool cues and threw them by my coworker's feet and saying extremely unprofessional things about us like if we weren't even standing there.\n\nShe then continues to tell everyone in the bar including the people at the bar, the other bartenders, and the bouncer about how idiotic we are. So we don't let it bother us and continue playing pool. I guess this made her really upset because she comes back to us to cuss at us some more. Then the bouncer comes over to us and explains that they typically don't allow people to play pool while the Giants' game is on because it gets too crowded. Then he tells us that he has to kick us out because we made the bartender really upset.\n\nHer behavior just didn't make any sense to me. If she knew we weren't supposed to be playing pool at the time, then why did she bring out the cues? Also, there were no instructions about when we could play, so she could have easily come up to us and explained it, just like the bouncer did.\n\nOverall, horrendous experience and I will never recommend this place to anyone.", "author": "Theo T."}

With an hour to kill before the game, we made our way past the crowds of people to have a beer. Although the bar was packed, we were lucky enough to get a table. If you think you can grab a table to enjoy a beer - think again. Tables are reserved for customers ordering food, so after looking over their menu we ordered half a dozen wings, fries and two beers.\n\nWe didn't come in thinking we'd grab some food, kudos to Polo Grounds on making a bit more money off the AT&T crowd. Coors Light was $5 for a pint or you could get a pitcher for $20 which has roughly 4 beers. Rather than have our beer sit at the table and rise in temperature, we ordered beers as needed. 10 to 15 minutes later our appetizers came out and although I didn't indulge in the wings, I was told they were great. I did, however, try the fries and they were better than expected: seasoned, flavorful, and crispy.\n\nService was great beginning to end which was very surprising considering the large crowd. At one point, our waitress forgot to bring me a beer and was quick to apologize and didn't charge me for the beer. A very nice gesture that was factored in when leaving her tip. With a great layout, plenty of beer, TVs, specials, and great service, Polo Grounds is one of the better (and cheaper) places to drink and eat before, during or after the game.\n\nAmbiance/Decor: 4/5\nFood: 4/5\nService: 4/5\nPrice: $$\nOverall: 4/5\n\nPros:\n+ Across the street from AT&T Park\n+ Full bar with specials (non game days)\n+ Food menu available with table service\n+ Tasty appetizers (wings and fries)\n+ Great service\n+ Reasonable beer pricing ($5 for Coors Light pint; $20 Coors Light pitchers)\n+ Credit/debit accepted\n+ Wells Fargo ATM next door\n\nCons:\n- Bar will undoubtedly be busy during game days", "author": "Alexander E."}

I could actually talk to my friend and we could hear each other without shouting.  However, there is probably a reason for the lack of crowds.  Food, drinks, and service were just \"okay\" and decor is sort of dark and uninviting.  We tried the \"Amaze-rolls\" which were like fried pulled-pork egg rolls.  These were recommended by the bartender and I liked the crispiness, but the flavor was just average.  They had wine on tap (nice), but ordering one was not easy.  The bartender kept disappearing around the large bar, and seemed to spend most of her time paying attention to the bar-back she was working with instead of the customers.

The chicken sandwich was delicious and well dressed with sliced vegetables. Tater tots were comfort food good, with a spicy ketchup like sauce and a hard to describe but good \"cheese\" sauce - forgot to ask what that one was.  The salad was great, with nice selection of veggies and a hard boiled egg. Extra blue cheese was just right. The chili was well seasoned and meaty - small bowl was perfect size. At lunch you order at the bar, which had lots of workers enjoying a libation before their meal. Or, a beer for their meal ! Hard to tell sometimes. We opted for iced tea, and sat at a table away from bar. The service was quick and attentive, but after second refill and after we had finished lunch and sat for a while the single bartender/waitress was hard to find.

I would have never expected it from this unassuming bar across the street from AT&T park, but their food is pretty darn good. Wednesday is wing night, 50 cents per wing. Also try the tacos on taco night and the fried pickles!\n\nI'm sure it gets pretty packed here during the baseball season. But during off season, it's a pretty chill place to just have a drink and eat some bar food. It's pretty spacious and it doesn't have that trendy/crowded/loud SF thing going on so it's a perfect watering hole with your friends or coworkers. They also have a bunch of TVs showing sports. \n\nWith all that good stuff said, don't expect good mixed drinks here. I've heard that they water down their liquor and their mixed drinks taste really crappy (like an old fashioned, but what the hell am I doing ordering an old fashioned at a bar like this?) Stick with beer and wings and you'll be fine.", "author": "Julie K."}
