We placed a delivery order through DoorDash on Monday, September 10th at 5:53pm. It arrived at 6:47pm. We live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Traditional Wings: 1/2 lb, Buffalo ($8)\n*Mixed Greens: Lettuce, red onions, tomatoes and no black olives, Caesar ($8)\n*Pizza By The Slice ($3.25): Chicken Pesto ($0.75)\n*Combo Classic Pizza: Marinara, salami, pepperoni, mushrooms, sweet green bell pepper, red onions and Italian sausage, Medium 14\" Pizzas ($27)\n\nThe roomie picked the combo pizza. It was a decent combination pizza. Good assortment of ingredients. I did like that the crust was on the thinner side, but it was still a touch too bready for me. Though it did have a nice chew. I adore pesto, so I'm glad they offer slices here. The chicken pesto slice was a good size and fulfilled my need for variety. The wings were okay. The buffalo sauce was too tangy, so we actually had the wings naked. I'm glad they came with celery as I adore my veggies. The roommate's kinda on a diet, so he wanted me to get a salad. This wasn't really a mixed green salad as it only came with romaine, but since we got caesar dressing, it was fine.\n\nAll right spot to grab some pizza. I am glad they offer slices, as I always want a tomato based and a pesto based pie. This way, I didn't have to order a whole new pizza. Overall, A-OK.", "author": "Elena N."}

The coolest little hole in the wall... but it doesn't feel like it because as you enter there are big mirrors on the whole right hand side of the wall. Above way up high tons of baseball caps work well as decoration. I noticed train tracks above too... Not running at the moment but in this place's heyday no doubt there was a train moving about way up there. On the left are signed celebrity photos. The whole place is cool beyond words. Its all stuffed into the smallest storefront imaginable. Its the width of a door and 3 more feet for the counter where the bar stools are.\n\nNow for the pizza. I had high hopes. Although I had a slice, which usually means old and sitting out for 30 minutes or maybe even hours... I had the good fortune to arrive after a new pizza came out of the oven. Half cheese and half pepperoni. I choose cheese only as I'm currently comparison tasting as many of the pizza by the slice places as I can in the city. I'm on a real mission. Each place I go to I try to just get cheese to minimize variables.\n\nSo $3.26 later I get it... uggghhh. I bite in and its more greasy than I would like and the bottom is way too chewy. No crunch. Sadly I've had better frozen pizzas. I really don't understand it. How could this happen to a fresh pizza? Probably I will go back just to confirm. I really want to like this place. They do have other options other than pizza. I strongly suggest you try those other options. Your not missing much with a cheese pizza.\n\nFor the record my favorite pizza by the slice is Golden Boy if you like a thick crust and Pizzelle Di North Beach if you like a thin crust. But my study isn't finished yet. I've yet to try many of the popular pizza places around. For the record Firetrail is awesome with bubbly crust but it doesn't fall in the category of late night by the slice places.\n\nBTW what kind of crazy price is $3.26??? Why not change it to $3.25!! or $3.50??", "author": "Stefan T."}

She looked annoyed from the start. Then I handed her my card to pay and when she was done she threw it on the counter instead of handing back to me. When I was handed my food she had a look as if she was bothered and annoyed. Finally, when I opened the box, the pizza was still cold. \n\nSome of this may seem trivial, but overall her attitude just sucked. \n\nAgain, I don't expect a whole lot when ordering a single slice of pizza, but this was enough to find somewhere else to go.", "author": "Jonathan D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-30", "description": "We all live a fast paced lifestyle. And getting our food quick and on-the-go is key on many occasions. This takes us to the trendy Marina District in San Francisco where you will find \"SF Hole In The Wall Pizza\". Conveniently located on Scott St. and in between Chestnut and Lombard St's., this place has been feeding hungry patrons of every lifestyle since 2012.\n\nI actually stumbled on this place by accident and that was simply walking by (without using the Yelp app on my smartphone). Now that doesn't very often anymore! Reason being is that I needed a quick bite to eat while my lady was getting her hair and nails done. Not to mention, I had already chugged down a few beers at a local sports bar which gave me the munchies after consuming alcoholic beverages.\n\nNow keep in mind, this place literally is a hole-in-the-wall. There is no seating inside but it does offer a few tables and chairs outside. You mainly have to have the mindset that your food will be to-go. Going back to the interior layout of this place.. It is very small but there is enough room to view the menu; one of my gripes is how difficult the menu is to read. There is also a wide array of autographed pictures (which includes the late Robin Williams and others) on the left hand side. You can also see how the kitchen is in the rear of the building. With as tiny as this place is, I am almost thinking that this entire business is only about 400 square feet.\n\nOnto the food; their pizza selections are actually quite extensive. You will find your standard cheese, pepperoni, combination, and vegetarian. And several other creations such as the Margherita, Chicken Pesto, BBQ Chicken and the Pizza Aloha. If pizza isn't your thing, they also serve calzones, burgers, wings, fries, meatballs, sandwiches, and salads. And for refreshments, they have fountain drinks as well as bottled beer. I ended up ordering a slice of their \"Chicken Pesto\" which came to a little over $5.00.\n\nI do like how they put the pizza in a nice little box to fit their New York-styled slice. As far as the taste, I think it was just average at best. I had very little chicken on my pizza and the taste of the basil in the pesto was very subtle. It almost just tasted like a standard cheese slice. Fortunately I was able to dress it up by adding crushed red pepper but that didn't really do much. I suppose if you were extremely drunk, this would taste amazing. But even after drinking three beers, the pizza just wasn't all that.\n\nI do think a place like this will do just fine; simply because its in the heart of the Marina District and also because the shopping in this part of town is thriving. Not to mention, prices on their food is dirt cheap which is all the more reason to get filled up for just a few bucks. Overall, I don't think I will come back to \"SF Hole in the Wall Pizza\". But if you're a pizza lover, I would still consider checking this place out.", "author": "Donovan H."}

SF Hole In The Wall Pizza is aptly named - it's literally a hole in the wall that sells pizza (as well as burgers and a few other things). There's a small counter with a few stools to sit, and there are a few tables on the sidewalk, but I think they belong to the restaurant next door.\n\nThe young woman behind the counter was very friendly and described the various slices she had behind the counter. I ordered the combo slice and a bottle of water for $7. My expectations weren't too high after looking at the pizzas - the crust looked pretty thick, but after she heated up my slice, it was nice and surprisingly crisp. The toppings were OK, however the sausage was pretty disappointing - it tasted like the type of sausage you get on a frozen pizza - not proper Italian sausage.\n\nI would give the pizza a solid 3.5 stars, however my experience was severely downgraded because some homeless/crazy/drugged out guy staggered in while I was trying to eat my pizza and kind of ruined the experience. It's not their fault, but that's just how it is.\n\nAfterwards, I walked a few blocks over to Pizza Avellino to compare their NYC slice with Hole in the Wall, and I have to say that Avellino was a few notches better.", "author": "Allen T."}

It's literally a hole in the wall. It is really small inside. It probably could only fit 10 people comfortably in their little dining/order area.

I highly recommend their chicken pesto pizza and their combo pizza. Their slices are a good size. Some people may consider them big slices. I can only eat 1 and I'll be stuffed. If you are a garlic fries lover, I don't recommend their garlic fries unless you like your garliac fries to completely smothered in garic. The staff is friendly and service is quick. Their pizza by the slice is already made and chillin. They warm it up for you and put it in the box then you can be on your way or if you can grab a seat, enjoy your slice inside.

The slice was HUGE compared to most pizza places and they pile on the toppings pretty high which was a plus. He loved it!\n\nI also ordered their Garlic Bread which came with about 10 pieces. It was loaded with garlic and cheese! Very yummy.

Starting with the best: the no hangover fries - considering we had been day drinking, I thought these fries would be a good idea, and they were.  They were cheesy, bacon-y, and spicy.  The fries themselves were soggy, but it was definitely my favorite item in our order.\nMediocre - The hand made boneless wings.  I personally did not like these at all, but other people in my group enjoyed them.  They did arrive completely soggy, which was a turn off. Only got these because they were part of the 3-topping pizza deal.  Would not personally order again.\nBad - Cheesy garlic bread.  Everyone in our group agreed it was horrible and inedible.  Had an oddly sweet-chemically taste.  Not sure how or why it tasted so bad but I've honestly never tasted anything like it.  Took one bite and tossed it.", "author": "Sam L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-02", "description": "4.8 stars. Couldn't have asked for a better meal--especially late night in SF. Using EAT24 (great app), I ordered a large pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni, the french fries tossed in garlic, and the boneless buffalo wings with ranch. UM OH MY GOD. Everything was so good. Plus tip, it was $42--A STEAL in any city, but especially in SF!!! I can see how the pizza crust is not really for everyone. It's what I would describe as a \"thinner Chicago style crust,\" if you can imagine. I personally loved it. My boyfriend prefers NY style pizza, but he still greatly enjoyed this pizza, so I think it should be good for thin-crust lovers as well who aren't overly picky. The buffalo wings had an amazing breading with a texture and taste I've never experienced before. And the garlic fries were thin cut (my fav) and toasted with a metric TON of roasted minced garlic. The servings were so huge too. One order of buffalo wings could easily serve as a generous appetizer for 4-5 people. Same with the garlic fries. Absolutely divine. I will be going literally no where else for late night SF pizza ever again.\n\n0.2 stars was docked because of the delivery time. I was quoted 30-40 minutes by EAT24, but it ended up taking about an hour. I received a text message from EAT24 saying the restaurant was particularly busy and quoted me for it's arrival to be around 12:15am. (I had ordered around 11pm.) So, it was nice that I got a head's up and knew to expect a delay. Bonus points to Hole in the Wall because it was delivered with a pleasant and enthusiastic smile right around midnight. According to other reviews, delivery is usually pretty fast, so I'm guessing this was just a bit of an off or understaffed night. Definitely worth the wait. It's places like this that give SF it's glowing culinary reputation.", "author": "Lauren C."}

I've only ordered delivery from here, always through Eat24, and while initially I thought this place was excellent, the food quality quickly took a nosedive. The burgers are reliably charred to the point where they resemble bricks made out of carbon more than beef, and the various cheesy fries (once a favorite of mine) have become sad, soggy, and stale. \n\nTo add insult to injury, every single time minus the first time, the food was delivered at least an hour late, and this is beyond the Eat24 delivery extension.  I am very hesitant about ordering from this place now, simply because their delivery and food quality varies so wildly.\n\n(2/5 simply because the pizza never disappointed, but it's not really worth the wait.)", "author": "Tony S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-06-12", "description": "Let me start by saying this: I literally live next to Amici's, Marina Pizza is across the street, Paxti's is one block away, Delarosa is one block away, Pizza Orgasmica is two blocks away, and Extreme Pizza is a close walk, and yet I still regularly choose SF Hole In The Wall over all of these other nearby competitors (and yes, I've tried all of them). Why?\n\n1. They have great customer service. I'll just give one recent example. I was there earlier today ordering pizza and fried Oreos. After getting the pizza box, I left, forgetting about the Oreos. After getting home, I realized I'd left them and called to ask if I could just get a refund or if I should go back and pick them up. I started out with, \"Hi, I was just in there 15 minutes ago and ordered takeout, and I think I left the fried Oreos....\" The owner immediately remembered me and said, \"Yes, they're here. Do you live close by, and do you want us to bring them to you?\" I was pleasantly surprised (since it was 7:45 p.m. on a Saturday night, a busy time for them) and said, \"Umm, sure...? [Gave him my address.] But no rush, seriously--thanks!\" Literally six (6) minutes later, they were at my apartment with the Oreos. So nice!!!\n\n2. Their delivery is fast (always ahead of schedule, never had a late delivery), and the orders are accurate. I usually order their food through Eat24, and they also have some good deals/coupons available on there. Delivery is also free, no added charges.\n\n3. The food is good, and I like the menu. You can get a custom-made pizza, or they also have some good specialty pizzas. You can also order by the slice (in-person as well as delivery, which not all pizza places do). In addition to pizza, they have a bunch of other great items--my favorites are the wings (love that they offer boneless wings!), chicken sandwiches, and fried Oreos. Oh, and let's not forget the homemade ranch sauce!\n\n4. Prices are totally reasonable and competitive. And, as mentioned above, they also offer coupons/deals. Delivery is free.\n\n5. They truly are a small hole in the wall, mom and pop shop. I think I've seen the owner in there working every time I've been there. It's a small restaurant, not much seating, but it's cozy and has character (including cool pics on the wall and a toy train). They're somewhat of a hidden gem in my opinion, and I was so happy when I first discovered them a few years ago. So next time when you get out of the bars in the Triangle and nearby Pizza Orgasmica has its usual line of 50 people waiting for their late-night drunken slice of pizza, consider walking a few blocks over to SF Hole In The Wall, and I think you'll be glad that you did!", "author": "Christina Y."}

My friend suggested this place to get a few slices because it was too late.  Well beggars cant be choosers.  So I decided to get two slices.  As I opened the box to eat my slices.  I find a small container of some sauce.  I was bewildered and discovered it was ranch sauce.  I heard it was Cali deal.  Not sure if it was true or not.  I dipped my pizza into the sauce.  Meh not bad.  The pizza wasn't too bad wasn't too great either.  It filled its purpose.  I think the ranch made it taste better.  But I won't go that route again.", "author": "A K."}

In not wanting to walk back home just to walk right back....my boyfriend ran an errand nearby. After 20 min, he went back only to then sit at the restaurant another 40 min!! So now we are looking at a 90min pizza!!!! Are you kidding me? I mean, I've waited 90 min for a delivered one before, but when quoted 35 min and then have to wait an additional hour?!?! Ridiculous!

Not quite enough sauce, so you end up getting what is essentially a cheese pie with a little sauce.\n\nCalifornians may not mind this, but I also think the crust is just on the border of too thick for \"New York Style\" pizza. Granted--it's still thinner than many crusts you'll see, and much thicker than Amici's which is a good thing. But it's almost a bit too much.\n\nI asked for half pesto on my pie and they nailed it--good mix, good pop to the pesto, nicely done.\n\nThe price is also pretty good. Maybe a buck or two more than the no-name pizza places, but much cheaper than Amici's or some of the (good) designer ones like Pizza Orgasmica.\n\nI'll be sure to update when I give these guys another shot next month.", "author": "Paul C."}

We flew in pretty late & decided to walk around the corner of our motel to look for a food joint still open. Came across this place & decided to try it out. Ordered a medium pizza with half chicken pesto & half artichoke bacon. Added on a spinach calzone for the hell of it (menu says its their mothers recipe.. cant go wrong). In all honesty, the service was good & owner/employee was a really cool guy. Only thing was.. the wait. It was a bit longer than I anticipated, so if you're in a rush.. don't bother coming here. The owner came out to apologize about the wait a couple times, but we didn't mind too much. But if you're willing to wait for quality food that was well worth it, please do. I definitely would suggest this place to anyone & will be bragging about it to my friends back home. My first bite into my pizza, I was pretty mindblown. The ingredients tasted fresh & the dough was perfect. I usually don't eat the crust, but damn it was good. And the calzone.. holy f'n hell.. seriously I've never had a calzone like that. It was stuffed! Just filled with fresh spinach, garlic, cheese & red onions, OMG. So simple, but so damn delish! My mom and I were more than impressed & pleased with what we've ordered. You can tell they definitely take pride in their work & I'm very glad we just so happened to stumble upon this gem. We don't have the luxury of experiencing quality/authentic new york style pizza like this, so it was literally the best we've had by far! & to top it off, we just ate our leftovers for lunch today (after 4 days of sitting in the fridge) & everything was still awesome.

There's something about the dough. This is the closest to NY style pizza in San Francisco that's fast & convenient. And I like that it's kind of hidden, it never gets too crowded for such a small space.", "author": "Jules F."}

It was delivered relatively quickly and the driver was friendly. The online ordering worked well; there was an option to get a txt message/email when the pizza was out for delivery.\n\nI didn't like the pizza though. The crust was bland, it was too greasy, and the pepperoni didn't have a great flavor. I planned to have extra for leftovers but I'm actually throwing away most of the pizza.\n\nI don't plan to try again, but at least they were open late.", "author": "E S."}

The Crust is tasty ( a must ) and fast delivery.  Inside, it's eclectic decor... trains, movie stars, etc., and something on the big screen to while away the moments of fresh, hot bites of goodness.", "author": "UnitedStudios S."}

My staple slice is pepperoni with mushrooms, I inconveniently came her to grab a slice because my daughter's swim class is nearby. So I thought I grab a quick bite before so. My slice of pepperoni and mushroom was not even on the agenda when I ordered it, they had to make it. Not only it took like 7 or so minutes, when I received my slice of pizza the mushrooms were not even real mushrooms, it's that dry paper like mushrooms. Which felt like I was eating nothing, but weird nothing (if that makes any sense). I manage to shove down 3/4 of the slice because I haven't eaten all day and I starving. No bueno *smh", "author": "Eva H."}

Just your typical late night pizza joint where they grab a slice and reheat it in the oven for you. What I like about this place is that the whole crust is crispy. Edge and bottom! So when you pick up the slice your toppings don't just slide right off. I will definitely go back and eat it again. Hopefully this time sober so I can remember if is really good...or not.", "author": "David W."}

I decided to call and give it to them verbally but they told me they didn't deliver to my address and gave me phone number that belonged to their \"other\" location closer to my home. \n\nSo why the f*ck did it accept my address on their website but not on the phone?\n\nThe telephone number they gave me belonged to \"Irving pizza\" which is not even related to them.

The crust was a bit too thick for me but I can't knock off any stars for that since I didn't ask if they had thin crust or not. Overall pretty decent slice of pepperoni.
