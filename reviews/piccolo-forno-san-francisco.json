Glad we got seated right away because we were so hungry after an long day of work! We ordered the burrata, Ideale pizza, and spaghetti with meatballs. Burrata was amazing.. as it should be since it is such a simple antipasto. The Ideale pizza was made with good quality ingredients and it wasn't greasy. (I ate the leftovers the next day for lunch and it was almost even better!) The spaghetti with meatballs was me and my friend's favorite. It had thick tomato sauce and super flavorful meatballs. The pasta was cooked perfectly! It's like they used a timer and a thermometer to make sure it was cooked right. We ordered simple dishes and everything was made to perfection. \n\nI think the perks of having a small restaurant is that the owner has the opportunity to be present at the restaurant and interact with his customers. I did not catch the owners name but as I've mentioned before.. he was so nice and friendly! Other yelpers have already mentioned this and I must agree. He gave us complimentary beverage and dessert, which I really appreciate. Maybe he sensed that we had a tough day at work, and we needed something to mend our mid-week crisis LOL. My 5-star rating isn't because he gave us complimentary items, but it is because of the food, staff, and atmosphere. \n\nThanks Piccolo Forno owner!

I submit to you this small, independent dining establishment.   If you want some pizza to go, there're several ready-made by-the-slice pizzas to choose from.   If you want to bring a bottle of vino and ask them to serve it with your food, they will gladly oblige.  \n\nSome of our group wanted individual marguerita pizzas, a shared platter of grilled vegetable sides (delicious and recommended), and some wanted lasagna or crab ravioli.    We were all pretty hungry.  Soon after poring over the menu and placing our order, a couple of dishes of bread were brought out and olive oil to dip it in.  Water glasses and carafes of water were brought out, too.   \n\nThe kitchen was fairly open, so if you wanted to watch the chefs prepare your food, you could.  Or, you can enjoy some conversation  in a convivial atmosphere that is Piccolo Forno.\n\nThe   food was all very, very good. The crab raviolis were served with a pink,creamy sauce.   Cutting each in half to make bite-sized, you could see the stuffing of fresh crab meat plumping each little pillow.\n\nThe lasagna...my gosh, the lasagna... delicious and resounding with umame.   \n\nFrom watching my friends polish off their pizzas,it was obvious that they were enjoying their food, as well.\n\nDessert: we got one lemon sorbet served in a whole lemon skin for a friend's daughter.   Watching her enjoy the treat was fun.  then the plates of tiramisu the rest of us were sharing arrived, and we got caught up in the enjoyment of our own plates.\n\n\nI will look forward to returning to this place in the future.

Water and really good bread was delivered almost immediately with the food out 5 minutes later.  Overall decent puttanesca. And well cooked pasta.

Prompt, efficient, etc.  He was being genuinely kind to everyone I saw come in while I was there.  Nice menu.  Great prices.  Great value.\n\nThe Bad: nothing at all! \n\nThe Mediocre: the puttanesca sauce itself was just ok.  Now before I get flamed, I didn't say it was bad.  It was fine for a basic tomato sauce with some capers and olives added. And a couple pieces of fresh basil. And it was delivered quickly.  It just wasn't the long stewed amazing, aromatic work of art that oozes garlic and oomami.  I was a little disappointed, that's all.

In the open kitchen, you could see that this small kitchen churned out mighty good food.  We ordered the crab ravioli and the spaghetti and meatballs.  Both came in substantial portions (we were too full for dessert afterwards) but the food was a SOLID 5/5.  \n\nCrab ravioli came with a creamy sauce, and spaghetti arrived to the table piping hot and noodles perfectly al dente.  Absolutely delicious!  Our Caesar salad had crunchy lettuce leaves perfectly coated with dressing and topped with anchovies and capers.\n\nWe were surprised by how affordable our meal was.\nThe bill for 2 full plates of pasta and a large salad was under $40.  Amazing in today's SF living standards.  Just wish they offered more creative drinks than run of the mill soda, so we stuck to water.  I don't recall seeing the wine list.\n\nOur service was friendly and everyone was speaking in Italian.  It didn't feel like the usual tourist trap in North Beach.  More like a neighborhood casual bite.  Which honestly was a little confusing.  The service felt attentive enough that it should have been more upscale, but everything else reflected a casual atmosphere.  This place is best suited for families or a group of friends.

We chatted briefly about where he was from, his history in the restaurant business after leaving Italy, first in Toronto and then San Francisco. Apparently he also owns another full service Italian restaurant in the city. \n\nWe ordered a pizza with buffalo mozzarella, arugula and shaved Parmesan. The pizza was thin and crispy with what we could tell were simple quality ingredients. As in Italy it wasn't over seasoned and seemed like a Neapolitan pizza but a little different cooked in an electric oven. The crust was crispy and not chewy as if wood burning. \n\nWe then ordered a side of meatballs which were delicious. The tomato sauce was a little salty but rustic and addictive. \n\nFor our mains, we had 3 pastas, cheese tortellini with a creamy Alfredo sauce, penne with eggplant and buffalo mozzarella with tomato sauce and fresh basil and finally linguine Vongole with a very healthy serving of clams. All were very tasty, plentiful and made simply and light without much fuss as Italian food should be. \n\nThere is no question that this is authentic real Italian food, not NY style Italian American. \n\nThe only heads up is that they do not have a liquor license. You are able to bring your own wine with no corkage fee and there is a wine store right next door although not open on Sundays.....yes, we visited on Sunday! \n\nGreat value for quality, no frills, just excellent food.

He recommended the veal tortellini which I agreed to and I also ordered a Caprese he salad which is a favorite for me. The Caprese was just so-so. Tomatoes were sliced too thin and the mozzarella was too thin as well. The tortellini was undercooked and still hard, and the sauce didn't have the big bold Italian flavor I was going for. \n\nThis would be a better choice for someone who just wants a slice of pizza. The premium dishes were a disappointment. \n\nThe service was good and the place was nice, but that's about it for highlights.  \n\nThe owner just messaged me and said I don't know what I'm talking about. That is terrible. \n\nI am now lowering my previous review of 3 stars to 1 star.  There was no malice in my review. It was honest.

The terrific Italian Homemade Company is just across the street, so maybe this stretch of Columbus is looking to offset the overcrowded tourist traps that lie just down the street. Funny thing was that Jamie W. and I came here on an early Friday evening around 6:30PM and found the place nearly desolate. Odd timing, I surmised, since the place is quite welcoming in an unobtrusive, contemporary way, and diners indeed started to trickle in after us. Owner Giuseppe Terminiello greeted us and generously gave us a table for four as he probably saw us as guys with big appetites. He was right, but we managed to exert some self-control.\n\nI wasn't aware that Giuseppe is also the owner of Ristorante Ideale, one of the few eateries on that stretch of Grant Avenue that serves good Italian dishes worthy of a return visit (review: http://bit.ly/2d5kwK4). The menu here is more casual with an equal emphasis on pizza which is on full appetizing display on the counter (photo: http://bit.ly/2ehdV4h). Still, we were both in a pasta mood, but first, we wanted to try the $12.50 Burrata with Prosciutto and Arugula (photo: http://bit.ly/2dXS8uv). That was startlingly good with the burrata the perfect creamy texture topped with just enough olive oil to make the arugula and prosciutto the most compatible of accompaniments. In fact, the complimentary bread made the ideal vessel for all the goodness (photo: http://bit.ly/2dp8nAF).\n\nJamie's love of meatballs came to the fore with the $13 Spaghetti con Polpette di Manzo, which was a fresh treatment on an old-school classic with the trio of large beef meatballs providing carnivorous satisfaction full of seasoning (photo: http://bit.ly/2e5PpnI). I decided to go for one of their daily specials, the $15 Spaghetti Carbonara, which nicely blended eggs, pecorino and Parmesan cheeses, and cubes of pancetta (photo: http://bit.ly/2ddrlN5). It brought hearty satisfaction in a manageable portion. Believe it or not, we stopped short of ordering dessert even though the menu included the usual suspects: tiramisu, profiteroles, gelato and sorbetto. No, we were strong...at least until we looked at the cannolis at Stella Pastry five minutes after we left.  \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...traditional Italian but given a fresh quality treatment\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...more spacious and a cleaner look than most trattorias in the area\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...Giuseppe and his crew care about his customers\nTOTAL - 4 stars...this could become a regular habit for us paisans", "author": "Ed U."}

Turns out 0.02 miles away translates to \"you are standing in front of the restaurant\".\n\nWhile vacillating over the menu, a very friendly server called us in, walked us through his favorite options, and persuaded us to take a seat.  The service remained exceptional for the remainder of the meal.  In casual conversation, the servers speak with a heavy Italian accent, which was simultaneously charming and tricky to decipher.\n\nThe layout of Piccolo is very open; there's the tables in the front, a display case of all the options, and to go to the bathroom you walk through the kitchen (which you can also see clearly from the table).  There is nothing to hide, of course; just people rolling dough and making pizza.\n\nWe ordered the ideal, $16 with arugula, tomato and a hard cheese.  It arrived in roughly 25 minutes.  Thin crust, so didn't take up much space in my stomach.  After wolfing down my half, still felt vaguely hungry but that went away after a bit.  Ah, the miracles of digestion.

And today's general trend towards avoiding carbs. \n\nI've been here twice and I've got to say, Piccolo Forno makes me appreciate pizza again. Both times we got the Capricciosa and a caesar salad. It was so good the first time we had to have the same exact meal again the second time. The pizza dough was a perfect thickness, neither too thick or too thin and just the right amount of chewiness. The toppings of artichoke, olives, prosciutto, mushroom and a runny egg was such a lovely and unique combination of savory goodness. And extra kudos for serving chili in chili oil as an accompaniment.\n\nBut what pushes this place over the edge is the amazing hospitality and especially of the main guy who seems as though he is the owner. He shared with us his last glass of wine (I hope that doesn't get him in trouble!) after we found out this was a BYOW/B kind of place.\n\nThe second time we went, we were sure to bring our bottle. Next time we will try the pasta.\n\nEach time, there is sounds of Italian being spoken among the people who work there and even among other patrons and that gives the ambience in here an extra special feel.", "author": "S.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-22", "description": "Piccolo Forno gets me excited about the future of North Beach eateries. Located a couple of blocks down Columbus from the cluster of carbon copy tourist tarps, Piccolo Forno (along with The Italian Homemade Company) offers a simple and relaxed - yet contemporary approach to Italian dining. \n\nOpen and clean interior gives off a relaxed vibe. No stuffy and fussy service but rather a straightforward and personable approach to hospitality. The same applies to the menu. Pizza slices, calzones, and pasta dishes along with a variety of antipasti and salads. The namesake Piccolo Forno pizza is almost a take on a niscoise salad in a pie. You won't even miss the fact that there isn't cheese on it with the nice combination of flavor between the tuna, artichoke, olives, tomatoes, and egg - it's very tasty. I can't wait to come back to try more of the menu. \n\nPiccolo Forno is a casual Italian eatery with quality food at affordable prices - a departure from places up the street but definitely a win for the neighborhood.", "author": "Jon L."}

The check was extremely reasonable for the quality and my family of four was stuffed and happy.\n\nWe've visited Italy and the pasta and pizza are hard to replicate, but this place nails it.

He said that it was taken on the first day we met. My first instinct was that dated me, I did not like to look at me when I was in my prime. But wait, on second thought, I should, and it seemed that I looked exactly the same, hiding behind sunglasses and hat (I'm that vain, yes.)  Perhaps because staring at my old self smiling back me made me hungry, we went to fetch food.\n\nOwner is italian. He told us that this is a 2 and half weeks old restaurant. It felt very European. I did not catch the owner's name, who greeted us warmly.  We did the dine in version vs. take out.  My companion used to run a Yelp like site before there was Yelp. I think it's because he's extremely observant, often have smart things to say about anything that interests him, and he's a people person. I'm not a people person. I'd like to eat in peace and not talk. He observed that the owner was in a talkative mode. \"He could tell that we were locals so he chatted with us.\"\n\nI liked the ambience of the new place. It felt neighborly, local, even though it's just a block away from the tourist trap. The restaurant appeared to be easy on the eyes. Whatever they did, it works. \n\nI could see that the owner was making a caesar salad in the kitchen. He tossed it by hand. Just enough times so that the lettuce could stay crisp, yet the dressing was mixed in. Interesting technique. \n\nThe counter displayed a wide array of premade pizza and things. A man who appears to be a local worker stopped by to order a piece of pizza. The owner told him that it's free, it's getting to be end of the day, clearly they know each other, and he was being very generous. So incredibly kind. You don't see that often enough. \n\nThe salad arrived with the pasta. It's all freshly made. The meatball was crunchy outside and soft inside. The pasta was al dente. If you google spaghetti meatballs, the google image would show that dish. Their pasta is stock image ready. The caesar salad had just enough anchovies, which is my favorite thing in a caesar. I think it is most likely the best I've ever had. Most of the caesar salads we eat in America is ladled with dressing. This one was light and intense at the same time.\n\nWhen the bill came he went, \"Wow.\" I asked why, he said that it was very inexpensive. I did not offer to pay. He won't take my money anyway. But I'm glad I was not the usual expensive date for once. \n\nThat evening was full of surprises. I received my belated birthday presents from him, I had not anticipated anything really; I saw what I looked like nearly 20 years ago and I had not really changed that much at all, except I think I'm more in shape now even though I was not out of shape before; I had met the owner of this neighborly restaurant who is kind, ernest, and talented in the kitchen, which proves to me good people are still around; and I finally found a caesar salad I liked...\n\nWelcome to the neighborhood.

The owner mentioned that they're expecting a new pizza oven from Italy soon, so perhaps the pizzas will change a bit when it arrives.\n\nThe supplis were very interesting, and I had not tried them before. They appear to be fried risotto, mixed with bolognese sauce and parmesan cheese, then breaded and fried. They were very tasty.

So it was going to be one or the other.\n\nI went to Italian Homemade Company and seen as I stated in their rating all they had were stools inside, meaning not kid friendly.

We were given some fresh baked bread with some olive oil, would had like some balsamic vinegar too but didn't have. \n\nWhen the plates came I thought it was off the kids menu, until I thought about it. They didn't have a kid menu, and if they did how small would be the portions if the adult portion was already kid size. So the staff already noticed we were happy with the portions and asked if liked more bread. Of course we did, but the bread the second time around was stale.

Wanted a place casual enough that a solo diner would not feel out of place but with good food. Found this place on Yelp. It was exactly what I was looking for. The place is small with about half bistro tables and half bar-height tables. Atmosphere is casual bistro - you might almost mistake it for one of those fast-casual chains where you order at the counter, but it's not and the service was excellent. The staff all speak to each other in Italian so you almost feel like you've stepped into Italy. Even the young couple sitting next to me were Italian so I figured it must be good! The waiter brought out a partial loaf of delicious bread, crusty outside and flaky inside, with a large bowl of olive oil for dipping, and a bottle of (tap) water. My Greek salad was delicious and my penne all'arrabiata was perfectly al dente and pleasantly spicy. Tira misu was just right. And the prices were very reasonable - especially for SF. Only giving 4 stars because I didn't think the pizzas looked very good which is half the menu, and because the waiter neither offered me fresh pepper for my salad nor Parmesan for my pasta.

Italian Homemade makes their own noodles in shop which is a huge difference to me. I think Piccolo Forno uses regular store bought dry noodles.

We stumbled upon this place while exploring Little Italy and I can't wait to go back. They were able to seat 7 of us right away, although it is a smaller space the food makes it worth it. People in our party wanted lasagna and they had just ran out, so the owner said we could wait 30 minutes and he would bring out fresh made lasagna. This lasagna was absolutely amazing! I personally order the cheese tortellini and I loved it. However, I did try their specials for the day and wished I would have order them for myself. They had a butternut squash ravioli that was to die for. Great flavor and texture! The dish that made my fall in love with this place was their asparagus ravioli with white truffle. I've never tried truffle before and was excited to try it. This ravioli was beautiful, the best I've had. It's hard to describe the flavor but I can't wait to go back and order this!

My husband and I went here after a long day traveling in and we were driving looking for parking and figure we find a place after we parked. Luckily we didn't have to walk far in the pouring rain. This place was friendly, delicious and clean my top three musts. I tend to only do reviews on here when. Place really has the wow factor or have given the three strikes and this place has the wow factor. \nIt was very clean and has a modern feel as look. The server was very knowledgable and beyond friendly. After the most delicious appetizer of zucchini slice of pizza and the penne with eggplant and fresh basil which was mouth watering I can still taste it mmmm. I was just right not over full but not enough room for my own desert. I did want the pistachio gelato but my husband ordered a delicious berry layered pastry. And the server heard me say I wanted gelato but knew I couldn't finish so he added a scoop. It was the perfect ending to an amazing dining experience. \nFOOD: they have an open pizza slice selection we chose to try two different ones for our apps yes we were hungry lol. I had the zucchini and was mouth watering the cheese was perfect so flavorful and the sliced zucchini was a great touch as opposed to the diced like most other places. Crispy thin crust. Then our meals. I had the penne eggplant marinara it was perfect amount for the dish not over the top amounts. It was a flavorful mix of tomato, fresh slices basil with chunks of eggplant that melted in your mouth with so much flavor. There was a perfect amount of mozzarella cheese to not overpower the dish with cheese flavor.

My boyfriend and I tried their margherita pizza, which I loved. The crust was just right, thin but with a doughy crust. The slightly sweet tomato sauce was a great contrast to the light mozzarella and generous basil. We also tried the spaghetti carbonara, which tasted authentic yet relatively light.

From classic Italian meatloaf complete with hard-boiled egg in the center, to pasta, to a savory pie with veal, to Roman thin-crust pizza - everything is simple, hearty, and makes you feel like someone's mom or grandmother is back in the kitchen throwing the food together with ingredients fresh from her garden. You'll know that's not the case when you're here, however, as you'll see Giuseppe and the crew back in the open kitchen pouring love into everything that's prepared...\n\nThey make different items daily visible 'under the glass' when you go in, but be sure to look at the menu too otherwise you'll miss the pastas. Their uniqueness comes from the variety and nature of the fresh daily items, all of which can be taken out for lunch at the office or an easy dinner at home too.

Some even laughed in our faces for asking, so we had that going for us. \n\nNot Piccolo Forno. We walked in to a friendly greeting, an open table, and a pizza display to refresh a tired soul. It seemed like hardly any time passed between ordering food and food appearing. My spaghetti was perfectly al dente and the sprinkle of fresh basil on the meatballs made my whole day worthwhile. One of my friends got the piccolo forno pizza. He is now seriously considering moving to San Francisco. \n\nA week later, when my family was visiting, we went back. We received the same warm greeting, and the owner quickly rearranged tables so we could all sit together and without getting a cold blast of air from the door opening. My dad and I split a salad and fought over the last tomato. I don't even like raw tomatoes. My sister-in-law and I got spaghetti carbonara.

They are expecting a very big forno shortly so I wondered if the name was in reference to the tiny warming oven behind the counter, perhaps a sentimental possession that got the whole thing going, or just a nod to the restaurant's cute size.\n\nThese guys, Simone & Giuseppe, were friends from IDEALE, another great restaurant, and just opened up this new venture. I overheard Giuseppe say that they kitted out the interior themselves which is modern and hip. The low volume, old school Italian pop playing in the background made the scene.\n\nAs for the food, they haven't even gotten their pizza oven and these guys are already rocking great pies. It is quite clear they really know what they are doing and are very good at it. Giuseppe talked with passion about getting the temperature just right for pizza crust. Now this is a guy I can respect. My wife's pasta was also delicious as was the Torta Caprese that we finished the evening with.\n\nI am not the kind of guy that fawns over great service, but the service was distinctly friendly with a nice local feel which I hope they can maintain when they get as wildly popular as I think they will be.\n\nOddly with the The Italian Homemade Company across the street, North Beach is moving closer to our house! Piccolo Forno replaces a sad place called Tasty Bites that was not too tasty but did bite. Their doom was clearly near when virtually the entire front window was plastered with offers of an overblown and far too diverse menu. Piccolo Forno is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.

You want Italian? Well, the owner's friendliness, accent, and concern for your overall enjoyment of the meal makes you feel like you're at a sit-down meal with the family. Just ask him to recommend things off the menu and subsequently listen to him rattle off 12 things and then say everything's tasty!\n\nOverall, the food quality was pretty good, portions were a bit small and plating was messy...kinda like how you would serve yourself at home. Rather than critique using my subjective preferences (i.e. Carbonara was runnier than expected, pizza was doughy/a little dry, etc.), I will say that I had an extremely pleasant experience.", "author": "Nick W."}

I made a reservation ahead of time. There were only two waiters (who also helped cook) and they were clearly overwhelmed. I asked my waiter twice to bring balsamic vinegar for the bread and he forgot both times. He also took our empty water pitchers in the middle of our meal, and instead of refilling them, never brought them back.\n\nWe ordered 2 of one type of pasta, and instead of giving us two portions they essentially cooked one serving, and split it in half. The waiter insisted that the large plate made the serving look small, but looking around at other people's plates you could tell that it was half of a portion masquerading as a full one. Kind of a dishonest place. \n\nI will not come back.", "author": "Mauri W."}

Our party of 4 walked in directly behind another party of 4.  We were all seated at the same time at adjacent tables.  The other table ordered AND RECEIVED their meals before we were even able to order ours. Then our food took so long that the other party finished all of their meals before ours even arrived!  Our orders were not fancy: 2 pizzas (one of which was already made and sitting in the case) and 2 orders of pasta.  I have no idea what could have taken the kitchen so long.  It was about 45 minutes from the time we arrived until our food arrived.  \n\nWhen the food finally did arrive, we discovered the piece of trash in my Greek salad and the food wasn't good.  My pasta carbonara was lumpy with cooked egg (though bacon in it was good).  The meatballs in my son's spaghetti and meatballs were dense and flavorless (though pasta did taste homemade).  My companion's pizza had undercooked dough, watery sauce, and little flavor.  His iced tea had sludgy stuff on the bottom -- I guess the equivalent of coffee dregs so was very unappetizing to look at or taste.  My younger son gobbled up his pre-made square of pizza, but by that point he was starving and probably would have eaten anything put in front of him without complaining.  \n\nAtmosphere was also pretty lousy: very loud 70s rock music (such as Queen and Aerosmith).\n\nThe restaurant did not charge me for the trashy salad.  However, the bill still came to almost $80.00 including tip, so all in all, it was an expensive, slow, terrible meal.  We will never go back.", "author": "Katy O."}

As an Italian born and raised, I know for fact how the authentic Italian dishes should taste like. I was also very satisfied with the service and had overall a tremendous experience. If you love Italians and if you like to talk and try some authentic Italian food, then this is the place for you. Buon Appetito!", "author": "Giulia B."}

The staff was super friendly and warm. Plenty of Italian spoken her by both staff and patrons. Absolute must in North Beach.", "author": "Leanne R."}

We were welcomed so nicely by the owner and employees so we felt like we had to try their food. My gf had the eggplant pizza and I had the focaccia turkey sandwich. As far as my sandwich it was perfectly toasted with freshly sliced turkey. The turkey had great flavor and wasn't bland by any means and they had put some sort of house sauce that complimented the sandwich very well. Also came with an arugula salad dressed with oil and olives, which was a little bland for me but my gf liked it. The eggplant pizza was a very traditional Italian pizza, but to my gf's liking was slightly lackluster. It looked very fresh, however might need some tweaking since they just opened. We also had ordered a cannoli, but the owner wanted to treat us to a special dessert which turned out to be a dessert ravioli. This special dessert definitely won us over and was special. \n\nOur 4 star review is based on a combination of amazing service and hospitality with just minor changes needed to their eggplant pizza. We definitely stop by again when in the area. They made us feel like we were in Italy .", "author": "Pedro G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-14", "description": "Try it instead of other north beach Italian restaurants - Flying under the radar never tasted so good.\n\nI moved to the area recently and have been trying to find a reliable and affordable Italian place that I can frequent for comfort food without the fuss of dealing with tourism traffic. This place looks modern from the outside, but the place is very much run by real italians and they've not been jaded in terms of food quality from having to serve throngs of tourists (yet). \n\nThe pizza is quite good (I've only tried the pepperoni once), but the truly outstanding dishes are the pastas that the cooks make on the spot. They're always properly al dente (just sightly undercooked like real Italians love) and the ingredients (such as the guanciale in their amatriciana) are some of the best I've tried along Columbus. I've tried 3 pastas here in 2 weeks since they've opened and they definitely make all the staples with more care and attention than other places. They also delightful appetizers that look great, but knowing me I'll probably just grab a slice with my pasta and pig out.\n\nI cannot directly compare dishes to dishes along all the Italian restaurants I've eaten at in the community but I know quality when I smell/taste it and I'm definitely going to come back for much more in the future; especially if their pastas cost under 14, whereas some of the more established places try to rip you off for more than $25, which I find ridiculous.\n\nMaybe they're just great for now cause they're new and they're trying hard to make an impression. I probably shouldn't write this review anyway cause I'd hate it if more traffic lowers their food standards..", "author": "Kevin K."}
