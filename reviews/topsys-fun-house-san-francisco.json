The bartenders are the best quality but let's be honest, they dress slutty and flirt with all the older guys, so I see a lot of after work \"regulars\" chatting it up with the ladies. \n\nConsequently the service gets slow when they start chatting it up, and this place gets PACKED after hours, so you can barely hear anything and wait 20 minutes to get someone's attention.\n\nSorry, but when I get outa work I like peace and quiet when I drink my ass to zen-like states.", "author": "John W."}

Note that they also offer happy hour all day Monday and Tuesday to Friday from 2 - 7 pm. There is a food menu filled with various small bites, but the happy hour deals are primarily for drinks. If you check in on Yelp, they offer half off either the bruschetta or deviled eggs, which we definitely took advantage of :)\n\nIn the spirit of taco Tuesday, I ordered their strawberry margarita ($8) along with both the chicken and carnitas tacos. The strawberry margarita was served in a mason jar (very chic) and was very light and refreshing. I liked it so much I ordered a second one. Tacos were decent but not great, but I wouldn't expect a place like this to have amazing food.\n\nThere is bar, couch, and table seating inside, but it was a nice day outside, so we decided to sit at one of the two outdoor tables where it was more quiet and conducive to conversation.

Topsy's was pretty cool inside. The bar stools are so unique- each one different than the other. There's also a large, taxidermy bear by the bathrooms.\n\nWe were the only group of females in there at the time and didn't have many exchanges with the bartender. When we did, they were friendly, short, normal conversations in passing. At one point, we were cracking jokes about age because two of us are Asian and look like we're about 12. It was all good.\n\nWe were having a great time and enjoying catching up with one another until this female waitress, who's very apparently in a relationship with one of the bartenders, got weird with my group. She felt the need to 'stake her claim' to this guy and make it a point to force him to coddle her behind the bar while we were waiting to order drinks. Cool.\n\nThis waitress snatched my more than half full drink off of the table, asked if I was done, didn't wait for a response and dumped it out behind the bar while staring me down. Even cooler. We left shortly after, because who would want to spend money for service from a miserable person?", "author": "Amy E."}

Appropriate.\n\nIt was a slower night so we got a chance to talk drinks, linguistics, and pretty much anything else.

I am not a horror fan. I saw The Ring three times and I still can't tell you what it's about because I closed my eyes all three times. Now, one may say that clowns aren't scary, but that person is wrong. I find them terrifying when you're in a darkened bar. Maybe at a kids party it's fine, but when you're slightly tipsy the last thing you want to see if a clown head. \n\nThe drinks here are phenomenal, so I don't want to knock this place just because of the clowns. It is definitely a differentiator. (I went to six bars while I was in San Francisco and this one I can still clearly envision). Yet, if you have a phobia of clowns, this isn't the bar for you.

Topsy's is a cocktail bar nestled on the corner of Kearny and Bush street in the Financial District of San Francisco. Although it's located on the corner, you can't miss it once you hear all of that good music bumpin' as you pass by!\n\nI came here with a group of Yelp friends after leaving Pagan Idol just around the corner. We were looking for somewhere else to continue the party and we stopped by Topsy's. I really feel like fun is an understatement when describing this place! I'm generally not a huge fan of bars in the city, but THIS is a bar that I would happily come back to. The vibe is just extremely attractive! There's a great mix of people who come here and the setup is really chill! There's lots of TV's and high tables for seating. The inside is very narrow, but the bar is long and glorious! It has such a sexy little vibe to it with the lighting and the decor. \n\nAnd those DRANKS though? Mm hmm... me likey! Me likey my A LOT! First off... the drinks here LOOK beautiful! You ever gotten a drink and didn't wanna drink it because it looked so puuurdy? Yep... it's like that. I couldn't wait to post my check-in photo the night that I was there (although I accidentally ended up checking into the wrong place! Womp womp). Bee-you-tee-fuuulll! And the best part is, it tasted even better than it looked! Ain't that somethin? Especially for SF, because I'm super biased! I ended up having the California Republic cocktail which consisted of bourbon, aperol, china-china, and lime juice. Not gonna lie... I really don't know what the hell aperol and china-china is, but what I will say is that the bourbon was DEFINITELY apparent! No skimps-r-us in that department boo boo!\n\nAnd dear Lord... the MUSIC! (Gasp). Let me just take a moment to thank whoever that DJ was! I have a very eclectic taste in music and I appreciate many different genres. However, I also just thoroughly enjoy old school hip hop and slightly ratchet tunes. Yes, that's me... you can judge me all you want, but you know that you secretly bob your head to those ratchet songs in your car too! But, let me just say that when they busted out that old school Regulators track and when they started playing Bone Thugs and Harmony and Ice Cube... it electrified my soul. I felt like I was a kid again and I probably would have been shaking my you know what on top of the table if I had a few more drinks in me. A good thing that didn't happen because I would hate to get kicked out of a nice place like this,  but I digress...\n\nAnyways, moral of the review is: bring your butt down here if you want to have a fun time! I should also mention that this place has an awesome happy hour that I have not yet gotten the chance to partake in. Happy hour is all day on Mondays here and from 2-7 Tuesday through Friday! That's five hours of alcoholic heaven for you! I plan on coming back here again real soon.", "author": "Shayla B."}

I don't mind it. \n\nLychee Martini - A little too sweet for me.

And that's what it sounds like when you're in \"San Francisco\" on your \"Birthday\" about to partake in \"Happy Hour\" on a \"Tuesday\" with a fellow Yelper....Yea, it was a an unconventional day to go out for me at least....or was it? We are talking about San Francisco where one of my bartenders said to me..\"This is San Francisco, everyday is the weekend here, always expect the unexpected\" here is my impression on Topsy's Fun House!\n\n4/19/16\nDay two into my vacation and it was my \"Birthday\" so I was really in the fun and social mood this \"Tuesday\" and to see what it had in store for me. Thanks to fellow Yelper \"Porsche C\" for wanting to show me something new, and treating me pretty awesome on my \"Birthday\" we both met up here at Topsy's and it was perfect timing considering it was \"Happy Hour\" and being that it was \"Tuesday\" tacos was on the menu to go with the whole \"Tuesday\" theme. Okay I know, I said \"Tuesday\" a lot so far but, I was really impressed with not only SF but this place this \"Tuesday\" afternoon.\n\nService - 4/5\nAmbience - 4/5\nFood and Drinks - 5/5\n\nI waited a bit and then Porsche arrived and it was time to \"Go up, on a Tuesday\" I had a beer earlier before her arrival, but later had a Topsy Mule from the Happy Hour Menu which was $8.00 that is normally $10.00 off of the Happy Hour. Let me say....it was pretty fantastic, I opted for the vodka mule and it was very well balanced, these bartenders are pretty skilled and not just pouring some heavy drinks that some bars in SF tend to do. I actually enjoyed this drink and can't wait to have another one one day soon. \n\nOn to the food, they have some options available, but on a \"Tuesday\" I went with the tacos $2.00 which is kinda....a no brainer duhhhhhh! Chicken and Carnitas aka Pork were the protein choices here. We got two of each, and then we took one from each others plate. To be honest, they were very light in taste and they weren't greasy. They matched well with the alcoholic beverages we had during our visit. They weren't like your run of the mill taqueria style tacos, but the taste are still familiar enough to feel down home in a more midscale setting.\n\nThe theme is kinda like..I guess you can say a fun house or circus maybe. From the outside it looks kinda like a little posh lounge, and then you enter and be like....okay I see waz up. The barstools are very uncomfortable, they are sitting on some springs and they have no impact whatsoever, so they are very stiff. I totally recommend sitting on the wall booth seating. The service seemed kinda....dry that is till the crowd started to roll in and the staff seemed to get more pumped up. The restroom door wouldn't lock so I was nervious when I had to go that someone would walk in on me. But no one did so I'm good with that.\n\nWould I go back?\n\nI think I would, even if the day wasn't \"Tuesday\" seeing weekends are usually my options for freetime.\n\nIn Conclusion, Topsy's Fun House is in a great area, two bart stations are nearby \"Montgomery and Powell\" if you're a Bart rider like me. And it seems like the after work crowd enjoyes this place. I would definitely recommend this place for night outs or even a date considering the fun setting.

It was lighter than I preferred. Tasted a little watered down. The Old flame was fun as they lit it on fire by spraying absinth.

You can choose from chicken or carnitas. A good taco for $2 since it came with guacamole. I liked the salsa they provided as well. I had one of the bruschettas. I'm not a big sweet and savory person, so I found the balsamic reduction to be a little too sweet. The pizza was good. Crust was soft with a nice chew.\n\nWe sat at the bar which was perfect.

A moment to chill with some newfound friends.\n\nAnd chill we did.  I drank two Negronis.  Both were what I would consider high quality.  They had the right balance and the right flavors.  I was able to sip and not guzzle.  The bartender was friendly and had a great accent.  And one of the best features of this bar...it was less than a block from my hotel!  And the the BEST thing that happened that evening was that my new ACRONYM friend (and non-drinker) Jai sprung for the whole tab!!

I opted for the \"Monkey Business\", a mixture of rum (flor de cana 7 yr), sweet vermouth, and chocolate Bitters.

I warned the server ahead of time that we would need to split the bill and I discreetly let her know that I was the only one in the group on an expense account. At the end of the evening they did indeed split the bill for us, but they would not present me with a receipt that was not itemized and that showed only my amount. To make things much, much worse, the manager came over and made an attempt to explain why they are the only vendor in town who cannot offer a simple receipt that's not itemized and only shows the individual's amount and in doing so the rest of the group became aware that I am on an expense account. This is something I've kept from my coworkers for obvious reasons. If you're on an expense account and you expect to be treated the way you are at every other restaurant in town that has no problem presenting you with a simple non-itemized receipt and not making a big deal out of who has what, this is not your place. We will not be back. Every time I'm in town we choose a place to go have happy hour or a meal or both. This will never again be one of them. Unacceptable! There are too many great places in the city that think nothing of giving a receipt, something business travelers never think twice about. Go elsewhere.\n\nI'm editing this review because as you can see the manager responded to me and the review via Yelp. As explained to him in person there were four of us paying but they would only accept three credit cards. Since I was the only one with cash I paid with cash. The fact that they could not offer a receipt I could use was explained at the time, yes, but only AFTER they ran the cards and took my cash. And how about the fact that they came and blundered around and made it known to my coworkers that I am on an expense account. Manager: You know exactly what happened, since you were there and you were the one who did the blundering. It just didn't occur to you at the time that I would use Yelp to air how badly you handled the situation. I'm letting others know, beware. In this age of yelp, and most people checking before they try a new, or even an old place, you can't get away with this anymore.", "author": "Carol L."}

Went during happy hour so the scene was full of professional millennials looking to wind down. Atmosphere was kind of loud but still personal enough to hold a conversation. It gets pretty packed in there to where you have to compete to get a drink at the bar.\n\nI'm more of a beer drinker than I am a mixed drink drinker. But I tried two of the menu crafted beverages. Can't remember the names, but one was very reminiscent of a Moscow Mule and the other had cucumber garnish and flavor. Refreshing, but nothing outstanding though.\n\nI realize I'm from the deep south where a dollar stretches a lot further, but I went here during happy hour where they claimed to have a happy hour special. It was $8. A happy hour special to me is 2 for $8 or 2 for $10. Or 1 for 1 specials. Or maybe even a shot of Jaeger or something.

I sampled one of their gin-based signature drinks and pulled pork quesadillas.  Both were satisfying to my pallette.  I spent a Tuesday happy hour killing some time, and while nicely packed, it was not overly crowded.   Surprisingly, not as whimsical as the name suggests and is more posh and lounge-y than I expected.  The kicker: being a 90's hip-hop afficionado, I was absolutely thrilled when Method Man's \"Bring the Pain\" was followed by more East-Coast beats over the soundsystem.  I thought most bars/lounges killed the genre to cater to newer tastes, but at least at this spot,the music lives on.  Hope the vibe is the same on other days, can't wait to bring the crew.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-05-01", "description": "Entering the bar, it was such a stark contrast of mood lighting to the sunny day outside.  I want to say that the lit and bright pictures on yelp were a little deceiving to how dark the place actually was. Maybe the picture takers were there at an earlier hour.  Well anyway, it was 5:45pm on the dot, and I was ready for some happy hour fun. (All the cocktails are $8).\n\nI decided to get the George Dickel Old Fashioned.  It was a bit disappointing, unfortunately.  I had read a yelp review earlier in the day saying that their whiskey selection wasn't the best (with the exception of Yamazaki).  The drink was bland, sour and watered down.  That sounds terrible, but it was decently ok.  The second drink I had was the Red Top.  That one was several times better.  I liked the sweetness with the added wine float.  I barely tasted the flavor of the ginger whiskey though.  With my second drink I ordered the Veggie Sandwich so to not go the night on an empty stomach.  The arugula salad that accompanied the sandwich was literally just arugula and it was colossal, taking up 2/3s of the plate. It had a nice vinaigrette-y flavoring that was probably tossed with the leaves.  The sandwich was pretty good. The bread was lightly toasted with a creamy curry aioli sauce.  My only complaint is that the veggies were not just roasted, but cold and soggy.  It had a good flavor, but it could have bumped the sandwich to a whole other level if it was only just a bit warmer and firmer. \n\nThe last drink I had of the night was the double daddy IPA.  At that time I was sufficiently buzzed (Sorry, not sorry that I'm small and Asian).  It was pretty standard for a double IPA and I enjoyed it.  \n\nThe waitress we had was very attentive and friendly. I give a solid thumbs up on the service.\n\nHowever, a big complaint that I have is that it is so unbelievably loud. The entire night I had to raise my voice significantly just to I can hear myself talk.  To top that off, they added a live band at the front of the bar at around 8:30pm.  I love live bands, don't get me wrong, but at this point I was yelling and my friends still could barely hear me.  This bar is definitely not big enough to support the acoustics of live music at an enjoyable volume.  \n\nEven with my critiques, this place is really unique and cool! I love the circus/creepy circus props and decorations.  On the ceiling, there is a hanging display of old furniture, toys and things (Not to worry, there is also a metal slate/net to keep it from falling on anyone if you were worried. It looks pretty stable though). \n\nI may or may not refer this place to a friend, which is unfortunate because the decorations are so awesome.  The drinks and food were good, but the noise level can keep people from a good time.  I still had fun catching up with friends, but it was definitely an issue.\n\nAmbiance: 3/5\nFood & Drinks: 3.5/5\nService: 4.5/5\nOverall Experience: 3.75/5", "author": "Elizabeth L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-10", "description": "A common theme behind discovering what my favorite bars and drinks are is that I just happen to stumble upon them by accident. The No1DP and friend/fellow Yelper Aren A. stumbled across this bar as the bar we originally planned to go wouldn't open until later. We also had time to kill until dinner.\n\nVENUE: A circus-themed bar smack dab in the middle of Financial District. Their stools consist of giant springs or car crankshafts mounted on brake drums and are fun to sit on. Several drinks later they are still fun to sit on.\n\nSERVICE: We had the pleasure of being served by one of the best bartenders I've ever encountered. ALL of the drinks made by this bartender were excellent. Perhaps this was because we came right when the bar opened on Saturday afternoon and the bartender had the time to prepare our drinks. No1DP noticed that the bartender paid special attention to my drinks while quickly preparing drinks for the guys across the table.\n\nDRINKS\n- Strawberry Basil Martini, $10 (Russian Standard, Fresh Strawberry, Basil, Lemon). Russian Standard is one of my favorite vodkas because it is very smooth when consumed neat or in a mixed drink. The pureed strawberry was blended just right so that it blends nicely into the drink. \n- Dry Passion, $11 (209 Gin, Passion Fruit Nectar, Orgeat, Ginger Liqueur, Lime). I am not a fan of a gin and I especially hate the taste of bad gin; a sign of a *good* drink is if the other ingredients blend in with the gin well enough to complement or hide the taste of gin. I tasted more of the ginger and passion fruit than the gin. \n- Twisted Berry, $8 (Svedka Vodka, Fresh Lemon, Ginger, Passion Fruit, Fresh Blueberries). A variation of the Strawberry Basil Martini but a bit more tart due to the ginger and blueberries. Like the Strawberry Basil Martini the final consistency is a smooth fruity drink. This is one of their newer drinks.\n- George Whitney Margarita, $9 (Espolon Tequila, Agave Nectar, Fire Water bitters, Lime, Cucumber). Though this was Aren's drink I loved this drink as this was another example of a hot jalape\u00f1o margarita done right. This meant that a good tequila was used as the base as I've tasted horrible jalape\u00f1o margaritas using subpar tequilas.\n- Contortionist, $11 (Ketel One, Honey Syrup, Cardamon Bitters, Lime). No1DP's first drink. The cardamom was the highlight ingredient but only enhanced the drink. \n\nNo1DP had 2 other drinks that were more sipping drinks that consisted of strong but good-quality whiskey.\n\nSupposedly has all-day happy hours on Monday. I'd love to come back here and explore more of their drink menu. I would consider this one of my top 10 bars for craft cocktails.", "author": "Isabella B."}

We took awhile to decide what to get because my group of friends hadn't seen each other in awhile, so we chit chatted first.  Guess that was a big mistake since there was only one bartender working.  So we had to go up to the bar to place our order after awhile and still waited awhile for drinks.  She actually made a non-happy hour drink for me mistakenly (so it was $10 and not $8) but because it took so long to get drinks in the first place I kept it.  \n\nAfter she (blonde woman) brought us our drinks she asked for a credit card right away.  WTF..rude much?  Don't you want people to enjoy the ambiance, spend more and keep a tab open?  Finally as we were about to leave we saw a second bartender starting (before 7pm).  \n\nCute decor & spacious bar.

Probably one of my favorite places to start a Friday off at!! Topsy's has the quirky atmosphere and quality happy hour to make any day a Friday.  \n\nDrinks 10/10:  To really get your bang for your buck at your Topsy's experience make usre to get there for happy hour.  $8 cocktails and $5 craft beer is the way to go.  This doesn't sound all that special price wise but I love the cocktails here.  I've tried most all of the them and the hands down winner is the Cucumber Gimlet followed closely by the Lychee Martini. These aren't overly developed, crazy ingredient cocktails but dammit they are executed perfectly every time. They also have a good variety of beer both in bottles and on tap INCLUDING the ever illusive KCCO Black Lager that i like so very very much.  \n\nFood 9/10:  Now I have not had a chance to try a huge variety of the food, mostly going for the easy shared plates.  The bruschetta is awesome and so is the pizza.  The ONE thing that I still  must try is the Taco Tuesday experience.  $2 tacos and a roulette of margaritas is something that I can get behind after a slow Tuesday of work.\n\nGive Topsy's a try.  The atmosphere is awesome, the staff are fun to talk to, and the crowd is very low key.

Honestly I was expecting something quirky, carnival-esque, but when my friends and I went there on a Thursday evening, we were totally disappointed. First of all, the clownish decorations are minimal; in fact you can barely tell that there's a theme at all when you step inside. I feel like with a fun house theme, either go big or go home. \n\nIt was only 5:30 but they were blasting techno so loudly that we could barely hear each other over the bar table. The crowd is pretty financial bro-ish, which I guess is to be expected given the location, and it seemed like every table other than ours was taking shots and being obnoxious. The drinks on the menu are pretty average for a cocktail bar and their happy hour deals were far from enticing.

The circus colours and themes are all a bit muted, so that combined with the dim lighting it's quite a nice ambiance inside.  The tables were a mix of high top (closer to the window) and lower height tables, with booth seating on one side and ottoman-type seats on the other.\n\nThey had a nice range of beers on tap, with five or six different options.  At one point I ordered the Lagunitas IPA, which it turned out they were out of--the bartender was fantastic, though, and immediately brought me a couple tasters of the other IPAs on tap so that I could choose a different one.  I was sitting at the bar so I got to watch all the cocktails being made, and it made me wish I'd gone for those instead of beer; everything looked delicious and very carefully made. \n\nPrice-wise, this place was fairly standard.  Beers were between $6 and $8 depending on the brew, and cocktails seemed to be in the $9-$12 range.  I was there on a Saturday, so there weren't any specials, but the weekday happy hour on the menu looked great too.", "author": "Heather M."}

Last night we were heading towards Rickhouse when we were drawn into the new place next door, beckoned by the man-sized nutcrackers at the door. This is an intimate bar with a smashing/whimsical design. I especially love the art nouveau chandeliers over the bar! There is also an amazing installation in the ceiling- it looks like a sneak peak into the attic of a retired circus ringleader (the person who designed it must have spent weeks combing flea markets and estate sales). The L-shaped bar is cool, white marble. I'm a sucker for a vintage-style joint with elegant touches. But I digress. \n\nNow for the important points- the cocktails are delicious and well-crafted. My group favored the spicy margarita (fresh lime juice and just a touch of jalapeno) and the Dickleberry cocktail (bourbon and fresh muddled blackberries!). The cocktails were served in coupe glasses- a nice touch. The cocktails were $10-12 each- pretty typical for San Francisco. Decent selection of beers on tap. Several friends work in the neighborhood so I'll be suggesting this place as a new happy hour option.\n\nThe bartenders- gorgeous in black dresses with red bow ties- were all friendly and surprisingly efficient. One of the gents in our group commented that they brought to mind Mad Men era bunny club cocktail waitresses. As a gal who favors vintage clothes and high heels, and longs for the days when men regularly wore well-tailored suits in the evening, I love places where the staff looks stylish (I don't count hipsters in this category). I heard a mix of accents behind the bar, too (Brazilian? Russian?).\n\nThe crowd was an interesting mix. Some charming fellow with a huge leonine mane of blond curly hair was standing behind us at the bar, ordering a round for his group, and he told the bartender to throw in another round for my group just because he was having a good time negotiating some deal (or so he said) and felt like sharing the love. Awww, that seals it- I'll be dragging my friends back here for sure.\n\nOur bartender said the theme is based upon a historical night club out near the Cliff House (which I googled, of course- it was called Topsy's Roost). Wow! I wish we still had a night club with chicken coop booths with slides to the dance floor and a swinging big band!", "author": "Mishka L."}

The place is narrow and long, but small, one bathroom and it's super hot in the back, ventilation issues? \n\nMy friend and I found a spot at the tail end of the bar, were given a menu by a nice bartender (who looked burnt-out already at 6PM). I ordered the 1929 Honey (?? can't remember the name!) and my friend got the drink with bourbon and rosemary.\n\nUm, did you use alcohol in these drinks? I felt bad for the frazzled bartender as she was likely feeling pressured while her micro-managing supervisor was hovering nearby. But the drinks were still sub-par, and my friend's was half empty, and it was $21, not including tip, not cool, it was happy hour! So we finished our drinks and headed to trusty old Rickhouse. Maybe Topsy's just needs some time to grow and settle in.", "author": "Crystal C."}

Hey, if you order a lycee martini in San Francisco, yes it is gonna be pricey...\nAnyway, pretty much just ok.  The parking was easy on a Saturday at 5, and not many people in the place.

I chose the Strawberry Basil Martini while my partner picked out something else that I totally can't remember now. \n\nService took a bit longer than I would have expected given the number of people in the bar (ie, not empty but not crowded either) but eventually we had our drinks and we settled into the padded bench to sip and take in the decorating.\n\nThis place is definitely odd and strange in the decorations. Toys are held up on the opposite side of a wire mesh ceiling. The seats are worn and old looking, making the place look more antique than it really is. The sign outside, a colourful carnival styled font, along with the two large wooden nutcracker statues next to the doors give the impression that this is a place for kids but it couldn't be further from the truth. The lighting is really dim but it adds to the strange atmosphere.\n\nThis was a neat place to hang out for a round of drinks and relax for a bit.

Then Angela (one of the owners) told me she was opening a new bar. I was skeptical at first bc the staff at Playland was so amazing that I couldn't believe she could recreate that. Well... She did. \n\nTopsys is so amazing. Great high end cocktails with an upbeat atmosphere. Rickhouse, which is next door, is known for their cocktails, but they take at least 20 mins to make. Topsys' has cocktails equally as delicious and high end: however, they are made in less than half the time.", "author": "Andrew C."}

Then, like an onimous, creepy old-fashioned toy store from a horror movie, the entrance to Tospy's came into view. We really did think it was a toy store at first and walked right by, sidestepping the spooky life-size nutcrackers outside.\n\nAnyway, something shiny caught my eye and we went back, and Topsy's turned out be an insanely adorable circus-themed bar. Like 1920's big top, side show circus. Cool photos, creeptastic little clown statues, a hammered tin ceiling, and super fun bar stools on giant springs.\n\nOur bartender was great, although it probably helped that we were there during happy hour and it was very quiet. We had a manhito (mojito with whiskey), Topsy's (tequila, pomegranate juice, whipped egg white), whiskey and water, and a really tasty cider on tap from Oregon. Everything was delicious, beautifully prepared, and good strength. A little expensive, but I'm used to Sonoma County prices - still, I'll definitely go back to try some more of their adorable drinks!", "author": "Rachel M."}

I'm not a beer person, but this place had Goose Island Sofie, which is the only one I can drink without regretting the decision. $8 a glass is pretty expensive, but considering the area, it's alright. \n\nThe server was really nice, she was watching the game as well. We also ordered the shrimp sandwich, which was around $20 after tax and everything. It was creamy and came with a side salad. It was pretty bland as far as sandwiches go, but the salad had a nice vinaigrette. \n\nThey didn't have brisket or pulled pork when we went in.

I really believe in it.\n\nDuring the day, I had read about this place on Eater SF, but it was just one of many articles on the blogs I followed. After work, I was out celebrating (long story) and bar hopping. My friends and I went to Rickhouse, but even with my friend flashing cash around, it was difficult to get a drink. So we said, hey, we noticed another bar a couple of doors down---let's just go there!\n\nIt turned out to be Topsy's. I didn't make the connection at first (though I thought it was weird I had never noticed this place before) until I noticed all the clown pictures and remembered reading about circus themes. Aha! This is the place I had read about! How fortuitous I ended up here! It was meant to be!\n\nThe drinks are super tasty.  I tried three of the cocktails (the berry one, the margarita, and the martini) and loved each one. My favorite was the strawberry basil martini. Plus the crowd is fun. Some guy was asking randos to sign his friend's birthday card. And we swear that there was a time traveler with a handlebar moustache sitting at the bar, just observing...\n\nThere are some growing pains here. Like the other reviews mention, we were waiting a long time for our drinks. Then we asked for the check, and they charged us for the wrong drinks and for more than what we ordered. But--and I don't know if this was in connection with or independent of the bill situation--the owner was sitting next to us and offered to buy us a round of drinks. It made me feel appreciated, like they cared about its patrons (though, to be fair, this definitely colored my rating).", "author": "J J."}

For a Friday night, it was not too crowded which I did not mind at all, had nice background music, and what I love the most is that no one was telling us we can't go in and out, or that we cant stay outside for as long as you want to. Usually at other bars or clubs in the city they control how many people go outside  and what not but not here. Also no cover! One thing that this place needs is a second bathroom.

After all they deserve some attention for great service and great drinks!\n\n_______\nThe Service:\nWonderful wonderful wonderful. Although I must say I felt a bit sorry that the lovely lady bartender had to deal with many drunk men trying to touch her while she was doing her work. Very disrespectful and rude. So if you see any comments or reviews about the women being bad or the b word, just question it. \n\nBecause the bartenders there are very serious about their work and executing it so people can get their drinks on time, but from what I've seen they have a great reputation here in the financial district. I see the bartenders talk with some guests as if they're friends! Now that's how you know their service is well-known to be good. Good bonds with customers.\n\n\n_______\nThe Atmosphere:\nThe decorations are a bit interesting and creepy...there's boxes of old clown/circus like things looming over in a dark room held back by some sort of net or barrier. A bit strange if you ask me, but it's subtle details.\n\nIt's also a little bit tight in their too. I feel like I'm stuck in some sort of hallway with other people. Expect people to come to this bar after work too and gossip about co-workers or something like that. Some folks come to just hang out too. I've seen people bring their dates here as well. \n\nIt's a nice dark atmosphere like I see most bars. Candle lit and whatnot. There's outdoor seating too if you'd like that but just be careful for the usual SF bums.\n\n\n_______\nThe Beverages/Food:\nMy review for this is going to be very short. Let's just put it this way.\n1. I usually never order foods from bars.\n2. I don't drink a lot. In fact I HATE alcoholic beverages so it would be VERY unfair of my inexperienced and ignorant tastes on alcohol to judge this place.\n\nI will say though, that watching the bartenders make drinks is like watching a beautifully well crafted water paint happen. It's so quick yet they're so good with it that everything seems well mixed. Judging from body language, facial expression and extremely unfinished almost-full dickelberry drink, the bartender knew that I wasn't into alcoholic drinks, so she whipped up a really nice drink for me...I don't know the name of it but it was a wonderful mix of berries and the basil really covered up the alcohol in it. \n\n\n_______\nOther Comments: \nIt's not an extremely wonderful awesome place, but it's great! I recommend anyone bringing anyone here (co-workers, family, date, friend, etc) if they just want to grab a drink after work of after hanging out in the city. I apologize for the lack of reviewing on the drinking part, but that's just who I am. Alcohol isn't my thing.\n\n\n_______\nScore review:\n-1 star because it's nothing spectacularly mind-blowing or anything. Just decent.\n+2 stars for the accommodating service\n+2 stars for drinks and neat atmosphere", "author": "J. H."}
