Maybe because I come really early in the morning or just before they're closing? (Must be all the techies living in this Area who don't roll out of bed until 9am!)\n\nAnyways, I really like this place. Their baked goods, of course, are a delight and I've yet have to have an item that I didn't like. My go-to is the sourdough bread - the one in square format. Ideally they will slice it for me so that i can just put it in a plastic bag and pop it into the freezer: it's delicious for breakfast on the weekends as it pairs so well with my homemade blackberry jam. \n\nAside from their baked goods though, I love the workers' attitude here: I frequent a lot of bakeries all throughout San Francisco and one thing I always note is that the people working their are not very friendly. To the point of being snotty. Here at Neighbor Bakehouse I have only experienced friendly smiles and a welcoming attitude.", "author": "Uli B."}

I'm still in the process of getting used to eating ginger and ginger flavored things. I used to hate ginger and the flavor but I'm trying to be more open to it since it's good for you. This has a strong ginger taste but not all over - mainly on the bottom, so I did really enjoy this pastry! I'm still not super accustomed to the taste so if you like ginger and love the ginger taste, you'll probably rate this a 5/5. For me, I'm not quite there yet but I did enjoy the parts that weren't so gingery. The pastry is delicious but I wish they kept them warm to eat fresh but I'm sure there's a reason why they don't. I was nervous there would be a long line or they would be sold out since this is what they're known for but there was no line and plenty to get! They have all their pastry items on a cart and on trays side by side for the worker to put into bags for you. Next time I'll definitely try other items! So happy to find a spot where there's no ridiculous line and quality sweet and savory items!  There's literally one space designated for this spot on the sidewalk next to their entrance. The surrounding area is kinda hard to find parking. I'll def be back!", "author": "Valerie T."}

Never have I heard of a twice-baked croissant! What is this sorcery? Pure magic! You'd think it'd be burnt or something, but it had that perfect crunch, was light, moist, and had the perfect density. Like I could actually eat this all at once, but I didn't because...calories. Pistachio and blackberry went together well, surprisingly. The cookie-like crust on top was delicious and added a nice contrast in texture to the croissant. The filling wasn't overly sweet, and I seriously could not stop eating this. I had to force myself to put it away and save the rest for the following day. \n\nAlso the smells wafting out of the bakery. Ahhh. I could smell it all the way at the end of the line.\n\nThe cashier was super friendly and there are so many options to choose from. He helped me choose this croissant and I did not regret my choice.

Crisp and buttery on the outside, soft layered and airy on the inside, with the flavor of the roasted almonds and cinnamon throughout.  The perfect start to any day. \n\n(2) The ginger pull apart - The way this bread is twisted not only makes this bread a fun pull apart to share with friends, but it is also positioned as to maximize the surface area and optimize the crunch effect - and add to that the flavor of the fiery ginger. This is another classic. \n\n(3) The Twice Baked Croissants - I really enjoy the various flavors of the twice makes. The way that the berries complement the herbs, all baked inside a twice baked croissant for that added crunchy texture makes for a complex flavor combination with varying debts of texture. \n\n(4) The Kimchee Toast - On top the buttery, fresh thick milk toast are the tart kimchee, scallions, and cheese.  Though I have a sweet tooth, I quite enjoy the savory bread on occasion.  The one thing that makes this one more enjoyable is reheating it - else the kimchee-cheese-scallion is easy to separate from the toast and the situation gets messy. \n\nThe tea and coffee are also carefully made cup by cup - a good wake up call. \n\nNeighbor Bakehouse, I'm so happy we are neighbors.", "author": "Vivienne K."}

The Dogpatch is a pain to get to/around if you bike or take public transit. My longish bike ride involved cracked roads, train tracks, and lotsa air pollution.\n\nMaybe it's for the best this place is off the beaten path though. The line moved quick but was out the door the whole time I was here, and the outdoor benches were full the whole time. Would probably be a bit too packed in a more central part of town. Here though, it was just packed enough for a fun and busy vibe without being overly crowded.\n\nEveryone's willing to make the trek because these are some goood pastries. The blackberry pistachio twice baked (~$5) was deliciously sweet and flaky. There could have been more pistachio but every time I got a bite of some it was perfect. The lemon olive sourdough was also delicious--not too sour with a perfect texture.\n\nOn a sunny weekend morning, I highly recommend this place.

The cashiers here work efficiently, so it felt like no time before I made it to the beginning of the line. Once I was inside the bakery, I was confronted with an onslaught of delicious-looking pastries. I wanted to order EVERYTHING. After hearing rave reviews about the cinnamon almond bostock, I ordered one and I am so glad I did. What a decadent pastry bursting with almond flavor! My friend ordered the ham and cheese morning bun which was also heavenly -- the croissant dough is light, buttery perfection. \n\nDespite being crowded on a Saturday morning, my friends and I were able to snag a spot at the outdoor tables. There's nothing better than enjoying a beautiful San Francisco day with a delicious pastry and coffee in hand. My only complaint is that I have to travel all the way to the Dogpatch to get my pastry fix. \n\nPistachio blackberry twice-baked croissant, I'm coming back for you!", "author": "Elyse W."}

Being anywhere in close proximity of this little bakery is a dangerous thing for my wallet and waistline.\n\nYes, it's pricy! But I've never had anything I regretted buying from here. The coconut pecan chocolate cookie is a buttery delight that is the size of my face. You can taste the fresh berries in the oat bars. I had the cinnamon bostock and the german coffee cake too, and they were both pretty good. I think I greatly prefer the croissants and flaky pastries from here even though cakes and breads are usually my go-to's.

It's a bit windy, so guard your stuff as you eat your food outside.\n\nThe almond Bostock $4.75 costs a lot, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with it. It's a French Toast, but better. It's got a crunchy outside crust with a moist, sweet, fluffy center. I loved the almond on this. I was so tempted to finish the whole thing.\n\nThe ginger pull apart $4.25 (?) was a lot bigger than I thought! Compared to pictures on Yelp at least. It's very comparable to a kouign amann.

They do a good job of making fresh flaky pastries (like the guava and cheese pastelito) as well as delicious breads.\n\nThe only downside is that there is usually a long line out the door, that can definitely be intimidating but it usually goes by pretty quick. Also, I have yet to try more savory items here but I tried the smoked salmon and cream cheese croissant and it wasn't very good.

Super cute bakery in dogpatch with outdoor seating.  You honestly cannot go wrong with anything here, both savory and sweet.  \n\nFirst off, you must get one of their twice baked croissants.  We have tried the blackberry pistachio and raspberry hazelnut, we prefer the raspberry one but both our good.\n\nYou have to try a \"doughpbun\", they are custard filled buns.  It is generously filled and they make good custard.  Our favorite is the passionfruit but they have chocolate and guava too.  \n\nGinger pull apart, like a large kougin amman; it is caramelized monkey bread almost.  The ginger is just enough.  \n\nFor savory, the curry potato, sauerkraut cheddar tart, kimchee toast, and croque madame.  All excellent but if I had to pick a favorite probably the sauerkraut cheddar.  What's nice about the kimchee and croque, they have an egg on top of it and they will warm it up for you too. \n\nThey have great bread too, we love buying a loaf there (only $6) and making good toasts at home.  This is the bread that is used at the Mill (where it is $5 a toast, so buy a loaf here and make it at home!).\n\nThis place is a little out of the way but worth the trek.

With that being said, my fiance and I were a little grumpy from getting sun-burned on our walk over - I tried not to let that grumpiness impede the delightful pastries.  Instead, I tried to turn my frown upside down, and address this mirage as what it was: a treat, a savior at long last!  And it was a savior - it killed the hunger in my stomach, but I still cannot make myself give Neighbor Bakehouse more than a 3.5 star review.\n\nHere's why.  I loved the sweet pastries, and I think I would be a fool if I did not.  However, the savory pastries were less of an attraction to me.  I know the talk around town is that the kouign ahmans here are on a need-to-buy-basis, but I probably could have done without them.  I ordered the ham and cheese one, and yes it was good, but I wasn't swooning.  We also got tbe croque madame which tasted nothing like the real thing.  Besides this, it was cold amd the flavor was completely off.\n\nThe sweet pastries, though.  Mmmm, those are scrumptious.  While we enjoyed the savory pastries on the cafe's outside seating we actually nibbled at these goodies while sipping on some beer at the Anchor Brew Tour.  We had tbe blackberry pistachio pastry allng with the almond bockstock - both were crazy doughy and sweet, but not overly sweet, not to mention both were doused in powdered sugar.  I looked (and felt) like Mrs. Clause after eating them.\n\nSo, I got 4 different pastries, but that added up to something outrageous...unless you don't think that $28 is a little ridiculous for pastries that are going to be eaten in a manner of minutes.  I'm all for supporting local businesses, but it makes it hard to do when it's so expensive, and I only loved half the items I got.  Part of the reason that the savory pastries weren't as good were because they were sitting out for however many hours.  They didn't seem as fresh, and that was probably the biggest downfall for me.  It seems that yes, the items may not sit out for  too long as people are lined up out the door (partly because it is tiny inside) to buy them, but some of the items had clearly sat out for longer than others.", "author": "Lauren K."}

Dare I even say, it's better than Tartine, Mr. Holmes, and Janes Bakery in the city...(well, it is)...\n\nI'm pretty sure I've tried just about every single pastry that I possibly could (minus the meat ones), and my goodness are they the perfect savory or sweet snacks!! Or meals!! Whatever you want them to be!!\n\nMy only wish is that this place would be closer to me...sad, right? Or not sad haha... But seriously, parking's a little tougher around here, unless you're willing to walk. The blocks in the Dogpatch area are longgggg blocks. So get ready to work a little for these little gems. Benches/tables out in front to catch some rays while chowing down.\n\nMy favs are the ginger pull, twice baked (anything and everything), mushroom croissant tart (ah! so good!), and passion fruit bun.

Oh wait, there's no sign anywhere that says no photos. And it's a place that serves food and even though people have mixed opinions on whether one should take photos of food, many do it, so it's more or less \"normal\" these days? Was she worried about potential competitors trying to spy on them? Oh actually, Neighbor's own instagram has photos and videos of their baked goods and their kitchen \u200d I wasn't blocking traffic either because it was a Wednesday at 7:20am and we were the only people inside - so what is it? I have tried most of their stuff and everything is mediocre (subjective statement of course - evacuated based on my preferences) except for the raspberry hazelnut croissant (and second place: pistachio blackberry croissant). Those are so good. Most negative reviews on google and yelp are about their customer service. It's true that the customer service has never been overwhelmingly positive but it was never much of a problem because it was never technically bad - their staff are just like every waiter in France who doesn't work for tips - kind of condescending and/or not giving a damn but still overall reasonably efficient. The curly haired woman with glasses though - I saw a yelp reviewer who was said to frequent the place weekly and wrote that the service is bad  but she was especially bad and needed an attitude check \u200d not working for tip is not inherently an excuse to be rude though - servers in Australia don't work on tip but the majority of them are super friendly. I'll just go to Bluestone lane coffee shop in the city that serves their raspberry hazelnut croissant in the future (and much better coffee).

He also got a cold brew coffee. \n\nThe good thing about coming right when they open is that everything is warm and fresh!! \n\nSauerkraut tart: really good! I was apprehensive that this would have an overwhelming sauerkraut taste, which I don't mind, but it didn't at all. It's also very substantial so 1 would be perfect for a quick breakfast! \n\nSmoked fish croissant: the croissant comes covered with sesame seeds which I enjoyed. Its very flaky and light, and the smoked fish with cream cheese wasn't overpowering for the morning. However, I think this was my least favorite (not that it wasn't good, I just thought this one didn't shine like the rest) \n\nPistachio blackberry twice baked: THIS IS WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF. SOOOOO GOOOOOOOOD. We didn't eat this till a lot later in the day, and it was amazing, so I can imagine eating it fresh out of the oven would be an out of body experience. MUST GET. \n\nPotato chorizo tart: I had a small bite. It was good! Hefty. But BF ate the rest of it for a late breakfast and said it was just as good cold.

Too hard to eat.\n-Ginger pullapart texture is too hard for my tastes, but I know everyone else loves it. I think if it were softer, more tender, I would enjoy as well as I love sugary ginger flavors.\n-Croissants aren't too buttery, so they're okay, not as good as Tartine's. Perhaps 3.5/5.\n-Chorizo potato turnover-thing is 2/5, did not like it. It was like a cold hot pocket. The mashed potato texture was not pleasant.\n-Chocolate croissants are flaky and indulgent, definitely get.\n-Morning buns are yummy, and I love the poppy seeds and sesame seeds galore.\n\nBest to reheat the treats so they're eaten warm. \n\nEach treat is $4-$8.50 appx.

My favorite of the pastries I tried was the pistachio blackberry twice baked. It was pretty decadent for a croissant- buttery, flaky, and definitely satisfies my sweet tooth. The ginger pull-apart was similar to a Kouign Amann, enjoyable but B. Patisserie's version is so good, everything else pales in comparison. I am forever ruined. \n\nThe passion fruit doughp bun was really disappointing. It's only now that I type this out that I realize the intent behind the spelling. Dough + p = dope! Major points for the name, but the taste was not dope. The brioche bun was dry, and it took 5 bites of dough before I got to any filling. The passion fruit curd was a tad too sour, and I generally love tart desserts. I wish I'd gotten the cinnamon almond bostock instead. This was a complete waste of calories and money.\n\nI think I'd still rather wait in the long line at Tartine.", "author": "Karen S."}

Mr. Holmes was sold out of a lot of items so we headed to Neighbor Bakehouse and man are we glad we did. There was a big line outside on Sunday morning around 11am.

We ordered:\n\nPistachio blackberry croissants\nCinnamon almond bostock \nChocolate claw \nGinger pull aparts\nSauerkraut smoked cheddar peppadew tart\n\nPersonally, I only tried the pistachio croissant and the cinnamon almond bostock. But they were SO good. The croissant was flaky and moist with the perfect amount of pistachio flavoring and the bostock was flavorful with a delicious crust. I didn't try the other items but man, the pastries were the hit of the party and they went quick! Their pastries range from $3-$7ish, which sounds ridiculous but it is worth it once you take that first bite. \n\nParking in this area alright, better than most other parts of SF.

They were already sold out of a bunch of items, such as a financier, doughp flavor, and others, but there was still a good selection to choose from.

I can see why this is on the 7x7 list.\n-Lemon Lime Doughp Bun ($4): Just ok, but I thought the lemon lime filling was too tart. I would try this again if it had another filling (like their chocolate pudding one) since the consistency of the doughp bun was interesting.\n-Pistachio Blackberry Twice Baked Croissant ($4.25): Also delicious, and another must order! They do not skimp on the filling, and although the filling is plentiful, it isn't too sweet.\n\nI will definitely be back to get more croissants, and also to try their other items and breads.

I enjoyed them both. I think that I would have really benefited from trying the plain croissant to have a better baseline of what they offer. \n\nThe ginger pull-apart bread was delicious. It was subtly spicy and have such a good bite. Texture is everything with me and I loved the texture of this bread. It's also a funny shape so that there are many bits that are risen for more crispiness since it's closer to the heat in the over. Definitely recommend this one. Bonus, it has little sugar crystals on the bottom. The sugar didn't make it overly sweet but definitely added crunch. \n\nThe pistachio/blackberry croissant was sliced and filled with the blackberry and pistachio. It was also topped with a pistachio crumble and a had a powder sugar snow. I wouldn't say it was my favorite. It was a little too sweet for my taste (this is coming from a girl that like the smallest itty bit of jam on her toast). It's understandable for me. I did really like the croissant base and think that contributes to me wanting to try their plain one. Super buttery! I love that extra butter. making Paula Dean proud. \n\nTip for parking: plenty of parking off of Third street, walk 4-6 blocks west and find yourself among the warehouse-ish looking buildings. Try to avoid the Aina crowd...

Total was about $8. \n\nWe sat on the bench outside and saw what other people had. Whatever they ordered, looks good too. I took my first bite out of the raspberry and ginger pull apart, and my taste buds were dancing! It was delicious. Flaky, buttery, sweet and fresh. Reminds me of a Paris.

The pastries are delicious and their bread is also very good. They have coffee/expresso but it's a simple set up as they put their focus on the baked goods. Service is friendly and efficient. It's a small space so there may be a line but they staff does a great job moving people through. \nTo me their highlight is their croissants. They have different types from traditional butter, chocolate, and even an everything croissant a play on the everything bagel. So far everything I've tried here has been good and did not disappoint. \nWhat I love about their croissants is that they are so flaky and buttery and are perfectly baked. Every bite has that initial crispness when you bite in followed by the buttery chewiness inside. \nThis place is a little out of the way but it's well worth the trip or a stop if you are in the area.

My brother told me about this bakery and we took a morning run (gotta earn it) to see if it lived up to the hype that he heard about. I don't even have much of a sweet tooth, but this was everything and more.\n\nWe ordered the following 3:\nHam and Cheese Morning Bun (4/5): Oh man, the texture and color were gorgeous. You could see the individual layers of the bun which resembled a croissant in bun-form and the outer shell had a great flake to it. We were a little disappointed to find that the center was largely hollow but quickly got over it when we tasted it. The inside was moist without being too dense and the cheese was incorporated beautifully with the dough. The slice of ham provided a nice contrast in texture while adding to the savoriness of the bun.\n\nPassionfruit pastry (4.5/5): When we cut this piece in half, the dough looked airy and almost dry and we expected it to be a bit on the dry side just based on looks. Boy were we proven wrong. The dough had was anything but dry but still had a good amount of bite and fluffiness to it. The passionfruit creme on the inside was generous and just the right amount of tart to counter the sweetness of the powdered sugar on the exterior.\n\nPistachio Blackberry Twice Baked (5/5): This. This piece is a slice of heaven. I love both pistachios and blackberries but never thought of trying the combination until now and it was absolutely gorgeous. The filling was amazingly soft and moist; the slight saltiness and nuttiness of the pistachio balanced out the sweetness of the blackberries perfectly and resulted in a bite that was just the right amount of sweetness. I'll get this one every time I come back.\n\nI'm glad we swung by this spot.

Not bad for SF brunch, considering a meal for one consisting of mediocre eggs could be the same. On the pastry quality alone it's between a 4 and 5 but rounding up. I don't like overly sweet desserts so, the pastries are the perfect level of slight sugariness, layers of flour and butter - clearly fresh and made with high quality ingredients.\n\nWas it among the best pastries I've had? No, not mindblowingly good, but still pretty damn good. I'd say top tier for SF and very reasonable for the price. Neighbor Bakehouse is way better than Tartine, but the craftsmanship level is not as high as b. patisserie, nor are the pastries as delicate. The best part is it's not crowded, but that'll probably change. Outdoor seating, bus your own tables, lemon and lime water at the station.\n\nWe sampled a few of these\nOrange Hazelnut Financier (3/5) - Soft crumb cake like and fairly uniform texture throughout. Interesting flavor, with bits of candied orange.\nGinger Pull Apart Bread (4/5) - Subtle cinnamon sugar and ginger, some pieces are drier and flaky, some pieces are layers of softer, buttery dough, but one of my favorite parts is how the bottom gets slightly chewy and hardened caramelized crust piece.\nHam and Cheese Morning Bun (3.5/5) - The cheese congealed into a big chunk around the center, sliced ham also lay in a swirl in between the outer part and inner. Sunflower and poppy seeds line the outside.\nKimchi Sauerkraut Tart (4/5) - Bread was buttery and amazing, kimchi could be spicier, cheese wasn't really necessary. I found that much more filling than the morning bun.\n\nI've also had the\nTwice Baked Pistachio Blueberry Croissant (4.5/5) - Really good and where the technique shows.

Now that we got that out of the way...I wasn't a huge fan of the takes because I think they were out of my croissant comfort zone. \n\nPistachio blackberry twice-baked croissant - It was a little too sweet and by double baking it...lots of the flakiness that I love about a croissant goes away. \nEverything croissant - I was intrigued...because everything bagels and the everything but the bagel seasoning from trader joes are two of my favorite things. So I went all in and was mildly disappointed...there was cream cheese in the croissant...like a bagel. I dunno...I guess I wasn't expecting it and didn't really care for it. \nPlain Croissant - they ran out when we first got in, but right before we left, a fresh batch just came out! It was good, but a little too much butter and not enough flaky. It was delicious...but I think it was partially because it was still hot (there is nothing better than hot, fresh bread...even if its gross bread but fresh from the oven) so I feel like it got an unfair advantage because it was still warm. As I was biting into it, I felt that I was eating a warm, fresh from the oven, costco croissant, and I mean no disrespect - costco croissants when fresh are good. \n\nI probably would not make the drive out again, but I'm glad I tried.", "author": "Kathy L."}

Can they teach me how to bake like that???\nI still have yet to try Mr. Holmes (not down for the early wait in line), but so far this place is hard to beat!\nI first had their Everything Crossiant at another cafe and it blew me away. I had to come to the OG location, so I drove to this place at 10am on a Saturday. There was a line out the door, but it went by quickly with 10 people ahead of me. I hate waiting in line in the cold, but the croissants were calling me and I couldn't say no.\nI got a box of 6 pastries and in my box I had:\n\nEVERYTHING CROISSANT (5/5)\nHands.down.best.sh*t.ever.just.get.it.dont.question.me.\nThis croissant was flak y and crunchy (from the poppy seeds), yet soft and fluffy on the inside. Love love love the cream cheese filling inside. Sounds so simple yet it blew my mind everytime I take a bite. My sister was sneaking bites and practically devoured 1/3 of it when I wasn't looking. It's that seriously that good.\n\nSAUERKRAUT TART (4.5/5)\nThis was recommended by one of the worker and it's one of of my top favorite now too. It's crunchy and buttery. I love pastries with multi flavors and this hits the spot with sourness from the filling and the savorness from the baked cheese. Reminds me of those savory bread from a Chinese bakery, but with an updated bread base.\n\nPISTACHIO BLACKBERRY TWICE BAKED (4.5/5)\nThis is my sister's all time favorite (still like the everything croissant better). I didn't know pistachio can be incorporated like this in a croissant! The pistachio was creamy and it mixed so well with the flaky soft texture of the croissant. Sadly my sister devoured it before I get a piece of it with the blackberry.\n\nHAM AND CHEESE MORNING BUN (3/5)\nHonestly I got this one because it was pretty. Maybe because I ate it hours after I got it so it wasn't super fresh, but it was medicore. Don't get me wrong it was good, but compared to the other amazing pastries they had it just didn't stand out.\n\nPASSION FRUIT DOUGHP BUN (4/5)\nYum yum yum. The passion fruit filling was refreshing after eating all of the savory carbs. It wasn't too overwhelming like I expected and compliments the breading around the cream.\n\nGERMAN COFFEE CAKE (4/5)\nAnother refreshing treat after eating the savory pastries. Don't remember exactly the taste of it, but it wasn't disappointing either.\n\nOverall everything was bomb.com and everyone needs to come here. The end.", "author": "Grace Z."}

Since I wanted to hit up his other reco Plow for breakfast/brunch, I knew I needed to be committed and get myself up NLT 6:30AM on a Sunday so I can get the best of both worlds while minimizing my wait time.  We arrived at Neighbor around 7:30 when most of SF is still sleeping and therefore super quiet as we walked up which immediately reminded me of my early morning arrival in Portland Maine not too long ago before it started bustling.  Just like Two Fat Cats in Portland, most of their freshly baked pastries are still on racks upon walking in enticing me to get more than I really needed.  \n\nPassion Fruit DoughP Bun - This was my favorite one that I wished my husband didn't forget the cooler so I could take one to go since the cream of the DoughP requires refrigeration if you don't eat it soon after purchase.  \n\n2 Pistachio Blackberry Twice Baked Croissant - My second favorite as it was not overly sweet and I love the nuttiness of the whole pistachios giving it a good balance.  \n\nTwo Morning Buns with Ham and Gruyere - It was good but I kind of wish there was a little more gruyere in it to fill in the hole in the middle.  \n\nHazelnut Candy Orange Financier - This was on the dense side kind of like a pound cake\n\nGinger Pull Apart - Upon first bite, I wasn't a fan but as I continued, I liked it more.  Good for sharing but probably a bit too much for one person especially if you want to try other pastries.  \n\nOverall, Neighbor Bakehouse is a great friendly neighborhood bakery that I just wish was in my neighborhood but then again, it is probably better for our waistline that it is a 45+ min drive away, making it more of a treat than an addiction!!", "author": "Joyce Z."}

In terms of visual appeal, most of their pastries are relatively dark in color (so they look dry and not sweet), but don't let looks deceive you.  This was good for me so I didn't order everything--some other bakeries make me want everything, but this one visually limited my lust.  Neighbor's flaky buttery pastries rival b. Patisserie's (but nothing comes close to b's Kouign Amann), though their menus differ completely with the exception of the plain croissant.\n\nCinnamon Almond Bostock ($4) - basically a buttery slice of cinnamon bread slathered with almond frangipane.  Really good with flaky ends and melt-in-your-mouth soft buttery center.  Almond frangipane is sweet but no too sweet, with a relatively generous portion of soft sweet almonds.  Think of this as a less greasy, slightly more firm almond croissant.\n\nPistachio Blackberry Twice-Baked ($4) - basically a sliced croissant with blackberry jam and pistachio creamy crumble inside.  The pistachio innards are fantastic, and the croissant is flaky outside, buttery, and moist inside.\n\nHam and Cheese Morning Bun ($4.25) - interior is rolled in sesame seeds and poppy seeds which really distinguishes this from your typical ham and cheese pastry.  Really soft and tasty, but cheese formed a hard disc on the bottom which I didn't particularly care for, however this is a good savory option.\n\nGinger Pull-Apart Bread ($3.75) - hubby liked it.  I liked the buttery pieces (personally not a fan of ginger), however the pastry was not consistent throughout--some pieces super buttery, some super gingery, some slightly dry.  Hubby would get again, but I'd pass, as if prefer for it to be more consistent and moist throughout.  Overhyped in my opinion.\n\nChocolate Pudding Dough Bread ($4) - good pudding interior and nice salty crunchy chocolatey bits on top.  However, the bread itself was slightly dry--I understand how another Yelper mentioned it tasted stale...I don't think it's really stale (they're constantly turning pastries with the constant line at this place!)--I think it's just that the bread has to be relatively harder to hold its shape with the liquidy pudding inside.  I warmed it up in the microwave for 12 seconds--but that was probably 10 seconds too long, because the pudding became chocolate milk.  Tasty but messy pudding!  I would only get again if I were craving chocolate and happened to be here--otherwise id prefer a b. Patisserie nutella Kouign Amann or even a La Boulangerie chocolate pot de creme danish.\n\nEat outside at the multiple picnic benches or take out.  Free parking on side streets and Illinois.

Perhaps that is not a good comparison as they are not exactly alike (pastry vs. muffin) but in terms of a savory breakfast treat, this morning bun is it.  I even prefer this over the ham and cheese croissant at Arsicault.\n\nThe guava and cream cheese pastelito was good but I wish there had been a bit more of the guava.  The pastry itself was really good but we were looking for a higher ratio of filling to dough.\n\nThe country loaf was really good.  The crust was not to thick and had a bit of chew.  The interior was dense, moist, tender and hole-y.  I didn't find the loaf that sour at all.  We tried the bread with butter, cheese, pate and even avocado.  It was a great base when paired with other items or fine on its own. \n\nMy visit was on a Friday at 9:30 am.  On this day, parking looked to be a difficult as others have mentioned.  For the normally quiet period during the holiday week, I was hoping this area would be fairly deserted.  No chance.  I was luckily enough to find a spot at the end of the block, around the corner, without much difficulty.  On a weekday I would recommend coming with someone that can drop you off or look for parking while you hop out to pick up the pastries.  The lined moved fairly quickly and I don't think I waited more than 5 minutes, which allowed me ample time to peruse the menu and look to see what was available on the racks.  There is no place to sit inside as the space is allocated to the baking operations.  There are a few tables outside.\n\nI hear parking is much easier on the weekends but the lines are much longer.  Hopefully it won't take me another year to make a return trip!", "author": "Melissa L."}

The pastry is composed of croissant dough scraps pieced together and layered with sugar and crystallized ginger. Its got a bit of that super on trend kouign Amman swagger with twice the size and twice the textural variance. The top is light and airy like those awesome bubbles that form on the crust of a pizza. Inside it's doughy and soft, like the inner layers of a cinnamon roll or raised donut. The bottom gets a crazy crystalized sugar caramelization that sticks to your teeth like ginger taffy. The aroma is buttery with dancing ginger spice and is never too sweet or too spicy. It is perfection. \n\nAnd that's just one pastry!!\n\nNeighbor doesn't get the shine of some of the hipper spots in the city but it deserves all the glory. Their croissants are perfect, and I've tried them all from plain to chocolate (claw) to everything (bagel) to salmon to blackberry pistachio. Flawless layers of fluffy flour and butter. They also have a wonderful sauerkraut tart and rotating veggie tarts that perfectly balance savory ingredients with a sweet dough. I have literally tried almost every thing this shop has to offer and have never been disappointed. \n\nThey also offer whole loaves of bread, and recently I picked up a fresh sourdough sandwich loaf ($6) and made the best French toast of my life with it.

At 10AM, there was a good crowd at the tables outside the store, so I knew I was at the right place.  Everything on the menu looked so good that I wanted try all the different pastries!  I really liked how they had a lot of sweet and savory options.  I ended up getting the chocolate bear claw, the mushroom tart, and the ham and cheese bun.  All three came out to $11, which I thought was pretty fairly priced for pastries.  All three were absolutely delicious and I ate 2.5 of them in one sitting!  \n\nChocolate bear claw - The buttery, slightly salty croissant juxtaposed against the chocolate was such a good combination.  The bear claw was flakey on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside like any good pastry.  The chocolate inside of the croissant was a really deep, dark chocolate, and you could really taste the quality of the chocolate.  It was delicious paired with coffee.\n\nMushroom tart -- This was my favorite out of the three!  The pastry was the same delicious pastry as the chocolate bear claw.  The tarte was very savory and had a ton of flavor.  The mushrooms were surprisingly really meaty.  The cheese was melted perfectly on top with little bits of that crispy, melted cheese on the pastry.  The manchego was a nice pairing as it was salty, creamy, but didn't overpower the tart.  I didn't really care for the sesame seeds-- they were messy and I didn't really like the flavor they added.\n\nHam and Cheese bun - I really liked this one too, but I thought the shape of the bun made it kind of hard to eat -- I would have prefer a croissant or tart shape instead.  The top half was entirely pastry, and then in the center of the bun was the cheese and ham.  It was hard bite into, so you ended up eating the bun in two halfs -- one with just pastry, and one with mostly cheese and ham.  The cheese and ham were good.  Salty, meaty, and richy, but cut with grainy whole mustard.  The middle of the pastry almost had this cheesy/gooey center.  \n\nAs with all good pastries, be prepared to make a huge flaky mess! There is only sitting room outside at a few tables, so you'll probably have to take your pastries somewhere else to eat.  Can't wait to come back to try more things on the menu!", "author": "Michelle W."}

And now that I've been, I can safely say that they live up to the hype! Mostly. The short story is that anything that's majority croissant is amazing (5 stars!) and everything else is pretty good (maybe 4 stars). \n\nMy boyfriend and I came early on a Saturday morning since I had read in some other reviews that they do tend to sell out! We ordered the pistaschio blueberry croissant, almond cinnamon \"toast\", a mango passionfruit doughp bun, and an almond latte. \n\n-Pistachio Blueberry Croissant: Their croissant pastry is superflak,  and the contrast between the slightly salty pistachio and the sweet but tart blueberry jam made it a very balanced and delectable pastry! Though, I was hoping for just a little more blueberry flavor! \n\n-Cinnamon almond Toast: Ahhh i wish they delivered on the cinnamon flavor. The almond was really, but the brioche bread just super special. Though I do love the accents of croissant they've worked into all their different pastries! This one in particular was much better having been toasted again at home. \n\n-DoughP Bun: The passionfruit mango filling was really delicious, but it almost seemed more like a dessert than breakfast! Reminded me of asian bakery cakes which are delicious, but not exactly a pastry per say... \n\n-Almond latte: Unlike a lot of pastry shops where espresso drinks suffer in quality and are a sad complement to the awesome pastries, Neighbor Bakehouse is one of the few exceptions! One of my favorite lattes i've had at an elite pastry shop.\n\nAnother plus was that parking was super easy and painless (great for those who aren't comfortable with the SF driving conditions).

Today my travels took me to Neighbor Bakehouse. Now, I was thinking before I sampled their goods, this was probably going to be a 4 star experience. Wrong.\n\nNeighbor Bakehouse is definitely 5 star material. \n\nRelying on previous reviews, I settled on the pistachio croissant and the ginger pull. I also got the apple pocket. All were excellent. Their pistachio croissant has that great buttery flakiness that's a requirement for us pastry snobs. The ginger pull reminded me of an extra large Kouign Amann, ha-ha, flaky and buttery. The apples in the little pocket were cooked all the way through, the way I like them. If you like the classic apple pie, the pocket will be your cup of tea.\n\nFrankly, I'm just blown away at the level of pastry excellence in the city.

I happened to be going past Saturday morning with my husband, when we noticed this long line of people. Being the inquisitive people we are, we moved closer to investigate, and were enticed further by the smell. I had some friends to meet, but figured we would line up anyway. It actually didn't take long to get to the front - I just wanted a butter croissant, so I sent my husband in to pick what he wanted. He came out with kimchi toast. My plan, since I was about to have lunch, was to save my croissant till after lunch, then the plan was just to eat the end of it and save the rest...well, let me tell you, that plan went right out the window once I tasted the end! I have been on a quest recently to find the perfect croissant - this one hit every point. The outside was crisp and flaky, the inside was buttery and soft with layers of deliciousness. The one bad thing, I ate it way too fast. \nI also tried the kimchi toast - soooooo good! And I'm usually not a fan of kimchi!!\nSo, needless to say, I brought my friends back here after lunch. They too were also impressed!\nAside from the amazing food, the staff here are soooo ridiculously nice! I find at some one off places like this, especially when they have rave reviews, there tends to be an arrogance that goes with some of the staff - there was not even a whiff of that here. They all seemed genuinely nice and happy to be there. \nWhen I got home, I did some research on the place and the owner, and I could be mistaken, but from the pictures it would appear that owner was one to actually serve us that day - super super nice! \nI live down in San Jose, but would more than happily trek up to the city to go this bakery.

Comparable to the quality of b patisserie and Tartine manufactory, if not better imho. Pro tips: if you're craving something savory, get the ham & cheese morning bun. I feel like with dishes like this I'm worried there will only be a sliver of meat inside, but the ham in there is plenty and delicious. A good balance with the flaky croissant exterior and a perfect size for a morning bite. When you're craving something sweet, the blackberry pistachio twice baked croissant is delicious. It has the perfect amount of tart/sweet with the nutty crunch of the pistachio. My friend got the raspberry walnut twice baked and enjoyed that too.

Their pastries, breads, and other breakfasty treats are a little bit creative and a lot delicious.\n\nHere are some of my favorites:\n-Croque madame - this sandwich is room temperature and not at all toasted like I typically like but it is still amazing. There is a tomato-based sauce that adds an some extra savory flavor, and the presence of both green onions and a generous allotment of ham make the $6.50 price point well worth it.\n\n-Blackberry pistachio twice based croissant - yep, it is everything the description says it is and a little bit more. Toasted texture is perfect. This item is also available at Four Barrel.\n\n-Doughp? I kept thinking this was a typo on the signage, but another Yelper told me it is actually intended as a play on the word \"dope.\" Translation is delicious pudding filled brioche pastry that you can get in either chocolate or passionfruit varieties.\n\nHours on the business say \"6:30am-noon(ish)\" but I have been there past 2pm on multiple Saturdays now and they are still open and serving until they run out of merchandise (or when the food truck comes to take their excess to feed the needy).", "author": "Stephanie T."}

Maybe better to walk so you don't gain a waist size.\nWorth a flight?  Let me put it this way.  If you are closer to Ble Sucre in Paris, fly there.  Otherwise, go here.\n\nEach bakery has a niche.  I feel Holmes Bake Shop and Craftsman are experimental and cutting edge.  But with Neighbor, he's been supplying local eateries with his legendary pastries for so long, everything is proven.  His creations not only sound interesting, but they are at the most basic level consistently delicious.  \n\nEveryone goes crazy for the Everything Croissant or the Ginger pastry.  Those are good.  But I love the bostock (so intriguing that this far exceeds it's historical origination as a way to get rid of stale brioche bread).  And before Neighbor opened up, I have long been in love with the pistachio croissant, obtained at places like Sophie's Cafe.  When you bite into the pistachio croissant--warm--it's like those old peppermint patties commercials:  I am transported to Istanbul, to a quiet side street of the Grand Bazaar, with a petite cup of turkish coffee and . . . this perfect, exotic pastry.  \n\nLet me give you some advice.  Don't go with too rigid an idea of what you should get.  This is the type of place you can go omakase.  Most important question for this type of place:  ask what just came out of the oven.  Be willing to wait around outside until something does come out of the oven.  Warm, newborn pastry = food orgasm.  Not the fake kind you see from the tired hosts on the Food Network.  This is the real thing. \n\nPS: They still satisfy greatly when they're not warm too.\n\nAppreciate that it's pretty much a miracle to be able to get Neighbor Bake goods finally fresh from the oven.

Mainly open in the mornings, you'll find croissants and tarts for breakfast. Plus other goodies to satisfy for later in the day.  The flavor combinations are unique and frankly, addictive. Yes, a person can be addicted to baked goods. I will find myself calculating when my next trip there will be. The sweeter baked items are just as delicious. Favorites are the Sauerkraut Tart (yes, you heard right), Everything Croissant, Mushroom Tart, Ham and Cheese Bun, and Bostock. Their Bostock is something else. Probably the best one I've had in the Bay Area, or anywhere else.  Sometimes, you may find something not on the menu, such as the scrumptious, savory bread pudding I had one Wednesday. \n\nI remember first trying one of their sauerkraut concoctions maybe 5 years ago, during an event in Dogpatch. There was no storefront, just a table setup. I think it was Greg Mindel, the founder, who was there listing off what each item was for us.  When it comes to baked goods, sauerkraut doesn't top my list of favored ingredients. But after tasting it, it just worked. Fast forward to this year, I recalled that experience and remembered the name Neighbor. Thanks to a quick internet search, I happily discovered they opened a retail shop. Which, is also their wholesale bakery, I believe. \n\nThey aren't open everyday, usually only from\nWednesday through Sunday.  The hours are early morning through noonish.  Sometimes they may close unexpectedly, so check their website or FB page, before heading there if possible. Don't become as distraught as I was when I arrived to find them closed one day, when I forgot to check their hours. There are some picnic tables set up outside, but no seating inside. \n\nThis bakery is definitely out of my neighborhood, but when I get a chance to detour here, I pick up some of their various offerings.

Took me a while, but I finally made my way over and was not disappointed at all.\n\nThe pastries here are AMAZING. I've had every sweet baked good they offer. The menu is definitely overwhelming, but if you make your way through, you won't be disappointed. \n\nHere's a list of my favorite must-tries:\n1. Pistachio blackberry twice-baked\nThis croissant is no joke. It's delicious. The outside is flaky, buttery goodness and the inside is chewy with an amazing mixture of blackberry and pistachio. I always have to buy at least 2. Occasionally there are other berries instead of blackberry, but those variants are just as delicious.\n\n2. Ginger pull apart\nGet this. No, seriously, get it. When it comes to amazing, buttery, flaky doughs, Neighbor excels. The taste of ginger comes across well, but it's not overpowering and you really can't stop after just one piece. Heating it up makes it even better.\n\n3. Passion fruit doughp bun\nImagine a croissant as a cupcake with passion fruit cream filling. That's sort of what this doughp is. The passion fruit filling is really tasty and its acidity cuts through the sweetness of the dough (not that the sweetness is a bad thing). These usually sell out early. \n\nOverall, this place is awesome. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes baked goods. And even if you don't, you still won't be disappointed.

I don't know what else I can add to this.  I don't think there's one thing here that I don't like.  They don't actually have THAT much stuff, but whenever I go I feel the need to order everything so it ends up being a lot.  Definitely get there early and make sure you're buying for a group so you can share and split stuff.

I get that mistakes happen and this isn't some terrible tragedy, but it would have been nice to get a little more than just a choice between have your money back or come get it yourself.

Whether it's just walking by the storefront and seeing relaxed, happy people enjoying a flaky croissant in the sun or actually stopping inside as a nice break from work to grab a handful of pastries to share with the office, it's always a pleasant occasion.\n\nI saw a biker stuffing about 30 pastries into his messenger bag once and it made my day. Buying pastries at Neighbor is delightful.\n\nThe staff is so friendly and Greg, the baker, once gave my coworker a free pastry when he inquired about the unlabeled kouign amann-ish pastry which I'm sure has now evolved into the ginger pull-apart after some iterations.\n\nAs a pistachio and blackberry lover, naturally I love the pistachio blackberry croissant. The chocolate claw and bostock are lovely too. My favorite thing to do is buy 3-5 pastries and share them all. Rarely is tasting a little bit of everything not the best option.\n\nAt Neighbor you don't feel that pretentious air as you might at Tartine, nor do you have to wait in absurdly long lines.

The bad thing is that I have to pre-order again and this time I have to double my order.  Parking is far, but I realize there is a space in front after I parked two blocks away.  It's a tiny place, line out the door, but movement is steady.  Have your choices ready, but with much being sold out in the afternoon, there really wasn't much for the undecided. This place is a winner.  I would have taken a picture of the pastries, but my stomach won out.  Pictures of crumbs just don't get much \"likes\".", "author": "Helen L."}

So yay for that. \n\nWe had:\n- The Everything Croissant - really nice, seedy, little swirl of cream cheese inside. for tartness \n- Cheddar/Sauerkraut pastry - good, nice flakey, was hoping the inside would be tastier.\n- Bostock Almond thang - THIS was awesome. Highly recommend. It had this delicious soft but moist bread and was unreal. \n- Ham and cheese morning bun -- this was supposed to be the same dough as the croissant.. but it was drier and not as buttery. \n\nCoffee was decent - a little small, as most hipster places go.\nNice little outdoor area with seating to hang out in on the sidewalk.

You order things as they're still sitting on the cooling racks.  \n\nLuckily, the line was only a few people deep at 8am on a Wednesday, and they do have coffee and tea.\n\nMost things are viennoiserie based. I clearly had a hard time choosing, so I got almost one of everything...\n\n- Butter croissant: it was a little less flaky than I was hoping for, but it looked beautiful, and I was eating it over 12 hours after it came out of the oven. It had just the right amount of sweetness and saltiness\n- Chocolate claw: kind of like a chocolate croissant\n- Pistachio twice baked croissant: I did not expect for a hint of marzipan (maybe honey pistachio paste?), but I loved itt. The crust on top reminds me of Chinese \"pineapple buns\", and the filling has blueberry to add some fruitiness without making it too sweet or tart. It sounded like a weird combination for a croissant but probably ended up being my favorite sweet thing\n- Everything croissant: a savory croissant with a topping that's like an \"everything bagel.\" It added lots of textures and flavors and was an interesting take on the croissant - I think I liked this more than the regular one\n- Mushroom tart: another wonderful savory pastry. There was a lot of mushroom, and the slightly sweet tart base was a nice contrast to the cheese and woody mushrooms. This was probably my favorite savory item\n- Ham and cheese morning bun: kind of like a ham and cheese croissant but better. The bun itself had the right amount of doughy sweetness without being actually sweet, and the nuts and seeds on top (similar to the everything croissant) added more texture. The ham and cheese were really good, and I wish there were more inside\n- Sauerkraut tart: I like sauerkraut, and I like cheese, but maybe not the two together? The tart base held up well and had good flavor, but the red peppers and sauerkraut were a little too tart and sort of abrasive?  Otherwise, the baked cheese topping was nice\n\nOK so maybe I went a little overboard with the ordering, but everything just looked so beautiful!  Each pasty is $3-4ish, but they're quite large, so it's nice to get a bunch and share with people. If you don't consume it immediately, everything is good if you re-heat it a bit in the oven.\n\nThere are parking spots out front, but those are reserved for the company next door, so you'll have to find street parking.

I guess it's too much for hipsters to be so authentic as to actually bake their pastries the same day.  \n\nSo to let's take a trip to hipster bakery shall we?\n\nWe get there an hour before they are suppose to close. The sign says they are open. I see the baker outside talking to some rich hipsters. We go and ask what pastries are still available. The barista's reply is what ever is out is what is available. OK. There is nothing on the counter but they are making some kind of weird oversized croissant. So we say we'll  take one of those. Surly barista tells us those aren't available, they are being baked for tomorrow. It's 11am and these are being baked for tomorrow? WTF? I'm confused and ask so you serve day old pastries, she explain oh we freeze so they are totally fine. Yeah cause what makes day old pastries even better is freezing them! I don't see anything else so we say so what you are saying is there are no more pastries left. Umm why the hell couldn't she just say that?

Surly barista replies we don't do that, whatever is out is what we have available. They look around a bit confused and I have to turn to them and say that they have no more pastries. One of the girls thinks I'm joking because she like most sane people assumes that the people that actually work there would say that.

Why didn't the layers rise? Didn't fold enough? Tried to bake with cream cheese inside? If you can't figure out how to get the layers with the cream cheese baked in, maybe you're better off baking sans cream cheese to get the layers, and then cutting open and stuffing with cream cheese.

I will wait in hour long lines to try a new place, bake at least weekly, and made a hobby out of visiting the best dessert places with a friend while living in Tokyo.  So I admit, I am a little critical.  With that said, I have to say neighbor bakehouse has the best best best croissant in the city.  Tartine is great, but can over bake theirs.  Boulange is still good, but can be on the bread-y side.  \n\nThese are the perfect, flaky, chewy, but crisp croissants that make me not embarrassed to say croissant with a correct French accent (or at least try).  We have tried everything and there really isn't a bad option.  It totally just depends on what you are feeling like.  The mustard in the ham and cheese morning bun is acidic enough to perfectly balance richness of the ham and cheese.  The chocolate croissant is a must.  The pistachio blackberry croissant is a really fun take on the twice baked croissants...\n\nI could go on, but all I would be doing is delaying you from going there and trying them for yourself.

I knew they had limited hours but just wanted to see the bakery (I used to be a baker so I'm kind of a bakery nerd). It was indeed closed but there was someone inside and she came to the door to greet us. Turns out it was Christine, one of the owners. She was so welcoming, invited us in, and offered us a couple of pastries and would not take our money. She said they would be donated anyway.\n\nI was totally blown away, not only by the friendly attitude but the pastries were delicious. I had some kind of a crumb topped muffin and my husband had a croissant.\n\nWill definitely make it a point to get up early and come by often.", "author": "Terry S."}

Ginger pull apart, pistachio blackberry croissant, and mushroom tart were all so amazing that I haven't been able to stray to anything else in the times I've gone back. What an awesome place, I wish I could work there so they would teach me their secrets.", "author": "Annie V."}

That gateway drug has lead me to try lots of their goods, but there's still a ton I've yet to sample. So glad that I can now go directly to the manufacturer!\n\nIt's a bit tricky to park in that part of the Dogpatch, but it's worth the effort, IMO.\n\nDe La Paz on tap, too! They are all SUPER nice there, too. No attitude.", "author": "Jon B."}

The delicious creation was a puff pastry with kale, goat cheese, butternut squash and sunflower seeds. Unreal. This place is 100% worth the trek. Great coffee too, yay for having almond milk!", "author": "Eliza D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-05", "description": "Excellent croissant - real croissant not the yucky crescent shaped bread that lots of places serve - these are the real deal! Buttery, flaky, yummy!\nMy 10 year old loves the chocolate claw. The ginger pull apart was great - very gingery, not sickly sweet. And we all liked the blackberry almond croissant. \n\nThey're open Wednesday thru Sunday 6:30am until noonish. And they do accept credit cards. And they now have outside seating.\n\nCoffee is good - but this is about the baked goods - you could always go across to Puccino and get a Sightglass coffee if you prefer.", "author": "Dean G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-02", "description": "So good it hurts. Hours are highly irregular. You can find their stuff in coffee houses in city, but it costs more than buying directly from them. Would not go here if you're in a hurry. Parking in area sucks but worth circling. Usually a long line, but sometimes I get lucky.  Croissants are perfect, flakey and buttery. Do not eat in your car! ha. Love their savory and sweet inventions. I try some new weird item whenever I can, but mainly get the everything croissant, with chive and cream cheese, and morning buns. OMG the ginger pull-apart, beautiful.

Good choice, James (patting self on back...). The goods (we got a chocolate croissant, the Manchego and Mushroom, and the Everything Croissant) were much better than good. Real neighborly vibe to the whole thing, and excellent coffee. It's a little bit out of my neighborhood, but I can make the trek at least once a week...Go now before they get famous and the line is still pretty short.", "author": "James P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-12", "description": "Yum yum yum! Their chocolate claw is to die for. The best I have ever had, seriously! It's crunchy and flaky on the outside with a decadent dark chocolate vein that seems to be in every bite. Ask for it to be warmed up and they throw it back in the oven for an even crispier, meltier version. I've also had their Almond & blueberry twice baked croissant (or something like that) that was incredibly good. I've never seen a croissant that was crispy on the outside and almost cake-like on the inside. Parking sucks around there so I always walk but their seating outside is a great touch! Wish they were open everyday!", "author": "Amy M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-04-17", "description": "If the pistachio-blackberry croissant is any indication, the goods are passable. Overly sweet pastry with a dominant flavor of almond paste which hides any taste of pistachio or blackberry. Also a hard place to stop if you're in a car. The watery coffee is probably the only item resembling a French pastry shop.", "author": "Tiziana P."}

This is not the case with Neighbor Bakery. This bakery is the real deal. It's hard to find the spot where talent and love for the craft converge so seamlessly, but they've accomplished that and with a big smile on their faces. Simple, unpretentious and outstandingly delicious. I will not go into the flavors, best to discover them on your own.

I was expecting way longer like B Patisserie. The ginger pull apart was amazing and a must get. Also got everything croissant, butter croissant, chocolate chocolate claw, pistachio blackberry twice baked croissant and a cookie. All were excellent.

The pastries and bread here just won't do anymore which bummed me out a bit since I love croissants for breakfast! That's when my friend suggested I try this place to soothe me until I can go to Europe again! OMG this bakery is life changing! Not only is EVERYTHING absolutely delicious (crunchy on the outside, just the way I like my pastries) everything is super fresh! I went in on my way to work to pick up a few things and the guy that was helping me said one of the items I wanted wasn't ready yet, then his coworker yelled from the back that he just pulled it out of the oven! It was still warm when I got to the office! MMMMMMMM The staff is also super friendly and oh so accommodating even taking the time to write down everything on the inside of the box so my coworkers would know what was what! My office fell in love with this place too! So far, I've been 3 times in one week! Only 3 cuz the weekend got in the way and they're closed Mondays and Tuesdays! But I'm looking forward to Wednesday when they open! I CAN'T WAIT! Btw, for all you Cubans....they have guava and cheese pastelitos here!
