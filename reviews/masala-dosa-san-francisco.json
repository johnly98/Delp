The Tikka Masala was terrible. Although the chicken was nice and tender, all of it was just way too salty. At one point, all I could taste was salt and had take sips of water in between bites. I'm not overly picky about food and would normally try to eat most of it but I couldn't stand eating any more. Due to my dissatisfaction, I decided to go back to the restaurant in hopes of exchanging it for something else. I went back to the restaurant and told the host/server my problem very politely. I never mentioned a refund. I just wanted to exchange. He seemed annoyed and called somebody else over for help. This new man must be a manager. I told him that I found the tikka masala way too salty and he was explaining how it's supposed to taste like that. I then asked if they taste test their food before serving and he said yes. I was shocked that they would approve of serving something so terribly salty. Anyways, he did let me exchange for something else and I choose the samosas because it seemed like a safe choice. The samosas were surprisingly good so I do recommend those.\n\nPros: Good portions, they let me exchange for something else, and the samosas were good\nCons: The tikka masala was terrible and I felt they were rude to me when I told them I was dissatisfied with my meal.", "author": "Amy Y."}

I was yelping for a place my friends and I could go for lunch after running Bay to Breakers and came across Masala Dosa. \n\nWe arrived around before noon and the place was pretty much empty. We were seated right away in the front where the window was. I ordered the samosa and seek kebab dosa (spicy ground beef filling). The samosa appetizer came with two pieces. It had a nice crispy exterior but the filling was bland. The dosa was pretty good though.\n\nFor a party of 9, the food didn't take too long to come out. Service was pretty spotty. With an empty restaurant, I figured it would be easier to get our server's attention. Unfortunately, he was out in the back kitchen most of the time and was hard to flag down.\n\nWhen it was time to pay our bill, our server informed us he was having issues with his credit card reader that day and asked if we could pay cash.

Their menu is extensive, with lots of curries - how do 8 kinds of lamb curry and 11 naan choices sound? Next time I want to try the goat cheese or spiced ground lamb naan! \n\nDarkish, unassuming interior with gentle, relaxing music. The unisex bathroom was clean. Delivery is free for a pretax minimum of $25. \n\nOne needed improvement though is service. When we walked in, after 2 pm on a Saturday, no one greeted us.

The naan tasted like it had been reheated from the day before because it was incredibly chewy and stale. It was difficult for me to tear off a piece. The bottom was also burned. I think this could only be because it was cooked twice. I also didn't taste any basil like advertised. The chicken tikka masala was also overly salted, the amount of salt they used burned my mouth and throat. The yogurt had also begun to curdle, I think that's why they used so much salt, to cover up the spoiling yogurt. My stomach is also beginning to hurt while writing this. They are also skimpy on the chicken, only 6 pieces to be exact. There should be more for the hefty price of $15. After spending a total of $40.39, I feel completely ripped off.

Been getting a lot of random and nasty messages from business owners and other reviewers who have nothing to do with me, which makes my faith in humanity die a little.\n\nAnyway.\n\nSomeone who I think is affiliated with Masala Dosa sent me the following message:\n\n\"we don't use MSG.Don't speculate about our restaurant. Get yourself checked from a doctor before eat out.\"\n\nSo I'm updating my review to get the story straight: Masala Dosa does NOT use MSG so that should never be a reason why you don't go there. Some good reasons not to go: their people send me rude messages, their service is slow, their food made me (and my husband!) feel terrible after eating. Guess we both need to see a doctor even though we both eat out plenty and the only shared variable here is eating at Masala Dosa? Hmmm.\n\nI absolutely agree that I shouldn't speculate about the restaurant and should only report what I experienced, which is now described above. However, I don't appreciate whoever messaged me to speculate about my health.

This is not your ordinary cafeteria style/buffet restaurant. I love those types of Indian restaurants for the sake of affordable prices and a full stomach. However, sometimes you just wanna treat yourself! At about $20 a person, my boyfriend and I had a delicious meal that included: Tandoori Chicken, Prawn Tikka Masala, Naan, Basmati Rice, and Chai Tea. Not to mention, a bottle of CAB SAV free of corkage fee! Yes, you heard it right! No corkage fee! (A rarity in San Francisco restaurants.) \n\nThe Tandoori Chicken is served on a piping hot plate with green peppers and onions sizzling away. It's gotta be one of the best Tandoori Chicken dishes I've ever had! This is a must try for all you chicken lovers out there! \n\nPrawn Tikka Masala was flavorful and was not overbearingly spicy. Smother that curry sauce over the rice and you got yourself, heaven in your mouth. (Shout out to Stephen Curry! Go Warriors! #WeBelieveChampionship2015. I'm going off tangent, but the Bay Area is just on this Warriors high that there are so many Indian curry references to Steph Curry. I just had to say it!) \n\nNaan was where I took one star off. I ordered the Garlic Naan and was expecting a fluffy, doughy, and flavorfully (hehehe -__-) side of bread. However, I barely tasted the garlic, the bottom had a burnt hue, and it was crisp thin. It's a bit surprising, because the last time I ordered their special, Naan filled with goat cheese and cranberry sauce which by the way was amazing, was fluffy, doughy, and flavorfully. It wasn't a deal breaker, but I think I'll pass on ordering the Garlic Naan next time. \n\nMoving on, I just wanted to point out that the promotional video on their Yelp page was personal and heartfelt. (Click play if you haven't already!) I definitely sensed the family oriented aura that filled the room. The customer service is spot and they really care that you have the best experience when dining at their restaurant. Going along with their value of family, the women's bathroom has a baby changing table! Not that many restaurants offer this!

But, the steep prices are validated: Masala Dosa is staged as a higher-end Indian restaurant than Curry Village or Naan N' Curry, so, adjust your expectations accordingly.\n\n(PASS ON THE) $6 EGGPLANT PAKORA: fresh eggplant dipped in chick pea batter and fried (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/masala-dosa-san-francisco?select=DJUKjAUgUbAZnjxp6gxe-A#DJUKjAUgUbAZnjxp6gxe-A)\n- This dish ain't my piece o' cake. It's like the Indian version of tempura, except the chick pea batter isn't fried to a crisp, which leaves the pakora somewhat soggy. Add that to the flavorless nature of eggplant, and you're left with something mushily tasteless. Albeit, the mint chutney and sweet tamarind sauces are delicious and are meant to deliver a large component of flavor, but then I might as well just lap up those bowls of sauce. As if I don't already do that, haaaa. Shhhhhh.\n\n(OMG YOU BETTER GET THE) $13 CHICKEN KORMA: tandoori chicken cooked in a clay oven stewed in a cashew cream sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/masala-dosa-san-francisco?select=3cMzA8dlGFoRpmONh_ymOQ#3cMzA8dlGFoRpmONh_ymOQ)\n- Ridic delish. You should order this. And then, you should order this again. Yes, $13 is a bit of moolah for a dish that's usually less than $10, but just play some mind games and tell yourself it's $12.99 instead.\n- The bowl is small. Well, that's probably a mind game too. I bet it's actually the same size since the food is served in a normal bowl rather than those typical flat saucer dishes. Despite the small bowl, there's a heckuva lot of tandoori chicken chunks--I would say 8 or 9. And that beautifully moist chicken is what makes this dish addictive. This is most definitely the moistest chicken I've ever had in an Indian dish. And it doesn't help that the cashew cream sauce is liquid crack.\n\n(IF YOU WANNA, GET THE) $12 CHICKEN MASALA DOSA (dosas not available through online ordering): thin crepe with potatoes and chicken (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/masala-dosa-san-francisco?select=jYk3XRjZMohJGoKUUav3kg#T4Wfxp2FcovJNI19V75K7g)\n- The crepe is huge--3/4 the length of my entire arm huge--with a thin layer of chicken masala spread on it. It's served with sambar (a comforting chickpea soup spiced with tamarind) and chutneys (the cilantro-cucumber one was intriguing), as well as a small dish of tikka masala sauce (tomatoes, garlic, and Indian spices). Geez, that tikka masala sauce is bomb, so much so that I asked for a second serving (the server recommended it a bit warmed for more impactful flavor). Slurpity slurp slurp.\n- I can't quite figure out why the chicken in the dosa isn't as juicy as the chicken in the korma, since both use tandoori chicken. My guess is that the chicken in the korma is stewed in the cream sauce, which maintains moisture better.\n\n(PROBS SHOULD HAVE SOME) $3 GARLIC BASIL NAAN: baked bread with garlic and basil (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/masala-dosa-san-francisco?select=3cMzA8dlGFoRpmONh_ymOQ#pi0Mr3dLe0k3kh52SDwP3w)\n- The naan here is thin crust pizza-esque rather than fluffy, which lends more of a crunch. Enjoyed the generous seasoning.\n\nMy recommendation: skip everything else on their menu and hone in on just the chicken korma. That frickin' addictin' chicken korma.", "author": "Adele F."}

So I've never had a dosa, but the restaurant has dosa in the name, so I thought I'd try it. It should be good right? Huge mistake! I'm not sure if they're supposed to be eaten right away, so delivery probably did the dish an injustice, but it was a floppy mushy mess. The crepe got steamed in the packaging so it was really mushy. Plus the crepe to filling ratio was off. I just didn't enjoy this dish at all.\n\nThe rest of the dishes were okay. Good and bad points to all. I guess my main complaint was flavor and spice. I liked the two vindaloos we had, but they both could have benefited from a little more spice. The biryani and tikka masala were both kind of bland and lacking in the extra punch of flavor to make them great!\n\nAll in all an okay meal. But I'm definitely going to have to try a dosa again.

We ordered lamb rogan josh, chicken tikka masala and vegetable biryani. Chicken tikka masala was pieces of chicken (not thoroughly cooked) floating in a very thin masala. Very flavorless. The lamb dish was not impressive at all. The biryani was the highlight of the orders and thank god the portion was enough for 3 of us. Service was inattentive. He forgot a spoon and put a tea spoon in the rice dish! (How am i supposed to serve rice with a teaspoon? Maybe a good tool to control your carb intake). We had to ask for water each time and even though there were 2 tables filled at the time- he got us a doggies bag (which was actually for the table next to us).", "author": "Megan K."}

I reluctantly came to Masala Dosa with my sister, believnig that I would never like Indian food. \n\nHere comes my epiphany! Masala Dosa was a gem! I was feeling adventurous, so I ordered a chai tea. It looked very creamy, and I added a pack of sugar. The chai was A-MAZING. It was light and smooth, with a hint of chai, but not too sweet and sugary -- not like those chai lattes you get from Starbucks. All chai teas should taste like the ones from Masala.\n\nMy sister was set on ordering the Chicken Tikka Masala and garlic naan, so I decided to be adventurous again and we ordered the Baigan Bharta -- fresh mesquite eggplant with ginger, garlic and spices. The eggplant went well with the naan, and I could taste the ginger and garlic, but it wasn't overwhelming either. The chicken in the tikka masala was so tender, a stark contrast from the tough chicken I had to chew and swallow from the chicken tikka masala at House of Curries. \n\nThough the portions looked small, three items was filling for three people. If you are eating with someone else, I recommend ordering 3 items if you are very hungry, and 2 items if you're not as hungry. The chai tea is a must!\n\nOverall, I was impressed with Masala, so this place will be my new favorite for now.", "author": "Joanne K."}

Food was overcooked, drastically underspiced and overpriced.  Service untrained and unresponsive. \n\nDespite the name 'Masala,' there was little spice, almost no salt, and conspicuously absent chilis in the flavoring of the dishes. Portion sizes very small, though with such poor-quality preparation, it was just as well.  We arrived hungry and left much of what we'd ordered on the table. \n\nThis seems to be a delivery service with a nearly-empty restaurant. There were intermittent long waits for food because the kitchen was doing a busy delivery business.\n\nWe joined a party in progress - two of us had arrived 30 minutes early, so they had ordered some appetizers - and then waited 15 minutes after arrival to get menus, and then waited about 20 more minutes for the 'waiter' to take our order.  'Waiter' because the young man waiting on us seemed completely inexperienced at serving, delivering dishes, answering questions, etc.  Once he arrived with a dish, he'd disappear into the back, or lounge at the hostess stand.\n\nOnion naan was dry to the point of being less edible than the cardboard that it resembled. I've never had bad naan in a restaurant, and this seemed stale, as if it had been sitting out overnight rather than cooked to order. It was essentially snapping-stale flatbread painted with turmeric, no oil, and apparently dried scallions.  Hungry as I was, I couldn't eat more than a few bites.\n\nThe 'Maysore' (not 'Mysore') dosa was drastically overcooked, with the outer 4\" of the wrapper the color of burnt toast.  Though I'd ordered it extra spicy, a two-year-old could have eaten the sparse potato filling without a whimper.\n\nBhindi (okra) curry was underseasoned, with sparse, stale spices and no fire whatsoever.The bhindi themselves were al dente, and dripping with ghee.\n\nSalmon curry was OK, though like everything, completely devoid of heat, but I doubt very much that at that price point it was really wild salmon, as listed on the menu. Tasted and looked like decent farmed salmon.\n\nSambar was so underspiced that it indeed seemed, as noted by another reviewer, to be more dhal than sambar.\n\nPickles and chutneys were fine. \n\nOur hapless waiter had to be nudged for any attention that we needed - more chai, menus, etc.  Between our arrival  and the appearance of our food, they ran out of chai and we had to remind him after 30 minutes that we still had not received the requested refill.", "author": "Shoshi D."}

It does warn you on the menu that it's spicy (you are chili-pepper warned!) but we thought it would be a kind of medium spicy, NO. IT'S VERY SPICY. Trust in that little chili-pepper.

I love indian food and this place is mainly jump started my love for it. It has one of the best tikka masala in the city and I love their garlic naan. The price range is about the same with other Indian food places ($12-$15) but it's well worth it. I usually have to have left overs which equates to my lunch or dinner for the next day. The parking is difficult to find on this street so I would suggest parking on a nearby residence parking and walking. Plus once you're done you can go to Holy Gelato , which is across the street (See My Holy Gelato Review). It's a pretty good date night place :).", "author": "Desiree C."}

I stumbled upon this place a couple years ago and have always been impressed. The service is attentive, the food delicious and reasonably priced. I think I'm most obsessed with their naan, with so many delicious options, with the Kabuli naan being a favorite. Yesterday after my latest dining visit, I ordered their special of the day naan to go: cinnamon cranberry goat cheese, and eating it now for breakfast reminded me that I must Yelp them. Chicken tikka masala, lamb korma, their samosas, etc. etc... all delicious...I could go on and on. Seriously, try this place.

It was like they cooked (over cooked, rather) some chicken and then poured some tikka masala sauce over the chicken. \nProbably won't be back.

The first time I went I was very impressed at the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant. There's are large windows facing 9th Street that really opens up the restaurant. Its the best restaurant in the Inner Sunset for taking in the beauty and charm of the neighborhood. \n\nWhen I finally tasted the food I was absolutely blown away. Everything on the menu tastes like a home cooked meal by a gourmet chef. The flavors really come through and are not covered up with cream and fat like a lot of other places. At Masala Dosa everything tastes so fresh and light which is amazing because you don't feel guilty about eating even more than usual. And after talking to the employees there they definitely make it a point to be healthier than other places, staying away from the cop out appeal of pure fat. \n\nThere are so many scrumptious options to choose from from northern and southern India making Masala Dosa much more diverse than your average Indian restaurant. My favorites range from the Palak (Lamb or Mushroom), Chicken Tikka Masala, Chana Masala, Pakora and Fish Vindaloo. Even the breads are phenomenal. The Bhatura, Onion Naan and Goat Cheese Naan are out of this world. I always end up ordering half a dozen items (it helps that their prices are affordable) when I go or pick up from here and they always accommodate me with fast and friendly service.  Also the entire staff is very knowledgeable about the food  which always enhances the experience, learning the history and heritage of the dishes you're enjoying.", "author": "Dexter H."}

The tikka masala sauce was good, but the chicken within it was very bland, and tasted a little stale. The saag paneer and samosas were good. Also, the waiter didn't ask us how spicy we like it (we like it flaming)...kind of basic service for an Indian restaurant.

And I will be the first to admit that finding good south Indian food is harder then hard. Being Indian I've had my fair share of Indian food within the states and out side of the states, yes I do mean in India, but also other countries, and they have their menu down to a science. \n\nMy favorite to get is always Masala Dosa but Ive been enough times to taste their curries, naans, appetizers and Uthapam. Their whole menu is made with a perfect balance of spices, oils, and meats/veggies. The biggest treat for me is not seeing a giant film of oil floating on top of any of their curries or sambars. Why? Because it lets me know that the cooks are in tune to their food and not just tossing everything in without a care. Another major plus is that everything doesn't taste the same... Curries should not have the same tastes, nor should the Dosa's, Uthapam or any other item on the menu. When I get two curries that are true to their taste I know Ive found an Indian restaurant I'll be addicted to. \n\nBesides the food though, the service is really friendly. Everytime I go in there is always someone ready to seat me and take my order. And when I go with friends who arent so Indian food saavy, the waiters take their time to explain what each dish is and what it will pair well with. On another note the area is great for a bit of mellow night life. BUT parking is impossible, dont bother driving, take the N train in or one of the many MUNI buses that stop through there. \n\nP.S.

Though, sometimes it can be hard to tell how good the options will be. I found a review for Masala Dosa that referred to a gluten-free menu, so I thought there must be something good there for me. Sure enough, the dosa section of the menu noted that all dosas were gluten free except for one kind. Fun! I had options!\n\nOften times in restaurants where the owners and waitstaff do not speak English fluently, I have a hard time inquiring about whether the food is really gluten-free. With a lack of public knowledge of gluten-free issues, plus a language barrier, it can be hard to get the reassurance I need. I asked the waiter, a very nice guy with an accent, about whether any meats were prepared with flour, or if there was any flour added to the sauce. He said no, but he seemed to understand the importance of the questions, and said he would double check with the chef. He came back confirming that all the curries were gluten-free - no flour on the meat or in the sauce. Since I didn't get to talk to the chef, I have no idea if they really \"got it.\" I can only trust that the waiter conveyed the importance.\n\nMy friend and I shared a masala dosa with chutney and a spinach and chicken curry.

The curries come in a little bowl and don't come with any rice or naan, so you have to order your own naan. The naans were delicious; I would recommend the garlic and cilantro naans. You get 4 triangles of naan which are more than enough for one person. \n\nI had the tandoori chicken which was flavorful, but I think paying $10 for two chicken thighs is a little overpriced. My chicken curry had no spicy kick to it and tasted pretty plain. The chicken curry that came with vegetables in it was even less flavorful probably due to the vegetables watering the curry down.", "author": "Sophia L."}

These took forever to come out.\n\nYou get ONE piece of naan for $3+. The waiter actually laughed at me when I asked for an order of naan for the table (of three). Sorry, you don't laugh at your customers. Rude.\n\nThe Bhindi Masala (okra etc) I ordered came with stems still in it. I mean, I like fiber, but I also like to be able to chew and swallow it.\n\nThe chicken tikka masala and chicken Korma were plenty good.\n\nAll of the portions are medium-small. Not quite small, but definitely enough for one person. We split three dishes family-style.\n\nNow let's get back to the service..\nWhen we arrived there (2pm on a Tuesday) there was only one other couple seated inside. This is fine to me, it was after the lunch rush in the Inner Sunset. I don't expect it to be packed.\nShortly after we got there, the other table left.\nThis is when the waiter just plain ignored us. He was sitting in the front playing with his phone.\n\nWe had to get his attention when we needed water refills, and even when we needed the check.\n\nAfter he brought the check, without asking if we were finished with our food, he started clearing the table. My friend was clearly not finished, accentuated by the fact that he yanked the last piece of Naan off the plate as the waiter was picking it up. Then the waiter took the bowl of curry sauce right as my friend was about to dip the naan into it.\n\nWe were all shocked.\nI do not think I will ever go back.\n\nEdit:\nI forgot to mention that the waiter also \"forgot\" to add into the total the charge for 2-garlic naans, so he threw it in the \"tax\" field on the paper slip. He didn't even CHARGE us tax. \nThis waiter apparently had an issue with speaking to people, as well. Everything he said came out very quiet and mumbled. His English was perfectly fine, if only I could hear him when he was answering my questions about the bill.\n\n$38 EVEN for 3 dishes, 1 appetizer, 2 orders of naan.

Yea-uh!\n\nI've come here twice but wanted to go back immediately after the first night. Each time I've come, it's been empty but fills up as it gets later. You know what they say, the night is young, but I am not.\n\nDecor: Dim. You can either take this as romantic or just dark. I like that the tables are dark wood and the stuff on it is simple and minimal.\n\nService: They seem to have one main guy who knows a lot and at most 2 other waiters. Since I go when the night is young, they have nothing else to do but wait on me.\n\nFood: \n- I CRAVED naan the first time so I had both the regular and garlic naan. Garlic lovers should definitely get the garlic naan. It is so powerful vampires would die. For me, I prefer the regular naan to dip with the curries. Mmmm naan.\n\n-Samosas: 2 big ones for each order. I like that there's a kick in it but it's not overly spicy. \n\n- I asked the main dude what he prefers and he went through the WHOLE menu section by section saying what he liked in each. It almost sounded like everything but I don't blame him b/c it's all pretty good. Overall, I love the paneer tikka masala. It's cheese only but they make it themselves, which is pretty impressive! There's a slightly sweet taste to it as well. I've also tried one of their chicken curries and a spinach one (which isn't as bad as you'd think), but I always go back to the cheese one. Cheeeeeeeeeeeese. All curries come with their special rice. The secret to their rice (besides the spices)? Butter. Thanks Paula Deen!\n\nPrice: Definitely affordable! For 1 order of naan, 1 order of samosas, and 2 curries, the total cost was about $26.

While there are many Indian restaurants in the sunset, none are south Indian. 3. Also unlike the other Indian restaurants in the neighborhood this one has a nice calm modern atmosphere-- does not make you feel like you are dining at a roadside truck stop in New Delhi. 4. The prices are so so reasonable compared to  trendy (and awesome) Dosa in the Mission. And 5. The food is very very good! \n\nPlease note: they don't serve alcohol but I saw some other tables had brought their own. \n\nAlso please note:The staff is new and the place is figuring out it's rhythm -- we had to wait a while for our chai refill and then had to just forget about it  because our baby was getting antsy.

This was the only thing my friend and I did not finish.\nChicken Tikka Masala: I thought the sauce was flavorful and the chicken was juicy. It wasn't the best food I've ever tasted but it was definitely good. My friend however noted that she's had better elsewhere. \nBasmati Rice: Is basmati rice supposed to have a crunchy texture? I wasn't sure but it felt like the rice was undercooked.\n\nPrice: My friend and I shared and it was only about $10 between the two of us. The portions were just enough to fill the both of us.

Now, I really love garlic, so my idea of \"just right\" might be \"Hell no\" to someone else. Keep that in mind. Luckily, they have an assortment of breads to choose from--including onion, goat cheese, and aloo (potato-stuffed) naan. \n\nThe paneer is served with the most delicious, creamy, full-bodied sauce ever.

We got there around 6:15 and by 7 it was jam packed. Had to wait a bit for our food so for the short term I wouldn't go there super hungry waiting to eat IMMEDIATELY.

I did a Yelp search for Indian food and found Masala Dosa.\n\nNote:  The last time I had a craving for Indian food, we went to Naan n Curry and I had a grumbly stomach for DAYS afterward.  We decided we'd cool it on the extra spicy foods and see if I'd have a better experience this time.\n\nWe walked over to Masala Dosa and were greeted by the man at the front (I noticed each employee didn't really have one specific duty.  They could be the host/hostess, server, table clearer - basically, whatever was needed.)  We had the option of being seated at a table further in the restaurant or wait for them to clean one of the window seats.  I opted for waiting for the window seat.  It's bright & airy and under this canopy of curtains.  The rest of the restaurant was darker and had a more romantic feel to it.\n\nWe ordered the Garlic Naan, Chicken Vindaloo, and Lamb Tikka Masala.  I also had the Mango Lassi and A had the Lemon Ginger Tea.  Oh yes, and we decided to order a Dosa!  We'd never had a dosa before, so thought we'd give it a try.  I can't remember which one we ordered though.  It was a gigantasaur triangle filled with meat & veggies and came with three dipping sauces/soup.  Definitely yummy, but too big for us to finish with everything else we ordered.\n\nThe naan was tasty and comes with 4 pieces.  Good to dip in the dosa sauces or the sauces for the Vindaloo or Tikka Masala.  I liked the Lamb Tikka Masala.  Creamy sauce, very flavorful, and not too spicy.  The Chicken Vindaloo was really good, but too spicy for me.  I just had a couple pieces of the chicken and let A eat the rest of that.\n\nThe service was excellent.  They kept coming to check on us and make sure we were doing okay.

The chicken tikka masala was medium spicy just as ordered and very hearty, with nice big chunks of chicken.  The baigan bharta was amazing, with a wonderful smoky taste.  The garlic naan was big and flavorful.  \n\nThe only issue was that it took them nearly an hour to deliver our food.  The online ordering system said it would take 45-60 minutes, so it wasn't a surprise, I guess, but it seems like they could get the food here faster.  So don't wait until you're starving to order.

I guess I don't mind having lots of Indian options in the neighborhood, but it does take some strategy and guts to open a restaurant that will compete with others that have established a steady cliente over the years.\n\nMasala Dosa got at least two things right: more upscale ambiance and trendy South Indian dishes like dosa.  The place looks way more roomier than the old Indian restaurant, with sleek dark interior and dim lighting.  The two tables near the window look so cozy and inviting.  \n\nBesides dosas and uttapams, they do have classic Indian dishes like tandoor chicken, naans, etc.  The four of us split a tandoor chicken, palak paneer, masala dosa, regular naan, and garlic naan.  Plenty of food, especially since we got the full order of chicken instead of half.\n\nDosa isn't as good as Dosa's, unfortunately, and palak paneer is slightly bland and too creamy in texture to tell that it's spinach.  Naans were good.  Tandoor chicken was pretty awesome!  Totally juicy, not dry at all, and has that nice tandoor aroma and wonderful flavors.  \n\nService is really friendly and warm.

Curry Village is decent, but I was hoping to see Masala Dosa really up the bar for Indian in the Inner Sunset.\n\nThe Good\n\nSadly, there are some major issues with the food. First the good, though. Excellent service. The waiter was super attentive but never overbearing, very helpful, there when I wanted him, not there when I didn't. That was great.\n\nThey cook carbs well. The rice was fluffy and wonderfully seasoned, and the onion naan was incredibly flavorful with a delicious wood-fire smell to it (although a touch on the dense side for naan). Maybe I should have got the dosas, since that's a carb and it's in the name of the place after all. But I didn't, I went with some my favorites.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe Bhindi Masala (okra) and Lamb Vindaloo I ordered were poorly done on two levels: (1) cooked unevenly/carelessly, and (2) poorly seasoned.\n\n(1) Some of the okra was underdone and really tough, other bits nice and tender. Similarly with the lamb, some pieces were dry and tough and others were quite moist. The only way you screw that up is by not paying attention in the kitchen, or by combining uncooked food with pre-cooked food in the same frying pan.\n\n(2) Both spice mixes fell flat. They were obviously not fresh spices, which in this day and age is really inexcusable. No Indian restaurant in San Francisco should be using pre-ground spices, they should be making their mixes from scratch every morning. The vindaloo in particular had a flavor of stale paprika that was really unpleasant. And it wasn't spicy in the least, which was quite disappointing.\n\nSo anyway, Curry Village still wins on flavor, even though they put too much sugar into their food and they're too pushy about the buffet. I'll probably go back to Masala Dosa and try the Dosas or the Uthappams, but for straight-up chunks-of-food-in-sauce-style Indian, I'll go elsewhere.", "author": "Aaron G."}

First of all, it's a fun place to be.  They really did a good job with the decor, which would be less remarkable if it weren't replacing Tasty Curry, which, while completely edible, was sometimes a sad place to be.  (Anybody ever go there for the lunch buffet on a weekday?  No?  That's what I thought.)  The same space looks absolutely beautiful now that Masala Dosa got their hands on it.  It's a very dark space, but very elegant.  It's not too cool for school, though - Masala Dosa is a great place to take a date, but I've also seen whole families, with babies in tow, chow down together.\n\nAnd chow down they should, because Masala Dosa's food is some of the tastiest around.  I will admit I had never had a dosa before, so my opinion of that might not be terribly useful to you all.  But I liked it!  We had the egg dosa, which was just the right amount of eggy and crepey.  We also had the idly, which are dense little suckers!  The texture is so homey and warm and filling - and they're served with delicious chutneys!  But what I really go for are the classics, which I've had many places and which are better here than those other places, for the most part.  Their shrimp vindaloo is a really great heat level.  I fear they may have been holding back because I'm small and female (but mighty!), but I really found the heat to be really well balanced.  I didn't need to take a break every bite, but it got my nose running, and that's good enough for me.  I've also had their okra and their baingan bhartha, which were out of this world.  The veggies were tender, the sauce was flavorful without being too salty, and the whole thing tasted pretty amazing with a big hunk of garlic naan.  (I smell lovely every time I eat there, by the way.)  Heck, even their rice is more delicious than average!\n\nThe service is also exceptionally friendly.  Perhaps it's because it's a new place, but Masala Dosa is just a cheery place to be, where everybody takes really good care of you.  If they keep this up, the other places around aren't even going to stand a chance!", "author": "Becca S."}

I took my parents here, who eat Jain food (which is a combination of vegetarian and no root vegetables (no onions, potatoes, garlic, ginger, carrots, beets, etc.)).  The cooks made a great sambar to go with the dosa and were suggesting many vegetable dishes they can do as well.  \n\nBeing a big fan of south indian food, I can compare them to the other south indian restaurants in the city and the peninsula/east bay, and they are easily in the top tier.  Their idlis, utthapam, and dosas are delicious.  Their sambar is perfectly spiced and their chutneys are mouth-watering...perfect complements to the main dishes.\n\nFinally, their service is top-notch.  This restaurant is great!", "author": "Nilesh B."}

The sauce was creamy and flavorful, not overly peppery but still had appropriate amounts of heat.  The chicken pieces were chunks of breast meat, obviously of good quality, moist and tender, with no appreciable fat or gristle (a whole different world from the grade D swill they put in the CTM at Naan n Curry). \n\nAs for the atmosphere, the interior of the restaurant was nicely decorated.

We came and ordered a chicken masala dosa and a spicy gobi uttapam and a side of chicken tikka masala. I had to order the CTM because it's a standard at most indian places and I wanted to see if Masala Dosa's was any good. Of course, if you're going to a restaurant that has the word Dosa in it, you should probably stick to the South Indian options. The CTM was good, but even after asking for it extra spicy it lacked any spice at all. The spicy Gobi Uttapam was amazing. It came out piping hot with sambar and two chutneys. To top it off, it was actually really big. The sambar was also very good, it was really spicy and definitely catered to my love for hot food. I tried a little bit of the chicken masala dosa, which was basically a dosa stuffed with tandoori chicken pieces, potatoes, and peas. The dosa was made well, but the stuffing was flavorless, definitely not like the masala dosa stuffing at Dosa on Fillmore.

These places have led me to believe that all Indian food in SF is terrible and I never, ever eat Indian food in this city outside of when my mother visits.  \nWhen my 3-year old commanded me to eat at Masala Dosa today, I was understandably worried.  South Indian food?  That's harder to get right than North Indian food!\nWell, we started with Idli w/ sambar, samosas mango lassi, chai and then had a masala dosa and finished with some gulab jamun.  \nHoly crap!  This food is good!  The idli wasn't the absolute best, but the sambar was really tasty (and spicy!).  Samosas had actual flavor in the potatoes and the chutney was tasty too.  The Chai? well, a little too milky for my tastes and the refill never came, but pretty good nonetheless.  The mango lassi I didn't get to try as my 3-year old wouldn't part with it (which I take to mean it was good too).  The dosa was very good too, though the chutneys with the dosa were nowhere near as tasty as other great South Indian places in the South Bay.  Did I mention the sambar was really tasty?  Well, it was.  The gulab jamun was likewise really good.  Oh, and I took some takeout home too (paneer tikka masala) and it was pretty good too.\n\nThe service wasn't the best, but last I checked, I don't eat service.  \nI like this place so much that I am even gonna take my parents there in a couple of weeks when they visit.

It was fairly quiet when we went in and we were so happy with the gluten free options there. Unfortunately we couldnt try the naan or samosas, but the Dosas are a great substitute. We loved the chickpeas, mango lassi, and chicken tikka.  We asked for all of the dishes to be extra spicy.  If you truly like it spicy you really have to have them understand you want spice.  We did find that the food was tasty- unlike other reviewers, it didnt seem bland to us.", "author": "N A."}

Decided to try Masala Dosa and it was excellent.  It's the best chicken korma I have eaten.  If ordering to go, make sure you order before going because it takes half an hour.  Phone number in Yelp for Masala Dosa is also incorrect.", "author": "Mary L."}

I was very pleasantly surprised.  The place looks great and the food was really good.  We hada pretty small dinner, but the veggie jalfrezi was super and garlic nan was perfect.  Tandori chicken was also perfect.  I miss the old place, but I'll be happy to come back to this spot.", "author": "Dennis M."}

How disappointing that this restaurant served the worst South Indian food ever. I ordered the seekh kabob dosa and my wife ordered the idli appetizer. Bogh dishes came with sambal which tasted like solid salt and was totally inedible. The idli was also too salty to eat. We told the waiter and he brought me some newly made sambal which was ok. The seekh kabob dosa was fine but not special. The  waiter never brought any freshly made sambal or idli for my wife. After waiting another half an hour we asked when her meal would be coming and were told that nothing was coming. She had never been told they were not preparing something for her or asked if she wanted to order something else. So after being in the restaurant for over a hour, we left. The waiter did not seem to understand that someone sitting there with no food was not ok.", "author": "Suzanne H."}

But all is well.  The new place is uphill and upscale.  The old one had a crowded dining room and a patio nobody seemed to use; this version has a spacious and elegant room.  If Curry Village across the way is for large hungry groups, Masala Dosa is a date night restaurant, where you would not feel out of place in a suit or cocktail dress (though they don't serve alcohol).  Not that they have an actual dress code, with Craigslist next door that would not be a good idea, since the scruffy Indian guy next to you is probably a software engineer if not a UCSF med student.  And they happily seated two women in the window.  OK, the food.  Said friend is from Kerala, makes great dosas herself, and considers the food here both tops and authentic.  The dosas are like crepes or a wrap, with various meat or veggie fillings.  The uttapams are made from the same chickpea/rice flour base (gluten-free), but with the fillings baked on top - some people call them an Indian pizza, but don't mistake that for anything like what a couple of Sunset restaurants serve as \"Indian Pizza\".  There are also various biryani and curry dishes, plus appetizers such as iddly, which looks like a large marshmellow, and which is used like a chip for dipping.  I really like the chicken biryani, and am disappointed that one dish to have disappeared is the veggie Kashmiri Biryani, with dried fruits & nuts.  But it was North Indian, so it didn't make the cut.  As with most Indian restaurants, desserts are not much. Sometime maybe I'll order a plain dosa with the mango ice cream and see how that goes as a dessert crepe.  The chai is made fresh by the cup, and with a strong ginger flavor.  It was an enjoyable meal as always, and we will both be back.", "author": "Pat L."}

I had Salmon Tandoori, which was my favorite and prawn vindaloo. Next time I am going for the lamb, but was with a non lamb eater so I will save it for my next visit. I have eaten at a few Indian places in SF and this is my go to from now on. Be advised, they don't have a liquor license, but bring your own and all is well.", "author": "Sara W."}

Nice new decor, and 2 lovely seats right in the window so you can people watch while you enjoy your tasty meal. The owners and their staff are super friendly and are really looking to please, especially since this is a new venture for them. They also currently own Masala down the street, but apparently this menu has much more of a South Indian flavor to it, so I think they're trying out a lot of different recipes than they offered at Masala. I'm a novice to Indian food, but I was excited to see that the first few dosas on the menu are gluten-free- which unfortunately is now  my diet. I had the Masala Dosa and it was fantastic! I'll definitely be going back, and crossing my fingers that the window seat is open again.", "author": "Brandi C."}
