During my second visit, we ordered pok\u00e9 and it was something I would totally order again except I wish they gave some more chips to eat it with! \n\nI visited on a Monday night with my friend right at opening and we were able to sit at a table right by the window.

I can see why they call it \"The View Lounge\" This place is packed, a lot of the crowd are often business people probably staying at the Marriot hotel. The day we went, the place was so crowded, I honestly felt like a sardine in a can.

Since we were headed to the airport a hotel lounge made sense because we wouldn't look all that out of place with luggage. We found couch seating in the corner near the entrance with plenty of space for our bags, and our hostess was great about getting us menus and starting us a tab. I don't typically order much other than a glass of wine or a vodka soda, but the atmosphere here made me feel like I needed something fancier in a fun glass, so I ordered a cosmopolitan. SO good. I have to be honest I'm not sure I've had a cosmo since college when we used to buy the bucket of mix for movie night in the dorms, so I had no idea how good an appreciated a well made one would be. I ended up ordering a second. \n\nI would say the inside atmosphere and the window that displays the view is a little more impressive than the actual view itself, but not disappointing by any means. There were plenty of food options, but we just shared some chips and dip, which were delicious. Drinks were a little pricey in my mind, but given the city and the hotel lounge with a view it was probably par for the course.", "author": "Jessica G."}

That window looks straight out of a fantasy story, like one hiding magic on the other side.  But what you get to find out is that the magic is right there, inside the bar.\n\nWe went on a Friday night, late. They had just did the \"last call\".  I was still able to see the window and the view, but I wanted more.  \nFirst reason why they get a good review...  they immediately apologized for the inconvenience (even though it was us who got there late) and proceeded to recommend other places for us to go, all walking distance.  And asked us to please come another day.\n\nAs luck would have it, we did have time to stop by again on Sunday afternoon before our flight.  We were there, with all our luggage, but managed to get a spot, right at the entrance.  They have so sofas and our luggage fit perfectly without being in anyone's way.  \n\nThe bar is first come first serve, so whatever table, or seat you see available, take it!  it does get crowded with locals, and tourists alike.  Although, honestly, if I lived there I think I would frequent other places... this is definitely a beautiful spot but mostly because of the novelty of that window, after a while I think it would loose it's enchantment.\n\nAs I mentioned, we got out seats, looking straight at the bar, and to our right that amazing window.  Inside is dimly lit so you can enjoy the city lights through the window regardless of where you are seated or standing.\n\nThe server came to us in no time with menus, drinks and they have a nice selection of bar bites to accompany them.  She gave us a minute to decide and was back to take our order, at the same time that she brought us water.\n\nI opted for their cucumber mint refresher.  This was exactly that, refreshing.  Clean, simple, and very welcoming after 3 straight days of wine (Napa trip...)  As you can imagine prices are a bit high but not terrible.  Signature drinks cost from $15 - $20.  They also have a full bar, wines, scotch and whiskey, and beers.\n\nTo snack on something while we killed time before our flight, I ordered the house-made chips.  Generous amount of perfectly crispy and salty chips, with a delicious scallion aioli on the side.  One order was enough for 3 of us.  Drinks, well, those had to be refilled  :p\n\nI was happy we got the chance to get the full experience before we left, and see with my own eyes that (magical) window.", "author": "Greshka P."}

I thought it was a little weird how there is no waiting list. You just have to depend on lady luck and pray that the people sitting on the table you're standing behind are leaving. \n\nHowever, let's focus on the good things. I went with my roommates and we honestly had a great time. We had the tuna tartar, which was decent and I had the cosmo. Everything was great, and even if the price was a little bit on the high side, I was fine with it because I was also paying for the view and the atmosphere. The space was breathtaking! It was absolutely magic! The huge semi-circular windows seem to be a newer addition to the building, but what do I know? I loved the place. The view was amazing and I got there around 6 and stayed until around 8, so I was lucky enough to catch the sunset. \n\nI would definitely like to come again, hopefully with my boyfriend.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-03", "description": "One word: sensational!\n\nLocated inside the historic San Francisco Marriott Marquis hotel, this interior rooftop lounge has it all by giving an aspect, breathtaking views and assortments of drinks and appetizers every year. It's called, \"The View Lounge.\" The atmosphere is very laid back and active as I welcomed there. The concept is pretty modern and sleek thanks to the late 20th Century look of both sided half-circled window and contemporary decors.\n\nThe employees here from bartenders, servers and a host are doing an excellent job for making the customers like me a spectacular service despite the busier environment. No cons.\n\nNow onto the drink! On 9/1/2018, I ordered one of their signature cocktail drinks from the menu. It's called, \"Cucumber Mint Refresher\" which it contains the mixtures of Vodka and club soda topped with a slice of cucumber and a fresh mint. As I drank it, that cocktail drink was such a spell-bound drink. With the help of fresh cucumber and fresh mint, it did enhanced both Vodka and club soda very well; perfectly balanced. I didn't get a chance to order their appetizers and small bites after my first visit, so I'll be back next time to try it out in the near future.\n\nParking at the View Lounge at Marriott Marquis hotel can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface metered street parking nor the parking garage if its available. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, The View Lounge at Marriott Marquis hotel is the most iconic, and magnificent modern interior rooftop lounge that I've ever visited for the very first time! Perfect for friends and co-workers gathering especially for date nighters too! A well received! My rating: 4 solid stars.", "author": "William L."}

It is always crowded and not in a fun, lively way. People are just standing around, unaware of their surroundings, gawking at the view which admittedly, is gorgeous. The setup of this space also is peculiar and could be much better utilized. There is so much low seating that it makes it hard to walk and the separate rooms, in my opinion, really reminds you that you are in a hotel since it feels like conference rooms. Add to that the children running around what is a BAR (don't fall for that \"lounge\" BS) and it really takes away from what could be a lovely experience.\n\nThe drinks also are okay, nothing spectacular. I had a Blood Orange Margarita and A had a Manhattan. It was $30 for 2 drinks without tip which is a bit expensive, even by SF standards. My drink was fine, I have had better for less. A felt similarly about his drink. One big plus is that there is table service so you do not need to crowd around the bar, though tons of people still do. Plus, The View serves food that actually looks good even though we didn't order any.\n\nIs the view beautiful? Yes. Is the decor nice, if impractical? Yes. Is it worth the money, discomfort and frustration at being jostled by tourists who have no concept of space? Absolutely not. Cityscape at the top of the Hilton is a much better execution of the same concept, more efficient use of space and better drinks. Go there, the views are just as good (if not better).", "author": "Carrie W."}

The bottom was just really soggy. Seems like the menu changes so I'd like to explore their menu a little more. \n\nDrinks took awhile to come out and they accidentally charged us twice.

Apparently, we were told another server handles our side, but no such server appeared. We ended up having to go up to the bar to order the drinks ourselves. No biggie, but it would have been nice to know before we waited ~15 minutes.\n\nThe drinks were about $15-$18, a bit on the higher end but expected for San Francisco and the Marriott Marquis. The drinks had cute names, too, like Fab-VIEW-lous and Haight-AshBERRY. If you're looking for fruity and sweet, I'd recommend the BlackBerry Bay and the Haight-Ashberry. If you're looking for something stripped down and simple, I'd recommend the Cucumber Mint Refresher.\n\nWe didn't get to eat, but a lot of other patrons around us did.

This swanky lounge is located at the very top floor of the 39 story San Francisco Marriott Marquis.\n\nOnce you walk in you'll be greeted by huge arched glass floor to cieling windows and an Art Deco inspired lounge which has been recently revitalized after undergoing a multimillion dollar renovation just a few years prior.  The windows are simply beautiful and opens up to an incredible view of San Francisco... almost as if you can touch the skyline.  If you're lucky enough, you can grab a seat next to these windows and enjoy the view.  However this seems to be quite a popular spot so competition is fierce.  It may also be hard to find a seat, especially if you have a big group.

It had the potential to be a really fun spot, but the crowd was a real mix- something you get when you're on top of a hotel, I guess.\n\nThe atmosphere felt dark, almost in a club way, rather than a lounge way, but without the music. At least, we couldn't hear any since it was so loud with the crowd talking over eachother. \n\nIt was packed! Difficult to find a seat with the large crowd, and only a Tuesday! Perhaps it was a fluke, if I was back I would probably try again since a couple of my other friends enjoyed it when they went.\n\nOverall it was a different experience, I'm not sure I would add it to my \"must see\" list for San Francisco, but the view of the city was pretty nice.", "author": "Samantha M."}

How could I ever forget the very element that makes this place even that much more amazing?!\n\nThe View is an enchanting rooftop bar located on the 39th floor of the San Francisco Marriott. You will get swept away by the gorgeous views of the city while relaxing in this stunning lounge. It's dimly lit and has an aerial setup with breathtaking views of San Francisco from each side of the room. The decor is classic and full of comfortable couches and lounge chairs. \n\nThe ambience is amazing! If you're looking to impress, this is your best bet city-wise. I've taken many out of towners here and they are often impressed with the entire setup. It's also the perfect place for a romantic date night! With that being said, I must mention how insanely busy it can get. Reservations are highly recommended, especially if you are planning on coming on the weekends or during the holidays.\n\nIs it pricey?! Yes of course, but it's a rooftop bar located in the heart of SF... what else would you expect? This isn't a lounge that you would come to regularly unless you're planning on shelling out some serious dough every time. But, it's a nice place to visit every  once in a while to splurge. Speaking of splurging, the cocktails and the wine here are both fantastic! You get what you pay for, and the wine is really exquisite! They have a great wine list and the bartenders really know how to whip up a delicious cocktail. \n\nThe food is also pretty good here, but I usually just come for drinks. They have a really delightful cheese and charcuterie plate and you can never go wrong with their chicken wings. It's more of a bar bites menu rather than a full on entree selection. The service has always been really good when I've come, and they offer full table service If you're not sitting at the bar. \n\nIf you've never experienced The View, you must do it! The views are amazing and it's a wonderful experience just waiting to happen!", "author": "Shayla B."}

Boozy, but not too much, just how I like it. It wasn't anything memorable, but I enjoyed it in the moment. It was expensive, though, with most of the cocktails being $14-$16, but you're paying for the view.

You can pretty much capture majority of the city from end to end, but more like from east to west.  \n\nAs for the small side dishes and cocktails, I pretty much enjoyed them too.  The only thing I really remember trying is the creme brulee and the flourless chocolate torte, and a few drinks.  Both desserts were decent and comforting as you relax with friends in the clouds.  Or more like fog and overcast, lol.  Service wasn't an issue either.  \n\nI'd say the only issue is the amount of people they allow up there.  It can be difficult to find a table, chair, or couch at times.  It just gets pretty busy, and there's always someone stalking a table once someone leaves.  If I were a tourist, I'd come up and just act like a tourist!  And hopefully you land a chair.  You want pictures, take pictures!  Don't let the wannabe high-class folks deceive you.

At night, tall skyscrapers and the Bay Bridge light up the skyline. From the 35th floor, you can see everything as if you're on top of the world. \n\nMy friends and I have always wanted to check out The View and we finally have the chance to last Friday night (cue Katy Perry song). \nThere are two rooms, the main room with the bar when you first walk in, and another one across from it in the back. The main room has full service but the other room doesn't so you'll have to make a trip to the bar. But whichever  room you decide to choose, they both have nice views of the skyline.  \nAlso, the tables and couches are on a self-seating basis, so you have to find a table yourself. This may be a struggle during busy hours because it's usually very crowded and there are only a few tables right by the window to see the great view. If you want a seat by the window, you'll most likely have to linger around and wait until someone leaves. I would suggest taking an empty seat first then move to another table by the window when someone leaves.\n\nDrinks: \nLoma Prieta ($16): This will shake up your world and make your head spin like the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Joking, but seriously, this tasted like juice. If I was handed this drink without being warned there was alcohol in it, I would have chugged it all in less than a couple minutes. The fresh slice of grapefruit is refreshing after the drink.  It wasn't bad overall.\n\nSutro Splash ($14): You will enjoy this drink if you like fizzy soda, more specifically ginger beer. It reminds me of a moscow mule with a splash of cranberry juice. It's sweet and not too strong of the alc taste even after seeing how much alcohol the bartender poured (my friend and I were standing there in awe). I liked this one a little more than the Loma prieta. \n\nThe drinks are overpriced for what you get, especially with the ice filled to the brim of the glass. But remember, you're paying for the view also. The view is perfect for any occasion- after work drinks, celebrating a birthday, catching up with friends, etc. The dimly lit atmosphere is especially perfect for date-night.

She had a mocktail and I got a shot to implement into it to spice it up, and I stuck with their old fashioned, which was done right. It had the sweetness of the brown sugar but still smokey. Seating is first come first serve, so if you want a view, come early, or prepare to wait. Luckily, as we got there, a couple saw us and offered us a place to sit by the window.

If we had waited any longer though we probably would've missed the opportunity to sit directly next to the window because we snagged the only table left - score! \n\nOnce you get to the 39th floor of the Marriott and the elevator doors open to this magical place, prepare to be amazed at how beautiful the scenery is. The moment you step out of the elevator there are floor to ceilings windows on both side of you that are shining all that natural light in (perfect opportunity for selfies ;) ). There are comfy lounge chairs and tables aligned all along the windows perfect for ample viewing time. \n\nTo end our long work week, Tomas R, Diandra S, and I decided that wine and charcuteries plates were the best way to celebrate. Service is a wee bit on the slower side, but with a view that beautiful and company that great, there was definitely no rush. The wine was light, fresh and crisp. The charcuterie plate, perfectly presented with crackers, cheese, prosciutto, jam, and honey, was the perfect pairing.  \n\nSipping on rose, eating cheese crackers and soaking in all the San Francisco beauty was the best way to end my SF trip. I'd gladly come back to The View on any trip I have to SF. Even if I lived in SF I'd try to come visit every week - it's just that beautiful.", "author": "Issabelle F."}

The View San Fransisco has sights to take in that would be acceptable for any grammy award winning artist, at a surprisingly decent price.\n\nMany members of my work fam suggested this place, and so on our last afternoon in San Fransisco after a busy event-filled week Issabelle F and Thomas R decided drinking in the views of the city would be the best way to end the week.\n\nIt does not disappoint in any way. From the moment you step into the lounge, you are captivated by the natural light, floor to ceiling windows and breathtaking views.\n\nWant to take a look at the bay with a cocktail in hand? You can. Want to sip on ros\u00e9 while taking a gander at the expansive cityscape? Yup, you can do that too. Or maybe you just want to take in the hills and mountains while exchanging stories about the week's shenanigans. Yassss, still possible here.\n\nThe View is located on the 39th floor and it is a wonderful way to relax, unwind and take in the beauty of San Fransisco. I was surprised at how inexpensive the cocktails were. I mean, this place can definitely up charge based on the scenery (people and views included here) but I picked up the tab for two rounds of drinks and a cheese plate for a cool $63. \n\nThe ambiance is great. I'm not sure what the normal music scene looks like here, but its worth noting that I walked in to hearing Mariah Carey Honey and continued to be serenaded by the sounds of Aaliyah, Destiny's Child, Boyz II Men and other nostalgic 90s tunes. The View, you got me hooked on youuuuuuu. \n\nThe charcuterie plate was beautifully presented and filled with tasty prosciutto, spicy sausage and cheeses. Perfect for sharing over a crisp California Ros\u00e9. The furniture includes lounge-y seats that are window-front (is that word?). Don't look down or you may get a little woozy from the height. Or at least, I did.\n\nThere is seats all around, plus a bar. I would advise to get there early because the prime seats will get snatched up rather quickly.\n\nThe View, what you've got is far beyond compare and I can't wait for another taste of honey...i mean your views!", "author": "Diandra L."}

All the times iv'e been here i was only able to sit by the window once and that's because we came around 5pm and caught the sunset which was beautiful! If you come any time after 6pm.. good luck getting a window seat... you'll just have to stand around and wait for people to leave. The servers here are great, they are pretty attentive and will still help you even if you are not yet seated. The drinks are very pricey but that's expected since it is in the city.

We took a quick elevator to the top floor and just like that, the doors opened to one of the prettiest sites I've ever seen. The set up is unlike any other roof top bar I've been to. The rooftop is completely inside with tables and sitting areas on completely around the entire rooftop, with the bar and elevators located in the center. There is a great view of the city, the water and one of the bridges!\n\nWe came around 5:00/5:30pm so it was pretty crowded and we were unable to snag a table right next to the window (believe me I gave people the stare down). The seating is first come, first serve (if you're in to throwing bows for a good seat this is your kind of place). We arrived just in time to find a pair of seats at the bar and still were able to take in the beautiful view from our seats at the bar.\n\nAs bourbon-holics we were over the top to find several unique bourbon and scotch cocktails on their beverage menu. The bourbon cocktails were unique, delicious. All of their cocktails are fresh made, hand crafted cocktails. We were able to watch the extremely talented bartenders craft several delicious looking cocktails of vodka, bourbon, tequila, champagne..  \n\nThe View is a place I will tell everyone visiting San Francisco to stop at and look forward to visiting again myself.", "author": "Caitie S."}

If you visit before 4pm you will be met by other enthusiasts ready to get on the elevator and go up to the top floor, the View Lounge which doesn't open until 4pm. The elevator will take you to the floor before it and you will see a ton of people eagerly waiting for the elevators to light up going UP. If you get there after 4pm good luck finding a seat, the lounge is small and the seats by the windows get taken up by the early birds who waited on the floor below before 4pm. Its a hot ticket and I suggest you bring your patience, thrills, and good vibes...along with you wallets by 3:45pm to guarantee a good seat. The drinks are $15 average and meals are around the same; a cocktail and a snack plus tip you're looking at $30 easy.

However, the majority of us aren't doing one or the other, which tends to diminish the experience.\n\nCame here one weekday evening after work with a co-worker. On the 35th floor of the JW Marriott, you pass through the lobby to get to the elevators up. When you arrive at the lounge, you may wonder if you should head left or right. Answer: it really doesn't matter, so just choose one.\n\nOf course, you should try to grab a seat by the windows. The views afforded from this height are quite lovely. However, the seats are oriented to face each other rather than the view, which makes sense for conversation but not for maximizing experience. Also, some seats are directly below lights, making it so that you're blinded and the center of attention. Avoid those at all costs.\n\nThe cocktails are expensive, but what you would expect given the location. About $16 a pop. However, they are quite yummy and potent, so at least it's not a complete charge-up. My north beach negroni was on point.\n\nDuring our time there, we also opted to order warm cheesy bread, which was yum. The honey butter was a nice complement and the bread really was filled with cheese!\n\nAll in all, a nice place if you want to get classy, but not the most stunning ambiance I've experienced.", "author": "Angela C."}

We had some time to kill before the doors opened at 4:00 PM and hoped to beat the crowd by arriving there at opening. Boy, were we wrong! We got onto the elevator at 3:54 PM and it would not take us to the 39th floor (where the lounge is located) before 4 PM so we decided to go up to the 38th floor. As the elevator doors opened, we saw a huge crowd (just as smart as us) anticipating the moment when access to the 39th floor is granted. More people joined us as we patiently waited for the clock to hit the fourth hour and once the elevator gave us way to the lounge - everyone started packing into the elevators like sardines. We finally got onto the third elevator and made our way up to the lounge only to find it packed! We did manage to get a fairly decent spot with a view (but not the best spot there). Once we settled down, I ordered the High Rise Cosmo ($16) and finally relaxed! It was definitely a chore to get to this lounge (especially at opening) but \"the view\" was worth it. Despite the difficulty in acquiring a good spot by a window I experience every time I visit - I will continue going back here for at least one drink when I am in the city!

I haven't tried the food, so this review only judges the drinks, ambiance, and service. \nService was nothing special. Our server came around once to ask if we were ready right when we sad down, and we said we needed another minute. It seemed like eternity until she finally came back around.\nIf you are trying to get a window seat, you need to line up at the elevators a bit before 4pm to get a good seat. The elevator floor for the bar does not open until 4, so people are literally waiting in the elevator until they can select the 39th floor.\nThe drinks are pretty pricy, but they are very strong and good.

Located on the 39th floor of the Marriot Hotel, this place provides a breathtaking panoramic view of the city.  On one side, you can see the Bay Bridge and tall buildings, and on the other side, you get a view of the Sutro Tower and Bernal Heights.  The place opens up at 4pm and seating is on a first come first serve basis.  You just take the elevator up and seat yourself.  It can get pretty crowded up there.  If you wait around a bit, you can find a group leaving and take their spot.  I ended up getting a seat by the bar and enjoying the sunset view.  It was so gorgeous.\n\nI tried the Skyline Punch ($15):\n(Captain Morgan white rum | fresh citrus | pineapple | brandied cherry juice)\nIt was good, but I wasn't crazy about it.  Definitely refreshing though!\n\nThe menu items are pricey, but pretty typical for a lounge like this.  I say it's worth it for the view.  It's difficult to take nice photos at night because of the reflection of the window.  Come for the sunset, take photos, and enjoy some drinks or food.  Watch out for Karl the Fog!

The right side was packed so I imagine it's hard finding a table during regular hours.\n\nThe catered party was beautifully presented; there was a cascading buffet of appetizers, small plates, cheeses, and desserts. All the food was from the hotel kitchen and it was amazing. I was totally impressed at the quality and presentation.

That was a little frustrating as a group of four looking for a table.  They could then also double up couples of two if the parties were comfortable since they know all window seats will be filled.\n\nWe grabbed some seats at the lounge style tables facing towards the windows.

It was hard finding a window seat, but my husband and I got very lucky. I couldn't wait to try the food and drinks. The only reason why I gave a four star is because the service was very slow, it took 20min to get a waiter to our table (Thursday night). Once we got a waiter, everything was better. I recommend the ahi tuna appetizer and  Sazerac cocktail  (if you like whiskey recommend this drink, it's not on the main menu but the bartender made it very well). The view of the city below was breath taking and I was grateful to have a wonderful moment with my husband, I can't wait to come back.", "author": "Michelle H."}

The city looked great from the view and I thought it was always cool to see a city from a different time of day.  The interior was dark with lights here and there.  \n\nThe drink menu had a lot of choices depending on what you were feeling.  I chose the Soma Spritzer ($14) and everybody else had the Frisco Smash ($15), Valencia ($14) and the Pacific Heights Gimlet ($16).  The drinks came out after a few minutes of waiting.  \n\nThe Soma Spritzer was light to me (or everything was mixed well) but I was fine with that.  It looked like I was drinking water. lol  The Valencia and Frisco Smash looked very similar to each other in terms of color.  The Pacific Heights Gimlet was also not bad as well as everything else.

I've been thinking of ways I can just build a fort in a corner and get away pretending this is my penthouse but so far no idea seems reasonable.\n\nAfter an amazing conference with my amazing work colleagues we decided to embrace our recent learning of LIFE PROFIT (yes it's a thing) and make the most of a beautiful Thursday in San Francisco. After a hungover search for Acai Bowls we decided the best way to fix this was some drinks overlooking the skyline of this city. I expected views but hot damn was I blown away by the portrait The View provides you.\n\nIt's one of those situations where you almost feel like you didn't dress up enough for the occasion because The View spoils you- more ways than one. Not only are there superb drinks and small bites; however, you can pick, YES PICK, your scenic experience.\n\nWant to feel like you're on the set of \"The Sound of Music\" then take a left from the elevators and see the scenic hill country of California. If you're more in the mood for a \"Sex and The City\" skyline view then definitely go towards the edge of the glass dome and take in the views.\n\nAs you're on the 39th floor you can't help but wonder what all those little dots on the ground are up to for the day...\n\nAside from taking a few, maybe 15 minutes, for photo ops and selfies. You can't help but be amazed that this site hadn't been brought to your attention sooner. \n\nMy group was wanting to nibble on something so we opted for the charcuterie board which had your staple pairings that opt well with a glass of ros\u00e9. I can't wait to come back and show everyone my new penthouse (at least until security or the staff ask me to stop telling people that).", "author": "Tomas R."}

Granted the views are good all around The View but some tables aren't right near the window. \n\nThe service was slow at first that I even questioned if there was table service. Not sure if they were just understaffed that night or if it was just because it was so busy but regardless, a place like that is most likely always busy, so they should be prepared. \n\nI got a glass of white wine and we shared the tuna poke and flatbread. Both were good, I wouldn't say amazing though. The flatbread was kind of hard to eat; definitely not sexy food. The drinks and food were pricey however that is expected since you're at the Marriott in downtown SF. \n\nOverall, great place to grab a few drinks and maybe some apps but not a place you'd stay all night.

I asked a Yelp friend about the Westin, and she suggested that I come here. Thank you Alina M. for pointing me to this place.\n     I had been walking from where the cable car let me off about a half mile away.  I'd walk a block or so, pull out my phone and ensure I was walking in the right direction. Eventually I came to the Marriott.  According to my phone-map I was close. I asked the doorman about the bar, and with a smile, he pointed straight up, and said \"Head up to the 39th floor.\" I thanked him and turned into the Hotel, and then found my way to an elevator. \n     Inside the elevator were ads wallpapered on the back of the car. \"See the View on the 39th floor!\" it exclaimed.  A couple stared romantically out over the city. I knew I was in the right place and I punched the button for the 39th floor. The doors opened up and I heard the sound of dining. I stepped out of the elevator and looked to my right to see the great big window that looks like I was sitting in the pilot seat of the Millennium Falcon. The view was spectacular.\n     The seats by the windows were obviously very popular and all were occupied. I had to awkwardly hover by one for a lil bit by a standing table before one opened up. I swooped in as soon as it's occupant vacated, and I dropped my camera bag on the floor at my feet. I looked out at the city for a moment and had to zen for just a lil bit. Wow. Lookit the city down there. A waitress swung by and asked me if I'd like anything. I thanked her and looked at a menu. Holy CRAP! This stuff is kinda pricy!\n     Further examining the menu, the appetizers weren't too bad. The Housemade chips and charred scallion dip were only seven fifty. There were a few other seven fifty items, then the 'small' plates jumped to nineteen dollars. The bottle of beer to enjoy with the chips however....eight dollars. That was even a bud light! Welp. Fifteen dollars for some chips and a beer. But lookit the window. It's incredible. We're way high up...and it's a huge window. I'm paying for Ambiance.\n     I stood there for a bit. Staring out into the city. I enjoyed my chips and my beer, I took some photographs, and after a while I stood at the table, staring out into space. My empty bottle, and my empty basket in front of me. Waitress came by again and with a smile asked if I'd like some water. Thank you waitress. You get me. I enjoyed my glass of water for as long as I could; and eventually left my table. I watched as somebody else swooped in mere moments after I vacated it. \n     As I walked back to the elevators, I finally noticed that this place has two sides. The other side seems more of a restaurant dining area than a chilling bar area. But still. Lots of great big windows overlooking the city. I walked over and took some more photographs from this side, and finally returned to the elevator. \n\n    As I exited back onto the street, I again thanked the doorman who was still there. I then continued my adventures in the city by the bay.", "author": "Scott B."}

There were staff members everywhere, who were friendly and helpful and made it all easy.\n\nThe ride in the special elevator made me feel like I was in a science fiction film. In seconds, we flew from the 3rd floor to the 47th and 48th, where the restaurant and the lounge are located. The view was fun to watch as we ate and the lounge was very nice.\n\nWait staff took orders for beverages and brought them, but everything else was buffet. Usually, when I eat out, I can only find one thing I like, but the 2 buffet tables, one for the main meal and one for desserts and cheeses, were like heaven. There were so many choices that I like and I was able to try a little bit of everything. I felt as if they had been reading my mind, when they made these choices available. Everything was very well prepared and totally delicious.  The chocolate fountain was like a fantasy and it really was easy to use.

The mushroom flatbread was very delicious. We also had a complimentary creme brulee because it was my friend's birthday. We didn't ask for it but the server was so sweet and gave us a free dessert with lighted candle. And of course, the dessert didn't disappoint us. Learning from the first time, this time I got here exactly at 4pm when they opened, and guess what? I still couldn't get a window seat. But I managed to get a seat on the side with the nice view.

It gets SUPER packed, anytime. My boyfriend took me here for our anniversary and it was so amazing. Prices are usual range for drinks and food. And they were so great, so many options! We were still full from our late lunch so we decided to ask the waitress what kind of appetizer she suggest we order, and we ended up ordering the home made potato chips, it was so good, especially with the ranch dressing they served along with it! You can never go wrong with ranch! They also had some small hot plate options and as the night progressed, we tried  asian chicken wings and they tasted boom! \n\nI wish we were able to sit near the glass dome, maybe next time when we're in town we will. But for now, even without the glass dome view, we were able to take in the city view and enjoy our evening. It was very romantic, we even got to catch the sunset. The only thing was that at night, the dim lights from inside the buildings glared on the windows, so it made it a little bit hard to see the city lights outside.

So, why not break it down according to those criteria...\n\nComfort: the place hardly had any seating, nobody is there to arrange you a table and trying to get a really expensive drink at the bar was quite a wait. Now, I am cool with some of those things at a cheap bar, but this was up there in terms of price and I'd say the comfort level here not great. It is a decently fun place, solid crowd of yuppie looking people on weekends.\n\nDrinks: the Moscow mule I had was not the worst I had, but not far from it. I genuinely hate when bartenders can't make a simple drink like that correctly. This was sugary and disgusting.\n\nInteresting: Well, the view is cool. The semi circle window is interesting.

It's a great way to enjoy some cocktails and appetizers with some coworkers or friends. We ordered a ton of food. Some of the food we ordered:\n\nBeet salad- Pretty good for what it is. The goat cheese adds a tangy flavor that pairs well with the beets and clementines in the salad. \n\nYellowfin Tuna Poke- Fresh tuna! The thick chunks of avocado with this went very well. \n\nBloody Mary prawns- This was average, just seemed like shrimp lightly dipped in Bloody Mary drinks. Nothing special with this small plate.\n\nBraised short rib flatbread- Pretty good. The short rib tastes good and tender, it just has a lot of cheese on top that covers a lot of the short ribs flavor, but I'm never really going to complain about extra cheese in my life, haha.\n\nHouse smoked lollipop wings- These were very good. Nice and crispy and flavorful. Finger licking good.\n\nPork belly tacos- the pork was very tender and the cilantro and Mexican cheese on top gives it the perfect authentic taste. \n\n--------\n\nWe drank Moscow Mules with our food.

One of the first places we went to after getting off the Powell Bart station was The View located the top floor of the Marriott.

I loved how the frames complimented the city views and depending where you sat, you can actually see the bay bridge!\n\nMy friend and I got to The View around 6pm and the lounge was already super packed. But if you wait around for a bit, you can spot a group leaving and you can scoop their table. That's exactly what I did and it only took less than 10 minutes! I got a table right by the windows which really set the mood for the night just overlooking the city with the sunset in the background. We ordered their flatbread with some drinks - Skyline Punch and Mission Margarita. The flat bread was presented on this cute wooden board and it was so pretty! I loved their bean sprouts with tomatoes and goat cheese. It was so delicious especially paired with the drinks. My Skyline punch was pretty good, but what was really amazing was the Mission Margarita. Before my friend ordered it, the waitress told him it was going to be spicy, which he was okay with.

He even suggested I get it on the rocks because the ice he used was that perfect stiff block of ice cube used for drinks to keep it cold but not dilute it because it doesn't melt very quickly which I appreciated so much. Such a nice touch! Sitting there got me feeling like this is what being in my 30's should feel like. Nice bar, nice view of the city with a nice drink in my hand.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-05-26", "description": "Came here on Monday night (May 9th) for the first time as a party of three. I had heard via Yelp and through word of mouth that \"the view from The View is amazing\" and that the drinks were good, too. We had our cousin in town from Canada, and had been taking her for views of the City while listening to Views by Drake who happens to be from Toronto like my cousin.\n\nFinding the place was easy. It has a very distinct window shape, so we could spot the Marriott from a few blocks away. We were not able to find a window seat initially, so we sat down at a table near the windows. A server was with us within 2 minutes and brought us menus. About 4 minutes later, a different server finished cleaning a window table and offered it to us - and we obliged.\n\nWe carried over our menus, browsed the options and chatted, and took pictures of the view and with the view. My cousin left to use the restroom and came back. We still had our menus, and no one had come by to check on us and take our order. We began attempting to make eye contact and raising our hand to flag someone down, and thought we had successfully done so - but we were wrong. Were we invisible? I know the sun was setting and the atmosphere was dim, but we were three ladies - one missing a leg - quite hard to miss. After 15 more minutes had passed, we decided not to wait any longer. My sister-in-law's kids were waiting at home for their mommy so they could go to sleep, and she didn't want to drive when it was too late and dark.\n\nNo one seemed to notice that we left. On the elevator trip down, we were briefly talking about how ridiculous the service had been - but at least, the views, they were nice. One of the women riding the elevator with us was a staff member and appalled when she overheard us. She offered for us to come right back up, or to come back the following day, and she would personally ensure that we were served. We would've taken her up on the offer, but like I said - it was late, we had babies to get back home to, and we had a full itinerary planned the following day and could not adjust our schedule.\n\nOh well.\n\nA bit disappointing, and The View has tried to make it up. They apologized on my Instagram when I posted a photo and brief comment about our experience. I'm sure the place gets very busy, as it is a popular tourist spot, but just a tip: they may not have the most attentive waiters.", "author": "Shar M."}

The sliders were basic mini burgers that came in three. I totally died for the tuna tartare/poke here though!

I'd say half the bar has okay views, with seating by the really large, picturesque windows only available to a lucky few.

Welp, it's finally time to cross this sucker off with some extra added X's and O's it so deserves.\n\nLocated on the 39th floor of The Marriott Hotel in SOMA, The View definitely speaks for itself. The 'view' that you get to experience, from just about any seat in this lounge/bar, is breathtaking and makes you pause a little bit to realize that this is beautiful SF you're staring into while it so innocently stares right back at you at the same time. You don't realize how time suddenly stops, your heart rate steadily slows, and you're taking cleansing breaths from between your lips as you're engulfed by it all. It's exasperating. Real talk. \n\nIt's even better when the weather is in the mid 60's where you can romp around the city in a tank, skirt and booties in February. Cali, you're just so freaking awesome ;]\n\nWith such wonderful weather conditions, we were able to catch the clear picturesque views of the bay, Bay Bridge and the overall city landscape and life. We stayed late enough to watch the moon rise over the Bay bridge too. So romantic. \n\nOnce you snap back to reality... And find a spot, they've got a full bar with craft cocktails and craft beers. Bar bites (we had the chicken lollipops and hummus) and other menu options that we didn't get to delve into this time but will definitely next. \n\nHappy I finally made it in here before I died.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-06", "description": "If I was just going to rate the absolutely breathtaking view of \"The View\", it would be a unanimous 5-star rating. Hell, I'd go the extra step and give it 10 stars if Yelp allowed it. But I have to be downright honest with each and every one of my reviews. Especially when factoring in the key components; service, quality, and experience.\n\nLocated on the 39th floor of the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Downtown San Francisco, this has got to be one of the finest picturesque views you will find in the city. Having been born and raised here most of my life, the only thing equally amazing would be Twin Peaks and Coit Tower. With that said and done, \"The View\" is an enclosed lounge/appetizer bar that is only open for adults (sorry kids). And they do have limited hours only being open from 4pm-1am.\n\nI came here with my lady and our two friends after doing some shopping at Westfield San Francisco Centre. Fortunately, this place is in heart of everything; shopping, fine dining, Union Square, and plenty of public transportation. Since this review is specifically on \"The View\" and not the \"Marriott Marquis\", I won't go into any logistics on the hotel itself. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that \"The View\" gets crowded.. very quickly! We arrived around 4:15pm and almost every table near the window was taken. Luckily there was a small group that left when we were trying to find a decent window seat so we snatched that up very quickly. The service here offers a waiter/waitress service as well as a bar. They carry a wide variety of beer, wine, cocktails, and well drinks. And remember, this is not a full restaurant so if you're hungry, the extent of what they serve here are nuts, cheese platters, salads, and desserts.\n\nConsidering this is in San Francisco, expect to pay a very high price for getting this million-dollar view. I ordered a total of 3 bottles of \"Guinness\" beer and at $8.00/each, they don't come cheap! My lady had 2 glasses of red Merlot wine priced at $14.00/each. And finally, our friends ordered San Francisco's own \"Anchor Steam\" beer also priced at $8.00. Since we wanted a little something to nibble on, we decided on placing a couple orders of their \"Housemade Beer Nuts\" priced at $5.00. These were absolutely delicious while packing a caramelized flavor as well as a sweet and spicy kick to it.\n\nGoing back to the overall experience of \"The View\", it is a truly amazing experience all in itself and its something that I would highly recommend. It does get very crowded here so if you do happen to come later, the odds of guaranteed seating are literally slim to none. But if you do get a lucky seat, bring your camera or smartphone and take some awesome shots of the buildings. You will be able to see all the skyscrapers, the Bay Bridge, and even the Golden Gate Bridge. It is definitely worth the experience!", "author": "Donovan H."}

You walk through their lobby, and into an elevator, press a button to the specified area and voila - spectacular sights of the city from different sides of the building.\n\nAs the evening progresses and the sun begins to set, the lighting becomes mood like so that you can really take in what's in front of you. The trick is to arrive early to snag a seat as they don't take reservations and all spots are on a first-come basis. Being a Wednesday night, we had no problem snagging a seat at the bar, but the rest of the tables next to the windows were prime real estate and people were holding on to those with dear life.\n\nThe cocktails are more on the pricey side, but they have a great selection to choose from. We ended up trying some of their higher-end tequilas (which I learned you're supposed to sip and not shoot... oops) and found myself enjoying the liquid presented to me. I know little to nothing about tequila, but it was smooth.

We asked if she could do separate checks and were given our first glare. She didn't even try to hide her distaste. From then on she essentially ignored us and when we would get her attention she would be downright nasty. \n\nAs we were about to leave, two other friends came over to our table as we asked for the check.

It's that flippin' romantic. \n\nI ended up at The View (atop the downtown Marriott) on two occasions on my last visit to SF because what's better than a bar with a view of the whole city, no cover charge, and a surprising amount of open seating? NOTHING. That's what.\n\nThe moment you walk out of the elevators you'll be struck by the floor to ceiling windows looking out onto the city with views of the water in the distance. Be quick to scout out any available window-side seating, but don't worry if you don't see any right away, since the seating wraps around the building with plenty of options for small or larger groups (up to 8, otherwise you'll have to split up). And groups are great, but this is the type of bar you should really do with a special someone. The lighting is dim, drinks are stiff, and music is soft. You will 100% get laid after this. That's right, if you are walking in with a friend and want to keep it platonic, turn around and take the elevator back down. This ish is romantic a f and you'll end up at third base before you know it. You've been warned.\n\nMoving on, I ordered a gin and tonic (which turned into three gin and tonics) and talked the night away with a good friend. Wait... Didn't you say you shouldn't go with a friend... Anyway, the service was attentive without being annoying and our server didn't bat an eye when we ran over to a window-side table that opened up half way through our drink/talk sesh. \n\nI was so struck by this place that the next night I told a larger group of friends and we headed back for a nightcap. The crowd was less touristy than I expected (only one fanny pack spotted. And he was at our table), but this time we found a few larger booths and people ordered from the bar. This time I noticed some other areas that don't have a great view, but are super relaxed and better for groups of 5 or more. Once again, a great night was had and this was one of the more memorable bars that night. Mostly because it was early in the night before we'd been to too many bars... But that's neither here nor there.\n\nTo recap: it's an uber scenic lounge that's great for a romantic rendezvous, small group outing, or solo emo drink at the bar. The night time views of San Francisco are crazy|sexy|cool and so is the vibe.", "author": "Andi P."}

Everything else: sucks. \n\nOk, I admit I am bitter because The View really put a dent in my wedding night back on Saturday, June 18, 2016. \n\nFlashback: My husband and I made a reservation ahead of time to stay at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis after we returned to the city from our wedding reception in Tiburon. I think we made it into The View around 11 PM. The bar was insanely packed. As it was only the two of us, we could not reserve a table in advance, we were told. Ok, so we will take a chance, maybe we can find a seat somewhere, and at least have a drink to celebrate our wedding day. \n\nThere were zero seats available... Oh wait, except for a curtained-off room with no one in it. I introduced myself to the manager on duty and politely asked if my husband and I could grab a drink and just sit in there for a while, and explained we had just gotten married that day and were staying at the Marquis that night. I even tried to show him some wedding photos on my phone as proof. He brushed me off, and said the room had had a private event in it earlier and hadn't been cleaned up yet (though it looked fine to me, there wasn't any trash or dirty glasses or plates). I pleaded, but he again said he couldn't budge because it was \"a safety concern.\" Seriously. This was the part that upset me the most. It would have been really nice to just sit somewhere quiet and look out over the city lights and share a toast with my husband, even if only for 15 minutes before we went to our room for the night. But nope. \n\nOk. We went to the bar. There was nowhere to sit at the bar, of course. Maybe we could stand off to the side and sip our drinks after. The lone bartender was crushed with orders. I waited and tried to get in a drink order for about 10 minutes, but the bartender was making drinks like his life depended on it and seemed to be studiously ignoring me. Not that I blame him as I think he was many drinks behind at the rate he was going at it. Why he had to make all drinks by himself with this crowd, I can only imagine.\n\nNowhere to sit and no consideration for a very special night by the manager. Can't order a cocktail unless I make a blood sacrifice on the bar. I decided forget it, let's just go to our room, maybe we can order room service? \n\nGot to our room. The bed is comfortable and the room is clean. But that is pretty standard to expect of a big city hotel, so I'm not going to fawn over a nice comforter and mattress. \n\nI'm starving at this point and exhausted. It's probably about 11:30 PM. Guess what? There is no room service at this hotel. Instead, they have a binder in the room that lists restaurants who deliver to them. But, oh, they stopped serving earlier. \n\nI can't believe it. Nowhere to sit at the bar, can't get a drink at the bar, and no food possible in our room. \n\nI look out the window at the nice view for a while and realize I'm too mad for such a beautiful day and I need to relax. My husband and I are wiped out, so no tmi needed. Instead, we just crash after resolving to get up early, check the hell out, and get brunch somewhere where we can actually get service. \n\nOur wedding day was one of the best days of my life. The San Francisco Marriott Marquis was an unfortunate end to it, but I made a promise to myself that I will never step foot in it again, and that makes me feel a bit better that I won't ever have to join a herd of young professionals crushed together, trying to get a drink order in so they can feel sophisticated looking out at that stunning view. What also struck me is that about half of the people sitting at the window tables weren't even marveling at the city lights, or their companions, but looking down instead at the glow of their cell phone screens. \n\nMy advice? Enjoy the view if you can get it, and if you go on the weekend, get there early. Really early. Don't expect any special treatment, and bring extra cash for those drinks.", "author": "Sarah J."}

The fact that it was busy made a more memorable experience; looking for a table was an adventure in itself across the various nooks, each with a different View. It definitely reminded me of Boston's Top of the Hub, only more vintage--as expected for SF--with large semicircular windows featuring panes designed like wheel spokes.\n\n(++) Skyline punch, $14 (Captain Morgan white rum, pineapple juice, fresh citrus juice, brandied grenadine): Definitely one of the better punches I've had, with a healthy dose of alcohol added to a refreshing mix of fruit juices.\n\n(++) The View Manhattan, $14 (Bulleit rye, Capano Antica vermouth, bitters): Mm, bold and strong. No better way to enjoy the View.\n\nFunny thing is, my Skyline Punch came in a suave old fashioned glass, while the boo's View Manhattan looked like a girly martini :P\n\nPrices are higher than average as expected and the craft cocktails are good. I just can't help but be amused that $14 is the same price as my huge plate of chile verde I had for dinner at swanky Tropisueno. Oh SF prices... I don't know whether to think that Tropisueno has bargain food or that the View has expensive drinks.\n\nTip: If you want to take a nice picture of your dranks at night, I suggest finding the room that has a printout of a night shot of the city lights--borderline tacky though it may appear, it makes an excellent backdrop far better than what your camera can capture with the actual View.", "author": "Edna C."}

I can see why, but honestly I think it's a little overhyped. \n\nIt's at the top floor of the Marriott downtown and you don't need a hotel card to get there. The bar is spacious, lots of sofas, seats, chairs, etc. But we had a rather large group, so seating became an issue once it started getting busy. The best part of this bar is definitely the view (lol). The window is huge and overlooks so much of the city. On a clear day, you could probably see the entire city! (exaggeration lol I wouldn't know because it was foggy af when we were there). It's a trendy, upscale, very bougie place to chill and grab drinks with friends.\n\nAside from that, my major complaints about this place was the overall service. We had a rather large group but we were able to grab a small table and sofa chairs by the center of the large window. The waitresses kept avoiding our table, even though they were making direct contact with us. We were all starving and trying to order food and drinks. One waitress (after we went up to her to try to order), told us that someone would be coming by shortly. 10-15 minutes later (after they had been ignoring us), they told us we needed to order directly from the bar and they wouldn't take our orders because she didn't want to split all the checks. -____- ok lady. could've told us that in the first place instead of making us more HANGRY. So we went to the bar and ordered. The food is overpriced, but what can you expect? It's a bougie SF bar. Lots of drink choices though. I only ordered the cheesy bread from the food menu because I didn't want to awkwardly eat a huge plate in this setting (it's more suitable for finger foods ya know). The cheesy bread was ok. Not cheesy. It seemed like just normal bread. Misleading to say the least. At least it was warm and fluffy?? But $6 for a loaf of bread and some butter is insane. \n\nI would come back here just because of the view, but definitely not for the food or service.", "author": "Amy T."}

Our theme for the day was #views, so it was only fitting we stop by The View lounge to enjoy some drinks. In planning our date, I had originally wanted to go rooftop bar hopping in the City (which you think would be easy), however, not many bars in SF offer rooftop views. \n\nWe had been wanting to come here for some time but we could never figure out a time that worked for the both of us. Walking in, we wanted to make it the best experience possible because of all the time we had waited to check this place out. Unfortunately, I have to knock off one star because our server was a bit rude when I did not like her drink recommendation and sent the drink back. I really hate doing this but the drink was too strong and tasted a lot like rubbing alcohol. When she brought back my new drink order, she quickly plopped it on the table and walked away. Somewhat disappointed because it was a complete 180 from the kind and friendly girl we were first greeted with. As time passed, her attitude changed and I ended up leaving her a nice tip. \n \nThe bar itself is small and intimate. The seating fills up fast as everyone tries to get a table next to the window. The drinks are average and a bit pricy but, of course, what you are really paying for is the view. The sweeping cityscape view of SF is worth it too! Definitely a great place to come if you want to impress a special lady friend ;-)\n\nOverall, we had a great experience and would come here again. A must-see if you are visiting the city.   \n\nPro-tip: If you want the ultimate view of the city- plan to arrive on time! This means taking the elevator all the way up to the 38th floor and once 4pm strikes you'd hop back on and take the elevator to the next floor up.

I had a really terrible experience here. \n\nFirst of all, we went to a rooftop lounge for the view. The way that the lounge was set up made it impossible to get a good look unless you were lucky enough to snag one of the coveted chairs near the edge of the window. Other than that you're basically totally out of luck, there's no outdoor viewing area, no window space without chairs blocking it, etc. It was impossible to enjoy the view. As a tourist, I was hoping to get a good photo in, but there wasn't a good place to do that either. \n\nAdditionally, the food and drinks were awful as well. I ordered a mule that came to me in a wine glass and tasted nothing like ginger beer. My friend got a cosmo, and didn't like her drink either. The food was equally as disappointing, and I found most of the items to be poorly described on the menu, misleading us to order things we weren't ultimately satisfied with. \n\nIt's a shame, this place is in a great location with so much potential.", "author": "Sarina G."}

I tried the \"Moscone\" Mule (named after the Moscone center, cute!). What an amazing concoction this was! With lots of mint and the most refreshing ginger beer I've ever had, I was very pleased.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-18", "description": "A picture is worth a thousand words, so they say. \n\nWith a place called, The View, I can honestly vouch that the name speaks for itself. \n\nSome friends and I decided to come to this place since we were in the neighborhood. This bar lounge is located on the 39th floor of the Marriot Marquis Hotel on 4th Street.\n\nUpon entering the building, you already feel that you are in a more upscale place. Doormen dressed in suits greet you warmly as you pass through. Staff members are standing around observing the floor looking to see\nif anyone needs assistance. This hotel is quite large so the employee who pointed us in the right direction to the high rise elevators was greatly appreciated.\n\nThe lounge opens at 4pm and closes at 1:30am. I was aware that seating can fill up fast so we arrived exactly at 4. Once we stepped into the elevator, we moved quickly and smoothly up to the 39th floor. Most of the\npeople in the elevator were headed for the same destination. \n\nAs the doors opened, light poured in from all direction and it looked like you would have boarded the Millennium Falcon, itself! With such distinctively designed, rounded windows, and the feeling of being suspended in mid air, it truly gave the impression that you are flying through the city skyline.\n\nI was completely amazed by what my eyes took in. I almost forgot to look for a seat. Once I came back to my senses, I swiftly searched for a seat near one of the enormous windows, but all were basically taken. Mind you, it was only 4:10 pm at this point, and this place was already filling up. \n\nLuckily, right behind a side wall we were able to find a table that was not too far from a window.\n\nThis architectural masterpiece was designed by Anthony J. Lumsden. The high arching windows so beautifully displays the best of what San Francisco has to offer and can leave you breathless. In one direction, you can see the Golden Gate Bridge and in another view you can catch the entire East Bay in all its spectacular glory. The bay bridge is completely visible as well and so is Downtown FIDI and SOMA. \n\nIf you seriously come here to see nothing else but\n\"THE VIEW,\" you will leave completely satisfied.\n\nBUT, this place has more to offer than just breathtaking views. The bar has some signature cocktails that are very tasty and even a little bit dangerous. \n\nI decided to go with the Van Ness Press. This cocktail had everything I liked. It was made with Tanqueray gin (substituted with vodka), raspberries, mint, and citrus. Truly a refreshing drink. Their drinks are mixed very well and smooth to the finish.\n\nWe ordered some small plates which included the prawns tostadas and Yellow Fin Tuna \"Poke Style.\" The food wasn't as memorable as the view or cocktails, but our experience was amazing nonetheless. \n\nI recommend coming a little before 4pm if you want to grab a seat next to a window. They go pretty fast. Self seating too. \n\nThis is a great place to meet friends, to have a relaxing time with coworkers after a long day, or even a great way to start date night.\n\nThe atmosphere is lively without being too loud and allows you to enjoy the views with good conversation. \n\nService is prompt with your orders and will accommodate your requests. \n\nThe View is definitely one place I'll be back to visit!", "author": "Ann S."}

No tip yet included. \n\nHow to find a seating here was the problem for us. We came here at 6pm on a Friday night. It seemed impossible to grab a seat but here is a tip on how to snatch a seat. We wanted a seat on the west side of the view to see the sunset. We went around the west side to see if there was any empty table, not seats but table. Once we found a table my friend just stayed at the table while I went around and looked for empty seats to grab them and bring it back to our table. I found two empty seats and brought it back to the table. So we created our space on a nice spot with a nice view of the city. All we had to do was wait for the sunset. \n\nOne thing that really will bug and annoy anyone who comes here for the drinks is that people will walk into your personal space and your table if you are sitting near the window with a nice view. Some will ask you politely while some will just waltz in. I even appeared in some of the selfies of some people because they didn't ask me to move and they just came into our table, stood in front of us in the window and just took the picture.

We got super lucky and only had to awkwardly loiter by a couple paying their check for a few minutes, but I could easily see spending ~30 minutes waiting.

The centerpiece of the lounge is a giant window opposite from the bar that offers a panoramic view overlooking the city, making for a pleasant lounging experience.  Drinks are priced on the higher end, but entirely reasonable given the views and upscale atmosphere. The cocktails that I sampled were quite tasty, and the squash hummus plate we ordered was also pretty good, presented nicely with roasted vegetables. \n\nService was rather slow, perhaps due to understaffing - it took ages to for someone to come clean up after previous patrons and for our server to come take our order. We noticed that she seemed to be the only server in our area, which was definitely insufficient given how busy the place was. To her credit, she was well-meaning and friendly, and once we did place our orders, our drinks and food came out swiftly.", "author": "Oliver L."}

Prior to coming here, I read many of the reviews about The View and was very hesitant to come here.  \n\nFound parking across the street in a public garage.  Costed us only $5 by the time we finished.  \nUpon entering the lounge, it was very dark and was full at the bar top and all the other lounge tables.  It is quite small I would say. Luckily for me, I stood around for about 10 minutes before a few people got up and I swooped in with my friends right in front of the window.  It was probably around 10:00 pm by this point.  Hands down I would not want to sit anywhere else in this lounge because of the view.  I noticed that people like to camp out for hours on dates, ect.  so I consider you lucky to even try to find a seat in front of the windows.  \n\nNow here is where my friends and I struggled:\n\nSaw a few servers coming around, but only to the same tables.  I wasn't sure if they had been understaffed or not.  We sat for about 20 minutes to see if anyone would take our order, waving around obnoxiously because servers just love that from customers... before my starving friend marched over to the bar to order drinks and apps there. May I mention no one cleaned off our table after we sat down...so that was a little gross.  The bartenders were extremely nice.  Our food was delivered after about 10 minutes which was pretty fast.

As to why visiting the SF, thats another story, occasionally I do suck it up and follow the stream.\n\nDuring our night of escapades, we wondered through the downtown area for a bar to start off the night. Randomly a friend of mine asked a complete stranger for a spot. He mentioned the View at the Marriott, the concept at any bar at a hotel didn't sound astonishing to me. But at this point, any bar would be great. Prior to this we have been walking for hours and no longer had any common sense left in me.\n\nSo as we dragged ourselves through downtown even more, we arrived to this lavish hotel. The main lobby was crowded with guests and tourists. Quickly jumped into an elevator that led to the 39th floor. The doors opened up to this huge dinning area. The interior was dimly lit with a bar right in the center. Couches and tables were spread over the area. But one thing that was most impressive was the view. You could see clear down to the east bay with the bridge lit up and sky scrapers blistering lights from the offices.\n\nIt was one of the few moments that I was truly impressed. No longer did I despise this great city or held any kind of resentment for visiting SF. The view was picturesque with elaborate glass windows that covered up to the high ceilings.

There were several semi-communal areas open, though none right at the windows. After sitting for 20 minutes or so, we saw a group leave their window seats and after ok-ing it with our sever, we moved that way. \n\nTHE CROWD: Pretty relaxed and quiet. There were a couple girls who'd gotten pretty drunk at the bar, one of whom hiked her skirt up until her underclothing (and basically most of her bottom) was showing; she was being pretty showy, laughing loudly with her friend, and taking some butt selfies. I saw several other customers glancing at her with kind of offended looks. I was surprised she wasn't at least politely asked by the staff to cover up or be a little more decent.\n\nTHE SERVICE: As the last time I came, pretty terrible.

Definitely a tropical vibe.\n\nSMALL PLATES: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-view-san-francisco-2?select=yfSF_CLrbloK-MA7ezLxIg#OzkWXngwWV4kem3e6lc_7g\n* Smoked Duck Breast Pastrami (chicories, winter citrus, medjool date puree. $12) - 3 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-view-san-francisco-2?select=yfSF_CLrbloK-MA7ezLxIg#u-EMNdjwCvIvdkZmxHYuGA\nWhile the slices of duck breast were thick and juicy, they were pretty lackluster as they were served cold on the salad and didn't have much of a smoked flavor. This was basically like the Organic Green Salad with a few slabs of meat thrown on top.\n\n* Ahi Tuna \"Poke Style\" (sesame crackers, seaweed salad. $16) - 4.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-view-san-francisco-2?select=yfSF_CLrbloK-MA7ezLxIg#e_FIQTby015rU9sFmPoDwQ\nDelicious! I'd swear that was smoked and not the Duck Breast above. The sesame crackers had a strong toasted flavor, and was a perfect complement to the tuna. I discovered the seaweed salad only in my last few bites, but that was a great addition too. To be a little picky, the fish did have a little bit of a heavy, slimy texture, but that's just me trying to find a small reason I'm not giving it 5 stars.\n\n* Organic Green Salad (winter citrus, candied pecans, redwood hill feta, black garlic vinaigrette. $8) - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-view-san-francisco-2?select=yfSF_CLrbloK-MA7ezLxIg#yfSF_CLrbloK-MA7ezLxIg\nThis is simple and has tried and true ingredients that work well together. I think the vinaigrette could've been a tad thicker, and there could be more orange slices to add that sweet acidity. If you feel like having a salad, this is a good one, but don't go out of your way to order it (especially since it's not super filling). \n\n* Smoked Beef Carpaccio (dijonnaise, fried capers, chives. $12) - 4.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-view-san-francisco-2?select=yfSF_CLrbloK-MA7ezLxIg#EJCY4orux02-yO4a7AXX_g\nI didn't expect to like this at all, but this was as fantastic as the Ahi Tuna! The meat was very soft, like a very tender prosciutto, and the smoked flavor was intense. It was further enhanced by the capers, dijonnaise, and chives (I don't even like capers normally!). \n\n* Slow Braised Pork Belly (braised daikon, miso glaze. $18) - 3 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-view-san-francisco-2?select=yfSF_CLrbloK-MA7ezLxIg#WYIlitw0x82xPvlvBTMTeg\nTwo of us shared the four small plates and it still wasn't enough for a full dinner. The only thing left on the menu that looked filling was the Pork Belly. It did its job of filling us up, but it was pretty lackluster. The pork belly pieces were thick and fatty, but being in a broth, they lost any crisp they once had. The broth was boring and just had tiny pieces of daikon floating around. It's just a weird dish because you don't really eat big chunks of pork belly with broth, and when you get through that you're left with this boring broth on its own. Maybe something as simple as a slice of bread would've made that last part more appetizing.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-23", "description": "Lo and behold, you enter the lobby of a decked out hotel called The Marriott. Inside you see glossed out walls of black and gold. Important people are here. People who wear fancy clothes and jackets made of materials that isn't the same as t-shirts or jeans. They probably even shower at least once a day. These are the elite. Walking in with less than $100 in your bank account could ruin you. Luckily, there's always The View.\n\nThe Chase\n\nIf you're skilled enough you can stare at the ground and rush towards the elevator to stab at the 38th floor button rapidly. As you stare awkwardly at the ascending floor numbers like we all do in elevators, you find relief when the doors open and within the frame of the elevator opening you see what can only be described as the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon. This is The View, the high rise bar and lounge on the top floor of The Marriott. \n\nDeco\n\nWith a large half circle window looking out to the city below this beautiful bar has no bad seat. Individual black chairs and mini sofas are placed strategically towards the windows. Small square tables are found closer to the interior of the lounge. The wall closest to the elevator contains a square black bar top where the bartenders reside. The bar wall is a mirror that allows each drinker to stare back out to the city between the spaces of bottled spirits. It's all very stylized design where simple is clean and open is all seeing.\n\nBartenders\n\nI wasn't too impressed with the bartenders. Though they did have knowledge of different cocktails you could tell they've grown complacent with the clientele coming through. They had a lackadaisical attitude when it came to service. Even when it wasn't busy they seemed more interested in their own conversations than the customers. Maybe I was expecting more than I should but I find it sad to see such a great place have such uninspired bartenders.\n\nPrice\n\nWhen you come to this place you think it will be very expensive but it isn't any different than the price menu of most of the bars in the city. That's still an average of around $15 per cocktail, $8 per glass of beer, and about $14 per glass of wine so it's still expensive but for the view you get of the city the price is a bargain.\n\nConclusion\n\nSan Francisco has so much to offer when it comes to bars and hotels. Without even trying you're bound to stumble upon a good one. But finding a bar that feels special even within Union Square, especially inside a chain hotel, is even better. The View has one of the most breathtaking outlooks to San Francisco and looks great during the day or at night. Though the service itself might be lacking, once you get yourself a cold drink you can soak up the city from an eagle's point of view and be king/queen for the day.", "author": "Sammy B."}

What makes this lounge so great is the beautiful view of the city! However, the whole lounge is indoors which I guess is better since it's usually so cold in SF. It's not exactly my definition of a rooftop bar since it's not an open patio-type rooftop lounge like Perch in LA, but it was still pretty nice. Come here if you're looking for a lounge with a classy vibe, on the quieter side. \n\nDrinks are on the expensive side since it IS a hotel lounge. I think cocktails were around $14 each. I tried a Moscow Mule which was slightly too tart for me but overall enjoyable. There's tables near the glass windows where you can really see the view, and there's other plush sofas which are comfy but farther from the window. Overall a good amount of seats. \n\nThe only thing I didn't like about this place was the weird lighting. It was abnormally bright in a lot of random sections in the lounge. Made the lounge seem a little tacky or cheesy.", "author": "Diana I."}

Although I can't say much about the food (I came right after the SF Beer Fest and was so full on brew and lunch), I can definitely vouch for the service and the view. \n\nI believe the View is on the 39th floor of the Marriott. The location is absolutely prime, as you can see as far as the eye can see. I had dinner the night before at the Cliffhouse and the view was terrible, as it was so foggy and you could barely see the ocean. However, the View has a perfect view of the city and the atmosphere is so quaint, I had such a lovely time.\n\nMy friend ordered an Anchor Steam on tap and also chips with a scallion dip. The chips weren't salty and the dip made for the perfect match with the chips. The dip was full of flavor and so made up for the lack of salt in the chips. The total came out to $15, which I think is decent for the view you pay for, along with the great service and food. \n\nOur waitress was very attentive and friendly. Everyone there is relaxed and there to have a good time. I could tell that not only would locals attend but also tourists went as well. The seating varies throughout the place, as there's some booths that go right next to the windows, but also L-shaped booths that are placed in the middle. I'm almost positive that, no matter where you sit, you are bound to get an amazing view of the city. The ceiling is a dome and the windows reach to the far heights of the ceiling, so you are get this amazing view of the sky and the city down below.\n\nDefinitely coming back to try more of the food, thank you so much Marriott! :)", "author": "Hannah C."}

Look up! There it is. We found this place on Yelp but couldn't find the entrance until we recognized the huge floor to ceiling window from the photos in the sky. The entrance is tricky and you need a key card to enter from any of the side entrances. Instead of walking all the way around we just found a nice southern lady and told her she would have good karma if she let us in, and she did lol! \n\nTake the elevator up to the 39th (?) floor and enter a dream world. Swanky, sparkly, sexy and just what you need after a long day at work. The atmosphere is dark and seductive and the SF lights draw your eyes in. This picturesque view is something I would recommend to anyone visiting the city. Don't be fooled by the Marriott (no offense Marriott, many that I have been in have not been very nice) \n\nThe drinks are a bit pricey $14-16. I got a organic prosecco, mixed berries, and st. german cocktail and was surprised to see if served in a rocks glass. Hello bucket of prosecco! The flavor was fresh and crisp, and our group loved it so much we went back again the next night. \n\nPerfect place for a view, a cheese plate, and frankly any cocktail off their list.

Located on the top floor of The Marriott hotel, it was a quick walk around the corner from our room at The Intercontinental. \n\nWe arrived around 6pm on a Friday and were lucky to grab the last open table. A waitress quickly came by to give us menus and take our drink orders. I felt the drink menu was very basic compared to the other cocktail bars we visited. When paying $16 for a drink, I want it to be slightly more complicated than what I can make at home. In this price range I should not see Bulleit and Captain Morgan on the menu. Alas, my Bulleit Old Fashioned was a basic Old Fashioned with bourbon, simple, and bitters. No different than what I make for myself almost nightly. \n\nWhatever. We came for \"the view\". See what I did there?\n\nFor food, the three of us split the charcuterie plate which was quite good. Then again, I don't think I've ever had a bad charcuterie plate.

The prices are high and the drinks are not impressive.\n\nI arrived after a formal event, so we fit right in. The drinks were $14 each and poorly poorly made. My friend ordered an Old Fashioned, which is what I would have gotten. They had an Dark and Stormy on the menu, so I figured I'd try that. My bartender was about to use a low ball glass for my drink. Dude, it's a Dark and Stormy, it belongs in a high ball. Then he starts shoving tons of chipped ice into the glass. These people obviously have no idea what they're doing. The glasses are also oddly shaped. They're oval on the bottom and stick out.

We were lucky to have a clear, beautiful San Fran night and the view of the city was spectacular.

The View's ambience of low lighting and low couch seating creates an intimate & casual vibe despite how crowded it is. \n\nWe had the most amazing server, Cindy. I can't rave enough about her. She had great suggestions on what to order and how much to order.  We ordered the Mezze, cheese display, spicy tuna dish, housemade chips and beer nuts. Every dish was a perfect blend of fresh flavors. Let me say, you'll never have a better potato chip than their housemade chips! They are seasoned lightly with truffled salt! The next day I ran out and bought a jar of truffled salt and put it on everything from fish to popcorn. Regular salt is so blas\u00e9 now! Needless to say, The View's chips have transformed my palate and cooking.  Oh, and their Bloody Mary's are pretty darn good, too.\n\nCindy surprised me with a chocolate \"congratulatory\" cake for my book win! I thought that was going above and beyond in customer service.

We were there for what we though would be an unforgettable night during our short vacation. This was up until our experience was ruined by a couple of terrible servers.\n\n We looked for a table because the lounge was packed. After looking for open table for two we had only stumbled upon a large booth. We felt bad so we asked a server (didn't catch her name) if we were allowed to sit there, being that it was the only open table. Rolling her eyes she replied back with a short and stern \"yes\" and walked away....okay. Brushing it off we sat down ready for some drinks. After 10 minutes of sitting, Darcie came over and said \"anything to drink?\" and that's it. No how are yous or hello my name is ____ (Name was taken from receipt). We tried to have conversation with her and even asked about recommendations but all we received back was one short answer. We ordered a couple of drinks and a few small plates which were actually good, but Darcie never once checked on us. \n\nTowards the end of our visit was the only time we saw her smile as she mentioned that it was the end of her shift and when she asked if she can close us out. As a server myself, I felt inclined to tip but really didn't want to because she literally did the bare minimum. I am only giving three stars because of the atmosphere and Conner who I believe is a busser there.

Getting the drinks, how long it took to get to us, and what really pissed me off was how many times I had asked for the check. After asking twice, and waiting for a very long 15 minutes, we decided to just leave and they'll close the tab on their own. As soon as we got up and started to look for the exit, the waiter ran up to us and printed us the check. He didn't even apologize to me, which led me to be hesitant to leave any tip at all. \n\nSo if you don't mind mediocre to borderline frustrating service, but love scenic views, then this is a really nice place to go to.", "author": "Quang H."}

Why does it take about 3 more tries and 20minutes for broken glass to be cleaned up? If I said \"law suit waiting to happen\" would cleaning up be faster?\n\n2) service: why are there only 2 people at the bar on a Saturday where there are about 60 people at the small little area? And why are non-bartenders in the area blocking them half the time? Not only is the service slow, the drinks were sloppy and not well made.

You do have options when it comes to parking, the Metreon is directly across the street and there are a handful of parking lots available for the public that's within walking distance.  \n\nWe walked into the lobby and easily found our way towards the elevators that has a sign directing us to the bar.  The elevator ride was fast, so fast that every other floor we had to stop for other passengers ( there was a ISSCC convention in one of their banquets) and I could only imagine it becoming a dizzy ride for those that get motion sickness. But when we arrived we were greeted by the spectacular view of San Francisco.  Upon entering the bar you're faced with a large window displaying Down Town San Francisco and the Bay Bridge. It was amazing and can only stress that one visits during the hours of sunset.  The vibe was classy.  The bar had a dark toned table with comfortable high chairs, while there were a few tables and a handful of chique sofas and couches for people to mingle on.  We found our way to two couch chairs and was quickly greeted by a waitress.  It was obvious that they place was starting to get busy since people were finding themselves moving from one table to a closer table towards the window but throughout our stay, she was prompt and attentive.  \n\nI ordered their skyline punch that was delicious and fruitful.  I wish I had the opportunity to grab another cocktail but I'll have to do so the next time I visit.

As the crush of people gets wors and worse, the lack of seating means you all stand in the middle of the walkways and everyone is forced to walk around, or you crowd onto uncomfortable ottomans and pretend you can hear each other.

It gets 5 stars simply because of the venue. As a bar it's 3.5 or 4. The seating is uncomfortable and if you're not there early then you'll be standing the whole time. Another great place is Top of The Mark. We were staying at the W so this was a short walk across the gardens. I wish they had a larger beer selection.", "author": "Jordan B."}

We stayed till closing time they turned the lights on bright and the waitress came and gave me the receipt (not the bill) as she charged our whole evening on my card.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-07-29", "description": "Geez.....what to say.  Ok, I've been here twice now (recently).\n\nThe first time we stopped by, we were drinking, nibbling, and having a nice time.  Well the waitress took my card and never came back with it.  Of course I also forgot because we were drinking up and partying down.  We were quite upset by the time I realized what had happened because my friends and I all left and travelled a bit downtown and then had to return.  The manager offered me 2 free drinks and an appetizer for the mix up.  That was sweet of him as he didn't have to do anything.\n\nWell, the second time we stopped by, we weren't sure if we were going to stay long other than to show a friend the views from the bar on top.  We ended up staying and advised the waiter of what happened and our little meal and drinks were to be comp'd.  Well, do you know they STILL required a credit card!  I'm thinking to myself \"God, this is what started this whole mess and why we're back.\"  That said, I was taken back.  If the manager is there and saying \"yes, we're comping their meal\", then why would we need to throw down a credit card?  So there's that.\n\nThat aside, the place was clean, the staff was friendly, efficient, and cleaned the tables quickly.  The views are particularly breathtaking BUT, be advised: when the place is full of tourists, the atmosphere and ambiance take a hit.  The reason: so many people do not have any manners or etiquette and they will walk into your seated area, get loud and point fingers in your face while you're sitting \"oh look! there's that....and there's that over there!....\" I had to pull tables together to create a barrier so cavemen and cavewomen would not enter our private area.  I can't even tell you how many times I had to snap at people and to remind them of where they were.  Oh and at night, it's worse!  In addition to dreadful manners and etiquette, you now have idiots attempting to take pictures AT NIGHT BEHIND GLASS and we're all subject to the flash along with the stupidity: \"Oh it didn't come out because of the flash on the glass.\"\n\nI would avoid at night and avoid the place when super busy and packed.  It's a shame because the food is good, the place is nice, and the staff are friendly.  It's the customers' behavior that drags the experience down.  There are a lot of places in town to capture skyline views, so don't place all your eggs in this basket.", "author": "Shaun W."}

Ultimately, this place is for their views of San Francisco. \n\nSwanky bar for anyone willing to spend some good amount of money. Valet parking for The Marriott is about $20-25 for an hour, which is convenient, but expensive. Parking downtown is expensive and takes an incredulous amount of patience. \n\nOnce you make your way up top, finding a table can also be tedious, but that depends on the day and time you go. Lastly, the price per cocktail is unbelievable. I ordered a couple Moscow Mules - for $15 a pop, I was expecting a copper cup and the fixings. Hell no. They brought that shit back in a bar glass, which is okay, I know I'm not going to die from not drinking a Moscow mule in a copper cup, but it'd be nice. So at this point, I realize you're paying $15 for the ambiance, not the cocktails.

Last time I was here was a Sunday evening and the vibe was very different. The place was completely packed this time and full of energy.

The sight of seeing the city of San Francisco from 39 floors is breathtaking.  My girlfriend and I decided to come here for a drink after dinner and we were not disappointed. The lounge is self seating and we were lucky enough to get a spot right in front of the window which gave us a nice view of the city as well as the Bay Bridge.\n\nWe ordered the Golden Gate (my drink) and the Skyline Punch (her drink).  I'm a huge whiskey fan and the Golden Gate was refreshing and packed with flavor.  I know whiskey can be overpowering to some but this drink is tasty without the strength that the whiskey can sometimes bring.  The ingredients in this drink include (Jameson, St. Germaine Cranberry and Ginger Ale). A really good combination in my opinion.  The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was just the icing on the cake. Sweet but not to sweet and creamy. \n\nI loved everything about \"The View\" from the drinks, to the desserts all the way to the ambiance.

To get those views from here definitely makes for a star-studded experience. I felt like I was on top of the world (a Leonardo DiCaprio moment from the Titanic kind of feeling). Scared of heights? Ummm, you may not want to come up here. I have to admit, I felt a little weak in the knees from being a little too far up. The views were spectacular though, so I forgot about my height fright. Drinks are a tad price, but don't let that deter you from going up there to experience these views. It will definitely help set the mood for whatever you are going there to accomplish. Date night? Why, of course! Go grab a spot in the corner and cuddle with sweetie! Big group? That's an easy one! There was a large booth with a huge table enough to fit about 8 people and even group of lounge chairs enough to accommodate your group. This place is grand and the view exhibits pure grandeur.

I arrived about 20 minutes after opening and the place was already jam packed. I'd hoped to squeeze myself in to the bar (always my favourite spot) so I could people watch, chat with the bartender, and read, but alas the bar was packed like sardines. Luckily, I found a chair tucked in a corner that I pounced on and enjoyed for a while.\n\nIt took quite some time to get service - despite the fact that before I sat down I checked with a server if it was table service or if I needed to order at the bar. When she did arrive I asked about happy hour, but I suppose I was mistaken as apparently they don't have one. I ordered my drink, a tasty cucumber gin mix that I quite enjoyed, and asked for a large glass of water as I was feeling the effects of several nights partying with too little sleep and a cold was creeping up on me! The drink arrived after a few minutes (I get it, they were slammed) but I had to remind the server about my water. \n\nI do admit I was slower drinking than usual - my book was reeeeally good, and having a cold coming on didn't encourage me to slam my fancy, and pricey, drink. But, for me, that didn't excuse the terse tone of the waitress as she came over and said \"do you like your drink? Because you're drinking it really slowly.\" There was no one waiting for my seat (it was on its own in a corner), and I certainly wasn't informed if there's a maximum time limit in which to finish a drink.\n\nI would come here again with a group as I could see it'd be great for a group hangout, but I can't say it was the best experience for me. 5 stars for the view, 4 for the drink, 2 for service.", "author": "Ayla C."}

The sliders were good but nothing to write home about especially at a ~$17 price tag. The drink was also not bad but $15?? It was so small that I didn't even get buzzed.......and I get buzzed really easily ahhah. Then we waited for like 30+ minutes for the bruschetta, and once we asked about it, it came out really quickly. So I'm pretty sure they just didn't put the order in or something. I don't blame the waitress, she seemed to be the only waitress working the whole area and it was really busy. They really should hire some more people. Anyway, the bruschetta was also alright.

Once exited from the elevators, it was like a standard bar with very little staff and some crowds. Someone was nice enough to inform my boyfriend a new section of the bar had opened up and we were seated next to the window for a wonderful view. We settled in and ordered drinks from the cocktail menu ($12-$18 each which is expected for a place such as this in the city). I absolutely love manhattan's and when mine arrived, it did not taste like a manhattan at all and I second guessed if I had just ordered my whiskey on the rocks. My friend's ordered some drinks as well and they were nothing to really rave about but tastier than mine for sure.\n\nAppetizers were next. Too many appetizers in fact because the amount of food in them was so small. My boyfriend ordered the pork belly and there was probably 4 actual pieces of pork surrounded by a whole bowl of onions and broth. The cheese platter and it's cheese selection were great though. We decided after some drinks and about five appetizers that it was time to ask for the check. \n\nWhen the bill arrived, it was $181.39. We threw in $140 cash and the rest was to be charged to my debit card. Our server, Don, returned to inform me he somehow hadn't seen the cash (despite us saying \"cash first please\") and had charged the entire amount to my card. No worries though, he had rectified it and issued a return and I was only to be charged the accurate $41.39 + subsequent tip. I am specific here because this is where the food and drink experience got worse for me. I leave the restaurant adding $10 tip on my card and a good amount of additional cash. $51.39 signed to be charged. It is now July 7 and 3 days after being at the bar this is how my debit account currently looks:\n- $181.39\n- $51.39\n- $41.39\n\nYes folks, I was in fact charged three times over 48 hours. The only authorized amount I should have been charged was $51.39. The best part is that the $51.39 and $41.39 were charged on July 6 - two days after I went to the lounge.\n\nI have called today and spoken with the hotel and it's finance department. They can \"do something in 6-8 days\" if my bank \"can not handle it.\" I was informed to call my bank to dispute the charges because it is easier for them for me to handle their mess than to issue an immediate refund. The best part is they noted they saw the multiple charge errors in their system but it was my duty to get this fixed. How very fun for me! I have spent over an hour today trying to get almost $225 of unauthorized charges off of my account because staff members thought they could just keep charging my card for the same transaction but in alternate amounts!\n\nLet me add, I have worked with high-end restaurants for 8+ years. I know good food, good craft cocktails, and most importantly good service so I am not a person that doesn't understand the efforts here for the dining experience. The restaurant is designed impeccably down to the china and the attention to detail is very good. The service was just beyond inadequate on my visit. If you go here, go only for the view, expect to be amazed very little by anything but it, and bring cash only because they clearly have not been trained on how to properly work a computer. Utterly ridiculous and absolutely shitty customer service after the fact!", "author": "Holly M."}

However, what we did see was beautiful, and if I lived in the city I would come here often just to stare at that view.\n\nThe lounge offers sharing plates, and a lovely wine and cocktail menu. I opted for the Soma Spritzer with Prosecco, St Germain and fresh berries. It was totally simple, refreshing and divine.

It is a bit pricey so can not do this every weekend but definitely a place to treat your date or a special friend. I went here on Saturday afternoon to see the view of SF from 39th floor! The huge arched windows are totally gorgeous and the view through it is amazing. Just be careful where you sit, there are 4 sections, each section offering a different view. There are different kinds of seats available too, normal dining table to high chairs, and sofas.\n\nThe cocktail and wine list is impressive, they even have a good New Zealand white on the list too! I had the Moscow Mule, made with vodka and ginger beer, it was a superb refreshing blend for a warm summer afternoon. \n\nThe staff are super friendly and courteous, willing to offer a helping hand with suggestions if you ask. There was only one woman who came with her kid, thankfully the kid was behaving himself. This is in a touristy hub, so expect people requesting their picture to be taken.\n\nThe men's restroom only has one urinal and one stall, there is a sofa out in the aisle for waiting though. The bathroom were clean but it was a little disorderly towards the later part of the night. It didn't stink, so that gets a thumbs up from me.\n\nI live in the East Bay, can see myself being a regular here for special date nights or treating a friend for birthdays or other events!", "author": "Sunny E."}

We got the tuna tartare, pork belly lettuce wraps and vanilla bean creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. They were alllll yummy and better than I expected. \nI loved the atmosphere. The lounge is dimly lit and has a very warm feel. It can be loud unless you find a seat in the corner, so it can be good for a big crowd or even a date night. It was a diverse crowd where there were young couples being all cute and lovey dovey in the corner but also a group of elders celebrating a birthday with balloons, birthday hats and popping bottles lol. \nThe service was amazing. Despite being busy, every time we ordered a new round of drinks they came quick. \nOnly downfall is it can get packed and finding a decent seat to enjoy the view(which I'm sure is the main goal of everyone coming here) and not standing around can be difficult.

The strategy is to hover over people that may be leaving soon and swoop in while they are getting up.\n- their food options sucked They sucked so bad that I ordered the house potato chips.

We actually arrived at the hotel around 3:50 and waited until it opened at 4:00 to get in. Trust me this was a great idea as around 15 minutes after it opened, tons of people showed up to get seats.\n\nWhy was it so busy you ask? Let me tell you. This view is INCREDIBLE. You can see both the East Bay as well as the north depending on where you sit. And there isn't a bad seat in the house, except maybe at the bar because then you're not taking advantage of the view (and I don't know why that wouldn't be your first priority any way). My boyfriend and I ended up picking the table that was in the center of the view, just as you walk in. But there are lounge couches, hight tops and other seats galore to sit at all around the restaurant (which was quite large). \n\nThere's a very sophisticated, sleek vibe to the place. Everything is very modern in terms of the decor and furnishings. \n\nThe prices I think are reasonable for a rooftop place, but a little expensive if you're expecting just casual restaurant prices. However, the drinks are delicious. I had a Skyline Punch, which was fruity and strong. We also ordered the cheese plate, which was a great accompaniment to our drinks.\n\nThere is no way I won't be coming back.

We already felt an unwelcoming bad vibe and sensed Yordi staring us down, along with a forced smile. Tried to order one beer, she said(and I quote) \"Based on my judgement, I can't serve you because you've had too much to drink\" This is by the most outrageous shit I've ever heard. After coming out of work you would think a glass of beer would be acceptable. I kindly asked what makes you say that because we did not have one sip of alcohol.\" She turns to my friend and said has the nerve to say \"you look drunk.\"  Well yeah, what do you expect? after sitting 20 minutes admiring the god damn beaming sun, that tends to happen LOL. Mind you, we are all adults, 23 to be exact. We weren't loud, or causing any scene. We spoke to the \"manager\", and she of course sided with Yordi. She felt as though we were going to be a liability of hurting ourselves. Quite absurd, you know what is a liability?! if one of those damn purple, bootlegged acrylics of hers were to fall into someone's food. Didn't bother arguing any further, just asked for the check. Paid for the wings, and based on MY judgement, I left no tip. Not to mention, as we left, there was a group of drunken loud guys on the other side, with about 6-7 drinks. \n\nSo before you order any drinks, make sure you don't gaze too long in the view because you might end up burnt or \"drunk looking\" Maybe it was the fact we looked the youngest out the crowd.

We came to have an excellent time and all we got was a lack of service and a menu that listed about 7 items. Not a place I would recommend. Go for the view, snap some pictures and leave. Seating is first come first serve so we ended up essentially fighting for an open table while we waited for a group to leave.  As we finally got our seat we waited for a very long time and still no one came to even clean the table let alone take our order. We ended up leaving after about 15 minutes with out anyone noticing. \n\nVery disappointing.", "author": "Z C."}

It's not like any of the NYC or LA rooftops, but this is SF, so The View is as close to it as you'll get.\n\nAs it's located inside the Marriott, the crowd is mostly tourists and out-of-towners. I think this place has potential -- maybe with a different crowd, though. Maybe they can turn up the volume of their speakers? Maybe they can hire sexier looking staff? (They very much look like hotel employees.) Maybe they can update their menu with some interesting cockails? (I mean, it's SF!)\n\nI was also surprised at how not spacious it was -- I actually thought the venue would be a lot larger and more open, too. Food did not look appetizing at all, so we didn't even consider it. Drinks were just 'meh' and overpriced, as you'd expect. Service wasn't too bad, though, despite it being packed.\n\nEntrance to get inside was also a bit difficult to find. I wish they would just let everyone in from the side entrance (close to Tropisueno).\n\nBased on this experience, I can see why locals don't really come here. I would probably opt to go to the Press Club instead (which is what we did right after our first drink).", "author": "Diana K."}

And when I got here, I was definitely not disappointed. There are huge, nicely designed windows that provide an amazing view of the city and they face different directions so you can see different parts of SF. We got there around 8PM on a Monday so there were still several seats along the windows that weren't taken. It was already dark outside by then so we could see all the city lights. The seats are all soft and leathery sofas and were so comfortable. Needless to say, the place is quite classy with dim lighting and all, and most of the people there were significantly older than us.\n\nThe drinks and service were pretty good, but still can't compare to the location and ambience of the place. I ordered the fruity punch cocktail and it was strong but quite sweet. The drinks are very expensive but you're also paying for the view, which is worth it. Our server was pretty attentive and didn't forget about us, even though we kind of in a corner. I'd definitely like to come here again sometime.", "author": "Kailin H."}

We finished them fairly quickly but our server never came back to give us a bill. After waiting for 45 mins, we decided to get up and find him instead only to have him rush towards us and condescendingly tell us that we shouldn't be running out on our bill...It was busy and maybe he didn't want to rush us but we could've been spared the speech.

I've always enjoyed coming to top floor bars and restaurants in pretty much any downtown high-rise.  There's something about being \"above it all\" and \"having the world at your feet\" that kind of boosts the ego!  There's also always something out there to enjoy and talk about that just seems to help stimulate the conversation, and the moment.\n\nOn this particular early evening, we had an awesome view as the fog rolled in from the west (of course), while the sun was still shining brightly over the Bay, AT&T Park, the Bay Bridge, etc.  Check out the photo I've uploaded.\n\nService was attentive . . .  we scored a table next to the window . . . and . . . the drinks were well prepared.  The View is a great place to take in a drink during a quick HH.  It does have a hotel lounge type atmosphere rather than a \"real\" bar . . . but I'd say this is a solid 4-star spot.

It was propped right up on the 39th floor, nothing like Boston's 54th floor restaurant but good enough lol. This place gets packed and they don't do reservations, it's a first come first serve type of deal and although there is plenty of seating, they were not satisfying enough for our viewing pleasure. But my cousins eventually settled for some seats in the the next room. My other cousin and I were determined to get better seats. We noticed that a group of older businessmen had the best seats in the house. As my cousin and I stood near the bar eyeing the scene like sad puppy dogs hoping someone would leave soon so we could get better seats, the waitress approached us. She basically told us that the businessmen were calling us over to sit with them so we approached the table anxiously not knowing what we were walking into, when we approached them, one of the guys said to me, \"we are done here and we just wanted to save the best seats in the house for the most beautiful ladies in the house, enjoy your evening\" and they left gracefully. We were so elated and lucky lol. I ordered appetizers and drinks and gazed at the view before me. I had the crispy salt and pepper shrimp and the view trio, I enjoyed both plates but I loved the crispy salt and pepper shrimp, it was so good! I also had the skyline punch, it was a little too strong for my liking since I'm more of a wine girl but anyone who is a lush would appreciate how strong they make their drinks.

Even as a girl born and raised in the Bay Area, the view of San Francisco all lit up at night is still breathtaking (even if gimmicky).

I like martini's because they're stronger and not filled with ice and really you can't go wrong with it unless it's terrible vodka or something... the salt and pepper prawns (or shrimp?  what's the difference?) was pretty good for a non-asian \"restaurant\", and we got this other plate of fried stuff--with green beans (yes green beans), onions, calamari, other stuff... and there was this really strong lemon dipping sauce that tasted like they deep fried a lemon.  Really.  It was so-lemony.  \n\nChocolate cake was, well rich but not sooo fresh you want to die.  You'd probably expect them to serve a bit of ice cream on the side but instead there was whipped cream.  And a neatly trimmed strawberry, no greens, and sliced in half.  And, the mint.  If the cake is too dry eat the icing... with the chocolate flakes... don't we all love cake.\n\nI would say, this isn't the best date \"date\" spot, because the dates I saw here looked really awkward... come on.

I'm all about paying more for a good drink but these were terrible - little alcohol and the flavors were whatevs. \n\nDESSERT: Well, Niki was having \"girl issues\" (TMI) so she was craving chocolate.

It was like a dream...  maybe.\n\nWe didn't have reservations so we pretty much waited until a table was free.  We probably waited about 20MIN.!?  It didn't seem long though.  Maybe because I was busy admiring the view.  Anyway, we sat right by the window!! :)\n\nThere wasn't very many things on the menu.. not really big meals but appetizers, drinks, and dessert which was cool.  We ordered the ahi (of course!!) and the salt and pepper shrimp (which were good) and drinks.  We got our drinks pretty fast but we were wondering why our food was taking forever so we asked our waiter and he was like... \"Omg, I forgot to put it in.. I'll do that now and I'll pay for it\"  Hmm.. I was more happy than mad considering we pretty much got our food for free.  So thank you, waiter.  That's excellent customer service for ya!!  Even though that happened, I will be back for sure the next time I'm in town.", "author": "Criselle O."}

Hmm apparently NOT on a Wednesday night. I thought perhaps it would be quieter midweek evening but some rowdy business conference people were there to get drunk and talk loud. It was not a intimate place- even in the darker corners with window views, sounds echo loudly and if that wasn't enough, you could barely hear your own train of thought through the cloudy of club music blaring in the background (probably why the drunk people had to shout their conversation- to overcome the music.) \nThe view- well, it's not Portrero Hill, you can see the starting edge of the bay bridge on the far side, you can see the MOMA, the W and the brightly lit Yerba Buena from an aerial view. But it's not a stunning sunset and skyline of the city.\nYou want a typical hotel bar, close and convenient to your hotel room, club music with no dance floor, typical uncreative cocktail menu, lack of interesting bar bites... then this the place for you! \nThe wait staff was nice, the drinks ok (in a place like this, I skip the mixed cocktails and get my bourbon neat, can't really mess that up), the prices included the charge for the view, the itself was only alright, but the ambiance- cut out the club music. \nPS. The woman's bathroom looked deconstructed- exposed plywood covering an opening where possibly the where the old paper towel dispenser was. That's classy.", "author": "Naomi K."}

It could possibly be a decent location for a date, too, as long as your date doesn't mind having to constantly walk around searching for an open table for a good 30 minutes on busy nights.\n\nGo here if you're mainly here for the amazing view, though. Food and drinks are good, but nothing spectacular.\n\nSince you can't get reservations here, you're going to have to either go up to a group and kindly ask if you can have the table after them (Don't make them feel rushed, though) or you and your guests are going to end up standing around lurking at different tables and trying to swoop on whichever ones become vacant.\n\nAlso, this place isn't as big as how it looks in some of the photos people have posted. So don't expect it to be very spacious, it'll be crowded depending on what time and day you go.

If a place has a top-floor restaurant or bar, we'll probably go there just to check out the view.  For some reason, it's one of those things we just love to do no matter where we visit.\n\nOf course, we had to visit The View because the Yelp reviews promised excellent views of San Francisco (and this was the hotel where Alex Trebek was injured while chasing a burglar... hilarious).  The restaurant/bar is easy enough to access - just cross the lobby of the hotel and go to the 39th floor.  \n\nThis place seems like it could get pretty crowded, especially on weekends, but Sunday night was just right.  One side of the bar had waiter service and the other did not so keep that in mind on slower nights.  We found a cozy table for two right by the window (other side of the bar) and we ordered our drinks from the bar.  \n\nThe drinks are pricey (and so is the food) but you're paying for the view.  My husband absolutely LOVED the Manhattan that he ordered and my cocktail was pretty delish.  Cocktails run $12-$15 each so be prepared.  Beer is $7-$8 depending on what you order, so don't plan on drinking too much.  \n\nThe views of the city are excellent.  Since SF isn't a very tall city, 39 stories up is plenty high to see everything.  If you sit on the bar side, you'll get a great view of the Bay Bridge; other side and you'll look out onto City Hall and Coit Tower.  Go here for a drink just for the view.

There is an area of the lounge with fireplaces. People are dressed business casual to cocktail attire to typical San Francisco casual (bummy look).

However, not all of the seats in the lounge get to share in that view, which is a bummer if you go there hoping to watch the sunset or something. So if you go on a Friday night without reservations (if they even take reservations), you'll probably be squeezed somewhere else in the lounge, away from the view. And if Karl the Fog is in town, no such view really exists. The lounge is fine. It's dimly lit, a little noisy, but a typical after work spot. We got appetizers and drinks: a bruschetta (really tasty), Moscow mule, and an old fashion. The drinks are standard, nothing too special. But they are pricy. Overall, likely because this is in a hotel, it didn't feel like authentic San Fran, which is what I love about San Fran. It was an okay spot, nothing special.

She came back and took our orders: 5 fancy $10+ signature cocktails and a bottle of champagne. We waited about 10 minutes or so, until she came back to retake our order....

Not sure if he was a manager trying to help his incompetent wait staff or what...\n\nDrinks finally arrive and they were not worth the wait. I generally do not like ice in my drinks because I hate the way it tastes when they start melting and watering it down.... And that's exactly what this was. The drinks had obviously been made a while ago and had been sitting at the bar waiting for the waitress to get them (which leads me to believe she put the order in the first time and that's when they were made).\n\nExpected more from what appeared to be an upscale spot, but they really need to hire more waitstaff. Our server was so frantic and flustered; her hair was falling out of her bun and she just looked disheveled. I want my waitress to look put together and confident and she didn't convey that at all.\n\nAlso they were playing top 40 music in the background but it was SO quiet we could barely hear it.

I noticed the kitchen was open to this place until 11pm, and i wanted to check out what the fuss was all about.\n\nI walked in the place around 930 and there were hardly any seats not taken. There were already people comfortable and looking like leaving soon wasnt an option for the seats near the window. So i found myself a seat at the bar. Still a nice view and right in the center for good people watching.\n\nThe decor was like any city lounge. Low/ dim lighting, back ground top hits, comfortable seats and decent drinks. Since this place was on the top floor of a lavish Marriott the prices were alittle high, but besides that the service was good and the bartenders were always around.\n\nI ordered the mac and cheese and the angus burger. The burger was juicy and well cooked, but i could have done without the mac and cheese. The bitter cheese crumbs on top of the dish would have been alot better left in the kitchen.\n\nOverall this place is pretty cool. You dont need to even leave the hotel to have a good time and you have a great view.

Although it was a bit crowded on a Friday evening, my friends and I were able to snag a couple of seats near the giant windows that overlook Civic Center. If you go around dinner time there are children and families, but as it gets later an older, calmer crowd comes in, creating a perfect, relaxed atmosphere for some good ol' conversation. The waiter was very accommodating and gave us plenty of time to go through the menu. \n\nIf you have a sweet tooth like me, I would recommend the creme brulee - absolutely delicious! I knocked off one star because I ordered a white russian that was way too strong and pretty much undrinkable (it was like one huge shot of vodka mixed with milk).

We arrived on a Wednesday night, but it was rather late (and we were famished).  The ambiance was fantastic; dark, not too quiet (a nice hum of conversation, but nothing on the disruptive side).  Of course, the view out the window was incredible.  May have been the alcohol highlighting the bit of vertigo, but it almost felt like we were OVER the city.  An absolutely unobstructed view, where you can see the MOMA, and other SF area landmarks.  \n\nThe menu was pretty extensive as far as appetizers go, and my friend and I ordered the Tuna Tartare.  It was perfect... and I will definitely go back for drinks and appetizers...\n\n...but not for dinner...\n\nDon't misunderstand-- dinner was excellent, but the menu (entrees), was limited to only a few items... like FIVE.

I tried to call in advance, but was told seating is first come, no reservations taken. \n\nThe venue itself is not too small, a fairly decent intimate size. The ambiance consisted of dim lighting and constant chatter. There is various seating styles, from low seating directly next to the larger than life windows, bar style high seating slightly removed from the windows (perfect for those that go with people afraid of heights...as was my experience), and sofa like seating that was removed from the window view but allowed for a more comfortable, relaxed seating. \n\nWe arrived around 9:30ish and the place was already semi packed. People are willing to push to get \"their\" seats, which was our case but definitely not necessary. When you arrive from the elevators, go to your right (for the main entrance) and the views are definitely better; however, seating was scarce and didn't allow \"the view\" experience. So we walked around to the other side and found bar table seating. It is extremely intimate and allows for conversation with privacy. \n\nThere is really only one waiter for the entire venue, so if he approaches have what you want ready to order. The bar table allows for minimum items, so if you're planning to eat and drink with a group you may want to consider seating with bigger table space. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the ginger pear and blood orange drinks, the ginger pear was the best of the two...both good flavor and I did not feel like it was watered down. Small plates were ordered, we tried the prawn & BBQ pork fried rice (tasty, but hard to share), salt & peppered prawns (a definite must to try...my favorite), and calamari (which had great flavor). \nEach item is priced at $15, but is enough to be shared with another person and I left full by the end of the evening. \n\nThis is definitely a place I would select to unwind and just hang out. Dress attire is not specific and the ages of guests ranged from legal to grandparent so the environment is definitely appropriate for all. The service was fairly fast once you ordered, the food hot and maintained a high quality, and our waiter was chill and accommodating.", "author": "Angela M."}

When I questioned this, having been to many fancy and expensive hotel and other bars/restaurants for the occasional splurge over the years without ever being asked to provide a payment method in advance--really, never--I was told \"yeah, we get written up if we don't.

We ordered the Filet Mignon and Frito Misto (calamari, green beans, lemon, fennel, red onion, and chipotle aioli). I also ordered an alcoholic eggnog drink that our waiter recommended. It took a longg time for our food to come out. My drink came out first, and it was okay... I had the same drink a week ago at a friend's place, and his eggnog drink tasted better. My friend tried a little, and she thought it tasted like cough syrup haha. The Frito Misto finally came out, and because this place is SO DARK INSIDE, I couldn't tell what I was eating most of the time. Everything was lightly deep fried but in different shapes. It was so hard to see sometimes that I even accidentally ate a slice of lemon. The Filet Mignon came out as soon as we finished the Frito Misto. It comes with mac&cheese which was pretty good. I would have enjoyed it more if it was more cheesy. The plate also came with super long and thin broccoli which were pretty good too.

It's open after 4 pm every day (the elevator going up to the 39th floor does not work before then).  The best part of the place is definitely the view.  There are plenty of tables around the entire floor, each offering a different view of the city.  I recommend going soon after the lounge opens, because the tables next to the windows fill up quickly.  Bring your camera because you'll want to take pictures, especially around sunset.\n\nThe drinks are a bit expensive ($14 for a martini).  The key is to go there during their happy hour (4-6 pm), when four different martini's are $7.  I've enjoyed every martini I've tried there so far.\n\nAs for food, their antipasto platter is quite good if you want an appetizer to share.  It's $14 for 2 people, which is pricey, but you're basically paying for the view.

I had a non-alcoholic \"Sunrise Spritz\" which was very good (orange juice, lime juice, grenadine, and sierra mist). The flavor was there, and it was actually a good sized drink, which I appreciated. We got the \"View Trio\" which is many slices of pita bread along with 3 dipping sauces (tomato relish, baba ganoush, and hummus). The first two were GREAT, with the hummus being a sad 2nd runner up. But, I appreciated the actual quality of flavor in the dips and how the pita bread was warm and soft.\nAlso, to mention, the staff at The View are extremely friendly and accommodating.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-24", "description": "This is the bar and lounge at the top of the San Francisco Marriott. In many ways, it's pretty typical of a hotel bar in any nice hotel in any major city, however, as its same suggests, its view is simply amazing. From its lofty perch, you can see all around the Bay Area and because the Marriott is just south of Market Street, you have a sweeping view of the downtown heart of the city. As Jay B. also noted, you'll meet professionals and business-types here, understandbly, and not too many locals. What is great about this bar, aside from the view, is it's not too loud and it can be romantic or business-like predicated on what attitude and what company you bring to it. I brought a friend of a friend whom I'd been fixed up with for dinner (more business than pleasure, networking or whatever) here and she loved it: she was visiting from Wales and it provided her with a rather unique introduction to the city. Kari S. was right about the Manhattans, by the way, and most any typical, standard, drink they'll do a yeoman's job on here.\n\nIf I ever had a television show about my crazy life as a student in SF, anyone who had a short meditation on the events of the episode would, at the end of the episode, wind up here having a drink.

We huddled around a tiny 2-person table while scanning the room, waiting for someone else to leave. In my opinion, they should seat people since they serve food. Yes, it is a bar-type setting, but with this many people looking for a place to sit, something must be done. The whole time, I felt like I was being watched by people who were lurking... waiting... for my seat. \n\nThe martini's are half price during happy hour. So, I can see why it's so packed. They were $7 and they were nice and strong. I even branched out and tried two of their fancy martinis and they were still strong. The bartender was very nice but we were not asked once if we would have liked to order food by a waitress.\n\nThe view is spectacular. When you look out any of the windows, you truly feel as though you are IN San Francisco.

There were 3 bartenders and they clearly could not care less about the customers. After finally getting the attention of one bartender and ordering my drink he left for a good ten minutes. When he came back he didn't apologize or even make my drink when he got back, I had to order again. I noticed that all the bartenders had their backs to the customers most of the time (not super professional) and moved at a super slow pace. When I went back to get another drink, I watched them walk around and pour drinks for other people and walk past me like I was invisible. I finally got his attention and was told \"we're kind of closing up here\" even though I had just seen him pour drinks for other customers. Not so cool.\nI will admit that the drinks are delicious and the view is amazing, but I may not go back after that experience.", "author": "Cristina D."}

Not surprising for a hotel bar, but it's just so painful because with the right care and talent, the experience could be magical. \n\nStick to the wine, cheese plate and pay in cash to avoid having to wait for the slow-as-molasses servers, and drown in the magnificent views.", "author": "Ligaya T."}

Soothing ambiance over low-keyed rhythmic beats surrounded by cougars lounging on plush couches where silver foxes are standing by to get snagged.\n\nBesides that, you can find a very mixed crowd anywhere from their early 20s up to their retirement 60s both either sporting the latest fashion trend or decorating themselves like polyester is back.\n\nCome here with a special someone and you'll definitely get lucky afterwards.  All your troubles will go away as you gaze out the many windows rotating 360 degrees overlooking the handsomely lit city. Talk about anything and everything, the timing will always be right.

Still only 1-star.\n\nI've been here three times, and service has always been... meh. But after my most recent visit, I would rate service as \"poor.\" The server completely forgot us on a *very* slow Tuesday afternoon. I had to get up from my table and go find her. Twice.

The lattice work on the windows is reminiscent of the Empire State Building. The service leaves a lot to be desired. After 15 minutes of waiting, we still couldn't get the waitress to stop for us so we ordered at the bar. The drinks were not very good at all. The decor inside is pretty standard for a generic hotel in the 90's. This place has so much potential, but even with all of the negatives, I will definitely be back and I will be bringing others. The view was really worth it and if you can manage to snag one of the tables, its a great place to linger with friends.

Located in SOMA on top of a fairly tall building, the 360 degree views really could not get better.

Everything is a bit pricey, but the view is worth it every once in a while.\n\nBest of all, it doesn't seem to have been discovered by many tourists (other than those living in the hotel downstairs).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-18", "description": "This place called The View for a reason because it is located on the 39th floor of the Marriott hotel. It's food is not as good as you would expect but what more can you ask from a restaurant located that high up. They ran out of jalape\u00f1o chips when I was there but I had it before. They were great.\nThe food is expensive for what it's worth though. Three small desserts will cost $10 and the said jalape\u00f1o chips were $5 for a small plate of kettle chips with some jalape\u00f1o ranch sauce. Their drinks are good, both alcoholic and non alcoholic. They have \"mocktails\" which are non alcoholic cocktails and those were good and worth the money. I believe it was $4 but it might be $7. \nAside from the food, the view makes up for it. Imagine you're in a helicopter hovering at one spot high up above the street looking down at the city with its straight roads running right under you. From that height, you are able to see the mountains and houses of South San Francisco as well as the Embarcadero, and the Port of Oakland, not to mention the Bay Bridge. You can also see the roofs of many buildings in the city. Because this place opens at 4:00pm, if you stay long enough you will even be able to witness the fog rolling into the city from the behind the mountains. The view is exhilarating hence its name \"The View.\" Come here for the view and the experience, not for the food.\nThe staff are nice though, they're awesome.", "author": "Ryan C."}

The crowd was mix, early hipster wanting to get a vodka redbull, couples (like us) enjoying the vibes, businessmen and conventioners losing their ties to shop talk,  and everyone in between all vying for the coveted seats and tables.  We found a table right next to the bar, completely crowded.  The server was real nice.  I had to turn on my \"Get Fresh\" charm!  The Jennifer was tasked with spotting any open tables by the window!

You can't deny the location is exceptional.\n\nHowever, there isn't much else the place has going for it.  Our waiter didn't say hello until a good 20 minutes after we sat down (self-seating when we were there on a Saturday night), even though he was attending to some neighboring tables.  He finally came to clear away the used glasses from the previous group, and seemed on a mission to utter as few words as possible to us.  I guess I'd be angry too if I had to wear a lame uniform all day long.  My friend wanted a recommendation on a very sweet and fruity drink - the lemondrop she got didn't fit that bill and was poorly crafted.  My mango mojito was lackluster and weak.  He delivered us the bill after a while without even asking if we wanted to order more drinks...not exactly what I'd describe as hospitable.\n\nDidn't get any food, but I glanced at their appetizer menu.  Shrimp cocktail was something like $15-20 and from the looks of neighboring tables that ordered it, not worth it.\n\nSo, you're paying a premium for the view, but if you're looking for good cocktails or good food, try elsewhere.  Maybe I've been spoiled by the amaaaazing mixed drinks crafted at certain SF bars (e.g. Bourbon & Branch), but 10-15 bucks for what tastes worse than something I threw together at home isn't acceptable.

The staff was cold with a pompous attitude which was confusing to me because it's just the Marriott.\n\nAlong with rude staff I will add nearly incompetent staff as our server could never remember what we ordered (group of 5), was always blaming the bartender for STILL not having the drinks ready (20 min passed) and had to redo our bill 3 times because she couldn't get it right.  Something you should know about this place is that even if you spend $12 for a glass of wine they put a $50 \"hold fee\" until they process all of their charges later...then the $38 is taken away and the $12 that you actually spent remains.  I know this sounds absolutely nuts...and it is...but they act like it is the most normal thing in the world and ALL hotel bars do it (not so).\n\nThat's it for the rant.

At times they can be great and professional, at other they are really aggressive to get you to a table instead of having you order at the bar only to be obviously annoyed when you only order coffee!  \"Yeah, I thought I could have carried it over the table myself too!\" \n\nYet the view is unbeatable!  It offers both a perspective granting view of San Francisco facing south and the \"tourist view\" facing north (which is a great display of Yerba Buena Gardens, the MOMA, Embarcadero Center, and the Bay Bridge).  \n\nThe drinks are stand prices.  And the appetizers are tasty.  For 14 bucks, the cheese plate is good for two or three.

Given his slow pace of making cocktails, you'd think we were doing him a favor, and it's not like a $48 bottle was a small tab, either. Unscrew the cork, serve. \n\nAnyway, once we brought the bottle and two glasses to our table, things seemed to be pick up, but that was really due to Mother Nature. You really want to get here around sunset to fully take in the surrounding view of the cityscape, as dusk begins to settle. Whether you're visiting or live in San Francisco, the Millennium Falcon-like vantage is admittedly hard to beat. \n\nBut then we fiNished the bottle. We tried to flag down a waitress again. No such luck. Went to the bar, had to wait another 5 minutes (at a bar which was really not that busy anymore), only to be given another gruff 'tude from the bartender. Excuse us for trying to pay the bill. With service like that, keep me posted on how \"the view\" is from the unemployment line.", "author": "Nish N."}

The view was beautiful! The service was nowhere to be found. We were there for probably 40 minutes or so and the whole time no one ever came by to pick up the glasses and dishes left on our table by the previous party, and no one ever asked us if we wanted to order drinks. So basically we spent the time just sitting, chatting, and enjoying the view without ordering anything.

It's dark, cozy, upscale, and traditional. The comfortable chairs and stools, the candlelight, the professionalism of the staff, and the drinks that are served, all create the perfect environment. This type of environment is the supreme catalyst for completing the ultimate assignment.\n\nThat assignment, is to get laid.\n\nIt is not Mission Impossible here. It is the EASIEST place in the city to get this done. I've seen and been involved with more 'tang being pulled out of here than in a warehouse at NASA. The hotel is mostly full of convention attendees and tourists. This is the first, last, or only place they ALL go. Keep it simple and stay away from the tourists. The tourists are not going to be easy cuz they have agendas, plans, and time constraints. They want to go places and do things. They are here for the view and nothing else.\n\nGo after the convention attendees. They are easy to spot. Some still have their badges on. That means you already know their NAMES! It doesn't get any easier, gentlemen. They have nothing to do, other than go to their seminars. They need to stay close to their hotel, so they are never late to a meeting, function, workshop, or trade show. They already have a ROOM! \n\nIf they smoke, you smoke. I don't CARE if you don't smoke, it's not about that. The elevator trip down is your first shot at one-on-one conversation with no competition. The time spent outside is what you need to clear the way to a room invite. The elevator up to the room is for building sexual tension. If they don't smoke, then you NEED to move toward the idea of a little fresh air. The scenario will play out the same way.\n\nThis place serves very strong, adult cocktails. Your target will not be used to the potency of these drinks, and won't have the tolerance for them. These are professional, career-minded women. Some are married, some have families, ALL of them have taken the necessary measures to be properly groomed for traveling, and NONE of them will see you coming.\n\nYou may get lucky and find the one that actually goes to these conventions with the intent of getting laid while they are \"away on business\". Those types are out there my friends, and chances are they are here, at The View. If you run into that one, it will be the best lay of your life.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n1 star for the view.....half the reason they landed in your \"trap\".\n1 star for the cocktails.....REAL stiff - like you will be in room 3308.\n1 star for the environment.....it creates the perfect sex storm.\n1 star for the staff.....if you don't get laid, they will.\n\nFor any ladies that were listening.....the convention men are even more eager to take you to their room - and you can probably score a little extra cash.

A good thing to note about this place is their martini happy hour which goes from 4-6pm every evening. They have 3 specific martinis on special for half off at those times.

Have a cocktail and chat the night away with a group of good friends. \n\nOH!  Don't forget to look for the Martini glass.

Most people drinking her are here to unwind and have a drink before bed.... yawn.\n\nAll that being said, this place is pretty damn classy and if you are trying to fuck the woman that you are with this place might help you out.  The huge windows that look on SF are tight.  There is usually some live music and the cocktail waitress' are nice and if you tip them will be sure and make you look like Hugh Grant in some RoCo.... thereby making your date cream (ask Katelin).\n\nAnyway, the drinks are drinks.  The prices are high and the view is good.  If you are trying to bang that Mission Hipster that looks like a melting ice cream cone, this isn't the spot.  If you are taking out that girl that you know hasn't spent much time in the city and is willing to 'try new things'... you have her on lock.", "author": "Thadd L."}

Seating is first come, first served - were able to steal some comfy arm chairs and two tables for a party of ten on a Sat night so, it worked out beautifully.  The smooth Latin House music wasn't so loud that I had to use a megaphone and sign language to communicate.  Our server was also very attentive - kept coming by to check up on us.  There is a food/dessert menu but, the kitchen had closed by the time we arrived (~10:30pm).  I'd definitely return with friends for a chill/lounge night in SF.\n\nSite note:  The drink menu included a selection of \"premium\" water - including \"10,000 B.C.\" water which has apparently been \"locked in an icy vault for over 10,000 years\" in the Coastal Glacier Range in British Columbia and \"comes from melted glacier ice,..\"  Naturally, my friends and I held a \"good ol' free municipal tap water\" vs \"$14 per bottle 10,000 B.C. water\" competition.  It was unanimous.  There was no competition, no comparison - there is NO WAY this 10,000 B.C. water tastes anything like tap water.  In fact, this 10,000 B.C. water tastes like f'ing DIRT.  Dirty water.  Bathwater.  WTF.  I'm surprised I didn't see sediment floating in the bottle.

I suddenly didn't even care that I was poorly dressed in my Macworld attire, I went straight in there and got a seat next to the windows and enjoyed a cocktail or two. Breathtaking views! \n\nLater on during the week I took my sister up to The View, finally a place she hadn't been to in the city yet. We both really enjoyed ourselves. It's really dark during the evening and I appreciated that, you get a better view of the city.\n\nDon't let the staff there make you feel lower class just because you don't order $100 worth of drinks, just let yourself enjoy it and ignore all the snobs.", "author": "Ericka A."}

Remind you I do get free parking and discount on drinks and food. \n\nLets start when you get in, you can choose to valet your car for $11 for 1st hour, add another $6 plus tax for hours preceding after that. If you find that to much then you may park your car across the street at the 5th and mission parking garage for $2.50 an hour.\n\nYou make your way to the main lobby where bellmen, concierge greet you and your date. You then make your way to the high rise elevators to the 34/7th floor (#$%^! i forget the floor it says \"the view\"). \n\nThe View usually has live lounge music. Drinks are nothing great, international cocktails, a bit over priced but you do pay for the service and great view so its ok i guess. Anyhow, just sit back, listen to the hotel lounge music, sip on your international cocktail and enjoy the view with your frined(s).", "author": "Jose S."}

As you walk around the lounge you can see the whole city and wow is it a sight to see.  Sunset is the ideal time to go if you want to see the lights on the Bay Bridge coming on as the sun goes down.\n\nNotice I haven't spoken about much else; that's because there isn't much else to speak of.  The house drinks are mediocre, the service is mediocre, and the food is mediocre.  If you go during a busy time, it will take you an impossibly long time to get your drinks.  They really need to get more servers and/or bartenders.  The food is expensive for the amount you get and the portions are mismatched.  For example, if you choose to get a cheese plate you'll always run out of cheese before you run out of crackers (or vice versa).\n\nThis is a great date spot and great group spot as long as you're not going on a Friday or Saturday night.  Go any other night and you won't have any serious issues.  I'm notoriously difficult on hotel bars... mainly because I like them so much.  Will I be going back here?  Definitely.

The music since Ricky took over as manager is more electronic type (nightmares on wax, air, and other groups like this). Very good lounge music if you ask me (It's not \"rave\" music btw in case I am not being clear on what electronic means).\n\nThe View has \"The View\"! (thank you captain obvious!). Take out of towners here. They do make great drinks. Not the cheapest things(certainly not the most expensive either), and worth buying at least one just to hang out and relax with. It is a great place to hang out, talk, get to know the people you are with, and experience the beauty of San Francisco.\n\nJust remember that it doesn't open until 4pm. It might be confusing on how to get up there for your first time so just ask one of the people in the lobby where the \"high rise elevators\" are and take them to the top floor.

The service = underwhelming.\n\nWalking out of the elevator onto the 39th floor of the Marriott building into a swanky lounge that has floor to ceiling windows was breathtaking at sunset. But that's about all that was good.\n\nI am a patient person, who has been in the service industry for quite some time, so I understand when things get busy, it takes time to visit every table. We didn't see our server for almost 15 minutes. I was willing to overlook that but, it just kept getting better. When the waiter came with our cocktails, my friends and I were chit chatting, since we hadn't seen each other in a while. The server said 'I need you to stop talking so I can give you your drinks'. I'm sorry but that is NOT something you say to a customer. How about 'Excuse me?' \n\nWe had our cocktails and I was going to pay out my tab and go. Since the server was no where to be found, I tracked down someone else to ask them to get grab just my tab, because my two friends wanted to stick around. Our server came over and asked me if I just I wanted to pay out or if the whole table did. I said just me, but as the server stepped away everyone decided it was time to go anyway. So I hopped up and caught up with our server and said 'Actually, the whole table wants to close out'. His response was 'Fine' while looking in the opposite direction.\n\n When we got our bill I was a little surprised to see that my fairly standard cocktail cost me $20, but whatever, it's a hotel, they over price everything. Well the next morning, I check my bank statement and they charged $50 to my credit card. I tried to call this morning to dispute it with them before I went to my bank and I was transferred to four different people before getting someone's voice mail.

Louisa and I needed a minute before we could approach the windows and enjoy the View lounge properly. We first sat at the west-facing side of the lounge, which we realized had already been closed off to new patrons, so we had to move to the east-facing side. We found a table for 3 pretty easily, but it was in a pretty bad location for viewing the city. We were waiting for a while before a waitress finally came over and apologized for the wait, then waited a bit longer before ordering drinks ($14 for a mango mojito! $7 or 9 or something for a beer, AND they didn't have any beer on tap). We got the drinks pretty quickly, though, and around that time someone in the corner nearby left and offered us his table. So we were able to enjoy our alcohol right next to the window-- a little daunting, but really fun.\n\nThis is definitely someplace to go now and then, and to bring touristy friends and dates with you. But seriously I think our 3-drink tab came out to almost $40, and we never saw that waitress again after getting our drinks.

The menu items are pricey for sure, but you'll get over it and love 'em anyway.  Cozy, comfy seating, great view, great drinks, tasty appetizers, friendly staff. Good for groups or more intimate evenings/late nights.", "author": "MJ T."}

I even have a good time when I don't get a table with a view, that is how much I love this place. You don't have to be a guest to come up and have a drink or a snack, which is a total perk.

Two elevators to the top, the second has the girl with head-phones and a wry smile. We'll be craigslist lovers tomorrow. To the top we land, stepping out with an impervious hop my maker and I. The bar found two chairs to seat ourselves. A budweiser and margaritah to our beck, two dollars slipped to the side; you've done good, kiddo. The view feels like some other city, it's all out there - but I can't but feel it's all the prettier from a sidewalk with a bent neck and whistling bout of vertigo. There's the trouble of inflated self-importance when standing eye to eye with the fortieth floor, it's a sense that pervades this place. You've all got your spit-shined shoes and beautiful broads, the sort that preen their stereotypes clean.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-05-14", "description": "My guest and I were in awe as the high-speed elevator opened on the 39th floor. Although the both of us have been here before, it's been a while and we've forgotten how special a place it was. We were very happy that there was no greeter at the main entrance. A greeter would definitely take away from the casual, yet elegant feel of this lounge. My guest and I came in a gawked out of the gigantic round window that is directly opposite the bar. At the time, the sun was beginning to set but was still bright out. We then walked to the other side of the lounge to determine which view to enjoy while we'd eat and drink. Being that both views are spectacular, we went back and forth between the sides a few times. We finally settled on the side with the round window when we noticed a couple leaving their table.\n\nI started with the Citrus Crush cocktail. For being a freshly made cocktail that even had orange slices in it, I expected a longer wait. In less than approximately three minutes, our server delivered our drinks along with a glass full of Asian snack mix. After placing cocktail napkins down, and sitting our drinks on them, we ordered some food. He politely noted that some small dishes were three for twenty-two dollars. He also told us that the plates were fairly small, and pointed to a cocktail napkin as reference to the plate size. I truly appreciated this, because some times plate sizes come at a total shock. We ordered the chicken skewers, shrimp and vegetable rolls, and the roasted/grilled veggie medley.\n\nBefore I go on to describe the rest of our experience, it might be of some value to note the way my guest and I were dressed. My guest was wearing a pink, flowing long-sleeve top with designer jeans and boots. I was wearing a button-up, long sleeve dress shirt with designer jeans. By looking around the lounge, I'd say fifty percent of the crowd was dressed in a similar manner. The others were in more business attire, probably stopping by right after work nearby or from a convention. I'm not sure how the way we dressed affected our service, but I was never asked to see ID. I'm thirty years old. Also, the server didn't ask to hold a credit card or to open a tab. I appreciated the server treating us like everyone else and not some young kids. Again, had we not been dressed for the part, I'm not sure how service would've differed.\n\nLess than ten minutes after ordering, he came back with our food, table napkins, and forks. The small, square dishes of roasted grilled vegetables and chicken skewers came on a large rectangular dish. Along side on the dish was an oil and vinegar dipping sauce for a complimentary basket of triangle-sliced bread. On a separate plate were the shrimp and vegetable rolls, which came with a vinegar/fish sauce dip and peanut sauce. The presentation was simple, yet brilliant. Clean, white, rectangular dishes, linen napkins, and small appetizer forks accented the beautifully prepared food.\n\nThe Asian snacks were a delightfully salty and sweet addition to the enjoyment of my cocktail. In a similar fashion, the bread and olive oil/vinegar dip was a wonderful addition to our meal. The bread was both warm and sweet, and made for a great in between flavor while enjoying the ordered food. The grilled vegetables had a nice mix of flavors, from sweet sun-dried tomatoes to tart artichoke hearts. The chicken skewers seemed a little \"out-of-the-box\" for my taste. The chicken didn't seem fresh, but it was still tender and tasty. To me, it was the weakest point of the meal. The shrimp rolls were very delicious. One set was so stuffed with vegetables and shrimp that it had broken out of its fresh wrapper. Plus, the variety of dipping sauces made for a different taste with every bite. Overall, this experience at the View Lounge was superb. I can't find one flaw in the experience that would cause us not to come back. Although the prices are a little high, you can't beat the view or the service.", "author": "Axel G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-03-24", "description": "The excellent view of the SF downtown and the friendly service is marred only slightly by the high cost of drinks at this upscale hotel lounge.  When I first visited several years ago, I imagine very few people knew of its existence, because on a weekend it was very easy to find a place to sit for our group of ten people.  Things seem to have changed; when I visited the other weekend, a large crowd of (generally attractive and well-heeled) people had taken up residence in most every seat in the house; we were lucky to make do with a tiny table in the corner of the back room, where we enjoyed live vocal jazz music and an inspiring westward view.  Actually, the eastward side has an arguably better view; there's more lights up and down the street on that side, and you're overlooking the shopping and financial districts instead of Civic Center and the 'Loin.  Anyway, how can I not give at least four stars to a place with a window that reminds me of the view from the Death Star?\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you're the lovely lass who vibed me really hard as I obliviously stepped out of the elevator, please drop me a line  ;)", "author": "Chuck W."}

I moved to the front as soon as a table was available and had a great time.   I recommend going there with a big group when you have something to celebrate.", "author": "sarah s."}

I was immediately overwhelmed by the Millinium Falcon window that looks out upon the entire city of San Francisco.  It is amazing!  What would have made this experience SO much better is having the cast of Star Wars serve us drinks.  Lando as the bartender, Leia as the waitress, Chewbacca as the bus boy....whatever!  YOU go there and then tell me you don't fantasize about the same thing.  Anyway, the place was a mess, empty glasses all over the tables, napkins fragments all over the carpet, a motley crew assortment of clientele.  But the most pervasive aspect about the place was the angry, dark, overbearing, industrial noise that someone chose as the listening entertainment for the evening.  On the way out, I asked a waitress what music was playing, she confidently informed me it was Thrill Kill Cult.  I ask you, please listen to your own freak music when you're home..alone...cutting yourself in some pitiful cry for attention.", "author": "Penny O."}
