I honestly was shocked to see that I hadn't written a review for this place earlier as I've been going there consistently for almost 2 years now!!\n\nThe vibe is chill and relaxed and fun, the staff are all super nice and attentive and friendly, the food is amazing, the menu is pretty huge, and the prices are fair. The *ONLY* downside is that it gets pretty crowded in the morning and early afternoons on weekends because it's so popular. That being said, they do move fairly quickly, and there's a cute little parklet with some seats and greenery right in front of the restaurant where you can hang out while waiting.\n\nAt this point I've tried pretty much all of the omelettes, benedicts, and scrambles, along with the breakfast burrito, the chili con carne, the regular pancakes, the beignets, and the coffee (both the regular light roast and the dark chicory roast) and *everything* I've had is great! Pretty huge portions, awesome flavors, fresh and tasty ingredients all make for excellent dishes, every single time. I've never been disappointed by a visit to Just For You and the only reason I don't go even more often is that I'd gain waaaaay too much weight if I did that!", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

It looked like a long wait when we got there, but we only waited for 8 minutes. Woohoo!\n\nThe menu had plenty to offer. I took our server's suggestion and got hangtown fry. I also got a side of gravy for my biscuit. Slave girl and friend got a classic beignets to share, and carnita omelet and chilaquiles as their main dish.\n\nSince I didn't try too much of their food, I couldn't say much about it other than it tasted good on the first bite. Beignets were whatever, but then again I don't really care for sweets usually.\n\nMy hangtown fry though, was very good. It had 3 eggs scrambled with bacon, oyster, and onions. The menu was a little misleading because the 3 deep fried oysters were actually placed on top of the scrambled eggs, not scrambled WITH the eggs. That didn't change how good my food tasted. The oysters were juicy and perfectly fried. The eggs couldn't go wrong with bacon and onions. It was a very good combination. I got cheese grits as my side and that was also delicious.\n\nThe gravy was what I didn't get. It was mildly sweet and I never had gravy tasted like that before. I asked the server about the taste and they told me they would check with the kitchen as they took it away. They never told me if that was how they usually make it, but they took the gravy off the bill. I never got my biscuit back...sad days.\n\nOverall it wasn't a bad spot. The cafe had a lot of personality and the food was decent. I would go back if our friend asked us to dine there again.", "author": "Fan H."}

The frittata did have some soggy areas probably due to the moisture left in some of the veggies so I think it could be better. The house fries were ordinary, nothing too special and not too much flavor with them.

I love beignets and decided to give it a try.  I came here with my friend and we ordered other dishes and had beignets as dessert to share.  Omg. The beignets were very delicious.  The beignets were so fresh and melt in your mouth.  It comes with 3 pieces and we each has a piece and share the 3rd one.  We shared the scrambled and tofu with mixed-veggies with a side of sausage. It was a lot of food but we finished them because they were all so good. \n\n2nd time I came. We each had our own plate since we were sitting at the community table which is hard to share.  So my friend got cowgirl and I got the cowboy.  I was going to get beignets on the side but decided not to since it's a lot of food already. Good thing i didn't because the French toast was big and I actually have to give some to my friend too.  \n\nNext time. Probably just get their beignets with cup of coffee.

Tess loved the fruits and granola but she didn't care for the Greek yogurt that was served. Next time she knows she need to ask what type of yogurt will be served.

That is no exaggeration.\n\nThe man who ultimately took our order made suggestions for ways to alter our dishes which actually made them more expensive -- but he never mentioned the price differences.\n\nFor example, one person asked for pancake recommendations, and he said \"You should do one of each!\" Lo and behold, getting two different pancakes has an upcharge - but we only learned this upon getting the check.\n\nAnother asked for his take on the crab cake. He said it's phenomenal and went on raving about it, so they ordered it. The crab cake arrived burnt to a crisp -- completely black. It was unrecognizable from a properly-cooked crabcake, and obviously inedible.\n\nAt the very start, we were also poured two mugs of coffee without anyone asking if we want it, so we assumed it's included; this is the case in plenty of diners in our home state so, again, we had no idea it has a cost (or how much) until the bill came.\n\nCoffee was poured in the beginning but never replenished, poor service continued, and the multiple instances of being given or offered things without knowing their cost is poor business, plain and simple.", "author": "Nic Z."}

Your first impression of this place a modern ironic bohemian vibe that purveys eatery. The walls a pleasantly decorated in retro 1990's era concert posters featuring old school phosphorescent pigmentations that sported a minor vogue of the era. A mix of 1980's to contemporary pop synth music adds to a comforting feel that makes for a conducive eating environment.   This establishment even sports an old school bench counter that really brings the decor together.  The staff are young, bright and affable.  Attention to detail is definitely emphasized and quite appreciate by this reviewer.  My waitress took the time to wedge my retro eatery table to prevent a minor wobble. Nice. \n\nOn matters food related. I had a short stack of buttermilk pancakes with side of two eggs over easy. The food was served hot and timely. The eggs were perfect. I mean perfect.  That is not something I see a lot and it struck me as another example of the attention to detail they have here. The pancakes were fluffy and light while maintaining proper mouth feel thanks to the crust cooked crust.  The portion size is on the large side. Don't come here expecting some dinky little bit of food like you see at other super trendy spots.  My mimosa was served in a pint glass and was the exact ratio that should be demanded where the OJ does not overwhelm the sparking wine.  Price is definitely commensurate if not a little less than they could charge.    The variety of food here is shocking.  Awesome mexican, southern,  AND vegan? wha???

The scramble came with a lot of flavors. I'm not a huge fan of Parmesan cheese but it went pretty well with the mix. The home fries are standard but good and that corn bread was awesome. Huge block and not overly sweet. I cleaned my plate. The better half ordered the French toast. She enjoyed it.\n\nParking is on the street or nearby. We got lucky just a few streets away. Pricing is fair and decent.\n\nThe vibe reminds me of a place I'd visit back home in Austin, TX. The staff was very friendly, made us feel right at home. I love the photos and posters. If we are ever back in town, I'd definitely return.", "author": "Alyssa M."}

We had a super cool server with a gorgeous pixie haircut and relaxed demeanor, she was not pushy with our orders and was prompt with refilling our waters. The food servers and staff were all on their A game...shoutout to the friendly Mexican guy who greeted us as we asked for a table, and quickly took our dirty plates away. \n\nIt's not a super fancy cafe, but it's got such a \"Sunday morning/lazy neighborhood cafe\" vibe without the pretentious avocado toasts and ginger-banana-dragonfruit-cleanse shakes.

My boyfriend split the last one and saw how raw the dough was, it was literally dough spilling out.  Hopefully the ones we ate weren't too raw, but it did leave a yeast taste in our mouths.  The beignets were taken off the bill, but still, beignets are kind of their staple item so they should have been cooked properly.  P.S. Their beignets are nothing like Cafe du Monde's, I don't care what others have to say.", "author": "Samantha C."}

Ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, buttermilk fried chicken sandwich, reuben sandwich, and beignets. Grilled chicken was good with provolone cheese.  Fried chicken could have used more flavor on its own but with the honey butter it was very good. Reuben had delicious corned beef. All the sandwiches had homemade bread toasted perfectly. Beignets were too doughy more like doughnuts. \nService was very friendly and quick. Overall atmosphere was very fun and quirky.", "author": "Melissa W."}

Mimosa was about as good as one could expect for a pint-sized mimosa, and the beignets were very good but not sweet (ask for honey). We got the hangtown fry, fried chicken benedict, cornbread, biscuit, grits, and home fries. Everything was solid except for the biscuits, which were a little heavy and flavorless compared to the best homemade biscuits. Great service and experience overall.\n\nUpdate: I've been back a few times since my first visit, and the menu overall has been disappointing. The service has been terrific every time, but I've ordered a variety of scrambles and they all come with large undercooked chunks of onion inside, and when the scramble contains bacon it's always undercooked as well. They need to sufficiently cook the fillings first and then add the eggs--it tastes like they cook them all together. The huevos rancheros were the worst huevos rancheros I've ever tasted. I've had way better huevos rancheros in New York, which is saying something. Dry and flavorless, it's like they slapped the ingredients together with zero effort. With that said, I'm leaving my rating at four stars because the place has such a nice vibe and servers, and because they do staples (basic eggs, bacon, etc.) very well.", "author": "Young J."}

My friend and I waited about 30 mins but only because they couldn't read my name on the waiting list. So when you place you name down on the list make sure it's legible because they will surely skip over it. \n\nFood- Now the food is the saving grace of this place because it was quite delicious. I ordered the Cowgirl which consisted of 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, with 2 chicken-apple sausages. It was an extremely hearty meal for only $12. They have 3 choices for pancakes, buttermilk, cornmeal and buckwheat. I couldn't decide between the cornmeal and buttermilk so our waitress kindly suggested getting one of each. SCORE! The cornmeal outshined the buttermilk easily. It's mealy texture it subtle sweetness combined to make a really unique taste. The chicken-apple sausage was tasty as well. Not too sweet but very tender and juicy. \n\nService- Our waitress was super nice but the host/bus boy certainly carried an attitude. I was on my way to the airport and had all my bags and when we were being seated he told us to we could sit bar side. When my friend pointed out we had too many bags to sit there he made a smug remark. Also when he bused our table I heard him complaining to another table that he doesn't make enough for the \"meager\" tip we left.  We left close to an 18% tip for a meal that was about $22 so his remarks were unwarranted and rude. \n\nBut yea this place is pretty quaint, with outdoor seating.

Such a rude response and didn't even apologize for his mistake.  this totally ruined our mood and our whole experience here.  Honestly, i didn't even want to eat here after that incident but we've waited so long and aina did not have a table for 6. After another 10 mins of waiting, we finally got seated. The guy finally apologized for his mistake but we were still pretty pissed with him. He gave us 2 free vouchers for the bienets but we were only able to redeem one. Lame but not a huge big deal. We all got the mimosa. I had the Greg's scramble with chicken apple susage which was amazing!!!! The grits were alright and corn bread was decent. Bienets were good but not out of this world amazing.  The chicken with waffle was not good, chicken was not crispy. I wouldn't recommend this. Our server was amazing! But was not happy with how we were treated by the other guy....what do you mean by \"it's just food...calm down\"?? No, when it comes to food, I will not calm down...not when it's brunch time in san francisco and not when I've been waiting out in the cold for 35 mins!", "author": "Caitlin P."}

Started out with the Beignets... You get 3 huge ones so prepare to share...or make it a meal.  Your choice.  Next i had the \"Frittata of  the Decade\". I opted for no onion but i think the spinach overpowered the zucchini, which is my favorite ingredient.  Still good, but would customize this one a but more in the future.  Great potatoes and the scone was so-so.  Tasted like they heated it too long in the microwave to be honest.  My friend had the raisin toast and that was much better.\n\nService was unorganized.  3 different servers rotated around and in the end, none of them wanted to give us our check until we flagged one down.

With my friend and I, we started off ordering individual beignets and LOVED them (can you say BOMB)!  They are very pillow-like: very fluffy, light, and airy, then dusted with powered sugar on top.  In our opinion, we felt JFY's beignets are better than Brenda's.  \n \nHonestly, if you came here JUST for beignets and a cup of joe or tea, that's really enough.  But if you're desiring something more substantial, the chicken shiitake omelette is a good brunch dish: tender, white-meat chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, and shiitake mushrooms.  For the side (included) I suggest their creamy grits, which taste like Chinese-style plain porridge (baak jook), and their moist, home-made cornbread.  \n\n2 people enjoying 2 egg dishes (1 benedict and 1 omelette), 2 beignets, and 1 cup of joe all for $40 tip included is very reasonable.

I'm not sure if it's a regular thing but each time a name was called off the list, the (male) host made the most ridiculous feminine \"YOOHOO\" sound to go with the name. It was strange, but funny. The interior is what you would expect from a brunch place, with a good amount of seating and a moderately noisy atmosphere.\n\nI came here expecting great beinets, unfortunately they were rather disappointing. They were not quite as soft or tasty as I was hoping for.\n\nWhat did surprise me was the special I ordered, which was a duck confit benedict.

Although they have a couple outdoor tables and a parklet, there's isn't much of a view.\n\nThey serve standard breakfast dishes, but their sugar beignet is the real star. Advertised as \"light, fluffy New Orleans style donuts smothered in powdered sugar\", their beignets fit the description well, and they were the main reason I wanted to give this place a try. The slightly crunchy edges and fluffy, but chewy center make this deep-fried goodness a sweet breakfast treat, whether it's by itself, accompanied with a cup of coffee, or before a more savory meal.\n\nThe Crabby Bennie consists of two Creole crab cakes on muffins (or toast), topped with two poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. The crab cakes were good, but there weren't any large chunks of meat, giving me the impression that it's canned. The hollandaise sauce was thick and creamy. But the poached eggs were overcooked; the white had fully set and the yolk held together and wasn't runny at all. It was a huge disappointment, because they advertise their eggs as \"poached to perfection\". But they were FAR from perfection...\n\nHouse potatoes were seasoned very lightly, but not enough because they were still a little bland. I needed to add some salt and pepper and dip them in ketchup in order to finish them.\n\nThe service was very friendly and food arrived promptly. The cafe is relatively small, seating around 25-30 people. But there was no wait when we visited on a Saturday afternoon, an hour before closing. Overall, Just For You Cafe is a decent breakfast spot, but there aren't a lot of unique options on the menu that would urge me to return.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

The Cowboy:  My mother's choice.  She decided to treat herself since she couldn't recall the last time she had French Toast.  This dish is also served with eggs and a choice of link sausage or bacon.  She chose poached and the sausage.  Suffice to say she loved her food as there was only ONE piece of French Toast left on her plate in the end.\n\n2.

Two eggs any style with Longanisa (Filipino sausage):  I can't ever remember having longanisa for breakfast at all.  Period.  And that's how I knew I had to choose this dish.  Served with eggs sunny side up and breakfast potatoes.  Good portion.  Delicious breakfast!  Very filling.

I had heard about this place from several people, including a couple seated next to us at the Kabuki watching \"Chef\" -- they told us the Beignets were the best they had ever tasted outside of the Cafe du Monde in New Orleans.  \n\nWe got there around 9:30 on a Sunday and waited about 20 minutes, but when we had finished the wait looked more like and hour.  What a great place!  Lots of energy, really interesting crowd, and fun art on the wall.  The service is terrific -- I always love breakfast places where just as you take your last sip of coffee, they're magically at your table to refill.  \n\nAnd the food! Of course we tried a Beignet and it was unbelievable --so light, sweet, and delicious.  I had what seems like a simple thing, but I'm always amazed how few restaurants get \"two eggs over medium\" right -- and they did -- cooked them perfectly!  Add chicken apple sausage and home fries to that and BAM!  The husband had a breakfast frittata which he loved and grits (his favorite), which he said were cooked exactly right -- another dish many places miss by a mile.  \n\nI love this place -- it's taking its place on our favorite breakfast places list!", "author": "Lisa W."}

Came here because it looked super packed one weekend, so decided to come back on a weekday to see what all the excitement was about, no wait then, seems like a popo's go-to bfast stop. Got the two eggs over easy, bacon slices which were not crispy but thick solid slices, chose grits with cheese--can't go wrong with grits, and whole wheat Just For Me artisanal homebaked toast. It was good, wouldnt go buy and bring a loaf home or anything though (that is an option). Also tried the chili which came with cornbread, tasty, nothing to rave about, tastier with some hot sauce. French fries were mediocre, waiter recommended that over the home fries. Took a bite of the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich which the waiter recommended over the Po-Boy Sammies, claimed the chicken sammie has an interesting/different flavor, but IMO it tasted ordinary..did come with large slices of pickle though! Last but not least, beignets were mediocre, a good beignet should be good without  needing any toppings, but it tasted so much more wondrous with the side of jam and maple syrup. \n\nService was fine, comparable to typical diner service.

It may not be in the best neighborhood, but once you're inside, you wouldn't know it. I ALWAYS get a beignet from here, no matter what time of day it is. Words cannot explain how good it is, but I'll try: tons of powdered sugar with the perfect crunch on the edges, and soft like a pillow. But don't let the white layer of sugar intimidate you! You can always scrape it off if the amount isn't to your liking. With it though, omg, each bite is like heaven.\n\nI usually get their eggs benedict, until I came on a weekday and realized those are only available on weekends. You can imagine my sadness when the server told me this! But, I knew they wouldn't disappoint so I got one of their other items instead. I can't remember the name, but it came with eggs, sausages, cornbread, and grits. I've tried their grits with cheese, and I admit, it's BOMB. Their cornbread is also to die for as well. The eggs and sausage were nothing special, but the eggs benedict is buttery delicious.\n\nIf you come on a weekend after 9AM, be ready to wait for a table.

There were 6 of us, and at around 1pm, the wait wasn't too bad for a big table to hold all of us.\n\nI don't know about you, but there are certain days where I'll work out and then right after that think to myself, \"you know what? I'm going to eat my face off. yeah.\"  Saturday was definitely one of those days.\n\nBeing that most of us try and eat healthy (Paleo!), you'd think something like beignets would be out of the question.  False. We got two orders of those light, fluffy, delicious and heavenly donuts for each person to have (3 in order) their own.  Absolutely incredible, and almost as good as Cafe Du Monde's version in NOLA.\n\nAfter those came out, everyone's dishes came out, including my eggs and chorizon scramble with a side of grits and tortillas. And then a strange phenomenon happened...the entire table went dead silent.  3 of us had the chorizon and eggs, 2 had an omelette special, and 1 had an order the oatmeal pancakes.  Even if you're not a grits fan, get the grits.  Even if you're not a huge egg fan, get the chorizo and eggs. I promise you won't be disappointed.\n\nService was ok, they were able to split our check by individual (which is seriously so awesome!).  A side order of bacon got forgotten until the very end, and we had to ask for more water, more butter, and hot sauce throughout breakfast.  All in all though, not a bad situation.\n\nThis was probably my first time eating at a place around here, and I honestly loved it. Given where the gym is, we'll probably be back very soon.

Let me start by saying their Reuben Sandwich is just.. wow. I've had plenty of Reuben Sandwiches but this has got to be my absolute favorite. The customer service there was amazing from walking in to walking out. As soon as I walked in the very respectful host asked my sister (who is 8.5 months pregnant) and I to please sign the waitlist that's outside. No problem with us. He called us in after not that long of a wait and immediately engaged with us and congratulating my sister on her pregnancy. It's funny because you can tell when people are being nice because they need to know, or when they're being nice because they're genuinely nice people. It was SO genuine. After being seated (it is a bit tight in this cafe, and from what I've noticed it looks like it gets busy often. We went there on a weekday for brunch and it was pretty packed) we were taken care of by a lovely waitress who checked up on us at all the right timings. What really got me was that the general manager was walking by and greeting everyone and really helping out his team.

I wasn't sure want to expect but I was expecting something pretty good since it was the talk of the town. \n\nThe place is very small and there is limited seating both outside and inside. The staff are pretty nice but you can't really tell who works there and who doesn't because they don't wear uniforms or anything. So that was a bit confusing. We got pretty lucky and got seated rather quickly and we brought waters. It was so busy that it took our waiter sometime to get to us and order our food, which was disappointing. \n\nI ordered the eggs with veggies and cheese and potatoes. Our food too about 20-30 minutes to get to us, which took longer than expected considering we didn't order very much and what we ordered shouldn't have taken that long to make. When we finally got our food, it wasn't what I was expecting. There was dry cheese on top, melted would have been better. The eggs didn't taste like anything and the cheese made it worse. The potatoes were also dry and didn't have a taste to it at all. I was very disappointed and expected something better. \n\nI don't plan on coming back to this place anytime soon.

I ordered the beignets to-go, but also ended up with the greek scramble (without olives) with home fries & wheat toast. \n\nThe beignets were the best I've had in SF to date! They taste great & the texture was what I remembered having in New Orleans. I had to get got extra powdered sugar though cuz 1 of the 3 was sugared only on a corner. And that same sad beignet with minimal sugar was simply a pillow. A deliciously deceiving exterior with one huge air pocket interior.  :(  \n\nThe scramble was ok. It had olives which I asked them to omit. The taste was good, texture wasn't to my liking. For some reason I expected diced veggies, and crumbled feta, but there were large slices of onion & huge chunks of tomato & feta, scrambled with egg that I could barely tell was there. My 2 yr old nephew could have done that. \n\nThe potatoes were off on taste & texture, (try the potatoes at Plow!) & unfortunately I got full from the beignets and didn't get to try the home made wheat bread.

Luckily for us we decided to go to Rickshaw Bagworks down the block spur of the moment Sunday afternoon.  I was getting kinda hungry but we didn't want Piccino again and we weren't in the mood for Hard Knox.  So we decided on Just For You and got to the cafe around 1:30.  Surprisingly there was no wait.\n\nThe lady taking our order didn't seem too chatty or suggestive, I think she's the cashier or something.  Our waitress checked in on us occasionally, but she like everyone else except for the attentive and friendly bus boy seemed reserved.  He ended up getting the crabby bennie and I got the special salami frittata.  We also chose to get a beignet each for us to start with.   \n\nThe beignets were $1.80 something a piece or 3 for $5.  They were served pretty quickly and were just served warm.  They were huge and  not so dense.  He thought he detected a little bit of liquor in the batter.  I like Brenda's French Soulfood's crawfish and apple beignets more but JFY's plain beignets are less filling due to the lightness.  Their plain (only flavor) is also more enjoyable than Brenda's.  His egg was cooked well as the yolk oozed out. The crabcake was a creole crabcake which had a nice little kick to it.  The hollandaise sauce was an after note and the potatoes lacked flavor as well.  I felt that there wasn't too much crab in his dish either (lot of filler in the crabcake0.  He felt that it's hard comparing it to Zazie because their bennies are so good.  I was a little taken back when I saw my frittata because I thought that frittatas are supposed to be pretty fluffy (it's been awhile since I had one).  It was chocked full of salami, bell peppers, tomatoes and Swiss tho.  Potatoes were the same with mine though the hot sauce did help.  I love how they give you a choice of about 5 different brands.  Mine also came with my choice of toast so I chose cinnamon raisin, gotta love that option.  Though I noticed a little bit of green on one of my pieces of toast.  I believe this was some avocado from the flat top.  I'm not allergic but could you imagine if someone was & they didn't properly clean their flattop or something?  Both of our dishes were $12.95.  Even tho his had crab in it, was it worth it, no?  I think we would have had a more satisfying brunch at Hard Knox for cheaper.  Hard Knox does over bacon and eggs for brunch but JFY does have an edge with being the only traditional breakfast place in the area.  Sad to say, I think the beignets were the highlight.  Our meal wasn't bad but it was nothing special.  There are other better options out there.  Our average meal here totally makes me miss Nini's in San Mateo!  Three at best.", "author": "Cat C."}

Worth a trip just for these.  I've had beignets at maybe 10 restaurants, including Cafe du Monde in New Orleans, and these are the best by far, for 3 reasons: 1) they are super light and airy.  It's 90% air inside.  They are not dense/leaden.  2) super flavorful.  It's almost a glazed donut flavor.  3) great texture.  It's a little bit like a popover in terms of perfect level of chewiness.\n\nThe cafe is New Orleans themed, and they have great chicory coffee.", "author": "Scott F."}

I ordered scrambled eggs and they were neither creamy nor fluffy.  It seems they were going for creamy but slightly overcooked the eggs so they were starting to go dry.  My grits were dry, clumpy, mushy with no grit texture, and underseasoned.  I was underwhelmed.  The biscuit was huge!  But it was halfway between a biscuit and a dinner roll.  I like my biscuits flakey or crumbly, and these biscuits, although impressively tall, were neither.  I think their recipe needs more butter. ;)\n\nAll that said, the service is great and Just For You is definitely a happening spot to get your brunch on.

My daughter had the Reuben, which she found to be one of the better ones she's tried; unfortunately, I was not as lucky with my choice. I opted for the crab cake po-boy, a featured item. It looked fabulous - two generous cakes on a soft white bun with fresh tomato and lettuce. The flavor of the crab cakes was ok,  but maybe they forgot to fry it?? With the first couple bites, the nicely shaped cakes turned instantly into piles of mush that squeezed out all sides of the sandwich. It was a mess to eat and the texture was very unappealing. Was this a mistake by the kitchen staff? I can't imagine they could be so proud of those crab cakes, which were the worst I've eaten. Ever.

We arrived at the location around 1PM (*WARNING* they close at 3PM Sundays)and there was a long line of people waiting outside of this little cafe, but  we waited from 20-25mins. So not that bad! \n\nFor my meal I ordered Gregg's Scramble w/ Chicken-Apple Sausage, home fries, and wheat bread toast. To me, the portion size is definitely filling and worth it. Gregg's Scramble: $10.50 \n\nFor dessert my sister and I shared 3 beignets. If you don't know what a beignet is, it's a light,fluffy, New Orleans donut smothered in powdered sugar! Add some syrup to the top of your beignet && OH-EM-GEE TO DIE FOR!! The beignets prices are 1 Beignet = $1.75 or **3 Beignets = $5\n\nThe servers were so nice and very efficient making sure customers were doing okay and satisfied with our orders. All in all, I would definitely come back here for a delicious, fulfilling, breakfast/brunch meal!", "author": "Hazel L."}

I was just in New Orleans for the first time and failed to try a famous beignet, so my friend and I figured why not try one here.  Little did we know when ordering three, that one was as big as my head!   The chorizo con huevos was amazing - I can be picky with my breakfast meat but it was perfectly cooked and spiced.  My friend could barely eat half of his chili scramble and made us stop back at home to drop off leftovers before heading out for the day.   We liked it so much, we recommended it to our fellow Airbnb tenants who visited the next day!   The staff was great - quick and friendly.", "author": "Ren P."}

It's a small space that fits maybe up to 30 customers tightly, but that just makes for a cozy atmosphere.\n\nI got a zucchini + mushroom + parmesan scramble, with gluten free toast and orange juice (just ok). I also shared a side of oatmeal pancakes with a friend. The scramble was delicious with fresh ingredients, home fries were yummy, and Udi's GF bread was good as expected. The oatmeal pancakes were um, like eating a bowl of soggy oats in pancake form, especially with syrup.

I would recommend anything on the menu that's got eggs bene. I've taken friends and family here and we're never disappointed.

The mimosas were giant and served in pint glasses because helllllll  yeah. They're $9 a pint but that's heaps better than mission cafe which is $9 a goblet. The line was silly but we did get stuck behind some jerks who thought that bringing 7 people to brunch for a place that holds a grand total of 20 was reasonable. The brunch was well done -- really great solid food with a runny egg on my benedict just like what we all want. And the chili cornbread thing spoke to me of home -- even if it had beans.

Love their posters and signs on the walls! Hilarious!! Their website is cute too with links to their menu! By the way, I did notice a slight price difference between weekday breakfast and weekend brunch for the same items. Also they seem to serve better stuff on the weekends of course! Service was okay.

It was like scrambled eggs with speckles of chorizos, instead of big chunks like I expected. I did like how they offered me a choice of corn vs flour tortilla. The home fries were not french fries like I assumed based on the name, but fried potatoes, soft on the inside, slightly crispy on the outside.\n\nI also tried the Eggs Benedict with steak. The hollandaise sauce was heavy. Overall, the dish was very rich with the steak. I only ate about half of this dish. It was too heavy for me.\n\nThe winner were the beignets. They came out super fresh and piping hot from the kitchen. As I bit into my first beignet, a sweet whiff of steam hit me in the face. I savored every bite of the beignet, holding it close to my face each time, and repeatedly rolled it around in the powdered sugar which had fallen. The dough was light and fluffy, much better than the beignets at Brenda's (which I had eaten recently). The beignets saved what would have been just an average/ok brunch.", "author": "Jeanne L."}

And, without the long line and crazy wait.\n\nJust For You is the kind of restaurant where, when you ask for something special or a customization like substituting chicken apple sausage for pork sausage in a scramble, they write it down, repeat it to make sure they got it right, and come out to check with you again if there's any issue. At Plow, they'll roll their eyes and begrudgingly make the change because they think their breakfast is just SO awesome - but at Just For You they understand that breakfast is all about what I want, and how I want it cooked.\n\nHere's some more reasons why I love just for you:\n- They bake their own bread and their cinnamon raisin is the bomb\n- They also make their own sausage, and the chicken apple sausage is top notch\n- Pint mimosas made with fresh grapefruit or orange juice - much more satisfying than a wimpy flute\n- Their cornmeal pancakes - get them\n- Even their homefries are awesome, not too fried and the right amount of potato\n\nThe last thing I'll say is about price.

But not too bad, about 20-30 mins. Cute little cafe with friendly servers. They have a lot of different breakfast selections, and I loved the various side options they offer with your entree. I opted for the crab cake benedict, except I got it on an English muffin instead of their house made toast. And I got grits on the side just to be daring and try it for the first time. The benedict was not bad, but it was just a little heavy. As for the grits, I was not a fan of them at all, but at least I gave them a try!

My boyfriend and I had brunch on a Sunday at about 1pm. As we were walking to Just For You Cafe, I already could tell that the wait was going to be a while due to the amount of people waiting outside of the restaurant. The wait was about 20-30 minutes for 2 people (Just For You Cafe goes down the list instead of basing it on how large/small the party is so that was nice!) I was definitely expecting much, but Just For You Cafe pretty much looks like your typical \"hole in the wall\" type breakfast joint which added that nice \"homey\" vibe to it. Our waiter was extremely nice, prompt, and friendly which is a huge plus! I ordered the Cowgirl while my boyfriend ordered the Crab Benedict with Home Fries.\n\nCowgirl (bacon, eggs, and 2 buttermilk pancakes) - The pancakes were ah-mazing! They were thick, fluffy, and absolutely delicious! The eggs were a little bit on the liquid-y side which I didn't mind and the bacon.. wasn't the best, but it did the job.\n\nMy boyfriend said he really liked his Crab Benedict. I think he saw me staring at his Home Fries so he traded me for bacon lol and let me just say that it was the best trade ever! The Home Fries were one of the best I've tasted!  GET THE HOME FRIES!

The service is excellent, the atmosphere has a grassroots neighborhood vibe, it's not pretentious whatsoever, and most importantly, the food is excellent. \n\nMy one and only complaint (and it's actually a pretty big complaint): the coffee here is horrible. The house coffee I had here was so burnt that there are moments when I felt like I was tasting Korean Shin Ramen MSG packets. I know it's weird and I thought I was going crazy for a second, but the taste just really reminded me of something MSG-related. Regardless, it was disgusting. But perhaps I just had a bad burnt batch -- so I'm not going to ding them too much on it.\n\nThe star of the show here is (as everyone else has mentioned): their beignets. I just came back from New Orleans, where I had amazing beignets from Cafe du Monde and Morning Call, so hopefully that gives me some credibility when I say this: Just For You Cafe's beignets are even better than the ones in New Orleans. Yeah yeah, gasp all you want -- it is what it is. If only I had some decent coffee to drink with it.\n\nCorned Beef Hash was excellent; Crab cakes were delicious. Everything just tasted like good old fashioned homestyle breakfast cooking. I was bit disappointed with the biscuits (they weren't fluffy enough), but the gravy was addicting.\n\nThe owner came around with a big smile and warm greetings. Always a plus when you have a neighborhood joint like this. Also, with the long waits, they provide coffee outside for those who are waiting. Little things like this just really hit home for me (even though the coffee was horrible, but it's the thought that counts).\n\nAll in all, Just For You Cafe is a wonderful breakfast/brunch restaurant that blends together incredible food with a intimate, genuine vibe. \n\nIf it weren't for the coffee, this place would get a resounding 5 stars from me.", "author": "Roy C."}

Our party of 3 was seated after about 15-20 minutes of waiting. \n\nWe got the Greg Scramble, French Toast, Chili Scramble and a set of 3 beignets. The Greg Scramble was ok. We got it with chicken apple sausage and corn bread. The corn bread was DELISH - served hot and fresh. The scramble was alright - I felt like I've had better. I wasn't so fond of the parmesan cheese on top, but oh well. And the rest of it was not blow-your-mind status. The French Toast was thick and yummy - also typical and yummy, but not to die for. The Chili Scramble was probably the best dish we had. The chili and eggs were laid on top of homemade cornbread. It was hot and yummy and full of flavor. We couldn't finish all of it. Lastly, I realize each place has their own version of how they make their beignets. This place made HUGE beignets, each the size of my palm. It's super doughy inside, making me wonder if it's supposed to be like that, or just undercooked.

Most brunch entrees come with a side of bread (even wheat-free is available) and the OJ and grapefruit juice are both fresh-squeezed.

Though the portions could be bigger and the food a smidge fattier, the service pushes things up to 4 stars.\n\nI first came here to meet some colleagues for coffee and I knew I'd be back: the hearty down-home fare and feel were just too cozy to forget. I passed on food at the time but the biscuits remained ensconced in my cerebral cortex. Today I came back and indulged in an Athena omelette (you know: feta, tomatoes, olives, onions and spinach) and my BF dug into the oh-so-popular Greg's scramble.\n\nAgain, neither one of us were wowed by the portions (my wandering fork would have appreciated more chicken apple sausage in his omelette, and my heart fell just a little bit at the size of my own dish), but the service was impeccable. Examples: they easily substituted my home fries for a very tasty salad, refilled our coffees constantly without charging us for them (even after we pointed that out when we got the bill), and was just overall friendly and responsive. \n\nAll in a cute quiet corner in Dogpatch: definitely a fan.", "author": "Diane B."}

Chorizo Breakfast Burrito YES!\n\nAfter a early start to a morning, I found myself in need of some nourishment while the day was still young, that is, if 11am still counts!  One of my good friends turned me onto this \"Just for You\" Cafe, and once we found parking (quite the challenge around here), I will say that I am quite pleased with the choice.\n\nAfter perusing the breakfast menu and being in the mood for pseudo-mexican food, I chose the breakfast burrito with Chorizo.  An excellent choice.  Though the burrito isn't HUGE, (maybe just 7 inches in length), the ingredients, especially the chorizo and green chile made it amazing.  I'd say the chorizo reminded me a bit of corned beef hash made from scratch, sans potatoes, of course.   I also, um.. borrowed half a slice of their bacon from my dining cohort.  Thick, soft, yet a bit crunchy with quite a lot of depth to the flavor. Yummy stuff.\n\nThe french toast looked perfect too, though I would have preferred it on thicker \"Texas\" Toast bread.  Next time.\n\nService was friendly, yet unobtrusive.  The ambiance here was nice on this warm day..

The food here is pretty good, but today was the worst in a line of poor service experiences at Just for You.  \n\nAfter waiting a while to be seated, we placed our order ... 25 minutes went by, and nothing arrived.  New people with the same size party (3) sat next to us and were served there dishes which they had ordered after us and had their dishes removed, at which point  I approached our waiter and cordially asked if maybe he had forgotten about us.  He assured me that he had not (which was a lie) and was somewhat apologetic.  Another 5 minutes go by and the manager comes to our table and instead of being apologetic or even nice, just walks up and says \"You've been waiting for 15 minutes, which is totally normal, so just sit tight.\" and walks away.  Factually, she was wrong, I had sent an email from my phone after we ordered, and it was 35 minutes earlier and still no food, and were very put off by her brusk and accusatory tone -- like we had no reason to even ask where our food might be.

It was also Father's Day, so what a perfect place for brunch. This place is located in Dogpatch, a neighborhood I've never been to, but apparently it's hip and happening and has a lot of good food places, this being one of them. It's also a popular place, since there were people waiting outside and names on a long list. But, there was coffee and sunshine to keep the crowd from storming the place. \n\nI honestly didn't know what to get when I got there... you can only have breakfast enough times before you realize you're ordering the same thing all the time. I was torn between going simple with just bacon and eggs and then going with something like eggs benedict. I finally decided on the cowboy, which is just eggs, bacon, and french toast. Oh my god... the french toast was absolutely divine. The bread slices were huge (it was only two slices), and it was so nice and custardy in the middle. And hot! Topped with powdered sugar and syrup, it was probably the best kind of french toast I've had all year. I also got a side of one pancake because I wanted to do my pancake test (if they have good pancakes, then they have good everything). They totally passed! It was big and hot, and perfect. \n\nAnd let's not forget the beignets... DELICIOUS! Hot, soft in the middle. Oh my, it was really good. I also love that their mimosas are in a big pint glass! It was my dream. I decided to live my dream that day. \n\nIf anything, I would like to make this place a regular place for brunch.

They are a small restaurant but they try very hard to accommodate groups. We had a group of 10 on Memorial weekend Sunday and they had seating for us in the back. Just make sure your party is all there when they are ready to seat you. \n\nGood to KNOW: There is plenty of parking on the streets. The food is decent.  I usually think breakfast food isn't hard to prepare--as long as the eggs are fluffy and the bread is soft. The cooks definitely have that down at this restaurant.

Brought me a strawberry scone instead of the chocolate chip one I ordered.\n\nFood: I had their special fritta, and it was overdone and rubbery. The potatoes were dry and there was no saving them with any amount of ketchup or hot sauce. I'm also vegetarian and I got a piece of bacon in my potatoes. Let me say that I asked if they were vegetarian before ordering them. Not my day. I also ordered their scone of the day which was chocolate chip. I never got to try this. My sister ordered the biscuits and gravy which she said was delicious.  My husband had the Blackstone Egg Benedict. He said it was okay, but missing some seasoning. His potatoes were also dry. The beignets were good, but nothing to rave about. \n\nIncident: When the scone came, I took a little bite. I started to realize something was off. Turns out they had brought me a strawberry sconce instead. I'm highly allergic to strawberries. I never mentioned this since the scone was supposed to be chocolate chip. Management came to talk to me and they took my name and number. We got the bill and there was no adjustment for this incident. The manager said she sent over a chocolate chip scone, but we never got it. After talking to the manager she couldn't take the scone off, she finally took the part of my meal of. She did call to check on me later that day, but you could tell it was just to cover themselves.

It always makes me happy when I am able to dine at a local spot that does not have much pretension to offer. but that does offers all of the nit and grit of a unique breakfast-centric eatery.\n\nThis fusion sort of establishment offers a little Tex-Mex, a little Nawlins' flare, and a whole lot of craftiness in the kitchen. It gets packed in, so get ready to wait or take your order ta' go.\n\nMy buddy really wanted an egg sandwich, so luckily, I found him one. Friend with no egg sandwich make friend angry. Anyway, we ordered up one of those fried egg and bread combinations and a lonesome beignet.\n\nThe beignet was outstanding, a little heartier than one hailing from the wondrous New Orleans. It provided a touch of denseness, being more flat than usual, and the doughy center was just spot on. The Big Easy fried dough seems to be a little crispier and a little airier.\n\nThe egg sandwich was good, and I very much enjoyed the cinnamon raisin toast. Hands down, the best part was the sweet, supple tomato. You cannot make a good \"fresh\" sandwich without a great tomato slice. The egg was good, though a touch too cooked for my taste.\n\nAll in all, a fine breakfast joint, but the service was a bit off.

I have been going there almost every weekend for a year and I still can't get enough. The specials keep me from getting tired of the usual things on the menu. \n\nBut, although I love this place and have given it 5 stars I will be honest about the bad parts. I was a hotel and restaurant major so I do see where some of the negative reviews are coming from.\n\nBAD\n1. Wait staff could use a few more sessions of training, if they even got any\n            a. Service can be slow\n            b. They can be rude\n\n2. Location can be good or bad depending on your circumstances. I live in Pacific Heights so it is pretty far to travel just for breakfast, however I have a car and can always find close parking right on third street so it makes it very convenient if I have errands to run that day where I need my car.\n\n***I have never had any problems with my food so I cannot comment on why people have said they can be inconsistent\n\nGOOD\n1. Food is amazing\n        a. It is unique or hard to find New Orleans food\n        b. Beignets are mouth watering..steamy hot that melts in your mouth\n        c. Crab cake is sinful, perfect amount of spices and herbs\n        d. Homemade turkey sausage patty was my addiction for months \n        e. Biscuits are sooo good, homemade and steamy hot\n\n2. It is not pretentious (I wear sweats most of the time I go there) Customers are very friendly too.\n\n3. Coffee is quite different than the typical coffee that I've had. I know someone who knows the owner of the restaurant and they say that she gets the coffee from New Orleans.\n\n4. There is a decent wait and a list that you have to put your name on, and yes I know waiting sucks but it is a good sign if there is a wait because that means the food is worth waiting for by locals plus they give you free coffee outside...unlike Mama's on Washington Square.\n\nBasically, whenever my family comes out to visit me I always take them there and I will be going there until they either close or I move.

The home fries are basically fried potatoes. They were not too crispy on the outside, yet they were well seasoned. We ordered the Beignets to go just because we were way too full from our meal. The Beignets are light, fluffy New Orleans-style donuts, smothered in powdered sugar. They were only $5 for 3 of them. What a deal! Since we got them to-go, it looked deflated in the to-go box.

Since being convicted and sentenced to eating brunch (if anything, Anthony Bourdain notes that brunch is the toilet pit of meals, a mishmash of sewage from leftover dinner materials) I figured I'll make the best of it. \n\n\"Just For You\" embodies the worst of SF dreck. I understand that having a line out the door at 2PM for BRUNCH can engender a sense of misplaced entitlement. That, however, does not excuse the fact that prices listed on the outside menu are drastically lower than the actual prices. $10 for glorified eggs and bacon? Fine, you're boutique. You serve dishes gluten-free upon request. But don't litter your windows with signs that say \"we reserve the right to pour coffee on your phone\" or \"we like your baby, but not your stroller.\" Or, list items like soy milk on your menu but bold the statement underneath \"we might have it sometimes, but don't count on it.\" \n\nIt gets worse. The food came out late and and polenta sausage special would be pretty good if it wasn't lukewarm. I was mid bite through my meal when the wait staff came to try and clean our plates resulting in a literal tug of war between customer and waiter over half eaten breakfast sausage. No apology but still, no biggie. I dug around the other reviews beforehand and found comments about the excellent service. Maybe our server had a bad day but for the entire waiting staff and management embody this lassez-faire, f-you attitude is unacceptable. We attempted to split $85 on 4 credit cards, which is reasonable; yet, we were rudely asked for IDs. Are we in line at Vegas?\n\nThe incident that launched a thousand ships is when the receipts came back and I was charged $3.90 when I requested a $19 charge. I informed the waiter in hopes of making sure they got the tip they deserved. She came back telling me they actually charged $19 on the card but the receipt didn't reflect that. I remarked that it was disingenuous and proceeded to sign the receipt. She then bitches at me demanding why it was disingenuous when she already explained to me what happened. I understand that, lady, but my receipt is also a legal document that details payment. You can't just go ahead and smudge an extra $15.10 and call it square. At that point, i signed the receipt for $3.90 and submitted it to AMEX the very next day.

The first few bites were a little underflavored.  To my annoyance there was no hot sauce so I just corrected the salt and added some pepper and... wow.  That was some damn good soup.  You know it's good, when every bite brings out a little more to your tongue, a little nuance to things, and your smile gets wider and wider.  It was one of those soups that builds a half hour smile.\n\nThe iced tea was decent too.  I know it's kind of lame to build a whole review off an iced tea, bowl of soup, and a trip to the bathroom, but I think I've discovered a new go to breakfast and lunch place and I can't wait to try everything else.", "author": "Gil S."}

They are a house specialty and worth the splurge. (plus it helps you can get just one, more than that would be dangerous).\n\nHouse turkey sausage can be skipped. I've had better from the grocery store.\n\nOatmeal pancakes should not be skipped. They are outstanding. A moist and flavorful yet light batter that tastes even better when using some of the leftover powdered sugar from above.\n\nAnd if you are digging lunch, the veggie burger is nothing memorable, but the wheat bread it comes on is (all their bread is house made).\n\nHelpful tip: Dining solo is not advice because 1) you need someone to help you sample everything and 2) the wait for a counter spot is longer than twos and fours waiting for a table.\n\nFortunately there is free coffee while you countdown to those pancakes.", "author": "Jason B."}

This would be based on mediocre service, \"pretty good\" and generously portioned dishes, and the cash or check only thing usually doesn't work well for me.\n\nHowever... my recent experience convinced me to add that fourth star.  Actually, after today's experience I would've given five stars if not for the aforementioned reasons.\n\nToday, I realized something about myself.  As I sat at the counter, facing the exposed kitchen area, I saw three men working the stove, toasters, and prep counters.  All men.  On the wall beside the entry to the kitchen, was a sign: \"Danger Men Cooking.\"  Cute.  \n\nThen I realized - wow, I really dig men in the kitchen!  Seriously.  I didn't realize how comfortable I was knowing a man was in the kitchen.  ALL my life, I've been spoiled with men cooking for me.  My father, my brother-in-law, my brother, ex-fiance.  My fondest childhood memories are of my father cooking up huge breakfasts on the weekends.  To this day, he is known for his breakfast feasts.  My hips are now paying the price.\n\nWho knew that men in the kitchen would be such a \"security blanket\" for me!?  At any rate, there was something so comforting for me to see/feel this today at JFY.  \n\nAside from the testosterone element in the kitchen, in case you weren't aware, I LOVE BEIGNETS.  And when I say LOVE beignets, I really mean, \"will-fly-to-Cafe-du-Monde-on-a-whim-for-some-beignets\" kind of LOVE.  And, with no pending trips to the Big Easy anytime soon, these beignets will suit me just fine. Lovely texture, perfectly sized, not too greasy, not too dough-y.  \n\nOther than that, service is kinda spotty - not consistent.  Plus, I don't really like having to ask for more water and coffee, esp. when I'm at the counter facing you.  I appreciate the very cool vintage decor and the convenience of an ATM in the neighboring liquor store.  My other favorite here: the cornmeal pancakes.  Reasonable prices and I appreciate the menu selections - not too overwhelming, but great variety for breakfast/brunch/lunch.  Nice, hearty diner which every decent neighborhood needs.\n\nThis is the perfect place for hangover grub - well, I haven't been hungover in a looong time, but from what I remember... wait, I actually can't remember.

I said every brunch spot will most likely be packed and we'll have to wait an hour. Especially since it was warm out. I also wanted to try a new spot. We saw the menu and yelp reviews and were sold by the beignets. \n\nWe waited a long time. Not quite sure how long, but it felt like 45 minutes. I guess the trick is to put your name down and stroll over to the DogPatch Saloon for a drink and come back. We saw several people doing this, although one group totally lost their spot when their name was called and they were nowhere to be found. I don't get why this place draws groups of 5-8 but it took forever for us to get seated. It normally is not a big deal, but our friend had to catch a flight. \n\nThe menu has options galore. Every imaginable breakfast/brunch item is on here. That made it hard for me to choose. The beignets were very tasty and much bigger than the ones you get at Cafe Du Monde. I give them 5 stars for these.\n\nThe rest of my food was not so great. It was partly my fault for rushing and ordering their veggie hash omelette. The filling was sweet potato, bell peppers, swiss cheese and onions. I also ordered their biscuits. The portion is so big here. Eating sweet potato and then regular home fried potatoes and biscuits were a carb overload. There was just way too much sweet potato and not enough of the other vegetables. It was a big pile of sweet potato. \n\nI definitely want to come back and try other items on the menu, but will definitely steer clear away from this veggie hash.

We ordered the 3/$4. I hadn't had beignets since I went to New Orleans a few years ago. I asked the waitress if she recommended the homemade turkey sausage patty or the chicken apple and she said she didn't eat meat. \n\nRather than go into a whole discussion about whether or not she didn't eat it for religious, health or PETA reasons, I left well enough alone. But I still wonder how you can serve something you've never eaten. What if it tastes like crap? Can you still hand someone crap? I guess so.\n\nAnyway, she brought out 2 beignets covered in powered sugar. They looked like pillows of powdery goodness - I wanted to lay my head down on them. Then our waitress comes back a couple minutes later and says, \"You ordered 3 beignets?\" Well, I didn't know that you could order them individually?! It's 3/$4! Sheesh.\n\nThey were great and I really just didn't care about the rest of my breakfast after that. I wanted to order about a dozen more to go, but knew that they probably wouldn't be good unless they were blazing hot. I ended up getting the turkey apple sausage, which was a bit on the dry side, but flavorful. My eggs were eggs, cornbread was whatever, and I'm not a fan of homefries, but they were decent. I liked the atmosphere and will go back for beignets. Oh yes. The 4-star rating is for their beignets. Food I would give like 2 stars.

After getting there a bit on the late side (around 11:30am on a Saturday) we were surprised to find that we could get a table for 4 in about 10 minutes! And the place isn't big. Sure, it's not as small as you would think at first glance, as there are a few extra tables in the back that you can't see from the outside, but it's still not big. Nonetheless, I was surprised to get a table so fast because there was  small crowd gathered outside, waiting to try out Just For You. \n\nEventhough the (probably new) hostess had very little idea what she was doing, we found our table and the waiter came by quickly and took our drink orders. It was crowded we were still about to place our orders in about 7min, and our food was out in about 20min after sitting down. \n\nI had Greg's Scramble with Chorizo (about $9). It was amazing. If you haven't been here before, seriously, start with this. You don't have to get it with Chorizo as there are tons of options, ranging from spinach and mushroom to all sorts of meats. It was fantastic. Oh wait, I said that already. It doesn't matter. It's was brilliant. Other people wanted by food. \n\nSkip the grits and go with the home fries. Ok, maybe I'm a bit bias as I don't really like grits, but the home fries are fantastic. \n\nThe Beignets (about $4) are donuts with a layer of powdered sugar. I was a bit disappointed that they came out AFTER our actual food had, but that didn't stop us from eating them. They were great. Soft and moist and obviously very very sweet.

Totally defines 'comfort food'. However, today I came in and they were a little more busy - the main entree I bought was okay, but the bigness, not so much. Ordinarily I LOVE their beignets but I'm guessing since they were so busy (and possibly understaffed, I only saw two people in the kitchen) they were not paying attention to how long they were cooking. I definitely know they were not cooked long enough or the oil was way too hot - raw in the middle!!! No Bueno, definitely not okay, hence the bump down to three stars. However, they were very understanding, comped us the cost of the beignets, and made us a few more fresh ones (more cooked through but still obviously yeasty in the middle).

No longer, we are on the hunt for new brunch spots...\n\nJust For You came up as a top pick, so even though it was a bit out of the way for us, we got there very early to beat the crowd (and boy was there a crowd as we were leaving).  The place is pretty small - probably seating 20-25 people max.  We didn't have to wait too long (even after having our name called without the entire party being there - we were next on the list), but we got there at around 10:45 (practically breakfast time).  \n\nI was STARVING by the time we sat down, and I made a beeline for the savory menu items.  There were a few specials (an eggs bene and a few other items), but the Mexican menu items - breakfast burrito and huevos rancheros - called to me.  I couldn't decide, so the waiter suggested I get the huevos rancheros because the spicy red meat sauce was delicious.  And, of course, we ordered beignets for the table.\n\nOur beignets didn't come out until after our brunch entrees (we had to remind the busboy) which was a bummer since we were hoping to dig into those before our entrees arrived.  With both appetizer and entree at the table, it was tough to decide which food item should get cold.  For the most part, it was the beignets - Sandy H. prodded us into eating as many beignets as we could before they got cold.  Too late.  :(  The couple of bites of hot beignet that I had were good, but they weren't the delicious, melt-in-your-mouth ones that I remember from New Orleans.  But, alas, this is San Francisco, not New Orleans.  I enjoyed my huevos rancheros - can't say I'm a huevos rancheros expert but the spicy red meat sauce was very tasty.  \n\nWe got an unfortunate table in the back of the restaurant between the kitchen and the front of the restaurant and right next to a loud ice machine and soda refrigerator.  Not ideal, but not a real ding in my book - but if you're picky about that kind of stuff, you may want to let them know.\n\nIf this place was around the corner from me, I'd probably be a regular because despite the mediocre to average service, the food was solid and the prices were reasonable (brunch with coffee came to ~$12 including tax and tip).", "author": "Wendy L."}

Good flavors all around melded together to be a whopping bonanza of balance and each bite led me into deeper territory within my own appetite, I was actually scared to go there.

I placed my order at 11:04 and was told it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. I arrived and paid at 11:17, then stood outside until my lukewarm box was unapologetically handed to me at 11:40.

Where ever I go I try the eggs Benedict because it reminds me of home with my family, this one didn't quite bring me home. It was served on bread instead of English muffins, which would have been a great twist on the eggs Benedict if there were something great about the bread. My son had pancakes which he enjoyed. He's four. I felt bad for the server because he was running around like crazy. It adds a different feel to your experience when your watching someone run through the service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-10-16", "description": "Alright... knockin' off the dust on my keyboard and brain, I thought I should do a couple of reviews! I been eatin' here and there, and one of the most recent joints was Good For Your Cafe, and I DID NOT leave unsatisfied! \n\nMe and the GF wanted some breakfast and wanted to try to hit up a new place, so a friend / fellow foodie suggested this cafe, said it was \"hella good\". We found it pretty easily and with parking right in front (it was 730am, so naturally we were the early birds, no lines, no wait, smooth service). So we get in, sit down, and READ the menu, while at the same time wiping off the drool that would fall onto the menu. The menu is extensive and very appetizing to read. After a few minutes of, \"what do you think?\", \"I dunno...?\", and \"this or that?\", we finally made our decisions. \n\nI got the chili and scrambled eggs, and the GF goes for the huevos rancheros, and since this place claims to be \"the best beignets in the city\", we ordered 2 for desert (or is it dessert?) Both dishes were plentiful, no need to eat more than your share, lest you plan to roll out in a wheelchair. \n\nSo I get my dish and dig in... awesome! The chili is beefy with the right amount of tang and a little spice. Underneath the chili was chopped onion, and then the scrambled egg, which was seasoned just right, and with perfect fluff. Then there was the cheese melted all over, which was good enough to make the dish dee-lish (I mean who doesn't love cheese, right?). However, what really brought the dish together and put on another level to set it apart from all other scrambled egg dishes, was the homemade cornbread lying underneath this savory concoction! The cornbread was fresh, fluffy, and sweet, which worked as the perfect companion with the tangy and subtle spice of the chili. The entire dish reacts wonderfully together, and if left me full and ready for a nap (I normally don't wake up this early). \n\nThe GF's plate, the huevos rancheros was also well done. The sauce that went with the eggs had just the right spice, no need for Tabasco with that sauce! However, the tortilla didn't really do much for the plate, and of course you need a tortilla for a plate like this if you plan on calling it \"huevos rancheros\", but then again I am being bias in my assessment. What can I say, I grew up on homemade huevos rancheros by a Latina mother. Either way, both dishes were great. \n\nFinally, after feeling like we're going to explode, we remembered our beignets... should left some room, but then again, Im'a trooper! So we got our beignets, super fresh and moist from the kitchen! There was plenty of powdered sugar, so additional toppings are purely gratuitous... so I added a bit of maple syrup... and then... AWESOME! After that, I was done... D-U-N-N! \n\nSo, as you can see, I was blown away by the food. Now a quick word on the environs of the joint. The place is decorated with a homely feel. The walls were colored in light beige. And there were also framed posters from what appeared to be the owner's favorite movies. They had one of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and another one of Clint Eastwood's western movies, and other assorted prints.  However, like most breakfast/brunch joints in the city, they're small, so no reservations, just long lines.  So if you want to be able to get in and relax and enjoy individual service, get in EARLY!!!!", "author": "Jo R."}

The home fries were undercooked (the potato was still hard) and again the nasty stale oil smell and taste.

I have yet to try the famous beignets but those are next on my to-eat list. \n\nWith food this good, do expect a wait to be seated on the weekend.  It is also not uncommon to find the place bustling during the weekday mornings as well.  If there is a wait, put your name on the list that hangs by the front door.  Historically, I have not had to wait longer than 20 minutes. \n\nThe one downside to the restaurant I would say is the service; it doesn't always live up to expectations.  I have certainly had worse but I have also had much better.  Your order will be taken quickly (know what you want and be ready when the server arrives) but it's not unusual to not see the server again for a long while.  On my last visit, I sat at the counter and my iced tea glass sat empty for about 15 minutes even though the cafe was not overly busy.  Not a huge deal but disappointing. And definitely not going to affect me from returning!", "author": "Bridget A."}

With waitresses. Date night with my daughter plus pregnancy cravings? Not a recipe for success.\n\nMy husband found Just For You by googling \"comfort food,\" and the minute he read the menu to me, I knew where I was going. They had me at \"hushpuppies.\" \n\nWe got there, scored rock-star parking, and I entered with my toddler in tow. Here was the real test. Because you know the only thing people hate more than toddlers on a plane (I'm tired of these motherfuckin' toddlers on my motherfuckin' plane!) is toddlers in a restaurant. And the \"no stroller\" sign scared me, because sometimes the stroller is the easiest place to feed the child... but we didn't have it with us and I bravely entered the establishment.\n\nThe waitress/hostess could not have been friendlier or more delightful. I stressed that I didn't want to bug anyone and she found me a great little private spot in their back room. And magically, my daughter behaved almost perfectly, eating happily and then strolling about in a friendly fashion, stopping to \"chat\" with various patrons without being intrusive if I do say so myself.\n\nAnywho, here's the information you need if you don't have a toddler: Huge. Plates. Of food. Crabcakes. Hushpuppies. Amazing fries. I mean, as I type this, it's blustery and rainy outside, and just the memory of the warm, heart-meltingly delicious crab cakes warms my soul.

There's usually a few daily specials so make sure you check out the specials on the menu. I've only ever had some type of egg dish when I've gone but they have been consistently done well.\n\nYou can get fruit instead of potatoes or whatever carb comes with your meal. I usually get the grits; add a bit of sugar and I'm good to go. You get the normal selection of breads but you can also get cornbread which I had for the first time on my last visit. It's a big hunk of cornbread and I almost didn't finish it. But it was some good cornbread and I don't have the opportunity to get cornbread often so I powered through and finished. They have homemade jam/preservatives for each table; this most recent visit it was blackberry.\n\nThere's usually a good wait on the weekends some come prepared if you're a late riser. They usually have some coffee outside for you while you wait though. They bring the food fairly quick so aside from some people not having the sense of mind to realize people are waiting outside the tables turn pretty quickly. But if you have a large group you may have to wait as the space is limited inside and it's not ideal for large groups.\n\nThe only negative this most recent visit was the decaf coffee. It just tasted old and weak. I'm no coffee expert but it was not good and it left a horrible after taste. \n\nAll in all this is a good breakfast/brunch spot and I will stop in often.", "author": "Paul B."}

The whole thing didn't meld together.  They picked bread that was too chewy on the inside (instead of light and fluffy) and not crisp enough on the outside. Shrimp was good but there were only 6 pieces in the sandwich (for almost $10 I expect it to be stuffed with shrimp not layed out individually where I can easily count how many).\n\nI also tried the fish and chips.  The fries were good and so was the fish, but the fish batter was soggy and kept falling off.  For me the key to fish and chips is the batter so a big thumbs down here.  Especially since no vinegar was available at the table.   The tarter sauce was pretty nice though - had lots of pickle relish in it.  And the portions were huge - 3 fish fillets.  I couldn't finish.\n\nThe highlight of the menu has to be the beignets, and I would go so far to say it is the sole reason to eat here.  For $4 you get 3 huge beignets dusted in sugar which will inevitably find it's way all over your clothes.  Well worth the sacrifice though.", "author": "Jean K."}

Also, the cooks are super fast, so even if they are busy, the wait for food is never excessive. Have the beignets and chicory coffee, or a pint sized mimosa (fresh grapefruit/Cypress Mimosa is the best), or delicious fresh juices (some organic) are another great option. Things not to miss: Chilaquiles and Corned Beef (both are specials, so get 'em when you have any opportunity), New Mexico Green Chile sauce (made with Hatch chiles and taste like the real deal according to my friends from New Mexico. It can be SUPER hot depending on the batch of chiles, so taste with caution if you are sensitive.), Reuben Sandwich on Rye or Huevos Rancheros. Some more of my favorites are the Oatmeal Pancakes (wheat free!) Cobb Salad and the house burger, which I get on Gluten-Free toast (keep in mind this is not a \"gluten-free\" facility, so cross-contamination is always a possibility).

Which is a shocking surprise to a lot of people since everyone knows I pretty much eat every meal out.  Yes that's right, I'm really \"Kitchen Challenged\" and my motto on that is well, you have to eat to survive so you might as well enjoy it right?!  I have been to hundreds of SF restaurants and while I am an avid Yelp user I have yet to give back to the community that I have taken so much from!  So it's time to change that and get my Yelp on so here goes:\n\nI sat down at Just for you Cafe with two friends as I declared I am going to write my first yelp review on this place so come on Cafe impress me! I loved the menu options.  Great variety, nice bread selection you have the standards white, wheat, etc but also biscuits, scones, or cornbread to choose from, where do you see all of those choices for no additional charge!? \n\nNext pleaser was that they let me modify my scramble.  I love to modify anyone who has dined with me knows this.  Sometimes I modify to the point where I am ordering something so completely different its like a whole new menu item, well they let me do this at Just for You, so if your like the Sally from when Harry met Sally type like me then you will love this place. \n\nThis really cool looking server took our order and then he disappeared and then this place started to loose it's charm.  We had a different server through every step of the dining process which I guess could be cool because then you could pretty much ask any of the serves for things but the challenge was actually getting one of them to come to the table after they dropped off the food.  I was having a painfully difficult time trying to get any kind of drink refill so that was an irritation. \n\nOk the real important part: the food.  The food was decent.  I really liked that they had pepper grinders on the table, so you have have free rein of how much pepper you want to add and not give your poor server a sore wrist trying to grind pepper on your food when you don't tell them to stop right away because you really like a lot of pepper- that's me ;)  That being said the food was not so excellent that it did not need a ton more spices like pepper and hot sauce so nothing to write home about. The portions were filling but not out of control so huge \"I can't eat for the rest of the day\" sizes which is nice.  Because I like to be able to go out to dinner later.    \n\nTip: I hear this place can have a long line but we got there around 2 so I think the brunch crowd was thinning out so if you can wait that long without starving I say go then.", "author": "Marlene S."}

There was a table, we sat down and loved the menu, there was something for meat eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians and vegans.  Food arrived quickly, it was fresh, cooked perfectly, tasty and the portion sizes were refreshingly filling (another happy change from SF's new normal).  The prices are amazingly reasonable.

I felt like I could have ordered 95% of the menu and been happy, but I limited myself to a beignet and the Cowgirl breakfast: eggs, two pancakes, and a choice of link sausage or bacon.\n\nThe beignet was astounding. I'd been expecting a delicate little powderpuff, but the powdered-sugar-coated delight that arrived at the table was gargantuan. Still warm from the fryer, the beignet was the perfect partner for the raspberry jam kept on the table.

And since I live down the street, why not go here for a Sunday brunch. \n\nI love their menu (also there is a link to their website so peruse it before you show up so you know what to get once you sit down).

I ordered the Cowboy which is nothing more than a French Toast breakfast w/ two eggs over-easy and three bacon strips. Crispy thick bacon, so yummy!!! Then of course I got a small bite off of Aaron's Beignets, so yummy! Who can pass up light fluffy donuts w/ powdered sugar on top? If you can't eat it there then take it to go.

Now, here I am, splayed out like a sloth after a 32 inch run, on the sofa writing a glowing fucking review for yet another local eatery. \n\nYa ya, Potrero Hill/Dog Patch/3rd Street/Bayshore is so hot right now. It's true, cool kids with and without their cool new bikes and/or babies were thicker than oatmeal but the J4U staff hummed with wry efficiency. \n\nI love efficiency in a diner, especially on Sunday faux-morning (1PM). All the things you want minus all the frilly crap you can do with out. Beverages filled, topped off without query, sides and add-ons delivered with a friendly briskness that bespoke the Beaches of Normandy level traffic hitting the joint. \n\nCorned beef hash was good with plenty of textural variety that makes hash fun (fatty, crispy, meaty bits all in happy coexistence a bit like Malaysia but that's a different story), biscuits were reasonable and plentiful, gravy was spot on with a pretty perfect viscosity (dippable but not runny) and meat bit ratio (well flavored but not requiring additional chewing). The wing-woman who makes it all worth while's crab cake Benedict thing was good; solid, earthy, herby with a pinch your nose good hollandaise well slathered. \n\nThe bar lacks bag hooks and the stools are oddly wide spaced, no elbow jostling here. \n\nIt's good.

I wasn't quite expecting it to be as large as it was, but it was delicious down to the last bite. The hash was also very good, as was the fresh carrot-apple juice. I found that the sweetness of the apples balances the root-y taste/texture of the carrots very well. \nThey were also very accommodating, as we had two friends who wanted to join us after we had already ordered, and they made sure to move us to a table of four - while still seating the people who had been waiting in line.", "author": "Ji K."}

Went for a long run Sunday morning and was famished but still was unable to stomach the food.  We sat in the back near the kitchen and the malodorous wafts of air from within was stomach turning.  Orange juice tasted like dishwater. Chicken sausages were dripping with grease. Oversized cake slice of scone was dry and unpalatable.

Since I'm not a participant in the weekend breakfast cult and brunch is demystified in my eyes, listen up.\n\nFirst off, what seemingly appeared to be a crowd milling around in front led to a 10 minute wait. So far so good. (Breakfast cultists are willing to wait far longer than I and I assumed that is what I was in for here).\n\nThe menu left me unimpressed, even for a place that is going for an unassuming menu. Nothing really jumped out at me and I had to settle for a two egg breakfast. \n\nThe food was uninspired, bland fare.  Almost warm potatoes and bread that wasn't all that was promised.

Went there for the first time today with my wife and some out of town friends. Maybe it was less busy because of the Pride Parade, but we were seated quickly and though cozy, our table was a good fit for four. I got the corned beef hash with two perfectly poached eggs and some hearty slices of homemade rye. The hash was great - not too dry as is often my issue with in-house recipes. It had a nice mix of peppers and onions but no potatoes which I know some people like but I was OK without. The rye was thicker than the store bought stuff and only needed a touch of butter to complement the hash and softly poached eggs. Coffee was what I expected and the service was fast,  friendly, and unintrusive - precisely what it ought to be! Everyone at our table was happy with their food which made me happy since I chose the place.

Then come right in to this cozy little restaurant and enjoy a homecooked meal served with a smile.\n\nJust For You has long been a breakfast and brunch staple for many, as you can see from the line out the door every weekend.  People come for their American/Southern/Mexican insipired meals, and especially for their beignets, which are heavenly on a chilly SF morning.  They also make great grits, which are a personal favorite of mine.\n\nBut what most Weekend Warriors forget is that there are other days and other meals to be enjoyed at Just For You.  I stopped in recently for lunch and had a delicious pastrami sandwich with some of the best cole slaw I have had in a very long time.  It was nice to be in there without the frantic rush of the weekend crowds, and to not have hungry faces peering in the window wondering when your table was going to be free.  I could even hear the classical guitar music playing on the speakers - so nice.\n\nAnother thing that I learned was that they have loaves of their homemade bread for sale.  I bought a loaf of the dense, hearty whole wheat bread which sliced up nicely for morning toast the next day.  It made me think back to stories of an era gone by of kids being sent to the local bar to pick up a pail of beer for the family's dinner.\n\nIn today's world of fewer and fewer comforts, a fairly priced, comforting meal can go a long way.

But luckily there was a convenience store next door, so I was able to rehydrate with a massive coconut water. For those that drink coffee, there was free coffee in front.  We finally got a table and quickly ordered two of their signature GIANT mimosas. I honestly couldn't even finish it. I mean it looked orange, but I couldn't tell if there was even any OJ in it. lol. We also ordered their beignets to start. So yummy!! They were large, fluffy, and covered with powdered sugar. We got to deck them out further with maple syrup and jam. OMFG. After much indecisiveness, I decided on their omelette of the day: sun dried tomatoes, broccoli, chicken apple sausage, onions, cheese and home fries. Delicious. I could tell my friends were totally impressed with their dishes as well, because as soon as the food arrived, and the forks were inserted into our mouths, complete silence followed...and we're a pretty chatty crew, so that's saying a lot. The restaurant in general is also super cute and quirky. I hope I don't read a review where anyone is complaining about the wait for this place, because it's worth EVERY second.  We all left feeling totally full, and super loopy. I'm not sure if that's because we went out the night prior, the mimosas were super strong, the white stuff on the beignets wasn't really \"powdered sugar\", or if the food was really just THAT good...but whatever the reason, totally happy.\n\nNote: Make sure to try the Filipino sausage.

Just For You Cafe has got it figured out!!!! We went in here for brunch and waited a good 35 minutes for a table inside. It was TOTALLY worth the wait. They move people in and out of there so fast, and the servers, busers, and hostess are all smiling and pleasant despite the chaotic atmosphere (it's only chaotic because it is so busy because it is that good). We started out with an order of beignets considering it was mardi gras time and we were really missing those french donuts. They were hands down the best beignets we've had outside of Louisiana. Yuuummmm. We all ordered the breakfast burrito with slight variations. All three of us thoroughly enjoyed our burritos and breakfast potatoes. We also ordered a side of the biscuits and thought they were great. I am looking forward to our next outing, at JFYC.

We decided to have brunch together at San Francisco's Dogpatch (even though I was nervous about seeing tons of dogs), so the alarm was set for 11am, but we did not leave until about 12:15pm.  We took the T-Line and in to time we arrived at Just For You.  The wait did not seem long so we wrote our name down for 3 on a yellow pad by the door.  We walked around the the block to see what else was around and when we got back, we were seated after a few minutes.  \n\nCeleste: \"Hey, why did they skip us?\"\nSi-Eun: \"They are only party of 2, harder to seat party of 3\"\nKitty: \"I think we're next\"\nCeleste: \"Yeah, looks like it from the list\"\nKitty: \"Wait a minute... is that lady trying to steal our table inside?\"\nCeleste: \"Hmmm... I think so, what is she thinking?\"\nSi-Eun: \"She's probably asking the staff member if she and her family can have our table...\"\n\nThe staff member walks out followed by the lady trying to steal OUR table.  He looks at the list and says that there was a party before them (that was us) and could not seat them inside.  She looked at us and gave me a dirty look, but I smiled at her before going inside.  Just because she had a baby in a stroller, she thought he can cut in line... no f'ing way, she's not special.  Okay, moving on...\n\nI am so in-love with the BEIGNETS (light, fluffy New Orleans-style donuts, smothered in powder sugar)!  I was expecting it to be bite-size and surprised to see it so big... like cute little pillows.  It was very yummy and paired well with my tall serving of mimosa, which gave me a good buzz at 2pm.  The menu is great (the design was simple, yet it was fun to look at), and there are tons of different kinds of food I would have never expected to see including Longanisa (Filipino sausage).  I had two-eggs (over-medium, though they made it over-easy) with home fries, cornbread, and turkey-apple sausage. \n\nGood food, great service, not a single dog in sight, okay crowd, easily accessible by public transportation... I'll be back here again soon -- if anything I will come back for some BEIGNETS!\n\nThis was written on the menu -- it's hilarious (just like some of the other posters about cell phones and stuff):\n\"What's grits?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-22", "description": "dogpatch 1/21/12\n\nJust for you has been just near me since I moved to the dogpatch a little more than a year ago. I am moving away soon and really wanted pancakes so figured I'd come full circle and return to the diner I ate at a bunch of times when I first came out here.\n\nFirst off, my how times have changed. Waiting lists to sit at the counter, dogs and crowds, babies and coffee, all hovering on the street outside, the neighborhood has really come onto the radar.\n\nMy breakfast was simple: Corn meal pancakes, a 1 pint mimosa, bacon, and coffee.\n\nLet me just start by saying that the meal was incredible. Somehow it wasn't but somehow it was, the pancakes kept whispering to me.. love us... love us....\n\nI sat at the counter after a long and chilly wait that was sort of my fault. I went next door to reno's to get cash and missed my name being called I guess. But when they came out and called another party, then another, then another till I was still the last guy standing there and my name still at the top of the list I began to wonder. Then when they escorted out a guy who had walked in alone, told him to put his name on the list, and then sat HIM, I asked the person if they had had an opeing for me, and pointed at my name. He looked at the list, seemed surprised to see my sad and lonely name, not scratched out in a sea of black ink and found me a seat. Mostly my fault but it was cold as hell and they were full, but not totally slammed. Something I would hope they checked on once or twice.\n\nI had time to look at the menu while waiting outside and knew what I wanted to order. The aformentioned pancakes, coffee, bacon and mimosa. My order was taken quickly, my food popped up in the window even faster, they were very busy but very on it.\n\nI have to say though that from stopping in a few times their food seems to have a lot of variation to it depending on who was in the kitchen. Sometimes the beignets looked fluffy like pillows, like they do at Brenda's, but sometimes they were darker flater crisps closer to east coast fried dough. I don't know what was going on any of those days, but today everything looked great.\n\nThe coffee was coffee, endless and warm and mixed by me with too much sugar and cream to say much about it. I liked it. It was the energizing hot elixer i needed to help me power through a very late brunchfest.\n\nThe bacon came out looking ironed and crisp and thick, I like something a little more greasy and hot, but it was good. Wafers of salty delight, especially when soaked in some syrup, they did have a tendency to crackle and sometimes melt away. Almost like crackers. It was also a large serving, long, wide, thick pieces, 4 or 5 of them. None of that shrimpy little tails nonsense.\n\nThe mimosa was LARGE and fresh and priced at A.Q. which apparently is eight bucks. It was cool and refreshing, mixed well enough that there were bubbles and the elegant touch of sparkling white wine, but it still kept the bulk and satisfaction of fresh juice. A thick wholeness to a drink spotted with light bubbles. It was refreshing and a stark contrast to my coffee(as it should be), it cleansed. \n\nFinally to the pancakes. They were also unassuming, some thick disk laid in front of me soaked in syrup that was rapidly disappearing. I liked that. Like a sponge the cakes fused with all the syrup I could throw at them. The amazing part was that the tops and bottoms stayed crisp. Like thin wafers, each toasted edge crackled as I cut and bit them, exposing the many celled walls within.\n\nThe insides were like a corn muffin, but so much more. They crumbled dryly, but dont be fooled. Once I had a bite in my mouth there was nothing dry about it at all, steamy and hot it became a sweet soft filling taste of joy, soaked in honied syrups. All at once they were crisp and light, moist and dense, delicious and wonderful. I scraped my plate clean.\n\nAll in all I had a surprisingly great experience and a wonderful meal, everything was unassuming and then wonderfully complex. Which brings me to the one off note, my breakfast after tax and tip was about $25. I spent that much at another place recently but also got eggs and home-fries. Hell, I spent that AT Just for you, and got more. The menu in the window showed prices lower than the ones inside. While I don't feel it wasn't worth it, I do feel that given their location and presentation and the fact that it was still pancakes, bacon and coffee poured out of a vat, or pulled off of a pile and served on plain bulk flatware that it could be a little lighter on the wallet.\n\nhttp://alwaysthefatkid.tumblr.com/", "author": "Raccoon S."}

Everyone else thought the same thing.   It was good though, we showed up, put our names on the list, and got a nice table outside that was indeed just for us.\n\nIt's too bad that this place is all the way in the dog patch, and required quite a trek to get there, because it could easily become one of my new regular brunch spots.  Deliciousness and large portions make Lauren a happy gal.  Its also one of those brunch places that is only open till 3:00 so they do what they do and they do it well.  I recommend this place too, because I ran into Mr. Yelp himself with his family and friend, and if Nish eats here...I should too.  :)\n\nMy mom and I split the Greg's special.  It's an omelet with spinach, goat cheese, garlic and onions, and split between the two of us it was a perfectly light brunch.  We opted to stay healthy and get fruit instead of home fries, but the fruit salad was fresh and full of variety.  I probably could have eaten more.  I usually can, and the beignets looked amazing, but my mom wasn't feelin the donuts, so it just gives me more motivation to head back at a later date.  The place is small.  The wait exists, and its cash only, but there are so many more things on that menu that I want to try.  Ill definitely be back.

It was after 1pm and the place was still busy! So I glanced at the menu posted on their window. Before getting here, I thought I wanted a bowl of soup to soothe me on this cold afternoon. However, after checking out their menu, I quickly changed my mind. I don't know if it was because I was starving, but just about everything on the menu from the pancakes, huevos rancheros to the po-boy's sounded so much more comforting! \n\nWe started with the beignets. WOW! Large doughy, air-filled pillows covered with lots of yummy powdered sugar. Melts in your mouth. They aren't exactly like the traditional tasting beignets in New Orleans, but close enough for me.\n\nI ended up getting two eggs with a grilled pork chop, grits, and homemade cornbread. That meal did it's job - my hunger was fulfilled and my soul was soothed. The cornbread was a little dry for me, but nothing that a little bit of jelly couldn't fix. The pork chop had just the right amount of seasoning and went well with my eggs. \n\nOther dishes on the table included the breakfast burrito (HUGE burrito filled with eggs, beans, and your choice of fillings), bowl of yogurt with fresh fruit and granola (this too, looked awesomingly delicious) and their pasta of the day, which was linguine with lots of veggies in a light sauce. Everyone was happy and satisfied with their choices. \n\nYoung, hip, and friendly staff!\n\nNOTE: Cash or check only. Yes, you can write a check for your food, odd as it sounds (My co-worker actually did so that day).", "author": "Kimberly S."}

As an early riser and resident of Potrero Hill, a convenient breakfast place is right up my alley.  We've given this place a few chances, and I hate to say it, but we're done.\n\nThe food isn't good, primarily because most of it is cooked incorrectly.  We've ordered beignets twice - raw in the middle (and we saw another table send an order of them back for this).  Hubby got eggs benedict - hollandaise was the consistency of water.  I ordered poached eggs - yolks were barley warm, and the eggs were served in a cup that had about an inch of water in it.  Bacon was so undercooked that it wouldn't keep it's shape at all when picked up - it slumped, dejectedly, as if it was embarassed to call itself bacon.  And the coffee isn't good, and is served lukewarm.\n\nI think this place would be GREAT if they got a couple new line cooks.  The wait staff are great - fast and efficient; the place is cute; and it's hard to find a decent breakfast (NOT BRUNCH) in this city.  But the food is simply not worth the $ - ten dollars for a plate of eggs, etc. and coffee is sort of expensive for breakfast, and you'd expect to get a great meal.

I pretty much always order the same thing (either a sandwich or salad).  Every time I order I am always paying a different price which can vary from cents to as much as a dollar - no biggie right?  I don't question because I like the food and the service is pretty quick with \"to-go\" orders.  \n\nToday I ordered my regular sandwich roast turkey (which is supposed to have mayo,mustard, pickles, tomatoes and lettuce) SIDE NOTE:  They have NEVER once put pickles or mustard on my sandwich even though I've asked every time.  Anyway - I ask for no lettuce and to add avocado and bacon instead (just like i do every time).  My wishes are always granted in those regards and I'm usually charged an extra $1.00 - $1.50 at the most.  Today was a different story,  I went from paying  $7.95 (something along those lines) to paying $12.10 FOR A F'ING SANDWICH.  Are you kidding me????  \n\nWhen I asked the host about the incorrect charge she told me that I had ordered a side of bacon and a side of avocado.  I corrected her and said NO, I wanted a little bit of each on the sandwich - something that shouldn't cost me an extra $5.00 being that the sandwich is listed on the menu as $6.95.  The girl/lady - whoever she was, then told me that it was going to be that way from now on and SORRY!   \n\nI think it's very poor customer service, at the very least she could have discounted the difference of what I usually pay and let me know for next time.  Now there's not going to be a NEXT TIME!!!!  I will never go back based on the service today.  \n\nOh - and another thing.  I don't know who she is, I assume the owner.  She was very rude to one of her employees.  She even rolled her eyes to the customer about him.  I made eye contact with another customer who was standing there waiting and he made an \"uh-oh\" face.  It was very weird and rude.\n\nOverall - the food is good when they get the order right and precise, I just won't be giving my paychecks to them anymore!!!!", "author": "RC V."}

Light and pillowy, could see the air escape as I cut into it. Chewy and tasty. At first I thought we would not be able to finish all three, but just mere seconds later I was wondering if we should order more to go. Not too sweet at all. YUM! \n\nBreakfast was also good. Since we planned on getting the beignets, I had to rethink my original plan of getting the Cowboy breakfast. Carbs, you know. So, I got the 2 eggs with sausage, biscuit and home fries. I really did not want the home fries or grits, but considering I ate half a watermelon in the morning did not want the fruit substitute ($1.75).  The  eggs and sausage were fine, though I would probably pick bacon next time. The best thing on the plate were the biscuits! Oh my goodness, light and flaky. After a little garnish of butter and jam, they were incredible.  So much for limiting the carbs, but it was worth it. Breakfast was about $25 for 2 people (including beignets).

It appeared we missed the breakfast/brunch crowd and were seriously lucky since we all were starving. I ended up with the Fried Egg Sandwich with bacon - and it was delicious!! The spicy mayo is really quite amazing, and the more tabasco sauce you add, the better it tastes - so I made mine super spicy!\n\nThe bf ordered the corned beef hash which was made fresh and not canned! It came with a side of potatoes and two slices of toast but was smokey & a little brackish. We ordered and shared three beignet's and sadly it wasn't enough for 4 hungry foodies. JFYC is known for these delicious soft chewy dough with dulcet powdered sugar - it was ahhhhmazing! The best beignets I've ever eaten.

Either the gravy is wrong (I've gotten brown gravy on biscuits before, or gravy made with bacon instead of sausage) or there's some other weird element messing it up (one place put scrambled eggs on TOP of the biscuits, then put the gravy on top of the eggs - what?) so suffice it to say, I have been craving proper Bs&G for a while now.\n\nJust For You hit it out of the ballpark.  The biscuits were fluffy and delicious, the perfect vehicles to soak up the generous amount of fresh, creamy sausage gravy.  Easily the best I've had in California.  My only, minor complaint was that the gravy was a little thin, but the taste was perfect, so I'll excuse it.\n\nMy tablemates also let me taste their cheesy grits and cornbread, both also excellent.

They were just like the beignets I had in New Orleans, but slightly chewier and covered with way more powdered sugar.  What a delicious way to start your meal!  Then I ordered two scrambled eggs with a ham steak, cornbread and grits.  The scrambled eggs were fine, and the ham steak was a bit overcooked and a bit too salty.  The cornbread was very fresh and still warm, although it was a bit too salty as well.  We also shared the buttermilk pancakes, which had a fluffy, yet doughy texture.\n\nBut none of that mattered much.  What I was looking forward to were the grits.  I LOVE grits.  Allow me to quote Just For You menu here: \"What's Grits?  It's that pasty white stuff . . . like you had in prison.\"  Just For You grits were a bit bland for my taste, but with the right amount of salt and pepper, and, perhaps, even butter, I was able to perfect the chef's creation.\n\nIt's no Waffle House--nothing is--but Just For You is as close to a great Southern diner as it gets.  I struggled with the rating, because this place is a true 4.5-star establishment.  Yep, it's a bit more than \"Yay!  I am a fan,\" but it's not quite \"Woo-hoo!  As good as it gets.\"  \n\nI can't wait to come back here for breakfast.  Parking is relatively easy to find, and the service is pretty friendly.", "author": "Yan G."}

I was disappointed to discover that because it was a holiday the only menu being offered was the weekend brunch menu (which does NOT include the Po-Boy).  So, my alternate choice was the Crabby Bennie....it's a Creole crab cake on poached egg over toast with hollandaise sauce.  I was given two choices...English muffin or their homemade bread which was pretty much a sourdough bread.  I'm a fan of sourdough so I couldn't pass up that option.   My dish also came with home fries.  I love a really good biscuit too so I ordered a side of that.\n\nMy mom ordered the special frittata (which was basically a vegetable omelette with some cheese) with grits and cornbread.\n\nWe also ordered beignets which the cafe describes as \"Fresh, Fluffy Pillows of Perfection.\"\n\nThe beignets were soooo good, that my mom wanted to order more for later.  They look like mini pillows dusted with powdered sugar.  The taste reminded me of funnel cake that I used to get as a kid at amusement parks.  \n\nMy Crabby Bennie was drenched in hollandaise sauce.  I should have requested the sauce on the side.  My dish was just so-so.  Super heavy because of the sauce, the thick slices of homemade bread, and the huge amount of home fries.  I couldn't finish my plate.  I only took one bite of the side of biscuits I got.  One bite was enough because it was really dry.\n\nI took a bite out of my mom's cornbread.  It was meh.  The cornbread at Momo's is by far the best I've had here in SF...so I end up using my cornbread experience at Momo's as my benchmark.\n\nMy friend ordered the catfish filet.  I didn't taste that dish because I just felt it was a little too early in the morning to eat heavily breaded fish.\n\nService wasn't great...quite slow.  Yes, they were busy but there were a few people to wait on the customers. I would give them 3 stars for service.  The additional star is for their really taste beignets.

I came with the same friend I went to brunch with and we split clam chowder (which was served tepid and underseasoned), pork chops with veggies (the veggies came straight out of a frozen bag and the pork required a chainsaw to cut apart and chew), and tilapia fish with pico de gallo (basically they drenched a tired old frozen piece of fish with tabasco sauce).

BAAAAADDD.\n\nI would warn you about the dinner service, I think this place has the potential to rise up to the occasion and clean up their act for dinner, since they are able to put out a great brunch service, but they really need to focus on a few simple, delicious dishes they are good at and cut out the dozens of other items they have on the dinner menu that they clearly aren't capable of making.

I knew there would be a wait, especially for a group, and everybody was apprised of this and impressed with the coffee-while-you-wait setup. We actually didn't wait too long, since we compromised the group dynamic by having 3 volunteers sit at the bar while the rest of us took a table. \n\nI'm also not complaining about the rapid changes to the neighborhood and is demographics, startling as they were. We actually found parking quickly, and the babies were all cute enough. I'm really not even complaining about the service, since the place is packed, although I think my girlfriend really needed more than one cup of coffee after last night, and my friend actually did want that milk and cornbread, even if it was sickening to imagine that she was going to pack it away alongside her Cowgirl breakfast. \n\nMy REALLY BIG PROBLEM is the hollandaise. I ordered the \"Special Scramble #1,\" which is basically 3 eggs, spinach, mushrooms, shrimp, and crab cake bits all scrambled and covered with hollandaise. Yum, right? I know, and I was really looking forward to dipping my home fries in some yolky, buttery, lemon-scented goodness. And then my food came.\n\nHollandaise sauce is made of egg yolks, butter, and lemon juice. All three of these foods are extremely YELLOW in color, and when emulsified into a sauce should coat a spoon or finger, like thick gravy or melted ice cream. I've eaten hollandaise sauce in many different places and at many different times. Some has been sublime, other sub par, and as long as it's not chunky I can usually cope. But never, ever, EVER have I encountered GRAY HOLLANDAISE SAUCE. Yes, gray. And chunky, like watery ricotta. It was like the discharge of various STDs is often described, actually. It was totally gonorrhea sauce. \n\nI sent my plate back before it even hit the table. I said, \"This is wrong, the sauce is broken.\" That was a vast understatement of what was the matter, but I figured any cook could look at my plate and instantly know what the problem was. However, when my plate came back it was simply with naked eggs---and A GIANT SIDE OF THE GRAY HOLLANDAISE. It looked exactly like the sides of grits other people were getting. I stuck my finger in the bowl to demonstrate that it was not a proper sauce, and got a finger full of grease and chunks of what appeared to be cooked egg yolks. It tasted and smelled like hard-boiled eggs. Who the fuck would serve that to somebody? Who the fuck would want that on their eggs? I told the runner they needed to make a new batch, and proceeded to eat my unsauced eggs.\n\nA few moments later a server came by, and told me that the kitchen could not make more hollandaise, that this was the batch for the day. OK, I know that this shit sits around, and I accept that fact because I love hollandaise and it usually doesn't make too much of a difference. But what I got should have been thrown out before it ever hit my plate, and I suspect it was never right to begin with. Plus, it only takes about 30 seconds to make, especially in the blender. I told the waitress that if they weren't going to make more sauce they needed to stop serving it to people, and at that point I didn't just mean me, I meant anybody who happened to eat at this restaurant that I've been raving about for 4 years---but then I saw a benedict come out, covered with the ghastly gray stuff.  \n\nIt makes me sad to see Just For You go downhill like that. You used to be able to taste the love, and now I detect a hint of absentee ownership and cheap kitchen labor. They've also taken my favorite sandwich, the veggie reuben, off of the menu. The three stars are for the courtesy coffee outside and the unbelievable begniets, which are still worth seeking out once in a while. But beware the hollandaise!", "author": "Sarah S."}

We then promptly threw down the perfect triple beverage order (water, coffee, mimosa) and proceeded to have one the most wonderfully indulgent brunches ever.  I mean, I'm pretty sure we ordered three sides of bacon.\n\nThese guys have one of the best brunch menus I've ever seen.

A diverse crowd of Dotconners and artist-types were already eating (do these people ever work?). \n\nUpon entering, the wonderful smell of baking yeasty type treats granted me a peak back into my youth-- my dad (a rocket scientist) is an amazing baker; this fact has certainly put a little tonnage upon me (should a 6'3\" vegetarian go 220, it is a fit-220), but it has also allowed me to really appreciate the sweet things.\n\nThe menu is quite nice as it appears you can order breakfast at anytime, but, being lunch, I ordered a Veggie Reuben and a beignet (I had to, I love beignets). My companion had grilled cheese and a salad which she enjoyed. It looked delicious.\n\nThe Reuben was beautiful and almost as hot as our waitress (you know the one :) ). The veggies were wonderfully cooked and the Reuben sauce was perfectly proportioned and seasoned. Really quite nice. The best part was that the rye bread (made in-house) was perfectly toasted-- I love it when the center is crunchy and moist while the crust is crunchy and chewy. Wow!\nGreat lemonade and appears to be 'endless'.\n\nI was really feeling 5 stars here (8 stars for the waitress)-- I know, I know. Rest assured that I am just looking at the menu and not ordering.\n\nThen I took a bite of beignet. How do I say this without sounding unclear?\nThe beignets are awful. Almost rancid.\nTasted totally store-bought mix to me. Too salty, consistency not good at all and too much powdered sugar (a thick layer of Gu that actually turned bitter. How is that possible?) and not enough of that deep-fried magic. \n\nIt could have been a bad day for the fry cook it could have been that the oil was either too new or too old, I guess, or is it just that they have no love for the beignets? Just using, abusing perhaps, them as a marketing tool. Dough can be temperamental and insolent if ignored or taken lightly, and when scorned all the sugar in the world will not make it delicious again.\n\nI think out this way you get soppapillas, but if you really, really want a beignet this ain't the place (The Farmer's Market in LA has a nice beignet.)", "author": "Roop D."}

Possibly, but they come off as nagging micro-management (\"hey kids, don't be a jerk and talk on your cell phone while eating\", \"here's a tip - throw your trash in the trash can, not on the floor\" - I made those up). Like they can't tolerate people very much so they have to create their own version of you. Hey man, it's cool.

I've never had clam chowder with a chile in it, but it added a surprisingly nice kick to it.\n\nThe service was alright; pretty laid back -- the girls that were working there the day I dined here didn't seem too friendly (they hardly ever smiled), but they did their job and my coffee/water was filled when needed.  Also, I don't know if it had anything to do with sitting by the window/door, but we had to occasionally swat away the flies that kept trying to steal our food, how dare they!\n\nOverall, pretty good place to have breakfast -- but really, their beignets... oh man!", "author": "Crys L."}

They have Anechoic foam blocks (the funny little pyramids) on the ceiling----but they need A LOT MORE given the noise level the flat, hard surfaces in this place generate.  Even the staff thinks so--although they might not say it to your face.\n\nI had the Crab Cake Po'Boy sandwich with a side of coleslaw and ice tea.  OK, I have my expectations; the crab cakes should taste mostly of crab, not filling; the roll should be good, but not too thick; the mayo should add something, perhaps by being really fresh or by having something a little spicy in it.  But the Crab cake tasked a bit too much of filling, the roll sort of detracted---and the mayo just didn't do it for me.  The coleslaw was very good (not too creamy); the ice tea smooth and not bitter, the Beignets were reason enough to come here---but the main act, the sandwich, just didn't soar.

I was tempted to order it, but since it was my birthday, I should try something different. I ordered the Eggs Benedict Special (instead of ham, it was roast beef) from the Specials of the Day.

I had 3 egg scrambled with chicken apple sausage, and it was so so.  Not something I'd wait for 20-30 min to get.  People seemed nice and service was very fast and prompt though.  Love their efficiency and beignets but not scrambled eggs too much.\n\nIf I'd go there again, maybe I'll try their French toast.  They looked pretty good.", "author": "Yoko S."}

I think it's a solid three-and-a-half. \n\nService can be painfully slow and ineffective, especially when they are crowded (which is often, it seems like. They are a pretty small place). That is my biggest beef with the place. There's often a wait, cause they are popular, and it seems like they have a hard time keeping up when they are busy. A party any bigger than 4 is not terribly feasible here although it can be done.\n\nOn the plus side, they have grits (\"that white pasty stuff you had in prison\"), a relative rarity in San Francisco. I like the beignets just fine, although they are rather like injecting a bolus of sugar and fat directly into your veins. Which, you know, sometimes is just what you want. But I digress. The menu and signage are entertaining, and the decor is something diverting to look at before you get your coffee and are fit for company. Overall the breakfast fare is quite good; I have to say that their Hollandaise sauce was way more like soup and rather disappointing, but everything else I've had has been nice.", "author": "Heather R."}

We wanted something close to the house (Potrero Hill) and good old trusty yelp sent us to Just for You Cafe.  \n\nWe got there around 8:15am and there was no line.  We got seated right away.  Those people who got there at 9am had quite a wait.  On the upside, they have hot coffee sitting out on the sidewalk (the waiting area) for anyone who might have been freezing in what this city jokingly calls 'summer.'  \n\nThe food was good.  I had the corn beef hash with poached eggs.  Kate's (in the lower haight) still is the best I've ever had, but this was far from bad.  The other food (omelets) went over really well, and the pancakes looked fabulous.  Refills were slow but the restaurant was packed.  The servers seemed a bit stressed and overwhelmed rather than forgetful.  They brought the check without asking if we wanted dessert so we had to correct that - this place has these...things.  I've never encountered them before, but yelp told me I had to order them.  I trusted in you, yelp.\n\nYelp was right.  These things - which the other reviews tell me are called beignets - are amazing.  They are some sort of puff pastry with powdered sugar melting on them.  Sort of like a donut, but not, sort of like cream puff crust, but not, sort of like...I don't know. Whatever they are, they are amazing.  They are the best hot.  They were pretty good left over too, but they were fantastic hot.  The more I type about them, the more I want to go over the hill and get more.  They are that good.  If you go here and don't try them then you are stupid.  Seriously.\n\nI will most definitely be back.  \n\nNotes of interest:\n \nThey don't let strollers in the restaurant.

A bottle of Miller for $2 served in a frosty mug was a nice start, the server was better than fantastic, and decided to try the Jambalaya with a Beignet side.  Jambalaya was not what I expected, but only because it was prepared differently.  Imagine a rice dish with meat and vege's almost like Chinese Fried Rice, but with a bit of Southern tang.  Very nice, very light (which of course is unusual for Jambalaya) and a nice selection of hot sauces to spice it up a bit.

And I've utterly failed at duplicating it in my own kitchen.  \n\nI love eggs, but I gave up on anything sounding like omelets or scrambled eggs on the menu at restaurants serving breakfast. The eggs usually come out crusty or spongy and sometimes both. I can't stands spongy eggs. One popular joint serves them stiff and in the shape of the omelet pan. Yuck. At most places, the eggs on the plate seem to have lost a fight with the watery vegetables mixed into the omelet. \n\nJust for You, on the other hand, has a way of cooking eggs that brings out a smoothness and a fluffiness in the eggs that is pretty darn wonderful. \n\nThinking about it makes me want to take the day-long trek to get there from the East Bay.

Pair that with fairly priced, consistent food, and it's easy to see why Just For You keeps people coming back for more.", "author": "Alex H."}

A cook in another restaurant gave me a card saying he worked in both places. The decor is nothing special but the breakfast menu with crab cakes, home made bread and beignets was a surprise. The staff was very gregarious and people from adjacent tables all conversed with us, complete strangers. It was warm and welcoming and I will certainly be back soon and often.", "author": "Ken B."}

They may not be extra-chatty, but I don't mind that.  I'd rather have my coffee constantly topped-off in silence than asked how I'm doing.  One time, all I had to do was look at the overhead fan (it was chilly inside) and without asking, they turned it off for me.\n\nThe food is consistently good and the portions more than enough.  And yes--the beignets are so-o-o good.  Try them with the jam.  And I don't know where else I can get grits.\n\nThe only reason why it doesn't get 5 stars is because there's nothing on the menu that I MUST have or crave.

So, that tells you something right away.  But, I cannot bring myself to give this place more than 3 stars.  If I could, I would give it a solid 3.5.\n\nTo Just For You's credit, this little Dogpatch cafe has style.  It is homey and cute.  It offers a plentiful selection, serving a number of unique dishes--wonderfully crisp beignets, oatmeal pancakes, unusual scramblers and omelettes.  Hell, the menu is even written in a cute way (with little jokes and comments beside the dishes).\n\nBut, let's face it.  Breakfast is the easiest meal to make and to make well.  So, if you are going to rack up points for breakfast with me, you have to really excel at making it.  Your menu must offer options that I could not make or would not try at home, kids.  And, Just For You falls short of this bar.\n\nIf you are feeling lazy, or just want some good, basic fare outside of your own kitchen, this place is great.  But, if you are looking for a \"knock your socks off\" breakfast in the city, seek it elsewhere.\n\nPs.  It's cash only.\nPps.  There may be a wait.", "author": "Margo C."}

Well, soon is now!  Tonight was their first night doing dinner on top of their always stellar breakfasts and lunches.  \n\nWe walked in to a fairly empty room (which is unusual and bound to be the last time) and were warmly greeted by the owner and staff.  This place always has a friendly vibe, but tonight there was a different more relaxed feel with candles on the tables and dimmed lights.  \n\nThe menu is pretty much the same as for lunch and breakfast, but with some dinner specials on front.  The pasta special was amazing with fresh grilled prawns and pesto cheese raviolis that were nice and light, not heavy feeling at all.  I only had a taste of these, but wished I had ordered that for myself.  I had the classic Cobb Salad which is always good there, so not too much to add to that.  \n\nOne of the great things about Just For You is the casual, but not flaky feel you get there.  It's also great that they will actually take a check if you don't have cash.  It's actually kinda refreshing that the do NOT take plastic.  \n\nSo, all in all, it's a great addition to the neighborhood that they are doing dinners now and keeping true to what they do best - good food at a reasonable price with a fun, friendly atmosphere.", "author": "Erik A."}

Came here with a friend after a long night of dancing with a hankering for some good brunch. She wanted to try this place based on the reviews on Yelp and yelpers haven't failed me yet so I was excited.\n\nWe got there and the line was friggin' long, which I can deal with if the food is good (Mama's!). So we wait and wait forever, and then with 3 people in front of us on the list, we duck into the convenience store next door to find some cold medicine for my friend because she was coming down with something. I swear we were gone for less than 5 minutes and when we came out her name was crossed off the list! We told the guy manning the waitlist what had happened, and he said he would work us back into the list. A few minutes later he comes out and we look at him eagerly and he says to us \"I'll get you guys next\". Then the next time he comes out to call names he COMPLETELY forgot about us! If you're going to seat us next, we appreciate it and will wait, but don't tell us you're going to seat us and then completely FORGET about us! If our best bet was to put our names back on the list, TELL US instead of having us wait around when you're never going to seat us. When I realized the guy completely forgot about us I put my name on the list and we were finally seated. I think in total we waited over an hour in line.\n\nWe ordered the beignets to share and I had the blue cheese scramble and my friend ordered the eggs benedict. First off, these were the WORST beignets I've had. I can't say that I'm an expert but these tasted bitter, like they were fried in oil that hadn't been changed in a very long time. They barely had any flavor and they were just greasy squares of dough with powered sugar heaped on top. The beignets at Angeline's in Berkeley are way better. Definitely not worth the calories.\n\nNext, my blue cheese scramble arrived and it looked straight up nasty, like barf. There were lots of vegetables and chunks of blue cheese and the serving was tiny - it didn't look like they used 3 eggs to make that scramble to me! The home fries were barely crispy and didn't have much flavor. I eyeballed my friend's benedict and it looked pretty rough around the edges as well. Her orange juice looked like it had been diluted with dishwater... or something. Both of our plates arrived at our table lukewarm. Unacceptable!\n\nLeft $35 poorer and grossed out.

As a Baton Rouge native and former New Orleans resident, I have noticed that the beignets can be somewhat off. Sometimes they are great and sometimes they are a bit yeasty.\n\nHowever, I have found a pattern to the problem and a simple reason behind it. Apparently, beignet quality is determined partly by ambient humidity. When it is raining or drizzling out, the beignets are excellent. If it's sunny, better to skip them. It's always humid in Louisiana so it's not a problem there.\n\nI would prefer if the beignets were served with a powdered sugar shaker, as they always are in Louisiana. Sometimes the sugar doesn't cover the top of the beignet and sometimes it's all over the plate but not all over the beignet. It's nearly impossible to get powdered sugar off the plate with a beignet. If it does not come from above it doesn't stick.\n\nOther food there is not humidity sensitive and some of it is pretty good. I don't find many places here that offer grits and sometimes grits really hit the spot. (And no, I have never been to prison.) Always grits with cheese, please. The crab cake omelet is tasty and I like the scramble with blue cheese and artichoke hearts.\n\nCheck the back of your grocery receipts for Just for You coupons.", "author": "Jen L."}

They do lots of breakfast food, burgers, sandwiches- basically everything you expect from a diner.  They also add to this some Mexican and Cajun influences.\n\nWhat wins me over is the quality of the ingredients and homemade nature of the food. 'They use sources for produce and meat and eggs that high end restaurants use, which is important for those of us who don't want to support feed lots or eat canned food. They do this pretty quietly without a lot of fanfare, and they've been doing it long before it was fashionable to know or care how a cow was raised. They also make most of their own bread.\n\nI'm giving them 5 stars because they know what they're about and do it well. I don't expect cappuccino in a diner. There is a straightforward honesty to the place, and if you're expecting some fancy, wacky twist on a diner, you won't find it. The staff is super nice and efficient but busy, and the owner is a friendly curmudgeon who sets the no-nonsense vibe of the place. She genuinely cares about the place and her customers and it shows.

Looking down from the 20th Street overpass, Dogpatch doesn't appear to be the most inviting of places, even in the daytime. Since the time I first moved here, though, its constant renovation has begun to yield some more welcoming buildings. The sparsely-warehoused area right around Just for You feels like it was created exclusively to be visited on Sunday mornings for walks in the park with your dog. It's almost enough to make me want to go out and GET a dog. But that's not really the point of the review, I guess. \n\nFirst, let me get the obligatory beignets mention out of the way. The beignets are great. Get some no matter what else you order. As a main breakfast dish, get the pancakes; their cornmeal or oatmeal pancakes are some of the best I've had. In my experience restaurant pancakes are usually either \"okay\" or \"terrible,\" so this makes them that much better.\n\nThe scrambles and the Mexican breakfast dishes are hit-or-miss. I've had them when they are pretty good and the flavors work very well together, and other times when they come out surprisingly bland. They're never awful, but the pancakes are a better deal and more reliable.\n\nEven if the food was terrible, though, I would probably still go here for the ambience. It is always busy, but they're careful with their limited seating, so it's never quite as cramped as you're afraid it will be. The ever-changing neon posters and amusingly caustic signs plastered over the walls should be too jarring for a relaxing breakfast, but it really defines the place's visual style. A thousand times better than the pallid beach-with-seagulls-and-reeds scenes you usually wind up with at breakfast-y restaurants.

Yes, she gets this dreamy (I refuse to use the term \"orgasmic\" and \"my mother\" in the same sentence) drawn out voice when talking about this place. I was looking for brunch places to take my folks on their recent visit, and this place is just down the road from me, and I thought, why not? The folks are always wanting to go to the \"real San Francisco places\" and it's hard not to get more real than the Dogpatch. So glad we did. We went around 9am during the week, so parking wasn't too bad - but I would guess that weekend brunch might be a parking headache. But we got seated right away and literally drooled for the next 15 minutes over the menu. My dad got the chorizo scramble, my mom got 2 eggs with apple turkey sausage and the (infamous, for my mom anyway) blueberry scone, and I got Greg's scramble with chorizo. The chorizo was on the mild side, but no complaints with the eggs - nice and fluffy. The Greg's scramble was a nice mixture of stuff along with the chorizo but I probably could have done without the parmesan on top. But that's probably my fault in thinking parmesan and chorizo would go well together. The place itself is nice and homey feeling, the coffee was excellent.\n\nOh, and the beignets.... well, let's just not get started on what they did to my mother.

I'm just sad that Just For You is \"average\" now.  Years ago, on Potrero Hill, it was exceptional.  I'm not sure what happened, but it's saddening.  You'll note from my other reviews that I very rarely write negative reviews, I am usually a \"if you've got nothing good to say, say nothing at all\" kind of girl.  But watching a SF institution slide is too painful...\n\nOK.  Here we go.  The primary problem seems to be related to the microwave.  If we could steal the microwave, maybe we could bring Just For You back to life.  On my final visit, I ordered 4 things, hoping each time to find something I could eat.  Breakfast Burrito- rubbery, overcooked, dry eggs wrapped in a flour tortilla and microwaved into oblivion.  Only the green chile sauce made a bite go down.  Next, tried the biscuits and gravy.  As a southerner and lover of biscuits, I know that it is a capital offense to microwave a biscuit.. but there it went, into the microwave, and out it came like a molten rubber hockey puck.  Covered with gelatinous cold goo.  So, I tried a scone.  Sadly, microwaved until I could bend it in half without breaking it.  At this point, desperate, I went for beignets.  Finally!  Yummy beignets.  Fresh, soft, fluffy, good.  No microwave in sight for those, at least not this time.  Which is probably why they took 20 minutes, but so be it.  \n\nThat was it, the last visit to Just For You after 10 years of slow decline.  It's just such a shame that a cute place, with an interesting and funny menu, a SF standy has gone so low.

I work in the Potrero Hill area and often call in take out orders from this place.  They must only cater to sit down patrons because every take out order I have gotten is horrible!!!  When you order take out, you trust that everything will be right and you don't need to check inside the bag for the necessary condiments and order specifics.  Moldy toast twice!!!, no cheese on eggs after paying extra for it, no butter in the bag for two huge pieces of toast, no syrup in the bag with pancakes, fries when I ordered salad,..  I mean,  who needs five thousand salt and pepper packets and a months supply of ketchup packets when all you ordered was french toast and fruit salad???  Anytime I mention the problem, the owner/manager is more than willing to comp my next meal but that's not the point.  A comp'd meal just doesn't suffice when you get back to your desk and open your food container with joy and anticipation to find that you have to eat bone dry toast with your sausage and fried egg breakfast when you really ordered bacon and scrambled cheese eggs...  Do you really want to pack your food back up, get back in the car and drive back just hear \"oh, so sorry, let me comp that for you and have you wait another 10 minutes while we get your order right\"....

Eating there is like having a home-cooked meal, but not at home. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere cozy and eclectic. As for the food, practically everything is made fresh; from the bread they bake everyday to the freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. Seeking something sweet, try their beignets perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, dusted with powdered sugar. Try any one of their daily specials or stick to your breakfast favorites of eggs, choice meats and fresh home fries potatoes. Seeking the healthy stuff, get a big helping of yogurt, granola and fruit for all for about ten dollars. They also have lunch items, and up until about a month ago are now open for dinner. So check these guys out, you will not be sorry!", "author": "Cynthia G."}

With so many brunch places in the city, I wondered how this diner was surviving. \n\nDriving up to the eatery, my first impression was that this place was a hipster hangout. A line of \"just rolled out of bed, i don't give a shit but I somewhat do with these Ray Bans, skinnys and flannel scarf\" patrons were waiting in line to get their breakfast on. Stepping into the diner however, I noticed how the cozy tones and funky posters combined with the aromas of powdered sugar and cinnamon made this spot instantaneously amicable. I ordered a Beignet to share with a friend. It was huge, warm, fluffy and extremely delicious. I could of eaten two of these, drank my coffee and been in state of complete bliss. I did however, want to try more items. I went with a grilled catfish fillet, scrambled eggs, grits and cornbread combo. Talk about a lot of food!  I liked that the catfish was prepared grilled instead of fried. My love hate relationship with carbs also fully appreciated and then fretted over the extensive bread options (cornbread, cinnamon raisin, scone, english muffin, toast, wheat) and choice of grits or homefries (I chose grits). The bread here is homemade. The quality of the classic diner fare was not sacrificed with quantity. Prices are also very reasonable with most menu items under $10. This place beats Serpentine (aka what's up with the communal table between two restrooms) across the street in my book. \n\nOne or two cons about this place: Coffee contributes extensively to my ability to enjoy breakfast. I wish they served better coffee here. Also, this place takes only cash or check. A friend was visiting me from NYC....you can figure out the rest. Anyway, these aren't reasons enough to deter continuous visits. I'll be back for the creole crab cakes, the bread and the beignets. Loving it.", "author": "Annie Y."}

A man & woman were seated together at a table near the window.  I was immediately struck by the size of her biscuits.  \"My what big, beautiful biscuits you have,\" thought I.  Anyone who has ever brunched with me (or had fried chicken with me) knows that I love me some biscuits.  \n\nMy bf & I were seated at the counter with a bird's eye view into the kitchen.  When it came time to order I, of course, ordered biscuits with my eggs.  While we waited for our food we were able to watch the parade of other people's orders coming from the kitchen.  Of course, I was not the only one who had developed biscuit envy that morning.  However, I was horrified to see the kitchen staff warming up biscuits in the microwave.  \"No no no!\" I wanted to scream.  Had they not learned at a young age, as I did, that breads get mushy & soggy in a microwave.  Did they not know that mushy & soggy are not complementary adjectives when it comes to a biscuit?  Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed when my artificially warmed biscuits arrived.  Even with generous amounts of butter they were relatively tasteless.  My eggs were super yummy though.  I did not care for what they call hash browns.  They are basically just a bunch of cut up chunks of red potatoes.  \n\nWhat I did love love love were the buckwheat pancakes.  I had not had buckwheat pancakes in years.  And, theirs did not disappoint.\n\nI will definitely be back.  This place is too close to my house to not want it to be really good.", "author": "Jeff P."}

After waiting not too long, about ten minutes, a table of four left and we waited and watched through the glass windows as the servers went by and ignored the table which needed to be bussed.  We decided to give them a hint by going inside, as it was windy a bit, and sitting at the table.  Another ten minutes go by and the same servers that asked us earlier if we needed a spot, walked around us several times, so finally my husband gets up and goes the the cash register and asks if someone could clean the table off for us....a couple minutes later a male server asks us if we are done, we told him we hadn't even gotten started and that we had been waiting for a table and needed this one wiped down and the empty glasses and bill removed...he then tells us \"Well can you move then so I can clean the table and there are people waiting outside for tables and we need this, so you will need to move\"....well there were no people waiting a head of us for a table and we told him this and he again insisted we move so he could wipe the table off....not usually a big deal, but he had a serious attitude with us even though we had been nothing but patient and respectful....I felt as though he didn't want us to be there, so we said ok we'll leave and did just that....we were completely put off by this one servers attitude...we also noticed that for such a small place they had more than 3 servers and they were very slow to do anything.

She then, rather rudely, told us that we could sit in the other table that was ready.  Because of her attitude, we did not feel welcome in that restaurant anymore so we decided to quietly leave.  As if her prior rudeness was not enough, she could not resist continuing to provoke us by commenting on our decision to leave.

The place was a little bigger than I thought with a few tables in the back.  Lots of choices on the menu and nice wait staff.  They make sure your coffee cup is never empty.  I got the Cowboy (french toast, eggs, and bacon) and hubby got Greg's scramble with chorizo.  The portions were good and satisfying.

Anyhoo, Just For You has the BEST biscuits!  And they do have good coffee of their own.  I usually get their greek omelet which is really tasty.

Our party of three had a slight wait, and we're engaged in conversation too much to take advantage of the free coffee while you wait, but I did notice others partaking.  the seating was a little cramped, but the coffee and water came promptly.  After getting a few chuckles out of their irreverent menu, I ordered the Crab Benny.  We called the waiter back to order the beignets after last-minte deliberation.  like others have said, fried dough and sugar, can't really mess that up too bad.  I thought the crabcakes had too much vinegar, there was definitely something that wasnt' right about them, the grits were decent, but I'm a northern boy, so I don't speak from any experience.  My compantion thought the cornbread good enough to box up after only being able to devour half of it, aparently her egg scramble was better than my benny.  I'd be willing to check this place out again, but maybe when i'm in a lazier mood, and there isn't a parade of half-naked brazilians luring me out the door.  cash only", "author": "shawn g."}

Our first stop was lots of fun and a must stop when in the city (dog patch area) for breakfast or brunch. We arrived early on our second visit so no wait to find a two top. Expect a wait on popular breakfast times and days. Our visit was good however the presentation was off compared to our first visit. Hang town Fry was good however portion appeared to be smaller than our first visit. The egg scramble was adequate heavy on the parma cheese. Corn bread was excellent and side potatoes were very good.I would try the pancakes on our next visit and a different egg dish. Down the block from Just For you is a small coffee spot serving \"Blue Bottle\" coffee which I had on my first visit waiting for a seat at Just for You. When I had my second cup at Just For You the coffee was not near the quality and taste of my cup of Blue Bottle. I may have not noticed the difference had I not just finished my cup of Blue Bottle. Just For You Cafe is still a must visit for breakfast or brunch when we are in the area.", "author": "Gerry C."}

Not sure if that's true, but it sure feels like it when I'm there for the medicine that cures what ails me.  Ok, it's definitely greasy spoon, but good.  Have never had a bad food experience.  Everything is really good - and for the dishes, they are all perfectly executed.  Great salads, omelets, frittatas, smokin french toast and beignets.  Pretty good staff everytime I have been there - ok it might not be one of those \"it's all about the service\" places, but I know that walking in AND I have never had anyone do less than a great job as our server.  And I have been tons of times, so I would think I have had the chance to be disappointed, but I haven't.  If I wasn't watching my girlish figure, oh boy you would see me there a little more often.  Of course, if you have never been, get there early because there's always an insane wait, but it is worth it.  And if you are there early enough to have the fresh pot of coffee (before they run out of the cream, that is) outside while you wait for a table, even better.  I am so happy this place is in my hood.  Oh, I think this place is only open on weekends.  I could be wrong but I have never checked weekday.", "author": "Isa L."}

The atmosphere is friendly and the food is excellent from their breakfast to lunch menus.  Try their made to order breakfast burritos or corn cakes for breakfast & try their fish tacos or Croque Misseur Sandwich(basically a grilled cheese with gruyere) for lunch.  If you like cole slaw, it's \"top of the line\" here.  Lots of burgers and creative hot menu items as well as a bevy of salads for light eaters.  You don't see this stuff at the typical \"choke & puke\" diners.  An all day breakfast/lunch menu also makes for great choices & satisfying portions.  The wait staff is courteous and attentive and will fix anything that isn't quite right - no questions asked.  JFY is a small place with a six seat bar.  With mostly inside seating and a few outside tables, it can get a little crowded but it's ususally a fun atmosphere & not too terribly noisy.  A bit of low-volume, pumped-in  trip-hop helps to soften the kitchen noises.  Nice place to chill & fill.", "author": "Tim F."}

But this weekend, a friend suggested it and away we went. It's every bit as cute inside as it looks on the outside. Unfortunately, tables for 3 seem to be hard to come by as group after group of twosomes behind us kept getting seated while we cooled our heels outside. Finally we got a table in Siberia - the last table on a banquette waaay at the back. Got coffee service right away, but didn't see our waitress again for another 20 minutes. When she finally came back, we asked for her opinion on some items on the menu, which she couldn't give because - get this - she is allergic to wheat and can't eat 99.9% of the items offered. I went for the Cowboy (2 eggs, French toast, and sausage/bacon). I was very excited to see that they offered a Filipino sausage called longanisa (yum!) which they allowed me to substitute for the Cowboy sausage. Overall, the food was great. I really wanted to save room for the beignets that I heard so much about, but my serving was huge and those longanisa were sooo good.

It could be because Im just a looser and nobody wants to eat with me.  Or the fact that Im a chef and find myself crtiqueing everything that I eat.  I even look at the walls wondering why they had choosen that decor to enlighten the experience.  We don't sell food in this business we sell an experience.  How many places have you gone to that have great food but shitty service and your just not willing to return?  I know I've been to plenty.  Maybe people aren't into the idea that Im gonna either dog everything or take for ever eating it as I savor every bite.  I've heard about Just for you a lot.  I live maybe 1/4 of a mile from it in the \"Dog Patch\"  its so close I should have been there more often.  I will say however my breakfast experience wasn't the greatest.  I had this incredible urge to eat eggs benedict as soon as I awoke.  With my half closed eyes I wasn't interested in whiping out any holandaise. So I opted to take my walk down the street to see if they had the item I needed to satisfy my hunger.  I was a little disappointed at getting holandaise from the dry variety.  Basically you boil water and whip in the dry mix until Nappe.  It was also served on toast instead of an english muffin.  THe flavor was alright but certainly not what I was hoping for.  The waitress is cute, though so I suppose they get some extra credit for it.  I geuss in all honesty this is what I expected.  Nothing real special about it but a good place to eat being in my neighborhood.  I wouldn't travel across the city to eat here but I will probably eat here again.", "author": "Pat W."}
