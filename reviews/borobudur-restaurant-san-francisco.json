{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-06-18", "description": "In short  very, very unprofessional, bad service, food was dry and barely warm, overpriced.\nThe long version: .I think it's safe to say that this was by far my worst restaurant experience ever ... and I'm in my 50s and have lived at and traveled to many places. I went to Borobudur with my husband and our two teenagers. When we arrived, the place wasn't very busy but it took a while to take our orders. We hadn't been asked for drinks until we ordered our food. And while we ordered, a young woman (I really can't call her a waitress) managed to bring us 4 glasses with water (we had ordered sodas) without a tray, which was almost artistic and would be the only thing that impressed me during this evening. \nAbout 20 minutes later we still didn't have our drinks, the place started to fill up and we realized that the young man and young woman were the only staff. While she had no idea what to do, filling and delivering glasses with water was the only thing she had under controle. He was seating guests, taking plenty of phone orders, took orders at the tables and it was obvios that he was sort of lost in a choas. We reminded him of our drinks and finally the woman dropped off glasses and the sodas ... in cans. After a very long wait, we then got the crab chips that we had asked for - very disappointing they were not fresh but from a bag - and the food for our daughter. Our food was nowhere to be seen and they didn't tell us anThing about when we might get it. After a while our daughter started eating. 5 minutes later she got a huge bowl of rice. Still no word about our food. Our daughter lost her apetite because she didn't like to be the only one with food. 20 minutes later our food made it to the tiny desk where the two tried to figure out what it is and where it has to go. \nWe finally got our food and my husband asked for new rice since the rice bowl was already cold but we only got the little coconut rice that I had ordered for me. I had also ordered the honey beef which came with a flower but without any sauce. The meat had the size of my palm (see picture) but I had no knife and had to pull it appart with a fork and spoon. It was so dry and chewy that I realky asked my husband if he still knows the Heimlich maneuver ... just in case. The rest of the family wasn't too impressed if their food either, especially since it was barely warm. Not once did they ask us if everything was ok or if we need more drinks. They didn't even look at our table nore did they talk to us when they brought ou food. This behaviour made it impossible to ask for the check - we would have had to yell through the room or jump up and down at our table to maybe get their attention. So after trying and waiting for a long time again, we felt the only way out was to get up and go to the desk to pay there. We ended up paying almost $90 for food that came barely warm ond absolutely uncoordinated, and that we eventually barely touched because we've lost our apetite over the bad service. We came in with \" The menue looks great, we might come here more often\" and we left with \"never again\".", "author": "Barb S."}

It seemed to be a genuine Indonesian restaurant and as you don't see too many Indonesian restaurants around I decided to give it a try even though it did not have very high ratings on Yelp. I generally get Nasi Bungkus at any new Indonesian restaurant that I try as that allows you to get a pretty good understanding of how the food is compared to others. Unfortunately Borobudur did not have Nasi Bungkus on the menu so I decided to get another rice based dish called Nasi Uduk Lenkap ($12.95) to-go using the online ordering app on Yelp.\n\nAfter ordering, I landed up after about 20 minutes to find the restaurant half full with one large party waiting for a table. The servers and hostess were busy running around, taking orders and busing tables so I walked over to the counter to see if my order was ready. Well it was ready so I was literally handed a to-go container. No bag, no silverware nothing just a box and I was to be on my way. Just as I was about to leave some other lady stepped in took the box from my hand and put it in a bag and provided silverware. It's nice that she did this else I would have been very upset. They had charged me 25c for the SF bag fee, which is just wrong. SF bag fee is only 10c and that too if they are providing a thick plastic bag.\n\nAnyway, let's come to the food. As per the menu Nasi Uduk Lenkap consists of rice cooked in coconut milk, served with honey beef, fried chicken, spicy tofu, scrambled egg and shrimp crackers. What I got definitely covered all ingredients. It was neatly packaged which showed the chefs pride in what was being served along with care for the customer. Taste wise everything was fresh including the spicy beef (I've always found the beef to be stale in Indonesian restaurants that I've been too). The fried chicken could have been a little crispier and all the flavors were a little mild for my taste. I haven't been to many Indonesian restaurants and a couple of trips \"back home\" were a long time ago, so I can't definitively say how the flavors should be, but you would have to concentrate hard to pick up the different tastes in this dish. Overall it was not terrific, but still pretty good.\n \nPrice wise it is cheaper than what you would pay for a small pizza in (S)Nob hill. I liked with what I got, so I'll be back to try the beef rending and other rice dishes off their menu in due course. Generous 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 is how I'd rate this place.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

The flavor is very strong if you aren't used to it, but I thought it kept it from being too boring and bland.\n\nWhile the food was certainly good, the service was bad. \n- 10 minutes after we ordered, our server came back to our table to re-take our order because he lost our slip. \n- Our table didn't have any napkins, so I had to ask.

The Tofu was boiling hot inside (no kidding, fried indeed) and otherwise cut into perfect cubes and served with a leaf of lettuce.

There were bones everywhere in the chicken, which made it mildly cumbersome to eat (not aided by the fact that I was not given a knife), and the BBQ marinade was kind of uninteresting. The coconut milk sauce was more thin than one would expect from this kind of dish.

I tried the veggie rice plate and roti prata. My dinner companion had martabak sapi and some sort of seafood medley in spicy sauce. \n\nNone of the food was inherently bad, so why the three stars, you ask? It was the timing--it's in need of improvement. \n\nThe martabak sapi was brought out first. It was the veggie option, so it was filled with bits of broccoli, carrots, egg, etc. with a small side of mixed pickle--good. Not ultra flavorful, but you can't go wrong with anything coated in egg roll wrappers and fried.\n\nThe roti prata showed up about ten minutes afterward. This was the stand-out of the entire meal. Marvelous! Crisp, flaky, golden, piping hot, perfectly tender and chewy at the center, and the curry dipping sauce added a complementary kick. It was a large enough portion to share. If you try nothing else at Borobudur, try this.\n\nI'd scarcely started on my appetizer when my entree arrived. My friend's did not, which made eating mine rather awkward. His dish took about 10 minutes more to show up, but he said it was excellent. The sauce was mad spicy--a chili pepper and tomato base.\n\nThe rice plate consisted of: spicy tofu, coconut curry, seasoned tempe, two tiny corn fritters, and, of course, a small, temple-shaped mound of rice. The spicy tofu and tempe were my favorites; both were seasoned well and the tempe had a much more appetizing texture than the stuff sold at natural foods stores. The coconut curry was lacking heat and the veggies could have used a few more minutes in the pot; they were a bit toothsome for my taste. I suspect the corn fritters would have been better had they been fresher; they were room temperature and gummy rather than crispy. In fact, none of the food on my plate was actually hot, an indication that it may have been left sitting about for some time before reaching the table. \n\nService was friendly. I just wish they'd been more consistent. The checks also took a while to show up and water glasses weren't filled as often as they could have been.\n\nPrices weren't outrageous, but I discovered they are $1-$2 higher than the ones listed on their website.\n\nI don't regret the meal--it was wonderful to try something new--but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.

Yes, the Rendang is the dish to get at this establishment!\n\nWe came before a show at The Masonic and made reservations for 6:30 though I don't think that was necessary. Hard to tell what it would be like on a weeknight but we came on a Saturday. Good to know they take reservations, though.\n\nSince the Rendang doesn't come with veg, we ordered one vegetarian dish and the Rendang to share and get a good balance. The veggie dish was the Capcai. If you are looking for something plain but a little salty - go for it. I wasn't impressed but was glad to get some vegetables into my dinner. And there were plenty! Cabbage, carrots, bell pepper, cauliflower, green beans, broccoli. I am sure I am forgetting something but there was no shortage of quantity or variety here. If I come back, I will probably try the Kari Sayuran instead.\n\nWe got one order of the coconut lemon grass rice which was a little dry but still pretty good. It didn't have a strong coconut flavor (they probably cut it with water) but the lemongrass was a nice compliment to the dishes we ordered. \n\nWe spent about $30 altogether (not including tip) so it is definitely affordable.\n\nI would agree with some of the other reviews that said the interior is not the cleanest, windows are dirty, floors are a bit grimey. And they only had one server for the entire restaurant so don't expect great service. They have a very interesting way of bringing the food out. They do everything by hand, writing out the orders, then as the items are ready, they check the ticket, take it to the right table, and check it off the order list. Because of this, we got our veggie item first, then the Rendang about 10 minutes later.

When I got back home, I found Borobudur.  \n\nMy friend and I arrived at about 6:30pm (no reservation) and were seated immediately.  We ordered the Rijstaffel (Rice Table) and waited patiently for the dishes to start coming.  The first were lumpia with a spicy peanut sauce, and lemongrass chicken soup.  My friend, who has never had Indonesian food before, gave two thumbs up and said he couldn't wait for the rest of the food to arrive. \n\nAll-in-all, everything was delicious.  Although they use the word \"spicy\" on a few descriptions, it really wasn't that hot at all - it had a good kick, but nothing crazy hot.  There was plenty of food left over for a nice doggie bag.  This is a great place and I will gladly return.  Conveniently enough it's only about 5 blocks from my job.    \n\nThe staff couldn't have been more lovely.  Every time they came to the table they had smiles on their faces, and were very polite.  They slowly described each dish and politely answered our questions.\n\nI've read others' comments about the servers being rude.  I didn't find that at all, but then again, I work in the hospitality industry and understand what it takes to run a restaurant.  It is hands down THE most difficult industry in which to work.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-02", "description": "Borobudur is an Indonesian restaurant serving up a storm. Most of their dishes are intense and robust exuding vibrant and zesty flavors. Their diverse menu is designed for those who love Indonesia's natural abundance of exotic spices, peanuts, coconuts, (to name a few). Some of their distinctive dishes would surely tease and tantalize while others were not as glorious. There were minor to major hiccups all along the way.\n\nDining solo, I was recommended Rijsttafel ($29.50), a complete Indon rice table where one can sample a wide variety of small courses. I wasn't particularly thrilled with the first course, Lumpia Semarang (Indon Spring Roll). It had some nondescript fillings and a side of watered-down peanut sauce. (1/5) After the dismal start, they redeemed themselves almost instantly with a cup of Soto Ayam, a smooth lemon grass soup with chicken. It started off with a subtle blandness and the soup gradually blossomed into an interesting medley of flavors ranging from sweet and sour to fragrant.  Tip: To upgrade the taste, Borobudur sprinkled some deep-fried onions on the soup and it worked wonders! Try doing this at home! (5/5)\n\nThe rest were served together and attractively presented in a huge platter.\n \n1. The first course was Gado Gado, an Indon salad tossed with peanut dressing and topped with shrimp crackers.  The dressing was light, tangy and refreshing, a vast improvement over the spring roll's sauce. (4/5)\n2. Sate Ayam (grilled marinated chicken on skewers with peanut sauce) required high heat and good grilling skills. The aroma can then be smelled from blocks away! Problem with Borobudur's sate was it lacked aroma even when I placed it under my nose! There was no charring (sigh); the meat was dried out and the chewy texture felt like calamari. Not impressed! (2/5)\n3. Now kudos to the cook for not drying out my chicken in the Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak described as BBQ marinated chicken cooked with spicy coconut milk sauce. Firstly, I love the richness and aroma of coconut milk. Secondly, it restored my faith in chicken as if it can be cooked right, it need not be dry! (4/5)\n4. Kari phonetically sounds like curry and so Kari Udang is simply shrimp curry (\"udang\" means shrimps in Indon).  In true Indon style, the curry was simmered in coconut milk and cooked in some secret curry powder or paste. It was hard to believe how the natural sweetness of fresh shrimps blended so tastily with coconut milk and excellent over rice. (4/5)\n5. Oseng Oseng Tahu Tempe described as \"Saut\u00e9ed Java soy bean and tofu\" was foreign to me. Tempe is a traditional soy product originating from Indon and I am sure available in heath food stores. I figured this must be an acquired taste though not inedible but just not my favorite. (2/5)\n6. Beef Rendang is for sure the tastiest and most iconic Indon dish!  The symphony of tastes was incredible. Without knowing the recipe, my guess the ingredients were sugar, coconut cloves, cinnamon sticks and of course coconut milk that were slow boiled and simmered until the meat was aromatic and amazingly tender. This luscious Indon beef stew was perfect with rice. (5/5)\n\nEverything considered, if you really enjoy the taste of peanuts and coconut milk, I do recommend you give Borobudur a try keeping one eye closed to some inconsistencies in the peanut sauce. I did notice the d\u00e9cor wasn't overbearing but instead quite fascinating and intriguing with traditional woodcarvings hung on the wall with other Indon knickknacks and kitschy artifacts.

I decided to call in my order so that I could take it home and veg out with my favorite reality trash tv. Anyhow, I digress. The guy that picked up the phone to take my order appeared to be in a rush. I tried explaining my order to him, asking questions about things (as this was my first try at Indonesian) and he responded with \"are you almost ready, because I've got errands to run\". Whoa, dude. Slow your roll. Your restaurant just opened at 1pm, so cool it with the icy customer service. I tried to chock it up to the place being super busy, and tried not to think too much else about it. \n\nBased on previous reviews and a quick purview of the menu, I settled with the Roti Prata (Indonesian version of naan) and the Kari Udang (shrimp curry dish). The icy dude told me it would be 25 minutes to make. Twenty-five minutes later, I headed a block up the street to the restaurant. The restaurant is off Post street and pretty centrally located, being on a Muni line and about 5-6 blocks (more or less) from BART. As soon I came into the restaurant, I couldn't help but chuckle. There wasn't a soul in that place. Not even someone at the cashiers. Hotmess indeed.\nThe cashier appeared to be pretty nice, which made up for the first dude. Solid B for customer service.\n\nOverall, the Kari Udang was just okay. I was actually expecting a bit more flavor. But the Roti Prata?!? Oh em gee. Best thing ever!!! The outside is slightly crisp and the inside is nice and doughy. And the curry sauce on the side...absolute deliciousness!!! I would go back to this place just for that bread. And it would totally be worth it.\n\nHighly recommend that my vegetarian brethren check to see if something has beef or chicken broth. Some things on the menu are listed as vegetables or beef, but when I went to place my order, the icy dude didn't give me the option for either/or.

Rendang was good but to me it tasted dead on like Filipino beef mechado but the Rending was more tender than mechado but lacking accompanying vegetables.  In that regard, I felt a little ripped off because it was missing something for my Filipino ass but again the flavor was there and texture was good.  The Roti Prata texture was crispy on the exterior and very much like a croissant on the inside.

The lemongrass soup had nice subtle flavors, but the best dish of the night was the beef rendang which had very tender and flavorful meat. The spicy noodle dish, mie tek tek goreng (stir fried noodles with egg and vegetables) with chicken was good but left us wanting more veggies.\n\nOn our second visit we sprang for the $27.50 Rijsttafel, a 9 course meal. Despite what they told us it was DEFINITELY enough to feed two people. The dishes were hit or miss. The best included the lemongrass soup (yet again), the lumpia, the shrimp curry, the barbecue chicken, the beef rendang, and the black sweet rice with coconut milk dessert. Not that there's anything wrong with a good vanilla (the other dessert choice) but at an ethnic restaurant you go with the exotic.\n\nThen there were the clunkers. Those included the bland bean cake, the noodles and cabbage with gloppy peanut sauce also known as the gado-gado salad (however, the accompanying shrimp chips were good), and the satay, the texture of which was off-putting.

Okay, get your mind out of the gutter.\nHaving never tried Indonesian food, I was invited by friends to dine here on a Monday evening.  Coming before 6 pm for an early dinner, street parking was plentiful on Post Street.  It is only a few blocks from one of my favorite downtown lunch spot too and a good option for pre-theater meals.  Here's what my gracious hosts ordered:\n\nAppetizers\n 1) Tempe Goreng (fried soy bean cake) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=LwQKt_v47NtrhUOR6mpndw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Drier that Chinese style fried tofu, this is more dense and interesting with the dipping sauce.\n\n2) Empek Empek Palembang (Fried fish cake filled with egg in spicy vinegar) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=1RNYxo-5nPJZb0O25cEFvw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Nice flavor contrast and textures; wish the egg was more runny, but this is done traditional style.  Favorite of the three apps.\n\n3) Gado-gado (Steamed vegetables, tofu, potato, egg, & shrimp cracker with peanut dressing) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/borobudur-restaurant-san-francisco?select=5okBb0nmsZyG2bOedQCmIA#5okBb0nmsZyG2bOedQCmIA) - Plethora of textures and flavors.\n\nMain\n 4) Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak (B.B.Q. marinated chicken cooked with coconut milk) - Chicken (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/borobudur-restaurant-san-francisco?select=k_XrDaXKXEEzwcuQwLnejA#k_XrDaXKXEEzwcuQwLnejA) - Looks more like a curry preparation so the seasonings are unexpected; meat was tender.\n\n5) Empal Goreng (Fried marinated honey beef) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/borobudur-restaurant-san-francisco?select=tWM2je4Z7IOuWGzh97mh3w#tWM2je4Z7IOuWGzh97mh3w) - Like the soy bean cake, this is dryer and comparable to beef jerky.\n\n6) Tumis Kangkung Bawang Putih (Sauteed water spinach with garlic) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q)  - Seasonal, this is my favorite Asian vegetable, cooked and seasoned just right.\n\n7)  Ikan Bakar Sumudra / Trout fish (Grilled fish with tropical spices) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Flaky and tasty, reminds me of smoked fish.\n\nDesserts\n 8) Bubur Ketan Hitam - Black sweet rice - Least favorite of the three desserts as very filling.\n\n9) Es Cendol (Rice flour cake with ice & palm sugar syrup) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/borobudur-restaurant-san-francisco?select=_c9VJLJZ5chJ0ar_l2IEjw#_c9VJLJZ5chJ0ar_l2IEjw) - Think of an icy Thai iced tea with grass jelly and gelatinous textured accompaniments.\n\n10) Es Campur (Mixed tropical fruits with shave ice, condensed milk, chocolate & raspberry syrup) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Shave ice - My favorite of the three desserts, the chocolate and raspberry flavors are unexpected.\n\nBeing my maiden voyage in Indonesian cuisine, the variety highlighted this roller coaster of a meal as many of the foods did not taste like they \"looked\".  My gracious host, being born in Indonesia, kindly gave me a taste of local authentic foods from his home country.  Unlike Cantonese cuisine where most local restaurants predominantly use soy sauce or oyster sauce, the flavor profile adds the sour and sweet elements and different textures in unexpected ways.  If you are adventurous and not afraid to try something new, you will likely enjoy this, but make sure you bring someone in the know to guide you.

We had the martabak sapi with beef, beef rendang, the nasi goreng, the spicy green bean with shrimp paste, and the bihun goreng. Can you say flavor explosion? It was amazing, I have never had flavors and food like this before. Indonesian food is truly unique and very flavorful, it's one of my favorite cuisines after trying this restaurant. The service was also very good, our water glasses were never empty and the staff was all very welcoming and kind. The martabak sapi was a great starter: crispy dough and flavorful beef. Next we had the rendang; which is a personal favorite. The beef is slow simmered in coconut milk and spices and it just melts in your mouth. It's a must try if you're going here. The nasi goreng was very good, I always love fried rice done right. The green beans were very flavorful and a good addition to our meal. They were very addicting and I couldn't stop eating them.

The Siomay Ayam, which was basically a pan fried chicken dumpling with a mildly spicy peanut sauce was easily the highlight of the sampled dishes.  I hate to say it, but I was completely disappointed with everything else.  \n\nThe other Siomay was coated in the peanut sauce, so I could not get any type of flavor from the ingredients.

Despite the colonial overtones of the name, the food very distinctly Southeast Asian in nature.\n\nI came here for lunch with a good friend while attending a conference nearby.  She had never heard of this type of cuisine (indeed, I suspect that it's probably unknown to a lot of people) and was intrigued to give it a try.  When we arrived there was only one other table occupied, even though it was the lunch hour of a regular business day.\n\nThe rijsttafel menu was varied both in food and quality.  It wasn't quite as extensive as what I recall from the Netherlands, where we seemed to have about twice as many dishes but in smaller quantities.  Nevertheless, it was a still an excellent sampling of Indonesian dishes.\n\nLumpia appetizer - crisp and hot, delicious but not particularly distinctive.\nSoto ayam - lemongrass soup.  I usually can't stand lemongrass because I think most places overdo it, but this was well done.\nGado gado salad - nice flavor, vegetables perhaps a little overcooked and soft, but still enjoyable.\nSatay ayam - standard chicken skewer, similar to what you find in the dime-a-dozen Thai restaurants.\nKari Udang - really excellent shrimp/curry dish; subtle flavors and aromas.\nAyam Panggang Bumbu Rujak - chicken in coconut milk sauce, very tasty.\nRendang - beef stew-like dish.  The waitress said that it was one of the most popular dishes, but I found it to be the least appealing.  Beef texture was a bit off, perhaps from being a little overcooked.\nOseng Oseng Tahu Tempe - my favorite dish by far.  Tofu-based dish with great flavors and texture and just the right amount of spiciness.\nBlack sweet rice in coconut milk dessert - very good.  Served warm, cleans the palate very nicely.\n\nWe also ordered the roti prata that others have raved about.  It's not on the rijsttafel menu, so that came at a small extra cost.  Pretty good, but not as overwhelming as I had expected it to be.  Perhaps I built up my expectations too much.\n\nThe price of our meal, including the extra roti, nonalcoholic beverage, and tip was less that $40 per person.  Though perhaps a little more than most would like to spend on lunch, for us it was well worth the cost for a unique dining experience.\n\nOne quibble: service was really, really slow.  Good thing we had two hours for lunch otherwise we would have felt rushed at the end.  The waitress, however, was very attentive and answered all our questions.  She was also almost irresistibly beautiful.", "author": "Lee L."}

I was a little surprised this dish wasn't more \"saucy\". We ordered a bowl of rice with it, but it wasn't very necessary. There wasn't enough sauce for a bowl of rice. The sauce itself was good though.\n\n#61 Nasi Goreng with Chicken and Shrimp - $10.50 - This dish was severely lacking in flavour. It was bland despite having stuff in it.

We ordered the Rendang Beef, which was sort of like a curry, but with a different flavor profile (more allspicey, very earthy).  Notably, the beef was cut into these ginormous cubes so I initially thought they were bone-in, but they were all meat and incredibly tender.  Secondly, we ordered the Cumi Pedas Selera, a spicy battered squid dish.  I was initially concerned about the spice level of this dish, but our server was like, \"It's not that spicy\" so we went ahead and ordered it.  I don't know what she was talking about because man, that dish was on fire!  She probably figured Asians should be able to handle the heat but I happen to have a pathetic spice tolerance.  So, I painstakingly scraped off the seeds and fragments of chili pepper but it was worth the extra work - that dish was also delicious with a hint of sweetness, and the squid was tender, not tough and chewy.\n\nI'd definitely return to try more dishes, but just one thing to note: All the menu prices are about $1 more than the prices listed online.  Both of our dishes cost $15.50 instead of $14.50 and the jasmine rice was $2.25 instead of $1.75.", "author": "Beatrice W."}

The food is not terrible - the rendang is edible; the pempek is ok; etc. Each dish is passable. But this restaurant makes a few critical mistakes in their cooking:\n\n- Too much salt - so much that the salt overwhelms the many spices in Indonesian cooking\n- Too much oil - the best Indonesian food is not greasy. It is well-spiced.\n\nOverall, the flavor is too salty, and the food is too heavy. Nothing like the wonderful food you get in Indonesia.", "author": "Seth H."}

It tastes like someone cut up vegetables, boiled it and poured coconut water all over. DON'T GET THIS SOUP. I took a few bites and I left the rest of the bowl untouched.\nMy favorite item was the soda susu gembira.

I am to blame, as those corn fritters looked really great and my veggie friends wanted to include that somehow in our order, so this seemed like a good compromise. The fritter, which I thought would be like a corn bread, was more like an oily mush with a few kernels of corn. Big disappointment. The other parts of this plate - the veggies, soy bean cake, were overly spicy and not well flavored.\n\n54.  Bakmi Goreng / Bihun Goreng - 4 stars\n(Stir fried (egg noodle/rice stick noodle) with egg & vegetables with mixed vegetables. $9.95)\nAs simple as this dish was, it was actually really tasty!

It's not a spicy dish, but it's delicious! The beef was cooked to perfection as well.\n\nA few minor warnings:\n- The descriptions are kind of vague. I got \"noodles with curry\" and my partner got \"lamb with curry\". Despite the similar names, one dish was super spicy while the other wasn't spicy at all, and the two curries had totally different flavors. They were both delicious, but you might want to ask your waiter for details to make sure you get something to your tastes\n- Asking the waiters might not be foolproof either. Our designated waiter spoke really good English, but another waiter that we interacted with at one point spoke very broken English. If you get the second guy, getting details might be a bit tricky\n- Lastly, my noodles-with-meat dish was sizeable and tasty, but there was less meat than I was expecting. If you're looking for a high-protein meal, I probably wouldn't order anything that can be described as a carb-and-meat combo\n\nIn sum, this is a great restaurant with excellent portions, low prices, and delicious foods with unique flavors.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-10", "description": "7-September, Saturday\n The rice table (or Dutch 'Rijsttafel') was an elaborate meal of Indonesian dishes developed during the Dutch colonial era. It consists of rice and small platters of food to accompany it to achieve a balance of salty, spicy, sweet, and sour accompaniments. The only time I've ever had this was abroad in Amsterdam, but there were about 25-30 different offerings for a meal that was about 2-2.5 hours.\n\nAppetizers: \nLemongrass Soup with Potato & Chicken: I also enjoy spooning a bit of rice and pooling in the broth so that I can taste the rich flavor of the broth. The serving size was just the right amount for a taste (about a mini-bowl's worth), but I could easily eat this as a full meal.\n\nLumpia Semarang, Indonesian fried spring rolls served with peanut dipping sauce. The fillings are similar to the Chinese Popiah (spring roll), but has a mixture of bamboo shoots, chicken & prawn. I really enjoyed these the first time I had them here because I found that they were a bit sweet, which complemented the earthiness of the peanut dipping sauce.\n\nMain Course (with rice included):\n1. Rendang: The Sumatra style beef stew is curried in various spices in coconut milk curry. The quality of the meat very tenderized yet intentionally dry.. yes, it sounds like a weird juxtaposition but the sauce makes it work successfully. This was very nostalgic of my childhood as my grandmother would also makes a similar 'Malaysian' version to this that was a bit spicier, and more along the level of dryness of dehydrated beef, or the American equivalent of 'Jerky.'  The dish often slightly varies from place-to-place, culture to culture.. but I always think about the dry flaky meat as being the catalyst or method of delivery for tasting the sauce (usually ginger, tumeric leaves, lemon grass, garlic, shallot, chillies, amongst other spices)\n\n2. Oseng Oseng Tahu Tempe: sauteed & stir-fried Java soy bean cake Tempe that was caramelized on all sides & white tofu. Rather a simple dish and tasted similarly to the Tumis Kacang Panjang.\n\n3. Sate Ayum: 4x pieces of moist BBQ marinated chicken on skewer (all thigh meat) with peanut dressing. My only critique is that the smoky flavor did not come through as much as I've had with other Indonesian Satays, I was really hoping for the charred flavor to be injected into the meat.\n\n4. Ayum Panggang Bumbu Rujak: 2x pieces of spicy BBQ marinated chicken (with bone) contrasted nicely with the coconut milk sauce. So the end-result is a delicious spicy, yet sweet sensation on your tongue.\n\n5.Kari Udang: prawns in a mildly spicy curry sauce, with chunks of potatoes and eggplant. It goes well with the jasmine rice, but I like to also eat this with chappati, roti chanai, or nasi minyak.\n\n6. Gado-Gado/ Salade: blanched vegetables, tofu, potato, & egg covered in peanut dressing.. I only have had a Javanese 'Lotek' variation of this prior which is the same concept of various veggies covered in peanut sauce, except the veggies in that case are raw so you taste more of the crisp. Both topped with plain emping crackers (which are equally as tasty eaten by itself as a snack, or gently crushed into some lontong sayur). I thought that this version was a bit sauce heavy -but can easily be diluted with rice.\n\nDessert: \n1. Vanilla Ice Cream -creamy, lightly fragrant & sweet, garnished with a sour cherry.\n2. Black Sweet Rice with Coconut Milk: short grained and dark purple in flavor, very glutinous and sticky in texture. This is always a refreshing treat for me because it is warm, creamy, sweet from the toasted coconut, and a little savory.\n\nThis was a more focused version of it, with most curried meats, and peanut dressing. I wish there were more pickled, and briney dishes because those were some of my favorite fare of the Rijsttafel.", "author": "Ty T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-12", "description": "I came here with a part size of about 3 families for lunch. Luckily, we reserved a spot for our large group because there was one more reservations that was larger than ours that came at the same time. I am a fan of Indonesian food, and since I've been to many indo restaurants as well as eaten a lot of my family's cooking, I am very picky. It's safe to say that I'd come back here if I was in the area. We ordered a lot of dishes, all had large portions and they all tasted pretty well. FYI, I've been to Indonesia and have tried legit indo food, so I'm very picky and critical.\n\nFor an appetizer, we ordered 3 orders of ground beef Martabak Sapi. Wow were they big! It was pretty tasty and filling. The ground beef was a bit dry, but luckily the rest of the ingredients weren't. It's a great appetizer to share with others, but I'd suggest only eating one or two pieces or else you're going to get full easily.\n\nWe ordered 2 orders of my favorite Indonesian dish, beef rendang. The beef was amazingly tender, and it wasn't too dry, but the flavors weren't that strong. The sauce usually has stronger spices for flavor and spiciness. That's what I love about it. Unfortunately, this was definitely my favorite rendang. \n\nWe ordered two orders of Soto betawi, an Indonesian coconut soup with beef, cabbage, potato & tomato. It was pretty tasty, but again, didn't have enough flavor as I'm used to. At least the potatoes, tomatoes, and other dishes were soft and easy to eat. I was just happy that I got to have some for my meal.\n\nI was surprised to see honey chicken on the menu, and have never tried it at an Indonesian restaurant, so we ordered 3 orders of it. The chicken was sweet! I loved it! I love honey and I love chicken, so this combo just made my day! I enjoyed the honey cooked onto the chicken to perfection. To me, it felt like the honey definitely stuck on the chicken well.\n\nLastly, we ordered 3 dishes of some carbs: Nasi Goreng (regular Indonesian fried rice for those who cannot take spicy food, Nasi Goreng Terasi Pedas (tTraditional spicy shrimp paste fried rice with egg, onion), and Bakmi Goreng (stir fried egg noodle with egg & vegetables), all with chicken. All were tasty with the spices and ingredients, but I loved the Nasi Goreng Terasi Pedas the most. I like spicy and I LOVE Nasi Goreng (fried rice)!!\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 since my favorite Indonesian dishes weren't that great at this restaurant. I'll give it another 0.5 stars for the great and friendly service.\n\nTip: Order family-style so you can try different dishes. The Nasi Goreng Terasi Pedas is the best rice dish to eat with other dishes, but make sure you can take spicy food.", "author": "Kevin S."}

Overall, we really enjoyed the dishes that we ordered and were annoyed with the service.  Note that the review rating is specifically for the food.  \n\nLate on a Friday night, we had reservations for a group of 5. A few people in my party were not on time to get to the table. Once we were all seated, the staff seemed eager to get us to order right away.  One staff member especially had a really snappy attitude and seemed to rush us in ordering saying their \"kitchen was busy\". Now, had there been lots of people waiting to be seated, I would understand.  But, all groups awaiting a table were 2-3 people and their smaller tables were turning over quickly.  So needless to say, I was less than impressed by his demeanor!\n \nWe ordered appetizers and main dishes.  Each dish was flavorful and unique. I loved the food so much that I would consider going back (realllly hope service is better next time!!) or taking food to go. \n- Roti Prata (Pan fried layered bread served with curry dipping sauce),\n  This flaky goodness reminds me of biscuits but with the crunch of fried food! Dipping it in curry adds a blast of flavor on this comfort food.\n\n- Sate Kombinasi (Combination of grilled marinated chicken & beef on skewers served with peanut sauce),\n  Both chicken and steak were juicy and steaming hot. I love me some succulent meaat.  \n\n- Combination Spicy Seafood AKA \"Seafood Pedas Selera\" (Sauteed squid, fish fillet & shrimp cooked with traditional spicy sauce)\n  We ordered this because we saw it on a nearby table and it looked pretty good! It's a bit on the spicy side (6.5 on a 10 spice heat scale).  \n\n- Rendang (Sumatra beef stew cooked with spices in coconut milk sauce)\n  Perfectly simmered beef stew.  It simply melts in your mouth! \n\n- BBQ Chicken Curry AKA \"Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak\" (B.B.Q. marinated chicken cooked with coconut milk) \n  Very flavorful chicken curry! \n\n- Nasi Goreng w/ chicken and shrimp (Indonesian fried rice with egg, onion, and meat) \n  This fried rice was the perfect accompaniment for all the other flavorful main courses. \n\n- Mie Tek Tek Goreng w/ chicken + mixed vegetables (Spicy Java Stir fried noodle with egg & vegetables)  \n  Loved these noodles!

The Roti (aka \"pan fried bread\") was moist-yet-crisp and the Prata (aka \"curry dipping sauce\") was heaven in a bowl. As a final and incredibly important side note, the addition of the cilantro (which was served as a garnish) took the bread-curry-sauce combo from \"excellent\" to \"orgasmic.\" If you find yourself staring down a Roti Prata, add a sliver of cilantro to each bite and thank me later.\n\nFor our main course, I ordered the Mie Tek Tek (Option #49) - it is offered as a soup or as a stir fry and, although my initial inclination was to order it as a soup, my boyfriend pursuaded me to order the stir fry option as it \"would be easier to share.\" Although the stir fry tasted better-than-average, I would have found it more appealing had I been starving, stoned, or drunk as the stir fry noodles were quite heavy and, post-Roti Prata, I was feeling pretty stuffed. If I had to do it over again, I would have ignored my boyfriend and ordered it as a soup and likely been perfectly satisfied.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Nasi Padang (Option #54) and was surprised when the beef stew, spicy tofu, chicken, and vegetables were served in several separate, small, neat sections on his plate (he had imagined them all engaging in a food orgy as one delicious dish). Still, each individual component tasted very good  with the coconut curry vegetables ranking as the number one favorite part of the dish. \n\nAll of the above plus 2 perfectly paired Tiger Beers came to a grand total of $42 - not bad for dinner-for-2 in San Francisco.\n\nMy boyfriend and I agree that this a 4 rather than 5 star experience simply because, although the food was \"tasty,\" for Southeast Asian food category, it wasn't spicy enough to make the jump to \"excellent\" - when I see 2 out of 2 \"chillies\" on the menu, I expect my food to have a little more \"oomph.\"", "author": "Philippa L."}

We were kinda st-t-t... well, not quite ourselves since we were enjoying some local... uhhh...libations... yeah, that's it, libations. I just remember the swirling patterns on the wallpaper in the restaurant were all kinda swirling, and when all the dishes of the rijsttafel (Indonesian rice dinner) came out one at a time, I think they started to talk to me. Yeah, the dishes. Man, I was so hi-i-i... high on life since I was in Europe. Yep, Europe. \n\nI think one of the reasons I haven't come back to Indonesian food is that I always thought you had to have a gaggle of people to enjoy all the little dishes. I don't know a gaggle, maybe a small herd but not a gaggle. So here I was by myself after a doctor's appointment thinking I could be easy and go to Pearl's Deluxe Burgers next door or throw caution to the wind and come here. As it turned out, there are plenty of choices for a solitary diner, and coming in at 4 in the afternoon certainly meant inattentive service was not going to be an issue. \n\nIn a peckish mood, I ordered two things. First up was the $5.50 Siomay Ayam, a small appetizer which consisted of three steamed chicken dumplings blended with seafood and best of all, accompanied by a hot garlic peanut sauce (see photo). I forgot how much kick some of those Indonesian sauces had, but it provides a nice contrast to the quite dense, meatball-like dumplings. My main dish was a house specialty, the $10.95 Nasi Uduk Lengkap. It was a cornucopia of goodies on a rectangular platter anchored by a bowl-shaped serving of rice cooked with coconut milk.\n\nSurrounding it were pieces of fried chicken, strands of scrambled egg that looked like pasta, a very spicy wedge of tofu, an overly dried-out chunk of honey, and some shrimp crackers (see photo). Most of it was tasty, some of it - like the beef - which just wasn't edible. The service was nice, always smiling since they probably don't expect business at that hour of the day.

Borobudur's been around forever and not too far off from my apartment, so thought we'd give it a try.\n\nOut of the dishes we ordered, beef rendang was easily the best.  It was actually really authentic- way cooked down beef that falls apart on the fork, in a dry curry with the perfect proportion of spices.  This with a bowl of rice is total comfort food.\n\nOther items were not so great.  The recommended veggies (spinach and tofu) had so much belachan that it overwhelmed the entire dish.  The grilled fish marinated in dried spices with \"Indonesian salsa\" was disappointing too.  The marinade tasted more like bottled sweet and sour sauce, and the salsa wasn't very interesting either. At this point I was really missing all of the delicious sambals that come with every meal in Indonesia.  (I asked about sambal and the waiter said they were out.)\n\nSo...the worst for last...dessert.  Why we ordered this, I don't know:  grilled banana with cheese and chocolate.  An adventurous thought, maybe?  What arrived was actually half a plantain absolutely smothered in shredded, unmelted cheddar, drizzled with chocolate sauce and topped with waxy chocolate sprinkles.  It tasted about as appetizing as it sounds.   Do not get this!\n\nA little over $60 for two people made for a mildly overpriced experiment.

Aside from meeting some really great people I had a chance to partake in some seriously good food (and let's face it, this is really why I showed up!)\n\nOur meal was served family style, which was perfect in breaking the ice and getting to know one another. \n\nOur menu:\nSoto Ayam Soup (Lemon Grass, Bean Sprout, Egg, Chicken, Rice Noodle)\nIt was fantastic, very smooth, bursting with flavor, I LOVED IT.\n\nTahu Goregn (Fried Tofu with Hot Garlic Peanut Sauce)\nI wasn't super impressed with this dish, the tofu was cooked well, but the breading was lacking in flavor, the sauce was decent, I don't love peanuts or peanut sauces so I may be bias. \n\nRendang (Sumatra beef stew cooked with Spices in Coconut Milk Sauce)\nYUM. The beef was pull apart tender, the spices were flavourful, not spicy and the coconut sause added a nice texture.\n\nTahu & Terong Balado (Egplant & Tofu cooked in Spicy Chili)\nBoy was it SPICY, this dish had more then spice though, it had good, hot flavour. Sadly, the eggplant was a little overcooked in my opinion, the tofu was great.\n\nAyam Panggang Bumbu Rujak (BBQ chicken w/ spicy coconut sauce)\nThis was probably my favorite dish of the meal. The chicken was on the bone, booked perfectly, was super juicy and had a great, flavor and spice that was cut by the sweetness of the Coconut Milk Sauce.. WINNER.\n\nKari Udang (Shrimp & Veggies in Coconut Curry Sauce)\nHere we had a very simple dish, I wish I had taken a photo because it was beautiful, colourful, bright, light, it was just so pretty! And it tasted wonderful as well. It was soft in flavor, the shrimp were not over or under cooked, the veggies where crisp yet soft and that coconut curry sauce was to die for.\n\nBubur Ketan Hitam (Black sweet rice w/ fresh coconut milk)\nWow... Wow... Wow... I could have eaten 5 servings of this. I loved that I was given a small bowl with the rice on the bottom and coconut milk on top and was expected to mix it myself, this allowed us to watch the transformation, the rice was hot and heated up the milk, once mixed it looked like chunky slightly melted chocolate and it was HEAVEN in my mouth. The Texture this dish had was really great, slightly chew, milky, pudding like as it started to cool down and the flavor was sweet, the perfect ending to a flavor filled meal!\n\nParking was easy on a Monday around 6:30PM, I nabbed a spot just a few blocks away.\n\nYep, I would totally go here again.", "author": "Meghan L."}

They finished their meals when one of our main course finally arrived. We had five people in our party, by the time everyone's meal arrived, about one hour has already passed. By that time the other table were leaving, having enjoyed their food. Other new customers seemed to suffer similar or worse fate than us. \n\nThe food that we ordered was authentic enough. Had it not for the preferential treatment to their repeat customers (just my guess from their conversation), I would recommend this restaurant for any new customers.

We ordered the roti which is like a fluffed up, crispy, fried yet squishy bread that is similar to a Chinese onion pancake, but better. It was a huge portion that could have fed 4 if we weren't so damn hungry and natural gluttonous. It also came with a very pleasant curry dipping sauce. We also got an item that looked like egg rolls that were filled with beef, egg and onions. Not bad, but will pass next time. The stars of the night were the honey beef and spicy chicken curry. The beef was not as saucy or sweet as I had anticipated, but it was extremely tender and flavorful. Good because FANTASTIC after pouring that magic sauce from the roti all over it.

Tasty, fair portion.\n\nBeef rendang: I like it a bit more coconut-y.  Maybe some people like it more like this, but subjectively, not my favorite restaurant beef rendang.  I like Bay Leaf in Sunnyvale's beef rendang better.\n\nTumis bayam bawang putih: spinach and tofu sauteed with garlic.  Hard to go wrong with spinach and garlic.  Kind of pricey in a price to quantity ratio, but I would order it again just to fool myself into thinking I'm being healthy by eating veggies at a restaurant.  \n\nComing from San Jose, I probably won't make the trek up to SF *just* for Borobudur, since we have a fair amount of SE Asian/Indo restaurants down here, but if you're in the area and want something a little different, give Borobudur a try.", "author": "Laura S."}

The meals were all pretty close to home. The service was a little hectic, but my mom said that it reminded her of actual Indonesian restaurants back home with a lot of screaming at each other going on. We had the chicken satay as an appetizer and they were ok but nothing to write home about. We didn't see any other satay options like beef, pork, or goat, though. The peanut sauce was ok as well, but could've used a little more zing. The rendang was also good but nothing great. Seemed to be the par for most of the dishes. All good, just not great. They all seemed a little toned down. Maybe that's for the Americans. The es cendol was fantastic, I will say that. Haven't had it in awhile and they made a great one. The nasi goreng was also kind of just ok. Maybe I just had high expectations. The fried bananas as a dessert were also a little lacking. Not bad, just not great. Usually I have pisang goreng with the really ripened bananas and these seem to have used fresher ones. It wasn't a bad experience and I would recommend it for people who might want to try Indonesian food or if you haven't had it in awhile and have a craving, it will get you through. I'll go back again to try some more dishes for old time's sake... maybe next time will be the rijstaffel.", "author": "Roger M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-08-20", "description": "Fully expecting your typical Southeast Asian type of food (Thai/Malay/Singaporean), I was actually surprised by the uniqueness and complexity of Indonesian food. I'm also surprised this place only has 3.5 stars on Yelp, because it's definitely one of the better restaurants that I've recently tried!\n\nAs first timers to this type of cuisine, it was most definitely a difficult choice, but we managed to pick out a variety of things:\n\n- roti prata: A must-have at any Southeast Asian restaurant. It is served in a fairly large quantity here and very tasty, as expected!\n- otak otak panggang: BBQ fish cake wrapped in banana leaf. This was presented as small cylindrical fish cakes rolled into three small banana leafs, which were then bbq'd on a grill. Not the crab cake-like \"cake\" that I had imagined. It was my first attempt trying fish cakes, so it was a bit pungent on the fish smell and taste. \n- fuyunghai/Indonesian egg fu yung: We opted for the vegetables egg fu yung, which came out as a very large deep fried fritter speckled with crunchy veggies throughout. It was served with a sweet dipping sauce, which was a nice accompaniment but definitely overwhelmed the flavor of the egg fu yung when eaten together.\n- tahu & terong balado: My fav dish of them all! The eggplant retained its bright purple exterior skin and contrasted so well among the tofu and green beans. The dish was visually stunning and equally tasty. However, be forewarned that this one is SPICY. The dish is doused with a chili sauce. Those two chili symbols next to the entree are no joke.\n- nasi udak/aromatic rice: Instead of the typical white, brown, coconut rice options, we opted for the aromatic rice that was cooked with coconut and lemongrass flavors. It was most definitely aromatic and delicious! While the lemongrass was extremely apparent in the flavor, the coconut a little less so.\n\nWhile we had no room for dessert, Borobudur was a fantastic experience in Indonesian cuisine! The restaurant is casual enough, yet ornate enough if you're thinking of taking a date there. Definitely go when the sun has set, because the restaurant has huge windows from which light pours in, so you don't fully feel the nice lighting effects until the place has darkened. I'll be back here in a heartbeat!\n\nP.S. Make a reservation! The place was PACKED with a wait by 7pm on a Saturday.", "author": "Mansi A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-11-05", "description": "Although Borobudor's food is deserving of 4 STARS, it's being downgraded to 3 STARS because of their service. \n\nWe came to Borobudor as it came highly recommended from my co-worker and because my gf and I never had Indonesian food before. We came on Tuesday night at around 6:30 PM. There was no wait as there were only 2 other tables filled.\n\nFOOD:\n*Martabak Sapi (Ground beef with egg & onion in crispy dough): It was just meh. We expected something more of a samosa filled with stir-fried ground beef. What we got was a steamed Viet-like meatloaf wrapped in a wonton wrapper and fried. The filling itself was quite bland.\n\n*Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak (B.B.Q. marinated chicken cooked with spicy coconut milk sauce): The chicken was very flavorful and was fork tender. What made the dish was the sauce. You can tell the sauce was a result of a slow reduction of the coconut milk and spices braising the chicken which produced a very flavorful and rich sauce. I love spicy foods, and this dish has the right amount of kick from the chili, ginger, and other spices. \n\n*Rendang (Beef cooked with coconut milk in spice): The BEST dish of the night. Normally, I'm use to Rendang in a coconut curry sauce. Borobudor's Rendang is covered in a very thick coconut spicy sauce. The huge chunks of beef were SUPER tender and broke apart easily with a fork. Just like the chicken, the beef was braised slowly in the coconut milk and spice concoction which produced a very flavorful, thick, and rich sauce which glued to the beef. This with rice....*Drool*\n\n*Mie Tek Tek (Stir-fried noodle with chicken, egg and vegetables): We ordered this dish after all the rave reviews on YELP; but I have to say it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. It was basically Pad See Ew made with chow mein noodles. Although the dish itself had great flavor from the garlic, soy sauce, sugar, and other spices; the noodles were a bit mushy and the chicken breast strips were very bland and dry. \n\nSERVICE: Borobudor's service is slow, very very slow. We ordered at 6:45 pm and didn't get our appetizer until 7:18 pm. All this time while waiting for our appetizer, 5 parties who arrived and ordered AFTER us, all received their appetizers and main entrees before us. Ok, something is wrong with this picture!!! Needless to say, we were highly frustrated and was very close to walking out the door. \n\nAfter receiving our food, they never checked on us and we had to flag them down when we needed hot sauce or more napkins. \n\nService can make or break your restaurant experience. Although I really enjoyed the food at Borobudor; I'm uncertain if I would return because of the very slow service. There's too many good Asian restaurants in SF with better service (i.e. FASTER) than have to deal with poor service at Borobudor.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The lumpia (spring rolls) were burnt and not that tasty. The salmon was very good, so was the kangkong or konshing (water spinach). \n\nOverall the six of us dropped $160 for lunch without drinks. Tips were already added to the bill and the service was slow and not prompt. The place had two tables and I had to ask for water refill. \n\nWould have given them three stars, but they sat us in the back of the restaurant next to the bathroom.

Thankfully the presentation doesn't off-set the generous portion sizes. I hate it when they try too hard to make the food look good, but then I walk out of the restaurant still feeling hungry and yearning for more. The taste of food is authentic with a mix of Westernized hint. You can really tell why when you look around at the tables around you. The customer base has certainly widened in diversity. Indonesian dishes are usually very extreme in taste and aroma. That being the case may not appeal to every individual out there. But Borobudur tries to find the balance. So in other words, it is a little \"watered down.\" \n\nYou still will not be dissatisfied. I guarantee that. Try something new when you go here. Don't just choose grilled chicken as a default dish.

I had the ice tea, which was made exactly to Indonesian specifications (iced Jasmine tea with sugar, mmm mmm good!), and mom had the Indonesian ice coffee, which was also excellent. \n\nAnd to the people who complain about portions, that's why we Americans are fat! The portion size of the entr\u00e9e and appetizer were just about what we would have at home in Indonesia.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-09-24", "description": "In a time when Thai is the new Chinese, everyone eats sushi and most people know Korean BBQ, it is nice to find cuisine from a lesser represented Asian nation.  I found the food here to be similar to Malaysian, which makes sense given the geographic and island commonalities.  I'm glad my party avoided the Rijsttafel.  It may be a good deal for one person, but two or more people can do better ordering more interesting items from the menu \u00e0 la carte for the same or lower price.\n\nRoti Prata: Reminds me of the Malaysian dish Roti Canai, except no chicken in the curry.  Love how the Indonesian roti is so much fluffier and crispier than Indian rotis.  Dipping into the curry sauce soaks up some spicy flavor without softening the yummy crunch.\n\nSiomay Ayam Goreng: Not like the dumplings I'm familiar with from Chinese/Japanese/Vietnamese/Thai/Nepalese/Burmese/Korean cultures.  More like a meatball of ground chicken and seafood sliced in half and deep fried.  Tasty even without the doughy wrapper.  The spicy peanut sauce was a great sauce.\n\nEmpal Goreng:\"Friend honey beef\" was a rather strange description so I had to give this a try.  It was like Beef Rendang without the curry sauce.  It was a tad dry, but extremely tender and tasty.  Kind of like Indonesian-fied Yankee Pot Roast.\n\nAyam Bakar Cabe: Nothing fancy, just BBQ chicken with a spicy chili marinade.  I will say the meat was EXTREMELY tender and juicy, oddly better in consistency than what I've had at most other places.  How do they do that?\n\nMie Tek Tek: When at an Asian restaurant that serves rice \u00e0 la carte, I'd much rather get a noodle dish for the table than have each person commit a universal faux pas to Asian parents (even if they aren't Asian themselves) by buying individual rice sides.  They offered this particular noodle dish dry and stir fried, despite the online menu mentioning it only as a soup.  It was like a typical lo mein dish, but slightly spicier.  I liked it.", "author": "Adam B."}

Sure, there may be plenty of consensus 5-star restaurants in town, but I really don't care because I can get similar back home. I also don't weight ambience or service heavily (unless they are real bad). What I do care about is great interesting food, and Borobudur has delivered each of the 3 times I've been there better than any other SF restaurant I've been to.\n\nMy favorites:\n- Rendang - Sumatra beef stew cooked with spices in coconut milk sauce. Rendang at Borobudur is just incredible. The beef is tender, and the sauce is like a thick curry and very tasty.\n- Mie Tek Tek Goreng - Spicy stir fried java noodles with egg, vegetables, and chicken. Very unique and tasty sauce on this dish. Crave-able.\n- Lumpia Semarang - Spring roll stuffed with tofu, bamboo shoots, carrot, & chicken. This is served with a wonderful dipping sauce.\n- Sate Ayam - Chicken skewers with peanut sauce.

I can go on... but..\n\nBasically, I was excited to try Borobudur after seeing it on Check Please Bay Area on KQED a few weeks back. So did a whole bunch of other people because this place was at capacity for a Saturday night dinner. Our waiter even said that ever since that episode aired they've doubled their business. \n\nSo in our group dinner date one of our friends, Dee, just happens to be Indonesian. So I was like cool, I'm sure she'll let us know if this place is legit. The interesting part was that she said she hadn't tried and recognized many of the dishes on their menu as they are not typical dishes her and her family would eat on a day to day. Much the same as if an Italian person went to the Olive Garden and ordered the Zucca Toscana soup or if a Chinese person went to Panda Express and ate -gasp - Kung Pao chicken. \n\nThe menu had alot of interesting items, so many that we decided to have the waiter make his recommendations on their signature items. \n\n1. The lemongrass soup - it was ok, Mingalaba in Burlingame makes a better lemongrass soup imo. \n\n2. Beef Rendang - the coconut adds a nice smoothness - the beef was tender - our groups consensus favorite. Move over Thai Penang curry, I have a new favorite. \n\n3. BBQ Marinated spicy chicken in special chili sauce - Our group's # 2 favorite dish - the special chili sauce tasted like Mae Ploy. I could replicate this dish at home.  \n\n3. Bakmi Goreng aka Stir fried egg noodle dish - It was aiiight - basically chow mein \n\n4. Ikan Bakar Samudra aka grilled trout fish - This tasted like Indonesia. I can totally picture eating something like this on the beach of one of their islands. \n\n5. Veggie Sampler platter - this one included a soybean cake that Dee said her dad would make for all the time. It came with this spicy peanut butter sauce. \n\nOverall - 3.5 Stars, the food was good, very similar to Thai. I'm happy that I can cross off Indonesian on my foods eaten list. With all the extra hype and customers Borobudur's been getting, I think the staff hasn't adjusted to being busy yet.", "author": "Earl G."}

There are others that are half-Indonesian and half-Thai or something, Lime Tree SE and Bay Leaf for example, but since they are not fully Indonesian, they can't even be considered in running for this title.\n\nIf you come here on a weekday afternoon, you will probably meet Marie (check spelling). She is the friendly waitress during those times. I usually see her on Wednesdays' lunch. She is the only one there (other than kitchen staff), so yes, service can be rather slow, so just make sure you want to have a leisurely time when you have a meal here.\n\nI read many reviews that were disappointed with the food. To prevent that, order only the food I recommend. :) Oh, btw, everything served in this restaurant is Halal.\n\nMy recommendations (in order of my preference):\n\nVegetarian:\n1. Lumpia Semarang - Special Fried Spring Roll - it has bamboo shoots in it. Semarang is the city where this dish is famous for.\n2. Gado-gado - cooked salad with peanut sauce. \nRemember it is cooked. So if you like you salad raw and crunchy, dont order this.\n3. Corn fritters - fried corn with green onions and chillies.\n4. Tempe - Oseng2 or Fried - this soy bean cake has a very distinct flavor. You either love it or hate it. I used to hate it when I was a kid.\n\nNon-vegetarians:\n1. Mie Tek2 Goreng - Fried Noodles.\n2. Mie Tek2 Kuah - The same noodles as above but with soup.\n3. Empek2 Palembang - Fish cake with egg in the middle served with tangy sauce.\n4.Siomay Bandung - almost like Gado2, but it has less veggies and instead it has fish cakes and chicken dumplings.\n5. Ayam Bakar Cabe - Grilled Chicken\n6. Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak - Grilled Chicken with Coconut Chili Sauce\n7. Rendang - Beef Stew\n8. Soto Ayam/Soto Betawi - Chcken/Beef Soup\n9. Kangkung Sambal Terasi - Water Spinach with Shrimp Paste\n10. Nasi Goreng Terasi Pedas with Salted Fish - Only for the brave!\n\nDon't order the Nasi Rames/Uduk/Padang. Don't order Rijstafel.\n\nDessert:\n1. Es Campur - Shaved Ice with tropical fruits - much better than Es Teler.\n2. Es Kelapa Muda - Young Coconut\n3. Roti Prata Manis - not exactly Indonesian, but it's good\n4. Bubur Ketan Hitam - black glutinous rice with coconut sauce.\n\nThey usually open a vendor booth on Indonesia Day (at least they did on 2010) and they usually sell more variety than what they have in their regular menu on that day.

I love the way Borobudur makes it, it's coconut-y and spicy at the same time! They manage to give their rendang beef this incredible mixture of sweet, savory and spicy at the same time.  Not to mention that the beef feels like velvet in your mouth and practically melts on your tongue.  I've never once had gristly beef with this dish. \n\n4. GULAI KAMBING: Lamb curry in coconut milk sauce...need I say more?\n\n5. VEGGIE RICE PLATE: You gotta get your veggies and your starches in somehow!\n\n6. AYAM GORENG KALASAN: Fried honey chicken.

The bread was little bit overcooked. The curry was so watery....no curry flavor at all. \n\nStir fried rice stick noodle with egg & vegetables with Chicken - It was ok. Little bit salty and the meat was kinda dry. \n\nTumis Kangkung Terasi Pedas (Sauteed water spinach with shrimp paste chili) - Very tasty and it was my favorite dish of the night. The water spinach was fresh with the perfect amount of shrimp paste. GOOD! \n\nI'm probably not going back there in a short time.", "author": "Liza T."}

We found the young waitress to be personable and friendly, as well as her Father (?).  We also noticed the small restaurant filled up very quickly and then the few servers scrambled to get good service to everyone.  My suggestion is always make a reservation, come early for dinner, and order fairly quickly to beat the rush. We ordered #57:Mie Tek Tek Goreng. which were egg noodles with a rich, spicy sauce.  How delicious!!! We couldn't get enough of so we had to order a second dish of the same to share (not a big portion).  I believe we got the #53: Nasi Goreng Terasi Pedas fried rice because the waitress asked if we wanted it very spicy and if we liked shrimp paste, which matches the description on their online menu.  It was soooo spicy that it became painful to eat.  However the pain wasn't enough to stop us from taking bite after bite and serving ourselves more of this generously portioned side dish.  I wish I had ordered the Roti but I forgot. \n\nThe #30 Beef Rendang consisted of several huge chunks of tender beef in a dark, thick, rich, spicy coconut sauce.  It didn't look like much but due to the richness of the sauce we couldn't even finish it.  It wasn't as good as the Honey Chicken which consisted of about 4 medium sized pieces (legs/thighs etc.), but I'm glad we ordered both.  The Honey Chicken didn't have a sticky coating as I expected but simply a sweet flavor surrounding (grilled or BBQ'd?) chicken which was moist and fork tender. Again I wish there had been a larger portion but at least we ordered enough dishes to share with eachother.  Our last dish was #42 Tumis Buncis Pedas Udang Kering or spicy, salty green beans with dried shrimp.  They were delicious and a nice offset to the other dishes.  \n\nI would have passed on the appetizer: #9: Siomay Ayam (goreng/kukus) or steamed chicken dumplings mixed w/seafood in a spicy peanut dipping sauce.  The six small bite-sized, oddly textured morsels were not justified of the price although the sauce was good.  I also felt #21. Pisang Bakar Keju or deep fried plantain wrapped in wonton skin and covered with cheese and chocolate sauce was an abomination of a dish.  WTF were they thinking here?  I expected an Indian Paneer-type cheese but they covered a barely edible plantain with shredded cheddar cheese which did not go at all with the chocolate sauce.  Oh well, #27: Es Campur was sold out but #26: Es Teler was a refreshing shaved ice desert which was too small to share by more than 2 people and quickly devoured!  The other fried plantain and ice cream desert was fine.  The bill was well over $100 but the food was unique and well executed and we enjoyed the service very much.  Although we've only been to Bali and not Jakarta where this family is from, there were many Indonesians eating here so I believe it must be decently authentic.", "author": "Elizabeth S."}

I like Borobudur Restaurant better than Indonesia Restaurant (http://www.yelp.com/biz/indonesia-restaurant-san-francisco#hrid:mTjFFyNucoL0q-NZ5xggGQ/query:indonesian).\n\nThey serve almost same menu and they are less than 100 meters away from each other... I went to both of them more than 10 times each and finally decided I like Borobudur better for 2 main reasons:\n\n1. Their chicken Satay is really really really good.  The chicken is juicy and perfectly cooked.  Moreover, I like their peanut sauce - not too sweet.\n2. Their Bakmi Ayam Baso Sapi (Egg noodles with chicken, fried wontons, beef balls and vegetables served with chicken broth on the side) is great.  I really love the full flavor of their chicken broth and smoothness of the beef balls.  \n\n+Only few things...Borobudur serves beer and wine but does not serve sake.  (I know beer is probably the best choice of beverage to go with Indonesian cuisine...  but I occasionally want something other than beer...)  Indonesia Restaurant has great cold sake choices... and their fried wontons are better...\n\nI will give Borobudur 3.79 stars and Indonesia Restaurant 3.52 stars.", "author": "Chie J."}

For me, these were either hit or miss.\n\nThe corn fritters known as Bakwan Jagung $5.50 were dense, and more like corn cakes. They came with a creamy, spicy sauce which seemed to have relish in it.  When I had these at places in LA, they were more like fritters.  Maybe it's just more authentic here -- I don't know.  Whatever the case, not my fave.\n\nAlthough 1 YELPer advised against it, I ordered the Nasi Goreng Borobudur $9.95 - fried jasmine rice with chicken, jalapenos, dried fish, tomato, cucumber on side.  It seemed to be missing something acidic to round out the flavor- it would have been better with ketchap manis or sambal condiment on side.  Be sure to order the ketchap manis or sambal if you want a little acidity or kick to any of your dishes.  My guess is that they don't automatically offer these condiments b/c of wasting by the patrons.\n\nThe quantity of the Nasi Goreng Borobudur rice dish was very plentiful and really a meal for 2.  I took my leftovers home and they passed the reheating test the following day.  Nice!\n\nTo finish my meal, I had the Bubur Ketan Hitam $4.95  -- creamy, sweet and slightly salty black rice pudding with a dash of coconut milk.  This was also mentioned in quite a few reviews and was definitely a hit with me, especially since it was dairy and wheat-free.\n\nParking can be challenging in this 'hood since it's on the edge of the T-loin and the theatre district, but I came on a weekday around 2pm and bypassed the lunch crowd.  I lucked out with street parking and the restaurant wasn't too busy for a late lunch so it was pretty quiet and relaxing.\n\nIf I'm in the 'hood again, I might give it a try for some a la carte dishes recommended by YELPers.", "author": "Bodhi D."}

We ordered the Rijstafel (the sampler for $27 per person), which we thought would be a great way to sample a bit of everything.  We asked if our party of two could share one and they said \"sure, we just need to add $6 for the extra soup, spring roll, and dessert.\"  We additionally added the steamed egg noodle with the spicy sweet sauce and the string beans with shrimp paste.  \n\nWhat did we think?  For my last meal, I was expecting so much more.  The flavours were good, but the food came out lukewarm to cool.  Not one dish was hot.  It felt like it was reheated in a microwave and dumped onto a plate where parts of the dish were lukewarm and parts were very cool.

Very disappointed, but i guess i should have know.  The description on the menu was pretty blatant.  \n\nThe only dish I was very excited about was the spinach and it never arrived.  instead the server insisted we ordered the Indonesian Egg Fu yung.  it looked yummy, but it arrived nearly 15 minutes after we finished eating all the other items and we were already too full by then.\n\nShe was really insistent that we ordered it and proceeded to show us on the menu what it was.  Again we told her we did not order it and said the dish we did order never arrived.  I understand mistakes happen, and communication is an issue. As a server myself, if i know a guest ordered something i clearly repeated back to them (she didnt repeat or order back to us) and it comes out incorrectly, I still apologize and offer to bring the correct item.  I do not insist that the customer ordered it.  \nit was very rude.  We sent it back and she refused to come serve us after that.  We had a new server for the rest of the night.  \n\nI then asked for the dessert menu and our new server told us that the kitchen was closed and immediately gave me my check.   I paid, tipped 20% and left a big fat sad face on the receipt.  \n\nAnother couple came in 5 min after and they were seated and served dinner.

I was so excited when I got here because of the buzz around the place, and all the news articles pinned up in the window. I thought it was going to be great. \n\nFirst of all, the wait took a little while.. about 30 minutes. 30 minutes is actually standard, maybe even quick, for a Saturday night for 2 at a restaurant. But what bugged me is that when tables cleared up, no on rushed to clear them so the next people could be seated. Furthermore, I was looking around at at least 3 or 4 tables that hadn't been given water yet.. they were just sitting there with their menus closed, waiting to order.\n\nOnce we finally sat down, it took us a long time to order too! We were totally ready because we had spent out wait time looking at the menu, so we had a pretty good idea of what we wanted. Waited for forever, til I finally just flagged someone down and asked if we \"could order at some point\". The woman was nice, though.\n\nWe ordered the roti (nice and flaky...I liked it a lot), coconut rice (oddly, my favorite dish), fish cake in spicy vinegar (decent), the egg noodles goreng (it just tasted like lo mein from an American Chinese takeout place... meh), and the beef rendang. OK, so halfway through the meal they told us they had RUN OUT of the beef rendang. I was so upset because that's the dish I came here for!! And if they had been quicker with their service, we perhaps might have still been able to get some. UGH i was so mad, so we just ordered some other spicy beef dish, which really wasn't that great at all. \n\nLastly, it took forever to get the check. The food here is okay, but the service is TERRIBLE. I can't believe a restaurant with this much buzz and hype can't fix their goddamn service. This pretty much put a damper on our night.

A first look the menu didn't quite excite me as the offerings were fairly standard - stir fry vegetables, fried rice, spicy seafood and meat. Some items stood out though. For example, the nasi goreng terasi pedas was pungent and aromatic (not for the faint hearted, especially those who don't care for anything reminiscent of fish sauce). Buncis pedas udang kering was also intensely shrimpy and perfectly cooked. Fried spring rolls too were fresh tasting, surprisingly. The grilled chicken (Ayam Bakar Cabe) failed to impress, however. Even though I liked the fried rice, I find its prices higher than average. C'mon, it's just fried rice! Overall, great service and fairly good food for Indonesian food newbies.

Shrimp chips, potato, peanut sauce, hard boiled egg, on steamed spinach... it was heavy and sticky textured, lacked bite, and didn't sit well.  The shrimp chips were particularly unwelcome on top of an entree- styrofoamy and sogged-out, and they seemed straight from a snack bag.  Blech.  Well, I tried something I didn't like much, but I can't blame them that I didn't know what I was ordering.  I had a plate of my friend's fried rice which made me much more happy.  \n\nPrices seemed moderate and usual.

I've only had a limited amount of Indonesian food and was eager to widen my repertoire further, so we decided to give it a shot.\n\nWhen we arrived (sometime before 7) the place was fairly empty, so we seated ourselves in a nice booth in the back.  It's a very low-key, modest-feeling restaurant, but I think that's ideal for having a quiet meal with a friend in which you're also trying some new food.\n\nThe menu is chock full of goodies, to the point of being a little intimidating, but we decided to share the roti prata and then split a combination plate of rice, chicken, beef, tofu, and veggies.  First: allow me to rave about the roti prata.  SO.  SOGOOD.  For your money's worth you get a veritable mound of fried, doughy goodness, served up nice and hot.  The sauce with which it comes is surprisingly thin, but most of the satisfaction I lost in the texture department was made up for in the adjacent flavor department.\n\nOur main course had its ups and downs.  Both the beef and chicken were very, very tender and juicy, and I liked the sauces with which they came, too.  The tofu was served with a tomato-based sauce, but I wish that the tofu had maybe spent more time marinating.  And the curry sauce with the vegetables was the same puzzlingly thin sauce served with the roti prata, only you miss the richness of the sauce much more when all you have is veggies and not a huge hunk of fried bread.  The entire presentation of the dish was very nice, and our steamed rice was sculpted into a neat little tower, but I don't think it was as fresh as it could have been.\n\nAll of these things would have been entirely forgivable, as it was a really nice meal - except the entree was supposed to be spicy.  It had two chili peppers next to it on the menu!  Alas, even after all we ate, my mouth was barely tingling, and that's just plain disappointing.\n\nI feel similar to Delya S., who recently exclaimed how much she wanted to like Borobudur and rate them well.  The servers were very nice and answered all of our questions, and I get the impression that it's owned by very honest and kind people.  The prices were incredibly reasonable for what we got, and the food averaged out to being fairly tasty, but on the whole I'm fairly ambivalent.

It's not typical thai food.\" Then my friends corrected me by saying, \"This is Indonesian food!!!\" Duh!!! My bad!\n\nFriday nights are pretty busy and Borobudur was our third choice as we made our way up Post Street. Without a reservation, we got a table within 5 minutes. The service was kind of slow but worked out in our favor since we had a leisurely meal.\n\nOur dinner for 3 communal style consisted of:\n\nChicken Satay (good)\nLumpia Semarang (good but looked different in the high tech display in the window)\nSoto Ayam Soup (I didn't have any but it looked good and it was plenty for 2 people. The soup bowls are the size of tea cups.)\nEmpal Goreng (Fried honey beef. This was really really good. It was soft and sugary.)\nMixed Vegetable Bihum Goreng Noodles (Just okay. We were full by then but the noodles weren't that great.)\nAromatic Rice (This blew the noodles out of the ballpark. So good! The rice had coconut flecks in it and was really flavorful. It went really well with the beef.)\nFried Banana (We opted for dessert here since there was nowhere really else to go. The bananas were kind of like doughnuts and we dipped them in powdered sugar. They were alright.)\n\nWe were stuffed after all of that. Borobudur is clean and nicely decorated. It was like a trip to the South Pacific. I'd definitely eat here again.", "author": "Rachel A."}

Dipping sauce was mmhh mmh good.\n\n-Udang Bakar Kecap were grilled marinated tiger prawn in smooth honey sauce.   Doesn't sound unique, but it's nothing like I've ever tasted before.  Simple, but done well.\n\n-Rendang is sumatra beef stew cooked with spices in coconut milk sauce.  O M G ...  OMG  ... O M G  this was super GOOD.  I loved this dish.  If  you're a beef stew type of person like me, this is a must.\n\n-Tumis Bayam Terasi Pedas  is sauteed spinach with tofu, tomato, & spicy shrimp paste.  This was also very good.  Cooked very well.  Flavors everywhere.  If you don't like asian fish sauce or shrimp paste, you may not like this though.\n \nDessert was KICK BUTT too!!!  Mixed tropical fruits with shave ice, condensed milk, chocolate & raspberry syrup.  It's call Es Campur and is similar to Philipino halo halo or the Vietnamese desserts with red bean and coconut milk.\n\nI would return again and again.

You know me, I'll try anything so count me in! \n\nWe arrived after the lunch rush at around 12:45. The place was full but people seemed to be finishing up so we didn't have to wait long for a table. Once seated, we perused the menu, each of us figuring out what the others were ordering so we wouldn't duplicate dishes. \n\nWe started out with the Roti Prata which was a warm, flaky bread that came with a delicious curry dipping sauce. So far so good. Then we waited. The restaurant was emptying out. One of the folks at my table received their lunch. Then we waited some more. Then another plate came out...then more waiting. What was going on here? Lucky me, I was the last one to get my dish, after much prodding of the staff & manager. We got a couple of \"Sorry\"s and \"It's coming right out\" while we waited. We figured it was about 30 minutes between the first dish coming out & the last dish. If this were a classy establishment, they might have brought out something for me to munch on while the rest of my table enjoyed their food. Or maybe they could have comped us a dessert or an appetizer or something. No dice. \n\nI really did like my food (sauteed string beans with dried shrimp & a side of coconut rice) but I can't say I'll ever be back.

It cost about $27 each. \n\nThe service was a little aloof and clueless. We had to remind our server about our waters and continually had to wave our hands for water refills. \n\nThe appetizer was a lumpia eggroll with a very nice peanut dipping sauce. It was well cooked, well seasoned, and overall a good start.  The soup was a lemongrass chicken soup with thin clear noodles, potatoes, and bean sprouts. I enjoyed the flavors, but it wasn't that great. \n\nThe entrees came with a BBQ chicken dish, stewed beef, curry chicken, chicken satay,  a tofu dish, and a \"salad\" with an extremely strong peanut dressing. I love peanut dressing, but the salad was way too much, and not that appetizing served cold. All the meat dishes were pretty good - slightly different flavors, tender cooked meat, and overall pleasant pairing with rice. The shrimp curry dish left a little to be desired; the sauce needed reducing. \n\nFor dessert, I had the black sweet rice with coconut sauce, and I loved it. Other people may not care for it, but I'm a huge sucker for sweet rice and coconut.

And from the looks of it, most of the tables had just sat down. We stood in the doorway for more than 5 mins. Not one of the 3 employees I saw greeted us. We waited patiently for those 5 mins. Just standing in the doorway, hoping to be noticed. I would have been fine with the subtle eye contact from one of the servers (this place has no host/ess) with a smile and the thought \"I see you standing there and I know you're waiting to be seated. I'll be right there.\" But nope, we didn't get that. It was almost as if they were trying to avoid looking at us as if saying \"if we don't look at them, maybe they'll leave...\" \n\nFinally we walked over to the only available table. A waiter was passing us so I said \"Do you mind if we sit here?\" And he barked \"HOLD ON!\"  Did you ever watch Martin? You know Sheneneh? Well... I almost wanted to bust a Sheneneh and bob my head and snap my fingers and say \"Oh no you din't....\" \n\nThe waiter breezed past us, seemingly angry. Eh... Whatever.. We sat down. He came over a few minutes later and put another place setting down for us, since our table only had one. He then slammed my fork and spoon down on the table... No idea why he was so angry.\n\nWe wait about 10 mins and no one ever comes to take our order. We finally flag down another one of the 3 servers. He was the saving grace for this restaurant. I think I've only walked out of a restaurant once. Working in food service has made me extremely patient and tolerant when it comes to dining out. But there's only so much incompetence I can take. When we flagged the other male server down, he was pleasant and kindly took our order. \n\nFor food we had:\n\n-Roti prata - Very good. Hot and flaky.

The meat was almost fall-off-the-bone tender. Very good. \n- Indonesian Iced Coffee  - Very similar to Vietnamese Iced Coffee, but not as strong and very flavorful. \n\nOverall the food was great!

Most plates were hits with a couple unfortunate misses. But overall it's a great spot. For starters we had the Siomay Ayam (chicken dumplings) and Roti Prata (bread and curry sauce), both were great!! The curry sauce with the Roti was delicious!!! For entrees we shared the Udang Bakar Cabe (shrimp on skewers), Rendang (beef stew), Kari Sayuran (veggies in coconut curry) and Bakmi Goreng (egg noodles with chicken). My absolute favorite were the shrimp skewers which had a honey glaze. It's more like an appetizer than an entree, but I wouldn't go back without ordering it. The veggies in coconut curry were just ok, but I loved the egg noodles and the Rendang. The Rendang is a normal beef stew but cooked in coconut milk, so the flavor is totally different. \n\nFor beverages there is a decent list of inexpensive wines, but since it was freezing out, we all had the hot ginger tea with honey which I could drink a gallon of!! It's delicious and has a little kick to it, but the honey balances out the spicy. \n\nOverall with tip we spent $23/person. It's a great cheap eats spot for a casual night out with friends. A group of 2 to 4 people is ideal because the place is pretty small. If you have more than 4 just make sure they seat you in the back where there's a little more room.", "author": "Kandace K."}

Yet Indonesian food is a much rarer find; luckily Borobudur serves up authentic dishes that will introduce you to new exciting dishes and satiate the hungry customer. \n\nMy companion and I shared the rijsttafel - a complete Indonesian rice table dinner for two (or essentially, a tasting menu). Dishes included Indonesian spring rolls, chicken lemongrass soup, coconut curry shrimp, BBQ-marinated chicken satay, and the peanut-laden gado gado salad. My favorite, however, was the beef rendang - beef stew tenderly marinated in coconut milk and spices. I've had this dish all over the world and this preparation nears the top of my list. The black sweet rice with coconut milk was also a good finish to the meal. \n\nThe food is hearty, delicious, and authentic.

Beef rendang is pretty good, tender and with delicious sauce, but ordering it once is probably enough for me.

Don't ask me what you should get because it honestly depends on your taste.  Indonesian cuisine is comparable to its more-famous-cousin Thai in the sense that there's quite a wide range of options.  You can have noodle soup, curry, pan-fried vegetables with meat or a rice dish.  OK, if you must ask what my favorite is that would be 'mie tek-tek' which is a spicy 'street vendor style' noodle.\n\nPrice.  Prices range between $10-$15.  You can eat till you're bloated here and it won't break the bank.\n\nService.  They've got a very good ratio of waiters to tables, and the waiters are always running around like bees around a beehive ... that helps!\n\nThere are a couple of downsides:\n\nNo bar.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-06-05", "description": "As far as Southeast Asian cuisine is concerned, Indonesian/Malaysian food is seriously underrepresented in the city. (There's no shortage of Thai and Vietnamese though!) For this reason, I really wanted to like Borobudur. Having been here on several occasions, I've been able to try most of the appetizers, both soups, two shrimp dishes, two beef dishes, the saut\u00e9ed garlic water spinach, the nasi goreng, three noodle dishes, and three desserts (see pictures). I was sad to find that nothing really wowed me, with the exception of two desserts. (I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so when dessert is the best part of the meal for me, it usually doesn't bode well for the savoury stuff!)\n\nOf all the appetizers I've had, the three that I would order again are the roti, martabak, and empek empek palembang. The ROTI (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=rzkH1HTiuaZLCdv8H4PGEw) is crispy on the outside with soft layers on the inside, but at $7.50 is pricey for what it is. The MARTABAK (beef or vegetables, egg, and onion in crispy dough; http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=CwZcbd0CfcsM3dar3N2rgg) is great paired with the pickled cucumbers it's served with and I loved the crispiness of the dough. The spicy vinegar in the EMPEK EMPEK PALEMBANG (fried fish cake filled with egg in spicy vinegar, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=3losVCZodB6IIJcb7H-hMA) is yummy and the dish comes with a small amount of vermicelli.\n\nAnother dish I think is worth repeating is the MIE TEK TEK, both stir fried (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=KvHtA3u3MX7cpA_4CcEBnw) and soup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=jMTY7M9VtzmSZ54qX_iqcA) versions. Both are flavourful and loaded with chicken and vegetables. While the coconut curry soup wasn't the best I've had, it's still worth a try. The other soups were also pretty good and I'll likely order them again (mostly because I can't find them anywhere else!), but I wouldn't repeat the beef or shrimp dishes I had.\n\nFor dessert, I love the BLACK SWEET RICE WITH COCONUT MILK and roti prata manis. The black sweet rice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=cK_5RuC3hkPcLwPc8GWsZg) has a chocolate-y flavour and the bits of sweet rice add texture. It's better served hot so be sure to ask them to heat it up (it was barely lukewarm both times I got it). The ROTI PRATA MANIS (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=5bmpGbzPd-gfcUl6o5j7FQ&select=imC4Q1hWGKXTcDqOE5aWAQ) is filled with condensed milk, ground peanut, chocolate, and cheese. Yup, you read that right - cheese. CHEDDAR cheese, to be exact (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=uLo6Zw-XuCaIIunwSg6YBQ). Some people top their apple pie with a slice of cheddar, so I suppose this isn't that out there. Surprisingly, this dish worked out amazingly. The cheddar wasn't too strong but added a hint of saltiness along with the peanuts to balance out the sweetness. It also added a creaminess to the dish. Paired with the crispy/chewy roti, this is hands down my favourite dish here.\n\nStay away from the fried banana though! Instead of a coating that is thin and crispy, it's thick, doughy, and mushy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=kNCzXgZ0JJxc98Y5uB0Q7A). Yuck!", "author": "Steph L."}

It was like a fried crepe that was crispy and chewey all at the same time. This was probably the best thing we ate. \n\nVeggie sampler plattter - Only good thing on this was the corn fritters. Skip the platter and just get the corn fritters. \n\nThen we did the Rijsttafel to get a sampling of various items on the menu in small portions. OVerall we were disapointed here as well. There was a shrimp curry dish that was decent but everything else was not so good. \n\nWhen we got the Rijsttafel the dishes were cold and we had to ask them to heat them up.

My feelings on the tempeh were more related to personal feelings then how it was prepared.  \n\nWe tried a few entrees a veggie rice plate which was tasty and beautiful.  It had 4 or 5 different types of things to eat so you were able to try different things.  We then had two main dishes, eggplant and tofu and something I forgot (oops).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-27", "description": "Went there recently for a friend's birthday and the large group really let me get a good sampling of different things on the menu. The only thing I was a little disappointed about was that even though I am Chinese, I was expecting to try some really exotic Indonesian flavors but everything seemed familiar to what I've had in Chinese, Malaysian or Singaporean cuisine. Not to say it wasn't delicious, I was just interested to try something new to my taste buds. \n\nAppetizers: \nCombo Satay- perfectly grilled, the chicken was tender and juicy, the beef was seasoned perfectly, the peanut sauce was creamy and yummy.\nLumpia - Egg roll was good but nothing special. I've had tastier lumpias in daly city Filipino dives.\nRoti Prata - Tasty and the dipping sauce was good- a blend of curry and spices.\n\nEntrees:\nRendang  - beef stew with coconut milk - the highlight of the evening in my eyes. The beef was super tender and flavorful and the broth was exceptional. I could eat four bowls of rice with this stuff.\nHoney Chicken - The meat falls off the bone. Best part was that it wasn't dry and..... the marinade penetrated into the flesh of the bird. Usually the skin and top part of chicken has good flavor but as you get towards the middle the flavor is not evident. Not so with this dish as you can taste the flavor on all of the meat.\nGrilled fish with Indonesian Salsa and tropical spices - the fish was perfectly cooked, and it was tasty, but the spices and salsa wasn't anything special. To me it was a dish I could make at home.\nSauteed veggies - ok I really wanted water spinach with shrimp paste but since it was out of season, the server suggested the sauteed veggies. Again it was cooked perfectly and seasoned right, but nothing special and something I could get at any Chinese restaurant in the Sunset.\n\nDrinks: So I ordered one of their special drinks called Es Teler, which as their menu states is \"mixed sweetened fruits with coconut milk & ice\". It was $4.50 and I would say a huge waste of money. They just basically put in some canned tropical fruit, canned jackfruit, canned coconut milk and ice and called it a day. Order the Thai iced tea or Indonesian ice coffee instead as those tasted much better.\n\nOverall I thought the food was good, around a 3.5, however the rendang pushed it up to a four for me. But for these prices I would rather just stick with the cheaper restaurants in the Sunset/Richmond area and probably won't be back unless it was someone else's choice.", "author": "Dom L."}

Soto Ayam - Lemon grass soup with bean sprouts, chicken, egg, and green onions. An excellent start to the meal. Just the perfect combination of ingredients to balance each other out. \n\n2. Lumpia Semarang - Fried spring rolls stuffed with chicken, carrots, tofu, and bamboo shoots. Cute appetizer. I would use the peanut sauce. Otherwise, the dish is a bit bland.\n\n3. Chicken Satay with peanut sauce - Wonderful dish. Chicken grilled to perfection. The sauce is not necessary but definitely provides a different taste experience and should be tried by all means.\n\n4. Sambal Goreng Daging - Beef stew in a chili sauce. This goes amazingly well with steamed rice. By far, my favorite dish of the evening. The extra kick of spice puts this item over the top.\n\n5. Bean cake with assorted vegetables - Apologies. I can't remember the name of the dish. Nevertheless, it was my least favorite dish. Let's not mention it again.\n\n6. Ayam Bakar Cabe - BBQ Chicken in a spicy chili sauce. The chicken by itself is fabulous. Very juicy and tender. When you add the sauce, my taste buds are overwhelmed with the different flavors. I recommend putting some sauce on coconut rice. This dish is up there with the beef stew (see #4).\n\n7. Kari Udang - Shrimp with assorted vegetables in a coconut sauce. Not too bad. Wasn't \"wow'ed\" by this dish as with the others but enjoyable nonetheless.\n\n8. I can't recall this dish very well. It was nothing to memorable...no pun intended. There were fish crackers/chips (similar to those served in Chinese restaurants) that went with fried pork (i think...) \n\n9. Vanilla ice cream - Pretty self explanatory. Ice cream was standard.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time here. Dishes were pretty much a hit or miss for me, with mostly hits! For $30 (including tip & tax), I feel this is a great bargain.

Service can be slow on some days, apparently, but it doesn't seem to be a terribly frequent problem. If you're tired of the run-of-the-mill Asian food that is so prevalent in this town--which is not to say that it's necessarily bad, just often uninspired--Borobodur has some surprises to offer. I especially liked the spicy squid and a delightful dish with tempeh, tofu, and green beans. Good options for vegetarians, though the food is not declaredly veg: many dishes contain non-vegetarian ingredients such as fish sauce, so do ask if it's important to you. The only true lapse I experienced here was a piece of plastic foil in the otherwise delectable black rice pudding; I wasn't charged for it but alas, it did dampen my enthusiasm to come back, at least for the time being.", "author": "Cult H."}

But frankly, even middle of the road Indonesian food will.  We were hungry, so went with quite a few dishes including the basics, to include Gado-gado, Nasi Goreng, Bayum Terasi, Kari Udang, and Rendang.  All were fine, even quite tasty, but again, if you've had Indonesian before, none of these dishes is likely to stand out.\n\nBut for the issues with service, discussed in so many other reviews, we might have tipped the scales and given them 4 stars.  Mind you, the waiter was very friendly and generally attentive.  But he was running all over the place.  What really irked us was that the many dishes were coming out piecemeal.  It took 30 minutes for us to finally get most of the dishes, and the Rendang - what we were looking forward to most - never came!  We had to ask for it as we'd finished everything else.  The waiter apologized, but at that point we were just ready to head back to the hotel.

I lived in Indonesia for four years, and went with my husband who is from Indonesia both times, so our standards were high. \n\nWe were not disappointed! Authentic, delicious, friendly, did I say delicious... this place is the place to go for Indonesian food away from home. YUM!!! The only downside is that the prices are of course much higher here than you would find them in Indonesia- we spent about $50 for a full meal, but it was WORTH IT!! \n\nThe Veggie Sampler Platter is a great combination of yummy fried tempe, tofu and bakwan (corn fritters), along with a perfectly spiced peanut dipping sauce. This combined with Nasi Uduk (coconut rice) and Tumis Bayam Bawang Putih (sauteed spinach with tofu and garlic) put my stomach and taste buds in Indonesian food heaven. The husband droolingly chowed down on Nasi Padang (a spicy Sumatran-style rice combination platter), which he said was \"Enak banget\" (really good). Not to mention a plate of Emping (which the restaurant calls bitter cracker- don't let that scare you away, it's actually not bitter, and has that nice salty crunch that anyone who truly loves Indonesian food needs in addition to the other flavors and consistencies). To drink, we went for Kopi Jawa (coffee with sweetened condensed milk)- you can't eat any good Indonesian food without savoring a true cup of Java. If we hadn't completely stuffed ourselves, we most definitely would have ordered an Es Cendol (sweet iced rice drink), and Pisang Bakar (roasted banana). \n\nOur waitress was sweet, helpful, and almost everyone else eating at the restaurant was Indonesian.

At least I was able to start off my meal with a Singha - this always makes me happy from the get-go. Note: the portions for food are very big here, so make sure you don't over order. We ended up getting two orders each of roti prata, chicken satay, nasi lemak, and mee goreng. This was MORE than enough for 7 of us. In fact, we could have just done with one order of the nasi lemak and chicken satay. I thought the roti prata was good, but not great. It was a little oily/heavy and we could have easily shared that one with the whole table too, actually. The chicken satay was not good, I would skip out. Nasi lemak was good, but it tasted a bit like regular fried rice and chicken -- it didn't have the Balinese flavor I was looking for. The mee goreng was the best thing by far, but it just felt like they added in a lot of spice to chow mein noodles. It wasn't like the mee goreng you'll find in Indonesia or Singapore.

Well, I am from Indonesia after all, but hey, I am not biased, k? ;p \nBorobudur is one of my favorite place to eat (when I am too lazy too cook). \n\nFor many, Indonesian food is similar to other Southeast Asian cuisine such as Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore, or even as far as India ('curry' dish is everywhere, isn't it?). However, to be fair, no cuisine from different country is exactly alike since different set of spices is used, thus giving the cuisine its unique flavor of that particular country. \n\nWhy I like Borobudur? The food, of course! Decor is minimal at best, but for a delicious treat, who would care? (as long as the place is clean) The staff is curteous, and eager to answer your inquiries on the food or what to order. Sometimes it may take a while for your order to come out. It is almost random ... well, if you understand the Indonesian term for \"rubber clock\" then perhaps you could understand this better. ^^;\n\nOk, about the food here (geez... finally.... ). You gotta know what to order (doh!) especially facing a menu with strange names you never even heard of, let alone pronounced it. \n\nFirst, to appease your stomach while waiting for the dishes to come out, I'd suggest ordering the Kerupuk Palembang, a big fish craker (it looks like thick white noodles and round in shape, you will see it displayed behind the register area). It is served with peanut sauce and sweet soy sauce. Other appetizer you may want to try is Otak-otak (don't ask what the name literally mean, ok? Trust me it is far from that ^^), and Lumpia Semarang (Indonesian version of spring roll). And remind the server to serve the drinks first, .\n\nOh right, the drinks! You got to try the Es Cendol (my fav!). It is tiny-tiny green colored jello made from rice flour served in a glass of palm sugar mixed with coconut milk. \n\nI like to start with Empek-Empek, which is a fried fish-cake with egg inside, served in a bowl of spicy-tangy dark color soup. Guaranteed to increase your appetite!\n\nAyam Kalasan is very popular in Indonesia, and Borobudur offers a mouthwatering version of it. For beef dish, I usually order Beef Rendang. It is soft and juicy and infused with spices and flavor. Beef satay? Hm... I would shift away from beef-on-a-stick, for simple reason, most of the time it will be either too dry, or too cooked, and too chewy. Just stick with the rendang. \n\nFor you spicy food lover, may I suggest Mie Tek-Tek? Be warned that their 'Mild' version of the this soupy dish is still considered quite spicy (even for me). I would order the 'dry' version because it is bearable (you can still taste other food you ordered after eating this) and easier to share with your table mates. \n\nWhen going there solo or you just don't feel like doing it 'family style' my suggestion is Mie Ayam (Chicken Noodle) or Nasi Uduk (fragrant rice).  \n\nAnd to close your dining adventure in Indonesian cuisine: I know this might be weird for a lot of people, but keep an open mind (or tongue) ok? For dessert, order the Pisang Bakar. It is grilled banana, served with cheese, chocolate and condensed milk (what the????? ;p ) Yup! you got it right ^^ \nIt is a strange combo or sweet-salty-fruity-chocolatey. It is a typical late-night snack for the young (and old) in Jakarta. (comfort food! mmmm.....)", "author": "Kat S."}

Since we didn't want to get tourist trapped I looked for the nearest public telephone (they do actually still exist) and was in luck to find a copy of the yellow pages still attached. A quick glance in the Restaurants section brought me to Borobudur: it was within a few blocks and better yet it was somewhere new.\n\nThis Inner Tenderloin ;) Indonesian restaurant is on a corner and at luchtime is bright with natural light. Having had rijsttafel in A'dam I was hot to try it again. Since it was lunch we ordered just one to share although we added extra soup and salad. We also ordered some emping (bitter crackers) for the hell of it (sounded interesting).\n\nSo here's the bottom line: the food was great but the service was a little slow although it did pick up as the meal went along. This is a great place to go for a leisurely lunch when you're not in a hurry.\n\nOne rijsttafel was more than enough for the two of us, especially with the added appetizers. The emping were crunchy fried crackers that were in fact quite bitter which wasn't so bad especially when munched along with the various dishes. The lumpia, soup and salad appetizers that came with the rijsttafel were tasty but the best was the little dishes served with the steamed rice as entrees. The Sate Ayma (B.B.Q. marinated chicken on skewers with peanut dressing) and Oseng-oseng Tahu Tempe (sauteed tofu and soybean cake in spicy sweet soy sauce) were especially yummy.\n\nDessert was included with the rijsttafel so instead of ice cream we had the Black Rice which is a type of sticky rice pudding topped with coconut milk and a sprig of mint. It was great--not too sweet but with a nutty sweet and salty flavor--although my friend ate a bite and grimaced (she doesn't like sweet and salty together or sweet bean stuff).\n\nOne of the best things about this place was that the people working there were sooo nice. The waitress said the restaurant really fills up for dinner but they do take reservations. We left Borobudur full and happy with our mouths tingling from new flavors and the hot chili sauce.", "author": "Nivek M."}

Then 4 years ago I went with my friend Vera who happens to be from Jakarta. Well I went to Jakarta and Bali this past fall and for some reason hadn't made it to Borobudur since I had been back. A friend & I had been talking about going here and so we finally made it this past week; coupled with some further reminiscencing I went again 2 days later. \n\nhere is my take-away:\n\nThe first visit on Wednesday we had:\n- Mie Tek Tek\n- Empek Palembang\n- Rendang w/ Nasi Uduk \n- Es Cendol \n\nThe Mie Tek Tek was not that spicy to us, but we both LOVE prik nam pla so go figure. However, the soup is dynamite. I will definitely be ordering it again.\nThe fish cakes (empek Palembang) were pretty good, but didn't stand out. \nThe Rendang beef is reallllllllllllly tender and very tasty and goes perfect w/ Nasi Uduk\nThe Es Cendol was very sweet and I liked it.\nThe service was not bad, and we didn't experience any crazy delay or lack of eye-contact.. I even threw out some of the bahasa that I knew and got some favorable smiles and reactions back from the server.\n\nFast forward to Friday..\n\nMy other friend is not so much into spicy stuff, so we skipped the Mie Tek Tek\n- Roti Prata \n- Nasi Goreng w/vegetables\n- Kari Sayuran\n- Es Cendol and Es Kelapa Muda\n\nThe Roti is very good but kinda oily. but who cares.. use a fork if you are that worried about your hands getting greasy (when I was in Jakarta there were several meals w/ my friends where they dont use utensils at all, so when in Rome, do as the Romans do).. but if u don't want the oily bread, skip it\nThe Nasi Goreng was definitely slamming!! then mix that with the Kari Sayuran ... ohh mannnn .. \nThe Kari Sayuran was good by itself, but I enjoyed it a lot w/ the nasi goreng dish\nThis time, the Es Cendol was just too sweet. I could only take a few sips of it and I was done. \nThis time, it was more crowded, but of course, it's Friday night, prime time dinner slot. They had 2 servers though, and there was really no delay.. so I think it's a hit or miss folks.. but I tried it twice in one week, and there was not the same shift of staff there.\n\nAll I could say at end of both meals.. \"Saya Kenyang!!\"  (I'm full)\n\nI really miss Indonesia and want to go back very badly.  Indonesian food  is some of the spiciest of any cuisine that I have eaten. Some other classic Indonesian dishes to try if you have never eaten Indo: Gadox2, Soto Ayam, Mie Goreng, Sop Buntut... ohh there is so much..

The decor is elegant, though not too fancy. The service was kind, gracious and our waiter even helpfully moved us to a booth when we ordered the Rijsttafel since we would need the extra space for all the dishes. The food? Really good. Of the five or so entrees we got to sample, I think one was shrimp, one was beef, one was chicken, so you got a good mix of meat and they all varied in levels of spiciness, with the hot ones having plenty of kick not entirely overpowering the complex combinations of flavors beneath the heat. The shrimp was probably my favorite, though you don't get that many, so I would order that next time if I don't opt for the sampler dinner.

The satay was juicy and grilled to perfection and the Roti Prata's fluffy, crispy texture and curry dipping sauce were absolute heaven! We also added on the Nasi Uduk (coconut steamed rice w/ lemon grass) which was off the charts.\n\nI was in awe of such outstanding dishes, however when it came time to dig into the main entrees, I was quickly disappointed. We had ordered the Mie Tek Tek noodle dish and the Sambal Goreng Udang shrimp & tofu dish, knowing that both would be spicy- which we both have high tolerances for, but I think I speak for us both in saying that the degree of spiciness for the 2 were insane! The spiciness masked both dishes of all flavor and left us both unsatisfied and reaching for our water/beer/soda between every couple bites to put the fire out. I was really hoping the whole meal would be satisfying, but this left a sour (or more like burnt) taste in our mouthes.\n\nMinus 1 star for the yucky tablecloth stain that was there when we sat down.\n\nService was fine, but just included the basics- take your order, refill your water, & bring your check, w/ nothing over the top.\n\nIf I am ever in the mood for Indonesian appetizers & some tasty coconut rice, I'll come back soley for those, but as far as everything else...

The sauce was supposed to be coconut milk based, but if it was it was not dominant. This dish was good, but nothing mindblowing. Could have used more flavor, although the beef was pretty tender and shreddy.\n\nNext up came the whole fried seabass. It was fried perfectly. I was hoping there would be more sauce though. It only came with a small side of sweet Indonesian soy sauce.  Tastey nonetheless.\n\nFinally the squid came out. It was stir fried with a sweet chili sauce. My buddy wasn't too fond of the sauce, but I thought it was the best sauce of the 3 dishes. The squid was very tender and perfectly cooked. Definitely my favorite dish.\n\nOverall the food was nice and enjoyable.

The first time my friend and I came in was about a month or so ago during the week and we had the eggplant and tofu, the grilled trout with Indonesian salsa, and the barbecued chicken. The eggplant was cooked perfectly (easy to screw up), the fish came whole and was scrumptious and had lots of meat on the bone, and the chicken was superb, tender, and full of flavor (this coming from someone who is extremely bored of eating chicken). We had very friendly service from the sweet older gentleman working there, and the young woman is nice too. \n\nI was surprised at how busy they were last night (almost a full restaurant at about 8 pm) because of how dead they were the first time we came in. This time we ordered the tender  sauteed spinach with garlic sauce and it reminded me so much of the tasty leafy green dishes  I used to eat growing up in Thailand. My friend and I cleaned the plate. We ordered the white sea bass this time and it wasn't as impressive as the trout and was rather dry and lacking the plumpness I would have expected. We also ordered the shrimp and veggies in curry which was very mild and not as flavorful as I would have hoped but still I wouldn't say it was disappointing, just not my favorite but still pretty tasty. And of course we ate all of this with the coconut rice, why would one ever order jasmine rice if coconut rice is available?!

This is understandable since the restaurant isn't that big and they're popular, esp on Friday nights, but usually if I make a reservation I expect to be seated maybe within 5-10 minutes. \n\nSecond is that their timing on the food needs some work.

I would've loved to enjoy the last dish that came out more but by that time I was stuffed. \n\nOther than that, we had some great food.....except their stir fried noodles can be  a little overly salty.

This garners \"the dirtier it is, the better it tastes\" motto for the food.  Ooo yeah, Indonesians... the people with stomach of steel.\n\nNow, Borobudur here is smart.  It takes the food of humble origin and slab on the gourmet label on it, and voila, you got yourself the $$ sign for price range (read: overpriced, big time).

Friends who have been to Borobudur, and who are knowledgeable in Indonesian food all proclaim it excellent. Try some of the more traditional dishes (ask your server for suggestions).

It was very hard to think highly of this place and just focus on the food when the service is so noticeably bad and lax, there doesn't seem to be anyone overseeing the waiting of tables and seating of people (in fact, a hostess here would be a god-send for this place IMHO),  they sat us at a temporary folding table with dirty linens, and there were two babies crying almost continually the whole time we were there.\n\nMy bf and I did enjoy some of the food - we had the veggie sampler platter (he's a vegetarian) and we both thought that the soy bean cake and tofu were really good. The sauce that came with it all really elevated what could've been really boring fried corn and tofu. This was followed by gado gado, a really yummy salad with a really great peanut dressing. We had coconut rice (which was lovely) with bakim goreng and the spicy eggplant dish. Indonesian food has many assertive flavors; going from extremely sweet to incredibly spicy. So, be careful when you order your food. When I began to eat the spicy eggplant, it was such a shock to me because everything before had been pretty sweet.

A spinach dish was only slightly abused, and passible.\nTwo curries had almost no curry flavor.  If there ever had been a spark of brightness in any of the ingredients before they reached our table, it had been clubbed lifeless.\nThe waiter had that racketeering condescension with which people who work in such places protect their self-pride--if the customers are willing to eat food this bad, they deserve what they get.\nBorobudur must rely on an unending stream of innocent tourists.  I can't imagine that any self-respecting local would eat here twice.", "author": "Jim S."}

That means I demand high quality from Indonesian restaurants and this is probably one of the best I've been to outside of Indonesia (contending w/Toko Rame in Artesia/Bellflower aka So Cal)\n3. I had a great time for a \"surprise\" occasion with friends (all of whom have been to the country and experienced the sensation that is Indonesian food)\n\nSo what did I have... well let me tell you that variety at this place was not lacking. I ended up ordering the otak2 (which is basically fish cake wrapped in banana leaves served w/peanut sauce) as an appetizer and the nasi rames dish, basically rice with chicken, beef, tempe (Indonesian soy cake thing) and a chili egg. I don't eat beef, so I passed that along to others but everything else was much like eating with family at home, minus the part where I have to pay. I also took the liberty of ordering cendol drink. The drink was a little too sweet for my liking, but other than that fine.\n\nSaturday night was busy, quite busy for any Indonesian restaurant I've tried to be honest! Which was a good thing, and plus it gave an excuse for slow service (if you have been to many Indonesian restaurants, you'll notice that service is slow no matter what! Yes even if the restaurant is empty!!). Price wise, this was the most expensive Indonesian restaurant I've seen, but I guess I'd pay more to get authentic food over something otherwise. The server was nice, and everyone had an enjoyable time, so it's not a place to be missed.", "author": "Yosie G."}

The other dishes were family-style, so we just decided to order from the menu.\n\nWe started off with the roti prata and deep-fried tofu.  The roti prata was delicious, but the sauce was watered down.  The tofu was in perfect bite-sized pieces and the peanut sauce that accompanied it was the perfect blend of sweet and nutty!  For dinner, we had the shrimp curry with vegetables, which was good, but a bit bland. They didn't ask about spice level, so I assumed it would be somewhat spicy, but it wasn't spicy at all!  We also had the string beans with shrimp paste, which had just the right amount of everything!  The dessert menu looked good, but we just didn't have room to try any of them.\n\nAs with most restaurants in this area. it's not a big restaurant, but they do have space for a group dinner.

Everywhere you go you're always bound to find some place you've never tried. I had never had Indonesian food until my friend helped me discover Borobudur! An experience of dining I will never forget. \n\nIndonesian food reminds me of Thai food, which some of the dishes are fairly similar. So if you like Thai, you will most likely like Indonesian. Infused with peanut sauces, spiciness here and there, and very flavorful meats! They offer a course meal which includes a good amount of dishes (appetizers, main plates including rice, plus dessert). Which runs roughly about $25 per person. Well worth it, until I realized how full I was. It was a lot of food for two, and the dessert was even amazing (a red bean rice with coconut milk..the right amount of salty and sweet put together in a bowl of creaminess!). \n\nThe waitress was very nice, and helpful. She even named off each plate as she brought them and answered any questions we had. The waiter with the water was awesome, and overwhelmingly refilled my cup with water constantly. \n\nThere was plenty of seating for a quiet and relaxing dinner.\n\nI had a great experience, and can't wait to return & share the yumminess of Indonesian food with my friends!\n\nP.S.

I would peer into the window, see a few diners inside; while never crowded or ever near capacity, seeing Asian patrons bode well of the restaurant's authenticity. Tonight I finally ventured in to satiate my curiosity. And I wasn't disappointed.\n\nGreeted warmly, we were seated in one of many booths that lined the perimeter of the restaurant. The room was aglow with candle light and made for a very pleasant evening meal. Glancing at the menu, our eyes widened at the first page - Rijsttafel. Unpronounceable, we still marveled at the list of foods included in their prix fix. For about $27, one can enjoy - lemongrass soup, fried spring roll, chicken satay in peanut sauce, cucumber salad with shrimp chips, stir fried tofu, beef rendang, bbq chicken in chili sauce, shrimp and vegetable curry, jasmine rice, and dessert. The food presentation was quite marvelous. The main dishes and rice came out in individual bowls atop of a long rectangular double deck tray, the bottom tray full of tea lights to keep the food warm while you eat. How cool is that?\n\n10 courses allowed us to get a taste of Indonesia. Favorite savory dishes from the set were the salad in peanut sauce (cool crisp, nutty flavor) and the fried tofu (slightly sweet and soft). The other dishes were good too but not necessarily extraordinary. The dessert of black rice with coconut milk (Burbur Ketan Hitam) was delish though. We couldn't get enough of the chewy rice, with the sweet milk. \n\nSo on top of all that food, we also sampled the Roti Prata ($7.50), which is a pan fried layered bread served with curry dipping sauce. Oooh sooo good. This was the biggest, flakiest roti I've had. We also ordered the Mie Tek Tek ($9.95), spicy stir fried noodles with chicken and vegetables. It comes extra spicy so be sure to ask them to temper it to your tastes buds. Would definitely order both of these dishes again.\n\nAll in all, a fabulous dining experience.

Not much energy, up there on Post street, its always so darn quiet in there.  But the service is nice and I like to order a bit in Bahasa Indonesia- because I love to speak food in many languages, I feel its my duty to know.  Engage me in any other subject and surely you will see me struggle, but my vocabulary seems to be filled with food terms from many languages.  Its pleasant to use them at times.\nI like the tempeh goreng here.  Simple nutty fried pieces of tempeh with a simple sweet chili dipping sauce.  The young jackfruit soup, nice and vegan, kind of watery but the jackfruit stands on its own to make a meal.  You certainly won't mistake it for Tom Yum.  I've had the roti here and its pleasant.

Fried noodles.. with egg, chicken, forgot the name . This was my favorite dish.. You can't really  mess up fried noodles. It was my comfort dish for the night.\n5. Lamb curry - My father enjoyed this dish. He said that the lamb was tender. I did not try this dish because I do not eat lamb. Most of the table enjoyed this dish\n6. Spicy Chicken - By far the worse dish! This was actually a rec from the waiter. It was just a big thigh/drum stick fried and smothered with some chili /syracha sauce. It appeared to be a safe dish they would rec to people that are trying Asian food for the first time. Mild and non offensive. Very very disspointed with this dish.  It was a dish you make at home with leftover chicken and just toss hot sauce on.\n7. Beef Stew- Rendang? I was really looking forward to this one becuase I have had it at another Indonesian restaurant before. The meat was very tender, but it was SO Salty!!!! I could not get over how salty it was.. it tasted like they poured ina whole cup of salt in it!!!!\n\nFor dessert we shared:\n\nFried Banana with Ice Cream -  I was expecting a crispy crust and soft banana inside.. it was dense and tasted like old oil.\n\nSweet sticky rice with coconut milk - I enjoyed the glutinous rice and combination of the coconut milk\n\nService was impeccable.. they were very attentive.. always filled our glasses full of water and cleared out the plates when we needed them to without asking. \n\nMaybe I ordered all the wrong dishes?

It is authentic, and I have the proof to back it up, since my roommate is Indonesian and he loves going there. I often order the spicy tofu and eggplant with chili sauce which is one of the most delicious dishes I have ever had in my life. I've gone with groups of friends multiple times so I've sampled many of the dishes and it's all good. The only negative thing is often they do not have enough servers when the restaurant is full and service can get glacially slow. But the excellent food makes up for it. Prices are reasonable for what you get. I'm a vegetarian but one of my meat eating friends said that the chicken egg rolls were amazing.", "author": "Eric v."}

One day, as we were BBQing in Dolores Park, I asked a good buddy of what her FAVORITE restaurant in the city was.  I expected the typical \"Oh, I dunno...there's a bunch\".  Instead, without hesitation, she mentioned it was an Indonesian restaurant around Civic Center.  \n\nMy interest was piqued. Indonesian food is my FAAAVORITE.  Mom and Grams cooked it all the time growing up, stuffed my face with it whenever we visited the fam in Jakarta, couldn't get enough of it when I went to school in Indonesia!  I've always been curious as to why Indonesian food has not reached the same level of popularity here in the US as Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese food.\n\nI took my family there when they came up to visit.  The verdict? \nGood ol' fashioned comfort food for the Southeast Asian-inclined! You could tell from all the Bahasa Indonesia being spoken around us that I wasn't alone in this sentiment. Throw in the cleanliness of the place and the friendly staff and it's definitely a winner in my book. \n\nThe Nasi Goreng Terasi Pedas (fried rice w/ spicy shrimp paste) is an absolute must! The Ayam Bakar Cabe (BBQ spicy chicken) is wonderfully tender and flavorful. Get the Empal Goreng (fried honey beef) for its sweetness and texture. The Capcai (mixed veggies) was okay, but I'd skip it next time. \n\nFor more discriminating palates (e.g. my parents), the dishes were simple but fairly authentic.  For me, a kid who's simply glad to be taken back to his childhood days, I am hooked!!!  I cannot recommend this place enough.  Come early!", "author": "Nathan I."}

The trout was a bit difficult to eat because of the number of bones; it was dry but pleasantly seasoned.  Lamb curry was served with small cubed potatoes; flavors were delicious but very, very mild.  Rice noodles were unmemorable but a large portion.  The sauteed soy bean cake was much stiffer than I would've imagined (not at all like tofu in texture); although I didn't enjoy it much I can imagine it being an acquired taste.\n\nIn general flavors were tasty but very, very mild.

It definitely isn't even on the same level as the Thai/Vietnamese coffees offered in the neighborhoods around here.\n\nCan't remember the name of the dish - but it's the noodle soup with chicken, vegetables, eggs, in a peanut-chicken broth. I think this is the day I came to understand the complexity of peanuts and the art of chicken stock. Let me just say that the first time I ate this dish was like a freakin revelation. I had no idea how a finely roasted and ground peanut paste can intensify and enhance without overpowering the taste of a sauce or a soup. What I tasted in this broth was a int of heat from chili, a faint sweetness from the peanut, a faint roasted/almost bitterness from the peanut, and savory salt; then there is the big, robust roasted scent and HUGE chicken flavor that was previously unrivaled by anything anywhere. Then there are the perfectly chewy wheat noodles swimming in this golden-colored broth. Perfectly cooked vegetables - peppers, onions and scrambled eggs. Juicy, poached, sliced chicken pieces, all white. AMAZING.\n\nI've had other dishes here, too. Great lumpia, although tiny and a bit dry, if there's any flaws at all. Dessert is OK, I'd bounce over to somewhere else. Great braised dishes including my favorite - the chili braised cubes of beef. SO DAMN GOOD. Tender as can be, spicy, just a great medly of this tomato/chili/coconut/lime/green onion flavor.

I like to cook and sometimes I catch myself thinking, I could make this recipe and do a better job of it.  In point, the corn fritters we had for appetizers.  The flavor was not lacking however the texture said \"I was fried, not well-drained, then microwaved\".  (Note, I did not see a microwave being used, this is only my way of explaining the chewiness of the texture, where one would expect crispy-chrunchitiness). \n\nMy friend had the No. 47, with chicken and shrimp, and while she was happy with the dish she did mention the noodles were a bit on the mushy side.  I tried her dish and while I didn't notice the texture being off I did detect a smokey/sweet flavor that I didn't care for.  I had the satay chicken skewers and they were fine - hard to screw up.  I did add some of the red pepper sauce to the peanut sauce because I wanted more spice.\n\nThe ambiance makes Borobudur a nice date spot and I think if I'd been more adventurous with my dinner choices I may have been pleasantly surprised.

I also tried the sate which was good and I ordered the Bakmi Goreng/ Bihun Goreng COmbination Noodle dish which was delicious. I would definitely order it again and recommend anyone to order it if they like noodle dishes. \nTHe reason why this place didn't get a 5 star was because of the dessert. We ordered a dessert because the bday girl wanted something similar to the dough in the Roti Prada.  So they made something with Hazelnut, Chocolate sprinkles and (don't laugh) cheddar cheese. It looked like the shredded cheddar cheese that you buy at safeway. We talked to the waiter about it and he said that it's similar to the dish in Indonesia but the dough was different. This was a big shock. So if you guys really want to stay here for dessert, stick to the traditional banana desserts instead.\nBottom line: I will definitely come back to this place as it's only a 5 block walk and it's right next to Pearls.", "author": "Nir B."}

I think they cheaped out and used the cheap cut of beef for this receipe, which really called for a tri tip or a more tender cut of meat.  Instead, they used a tough cheap cut of brisket or something or another.  And the meat was dry and stringy. \n\nOverall, this restaurant was a little bit of a touch and go for me.

That's \"dinner\" - - + S - which makes it plural.\nOn one night.\n \nAnd this is not the first time we did this.\nOne time, we did Bar Crudo, had a feast - - and then hit up House of Prime Rib.  No joke.  \n \nOn this particular evening -  he had just returned from a trip around the east coast of the US, but due to being in such high demand and such - - he had apparently not had a chance to eat spicy foods.  So starting from mid-afternoon, he began texting cuisines from most countries in Asia and even a couple from Europe.  We were getting nowhere - - quickly.  Finally - we settled on Indonesian food, which I haven't had in some 30 years since I last lived in Djakarta - reserving the option to throw in some Japanese food afterwards.\n \n\"SOME\" is a relative term.\n \nI had suggested a place called \"Indonesia Restaurant\" (so original) near my place - but reading Yelp, he found a more highly recommended place:  Borabudur, which is right on the adjacent block.\nOK.\n \nNo offense to Yelpers - - and not having tried the first restaurant yet, you still might be accurate - - but what's so great about this restaurant?\nSo many of you claimed their stuff was SO spicy - - - and of the 5 dishes we ordered - 3 were meant to be the spiciest they had based on their menu AND Yelp - - and only ONE was moderately spicy.  We had requested EXTRA spicy on all of them!\n \nForgive me for the abomination I am about to do on the names of the food:\n- Roti:  bread... more like croissants... but freakin' fabulous, oily, and if you look at it long enough, you begin to gain pounds right then and there.  Yeah, we shredded that thing to pieces.\n- Tempe:  Ever since living in Indonesia, I loved tempe and still do.  This place fries the stuff and hands it to you w/ a peanut sauce of some sort.  Forget the sauce, just devour it and savor the flavor of the fried soybeans.  I love, love Tempe!!\n- Bahk Mi: Now, from the days of living in Indonesia, I remember my FAVORITE dish as being something I called, \"BANH MI\".  Let me explain, in case one of you people actually know what I am talking about and can tell me where I can find this dish.  They were steamed noodles, wrapped up in a banana leaf that came delivered w/ a piping hot soup on the side, and you would unwrap your noodles, put in the soup, add tons of hot sauce - and eat like it's your last meal.  Even as a 5 year old, I could not get enough of this stuff.  It's like Indonesia Pho, on crack.  Anyone know the name of this or where I can find it?  Because what I ordered here was NOT IT.  It was a stir fried noodle of sort, too sticky and too gooey, served w/ a bowl of soup on the side.  Now that broth was similar to what I remember as \"banh mi\" - but those noodles?  Oh helllll no.\n- Shrimp Paste Fried Rice:  not too shabby.  It had a distinct stench to it - - but not too bad, and it dissipated w/ time.  In fact, we had most of this leftover so I got to bring it home, and when I had it the next day, most of the stench was gone and it was quite tasty.\n- Mie Tek Tek:  I think that's what it was called.  This was the only dish that was actually spicy.  Thick udon-type noodles, stir-fried.... loads of flavor and quite good, but frankly, it could have been even spicier.\n \nWe also had two beers - -  his was a Tiger Beer (Singapore) and I had some beer from Thailand that tasted like Korean beer.\n\nI found service to be a bit slow but quite friendly and all in all, good enough.  No complaints.\n \nI'm glad we tried Borabudur.  It's only 2 blocks from where I live, and I'd go here again for the tempe.  However, if I'm on a SPICY-KICK (which is every single day of my life) - - this is not the place.\n \nSo that was the end of dinner #1 for the night - - and while we had entered as two starving individuals, hunched over, and our stomach linings stuck to our backsides - - -we walked out stuffed to the gills, mumbling something about how on earth we'd eat more, while we walked our way to the next dining establishment:  SUSHI RIKA.", "author": "Grace K."}

Hunger got the better of us and we went inside of an eventful and tasty meal. We lucked out because they sat us next to two Indonesian women who gave us thumbs up and thumbs down on our menu decisions. For our apps we had Siomay Ayam(chicken dumplings) and Corn Fritters. The fritters were just OK but the dumplings were enjoyable. They look like Japanese Shu mai but the taste is definitely Indonesian. For dinner we chose a couple proteins and a rice dish  I love to pick items with long but vague descriptors so I went with the Shrimp served with  special spicy exotic sauce. After our table side friends approved my selection we ordered it and it did not disappoint. The shrimp were served butterflied on a skewer, shell on. The shell came off easily and the shrimp were cooked to tender perfection. It had just the right amount of heat for my spice sensitive friends, but I could have taken it full Indonesian strength! We also ordered Ayam Bakar Cabe (chicken in chili sauce) that was so tender you could pull it off the bone with your fork! I'm not sure where the chili works into the equation as it wasn't spicy at all but the quality of the dish supersedes the lack of spiciness in my opinion. The last thing we ordered was Nasi Uduk Lengkap which was  a suggestion of our Indonesian pals. This dish is unique as it is served as a deconstructed rice dish. We all took a piece of fried chicken, beef, tofu, shrimp cracker and coconut rice and dug in! Each element was cooked perfectly and each flavor complimented the next. \n  This is the first Indonesian spot (out side of Indonesia) that I have enjoyed the cuisine.

So I was really excited to experience Borobudor. But here are some tips to keep in mind if you are going to eat there: \nTip #1: If you are going there for lunch, YOU have to ask specifically for the lunch menu. It felt as though our waitress was trying to manipulate us into ordering from the dinner menu only, instead of the lunch menu (we got there 10 minutes after it opened for lunch). She tried to sum it up as a mistake, but everyone else who came in for lunch was only offered the dinner menu, not the lunch. \nTip #2: Look at your seat before you sit down, along with your silverware and tablecloth. No explanation needed.\nTip #3: Keep track of what your entr\u00e9e cost because it will conveniently cost more when you receive your tab. The originally prices had been crossed out and the \"new\" price of the entr\u00e9es were written on the menu, but when we received our bill it was much higher then what the menu quoted. When I brought it to her attention she said that they were in the process of changing their menus and prices. I told her that I would only pay what was quoted on the menu. \nI feel that their way of doing business is very shady. Even though the presentation of their food was beautiful - it doesn't always guarantee quality ingredients.", "author": "Priscilla S."}

Borobudur is a revelation for weary eaters craving a departure from the standard Thai and Vietnamese fares that have come to almost wholly represent Southeast Asian cookery for many of us simpletons. Flavors brought to our neck of the woods from this exotic archipelago of a thousand-plus islands offers cleaner, deeper, and subtly yet superbly more aromatic complexities to the palate than what we get at those greasy noodle haunts or even those chic bistros to satisfy our Southeast Asian hankerings. \n\nTasting this stuff for the first time at Borobudur sent pangs of regret that I hadn't explored the amazing spectrum of flavors that make up Indonesian cuisine sooner. Sweet, spicy, nutty, and floral, our dinner had us slurping, licking, and scraping down to our very last bites. The chicken lumpia started us off with perfectly fried little egg rolls that shattered cleanly like delicate glass at our bites containing tender, well-seasoned diced chicken and vegetables. Mie tek tek was satisfying and hearty with slices of chicken, chewy egg noodles and assorted vegetables swimming in an addicting peanutty-sweet-spicy broth that was hearty yet light at the same time. I had wanted to try the rendang but instead opted for Sambal Goreng Daging, pieces of beef stewed in a spicy, silky broth with al dente green beans and red peppers galore. To salve the absence of coconut from opting out of the rendang, we had an order of coconut rice, which packs a punch of an intensity previously known to my buds of coconut rice. \n\nEverything was delicious and eye-opening, albeit a bit sweet. I feel that this fare tries to put more of a direct focus on the sweetness instead of just using it as a foil to accentuate the saltiness of many savory dishes of other Asian cuisines, most of which, especially in restaurants, contain a lot more sugar than we'd like to think. What results at Borobudur out of this are flavors that start off as pleasantly mild and tunnel into a complexity that surprises and tantalizes.\n\nService, contrary to many reviews, was top-notch; we had multiple servers doting upon us and had a lovely dining experience. Out of this, I would suggest a late dinner at Borobudur to avoid the 7-8:30 dinner rush.\n\nI thank Borobudur for opening my eyes to territories previously unchartered in my mouth, but would like to date other restaurants (like, say the cheaper and closer Jayakarta in Berkeley) before entertaining any ideas of exclusivity.", "author": "Nuri K."}

So one day on a whim we decided to drive all the way to San Francisco from Fremont, and we went to Borobudur.\n\nIndonesian food takes pretty long to prepare, and since my girlfriend and I were planning on only staying for about an hour, she suggested that we called and ordered. We gave them our arrival time of 1pm, which is during the busy lunchtime, yet we were still accommodated.\n\nSo we ordered the Gado Gado, which is a warm salad consisting of steamed vegetables, tofu, eggs and shrimp crackers all mixed in a tasty peanut sauce. This is a great dish to get someone who doesn't usually eat vegetables to eat some because the way they prepare it is excellent. We also ordered the Ayam Bakar Cabe which is barbecued marinated spicy chicken with a red chili sauce. The inside of the chicken was a little dry, however, the flavor is unbelievably good. We also got Rendang, which is basically beef brisket cooked in a coconut milk sauce which plenty of spices. This was excellent as the flavor was present in the entire dish, not just the top layer. We also got the Gulai Kambing, which is Lamb cooked in a curry and coconut milk sauce. This was by far my favorite. The curry taste was not overpowering, the lamb, which is usually a strong tasting meat was not overpowering and the entire sauce goes very well with rice. And finally we got the Tumis Kangkung Terasi Pedas, which is just water spinach that has been cooked in a spicy shrimp paste and spicy chili. This totally beats the chinese style that is cooked in just msg and garlic. This is flavorful and for once I was able to finish my vegetables. For drinks we got the Es Teller which is just mixed fruits in a coconut milk and Es Kelapa Muda which is basically just Coconut milk. Both were very refreshing to go with the spicy Indonesian food. And finally for dessert my girlfriend had to order the Es Duren, which is an Indonesian layer cake, where according to my girlfriend, they bake one layer of cake at a time and then they pound it really thin, then they bake another layer and then pound that really thin and layer it again. I guess Indonesian people like food that takes absurdly long to prepare, but I definitely am not complaining =).\n\nOur total bill came out to be around 80 dollars; 100 dollars for 2 people including tip. Which is not so bad considering I had a lot of food left over and we got drinks and dessert. If your not looking to spend that much, I recommend trying their lunch specials.", "author": "Allan H."}

Not really authentic like the foods that you can eat in Indonesia, but I think it's because  Indonesian foods really need a lot of different spices, and maybe it's hard to find in the US. I recommend you to try pempek ( Indonesian fishcake... Really yummy ) and rendang!  Don't try their ayam goreng (fried chicken), because it's not Indonesian style of ayam goreng and it's taste weird. Honestly, I came to Borobudur to support people from my country to open more Indonesian restaurant and introduce Indonesian foods to people here in US, but my GREATEST DISAPPOINMENT of this restaurant is their BAD SERVICE. I've came twice, and every time I came I got really bad service. The waiter and waitress are not friendly at all. When we came, they just busy chit chat and didn't greet us or ask us to sit down. They also never asked us how was the food and didin't refill our water.  I wonder was it because they knew we are Indonesian and think that we won't give big tip OR their service are just BAD.

It is really SPICY. But at the same time, so tasty :D ask for meatballs! 3) Nasi goreng terasi ikan asin ( shrimp paste fried rice with salted fish) I love it.

Also save your stomach for prata manis (pancake with chocolate, cheese, condensed milk, and peanuts).

The restaurant recommends parking in a lot on a street one block down, but there's actually a small hidden lot behind the restaurant off Jones (Borobudur is at the corner of Jones and Post) that's quite convenient.  There were people waiting at the entrance, but I had made a reservation and got seated almost right away.  The ambiance was satisfactory if unremarkable.  I ordered the rijsttafel, which is a full course dinner that includes soto ayam (chicken soup), gado gado (salad), a shrimp dish, satay (meat on skewers), beef rendang, ayam panggang (chicken in a marinated coconut sauce), tempe (a soybean cake and tofu) and dessert (either ice cream or a sweet drink with jelly bits).  The dishes were served on various hot plates, and the food was very tasty, reminding me of home cooking I enjoyed with relatives in Surabaya and Jakarta.

We came here when we found out the other Indonesian restaurant down the block was closed on Tuesdays.  It was pretty empty when we walked in but was packed by the time we left.  The service was pretty quick for us and they were attentive.  We only ordered three dishes - roti, satay, and a beef stew.  The beef stew was spicy!!

The Rijsttafel is about ten courses and usually comes in little bowls so that you can taste a little bit of everything. The Lemon Grass soup wasn't that tasty (but I have this thing against hard boiled eggs, which they had chopped up in the soup). \nEverything else was great. The spring roll, Lumpia Semarang, was super good and had almost a barbecue flavor. I knew already that I loved Beef Rendang already, but I also found that I really liked the Tahu Balado, the fried tofu in chile sauce. And I don't know what was in the dessert (they said it was black rice with coconut milk), but it was super good as well: not super sweet, but just a somewhat sweet and a delicious end to the meal.\nOverall, it was super yummy and I will be back when I'm back in town.", "author": "Tina F."}

An old gentleman used be working here who was very friendly and I loved his good services.  Since I don't see him anymore, I still eat here because food is good, reasonable price and it nearby my apartment.  Few months ago, I had to wait my food about 45 minutes. It was Saturday night and it was packed. It seems like they forgot my order. Well, everybody made mistakes so I just let go. One night, I made a reservation for two but I still had to wait about half hour. I'm kind of upset because what reservation for it? But I don't want to try another restaurant to start over so I ate there. On another night, my friend and I didn't make a reservation, they told me to wait to half hour so we did. After we waited 45 minutes, two Caucasian ladies came and said they had a reservation. The owner of this restaurant served them right away. I complained what just happened but the owner keeps saying that they have a reservation. What about when I had a reservation? It was very unfair. So I haven't used this restaurant a little while until today. I decided to order TO GO. The lady told me I need to wait to 15 minutes. Only one family sit one table and a man came to the restaurant at same time with me.  There were only two customers and one group (4 persons). The restaurant was very slow today but I waited half hour for just two orders. I asked the lady about my food. She said \"Oh, one of our chefs was on break. Can you wait few more minutes?\" I said \"NO\". I can't believe they not start cooking yet. A man who came about same time with me, he already has his foods and eating. So I canceled my order. After they canceled my order, they had a bad attitude with me. How they treated me was unacceptable because it was their mistakes. It is so sad that a good restaurant turned into a bad restaurant.

There are a couple that we love so much, that we simply become extended family.  Well, the kind of extended family where they intimately know your odd eating habits and requests...and can pretty much order for you, but wouldn't know your name outside the restaurant. \n\nOut of all the loin gems, Borobudur is probably the one we go to most.  Partially from living in SE Asia for a few years has instilled a healthy craving for Indonesian spices, but mostly because when we feel like having a decent meal with lots of healthier (read not saturated with cooking oil and thick msg-filled sauces) veggie options, this is the place to go.  If you are vegetarian, you'll find lots of options here--even tempe for your protein.  \n\nWhat keeps us coming back is the consistency of the food and that it's one of the only Asian restaurants in the city--vegetarian places included, where you can get super-tasty, non-greasy, crisp vegetable dishes that are full on flavor and light on salt and heavy sauces.  Even their vegetable curry is delicate sheer and savory--not pummeled with an over-sugary thick sauce.  Service is sometimes slow, but always friendly.  \n\nMy Indonesian friend says it's not completely authentic but still really good.  Not being 100% authentic isn't an issue for us.  We come here because it's close to home, always friendly (at least the night crew) and it satisfies our cravings in a healthy affordable way.  And we can get a Tiger beer or decent glass of wine with dinner without breaking the bank.  Our favourites?  Hmmm.  Try the honey beef, honey chicken, beef rendang (of course), kang kong garlic, veggie curry, and an eggplant-tomato dish that has a slight Italian flavor (could be garlic with the tomato?) \n\nNote:  It's a great, affordable place to go with a group and eat family style.\n\nAlso note:  I was torn about whether to give 4 stars or 5.  I decided on 5 becuase it is pretty damned good for a restaurant in it's class.  And how could I give it any less if we frequent it so much?!", "author": "Nette J."}

But get this, I flagged him down THREEE times so he could take our order but all he did was do this thing with his hand, like shooing a fly out of his sight. CAN I SAY RUDE? Of course i completely understood that he was SUPER busy handling a restaurant of fifty people by being a host, taking orders, giving people their food, and being  a busboy all at once. For Fifty people. [I wouldn't be surprised if he was the cook.]\nSo i knew he CLEARLY had his hands full and wasnt going to be a b*tch about it. We ordered,waited another 20 mins for our food. Everytime we asked for water or refill on our hot tea we got a response like \"Okay, i'll be back\" Don't get me wrong the food is good (except the lemongrass soup) but no one wants to put up with a rude waiter who clearly cant handle a whole restaurant to himself, if they hired 2 more waiters  this place wouldn't be so bad. But our party was clearly frustrated since we didnt feel we deserved to pay him any tip since our bill came out to $90, for what? having to flag him down 10 times to get a simple glass of water? and we never got a refill on our hot tea or the Thai Ice tea that never came but we were double charged on our tab? All in all, we were there for two hours. we spent an hour trying to flag down our waiter,no kidding.\nThis restaurant is OVER-HYPED and WAY TOO OVERPRICED.", "author": "sarah p."}

I bring out-of-town guests here if they're Indo-food virgins. Love the beef rendang, the greens with shrimp paste, the roti, and all the other Indo staples. I think we'll revisit soon!", "author": "jennifer s."}

My mother is dutch and indonesian cuisine was pretty familiar growing up.  Theirs is pretty authentic and some years back the place used to be extremely inexpensive.  I'd recommend it and have always wanted to try Indonesia restaurant less than a block away but never seems be doing as good business as Borobudur.", "author": "Christian W."}

I am pretty sure that most every single dish coming out of their kitchen has one of these two ingredients. I was invited to eat at Borobudur with a few of my Malaysian friends (Malaysian food is similar to Indonesian food but lacks some of the spiciness). When most of us had arrived, we were seated at a table in the back, and began to order some dishes- we started with a few appetizers including the roti with curry dipping sauce as well as some fried corn cakes, steamed fish cakes, chicken satay, and lemon grass soup. While I cannot comment on the fish cakes, the roti was absolutely amazing. Lila was a decided convert to this new treat, and wouldn't shut up about how delicious it was for the good first part of the meal. Indeed, this flaky, airy, and twisted deep fried bread was most likely the highlight of our dinner; the curry dipping sauce a nice companion. Most of the other dishes had some kind of peanut/ coconut sauce so after a while I could not distinguish one from the other. The chicken satay tasted very similar to the Thai counterpart- and we also ordered an entire dish of chicken in this peanuty sauce served with a garnish of pickled cucumbers. After devouring the roti and some of the chicken dishes, I was feeling quite full but the more dishes kept appearing- a never ending feast! There was a nice vegetable dish which was described as a salad- sauted cabbage and carrots served in more peanut sauce and topped with light and airy crispy rice cakes as well as a tempeh and green been dish with a darker sauce. All were tasty, and all were consumed. The night wore on an we had probably been there for 3 hours, but the more dishes appeared. By the end of the night we were so stuffed we could not manage to finish the dessert- a coconut cream base with black glutinous rice- very similar to thai \"mango sticky rice\" but lacking the mango. The flavors were the same- sweet with a bit of salt. Overall Borobudur offers some delicious and rich Indonesian food (and coming from the Malaysians, quite authentic too). The service was a bit on the slow side, but if you are in good company with entertaining conversations, you will definitely be in for a treat.", "author": "Kate A."}

Super nice server, but it took 45 minutes + for the food to come out, at lunch with only 1/2 the tables filled.  The server was swamped running the register, and the tables.  The food was basic and Chinese tasting. We did not eat everything which is rare for us, and went away hungry. The fried rice was bland, the vegetable dish was really a pile of spinach stir fried with  a pepper thrown in. Maybe dinner is better with a different chef?", "author": "SomeWhereInTheWorld C."}

My favorite is the salted fish spicy fried rice (Nasi goreng pedas). Dont try it if you cannot handle spicy food. And for dessert - try the very richly flavored Indonesian layered cake - the Kueh Lapis. Service is great, atmosphere a little dimly lit but cosy.", "author": "Sajid B."}

It was okay.  One day I tried to go for lunch but the servers were really confused and not working efficiently, so I called for take out the next day.  I dunno - the reason I gave it three stars instead of two is that it really does taste like food one might get in Indonesia and maybe I was more up for something spicier like Thai...  could be me, not them.", "author": "Andrea P."}

If you are hungry and are in the neighborhood and don't feel like walking  or pondering too much, you can safely walk in here.

First and last time.Also first time I have been disappointed with a yelp pick.", "author": "terence r."}
