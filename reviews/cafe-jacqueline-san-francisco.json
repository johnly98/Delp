I can't recommend it enough. Both for the food and ambience. The souffl\u00e9s are UNBELIEVABLE.  We ordered the prosciutto and mushroom savory souffl\u00e9 and got both the chocolate souffl\u00e9 and the fresh fruit strawberry souffl\u00e9. We hadn't eaten all day to prepare our stomachs for this haha. Do not attempt the amount we ate if you aren't starving or if you don't have a sweet tooth. All of them were delicious. \n\nWe had felt confident that we would enjoy a good meal from reviews here but saw that most often the complaint was about bad service and long waits. That was not our experience. The waiters were extremely welcoming and friendly. As for the long wait times, you are eating at a restaurant that primarily serves souffl\u00e9s. If you aren't expecting a bit of a wait for your food then you are not familiar with what a souffl\u00e9 is. \n\nYou wont be disappointed by a meal here. \n\nThank you everyone at Cafe Jacqueline for helping to create such a wonderful experience and memory on our anniversary!", "author": "Katherine S."}

The neighborhood has retained its character in a world that is either depressing or cookie-cutter (or both).  Cafe Jacqueline is quintessentially San Francisco and North Beach.  I really enjoyed my experience here.\n\nThey do use a phone reservation system, which I didn't have any problem with.  The restaurant was even willing to be flexible and reschedule when my guest's flight changed.\n\nCafe Jacqueline is charmingly old school.  It's a tiny restaurant, with maybe around a dozen tables.  The ambiance is lovely.  It feels more formal than most SF restaurants, although honestly that's not saying much.  Most places in SF feel like eating in an Apple Store (lots of white and stainless steel).  This place has high ceilings, Victorian molding on the wall, dim lighting, white tablecloth etc.\n\nThe servers are friendly, but extremely professional.   As others have noted, the souffl\u00e9s take a while to come out (more than an hour.  The servers really try to make sure you get in your order right away to minimize the wait time.  \n\nWe knew when we came in that the souffl\u00e9s take more than an hour to prepare.  Part of the chef's vision is to have a small, intimate dining experience.   Given that, and the ample warnings about prep time, it feels cheap to talk about the wait.  That being said, we did wait a little more than 2 hours for our first souffl\u00e9 (the second came about a half hour later).  It might have been our fault, since we came around 750 when the last seating is really at 730.   2 hours is a little too long, particularly when you can't really order a salad or soup without it setting your main dish back even further.   \n\nI just don't have many friends - even foodies - who are willing to wait that long before having the first dish come out. It might be a better experience if we had an earlier dinner time, or came during the week .\n\nWe had a savory leek and mushroom souffl\u00e9 which was delicious.  The souffl\u00e9 was straight out of the oven, perfectly light with the right amount of veggies for a balanced flavor.  \n\nThe chocolate souffl\u00e9 was also very light -  not too sweet, and with an almost neutral tasting chocolate flavor.  Again very well balanced, but almost the opposite in profile from our savory choice.\n\nI'd love to come back and try the Grand Marnier souffl\u00e9.", "author": "Holly P."}

At the end of dinner - the waiters told us to go into the kitchen and meet Jacqueline. We told her we have been wanting to go there for 20 years and finally went for our anniversary. It was a truly romantic and memorable experience.....not hipster, not modern, not trendy or sleek.

I attempted to make a reservation a full week beforehand.  And it took a few days to hear back only to get a return call stating that there were no more reservations available. Another subsequent call let's me know that there is a reservation, and I confirm I want it. And yet another call comes to tell me that there is a reservation available. I attempt to confirm once again by leaving a couple voice messages that I had already confirmed. I don't get s confirmation until 30 minutes before my reservation that I'm informed that there is an available table for me. I was so frustrated from the repeated calls about how there's a table available I simply cancelled entirely.

It's hard to give four stars but meeting Jacqueline herself melted my heart. \n\nThis place would never survive in NYC. Cafe Jacqueline is a cute French bistro, off the beaten path. There are 10 tables, if they're doing 50 covers nightly, God Bless them.\n\nThe waiter who represents the front of the house or more importantly, the face of the business? I wanted to snap on him, such a pissy and unprofessional demeanor. My wife & I walk in and he asked if we have reservations. We do not (the place is half empty) he shakes his head and says, a typical dinner is over two hours. I'm the only waiter here so I'll do my best. Um what?! Here's a correct response: \nYou're first time here, great! Please be patient with us, our souffl\u00e9s take a while to prepare but are well worth the wait. Isn't that a nice way to get greeted? And being the only waiter, it's his restaurant! He should be all smiles as he's raking in the tips with no splits. Again, why be all pissy? \n\nI'm not going to wait hours for dinner. Our body clock is on NY time, My wife would be out of her mind. I figured, let me speed up the process and order a funky salad, French Onion soup and a Chocolate Souffl\u00e9. \n\nThe waiter comes over to take our drink orders. I said, we're simple and ready to order. He got pissy and said I'm not ready, you have to wait for me. Oh this guy.. I need to run everything. Ready? Put out a carafe of water on every table, no need to run around filling up glasses. Also, the butter was cold and hard to spread. It's your job to make sure it's not too cold for the guests. Or is that too hard and complex? \n\nI'm going to rate our meal from top to bottom:\n\nChocolate Souffl\u00e9:\nThis is the reason why we waited, once we took a bite everything else seemed secondary. I have never in my life had a souffl\u00e9 as light and airy being served at Cafe Jacqueline. And I was stationed in France!\n\nFrench Onion soup:\nThe soup was great but served boiling hot. Our waiter said it's going to be boiling hot so be careful. I'm not sure who's in charge of the soup but at midnight NYC time, I don't want deal with boiling soup. I waited for it to cool down.\n\nSpinach & Bacon salad:\nWhy so expensive? It's spinach. It's bacon. Mix them in a bowl? For $20 bucks, it wasn't worth the price. Also, waiter?? Give me a damn serving spoon...\n\nBeer:\nI was hoping for Jenlain, a French beer. Nope, I was served a Belgium beer imported from Canada.\n\nTo use the restroom, you must walk through the kitchen. Sure enough, there she is, the cutest little thing, Miss Jacqueline! She smiled at me. I told her I traveled from NY and made a special stop just to dine here. She smiled, asked me my name and said Merci! How can you get mad and give less than four Yelp stars? She's so welcoming and her souffl\u00e9 is award winning.\n\nMy waiter comes back from a smoke break (this guy is so annoying) and has pronoun trouble. How did \"we\" like our dinner? He think he also said did \"we\" rethink our order after I read the specials? What the heck is up with this guy? Dude, get another profession. \"We\" think your not worthy to work serving customers. \n\nIt was so nice to meet you Ms Jacqueline. Thank you again for the award winning souffl\u00e9", "author": "Bill S."}

It melts in your mouth. I can't even explain how delicious it was. One of the best meals I've ever had for sure.\n\nFor dessert, we had to go with the traditional chocolate. Another great choice; it did not disappoint.\n \nThis place has a lot of character. The waiters are all French men and the chef is one sole, elderly woman from France who was so sweet and makes the souffl\u00e9s to order. I saw her in the kitchen and said hi. This is such a good spot for dinner and not hyped up at all, surpringly!\n\n**edit to say they also have a great wine selection!", "author": "Mariam P."}

If you can figure out that it does exist, be sure to get a reservation or else you may find yourself out of luck for dinner.\nWe came here one Friday night at 7PM and were seated right away. The wait staff were extremely busy and seemed to do everything in increments like giving us our waters and then menus.\nAll at the same time, we ordered a shiitake, garlic and basil souffle, onion soup, and a lime souffle to be paired with a pear cider. The pear cider was the first thing to come out and the wait staff did a great job diligently filling our glasses through the night. The onion soup came out after about 20-30 minutes and it was delicious. I don't usually do French onion soup ever, but I was starving and it was good to have something to eat when I knew the souffles would take a while. Little did I know that it wouldn't be for another hour until our first souffle came out. By that time, my boyfriend and I were irritated and tired since we had worked all day, but the moment we ate the souffle, we were revitalized and joyful again. It was so delicious and flavorful, but soft and bouncy. Totally different from what I was expecting. We enjoyed it in peace and then about 30 minutes later, our lime souffle came out and OMG, that was so delicious. You just wouldn't understand the type of joy we had consuming it. It was enormous, too!\nThis dinner was different as it forced my boyfriend and I to slow down and enjoy each other's company instead of letting us leave within 30 minutes to an hour. My boyfriend was awed by Jacqueline, whom he saw working in the small kitchen and that was what kept him from actually getting angry at the slow pace. Jacqueline puts a lot of care into each souffle and you can tell that she does things in a steady pace as she makes do with the limitations of her kitchen, but this is better than having dozens of kitchen staff running about trying to feed hundreds of people. The atmosphere in the restaurant was calm and pleasant as everyone enjoyed the company of those around them. Everyone was at peace, which isn't always common at restaurants.\nThe service here was superb with the waiters being incredibly friendly and easy to talk to, despite them having to converse with so many people. If you want to slow down a bit and enjoy dinner with good company, Cafe Jacqueline is the place. The price is a bit high, but come on; there are so many places in the bay area that are so much more expensive than Cafe Jacqueline. My only real complaint is that it's impossible to schedule a reservation by phone. I called multiple times over the course of a week and left messages but not once have I ever gotten a call back. The only thing that worked was that my boyfriend walked in and asked to schedule a reservation. It's really frustrating to have the staff completely ignore messages and make the whole experience of reserving a table frustrating, but I did enjoy everything else so I only took away 1 star.", "author": "Jenn T."}

That said she knows what she's doing.  My uncle and I tried this place out last month and it didn't disappoint.  The first thing I'd like to mention is this place has so much personality.  The decor is quite understated.  I'm talking like one of the most bare bones establishments I've ever been in.  No ambient music, very dim.  This place must be more about the food than what I am used to. At one point in the night I had to use the little girl's room and funny thing you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the restroom.  I got to see Chef Jacqueline and give her a \"Bon jour\" to which she replied \"Bon soir\"  That made me happy.  I took 4 years of French in school and the only reason I remember how to ask where the restroom is is because of Saturday Night Live and Alec Baldwin.  I digress.  My uncle told me \"It's a typical San Francisco restroom.\"  I thought that was the most ridiculous statement I had ever heard.......until I got in there and OH MY GOD HE WAS RIGHT!  You'll know when you see it.  \n\nFirst.  We ordered 4 souffles and they take a long while so be prepared to wait like with most good things.  We ordered the crab souffle, white corn ginger and garlic souffle, chocolate souffle, and lemon souffle.  Maybe the wait was an hour and change.  I really don't remember.  Let me say this, if you are someone who is funny about eggs you should probably steer clear of this place.  If you have issues with texture stay away as well.  I for one love soft eggs so this place works for me.  I really love the corn souffle in that there isn't a big bold flavor to it.  The actual ingredients do the work, not the seasoning.  The same goes for the crab that was also stellar just to a lesser extent.  The egg acts as a blank canvas for the ingredients to be showcased on.  As for the dessert souffles get this THEY ARE RICH AS HELL.  Tread lightly.  I really liked the texture of the crispy crust versus the sweet soft filling.  \n\nEven though we were there for a while the wait staff was very attentive.  They weren't especially animated or outgoing.  This ain't the wait staff at Applebee's.  Not even close.  I was not put off by them though.  Extra credit for serving room temperature butter.  My biggest pet peeve is cold butter with me bread!  \"What am I supposed to do with this?!!!\"", "author": "Herman T."}

Really wish I could have Jacqueline's souffl\u00e9s for the rest of my life. The hubby and I are currently huge fans of the cauliflower and garlic souffl\u00e9. And as always the complimentary bread to start is perfectly warm and toasty to compliment the end of your onion soup. How is that onion soup vegetarian? I swear it's the BEST onion soup I've had in my life, better than Paris! Normally it would also be nice to have a half bottle of the saint emilion french red wine, but I am currently preggo. Still love the endive salad. So simple, fresh, and crisp with the light vinaigrette and Roquefort cheese to add some tangy creaminess (also something I'm not supposed to have, sigh). But for now I am happy just to eat the souffl\u00e9s and onion soup. Drooling and dreaming of the next time we come back. Merci madame Jacqueline!", "author": "Stine H."}

Quiet, great ambiance, and unpretentious.\n\nThis is not a place to come with kids, large groups, or to dine and dash. The meal will take about three hours, as each souffl\u00e9 is made to order by Jacqueline herself. \n\nWonderful wine menu, mostly French wines, of course. I recommend getting a salad or appetizer to start, as your entree will take about an hour. A nice but basic selection of simple salads and a few apps, as well as soup. The French onion soup looked yummy, but we opted for the butter lettuce salad dressed with a Dijon vinaigrette to save room for the star, the souffl\u00e9.\n\nEach souffl\u00e9 is large enough to share between 2-3 people. We had the lobster souffl\u00e9- it was phenomenal! For dessert, we shared the chocolate souffl\u00e9, which was divine!\n\nThe staff is super friendly but they don't hover, which I appreciate. It's a place to relax, enjoy, and have a good conversation over wonderful, lovingly prepared food. \n\nOh, and when you make your reservation, let them know ahead of time if you or someone in your party is a wheelchair user. There is one step up into the restaurant, and they have a little foldout ramp that they can bring out for you. It's good to give them a heads up so they are prepared. It is a space that is on the small side, so if you have a very large wheelchair or have several people with you in chairs, it might be a little challenging. However, talk to the restaurant. I am sure they can be more than accommodating.", "author": "Melissa M."}

However ... you really can't go wrong here! We also ordered a chocolate souffle for dessert and split it between the four of us. The dinner was very filling and perfect overall. \n\nDon't be in a rush when you go here, because Jacqueline herself makes every souffle herself and you will have to wait. Make sure you take a trip to the restroom, because you will have to go through the kitchen and see her in action with your own eyes.

I've been wanting to come ever since. The appeal of a woman run restaurant with two waiters and a sous chef, AND being at least 80 years old is too much to not go.  I mean you really have to admire someone who pours their life and soul into food when they could be retired. \n\nI made reservations only two weeks in advance so was able to get a 5 pm seating, since the restaurant is small and each meal take a good 3 hours reservations are definitely necessary. Located in north beach, parking is hard to find so park downtown at Sutter & Mason and walk. Or you could circle around to find parking. \n\nThe service here is fantastic, they are quick to check on you and the restaurant is super clean.  I wouldn't suggest going here on a first date or with acquaintances because it's more of an intimate restaurant.  Find someone to go with whom you can talk to for a few hours. \n\nWe ordered escargot, salmon asparagus souffle, and a lemon souffle for dessert. Each souffle takes about an hour to make.  The salmon asparagus souffle was amazing so light and fluffy and with delicious chunks of salmon and small pieces of asparagus. \n\nThe lemon souffle was super light and fluffy as well.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-09", "description": "My wife and I lived in North Beach for many years and whenever we would walk by Cafe Jacqueline, she would comment about how cute it was. Once we got married, I decided to make this our yearly anniversary spot and we have been coming here ever since. This is not an inexpensive restaurant, but the meal is at least 2-3 hours, and it is run by a small staff that has not changed since we began coming here. A duo of mustachioed waiters takes care of you, there is a busser who doubles as a dish washer, and Madame Jacqueline herself. The restaurant is simple, but elegant in fitting French country decor, with high ceilings and dimmed lighting, and maybe a total of 10 tables. Very intimate and very romantic.\n\nAs others have noted, Cafe Jacqueline is all about souffles! The way it works, is that you order your entire meal all at once, appetizers (highly recommend the French Onion Soup) along with a dinner souffle and desert souffle. Souffles take a LONG time to cook, so ordering both at the get-go is key. They usually have special seasonal souffles, as well as their regular menu of souffles. We've had the Fruits de Mer seafood seasonal and the chanterelle mushroom seasonals, as well as the Shiitake, basil and garlic and the tomato and cilantro souffles that are always on the menu.

After the only place that served souffl\u00e9s in my area went out of business, I went searching for a new place to get my souffl\u00e9 fix. After researching online, my family and I made a reservation to come here. Note that the restaurant doesn't open until evening, and the meal will take a good two to three hours, depending on your party size. However, it's all part of the experience, plus, souffl\u00e9s require time and skill to make. The restaurant has a fairly decent menu size, with both savory and sweet options. Savory options include spinach, prosciutto and mushroom, and shiitake, basil, and garlic. Dessert souffl\u00e9s include chocolate, Grand Marnier, and others. For a party of three, we usually order two savory and two sweet souffl\u00e9s. \n\nReservations are a must. You can absolutely just dine here for dessert, but I usually have my whole meal here. May as well go all out. It's definitely a place reserved for special occasion dinners.", "author": "Sarah W."}

Service was exceptional -- soft-handed, they answered our inquiries politely -- and yes, it was the most charming thing to walk via the kitchen to get to the restroom. Jacqueline was back there, making her souffles, and warmly responded when I thanked her for her delicious food. \n\nThe French Onion soup was the best I have ever had. The bread, wine selection, and souffles were exceptional. The lemon souffle -- omg !! \nThe amount is perfect for two people to split. \n\nAs the waiters & all reviews fairly point out, this is an experience - so you sit back and wait to be served. But it is a small place and therefore quite easy to hear each other. The music is kept at the perfect volume, and never are you startled by noises from the kitchen, or from other parties in the dining room. \n\nAt the end of our meal, the waiter wrapped up our leftovers without pretension (sometimes I feel as though fine restaurants sniff over that request). And when we thanked him for the food, he recommended we pop back into the kitchen to tell Jacqueline. Back there, we were met with a big smile, and she chatted with us for a few minutes in her charming accent.

And it's fame is well deserved for the consistent quality of these fluffy dishes prepared enough for 2. The same woman, Jacqueline Margulis, is the one preparing every single souffl\u00e9  by hand since 1979.

We would love to have you, but no food is fast here.\"\n.......(damnn)........\n\"Ok, sure\". \n\nWe ordered wine, then fresh baguettes and  melt-in-your-mouth butter is served. A French Bordeaux and a Pinot. I highly recommend the French Bordeaux. It has so much personality, full bodied, and paired so well with a savory souffl\u00e9.\n \nThe French onion soup took 20-30min. The souffl\u00e9 took about an hr. We got lucky coming in at the right time, the waiter says, but don't expect it to come out this quickly next time he warns. He serves it and it's death by souffl\u00e9... Mmmmmm... Creamy, perfect, and savory but delicate as expected... It was worth the wait!\n\nFrom the intimate ambience, the impeccable service, the quality of the food... It's something you have to try at least once. The crowd is a more mature, well dressed group-The well polished type, sporting fun glasses. The waiters are well mannered, who seemingly take pride in their job.  \n\nI'm hoping someone will make a documentary on this place, because these kinds of restaurants rarely exist in the states.

It's small and intimate without being stuffy or pretentious. And I'm sorry, but if the smell of souffl\u00e9s baking doesn't warm your heart, you're already dead inside and you can kindly leave, thank you.\n\nWe ordered onion soup to tide us over while our savory souffl\u00e9, the fruits de mer, baked. We chose fresh strawberries as our sweet, then dug our spoons into that hot layer of melted gruy\u00e8re in the soup ... I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that it's probably hard to make a bad French onion soup. Maybe? In any case, Jacqueline's more than did the job of keeping us happy until the seafood medley in baked eggs joined us.\n\nWe got a bottle of Gigondas, too, which didn't detract.\n\nMeanwhile, being so comfortable, we lost track of time while we drank wine and talked. Good thing, too, because souffl\u00e9s are like the polar opposite of fast food. As it should be.\n\nAfter waiting a few minutes for the souffl\u00e9 to cool, we each dug in, doing what we could to pick up bits of prawn and/or scallop along with crispy crust and soft, hot center. My effing god, the flavor, temperature, and texture were all mind-blowing. After that first bite, I was already sad that at some point, we would have eaten the whole thing. I wanted to eat that souffl\u00e9 until end times.\n\nWe sadly, and with much regret, indeed finished our savory, knowing that the sweet would soon arrive to dull the pain. Okay, imagine the freshest strawberries topped lightly with powdered sugar, all sitting on top of an expertly cooked, sweetened souffl\u00e9. I'm not always keen on sweets and desserts. But coupled with a coffee, Jacqueline's sweet souffl\u00e9 perfectly completed what would've already been an amazing experience.\n\nWe went into the kitchen before we left so we could thank this amazing woman who has been working her craft since 1979. She thanked us, mostly in French, and I knew that it was a night I would remember for the rest of my life.\n\nSeriously, the only thing missing with this place and my experience there is that it's *not* in Paris.

Now perhaps my American tongue is doing a disservice to our French Allies here. However, since starting my journey for the best French Onion soup, I have had many bowls in many places and this was not one that stood out. Again I may be Impermeable to the genuine French taste evoked by our sweet chef. Alas the reason for my dissent is as follows.\n\nThe soup simply tasted as the most saltiest broth to ever hit my pallet. The cheese was not of the traditional stringy and creamy variety, but rather a gummy \"Goyard\" cheese. \n\nThe Strawberry Souffl\u00e9 had delicious strawberries, but after that the rest was actually pretty bland, and again not trying to sound unsophisticated, but we were hungry and yeah not blown away by the flavor.\n\nMy biggest criticism is simply that the flavor of the experience did not justify the price. There is an expectation where when you pay for $80+ worth of food you are going to get an awesome experience and that was not the experience here. The souffl\u00e9 should be priced $30 and the soup at $12 not $45 and $18.

The servers don't look like they spent a day chopping wood and styling their beards. The cafe doesn't dwell in artisan craft brews or cocktails made from 20\ningredients that you've never heard of. The place feels like it has lived in a time capsule and is perhaps one table too crowded, but this matters not one bit.\n\nCafe Jacqueline pulls one punch - handmade entree and dessert souffl\u00e9s to order that are impeccable. The menu offers a handful of h'ordeurves, salads and soups to enhance the meal (the French onion soup is as good as it gets), but the focus are the sweet and savory cloudy creations of Chef Jacqueline Margulis, who can still be seen whisking eggs in the kitchen nearly 40 years after opening her establishment.\n\nMake note, much of the negative marks presented in other reviews expose the diners' ignorance to souffl\u00e9 process and quality. Complaints that the souffl\u00e9s take too long - handmade to order, one at a time - are unwarranted. They do take long - up to 45 minutes for savory, 30 for dessert - but this is par for the course when you're receiving a made-from-scratch souffl\u00e9. These aren't prepped by line cooks. Each is made by the owner who executes every step of the process herself. You can watch her work as you pass through the kitchen on the way to the restroom. That some of the dessert souffl\u00e9s are runny in their centers is a desired quality - it's not undercooked. The dessert souffl\u00e9 is self-saucing. Lap up the sweet sauce with the baked portion - it's divine, not an error.\n\nI don't advise stopping by Jacqueline on a whim. Even if you order dessert, it won't be an in and out experience. Time is supposed to stop here and focus is turned to the incomparable, yet simply presented souffl\u00e9s and hopefully good company you're with.\n\nService will seem slow by comparison to restaurants that design their experiences to be 2 hours or less, but you quickly realize these guys are skillfully pacing a timeless dining experience that is supporting the work their chef is doing in the kitchen. I only deducted one star from my score due to coffee/tea not being offered until after or dessert souffl\u00e9s on the table, leaving us with completely empty table - we'd declined further glasses of wine - for the 25-30 minutes we waited for dessert. A cup of coffee/tea would've bridged the expected wait nicely.\n\nIn a city overrun with talented chefs and creative dishes, this old school gem still deserves to be called original. I'd imagine that when Jacqueline retires, she will close her establishment rather than pass it on. She has to be approaching this time. Don't miss out on a truly unique and historically significant San Francisco culinary experience.", "author": "Charley C."}

This was one of Steve Job's favorite restaurants... and now I see why. \n\nThe chef, owner, grand dame of souffle chefs, Jacqueline herself is a passionate lady who dedicated her entire life to making souffles. It's that like documentary Jiro, except, it's a woman who makes souffles... \n\nShe is there every night and only has one person washing dishes, another prepping food, two waiters, and herself making the food. Talk about loving what you do... she could have easily had an apprentice or paid someone to take over some nights, but she didn't. This restaurant is definitely not under any financial monopoly because it's almost always a full house. Jacqueline doesn't own an electric mixer, she beats those eggs manually herself every night... have you ever tried to whip up cream with a whisk? Exhausting right?! Not for Jacqueline. It's very admirable how rigid she is with her practice. She refuses to have an electric egg beater or hire anyone to beat the eggs.\n\nTips: Call and make reservations ahead of time. If you want to walk in and dine then do so on a weekday, the earlier the better- they open at 5:30. If you plan on having appetizers, mains, and dessert then prepare to have a long dinner up to 3 hours. Parking is tricky so make sure you give yourself ample amount of time to hunt for a spot and walk. Cash and credit is accepted. Souffles are large and big enough for two or three people. Ideal date night spot. Steve Jobs had his bachelor party here and ordered souffles all night long.\n\nI absolutely love her FRENCH ONION SOUP, it is perfection. The Grand Mernier is my favorite souffl\u00e9... all the souffles are delicious, however this is the most delicious one! and remember to thank Madame Jaqueline before you leave the restaurant! If you want to be fancy and say something in French say \"tout va bien, merci beaucoup! Bonne Nuit\" (toot va bien, mercy boo-coo! Bon newie).\n\nGetting a bottle of wine is rather reasonable, they have bottles starting at $25, she stays true to French table wine standards.\n\nIt kind of scares me to think what will happen to this restaurant once she retires if ever... At that point in time would she decide to train others and have them take over? Would it just close? All I'm really concerned with is when I'm going to visit next.

Was it the best french onion soup I've ever had, yes; but I don't think it's $15 dollars good. Another example is a can of coke. Yes, there is a mark up at any restaurant so go ahead and charge $2 or even $3 but no, they charge $5 here.  Souffles are not as common so price point is hard to gauge. We had a mushroom and leek savory souffle for $35 (portion for two). It tasted like an omelet. For dessert we had the strawberry souffle for $40 (portion for two). It came undercooked so it was still watery in the center. We didn't say anything since it took over an hour to come out, we didn't want them to make another one and for us to wait another hour. The flavor however was great. I would come back for dessert if I had over an hour to spare.\n\nI called to reserve, they didn't pick up so I left a message. They called me back in a few hours and confirmed. I mentioned to them that we are celebrating a birthday. They said \"all we do is stick a candle in it\". I said ok. The day that we dined there, the dessert came out without a candle.\n\nService was good but they could not help us when we could not decide what to order. They said everything on the menu is good. So we asked if there were any more popular items, they said they are all popular. \n\nI say order what you usually like. For example, if you like mushrooms, order the mushroom souffle. The base of every souffle essentially are the same.  \n\nOur entire meal took 2.5 hours. Be prepared to wait for your food and pay a lot for it.", "author": "Andy W."}

Nice crusty exterior with good chew.\n-French Onion Soup: Usually not a fan of French onion soup, but this may have converted me. The soup was served piping hot and so delicious. Definitely get this!\n-Chanterelle Mushroom & Garlic Souffl\u00e9 (special that day): First thought: These souffles are huge! It was my first time having a savory souffl\u00e9 and it was delicious!

It's that good.\n-Chocolate Souffl\u00e9: Really good. Nice chocolate flavor, but if I had to choose just one, I'd go with Grand Marnier.\n-House coffee: Both regular and decaf coffee with our dessert souffl\u00e9s went perfectly together.\n\nSERVICE:\nExcellent service. We had a great time with the waiter who helped us. \n\nTIPS:\nDefinitely get reservations ahead of time since I saw some people turned away at the door when they tried to do a drop in. Seatings are only at 5:30 pm or 8 pm since souffl\u00e9s take time to prepare! Go with a few friends and take the time to chat and catch-up while you wait for the souffl\u00e9s.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-11", "description": "I had great expectations as i went but they were totally unwarranted. The place is really elegant, and might be ideal for a romantic getaway and intimate soiree, though i would not recommend it for big groups since the indoors is not that spacious and it might be a little hard to swing a table for a bigger one as well. Of course the souffles are somehow famed and i wanted to definitely try them.\n\nOnion soup might be your appetizer to go, which also goes well with the french bread they bring at the beginning. They also bring you a tasty butter that is a good accompaniment, but for the pricetag, i am not sure it is that superior or exceptional. I have to give to Jacqueline though, the place feels and tastes genuinely french not somehow americanized and feels definitely old school.\n\nSalads are also a good bet, especially the one with spinach and bacon is really tasty. \n\nSouffles will be your next meals. They are pricy and not that big. You might be a fan of seafood so get the fruits de mer which is one of the best thing they make among the souffles, and it is definitely tasty. Though for the price again, i am not sure it is worth it. \n\nSpinach or tomato souffles might be better for vegeterians and those who don't enjoy seafood. Chanterelle mushroom one looked good when the next table ordered it but i am definitely skeptic about how the prosciutto complements the taste, cause it kinda seemed a little bit disintegrated/hanging over the thing just like that.\n\nDessert. Well that is a lot of souffle but i still would go with the strawberry or the berry one instead of the acridy lemon souffle or the mushy chocolate one, which one the biggest disappointment of the night. Beware the plates, they are scorching hot.\n\nThey also have nice reds to sip with your meal which i feel is essential as this is a french place that gets as french as it could. But i have to repeat, the place is really squeezed somehow and that romantic atmosphere can be a little too crowded to tolerate, especially when you consider the fame the place has built itself which causes every single table to be filled.\n\nPeople are not rude, that is a plus, especially when you consider the price!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-09-16", "description": "This is one of the toughest reviews I've had to write simply because it's souffle.  But I'm honest and I'll call it how I saw it.\n\nRule #1: Call head and make a reservation because this place is super small (in other words, don't start bitching when you try to walk in and find that the wait is enormously long).  In fact, just call days ahead and leave a message, because that's how I got my reservation squared away quickly and painlessly.  Might not matter as much for a 6:30 PM reservation, but 8 PM?  Yeah, might want to make sure of that.\n\nRule #2: Make sure you go with people that you enjoy the company of, because the wait for your food is long...EXCRUCIATINGLY long.  I understand it's souffle, and it's not going to be quick to make souffles.  That said, it does take a long time and there's really no way around it.  I try to make a rule about not eating too much bread before the food gets there because I want to save my stomach for the main event.  But when you're hungry and it takes over an hour to bring out the souffles, rules tend to be broken.  And of course you can't just sit there twiddling your thumbs waiting for your food in the meantime.  So practice those conversation skills, you'll need them.\n\nRule #3: Go to the bathroom at least once so you can see Jacqueline at work.  It's in the back of the restaurant, and you have to pass through the kitchen to get there.  \n\nThe food itself varied from underwhelming to amazing for me, so here's the rundown:\n\nCucumber Salad: Not bad, appreciated how thinly sliced the salad was.  Quite refreshing and very light, but personally wouldn't have gotten it.\n\nFrench Onion Soup: Rare is the occasion that I get to try to french onion soup, so when I saw it on the menu no decision had to be made.  Phenomenally good soup.  Not too salty, perfect blend of cheese and croutons.  Definitely worth getting, and quite necessary given how long the wait for souffles is.\n\nProsciutto and Mushroom Souffle: Very fluffy, but too salty for my preference.  Probably because of the prosciutto, but still.  Given that this was my call, I was disappointed.  Not my favorite for sure.\n\nSeafood Souffle: Definitely the better savory souffle I tried.  Nowhere near as salty as the prosciutto souffle.  The scallops blended well with the fluffiness of the souffle.  Worth the $53, although I'd probably want to try the other ones first before anointing automatic repeat status.\n\nPeach Souffle: Easily the best thing I had all evening.  When I think souffle, I think sweet and sugary, and this peach souffle delivered on all counts.  Not TOO sugary to overload the senses, but the right combination of peachy and sweet flavor.  This is worth having dreams at night about.\n\nLast notes:\n\nThe souffles are surprisingly very massive.  One savory souffle and one dessert souffle will unquestionably be more than enough to fill up two people.  And when you're all done, you've probably ended up spending 3 hours here.  Long, long dinner, but with the right person (or persons), it's time well spent.", "author": "Alexander Y."}

We shared a French onion soup which was buttery and hot to perfection and for dessert the seasonal strawberry souffl\u00e9.

Specializing in souffles, it's long been a favorite as a date spot and for those intimate meals. \n\nWe first tried Jacqueline years ago and were excited to return again. In some ways, the place has not changed.  It's still small and charming.  The menu is essentially soups, savory souffles and dessert souffles. \n\nOther areas are less appealing. Although they aren't quite as busy as they used to be, reservations are still a phone call, leave a message, and call back.  They don't answer during the day and the call backs can happen up to a week later.  \n\nService was a little bit more perfunctory than I recall and despite not having several options (prosciutto and mushroom, several drink selections), the waiter tells you they don't have any and proceeds to leave as you decide only to come back minutes later.  This was with a mostly empty restaurant.  Our final order:\n\nFrench Onion Soup - absolutely delicious. Piping hot, gooey rich cheese and fantastic broth flavor.  It was a touch salty. \n\nShiitake, garlic, basil souffle - all the souffles and all food, even the soup, takes time.  This isn't a quick in and out place.  The souffle was delicious but admittedly salty, even more so the soup. We drank water constantly through the meal. \n\nWhite Chocolate Souffle - the highlight.  The dessert was perfect.  Not too sweet and super light and fluffy. \n\nCafe Jacqueline is a great choice for souffle fans.  The perfunctory service, long waits, and salty food though perhaps explain why the crowds are not quite as prominent as they were a few years ago. \n\nCafe Jacqueline accepts credit cards including American Express.", "author": "Randy F."}

This would for a nice courtesy wouldn't you say?  So  much for outstanding service for the outstanding prices, crinkly paper menu, 15 year old dusty fake flowers in the window, a door full of ugly stickers which are such an eyesore (a well-esteemed eatery in S.F. would never clutter their door or window with these ugly pasties). When you wait for so long you notice the cruddy look of the place such as the dirty worn door frame and unattractive bathroom. The place could really use a do-over....too much competition in S.F.\nPrices are a king's ransom for what you get, (such as well over $10. for a little spinch with a few bacon bits and pine nuts) and the  food is not as memorable as the high price.", "author": "Claudia K."}

Take your time with salad, soup, wine, a savory souffle for dinner and a sweet one for dessert. It's an intimate, low-key, candlelit place. Be sure to visit the ladies' room, as that includes a walk past the venerable chef, Jacqueline, in her element--wearing a white chef's hat over her white hair, and reaching her beautiful aged hands into a hanging wire basket of eggs to begin her magic. She personally makes every souffle that is consumed in this place, which is why there are only about 10 small tables. Call for reservations. I ask to go here every year on our anniversary.

The waiters assured the us that the $40 escargot dish was incredible.  It was an average preparation.  At 11 pm two totally burnt souffl\u00e9s arrived.   We should have sent them back, but by this time we were ravenous.     Sometime after midnight the lemon souffl\u00e9  arrived.    I should say the lemon soup arrived.  There was nothing souffl\u00e9-like about it    At 1 AM  we finished our meal. We're not slow eaters.  We suffered  insanely slow and bad service.   Am sure the waiters wondered how we could have put up with this bad act.    We shouldn't have, but did.  \n\nWhat's incredible about this, aside for the fact that we put up with this awful experience,  was that we had the same exact experience the last time we went there, 10 years ago.

First off parking is a nightmare in North Beach, so you are probably better off finding a garage you can park at.  Second, if you end up ordering several courses - it can take up to two hours easily.  Well, they are souffles and they are made from scratch.\n\nWhen I see French Onion Soup on a menu, I say \"Yes\" immediately.  Theirs was exceptional.  Again, not a normal bowl of soup - it came piping hot out of the oven and took about 20 minutes - but was worth the wait.  (Yelp lists this at $10.50.  It is actually $15.00).  \n\nThe main course souffles feed two people each - so be prepared to team up with someone at the table and/or be willing to share.  Since I was in \"Yes\" mode, I ended up having the prosciutto and mushroom souffle - even though personally I am not a huge fan of prosciutto.  It was still really good!\n\nDessert - the table split the Lemon and Chocolate.  Warning - be CAREFUL when you eat the dessert souffles!  It's easy to inhale the powdered sugar they are topped with - and the flakes go right to the back of your throat if you aren't watching out.  COUGH- COUGH! \n\nThink of this place as a \"special night out\".  A place where you take a date on an anniversary?  It might even pass as a unique spot for a marriage proposal.  Just hope that they end up saying \"Yes\"!", "author": "Christian H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-02", "description": "Jacqueline is the sweetest, cutest, little old French grandma I've ever met! She lovingly hand makes every souffl\u00e9 that come out of her kitchen, often meaning that there really is only probably one seating per night here. You can say bonjour to her as you walk through the kitchen on your way to the bathroom, and she will greet with you a beautiful smile and a nod and a wave.\n\nMy friends and I came here for a birthday dinner (three of our birthdays are within 13 days of each other). Cafe Jacqueline is a small and romantic restaurant tucked into a crowded street in North Beach with no street sign - only the name written across its windows.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n- soup du jour - leek and celery soup - perfectly seasoned with a nice thick texture\n- French onion soup - the absolute BEST French onion soup I've ever had...I barely even have words to describe it, but I could barely stop eating it!\n- fruits de mer souffl\u00e9 - with scallops and shrimp - just perfect. Perfect. Whole pieces of shrimp and large pieces of scallops littered this souffl\u00e9 so that every bite had at least one piece of seafood. The souffl\u00e9 itself tasted amazing and came out piping hot, fresh from the oven.\n- lobster souffl\u00e9 - LOTS of lobster in here...oh man...and the souffl\u00e9 was just as good as the fruits de mer.\n- chocolate souffl\u00e9 - I nearly choked on the first bite from the inhalation of the thick dusting of powdered sugar on top, but once we passed that, it was absolute heaven! The souffl\u00e9 was almost custard-like inside and the chocolate flavor was so aromatic throughout every bite.\n- strawberry souffl\u00e9 (seasonal) - oh man...this may have been my favorite one of the night. It was piled high with strawberries on top and had such wonderful strawberry flavor throughout the entire souffl\u00e9! \n\nThe best combination was actually eating both the chocolate and strawberry souffl\u00e9s together...OMG...I'm drooling just thinking about these again!!\n\nIt should also be noted that the bread that was served with the meal was incredible! Talk about real rustic French bread...the crust and crunch in this baby was so perfect, and the inside was like warm, pillowy clouds.\n\nFinally, the service for the night was absolutely amazing. Our server, Scott, did a great job making sure that we were satisfied with our food, consistently made sure our water glasses were full, and just made friendly conversation with us in genera. He made an already- delicious night even more enjoyable!\n\nAlso, just a note to people who may be looking for a quick meal - this is a place to really sit down and take your time. Jacqueline makes each souffl\u00e9 from scratch and as ordered, so, yes, it will take time. Our entire meal took us about 3.5 hours, so plan accordingly!\n\nThis restaurant is great for special occasions - the prices are not so conducive to eating here often - but I will be sure to make my way back!!", "author": "Charissa L."}

Still, Cafe Jacqueline brought France to San Francisco so there's no need.\n\nThis was definitely one of those nights when all caution would be thrown to the wind. And by that, I mean we ordered a bottle of champagne and a souffle. The souffle Grand Marnier to be exact. Watching your carbs, sugar, and cholesterol? Get outta here! Life's too short.\n\nThe waiter is a character. New Yorkers won't probably be offended by his odd temperament since we're used to people like him BUT for all you other humans from small local towns and areas filled with happy people, just don't take it personally.\n\nThe champagne was just what the doctor ordered. The souffle? Words can't even begin to describe my first spoonful. I was a souffle virgin. Now I am a woman who has given into absolute sugar sin.\n\nI desperately want to come back for a savory souffle. The thought of having lobster within one of those fluffy creations has been taunting me since I left.\n\nOh and make sure you go to the bathroom so you can walk through the kitchen and see Madam Jacqueline at work. I suggest having a bottle of champagne since that will guarantee a trip (or two).

After a great dinner at Mission Street Oyster Bar, I called Cafe Jacqueline and made a reservation for 2 for dessert only. Because it's North Beach, parking was an absolute disaster. When I first walked in, I was a bit let down. The decor is tired and rundown and the seating was hard and uncomfortable. Also, it was stuffy and too warm. For this, I'm deducting a star. We went all out and ordered a souffle each when, to be honest, one is more than enough for two people. We enjoyed a couple of glasses of so-so wine (but at $10 a glass, I'd do it again) and chatted while we waited. The servers are classic San Francisco and added an air of timelessness to the evening. Oddly, I recommend you use the bathroom. It's a tiny nondescript bathroom but you get to walk back through the small spotless kitchen and see the huge bowl of eggs that Jacqueline goes through to make her masterpieces.\n\nSouffles I've had before came with sauces. These did not. One chocolate and one grand marnier and they were huge, light and perfect. Pricey at $35 and $45 but I'm thrilled that my girlfriend had her first souffle that was so wonderful. \n\nThe lighting and music were indeed romantic but if I were to want a really romantic dinner for this kind of money ($118 plus tip for the above which was basically dessert but could have been $80 had we split one), I'd want a more upscale dining room.", "author": "Brian B."}

It's exceptional in every way -- the food, the service, and the ambiance all are wonderful. As others reviewers have noted or alluded to, this is not a place to come if you want a quick in-and-out experience. But why you would want (or expect) that of souffles is beyond me. Jacqueline uses the freshest ingredients and her souffles are made to order. \n\nAll of the souffles are delicious; however, the ones that stand out in my mind are the cauliflower and the leek (savory) and the lemon, the lime and the peach (sweet). While I encourage getting a savory AND a sweet with groups of three or more, when it is my husband and me, we generally begin with the French onion soup, move on to a salad (to cleanse the palate), and end with a dessert souffle. (Although, we've been known to add a savory souffle to the our order as well, and then we just take a portion of it or the dessert souffle home with us.)

THE STAFF IS ATROCIOUS.***\n\nIt was the best and worst dinner experience that we have ever had.\n\nWe had the whole menu planned out: french onion soup, appetizer, lobster souffl\u00e9, and grand marnier souffl\u00e9 for dessert. However, we had reservations at 6 and had tickets to the 8PM showing of Lion King, and had we known that our menu would take over two hours, we would've done things differently.\n\nExpect a wait, seriously. Even though there are empty tables in the restaurant, they're booked, and with only two waiters and one chef, whatever you order will take...a...long...time...\n \nOur waiter was off-putting from the beginning. I have very high standards for customer service, and this guy made me feel belittled or depreciated. I agree 100% with Gautam S.' review just below when they said that the staff made it seem like it was a burden to wait on us. He made me feel like we were too young for the establishment, and almost guilty for not ordering wine (yeah, we don't drink wine).\n \nOur spinach and goat cheese salad, though a very tasty one, took forever to come out (such a simple salad should not take 30 minutes to come out. you lay down some spinach, crumble some cheese on top, drizzle oil over it, and voil\u00e0). While the dressing/oil was pretty light, they put a bit too much.\n\nAnother 30 minutes went by when we realized that the soup hadn't even come out yet, let alone our two souffl\u00e9s. We had a show to catch, which we could not be late for. We pulled our waiter aside (which shouldn't take several attempts) and told him that we're on a tight schedule and needed to leave no later than 20 minutes before the show (which, at that time was probably 40 minutes away). We understand that we should have let them know that we were on a schedule so that they can time everything because the souffl\u00e9s had specific bake times, so yes somewhat our fault. However, making us feel guilty about it made it worse than cancelling our dessert souffl\u00e9.\n\nThe redeeming factor that actually gave this place any stars at all was the FRENCH ONION SOUP. Definitely started a \"best thing that I ever ate\" list because of this soup. It was THE best. Five stars.\n\nOur lobster souffl\u00e9 came out, and the waiter cut it up before I could even take a picture of it, and it was hurriedly plopped onto our plates. The lobster souffl\u00e9 had absolutely ZERO lobster taste. It just tasted like a regular savory cheese souffl\u00e9 with chunks of chewy lobster, which could have been shrimp for all we knew. It had NO TASTE. For $60, definitely NOT WORTH IT. I probably would have been happier with one of the $30 mushroom or garlic souffl\u00e9s. We swallowed that souffl\u00e9 in less than 10 minutes. NOT because it was delicious, but because we were rushed.

There were 4 of us, and it was PLENTY of food.\n\nAll was delicious, although my favorites were probably the corn/garlic/ginger (I was super apprehensive about the ginger, but it gave it just a touch of tang that was perfect) and then the lemon was to-die-for.\n\nThe service was impeccable and I loved seeing Jacqueline cooking away in the kitchen.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-27", "description": "My wife and I have been meaning to go to Cafe Jacqueline for a little while now and we finally got round to it last night. The first thing I would say about it is that in San Francisco, it is about as unique a restaurant as the city can offer. I can't think of any other restaurant that specializes in just souffles and has been doing so for 35 years.\n\nThe room is a lovely romantic setting. So very understated, very French. Not very big, about 12 tables. As the souffles are all prepared and cooked to order, a meal will last about 2 hours at least. I think we were there nearly 3, depends on whether you have dessert as well really.\n\nThe wine list was very impressive. Obviously there were some local California ones but I was so pleased to see an extensive French list which isn't very common in SF/Bay Area.\n\nThe starters listed on the menu were generally quite light. They need to be to make room for the main event! First listed are soups, French onion and a soup du jour. We each decided on soup for some reason. I had the soup du jour, which was cream of zucchini and it was very flavourful and delicious. My wife opted for the already much celebrated French onion soup, which was as good any I've had in France. So good! The other starters were things like figs wrapped in proscuitto, salads etc... All very nice, not what I wanted at the time though.\n\nThe main course, souffles. Made to be shared between 2, as pointed out by the waiter, all made fresh with Gruyere cheese. These are not diet-friendly and taste all the better for it. They are all quite simple ingredients to really showcase how good they are: mushroom, leek, broccoli, lobster, crab. Perhaps the most complex used 3 ingredients: shiitake mushrooms, basil and garlic. We opted for a mushroom souffle. It is pretty tricky to try and describe in written words how good it was. You could taste the mushrooms and the cheese and the love and care that went into producing the dish. Fantastic! It was huge too, we took the rest home and had it for breakfast this morning, on toast.\n\nWe were unsure whether to go for dessert, but to really do justice to the whole experience, you have to. We'd heard the peach souffle is a standout despite hearing the daily specials. Yet again, when food is so good, I'm lost as to how to describe it. We were worried it would be too heavy but I guess as it is not loaded with cheese it was just light and fluffy and completed the meal with such a delicate peach flavour that lingered until we got home.\n\nI strongly recommend putting on a shirt and trousers and going to Cafe Jacqueline. As close to eating rustic French cuisine in a rural French setting as you could find 5,000 or so miles away from rural France. \n\nAs the restroom is situated just outside, out the back of the restaurant in a tiny garden of potted plants, you have to walk through the small kitchen. Be sure to thank Jacqueline for the food as you see her behind the biggest bowl of eggs whisking by hand all the souffles. An unforgettable experience.", "author": "Lewis F."}

I had made one the week before, and my boyfriend and I arrived a bit early for our 7:30 time slot on a Saturday night. Entering the restaurant was a bit awkward because the middle tables are facing the door, so my BF and I were left standing there for a bit looking around, unsure if we should walk to the back to talk to a waiter or just wait. The couple sitting in the middle row also gave us a weird look when we walked in, which definitely added to our anxiety. We ended up waiting and a waiter came to us, asking if we had a reservation. We confirmed and he sat us at a nice, cozy table near the back. \n\nThe prices are quite exorbitant but we knew this and only wanted a dessert souffle. We decided to get the strawberry because it was the fruit souffle and my BF wasn't feeling the chocolate. I was aware that we were going to have to wait awhile for our food, but we waited close to an HOUR for one souffle. I'm really glad we ate dinner at home before coming. \n\nAfter a long long long time our strawberry souffle finally arrived. It was huge and we decided to eat it straight from the enormous ramekin. It was HOT and my tongue was burned immediately. OUCH =( Also beware of the powdered sugar on top, I inhaled a bit while eating and it made me cough. They add a good amount of fresh strawberries on top, but we had to eat them quickly because the flavor wasn't as good when they started to get warm. The outside of the souffle was yummy because it was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. But as we started to eat towards the center, the souffle had the consistency of thin oatmeal... it definitely wasn't appealing. The waiter warned us it would be softer near the middle but I don't think it was supposed to be oatmeal consistency. As for the flavor, I could taste the strawberry (as well as a bit of eggy flavor which took some getting used to), but my BF said the strawberry wasn't pronounced enough.\n\nOverall we paid $35 to wait almost an hour for a whatever souffle =( The service was good and they refilled our waters constantly, but I thought it was a bit presumptuous of the waiter to ask at the end of the meal \"So what will you have next time?\" Not going to be a next time sir.", "author": "Sam F."}

The chef is a tart, but pleasant elderly french lady that loves her craft, and so do I.  she bakes right in the back of the restaurant, so you can see her as you timidly walk through her kitchen to as you fake a \"restroom break\" (located on the back right).  If you walk too far, the pizza shop employees in the back will stop and redirect you.  Be sure to awe at the amazing basket of eggs in the kitchen.\n\nThe souffles offered are savory and sweet.  We went only for dessert, so we tried the chocolate and the lemon.  Both were amazing, but the lemon was the most pleasant surprise.  I would describe it as a fluffy lemon bar.  Unlike many souffles, these don't come accompanied by any whipped cream.  They're around 7\" diameter and sit 4\" tall.  The ramekins are huge.  It reminds me of Morton's souffle, but better.  Cost is around $30 each, and can be shared with friends.  Atmosphere was candle lit romantic, so I don't recommend large parties.  They can probably only fit 25 people in there at a time anyway.  Parking is a pain, so be careful.  Street only, and you're competing with the bars.", "author": "Jerry A."}

We went around the table and every person had a few different favorites, none were left out, and everyone loved everything. Split a couple bottles of wine too, that was killer.

Although the wait staff was excellent, what was really disappointing was the time it took to get the food out on the table.  We ordered a French onion soup which took about 45 min and then then our entr\u00e9e souffl\u00e9 took about 1.5 hrs to arrive on the table.  By that time I was so hungry I really didn't get to enjoy the food.  Finally our dessert souffl\u00e9 took another 45 min after.

You get one souffle for two and that was good. We had mushroom and prosciutto souffle and it was delicious. It was nice to digest the  salad and soup first. So, when the main dish souffle came, we were able to eat again. We had the chocolate souffle for dessert and I'm glad it took its time. It was the size as the main course. I thought I could only eat part of it but we both scoffed it up and nothing was left. It was so light. I loved that we were not rushed to eat. We were able to savor each bite of our dinner. If you plan to go, plan only for this dinner. This is a \"NO RUSH\" restaurant.  We were at the restaurant for two hours and we could have stayed a little longer if we had more coffee. \n\nThe waiters were so efficient, professional, and friendly (friendly meaning not palsy wellsy type).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-09-19", "description": "It is actually unfathomable to me that anyone would give Caf\u00e9 Jacqueline anything less than a 5-star review -- one of the best meals, and restaurant experiences, I've ever had. Traditional souffl\u00e9 restaurants are few and far between (even in Paris), and I would say this place is as good as Le Souffl\u00e9. \n\nFirst of all, lovely atmosphere -- quiet, low lighting, lovely classical music. The only thing I was nervous about from reading the reviews was that the wait staff would be rude, or at least cold. Not so, at ALL. Perfect service. Friendly, unobtrusive, warm, endlessly helpful. There were two waiters (Scott and a man with an incredible mustache) handling the whole place, and they each treated us (and everyone around us) like royalty. They would talk and joke with us when appropriate, and back off a bit when we were having a little romantic moment. : )\n\nNow onto the most important thing: the FOOD. Oh good God, the food. I'm shocked more reviewers haven't mentioned the bread! I haven't had better bread or butter outside of Paris. Warm and crispy, and they keep it coming. We had the watercress and the arugula and goat cheese salad, both made with a traditional French vinaigrette -- fresh and light and delicious.\n\nWhen it came to souffl\u00e9, we went for one of the specials -- yellow chanterelles and garlic. Just. Heaven. Fluffy and flavorful, but the garlic wasn't too overwhelming... my mouth is watering recounting it now.\n\nWe had the chocolate souffl\u00e9 for dessert (duh), and it was, if possible, even more sublime than the savory. We were so stuffed, but we scraped the dish clean. One reviewer mentioned that their chocolate souffl\u00e9 was \"runny\" -- I can't speak to that particular experience, but a good souffl\u00e9 should have a slightly runny center, just in the very middle. Like a little chocolate mousse surprise!\n\nI don't really understand complaining about the price... it's really reasonable, maybe even too reasonable, for what you're getting, which is hand-crafted gourmet food made with high-quality ingredients. You can get three courses and a fairly expensive bottle of wine and spend about $100/person (including tip). If you do that, you will leave STUFFED. Seems like a steal to me.\n\nOther things: it will literally take you three hours to eat here. It is not a pre-show or pre-movie restaurant; it is an experience unto itself. The food takes forever because one person is preparing it, and it's a time-comsuming food. Go with someone you want to talk to and eat the amazing bread. So, so worth it. Make a reservation, because... duh. If you show up with no reservation and complain about the wait, I just have no sympathy. There may be empty tables, but can I mention again how **ONE person is making all these souffl\u00e9s**? (Also, not fair to deduct points from the restaurant because it's difficult to park in North Beach.)\n\nWe were encouraged to go in back and say a quick hello to Jacqueline after the meal. She was so sweet and gracious, and that bowl of eggs is a sight to behold. There was a lovely older French man in the kitchen as well (Her husband? I don't know!) who exclaimed (in French), \"These souffl\u00e9s are bigger than the ones you get in France, yes? Bigger AND better!\" Jacqueline just shook her head modestly, and my heart melted.\n\nThank you, Caf\u00e9 Jacqueline, for the most magical evening!", "author": "Darcy B."}

It was difficult finding this place (not the most flashy or decorative restaurant out there) but we found it after circling around the block for a bit. When we entered, we were INSTANTLLYYY greeted by a slightly rude gentlemen (Matt, whose mustache is very distracting!) and directly asked if we had reservations -- and after a little mix up, we finally sat down.\n\n\nAppetizer - \nFrench Onion Soup: \n[http://s3-media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0vgvaD5Ve5E8coTOkQXcOw/l.jpg]\nTHIS IS THE BEST SOUP I'VE EVER HAD, PERIOD.

AMAZING.\n\nEntree:\nProsciutto and Mushroom Souffle:\n[http://s3-media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WifaiynwQ5KgZv4b-f9upw/l.jpg]\nThere was a total of 4 largely wrapped slices of prosciutto on top of a beautiful mushroom souffle. This is where the whole \"IT'S SO FLUFFY\" comes in -- because it was! It was hearty yet so light, and fluffy yet so filling. Oddly enough, it was also a tad too salty.. (maybe because of the prosciutto) but it was divine. At this point, I was already full [my GF ate 1/4 of it and I finished the rest] and was contemplating on either keeping or canceling the long awaited ... \n\nDessert:\nChocolate Souffle:\n[http://s3-media3.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ppsCedRWOBofMdqdB6diDA/l.jpg]\nWhat Madame Jacquline is famous for -- the Chocolate Souffle! It was HUGE -- literally. I love my dessert like no other but this one was so overwhelming ginormous! At first I laughed at the \"serves 2-4 people\" caption on the menu, but seeing this shut me up good.. It was disappointing though how they only had chocolate (no fruits) but regardless, it was an amazing way to end our meal. Did I mention how FLUFFY it was? It sucks I couldn't finish it.. there was still about 1/3 left (I almost cried, kinda).\n\nMy first impression of Cafe Jacqueline was.. well, they could use a renovation. Also, the lack of choices of dishes (two soups, few salads, and only souffles) felt disappointing. I didn't know they only served souffles and their prices are on the $$$ side.\n\nHowever. it has the old French style decor with dimly lit candles and lighting everywhere -- perfect for a romantic date. Matt, the only waiter at CJ, is actually a charming funny guy after you get pass his business mentality (he tends to shoo away walk-ins by stating \"it'll be 45minute-1hour wait\" -- but this leads to a more quiet and romantic atmosphere, so kudos).  Also, be prepared to have TONS to talk to with your date or party because the food will take a long long time. We sat down at 7:30PM and left at around 9:15PM. Overall, a lovely different experience on the French take and will definitely be back for seconds! \n\nPS: Make reservations -- even though there's no OpenTable and don't forget to say hi to the head chef and owner, Madame Jacqueline, on your way out!", "author": "Albert L."}

There really isn't another restaurant like it in SF. The souffl\u00e9s are delicious--I have never had one short of delicious, though I am especially partial to the citrus dessert ones, like the lime--and the experience of dining there as a whole feels like a mini-vacation from the world outside. Be prepared for a leisurely meal, say three hours or so, and don't take anyone whose conversation and company you dislike. Make sure to stop by the kitchen to see the giant bowl of eggs and to say thank you in person to Jacqueline!", "author": "Rose G."}

Each spoonful makes you smile and reminds you the power of good food.  \n\n   The Strawberry Souffle was life changing.  Seriously, there are few restaurants that push the envelope on what you thought was good and this was one of them.\n\n  I cannot wait to come back and try the other dessert souffles.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-03", "description": "Very excited that I get to write this review. I've been wanting to try Caf\u00e9 Jacqueline for a while and finally made it a point to make reservations. Reservation process was very easy, although I left a message, I also called around 4:30pm on a Wednesday to make reservations for that Saturday evening. \n\nParking is a pain, so make sure you plan ahead with enough time to scout the streets of North Beach. I was seated promptly after letting them know I had a reservation. So here is my impression on the service. I had a great experience, yes they did take a while to get my wine order and all of that, but the service was authentic. And when I say that, I say I know that the wait staff was not trying to pretend to be overly nice to me for a tip. They were extremely helpful in helping us order, serving our souffl\u00e9s, and answering all of our questions about the restaurant - you can just tell they enjoy working where they work. And that's a plus with me, real service over forced service any day.\n\nFor appetizers, I had the French Onion Soup and the Spinach w/ Goat Cheese Salad. Both were amazing, the goat cheese they used was so creamy. It was all delicious and made us anticipate our entr\u00e9e. \n\nThe prosciutto and mushroom souffl\u00e9 was well prepared - I just don't think that I am much of a savory souffl\u00e9 gal. It was a bit salty for my taste, but we still devoured it. Very light!\n\nThe seasonal fruit souffl\u00e9 was blueberry (although I was hoping for strawberry) and it was DELICIOUS. Wow. Their dessert souffl\u00e9s kick butt - I really could've eaten the whole thing by myself. If you can just imagine a mouthful of light airy creaming, but not overwhelming goodness that's what you got!\n\nOur meal was also paired with a very balanced wine recommended to us by the staff. I am a fan and did not leave disappointed. Reason for it being shy of 5 stars was just probably the very steep pricing and parking chaos. But I would go again in a heartbeat if it were a special occasion. \n\nBest thing was that I didn't feel too bloated because everything was light, just that perfect balance of satisfaction from a good meal. \n\nWe probably spent $200 after everything for our meal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-11-27", "description": "Jacqueline, je t'adore. Je suis a votre service.\n\nAnd I didn't know a single word of French before dining there.\n\nCafe Jacqueline is as far as I know, a unique experience in the San Francisco Bay area.  And when you go there, you must visit the restroom.  Not necessarily for the facilities, but simply for the excuse of walking through the kitchen (the WC is off the courtyard behind the kitchen).  In the kitchen you will see Jacqueline herself at the counter with a large copper bowl full of eggs whipping away, stirring, and creating the wonderful dishes that she serves.  She smiles at you and at that moment you know that the food is prepared with love (the key ingredient to truly great meals).  The place radiates warmth and friendship, and it all starts with her.\n\nThe waiters are friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.  Listen to their recommendation on what works and doesn't, they know what they are talking about.  They also know the wines and what pairs well with what you are ordering.  If they don't know, they have a large \"The Book of Wine\" in the back that they will bring to your table to discuss the options.\n\nTake a date a share.  Better yet, go with four or six so that you can get two or three souffles (they are sizable).  Get the French onion soup, well worth the onion breath you will have later.  And do I even have to tell you to save room for dessert?  Yes, the chocolate is heavenly, but don't be so typical.  But this is another reason to go as a group of four or six, more people means more options to try get the chocolate and one of the fruit based souffles.\n\nThe wine list is primarily French.  Don't be a CA wine snob, order a wine that fits the food - maybe a nice Rhone Red, something you don't have in your cellar at home.  Show your date some self confidence by getting something you don't normally drink at home. First time there (second date with a woman who is now my wife) I ordered a wonderful half bottle followed by another.  One word of warning if you get the half bottle, make sure you are clear to your date that you are getting more wine or she may think you are cheap.  I almost lost her right there :).  But the wines are great, how could you try just one.  Another reason to go with a group of four.\n\nOnly one word of warning about dining there, well actually two.  First, ask for a table away from the door.  If you get one of the tables right by the door \"on a cold San Francisco night\", you will get a cold blast whenever someone come in.  Plus when people show up early there is really no place to wait, and some people choose to wait right by the tables inside the door.\n\nThe other word of warning is, don't be in a rush.  People, A Souffle takes time to be made properly.  So if you have a show to go to, you might want to dine somewhere else.  Each time I have dined with Jacqueline, there has been at least one table of diners that were trying to rush off somewhere.  One guy was snapping at the waiter \"I told you when we arrived that we were short on time, now we don't have time for dessert\" - BTW, he arrived after us, was late for his reservation, and made an ass out of himself.\n\nDining with Jacqueline is all the romance you need for the evening.  Save the show for another night.  Take your time, enjoy the evening, say hello to the master herself, and let the romance of the evening warm you up \"on a cold San Franciscan night\".", "author": "Jeff H."}

We ordered the shiitake/basil/garlic souffle for dinner and the white chocolate souffle for dessert. Both were utterly incredible. The puffiness of the souffle makes them intimidating, and we were sure we would have to be rolled out of the restaurant by the time we finished, but this fear evaporated upon the first bite. Despite wonderfully rich flavors, the incredibly light texture allows you to eat and eat and eat, and to savor the flavors for almost as long as it took to cook, without getting uncomfortably full. I also worried I might get tired of a souffle before finishing it, but between the crisp top, chewy edges, fluffy sides, and moist center, every bite is a new experience.\n\nI would describe the staff as french, professional, and funny.

Crusty, hot, out of the oven bread that you can only get in France (or so you thought).  The soup was a creamy, pure, roasted red pepper that was unexpectedly light and fresh. The salads were exactly what we hoped for--crisp, lightly dressed and very satisfying on a warm spring afternoon. As the last evening light faded from the sky (we had a 7:30 reservation), our crab and Brie souffl\u00e9s arrived. Two souffl\u00e9s were the perfect amount for a family of four to share. They were beautifully created; light and airy, full of flavor and slightly indulgent.  I think the crab was my personal favorite.  The lemon souffl\u00e9 was a perfect ending to a remarkably fun evening. Greeting Jacqueline upon our departure was such a pleasure.

As decades long lover of Cafe Jacqueline, I was moved to suggest it when my teen son wanted a special place to take his girlfriend for a \"little\" anniversary. I tried to talk him into staying in the East Bay, but he wanted something special and romantic in the city so they could have an adventure, and because he, in his words, \"REALLY likes her\". It was really also a first formal date for him, unlike the usual movie dates or just hanging out playing video games.\n\nOf course Jacqueline's lovely place came to mind.  Elegant enough to feel special, but not so much as to be intimidating, and always intimate because of J's policy of not filling all tables, it seemed like just the right choice.\n\nWhen he came back, he couldn't stop thanking me.  He said the food was like \"God's..\" - well, I won't tell you what he said, because we have a strange and wonderful relationship, which is often based on tasteless and offensive humor. The fact that he could speak to Jacqueline in flawless and unaccented French couldn't have hurt, but he said she and the waiter were both totally charming. I can only imagine what some restaurants would have done with a couple of 17-year old kids.\n\nHe thought that the few negative Yelp reviews just showed some people's ignorance - \"of course they can't hold a table for someone late for their reservation on a Friday night\", or \"don't they understand about how she doesn't want to seat every table so people have some privacy?\"\n\nBtw, his girlfriend is vegetarian, so it was perfect for her.  They were full after the delicious tomato-cilantro entree souffle (how can something made mostly of air be so filling), but couldn't resist the strawberry souffle for dessert, and were totally in love with the \"2 long spoon\" feature of the latter, for sharing. He went in knowing how much it would cost, and said it was worth every penny of his hard-earned camp-counselor money.\n\nTwo souffles by a master, about $80 with tip.

Merci beaucoup, Madame Jacqueline!!\n\nI have had very delicious souffl\u00e9s in Europe and Asia.  Ever since those wonderful experiences, I've tried to find the same souffl\u00e9 experience in California.  I've had souffl\u00e9s at many fine dining restaurants such as Gary Danko and Fleur De Lys, but nothing can compare to the souffl\u00e9s here at Cafe Jacqueline.  In addition, everything else I tasted here was very delicious as well!\n\n\nAfter reading the reviews from Yelp, I decided to: \n1) Make a reservation first;  \n2) Study the menu before we go (thanks to Steph L.'s photo!);  \n3) Try to speak some French to the waiters, haha!\n\n\nI called and left a message to make a same day reservation on Sunday.  My husband and I were in SF enjoying the amazing Gaultier exhibits at de Young Museum, and we got a call back from Madame Jacqueline herself confirming our reservation at 6:30pm.  What a lucky start!\n\nThe parking situation around the cafe was terrible, so be sure to arrive early to hunt for spaces.  We kept circling around and finally found a parking space right across from the cafe.  Another lucky sign!  \n\nAs we walked into the cafe, it was half packed with many party of 4's.  We waited for a while, told them we had a reservation, and finally a waiter told us to sit at any tables for 2.  Not very welcoming at first, but I can tell they were busy.  I was in a very good mood, so that didn't bother me at all.  As we sat through the evening, we actually found both waiters were very friendly and nice to have some conversations.  So make friends with them!  :)\n\nThe waiter promptly brought us water and menu, and we told him we are ready to order now.  He was surprised at first, and then he informed us the special of the day was the Oyster souffl\u00e9.  We went with our original planned menu at the end.\n\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\n\n1)  Escargot:  It has 8 pieces.  When we first saw the price, we were shocked by the $35 price tag.  However, the escargots were pretty big, and the seasoning tasted just right!  Not too salty, and you can taste the \"umami\" of the esargot.  Recommended.\n\n2)  Spinach salad with bacon & pine nuts:  I ordered this dish only because I am a pregnant woman who needs some iron.  I usually don't like raw spinach, but the spinach was very good and fresh.  The dressing is vinegar-based, and the bacon bites are very crispy.  All together this salad was a surprise hit for me!  Recommended.\n\n3)  French onion soup:  The onion soup was one of the best onion soups I ever had in CA.  It had a perfect balance of cheese, bread, soup, and onions.  The soup was well seasoned (not too salty), cheese was gooey, and the soaked homemade bread was very good.  Very recommended!\n\n4)  Cauliflower souffl\u00e9:  My husband and I both wanted to order this for no reason.  When the souffl\u00e9 came, the waiter asked us \"How did you know to order this?  It is very simple, people don't order this often, but this is my favorite souffl\u00e9 here!\"   As I don't have much expectation for the savory souffl\u00e9 (well, we all know that the dessert souffl\u00e9 is the main course, right?), this turned out to be very good!!  The souffl\u00e9 was fluffy, with a little moist in the center and crispy on the edge & top.  The baked cauliflowers made the souffl\u00e9 sweet & tender without overpowering the taste and the color of souffl\u00e9 itself (although I still found it to be slightly too salty).  Totally loved it!  Very recommended!\n\n5)  White chocolate souffl\u00e9:  The white chocolate souffl\u00e9 made me felt like in heaven!  Before it arrived at our table, I could already smelled the aroma.  The souffl\u00e9 was fluffy, tasty, and dreamy!  Just like the savory souffl\u00e9, it had a perfect balance of fluffiness, moist, and crispiness!  I personally hate those souffl\u00e9s that were added too much syrup / sauce in the center (and became super runny and way too sweet).  The souffl\u00e9 here doesn't have any sauce to add on, and I love the way it is!  The white chocolate chips on the top melts as the waiter caught and served the souffl\u00e9.  Although I am usually a dark chocolate person, I love, love this white chocolate souffl\u00e9!!  It was definitely the perfect souffl\u00e9 experience I've been looking for in CA.  I've finally found my true love here, and I will come back to try more of the dessert souffl\u00e9s!!  Very, very recommended!! +++\n\n6)  Others:  Warm homemade bread before meal & decaf Earl Grey tea after meal were both very good as well!  The bread was super crispy outside and tender inside.  Tea was perfect pairing the souffl\u00e9.\n\n\nWe started eating at 6:30pm, and our dinner ended at around 9:20pm.  We were prepared to wait for the souffl\u00e9s, so the serving time didn't bother us.

I went with my gf and we ordered the crab souffle and a lemon souffle for dessert. It was way too much food so we had to get half the dessert souffle to go.\nThe Crab souffl\u00e9 was good but not to die for. I got tired of it about half way.\nThe Lemon souffl\u00e9 was amazing and still delicious the next day.\n\nI think 1 salty souffl\u00e9 + 1 dessert souffl\u00e9 is the good amount of food for 3 ppl. For 2, I would either only get 1 salty souffl\u00e9 or get an appetizer (I heard the onion soup is fabulous) + 1 dessert souffl\u00e9.\n\nThe 2 reasons why it didn't get 5 stars:\n- It took over an hour for us to get our food. I know it takes time to cook but my stomach was starting to eat itself. Good thing, they bring you very good home made bread.\n- At the end, I got souffl\u00e9-ed out. I like souffl\u00e9s, but this was too much and I would have rather have less but a soup or salad on the side.", "author": "Boris H."}

I don't think I could just pop in casually to have a meal here, but for a celebration or milestone, it's perfect. \n\nWe came for our anniversary, and it was definitely a different experience than any other ol' restaurant. The interior is the very definition of intimate, and the servers were courteous, attentive, and mustache-envy inducing. They weren't afraid to talk with you either, which under other circumstances I might have not liked. But since your food will take upwards of an hour or two to prepare, they help pass the time.\n\nWe had three souffles, which is entirely too many. One will do ya. But we weren't gonna be back any time soon, so we said to hell with it and ordered two entrees and a dessert. And french onion soup. And it was all worth it. \n\nOur entrees were Shiitake Basil & Garlic souffle and the Lobster souffle. They puff up to giant proportions, but every bite of em got eaten. Light, cheesy, delicate, all-around tasty. And we didn't stop there.\n\nThe dessert souffles take time to prepare as well.  Luckily all that waiting gave us time to digest and prepare ourselves for the Strawberry souffle. I dunno where we found the room, but we muscled it down just as easy as the first two, not letting any go to waste. \n\nThis is one of those places where it's easy to go over the top.

(bacon lovers don't hurt me) But oh my lord, I am now a believer. \n\nI love everything about this place, from the quaint decor to the patient helpful waitstaff to Jacqueline in the back whipping up delicious dreamy melt-in-your-mouth-orgasmic souffles. I want to kidnap Jacqueline and her ginormous basket of eggs in the back and take her home with me so that I can eat souffles for the rest of my life. \n\nThe lobster souffle is absolutely amazing, and they serve it with lemons on top for a nice counterbalance of sweetness and acidity to the cheesy fluffy goodness. The chocolate souffle was the perfect decadent dessert, really it's like eating clouds of chocolate. We also tried the onion soup - YUM! although a bit salty for me - the endive salad with roquefort, and the escargot. I'd pass on the salad and go for the escargot. It was AMAZING. However it was they prepared the escargot, it made them taste like tender bites of steak. I kid you not. Each bite was....bliss, and yes I realize it probably was the butter. \n\nBeware, these souffles are ginormous and my date and I were stuffed to the gut by the end of the meal, slightly regretting having ordered so much food, but it was so worth the after meal food coma. Also note that the meal itself takes quite a while (2-3 hours) but it's worth the wait for these souffles.\n\nPlus at the end you can go to the kitchen and see Jacqueline and her staff in action.

Unlike one of the reviews here, do not wonder in off the street on a weekend night and then become indignant when they don't immediately seat you. This place has about seven tables and they serve souffles. Souffles! You know how they make a souffle, right? They don't exactly flip the tables several times a night. It's dark and you are pretty much in for a very good, long French meal. So call and get a reservation.\n\nI've been here about eight times. I drag everyone here. When was the last time you made a souffle? When was the last time you saw a souffle on a menu? Never? Me, too. Here's how it goes down. You go in and order both a dinner and dessert souffle. Each souffle will serve about two people. A dinner souffle might be salmon and leek. Dessert might be chocolate or lime. They are all excellent. Do the chocolate at some point. It's not a cheap meal, but for San Francisco it's very reasonable and a very excellent experience. The service is fantastic. \n\nAt the end of the evening you might even go back into the kitchen and say a few words to Jacqueline. She's the only one in the kitchen behind a giant bowl of eggs.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-12-15", "description": "This has to be my favorite restaurant in San Francisco!  If you look at my many many many Yelp reviews, you'll see I'm pickier than any age/race/religious critical eater stereotypes you can fabricate.  The souffl\u00e9 is a magically airy dish that is executed perfectly here.  I really like how the sides and top are crispy while the insides are gooey -- never a need to pour sauce into it as a cheating moistener.  Yes, this is a long meal, but wine and good company will make an enjoyable interlude between courses.\n\nFrench Onion Soup: The broth is rich.  There are plenty of onions and they are translucent in large pieces.  The cheese is plentiful and caked on to the sides.  Extremely hot though, so don't rush in despite the hunger!  I really enjoyed the heavy black pepper notes.\n\nLeek Souffl\u00e9: Gotta love the leek, an onion for snobs.  The gruy\u00e8re base does a good job of allowing this subtle flavor to permeate the souffl\u00e9.\n\nChanterelle Mushroom Souffl\u00e9: Not too mushroomy.  The flavor was contained to the mushroom morsels so the gruy\u00e8re really came through in the plain portions.\n\nLobster Souffl\u00e9: Yes, it's really that good!  More buttery and garlicky than cheesy, but that works well since the main ingredient is lobster.\n\nCrab Souffl\u00e9: I actually liked this more than the lobster.  The crab chunks were large and seemingly fresh.  Since San Francisco is more known for crab, this felt like a true local specialty instead of the over hyped lobster.  There were a few minor flakes of shells though, so be warned.\n\nProsciutto Souffl\u00e9: The only souffl\u00e9 I didn't care for.  When the proscuitto is cooked it tastes like common ham instead of the complex charcuterie.  Even so, the souffl\u00e9 is so heavenly you'll overlook that.\n\nChocolate Souffl\u00e9: Obligatory and necessary.  A mark of true perfection since you don't need chocolate syrup; the filling is both airy and super moist!  Chocolate lovers won't be able to avoid this one...\n\nBlackberry Souffl\u00e9: For those that like tartness in their desserts, the blackberry is the fruit for you.  I preferred the others because of my insatiable sweet tooth, yet still a crowd pleaser.\n\nStrawberry Souffl\u00e9: AMAZING!  Tastes like fresh, warm strawberry jam.\n\nLemon Souffl\u00e9: Not my first choice, but glad someone ordered it.  Reminded me of lemon meringue and blew away expectations.\n\nWhite Chocolate Souffl\u00e9: Tastes more like creamy cream than chocolate.  A typical dessert souffl\u00e9 here is moist and creamy to begin with so this is pure indulgence!", "author": "Adam B."}

We had a reservation for four and at the last minute an additional friend decided to join our entire evening.....Cafe Jacqueline was the finale.  Our dear hostess (you know - the one who got stuck making all the plans for us) actually stopped in 4 hours before our reservation to see if it would work to add the friend.  They said they couldn't guarantee it, but we could come by at 9pm to check.  Okay....fast forward to 9 - we arrive and they can't take us right now. One of the ladies in the party was in a bit of a huff about it.  She had a few words with one of the waiters and came out incensed.  I watched the whole thing and I felt she was over the top.  Well, I would have none of that.....it was MY freakin' birthday and I was going to CafeJacq.

So we went to the Savoy and sure enough, 15ish minutes later he ran over and got us.  Yes - it was now 9:35 for a 9pm reservation.

The bread is amazing and the cheese souffl\u00e9s are good - I favor the mushroom and prosciutto ones - but the best part is dessert.

Almost to the point we paused to think of ordering second round (NOT). You'll see in a minute.\n\nWe then shared the French Onion Soup and a Spinach Salad with Bacon and Pine Nuts. That soup was excellent. It isn't overly salted at most restaurants and the flavors were balanced very well. The skill level to cook that soup with all those different strong flavors...something to remember. The salad was well balanced between the crunchiness of the bacon to the crisp spinach leaves and pine nuts. The oil dressing was light and simple.\n\nWe ordered the mushroom and prosciutto for our main course. It was well balanced and wasn't heavy. Very filling.\n\nDessert was the chocolate souffle.

Took almost three hours from ordering to leaving.\n\nThe onion soup was too salty for me. It was not as awesome as I was expecting. This soup was not made to be drank by itself; bread would be a great complimentary food with it. \n\nThe lobster souffle was a bad idea, maybe it was just the Gruyere cheese that I did not like. My friend and I could hardly finish it. The texture was just too thick. Also, if we brought one more person, finishing this huge souffle could have been an easier job (I'm not kidding, it is quite large and can feed at least 2 people). Aside from the cheese, there was a good amount of lobster cubes in the souffle. Also, the fresh lemon slices that came with this souffle helped me much on eating it. \n\nLastly, it's dessert time! After the first bite of the Grand Marnier souffle, I found my confidence in souffles again. I have to give this dessert souffle five stars. I could actually taste the alcohol.

As if sharing a souffl\u00e9 for two is not romantic enough - red roses, low amber light, a small candle brought to your table, and very attentive service by two waiters keeps the spirit of love alive. A cold glass of Lilet begins the evening affair. Perfect endive salad made with crumbs of Roquefort, champagne vinaigrette, fine parsley and chervil. Artists could make models of her French onion soup and dramatic souffl\u00e9s. The egg lady is Jacqueline Margulis who learned to cook in a French convent. You meet her beaming self and an enormous bowl of eggs if you take a trip to the wash room which passes through the ovenly kitchen. Holder of many worthy recipes she serves probably the finest French Onion soup to be found outside of France. The art work uses a slice of French bread, Gruyere, and what may be a veal broth and the essence of caramelized onion. 11 tables makes this a tough place to get into. A note to the beginning budgeting gourmet - instead of ordering a main and a dessert souffl\u00e9 and a bottle of wine - simply share a basic souffl\u00e9 ($30+) and a French onion soup ($10+) and have a romantic experience and you like everyone who dines here will talk about the eveing for the rest of your life.", "author": "Mark Richard B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-02-20", "description": "I think I hyped up this place too much for myself and the souffles are definitely somewhat overrated. Let's just say dinner went from 8p to a bit over 11p. Woowee! You definitely have to come here with someone you LOVE talking to or else you're pretty much SCREWED. No joke. \n\nOut of the 3 things we ordered: French Onion Soup, Crab Souffle, and Chocolate Souffle, the only thing I want to keep raving about is the awesome French Onion Soup. \n\nFRENCH ONION SOUP\nWe had to wait about 30-40 minutes for this to come out. When it did, the cheese on top was baked to a good crust, and the soup was pippin' hot! The onions were tasty, the bread that was soaked in it was awesome, and overall the soup was not TOO salty. It was THE BEST. I would have totally wanted this all to myself but 2 ppl shared 1. \n\nCRAB SOUFFLE\nWaited about another 45-55 minutes for this to come out. When it did, I didn't get a chance to take a picture because our waiter began cutting it up and serving it to us. This was nice of him, but I wanted a picture. It's okay. At anyrate, after having a few bites, I felt like I was eating fluffy air. I kinda wanted to throw up after a few bites but told myself to keep it down. This was okay but I definitely didn't want more. I was then settling on the chocolate souffle....\n\nCHOCOLATE SOUFFLE\nSo we waited perhaps another 40 minutes for this. And WOW can there BE anymore powdered sugar on top? Mmm this definitely hit the spot and it was pretty tasty. I think their dessert souffles trump the savory ones. We only ate the top half of the souffle since everything else was too mushy and fluffy, just like the crab souffle. Soon, the rest of our souffle looked like dog food and I felt somewhat bad for not finishing it. Sorry Madame Jacqueline.\n\nTEA\nIf you order tea after your meal, they bring out a heart shaped box filled with various tea packets -- all from France! Woowee! Being Asian, I picked up some green tea packet and had the server prepare it for me. It came in a teacup sitting ontop of a teaplate and a bowl of cubed brown sugar...mmm! I want to say the tea was better than the crab souffle...hmmm??\n\nLet me comment about the servers. There are two of them: one is an older man and the other one is younger. The older man is definitely more grumpy than the younger one. The old man started walking off on us when we were deciding what we wanted to drink. He was so impatient. Had he been the only server there, I would have thrown a fit at how bad the service was. We tried avoiding him all night especially since the younger man was SO much more friendlier, helpful, and definitely MORE patient than the old man.\n\nOne recommendation for Cafe J is for them to make the souffles smaller so that customers can try more flavors AND it can be cooked better. I think the dessert souffles would have been 10x better had it not been served in such huge portions. \n\nTotal for 2 people was $145 after tip/tax. Not too bad for a French joint but the souffles were NOT worth it. Everyone says to make sure to use the bathroom before you leave and yes, do it. Let me give you a warning and say that the bathroom IS outdoors so on a cold SF night, don't go running out there in a tank top or something. At anyrate, Madame Jacqueline http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/6fyZbXqYZESX2yANZwi5HA/l keeps this HUGE HUGE HUGE wooden bowl filled with eggs in her kitchen. On top, there's one painted lucky egg. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/B0abxjf35tIHgcVnlsI9Yw/l\n\nI don't think I'll be returning to Cafe J....sorry!\n\nMore photos to be loaded.", "author": "Heidi C."}

We started off the meal with warm crusty french bread that was just a little sour. Mmm I swear it was the beast bread I have ever eaten. Next, we each ordered the french onion soup, shared the prosciutto and mushroom souffle, and a strawberry souffle for dessert.  The french onion soup was delicious and very cheesy. The prosciutto souffle was light fluffy and very decadent. Lastly, the strawberry souffle was divine. It too was light, airy, and not overly sweet. The strawberries on top perfectly complimented the souffle. We finished everything and went home very full and happy. 5 stars for the food.\n\nMy husband and I really liked the waiter. He was like out strawberry souffle... not overly sweet. I dislike fake, sickly sweet waiters and he seemed real to me. He was upfront, honest, and didn't sell us on more expensive items to beef up the bill to increase his tip size. Also, he made sure my wine glass was never empty and wished me a \"happy birthday\" on the way out. The other waiter was quieter and kept our water glasses full.  We liked him too. I give them both 5 stars. \n\nThe restaurant itself was quaint and elegant. And the lighting was perfect - mood lighting but not too dim. I also thought the roses were a cute touch. The room is small but the ceilings are very high which made it feel roomy and open. I also loved going to the bathroom. You get to walk through the kitchen and see Jacqueline with a big basket of eggs making all the souffles by herself! Unbelievable. This restaurant is a gem and it is so unique. It is exactly what I was looking for. I am so sick of the same old trendy restaurants that turn out to be the all the same versions of each other. I highly recommend Cafe Jacqueline to anyone looking for a special evening. 5 stars for ambiance.\n\nWhat to know:\nThe dinner did take a long time but i really liked the anticipation and was able to have good conversation and enjoy my wine between the meals. It gave me time to digest my food before the next course was brought out. That was a good thing because I was able to enjoy everything without feeling too stuffed.", "author": "J M."}

Wow - we were very impressed!  We shared a light salad to start, a herb and cheese souffl\u00e9 for our entr\u00e9e and a chocolate souffl\u00e9 for dessert.  Everything was wonderful. Our service was great and I liked how on the way to the restroom you walk through the kitchen and get a shot of Jacqueline herself in action.  \n\nHaving made souffl\u00e9 myself, I know it takes a long time to make and even longer to cook.  You cannot rush perfection!  As such, we thoroughly enjoyed our 3 hour dining experience.  It's so nice to just sit with your partner to take a break, have an absolutely amazing meal, and just enjoy each other's company.\n\nI guess if you don't really like your partner that much, or if you're super awkward and/or boring, this may not be the right dining experience for you.

Too bad San Francisco is not a day trip away from Houston. Well we went to the Bay area as part of a family vacation and my bro and I were able to drop in.\n\nWhen we first walked into the door they asked if we had a reservation. We said no but they kindly gave us a table. If you have your heart set on eating here I would highly recommend calling ahead for a reservation. Secondly, I wish I had dressed nicer than just wearing a henley and pants. This is obviously a place popular for special occasions and thus the rest of the clientele was well put together. \n\nThe waiters were kind and explained everything to us including the long wait time. THIS IS NOT A PLACE TO GRAB A QUICK BITE. Allot yourself at least 1 hour per souffle. \n\nIs the wait worth it? Well another customer turned to us and said the wait is well worth it and that the souffles are euphoric. We ordered the white corn, ginger, and garlic souffle and 1 hour later we were chowing down. The souffle itself was extremely light and delightfully oozing with gruyere cheese, however, the standout was the white corn. Crispy and sweet you could tell that it was fresh off the cob and blended well with the mild ginger and garlic flavor. Definitely a winner. Even my carnivorous brother found it amazing. Next was the white chocolate souffle. Wow. Just wow. Coming from a man who loves white chocolate this was the absolute best white chocolate dessert I have ever eaten. Quite possibly even the best dessert I've ever had the pleasure of eating. The souffle provided a perfect fluffy vessel for that rich white chocolate flavor. It took all of our willpower to not finish the entire dish since we wanted to save some of the love for our other brother and parents. \n\nCafe Jacqueline will always be a priority stop every time I am in the Bay Area!", "author": "Miguel L."}

Call Cafe Jaqueline, leave a message on their answering machine that I'm pretty sure uses a cassette tape as its recording medium.\n2. Answer your phone when they call back.  Schedule a time.\n3. Ask someone you enjoy conversing with to join you.  You'll be talking with them for a few hours while you sip a glass of water and Jacqueline beats eggs.\n4. Show up at that time, you'll probably be seated promptly.  The reverse side of this is that you'll probably be asked to leave if you've eaten and your table is reserved for a later seating.\n5. Sit down, order the French onion soup (you'll get one bowl and two spoons, so don't order this when accompanied by someone with questionable mouth biota), a dinner souffle, and a dessert souffle.\n6. Talk with your friend/lover for an hour or two, which won't be annoying because you've chosen an interesting date and you've come prepared for this step.  The waiters and your date are quietly judging your level of sophistication, so don't complain.\n7. Enjoy the great soup and a couple of amazing souffles.\n8.

I was surprised he suggested Cafe Jacqueline since he does not like eggs unless they're used for french toast or diced in fried rice..\n\nThe cafe is small so definitely make a reservation ahead of time. The inside is quaint, a single rose in a vase at each table that doesn't seat more than about 4 guests. \n\nThere were two waiters there that evening, one of whom was the more typical snooty type (when he asked if I wanted anything to start with and I told him I hadn't decided on what to drink, he responded, \"That's not what I asked.\") but fortunately he warmed up later when we complimented the food. The second waiter, brown hair and glasses, was just delightful. Warm and friendly, he helped pick an outstanding bottle of French wine for us.  And it was reasonably priced so that was a bonus.\n\nWe chose the French Onion Soup for the first course. While in France, my husband ordered it everywhere. The soup here trumps the French Onion soup in France.\n\nWe chose the Mushroom and Prosciutto souffle for our main course (large enough to serve two) and my heart stopped for a moment when the waiter plated our food as the souffle was obviously egg mixture all the way through. I thought my husband was going to be miserable. Fortunately, he has become more adventurous since meeting me. Upon first bite he absolutely LOVED it! He decided next time, he needs a souffle all to himself because half of it wasn't enough. This coming from a man who hates the smell, texture, taste of eggs.\n\nFor dessert, we got the chocolate souffle. This was a beautiful, light, fluffy piece just like the savory souffle but this is chocolate with a dusting of powdered sugar on top so of course this was amazing. This chocolate souffle is better suited to those who like dark chocolate as it is not too sweet. For me it was perfection.\n\nWe enjoyed the meal completely and it was a great start to our anniversary. Merci beaucoup Cafe Jacqueline! Tres manifique!", "author": "Nicole T."}

I kept wishing for corn or a kick somewhere in there. I enjoyed the strawberry souffle more because some pieces of fruit were sweet while others were tart--it was very balanced.\n\nWhile Cafe Jacqueline has not instilled me with patience, it has inspired me to look up recipes for souffles.

Yes, there really is a Jacqueline and she is on site  every evening, at least when we've been there. Her restaurant does one thing and one thing well: souffles. You won't find finer savory or sweet souffles anywhere outside of Paris. One dinner souffle satisfies 2-4 people. Share a dinner souffle and you'll have plenty of room for one of the exquisite dessert souffles. Just make sure to tell your server from the beginning that you intend to order a dessert souffle also so that they can time its arrival at your table. Don't forget to order Champagne of one of the other sparkling wines on Jacqueline's wine list. Nothing pairs with egg dishes like bubbly. Many locals like us make Cafe Jacqueline their special occasion restaurant. One bite and you'll understand why.

Share one of her strawberry souffles with your loved one on a romantic date and you will know what I mean. However, there is a lot more to Cafe Jacqueline than tasty souffles and a superb onion soup.\n\nHere is what I mean: My pregnant wife and I were traveling around the world for six months and simply never lost our craving for Jacqueline's strawberry souffles. After returning back to San Francisco, on our baby's official due date, my wife called Cafe Jacqueline to check if the strawberry souffle was on the menu that day and to reserved a table for two to celebrate our special day. As it so happened, Jacqueline herself answered the call and confirmed our table and the strawberry souffle on the menu. We could hardly wait.\n\nShortly after arriving at Cafe Jacqueline, our bliss abruptly ended. The waiter informed us that our craving wouldn't be satisfied today. \"No more strawberry souffles\". Well, what can you do, the restaurant was completely packed, guess we were just too late. We accepted our fate and ordered the mushroom and prosciutto souffle with extra tomatoes and decided to try the chocolate souffle as a dessert instead.\n\nThe main course was delicious. We both liked the saltiness of the prosciutto blending with the sweetness of the tomatoes and mushrooms. But seeing all the tables around us getting one strawberry souffle after another was kind of tough. It quickly turned into a running gag with our nice waiter who mentioned that Jacqueline indeed remembered a woman calling and explicitly asking for the strawberry souffle.\n\nWhen the dessert was finally served, we could hardly believe our luck. It wasn't the chocolate souffle we ordered. It was the strawberry souffle we had craved for so long. Jacqueline had managed to come up with one more out of nowhere. I am not sure how she did it, but I do know that I won't forget the perfect taste of her hot souffle with sweet strawberries and a little bit of powder sugar on my palate.\n\nSeth Godin once said you have to invest 10,000 hours to be great at anything. Jacqueline is way past that mark. That evening, we learned that she opened her cafe in 1979 and hasn't miss a single shift.

Not knowing the status of my request until just hours before the requested dinner time was frustrating.  The man who called me told me that they were too busy to listen to their phone messages.

In general the reviews tell all - quaint and cozy ambiance, hit-or-miss service, and expensive but delicious souffles that make it worth it all.\n\nMy boyfriend and I started with the soup du jour (a creative pairing of carrot and chestnut) and the french onion soup, healthy helpings of cheese perfectly browned on top. We then shared the lobster souffle, which at $60, was decadent and delicious. It was perfectly executed, light and fluffy, buttery with garlic, and with no shortage of lobster chunks. The waiter recommended a great bottle of Sancerre, which did a fine job of pairing with both our starter soups and our entree souffle. We finished with the grand marnier souffle and a glass of sauternes, full and satisfied. \n\nOne of the waiters was somewhat aloof and even smug, but to the point of actually being quite amusing. The other was good fun, helpful, and attentive. For the record, I hear a lot of complaints about \"French service\" but both were American.\n\nLastly, it's hard not to mention Jacqueline, the adorable elderly chef in the kitchen who makes all these souffles to-order.

I am a sucker for a good French onion soup and it does tend to be a smidgen salty here. I don't like salt, period, never use it and don't have any in my house so I am weird. And more importantly, an over salted edible screws up the taste of my wine. That said, I still order it time and time again. Why? Because it's the best. I don't care, its delicious in its caramelized overflowing deliciousness. Ditto for my fave, the corn garlic ginger souffl\u00e9. And all of the deserts are to die for- especially the strawberry souffl\u00e9. \n\nSecondly, I am amazed that anyone could give a negative review based on wait time! Its not McDonalds people, a French meal is is averagely timed at about an hour and a half (or something like that).  If you have a packed and scheduled night, simply plan accordingly if you are eating at Caf\u00e9 Jacqueline, just chill and bask in the atmosphere until your magnificent treats arrive. Souffl\u00e9s take time to make. Lots of time- I can say that this is one of the only restraints where I have sat for HOURS and I'm not the most patient person in the world. But like I said, that's how they do food in other parts of the world, kids- you know, in cities where dining is a social affair and people are not rushing through life so quickly they have a heart attack before they hit the age of 40. \n\nOK, so I agree that a few waiters here are rude beyond belief.  Which I could grasp (or simply deal with) if I was actually in Paris but ... Yes, these are some cantankerous ass waiters. Whatever, they are grumpy, I get it (or don't) but I don't care. \n\nIf you like souffles, incredibly rich food, an excellent wine list and beautifully intimate dining experiences, you really need to eat at Cafe Jacqueline at some point in your life.", "author": "Dolores A."}

My husband and I shared a wonderful chocolate souffle years back at the CIA-Greystone in St. Helena.  For multiple years and visits thereafter, we would go back and request the chocolate souffle to no avail.  My husband then secretly searched for alternative places to enjoy a generous chocolate souffle, and came across Cafe Jacqueline in San Francisco.  Much closer, and much more reliable!  He took me to Cafe Jacqueline on my birthday as a surprise, and it was quite a treat.\n\nFirst of all, they serve my favorite soup, French Onion, and unusually, they prepare it without the use of beef consomme, which makes it vegetarian.  For non-vegetarians - do not fear - it is just as tasty as the non-veg version served elsewhere!  Their house bread is very soft and chewy on the inside, and crusty on the outside, and they are generous with bread.\n\nTheir entrees are all souffle's and unless specified as including a different cheese, they all contain gruyere, one of my favorite cheeses.   We shared a mushroom-gruyere souffle as our entree, which was delicious\n\nTheir desserts are all souffle's, and of course, we chose chocolate.  I was tempted to try two flavors, but maybe next time...  The chocolate flavor was strong and the sweetness was just right.\n\nThe atmosphere was quiet, with occasional classical music in the background.  From time to time, one could hear the Kitchenaid mixer/grater in the background, from the tiny kitchen at the rear of the restaurant.  The waiters were attentive, and the dinner took approximately 2-3 hours, which was very relaxing.\n\nWe had diet sodas, which were a shocking $5 each, but otherwise, we were fully satisfied by our delightful dinner.", "author": "Dr. M."}

The prosciutto and mushroom souffle was also very good, it was nice to have a little bit of meat to go with the souffle.\n\nFor desserts, we got the chocolate (how could I not?) and strawberry, which was their fresh fruit souffle of the day.  We only got through around half of the chocolate since we were so full, but it was as good as I remember.  I didn't try the strawberry since I'm not into fruity desserts, but everyone else loved it, and actually ate more of it than the chocolate.\n\nTheir wine list is very reasonably priced, and we got 2 bottles at around $30 each.  The wines (cotes du rhone and minervois) weren't wow, but they went well with the food and were a good value.  If more places had good reasonably priced wines like this then we would never bring in our own wine.  \n\nStill don't understand the complaints about the service.

We split the onion soup, leek souffle and white chocolate souffle between 2 people.  The (French, duh) onion soup was fantastic; easily the best I've ever had.  The leek souffle was simple and cheesy and tasty.  The soup and entree souffle were somewhat salty but not excessively so.  At this point we were wondering if we should have ordered more food.  This notion was instantly shot down once we saw the size of the white chocolate souffle.  It was a bit bigger than the leek souffle and quite rich.  It was really enjoyable but I thought it lacked in the white chocolate department.  I would go with the fruit souffle next time (though the highly praised strawberry wasn't available).  We also had a bottle of C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne that was reasonably priced.\n\nI thought the service was really good.  Our server was pleasant and helpful.  I just wanted to mention this since so many people seem to be dogging on the European-style service employed at CJ.  Its slow and not overly attentive, which can be a tough adjustment for those who prefer the service at Applebee's, and lends to a more intimate feel.  Our dinner lasted a pleasant 2.5 hours.  \n\nOverall:  CJ was really good but the food (which is not cheap) didn't quite have what it took to reach 5 stars.  I rate it at 4.5 stars.  Save room for dessert!", "author": "Chris P."}

If you are a foodie with a love for time honoured tradition, if you appreciate the art of souffle making (oh and it is an art!), if you appreciate perfection of flavour and are prepared to accept that $35-$40 (split between two) is not just about food, but an experience then don't think - just book and embrace the atmosphere and experience of Cafe Jacqueline.\n\nThe restaurant is just as people describe: simple in it's elegance, romanticly lit by candlelit, cosy, warm, welcoming and feels distinctly French. Appetizers range upto $25.00, the main souffles from $30-$45 and the desserts $30-$40. Whilst you might balk at the prices, please don't! If you are all about the experience as well as taste of souffle, then avoid the appetizers and simply go for one savoury and one dessert (the dishes are made for two) - you will be full after both and if you appreciate the art of this food, you will feel entirely satisfied with what you have paid on leaving.\n\nWe chose a delicious Pouille-Foussy white wine ($45) to go with our mouth wateringly, heavenly, hallelujah-worthy main course special: a sumptious leek & chestnut souffle. Through our suprised and in awe smiles, the stifled moans of food-ecstasy, we savoured every mouthful until I actually felt sad to see just one last mouthful left. There is something poetic about Jacquelines souffles. Something sacred!\n\nWith time to relax, take it all in pre and post our main course (expect anywhere from a 2-3hour meal - these are made by one person, all to order remember), with more sips of our perfectly matched wine, out came the Lemon Souffle delivered by our waiter who i just loved - apparently the 'mean one'  (now my favourite meanie!) We promptly devoured the lemony, sweet, fluffy perfection and can only conclude it as a triumphant balance to the previous course.\n\nI totally and utterly love this restaurant. It is worth every penny as far as quality, experience, happiness and taste sensation goes. My favourite part was when I nipped to the ladies, through the Kitchen, I was able to thank and watch the legend that is Jacquline at her clearly loved work. After telling her the taste was like magic to me, I asked her 'how do you make them so light & fluffy'. And with a twinkle in her eye, she just replied in her gorgeous French accent 'one at a time!'.\n\nGo forth & find foodie heaven and make sure you get the 'mean' waiter. And remember, restaurants such as Jacequline come packed with personality so I say this: don't think too much, I'm sure every night is different, just smile and go with the flow and it'll be hard not to get carried away by the whole experience...", "author": "Emily C."}

Just let them know you are making a desert reservation when you call.  A complete meal here can drag a bit, even for the most romantic couple.

Where as say, a savory crepe/gallette is amazing if not preferrable to sweet desert crepe, salty (and at times a lil too salty) souffles feel like you're eating an oversized amuse/appitizer, and actually, at Jacqueline's, it's not that oversized... Speaking of which: salad prices are a little ridiculous. The oil is really good (how did you get that umami flavor in there... omg- it's warm SALTED isnt it?!), but for 10bux, can it separate itself with some tomatoes before slathering itself of that childhand portion of watercress (and I love my watercress!), but really, greens and oil?\n\nService is appropriate but the attitude is kinda not.\n\nThis place something close to an institution here in SF, but it's really more like a relic.

We arrived right on time for an 8pm reservation and were given menus immediately, though no one returned to share specials, take drink orders etc, for a while (I didn't check the time though and didn't let it bother me at that point). The waiter finally came over, explained what they had that evening and literally walked away as I asked a question --and apparently didn't hear me as he didn't come back. We waited and waited and he finally returned to take our food order, then said he'd be back for drinks, which I get, it's souffles, so they want to get them in the oven. The drinks came fairly quickly and my glass of champagne was filled to the brim, definitely a plus! My husband had a half-bottle of wine which was poured only one time by the waiter, not a huge deal, but overall, service was seriously lacking. I joked when we got home that I would be more tolerant of the nonchalant, arrogant service from French waiters, but from what I could tell, ours was not French.\n\nSo my husband thought they forgot our salads, but they finally came out at 9pm on the dot, again, we arrived at 8pm. The salads (spinach with goat cheese and spinach with pine nuts and bacon) were both really good. Bread was a bit too crusty/crispy for my taste. Salads were done within minutes, and then we waited, waited, looked back at the kitchen. The waiter never came to mention anything about our food. I know a few things about souffles and by no means expect them to be rushed but our dinner souffle didn't arrive until 9:45pm, again, with no check-in from the waiter. At that point I said we'd probably need to cancel our dessert order as we had a babysitter and at this rate, we wouldn't be home before midnight. He said he could cancel it, but I really wanted the dessert souffle so asked how long it would be and he said 'at least 45 minutes'. So for a 3-course meal, including 2 souffles, it would have been AT LEAST a 3-hour dinner. Our dinner at Saison was 3 hours and I think it was 17 courses...\n\nThe waiter sort-of apologized, saying something like 'I'm sorry about the time issue and that you won't be able to try our dessert souffle. We hope you'll come back to try another time.'\n\nWe were so looking forward to trying this place but to be honest, are more into sweet souffles versus savory so it was a huge letdown to leave without trying the chocolate souffle. I have to imagine an oven was broken or something but a little explanation goes a long way. My husband even said 'that's the worst service we've had in San Francisco'. We try a new restaurant (of similar quality) every Thursday and have eaten at a range of good, and great restaurants around that city and this experience was pretty disappointing.

Best onion soup ever!  The soup was perfectly flavored and perfectly cheesy.  One was enough to share for two but if I were to come again, I'd get my own!\n\nI don't know if I'm much of a souffl\u00e9 person, but this souffl\u00e9 was made for me.  The souffl\u00e9 was topped with a tons of thin slices of lemon which giving the zest I always need with my oysters.  I love trying things I've never tastes before and this was a very enjoyable experience.  The dessert souffl\u00e9 was a bit much for me, it had pretty much the same texture as my oyster entry so it was a bit odd.  It's like going straight from a beef burger to a chocolate covered strawberry burger.  Maybe next time I would stop in for a soup and dessert only :)", "author": "hanh b."}

And last night, I joined that growing legion. \n\nWe made reservations (recommended) for a party of four and were seated promptly in the quiet and intimate dining room, soft classical music the only background. I had brought a bottle of Mumm de Cramant, which our server promptly chilled for us (there is a $20 corkage fee, but well worth it with the right bottle!). \n\nThe menu is of course focused on souffles and I'd recommend going for the full experience. For us that meant splitting a fresh salad and the escargot starter - on the latter, all I can say is wow, I don't think I've had better. The savory souffles are meant for two, so we ordered two to share, and the prosciutto and mushroom was particularly tasty. For dessert, we again chose to split two, which at first seemed like overkill. However, just being able to taste the flavorful contrast between the chocolate and the fresh strawberry souffle was reason enough, and we actually ended up pretty much finishing up both anyway. \n\nI don't know how Chef Jacqueline does it, but obviously she's doing it right. She's a sweet woman herself, working every night, clearly in love in front of a stove. Go to the bathroom - which you get to through the kitchen - just to say hello, and mind the step!\n\nPerfect, as other reviewers have said, for a romantic evening, but I think just as good if not better with a close group of 4-6 friends. Our servers were great, but expect a long meal, this is not a rushed experience.

The savory souffles were very flavorful and they didn't skimp on any of the ingredients.  However, we were disappointed about how eggy they were.  We were surprised they almost had an undercooked omelette-like texture.  I've had yummy savory souffles in the past and I don't think the eggs should dominate the dish.  \n\nBut the fresh peach souffle made us forget all about the others!  After one bite, I wished we would've ordered another dessert souffle.  It was smooth, silky, oh so sweet, and not eggy at all.  I love the crusty, sugary parts too.

She commented that he reminded her of \"those waiters in France\".  But, she managed to get him to laugh when she asked about the cost of a bottle of wine & he told her some outrageous amt. as a joke.  After that, it was a much nicer evening. His co-waiter was very nice.  They kept our water glasses constantly filled but a couple of times, we refilled our wine glasses when they started to get real busy. \n\nI had the watercress salad, which was a small pile of watercress with dressing. The butter lettuce would've been a better choice.  I wanted to try the escargot but couldn't see paying $30 for a few gastropods when Chinatown was just blocks away & I could've ordered platefuls for that price. \n The French bread baguette was crunchy.  The brie and broccoli souffle was just as scrumptous and not as salty compared to our last visit. The proscuitto mushroom souffle was quite good.  I was expecting the ham to be baked into the souffle but 4 slices were folded, then topped over the baked souffle.  For dessert, we had the Grand Marnier.  It was light, fluffy and infused with the tasty liquor.  I still prefer the fruit souffles and smiled when I saw a strawberry souffle pass by to the next table.

Depending on the time of year, the seasonal fruit dessert souffle will vary from strawberry to peach to raspberry to kiwi. They're all wonderful. \n\nFavorites like lemon and white chocolate are staples available all year round (so is the chocolate, but I'm not a big fan since I can make my own chocolate souffles). I would not recommend getting the lemon and the white chocolate on the same visit, because then the lemon is just too tart.\n\nSome general advice: you need to call back and nag for reservations since they don't always return voicemail messages. The better bet is to call in the evening when they're open (Wed-Sun after 5:30). Also, the service staff and Jacqueline can be very brusque. I've been coming here for over 10 years, and it's always been like that. Because of the lengthy cooking time of the souffles, reservations can run behind, but don't expect them to be apologetic if they push you off for 30 or 45 minutes.\n\nThe place is very intimate and not good for large groups. There is a lot of downtime while the souffles are in the oven, so take that into consideration if you are on a first date. Also, very tiny, so make your reservations for weekends well in advance. Reservations used to be 1 month in advance at most, but recently my sister called in and was told that they are now taking 2 months.\n\nBtw, I've seen people try to drop in for dessert and walk out because of the price.

Charge people $30-50 per souffle (which can barely feed two relatively hungry people) and another $30 for a dessert souffle, and convince them that it's worth it because \"eet ees Flench!\"\n\nThe souffles themselves were underwhelming, and we ordered a spinach salad that was ridiculously small and uninspired considering how expensive it was.  The little woman in the back making the souffles one by one is cute, but the service was snotty and the food took so long to arrive that I thought they were still hatching the chicks that would grow into hens that would then lay the eggs.  It's also supposedly \"romantic\" but all that meant was it was a poorly painted (thus rustic) room with old wood floors and with a door that banged every time new customers came in.  I often wonder what criteria people use when they describe a place as \"romantic.\"  Perhaps it is romantic because \"eet ees Flench.\"\n\nAll in all, it was overrated and pretentious without the food to back it up - cardinal sins when it comes to restaurants!", "author": "Betsy T."}

We had eaten a late lunch that day, so we each limited ourselves to French onion soup for dinner, but we were really here for the dessert, which did not disappoint.  We went for the chocolate souffle, and it was divine.  The word \"fluffy\" does not do this souffle justice.  It was quite possibly the greatest dessert I have ever consumed.\n\nThe ambience in the place is simple, old-world, uncluttered and extremely romantic.  Our server sported an old-timey, turn-of-the-century mustache, which I have to say added to the whole experience.

This place is the perfect package for a lovely night out.\n\nThe food was incredible.  My husband and i shared the salmon-asparagus souffle as an entree and the white chocolate souffle for dessert.  The texture, taste, presentation, and size of both were perfect (two people can easily share the entree souffles and feel satisfied.  I would say 4 people can eat a dessert souffle and be satisfied).  It's pricy but well worth it, especially if you are sharing with others. \n\nThe feel of the place was really nice too.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that it can be perfectly suitable for a romantic dinner with my husband or a nice dinner with friends. \n\nWhat sealed the deal for me was the friendly disposition of everyone who worked at the restaurant.  Our waiter was thoughtful and helpful when taking care of us and of others.  The other waiter was also very approachable and helped our regular waiter take care of things for us.  We had nice exchanges with everyone working including Miss Jacqueline, who was lovely in person.  We greeted her in the kitchen and thanked her for the wonderful food she had prepared for us.  \n\nOverall, a magnificent experience.\n\nThe only downside is that there was about an hour wait on the first souffle and the second came about 30 min after we were done with the first one.  I really don't think it's a big deal because the quality of the food more than made up for it.  But it's not a place to go to if you are in a rush.", "author": "D R."}

Every time our waiter came and asked us if we were ready (there was 4 of us), he'd walk away.  Hardly ever making any eye contact before he would walk away again.  On top of that a lot of what was on the menu, \"they ran out\" .  We asked for 3 different bottles of wine and again \"we ran out\"  Mind you the restaurant opens only from Wed - Sun (dinner service only)  Plus there were only 4 other tables that were being occupied last night along with ours.  (Total of 10 tables)\n\nThe menu is made up most entirely of souffles.   They did have a few standard starters, such as hearty French onion soup (the ran out of) and a lightly dressed baby spinach salad (this was good). \n\nThe experience is to share a souffle for two.  Savory souffles are big enough to share, from the classical Gruyere cheese souffle to a creative pairing of salmon and asparagus, or shitake, garlic and basil (this was okay) and,  prosciutto and mushroom (ran out of) or the lobster souffle which was good but overpriced at $55. \n\nFor desserts, they offered a bittersweet-chocolate souffle and  fresh strawberry souffle (I recommend this)\n\nThe dessert was the only thing worth going there for.", "author": "Nestle L."}

The important ones are:-\n\nSouffle must be in the menu- as an entree or dessert.\n\nThe ambiance must exhibit a french taste and atmosphere.\n\nThe waiter must exhibit a certain \"je n'ai sais pas quoi\" air about them- (may it be their succinct and punctuated  \"oui oui\"  or that affirming cordial laugh followed by \" mais bien sur!\")\n\nAND most definitely a FRENCH COOK who still speaks in that audibly delicious, mellifluous  voice exclaiming- \"c'est merveilleux!\" :-)\n\nThis restaurant is a special place- where one oven, one blender, one cook and a whole lot  of eggs - produce these beautiful souffle's done to perfection!  It is unfathomable that each one ordered by the diners produced that same indelible mark of  a tan top hat  rising inches above  the white porcelain bowls.  If there is anything else used to suggest attention to detail- it would be attending to a souffle' while in the oven!\n\nThe ambiance reminds me of a french country cafe- lit with amber sconces and candles, table covered with white crisp table linens, joined by french country style chairs and roses that adorned the vases.  With the sound of Mozart in the air, one can only think- quelle bonheur!\n\nI don't  think anyone can go wrong with the souffle' choices...My personal favorite (without the having had the others) is the LOBSTER!!! Chunks after Chunks of sweet succulent slices of tender meat- wrapped in that warm spongy egg cake.

This is the resturant I recommend to out of town guests and friends for the incredible food and wonderful service/atmosphere.  There is a learning curve here.  Two people do not need two dinner soufles and a dessert soufle along with either soup or salad.  We made that filling mistake the first time.  \n\nAny time you make reservations later in the evening (after 6-7) expect to wait a bit due to the people before you (the knowledgeable ones who come at 5:30) taking their well deserved two to three hours to enjoy a wonderful meal and conversation.

Endive salad or red pepper soup also good.\n\nThe souffles ...   OMG   Procuitto and asparagus, gruyere, fruits de mer, shitake mushroom, crab, etc.  Heavenly, light but filling and they're SOUFFLES they take a good 45 minutes to prepare and serve.

Yee HAH  raspberry, strawberry, chocolate, grand marnier,lemon, etc.!  \n\nTips   .. for 5 people    3 dinner and two dessert souffles plus soups or salads...   Share the souffles with the whole table! (you could add another dessert souffle if you're really decadent.)\n\nJacqueline is a most gracious chef and a wonderful person.  Nat (the head waiter) has been with her for years and is a gem also, very knowledgeable about what wine goes with what dinner!\n\nSo don't be in a hurry, allow 3 plus hours and order a glass of wine or a kir and relax  for a great meal.  \n\nAnd once you figure it out (don't be afraid to ask someone who looks like a regular)  You'll be hooked!   &*)", "author": "Glen B."}

I've called 3 times and they always said, \"We're fully booked\" and they cannot take reservation for more than 2 people.

I've never heard of such a thing so when my boss told me about Cafe Jacqueline, I was intrigued. It's a small cozy restaurant and there are only about 12-15 tables. I wouldn't come here with a large group. Think intimate. Your souffles aren't made until you order them (duh) so a full dinner here can take over 2 hours. While you wait for the souffle, you can have French onion soup, salad, or escargot if they are available.\n\nThe souffle can be split by two people--I'd split it with three to save room for dessert! The dessert souffles are huge and you can split those by 4 people.\n\nThe first time I went here, I was in heaven with a full souffle meal--I think it was the novelty. The second time, I got a little tired of the souffle texture for an entire meal. I would come back here in a heartbeat for a dessert reservation though. The strawberry souffle was amazing. It came out covered in hand sliced strawberries and sprinkled with powedered sugar. You can call and let her know you just want to come for dessert and she'll allot your group with an hour. You can drink champagne while you wait for your creation to be made. Reservations should be made a week in advance since she is closed Monday and Tuesday. By the time Wednesday rolls around, the weekend slots are all booked.\n\nDon't forget to make a trip to the restroom at some point in the night.

I came here with some friends after it was highly recommended and touted as the best souffles in town. Ordered the Grand Marnier and Chocolate dessert souffles and was severely disappointed.

That's a whole lotta hype to live up to and I don't even think it comes close.\n\nI'm guessing these outrageous prices reflect the limited foot traffic and patronage. When you're making customers occupy each table for 2-3 hrs, I guess for damn sure you better charge an arm and a leg to make up for the lost business.\n\nIf not for the beautiful ambiance with dark, yet candlelit tables, I might have given this place a one star.

The main food item here is the souffle. You choose what kind of souffle you want (they're probably ALL delicious but we had the broccoli and cheese and it was gooooood). This giant souffle comes out (for two) and it's this warm, fluffy, beautiful thing... Dessert is also souffle, chocolate. I have to say this was one of those dinner experiences that I will always remember. You need a reservation though because it's a small place, and there's one woman in the back making all of this food.\n\nPlease do yourself a favor and go to Jacqeline's.

It was hands down the best dessert I've ever had in my life!!! (the second best being my own creme brulee:)  The onion soup was also the best I've ever had, no I'm not exaggerating!\n\nVery cozy and romantic atmosphere, perfect for a date you'd like to impress.  The 45 minutes for each souffle to be served provides an opportunity for you to interact and know your date better in the cafe's seductive environment.  It took 2 hours and 20 minutes for our meal as we were the second table of the night, be prepared to spend up to three hours here if you have more parties arrive before you.\n\nService was a bit snooty, but it didn't get on my nerves for some reason.

Make sure that you have at least 3 hours worth of conversation topics with your date or friend or else you will be bored to death of waiting and waiting!! \n\nWe started off with a French Onion soup.  I'm usually not a huge fan of French Onion, but this was delicious!! Lots of melted cheese (try not to think about the thousands of calories that you will be consuming throughout the night).\n\nWe waited for a while (almost an hour) before we got our Lobster souffle (this is large enough to share). We noticed that they come out in batches. We got our food at the same time that another couple got theirs. There were sooo many chunks of lobster in there.

I had always postponed due to the \"special occasion\" this small restaurant seems to merit.  It's also expensive!  On a whim, I called last minute and was able to secure a 7PM reservation.  We were promptly seated at our table and about 2.5 hrs later...we were generally disappointed.  I so wanted to enjoy this restaurant and expected to give it a 5 star rating but alas...what a let down.\n\nDecor - 4 stars - Small and cute.  It could've been better lit but I guess it's supposed to be \"romantic.\"  A woman at the table next to us even had to request an extra candle since she couldn't read the menu.\n\nService - 4 stars - Quite attentive and nice.\n\nFood - 2 stars - I was looking forward to the fluffiness that everyone raves about.  Nope, did not encounter said fluffiness.  Our souffles were not very fluffy at all and one was absolutely runny even.  It would've been nice if there were more meat souffles on the menu too.  We ordered...\n\n-French Onion Soup - This was excellent!  You sort of have to order some appetizers to start since the souffles take quite a while to make.\n-Corn ginger garlic souffle - The waiter said this was one of their signature souffles.  It was underwhelming but ok.  The corn was very sweet and I loved the ginger flavor but it just wasn't that light and fluffy.\n-Prosciutto mushroom souffle - Again, not fluffy enough for me and extremely salty.  The souffle just seemed like a mushy mess.  Pass.\n-Chocolate souffle - We added this extra dessert souffle even though we knew it was more than what we could eat.  The Yelp reviews touted this as the most popular dessert so we felt like we \"had\" to order this even though I'm not a big chocolate person.  It was extremely RUNNY!  I even asked the waiter if this is how it's supposed to be and he stated that it was indeed intended.  ?!?  Ok, I'm no souffle expert but I thought souffles were supposed to be light and fluffy, no?  It was like a chocolate soup inside.  At $33, I think it was a rip off.\n-Strawberry souffle - This is the seasonable fruit souffle and it was the only shining light in the evening's picks.  The flavor was outstanding and while not that light, it was probably the fluffiest of the bunch.  I would come back to order this for dessert again.\n\nToo bad.  I wish I liked this place more.  : (  Maybe it was an off night?", "author": "Jennifer I."}

Upon stepping in, we were greeted with soft classical music and a friendly waiter who offered to take our coats and seated us.  The interior of the restaurant had some beautiful lights, and created a perfect atmosphere for quiet conversation.\n\nWe began with a nice half bottle of white wine, and had some delicious figs wrapped in prosciutto, which were cut and presented resembling 3 flowers.  I had read how long the souffles took and made sure to order those to tide us over, and I'm glad I did!\n\nThis really is key: you really SHOULD NOT come here if you are trying to get in and out.  The food takes so long to prepare because it is made fresh, so expect to spend at least 2 hours waiting in anticipation.  But when it arrives, what a treat!\n\nWe ordered the Lobster souffle, and when it arrived there was a great ceremony of dividing it up for us.  The souffle was good, but I don't know if it was $50 good!  Next time I think I'll try a cheaper one.  The dessert souffle was tasty too, but we were so full from the first souffle that we couldn't really finish.\n\nAll in all a costly (end bill for dinner for 2 was around $150) but very pleasant dining experience!", "author": "Corey C."}

This was of course good news, because if a souffle place is making excellent salads it is only up from there for the main course! I had the leek chestnut for my main, which was the perfect balance of flavors and textures. Somehow both light and heavy, very savory, and perfect in terms of portion. For dessert I had the chocolate souffle, which I was actually surprised that it wasn't my favorite. It was very good, but the star of the show was the main course. If you want a phenomenal chocolate souffle, head to Alexander's, but this place was solidly very good from start to finish. I also loved that you walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom, where you can see the biggest bowl of eggs I've ever seen, and the cutest older French woman making her magic!

The restaurant is run by Madame Jacqueline, a darling older French lady with a delightful accent and a talent for making decadent and delicious souffles. \n\nMy husband and i visited here last night for our first wedding anniversary. It was our second visit to Cafe Jacqueline and it was even better than the first time we went there about a year and a half ago. \n\nThe first time, we got the spinach and gruyere souffle, the chocolate souffle and the grand marnier souffle. Yes, we were gluttons! \n\nThis time, we started with an apertif of white Lillet with an orange slice in it. Bonus to this restaurant for having a heavy pour! \n\nWe then moved onto the onion soup appetizer, which was truly some of the best onion soup I've ever had. Dip some of the wonderful crusty French baguette in the broth too....it is oh so yummy and divine.\n\nFor our entreee, we had the white corn, ginger and garlic savory souffle. OMG, it was soooooo good. I liked this more than the spinach one we got last time, even though that was delicious too. The slightly crunchy texture of the corn with the creaminess and fluffiness of the souffle is wonderful. \n\nFor dessert, we had to do the grand marnier souffle again. It is one of the best tasting desserts I've ever had and could probably eat one every night if it wouldn't make my thighs look like souffle too!\n\nI'm not sure what the quality of the wine list is. The two times we've been there, we've brought our own bottle of Veuve Cliquot champagne ($35 at Safeway or $33 each for a six-pack!) and paid the $20 corkage fee. \n\nThis is a very small restaurant with only I think eight two-seater tables, one six-person table and three four-person tables. The lighting is low and romantic with roses on every table. The rest of the decor is very simple. Nothing on the walls to really speak of. \n\nMadame Jacqueline is the real deal and makes all the souffles with a staff of two sous chefs and two waiters running the front of the house. I highly recommend visiting this place while it lasts. I don't know when Madame Jacqueline plans to retire, but once she does, there will no longer be a Cafe Jacqueline!  \n\nKeep in mind that souffles take about an hour to cook, so you should plan to order your entire meal -- appetizer, entree and dessert -- all at once so they can time your meal properly. If you're someone who likes to eat and run, this isn't the restaurant for you.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-07-30", "description": "Okay . . . my fiance and I went in on a Thursday for dinner.  Our reservation was for 7:00 pm and we arrived about 15 minutes early and were greeted by the waiter with the handle-bar mustache who seated us promptly.  While he was seating us we both noticed \"his aroma\".  Putting it mildly, his body odor was enough to make you gag if you smelled it for a prolonged period.  He gave us menus and said he'd be back to take our order momentarily.  When we were ready to order wine we tried to get the other waiter (tall blonde guy) to take our order but when we started to tell him what we had selected \"The Mustache\" shoved him out of the way and told us he would be taking our order.  My girlfriend literally put the collar of her blouse over her nose while I tried to look down and keep my head turned the other way while taking shallow breathes through my mouth so I wouldn't have to smell him.  I kid you not, his b.o. was horrific.  We ordered an onion soup to share,  the lobster souffle for our entree,  and the seasonal fruit souffle for dessert which was strawberry.  All of their dishes including the onion soup are big enough to share between 2 people.  After I gave him our order and he left to place it in the kitchen my girlfriend asked if I had seen his vest.  She said it was literally crusted with what we're guessing was dried food.  I informed her I hadn't because I was looking away so as not to smell him.  She said it reminded her of Monica Lewinsky's dress to which we both started laughing so loud the other diners shot us looks.  We also gave \"The Mustache\" the nick-name \"Musty\" for short.  When he came back with our wine he opened it and put the bottle back in the fridge so anytime we wanted to re-fill our glasses we had to call him over.  We kept trying to get the other waiter to assist us but if he came over \"Musty\" would jump in and ask if everything is okay.  I guess the other guy was a food runner or something.  He smelled nice and was clean btw.  This is a true classic french bistro with a true classically trained cordon-bleu chef to run it.  Please feel free to insert the obvious joke about the french and their bathing habits.  We did.  On top of this the week that we chose to dine ther was one of the warmest in recent memory and the restaurant is not air conditioned nor ventilated really.  Anytime \"Musty\"came to a neighboring table we were forced to hold our breathe.  At one point the gentleman from another table got up and opened the door which was welcomed by everyone seated in this small room. Less than 30 seconds after the door was opened \"Musty\" comes in from the kitchen and shuts it.  The gentleman who opened it asked if it could be left open for a little breeze to which \"Musty\" rudely replied  \"NO ! because it screws up the oven flame.\"  ? ? ?  W T F.  Is it an easy bake oven?  When he said this everyone in the place all gave each other quizical looks, while \"Musty\" smirks and struts into the kitchen.  I kid you not.  On to the food . . . the onion soup was the single best onion soup that either of us had ever tasted in our entire lives.  It was what I imagine food in heaven will be like if it it happens to exist.  It took about 45 minuted to come but we were prepared to wait that long as we had read reviews prior to dining here.  It was phenominal.  Really.  After another 45 minutes we got our dinner souffle.  Again,  food of the gods !  Lots of chunks of lobster,  tender and succulent,  seasoned to perfection and that rich buttery texture that the flesh of a fresh lobster gives you.  Not overly fishy or briny.  We had read reviews on here that the chef over-salted her food but that was not the case with either of our savory dishes.  The he presentation was simple and not overdone.  Jacueline truly is an artist.  about another hour for the dessert souffle but between the wine and conversation the time flew.  Make sure you go with someone you love or atleast like and be prepared to have a couple of hours of chatter.  The strawberry souffle was light, airy, and the perfect balance of sweet and mildly tart which a strawberry should have.  (atleast in my opinion)  It was heaped with fresh sliced strawberries on top.  .  Food wise this is on of our top 5 meals we have ever had as a couple.  The waiter was what killed the meal for both of us.  We can deal with mediocre service if the food is superlative, which this was beyond a doubt.  But when the waiter is downright rude,  and smells like an old gym bag that has been allowed to ferment that's a deal breaker.  We won't be back.", "author": "Robert K."}

It just wasn't filling, chocolatey, or mouth-watering enough as a dessert should be! some might argue that a souffle is suppose to be light since its pretty much just beaten eggs and sugar? but its chocolate!!!! chocolate is suppose to be rich! maybe im just not a souffle fan. or maybe it was also partially because of the horrible service I endured that cast a dark moody cloud over the romantically lit cafe which prevented me from enjoying my meal.\n\nprobably NEVER going back.... service here was dreadful! my friend made reservations for 10pm to have dessert, but he insisted we had made it for 9pm, so as soon as we walked in, he said we were late! and it looked like he wanted to refuse to serve us in their empty not even close to crowded cafe!!!! not only was this particular waiter rude! but he never once smiled or welcomed us from the moment we walked in. his face was wrinkled the whole night from his frowning. talk about a PMS-ing male waiter!!! the whole time i felt like he hated us and probably shat in our waters. he just made us feel like we were in trouble allllll night, for a mistake he made in messing up our reservation time!", "author": "Sue Y."}

When people write about souffles, they really are talking about souffles.  Big, honking, leave you \"stuffed\" with French-exquisiteness souffles.  Yes, we are a Chinese couple, but after spending three hours at this establishment, we turned into a \"oui.\"  \n\nWe had the French onion soup and soup du jour for starters.  Very, very good soups.  The French onion soup was a bit cheesy, but once you get into the soup-part, it's like drinking onion nectar.  Very delish.  A had a green bell pepper puree soup.  A said it was much better than split pea (he was referring to the fact that it looked like split pea soup).  \n\nWe shared the salmon and asparagus souffle.  It was ginormous.  As we were waiting (yes, it's quite a wait) for our entree souffle, we started noticing how big other people's souffle was.  It intimidated us, even A, whose stomach is elastic like Mr. Fantastic (like the rhyme?).  You can taste the protein (from the egg whites) oozing out of each savory bite.  A is not a fan of entree souffles, but he had to admit it was a good, filling meal.\n\nWe waited another hour for our dessert souffle-- chocolate.  A had never failed a dessert mission before!  But he did yesterday.  We left the dessert souffle 80% finished.  The dessert souffle needs to split at least three ways.  Two people CANNOT finish the dessert-- unless you're an eating champion of some sort.\n\nThe ambiance is very home-y.  If you're wondering about the \"dressy\" attire that it says in Yelp, don't worry... it's actually pretty casual.  Wear a nice pair of designer jeans with some Diesels and you should be fine.  Just don't come in after a 45-min jog in Asics and a sports bra.\n\nBottom line: long wait, but a quality meal.  Parking is horrible, but that's with any restaurant in North Beach.  Expect to pay at least $100 for two people (without wine).", "author": "Kel S."}

You feel like you are in another time and place - like Paris circa 1945 (due to the war torn views of North Beach through the gigantic plate glass windows.) The concept is so unique. The food is all amazing. The grandma in the kitchen with her stand mixer, freshly chopped herbs, slabs of cheese, and grand daddy bowl of eggs is like out of a movie or something. The atmosphere is very romantic and it's fun to hang out on the back patio in between courses on a warm evening. The service takes time to appreciate. At first, I thought that the one waiter that we always seem to get was a total jacka$$. He seemed snobby. But, after a while and upon more visits, he's cool enough and can recommend some great wines. \n\nDinner at Cafe Jacqueline takes longer than a dinner at French Laundry. At first, I was starving, which leads to anger. But then I realized that I am in Paris, it's 1945, and I am getting a custom made souffle that's the size of a basketball for dinner, made by some grandma in the back. She makes it with love, and that takes time.", "author": "Leah A."}

I was kicking myself when I had this because I lost three hours waiting for all the other dishes when I could have just ordered this instead. This dish is really really good because it is not super sweet and very fragrant. From what I can tell, they used Fresh white peach, Peach schnapps and peach skin. The crust was perfect! I was actually finding myself scratching the sides of the corning ware for the crumbs and pieces. :P \n\nService:\nJust think you are actually eating in Paris and you won't be offended cause the waiters certainly has some attitude.

No complaining is the norm here.\n\nWe had the pepper soup of the day instead of the regular French onion soup.  It came pretty fast and also didn't disappoint us.  We had the simple salad of butter lettuce.  It's not fancy but we're sure the veggies came from quality source and well preserved by the cafe and tossed in dedicated hands.\n\nBf ordered the spinach souffle.  It's light, but full of flavor.  That's the longest wait during the whole night.  The portion was good for 2 - 3 people sharing if you want to save room for dessert.\n\nThey ran out of every special dessert choice early in the evening already.  Maybe everyone opt for the specials since they're not commonly found in other places.  So we ordered the lemon on the regular menu since the chocolate and Grand Marnier souffle were not new to us.  After first bite, I no longer regret missing the special menu b/c it was SO good.  Light + Refreshing....\n\n\nDuring the wait, we enjoyed the simple cafe design.  The long stem roses in glass bottle against the green wall really reminded me of petite street cafe in France.\n\nI think it's a good place for its souffle dessert if we would like to skip 2.5 hour wait.

Cafe Jacqueline is a charming little French place tucked away in North Beach. After reading some of the Yelp reviews, I was concerned that our servers were going to be rude but they were very friendly and gracious. They took our coats and even remembered which ones belonged to us when we left.\n\nFor starters, we had the French onion soup. It was good but nothing exceptional. Hot, oniony, appropriately cheesy. \n\nThen came our corn, ginger, and garlic souffle. I've never had a real souffle before and wasn't sure what to expect. The top part of the souffle is much saltier, tinged with burnt cheese, and has almost a popcorn consistency to it. The innards of the souffle are pale, soft and fluffy, almost like \"hot angel food cake\" (my boyfriend's assessment) and tasted like corn-y egg scramble. I normally dislike ginger but didn't mind its presence here. It went well with the corn and garlic and the overall lightness of our souffle. I'm no souffle expert but I decided that I liked it enough to eat it again. \n\nThe best part of our meal was definitely the lemon souffle. Huge and covered in a snow of powdered sugar and lemon zest, it was like eating a hot lemon cloud. It was just sweet enough and there was molten lemon curd at the bottom for even more sugary goodness. Be careful with all the powdered sugar, though. Both of us experienced small coughing fits from inhaling.\n\nWe arrived at 6:05 and were out at 8:30. It is an intimate little place with dim lights and roses in a heart-shaped vase at your table. Don't come here with someone you can't talk to for two and a half hours. Also, the portions are really for two people so plan to share. \n\nOverall it was a very pleasant experience. I will definitely go back to try the other dessert souffles. I don't eat crab but the crab souffle is #61 on 7x7's \"100 Things to Try Before You Die\". Probably worth checking out for you seafood lovers.", "author": "Annie C."}

Everything feels so personal, as if your aunt decided to open a restaurant in her den.\n\nThe wine list is hand selected and its inconstancies are absolutely charming. Yes, you read that right. You can tell it was formed by a wine lover, not a professional sommelier (which normally would deduct stars, but in a setting this homey, it feels necessary. You wouldn't dare fault your aunt for favoring Chablis over Pinot Gris, would you?). It's almost as though certain vineyards didn't make the list because their solicitors just weren't \"nice\" to Jacqueline. At least that how I imagine it.\n\nOnto the food, which really needs no more description than most Yelpers have already gone to say. Everything is cooked to perfection, and if you get curious, just walk through the kitchen en route to the rest room and say hello to Jacqueline. I highly recommend the cauliflower souffle, ask to have a bit of garlic in there, and if feeling adventurous you can also substitute brie for the standard gruyere.\n\nYou cannot skimp out on dessert.

I swear I was chewing my spoon there was so much yummy, gooey cheese on it with every sip.  We had the corn and ginger souffle, and it was so incredible.  I was really looking forward to a nice cup of coffee to enjoy with the chocolate souffle, but that's where this review drops to 4 stars.\n\nWe waited about 10 minutes before our waiter brusquely served us water and gave us menus.  After he took our orders, it was about 45 minutes until we got our starters.  We slooowly enjoyed them, knowing that souffles take a lot of time to bake to perfection.  After another hour, we're ordering more wine, and gently asking about the status of our entree.  \"It takes 45 minutes to make a souffle, so we must be patient.\"  Hmph.  It came out moments later, and it was great.  OMG, but wait!  Are we going to have to wait another hour for dessert?  I am already SO sleepy.  Our waiter let us know that it will be a while longer for the dessert, so we can opt out if we'd like.  We did, and I wasn't able to enjoy what I was most looking forward to.  Will maybe have to do another stop here just to get dessert.", "author": "Karen C."}

Keep in mind that there are 2 waiters for 10 tables but we got pretty good waiting service.  Our glasses of water was always full!\n\nThe bread was nice and warm-right out of the oven!  The souffles are made fresh from scratch.  The minute you order your food, you see a cute old woman in the back with a chef hat cracking the eggs and rolling bread!  You should definitely order some appetizers or salad while waiting for your souffle, but it is definitely worth the wait!  We ordered the Shiitake, Basil and Garlic-which is yummy and perfect for a party of two.  I couldn't really taste the mushroom or garlic but my partner did.\n\nMy favorite was the chocolate souffle which was oozing with warm chocolate inside!  We were stuffed from the bread, salad and SBG souffle so we didn't finish our dessert and took half of it home.  I must say that the chocolate souffle was also VERY GOOD cold.  It was like eating a chocolate mousse cake.  I would definitely come here again to try different souffles!\n\nBTW, I noticed that some people have mentioned this as a \"date\" place but I want to mention that I saw a family of 3 and a group of 4 female friends at the restaurant.\n\nAlso I want to mention that there are a few bars on the same street that look pretty cool.

What's great is that the chef uses an onion base, rather than beef or chicken broth. I would guess the onions were roasted for an eternity to get such a rich broth. Whatever the technique, it's a great twist on an old classic.\n\nWe tried three souffl\u00e9s: two at dinner, and we brought one home for the next day. All were prepared in a meticulous manner, with the crab souffl\u00e9 having generous amounts of crab. The Grand Marnier souffl\u00e9 stood out as the most memorable, so good that I would likely forsake dessert at other Telegraph Hill restaurants to make the after-dinner trip here. It'd be worth the wait (plus the souffl\u00e9 is so filling, you'd likely need the preparation time to rejuvenate your appetite).\n\nThe prosciutto/mushroom souffl\u00e9 stood up well overnight in the fridge and tasted wonderful cold for brunch the next day. \n\nAs others have noted, make this the main event for an evening as it takes time preparing souffl\u00e9s to order.", "author": "Darrin K."}

He did not only come off like a complete jerk when failing to recommend a bottle but when I asked which bottle he was referring to on the menu he feverishly pointed at the menu and gave up by saying \"oh I'm not really sure\". He walked away, came back a moment later with a glass and said \"here taste it\"... Had it not been our early valentines day dinner I would have walked out. \n\nSure maybe he had a bad night, maybe he caught his girlfriend in bed with some other waiter or maybe he's just normally like that but I will forever deem this place as the worst service I've ever encountered.

My wife and I had a fantastic meal here: she had French Onion soup and I had a bowl of fantastic puree of leek soup, which was the soup du jour. We shared the Prosciutto and Mushroom souffle for dinner and a chocolate souffle for dessert. Both were excellent.\n\nThe key to a good experience here is to know what to expect: the only entrees are souffles, so if that isn't for you then come only for dessert (also souffles) or don't come at all. As others have said, it take a long time to eat, so be prepared to spend the whole evening. Make a reservation in advance--you probably won't be able to just walk in. Most important, get an *early* reservation. We were the second party seated for the evening (6PM reservation) and I heard the waiter say they were out of the soup du jour when the fourth party of the evening was ordering. When you make a reservation, call between 4 and 5PM so that you can talk to a live person before the service has started. Yelp's attire choices are too limited--I wouldn't want to show up in shorts, but this is California after all so you don't really need to be \"Dressy\".\n\nStreet parking in this neighborhood is impossible, but there are cheap garages available over closer to Chinatown (Vallejo St).\n\nIt's a little pricey, but makes a great \"special occasion\" restaurant for 2-4 people.

Then we ended our dinner with the chocolate souffle split between 4 people which was very light and pretty tasty.  We were all pretty full when we rolled out of that place.  \n\nI would give this place 3.5 stars if I could but I rounded up because the service wasn't bad and the place was clean and very quaint.  Next time I go, I'd probably only want to try their blueberry souffle after a cheaper meal somewhere else.  \n\nMerci Chef Jacqueline!", "author": "Kristie G."}

We had our first date here, our rehearsal dinner here and our first anniversary dinner here.  We went there tonight with two of her cousins and again we were not disappointed.  We had a fantastic meal, great service and spent 3 wonderful hours enjoying the company we were with.\n\nFor those who don't know, do NOT go expecting a fast meal.  You WILL wait for food - and it will be worth the wait.  From the time you order expect that it will take at least an hour to get your first souffle - everything is done to order and is fresh made.  Souffle's take time to make and time to bake.  It's all served direct out of the oven - there are no heat lamps or \"guessing\" when you'll be ready.  \n\nThey bring you warm crusty french bread that is great.  The salads are simple and delicious.  The onion soup is among the best I've had.  \n\nThis is also unlike most other restaurants in that the mostly french wine list is very reasonably priced - we had a nice bottle of French Chardonnay for $30.\n\nTonight the four of us shared two dinner souffles - Lobster, which was fantastic - it was like a lobster thermidor souffle... the other one was prosciutto and mushroom that was also delicious.  For dessert we had the strawberry souffle - it's covered on top with fresh ripe strawberries and is incredibly light and fluffy.  My wife is a chocoholic and loves the chocolate souffle - but actually prefers the strawberry - it's the only time she'll order a fruit dessert over chocolate.\n\nSo when you're looking for a 2.5-3 hour meal and just want to enjoy a leisurely evening of dining and enjoying the company you're with, this is the place to go.", "author": "Mark P."}

It's extremely pretentious and stuffy.  This includes the guests and the staff.  It's a shame, because the ambiance is charming and quaint...but the rigid atmosphere is almost unbearable.  It was a bit nerve-wracking, actually.\n2.  I found out after dining here that I'm not a big souffl\u00e9 fan.  The $55 lobster souffl\u00e9 was mediocre at best (the lobster seemed like it was frozen and not fresh), and the dessert souffl\u00e9 was undercooked and soupy (at least in my opinion).\n3.  I felt like the service was inconsistent between tables;  i.e.- other tables were getting five star treatment and we were getting the short end of the stick the whole dinner.\n4.  If you come here, be sure to block out a 3 hour window, because I definitely would not use the word \"quick\" to describe our experience.\n5.  The $10 spinach and goat cheese salad is literally just that- dry spinach with some goat cheese shavings on top.  Be sure to request extra dressing.\n\nI will give them this- they selected a nice wine for me that I really enjoyed, and they had great bread. And, my boyfriend said their French onion soup was the best he's ever had.  But, don't fall for the \"French lemonade\" recommendation...it's really just French 7up.

Our table was not yet ready at our reserved time, but the waiter could not have been more gracious in accommodating us.  While we waited next door at the Savoy he came over and took our dinner order in advance so we would not have to wait for our food when finally seated.  He also comped one of our desserts to repay us for the wait, which was a nice touch.  The first course salads were cold, crisp and fresh and delicious paired with the hot crispy french bread.  We tried a few of the special entree souffles of the night and each one was better than the next...the leek and chestnut was especially delicious.  The lime souffle for dessert (a new addition) was incredible...sweet, tangy and luscious.  As always the hard working Jacqueline was in the kitchen with her giant mixer whirling at top speed.  Our dinner took over three hours but we expected that...you have to get into a \"european\" mindset when visiting this restaurant.  Savor the experience, the company and lots of good wine...whats the rush?  \n\nJust a note to the ladies:  please no jeans and sweatshirts like we saw on someone here--that is just so tacky.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-03-12", "description": "I recently dined at Cafe Jacqueline with the hubby for his birthday.  Neither of us have had much experience eating souffles, so we really didn't know what to expect.  Fortunately, we had consulted Yelp prior to arriving, so we knew that the dinner event would last approximately 2.5 hours.  \n\nFirst, the decor of the restaurant is very European, and correspondingly very intimate.  There aren't a ton of tables in this place--consider it the anti-Cheesecake Factory.  There was one server waiting on approximately a dozen tables, with about half the tables being occupied.  Based on the suggestion of other Yelpers, the hubby and I each went to the restroom, which is located past the kitchen and through a courtyard.  As you go by the kitchen, you'll see a gigantic bucket of eggs, along with Chef Jacqueline herself plugging away at her specialty.\n\nSecond, the wait time was indeed long, compared to other restaurants.  That said, souffles take a long time to make, and an even longer time to make properly.  So, as other Yelpers have said, don't come here unless you arrive with good conversational company.\n\nThird, as for the food, we think it was pretty good, but we realized that perhaps our palates simply didn't like souffles that much.  We started with the onion soup (which is just called onion soup, not French Onion Soup, just like ordering a burger is just asking for a burger, not an American Burger).  The soup was quite tasty, and surprisingly vegetarian.  I would have preferred it to be made with beef stock, but it was good nevertheless, albeit very salty.  We ordered a crab souffle, which had real pieces of crab.  The souffle itself tasted great, with just the right amount of lemon for some kick.  Similar to the onion soup, the souffle also suffered from being oversalted.  I think I drank a gallon of water in one meal.  Finally, we shared a chocolate souffle.  The dessert souffles are gigantic, and simply much too big for 2 people--I'd recommend it more for 4 people.  It appeared to be made very well, but the hubby and I probably would have preferred a less refined dessert, like a big fat brownie and some ice cream.  That said, based on what I know about souffles (which is admittedly little), if you like souffles, I'm pretty sure that you'll love the chocolate souffle here.\n\nWe're happy we tried authentic French souffles, but it's not really our thing.  But if it's your thing, you definitely need to try this joint, because everyone else seemed to love it!", "author": "Alexis N."}

We were going to try the salmon & asparagus, however, after speaking to our waiter, we switched over to the leek. Me and the hubby love leeks - and this just made us heart them a million times more! The dessert quiche - seasonal peach (and thank you Jacqueline for using white peaches ...such delicate flavor!) I felt like I was eating warm clouds of summery goodness! Not to mention that Jacqueline decorated the peach quiche with a ring of sliced peaches - without the slightest disturbance to it's perky form! WOW! \n\n4) The onion soup - ok I'd read about it and was interested to try it. OMG - I've gone to ooey, gooey cheesy onion heaven. When the waiter came to take my bowl, I said \"Please do, before I make a spectacle and start chipping away at the crispy cheese on the bowl.\" Without missing a beat he said \"I do that too. I'll be back in a few minutes.\" I abstained and laughed ...but I must say he earned a special place in my heart for that!

Lots of butter.\n\nThey bake their own bread, which comes out warm with a crispy crust - very nice.\n\nWe ordered the Prosciutto Souffl\u00e9 and were disappointed.  The Prosciutto was draped across the top of the souffl\u00e9 - we had expected it to be incorporated into the souffl\u00e9.  The prosciutto was VERY salty.  Also, since the prosciutto was warm from being draped across the souffl\u00e9, it tasted like ham.  The top of this souffl\u00e9 also tasted burnt.  \n\nWe ordered the amaretto and hazelnut souffl\u00e9 for dessert.  We liked that alot, though by this time we'd been through an appetizer and a main course, so only had space for half the dessert.  It was like eating warm marzipan. which we both like.\n\nService was not welcoming.  The waiter was snooty, and seemed to not have time to explain anything.  Strange, since we had to wait an hour and half before out main souffl\u00e9 turned up (which we didn't mind that much, since we were noshing on snails and chatting).  When we asked whether or not we should order the dessert souffl\u00e9 at the same time as the savory souffl\u00e9, we were told somewhat snootily \"you'd be well advised to order it now.\"  A simple \"yes\" would have sufficed.\n\nOverall, a nice leisurely experience - don't go there if you are in a hurry.", "author": "Nick K."}

Let me recount my experience for your reference.\n\nMy first time to Cafe Jacqueline was about 2 years ago. The decor was less than spectular, but it was a charming little house structure with tall ceilings. Romantic and intimate in an old-fashioned sense.\n\nThe food that time was good. I remember the souffles were good, but I was not in awe with them. There're lots of great restaurants like La Folie and Gary Danko in the city where they also serve excellent souffles. Of course they also come with different price tags for an entire meal, of course, but cafe Jacqueline is certainly no bargain. I remember walking away feeling pretty good about the place. Not spectular in any sense, but good.\n\nThis time the experience was different. We arrived early at the restaurant. We had made a reservation at 8:30 pm for desserts, but our dinner ended early at night, so when we got to Cafe Jacqueline, it was about 8:10 pm. What I'm going to tell you about the subsequent experience will be *shocking*. \n\nThe waiter (most likely the same waiter as Danielle L. spoke about, since this kind of rude service is very hard to find) came to us at the door, and asked for our reservation. We told him we arrived early and he told us there wouldn't be a table available until 8:30 pm, which is completely understandable. He then tried to convince us to cancel our reservation and go elsewhere. Yes! He told us to go elsewhere, because we arrived 20 minutes earlier than our reservation. He didn't ask us to take a walk and come back in 20 minutes (it was freezing cold outside) for our reservation. He told us to cancel the reservation to go elsewhere. He then tried to physically gesture us towards the door.\n\nThis is unbelievable. We've been to places with excellent service (in the bay area, I would nominate Manresa and Gary Danko to have the best service), but we haven't been to places where the service is so bad they would turn away customers! I have no idea why they would do that.\n\nMadame Jacqueline, if you care about your restaurant, please be aware that you have a waiter working there that's turning away business. I would not go back to your restaurant and I will tell all my friends not to go to your restaurant. The bottomline is, while you care so deeply about your souffles, there's someone working in your restaurant that cares deeply about turning away customers.\n\nBottomline, worst service ever.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-09-12", "description": "Cafe Jacqueline is a different concept - when you think \"all soufflees\", it sounds super tempting, but the truth is, it gets really old. The soufflee is very rich (we had the highly recommended sweet corn, ginger, and garlic) and starts to taste really salty about half way through.  The consistency of the soufflee was excellent, but honestly,  I was done about 5 bites into the entree soufflee.\n\nThe wait, as everyone has indicated, is horrendous. We arrived at 8pm and didn't leave til 11pm. I felt like they needed better time management. The table next to us arrived at least 20 minutes later and received their souffle at least 20 minutes before us (we ordered an entree, they ordered dessert).  I think what happened is that they waited until we finished our french onion soup before ordering the soufflee - when they could have ordered the soufflee midway through our soup. Likewise with the dessert soufflee (could have been ordered much earlier).\n\nThe time between the entree and the dessert was so long we almost fell alseep, but finally it arrived. I ordered the white chocolate soufflee - truly divine but way large for 2 people. I ended up taking half home, and my husband barely rolled out (he was so sleepy from the wait and the heavy food).\n\nBottom line: if you want a leisurely meal where you can gaze into each other's eyes and sip wine, not caring when the food arrives or how long you gaze, come for dinner. If not, skip dinner. Personally for me, dessert soufflee is the best anyway, so come for dessert and be prepared to wait.  My white chocolate soufflee was amazing. The table next to us had chocolate soufflee, and several people ordered the strawberry soufflee, topped with fresh strawberries, it looked divine.  One thing about the dessert soufflee - they put a ton of powdered sugar on it, which makes me cough - so you might want to ask them to hold the powdered sugar.\n\nService is nothing extraordinary. My server was not really \"with it\" - the head waiter took over 3/4 of the way and the service went up a notch but by then it was already too late.", "author": "mai p."}

You cannot get a better souffle in San Francisco, and I've never had a better one anywhere else either.  Impeccable food, Impeccable service and the most romantic atmosphere I've found in a restaurant.\n\nReservations can be hard to get, calling around 4:30 or 5 a week or so in advance seems to help, but reservations around Valentine's day almost always fill up a month or even three in advance.  There's only about 9 tables, most of which are for 2 people.

Scott helped me with some excellent wine by the glass suggestions, and Matt was enthusiastic about the freshly made carrot soup, which was incredible!

Tucked away on a narrow street in North Beach, the restaurant is just a cute little mish mash of French knickknacks and somewhat cheesy accoutrement that somehow suddenly don't seem cheesy in the confines of the restaurant. Lovely, lovely, lovely. My husband and I came here for a nice date night and we could not have been more pleased. Be prepared for a loooooong meal. They must only do one seating a night because we had a reservation at 6:15 and did not leave before 9:00. It was just a nice leisurely eating experience which gave us time to relax, chat and enjoy each other's company. The menu is limited, only a few salads and lots of souffles but with souffles this perfect what more do you need? We started off with salads which were simply but perfectly dressed. Butter lettuce with a nice lemony dressing with maybe a hint of tarragon. Delicious! And then the crab souffle which was wonderful. Light and airy and extremely generous with crab. And then, the most sublime moment of the night, the fresh strawberry souffle. It was decadent and transcendent, my first bite and I was transported away to culinary heaven.

RIGHT NOW! funny thing is, i don't like white chocolate. \n\nsuffice to say, we will only go back for dessert. i think one souffle must have 12-16 egg whites in it. seriously. i am desperate to know what becomes of all of those unused egg yolks. the story about the whipped cream was no joke. the waiter said we should have asked for it earlier because jacqueline \"makes it herself by hand\". have you ever made whipped cream by yourself? it involves WHIPPING CREAM AND SOMETHING TO WHIP WITH. my 5 year old son has been making whipped cream since he was 3. we pour a container of whipping cream in a tall container and give him the hand blender and he goes at for 5 minutes. i mean, come on! $10 can buy you 2 gallons of whipping cream and a 5 year old child hours of entertainment. i was imaging jacqueline is 100 years old, chained to a stove, has carpal tunnel syndrome with a touch of arthritis and has to whip the cream with a toothpick. that would, therefore, justify the price. \n\nthis place opened in the 80's when everyone was throwing around their sacks of cash, snorting coke for a lack of something better to with all their money. i think the reputation and the high prices stuck. all in all i'm glad i went. as i have said, i have been wanting to go for years. it was good but just too much for not enough. \n\nmy idea would be to halve the portions and make them individual size so you and your company are not forced to share one thing. the average souffle is $40-$50 and serves 2 people. even if the portions were halved and cost half as much, they still would have cost too much at $20 to $25 apiece. take it down a notch and price them at $14-$18. that way you can share and get a variety. \n\none last thing, the service was very good. it did take 3 hours. no prob, was expecting it due to other reviews. but boy, is my husband pissed off!", "author": "Heather J."}

The only dish on the menu is souffl\u00e9. There are some delicious home-made soups and green crisp salads to start with, along with relaxing and drinking wine to pass the time as your souffl\u00e9 bakes in the oven. Souffl\u00e9 choices include cheese, garlic and lobster, among others. For dessert, chocolate, strawberry and seasonal specials are available. The service is warm and efficient for the upscale clientele here, and the wine list has a good selection of imported and domestic vintages.  This is perfectly French and my new French wife loves to come here for the delicious souffle.", "author": "Michael S."}

I always wanted to come here as it has been recommended to me a few times so I had to try it. It was a great dinner.  I didn't realize that all the entree's were souffles...I guess I should have Yelped them first! Anwyway, we started with the carrot soup and cucumber salad which were both very good.  We ordered the prosciutto and mushroom souffle which was excellent.  There was such an interesting selection of suffles that I had a hard time picking one.  One suffle is enough for 2 people.  Than for dessert we had the chocolate souffle which was awesome!  But be careful, the top of the chocolate suffle is covered with powdered sugar.  When my GF laughed while leaning towards the souffle, she got covered in white powder which made her look like a coke-head which she had a lot of fun impersonating for the rest of the evening.  We had to rush through dinner a bit because we were going to a comedy show so be sure to allow a lot of time for dinner.  You'll need at least 2.5 hours for dinner.", "author": "V C."}

Definitely a excellent date spot -- very unassumingly romantic.   Go with someone you can have an excellent conversation with.  You will need to make reservations and be prepared to wait at least 45 mins for each souffle because they are made from scratch.  Entree & Dessert souffles are delightful.", "author": "Suen L."}

My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and we enjoyed ourselves.  But, I thought of it as a once in a lifetime dining experience - meaning it was memorable, but not coming back.  The food was tasty, but nothing special.  We had for the first course French Onion Soup, second course seafood souffle, and third course chocolate souffle.  My boyfriend commented that the ingredients were very simple.  After all, it was just eggs and seafood - come on now.  I suppose there is an art to making the souffle rise and you pay for that, not the ingredients.  The pricing was moderate to expensive.  I definitely recommend the chocolate souffle dessert. It was delicious and huge.  We finished everything.  I would come back, but only for the dessert.  I saw several people reserve a table just for the chocolate dessert.  It is huge enough to feed 4 people for dessert (although it comes with a hefty price tag of about $30 for a chocolate souffle).  If you're pressed for time Cafe Jacqueline isn't for you.  Our dining experience took 2.5 hours and my boyfriend was plenty hungry by the time our 2nd course came.", "author": "Dbear T."}

The service was very slow and not attentive- be prepared to wait a long time between courses or to get your wine refilled. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and ordered the onion soup. It was served piping hot (it took a full 10 min before it was edible), and very salty. The lobster souffle was tasty, but took way too long to arrive. By that point, I just wanted the check.", "author": "ofelia R."}

So light and airy it melts in your mouth to a bevy of delicious flavors.  The lobster, crab and cheese souffles will make you tear at their sheer perfection. And the dessert souffles are just a fabulous.  It's like a tiny little Parisian gem of a restaurant tucked into North Beach (you can totally pretend you're in Paris). And did I mention it's a tiny place with small tables and just about, if not, the most romantic restaurant in San Francisco?!?!??!  If Cafe Jacqueline can't end your dry spell, you got bigger issues.  And you MUST visit the restroom so you can see Jacqueline herself with her big floppy white chef hat and huge basket of eggs in the kitchen creating her souffle masterpieces.  Man, I love this place.", "author": "Jane M."}

I love souffles but I've never loved any (save the ones I've cooked with my gf) as much as the ones we had here! Quick tip, plan on being here at least 90min if not more if you go for a 3 course meal (appetizer(s), dinner souffle and dessert souffle). They make everything to order so it takes awhile. However the wine list is very affordable and it's a great opportunity to order a well priced Bourdeaux and catch up on good conversation. The waiters are very knowledgeable about everything on the menu so if you have any questions, or can't decide, definitely ask! We had a French Onion Soup (high up on the list of best ones I've ever had), Cucumber Salad (good, not great but good), broccoli dinner souffle (amazing! I wouldn't have thought that it would be as tasty as it was) and a chocolate dessert souffle with a grand marnier flambe on top (not on the menu, just ask, it's a great option if you can't decide between the two). Very filling and well worth the wait for them to come out. Definitely come hungry though, we barely finished that menu between the two of us and we were starving when we went!", "author": "Chris D."}

I noticed there were small groups of friends and families who were there too. The restaurant is small.  The maximum it fits is probably 5 to a table with a seating capacity of about 30 people.  Call for reservations. Street parking is very difficult.  If you ask the waiter at the restaurant, there's a parking deck they recommend near by. The dessert souffle (lemon) was excellent.  We got onion soup (very good), one entree souffle which was good for souffle (I am not a fan of entree souffles) and the dessert souffle.  If I go again, I will definitely do the same soup, and salad and then the dessert souffle which is large enough for 4 people.  The dessert souffle was great as leftovers.  As we were about the leave the water asked us to go speak with Madame Jacqueline in the back.  She was very nice!  I highly recommend this restaurant.  Also they are open til 11pm on the nights they are open!", "author": "Maya N."}

You'll be fighting against the tasty but heavy triumvirate of cream, butter, and eggs. You start off with a salad or soup appetizers. The three pepper soup I had was delicious. No matter your predilection get an appetizer; souffles take a long time and you'll be starving if you skip the apps. Then you share a souffle and they have a bevy to choose from. The lobster souffle we had, had a carmelized cheesy crust, rich egginess, and huge chunks of lobster. We were scraping the ramekin trying to get the last bits. Lastly you split a dessert souffle and we went with the classic of chocolate. When it comes you must be careful not to inhale the powdered sugar which coats the top. It could cause a choking frenzy which would be an unwelcome scene in the small space. With little lighting and marginal decor, our powdered sugar choking fit had the whole restaurant looking at us. We sure filled up on the chocolate souffle though, and there was NOTHING left in the ramekin. It really is an amazingly delicious and large souffle. Service was lacking, but you really only come here just for the souffles. The wine list is very reasonably priced and complements the menu well with mostly French selections.", "author": "Keith R."}

You have to be an adult to enjoy it. Yes, it is a long evening order a couple of bottles of wine and enjoy. It takes a long time to handmake all of those souffles and it is worth it. The quality and selection is fantastic. The waiters can be a little surly, but after I killed mine with kindness he was fine. You can't complain about the menu as it is all about souffles. You can't fault them for the parking situation, it has nothing to do with the restaurant or food. If you want an ultra-romantic spot, this is it. Don't rush it, enjoy it. If you want fast food there are plenty of other (not better) places to go.", "author": "Timothy S."}

I've never had my name mispronounced so beautifully - something about the accent just makes anything sound good!

The waiter was short with us but not rude. The chef is just precious (worth the trip to the bathroom). We had the spinach bacon and pine nuts salad to start - which was light but not the star of the meal. We then had the prosciutto (sp?) and mushroom souffle, then the ooey gooey chocolate souffle for dessert. Plenty of food for us two good eaters - almost finished it all. Waiter's wine choice was perfect for what we were looking to accompany the meal.  Overall an excellent experience and meal - will definitely return.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-01-24", "description": "I absolutely LOVEEEE this place! Ever since the first souffle I had here, I don't think any other souffle tastes as good. I've had almost every single one of their dessert souffle and also the lobster and crab. I'd def. order the crab again. It's baked with lemon on top and bottom and it went soooo well with the cheese! And the bread....ohhh the bread. It's the best French bread I've had in SF. Dessert wise, I think strawberry and white chocolate are the best! Despite the fact that the place is oven-temperature (to keep the souffle from flapping when it's served) and the almost impossible-to-find parking space, this place is def. worth the wait and hassle. I don't think service is as bad as everyone mentions, just don't expect it to be like 5-star hotels. Sometimes you do get a feeling that they don't need your business cause well....they don't. I have had the luck to talk to Chef Jacqueline a couple of times and she's actually a very nice person. If you try to talk to the waiters, they would joke around with you when they're not  busy!", "author": "Eva L."}

I made a reservation two days ahead for 2 people at 8pm under the name \"Mimi\". I called today, and the lady said she cannot find my name. I insisted that I made a reservation, and she heads the phone to a guy. He said \" I TRIED to BELIEVE you.. but I can't find you name!\"... What?!?!?! so he thinks I m lying! He gave me a really big attitude and think I am lying to him. Then he made it sounds like he is doing me a favor and asked me how many I have... then i said i don't want to eat here any more.. and right away he said ok and hang me up! I was really mad at his attitude and I called back... the lady picks up the phone again... then she said... \"oh.. i think i wrote you down as 'Amy'!\" !!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG!!!!!!  I told her that I called back becasue he was really rude and i don't deserve this kind of serve. After arguing with me for 5 mins... they finally found out they wrote my name wrong!!! After I told them my name is \"Mimi\".. i even spell it out to her because a lot of times people don't know how to spell my name... I just she wasn't listening to my at all when i spell it to her! I wonder if that guy is the owner of the restaurant... if not he should be fire! I will never eat at that restaurant!! SUPER BAD SERVE on the phone already... i can't imagine what i will get when i eat there.... they think they have a lot of customers already that they can treat me this way!

I hope they will never accuse people next time... you are not gary danko or french laundry.. no one will fake a reservation to eat at your place!", "author": "Oi T."}
