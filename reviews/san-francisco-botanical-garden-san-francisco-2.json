I never find the Gardens overly crowded so it's a peaceful place to read a book or bring out of towners.\n\nWhat I like about the Botanical Gardens is that the vibe is completely different than you will find at Dolores Park or Golden Gate Park--there are no screaming birthday parties or people cheersing champagne glasses!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-15", "description": "If there's one thing I regret not having done in the first six years that I have lived in the Bay Area, it's taking the time to visit the San Francisco Botanical Garden. I guess I never stopped by because it didn't seem worth it to pay for a garden when there's nature everywhere, and there was always something else to do in the city. But last weekend, I decided to surprise my girlfriend by taking her to the garden since it was one of the last few chances anyone had to see fall colors there. After a few hours of walking around, we both had the same thought in our minds: \"San Francisco, you've surprised us with another gem!\"\n\nTwo words described what we saw inside the garden: GORGEOUS and VIBRANT. Immediately when we walked in, we encountered the most massive and beautiful tree. Even with winter fast approaching, this beast stood tall and robust amongst a sea of nature. Venturing deep into the garden, we then found ourselves surrounded by a maze of life. Apparently there were tens of thousands of different plants here, and we found each one to be both stunning and magical. Unlike what some had said, there were PLENTY of fall colors to see! To me, the most scenic spot was the moon viewing garden. It was like we were in a mini Japanese garden.\n\nIf the scenery isn't enough to draw you here, let me convince you further. For those of y'all who enjoy spending hours in a garden, you will LOVE the San Francisco Botanical Garden. I mean this place was gigantic! It was almost the same size as a zoo - only instead of hundreds of critters we got an army of plants (although there were still animals here too like the duckies). We stayed for about 2 hours and it still wasn't enough. Don't worry about getting lost because there are maps and signs everywhere (as well as bathrooms!).\n\nThink you'll be bored though? Trust me, you definitely won't be. It was SO relaxing and peaceful to just walk around here. The garden wasn't crowded, the diverse paths kept us engaged, and if you're afraid of getting tired there are plenty of benches along the way. \n\nOne of the most underrated aspects of the San Francisco Botanical Garden had to be the location. Since it was directly inside Golden Gate Park (aka San Francisco's version of Central Park), there was SO much to see and do here in addition to the garden. Whether this is your first time visiting or your 100th, you can easily make a day trip out here. The only thing that sucked was parking but if you're patient you can definitely find a spot (most are free for 4 hours!).\n\nWhen coming here, note that general admission is $8 for adults ($6 for youth/seniors, $2 for children 5-11, and free for those under 5). If you're an SF resident or a member, you don't have to pay! It's also free before 9am each day, during the second Tuesday of every month, and on certain holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas Day, and New Year's).\n\nOf all the attractions I've paid around $8 for in my short life (e.g. museums, shows, etc), the San Francisco Botanical Garden definitely had one of the best bang for the buck. This garden was so visually pleasing, spacious, and quite serene. Thanks dear San Francisco, for you've once again provided my girlfriend and me with a memorable adventure. I wholeheartedly give the San Francisco Botanical Garden an \"Omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this\" rating. If I were an SF resident, you BET I'll come here weekly.\n\nHave fun and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-27", "description": "I've been a fan of San Francisco Botanical Gardens since back in the early 2000's, when it was free to the public. Times have changed and they now charge admission (more on that in a bit) but the gardens have stayed spectacular and have only gotten better over the years. I try to make a point to visit once a year and vary my trips by season. Each season brings different blooms, lighting and a unique overall experience to the garden goer. This is the kind of place where you can spend a few hours or all day. Despite being strategically placed near so many other attractions in Golden Gate Park, the gardens are never overly crowded. The atmosphere of tranquility is apparent from the moment you start meandering down their paths. The city fades away and you're transported to a variety of ecosystems and geo specific garden areas.\n\nIt can often be a bit chillier and foggier here, so plan accordingly. Many times the sun will also break through-layers are in order. There is quite a bit of walking involved if you want to see all of the gardens and many paths are wheelchair accessible. Because of the zig-zagging paths you can take a different route each time and enjoy the displays from different points of view. On my most recent visit, I took the guided map which highlights their \"Magnificent Magnolias\" in bloom. The route was easy to follow and it was a fun little floral treasure hunt to be sure to see each magnolia tree in bloom (typically January-March.)\n\nOther highlights of the garden and my faves include the Redwood Grove, Central American Cloud Forest and the rhododendron garden. There is so much more so I highly recommend any botanical garden fans to plan a few hours-bring a picnic and book and take time to relax on the many lawn areas and benches to truly soak in the surroundings.\n\nAdmission for non San Francisco residents is $8 but if you are a member of either this garden or the UC Berkeley Botanical garden, admission is reduced or free. My UC Berkeley garden membership got me and a friend in at no charge to the SF gardens-that annual membership has honestly been one of my favorite gifts of all times. Parking can be found in the museum garage, some limited spaces along the park streets (closed to through traffic on Sundays) or in the nearby Inner Sunset area. You can also take the Judah muni and get off at 9th & Irving with a short walk over to the park. Highly recommend you visit any way you can get here.

The funny part is that I never knew it existed until just a couple years ago.  It's very surprising to see such a massive garden close to the city.\n\nThis is a great place to exercise your photography skills and give your camera a workout.  There are so many subjects and views to take photos of.\n\nMy favorite areas are the California Redwood forest (http://bit.ly/2eunQAd), the bamboo garden that makes you feel like you've transported to Japan (http://bit.ly/2euoPAf), and the Moon Viewing Garden which has a small pond with a deck that overlooks it (http://bit.ly/2eunIQU).\n\nIn regards to that last picture from the Moon Viewing garden, during the summertime, they place pianos throughout the garden for anyone to play on (http://bit.ly/2euqbLq).  It was really cool because there were some really talented piano players at the garden that day I went (http://bit.ly/2euq6HF).  Great nature views with beautiful piano music in the background made for a very tranquil experience.\n\nI honestly could spend a whole day at the Botanical Garden and just meditate and relax especially on sunny days.  In my opinion, I like it better than it's more popular neighbor, the Japanese Tea Garden.  It's almost quadruple in size, many paths to explore, and an overall better value for the general admission price you pay to get in.

I came here for a quick after lunch tour with a friend.\n\n-- LOCATION --\nThe garden is located in the southern eastern part of Golden Gate Park. The garden is large and the entrance is on the east side of it, along 9th Avenue. The entrance cost is free for San Francisco county residents, and $8 for adult visitors. You are provided a map to help navigate your way around. I suggest Googling \"San Francisco Botanical Garden map\" beforehand if you want to take a specific path.\n\n-- MAINTENANCE --\nThis place is gorgeous and well-maintained. Sprinklers are at locations where humid plants get the moisture in the air they need. Old or dead leaves can be seen composted for reuse into the Earth. You can tell that the people that help maintain the garden care for it.\n\n-- COLLECTIONS --\nYou could have a nice peaceful stroll through here alone, or walk around on a date. My friend and I decided to walk in a counter-clockwise path. Along the way, we went through some bamboo mini-forests of Temperate Asia, saw some cacti growing along the walls in the Succulent Garden, explored the Ancient Plant Garden, and saw some very large trees from New Zealand. There is a great Meadow which reminds me a little of Central Park where you can just sit down and absorb the calming scenery.\n\n-- PLANT STORE --\nI had hoped to see some carnivorous plants and maybe I missed it, but, I did see some in the plant arbor/bookstore. After you are done and get back to the entrance/exit, you can buy plants to take home! There are a variety of plants to buy here which you could easily carry in one hand, or in a car if you wanted something bigger. Since I have enough plants at home I was ok but my friend was able to get a Venus Fly Trap. Take a look and bring some nature back in your home.\n\n-- SUMMARY --\nI wish I had more time to spend here and I will be sure I have that time on the next visit. Bring a friend, go yourself, or take your family for a fun explorative day. Recommended.", "author": "Benjamin B."}

The different gardens transport you to different countries and even back in time!\nOur favorite gardens are the succulent garden, the Garden of Fragrance, and the Ancient Garden. \nThe Garden of Fragrance is full of beautiful lavenders, mints, and tons of fragrant flowers to smell and admire. I often walk through with a notebook to write down any plants I would like to look for for my garden.\nThe California Succulent Garden is so well done. Many different levels to walk through. Aloes, aeoniums, agaves, and many different cacti. Many of them very old plants and so huge! The bushes of aloes look like something from an Alien movie. We love it! Although we do find some species are not labeled, which makes succulent lovers like us sad LOL\nThe Ancient Garden transports you to the time of dinosaurs. Huge ancient ferns, palms, and species of plants that are just so neat. \nThese are just a few of the many gardens and things to explore at SFBG\nMake sure to stop in the plant store, where they sell clippings of plants from the gardens.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-12-04", "description": "Almost a 5-star average? Do people feel obligated to give a high rating just because it's a botanical garden, which has cachet enough, & it's in their beloved SF? Or do they actually think it's all that? This place isn't Bouchard Gardens, the Huntington, or any fancy destination garden. The SFBG is just a local, regional, ho-hum nature area. People from outside don't come here for a reason, & it's not just because they started charging admission for non-residents a while ago. \n\nIt's like Yosemite, Apple, & everything else - overrated. Any random limestone cliffs in China, from what I've seen in pics, is 5000x prettier & more stunning than your beloved Yosemite. Except they don't boast it's practically heaven, the way people think of Yosemite & anything else worshipped in the SF hipster outdoorsy crowd. Americana really rules in SF, much more than you can imagine. Except here, it takes the form of hipster racism, unbridled love for Trader Joe's, showing off your Arc'teryx jacket - & anything else that might be dated by the time you read this, because SF's hipster Millenials move on to new trends very quickly. \n\nThe SFBG can be enjoyed for what it is - a pleasant, if underwhelming, little local garden, just another little-known part of GG Park, which is overrated already. If you really think about it, the SFBG is purely a 3-star, mediocre, regional, non-destination garden. And actually, this place isn't that much of a \"garden,\" per se - more like a nondescript nature area, w/wind-y dirt paths, like the rest of GG Park. It's not a fancy, obsessively-maintained place like the Japanese Tea Garden, or filled to the brim w/bright exotic flowers, like Bouchard Gardens. In fact, there's almost no color at the SFBG, other than grass green & the brown of barks, in any season. \n\nA major SF events site recently claimed that for 2 weeks, you can see fall colors in the garden. And then that day, I saw tons of people there, a younger & hipper crowd - the ones that follow that events site. The site provides very good advertising for everything. There was barely any fall colors that day, & in my many visits, I never noticed fall colors, ever. There are bits of fall colors all over SF, but they're not very visible, & no one ever talks about it. \n\nThe outer reaches of the garden, like the children's area, is poorly maintained. It looks sad, like something that was abandoned long ago. It's like they thought of a great idea to add a children's area, & then the idea fell through, & you're left w/weird little chairs, basil plant labels, & strange odds & ends. Other outer areas of the garden look like they haven't payed much attention to it, & visitors rarely get there. The way the SFBG is, you're just mainly in the primary area, around the pond, & you just don't get much farther than that. For some reason, where ever you go, you just naturally circle back to the main area. \n\nThere's a little horticulture library that seems rarely visited. And it's for a reason - the staff is always stuffy, & they ignore you, at least if you're non-white. The selection seems very dated. Supposedly they have children's book readings there, but I can see certain parents w/kids being a little less welcomed there, too. \n\nOnce I saw an older employee/volunteer near the admissions kiosk warmly greeting & helping a man on his own. And that visitor wasn't just any man; he was white & had a slim, elegant Obama sort of build. The volunteer, like everyone else, just automatically liked & respected that guy, based on his appearance, so he gave him special treatment, though he didn't deserve it. That guy w/the Obama build surely gets everything in life, constantly, unfairly. Being greeted/helped warmly while other visitors are IGNORED is just one example; people with a look you like get advantages, unfairly, in all contexts/settings. I've been to SFBG many times, & no one ever cared to say anything to me, except a coarse and rude \"HEY! GET OFF THAT LAWN\" - when they would've let anyone else go, or said it in a nicer way, & chat them up, too. \n\nSFers are Trump at heart. We love to bash Trump, the way we did w/his predecessor, George W. - but people here really aren't that far from the racism, lookism, xenophobia, & provinciality of Trump. Bay Areans are just less forward about their very innate prejudices than Trump is. Trump's stupidity/stigmas are expressed everyday, by almost everyone, in SF, just in a more understated manner. If SFers took a test of subconscious bias, they'd fail it as badly as Trump.\n\nUPDATE: Went there again, & a lady at the Front Gate rudely LAUGHED at me when I showed my ID. When I politely asked what was going on, she dismissively said I looked \"robotic\"! And when I emailed about it, & followed up, they FAILED to respond. And then I called a manager, & she was extremely rude/unhelpful. Docking off 2 stars--1 for terrible treatment multiple times, & another for failure to respond to my emails & painfully rude call with a manager.", "author": "Valle H."}

I had the obligatory visit to Golden Gate Bridge (no I didn't walk the whole length).  But I have never visited Golden Gate Park.  \n\nOn this visit after a family event in San Jose, I decided to kill time before my flight to visit GG Park.  Luckily, post Labor Day weekday, parking was available in the area.  Of course I parked closed to the San Francisco Botanical Garden and had to check it out.  Once I paid my entrance fee ($8) free for San Francisco residents, the lady in the ticket booth informed me that the Conservatory of Flowers was free for the day so I hightailed it over there, warning, its not a block away, it's on the other side of the park..lol.  bring water.\n\nWell back to the Garden.  I appreciate small quiet parks within the confines of an urban city like San Francisco. I understand why this is free for residents, its actually a lovely park with sections designed for various countries or for California native plants.  The best part for me to explore is the Redwood Grove.  I have been lax in going further north of San Francisco to go see the Redwoods but this was a small taste of it.  I love old tall trees because they have been here for centuries, when I visited Europe a while ago, the best visits were to ancient spots.\n\nOverall, the Garden provides nice little areas with benches to be able to medidate, read a book or explore.  It was worth the entrance fee.

So many different regions of plants all in one place, but segregated in a way that you can begin to recognize which plants are native to which regions. We went on a Saturday morning, when a plant sale for California natives and succulents was occurring. Thankfully there was a separate line for cash vs credit, because the line for people paying with credit cards was at least 75 feet long, and the cash only line was nonexistent. Needless to say, we went with the latter option since we had the means to do so. On our way out, we saw that there was a path to get in to the park and the sale without going through the main gate, which is good knowledge for interns visiting the Bay or anybody else that might have forgotten their San Francisco ID (free admission if you live in SF) and didn't want to pay. \n\nAdditionally, we saw a super cute groundhog/woodchuck/varmint burrowing holes on our walk to the plant sale.

When the gardens were free there would sometimes be several of these tours throughout the day,  Now they are daily at 1:30 starting just inside the main gate to the garden.  These volunteer\n led tours tell you the history of the gardens and take you on  a hour to hour and a half tour of the gardens.  The tours very greatly as different guides have different interests and they try and show areas that are at their best and that changes.  They always take request so if someone in the group is interested in a certain kind of plant they will do their best to show it.\n\nI always make it to the gardens and take a tour when I am in town,  when the garden was free I would make the trip several times looking forward to the different guides and what they will cover,.

It's based on the story that a night watchman at NYC's American Museum of Natural History discovers that the exhibits, animated by a magical Egyptian artifact, comes to life at night. The adventures that arise are hilarious, as you can physically see a real live museum in action.\n\nAfter watching the movie, if you want to visit a real living museum, then head to the San Francisco Botanical Garden located at Golden Gate Park. It offers 55 acres of both landscaped gardens and open spaces, showcasing over 8000 different kinds of plants from around the world. (http://www.sfbotanicalgarden.org)\n\nThe reason that the garden is able to house these living plants is due to the Bay Area's mild temperatures, wet winters and dry summers, coupled with the coastal fog. It provides a range of climatic conditions that exist only in a few botanical gardens in the world. These unique conditions allow it to grow and conserve plants from all over the globe, including plants that are no longer found in their native habitats.\n\n2015 marks the 75th anniversary that the garden has been opened to the public. I'm not really a big fan of places like this, but I have to admit that it's really chill, where visitors can experience nature and learn about plants and its environment. Kinda like an outdoor classroom. You can relax, while the kids run amuck. Best thing, it's open 365 days a year. I highly recommend checking out their extensive Magnolia collection.\n\nYou must be a SF resident to enjoy this place for FREE. Bring your driver's license and you're set.

Of course, that costs $32 to enter, while this lovely, 55-acre attraction is completely free to city residents who can show a driver's license with a local address ($7 for non-residents). So who's complaining? Not me. It's a calming place that Jamie W. and I visit when we feel like taking an easy stroll from the entry point to Golden Gate Park at 9th and Lincoln. Besides, it doesn't smell of old lady like some other gardens do.\n\nWe usually have to work off some of the calories from a satisfying meal we got at either Park Gyros, Park Chow or Marnee Thai. As you walk toward the very retro-looking County Fair building, I like the vertical sign that tells you all the things you can't do in the space (see photo). Once you enter the main gate, you see the Great Meadow, a wide expanse of manicured green dotted by majestic trees. Side paths take you to any of the four main gardens organized by climate, geography and plant type. There are at least two restful Japanese gardens which offer ponds, benches, Japanese maples and water irises.\n\nThere's also a succulent garden, a fragrance garden and a fascinating garden devoted to ancient plants. The wildfowl pond features all sorts of fowl, and we ran into a parade of geese who seemed unperturbed by the humans in their path to the water. The camellia garden is a particularly nice place to sit a spell and enjoy the colorful glories of nature while resting your derriere. There's a tiny garden bookstore at the entrance that's worth perusing and a rack of seeds for the more horticulturally inclined. This is well worth a stop on the way to many of the other attractions in the park (see the photo gallery).", "author": "Ed U."}

It should receive fair comparisons with other botanical gardens, not comparisons to a movie or a concert or a day at the beach.  \n\nEvery great city should have a beautiful park, and every great park should have a botanical garden.   A botanical garden represents careful planning and design, a blend of science and art.  This is the beauty of a botanical garden.  And the SF Botanical Gardens are no exception.  This majestic SF landmark was first begun in the 19th century, and its caretaker, John Mclaren from Scotland, spent literally his lifetime planning out how to incorporate plants from around the world into a park that also spawned many of its own native California species.  By the time he passed at the age of 96, he had established one of the most beautiful botanical gardens in the country.  \n\nSet against the rest of the Golden Gate Park, its easy to overlook this garden as much more of the same flora, but close attention to detail reveals much more.  Mclaren was able to recreate different flora from around the world, like a botanist's dream version of Epcott center at Disney World.  Various sections of the park are dedicated specifically to growing plants from South East Asia, Chile, South Africa, even Australia and New Zealand.   Everywhere you look, you will literally find one unique species after another, one after another, beautiful plant imported from far away, with neighbors from its own country, now making its new home here in SF.  There's also quite a bit of land dedicated to Californian species, including a small Redwood forest.  The dark gray stones, which line the the terrace and can be found interspersed throughout the garden, are actually old remnants from a 12th century Spanish monastery.  \n\nAs you explore the garden, your senses will be inundated with wonderful and brilliant colors, and rich, vibrant smells.  The garden even encourages visitors to not only smell, but also touch the plants as well!  Find a comfortable spot, and take some time to rest and relax.  Very likely you will notice plenty of wildlife around you, even on a winter's day I noticed a Canadian goose and several hummingbirds perusing the garden's foliage.  Children will delight in the ancient plant arboretum, which boasts species from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, as well as replicas of dinosaur footprints and even a few hidden topiary dinosaurs themselves! \n\nWhether you're a naturalist or a nature lover or just a naturally loving person, you'll enjoy a stroll through the botanical gardens.   Happy travels my friend!", "author": "Gino I."}

I stood in awe of magnificent trees harvested from South and Central America. The vibrant lush greenery that surrounded me melted away all worries. The air was perfumed with delicately scented flowers and I couldn't help but breathe in as deep as I could just to savor it a little longer.\n\nAs I explored a little deeper, I walked endless trails leading into small pockets of hidden surprises. I walked upon a wooden deck and could imagine how romantic it would be for a couple. I came across a shaded bench and could've sat there forever admiring such an ethereal setting. \n\nOne of my favorite parts was visiting the plant nursery. Curiously shaped succulents and peculiar green potted plants were lovingly placed alongside each other.

During Christmas Day, we were bored and were unsure what to do since a lot of places were closed. It turned out that the admission was free during Christmas Day for non-residents of this amazing city, so we went here late in the morning and stayed around here until the late afternoon.\n\nThis place is definitely one of the most wonderful parts of the Golden Gate Park. My favorite areas are probably the Great Meadow and the Waterfowl Pond. The grass of the meadow felt good on my feet, and was nice to sit down, and lie down to take a look at the clear sky. The Waterfowl Pond is a nice place to look at some birds, and I really liked the hilly terrain nearby where you can get some decent views of the gardens while doing a little hill climbing. I don't have much to say about the other parts of this place, but pretty much the plants are all nice to look at, and it felt great to get another fresher smell. \n\nOverall, if you are looking for a nice place to walk around on Christmas Day in San Francisco, this place is a really good choice.

It is huge, it is gorgeous, and I want it as my backyard.\n\nWe weren't sure how much time we'd want to spend when we got there, so we asked the lady at the gate to point us toward the best areas.  She circled about half of the various gardens, but really she could have circled them all.  Even the ones that weren't really in bloom were interesting to see, and we ended up just wandering through everything at least once.\n\nMy favorite gardens:\n\n1) Succulent Garden.  It is not possible to go wrong with succulents, and these were absolutely amazing.  Super colorful, super pokey, and with a neat winding path up the side of a hill.\n\n2) Redwood Grove.  My first experience with redwoods but hopefully not my last!  It was amazing to see these tall trees first from afar from the entrance gate and then up close and personal in the grove.  And then to find out that they are basically babies compared to their giant cousins? Insane.\n\n3) Garden of Fragrance.  Just... wow.  We must have looked a little deranged, stopping every two feet to shove our heads into a new flower, but it was super fun.  Not all of the flowers were strongly smelly when we were there, but we definitely got whiffs of some great new scents, including the interesting mixes of scents from afar.

Lots of hidden paths to wonder down and cool plans and environments  to check out. Can't say enough good things.", "author": "Kate L."}

Probably you've already figured that out. \n\nIf you don't!--this place isn't all that interesting. And the Botanical Gardens are woefully short on information about the plants they DO have. If you like botany, you might want to splurge on a trip to the Academy of Science.  If you just want to see gorgeous plants and learn about them, the Conservatory of Flowers is a better pick. And if you want to see local plants in a natural setting, well, there's more impressive nature to be found just about anywhere in the Bay area. Scores of them are within an hour's drive of San Francisco. The state park entry fee is similar, too, and the larger parks have friendly rangers to harass for nature trivia. Choose the terrain or hiking path you want and find the park for you!", "author": "Eliza K."}

There were tons of beautiful little areas to walk around - pools, hills, hidden gardens, and restful benches.  Even at the end of December, there were still plentiful blooms to be seen (hydrangeas, camellias, agapanthus) and some beautiful tree foliage.  We spotted two hummingbirds while wandering through the garden and it was quiet enough that were were able to watch them feeding off of the plentiful cuphea.  The admission price was very reasonable (especially compared to other attractions within the city).\n\nOur experience was great, but there were some improvements that would lead to a five star experience.  Some of the plants were not labeled (leading to a running joke that if we saw something we thought was really interesting inevitably it would not be labeled).  In addition, some of the paths were very meandering and it became confusing to figure out what garden we were looking at (the maps only show main paths).  This lead to us missing some of the gardens because we went off of the main path.  Despite this, we still count the garden as one of our favorite things we did on our trip.", "author": "Anne P."}

I wanted to breathe.  I wanted serenity.  I wanted time to reflect and be still.  Like the oak tree that stands still against the torrid wind.  \n\nThe Botanical Garden is serene, peaceful.  I laid down on a bench, closed my eyes, and let the warmth of the sun soak into my tired body.   Across from where I rested, there was a white and pink flower that was fighting to stay alive, limp and barely hanging from the branch.   The cold, winter season left this beautiful flower thrashed, and if someone were to come by and just touch it, its petals would fall to the ground.  It was so reflective to see.  But, I knew that even if it died in that moment, by spring time it would bud and blossom into a more beautiful version of itself.   \n\nWhether you're here to look at the various types of indigenous plants/flowers, or play with your family near the duck pond, or just be by yourself, it's the perfect place to do so.", "author": "Soo Jin K."}

Sometimes you can see tadpoles moving in the water and egrets trying to eat them\n- the New Zealand christmas tree: it has the coolest hair like needles and trunk/roots (sorry don't know the technical terms).\n- the squirrels: I know it's probably bad that they are fed by visitors way too often, but this is probably one of the few places where squirrels will come so close\n- the quail: sometimes you'll see quail families running around\n- the bamboo path\n\nThere is really so much more than this list of things that I enjoy about the botanical garden.

However, in my experience, the entrance staff is TERRIBLE - rude, uninformed and uncompromising. Specifically, the power-tripping women working the gates on the weekend need to get off their high horses and allow for some leeway. \n\nBackground: \nI've lived in San Francisco for almost my entire life. I was born and raised here. I pay taxes. Contribute to charities. Give up cash towards more than my fair share of parking tickets (damn inner Sunset parking). My boyfriend has lived in SF for over 2 years, and is originally from the Bay Area. \n\nSetting:\nOne lovely, cold but sunny San Francisco winter Sunday morning, I was super excited to wander the Botanical Garden with my bf and our cups of coffee. We walked up to the woman who now \"guards\" the gates leading to the main entrance. I had my drivers license with my SF address. My bf, on the other hand, hadn't gotten a new license after moving so his had an old, non-SF address. \n\nSide note: DMV doesn't even make you get a new license when you move - they just require that you notify them of your change of address. \n\nCage Match: \nThe woman wouldn't let us in like the SF residents we are. We begged. We pleaded. We shared esoteric local knowledge. No dice. After contemplating hopping the 12-foot fence, we went to the other, side gate. That woman wouldn't let us in either, although she told us that they'd been letting residents-without-proof in free for the past 6 months, but NOW they were bucking down. \n\nThe idiotic women working the little kiosks wouldn't budge an inch to let us in without paying the RIDICULOUS amount of $7. It's nature! It used to be free! I know $7 isn't all that much dinero in the grand scheme of things but seriously, after paying taxes and parking tickets into the city coffers for almost 15 years, it's time to relax a little ladies. Hope you had  a nice power trip. \n\nYou can't contain nature, especially like this. The whole experience put a bad taste in my mouth, and it wasn't from the coffee. \n\n\nRecommendations:\nIt's plausible that an SF resident wouldn't have their local address on their drivers license. And who carries around utility bills? Really? The Garden should have a list of registered voters or some other way to verify residency. \nAnd they should look into some etiquette lessons for their clerks. I don't care if you're a volunteer, I volunteer too. It doesn't give you the right to be an a-hole.", "author": "Kayla N."}

We have a soft spot for California natives and on that score this garden does deliver. Their California section displayed chaparral, arroyos, ponds and woodlands plantings.

The result has been predictable, but dismal.\n\nWhere once the garden overflowed with enthusiastic visitors, so that on weekends and beautiful days, a kind of carnival atmosphere prevailed, now you will be lucky to meet half a dozen groups in the entire garden.  San Franciscans rightly think that they have been deprived of one of their city heritages, so even those who would be admitted free tend to shun the garden.  The staff doesn't say anything, but it must be odd to maintain an extensive garden -- which is primarily seen by the staff.\n\nA similar atmosphere infects the horticultural library, which has become a library for the librarians. (The assistant librarian thinks she has done something really outstanding if she reads -- LOUDLY-- a book to one visiting child.  Should any adult have the temerity to stray into the library during the time of her pet project, woe be the adult consulter of books, who might like to work in peace.)\n\nFortunately, Golden Gate Park is large and extensive.

We went here after going to the Japanese Tea Garden and I happened to like this place a lot better.  Its the same price but much larger.  I am not a lover of plants like some people but I still enjoyed walking around the beautiful grounds and looking at the plants and flowers. My favorite section is the Redwood Grove. As soon as I walked into it, it felt like the atmosphere almost changed.  It felt like some of the redwood forests that I've been it.

That was back in elementary school. So much has changed it seems, if my memory serves me right. Walking around today made me realize that there is an utter lack of guidance. I have absolutely no idea where I am going as pathways have no identification and maps are seldom seen. There is construction happening by the fountain but that's not a big deal. The best part was the redwood trees. Watch out for the feces around the pond where all the squirrels and geese congregate because people love to feed them.\n\nI would recommend going on a sunny warm day. Today was a freezing summer day and even two layers of fleece didn't barricade the strong winds blowing from the Bay. \n\nThere has got to be an exponential number of ways to complete walking around this garden. It may even take multiple visits to recognize your way. I still have no idea what my pathway around was since there seems to be a trail/path junction every 30 feet. Although not exactly comparable to the zoo, the upkeep of the place is average. There should definitely be more visitors. Even though I am a SF resident, I would not pay $7 for admission, nor the $5 college student with ID price.

You'll probably be able to see quail especially during the spring time when the chicks are born.  Once, we even spotted the fox.  \n\nYou might run into a guitarist or flutist and on the weekends, you're likely to run into groups practicing tai chi.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-05", "description": "For review No. 1,400, I'm going medium school.  What is medium school, exactly?  Well, I'm not really sure.  I normally dig way back into the deepest, darkest recesses of my childhood memories for milestone reviews, but I recently realized that I've now lived in San Francisco long enough (seven years) to be able to review something nostalgic without having to remember anything prior to 2003.\n\nGolden Gate Park is an amazing place.  Every time I have the slightest notion that I know it well enough to be bored by it, I unintentionally don't visit it as often as I normally do.  Why?  I'm afraid of it losing that magic.  But then I discover something new (or rediscover something old) about it, and it's like falling in love all over again with the same person--there's an excitement, but there's also a familiarity, and those two things combine in a beautiful, life-affirming way.\n\nThat's exactly what has happened with the San Francisco Botanical Garden.\n\nI had come here a bunch of times soon after moving to the city, but there was about a four-year lapse in between visits.  Even when I resumed coming here semi-regularly, I wasn't terribly consistent, and months would pass before I'd remember just how special this place was.  And then I came here on my last birthday with my brother and my nephew, and I've probably visited more times in the last six months than I had in the previous six years.  It helps, of course, that I've been either under- or unemployed during this time--OK, it doesn't really \"help\" anyone, but having a lot of time on your hands is good for some things.\n\nPlants are amazing.  We all know this, but we don't think about it often enough.  Yes, animals are amazing as well.  And certain geological features.  And views, especially of large bodies of water whose edges you can't see.  But plants.  Besides oxygen and water, they're the basis of all animal existence.  Actually, they produce oxygen and provide many animals with their only source of water, so there's no \"besides\" about it.  \n\nI love the hard-to-find labels for the random South American plants.  I love the tree whose bark looks like it's made of copper.  I love all the redwoods and the weird hedged-in amphitheater that slightly resembles the site of some ancient cultic human-sacrifice locale.  I love the trails and the strange workers' buildings that are scarily deserted and inhabited at the same time.  I love walking up and then down.  I love the strange rain birds and sod and wood chips and non-botanical-garden-looking areas, the strange leaves that hang down and that squirrels often seem to fall off of, the grebes in their pond.  I absolutely love the fact that I've had important conversations with old friends here.  I sometimes regret the fact that I never brought other dear people here, and this makes me think about them and what they're doing, but even this regret is softened by the surroundings; appropriately enough, I'm often in the Botanical Garden when I'm thinking about these people, and although an intention is never as good as an action--it's never the thought that counts--it is comforting to be in a safe, reassuring place when I'm feeling down.\n\nI also like to read here.  And to want to read here but to get too caught up in thinking to be able to get any reading done.  I wanted to write here at one point, but then I decided not to, and I haven't changed my mind about that yet.\n\nI want to be angry that they're now charging non-San Francisco residents to visit, but I can't really be angry with the Botanical Garden.  I'm not even sure that it should be free for anyone, and I've always left some donation every time I've visited, even when I haven't been working.\n\nSometimes, it's too easy to get angry.  I know too many things bother me too much.  This doesn't really have anything to do with the Botanical Garden itself, but being here is definitely a healing experience, almost every time.  If you're able to, be sure to visit at different times of the day and in different weather.  You might not think a foggy day is the best time to visit a botanical garden, but you'd be surprised, especially if you've also been here when it's sunny.\n\nIt's been a little bit more than two-and-a-half years since I began writing Yelp reviews, and in one of the first reviews I wrote, I thanked Amy for introducing me to Park Chow.  Well, Amy, thank you for introducing me to the Botanical Garden as well.  I don't know whether you read Yelp or whether you even live in the Bay Area anymore; but I will always be glad I met you and that you, an East Bay-ophile through and through, introduced me, a recently minted San Franciscan, to one of the most beautiful places amid these forty-nine square miles of ours.  Even if we have to agree to disagree about Hemingway and other virtuosic suicides, I will always consider you an eminently intelligent, thoughtful, and beautiful person.

Eating cheese and drinking wine whilst sitting upon a red and white checkered sheet, for instance. Practicing Tai Chi in the early light of the morning. Making paper boats and floating them in the pond, waiting giddily to see how the turtles and the water birds that live there would react. A spirited game of frisbee. Making out while hiding in the bushes next to the tiny creek. Or, taking hallucinogenic drugs and staring dopily at the strange flowers. \n\nAnd, right about the same time I had that last thought, I noticed the squirrels. Dozens of them -- every single one fearless. They crawl right up to your shoes to beg for food -- you could kick one if you wanted to. But you don't want to because they're squirrels and squirrels are adorable. Right? And so I just stomped my feet and the one that was about to crawl up my pants leg scampered back. But he only scampered back like 6 inches! And, five more squirrels emerged form the underbrush. Theses little fuckers are probably responsible for no less than half of the children that go missing in San Francisco. I don't doubt that these squirrels could devour any living creature weighing less than 95 lbs. I started throwing berries at them and running for my life.\n\nAs I was catching my breath, I decided that, while most of my ideas about the Botanic Garden still held true, the hallucinogenic drug thing probably wouldn't be the best option.", "author": "Ben P."}

My friends and I decided we wanted to forgo the entire BBQ experience (all of us were vegetarians at one point) and take in a little nature instead. This was mostly from the suggestion of my biology major friend, who wanted to impress us with her extensive knowledge and large vocabulary of everything plant-ey. We also thought that since it was memorial day weekend, and as such most people spend time with their families, going to the Botanical garden would be nice and relaxing. \n\nWRONG! \n\nEverybody and your cousin's hairdresser was there! There were little kids complaining about smelly flowers, depressed teenagers trying to escape family gatherings, hazardous flying frisbees, fat little pugs chasing the cheeky little squirrels and a Chinese WEDDING PHOTO SHOOT (honestly, point taken). After dodging out of the way of a toothy grandmother who looked like she might trap us in her gingerbread house around the next bend, we finally decided to ditch the little paths and go for the open grassy fields, kite-bearing frisbee tossers or no. And all of this while enduring bio facts like 'hey, Aminah, did you know that cashew oil is used in airline brake fluid?' No, I didn't. Did you?\n\nOnce dropping into that grassy safety, ready to get sun burnt and dehydrated, I thought all was well. Until my bio friend started with the facts.

The squirrels are very friendly, coming up to you even, although they won't sit still.  My guide said that it's because they are trying to get food from you.  Do not feed them!\n\nMy final stop was the library, which I would not recommend for browsing.  It's really only good if you are looking for something specific.

Yes, I'll be cocky and say I like to see how other places stack up with their botanical gardens.\nWell, San Francisco, I stand before you and tell you this:  I am impressed.  I was skeptical when I saw the small footprint this garden has in the park, but man can you pack a lot of different habitats into a mere 55 acres!  I counted six continents represented (seven if you count Gondwana in the Primitive Plants garden).  There was a lot of construction going on when I was there, but most of the grounds were open.  The garden of fragrance was a hidden treat, as were all the different regional gardens (New Zealand, SE Asia, Meso-American Cloud Forest, Etc.).  I must say however, after living for a year on the Humboldt County coast, I find the Redwood Trail to be adorable.  I just kept thinking, 'you guys are what six, maybe seven decades old?  spring chickens!'  In a couple centuries though those trees will be quite impressive.\nOverall, I wish there was more room to expand each climate zone.  I'd love to see a Mediterranean garden that encompasses more than a single acre of park, for example, so as measured against size and research capability I give you four stars, but as a measure of biodiversity, you are head and shoulders above anything I've seen so far in my humble travels.

Or at least don't charge if you have an 'in-outowner' with you. This is the best place to take your non-college or only fun with alcohol friends. A walk with your visiting parent, uncle, grandparent, cousin, grand-kids, recovering alcoholic etc. is perfect here. Its not usually that crowded and you can get lost in there pretty easily. The Australian area and the redwood area are my favorite. Perfect place to bring a book and enjoy little \"Micro Environments\" without out normal GG park vagrants and dog pushers.. SFers love their micro climates, unfortunately you're stuck with the inner sunset climate, but you at least get a little taste of the outside world and forget you are in a big city for a few minutes or hours while you visit.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-06-19", "description": "The Garden is one of the best maintained and most impressive features of Golden Gate Park. No matter when you go, some colorful plants are sure to be in bloom. Spring, of course, is a wonderful time to experience the Garden, as the cherry, apple and magnolia trees are in bloom and colorful annuals line the paths.  But the diversity of plants in the garden ensures that no matter what time of year you visit, you will be overwhelmed by the many colors, textures, and types of plants. \n The main pond and lawn are popular areas; there are almost always people picnicking, feeding birds and squirrels, and walking in these areas. These are certainly places to enjoy; in the pond you can see large fish swimming their way through the murky waters, and there are always many turtles sunning themselves on rocks or drifting lazily through the water. \n Given all these people in the main areas, it is astonishing how few people you will see in the peripheral gardens where some of the most impressive parts of the Garden lie. The size of the Botanical Garden is impressive; each time I come here I discover some new bed or a tiny, carefully landscaped pond. I've also noticed, in my repeated visits, how often a bed has been added or improved. The vastness and variability of this garden make me think it must be nearly impossible to maintain, but it is clear the garden has a dedicated staff because the grounds are always in beautiful shape.", "author": "Kathleen B."}

On colder days the pond is full of little micro U-boat like spies.  Just pairs of nostrils popping up above the water as they swim on by.

Its free and a good place to walk off lunch. Overall there is something in bloom here year around and you can see everyone enjoys the gardens since they are well maintain and plus the lawns they have are perfect just to relax and sun yourself. Its a little escape from the busy of the city. One thing for sure I never seen so many squirrels in my life all in one place. Its a clan and everywhere you turn you would find one. They are not afraid of people either, coming real up close to you. Probably thinking you had food for them and they are more than willing to pose for pictures. You can tell they are well feed since all of them are all plump and have bushy tails. I must say if I was a squirrel I would want to live here too, its heaven. I would like to come back in the spring when everything is in bloom and check out all the flowers. Great place for a walk.", "author": "Donna Y."}

Many different types of plants, not just flowers.  The building was EXTREMELY humid, would highly recommend a tank top for the sweating factor in here, but it was well worth it.  Make sure you get all the way to the eastern end.  There is a beautiful pond with gorgeous lillys.", "author": "andrea c."}

They have wonderful plant sales most every month, too, full of temptations to add to my garden.  The California native gardens are wonderful in the spring!

I wish I was so easily amused now, but then again, I think I may be. These gardens never lose their charm for me. Growing up in San Francisco made me very horticulturally deprived. No front yard, only a communal backyard that was really just a slab of cement in a 10x12 space. No wonder I am so obsessed with botanical gardens and flowers in general. It doesn't matter where I go in the world, I always have to see the city's Garden. The Grand Dame of them all, of course, being in London. Kew Gardens is amazing and grandiose on a big scale but come on, that's London. I must admit, it's the most impressive I've ever seen but our Botanical Garden does a mighty good job of standing it's own here in SF. I love the Conservatory, not only for it's displays but it's history and I was so excited when it finally reopened. The outside gardens are just gorgeous and I can still lose myself in them just as I did over a decade ago when I would look for little elves hiding amongst the flowers. Suffice to say, all I found were bums and Haight street punks drinking Robitussin, but we all have to grow up sometime. I still hold a shred of my rosy colored youth in spite of it. ;-) They also offer lots of neat classes and bird walking tours, among others. I can watch the birds and squirrels there for hours, so see, I guess I still am easily amused!", "author": "Brittany A."}

We walked around for a couple of hours, and were constantly saying \"Wow.\", \"Look at that.\", \"This is so beautiful.\"  Lots of special trees, plants and flowers, beautifully landscaped gardens, lots of information, and it's all free.  Special mention of the redwood forest, so peaceful and calm.  I will definitely be back with a good book on a sunny day.", "author": "Marijke D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-08-01", "description": "Green, violent violet, red.  The colors just flow all around.  It's the one place in the park that actually smells good.  That and they have the highest concentration of squirrels.  I love squirrels and everything that has to do with them, especially feeding them.  They're such rascals, jumping all over me, clawing their way to claim that nut, one that they will bury for the winter that is many months away.  Squirrels do not understand the notion of immediate satisfaction.  The only downside is the duck pond.  Maybe it's just me, but I do not think it would be that difficult to put city money to use in finding a better way of keeping that waterhole clean.  Thankfully, that pond is only a minute fraction of what the park offers.  There an innumerable number of trails one could take, allowing a person to get lost in their own fanciful pursuits.  On sunny days, the park outshines itself, taking on an almost distant feel from the rest of the city.  I've enjoyed walking through there since I was really young, and it has unparalleled beauty.  It exudes a calm that washes over me, permitting a release from all else that exists beyond its non-pearly gates.  And of course there are the squirrels.  Can't forget the squirrels.  They're my friends.", "author": "Alexander S."}
