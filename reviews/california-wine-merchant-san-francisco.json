I arrived with a colleague who, after spending time in the defense sector, had a service dog for panic attacks. When the management asked about the dog's service, my friend clarified that the dog would alert her about the onset of anxiety attacks. After serving us, the manager then grabbed the wine out of our hands and informed us that they only permit service dogs for people with physical disabilities- not mental or psychiatric ones. This was not only humiliating to my friends and me but also a clear violation of the law. I have never seen such atrocious treatment of human beings before.

After a very terrible happy hour, I walked into California Wine Merchant to collect my thoughts and sit down for a moment. A calming vinyl was playing, and the bar was full of calm and happy couples that seemed relaxed amongst anything. Chelsea behind the bar instantly poured me a glass of phenomenal Sauvignon Blanc, which I proceeded to buy a bottle of almost immediately after tasting. She was light-hearted, attentive, and knowledgeable of the wine behind the bar. I instantly felt at home, but even more so once I met her parents (and the owners- Greg and Deb). The entire family was upbeat, jovial, and made me feel entirely at home, even though I'm 2,000 miles away from my own family!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-10", "description": "What else can I say, the California Wine Merchant is hands down the best wine bar in San Francisco and maybe all of California for that matter. That statement might raise a few eyebrows, but they have been doing this since 1974 (before the Paris Tasting of 1976 that put California wine on the International stage). It seems like a new trendy wine bar opens up every week in the Bay Area that is pouring overpriced and generally bad wine. Most of it is from California and there is no shortage of mass produced bad wine in this state and people usually don't know the difference (if this is you just go to the Marina Safeway). The owner here (Greg) and his wife (Deborah) go out of their way to find the best small production wines from across the world and bring them to your doorstep. Weekly free tastings by the wine makers for club members make this a no brainer for people living in SF and don't want to make the 3 - 4 hour round trip to wine country and deal with the hassle of booking private tastings. It's an amazing value and experience if you enjoy good wine and live in SF. Just avoid Friday & Saturday, since those days bring out the absolute worst crowd in the Marina - particularly at this place and it's impossible to deliver a great customer experience under the circumstances. If you love good wine and a variety, consolidate your wine club memberships and add this one to your portfolio!", "author": "Russ Z."}

Sad because, California Wine Merchant is much of what it advertises itself to be.    A cozy bar that features high caliber wines from small exceptional wineries.  A perfect place for two girlfriends to meet after work about 6:00PM, and it was. Originally. Then at about 7:00 one bartender decided to turn it into the Fillmore.   We asked our server, being at the end of the bar if he would return the volume to a level that allowed you to have a conversation with your wine.  He did.  Then this arrogant little man who also sadly resides behind the bar turned it right back up. Right in front of us.  Repeating the request, our server, who was lovely, again turned down the volume.  The response of his coworker was to walk right over and turn it up.  This happened 4 times. It was only 7:00 PM. We should have left, but my girlfriend was only halfway through her cheese plate, and we had full glasses of wine.  Our original server stopped by to see if we were enjoying our evening. I told her the story, and that I suppose we're not the demographic they are looking for. As long as they  employ wanna be cool  jerks that have no comprehension of service.

My socks weren't knocked off. I want to stress that the options that were available were pretty darn good and they do have quite a few wines that I find are usually difficult to locate, so it's not all bad. \n\nSimply stated - I don't feel like this would ever be a planned destination spot when desiring a wine bar, BUT I wouldn't pass it up when in the neighborhood if jonesin' for a quick prosecco or zin to throw back... \nIn a pinch, it'll do just fine.", "author": "Kris I."}

We found a perfectly secluded spot at the end of the bar, where we were not obliged to share counter space with the other patrons. I did not really notice the decor of the place because the lights were dimmed so low, but I really appreciated the purse hooks at the bar. I love it when establishments take consideration of this little (but so major!) detail.\n\nAs we were reading off the menu, the place filled up around 9:30 p.m.  with a late twenties plus crowd. We had planned to do tastings to \"research\" for her wedding reception.  I thought cake tasting was fun, but I think taking alcohol notes is the winner here.  CWM is my first experience at a wine bar, and it was pretty cool. I have had my fair share of wineries and tasting rooms, but the wine bar scene is not comparable. There was minimal dialogue with our server, which was completely fine because we were engrossed in our own conversation. Maybe she was being respectful, or maybe this is simply not a place where you should expect to be personable with the other side of the bar. It was a busy night. Glasses were continiously getting filled with the reds and whites.  The other people there seemed to enjoy their time with their own little parties, and no one else looked interested in talking with the pourers either.  Nonetheless our winetender was friendly, and she made great reccomendations as our night progressed from Sauvignon blanc to Cabernet Sauvignon.  \n\nWe loved the Spanish Lo Nuevo 2011 Lunares Verdejo and the Napa Roots Run Deep Educated Guess 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon. If these are on your menu tonight (wines are constantly rotating,) make sure at least one of them gets poured.", "author": "Catherine Ann C."}

The music is usually something Indie rock like Spoon, Death Cab... The bartenders seem very hipstery. The crowd, well you know it's Marina. I have had many fun times here, despite the fact that they do have the worse cheese plate in the world. The cheese place is basically bread, one kind of non-descript cheese, olives and pistachios.  It's really an \"I'm desperately hungry\" cheese plate and not an \"I want to enjoy cheese\" type of cheese plate. \n\nI like that they have wines by the glass for every budget, starting at 8 bucks a glass to 22 a glass, a good selection and I generally like the place. \n\nI would give one more star if it weren't for the cheese plate.", "author": "Kristina A."}

The seats were definitely filled and one of the bartenders... err.. no.. wine connoisseurs? ... wine pourers?... anyway, PEOPLE who work there got us two seats near some of the bottles towards the back. It was nice and he let us know ... the guys at the counter are a little weird anyway... It was a good spot to chill and peruse their extensive wine menu until we got our wine. Some people left the counter and we swooooped their spots.\n\nThe worst part about this place is that they really didn't have any of my favorite wines. I'm pretty sure every time I would ask them for something that I wanted (and didn't see on the menu right away), they were like.. oh we're out OR oh... we don't carry that. I thought that, in the marina, they would have special wines and not just your run of the mill reds and whites. I really just like what tastes good - I really am not snobby or know enough to say what flavors are in each wine... but I just remember the names of good wine.. like.. Barberas, Viognier, Gewurtztraminer, Rose, etc. They were either out of what I wanted or didn't carry them. What, really?!\n\nThe upside to this is that I would get tastings of some wines that they did have that were similar to what I wanted because they didnt have what I actually wanted. I got to have miniature tastings of a lot of different wines but I couldn't really enjoy what I wanted... For a wine specialty place, I expected a bit more. Maybe that's my bad.

At the end  I was asked by the bartender tonight would you like the check?  yes, all of a sudden she comes back with it charged to one credit card we were going split it. Very unprofessional just not an experience that I think was deemed a place that I would  recommend or come back to. Which is unfortunate because the place has great potential.

When I went to the restroom it looked like someone's St. Bernard had gone for a dip and then shaken himself dry in the bathroom.  I was almost afraid to go in there was so much water everywhere.  I do have to append this note because even though I did get to experience the wet dog runoff, the next time I was up the bathroom was clean - so staff did have their act together and it was more a problem with a patron than with CA Wine Merchant.\n\n2.  When comparing the the bottle price with the / glass price of their dryest champagne I noted that the bottle was $40 and a glass was $17.  We had reason to celebrate and even with corkage, we would come out way ahead by buying the bottle and there seemed to be some question if this was acceptable for us to do - buy a bottle and open it and consume it right there.\n\nThe last thing I would warn folks about is that if you have to use the bathroom, stay sober.  I mean, stay sober anyway, but especially if you are here and expect to have to use the facilities.  The steps are skinny and steep and I watched one drunk fool try to navigate them with a bad outcome.  There were no injuries, but he ended up sitting on the stairs and everyone below him and above him was trapped for a few minutes while he regained his bearings.

I think if I go here on a week night or a Sunday, I will like this place more.  I love wine but I don't love standing in an aisle precariously holding on to a $15 dollar glass of chintzily poured Cabernet and getting bumped into every 10 seconds by huge purses and sleazy old men who feel the need to pass by a dozen times before interrupting our conversation with, \"Hi...you girls definitely don't look like virgins.\"  Um, yeah.  Brace yourself, ladies.\n\nOverall selection is nice if you like California wines, though I did find the prices a little steep.  Great place to do some tasting if you can find a seat at the bar.  Not so great for a Saturday Girls Night Out.", "author": "Erin H."}

I've come to terms with the crazy prices, but I can't get over how bad the service it.  The first challenge is actually getting a menu.  You have to ask for one because a server will never acknowledge you on their own.  But then you need to beg for their attention in order to actually order a glass of wine.  (You'd think that if you ask for a menu, they would assume you are going to order soon and would keep an eye out to assist you when you are ready.  But they are oblivious of this nuance.)  The girl with the long hair is the worse, but the guy with the glasses is almost as bad.  And it's not necessarily because they are busy with other customers.

But if nothing else, CWM stands out as by far the most crowded wine bar I've ever been to (thank you, Marina!).  Still, it managed to stay far more cordial than boisterous, and it was plenty easy to hear yourself give your friends dubious relationship advice (it being the low-inhibition end of the evening, after all).  Somebody in our group stuck a delicious glass of Syrah into my hand, but I have no idea what it cost (safe to say it's a bit pricey here, though).

Once a small, dark, hole-in-the-wall store on Pierce Street, the California Wine Merchant took their eviction news rather well. Since the move, their business has tripled. And their do-it-yourself wine bar idea has made them the kings of the pour. Make sure to use this place as a wine store too ... the staff is not shy and will help you find the best of the cheap, or the best of the not-so-cheap.

It was packed on a Wednesday night, but not your typical douche bags, this place has cool, fun clientele, it's a bit more of hard drinking wine bar if that makes sense, so the crowd is all ages and fairly energized. I've met some really cool people here, which defeats my waffling Marina hatred, and this place is really just a good ol' fashioned loud bar, who happens to carry some of the best wines ever by the glass. That's the bottom line here, the wines are the best California has to offer, and the bartenders per usual made perfect recommendations that were spot on and totally unique. I had an O'Connor Pinot, which I'd never heard of which was great, a Lucia Pinot, which I've never seen by the glass anywhere else, it was divine, finally at the playful advocation by the cute girls next to me had a T-Vine Grenache, which was extraordinary, and I think only they carry the wine. So the bar is super loud, super cramped, and super expensive, you can't get these wines anywhere else, and I don't think they are trying to be a quiet wine bar, they're open until 1:30 in the morning, the bartenders are more like Mission hipsters, the crowd was the whole Marina-un-Marina thing, good loud music, though the prices are definitely Marina, you're getting what you pay for.

On Monday nights, someone from a vineyard will visit from 6pm to 9pm and you can taste everything they brought for $15.", "author": "K S."}

That expectation was disappointed.  Their selection of local wines was limited and didn't include much of anything you can't buy at a wine shop in Chicago. The place is pretty small, but the people behind the bar were nice.", "author": "PG M."}

You can take a bottle from their shelves and pay a small corkage and drink with friends.  Stand in the back for more room or sit in the front for the open-air feeling.  The bartenders are all pretty nice.  Great place to hang.", "author": "Brian L."}

And, you always run into someone you know in the Marina crowd; however, the oftentimes rude service is not eclipsed by the positives on most nights.", "author": "Heather S."}

Lots of big, bold, rich flavors.  The place gets really, really packed, but its well worth it for the great wine.  I would say this place is the best in comparison to the others I've been into the city like SNOB, Baccus, and Cav", "author": "William S."}
