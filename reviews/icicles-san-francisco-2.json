Looked pretty sketchy from the outside after dark, and was kinda weird inside too...like a cross between a pharmacy and a nightclub.  \n\nThere was no wait, so once we figured out how the ordering process worked, it was smooth sailing.   The staff was friendly and helpful, and although pricey for my midwestern experience, the prices were in line with everything else I'd bought in San Francisco.  You can also choose unlimited toppings, so you really can get your money's worth if you load it up.   \n\nI'd never had rolled ice cream before, so this was a new experience.  The process was entertaining to watch, and the result was a work of art as well as delicious!  Don't let the unorthodox interior fool you....this is a perfect spot for a sweet treat after dinner or anytime of day!   Highly recommended!", "author": "Amanda E."}

There were seating areas but they weren't the sturdiest and were a bit dirty. \n\nFood (3.5/5): I got the Teas Me (thai iced tea + matcha); however, I didn't taste any of the matcha, which made me a bit sad as the thai iced tea ice cream overpowered the ice cream rolls. I would suggest instead of mixing the two flavors to maybe do them side-by-side, as I would have enjoyed tasting some of the matcha.

You have a personal ice cream maker, and they let you customize certain parts of the ice cream which is nice.\n\nAs a part of the steep price, they let you choose any amount of toppings that you want. Since I got avocado ice cream, I only went with condensed milk and mochi. The mochi was so chewy and bouncy!

The employees are fairly courteous and quick, and the ice cream is pretty and reasonable tasting, but it is also pretty expensive.\n\nThe flavors that they have a pretty interesting - almost too interesting. There were only a couple that I am interested in, but perhaps my tastes are just too vanilla (pun intended). I've tried the butterface a few times. It is good, but not the greatest thing I have ever tasted, especially for about $9. This $9 gets you a good amount of ice cream, but I would much rather have a smaller amount of ice cream for less money (they only have one size). This is why I don't go here regularly.\n\nOther than that, I do really appreciate that they have many toppings, and you can choose as many as you want and not pay extra (I believe). The toppings are pretty standard for an ice cream shop.

By that time, it was somewhat melted and soft (understandably so), but you can easily put it in a freezer to make it firm again (though it might also freeze your toppings).\n\nI got the Butterface flavor (cookie butter with graham crackers) and topped it with strawberries and mochi.  My date ordered Gotcha Matcha (matcha with bit of cream and sugar) with blueberries and mochi.  I liked Butterface since I'm a fan of cookie butter and I liked how the crumbs of graham cracker added a bit of texture to the rolled ice cream.  This one tends to be on the sweeter side so it's best to choose your toppings carefully.  Mochi were a bit stiff and chewy for my taste.  The Gotcha Matcha was pretty good too- not super bitter since the cream mellowed it out (probs not for those who love super strong matcha flavor).  \n\nIt's quite a large portion- I ended up saving half of mine for later given how thick the ice cream is.\n\nAll in all, good enough ice cream that I would order from again!

Do not let this place's appearance fool you. Although it is not themed or decorated the quality of the product is what matters.\n\nThe ice cream, which shouldn't be called ice cream, all start from their base vanilla custard. From there you pick and choose the flavors. Each cup has a theme, for example, Nutella and chill or the one I got which was the Ferrari. It is based on the typical ingredients you would expect from a night in Rome. The base of the cup is made up of chocolate chunks, amaretto nuts, Nutella, and the custard. From there you go to the toppings bar. This place is a total standout because you get unlimited toppings for the price you pay. Make sure to ask for them, because the attendant will be pushing you to stop at two or three. Also there are some self serve, like graham cookies and other cereals outside the toppings bar, and some that are not which was a little confusing.

That completely justified the $9 ice cream. It was a fun experience. There are a few things I would note. \n\nFirst, there is very little room to sit. If you expect to have a place to relax and hang out to enjoy your beautiful ice cream, don't plan on it here. We went late at night after a movie at the metreon, and were confronted with a difficult choice of what to do once we got our ice cream. It's not really a great place to just hang around outside, and at night the park is not a nice place to be. The metreon was closing down so we couldn't sit there either. \n\nSecond, and this is likely largely because it's a soft opening, it looks a bit haphazard.

The service was really fast, and no fuss, since I've been to places where they take FOREVER chopping and whatever else they do before they actually roll the ice cream. Unlimited toppings is awesome - although the steep price of almost $10 for the entire thing definitely will cover whatever your heart desires. Their toppings are pretty standard frozen yogurt toppings like brownie bites, cheese cake bites, mochi, fruit, etc. Its a super sweet treat! Check it out.", "author": "Ke C."}

Rolled ice Cream is pretty to look at, however it doesn't taste all that great. It tastes like insanely sweet non churned ice cream. Doesn't have a cream consistency, more like an unmeltable sweet dessert rolled into a shape that's even harder to eat! Ha'. I wouldn't say it's a waste of $18 (for me and my husband), but rather i wanted to experience what the fuss was about, and was sorely disappointed. At least i know now that i won't be returning to ANY rolled ice cream establishment. \n\nRolled ice cream = Millenial's version of Coldstone Creamery back when it was cool -- minus the taste. It was hardly edible. \n\nAt least there's no line! One of the girls with a well endowed chest likes to chop the ice cream in a fashion that really entertains the guest! LOL!", "author": "Kay H."}

It's not in the best part of town but the ice cream makes up for it! For about 9$ you get ton of ice cream rolled into a large cup. You get to choose from a semi lg selection and you get all the free toppings you want. What is different from other stores is they make the ice cream in front of you on a frozen metal board- a bit like cold stone where they mix in what flavors and items you want and mix them in- but the difference is they pour the cream in a liquid form and it freezes while you watch. Makes the experience personal and cool! We ordered the peanut butter and jelly - and the Nutella and banana (Nutella chill) along the rock and roll ( rocky road) let me tell you - we visited each day we were there and will be going back. Delish! This place rocks and it's totally calorie worthy. Great job.\nPlace is clean and the staff is super nice.

Maybe it was the sprinkles or the bananas that were piled sky high on it.  Either way, it made quite the mess when trying to get a spoonful out of the cup.

It was just absolutely delicious and a unique way to eat ice cream. When I saw Icicles in the city across from the wall, I could not stop myself from checking it out. The setup is pretty easy in that you look at the menu, order at the register, and then head over to the station where they will get your dessert squared away with toppings picked afterwards. All prices include toppings so pick wisely. They have around 12- 15 different types of unique combinations so there is plenty of options for any type of ice cream lover. They had an Ube option with coconut so I had to go with that since that is the latest hook I am on. \n\nEach of the ice cream rollers were extremely friendly to customers while having chit chat as they made the deliciousness. The process is relatively quick but there was no line when we had walked in whereas by the time we walked out, there was a decent sized line ready to chow down. We added the mochi and condensed milk as the toppings for the ice cream at the end. The ice cream itself was good although it had a \"heavier texture and taste\" than the one I had in korea making it hard for me to eat a lot of it but it is perfect to share and is certainly worth the experience.

I remember this used to be Icebee that sold froyo that I went to all the time in high school.\n\nThe two guys working here were super friendly and have great knowledge about the shop - something I don't commonly see.\n\nAt a flat rate of $8.75, you get a flavor and limitless toppings. It may sound pricey but you get $8.75 worth because it was A LOT. I couldn't finish it and I didn't have breakfast nor lunch. It would be nice if they had a smaller option because it almost felt like too much. Definitely recommend sharing with someone.\n\nI got a Nutella and Chill per their recommendation. It includes heavy cream, graham crackers and Nutella. After they finish making the ice cream rolls, the toppings process is pretty similar to many froyo places. Like a kid in a candy store, I got way too many toppings and they're pretty generous with the toppings.\n\nThe texture was pretty viscous and held together pretty well (it didn't ista-melt like other places). I'm not 100% familiar with rolled ice cream but noticed each roll fused back together into cylinders - is it normal or was it rolled too tight? I'm going to assume it's that viscountess and need to be on a lookout when I check other places out next time.\n\nThey also have a $1 off Yelp check-in promo that I missed seconds after paying - oh well next time.", "author": "Judy C."}

If part way through you want more toppings there are dispensers with graham crackers crumbs, Oreo bits, etc. you can dispense on your own.\n\nIf I had one suggestion it would be that I wish they had peanut butter sauce as a topping. I'm sure I'll go back soon and bring my family.", "author": "Laura S."}

I discovered icicles from Yelp and found out that they serve my favorite Strawberry Fantasy Ice Cream Rolls. Carol, the person who rolled my Ice Cream did a fantastic job! She did not only give me a fantastic experience but even explained to me all the flavors and toppings they had and even recommended me which one is best with which! The best part of this experience is how they allow you to put unlimited toppings with your rolls. Which not many rolled ice cream places allow you to do! \n\nOverall, my experience with Carol was the best because she made the Strawberry Fantasy Rolled Ice Cream super delicious with a gorgeous smile! I will definitely be back for some more Rolled Ice Cream! Maybe even the flavors that Carol suggested!", "author": "Carrie L."}

It was fun watching the workers mix it up as it froze to make ice cream. Then to have it in a thin rolled up, made it a special treat. The endless toppings were fun but a little over whelming. I did however try the smoked marshmallow. It was a toasted perfectly with no burnt part. I thought it was a good treat, however I did think it was on the pricey side considering it was ice cream. $9.25 wow!!!

You watch them pour the cream on the freezing stone, they start mixing, blending, and rolling up the ice cream. We ordered Oreo and Strawberry lemonade. A six year old (read: pick water) are the entire cup. They only have one size. At other places, the 6 yr old eats a little bit, then puts it away. Nope,scrapped the bottom of the cup.

We ordered at 7:25 and we actually got our ice cream at 8:02. On mine for toppings all I wanted was mochi so I kindly asked for a little more when she put the one little scoop on, she told me that I could get as many topping as I wanted but not  a double portion of one, DUMB. The second ice cream wasn't even frozen all the way and literally looked like a milkshake when we got it. After waiting a half hour we didn't even want it remade so we just got a refund.
