My truest love is for that particular breed of San Diego taquerias that grill their tortillas and wrap them up in wax paper, almost all of which have names that contain \"bertos.\"  At the right time of the night, I will even find some love for Taco Bell.  So you know, my Mexican food love knows no bounds.  \n\nBut there is a special place in my heart for a friendly, low-key, comfortable sit-down restaurant where beans and rice are always on the side of a plate that (you're sure to be forewarned) is too hot to touch.  Where my margarita glass always seems to be empty, even though I just refilled it (seriously, how does that happen?).  Puerto Alegre is solidly excellent Mexican food.  At least four stars just on the strength of the Mama's Special (cheese enchilada and a chile relleno) alone, which I can't seem to move past on the menu.  The service is fast and friendly.  And I always have a great time there. So glad the Mission still has room for places like this.", "author": "Quinton H."}

I explain to him that we are waiting to grab a seat at the bar momentarily but he continues to be in my face.  I thought that perhaps he didn't understand me, so I told him that I would talk to my friend and tell my friend that he was trying to say.  My friend who speaks Spanish better then went to talk to him, and this guy goes off on my friend.  We decided to leave, but this rude manager starts cussing as we are leaving, not really sure why that is necessary. \n\nI live and work in the area and used to bring many of my coworkers here for lunch and never had a problem. The food is okay, but I will NEVER bring anyone from my workplace here.  You lost a loyal customer.

Any Mexican restaurant I visit to this day, the food and drinks are benchmarked to my favorites here.\n\nToday I returned with my children and though I wish they weren't picky eaters that is my (fingers crossed (temporary)) current plight in life. \n\nTwo things of note, my fond memories were validated and of bigger note, my finicky young eaters absolutely LOVED the food. My son even went so far as to say their rice was better than cake and pizza. I love the food here but I do love the occasional piece of cake or pizza and though the rice was great for me I'm not sure it would be better than cake.

They currently invite local Latino artist to display art (for sale) throughout the restaurant walls, and well then there is the drinks.....another story.

However, this review is about the LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE and extremely rude staff. I came in with a group of about 3-4 people, waiting on 1-2 ppl join. It wasn't a busy night, in fact Wednesday around 8pm. Two of our party arrived early and sat at the bar in seat, and ordered drinks. I joined and our group was told NO ONE can stand at the bar. Totally fine, however it the manager or bartender or lead guy who was walking around being VERY rude to people including our party. He snapped at us, told us he can only speak to one person when all we asked was our whole party is here can we be seated. He was so rude, and instead we went next door to West of Pecos who told us they wouldn't be rude to us we could stand anywhere and instead got seated right away. Awesome food and we were glad to give West of Pecos $250 of our business. I use to love this spot but I'm sure anyone who wants a nice dinner out wants to be treated rudely because a manager doesn't like his life. I was going to take friends visiting from out of the country to authentic Mexican but NOW I will NEVER consider here.

I never thought much more of it nor returned but I presumed the food must have been pretty darn good. Now that I've been, I can safely say it's probably the margaritas and not the food. \n\nNot that the food is bad but it's just not memorable. They are good accompaniments to the booze but stand out little beyond that. I had the Milanesa (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vp1VTH08YSA9O9w6ej-G0A?select=-TGpalOTGPbhPe2lSQpJDA) and while I wished the breading wasn't falling off the meat, it tasted alright. \n\nBut I guess the star of the show is the margarita.

YIKES, parking was horrendous, but the entire district was popping! Anyway... onto the actual review of the restaurant...\n\nFood: I got the super carne asada burrito. Let me tell you right now, this is probably ONE OF THE BEST burritos I have had!! (Which is sort of funny, because we all went to El Farolito after drinking... haha. That was good too!) When this burrito shows up on the Yelp suggestions on mobile, definitely get it! It comes drenched in a tomato paste (i think) and is savory and succulent. Me eating this burrito sober is like eating a Golden Boy or El Farolito or Senores pizza drunk (sorry, best analogy I can come up with). \n\nI had a taste of the enchiladas and tamales; those were pretty good too.

My usual dish? Cheese enchiladas. Hands down the best green and red mole sauce and I have a tough time deciding between the two sauces.

They always were pretty skimpy with their chips but now they serve only one small container of salsa, not the 2 different types we used to get. Unfortunately, they appear to be following the common pattern of raising prices while lowering quality.\n\nStopped by again today. seated quickly as usual and one container of salsa with chips arrived almost as we were sitting down. When our plates arrived I asked what happened to the 2 salsas they used to serve routinely and the nice young woman brought 2 more containers. I would say what i wrote last time is still accurate--less flavor than in the past and weak Margaritas. why not just forgo the Happy Hour special price and serve full-flavored drinks at the usual cost? I suppose we're expected to just order more Margaritas hoping that the flavor will build up, if only in our imagination as whatever alcohol they contain accumulates in our brains. I would say I've been disappointed the last couple of visits and I sure don't feel like hunting for another Mexican restaurant all over again.

I had fond memories of the atmosphere, good food and margaritas.  Sadly, this place has really slipped downward.  The food was not flavorful.  The crispy taco shell was like one of those pre formed shells you buy down the Mexican aisle in grocery stores.  Definitely not recently deep fried.  The refried beans were runny and not warm.  I ordered a chicken enchilada and beef taco.  Instead the meal came with a beef enchilada.  The rice was mediocre, rice-a-roni Spanish or Mexican rice is better.  The service has much to work on as well.  Server took our orders, the meal came before the drinks.  The drinks then came when we were already halfway through our meal.  Even the water we ordered we had to ask for twice.  My partner ordered a beer, when server finally came with drinks, the beer was missing and a margarita was given.  It took TWO more times to ask the server for the beer.  Sadly, this place is no longer a gem.  i will not be going here again.", "author": "Firecracker P."}

When we were seated we waited about 15 minutes before someone came around to ask what we wanted to drink, at which point we also ordered all of our food. The drinks were brought out a bout 10 minutes later, and then our waitress disappeared. \n\nNow we were sitting in the middle of the room, so it is kind of hard to ignore us, however our waitress was very talented and had no issue doing so. Not once did she check on us to see if we needed any sort of picture refill on our margaritas, or any of our water/soda glasses either. In fact, we didn't hear, nor see her again until she brought out our food. At this point she offered to refill drinks. After that, she was gone again. \n\nTime goes on, and it is beyond clear at this point that every single person at the table is done eating and then some. We had some people go outside for a smoke break, and come back and a good 20 minutes pass after we have all finished eating before our waitress magically appears again, and asks if we want dessert. Although, she only asks some of us at the table, not all of us. We all decline, and she leaves, and does not come back with our check. \n\nAnother 20 minutes goes by..she comes back, clears off our table and takes all of our plates, still no check. Ten more minutes later, still no check and we flag her down ourselves and ask for our check. This continues, with the long waits in between, up until the time we leave.\n\nThe only reason I am giving them three stars on this review, is for their food. The portions are rather large, and it tasted very good. If it wasn't for the food, I wouldn't have given them anything more than a 1 star rating.

The only reason I can't do 5 is because I am a burrito junkie and can only give their burrito 3.75 stars. Their wet super carne asada burrito is the first thing I ever ordered from this place and it was good, but too cheesy. I bet you are raising one eyebrow and pondering if this is even possible. Dude, I didn't know it was possible either. Don't get me wrong, I love cheese. I love unhealthy stuff. But the heaviness of the cheese was just too much. It overwhelmed the other ingredients. I have been back many times since then but haven't had the heart to try a burrito again. I really need to, because you never know, maybe I just got a heavy handed cheese obsessed burrito chef.\n\nAs for the rest of their food. AMAZING. 5 stars. If burritos weren't so important to me, this place would have 5 stars from me for sure. Their enchiladas are fantastic. Their refried beans are phenomenal. Their chile rellenos are great.

As far as price goes, see my comment below about the combos. You definately want to order this in the combo to get good value.\n\n- Chicken Quesadilla, cheesy and with shell that is not too thick or doughy. Very good and value for $3.35.\n\nA word on the combos. Personally I think the best deal is 3 item combo for 10.65 if you're hungry. But if you're not, the 2 items for $8.35 is good.

The food was not very authentic and it took over 30 minutes to have our food served! I got the grilled chicken burrito with guacamole and cheese, which was an extra $2. The majority of it was guacamole which got really gross after a while. Also all burritos are topped with their house sauce. I feel like my burrito was reheated because the sauce was dried on top like it had been microwaved. Overall I didn't enjoy my burrito that much, I barely could get through a third of it.\n\nMy BFF got the quesadilla which looked pretty average too. It wasn't the usual flat quesadilla, but more like a grilled mini burrito. Not what we expected. The boys got the fajita dishes but the majority of it was veggies and onions.

You know why there's a long wait?  Because this is a frickin' fabulous restaurant.  Good food, great drinks, reasonable prices, endless chips and salsa, and a boisterous atmosphere.  What more could you want?\n\nI've been several times and have brought several out-of-towners here and have never been disappointed - everyone I've been with here gives it rave reviews.  All of the dishes I've tried on their menu (and I've tried a lot) have been fantastic.  But I always seem to keep coming back to the enchiladas with the red mole sauce for some reason, so give them a try.\n\nAnd if the wait times are still a problem for you, here are two solutions:  1) Call ahead and make reservations, or 2) Put your name on the list and head to Blondie's next door for massive martinis and cocktail concoctions - whoever put these two places next to each other is a frickin' genius.", "author": "Zack B."}

Initially, we decided on Una Pizza Napoletana, but we didn't know it was only open Wed-Sat (wtf).\n\nAfter looking for something good and open at 9:30 pm, we eventually ended up on Valencia, being dependent on my friend's iPhone GPS (which really sucks). Luckily enough, I convinced my friend to not fall back on all those generic pizzerias that were open. Vegetarians don't trust many restaurants, so I really had to sell the random Mexican restaurant I found on the street. So getting to it\n\n---\n\nNice setting walking in. Very much for groups of people, as it had a bar inside. We were given a seat quickly, as it was less than 30 minutes from closing. Obviously, our munchie level was at an all time high (no pun intended). \n\n--- Our waitress was patient, nice, and kept bringing us more chips. We just got comfortable, got ourselves a some brews (a most interesting dos equis for me), and were ready. \n\n** The bottomless chips and salsa came in, and me and my friend scourged through that like locusts on wheat. The waiting staff immediately brought us even MORE chips with a huge scoop of guacamole to go with it. Divine stuff :) 5/5\n\n** Nachos (No Meat): These were as expected--which is a good thing! The tortilla chips were crisp, and they were all covered with guacamole, sour cream, cheese (I couldn't tell what cheese), and salsa. It's like Taco Bell's Nachos Bell Grande, except you know this won't make you sick hours later. I really liked it pre-meal, but it wasn't anything eye-opening. 3.5/5\n\n** Vegetarian Burrito: My friend got this: it was a monster sized burrito, but nothing he couldn't handle. The burrito (already wet with some sort of salsa), was filled with fajita veggies, beans, rice, guacamole, sour cream, and magic (jk). He told me it was too much for him, but he loved it. I'll give it a 5/5 from his part. \n\n** Combination Platter (Sope with shredded beef & taco with shredded chicken) with beans and rice: I loved this meal! I do wish I could pull a reversal and put the beef on the taco and chicken on the sope, but who cares? \n\nThe taco was great. The shell was really crunchy, and had its own distinctive taste, while the chicken was fresh, tender, and juicy (the sauces only complimenting it). I just wish the taco didn't fall apart on me. 4/5\n\nOK, so the sope is like a flat taco. I was trying to figure out how to eat it, but I just ended up using my fork and hands and dove in. The beef was real tasty, and the veggies were obviously fresh. I was very happy. 5/5\n\n------\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience, and wouldn't mind coming back at all! :)\n\nThis was a straight mission.", "author": "Atif K."}

Food is good and the salsa they give with the chips while you wait for the food is bomb I would give them a 4/5 on food. My problem is the service we got on Saturday May 9th 2014. \nWe got a server who didn't even tell us his name.\nHere's what I'll talk about: \n1-Server lectures my friend with major attitude.\n2- a couple inches from my face he's waving his hand on my face to \"get my attention\" \n3-never brings us what we ask him for \n4- kept asking us  if we were sure we were paying the total amount (utterly disrespectful!)\n5- I call manager leave a message and never get a call back! \n I will describe him so if u ever get him you've been warned (unless we were the only unfortunate ones). \nServer was about 5'6 black hair semi-beard with ear gauges and tattoos (barcode tattoo on his left arm). There were about 4 incidents where this guy was beyond rude and mean and quite frankly I felt embarrassed for bringing my friends there since I was raving about how good it is. \nIncident #1: my friend accidently brought an expired ID (which he hadn't even noticed until she opened her mouth and told him) and he said he would talk to the manager which is totally understandable no problem there. He takes the ID with him and brings it back like 10 min. After and tells her for this one time the manager said it's ok, great! My friend follows up saying yes sorry it was a total accident I switched purse and just saw an ID and didn't check (as she's saying that)  he has the card in his hand cuts her off what she was saying and starts lecturing her in such a rude unneccesary  way telling her \"yea but you know what next time bring your real one\" with the face and attitude and she was like it is a real ID it's just expired. He gives her back the card and leaves doesn't even take out order....\n#2 we were in a booth and he takes out order and starts with another friend counter clockwise however my friend number 3 siting next to me cuts me off and proceeds her order, it was loud that night so he didn't hear her and thought I was going to make an order so I smile and point at my friend who is already telling him what she wants, I guess he doesn't understand me and proceeds to wave his nasty had at my face a couple inches away! I'm like excuse me she's ordering and rolls eyes and gets her order. \nMore stuff happens but what really pissed is off was this...\n\nWe paid with 3 different cards one of my friends even made it easy for him and wrote the last 4 numbers of our cards and the amount to put on each card, so he has the never to ask about 4 times are we sure it all adds up to the total and just kept asking and asking. Talk about rude! So to end this review we gave him $0.00 tip well deserved! After spending $75+. I still have he refernece number of the recipt in case a manager reads this and wants to get in contact with my because I called multiple times and would never get transferred to the manager.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-04-30", "description": "So I visited this poor excuse of a restaurant in February. I was in a group of six, we are all younger which I assume was the reason for our horrific service. My cousins and I were sight seeing and thought this would be a good choice to stop at. Upon arrival, a very nice gentlemen sat us down and let us know a waitress would be right over and she came in a reasonable amount of time. She brought us water as we went over the menus.\nWe ordered pretty quickly but our food took nearly 45 minutes to actually come out. While ordering, our waitress kept speaking to us in Spanish even though she spoke perfect English and not a single one of us said a word in Spanish. It got to the point where I had to tell her to speak English because she wasn't catching on. The table next to us was seated, had ordered, and started their meal before we got our food. I wish I was exaggerating. During this whole time, our waitress did not check on us a SINGLE time despite stopping at all her other tables.\nThe food was also very dull... I had a quesadilla which was good, very stingy on condiments that you are overcharged for. I didn't like that all the condiments were on Dixie portion cups, sitting on the plate. It would look more appetizing just scooped onto the plate. This also makes me question how fresh they are if they are prescooped. Just a tacky move. I tried my brother's burrito which was smothered in a disgusting sauce, literally horrendous! My cousin said the carne asada was bad too. Granted we are tougher critics because we are San Diegans.\nHalfway through our meal, she offered me a refill. It never came, upon requesting our check, she TOLD me I needed a refill. I replied that she had promised one earlier, no apology. After looking at the check, which by the way is hand written... Not very reliable, we realized it was a little off. We asked about some extra charges and realized they have some added charges for condiments, which we had no problem paying. We were more upset at how poorly it was stated on the menu and lack of being mentioned when ordering.\nThis is when it really got to us... Our waitress charged us the full amount and comes back with our cards and receipts and tells us we don't have to tip her because of the lack if communication, in the most condescending and rude tone. I happily let her know my opinion, I told her \"we will not be leaving a tip but not because of the next charge, it will be because of the service.\"\nI explained to her that we felt discriminated against and profiled because we are younger than most of the other customers but that my cousin and I (who were treating the group) are more than financially stable to pay for the meals. We felt that because we look young, she was expecting a poor tip and gave us less than adequate service and that we felt racially profiled considering she felt it necessary to consistently speak in Spanish with us. She tried to claim she was very busy and I pointed out that she wasn't too busy for her other tables and if she still thought she was I would personally ask them how many times she checked on each table. I agree that this was extreme but I was beyond heated.\nDO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, mediocre food and disgusting service.

I've been a closet eater at many San Francisco restaurants that haven't motivated me - which in no way is a reflection on the spectacular selection in SF, but a testament to either the strength of their margaritas or the the fantastic flavor of their food to get me to come out of my food-induced-coma silence. Either way, if you follow my recipe for palette pleasing success, you won't be disappointed. Two margaritas, Enchiladas Poblanas, and Ice cream in a sugar shell.

I was curious how the food would compare (as I'm from SoCal -where there is also awesome Mexican food) and this place did not disappoint.  We arrived around early dinner hour and it was already packed.  Granted the place is not super huge, but it was still packed!  We waited at the door to be seated and was eventually \"greeted\" by the host who was very busy, hands full, serving multiple tables.  He wasn't particularly friendly, but not completely cold.  There were two small tables open and we were told we could sit wherever we'd like.  We chose a booth seat next to another couple, towards the front of the restaurant so that we could get close to the natural light.  \n\nShortly after seating ourselves, another server quickly stocked us with a basket of chips and two house salsas.  One was a mild pico de gallo and the other was a hotter red sauce.  Being of sensitive mouth when it comes to all things spicy, I preferred the flavor and heat of the pico de gallo, but both salsas were flavorful.  It was a tad bit of a wait before our waitress had a free moment to address us for drinks (because it was so busy) and in the meantime, they re-stocked our chips for us without us having to ask!  \n\nThe waitress was really nice, once she finally arrived, and I opted to try their peach margarita and bistek.  My hubby got their Pozole Verde and a beer.  The peach margarita was tasty!  I'd never had a peach flavored one before, and I'd definitely try it again.  The bistek was also very tasty and came with grilled onions, rice, beans and a tiny side salad.  Being a SF native, my hubby already knew this place and had had their Pozole Verde many times before.  I had never seen or tasted a Pozole Verde but I am a fan!  Their version had pork, chicken and bacon in it.  I probably could have done without the bacon addition, but the pork chunks were super tender as were the beans.

This is a step above Chi-Chi's. \n\nMargaritas are great on a warm day, but how could you screw that up?\n\nWhere Puerto Alegre really misses the mark is with the incessant mariachi band that waltzes in and wails out songs, violently playing their guitars, creating such a cacophony of noise that all hope of hearing your dining companions is lost.

My gf and I were looking for a good place to grab some margaritas and chips after work this week and turned to a trusty source to find it (theeeeeeeeeeeee........ yelp).  Anyway, we hopped on bart and headed to the mission post-work for a very easy ride to get to this place. We walked in and it wasn't too crowded. They even had the US v Guatemala game on (soccer!). We grabbed a marg pitcher and started destroying the basket of chips. That was when things went downhill...\n\nWe were waiting for two other buddies of ours and admittedly were sitting in one both for a little while, but excuse me if I didn't notice a fucking timer over our head on when we needed to leave... we were asked nearly ten to twelve times if we needed anything with a subtle (get the fuck out) tone to it more so each time. And sadly, that was not even the worst part. I'm quite used to restaurants trying to shuffle people in and out quickly. More customers = more business, I get it. But when our friends finally showed up and we ordered food? Oh god...\n\nThis had to be some of the worst food I've tasted from a Mexican restaurant.... it literally tasted like I was eating chalk. Maybe I just happened to get the chef's worst meal of the day? Maybe it was what I ordered? (cheese enchiladas). Either way I made it through a quarter of it before I tapped out. No thank you sir..\n\nThe ONLY redeeming quality was the guacamole we ordered. Very fresh, very delicious. I loved the guac. Saved the experience from being a 1/5 experience.\n\nAnd one more thing, not sure why everyone talks up the margs here so much... I found them to be quite dull. I don't know how much marg experience everyone has here but it certainly wasn't my first margarita rodeo (omg do those exist?). These were bland, not very alcoholic, and didn't even use fresh ingredients...

I'd like to begin by saying that I am Mexican and have eaten Mexican food all my life; therefore, I know a little...just a little...about this category of food.\n\nWhat's good: \nMargaritas! The mole poblano chicken is delicious; I highly recommend it. The enchiladas poblanas are yummy. I also like the carne asada plate (it comes with a big ass grilled jalapeno pepper that will surely burn you if you take a huge bite), milanesa plate, enchiladas; fajitas. The green pozole is absolutely the best pozole in San Francisco. Damm, I think I like everything here. I almost forgot, the brunch menu is equally satisfying. \n\nWhat's not good: \nThe wait for a table. On a busy night it can take up to 1 hour for a group of four or larger. G'luck. I always eat with my significant other, so seating is more prompt. Also, it can get rather loud. Very loud; especially when the Mariachi or Guitar Playing Man come in. Some people mid the musicians, and some people don't. I guess it depends on how many margaritas you've had! I admit, it is kinda annoying when they come around with a donation bag after they're done singing, but hey, people gotta eat right...here's a dollar.\n\nOverall: \nFor the prices, it is a must place for Mexican food and Margaritas! Especially when you compare it to other \"Mexican\" restaurants like Tacolicious in the Marina, Mamacita's in the Marina, or Tropisueno in the Financial District. \n\nAlmost forgot: \nThe waiters are nice and they'll go grab you at the bar next door (Blondie's) when your table is ready.

Went on a Saturday night at around 7 and there was a 40 min wait (duh! its 7 on a Saturday and 6 people) so no big deal.  We had a drink next door while waiting.  \n\nAnyway, they serve you chips and two kinds of salsa.  I was really impressed with the salsa because a) two kinds b) both had really great flavors and c) one was spicy.. no really, i mean it!  and that spicy of a table salsa NEVER happens. \n\nWe got two pitchers of margs.  A strawberry and a regular on the rocks.  They were both decent.  However, I am on a quest to find the best marg ever and their special one sounded pretty good, but since we opted for pitchers I didn't get to sample :(\n\nMy boyriend and I shared the shrimp fajitas.  Since we snacked on so many chips we feared fullness (and limited table space since we both wanted the fajitas ha) and decided sharing would be best.  For table space, this was true.  For fullness, it was not necessary.  They are very heavy handed on the veggies in the fajitas but not so much with the shrimp so I wouldn't recommend splitting that one.  Someone at the table ordered the chicken fajitas and it didn't seem to be quite the case for that dish.  However, the dish was still a good decision.  Those little fajitas de camarones were pretty tasty!  And they serve them with sour cream, guacamole, and beans automatically, which is awesome.  I hate having to ask for sour cream and guacamole and getting charged an extra $5 or something.\n\nThe atmostphere in there was really upbeat.  The place seemed bustling and everyone was happy and enjoying themselves.  Great vibe.  \n\nOh and all that food and drink and fun only cost us $20/person!

For Mexican fare and margaritas your choices consist of Puerto Alegre and Velvet Cantina (way down on 23rd).\n\nDue to the margarita famine, the waits here can be epic (I've waited almost two hours for a table), but thankfully Casanova is right across the street to soothe the soul.  I'd say a wait of 1 hour is worth it... much more than that and I think you should give up your margarita dreams and head elsewhere.\n\nOnce you make it inside, the decor is nothing special, the service is sufficient but not overly friendly, and the food is ranges from a B+ to a A-.  At the end of the day you're not paying much for a dinner with cocktails, so keeping things in perspective this is one of my favorite neighborhood stops.\n\nBonus points for:\n    - Attentive refills to the (complimentary) chips and delicious salsas\n    - the \"Especial\" margaritas (well worth the upgrade from the \"house\") \n    - Psychic sense of wait-times by the host staff - if they tell you 30 minutes it won't be more than 35", "author": "Kevin F."}

I am always lost in the mission and I basically know how to go up and down 16th from Mission to Valencia and venture down Valencia so I may be missing a lot.  I came here last night and it was really really packed. We were told that our wait would be about 30 minutes for 3 people and we put our name on a list and got a random piece of paper thing with the number 5 on it. Apparently, that meant that we were 5th on the list. \n\nThe service here isn't great, I asked for a straw, but never got one. I didn't know burritos here came with enchilada sauce on them (which I don't like), so I asked for an extra plate. Then 10 minutes later, I got my plate that was really small, so I just dumped the sauce on instead of moving my burrito over. While the service wasn't great, the food was pretty good. \n\nWe all got burritos and they were good except that I ordered the vegetarian burrito and instead of guac I asked if I could substitute sour cream. My cousin also got the vegetarian burrito. Hers came with guacamole inside of it and mine came with the tiniest drizzle of sour cream over the top...basically looked like a garnish or decorative feature. So, I asked for an extra side of sour cream...which of course, I never got! Don't get me wrong, the burrito was good and it definitely satisfied my Mexican need, but I will continue to try other places as this is definitely not going to be my spot of choice. \n\nThey do have chips on the table before you even sit down so if you are really really hungry, this is a great place because you can eat as soon as you sit!\n\nOh, and the worst part, which I think that happens in all the restaurants in the mission, is that there was a band there and they roam from restaurant to restaurant and while I enjoy music, they play so loud that you can't talk to the people at your table.  Right before they left, they came around asking for tips and I don't mean like they walk up to the table with their brown paper lunch bag and walk away.  They came up to us and said \"tips?\" and we said \"no, sorry.\"  and the guy continued to stand there until we said no again.  I really would like to support them because I know they only get paid in tips, but at the same time, I am way too far in debt to be paying random people who played 2 really loud songs that wasn't really that enjoyable!", "author": "M M."}

My first experience at Puerto Alegra was with their chili verde which had nice chunks of pork and a lot of flavor. I was definitely a member of the clean plate club! Today wasn't so great....\n\nPuerto Alegra feels like a real mom and pop type restaurant in every respect: the seating, the pictures on the wall, the simple menu and specials, etc. Right after we were seated, they plopped down some chips & salsa which were definitely the highlight of the meal for me today. The orange color salsa is definitely the winner and has a sort of Papalote orange sauce taste to it, but much thinner in consistency. I went with the grilled chicken burrito grande today. The waiter asked me if I wanted cheese and guac and I said no. When the burrito showed up, it was swimming in a very smelly red sauce which had curled up cheese bits in it everywhere. I guess I should have asked for no cheese, but the waiter had asked me no more than 10 minutes ago and I'd said no, so I consider this their bad. Anyway, I tried a bite and the sauce was an instant turn off. I couldn't even eat any more of it or scrape the sauce off because there was just too much. I would've sent it back, but I was pretty much soured on the whole experience, so I just got it to go.\n\nThe wait staff are very friendly and prompt and kept our chips filled the whole time.I'm giving them 3 stars because that's an average of my first great experience there and this currently not-so-great experience.

I would sell my soul to live back in SF and live right above Puerto Allegre. \n\nTheir food is to die for. I have NEVER had Mexican food this amazing!!! And probably never will. And that's saying a lot considering I grew up in San Diego, 30 minutes from the border. \n\nWhenever I go I make sure to take BART and bring at least 2 other friends to share in the yummy goodness. I order a pitcher of their margartias on the rocks with salt. This is the best part of the meal. I've never had a margarita as good as theirs. In fact, I'm scared to try others because I know they will be horrible in comparasin. \n\nAll of the food on their menu is delicious. I've had most of their combo plates, their deluxe quesidilla, and fajitas. Also, you HAVE TO order their guacamole. It is soooo amazing!!\n\nI can't say enough good stuff about this place. And if there is a wait to get a table, WAIT!! Wait 5 hours if you have to! It's totally worth it. I usually just skip over to Cassanova, the bar across the street and get drinks there while I wait. \n\nI've turned several people onto eating here and hope I can talk more people into becoming as addicted to Puerto Allegre as I am!!", "author": "Natalie T."}

Which is why my friend made reservations in advance for her birthday dinner. When she walked in, she was told that she had to be out of there in exactly 2 hours. That's fine, I get restaurants that have table time limits. But she was told very rudely by the host, and its kind of shitty to have that be the FIRST thing someone says to you when you walk in expecting a happy celebration with margaritas on your birthday. \n\nYes, those famous margaritas. They were delicious, I'll admit. The food was good, albeit a little overpriced. But that's about all the redeeming qualities that this place has.\n\nOur server was inattentive. First, we practically had to wrangle her over to our table to place our order. She kept walking by very quickly without stopping to glance at us or ask if we needed anything. Then, one of the girls in our group came a little late and she completely ignored her new presence - didn't ask her if she wanted to order. She and I ended up splitting the meal I ordered because the waitress didn't ever get around to take her order. \n\nFinally - the kicker: the menu clearly stated that for parties of 6 or more, 18% gratuity would be added. This is normal. We expected that as a party of 8. We ask her to split the bill between a few credit cards. Having worked at many restaurants, I know that this is an easy thing to do. She practically laughed in our face and said that she could only accept 2 cards. Really? Fine. We made it work. We paid and quickly left so as not to go over our time limit. \n\nWe're standing outside the restaurant and she comes out after us. She awkwardly places the bill on one of the trash cans standing in the sidewalk and says \"Umm. You don't tip me. Gratuity isn't included.\" We stare at her. She stares back. One of us says \"The menu says...\" She runs back into the restaurant. We all look at each other. WTF?\n\nWe had just been discussing the fact that if gratuity hadn't been included, we wouldn't have added tip anyway because of the horrible service. Someone points out that \"Gratuity\" is adding additional money for a pleasant experience, which we did not have. We all take out cash and give her a tip because we are better than that.\n\nNever again.", "author": "Hannah L."}

Not always so great customer service.\n\nI've been here a couple times, and both times got the Milanesa Especial (grilled breaded steak topped with sauce and cheese, served with salad and refried beans).  Great stuff.  Simply amazing when you're drunk though.  Especially when you add a fried egg on top of it.  The breading has spices inside of it, and is perfectly crispy, with tender meat inside.  \n\nThe last time I went I also got the tequila sampler.  I couldn't find a price, and the waiter told me it was $16.  I was feeling adventurous, so I went with it.  The selections for the day were all 1800 brand-- a blanco, reposado, and anejo.  They went with the meal perfectly.\n\nThe standard free chips and salsa were also good.  They were both fresh and had a decent amount of heat.\n\nThe first time I went, our waitress was very friendly and helpful, great customer service.  The most recent time, not so much.  The first guy seemed okay, but he I guess ended up leaving before I was done with my meal.  Another guy and girl took over, and when I got my bill, I saw that my tequila sampler was $18.  $2 difference from what I was told, no big deal, but I figured I'd mention it.  The new waitress looked shocked when I did, and she went to ask the other new waiter if he told me it was $16.  He looked upset and said \"I didnt say that!!\" and I told her it was another waiter.  They both looked confused and somehow had no idea who I was talking about, but said that waiter must have gotten off work already, and pointed out on a menu where it said the price was actually $18.  No apology for anything, not even on behalf of their coworker for a misquoted price, just an argument that it wasn't really $16.  I wasn't gonna fight for $2 so I just paid.  Not a big deal, but it kinda sucked getting treated like I was tryin to scam a measly two dollars.\n\nBecause the customer service was so great the first time I went, I would still go back for another round of milanesa especial, and maybe some margaritas which were also pretty good the first time I went.

Sauces were missing traditional flavors of great mexican food and tasted a bit bland, like tomato sauce...Not standard mexican spicey explosion I've come to adore...\n\nClearly the margaritas were good- a bit fake limey, but strong. oh and so was the guacamole- homemade with large chunks of fresh avocado.  I think this would make a great happy hour destination.", "author": "Gabrielle J."}

Yes, you heard me right.  A mysterious burrito came flying at me from behind, sliding down the back of my sweater, and into the seat next to me.  I know, it sounds like a bad episode of 'You Can't Do that on Television' in Barth's Burgers.  So why am I still giving Puerto Alegre five stars?  Because after all is said and done, I still keep coming back!  Besides, it's not their fault that a few 25 going on 5-year olds were sitting behind us.  If you're wondering what management at Puerto Alegre did to help us with the situation, they were more than accommodating, comp'ed us some food on a future visit, and kicked the deviants out.  Luckily, we were more shocked than angry at the whole situation, so we didn't make a huge stink out of it.  All I wanted to do was finish my tasty margarita.\n\nBy the way, this is the ONLY time I have ever seen something like this happen here.  Yes, it's crowded and noisy at times, but the crowd is generally pretty happy and friendly.  As for the food, I almost always order a cheese enchilada with refried black beans.  I can't live without their chips and salsa.  Okay, maybe I can, but I don't want to.", "author": "Melissa M."}

Yes its cheap, yes the atmosphere is fun and lively, but that doesn't help the fact that the Mexican food served here his totally sub-par. \n\nIf you are standing in line right now or yelping around for a place to grab some Mexican food, this is NOT it.

I put my cigs, and crackberry down and ordered a 151 with diet coke.  Okay so everyone rants including myself about how strong the margs are, well NEWSFLASH this drink was the strongest drink I have ever had that I didn't make.  I think they didn't even put coke, maybe they didn't hear I wanted diet coke.  This was the best start to my Sunday adventure ever.  So I ordered the veggie fajitas, and mmmmmm they were the best compliment to my buzz ever.  I ordered a few more 151 drinks and smoked some cigs, played some mariachi on the box, and called my adorable lush friend and let her know to come down.  \n\nSo while I was waiting, it just got better.  My consumption changed to Modelo Especial, and I never had to wait to long for another drink.  So my friend arrived I drank some more, smoked, finished and left with an amazing buzz.

I am broken.\n\nI am a self possessed, intelligent, kind guy that really wants to live and let live.... and allow us to all live together in peace and harmony.  That is... of course... until I went into the Mission for Breakfast at this joint on Sunday.\n\nLet's start about the good stuff.... \n\nOur server, a cute asian woman covered in arm sleeve tattooing.  Frankly, she didn't belong in a dive like that (I say dive endearingly), and has a lot more to offer in a classier joint.  I have worked F&B, and I could see her work the tables... would never bring something without leaving with a plate, or getting the start on the refill.  She was awesome.\n\nIs that it?  Is that all the good stuff?  Well I was with my ladyfriend.  We got a parking spot right out front.  What else could go wrong.\n\nAnd now we get back to the beginning of why this is so hard for me...  the restaurant, the service, the food... all acceptable.  This is a Mexican dive that has margs and Mexican slop.  Fine.  That is lovely.\n\nBut why am I so sad?\n\nThe hipsters finally got to me.  Broke me.  Made me ashamed of our city, and made me want to run over everyone on the  block with a huge 4wd.  \n\nLOOK.. pop culture is hard to deny.  We are all going to end up with a vaguely silly tshirt that has some goofy pun on it.  We are all going to end up liking bands we think are better than others.  We are all going to exhibit a style and a sense, and carry ourselves in a certain \"way\".... \n\nbut the hipster culture of the mission disgusts me.  DISGUSTS.  Frankly, I know it is hard to define hipster.  It is a vague, fluid, ill defined concept... until you look at them.\n\nI seriously don't want to get into an ontological argument about this, so I will keep it simple:\n\n\nThe food was not that great, but the entire experience took a noise dive having to deal with the idiot hipsters out the front window... waiting or walking by.  I don't know what it was, but this meal will forever represent\n\n1)  Why that part of the city is altering into something vapid, shallow, and completely alterior to the vibe in SF.\n\n2)  Why I finally understand all the Burning Man haters thinking these pseudo frat boy jocks 8 years after college are part of it.  They aren't.  They just needed to hide from themselves by altering their image.\n\n3)  Why I finally dig and respect the yuppie elite in the marina, who are trying to be or do nothing other than be or do who they are... whether it means a pretentious idiot or a misogynistic elitist.  At least they know who they are, and aren't acting like Mission Hipsters that are doing everything in their ability to be someone they think is cool, rather than who they are.  I am done with that.\n\n\n\n\nIt makes me sad to see the vibrant and colourful culture of this city be co-opted by spoiled psuedo rich kids spending money to look poor, and buy into the repackaged pop culture that allows these pretentious people to think they are something special. \n\nThey aren't special... they are the enemy. \n\nAnd they finally got to me... with their skinny pants and buttons and single tracks and all that crap....  \n\nAt least I know not to hit the Mission again until a fireball cleans it out.  Oh... and if you think I am being harsh, look at my other reviews.\n\nI think maybe 4 out of 5 are 5 stars, and one or two are one stars.\n\nSo take this with a grain of salt, but the food wasn't good, and the experience was just awful.\n\nDid get a good spot right out front tho.", "author": "Uncle Fishbits Aeneas X."}

Here is my last experience there: I drop my GF off while I look for parking; we're going to a birthday party and we're running a little late. This takes me about ten minutes -- I walk in and sit down and look at my girlfriend, who stares at me like a stunned animal -- I swear her pupils are different sizes. Cautiously I ask, \"what's your deal?\"\r\n\r\nShe replies, \"I'm drunk, you need to catch up,\" to which I blurt, \"TEN MINUTES?\"\r\n \r\nShe pushes a rocks glass full of margarita at me, says, \"fuck you, you'll see.\"\r\n\r\nSix inches from my mouth the smell of Tequila coming off the glass is so potent that I cough. I take a sip: imagine mixing a Margarita like you'd mix a dry martini -- just a couple of drops of triple sec instead of vermouth.  This is what I  drink down. This is the Trojan Horse of Margaritas. Troy will burn -- it's only a matter of time.\r\n\r\nAll sixteen people at the table are housed within thirty minutes. They could have served us dish towels with salsa on them and we would have hooted in delight. Or just hooted.\r\n\r\nBefore the night was out I nearly broke my ass-bone trying to imitate a velociraptor (with sound effects) and my girlfriend, who went home after dinner (but left her keys with me), turned into Wonder Woman and mounted three stories of scaffolding on the outside of our apartment building to climb onto our deck.

We got a margarita each. For people who don't drink often, one is enough, trust me.

After you endure the best of what the Mission has to offer in people bashing your wait will finally be up.\n\nWhen I eat at Puerto Alegre I overindulge in chips, salsa, margharitas, and my grilled chicken burrito.

EXCELLENT margaritas... strong as fuck, and you gotta appreciate the seasonal flavors... because let's face it, sour mix gets boring (and gross) after awhile, and cutting down on it also helps minimize the heart burn that is going to incur with the consumption of so much tequila.\nI really like the tamales and the wet burritos here...\nSpeaking of wet burritos... \"Burrito sauce\"? \nMy last experience there our server was a bitch. Sorry, but it's true. I'm a server and I can say that she was being a bitch to us for no reason. Well maybe there was a reason, but it couldn't have possibly involved us because we had just sat down. We ordered burritos and asked if we could have that topped with enchilada sauce. A seemingly reasonable request, and we didn't mind paying extra... however much extra that may be. \nShe then said, \"Um. I don't think we can do that. But I can put burrito sauce on it maybe.\"\nUhm. What? So I ask her what burrito sauce is... she replies with, \"BURRITO sauce!\" Like I'm a fucking idiot. Well sorry but I've eaten at a lot of Mexican food establishments and have never fucking heard of burrito sauce. So we just agree because apparently the subject and the whole confusion of enchilada vs. burrito sauce is starting to upset and or confuse the server.\nWe get our burritos and the burrito sauce appears to be enchilada sauce with ground beef in it. OK. It wasn't bad by any means but I would have still preferred enchilada sauce...sans meat.\nAside from that little situation I've always received good service here. Definitely can have a little bit of a wait though, but you can always go to a neighboring bar and toss one back while you wait.", "author": "Liane V."}

I had the worst restaurant experience last night.  I'm a long time customer, and have had many a good times at this place.  However, last night everything went wrong.\n\nFirst, the door guy was clueless, and he should really stop taking X before going to work.  I was bringing over 8 people around 5:30 PM when the place was half empty.  He couldn't accommodate us and kept saying that the tables were reserved which was a total lie since by 7 PM they were still not fully occupied.\n\nSecond, waiter Wendy had an attitude, and ripped us off by passing off Cuervo as a top shelf tequila.  The less than adequate tip reflected our attitude about her.\n\nAs solace, we still had to order the pitcher of gritas which is really the only thing that this place is good for.  The food is just average.  We then proceeded to go across the street to Ramblas which can accommodate us at 7 PM for some excellent food.

In fact, there is nothing worth waiting for here, and thankfully I never hung around for the waits of 40 min to an hour and a half  that I was quoted the first FOUR times I tried to drop in.  By the way, the host was also a rude asshole each and every one of those times.  \n\nSo I refer to my first \"successful\" visit as a way of saying that it was the first time I was seated and treated, relatively speaking, like a human being by the host.  Suffice it to say expectations were high.  Chips and salsa - well, they were there.  Nothing special at all, despite what some reviewers would tell you.  Well, adelante... the main menu, and... ok, nothing special here either.  Oh, except the prices.  I had a bland plate of enchiladas surrounded by runny, bland refried beans and flavorless rice.  \n\nSo then there were the margaritas.... {sigh}.  I have to admit that most of the aforementioned word-of-mouth I had received about Puerto Alegre made a big deal of the margaritas.  Well, I don't like to completely write a place off based on one night's poor drinks (could have been an aberration...), so that's why the two stars are up there and not just one.  But it seemed that these very expensive margaritas were missing the fundamental ingredient of lime juice.  Or maybe they use a cheap mix at this place; I wouldn't doubt it.  Seems that the point is to get people drunk enough that they think that the bill corresponds with the quality of their meal.  I did not end up that drunk by a long shot.  I guess the margaritas were strong...\n\nAll you Puerto Alegre fans, you can keep it.  All yours.", "author": "Josh C."}

I ordered a chicken burrito (which, much to the disbelief of my friends, I finished and then proudly licked any remnants off my plate to solidify my membership in the Clean Plate Club), one of my friends had a quesadilla, and the other had a chicken chimichanga.  My burrito was okay, nothing special, but clearly not terrible or there's no way I would have inhaled it.  My friends liked their food, too, but didn't seem to be overwhelmed.

The waiting patrons spill out onto Valencia Street, waiting for a table. Calling ahead for big groups is definitely recommended. \n\nI was expecting great good and great drinks, but was very disappointed by our waitress. It unfortunately took forever to get our order and she had the nerve to question the number of pitchers we ordered. (A group of 8 ordered three. She recommended two, but we quickly corrected her and proved ourselved worthy by downing every single drop.) When she took our orders, she completely skipped a member of our party. When we informed her of her mistake, she took another five minutes to get back and place his order. \n\nIt continues. A glass of margarita was spilled. She took our leftover food to pack-up and it didn't re-appear for a good fifteen minutes. She also over-charged us by over $80! \n\nI know that we all have bad nights, and I am hoping that our waitress was simply having one herself. The food itself was delicious. A \"monster burrito\" is appropriately titled: it is ginornous and smothered in a mess of sauce (red or green!) I couldn't finish it. And if it weren't for my highly suspicious mind about the whereabouts of my food as she placed it in a takeaway bag, I would have finished it later. \n\nPerhaps Puerto Allegre is one of those restaurants where you can't have both great food and great service.

I mean, it's okay, but it's not GREAT. \n\nBut I keep going there again and again because it's actually one of only a few places at the north end of the Mission where you can get a cheap Mexican meal with table service. Really -- it's true. \n\nUnless you're happy with a taqueria, it's hard to sit down and ORDER Mexican food in that part of the Mission.\n\nAnd, when you have your little sister in town from Detroit, and she's having her \"Mission Day,\" and she's all touristified, and she's just been to Mission Dolores and shopping on 16th and she's loving the sunshine and the palm trees because they don't have shit like that in the D, in fact the sun NEVER shines there because it's inside the first circle of hell and there are no trees except for the trees that grow out of the tops of the abandoned skyscrapers and in the vacant lots where there USED to be houses until they all burned down in the race riots and now they're overrun by crack whores and wild pheasants and YES those two species are frequently seen together in the wilds of Detroit nesting in metal stripped from the window frames of all the abandoned auto factories left to rot when the f'ing Big Three abandoned the city and gave the proverbial middle finger to the working class and, and...\n\nWhere am I? Oh yeah -- JUST KIDDING! I love Detroit! I just tattooed the \"D\" on my shoulder! Go Tigers!\n\nSo if all that, then this is a good place to go for Mexican in the Mission and complete your Mission experience. Not TOO crowded, decent enough eats, hoppin' vibe, looks like a diner but they have margaritas, too (yay!), and the little Mexican guitarist man is ALWAYS in here. \n\nThat just made my little sister's day (who, by the way, now also wants to move to San Francisco). We don't have street musicians in Detroit, either. In Detroit, someone would cap the little Mexican guitarist man and use his guitar to start a fire in an oil barrel and keep warm...", "author": "Lisa T."}

I then ordered a shrimp dish (the name of which I can't remember) since I get tired of the more typical Mexican dishes. It was actually very good (shrimp sauteed with onions and peppers in a spicy sauce, that came with rice and beans), and I would order it again.

I'm a lot nicer than the witch in Hansel and Gretel though....I treat my pray with R E S P E C T.

The seedy and wonderful taqueria with the hyper-crazy-killer margaritas has been replaced with a ghetto-tastic version of Chevy's (credit to Veronica Y. for \"ghetto-tastic\"). But at Chevy's the chips are better. \n\nWe were there most recently with a large-ish group for a birthday party. Our single waitress deftly handled us and kept the margaritas rolling in. She was great. The guac was nice and chunky and good. The salsa was bland, as if they've had too many gringos bitching about the spiciness so now they're serving glorified ketchup instead of salsa. The BF and I shared a whopper super burrito, a chicken tamale and a cheese enchilada. The tamale and the enchilada were barely warm, the burrito consisted of  90% dry, tasteless rice, with a splash of meat and a soupy dollop of sour cream. The beans that came on the side of the combination plate were watery and bland, and, hooray! yet more dry, tasteless rice!\n\nThe margaritas, once limey, tequila-y goodness were overly sweet and chalky with sweet and sour mix that contributed, I'm sure, to the crazy indigestion that ensued later in the evening (that was also not helped by the meal itself.)\n\nEvery time I go to Puerto Alegre, I stay up half the night, my stomach burning and gurgling, wondering if I'm going to have to make a dash for the bathroom, and every time I vow never to return. But somehow I do. \n\nAnd somehow, it's always a good time... It's truly a mystery to me... I guess the trick is to make sure you choose your company for the outting wisely.", "author": "Sage R."}

But goddamn, I really do miss going here.  Why don't I know anyone who wants to go here?  What is WRONG with me?  Sorry bout that little tantrum.

It was one of the first restaurants I was brought to while visiting SF before actually making the leap and moving to the city by the bay. It left an impression upon me. The dark interior offers a welcoming atmosphere after walking about the Mission district on a bright Saturday afternoon. The food satisfied my hungry stomach and fiery soul; the enchiladas are consistent and dependably good. Seating is plentiful and efficient, making Puerto Alegre a great pick for small groups and dates.", "author": "Evelyn B."}

So we snagged another waitress to check on our food for us, as our server was always either out of sight, or wiping down menus. A few moments later we were approached by the lovely manager who politely informed us that the server inadvertently placed our order slip in his pocket instead of turning it into the kitchen! WTF!!! I mean... at what point do you realize that your table has yet to receive their order? haha So anyhow, the manager was really nice and told us he would take care of our soda's and guac for us (bonus!), yet when we got the bill we had an even better surprise! He slashed our bill in half! Yay! (I thought this was an appropriate gesture to make up for the servers inability to service!\n\nOk... now onto the good stuff... the food. Very yummy. The chips are perfect, and the two types of salsa are equally as good... one just the right level of spiciness, and the other perfectly mild and a little chunky. The guac here is fantastic... always worth getting. The margs are awesome... be sure to get a pitcher... you'll thank me later. And the rest of the food on the menu is great... you can't go wrong! The quesadilla's are my favorite... and the crispy taco's are a close second. The one thing that is bad is the salad. I mean... you can't just put shredded lettuce on a plate and call it a salad!", "author": "Matt O."}

The last time was on a Saturday where we did have an hour wait, so we sat in casanova across the street and had a drink while we waited, which only took about 35-40 minutes. The food here is great, and I haven't had them, but some in our group got the refried black beans (only by request) and they're evidently kickass. I'm a sucker for the regular refried beans and got those, and they were great. Ps, I am a rice connoisseur and let me tell you their rice is AWESOME. No carrot chunks here folks, just baby-kissed rice. I also have to mention the margaritas, which are amazing. We got a pitcher for our table. I would have gotten a pitcher for myself had I not spent the entire day perfecting my form in delores park. Hands down a great place to eat and drink. Check it out.", "author": "Stephanie D."}

Place.\n\nYeah, it's impossible to get in quickly unless you go at 2 in the afternoon (and even then it can be crowded), but this is easily remedied by stumbling over to Casanova to temper the inevitable wait with some drinkies. \n\nThe pozole verde here is a beautiful creation, loaded with hominy, pork, chicken and perfect spice. Pair that with the tortillas and the mountain of salad that accompanies it and you've got the makings of a \"loosen the belt, I'm going to burst\" experience. Spent a couple of cold rainy days here with the pozole and it warmed my soul (then again, that may have been the tequila). The shrimp/avocado quesadilla suiza is another favorite: cheesy, camarone-rific yumminess. The margaritas never disappoint here, and they're the perfect complement to the food. Pitchers tend to go down a bit too easily, but they're clearly worth the nagging hangover. The wait staff are super-friendly here, despite the non-stop crowds pouring in and out.

In fact, not having been to the Mission yet in the 2 months I've lived here, I've missed it.  There is no food I love more then crispy shredded beef tacos.  And not the ones with the pre-made shell with the meat thrown in, but the ones that fry the taco with the meat inside.  Mmmm.  \nSo I met up with a friend of mine who lives in the Mission and of course we had to get Mexican food.  The place was packed, and we had to wait a good 1/2 hour to get in, but once we were in we were golden.  The chips were so tasty, they stood up on their own in the flavor department even without salsa.  Only complaint here is that they brought a tiny bowl.  The waiter gave me a dirty look when I asked for another bowl right away, but come on!  No one can eat just one! \nThe margaritas were good and I was actually feeling a nice little buzz from one.\nAnd then-the piece de resistance-the shredded beef crispy tacos.  Fried in shell.  The meat was very flavorful and juicy(or is that greasy from being fried? Hey, whatever it takes...)  I was in heaven, and oddly comforted by such a trivial thing.  The portions were just perfect too; it brought me just to the brink of being fully satisfied without the feeling I usually get when I leave a Mexican restaurant of wanting to induce vomiting or take a really big s**t.  \nOnly complaints I would have is in the service department.  Definitely not service with a smile.  And there was a strolling guitar player screaming-err, singing- at the top of his lungs.  I HATE being bothered when I'm trying to enjoy my tacos.  And he actually went around the restaurant when he was done with a tip jar!  Note to management: you're customers don't want to be panhandled while enjoying their meals.  They get plenty of that when they leave and walk down the street.", "author": "Gracie M."}

The chips and salsa are just plain addictive. I try not to fill up on them, but can't help myself.\n\nDrink --- In general I avoid ordering margaritas out. Getting a really good one is next to impossible and most are way too sweet. The margaritas here are consistently good, not great. In fact, they keep us coming back. \n\nSetting --- Ok, this part looks like a TexMex dive. We don't go for the decor.\n\nService --- It's about family. Once they know you, they take care of you. Strangers, not so much.\n\nConclusion --- If there was a good TexMex place right next store, I'd go. But, there isn't, so this other style of Mexican food is the old fall back.

Luckily you'll be near a bunch of mission bars like Blondies where you can stop in and have a drink before you get into your delicious margaritas at Puerto Alegre.

They were delicious but I think I preferred my friends order of camarones rancheros which were more flavorful and not so spicy.  I also ordered a shredded beef taco bc I just had to try it and while nothing will probably ever live up to the shredded beef tacos at Garcia JoJo's in Modesto, CA... these were pretty damn good!  Everything that everyone else ordered was delicious and I liked the salsa and guacamole at this place a lot.  I want to go back and try their mole - a friend ordered it and loved it and it looked really delicious.  The one thing I did not enjoy was the mariachi band who stood literally right next to our table and played and it was impossible to have a conversation while they were playing.  On top of that, they come right up to your table and are not shy about requesting tips.  Now I'm happy to give tips... however, I did not request for them to play and I didn't like them interrupting our meal or the assumption I should have to tip them.

With good friends and enough pitchers of their margaritas, you'll very quickly forget that the meal isn't mucho gusto; plus, Puerto Alegre isn't so much a destination as it is a first (or second) stop on a Valencia Street journey--it serves the purpose of being a good jumping-off point.", "author": "Hannah J."}

It was a weeknight, and no one in our party had made a reservation prior to arriving.  We were given a table to accommodate us right away, but were told that we had to be done in two hours.  The food was very tasty and reasonably priced (inexpensive), the strolling mariachi band was a lot of fun, and the pitchers of margaritas were delicious.  My only complaint is that the margarita prices weren't listed on the menu, and although we COULD'VE asked the cost, we didn't, and were pretty surprised when we got the bill.  The staff made sure to \"remind\" us when our two hours were up, which was a bit of a drag, but they didn't push us out the door.  We were finished anyway, so no big deal, and people were waiting for the table.  I would definitely go back, but lesson learned:  don't order things without knowing the price.", "author": "Susan S."}

I don't know how long this has been a-happenin' but I have returned to the arms of PA having ranged a bit far from this bastion over the past few months in search of a natural honest non-rose's lime, non sweet n sour mix of my favorite cocktail. I don't mind if the food isn't top shelf....but in a way it is, because house favs like the quesadilla platter with a side of great guac followed a few drinks later by grilled chicken suizas perfectly suit me....i want to stress that the pitchers at PA are still, as far as I know, too difficult to make with fresh squeezed lime.....yes, i know odwalla etc might make big old half gallons of fresh lime juice, but the $$arm and a leg$$$ for that kind of juice is daunting to an individual in this economy, let alone a business, i would imagine. Everyone at Puerto is your friend, if you visit enough. My dear gf met her fiance there, hooked up by yours truly via a happy margarita-fueled invite to join our table that I passed along to him as he sat at the bar last winter....they are gonna get hitched in hawaii this xmas! warm fuzzies to the family:  Lorenzo, Patty and ALL the gang at PA!", "author": "mimsy b."}

I don't know why, but I get dragged here by my gringo friends who think it's amazing.  Let me tell you....the Mission is full of great taquerias, but there are no sit down Mexican restaurants.  So, this is what you get.  The food is so weak, bland and it's what Mexicans think white people will want to eat.  It's not for real Mexican foodies.  They do not make any accomodations....even if they are not busy.  You eat what they have and they make no acceptions for allergies.  I have no idea why it's still in business.  I guess when there's nowhere else to go, you learn to lower your standards.  I wouldn't even give this place 1 star.", "author": "R G."}

Notice that the people who are giving Puerto Alegre less than four stars aren't talking about the Quesadilla Suizas with Avocado!  All of the meat options for the Quesadilla Suizas are great, but I strongly encourage you to get the shrimp.  The margarita pitchers are perfect and the complementary chips & salsa are second to none.  I could drink the house salsa.  My friends and I always pour the house salsa over the top of the Quesadilla Suiza, which is a great touch.  Yes, the wait is long, but the wait goes by quickly if you go grab a drink at Casanova across the street.", "author": "Luke P."}

We haven't seen each other for awhile so we wanted to catch up.I have always wanted to try this place because I have heard so many great things about it and there is always a huge line no matter what day it is. So as soon as we got there, I thought we scored because there was no one in line but little did we know there were about several people ahead of us- they just were next door grabbing a drink. So we waited about 20 minutes before we were seated. We were starving so we ordered a bowl of guac and polished that one off right away along with the salsa. I ordered the 2 items combo plate. I had the cheese gordita and cheese enchilada. Both were fairly good although I like the gordita much more than the enchilada. The rice was yummy but the beans were so so. It was pretty loud so we could not hear ourselves talking but the margaritas made up for it. I first had the regular flavor on the rocks then I had the strawberry frozen one. The strawberry iwas fantastic. It tastes like  it was made with fresh strawberries. I would come back again!", "author": "Zannie S."}

Great Cadillac margaritas and the crunchy beef tacos were sooo good. Last time I went they were totally different and the beef tasted like it was made with Lawry's taco seasoning. The shells used to be deep fried and delish but now I swear they used shells out of a box. Also, they didn't put any cheese on the beans and the margarita was really sweet. Tasted like a bad mix. I was really bummed. I thought it might have been an off day and I would give them another chance but I can't get my fiance to go back.", "author": "Shannon R."}

My big beef is with the service. The last two times I've been there, they've miscalculated the bill by QUITE a bit (in their favor, of course). This time, in addition to padding the bill, they didn't bring drinks we ordered either. There were absolutely NO apologies for the mistakes or the extremely long wait. They have long lines of people waiting to get in so they just don't care anymore. I won't ever be going back; I've had it.", "author": "Melissa M."}

Yes, the wait is atrocious, and at times hard to take.  Fortunately, though, if you head down to Puerto Alegre,  and you've really been craving great Mexican food, you're also in close proximity to several watering holes where you can enjoy a drink before you have dinner (avoid Blondies if you don't like douche bags, I prefer Dalva or Casanova--but that's a whole different review).  Now on to food.  I'm always torn between the Avocado & Shrimp Quesadilla and the Albondigas de Pollo.  Puerto Alegre definitely wins when it comes to the large selection of delicious Mexican soup.  Having lived in Colonial Mexico for a few months, I happen to know that Mexican soups (plural) are a main staple of Mexican cuisine, something you cannot find in your local taqueria.  The Caldo de Camarones (albeit spicy) is also another favorite.  Down to the salsa...Wow.  I wish they would bottle and sell their spicy salsa. The best combination of tang and spice.  Lastly, I was lucky enough to spend my 25th birthday at Puerto Alegre. Having called ahead a few days, we were able to reserve a table for 10.  Something many do not know you can do.", "author": "Whitney C."}

I work in a restaurant and I never complain- I understand some days are better than others in a restaurant.  I used to go to PA when I lived in the Mission and I always had a great meal and I great time there. Today I went there because Sunflower was closed because of the New Year.  The bartender was super mean ( I said please and thank you- I didn't order some lame ass drink ) She gave me the meanest look when she dropped of my margarita - like she had poop smeared on her upper lip- WHOA!!!- the food sucked!!! Swansons frozen dinners tasted better- I am sad that this institution has gone down hill- way way way down.

Have always passed by and have always wanted to try this restaurant as it seems like the spot to be! Bad decision. Got in line for a table for a friend and I, after being seated at a two person table we got a call from four other friends and realized we needed a bigger table. Asked the waitress to be moved. She said it was not possible as we would have to wait until the line outside let up, this was fine as they weren't coming for another half an hour. Half and hour rolls by, our friends are parking, and we ask again to be moved since we have been waiting for a table all this time. (Longer than we had waited outside ourselves) She says she must speak to the host to see what is available, the host himself comes to say we have to put our names down...again? to wait in line for a table...even though we have already waited half an hour? I don't know if it was miscommunication between the two, but this did not seem right, but to no avail we had to wait again. Our friends arrived and we decided it was not worth the wait, which would probably be another 30. We are clearly done with our dinner at this point and keep trying to catch the waitress's eye for a mind boggling 20 minutes. Why she does not look our direction or think to check on us is over my head. Finally catch her attention and ask for the bill and a couple boxes, boxes come ten minutes later without the bill, and bill comes fifteen minutes later to be picked up another twenty minutes after. Really? Never going back. To top it off the food was not that great either! Done and done, unless you have oodles of patience and time for mediocre food, do not come here. There are plenty of taquerias in the mission that would suffice.", "author": "Elysha K."}
