We went to celebrate my husbands birthday and enjoyed a special of fresh tomato soup, Cesar salad and caprese salad to start. My entree was the spicy pork sausage fettuccine which was amazing. I felt like I was in South Philly which is a compliment coming from me. My husband had the rack of lamb with farro and it was done perfect-the temperature - medium rare. It's obvious their produce and meats are high quality. Oh don't let me forget the focaccia served first. \nChristian was our server and surprised my husband with a birthday Tiramisu.

They served us a basket of bread while waiting for our food and it was very mediocre bread. I would expect a denser, less white dough type bread at a fancy Italian restaurant and I would expect it to be warm. The waitstaff was very professional but the seating host was sloppy and unprofessional. He didn't match the $$$ price.

Chatter amongst other guests lingers in the air but never intrudes. Tightly nestled tables with white parchment on top takes down the pretentious nature of most restaurants of this caliber.\n\nThe service would be my only \"compliant\".

The menu is not huge so curated to what they make best I'm assuming...We listened to our fellow Yelpers and ordered the eggplant app. Too die for, melt in your mouth, tastes like old Italy deliciousness. For dinner I got spaghetti carbonara, so rich and my only complaint is that it was so delicious I ate too much of it and was left feeling full! The hubs ordered duck bolognese and it was also very rich. Only complaint is that it was a bit salty for my taste. We started with a cocktail and then a recommended glass of vino with dinner and we were pleased with our choices. The place is fairly small so make a reservation.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-04-18", "description": "I really wanted to like this place because of the location and great ratings I read online, but with all the amazing Italian restaurants in San Francisco, this one merely earns  3.5 stars at best.\n\nThe ambiance itself is nice and cozy - there's a bar upstairs and the downstairs walks into the dining room. However, I don't know if it's the layout or how the tables are set up but I kept feeling claustrophobic. The wait staff told me to move my purse to the other side of the chair to free up space for them. Still, I had several people bump into me when they had to go to the restroom or servers dropping utensils a number of times nearby. Overall, this didn't sit well with me when I was trying to enjoy the beautiful wine we started with.\n\nWe brought two wine bottles with us and unfortunately the first one had a delicate cork that broke- they did end up bringing a strainer to get rid of it which helped us out a lot and we still enjoyed it! Our second bottle was sadly corked. In lieu of the second bottle, we purchased a bottle from their wine list. \n\nIn regards to the food - it was overall pretty underwhelming. We ordered the Carpaccio ($16), Seafood Risotto ($29), and Cioppino ($29). The Carpaccio was fresh but very bland. I wasn't offered fresh black pepper and there was no olive oil nor much of any AIoli spread on it. Call me picky, but shouldn't Carpaccio be complete when served?\n\nThe seafood risotto was probably the best- which was chosen by my bf. It was great but I still prefer Milano's in Russian Hill (more shrimp/prawns) but the consistency of the risottos  were both good.\n\nThe Cioppino's broth was actually solid - however, the seafood was not. The prawns (only 2 pieces) and clams were tasty, but the mussels tasted super fishy and old.\n\nOverall, everything here was just extremely mediocre- except for the wonderful company, wine, and Risotto. From beginning, the service was already lackluster and the food just didn't blow me away. I will likely skip recommending Venticello to my friends in the future with all the wonderful Italian restaurants in San Francisco.", "author": "Veronica S."}

You'll be tempted to order the pizza or go for a healthy salad, but wise locals know to go straight for the pasta (the al dente fettuccine with spicy fennel pork sausage is scrumptious!) or one of the tantalizing entrees like the veal scallopini. Pounded thin, served with braised wild mushrooms and kale over creamy polenta, it's a classic Northern Italian dish done right. Finish off on a (sugar) high note with the intensely dark chocolate budino. Buon gusto!\n\nIf you're celebrating as we were, a bottle of Drussian extra dry prosecco comes in at $44 which hardly breaks the bank, but draws happy giggles from two ladies on a night out.\n\nNow I know Venticello in Italian simply means: Nob Hill's best kept secret.", "author": "Janice C."}

The bread is so delicious and really soft and chewy. Coworkers all ordered caesar salads and I ordered the kale salad. Kale salad was really tasty with apple and nuts. Nice size portion and tangy delicious dressing. For my meal, I had the pappardelle with lamb and cherry peppers. All their pasta is homemade so I really think it's the way to go!

You guys know what is a risky game to be playing in the city.  So, in a rush, I go to OT and see a place right up the street from Miss's house, that I have bookmarked on Yelp has a 8pn slot, so what do I do?  I close the computer before completing the reservation (forehead slap, facepalm combo!!!).\n\nSo I stroll up with MISS on my arm and learn that this bustling place doesn't have us down and panic inside while looking at the delicious food all around us and feeling the glare of a getting hangry MISS.  But to my delight, the Manager said, \"no worries, I understand and we will be able to seat you in just a sec, how about a couple Proseccos while you wait, compliments of the house?\"  Ummm, YEAH!  So as we waited outside and took in the lovely views of the lit up Bay Bridge, we sipped our pretty tasty Champagne and life was, once again grand.\n\nOnce seated, Casey, our Server, was quick to get us started by opening the wine we'd brought and telling us about the specials, but we'd already made up our minds and went with the Steak Tartare to start, which was classic Italian style with Arugula and Capers and quite good to start.\n\nNext, we had an order to share of the Pappardelle, house-made Pasta that they split for us, without us having to ask, though I always want more pasta than HER (bring me all the noodles!!!).  It was delicious and I licked the bowl clean (not really).\n\nMiss had the Hangar Steak which she said was great and I had the Lamb Shank with Polenta which was BOMB!  I ate so much that I was barely able to make a decent stab at the Tiramisu we ordered for dessert.\n\nIn a town chalk full of good Italian food, Venticello is great.

The interior is adorable and romantic, and my waiter was wonderful. Found Venticello via Yelp and made a reservation for my bf's birthday on a Saturday. We arrived around 6:30pm and the restaurant was half full. By the time we left around 8:00pm, the restaurant was packed. Venticello definitely looks a lot nicer in the evening!\n\nWe ordered the pappardelle with wild boar and lamb shank as our entrees. Both were lovely! The pappardelle pasta tasted extremely fresh and savoury, just the right portions too. The lamb shank was great as well, but the meat was just a little too tough for my taste. I've definitely had much tender lamb shank elsewhere, so I might recommend trying a different meat entree. The lamb shank came with polenta (yum) and brussel sprouts. After our meal, our waiter surprised my boyfriend with tiramisu (totally recommend ordering this as a dessert) and a candle on top for his birthday which I thought was a really nice gesture! \n\nI love the authentic feel of Venticello and how the waiters are really detail-oriented to make sure that you're enjoying every aspect of your meal.", "author": "Claudia C."}

The wild boar tasted like a tender, stewed beef. I was concerned it might be gamey, but it wasn't at all. \n\n-Sea bass: Moist, flaky fish wrapped in crispy pancetta. The polenta was prepared differently than I've seen before. It was like a barley. I ordered the tapenade on the side because I don't like olives, but my tablemate tried it and enjoyed it. I thought the flavors were great without it. \n\n-House bread: this was like a focaccia, very light, subtly salty on top.\n\nAmbiance: this restaurant is very tiny. It is also WARM. It was completely full on a Sunday night. I'd definitely make reservations if you're set on eating here. We were lucky and went here on a whim and got the last available table. If you sit on the lower level within view of the window, you can see the Bay Bridge--so pretty! \n\nService: No complaints here. The waiter was very friendly and prompt.

Unfortunately, there is a lot of server turnover and the latest chef got rid of their signature appetizer dish the grilled tiger prawns. They changed the delicious spicy sauce they had for years and years and replaced it with a bland unappealing roasted tomato aioli. They need to keep the original recipe available. All my neighbors complain about the same thing. Bring the sauce back! Last, this is an Italian restaurant. I asked for the classic angel hair pasta sauce. The waiter looked confused and said he will see if the chef knows how to prepare that, even after I gave him the 4 ingredients to make it. Really?", "author": "Jill P."}

Very tasty and delicious.  Thank god the ladies said they could only eat one slice because of the carbs.  MORE FOR ME!   Another app we had was the roasted eggplant.

It was soooooo goooood :).  Dessert.  Who could only pick one?  Piggies that we were, we had the chocolate cake w/sea salt that came with coffee ice cream DAMN GOOD.

After doing some research on Yelp and seeing that Venticello's was close to our hotel and had good reviews, we made reservations.\nWe arrived about 5 minutes before our reservation and were met by 3 different people, the 2 servers and the hostess. After a few minutes our hostess asked us to follow her and then tried to seat us at a table with another couple. The other couple and us gave the hostess a strange look and she realized what just happened and lead us back to the front door to have us wait a bit longer. The hostess then apologized and broke a wine glass right in her hand (which never got cleaned up fully). I felt terrible because then she just started crying, the next thing we knew she grabbed her purse and left - it was unclear if she got the rest of the night off or lost her job.\nWe waited a bit longer until we were seated at a small two-top, with a foot between our neighbors, it felt like we were having dinner with strangers. The wine list is great, but the dinner options are limited, I wish there was more choices. We settled on the margarita pizza and the cioppino. Our food came quickly. We both instantly noticed the absence of garlic in both our dishes, strange. Maybe garlic was 86'ed on the night? Also, there were 3 dead mussels, and one dead calm that was served in the dish - this means the shells never opened when cooked. Typically these dead mussels/clams are removed before serving and are a sign of the shellfish lack of freshness. It didn't taste that fresh. Furthermore the bread served with the cioppino was placed in the stew and was a soggy mess on the bottom of the dish, kind of gross. Also the bread was burnt, and the kitchen continued to burn the bread, because the restaurant stunk. When we pointed out the dead shellfish to our server, we were offered dessert, but didn't get a choice of what we wanted. The tiramisu was good but nothing out of this world.\nIt was really disappointing! The restaurant was cute but the food was not good, the whole experience was strange.

The menu is simple and neat offering good traditional Italian cuisine. We ordered the Arancini, and I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara. The Arancini was excellent and the textures were great. The crispy risotto was a nice touch to the plate and it paired really well with the vino we had ordered.

I decided to take a risk and try out a new restaurant, and he loved Venticello! \n\nThe appetizers were the best part of the meal; I highly recommend the arancini, the carpaccio, and the melanzane. Great dishes to share. I ordered the pappardelle with wild boar sauce. It wasn't what it typically served in Italy (sorry if I sound like a snob) but the homemade pasta was super yummy and the dish had extra large pieces of wild boar which I really appreciated. The best pasta dish, however, was the fettucine with sausage..the sauce to pasta ratio was perfect.\n\nThey have a decent wine list, although the wine by the glass list was a bit small.

Allowed corkage. \n\nFor appetizers, we had salads. The Caesar, a Kale, and a beet salad.  All very nicely done. For main courses, we had Cioppino (Classic with thin broth, nice spice, flavorful, 2 slices of thick grilled bread to mop up the juices) and a Boar Pappardelle (very nice chunks of boar over the pasta and a thick sauce; it compared well to a similar dish I had in Italy last year.  Went very well with a glass of Barbera.).  \n\nWe felt compelled to try the Caramel gelato (creamy and a nice touch of salt), \nVin Santo and Biscotti (classic Italian after dinner treat), and the Chocolate Torte (moist, firm, chocolatey goodness, sprinkled with powdered sugar).", "author": "Dave R."}

I'd been looking forward to trying this place.  Finally got the opportunity last Friday.  Very disappointing.  I'd read the reviews and was looking forward to a good meal, but it was pretty bad. \n\nStarted with the pancetta wrapped shrimp.  Way overcooked, the tails were charred.  We could barely see or taste the pancetta and it was kind of rubbery due to being cooked way too long.  \n\nFor entrees we ordered the lamb chops and the pork chop, which the server recommended.  I ordered the lamb chops rare and they came out medium to medium well.  I find when the more lamb is cooked the more gamey it tastes, hence why I order it rare.  It was overcooked and gamey tasting.  The pork chop which was pounded flat, battered and fried, could have been good, but it had this cloyingly sweet sauce on it.  I think they were going for a savory sweet thing, but the sauce was so sweet it overpowered the dish.  The bread and the creamy polenta, which came with both orders were the best part of the meal.  The wine, an italian red, was good too.\n\nThe service was just ok.  The man who greeted us could have been nicer and more welcoming.  Our server was nice enough.  One complaint, she dropped of the dessert menus and we were actually thinking of ordering a desert to share, but she took so long to come back, we decided against it.  For $150, we expected a better meal and more attentive service.\n\nMaybe we should have ordered pasta.  I watched other tables that ordered pasta and it looked good.

Our food was on the table very fast.  Some people like this so it could be a plus for the restaurant.  It also seemed like a place that had a lot of locals that frequent the restaurant so they are probably prepared each night to serve their regulars.

He seemed completely dismissive of my wife and I during the entire meal.  When taking our drink order, we were deciding between a couple wine options.  Apparently the 8-10 seconds of decision time from us was way too long for him.  He literally walked off, not saying anything, as I was in mid-sentence and didn't return for 5 minutes.  \n\nMy wife and I looked at each other with a \"what just happened\" look.  I initially felt like getting up and leaving right away, but figured I'd just roll with it, but his attitude remained during our entire dinner...never saying anything more than required answers when we ordered, never returning to our table to ask how our food was, if we wanted more drinks, etc.  We originally wanted to order dessert, but were so put off by his attitude that we decided to go elsewhere.  So he finally dropped off the check with a \"hear ya go\".  Again, no \"thanks for coming\", \"have a nice night\", anything.  I get that people can be in a bad mood, and I'm usually tolerant of that stuff...but his overall demeanor and manner were way over the top and very noticeable.  \n\nAll that said:  the food was great.

We had drinks at the Top of the Mark and then walked about 3 blocks to Venticello.  We were seated at the corner window table and our wait person was very attentive and helpful with our choices.  We ordered a wonderful 2010 Brunello and asked for it to be decanted.  I started with the evening special - a fabulous burrata, heirloom tomato and arugula salad with a balsamic dressing, and Jim had the tasty carrot soup.  The focaccia bread and EVOO/balsamic was delicious!  My main course was the risotto with shrimp and tiny squid, Jim had the chicken saltimbocca.  The risotto was great and Jim enjoyed the chicken but said it was a bit too salty.  I topped off my dinner with zabaglione, which had the perfect texture of custard.  The meal was memorable and if I lived in San Francisco I would put it at the top of my list.", "author": "Jann A."}

It may be my new favorite place in the city.\n\n Being the last ones in the restaurant on a Monday night (an hour before they closed) had the potential to be really awkward. Sometimes you feel totally rushed and guilty being the last people in a restaurant. Not at Venticello! Our server assured us that we were more than welcome, and he was glad to have the company. I loved this! \n\nI also loved the wine list, the gnocchi (oh god, so good!), and the desserts. My tiramisu was light and fluffy with incredible flavors, the balance between the mascarpone and espresso was perfect. It was the kind of dessert I absolutely did not want to share. Luckily it was my birthday, so I didn't have to :-) \n\nI really don't see how this place could be \"too cozy\".

The ambiance is rustic, cozy, classy and superfluously romantic. So men, if you need to charm a lady friend, definitely consider dinner at Venticello.  \n\nThe food is very traditional Italian with your typical pastas, Italy-influenced meat courses and great wine. I highly recommend starting off with the Grilled Prawns wrapped in Pancetta with Spicy Chili Sauce - it's definitely a one of a kind, must-try app and the spicy sauce takes it to the next level. Then order the Herb and Goat Cheese Ravioli and the Seafood Risotto for your main courses - they are cheesy without being overpowering, flavorful and extremely well cooked. If you're into something more meaty, I really enjoyed the pork chop - it's flavorful, fattening and juicy. However, the real highlight of the meal is the Tiramisu - it's the perfect way to conclude the night. \n\nI highly recommend making reservations ahead of time as the restaurant isn't that large and tends to get its Fridays and Saturdays booked up a couple of weeks in advance. \n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!", "author": "Priya S."}

I am in the restaurant business (been training fine dining service and opened restaurants all over the world for a couple of decades...) and my husband is a chef...the food was pretty good but I was underwhelmed by the service. And that is a shame because I really wanted to enjoy this evening out. Our server was Aurelie. The main issue I had was that I got the impression either (A) she did not want to serve us or (2) she just plain didn't want to be there. Why? Because a few times when I asked about an item that was ordered but didn't show up (the meatball appetizer, which I asked for after the salads were delivered and eaten, or another glass of wine for my friend - and I had to ask rather than it being offered) - she didn't say, \"Oh, I'll be right back with that, I'm sorry\" or anything like that, rather I got some attitude and a dismissive \"I'm bringing it\". Never did she smile or make eye contact. She looked right past me. Maybe because she didn't think I was the host...? Anyway I spent $315 and ONLY because I used to wait tables did I give her good tip - $75 to be exact. Trust me - had we been given good service I would have tipped more. Usually you tip according to service but truthfully I did not want to further contribute to her sour mood. But I am writing this review and I hope she finds some peace and happiness in doing what she's doing or find something else to do. I loved serving others but not everyone does, I guess.\n\nOh...and after reading other reviews, I noticed we never got any bread either.

I requested ahead of time to be seated at one of the two window tables and to our delight they were able to accommodate us.\n \nWe were immediately greeted by the bartender who congratulate us on our nuptials, and informed us there was Prosecco on ice awaiting our arrival. We were taken to our requested table and granted an unobstructed view of the city night-scape with the Golden Gate Bridge as its backdrop. It was absolutely stunning! We watched pedestrians bundled in winter wear walking their dogs (it was the night before Thanksgiving), and listened to the steady hum of laughter and holiday conversation behind us. \n\nWe were reluctant to request only one plate of each course, but we'd been nibbling and sipping all day; we'd just gotten married.  I believe it to be a direct reflection of the professionalism of the staff that our waiter realized our menu questions, aside from being vegetarian based, were all related to portion sizes. Without hesitation he suggested vegetarian options and then offered to have each course split for two. \n\nWe ordered the soup of the day, a pumpkin and soft cheese concoction (?) that was creamy and richa and hinting of just enough spice. We then had grilled tiger prawns, pancetta, and spicy chili sauce, which we used as the salad course, followed by the Gnocchi Al Funghi; potato dumplings, mushroom cream, gorgonzola...oh my. I tried to muffle the sounds of delight escaping my control, but my wife's sounds of pleasure were equally as audible. Our waiter was pleased, as were we.  We were going to order the Tiramisu, but to our surprise, were gifted the Torta Di Cioccolata, a slice of rich chocolate heaven. \n\nAlong with the food, which I felt was exceptionally good and true to the atmosphere, the staff was attentive without being overbearing. We were given the time to enjoy our meal with conversation and appreciation of the view, while being  greeted individually by the manager and other staff members, each coming to congratulate us with glasses of Prosecco. \n\nReady to sit back and rub our new 'Buddha- bellies', one of the waiters announced to the tables nearest ours, that we had just wed that day...for the first time in my life I refused more Prosecco...\n\nIt was a fabulous meal in a beautiful setting created by an established kitchen and wait staff. \n\nGrazie Venticello!", "author": "Natalie B."}

We arrived at 7:40 and were told by the pleasant bartender/host/social butterfly that it would be just a few minutes and we could wait outside as it was rather stuffy indoors.  Outside we went, for 27 minutes (yes, I was counting).  Recognizing our irritation (read: starvation) we were offered a complimentary glass of wine and a spot at the bar until our table was ready.  I must say, this changed the game for me. The simple acknowledgement of a frustrating situation by the bartender quite literally changed my view of the restaurant and made my night that much more enjoyable.  Finally seated, we enjoyed a second glass of Pinot and the kale salad.  My boyfriend had the fish (LOTS of bones but he loved it anyway) and I had the margherita pizza.  The pizza crust was the most delicious I have had a in a long time, soft center, rustic crusty edges - the type that you could eat the whole thing but you don't want to look like a heifer in front of your man so you stop halfway though and pretend you are full.    \n\nVenticello is definitely a great date/work dinner spot and a great Nob Hill gem.

This also means there is no place to wait after your meal for a cab or for the person driving in your party to get the car and pick you up.\n\nThis place is in Nob Hill and they do not have valet parking.\n\nThe host was very sweet and even introduced us to the couple dining at the table next to us.  That made it easier to handle the fact that the tables are too close together.  The folks next to you are going to hear every word of your conversation, and vice-versa, so you might as well greet each other.\n\nIt was strange that the host made a point of telling us we were getting the \"view\" when this restaurant really doesn't have one.  \n\nThe food was OK.  I had the eggplant appetizer and lamb shank.  The eggplant was in a bowl with way too much tomato sauce.  There were odd unidentifiable ingredients in the orzo that accompanied the lamb shank that should have been identified on the menu.  These are minor complaints.  I didn't leave hungry, but I would not be in any hurry to return here.\n\nMy friend liked her Manhattan so much that she ordered a second one.  I didn't see a bartender, but whoever made it must have done a good job.\n\nWe were too full for dessert, but the woman at the next table described the tiramisu to her husband as \"ridiculous.\"  She meant this as a compliment and told the host it was the best tiramisu she had ever had.", "author": "Bay G."}

The bruschetta was to die for and the mushrooms on top had an amazing smoky flavor.  NOTE: I normally will not even eat a mushroom, but my friend insisted on ordering it, and I could honestly eat this everyday now.  The other appetizers we ordered were just as spectacular.\n\nMain course - mine was a seafood dish (name slips me), and honestly I think I forgot the name because it was rather unappealing, and even the presentation was not very flattering.  My friend ordered the filet and seemed to enjoy it, and it did look very nice.\n\nDessert; orange doughnuts - they were simple and sweet, but instead the sweet dips of chocolate and (I believe it was like a vanilla frosting) - could have been better replaced with side of homewade whipped cream and chocolate - or even a yummy homemade vanilla ice cream.  \n\nI am big on noise level and noise reduction - it was a Tuesday and often I could not hear the friend I dined with seated directly across from me.\n\nMinor detail - CLEAN the windows.  The windows were dirty on the exterior and took away from the nice view of the neighborhood.\n\nOVERALL - I would eat there again, but note that the price is slightly above the norm for SF - our bill exceeded $100 for two and we did not drink wine.", "author": "Douglas P."}

My boyfriend and I were SUPER excited to come to a nice restaurant and have a lovely, delicious, and romantic dinner for New Year's Eve. Sadly, we were mistaken. \n\nAfter waiting a half hour past our reservation time without an apology or complimentary glass of wine we were seated. It then took 20 minutes before a server came over to take our order. She was nice but it seemed like the tables she was taking care of were too spread out, which often left us forgotten. \n\nThe food was not good to put it politely. Everything was either WAY too salty (even dessert), over cooked or undercooked. I love lobster and was really looking forward to that but it was inedible, like I was chewing on rubber. The scallops were the highlight and the Crab ravioli had potential but was a little too al dente. Because it had already been 2.5 hours into our dinner service I didn't want to waste anymore time there by waiting to have it remade. \n\nI was also shocked that the table sitting next to us arrived 20 minutes after we did and received all of their courses before we received ours. It seemed a bit strange to me. \n\nBecause we were so displeased with the service and were already running late to meet up with friends we took our dessert to go and got out as soon as we could. As much as we wanted to love this place it just seems that they were not prepared for the evening and it didn't make for a pleasant dining experience.", "author": "Amanda R."}

The top crust of the apple crostada was too thick for eating in front of a companion, but I happily chipped and gnawed away at it on my own. The real treasure was the wild boar pappardelle.  Fresh pasta and chunks of succulent wild pig in a rich, dark sauce were the perfect choice for a chilly evening in the City.

The clientele is a mix of young and eager foodies and older couples looking to avoid the louder, hipper Italian joints.\n\nBut really, everyone comes here for the menu. My husband was wowed by the pear-and-gorgonzola pizzette as an appetizer. The pears had a sweet fruity taste and held their own against the cheese and a thin, chewy crust. I was less impressed by my minestrone (zucchini, carrots, and spinach in a chicken stock), but the herb bread with garlic and olive oil improved matters considerably. The seafood pasta special caught my attention and my order: penne in a lobster cream sauce with grilled shrimp and Dungeness crab. Decadent as hell, and a generous portion.  Husband got the Salciccia pasta dish, with Italian sausage and a fennel-tomato sauce, and cleaned his plate. \n\nAnd, of course, you can't come here and not try the legendary tiramisu. \n\nWith appetizers generally under $10 and most entrees in the $18-25 range, it's a splurge but not a wallet-buster. Just be forewarned that Venticello tacks on a 4% healthcare surcharge to provide insurance for its waitstaff -- a noble goal worth supporting but other places in the city do a flat fee per diner, which seems to make more business sense.", "author": "M.

Venticello sits atop Nob Hill and is tucked away and almost hidden among the residential apartment buildings. The d\u00e9cor is almost like a Tuscany feel, deep reds and light orange/browns. The restaurant itself has a 2 level dining room. Larger parties on the bottom first level for \"family style\" dining feel with round tables, etc. Doubles upstairs on the 2nd floor. Dimly lit and uber romantic. Too bad my BF and I were super underdressed for our belated 2 month Anniversary dinner post our 2 month Anniversary Spa Day. \n\nWe called in about 6pm and asked if we needed a reservation. The host said that we did not and to just come in. When we got there the host asked for our reservation. We said we didn't have one. He walked away and had a pow-wow of some sort trying to figure out where to seat us. Coldest stare ever. \n\nWe were seated in the \"corner\" upstairs dining room. We were okay with that seeing as we were in flip flops and sneakers. We were served some bread and some olive oil garlic mixture which was AWESOME. I'd say almost the best part of the meal was it. We shared a cesar salad, an arugula & fungi pizzetta, the herb and goat cheese ravioli and the tiramisu for dessert. All were excellent. The cesar salad wasn't to die for but nice. The pizzetta was quite tasty. The mix between the mushrooms and arugula went well together. The herb and goat cheese ravioli (half helping split between 2 and also divided onto 2 bowls) was a bit overpowering. It was a good idea to split the dish as pasta can get quite heavy. The tiramisu was fantastic. It came with some almond cookies which were the 2nd best part of the meal. I love my carbs. \n\n4 stars for an awesome romantic meal in flip flops. 2 stars for the walk up those dang hills. 5 stars for a beautiful night out in Nob Hill. Quite possibly one of the nicest neighborhoods that go overlooked.", "author": "Katie Anne N."}

I found this place and liked the menu, so I made the reservation for my friends and I. They had valet which rocked and after the meal, our friend was able to arrange a special parking situation with the valet, so we didn't have to worry about not getting out of the show in time. \nService at the restaurant was attentive. There was one guy though who was a creeper. Kept looking with a scowl and never one responded to us when we thanked him for clearing our table or giving us water. He seemed very displeased with life. Other than him, everyone was super friendly and chatty. The ambiance was awesome, minus the random eyeless mask on the wall! That needs removal ASAP! \nDim lighting and romantic atmosphere. Definitely a wine place as they only make mixed drinks and not actual cocktails. Since wine makes me fall asleep, I just drank water. Their warm rosemary focacia was to die for! Got two baskets of that. We ordered the spaghetti carbonara without the pancetta and it was killer! I rarely wish my friends were not there so I could have an entire dish to myself. We got the Gorgonzola pizza which was amazing you LOVE Gorgonzola. If not, you will not enjoy as the gorgie flavor is INTENSE!!!! We also shared the Gorgonzola gnocchi which was stellar! SOOOOO YUMMY we literally cleared the plate with our bread to eat the sauce. The only food there that wasn't great, and it's still confusing as to how it wasn't, was the chocolate torte dessert. It tasted like a walnut brownie and had no really chocolaty flavor. Like a muted, walnut brownie. It was odd and none of us liked it. We'd all go back and order it all again, minus the dessert. \nDefinitely not crazy expensive so I have no clue why this place gets $$$ as it's $$. The area, the city, and the caliber of the food make it incredibly reasonable. 3 people, 3 dishes and dessert, one alcoholic beverage, all for $70ish. Not bad at all!!!!!!", "author": "Unicorn U."}

I had the Scampi e Pancetta Fra Diavolo- Fire Grilled Prawns wrapped in Pancetta with a Spicy Chili Sauce. Both were very good and I don't even like eggplant!\n\nFor dinner I picked the Filetto Toscano- Sasame & Black Pepper Crusted Filet with Sweet Roasted Shallots. My dinner companion chose the Maiale con Pere E Balsamico- Grilled Pork Tenderloin Medallions over a Pear Relish & Balsamic Rum Syrup. I enjoyed my steak though I could have done with a more robust sauce to enliven it.\n\nFor dessert we shared the Zabaione Con Frutta E Biscotti- Sweet custard cream served over fresh seasonal berries and cookies. This was a lovely ending to dinner as the dish was packed with sweet, ripe strawberries.\n\nThe only issue that came up with regard to service was that they forgot my tea but still charged us for it.

I knew the ambiance of this ristorante would be exactly how all previous Yelpers have described... enchantingly intimate. The warm cozy feeling that one gets when close friends and family are around is how we were greeted. We definitely had VIP treatment, and I soon found out why... I feel that i have to disclose that my review is somewhat skewed because of the fact that his cousin owns Venticello... \nI love that the main dining area is a downstairs view from the main entrance and bar. Classic elegance with candlelit tables exemplified the ideal ambiance for a date night.  He allowed the waiter to choose our bottle of wine... And it was a fabulous red blend from Sicily: Poggio Di Bortolone... I loved it!  We continued to enjoy the wine, when they served the Grilled Prawn wrapped in Pancetta (we didn't even get the chance to read the menu)... And it was delicious.  I had the Barbabietola E Fagioli: which was a Roasted Beets - Arugula salad... he ordered the Cesarean with Anchovies. They were both good salads, but I preferred mine.

The restaurant is located in a charming neighborhood in Nob Hill. When I first arrived, I noticed the picturesque view of the Bay Bridge from the sidewalk outside of the restaurant. Once inside, the restaurant is small and warm. The tables on the lower level have a view of the open, stone fireplace, which is a nice touch. \n\nI started my dinner with a glass of Chardonnay. The wine was very good, and the pours were huge (I had two glasses of wine that probably amounted to half a bottle). I also tried the Scampi E Pancetta Fra Diavolo and Carpaccio Cipriano. The Scampi dish was comprised of large, meaty prawns that were perfectly grilled and accompanied by a spicy sauce - very good. The Carpaccio was covered in a white truffle vinaigrette, which was amazing (in my opinion, anything with truffle oil is great). \n\nFor my main course I ordered the lamb. Although I requested that it be cooked medium, it was a little closer to medium-well. Nevertheless, the lamb was well seasoned and very tender. The fresh vegetables served with the lamb were perfectly cooked and incredibly flavorful, and the mashed potatoes were smooth, creamy, and delicious. \n\nFinally, for dessert I had the Panna Cotta. Most Panna Cotta desserts that I have tried are quite dense, but this one was very very creamy. It had orange and almond flavors and was quite good. \n\nThis place was yet another find in San Francisco and I would recommend giving it a try.", "author": "David S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-08-26", "description": "We went on a date here Saturday night. Disappointed that we chose Venticello (on a high yelp recommendation btw). I'd also like to add context to the review; our dinner was over $150 for 2 people (with a $47 bottle of wine) which is inline with what we typically spend for dinner but also comes with an expectation of good quality at that price point.\n\nFirst off, the positives: (1) Great atmosphere- the restaurant is super charming and has a beautiful view. (2) The waitstaff and host were very nice and friendly. (3) reservation was ready on time. (4) The wines were very fairly priced. We ordered a nice bottle of Hendry and were pleasantly surprised at the $47 price point (I would usually pay in the $70 range for that wine).\n\nSo some clearly positive aspects of the restaurant. The two star rating is based on the following: (1) The food was mediocre at best. Our shrimp appetizer was not flavorful at all. Our beet salad was so-so at best. We ordered the gnocchi (which was good to be fair) but the pasta dish above it on the menu (which our waitress highly recommended) we ate one bite of and then left it there bc it was not good. Came out somewhat cold and completely lacked flavor. My king crab risotto tasted like a bowl of white rice. The flavors did not blend at all and I think the rice was undercooked (very bummed here). The food experience was very poor. (2) After sitting down at the bar before our meal, it took 12 minutes before somebody asked us for our order. 12 minutes waiting to order a drink feels like an eternity and by the time the drinks finally arrived we had to carry them to our table to sit down. (3) The gentleman tending the bar, who was very nice (again to be fair), couldn't give us a wine recommendation. He said he didn't know the wine list at all. The guy serving you at the bar should at a minimum be able to offer a recommendation.\n\nFinal note: We didn't have a terrible experience, but I'm very disappointed with some very key aspects for our meal (ie the food). Hopefully it will improve.", "author": "Kyle J."}

The food here was impeccable. I started my meal off with the complimentary bread and olive oil. The complaint: there was too much balsamic in the oil, which made it slightly unappealing. My salad was the caprese salad, which was amazing. I found myself using bread to collect the remaining pesto and olive oil. My entree was a saut\u00e9ed pork tenderloin with spinach and potatoes. It was lightly breaded with a slightly sweet sauce. Amazing! Finally I had the mint tea along with complimentary tiramisu. Why was it complimentary?\nThe atmosphere was completely ridiculous. My family of four was seated by the huffy owner near the bar in front of an open door on a cold and windy night. The owner appeared to be looking down on us because we were a family in his restaurant with mostly couples and parties of friends. The door we were seated in front of was rarely ever closed unless I myself interrupted my meal to get up and shut it. The party seated behind us was friends with the owner and subsequently did as they pleased. Which meant they brought their non-service dog into the restaurant. Personally I love dogs...just not when I'm eating and also have intense allergies and asthma. The party behind us carried on loudly and bumped our table and pretended as though we were not there until we said something to the owner. The owner then moved us slightly further away from the bar and when the bill came one of our meals was taken off and the tiramisu was complimentary. The owner was very accommodating but I did not like that he allowed his friends to come in and allow him to get a bad review from someone like me.

When the BF suggested a fancy date night, I inquired about Venticello.\nWe arrived a little before 9 for a 9:15 reservation and the place was packed. The bar area has 5 or 6 barstools that were completely taken by people eating full meals, so there really wasn't anywhere to stand and have a nice glass of wine before dinner, as the entryway isn't laid out very well.  You end up standing in a hallway where busboys are trying to get around you.\n\nWe left and headed down Taylor 1 block to get a drink, but the only other restaurant we saw also didn't have a bar...odd! So back to Venticello we went, and waited for our table.\n\nOnce we were seated, the service was pretty good. Not great. But pretty good. We received our appetizers before our bread....I found that very odd. We were so hungry and were ready for that bread!!\n\nA nice bottle of Montepulciano later, we were loving our meals. The BF had the special of Halibut, and I had the goat cheese ravioli.\n\nWe shared a dessert and by the time we were done, we were literally the only ones left in the restaurant. Whoops! You could tell they were ready for us to leave, but because of the quiet neighborhood location, it's not an ideal spot to hail a cab, so we asked the host to call one for us. He does, and then proceeds to leave for the night. Tacky.\n\nIt is very cold outside, we we wait inside for the cab, as the busboys are mopping and blowing out the candles. We finally felt so awkward and almost intrusive, that we just waited outside for the cab that NEVER CAME.  We saw a cable car coming downhill, so we hopped on that and took it to California where we went and got martini's at The Big Four inside the Huntington.\n\nThe ambience (and company :) was so great that we chose to overlook some of the things that should have been handled better.

Neither of us had been, and we are fairly new to the area.  I made my reservation via OpenTable for 8:15 on a Sat night.  \n\nValet parking was easy, and only $10 (w/o tip).   The entrance is a little odd, without much room to stand, and the little waiting hallway is right by upstairs tables (luckily they were empty when we came in, or I would have felt kind of awkward being practically ON their table; LOL).

Wait staff was attentive without being obtrusive. Menu was a tiny bit limited but I'm a picky eater. Pretty good wine list, albeit a bit pricey, but it is Nob Hill.

That's either brave or stupid...I'll let you be the judge of that.\n\nWe walked down the street and found Venticello, which had been favorably rated on Yelp, so we ventured in. The restaurant was packed, but to our amazement were two vacant stools side-by-side at their cozy bar. We sat and were immediately greated by Daniel, who we first thought was the bartender and later realized was running the restaurant. \n\nI had a clean and generous Saphire martini to start with and my wife had what lived up its billing as a great Cosmopolitan. We started by splitting a half order of the mushroom and gorgonzola gnocci. It was out of this world. The flavor was intense and rich. There was cream in the sauce, but this sauce is much more about flavor than about the cream. \n\nWe continued by splitting an excellent salad that came with what obviously was a housemade honey dijon dressing that wasn't your typical sweet TGI Friday's syruppy goop. This dressing was simply oil, honey, herbs, dijon and I'm guessing a little balsamic. \n\nWe then wrapped up the evening by splitting seared Ahi with a lemon caper sauce on it served over polenta and fresh spinach. Everything was fresh and flavorful, especially the fish, which was served perfectly seared and rare inside.\n\nThis is a restaurant we will definitely return to so we can experience more of the great service we received there and sample more of the terrific food. Next time, we'll even book a reservation, though we'll miss hanging out at the bar with Daniel and the other friendly locals we met there.", "author": "Eric W."}

Maybe because it was summer and at 8:30pm it was still bright? Maybe you need to go when it's dark?

Yes, LOCATION is its best feature: right in the heart of Nob Hill, on the top of the hill, and along the cable car line. It was super romantic to walk around the area before and after dinner (of course we did not have the common wind and fog). \n\nI would recommend this place for someone that wanted to take time before and after dinner to take a romantic walk, even if short and enjoy looking at the pretty Nob Hill homes - just plan do do that on a day when the fog or the wind are not taking over.

In short, our entrees were cold and overcooked. And amazingly, the diversity of our choices (heirloom tomatoes, lamb, pork, and beef) was counteracted by the chef's use of the SAME exact balsamic reduction sauce on all four. Had they run out of ingredients? \n\nMy boyfriend, who's normally good-natured and forgiving, simply had to send back his dish when his mashed potatoes and pork medallions arrived cold. He mentioned, too, that he'd expected the pork medium rare (as was communicated), but instead, had well-done meat. Our waiter took this in stride, but the situation was remedied with a microwave. Mike's dish was returned to him five minutes later, warmed up, still overcooked, and grossly underhandled by management.\n\nThe meal for all four of us was lackluster and disappointing, and I felt personally let down by a restaurant I've always counted on.

There are some affordable bottles of wine under $50.  This is a good date place, just order the pasta tho.  A bit on the spendy side for pasta tho around 17-20, but it's so filling and tasty. At best the service was robotic--like timely, with zero personal touch.

Good italian food is about loving life not just dinner. Italian dining is a total experience.  When someone finds a nice neighborhood restaurant like Venticello's they tell their close friends and bring them there as I have done.  But, you got to do it right.....  Doing Italian right is about optimizing the pleasure quotient.\n  \nVenticello's has its own flavor.  The main dining area is very cozy.  It has kind of a rustic wooden italian feel to it.  You can see a sliver of the view down to the bay bridge from the corner window.  This is all part of the atmosphere. The wine list at venticello is quite good. But I later found out that venticello's offers a corkage fee.  So, the last time we brought in two bottles of vino, which we happily consumed. I split their fresh romaine caesar salad with a friend and ordered the mushroom gnocchi.  It was very good. Also, the folks who work here are pretty cool and have a passion for the place. \n\nSo in summary, the venue, plus great food, plus italian wine, (sangiovese), plus a little passion, plus good company, equals a beautifully satisfying dining experience.

This experience was lack-luster in terms of food quality, but not enough to write it off despite the poor experience and better production from people who specialize in desserts. \n\nExperience 2 was for my birthday. The same poor server greeted us (without reservations) for my birthday and told us they were not able to accommodate us without a res until 9:30. We told him to call us if something opened up and there was NO desire to - he was barely even willing to write the number down on a random piece of paper which I'm sure he threw away when we walked out. \n\nExperience 3 was today. Ordered the shrimp app and the bresola/mozzerella appetizer. The shrimp were overcooked, horribly dry and completely unappealing. Despite eating only 1, the server/host said nothing. Next the deliciously (sarcastic) feet-smelling bresola/mozzerella pizza was completely unappetizing and nothing like a supposed Italian pizza. Still nothing was said when I dropped $35 eating 1 shrimp and 1 slice of pizza.\n\nThis isn't really a surprise given that we had the EXACT same experience at Nob Hill Cafe (same owners/business) a few weeks ago. \n\nYou could get better quality at the Olive Garden. (and in case you didn't know, Olive Garden is about as far from traditional Italian as you can get). \n\nHead to North Beach for something better. \n\nIf you want arrogance, over-priced food, and lack-luster food, then please feel free to make a reservation or wait until 9:30 to dine.", "author": "Joe D."}

As we awaited the dessert menus, the waiter arrived and announced, \"this is our flourless chocolate cake\" as he set it down in front of me. A bright sparkle caught my eye -- an incredible engagement ring was resting beside the slice of cake, as if it were part of the garnish! Next thing I knew, my boyfriend knelt down in front of me and proposed :) I was speechless as he slid the ring on my finger.

Replete with a high stack wood-burning oven, and cable cars occasionally passing by.\r\n\r\nFood-wise, it seems they've mastered tastes and textures even in the simplest dishes...  The apps were my favorite: 1) Smokey portobello mushroom cooked in the wood oven, served on soft polenta with crunchy, chopped pine nuts mixed throughout, rosemary and some tangy tomato dice.  2) Salty pancetta-wrapped succulent prawns with a very hot pepper oil/sauce.  3) Salad of sweet red & gold beets, salty capers, tangy vinaigrette, in a bitter radicchio cup. \r\n\r\nLobster bisque pasta with prawns was a creamy, garlicky delight.  Tiramisu was allegedly good, but I don't like that mushy blobby dessert anyway, so can't rate that one...\r\n\r\nGreat meal.  The Clos du Val Chardonnay is nice and smokey, and goes great with all their dishes that come out of the wood oven.", "author": "Melanie C."}

It was subtly lighted  by candles complete with wood burning fireplace (brick oven)that added to its alluring ambiance. \n\nI arrived a little early to give them a special request on behalf of celebrating my friend's new job.  Given that it was busy night (we were seated after a 30 minute wait), Daniel (Manager) welcomed the added request and even comped my champagne and friend's beer to remedy the long wait.  What a great way to start the celebration ! :-)\n\nOur waiter was attentive and easily accommodated a seating change due to the proximity to the fireplace (quite warm). The giant open door windows gave a fantastic view of the Bay Bridge and also welcomed the warm gentle breeze inside.\n\nI checked their menu to see if they offered light dishes given the warm week we've been having.  I found that they had a few dishes which were not too heavy and was confident that my health conscious friend would find a desirable meal.\n\nWe shared the appetizer Prosciutto E Pere Con Mascarpone- this was  delightful just enough to whet both our appetites.  The pear was softly blanched and added sweetness to the lightly salted prosciutto ham.\n\nMy friend ordered the Filetto Di Sogliola- two generous  filet of Petrale Sole pan fried to perfection, complimented by the white wine sauce seasoned with capers and cracked pepper.  The polenta cake was just enough to make this a perfect comfort food on a warm evening.  I was excited to try the Gnocchi al Funghi ( Im making a list of the best ones in the city) and I would probably give this one 3 stars.  The gold nuggets were dense and too thick in nature- I was longing for the pillowy, velvety texture but these did not measure up( I think it was overcooked).  Its sauce was just a tad salty for my taste and the mushroom pieces didn't add complexity to the creamy nature of this flavoring.\n\nThere are others dishes I would like to try the next time I visit:-  the Risotto with Tiger Prawns, the Ravioli and Scalopine!  Perhaps on a cold rainy day ;-)\n\nPS- The tiramisu congratulatory cake arrived complete with our waiter's well wishes (complimentary  as well!).

No parking in the area, it seemed, and the rain curbed my enthusiasm for further searching.\n\nWe walk in, choose a table on the entrance level (entrance is located higher up along the slope that the restaurant spans). Rose petals are strewn over white tablecloth, nice touch.\n\nWines are picked. Menu matched what they had on their site a month ago. Girlfriend still not too happy with the choices, but I have faith in Yelp and The Four-Star Cutoff (which I still maintain would make an awesome band name).\n\nWe order.\n\nValentine's Day destroys food, it seems. I'll recount the carnage course by pseudo-course.\n\nAppetizers:  Lobster bisque too salty for the lady, my salmon carpaccio seemed like it was a no-prep dish, just a few things tossed onto a plate alongside the salmon. No flavors mixing in glorious dance, no subtle twisting of colors in my minds eye (think Ratatouille); I am disappointed. My lady is frowning, because she can and does make food better than this. I am frowning because she is frowning.\n\nFirst entree: The root of my gripe with their \"four-course\" label, this is barely another appetizer. I know it is technically still a course, but I still feel the urge to protest that fact. Larger than an amuse-bouche, I suppose, but the comparison is worth a mention.\nAnyhow, a choice between cheese ravioli and gnocchi. I go ravioli, lady takes the gnocchi. Ends up being four decent-tasting pieces of ravioli and a small pile of some overcooked, oversalted gnocchi. Possibly the best food of the evening--or more correctly, the least terrible.\n\nSecond entree: The lady gets chicken marsala, I the New York steak. Chicken is oversalted. I know everything my girlfriend has gotten is labeled as too salty, I should add that her taste runs towards the lighter side of salt, but it was salty even for me.\nSteak had some butter-ish sauce on top of it. Crusted on top. I was not happy. i kept thinking of heat lamps and warming drawers. And tureens of mushroom gravy.\nThe steak was also weirdly tough; again, my feeling is that overcooking was involved.\n\nDessert: Cheesecake was bad. Other thing was bad. We were ready to leave.\n\nAll this for $250.\nI am not coming back.\nWith respect to food, I would have preferred pho, Taco Bell, or otherwise. I must emphasize that this is not hyperbole. I really feel that I have derived more enjoyment from a large bowl of #15 pho (rare steak and tripe, in case the number system doesn't translate).\nWith respect to price, I would go to Gary Danko instead.\n\nI don't like to give one-star reviews. They seem to indicate either unnecessary anger at being snubbed by the employees, or an intentional snubbing of the establishment. But here, I cannot think of much to redeem this place, and unfortunately, not enough to justify a second star. I understand that V. Day is difficult (easy comparison to D-Day), but isn't that what a selective prix-fixe menu--pardon this--fixes? Last year's restaurant managed an excellent meal. The year before was fine, too. Both of those meals cost less than $50 per person. Why can't this highly-rated, centrally-located restaurant do at least as well?\nAnd why am I strongly considering doing dinners on the day before AND the day after Valentine's Day, instead of the day itself? It really sounds like a good idea at this point.\n\nI will be actively dissuading friends and family from dining at this restaurant. So actively dissuasive will I be, that I will suggest alternatives, like the aforementioned Gary Danko, or even Rutherford Grill up near Napa.", "author": "David H."}

I have just moved back to SF for business from my native Terni in central Italia. A work colleague of mine asked me to join him for a dinner at Venticello. As a\nwe entered everything seemed very nice. Then we sat down and disaster began, first thing we both saw was a mouse or rat running accross the dining room under our table. First we laughed and then we were a little nervous. Then the food began to arrive.  Oh my, really???  this is NOT Italian food in any way , everything over salted with 70's presentations. This place is lost in 1976 food.  We start with carpaccio which was flavorless and the arugula was slimy and yellow, we left it behind. I was liking some pasta so I ordered the Carbonara which is a regional dish in my native area. Terrible, inedible, salty and undercooked. My friend had a filet that was described as pancetta wrapped with guanchale...whats guanchale...I think the word they were looking for was \"guanciale\".....also way too salty and the presentaion looked like a 10 year old made it. Plenty oferrors in grammar on the menu not to say. Sorry, but for these prices I would surely hope there is better Italian food than this in SF, such an international city with good food reputaion.  I was embarrased for this place.  $150 fo ra terrible experience, i can eat in any trattoria in my town for 30 or 40 euros and have food that is 100 times better.  I guess the mice eat ok.

In contrast to A16, Delphina or countless other Italian restaurants this place is not very good at all. First off we were welcomed by an unfriendly man behind the bar in a giant canary yellow shirt, note to the world; if you are a really big man, canary yellow is not your color, regardless, he was cold, brusque and left us to our nice, but wholly discombobulated waitress. \n\nUpon sitting and ordering, our underwhelming dining experience commenced. Our Manhattan's were extremely watered down, and the food was over-seasoned, poorly presented and contrived at best, though the mashed potatoes were great and the food inoffensive, but I should never be saying that the mashed potatoes were the highlight of a fairly pricy dinner. The wine list is a total joke, I mean, total joke, no attempt was made to even remotely enter into the San Francisco mindset of wine, instead we had a mediocre bottle of Mt. Veeder Cab, which is sad when it's the best thing on a list. Also, the decor and atmosphere were not 'romantic' as described, but really cheesy and dated.

This place has a really nice, rustic feeling lower dining area, and we loved the open wood-burning oven and interesting detail work/antique-like, yet tasteful decor.  But more importantly, everything we ate was delicious.\n\nWe started w/ a daily special salad of fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil over arugula with a sundried tomato vinaigrette (a nice spin on the classic caprese).  I don't even like sundried tomatoes, but I found the dressing delicious and the ingredients were impressively fresh.  \n\nMy mother ordered the herb and goat cheese ravioli in a tomato, basil, garlic sauce.  As much as I love ravioli, I usually shy away from ordering anything resembling marinara sauce when at a restaurant because it seems like something I can make just as easily at home, but I have to say the pasta certainly was delicious (they make it themselves) and the sauce certainly did not come from a jar.  \n\nI had the grilled lamb tenderloins (i adore lamb), and they cooked it perfectly(i.e. rare...I hate getting overcooked meat).  I also was expecting little circular medallions, but they cut it more in a vertical from the tenderloin, which was interesting and thus made for larger portions.  Plus the mashed potatoes and mushroom chianti sauce were divine.  Even my mother who has sworn off lamb b/c she can't stand the taste anymore actually enjoyed a bite of mine.  \n\nDessert of fresh berries in custard cream served in a martini glass was a lovely cap on the evening.  \n\nThe waiter was very friendly and attentive (i loved the big water glasses because I go through water in restaurants like nobody's business).  I also heard our waiter telling the table next to us that they've been in sf for decades now, before the small-plate craze became popular, so they still like to serve large hearty portions.  \n\nYes, this is a nicer restaurant for slightly more special occasions if you're on a budget, but the food is definitely top notch, the ingredients fresh, and the atmosphere comforting and friendly.", "author": "Anne Marie B."}

The menu looked thoughtful and carried the distinction of being Michelin-rated as a great value.\n\nWe entered the restaurant and were all suitably impressed by the inviting elegance of the place: dark wood panelings, white Christmas lighting throughout, comfortable seating and a surprisingly good lounge music mix floating in the background of quiet chatter and tinkling dishes.\n\nDisappointingly, we were seated in the front upstairs bar area, Venticello's low-rent district to be sure.

It has NEVER disappointed.\n\nVenticello is in a wonderful neighborhood Nob Hill location. It's somewhat small, but very cozy with a huge wood burning oven in the middle. The restaurant is one room, built on several tiers. The best tables are on the lower level by the front windows. Try to get the corner window table.\n\nThe menu offers a mix of Italian regional specialties -- not too many items, just enough. Salads, pasta courses, main courses -- just enough selections to find what you prefer.\n\nThe wine list is similar -- enough to find something you'll like, but not too much to confuse you. For example, during our recent visit there were 3-4 Italian reds in the $30s. We settled on a Vino Nobile di Montepulciano for just $34.\n\nService is generally very good. This past trip was a best ever. We arrived 10-15 minutes ahead of our reservation and were seated immediately. Service was attentive and informative. Every course was perfectly timed. And we left with a bill under $100 for two, even with wine.\n\nVenticello is a winner!", "author": "Tom K."}

At first it seemed promising. We called to make a reservation, none were really available till 8:30. We mentioned how close we lived and she said we could come in at 6 as long as we were out by 8. It was nice that they could fit us in, but it was sort of weird that they gave us an end time.\n\nSo we arrived and all looked good. We were seated...and then we waited...and waited...and waited. No one came to wait on us. The restaurant was by no means full or busy. We sat there and watched the hostess and another waitor chat. No bus boy, no water, no bread...NOTHING. Another couple was then seated after us and waited on before us. Sorry, but a little OCD about things going in order.\n\nOnce we were waited on we ordered. The wine was excellent. I'm sorry but the food was only average in my book. I got the risotto with prawns and it greatly lacked flavor. I don't know if they forgot the seasoning or what was going on, but the entire meal I felt like something was missing. My boyfriend for the sole, which was good, but the lemon and caper flavors were beyond overpowering. He was overseasoned, and was under.\n\nThe environment was very cute and charming, but if you have trouble reading in low light bring a flashlight. This place could use a few extra candles. I had to hold a candle to my menu, and it was still difficult to read.\n\nI'm always willing to give a place a second chance, so I will go back.\n\nA few tips: \n - Make reservation\n - Request to sit downstairs.

Don't know if I would come again though, because there are a lot of better restaurants in the city.\n\nAddition: The reviewer below me personally messaged me to insult my review b/c he didn't agree with my review.  Big deal - we all have different taste.  So I am just going to respond to his review:\n\n\"Good italian food is about loving life not just dinner... Doing Italian right is about optimizing the pleasure quotient.\"\n - That goes for more than just Italian food.   Italians are DEFINITELY not the only culture that believe the dining experience is a time to sit back, relax, socialize, and enjoy.  Practically everywhere in Europe and parts of Asia are like this.  With that said, there are tons of other restaurants even just on my street with a far warmer and more sociable environment than this place.  This comment sounds like it could come from a pretentious \"I've traveled/lived in Italy/know Italians and know about Italian culture thus my opinion matters more than yours\" type person.  I hate to break it to you, but I'm sure a lot of people have done at least one of those things as well, including myself.  \n\nI liked the set-up at Venticello, but I did not find it to be one my favourite restaurant ambiances in San Francisco.  I was there with some friends, and it was quiet and dead  ( where's the passion mentioned in the review below? It wasn't there when I was eating my dinner).  Good company can make a restaurant seem far more enjoyable, but I do not think that the people you bring to the restaurant should be part of the review of the restaurant (otherwise I might as well give 5 stars to every restaurant I bring my friends to).  So I'm not going to factor that into my review.  \n\nMy review was based on what I found the restaurant itself to be - The food and the set-up are good, but I've experienced far better in SF.  If it was cheaper, I'd give it one more star.  But, for the prices, I could easily find a restaurant with better food, a better atmosphere, and more creativity.", "author": "Jen Z."}

There seemed to be just one waiter working the downstairs dining room and while there were some pauses when we wanted to order more wine he did an effective job of attending to us.  We ordered and enjoyed the arancini and the heirloom tomato gazpacho with shrimp relish; my husband's cioppino was one of the best we've had - they didn't overdo it on the tomatoes and instead it was closer to a broth consistency with a deep concentrated flavor and tons of seafood.  My lamb shank was the big miss of the evening - it was cooked perfectly but  woefully lacking in seasoning - it really needed a good dose of salt as the gremolata served with it was not nearly enough to punch up the flavor.

Maybe we hit the restaurant on a bad night, but this restaurant was just not worth the money.\n\nWhen dining at a restaurant in this price range, I expect quality service. I'm willing to forgive overpriced food if the service is great, but I am not willing to forgive poor service - even if the food is great - when paying higher prices. In this case, the service was awful, and some (but not all) of the food was really poor. It is just not worth the price, and I am generally a forgiving customer who tips extremely well. In this case, I won't go back.\n\nOur server was rude. For example: as my husband ordered his food (the last of us to order), our server took his menu from his outstretched hand and walked away before the words were completely out of his mouth. There was no eye contact (it never occurred to me how rude this seems until it happened to us last night), nor were there smiles of any kind except the patronizing sort (you know what those look like). We prefer to bring our own, off-the-menu, hard-to-find bottle(s) of wine to accompany our dinners; we brought two, since there were four of us last night (and yes, we generally tip well, and on what the meal would have cost with wine ordered from the menu). The first bottle was opened and poured only after we'd been waiting for too long, and even then without a question about whether we'd like to taste first (we always say no, but we've never NOT been asked). When the salad and soup arrived, there was no offer of fresh ground pepper - although I'd seen it offered to other tables around us, and we both would have liked it. The small pre-ground/generic pepper dispenser on the table was empty. We waited to have our second bottle of wine opened, with empty glasses, for far too long. When the second bottle was finally poured, we did not receive new glasses, even though it was a different wine (cardinal sin for a restaurant purporting to have a great wine list). I suppose at least it was the same color as the first bottle. My meal was so salty (and I like salt) I couldn't eat it, but our server only asked us how our meal was in passing, walking by so quickly I couldn't grab his attention to request a change. In fact, my meal (the carbonara) made me ill. My almost-untouched bowl of pasta was taken by one of the busboys (busmen? I hate to call them boys.), without any second glance or reappearance by our server. Another one of the meals (fettuccine) was also extremely salty, although tolerable. The risotto was - shockingly - undersalted (had they dumped so much into mine they ran out?). We were left holding dessert menus for far too long, and finally gave up and ordered no dessert.\n\nOverall, I felt we mainly annoyed our server, weren't offered appropriate service for the price we were paying, weren't offered the same service other diners were being offered, and more than half of what we ordered was total crap.\n\nI want to emphasize that I understand that servers are underpaid, and are meant to make up their paycheck in tips. As such, I consistently tip 20%, and in fact my husband and I have been known to leave 35 - 40% for spectacular service. We are both forgiving of average food with wonderful service; in fact, we repeatedly patronize specific, very average restaurants because of the service.\n\nVenticello offered neither excellent service nor excellent food. We still tipped about 17%, but begrudgingly. We also just left cash because our server never came back to pick up the bill...\n\nThis is overpriced and haughty, and absolutely not worth it. There are so many better places to go. Save your  money and aggravation.", "author": "Megan H."}

The last time I ate here was the week before Christmas; my boyfriend & I took his friends out for dinner. We had zero issues with our reservation, and honestly? I have never had to wait despite showing up on busy nights. Steven does a great job handling those who are waiting, and occasionally hops behind the bar to make one of the greatest martinis ever. My one real complaint is about the wine list: get some more exciting Italian wines BTG. The BTG offerings are rather pedestrian, and the only one I can really recommend is the Dolcetto. Why would you pour a CA Sauv Blanc at an Italian restaurant when there is Vermentino or Garganega to be had?\n\nI will echo those reviewers who have balked at waiting in the upstairs area - it's simply awkward if there's no room at the bar because you're standing right in the way of servers coming from the downstairs area. I would definitely not recommend this as a place for larger groups either. And please don't come here if you're claustrophobic; the tables downstairs are very close together. Hello, couples - don't come here to fight!\n\nDo come here if you are a fan of perfectly executed pasta... I have never had a bad pasta dish here but then, I don't come to an Italian restaurant to have cheese ravioli. The classic carbonara is one of the best around, and the fettucine con salsiccia has a perfectly addictive creamy spicy sausage sauce. I don't understand how you would order this dish not realizing that there is sausage in it - the sauce is \"con salsiccia\", they can't take the meat out! I actually wouldn't wish for larger portions; there are times I have had to get half boxed for lunch the next day. Then again, I'm not a runner, ha ;)\nI have not had the caprese app (it hasn't been in season since I moved here in Sept), but I have enjoyed the radicchio cups with beets and the funghi pizza. The Caesar salad has a unique presentation with the whole romaine leaves, and the dressing is also quite tasty. The spicy prawns are good too, as they are not overwhelmingly spicy. My favorite app though, HANDS DOWN, is the carpaccio. I have never seen it \"burried in veggies\", the only veg as accompaniment is arugula and 3 caperberries, tops. The white truffle vinaigrette is so good I use my bread to sop up the remains - forget the garlic olive oil (although it's awesome!). I will echo the comment about some \"dated\" presentation as well though; the last time we were there, every entree came plated with the same tired-looking veggies: carrots and something green (broccoli?), even on the veal/prawn dish (which was otherwise great, especially the Sambuca cream).\n\nI have never experienced any \"attitude\" from Alejandro. He is one of my favorite servers. Stefano and Tim also do a great job. Sometimes they are a little slow (probably taking a cig break), but they also obviously hang back when it gets a little romantic up in there. No one has ever been snotty to me about a reservation or anything else. The atmosphere can't be beat either; it's intimate and warm every night of the week. I kind of want to keep it a secret, but I also can't help recommending the place since it's so much better than the \"traditional\" (read: shitty tourist trap) restaurants in North Beach.

Our table was ready right when we showed up. Hearing the cable cars roll by was so lovely. Our server was very attentive and helpful. Since I am pregnant, I couldn't partake in their wine list, but our server created some special non alcoholic concoctions for me! We had the eggplant rolls and the pear and gorgonzola pizzete for appetizers. In retrospect, we probably could have shared one of those, especially the pizza. They were both divine.\n For our entrees my husband had the pork tenderloin in rum and balsamic reduction which was absolutely amazing!! I would never look at pork tenderloin on a menu and jump on it immediately, but in this case, you definitely should! I opted for the special butternut squash ravioli which was very good and fresh. I will definitely go back so I can try the rosemary lamb! Our server even brought out a slice of their tiramisu with a candle on it for his birthday. When we got the bill, our server had comped my drinks and one of my husband's glasses of wine.

Dare I say quaint. Also quaint in the way that they have no system to greet guests. Other than the quaintness of no check-in plan, which would only be problem upon first visit. Setting: ****\n\nFood: We attempted to do a 3-course meal. Ordered antipasti, pasta, then main courses. We didn't do it in an incredibly douche-y way, but we let our server know our plan. The antipasti came out at scary light speed. (Like was it already plated?) Our table had five people. The shrimp app had four shrimp. Never did the server mention that fact. Sort of common practice at a decent place. Also the shrimp was small and dried out, like not cooked to order, I think. Pizza part of our first course was good. Pasta course was pretty good. Not great, but good. \nEntrees and desserts were pretty okay. Lamb was over-cooked. Chicken marsala was really good. Great sauce. Pork was okay. Nothing really inspired. \n\nService: Saved it for last 'cause it was worst. The waiter clearing an expensive bottle of wine with much wine left in the bottle was a new treat.

Let me preface this: we both are not picky eaters, and like to dine out at all types of restaurants - both of us were extremely less than impressed by the food - my pasta was overcooked, my boyfriend's steak was overcooked, and my fish was wayyy to salty. We didnt even want to look at dessert - which is a rare occurence for us. Also, the service was terrible :( - we had no idea where our waitress was for 45 minutes. The couple to the left of us sat down before us, but got their dinner after us. The couple to the right of us sat down after us but got their dinner and dessert before us.

I wouldn't want to get expectations up too high for very fine diners, but it's certainly a very nice, somewhat upscale neighborhood place.  If going, request a table in the main, downstairs area, as the small upstairs room is where people wait if a table isn't ready.\n\nThe one other respect in which I wouldn't want to raise folks' expectations is re the corner table downstairs that has what some reviewers have called a fantastic Bay view.  I'd call it a narrow view bordering on a sliver looking down the street and seeing part of the Bay Bridge.  Not bad, but as Bay views go nothing that special.", "author": "Stephen G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-11-28", "description": "Who should go here: Residents of Nob Hill and surrounding area, or people looking for a north beach type Italian restaurant in a more quiet setting.\n\n1 Star - Lacking/Turn Off\n2 Stars - Needs Work, But fixable\n3 Stars - Adequate\n4 Stars - Near perfect, rough edge here or there\n5 Stars - Can't get much Better\n\nAmbience/Atmosphere: 3 Stars.  Believe it or not I was actually disappointed in the ambience/atmosphere at Venticello.  It was nice, quiet, with a bit of a romantic feel.  However, it seemed a bit forced and unnatural.  It actually seemed a little generic, and not the hole and the wall Italian place I had envisioned before going there.  This could have been some place in a mall in the midwest.  There is nothing really disappointing about it, but there are many more romantic/cosy places in the city, with much better ambience.  Very average.\n\nService:  2.5 stars.  Our waiter was very nice, but I felt dropped the ball throughout the meal.  One thing I hate is when waiters/waiteresses over pour wine, making you feel rushed.  Here we found ourselves pouring our own wine, because of the very infrequent visits by the help.  Also, he didn't provide much value add to the meal and definitely did not enhance the dining experience.  It wasn't bad enough where I wouldn't come back, I just felt neglected and searching for more.   This could have been luck of the draw of who was helping us, so I wouldn't make a decision on going to Venticello on my service comments.\n\nFood: 3 stars.  The food at Venticello to me was typical North Beach Italian fair.  I was hoping for a lot more from this place given many of the glowing reviews over the years.  But to be honest it was pretty average, and most of the dishes were prepared in typical fashion and were a little bland.  Basically, nothing special.  We started off with the roasted mushrooms over polenta and the beef carpaccio.  The mushrooms were a pleasent surprise and I highly recommend them.  However, I was disappointed in the carpaccio, of which normally I am a huge fan.  It just seemed bland to me, and it seemed the meat didn't have the quality I have come to appreciate in a dish of this style.  For entrees we had the Lamb and the chicken.  Both were decent, but seemed to lack punch, or uniqueness to make them stand out.  I found myself searching for something that seemed to never show up.  The food here by no means is bad, it just is your average fair that you expect from a little neighborhood joint.\n\nWine:  2.5 stars.  I brought in my own wine for the main course and we ordered by the glass both before and after.  The by the glass selection is poor, with not much exciting.  It is quaffable, but that is about it.  The wine list is definitely well thought out with most regions of popular Italy represented.  There are only a few good choices, hence the 2.5 rating here, but I can tell some effort went into building a small list of wines to try and match the style of food.  I would love to see them add some items on the list from some not so typical parts of Italy that have now emerged on the scence and are producing fabulous wines (and at better prices than the famous regions).  Prices on the wine list here are very fair.\n\nOverall: I have to say I had my hopes up for Venticello and came away a little disappointed.  I was really looking for something a little more unique, but rather I felt the same as when I walk out of any regular Italian restaurant in North Beach.  If you live walking distance, I recommend trying Venticello, because it is a decent meal and a nice quiet place to talk and enjoy anothers company.  Would I travel across the city (or further) to come here, probably not.", "author": "Scott P."}

It was on my radar as a restaurant to dine at, but I had no clue where it was. We were walking around the neighborhood looking for a place to eat and found it! I was so excited. We walked in and they were able to take us right away. The restaurant was so cute and rustic. Our server was very nice and answered all my questions about the pasta and sauces and what was good on the menu. \n\nFor our meal, we shared the Heirloom Tomato on Arugula, topped with a sun dried tomato balsamic vinaigrette. It was divine. For my main course I had the Fettuccine Con Salsiccia. Oh my, it was hands down the best Pasta Dish I've ever had, better than any pasta I had while in Italy. Jon had the Gnocchi Al Funghi. Yum. It was so tender and delicious. I think when we go back I will have the Gnocchi with the Salsiccia sauce.\n\nI will definitely being going back to Venticello, and will be encouraging everyone I know to go as well.", "author": "Courtney M."}

I have been here a few times and ordered family style with friends and nothing we have tried has fallen short of incredible. From the appetizers to the desserts, this ristorante will exceed all of your expectations. The wine list is also wonderful with a wide array of choices from local to lovely Italian options with something appropriate for any price range. I would also say that this is an incredibly romantic restaurant as it is very intimate and the staff are attentive but not overly involved in your experience.

Now combine that with some great food and wine and it would be hard not to create a very romantic environment for anyone.\nMy girlfriend and I finally made it here after many friends kept telling her about it.  I loved my chicken dish with mushrooms.  It had a lot of flavors, but none too overpowering and it was also very moist and juicy.  Our service was great, as Mario recommended some good wines to go with our meals.\nThe inside is like a classy, rustic European restaurant.  Even though there were some people in suits, others like myself were in casual wear and I still felt 100% comfortable there.\nDefinitely an ideal neighborhood restaurant that is worth going to for delicious food in a cozy atmosphere with great service.", "author": "Derek H."}

I was in a really pissy mood when I got there (please see The Ambassador review), but Venticello made my bad mood go away.  It is a beautiful restaurant with high ceilings and a romantic, villa feel.  And the valet parking makes this an easy restaurant to visit in the city.  No valet, no visit.  We started with champagne and wine--only the best of course--as they have an extensive wine list.  I ordered the prawns with spicy chile sauce and the sole which came with veggies and mashed potatoes.  All of it was very good.  The portions were actually large for this type of restaurant and I could only eat about half of my entree.  I also got a birthday tiramisu which Iis probably one of the better ones I've tasted.  Excellent service.  They asked to take my coat when I got there and to me that is very classy and polite.  I have a very fond memory of Venticello and would love to come back to try more.  Minus one star because I expected better views.  I was told by many that they had amazing views, but to me it was just like looking out the window down the street.  Perhaps my standards are high because I have a view of the Golden Gate Bridge from my room.", "author": "Vanessa Z."}

All the pasta dishes are made with homemade pasta. The wait staff is experienced and very fast. They had no problems splitting plates for us and being very respectful about our unsureness about exactly what we wanted to eat and all of the different personalities at the table. The food was good, not orgasmic or an explosive experience by any means, but good, the portions were just right-no crazy servings just because it's italian food but just enough so you don't have to take home leftovers or feel yucky afterwards. Atmosphere is ok, a bit loud for being so small and romantic feeling, and the new age Kenni G stuff they had on the speakers at a loud level was annoying and left many of us at table out of the conversation. Overall, a good spot when you don't want to venture out onto the creative food landscape-safe place to eat.", "author": "Samantha J."}

A very bland \"Cesar\" salad with one sad  little pale anchovy followed.  Mediocre describes the rest of the meal.  My gnocchi were tender but the sauce had no distinguishing taste other than salt, which became saltier the more I ate - and Im not one to avoid salt.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-01-28", "description": "Venticello - the name certainly conjures up warm images of Italy and the appeal of a fine italian dining experience. It's also in a pleasant neighborhood location in Nob Hill. Unfortunately, the experience, while not bad in any respect, did not meet expectations. I had the prawns with some kind of hot sauce (not authentic Italian style methinks). We also had a pasta and pork dish. Both were pleasant enough but unexceptional. The desert menu was the usual limited stereotypical Italian Tiramasu, Panna cotta etc, with the Tiramasu being far from the best I've tasted. Come on folks - get creative. Italy has more to offer than this tired overused list. The service was formally polite but had little authentic, patron inspired distinction to it. The decor was also your typical washed wall fresco look. In the end, not much to write home about and I don't intend to return.", "author": "AntonEgo C."}

It was a tough piece of cardboard that was as difficult to cut, as it was to chew.  But what really irritated me was that it seemed the bread component was an old, cold Boboli (remember that stuff?) with raw arugula and mushrooms tossed on top and then covered with a bit of Parmesan from a vegetable peeler.  The risotto with shrimp and scallop was dry.  Think Rice-a-Roni, but this was no San Francisco treat, especially at $19.  The zabaione was a tablespoon of flat custard plopped on unripe, hard, green strawberries.  While the service wasn't bad--at least not as bad as other reviews have suffered, the food made the experience unrecoverable.  Perhaps an off night, but I really wouldn't recommend this local restaurant.  There are other, better places to go in the neighborhood.", "author": "QuodE D."}

I planned a very special evening for my husband and I to celebrate his birthday.  I chose Venticello as the restaurant because I remember it being super romantic with delicious food... my favorite thing about the whole experience was the bottle of Ridge Zinfandel we drank... which unfortunately Venticello had nothing to do with the production of my favorite part of the evening.  \nI made the reservation at least a month in advance.  I told them it was a very special night (hubby's bday) and that we definitely wanted to sit downstairs and could we possibly have a table by the window.  We arrived right on time for our 8pm dinner reservation and had to wait for over 1/2 hour to be seated.  Not only did they originally try to seat us upstairs, but the table we eventually got was butted up against a wall with no real charm.  Our waiter could have cared less about us, in fact he forgot about us!  We ordered our wine and an appetizer to start.  About 35 minutes after he lays our appetizer down he comes over as if he was \"not wanting to disturb us\" to take our dinner order (it is now close to 9:30pm).  Our dinners arrive and they are pretty tasty, but nothing spectacular.  We dine, drink and enjoy ourselves.  Yet again, our waiter forgets about us and we sit with our plates in front of us... waiting.  We finally flag our waiter down to take away our plates and we have to ASK for our check....  Blah, blah, blah, I don't feel like complaining any more.\nWhat it comes down to is - I remember Venticello being a great date spot and what it has become is a place where families and business people dine for convenience.  It is too bad, the space has serious potential.", "author": "Kimberly P."}

First, tables are 2 inches apart, NO privacy, we were practically in our neighboring party's laps. Our waiter offered us a free sample of a wine stating the bottle had already been open anyway. When he arrived w/ the bottle and I had a question about the wines flavor, he actually poured himself a sample to \"understand\" what I was saying and gave himself a taste test??  Then when we decided we liked it and would order the bottle, he didnt bring a fresh bottle but he simply left that same one which we were sampling on our table. The beet salad was dry, lacking dressing and flavor, and had a total of 3.5 shavings of a beet (we counted).\nThe risotto tiger prawns were a flavorless pile of watery mush that tasted like it came out of Rice a Roni box. The chicken marsala was really a chunk of chicken breast smothered in thickened, sour, teryaki flavored sauce that could barely pass for edible, let alone as a marsala. \nThe one positive factor was they didnt charge us for these 2 entrees.\nThe waiter was  a decent guy and we felt horrible sending the food back but at the same time we dropped well over $100 for the 2 of us (the bottle of wine was $30 of that).\nThe 2 things to recommend which we did enjoy, were the portabello risotto, and the gnocchi dish.\nLastly, the Zabionne which generally comes as a thick custard over a variety of fruit, arrived as a runny soury liquid over only strawberries and was hardly room temperature.\nOVERALL, NOT WORTH THE PRICE...Also service was to par when we arrived at 6:30 pm, but by 7:30 and on, after the dinner rush, the attention we received from our waiter was seldom if any.", "author": "Mark K."}

When we finally flagged someone down to take our order, he was professional and pleasant, but inept.  He never offered us more wine, checked on our meal, or offered dessert or coffee - just think of the $ (and tips) they missed out on!  When the busboy started clearing our plates before we were done eating (!) we asked if he could please wait, and he too was obviously angered.  Once again, no one EVER came to clear our plates.

Perched atop Nob Hill, it had a breathtaking view of the city. As soon as we walked in the host made us feel welcome and comfortable. The atmosphere inside was gorgeous and I felt as if I stepped into a Tuscan villa. The bread promptly brought to our table was extremely fresh and still warm as if straight out of the oven. I ordered the carbonara, with home-made pasta and wanted to faint it was so good! The cream sauce was rich in flavor, but not too heavy or salty. I could tell the pasta was home-made because it was so fresh and it was cooked perfectly al dente. I took a bite of my boyfriend's veal which was also delicious and tender. I finished with a strawberry cheesecake. I thought Cheesecake Factory was good but this put it to shame!!! It was beautifully decorated and presented. I took a bite of my boyfriend's pannacotta which was wonderful and beautiful as well. This one experience brought Venticello to the top of my list of Italian restaurants. My roommate who is a fierce food critic and self-proclaimed \"foody\" dipped into my left-overs and reported that even though she hates carbonara, that it was one of the best pasta dishes she had ever tasted.
