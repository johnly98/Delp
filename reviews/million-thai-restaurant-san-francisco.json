Her delivery order arrived via Caviar on Friday, May 11th a little after 12 noon. Since I was starving, she offered to share her lunch.\n\n*Vegetarian Crispy Rolls: Deep fried vegetarian egg rolls stuffed with silver noodle, black mushroom, carrot, and cabbage served with sweet and sour sauce ($7.95)\n*Pad See Ew: Stir fried flat rice noodle with egg and Chinese broccoli in sweet black soy sauce, Chicken ($10.95)\n\nI just tried the noodles. I enjoyed the chinese broccoli as I adore my veggies. It also retained a nice crunch as the broccoli was not overcooked. The noodles I found a touch too mushy. (But I tend to favor dry flat noodles.) The chicken was fine. Just your standard chicken breast pieces. I didn't try the egg rolls, but they looked tasty. I believe the order came with three (instead of just the two pictured) and she finished the whole thing. Who doesn't love egg rolls though?\n\nDecent place for Thai food. I tend to like really strong Thai flavors, so overall I found their offerings a little muted.", "author": "Elena N."}

They recommend 20 minutes, and I got there a little early, so I had to wait a couple minutes. No biggie.\n\nThe service was brisk; not unfriendly, but not super welcoming. \n\nThe food was just \"OK\" -- I wasn't blown away, but it wasn't terrible either. I ordered pad thai (I know -- how pedestrian can I be, right? But it's a good base to judge a Thai place). It was lacking the seasoning I would expect. Edible, but on the bland side. Portion size, as is the norm for pad thai, was huge.\n\nI'm going to agree with my brethren (and sistren(?))... this is a 3-star place. It's not overly priced, the food is acceptable and probably what you would expect. Bonus note: There was a chalkboard inside that looked like \"off menu\" items or specials... but they were written in Thai! So there may be some really good things waiting... I just didn't get to experience them.", "author": "Brian M."}

Since it was really cold and rainy, thai curry sounded so good, so I dragged my co-worker with me for dinner. \n\nThe place was pretty empty, so we were seated immediately. The servers were very friendly and nice, they answered all our questions with a smile and they were very prompt. They always came around for refills for our waters, overall excellent service. \n\nNow for the food: we ordered the vegetable gyoza and got 6 pieces, which was good to share for 2 people. These were really crispy and I liked the fillings. Definitely would recommend these if you're interested in sharing an appetizer and are looking for a vegetarian option.\nFor my main entree, I ordered panang curry with vegetables. I LOVED this dish. The curry was so rich in flavor and there portion was awesome. It came with a side of rice, which is really nice because many places don't include rice for dinner menu. There was a wide assortment of vegetables and overall, this meal will always be memorable. I highly recommend the panang curry if you're craving thai. \n\nMy co-worker ordered the vegetable noodle soup, which he said he really enjoyed the broth. He is vegetarian but didn't enjoy the vegetables too much (he's picky), but he liked the broth. He also ordered an entree but I don't remember what it was and he said it wasn't as memorable. I personally liked everything I tried, including his soup which actually was really nice, including the vegetables. \n\nOverall, I loved my experience at Million Thai and I regret that I do not live close enough to come here often but if I'm in this area of the city again, I will totally come back. If you have the opportunity to be in this area, then definitely check this place out! Highly recommended!", "author": "Payal P."}

Since this is located around hotels, that is probably a good thing. The thing is, it was just decent. A solid taste. Nothing for me to get excited about and I will soon forget this meal. \n\nThe restaurant is small - intimate. Lots of two-person tables and seated close to others. It get noisy at lunch.

But thy also have a lot of seafood specials for those who eat it. They have beer on draft and a small, but decent wine selection.\n\nThe food is the shining star here. Beautiful and immaculate presentation. Everything is fresh, vivid, colorful, and beautiful. The noodles are soft. but not soggy. The flavors rich and bold. I always lick my spoon clean and wish I had more!\n\nThe restaurant itself is tiny and only has about 10 tables. So I don't recommend going in a group larger than 4. I usually get lucky and find a table, but they can get busy during weekends and right in the middle of dinner rush. Also, they've been promoting a lot on Groupon, so they've been having more traffic than usual.\n\nThey're open late (like midnight I think), so I like to stop by after a late shift.\n\nThe only thing I advise against here is do NOT do takeout. I've always been disappointed in the takeout quality. Boring, bland, and lacking the perfected details they put in if you had dined in instead.", "author": "Lanie L."}

My two Bay area thai experiences had been nothing short of amazing. Million Thai being one of them.\n\nThe unassuming store front of this restaurant is directly across from the Hilton where we were having our conference. It was the convenient lunch choice. The staff was attentive and sweet. I decided on the Kao Prik Sod with Duck [and very spicy].\n\nPlenty of tantalizing scent strayed to our table as we were sitting next to the open kitchen, when I got my food, I couldn't wait to have that first bite. And wow, the duck was cooked to perfection, the skin of the duck had a layer of crispy texture, which soaked in all of the flavorful sauce while being sauteeded with thai chili and onion. The meat was extremely tender, but still maintaining the integrity of the meat texture., absolutely brilliant contrast with its crispy exterior. The flavoringly was fantastically complex and properly spicy. Did I also mention that the dish was also pleasing to the eye - with beautifully saturated colors of its ingredients.\n\nGorgeously memorable and satifying thai experience.

The only reason why I gave four stars is because of their service. It took awhile to get our order in and there wasn't even a full room. The staff isn't as observant for a small restaurant.

I wasn't disappointed! The Papaya Salad was 15$ and was huge and had an assortment of noodles chicken and other delicious sides!! With both entrees they could feed 4+!

The food was TERRIBLE and the service seemed to be nice until you realize that they are overcharging you with an angelic smile on their faces. \n\nI WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MENTION THAT THE OWNER AND THEIR FRIENDS HAVE BEEN VERBALLY HARASSING ME EVER SINCE I PUT THIS REVIEW ON YELP* \n\nI got a Groupon for this place while I was visiting SF so nothing could really go wrong since I was already saving money on the great deal they were offering, right?? Wrong.\n\nFirst I will tell you that the service was seemingly nice on the outside but actually was horrible when you understood what was happening. Second the food was really really really bad.\n\nWe got the fried pork belly, cashew chicken, and an order spring rolls.(which were forced upon me - you can read about it below if you have the will to read through it all)  The fried pork belly was inedible. The posted photos are of the entire order which was thrown away as-is. Why were they so bad you ask? They were so dry that it was actually worse than eating beef jerky or any type of jerky. The skins were left on the outside but were not cooked enough so they were like trying to eat a leather wallet. Cashew chicken was so oily and salty that it was about 20% eaten and also thrown out. I have NEVER thrown a dish out like this before in my entire life. I hate wasting food also but it just was not edible. There was orange-colored oil at the bottom of the container that was like 1cm high. I am not kidding. It was not just a little bit like any ordinary dish that may have been fried twice. It was like eating rice with oil soup and chicken chunks here and there. The spring roll was also very gross. The noodles inside were so mushy they tasted like Chef Boyardee, and the veggies were not fresh nor was the rice paper on the outside soft. The sauce it came with was way too salty and tasted like soy sauce with corn syrup mixed in with it. If you can stay away from this place, please do.  If I could I would stand in front of the place and redirect people to a better place down the street but unfortunately I don't live here so I can't save you all!! \n\nThe stuff written from here on out is my rant from what all went down to prove how horrible this place is. The employees and the whole story behind it is just still so mind boggling to me I am losing sleep over what happened and writing this review at nearly 1AM on a Sunday. If you have the will or need to read on then please do so. I won't be sad if you don't, though. No pressure :)\n\nMy Groupon deal was for $20 worth of food so I ordered two dishes and asked if any one of them came with rice since my dishes were meat dishes. They said no so I asked how much it was to get a side of rice. They said it would cost a $1.50 so I went ahead and added a side of rice. I get there to pick up my order and when I give her my credit card for the extra couple of bucks I owed, she says they don't take Discover. Then I get out my other card and she now says they don't take credit card for anything under $10. I say \"but my order was over $20 technically\" and she looks at me with angelic eyes and says \"oh sorry ...\" and just stands there and stares at me. Then I say I am sorry but I don't have cash. She then points at a nearby ATM saying it only charges a $3 fee for me to pull cash from it so I can bring it back to her that way. I say \"no thank you\" and say that I will leave the food and then she says \"ok I can take it ok ok.\"  At this point ... I am so exhausted from my day and hungry from waiting for my order for so long that I accept the \"new\" terms and give her my card to be charged under $10 on my card. Another employee shows up and says repeatedly that they don't take credit cards under $10 AGAIN. SIGH*  At this point I am so irritable that I give in and just buy a small appetizer that they suggest to me which is the cheapest for $9.  After they put the order in, I take a look at the menu and it turns out that the appetizer was $7 ... not $9!!  Folks .. this is NOT the end of it.  I finally get out of this hell hole(sorry for the language) and come to my hotel room to find that the initial dish that they said did NOT have rice actually DID come with rice.  WHAT DOES THIS MEAN??? This means folks that I did NOT have to buy the extra rice for the order, which would have not ended up being over the initial Groupon amount, which would have kept me from using my credit card, which would have not made me order another dish just to be over the $10 limit!!!!!!!!!!

The ETA comes, status still shows \"order being prepared.\" The ETA continues to be pushed back while the status remains unchanged. Finally, at the 1.5 hour mark, the restaurant cancels the order. \nThat. \nSucks.\n\nHere's the thing, if the restaurant cancels due to volume or whatever soon after I place an order, I understand. But when I've waited 1.5 hours for the food you say you're preparing, and then you cancel? Unacceptable. At 7 pm I could've changed my order and still had a normal night. But at 830 you've pushed back my meal time to 9 pm. Absolutely unacceptable. \n\nTheir food was good when it actually showed up. But it's so unreliable that we can't bring ourselves to gamble again.

Are they a chain, or did they move around a lot?  No idea, but I'm no local, so take that as you will.\n\nWe ordered one appetizer and three entrees between three adults and a toddler.  The Papaya Salad $7.00 (Shredded green papaya with tomato, green bean, ground peanuts, and dried shrimp in spicy lime dressing. Served with sliced iceberg lettuce.) wasn't my choice, but it was interesting, and not too spicy for this spice wimp.  The Pad Thai $11.95 (Stir-fried small rice noodles, shrimp, dried shrimp, egg, ground peanuts, tofu, and bean sprouts with red paprika powder and lime juice.) with chicken was my choice, but I didn't really like their version of my favorite sweet carb dish.  The Pad See Ew $9.95 (Stir-fried flat rice noodles and your choice of protein with egg and Chinese broccoli in sweet black soy sauce.) with pork was way too saucy, although it was nice of them to swap out the Chinese broccoli for the western stuff upon request.  There was also some kind of steamed vegetable with peanut sauce and rice that was okay, but a sorely less tempting vegetarian version of the Chicken Rama Garden I've loved at a restaurant in Boston.\n\nThe Thai Ice Tea $2.75, however, was good.  Service was fine.  And the kitchen was open along a counter.\n\nBefore we left, I noticed a sign posted on the wall offering their gift certificates at a 20% discount.

The curry was also delicious. The rice both times also tended to be kind of mushy, which was sad.\n\nUnfortunately, the second time I ordered from them the results were no where near as good. I ordered green curry, pad thai, and hot tea again. The green curry was ok, but the panang was definitely better (I generally prefer panang anyway). The pad thai was kind of meh. Worst of all, the \"hot\" tea was, at best, luke warm. I mean, they put it in a plastic cup (previously it had been in one of those cups you often see for coffee to-go), so it clearly couldn't have been that hot to begin with.

It is now 9:28pm.  They have updated their delivery time 3 different times, and then claimed that they tried to deliver to this address 30 minutes ago (which still would have been over an hour later than their original estimated delivery)  but that when they called my number, someone in NY answered.  Clearly the delivery driver doesn't know how to use a mobile phone.\n\nI just got off the phone with both GrubHub, and Million Thai, and they said \"15 more minutes\".   I told GrubHub to GFY & that I'll be charging back the order, and they said I will never be able to order through them again if I do that.  So *if* the delivery driver arrives with my order of thai food that sounds like it's been sitting in a car for over 2 hours, I'll still get to pay $80+ for what has essentially become well traveled leftovers.\n\nNo wonder the name Million Thai.  This business clearly wants to make a million based on poor customer service.  \n\nAnd ruin my Saturday night.\n\nThanks *ever* so much Million Thai.", "author": "January S."}

It was a date, so I wanted to take her to a fancy place. Unfortunately, Osha was closed (Christmas), and I decided to give this place a shot. \n\nAs we stolled down the block towards this restaurant, we became more and more distraught as the buildings became shittier and the streets dirtier. My stomach clenched. I thought I was about to take my girlfriend to another shitty place. How many bad dates can she handle? I cried a little inside.\n\nWhen I opened the door, the place sparkled with fancy wine glass and the waitresses greeted us with smiles. The place was sparkly and inviting, I felt like I entered a new world. We sat down, looked at the menu, and ordered.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered beef stew. I munched on her beef and slurped her soup and it was really good! What really blew me away was their Roti Prata with curry (appetizer). It was really really good Roti Prata, unlike any I've ever had. Most stores sell thin and crunchy Roti Prata, but this store's roti prata was thick, chewy, and I enjoyed my little slice of heaven.\n\nI ordered green curry with rice. How spicy (1-10)? 8. It was very spicy. These people are not afraid to put spice in your dish, so if you enjoy spicy food you will love this place. With sweat dripping down my face and mouth drooling with chilli, I looked my girlfriend and she was happy.\n\nIt was a good date, we walked out of this restaurant bloated with happiness.\n\nP.S. At the time, there was a coupon on YELP that you can buy for a discount. After the meal, we bought the coupon, showed it to the waitresses, and they knocked a hefty chunk from our receipts. It was probably one of the tastiest, cheapest date I've been on that month.", "author": "Song Z."}

Pad Thai is mostly has sour noodles; Duck fried rice is mostly just rice with duck skin without taste.  \nI thought about giving 1.5 stars (instead of 2), but thinking about they seemed to trick me to double tip plus; charging us extra tips automatically even just party of 3, that made me feel upset.", "author": "Felix C."}

Unfortunately, I ended up throwing out the shrimp pad thai.  After the third bite containing a random \"crunchy\" bit (one looked like a sliver of plastic, others must have been bones? not sure), I was quickly grossed out.  Even if there were no unidentifiable objects, the flavor was just not there--very bland, not even any lime wedges included to liven it up.  A very disappointing meal that wasn't even that cheap--considering the restaurant is a small spot mainly focusing on take out with no ambiance, I might have expected better prices.", "author": "Christine H."}

The next day we went there again, because my bf wanted some Thai food(we was around that area so we come back again). The service is ok, nothing special. The place doesn't look romantic as the picture posted on groupon website. (I saw this restaurant on groupon, it looked pretty and romantic, that's why I bought the deal). Foods are not bad, but not as I expected, and the combination fried rice had some squids get stale and smell. Then at the end, when we paid the bill, we gave 10% of tip instead of 15% as they recommended on the bill, the waitress came and asked us to change to 15%. And she insisted, we didn't want to argue nor ruin our night so we gave little more tips. I swear will never come back. That made my bf upset because that was his BD celebration. I picked the wrong restaurant to celebrate. I felt bad.", "author": "Surgery S."}

Today I went with him and didn't have high hopes because he thinks pad see ew is perfect anywhere. I got the pumpkin curry with duck. OH MY GOD. So so so so delicious. It's yellow curry mixed with pumpkin, so its very mild and creamy. I got level four heat which was the perfect amount of spice. The duck tasted so good, it was ridiculous. Even the chunks of pumpkin were just melt in your mouth butter type amazingness. Bf got pad see ew and it was a level six, which made him sweat lol. It was good, just a little bit too much...flavor...in the sauce. I don't know, he said soy sauce but I don't know the ingredients. \n\nPad see ew, pumpkin curry with duck and white rice for $25. I see why he loves it here.\n\nThere were like five workers in a small restaurant so that was a little overwhelming.
