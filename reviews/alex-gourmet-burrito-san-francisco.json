I actually opted not to finish the wet burrito (alpastor chicken) because I didn't want to waste an entire meal, so I heated up some leftovers from the work fridge instead. The food is okay, if you just want something to fill your stomach. The price is okay too, but the food is just tasteless. The red sauce for the \"wet\" part of the burrito was basically red water. Nothing wrong with the service or the atmosphere, just the food can't just be an accompaniment to Tapatio (although, some might argue differently!).", "author": "Kevin L."}

In fact, I'll just say right now that the only reason I am giving above-average marks is simply because the food's a good deal and tastes alright.  But no, do not expect anything \"gourmet\" about anything here.  Everything is average quality and cooked alright, but portions are relatively large and CHEAP, especially for a place right in the heart of downtown SF.\n\nIt's basically a mom & pop Chipotle.  Same idea, same layout, similar choices, but all hole-in-the-wall style, and CHEAPER.\n\n1. Regular Burrito, Pork $7.36:  You know they're seriously giving you the absolute best deal possible when their prices are set down to the single cent!  Unfortunately I would say the biggest mark against them would be that the meat choices were clearly all cooked hours before and not kept that fresh. The carne asada looked sad, nearing its end of life at the bottom of the container, so I skipped that and got their carnitas (oops, sorry, meant \"pork\") instead.  Also loaded up with everything, including a HUGE helping to guac.  That's right, no extra charge for guac!!!\n\nSad thing is, walking to my car my bag tore from the shear weight of their burrito!--and plop it fell onto the garage floor along with all the chips they stuffed in there.  (Oh yeah, does Chipotle give free chips?--hell no.)  Luckily the foil was wrapped like 3x over so it wasn't punctured, but was a huge pain to wrap ha ha!  Anyway, sure enough, upon getting some of that foil off I noticed the innards have burst through in a hole.  Oh well, my fault.  How was it?--well, it was stuffed full of refried beans (my choice), guac, and sour cream so pretty much a stew of heart-attack, just the way I like it!  The pork was stringy and not very flavorful, but hell, I just paid $7.36 for what would be $10+ at Chipotle which still wouldn't taste as good.  So, not too bad.  For the price, 7.5/10\n\nAgain, it's all about the bargain here and getting that silent heart attack in for the day.  Enjoy!\n\n4/5\n\n#mexican #sanfrancisco", "author": "Dean C."}

My grandparents and I stopped here for a bite to eat and the lady, the mom, who I'm guessing is the owner of the shop, had a huge attitude. I'm always down for giving people the benefit of the doubt but it was just a lot. My grandma said something to one of the male workers, who was her son. I guess he told her and she took it upon herself to approach my grandmother and say how it's wrong to talk to her employees and how she isn't allowed to talk to her employees. She also told my grandpa that he was threatening her by looking at her LOL... RIGHT? When I told her it was just his face she goes \"how am I supposed to know it's just his face?\" Are you kidding me? Lol. She threatened to call security AFTER we paid and sat down. She never did, probably because she was acting CRAZY. I'd use a lot of words for this old lady but I want people to see this. ALSO THE FOOD, is gross.

Alas, I'm currently eating a sausage breakfast burrito from Alex's.  \n\nSo let's start with the good.  No rice, no beans, no potatoes!  Awesome.  I hate cheap fillers in my burritos.  When you already have a flour tortilla why do you need to add more starches of rice and beans or potatoes to it?  I hate biting into something and feeling like I've just consumed enough carbs for a month.  And at $3.80 tax included, it's a pretty good deal.\n\nThe bad.  So apparently I made a mistake when I ordered the sausage because this stuff ain't normal sausage.  It's some sort of overcooked crumbly bacon bits or something.  Kind of gross in my opinion.

Unlike some of the reviews I'd read, the owner lady didn't assess any extra charges, but did keep calling me \"Honey,\" which was quite endearing. I got the beef super burrito and it was EXACTLY what I had wanted (and gi-normous, especially for just $6.25 after tax), so I'm a fan.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-10-19", "description": "While \"Gourmet Burrito\" definitely sounds better than \"Mediocre Burrito\" or \"Gringo Burrito,\" it's way less accurate.  I tried this place today for the first and probably last time, and there ain't nothing gourmet about it.\n\nWalking in, the space itself is sort of depressing.  There have been some half-hearted attempts at decoration, but it's just a plain, rather cramped room, with an entryway dominated by a fountain drink dispenser and a cooler full of bottled soft drinks (not a single extra-tasty glass-bottled Mexican Coke among them).  The dining room consists of a dozen or so teensy-tiny tables, hardly big enough for a single diner.  I saw three women push three tables together to try to sit as a group, and it didn't look too comfortable.\n\nYou order in front of a standard burrito counter, where they build the burrito as you walk along selecting the ingredients.  You can see through the glass to the meats and other burrito fixin's . . . but in this case, that's not really a good thing.  I was going to get refried beans, as I usually do, but after seeing how difficult it was for the server to pull the ladle through their dry-looking, congealed mass, I opted for some less questionable-looking pintos.  Then I was offered a meat choice of beef, chicken, or pork.  \"Carnitas?\" I asked, wondering if the pork was prepared that way or al pastor or what.  The lady behind the counter said \"Yes\" and I got carnitas; I'm still not sure if they do other preparations.  I made my burrito a super, and so they spooned on some runny guacamole, a glob of sour cream, and half a handful of institutional-looking cheese.  The salsa looked fresh and homemade, which was nice, but not so nice was their keeping it behind the counter.  I guess you have to pay extra if you want a side with your chips.  Lame, lame, lame.\n\nThe guy ringing up the orders was giving everybody their order to go, regardless of what was requested and despite the dining room being half-empty.  Diners kept coming back up to the counter asking for plates, which were provided without any recognition that the cashier, and not the diner, had made the error.\n\nI said \"for here\" three different times and actually got mine on a plate.  I almost wished I hadn't.  A fat foil-wrapped slab skittering from one side to the other of a plain white plate does not exactly whet the appetite.  I realize it's just a burrito joint and that it's foolish to look for too much in the way of presentation, but should the plate actually look repellent?\n\nA scoop of old chips and eight dollars later, I sat down to eat.  I expected the worst, and so I was mildly surprised to find that the burrito was, well, edible.  The carnitas was pleasantly textured and plenty salty.  Of course, the cheese was also salty, as were the beans, and the guac.  Anyway, I like salty just fine, so it was actually pretty tolerable; those with less of a hankering for sodium should be warned, though.\n\nActually, everyone should be warned.  This your ultra-basic, gringo burrito shop, gourmet in name only.  The burrito has length and girth . . . but size isn't everything.\n\nTwo stars rather than one because it's cheap for this area, and not visibly dirty.", "author": "Clay S."}

Alex made a burrito with soggy scrambled eggs, salsa, and some bacon.

I've been working a few days a week in the FiDi (For all of you who use \"acronym\" to describe an initialism, this is an actual acronym!) and have been looking for a great taqueria. I don't know about their popular breakfast burritos, but the lunchtime versions are far from gourmet. They're smallish with too high a rice to meat/beans ratio and full of mediocre ingredients and bland seasonings. The fact is that at any place in the shadow of the TransPyr (haha), you're paying more for real estate than food. I used to ply these streets in the 80s and remember a place just up the hill on Clay called Mi Burrito with killer delicious, cheap, and huge burritos. They had a heavenly barbequed beef burrito for $3.55 with all the stuffings now considered to be a super burrito, including all you can eat chips and salsa which Alex's sells for extra cost. In today's dollars, that's about $7.60 - roughly the price of Alex's burritos which are much smaller with inferior ingredients and too much rice. And since they only take cash, this almost certainly means they further pad their profits by not paying their fair share of taxes.

They charge you if you want salsa to go.  WHAT?  This morning I went in for my usual breakfast burrito.  It was pretty early in the morning.
