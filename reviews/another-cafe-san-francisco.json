I was drawn to the Yelp check-in offer of free chips or fruit with a sandwich purchase. This place is still a bit of a walk from the Powell Bart station, but it's definitely in a quieter area because of it. A lot of people here were studying when I came in, but not too much that the place was overly crowded. There were plenty of seats and outlets around, both upstairs and downstairs. The upstairs ceiling appeared very low, so I preferred the downstairs seating area.\n\nI ordered an egg and cheese sandwich and got a free bag of chips with my sandwich. The sandwich was a bit on the dry side, maybe because it was an english muffin. Despite the average-tasting food, the wifi here is very reliable and they have a public restroom, which are the 2 most important study cafe qualities. I was upset that there was a power outtage a couple hours into my studying and all the lights went off. I was impressed by how the staff handled the situation very professionally without panicking and allowed everyone to continue working. This place is also open until 10pm, which is rare for an SF coffee shop. I would definitely recommend this place for people who want to buckle down and study for a long time because they have food and all the necessities for studying.", "author": "Catherine S."}

I didn't see any urine puddles, and I'm sure people in this neighborhood are responsible pet owners, but I mean yikes!\n\nAnd the prices are a little on the outrageous side considering the food.  The food is ok.  Maybe that's too strong of a word.  I had a bagel with cream cheese, and Precious had a coffee and a breakfast sandwich, and the bill was twenty bucks.

Had the day off so came by early afternoon on a weekday. I found it to be a mixed bag. \n\nPros: \nPlenty of outlets, perfect lighting (not too bright or dark), the pastry I had was very good and reasonably priced. Love the layout of this place!\n\nCons: \nLoud and annoying music: The music was consistently loud and distracting, which was surprising since I didn't notice complaints in the few reviews I read before visiting. I wasn't nuts about their choice of music but it would have been acceptable if someone hadn't turned the volume up so loud. I was on the upper level and could barely hear my own music in my headphones. I found that atrocious.\n\nWifi issues: When I got upstairs and all set up to work, I was prepared to use my private hotspot as I typically do but when I couldn't get enough speed to stream music and surf I asked someone nearby for Another Cafe's wifi password. Thought I was good to go when my cellphone quickly connected but was dismayed when I kept getting error messages for my Fire tablet and a small laptop. I tried everything but couldn't get them to connect. I noticed that my cell's 4g connection barely had two bars so I don't know if Another Cafe is in a dead zone or if I was sitting in one in the cafe. Finally, after several frustrating tries I gave up and went back to my private hotspot. I don't recall a coffee shop where I couldn't get hooked up with either their wifi or my own hotspot to work so if the poor quality is consistent that would be a dealbreaker.\n\nGood/Neutral: I found the employees polite--neither rude nor overly friendly. They were very helpful when I was choosing my pastry. It appears they have regulars and give friendly shoutouts to them which is to be expected.\n\nSummary: Maybe Another Cafe's cons were one-off quirks, I'd like to give them another chance. Maybe I'll sit on the first floor this time and see if the wifi is better--that is if their music doesn't blast me away.", "author": "Janie J."}

This place is hit or miss depending on who is working and what music they are playing. If you are trying to have a quiet lunch, or a conversation with a friend over coffee, or even to get some work done the music can be so irritating that it's pointless to even come here. I try to sit as far away from the music as possible - and even with my noise canceling earphones can still hear it and feel the vibrating base sometimes. Coffee is okay, food is good.

It even has an array of seating, including personal-size small tables, communal tables with high stools, and an upstairs area. \n\n[THE SIDENOTE]\nI was surprised with the health inspection warning because it looks clean (and we didn't get sick, though my sample size is 2). I do think the business needs to address the issue, but until then it is just another pop-up--we all have stomach acid and immune systems.\n\n[THE VERDICT]\nNo excuses not to get work done here; you can always get another coffee, another snack, move to another spot, or look at another painting.\n\n[THE CATCH]\nEver since coming here, we can never again use the phrase another cafe because it gets confused with Another Cafe.", "author": "Edna C."}

There's a smartly designed upstairs loft area that overlooks a clean, neautrals-dominated interior. The floor to ceiling windows by the street allow for copious people-watching, but Pine and Leavenworth is in quieter Lower Nob Hill, so keeping the cafe door open doesn't have to equal noise pollution.

This place is great, and their food is delicious. \nMy friend and I wanted to find a place to rest, and we found it on Yelp. There are two floors in this cafe. Actually we were working, so we went to upstairs to hide. This was a good place to hide. People can't see who is on upstairs. When we considered what we would order,the server gave some suggests to us. Even though I asked a lot of questions, the server also had a big smile and answered all of my questions completely. Finally, I bought a turkey panini and my friend just bought an ice tea(because she is on a diet). The turkey panini was hot and delicious. It smelled so good. After my friend took a bite of my pain in, she ran immediately to cashier and ordered one. She forgot she was on a diet. \nAnother Cafe is a good place to study too. They provide free WIFI for customers, so many people take a notebook here for studying. Next time I will bring my homework and enjoy my panini here.", "author": "Boo L."}

I selected the tuna melt panini, expecting to be filled but not wowed,  I was surprised to see how large the sandwich was and even more surprised at how delicious a basic tuna melt could be.  The bread was flavored with rosemary and was both crispy and soft at the same time.  \n\nThe reason I'm not giving more stars is because I don't think this place is living up to its potential yet.  I know it's new so I will give it the benefit of a doubt, but I think they could have a few more menu items, like chips to go with the sandwiches, or maybe some sort of salad menu where they will freshly make and toss your salads.  Also, the place is clean but a bit sterile, I think some cozy seating or artwork could do the trick.  Staff is nice and the prices are good.  I haven't tried the coffee yet but Yelp tells me it's good, so I will definitely have to stop back in.

This place is similar to Cup A Joe 2 blocks down, except newer with a more modern and contemporary feel. In fact, the owner and Joe are related. The furniture, the appliances, the food, the cups, the ATM machine, and even the cutlery seems to be the same (albeit new) as Cup A Joe.\n\nThe place is great. It's spotless and clean as it just opened. It's more upscale than Cup A Joe but less upscale than Contraband Coffee. The customers seem to be all local - a mix of Art Academy students, doctors from St. Francis, residents from Nob Hill, and passersby wanting to check out the new spot. I like the local and new vibe of this place. It's clean, modern, roomy, and spotless. It's much better than the liquor store that use to be here before. Overall, a great local business that you should check out.", "author": "Pat M."}

Whoever hires for this place knows their stuff - they did a great job.\nWith two stories of seating, you can either sit on the ground floor at a bench on a stool or in the more secluded upstairs portion. Be warned, the upstairs is the spot to be, and you may find it difficult to find a spot! But if you do, get ready for an excellent experience. The windows open up to the trees on the street and give off a great atmosphere that I find excellent to write and think in.\nThe coffee, a lot of people think this is the most important part of a cafe, but I am not too picky - maybe I just don't have a very refined palate. Either way, I only get one thing at Another Cafe and that is the triple americano.

Good coffee, welcoming and studious environment, and great, comfortable space.  They serve Bicycle coffee and for the non coffee connoisseurs, such as myself, it's sufficient to get through a 3-4 hour long study session.  The sandwiches are pretty good too.\n\nDuring the week, there are always enough seats and wall outlets for all to use.  Weekends are a little tougher to squeeze yourself in, but I often am able to make it work.  If there are no available tables, I can usually ask someone to share with no problem.  Love the upstairs area--it's neither too cold nor too hot and really conducive to being productive.  Wall outlets line all sides as well.  Internet connection can be spotty at times, and maybe it's just my laptop, but this is often a good thing for me...\n\nAll of the patrons are pretty chill too.  Not too many pretentious folks or hipsters here and no one obnoxious, save for your occasional girly, airhead gossipers who won't shut up when everyone else is clearly trying do work in peace.  No one cares about your asinine first-world problems.  (If you are that type of person, please gab outside or by the windows away from people who are working intently.  Observe your surroundings and have some common courtesy.)  For this reason, I hope Another does not introduce happy hour to the cafe.  Besides, cheap, good beer and a fun social spot is 2 blocks down at Cup a Joe's.\n\nThe only thing that isn't stellar here are the employees.  Don't get me wrong, they are nice and, overall, do their job satisfactorily, but really aren't that friendly.  Except for the taller short-haired/bald Latin guy, no one else smiles or really says 'thank you.'  It'd be a nice touch to an already fantastic cafe.

These paninis are on fluffy Rosemary ciabatta bread, have high quality cheese and meats, and also use tasty, flavorful greens. The sauce combinations are top notch, and each one is hand made on the spot. Also, they're huge! It's a real dinner (or lunch, since I'm a pig and eat a lot), even without any sides. I've had several occasions where I actually stop by just to grab a sandwich for dinner before I head on my way.\n\nMy favorite panini is the turkey cranberry.  Toasted, melty perfection!\n\nNow if only they could have sides like fries or chips.

I need to FIND \"another cafe.\" ((Ha, get the irony?))\n\nOk, so I'm trying not to let the bad experience I had yesterday affect my review. If you're there for coffee, or even a coffee-bagel combo, it's an ok cafe. There's not a lot of seating and the upstairs (even though there's tables) apparently is barred from all human contact. The coffee is good, a little more expensive than Cup of Joe's (I think by like 10 or 20 cents, big whoop) BUT they take cards and cash which is more than I can say for Cup of Joe's (until they started accepting visas a week ago. Still. You snooze you lose.) \n\nHOWEVER (and that's a BIG however) I would NOT recommend going there to study. There are only two outlets in the entire building, and they are both on the same side of the wall, four feet from each other. This means that those annoying people that park themselves at cafes to study for 238432687 hours will all have gotten a table before you, and they all have no intention of moving. Also, the people there are relatively stand-offish- I understand if you're studying but a smile would be nice. There are 5 or 6 tables against the wall, and they were all taken by people at their computers for 2 and a half hours yesterday so I had to wait- yes, I'm serious- 2 and a half hours for a table. (Yes, I was that desperate that I would wait that long. The power in my house was out and I needed to do some work). When someone finally decided to leave I rushed over, snagged a table, when conveniently- my mom called me. I answered the phone and proceeded to talk to her for a few minutes (around 4 or 5, no more) and the woman next to me turns to me and says with an attitude that would put Kim Kardashian to shame- (AND I QUOTE!) \" Excuse me, do you think you're going to be done talking on the phone soon?! I'm trying to do work over here and I'm blasting my music and I can STILL hear you talking.

It's a new coffee shop that also sells the usual breakfast items (pastries, breakfast sandos), Bicycle Coffee, and sandwiches at lunch.\nThe owner is a real nice guy who is super friendly. He has done a nice job building this spot out from the old run down liquor store it used to be. Everything is clean, ample sitting space with tables (even a cool looking second level balcony that it looks like you can lounge in) and new. \nSo how's the coffee? I was pleasantly surprised. It is smooth, silky, and did not have a bitter after taste, which the owner and I both agreed sucks in coffee. I also ordered a breakfast sando (scrambled eggs and ham with a slice of American between two English muffins) that they heated up on the panini press. It was tasty, and not greasy at all. Also, I like how they have actual hot breakfast items - so many coffee places only offer junk food (donuts and pastries), so it's great to have a broader choice.\nI think he's got the right combo with his lineup and I hope he does well.

It's really convenient that they use Square and I don't need to worry about not having cash (edges them out over Cup-A-Joe down the street). They have tabels & chairs in a loft space upstairs that I really like. I definitely recommend coming here if you need to study or work.", "author": "Brittany M."}

Also, they even play pretty cool music as well. I recommend going upstairs to study and I prefer the morning/afternoon staff to the evening as well. However, don't get me wrong, everything about this place is wonderful.", "author": "Darrel H."}

The Gods have heard my cries and Another Cafe is the answer!  Great atmosphere, great coffee, nice selection of pastries, sandwiches, etc.  The space used to be a shady looking mini-mart.  Now, these guys have cleaned up real nice and it's a great place to stop in for a cup of coffee to go or chill for a bit.  Oh, and outside seating.  Done!", "author": "Fhadsljkaldsjh E."}
