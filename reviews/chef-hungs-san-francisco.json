And since we were the only non-Asians in this packed casual restaurant seating over 100 people --mostly Chinese families from grandmothers to infants, I thought I was in for a treat. Unfortunately and disappointedly, Chef Hung's fell short on so many counts. \n\nService:  painfully slow. We waited over a half hour to receive anything at our table once we ordered. \n\nFood:  potstickers so doughy and tough we only ate one of the six. Singapore noodles not bad -  the best thing we ordered. Chicken and broccoli ... broccoli was good but the chicken was tiny mystery chicken chunks that seemed to come out of a Chung King can.  Hunan Beef...eh. Very wet and soupy with tough meat and not spicy at all. \n\nAmbiance:  a bit dirty, windowless basement setting.

This place, eh, had that Friday... that?  Had that Wednesday.  That's the Chinatown lunch scene these days as new businesses mostly serve Szechuan or mala (numbing spiciness) cuisine.\n\nRemembering this place, I figured if my timing was right I'd see an attractive entree on their daily specials menu.  Not seeing anything to my liking, I opted for their famed roast pork rice plate (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=9m_pLeh7kMP_Z5H0iyzy_Q&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  Served with boiled cabbage and two white rice scoops, my four thick pork slices were generously covered with brown (actually orange color) gravy.  They were tasty though one piece has a bit of an \"old\" taste to it (as in leftover).  Since the meal came is a small bowl of complimentary soup, I was full after three slices and packed the last one home.  The waitress forgot to offer me jello for dessert until after I asked for the bill, but I was full already anyway and passed on it.\n\nThe dining room was about half full with mostly large tables of post-church or family reunion/get together diners.  There was a smattering of tourists who came as I was leaving.  This low key basement restaurant is not easily found.  With more old time businesses closing in the neighborhood, this is one of few \"Chinese American\" restaurants still in business.", "author": "Mike C."}

However, once I got to open up the container to eat it, the strong odor ended up being the iodine smell off the 2 shrimp and a bunch of cut up calamari!  The Chef who threw those ingredients into my dish must have either lost his sense of smell, or didn't care if I ever came back.\n\nIn any case, because of that, this restaurant showed me that it's not worth my time to ever go back.  The iodine smell was so strong, any normal person should have been able to smell it.\n\nAs for the other ingredients, the scallops were small, but OK, and the chicken tasted OK.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-10-31", "description": "Why am I not surprised at the poor health inspection score here? After all, you climb down a flight of worn stairs into a basement to eat here. You immediately see the familiar round tables with pink tablecloths that you see at almost every restaurant in Chinatown. Finding a table for one is always a challenge, so I was cloistered in the corner away from the big parties with a humongous menu that took a while to peruse. They basically serve everything you would expect from a Chinese restaurant including Egg Foo Young and Congee. However, I had my eye out for the one elusive dish that I am beginning to see more of in the area, steamed chicken. Hunan Homes makes a good one.\n\nBut they're often crowded with tour bus groups, so I was looking for alternatives. On the menu, I saw \"Chicken with Ginger Onion Sauce\", a half one for $8.95. Could it be? I interrogated the harried waitress who nodded her head in response to my question about whether the chicken was steamed or not. Out it came, and much to my delight, it was a heaping plate of steamed chicken doused with soy sauce, covered with shredded green onions and with minced ginger and garlic on the side (photo: http://bit.ly/1RGdRV1). It really hit the spot with the white meat not remotely dry, the dark meat quite moist and the skin not too rubbery. I was not as big a fan of their $6.95 Potstickers. No complaints about the portion as the order is a half-dozen extra large ones (photo: http://bit.ly/1Hk3sc7).\n\nHowever, I found the wrappers just way too thick and chewy for my taste. I liked the chicken enough to come back with Jamie W. a couple of months later, and in addition to my chicken dish, we ordered the $9.95 General's Chicken, which he deemed as good as the one served at Red Jade, high praise indeed for such a saucy creation (photo: http://bit.ly/1GTugoS). We also tried the $8.95 Fried Calamari, which came in a heaping pile, very hot from the fryer, and pretty tasty (photo: http://bit.ly/1NJvwuc). It wasn't too chewy though we really didn't need the little puddle of cherry sauce which is apparently de rigeur for this dish. Cleanliness may not be close to godliness at this Chinatown basement operation, but I may take my chances again with that steamed chicken when I feel a hankering.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...despite excellent steamed chicken, I do have to ding them a star for the health inspection score...and those chewy potsticker wrappers, too\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...well, it's a basement\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...actually quite nice once you get into their view\nTOTAL - 3 stars...please improve your score so I can feel secure about the quality of that steamed chicken", "author": "Ed U."}

If you did not already assume that, welcome to Chinatown!\n\nWhat makes this place special is the great food at a bargain price. I could see some of the lunch specials being sold at a food truck or similar restaurant for double the price and nearly half the portion. Most daily lunch specials come around $6.75 and comes with soup, coffee, and jello. Not only that, the food is cooked well and tastes far better than what the price might suggest.\n\nSome recommended dishes to get here include the filet of sole, beef tongue, roast pork, and ham hock lunch specials. All of them come with rice and cabbage. The beef tongue and roast pork come with a delicious thick gravy. The filet of sole comes with tar tar sauce. The ham comes on a giant bone where the meat is full of flavor. The portion sizes here are also fairly generous.", "author": "Joshua M."}

Here's what I thought about the food:\n\nTea - A little bland.\n\nSoup - I'm not sure what kind of soup it was, but it had a lot of vegetables (cabbage, mushrooms, celery, etc.) and egg.  I was worried that it would be too oily, but it was not at all.  The flavor wasn't quite strong enough, but the vegetables were cooked perfectly and tasted very fresh.\n\nChicken Salad - This was not like any chicken salad I've had before.  It was very simple - shredded lettuce, dried noodles and breaded and fried chicken.  There was a light sesame dressing the the chicken was warm and fresh.  \n\nEgg Roll - Big, not too hot, full of good pork and veggies and it didn't make my napkin translucent when I set it on there for 10 seconds.\n\nPork Fried Rice - As a heads up, I'm  not really a big fried rice guy.  It wasn't too flavorful (although, I always feel that way about fried rice), but there was a lot of pork in it.\n\nShredded Pork - This was fantastic.  It was perfectly spicy (my nose got a little runny, but I didn't start sweating).  The dish contained pork, noodles, onions, peppers and mushrooms.  It was garlic flavored and a tad sweet.  I was already really full after eating everything else, but had to finish it and dragged myself home, food-comatose.\n\nOverall, the service was good, the food was good, the portions were large and the prices was right.

Chef Hung's has changed hands since last time and some of the wait staff is also different.  Nevertheless it is still a great value for the money.  If you go there on a Sunday (try to beat the church crowd) they have amazing values for individual plates that anyone would be hard pressed to finish.  I still go there regularly with my group -- probably about 40 times since my last review.  As far as parking is concerned, there is very limited street parking in Chinatown.  If you're lucky you'll find a place in back at the Waverly Place entrance.  I have only found street parking once in over 40 years of trying.  Where I usually park is the parking garage under Portsmouth Square about three blocks away.  There's also parking under Saint Mary's square on California.  For the person with the friend that had an allergic reaction to peanuts -- don't blame it on Chef Hungs.  I would strongly encourage you to never eat Chinese food in a genuine Chinese restaurant.  If you ask the waitress if they use peanuts, of course they would say no unless it's specifically a peanut dish but the pots and pans probably come in contact with peanuts from time to time as does every single restaurant in Chinatown and 99.999% of any restaurant that serves genuine Asian fare.  That's just the way it is.  Besides, the waitress doesn't always understand what you're trying to ask.

Once upon a time, this place was called Great Wall and it was our favorite place because they had some really really good authentic dishes.  Sorry, back to the present...\n\nWe walked by few weeks ago to check out the menu and thought about coming here then decided against it.  Since then, hubby was talking to his stylist about restaurants and he said this place is pretty good.  Ok, maybe we will give it a try.\n\nThe place looks the same so it's comforting.  There are many bright colored paper with specials on the walls, like most other Chinese restaurants.  Here, they categorize them by meat so there is about 7-10 specials per meat (pork, beef, poultry, seafood...etc.).  Some dishes are just pure soul food and we tend to order them whenever we see them, they just bring back good memories although most places never cook like mom or dad.\n\nI never bothered with the regular menu and just ordered from the specials on the wall.  As usual, I wanted much more than we can have and the waitress stopped me when I ordered 4 dishes.  Unfortunately, one item was out so I only ended up with 3 but it was more than enough as the portion is very generous.\n\nWhat we ordered:\nbean sprout (the large one) with pig intestine - they didn't have the ingredients but the waitress didn't tell me until I asked her.  she then insisted the 3 orders are more than enough for the two of us - fine.\n\nblack bean chicken - this was a favorite from the old place, if cooked right it is the BEST.  They did ok, it was tasty but a bit oily.  Also, it was a mix of various parts of chicken and the way they had it chopped/cut made some pieces to be a mystery.  \n\nFried tofu, bean curd, garlic, mushroom and cod filet - we were first amazed by the portion but that was short lived.  It was very bland.  The bean curd was not fried like we are used to and how most other restaurants do it.  The batter on the cod was too thick and the fish was not so good.  This is the first time we didn't like this dish enough to finish it or take home.\n\nStir fried preserved turnips with pork belly - again, big portion and it was not bad.  They must have soaked the preserved turnip for a long time because it was not very flavorful.  The sliced pork belly was not bad.\n\nWe were given their house soup (arrow root) to start and ended with dessert, red bean soup with tapioca.  \n\nThe waitress wasn't very friendly and a bit blunt.  The guy there, owner or son or owner?, was nice.  Thanks to him, we moved to the far end table \naway from their regular who has a very very very strong body odor.  Had we not moved early on, I don't think I could have stayed to eat anything.\n\nThis appears to be a regular place for a lot of first generation Chinese American.", "author": "Gloria H."}

We ordered from the  fixed priced Chinese family style menu. There is large  portions of the eight dishes and the food arrived fast and hot.. Don't expect ambiance, kinda of noisy, well, Chinese family style.  It was satisfactory, not outstanding. We would probably come again since we haven't found another place that we liked that has the family dinner menu. Good for non-Asians willing to try new food besides the wonton soup, chow mein and fried rice fare. The Chinese family menu has the English translation with it. PS. It is named \"NEW\" Chef Hungs, a new owner has taken over since September 1st.", "author": "Gerry P."}

Their seafood congee is good (add a lil soy sauce for taste)., chicken salted fish fried rice, seafood crispy noodle, red bean soup, and potstickers are good. We usually get around the same things...have not ventured out more of their huge menu.  service is cool, amibance is like any chinatown restaurant..price is pretty cheap. it's hard to find a good restaurant in chinatown, coz there's so many options! It fulfills our chinese food appetite when we're around chinatown. Oh yeah, $15 minimum for credit cards, FYI.", "author": "Janet W."}
