Their chicken was so over cooked it tasted like it was dehydrated with tons of sweet n sour sauce on it. So gross. The chefs special is a joke honestly. Oxtail was rubbery and the sweet smell of it just didn't sit right with me. Crab puffs were way overfilled for their size but had no real cream cheese in them which negated the amount of imitation crab used.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-09-05", "description": "The most underwhelming food that I have had lately.\n\nI got Kung Pao Meatless Chicken. I assumed it was some sort of Chicken substitute but what it actually is turns out to be giant chunks of soggy fried tofu floating around in a lot of oil with some vegetables. It's supposed to be spicy, it's not; it's just greasy. It was way too greasy (leaking everywhere with still an inch inside the container) and I don't mind some grease, either.\n\nI asked them to make the Pineapple Fried Rice vegetarian by substitute egg for chicken. While they were nice enough to do this what I got was a oversize serving of greasy rice with some egg and 8 small pieces of pineapple mixed in. It had virtually no flavour aside from the pineapple. There was also absolutely no vegetables in it. It's one of the few times when I genuinely wish I'd invested the effort to cook at home.\n\nBasically, if you don't eat meat this is an extremely disappointing meal. It's not the worst thing on the planet but in a city with so much good, cheap food it is overpriced for what you get and feels like a let down. It feels like they feel they have to do huge portions rather than good food. It's not horrible but in a city with so much food it's not very competitive unless you're just looking for a place that serves medium to large portions and don't care much for flavour. It's not horrible, just incredibly bland and sometimes too greasy.", "author": "A J."}

Since the roommate wasn't super hungry and didn't care where we ordered from, I picked Wok Station. Placed our dinner delivery order on Tuesday, July 4th at 7:07pm through Eat24. It arrived at 7:33pm. We live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings (6 Pcs): Fried chicken wing with salt and pepper ($6.75)\n*Lemon Chicken: sauce on side ($8.75)\n*House Special Fried Rice: no carrots ($10.75)\n*Free Spring Rolls with order of $25 or more before tax: (3 Pcs) Fried spring rolls with mixed vegetable only (normally $4.75)\n\nThe fried rice fulfilled the craving, but it didn't have much stuff in it. I expected peas and more meat. It was fried nicely, but a little bland. Nothing some hot chili oil couldn't fix. The chicken wings were also nicely fried, but they were a little too salty with not much peppery flavor. We joked they should be called just salt wings. I'm not a big lemon chicken fan, but the roommate basically ordered it with the sauce on the side so he could eat it with tonkatsu sauce. Kind of like pieces of chicken karaage. The free egg rolls were standard. I normally have meat egg rolls, but these were veggie. At least they were free.\n\nDecent Chinese delivery spot. (Though they did forget to include hot sauce when I made a note for extra hot sauce to be included in our order.) Not the best Chinese food around, but I'm glad I checked out a new spot.", "author": "Elena N."}

Egg roll was nice and crispy, although the vegetable filling was a little boring and bland. I enjoyed the Spicy Tofu, just the right amount of heat and perfectly with rice. There were only a few pieces of pork, which didn't bother me since I was more craving tofu, but might be disappointing for others.\n\nVeggie Chow Mein had tons of vegetables which is great, but it was quite bland. It desperately needed more salt and flavors. The veggies taste like they were boiled or steamed, and then tossed in the noodles last minute for a quick mix. I was pigging out and started eating the noodles after I inhaled the tofu. But I just couldn't eat more than two bites of this. Luckily, I feel like this is something I could easily fix with a hot wok and some salt/sauce in my own kitchen so the food won't go to waste.

Their lunch combo of soup, 2 items, and rice for $5 is an incredible deal, and it's on par with most of the hole-in-the-wall bakeries in this area - except that the interior is super nice (it was obviously renovated just before they opened).\n\nThe owner, Mike, was incredibly excited, engaging, and happy to have his new business off the ground. He gave all of us a lot of nice freebies, including egg rolls and soup refills. He also gave us the lunch special deal on dinner items. Kudos to him for making my visit an awesome one.\n\nOf course, the defining feature of restaurants, at least to me, is the quantity of food * awesomeness of the food / price. How did they stack up? Really well! As mentioned above, the prices were great. I got a mongolian beef, and it's one of the best I've had - especially noteworthy since it came from a fast-service style restaurant (instead of a sit-down restaurant). \n\nAnother defining features is that the service at lunch time should be super speedy since it's counter-service from a steam tray. They offer delivery throughout sunset, too. The inside isn't huge, but the neighborhood has a couple parks that aren't too far away if that becomes an issue. \n\nAll in all, this is a very welcome addition to the neighborhood from some really friendly folks.

I'm really not sure how they have a 4-star rating, as this was some of the most disappointing Chinese food I've had. I ordered the Cashew Nut with Chicken, which was described as being made with chicken breast, but it came with all pieces of dark meat and peanuts instead of cashews. Cashew chicken with no cashews?? The pork fried rice was really bland, and mainly had pieces of fat instead of meat. I called the restaurant, and the woman I spoke with was very kind - she spoke with the manager and said they would credit our entire order. In the end, I received credit for one entree and the hot and sour soup (which was actually good). However, I won't be ordering from here again based on the overall food quality and flavor.", "author": "Alicia A."}

None of our dishes called for egg, but there were hard pieces of broken egg shell throughout my dish.  My wife got the sweet and sour chicken and got four fried chicken nuggets next to some bell pepper and onion in the sauce.  Chicken was dry and not fried entirely.  Sauce wasn't the worst, but overall not a good experience.   Food was way over salted and and nothing stood out.  Best part were the egg rolls, but only by comparison.

The guy bought me the food was spilled all over the bag on the bottom, I asked him why ? He told me that he got it from the restaurant just liked that. I have nothing to say . I would not order anymore from them . I asked menu ,forks and they didn't have for me. Bad customer service and took to long for delivery.", "author": "Lili L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-06-30", "description": "i order scramble egg, shrimp rice noodle.  it's  a very typical Cantonese dish, but i didn't like theirs.  some parts of the rice noodle were still cold, i can't  believe it.  the chef needs to improve his stir fry technique.    and it's not that cheap, came out 11dollars.  i got the 2 free chicken wings, tastless.  the chairs were not comfortable at all, need some cushions.  this is a good location, but turnover rate is high.  don't know why,  maybe there's no quality in all the food.", "author": "Lucy J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-05", "description": "Ordered for delivery through Yelp.  Very quick response.  Good food but...  Mongolian Lamb, medium spicy, tasted good but was a little too oily.  Bonus spring rolls were also kind of greasy.  Also got a complimentary little appetizer of pepper and salt fried chicken wings. Nice and crispy but the bones weren't cooked all the way through. Prawns with crispy walnuts was tops. Some reviews compared this to Panda Express.  There is no comparison.  Wok station is much superior and much more authenti. All in all everything is very tasty but some dishes need a little fine tuning.", "author": "Enoch A."}

Sesame chicken was 90% flour and 10% chicken. Tastes like shit. Salt and pepper chicken wings were soggy af. Will never order from here again.", "author": "Martin C."}

Everyone like it, food got there in about 20 min, deliver was on time and friendly, food was fresh and tasty. And can't beat the price too. Will definitely do it again, especially on a poker or mahjong night.", "author": "Hody L."}

I usually get food to go, and everything has been great for its price so far! My favorites include the salt and pepper chicken wings, salted fish and chicken fried rice, and sesame chicken. Whenever I place a phone order, it only takes under 15 minutes.", "author": "Xing L."}
