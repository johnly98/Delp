I actually went straight for the broth-- without the noodles, it was a bit salty, as was to be expected. It was not the lightest broth I had, but left me feeling satiated. The green onions in it had been there for a bit, as they were somewhat waterlogged. This one lacked some of the complexity of flavor I've had in other broths (the lemongrass, different layers, etc.) but I understand pho is not their main focus. 3.25/5.\n\nOnce in a while, you rediscover chicken that is just so juicy and delicious that it's hard to put down. This five spice chicken is exactly that. Crispy on the outside (with skin!), moist on the inside, and in generous portions. I'll definitely be back for this. 4/5.\n\nGarlic noodles weren't omg amazing, but I can understand the appeal of buttery, aromatic carbs. There were real little garlic bits on this too. It's the sort of food you eat when you want a pick me up and can't bring yourself to eat healthy. 3.5/5.\n\nEchoing the large portions that other have pointed out. Even though the name threw me off a bit since it's not traditionally...Vietnamese(?), I would come back for that chicken. 3.5/5.", "author": "Nicole H."}

At least the name does.\n\nBut when you walk in it is not really, especially along the lengthy Haight Street corridor where majority of the businesess are casual and laid back. There are also some good restaurants and businesses too. Alnd you thought that Haight/Ashbury is all about the Summer of Love. \"Rock on, dude!\"\n\nThis Vietnamese restaurant is operated by Cantonese speaking people. And these cats can make some good authentic Vietnamese dishes. \n\nI was here for an early dinner with the restaurant being quiet. You place your order through the cashier. Looking at the extensive menu posted on the wall and behind the cashier and right below the kitchen, every dish looked and sounds so good. After a lengthy self-debate, I ordered the Five-spiced chicken over garlic noodles. For $12.50, the chicken was marinaded and spiced with five different kind of spices. The chicken was moist, grilled very nicely and not overly burnt. I had garlic noodles from many restaurants, but this restaurant's version was very subtle with a perfect of garlic. The pasta was also cooked al' dente style, which I liked and strongly preferred in my pasta dishes. \n\nThe restaurant also served bottled beers. I also added San Francisco's own Anchor Steam's \"Go West\" IPA for $6.00. This is a really good brew with my meal.\n\nTake outs, meal pick-ups and deliveries are also available and very popular with various ride-services doing deliveries. \n\nDespite the median rating, I really had a blast here.

I had just eaten at the Mission location last week and was craving more garlic noodles and beef after work. However, the Mission St. location closes at 3 pm. Huge bummer because it's in a great, convenient location. \n\nAnyways, decided to go to the Haight location because I'd been there before and hoped that the food would taste similar-ish. Boy was I wrong. Not sure if management has changed or if the food had been sitting around for a long time but the food was straight up cold. Not even warm. AND the portion of meat was much less than the other location. The garlic noodles were barely flavored and the meat was not flavorful (as it's supposed to be). :( paid $15 and spent 20 minutes driving for meager portions and bland food.

There's nothing imperial about them. They literally taste like ass. They're still on my desk, and looking at them makes me angry and vaguely nauseated.\n\nGarlic Noodle with Chicken and Broccoli: the chicken is reasonably tender and nicely crispy on the outside, but that's not a sufficiently redeeming quality. The noodles are carelessly half-fried, greasy, and taste of cheap imitation garlic, reminding of the perennial disappointment when ordering \"garlic fries\" only to be given fries that were obviously prepared with zero garlic whatsoever. The plastic garbage container in which this meal was delivered also contained three pieces of steamed broccoli, which I had to resign myself to.\n\nIt is severely disappointing to order takeout and to have to let go 90% of the meal because it is totally inedible.

Spring rolls were great! Wrapped in rice paper, cut in half with same as the veggie dish but more slivers of tofu and bean curd.\n\nNot bad, tasty food, good service.

It's really excellent, but that place is in the West Village in NYC and doesn't have anything to do with this place so who cares? No, the only thing in common is the name, and this Perilla is related to the two other locations on Irving Street in the Inner Sunset and on Mission near 2nd. It's the Mission Street location that has provoked me to have a long-running hankering for Five-Spice Chicken with Garlic Noodles, but the problem is that it's only open until 3PM.\n\nMy hankerings usually occur after work, so that was a perennial bummer until I discovered that this Perilla is open for dinner until 9PM. Got it so far? Anyway, the best part is that it's an easy 6 or 7 MUNI ride away from Downtown. It's in that convenient hub of eateries in the Lower Haight where Wonderland, Taqueria Estrella, Cafe International and now Stone House are. When I first walked in, the place looked somehow incomplete as if they were still waiting for their Cost Plus home decor shipment. But the menu was complete, and like the Mission Street location, you go up and order at the front counter.\n\nIt's probably not a shocker that I ordered the $11 Five-Spice Chicken and Garlic and Butter Infused Noodles (photo: http://bit.ly/1KF7Ra4). How exactly do you infuse butter into a noodle? Is there a woman back there with a hypodermic needle and steady hand giving each strand a shot? Well, whatever they do, it's worth it because the thick buttery noodles draw me back to Perilla time and again. So does the chicken which never fails to be plump and juicy with the right amount of crisp on the skin. The broccoli always tastes like an afterthought but it doesn't matter because I can have this dish for dinner now. It'a all about me.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...they infuse butter into their noodles and plump up their chicken...delish\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...kinda bare bones but who cares?\nSERVICE - 4 stars...you can tell they pay attention to their customers here\nTOTAL - 4 stars...it's what's for dinner", "author": "Ed U."}

Ownership provides a friendly service in this hip Vietnamese restaurant. I highly recommend the five-spice chicken or pork chop with any order, but you can't go wrong with any entree. Garlic noodles were full of flavor and very delicious. Portion size was perfect for our group of 4, as were able to share all dishes generously. The Imperial Rolls are a must for appetizers! Large selection of Ballast Point, too.\n\nPerilla isn't open for lunch, so you'll have to come for dinner only. Parking might be hard to find, since most are hourly or meter parking, but isn't hard to find if you don't mind a walk of a few blocks. This place is great for catering and I believe you can order from here on several apps. Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!", "author": "Joshua H."}

They ran out of veggie vermicelli and instead gave us 2 chicken vermicellis (sorry for not picking up the phone!)\n\nI honestly really enjoyed the vermicelli, which was simple enough with salad, a huge bed of noodles, with juicy pieces of chicken on top.

They serve a variety of different things, many of which you can find at other Vietnamese restaurants (rice plates, vermicelli bowls, rolls). But I come for the garlic noodles. Fun fact: garlic noodles are purportedly a San Francisco dish, originating from Thanh Long and Crustacean in the Sunset.\n\nIf you've never had Garlic Noodles before, I'm not sure how to describe it other than garlicy, buttery, and carby. I love them and know many others who love them as well. But I know just as many people who don't like them and find them bland and boring. I have never known a dish to be so polarizing! But my vote is for 'yummy', and I normally get them with the moist and flavorful Five Spice Chicken. But the pork is also a winner (never had it with beef, so can't comment on that end).\n\nThe prices are a bit higher than the Perilla Sunset prices, but I think on par with the Perilla Financial District prices. It does take quite a bit longer for the food to come out as well, versus the other two locations.\n\nI really really wish they were open at lunchtime. Originally they did serve lunch, but apparently business was too slow and it wasn't worth it. They used to serve Banh Mi at lunch, which quickly went from $5, to $7 with a drink. It was a solid Banh Mi that took forever to make and was expensive (Dinosaurs prices!). I don't even know why I mention this, as it isn't on the menu anymore.\n\nI would recommend for anyone who likes a heavier (and yes, greasier) Asian option. It has slower service and a pricier menu than you'd get in the Sunset. But I live here and not the Sunset, so I'm more than happy to pay extra for a closer place to get my garlic noodle fix.", "author": "Trish B."}

I loved the soup, which was super flavorful and filling. They give a ton of noodles - I wish they gave more soup to match haha. But the chicken, potato, and noodles were all cooked really well! I opted for the wider noodles, but you can get thinner rice noodles as well.\n\nMy bf and I also loved the five spice chicken - it's pan-fried, I think, so it was moist but crispy on the outside. The garlic noodles were a little dry for my taste, and the broccoli was a bit undercooked, but overall I'd def get either of these dishes again.\n\nValue (3/5): It's not that much food for $12+ haha, I think a fairer price would be $9. The soup is filling since they give you a ton of noodles, but I don't think either of us would've been full just with the garlic noodle dish.", "author": "Abby S."}

I wouldn't give this place any stars, but since it's not possible I had to give them one star.\n\nWhen you first walk in they tell you to sit down anywhere you'd like then hand you a menu. Then they tell you to go to the front to order your food. We ordered chicken pho, beef pho, & a prawn vermicelli. We also ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee which was not your traditional Viet coffee. It was weak watered down coffee. All of the pho is made with a bland chicken broth. The \"beef pho\" was more like chicken pho with a side of barbecue beef, and did not taste good together. The beef was really salty, and no matter what, nothing seemed to make the broth taste better. The chicken pho was not seasoned properly and the chicken was dry. The vermicelli the best out the three dishes we had but still wasn't good. \n\nOverall, it was a bad experience and a waste of money. I will not be coming back here.

The furniture quality, lighting, and ordering at the counter make the ambiance mediocre. It feels a bit like a diner, and sure enough there was someone at a table working on their laptop. Maybe Perilla's lease is expensive, but I remember Tin in SOMA costs less, has nicer interior design, and full table service. That said, with this new Vietnamese spot and Iza Ramen coming soon, it's lovely to have variety from the status quo of Thai, Indian, and Sushi that has encompassed the neighborhood.\n\nThe prices are what stick for me to think twice before I go back. My beloved Lower Haight has more and more restaurants making lame sit-down attempts to justify high prices, while there are fewer places I can get an affordable meal to-go.

Needless to say, I was particularily stoked for it - happy to see a solid Vietnamese restaurant open relatively late (10pm everyday) only a few blocks from me. The reason I'm giving it four stars is because I think they still have a bit of organizing to do - my order was lost for a second and took a tad longer to get to me (30 minutes during low traffic hour) and I got up to refill my water while eating only to find one of the bussers thinking I was done with my over half full bowl and taking it back to the kitchen. Luckily, I caught her in time to let her know I was just filling up my water and will happily finish my food still. Even with those mishaps, everyone that worked there was so kind and smiling, the owner even came and asked me if I was enjoying the food. I think as they get more used to running their restaurant, it'll run more smoothly.\n\nONTO THE FOOD YAAASSSS. I ordered the Spicy Curry Chicken Noodle Soup. It looked aesthetically pleasing to say the least. The potatoes were perfectly cooked addition to the fall apart chicken and slightly creamy broth. With just a sprinkle of sriracha it became the perfect level of spice for me. At that point, restraining myself was a lost cause, and I managed to finish the entire bowl relatively quickly. A privilege for my tastebuds, a well worth it torture for my digestive system. I was extremely full, regretting I ate so fast, and yet overly content with the taste.\n\nIt was dinner, and I'd happily come back to call it such again here.

The family who owns the place is super friendly and helpful.  They answered all our questions with patience and a smile. My kids were so excited that this restaurant is in their neighborhood.  THey asked if we could write a review so that other people will try it and it will stay in business!  We are going out to dinner there tonight and my kids have been looking forward to it all day.  They keep saying they can't wait for garlic noodles.  I am looking forward to it too.  It is a casual and yummy place to eat with good service.", "author": "Jennifer P."}
