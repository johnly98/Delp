I've gone there twice now, and have only ordered from their steam table.  Food is fairly inexpensive ($9.75, tax included, for one item), appears very fresh (at noon), and service is extremely fast and friendly.  At 1.5 blocks from my office, the food is not as \"whitewashed\" as you might think, and a decent alternative to Chinatown.

It's the best stir fried (not deep fried) chicken you can get, and it has noodle in it so yep it can fill you up.\n2. Special pho: well you don't go wrong with pho. This is one of the dishes that's hard to screw up, just like Korean BBQ beef...\n3. Vege noodle soup.

Felt like something fast, filling, cheap, and maybe a tad unhealthy, so I figured Chinese food would fit that bill perfectly. And being that it was about 5 blocks away from the office, gave me a nice little jog to enjoy the fresh air before going back to work. Browsing through Yelp, I saw that 77 Chinese & Hawaii BBQ was nearby, and allowed online orders (saving me a wait in line when I arrived). \n\nWhen I first arrived here, I had a bit of trouble finding this little shop as I literally walked right by it without noticing it was even there. Had to pull up my Yelp app, and use the map to realize I walked a bit too far down Battery. Upon entering, instead of getting into their assembly style line, I saw that they had a \"Order here\" sign on the registers. Figuring that since I placed an online order (and paid for online), and that there was a sign at the counter, that I could logically skip the wait and go straight to the counters. While I still don't know if I followed the appropriate procedure, what I do know was that my wait at the counters was followed by about 5mins of awkwardness as the cashier proceeded to ignore me and avoid eye contact as she continued to ring up people coming from the other side of the line. Eventually, she turned around to one of her coworkers behind her, gestured at me and made some comment that I couldn't understand, and walked away. It was then and only then that anyone even bothered to come up and ask how they could help me. \n\nService aside, I was also really disappointed by the food. Perhaps I should have ordered something different, but the Beef Chow Mein I ordered tasted rather rubbery, lacked any real flavor depth, and was extremely greasy. \n\nWith all of the food options in FiDi, I think (aka I know) I will be skipping this place from now on.", "author": "Alex C."}

I got the chicken fried rice and it was great, it's the kind that (seems to me to be) more authentic and lighter in flavor, the rice appears white and there are few items mixed in, this is my preference with fried rice.  I got a one item and ordered the string bean chicken.  It was made with garlic black bean sauce and white meat chicken.  I really liked it, although it would have been better had the strings been removed from the beans.

Verify before you order, vegetarians.\n\n\nTips:\n- If you're ordering an item \"to order,\" call or Eat24 and place your order so you don't have to stand around for 5-15 mins waiting for it.\n- You can get steam table items without rice/noodles, if you want.

It's kind of a comfort food for me, as Filipinos have a similar dish called arroz caldo/lugaw. \n\nIt's a great sized meal for $7.45, and I would definitely come back to order it again.

The usual run of the mill chinese options. Haven't tried much else. You can ask for brown rice too.

I once needed noodle soup for lunch and came here to order their won ton mein. That satisfied my craving and tasted like almost all other Chinese BBQ type places that serve won ton mein. The next time I came back was because I really wanted jook, it was a foggy 55 degrees outside, and it was close to my office. I placed an order for jook w/chicken but specifically asked if the chicken was shredded (they confirmed it was), so I ordered a shredded chicken jook with NO ginger. The girl at the counter repeated my order back to me and asked if it was ok to add onions, which I said was ok. She repeated my order again: jook with shredded chicken and onions, but no ginger. YES! After returning to my desk, I noticed my jook was made with the same chicken they use for most other dishes here. That would be fine except that it's the stir-fry kind of chicken. Needless to say, it was NOT shredded. Also, they cut their ginger in strands and they were found throughout my jook. I took a fork and fished as many strands as I could out. Typically, I wouldn't really care that it came this way but she told me otherwise. Also, if I was allergic, I'd be pretty upset that my order came exactly how I asked for it NOT to. The jook itself tasted fine with a little salt added, but I was disappointed with the chicken and ginger. \n\nMy coworker, a regular here, went to order his food right after I returned to the office and he told me he mentioned this error to them. The girl at the counter told him she doesn't remember anyone ordering jook that day.

You can order select items that the kitchen will cook up fresh or you can order from the steam table. \n\nI mostly order the 3 item plus rice to go from the steam table for $8. The steam table  has over 10 different dishes ranging from vegetarian (tofu and vegetables) to meat heavy (Peking spare ribs) and mixed in between (broccoli beef).\n\nIt's fast, convenient and filling. They give you a lot of food in the to-go containers. So much that I usually split the meal into two and save the other portion or my lunch the next day.", "author": "Christine T."}

The gravy wasn't too salty, the eggs were fried just right (slightly runny), and the 2 hamburger patties were not dry at all.
