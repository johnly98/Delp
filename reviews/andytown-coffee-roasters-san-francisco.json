The little bit of brown sugar syrup was just sweet enough to cut the bitterness of the espresso but not so much that I couldn't enjoy the strong aroma of the Andytown roast. The homemade whipped cream was also really, really good! I'm not even usually a fan of whipped cream, and typically order my drinks without it, but I loved the texture of theirs! I think I will be requesting it in all of my future drinks, even if it isn't included. :9\n\nI had the cheddar bacon scone for breakfast, which was quite tasty, but pricey for what it was. I think the next time I visit, it will just be for the coffee. I'm excited to bring my coffee-loving friends here though!\n\nIn terms of the cafe itself, it is pretty tiny with one larger communal table and a few counter seats.

Do not despair, as the line moves pretty quick due to their employees always having a tight grip on their efficiency :) \n\nThey have a fairly limited menu, but they are great at what they do, so you really can't go wrong with any of their choices. While I have not tried their signature drink (the snowy plover), I can attest to their mochas and lattes. \n\nAbout 90% of the times that I've gone to Andytown, I've gotten a mocha. The chocolate that they use for their mocha is amazing- it has just the right amount of sweetness and richness without being overly indulgent. Their lattes are also amazing, you can really taste the quality of the beans that they use.\n\nJust a little side note- Andytown is NOT a place in which you will be able to do work. While they do have free wi-fi, there isn't very much space to plop yourself there for hours on end. However, the location is amazing- right by Sunset Beach. Would definitely recommend a stroll on over there once you have your caffeine and pastries :)", "author": "Elizabeth M."}

Only then did it snap into my head that this was one of those tonic/espresso dealies some of the cafes are concocting in DTSJ. \n\nIt was tolerable. Still an acquired taste. I took the advice of a friend on this page and mixed it right before driving up to Lands End this morning and it got me going to and fro the 1.7 mi trail and extra.\n\nDouble Shotty Menu's good, pastry spread is better; but can I take some time to just talk about their detail in Florals?? Kind of the last place to find some hope'spiration next to Ocean Beach but I couldn't resist sitting next to a potted violet after ordering to-go.\n\nTake a gander at their business photos: Succulents, mini-bouquets of Exotics, even Baby's Breath makes an appearance (I know because I watch a lot of Megan Batoon on YouTube). Not to mention my growing obsession for fleur tattoos on Instagram. \n\n***Whomever takes the time to arrange these settings: Effing Kudos and a BRAVO to you. Nothing gets past your Eye here and they're appreciated =)\n\nFor everything else, definitely little space for laptops and business chatter and I Love it.

Weird right? It's such a strange combination that you wouldn't think it would go together, let alone like it, but trust me, it is absolutely delicious! Their whipped cream mixed into the drink gives it the creaminess and texture that makes it even more addictive! Their cheddar scones ($3) are also amazing. Fluffy, cheesy, and absolutely fresh! The aroma of their coffee and pastries as soon as you walk in is so inviting. You can definitely see and taste how locally fresh they are. In addition, the location, atmosphere, decor, and aesthetics of this place is beautiful. It's very instagram worthy, no filters needed. \n\nTheir staff are also super nice and friendly! You will always get a warm welcome each time you come in, even when they're busy! The owners of Andytown are also there most of the time, which definitely gives Andytown a chill vibe which in turn creates a sense of community.\n\nFrom their fresh food/drinks, great atmosphere and staff, you know you're getting a 5 star quality experience at Andytown.

I love that they have a great tea selection that isn't what everyone else carries. I especially like that they have fresh ginger tea. If You like sweet things, their snowy plover is super tasty and one of a kind. I have traveled all over for coffee and they were the only place that had something like this, although a lot of coffee shops have something similar now, but they did it first and their house made whip is so good! Their latte art is always gorgeous and they have the BEST cups. I wish ceramics wasn't so expensive and I wish they sold their cups in the store. \nOhhh. Also, for your fur parents out there. They always have dog treats and a water bowl for the pups. Plus they have a good amount of outdoor seating for our lovely fur children. They are obviously amazing because they opened up two more locations and all are equally as great. Additionally, super random, but they always have the prettiest/cutest flower arrangements. \nThe only negative is their coffee bags are on the pricier end but all in all, I love this place.", "author": "Jenny T."}

Interesting mix to say the least - it tasted like a carbonated coffee warmed on a hot day. Imagine drinking from a warm water bottle left in your car! Not bad, but not good either. This drink might be an acquired taste because I was not feeling it.\n\nThe coffee shop itself is very small and cozy. There's minimal seating inside and outside, but the really great thing about this place is that it's really pet-friendly, so I often see lots of dogs outside.

Less caffeine too per the worker. \n- The sweet corn muffins are a must order if you are already trekking out here to get the coffee. They are so delicious and hefty in size. The flavors rotate based on the seasonal fruit and I haven't been disappointed since and don't anticipate I will. Perfect amount of moist, fruit bits incorporated, and crunch from the top!\n- They have limited seating inside with small tables, good for one or two people max. More tables and seats outside, but it's normally cold and packed. \n\nImprovements\n- Seasonal Snowy Plover (?): Peppermint snowy plover topped with a mini candy cane. I didn't feel this one, tasted very much like a peppermint mocha but not as good. Stick with the original Snowy Plover or Matcha and you won't regret it. \n\nTips\n- Neighborhood street parking. \n- Dog friendly outdoor seating and they have a bowl of treats for dogs too!\n- I tried another shop that served Andytown coffee and their plovers, but it's just not the same.

Its an odd combination and one might not find appealing based on the ingredients, however, don't knock it until you give it a try. If this drink isn't to your liking, one of their coffee menu items will be up your alley. \n\nThe staff is warm, friendly, personable - which is nice for a newbie.

It was described to me as essentially being sparkling water with espresso and whipped cream on top. Sounds odd, right? I definitely thought so! From her description, it sounded like a sparkling americano or something. But the more I sipped on it, the more I enjoyed it! The whipped cream on top isn't just your ordinary whipped cream either.

It's a really nice place inside and outside! The only downside is that there's not much indoor seating. There's 4-5 tables outside, and some bench seating around the front of the place, but inside is just one long bench. \n\nAnother thing, the line is also pretty long sometimes. Around 9-10am on Sunday mornings, it's sooo crowded. I usually come after church around 1pm and the line dies down. \n\nThere's also another location on taraval!

Ok, maybe Holy Grail is a little much since I haven't tasted all the coffee in the world and I hear Singapore is repping strong, but it's pretty frigging good!!!\n\nI'm still a little baffled and lost for words. This cortado was freaking amazing! Completely and perfectly amazing! Incredible depth of flavor, incredible color, amazing texture and mouth feel and just as importantly, perfect temperature! It was a caffeinated, mouth-gasm! \n\nI'll put it to you this way! Having this cortado is comparable to having been with a truly amazing lover. One that came in your life, broadened your horizons, created a deep and completely immersive experience and then left you just as quickly as they came, leaving you in a deep crater of emotional baggage, slightly confused how to proceed now that you've tasted the best.

I'm going to keep searching for really good coffee and comparing it to Andytown's and a couple of other places that have given me really good coffee. But, as for advice on what to do about that elusive lover, send me a message, we'll meet at Andytown's and talk about it. Over an amazing cortado or apparently the Snowy Plover that everyone else raves about. I didn't try that; maybe tomorrow. \n\nOh, and yeah, it's a small space with very few places to sit.

The artsy vibe looks straight out of Pinterest, with lots of wood and an airy feel from the tall ceilings. Props to a clean bathroom, which is artsy as well. \n\nI find it an energizing environment that's decent for getting work done. The side tables against the wall can hardly fit your laptop and a cup of coffee, but the communal table is spacious. (The only catch is getting hungry staring at the delicious pastries, but realizing $7 pie pockets are not within your budget)\n\nSnowy plover $4 || Andytown's specialty soda with coffee, topped with house-made cream. Yes, soda with coffee sounds questionable, and it's exactly how it turns out--strange at first, but you it grows on you. It's a bit of an acquired taste type of drink, but whipped cream always makes it tasty at the end of the day. I would recommend if you would like to cross this off your foodie bucket list, but I wouldn't be craving soda coffee per se.\n\nCappuccino $3.50 || Woaw, you can tell from their espresso drinks that their coffee beans are of superb quality. On weekends, you might even see them roasting beans in the back. My main complaint is that there was no latte art on the cappucino.\n\nWheat soda bread with butter $4 || The obligatory $4 toast, now considered an SF norm. Pricey considering any other spreads are a hefty extra charge ($2.75 for the addition of ham cheddar and bacon... can probably get you an entire breakfast sando at most normal places) I'm usually not a fan of soda bread, but I did enjoy this because it tasted so fresh and hearty with the whole wheat composition.\n\nStrawberry corn muffin $3.25 || Cruffins and cronuts are everywhere, but why don't I ever see a corn bread muffin? This was rather ingenious, because the shape of the muffin (and extra wide muffin top!) allowed for corn bread with an extra crunch. The filling of strawberry jam paired very well, not in an odd sweet-and-savory kind of way, but in a natural muffinness/dessertness. Wonderfully clever flavors and textures.\n\nJalapeno cheddar corn muffin $4 || Mmm, the savory, more provocative cousin of the fruit corn muffin. Excellent kick with the jalapeno and burnt cheddar.\n\nOverall, Andytown Coffee Roasters is a unique cafe worth checking out, and it's much more friendly than Trouble with their troublesome mannerisms.

Menu is minimalistic, but I still had a hard time choosing what I wanted. So obviously I had to head to yelp to see what I had to get. After scrolling through the photos and reading a handful of reviews, I got the Snowey Plower. Looked super yummy so I didn't question it. But in all honesty, I just don't get it. Maybe I didn't order the right thing, or mine was just made poorly that one time, but it tastes like sparkling water and cheap coffee. People complimented the Snowey Plower with how the sparkling soda does well against the bitter coffee, but I felt like the carbonation just took away too much from the actual brew of the coffee. 5 stars for service, 2 stars for my drink, so 3 (and a half) star average from me.

He said \"Ms V, we should go there.\" He did go but not with me, it was with one of his Avenue lady friends, which, as I've gotten to know him over the years, is a thing that he's apparently good at: to have lots of non married dating middle age lady friends living in the Avenues. And with these lady friends, he tend to go to a lot of coffee shops, presumably they want to unload their dating stories to him. \n\nThat said, when it was finally my turn to come to this spot, I was annoyed by the line out of the door syndrome. I understand recently some coffee place sold out its $15 a cup of coffee, this being San Francisco, is known to be filled with young people who like to line up for things that may or may not be mediocre. I completely understand that, I am not young but I have lined up like them in Tokyo for coffee zen masters. I understand it is part devotion part of mind body exercise. Good coffee require patience. \n\nPatience did not get me anywhere because I did not get Snowy Plover. What the heck is that? It's a bird. In fact, there is a sign by the beach that says it's a snowy plover protected area. But it's also a drink that everyone writes about. Cold soda coffee whipped cream. And for $4.50 it's a bargain considering some other place may be charging double.  Pastries are good, we got the last lemon curd scone. It sounded healthy at least. Cappuccino is comparable to Trouble. Not too acidic. There are little spots to sit and enjoy the coffee or the crowd, whichever you prefer, or you can do both, come to think of it.\n\nAll things considered, Andytown is better than Trouble for doggies. It has lots of doggie treats and a bowl of water. So when the next time I'm headed to the beach, with the doggie and not T, who occasionally behaves like the doggie (in the most enduring way I assure you), I'd come here over Trouble.", "author": "Victoria E."}

Ugh. Not my thing.\n\nI had planned to order a back up drink - a soy mocha. But they don't sell soy, only almond milk (the second time I ran into this in SF in one day)\n\nThis place is small. The kitchen(ish) area is large for them to make the coffees and bake the goods. There is a small walk way with some seating against the wall, all the way back to the restroom which has a barn style door. There is a large table in the front where people can gather around and share space. There is also a small coffee cart for everyone to use. They server all of their coffees and goodies on wood slats, super cute!\n\nThere is also plenty of seating outside of their corner location. Also shaded by trees, for the days the sun shines bright.\n\nBack to my Snowy Plover. It was really good. Like, really good. The mixture of the S. Pellegrino Sparkling Water marrying with the espresso is a magical combination. I was worried about the homemade whip on top (lactose intolerance worried), so I didn't really mix it in with the coffee. I did just a little, got a hit of sweet. Something about the bitter of the sparkling water and espresso makes a slightly sweet and carbonated awesome liquid goodness. I don't know how they figured it out, but it works. It really works.\n\nThis was my only time here, but I'd love to come back and try their coffee. The employees were all really sweet.

The espresso has a better aroma and it's slightly sweeter - maybe they put more syrup in their espresso at this location? \u200d\n\nOther things I've tried here are their scones, corn bread, thumbprint cookie and chocolate chip cookie. My favorite scone here is the goat cheese scone followed by the corn bread. \n\nThey created a new drink called the Matcha Snowy. It tasted like seaweed and tasted better over time but we never ordered it again.\n\nThe only downside of this location is the line which never fails on a weekend and is the only time I can come here since they close at 5pm on the week days. At times, the wait can be 15-20 minutes just to get to the cashier to place your order.

If you're into the frills and whistles of hipster coffee, try it. If you're like me, and you generally drink your coffee black -- probably not a good fit. Too sweet for my taste. It's not coffee in my eyes. I prefer my coffee black and basically just an injection of caffeine. LOL. The blacker, the better. The drip coffee here is decent.

But I'm OK with that...\n\nThe snowy plover is total bliss.  I've had other coffee drinks elsewhere with seltzer water, but never anything with brown sugar and whipped cream.  The brown sugar is a nice touch - gives it sweetness with some depth - and the whipped cream is just crazy good.  It's so heavy, it's basically custard.  I love it.\n\nThe Espresso con Panna is also good, especially if you like your coffee drinks to be less sweet.\n\nWith respect to food, if you want the Irish Soda Bread, you have to go early.  They definitely have a good selection of other baked goods as well, but those start selling out pretty quickly too - and they get stale by close-of-business.  The scone that I had around 4pm on a Saturday was edible but not great...pretty dry and bland.\n\nI have also been drinking their coffee at home and quite like it - we bought Wind & Sea, since I like the idea that they've analyzed all their beans and created a blend that they like, and I think it's on par with my favorite Blue Bottle beans (which are the Bella Donovan blend....and I see another reviewer agrees with me on the similarity!).  Definitely better than Philz or Counter Culture.  And - you can get it at Bi-Rite!\n\nThis is a bit out of the way for me, but always worth a stop if I'm out near the beach!\n\nP.S.

The baristas are super hip, polite but not friendly because they got a lot to do, ya know? The shop is VERY small, so plan to take yours to go if you don't see any empty tables. The menu is small but has your usuals.\n\nAnd then the Snowy Plover. Sparkling water poured over ice, two shots of espresso added to that, and then a beautiful little quenelle of house-made whipped cream plopped on top. I don't normally like sparkling water, and I rarely drink espresso drinks, but the Snowy Plover is as good as they say. It is, after all, their only non-standard coffee beverage, and their claim to fame. It's super refreshing in all its fizzy frothy goodness.", "author": "Starr C."}

The savory scone was outstanding, but the soda bread was probably worse for the travel, and seemed too expensive with the appealing-sounding seasonal spread of pumpkin butter and honey.\n\nIf this were my neighborhood coffeeshop, I'd be delighted. But as it is, I won't be traveling back to the outer sunset for it any time soon - which is great, because I won't be adding to the crowds, most of whom DO seem to be locals!", "author": "Lisa K."}

First, you feel like you're drinking soda because of the fizziness, and then there's the bitter, rich coffee after taste. Then, you can spoon the salted whipped cream to finish it off sweet and to balance the flavors. \n\nOne note is there's very limited seating, and we were there on a cold day and had to sit outside and keep changing tables to follow the sun.

The shot of Espresso is a welcomed escape from the other overly eager parents back on the greens. The Espresso and its invigorating aroma give him the much needed energy to enjoy the gatorade flavored kisses from his little soccer star.\n\nTo a college student, the afternoon coffee is a weekend luxury in the form of a Almond Milk Latte. The unassuming latte art complements her leather jacket perfectly to complete an image of a budding artist. The flavors are pronounced, but not overwhelming. The touch of sweetness from the latte is just enough to entice the college student to take her first step into the sophisticated world of coffee. \n\nTo the loyal house puppy, an afternoon coffee is the flurry of relentless attempts at its companion's buttery Soda Bread. It is also a time to say hello to other dogs and lick the Barista. The last part is important because the Barista is known to have dog treats from time to time, and that would easily be a house puppy's favorite part of an afternoon coffee.\n\nTo me, my afternoon coffee is the Snowy Plover, an iced, fizzy espresso topped off with a healthy serving of whipped cream. It is reminiscent of a fifth grade root beer, bringing me back to a time when all my worries resided inside a Pokemon game. The jolt of caffeine reminds me that I'm now15 years older and none the wiser. There's nothing like pondering about life over an afternoon coffee.\n\nWhat is an afternoon coffee to Andytown? It is everything. It is providing a place where a soccer dad can tune down with son. It is helping the student slowly assimilate to the coffee culture through the beauty of their latte art. It is giving a man's best friend another opportunity to hang out with the person it loves most. \nFinally, an afternoon coffee to Andytown is giving people like me a place to cultivate my ideas and write down my inspirations. This afternoon coffee may very well be the first of my many, many steps in fulfilling my dream of becoming a writer.\n\nThank you, Andytown, for giving us our cup of afternoon coffee!", "author": "Ringo M."}

They have awesome decor and serve you everything on their fancy wooden boards. The environment inside is awesome and their staff is super friendly . It's pretty spacious inside and out with plenty of seating for everyone .  They have one giant table by the door and a bunch of seating along the wall .\n\nI went around 3 and they were already sold out of the soda bread so we got the snowy plover which is their specialty coffee and a scone. The snowy plover is their coffee blended with soda topped with their homemade whipped cream. I know it sounds a bit odd at first but it's definitely worth a try . It definitely gives it an interesting flavor . The scone I got was sweet compared to the other savory one they had . It wasn't too dry like the other scones I've had. Overall this is an awesome cafe and definitely recommend checking it out. I'll definitely be back to try the soda bread and other baked goods that they had .", "author": "Thomas W."}

There's one table for multiple people by the front door and some two-person seating along the back wall. This place seems to be best for to-go drinks, though I've seen people with their laptops here. There's also some seating along the outside of Andytown where my friend and I sat. It's quiet and cold but still nice.\n\nNext time, I'll have to try their famous \"snowy plover\" which is coffee with sparkling water and cream. That didn't sound appealing to me at first, but I'm down to try anything once!\n\nEDIT: Tried the snowy plover, and while I thought the taste was funky, it had my wired for the rest of the day. WOW!!

Andytown's bakers are outstandingly talented, as are a few of their baristas.

They don't have flavored syrups here, but they do their own in house sweetener, which I actually really enjoyed. I would highly recommend their lattes. They were out of all their bread when I went, so my friend and I shared a cheddar scone, which was still good, but I really wanted to their bread!

Tucked away near the Sunset, a well-lit corner shop that proves both classy and inviting. They clearly know (and love) their coffee. They clearly love their space. Certain coffee shops I've been to with this sort of style - the oh so perfect, artsy, creative spots - seem to make me feel uncomfortable, like I don't fit into the image. Andytown, however, was extremely welcoming. All of the employees I interacted with seemed very genuine, passionate, and super chill. The pricing is reasonable. Along the walls there are really neat artwork pieces, like the mugs. \n\nHot cocoa was my selection, and it was made how it should be - with actual cocoa /warm milk and not some mix like chain coffee shops might give you. Rich, flavorful, and delicious. So perfect for the chill breeze of a San Francisco Autumn evening. \n\nThe one thing that makes this place not perfect is that there is very little seating inside, one corner table and a few small stool type seats against the wall.

Andytown is located in the quiet sunset neighborhood and you will almost miss it if you simply drive by since it's kind of in the middle of nowhere. [Ahem good luck finding street parking] greeted by energetic and friendly staff, went ahead and order the Snowy Plover and see how it's like.\n\n[Snowy Plover]: A\nHonestly if you only look at the three main ingredients of this drink - coffee, soda water and whip cream, you would have never imagined how good these three things go together. YES it was so good. First of all, you can't treat this as a \"coffee\" - think about going to get a boba tea or smoothies type of dessert drink instead. Then, with coffee's bitterness, it was perfectly neutralized and became a dessert type of drink by the sweet soda water - with a feeling/texture of drinking coke or sprite. But since coffee and soda water are both considered pretty strong for your mouth and throat - the whip cream completely balance the feeling out and enhanced the overall drinking experience. After I stirred the drink, the three ingredients completely blended together well, and enter my throat smoothly with a bitter sweet flavor.\n\nStrongly recommending the Snowy Plover!

Delicious coffee, scrumptious baked goodies, cheerful ambiance, feel-good music, cute cactuses--what more can you ask for? The only downside (for me) is that it's a 30 minute bike ride away from my apartment. Although, that hasn't stopped me from making the trip out here multiple times in just the past month... \n\nTip #1: Both bike and car parking nearby. There's not much seating room inside the coffee shop though, so most people take their food and drinks to go. There are a few indoor and outdoor tables, but keep in mind that it's Outer Sunset, so there's a perpetual chill in the air. *brrrr*\n\nTip #2: Baked pastries are fantastic! They have gluten free goodies here as well. \n\nTip #3: If you're biking from Mission area, take The Wiggle to avoid the hills. The Wiggle is a bike route--Google Maps will automatically route you through it. \n\nOverall: In a city awash with high-quality coffee shops, it takes a lot to stand out. Andytown Coffee Roasters does so, despite being off the beaten path, and has become one of my favorite coffee shops in the city.", "author": "Sarah W."}

At some future date, that gets me a pan of soda bread, an 8 ounce bag of coffee beans and a drink pog. \n\nI think Lauren and Michael were behind the counter yesterday when I stopped in. I was there to anonymously take a look at my \"investment\" and enjoy a rich cup of coffee and what turned out to be an amazing fresh baked gluten-free berry muffin. There as also a warm scone (with a complicated pedigree) right out of the oven that I should have purchased. \n\nAndytown Coffee Roasters threw off a nice neighborhood vibe, including a communal table (with an attractive shape and wood choice), an nice friendly busy buzz, and free dog treats. They also have four small tables down one side of this somewhat narrow shop, each with their own power outlet so people can get a little work done. \n\nLet's say that crowd funding is a neat thing and Andytown Coffee Roasters is satisfying success story.

I used to cut class during recess and climb up the fence to run to Kara's corner cup (before it was Andytown Roasters) and get a cream cheese and jam bagel when I was 9 or 10... (I'm 24 now) so this corner spot on Lawton and 43rd spot held a lot of memories for me. \n\nI knew Kara's was gonna close one day but I'm glad it became something I could love. So now instead of Kara's I come to Andytown. I usually get their lattes because they make it pretty well. It's a double shot latte so there's more coffee taste than regular lattes. It's smooth and aromatic, tasting more like coffee than cream/milk. Most places have it the other way around. Their baked goods like their scones are also on point and their bread+butter are great pairings with the coffee. \n\nAlso, their snowy plover is bomb but its pretty big and filling. Though I actually see it more as a coffee type of dessert than coffee-coffee (maybe because 1/2 of it is whipped cream) ya feel? I get it when I'm in the mood for something a little more filling and sweet. And did I mention they make it with sparkling water? Fancyyyy\n\nCons: I don't like their regular black coffee. Tasted too acidic for me. I felt that it just kinda overtook all the aromatic fragrance of the coffee bean itself.  But this is a personal preference.", "author": "Janet K."}

I love starting my day Saturday or Sunday mornings by stopping by here for a coffee or cappucino and then walking over to Devil's Teeth Baking Co. for a breakfast sandwich. \n\nTheir espresso drinks are some of the best in the city. They do a killer almond latte, almond mocha, and cappucino. Their most well known drink is the Snowy Plover, which is a sweetened double shot of espresso over pellegrino water, topped off with a large helping of house-made whipped cream. The whipped cream is AMAZING. It's thick, creamy, and the perfect sweetness to accompany the espresso. The Snowy Plover can be pretty heavy by itself, so I often like to get the 'Snowless' version without the whipped cream -- a tasty alternative to a normal cold brew or iced coffee. \n\nThe baked goods at Andytown are also fantastic. The corn muffins, scones, and cookies are all delicious. The soda bread is good too, but a bit plain for my tastes. \n\nAlso, the staff is super nice and friendly, much more so than the nearby Trouble Coffee, whose employees don't really seem like they enjoy working there at all. \n\nOuter Sunset is a bit out of the way of most things in the city, but Andytown is definitely worth the trip.", "author": "Eric W."}

The soda current scone was also really good, but the blueberry corn muffin shined through. I think their use of corn in the pastries is what makes them so good. If you come here, definitely get a pastry. The muffins...are to die for. Also they are known for their snowy plover (espresso, soda water, & whipped cream); it sounds really weird but it's actually really good! I recommend this for first timers, it's an Andytown signature. \n\nThe place is pretty small, and it gets super crowded all the time.

I wanted to get a latte but I could get a latte anywhere, the snowy plover though is unique to this place. \n\nThe snowy plover consists of Pellegrino sparkling water, espresso (already sweetened with brown sugar), and homemade whipped cream. The simplicity of this drink shouldn't fool you because it's wonderful and refreshing. It's basically a fizzy coffee drink. I'm not a fan of cream but their whipped cream was delicious...almost like ice cream. So glad I got this drink but I was a little bummed that I missed out on the latte art (because it looks so cool). \n\nThe cafe is small with only 3 small tables that can sit 2 and one big table in the front of shop that can sit 5-7 people. They have outdoor seating as well that can sit parties of 2. It's located on a street corner with easy street parking. Highly recommended if you're in the area :)", "author": "Jennifer H."}

(Actually, yes I do - it's because I'd overdose on their berry corn muffins!)\n\nI've come here twice and am very satisfied with both experiences. I've ordered the same thing both times. I'll switch it up next time! I promise...maybe. \n\nThe service is great and friendly. Those corn muffins, as I hinted, are delightful! The first time I went there was strawberry in them - it's like taking a bite of sunshine, and today they had blueberry. Still very tasty and they're not dry like other corn muffins I've had and half of the muffin goes a long way. Then of course, the wheaten soda bread with aged cheddar and bacon brings a tear of joy to my eye after the first bite. The best thing about it is that it's a big portion as well, so you can save the other half for lunch or throw it in the toaster oven the next morning and throw a fried egg on top. Yeah I said it! \n\nDefinitely try this place out if you're nearby or heading to the beach on a sunny (or foggy) morning!", "author": "Jess G."}

I've had their coffee, mocha, hot chocolate, and famous snowy plover. The mocha, hot chocolate, and snowy plower all come with whipped cream, which I think is delicious. It is thick creamy and home made. I highly recommend all of their coffee drinks. I have also tried the snowy plover, which wasn't my favorite. Many people seem to come in and ask for it. It is espresso with sparkling water and whipped cream on top. For me, the sparkling water is just a little strange, but other people seem to love it and come here just for that drink!\n\nThis place also has delicious baked goods. Their cookies crumble when you eat them and are super sweet, but not overly so. Their scones are pretty good, but a little dry. But my favorite is the soda bread, which comes with cheddar cheese or jam (also their oven closes at 3pm, so be sure to get there before that!)\n\nThe service here is friendly and attentive. They always strike up conversation and make you feel welcome. The baristas are talkative and take the time to talk to you and recommend drinks if you want. Also, shoutout to the barista that gave me a free coffee refill when they were about to close!!\n\nI also find this spot suitable to get a little bit of work done. There is wifi and one large table you can share with others where you can sprawl out and get stuff done. There are other smaller tables inside and a bunch outside as well. This cafe has a nice vibe with good music and the sound level is fine for reading or whatever you need to do!\n\nSide note, this is one cafe in sf that actually has street parking!

Whipped cream is probably my favorite food (judge away, I don't care), so the snowy plover is my dream drink. You may not think that fizzy coffee sounds like it would be good. Just trust the folks here and try a snowy plover. You'll be thanking yourself for days. The espresso is so smooth, it's just the right amount of sweet, and it's refreshing while still feeling indulgent with that giant glob of homemade whip on top. \n\nThe decor in here is stunning- there's a huge wooden table towards the front of the shop that gets amazing light on a nice day. That said, I prefer to take my snowy plover to Ocean Beach or to one of the three or four tables outside to enjoy some nice weather. I haven't yet tried their baked goods, but people seem to clamor over the scones and cookies, so I'd assume they're pretty solid. \n\nBottom line: if you want great quality coffee done in a unique way in a beautifully designed shop, Andytown is definitely worth the ride on the N.", "author": "Alex G."}

It's everything I love found conveniently in one location.\n\nThe ideal coffee experience:\n\nCOFFEE + PASTRY + TALKING WITH FRIENDS OR FAMILY OR COWORKERS\n\nEven though Andytown Coffee Roasters has nailed both the coffee and pastry segment, they need to work on the third part. I enjoyed their product but they really need to have more seating inside though there is a little bit of seating.\n\nMy party ordered:\n\nSNOWY PLOVER ($4): Interesting and innovative beverage consisting of layers of San Pellegrino carbonated water, coffee, and thicker/denser whipped cream; Mixed together it's very similar to a snowfall coffee with a very slight soda flavor; Though I was initially skeptical about the carbonated water (since I'm not a fan of a fizzy taste), I enjoyed it; The coffee and carbonated water melded together much better than I expected and the whipped cream gives the coffee that distinct flavor; Highly recommended for those who enjoy snowfall coffee with a hint of fizz\n\nCAPPUCCINO ($3.50): Didn't really have this one but my bro said Andytown exceeded every aspect of what he likes in a coffee; Very smooth and light; Not bitter in the least bit; Nice coffee art; Excellent temperature control\n\nSTRAWBERRY AND CHOCOLATE SCONE ($3.75): Andytown nailed the texture; Slightly warm, toasted, and crumbly; Strawberry taste was infused throughout the entire scone\n\nSERVICE: Really patient and answered our questions thoroughly; Came out with the coffee's and scone (pre-made but still warm) very quickly\n\nDECOR: Place is cute, rustic, and narrow yet modern with shelves, coffee appliances, and \"house\" plants everywhere so my kind of place; The actual coffee bar stretches towards the back leaving only a few seats on the sides (probably built for parties of no more than two people), a communal table in the front with windows letting sunlight in, and a narrow walkway; Outside, there is plenty of seating though it's difficult to find at times\n\nWill I return? Yes. But only if I'm in the area since I live quite far. Though I really enjoyed the innovation, beauty of the place, and my whole experience overall, it was a bit too troublesome for me to come here especially with little seating and horrific traffic.

I ordered a cappuccino (my go-to coffee drink) and stared at the pastry display even though I had just eaten because they all looked SO good. I contemplated getting the Snowy Plover just because it's something unique to Andytown, but I had tried an espresso + tonic water before and wasn't a huge fan, so I wasn't sure if I was gonna like that. I might come again just to try that though, because I noticed a tub of the homemade cream and it just looked so yummy haha. They serve hot drinks in the cutest ceramic mugs, which was so much fun to drink out of and made the whole experience seem so luxurious. I'm happy to say that I do think the coffee lived up to the hype; my cappuccino was delicious!\n\nI also wanted to note that I LOVE that they use a manual lever espresso machine.

The top was a crusty golden brown with crispy edges and fresh lump strawberries inside. The cheddar, scallion scone was equally delicious. Possibly the best scone I've ever had. Savory and moist with a slightly crunchy exterior. I could taste the quality and handcrafted love in every bite. \n\nThere was something authentically kind in the gentlemen making the espresso.

Which is kinda rough cause they're $4 a pop. But it's very worth it. \n\nProTip: Grab your cup to go and drink it at the beach", "author": "Misha T."}

It is a little more expensive here than other small coffee shops, but I like to think I'm supporting a local, small business. \n\nAndytown is the perfect place to catch up with friends you haven't seen in awhile. There are tables outside that seat up to four people, and smaller tables inside that seat two. There's also a group table for larger parties, but it seems to always be in use by individuals. There's a bathroom in the back should you need one. \n\nI recommend the lattes and corn muffins. Both are absolutely the best options here, in my opinion!", "author": "Joanne K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-12", "description": "I was on my way to Marin from South Bay on a beautiful Saturday morning and decided to take a quick coffee break in San Francisco. Given the sheer amount of coffee shops in the area, I wanted to go somewhere that differentiated from the typical fairly-traded, shade-grown, small-batch-roasted pour over or latte that I usually get. Thanks to Yelp, I found the Snowy Plover. I was able to get a wonderful glimpse of the ocean before I managed to park my car amidst a sea of other Andytown patrons.\n\nThe shop itself was pretty small; there was only enough seating for 3-4 small groups of people. The ambiance was very laid-back, with corner window facing the seascape ahead. The baristas, while very quick, were great at delivering service without sacrificing quality.\n\nI had already eaten my breakfast for the day, so I just ordered the $4 Snowy Plover. I was pretty impressed with the breakfast menu, though, as Andytown does offer a variety of savory options on top of the typical coffee shop pastry offerings. The soda bread and cheese offered on the menu also pleasantly evoked nostalgic memories of northern Europe...\n\nSo, to the Snowy Plover. Great drink. I was surprised at how delicious it was. The drink is basically a mixture of ice, a couple shots of espresso, simple syrup, S. Pellegrino sparkling water, and house-made unsweetened whipped cream. The sparkling water did a great job of enhancing the flavor of the espresso and the cream tied up the flavor beautifully at the end. I also found that the foam formed by the cream and sparkling water created an unintended artistic effect.\n\nGreat experience to have, and I think it was worth the stop and money to give this unique shop a try. I would come back if I come back to the neighborhood.", "author": "Dianna D."}

There are a few perks and gems here and there, but Andytown is definitely the shining star in my book.\nBright little neighborhood joint with friendly service. I've been told that Lauren and Michael (the owners) are ex Blue Bottle employees. Let me just say that this tells me that they know their shizz when it comes to a good cuppa.\n\nFirst, let me talk about the space. It's small. There's a big communal table in the front, then I think 3 little doubles tables (outlets under so you can charge your electronics) along the narrow hall. More tables and chairs outside, including a bench right out front. It's a neighborhood joint so it doesn't get too crowded. Sometimes the line looks long (out the door) but it moves fast. What can I say? These folks know how to make coffee! It's very well lit inside, lots of natural sunlight. I enjoy that a lot. Fresh floral arrangements weekly. \n\nPastries - I've only had their corn muffins. Each time I come, they just happen to bring some piping hot out the oven. I always get suckered by these. I LOVE THEM. First it was the peach goat cheese corn muffin, then I had some sort of strawberry one but yesterday's fig and orange compote corn muffin might have been my favorite. They are huge. I can never finish one on my own. I haven't tried any other pastry. \n\nMy favorite drink is the Snowy Plover. The first time I came in here, Lauren explained to me what it was. She told me if you're a coffee lover, you're either gonna love it or hate it. Well, I'm an open minded individual and I LOVE COFFEE so.... I ended up loving it. 2 shots of espresso with ice, Pellegrino, brown sugar and homemade whipped cream. My gawd, I just sold my soul to the Devil. As Jyang says \"COFFEE SODA!\" but whatever, I LOVES ITTTTTT. 2 beautifully pulled strong espresso shots and Pellegrino, who would've thunk? Not me that's for sure. It makes for a great drink on a hot day (especially since it's been effing humid) but it's just a solid drink all around, during any weather. It's like a great strong cup of iced coffee with a little zing (from the Pellegrino) that lightens it up a bit. The piece de resistance is definitely the homemade whipped cream. I have to say that I hate whipped cream from the can. Homemade is the shiznitz and let me tell you... The first day I stepped into Andytown, Lauren gave me a healthy helping of that delectable cream on my first Snowy. Never looked back...Well, except to check their store hours. DAMMIT they close at 3pm and they're closed on Mondays. I swear if they opened up earlier than 7am, I would drive my arse down to Andytown for my fix prior to hauling arse to work.\n\nSo yeah... just sign on the dotted line. Your soul?

The apple, cinnamon, ginger scone, is a staff favorite, according to the shop, and I can't blame them for loving it!

I had heard the scones here were spectacular, but the muffins were calling my name.  The girl who helped us was so friendly and happy to be working there.  She noted that the strawberry corn muffins were still warm, which sealed the deal.  The muffin was indeed warm and freshly baked, crusty on the outside and moist on the inside - aided by fresh cut strawberries in the dough.  The atmosphere here was clean and modern, but there is limited seating and it is a small space.  The snowy plover was BEST THING EVER - espresso, San Pellegrino, fresh whipped cream.  It was everything I had hoped it would be and just slightly sweet (take it from a frappuccino-lover like me... there is no need to add sugar as it is perfect as is, especially when you mix in the whipped cream).  God, I hope Andytown franchises out into the Mission so I can go everyday.  Really loved this place.", "author": "Christina G."}

Andytown is a serious new contender on the San Francisco coffee scene, and I can't wait to see how they grow and expand. \n\nThe coffee I ordered was the Snowy Plover, sparkling soda with simple syrup, a shot of espresso and fresh whipping cream.

Made with Pelligrino, a brown sugar syrup, 2 shots of espresso over ice and topped with a generous serving of house made whipped cream It reminded me of a float made with coffee ice cream so the \"coffee float\" descriptions are not far off.  The Plover is bes,t in my opinion, when you can really mix up the whipped cream into the drink - i found the tastiest plover I had was the one i poured into a bigger tumbler that allowed me more room to mix the drink up without splashing over.\n\nthe rest of the menu is minimal, but very good!  Aside from the standard coffee/espresso drinks, Andytown offers a selection of soda bread scones (savory/sweet) and cookies.\n\nthe menu itself is so minimalist as to almost be missed if you are short: its a stark white (to match the walls) in an austere sans serif font.\n\nminimal seating inside at 3-4 small tables that seat 2, or folding cafe tables outside.

I'm not a huge espresso drinker anymore, and prefer my coffee black, so while the Snowy Plover sounds good, it's not really my thing.  But that shouldn't stop you either.  In any case I am definitely a sweets person and that strawberry corn muffin was calling my name the minute I laid eyes on it.  In sitting and enjoying my food and beverage, space is definitely limited here, but the one thing I absolutely appreciated about Andytown was how many people call themselves a regular here.  The people behind the counter greeted each of their regular customers like old friends.  Nothing overly pretentious here, and definitely an environment that welcomes relaxers, families, or people stopping in for a breakfast item and coffee.  I wish I could come here more often! The coffee was good, although I think our coffees were served a little too hot which made tasting it a little difficult. That being said, this is definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.", "author": "Lisa I."}

I don't have to add a single thing to it and it'll keep me going for a couple of hours.\n\nAppreciate the outdoor seating, but it's still a challenge finding a spot. I only come here to meet up friends - not a place to study because of its size.

The snowy plover is the way to go, even on a cold morning i enjoyed it, and i was really feeling something warm.  The concoction sounds so funky and strange that i almost didn't want to order it, afraid i would be dissapointed; but it works.  Perfect smooth coffee balance and flavor, and the dollop of heavy sweetened cream on top just makes this drink perfect to sip on!  Go for the snowy plover, for the win!  .  \n\nI also tried a latte, its stronger than most with nice coffee flavor, not too bitter.  They really know how to pull a nice shot.  Only wish my coffee art was perfected, guess they could work on their coffee art.  Blue bottle might still make a better latte only because they use richer whole milk, but its more personal preference.\n\nThe jalapeno cornbread muffin is good, but wished there was more jalapeno and cheese.  Its a rather larger muffin, big enough for two people to share.\n\nOnly downside is the place is really small and only a few small interior tables, not meant for sitting down to catch up with friends.

Admittedly, I always order either a Snowy Plover or a latte, creature of habit, I am.  Let's talk about the Snowy Plover for a second - a shot of espresso over ice with Pellegrino and topped off with dollop of fresh whipped cream - are you kidding me?  The espresso is so balanced and even a tad sweet that you don't need sugar.  Completely mix in the whipped cream or not, it's the most perfect iced coffee.  The latte is great, too; perfect temperature and again so balanced that I only use one teaspoon of sugar whereas I would normally use 2 or 3 at other coffee houses.  \n\nAnd the scones!  Savory or sweet, you can't go wrong with either. I often choose the gluten free option - which often is the strawberry corn muffin - and I love it.  Does not taste gluten free, texture is like any corn muffin, and berries are bursting out of the muffin. I especially enjoy it when it's still warm.\n\nI don't get to Andytown often, but when I do, it brightens up my morning what with the delicious offerings and smiling staff.

Cornbread and a warm cup of latte = perfect combination.\n\nI do wish the place was bigger though.

The guy put the espresso in the cup first, then poured boiling water (too hot!) over it, destroying the crema. Still in search of a good espresso and Americano, with good taste, good crema, and coffee that stands on its own without sugar, milk, soda water or whipped cream.", "author": "Deb L."}

I think maybe 15 people can sit in there. Their pastries looked delicious and the soda bread that you can add cheddar and bacon too sounded bomb. I got a snowy plover per my friends request because she says \"I don't know if I hate it or love it\". I believe the snowy plover is coffee with Pellegrino and creme fraiche on top. Sounds weird but has an interesting taste, I am now at that crossroads as my friend. I can't tell if I love it or hate it. It's good but when you first sip it you get the Pellegrino carbonation which is just interesting in a coffee drink. The coffee in the snowy plover was delicious so I would definitely go back to try a coffee and soda bread with cheddar and bacon.", "author": "Rebecca M."}

It's all about the journey and I didn't mind taking the trek across town to sample the goods, it made me feel like an urban coffee bean hunter.\n\nI patiently waited in the small line that seemed to be just outside the door when suddenly I was punched in the face by the smell of baked goods fresh off the oven, I could almost see the steam rising off those gigantic blueberry corn muffins. \n\nI was greeted at the counter, and I failed to quickly respond still unconscious from the intoxicating smells coming off  the pastries, I remembered saying 'hello, good..morning.' I quickly got it together and ordered a coffee and asked about the beans that were displayed behind me. I was looking for a tasty blend to use for espresso, cappuccinos, and something that would work for brewing as well. I believe I was speaking with Michael, he proceeded to elaborate on a particular espresso blend that had its origins in Brazil/Ethiopia. He told me that his Brazil was single origin, (a season's worth of beans harvested from one plantation) and roasted just a few days ago. He looked quite serious about this blend, and somehow I knew this was the one. I noticed I walked out with my bag and coffee in hand and didn't grab one of those muffins...no bueno.\n\nThe Brazil/Ethiopian blend was delicious, the coffee had a very nice body - bright notes of caramel, peach, and a very earthy bottom that kept me sipping more. Nice, feel good about yourself kinda buzz this coffee is very, and I mean very fragrant and is a pleasure to smell every time I'm using the grinder.

If it hadn't been so early I probably would have opted for a Guinness at a local pub, but I chose a little pick me up and a scone instead. The Snowy Plover ($4), named after a bird, is a specialty coffee of Andytown that I have read about in numerous publications but ran across most recently in a Bold Italic article. Sparkling water, a little simple syrup, espresso over ice, and topped with a house made whipped cream scoop makes a beverage that looks and tastes as smooth as Guinness. I wholeheartedly recommend coming by and trying this unique take on an americano. The soda current scone ($2.75??) I purchased was outstanding as well.

I love that they have dog treats in front. \n\nFood/Drink - I love love LOVE their sausage rolls, if only they made them every day. :( Their fresh fruit muffins are also amazing, the strawberry corn muffin fresh out of the oven is hard to beat. The boyfriend goes with either the cheddar scallion scone or the wheat bread with raw cheddar and bacon. They serve them on little wooden boards if they are \"for here\" which is wonderful. Their latte's are perfectly foamed and the art is exquisite. You can tell the owners care a lot about their craft. I will have to echo that you MUST try the Snowy Plover. Perfectly carbonated, caffeinated and sweet. Their homemade whipped cream is to die for.\n\nService - AMAZING. They are all extremely welcoming. \n\n**I do love that they use Square because I never have cash on me, and I can tip them through my card.", "author": "Darline D."}

I bought a bag of beans to see if I could work with them at home. The beans were roasted dark, but not so dark that the bean was oily. They could specialize in espresso and I'm not as versed in that, so I would definitely check it out if you're an espresso aficionado just in case.

I have to be really careful and drink super slow for the ice to melt to get more liquid. What I'm trying to say is, I was not satisfied.

I can't stress this enough - Andytown is so popular the line is usually out the door and stays that way for hours on end. With such high demand, it might be easy to just focus on your job and not be pleasant - this is NOT the case at Andytown.

Since I didn't make enough time to brew my morning coffee, I decided finding a local coffee spot would do the trick. And boy did Andytown not disappoint.\n\nUnless I decide to be fun along the lines of something in the latte family, my everyday coffee is black. Because I was in a rush, I went for the already brewed coffee, and was very surprised by how delightful it was as I sipped the drink. Notes of citrus and fall spices came through on the nose and in the aftertaste.  I love when you can actually taste layers of flavor that hit you at different moments when drinking a good cup of coffee, and this certainly had that. \n\nThere was also a stunning and very tempting display of pastries right in front and in hindsight I wish that I grabbed one to go with me out the door- they looked DIVINE.\n\nI love coffee shops and their general cozy vibe, but between you and me, I'm tired of coffee shops feeling like musty old witch dens. Something very refreshing about Andytown's decor is the bright use of color and tall ceilings. Although a fairly narrow space, the white subway tiles make it brighter and clean looking. A very kind staff as well - always appreciated as a customer.\n\nI can't wait to find another excuse to make it back and try a pastry, and of course drink more of that delicious coffee.", "author": "A.

Tip: Mix the whipping cream in with the coffee. It tasted great, the service was amazing as frazzled as I was, and it was quick as could be!

Not only do they do coffee really well, but the owners are ridiculously nice :) I live in the Outer Sunset and I am so happy that we now get to enjoy a place like Andytown. Contrary to some of these other yelp reviews, the sunset really isn't in the middle of nowhere. San Francisco is a small city folks. But, I will continue to let others makes their assumptions about this gem of a neighborhood. It's pretty special and I love it here :)", "author": "Abby G."}

Fizzy, creamy coffee--a really interesting experience.  I also got a piece of the soda bread with butter and cheese, a cocoa nib and salt cookie, and a strawberry corn muffin.

I'm not a big coffee drinker, but that was is really good. It did get some used to after a few sips cause of the bubbles, but having it sweetened with their whip cream was very good. Also I got the raspberry corn bread with an apricot fill. It was yummy. I think this is my new place to go to.", "author": "Melanie T."}

If you haven't tried them yet, you are missin' out! They are now my \"go to\" almost every day. Plus, not only is their coffee delicious with a one of a kind flavor, their baked goods- specifically their fruit corn muffins, are TO DIE FOR! All of their baked goods melt in your mouth and taste even better paired with their perfectly roasted and flavorful coffee. PLUS, their staff is kind and their effort to take care of the coffee shines through with every cup. Go to Andytown! You will not be disappointed.", "author": "Lindsey S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-13", "description": "Now we're talking! The Outer Sunset's swank, clean-lines, caffeinated pride and glory has arrived!! As a self-proclaimed (and popularly acknowledged) coffee snob, I say --without trepidation-- that Andytown Coffee Roasters is, hands-down, the finest damn cuppa in the over-coffeed city of Sam Framcisco.  Michael, Lauren and the team understand crema, and pay homage to ristretto. They roast their own, on-site, and pull masterful shots (on a Kees van der Westen, Idrocompresso, nonetheless) so you are guaranteed the freshest, purest and smoothest pour in town.  Their traditional and Irish-inspired handmade pastries are delicious, and include a daily selection of gluten-free corn (+fresh, local fruit) muffins, savory sausage rolls, soda bread and a mascarpone/berry \"Patriot\" scone, which will knock your red-white-and-blues to the moon.  Note the modern, yet organic appointments, like bamboo serving trays and hand-thrown mugs. For a novel treat, try the Snowy Plover (fizzy H2O, espresso and house-made whipped cream).  This place has caught on, so your wait may include some sidewalk time, but the crew are fast, clever and friendly, so squeeze in and hold on. You're in for a bonafide and luxurious cuppa joe. Dig it! Indoor seating is limited, but don't be afraid to squeeze in at the gorgeous community table in the front.  Most often a seat is open outside.", "author": "Holly D."}

The guy at the counter was nice and fast.  There was happy music in the background that made me feel good and left a smile on my face.  And, the place was really clean.  It's small, but there are a few seats inside and outside.  They also individually bag each sausage roll and cheddar scallion scone so you don't have to worry about someone touching dirty money and then your food.  I'll be coming back.", "author": "M. N."}

Came by on a Sunday late morning to a long line (there's a church across the street so they get lots of consistent customers after their service), but it moves.  Favorite part about the experience was the shop's interior - feels really cozy, warm, open, airy, cheerful (great use of white and reclaimed wood) even on foggy mornings.  If eating/drinking in, they serve your order on these cute wooden platters.  We had the cheddar/corn/jalapeno muffin and the strawberry scone - both came out of the oven fresh and they were lovely - definitely recommend.  I hear all their baked goods are excellent so I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong.  We also ordered the Snowy Plover and an Almond Milk Mocha - both of which we weren't too thrilled about.  I really think the Snowy Plover is an acquired taste - a lot of folks rave about it (here in the reviews and in the shop as well) but, I unfortunately, could only get half of it down.  Just not a fan of sparkling water and espresso.  The almond milk and mocha had a slightly off after taste - but I really think that maybe mochas can't be done well with almond milk...we've tried that combo at a few great coffee shops and it just didn't work out.  I'll have to go back and just try their coffee with milk - and I would def come back!", "author": "Janelle H."}
