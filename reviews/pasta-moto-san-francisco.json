It's not on the menu, but if you ask for a cheese pizza, they'll make it for you. This pizza was very oily, cheesy (good), and soggy in the middle, but the cheese was sliding off of my pizza. I was fine that it was soggy in the middle because the dough around it was crispy. I thought this pizza was good and I'd come here again to order pizza.\n\nI also tried their penne pasta with meat sauce and it tasted good too, but it didn't soak in the sauce that well and the pasta felt overcooked.\n\nI'd recommend this place if you're having some huge pizza cravings and don't mind the oil, but I just wish they gave me more than one napkin.", "author": "Elaine N."}

We were hungry, so we decided to get something to eat at the food court. Which one shall we dine at? Lobster Me? Buckhorn Grill? Koja Kitchen? The paella from the Brazilian place (name escapes me)? They opted for Buckhorn Grill and I chose Pasta Moto.\n\nI could not do a check-in. My cell phone had only three percent power left and my portable charger was dead. Ugh!!! My oldest sister had to take a photo of me with my margherita pizza and oven roasted vegetables.\n\nThe pizza was okay. It was nothing to write home about. Definitely it was not as tasty as the margherita pizza from Tony's Napoletena Pizza in North Beach. Even the tomato mozzarella panini that Starbucks used to sell tasted better. Ai yah! I made a mediocre choice in the food court.\n\nThe oven roasted vegetables lacked garlic seasoning. I am not a fan of parmesan cheese in those little packets. I prefer fresh grated parmesan. Overall, the veggies could have been better. I was somewhat disappointed. \n\nTo think, I almost wanted to borrow that line from T-Challa (Chadwick Boseman) in a skit on SNL regarding Karen's potato salad, except in this case it was the veggies. I couldn't burst the employee's bubble and tell him \"to keep that bland a** oven roasted vegetables to himself.\" Instead I asked for a to go box. (Yes, when I arrived home, I threw some minced garlic and parsley flakes to doctor up the veggies.) \n\nLesson learned. I will not order the oven roasted veggies again. Return visit? Might, then might not. It was a hit and miss in my book.\n\nHowever, the employees were friendly and helpful.", "author": "Carol C."}

Both the sauces were not near the value of their cost, with emphasis on the pesto gnocchi. The pesto was unusually sea-green, and we take their cooks put a little too much blue food coloring in this batch. The pesto was overly oily and blue, which made the whole meal very off.

Product knowledge. When a customer asks you if your pesto is cream based or oil based this is not an \"outrageous request\". Some people on this planet cant eat food with milk or cream in it. You should not over react, or tell the customer its \"pesto\" and try to avoid answering the question. Keep in mind you are a cashier in a mall food court, you are not the bouncer of an exclusive night club in the City, you dont get to pick and choose who you give good service to.\n\n2. Customer Service. When you add additional items to a persons order, and the customer questions why you have added additional items that they did not order. Do not tell the person that's what they ordered and they have to pay for it. They dont have to pay for it, especially if they didn't order it. It is not the customers fault you are too busy looking at underage boys to pay attention to their order.\n\n3. Make a decent product. For the price, you should try and have food that tastes good, and consistent. Food that cooked earlier then reheated usually tastes that way. Also most people can tell when you are using canned sauces and expired olive oil. The items I have had here previously were \"okay\" at best. But after today I will be skipping this spot and waiting for the day it gets replaced with a new food court restroom.", "author": "Paul G."}

Didn't want the tri tip dinner my friend was getting from the place across the food court. Spotted Pasta Moto and decided to get Italian food. Damn, I was glad I made that decision. I don't know how the bad reviewers like their Italian food but the way it was prepared exceeded my expectations. First off the pizza, although a little small, was cooked perfectly. I'm not a big fan of pepperoni only pizzas but this one was absolutely delicious. Lots of cheese melted perfectly and a delicious crust. I would definitely order this again and also try mushroom pizza.\n\nI saw that they had rigatoni Bolognese but no spaghetti Bolognese. The girl behind the counter said no problem we can make it with spaghetti as well. I expected to get a flavorless tasteless red liquid sauce typical of what you would find that a food court in the mall. But what I got was spectacular! It was a nice thick sauce with lots of meat and tiny cubes of carrots, not just a red liquid. I can eat a lot of pasta and I considered it to be pretty healthy serving. Unfortunately I agreed with my other friend that we split the pasta and pizza so we would each get a some of each. I really regretted that decision. Not only could I have eaten the entire serving by myself but he thought it was so good that we cleaned the bowl out entirely.\n\nPersonally I loved the food there and look forward to returning to a try some of their other dishes.

Also, the staff member who places the food on the trays and buzzes you is not friendly at all. He just takes your buzzer without a word or a smile. One time I told him that I had ordered garlic bread as well, and without a word he turned around, found it on the counter, and tossed it on my tray.

This place should rename itself Pizza Moto.\n\nAnyway, here are the details of my visit.\n\nI was visiting the San Francisco Bay Area with my girlfriend, and we had just figured out the overly-complicated public transportation (we're from LA, so please excuse us) and arrived at the mall food court, starving. I wanted pizza for some reason, so we walked around the food court, looking around, and I settled onto this place like I thought I would.\n\nThe plan was to get one pizza (the mushroom one) to tide us over until we could decide on what else we wanted to eat, but we encountered a major problem: the pizza was too good. \n\nThe pizza here is sized for individuals, cut into 8 slices each. Our pizza happened to be topped with garlic, portebello mushroom, and truffle butter, among the usual sweet tomato-based sauce. The crust was paper thin (or, if you're not digging my exaggeration, about the thickness of poster board) and super crispy--reminiscent of pizza from Italy.\n\nWe finished this pizza, decided, \"Screw the other places; we love this,\" and then went back for a pepperoni pizza and a Pasta Pomodoro.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-09-08", "description": "I was surprised to see so many negative Yelp reviews about the food served by this place. But then again, I always order the same entree whenever I eat here, so I can't actually comment on the 'blandness of the alfredo sauce' or the 'tiny portions of the ravioli' that other Yelpers have been mentioning. However, what I can say is that I immensely like the item that I always order,  which is the penne. I always request the optional chicken pieces that you can have added to it  for an additional $2.50, which in my opinion is worth it because it helps make the penne an incredibly tasty meal. Another compliment I can pay this place is that my food is always prepared in a reasonably timely fashion, rarely takes longer than six or seven minutes. The staff that I've interacted with here have never treated me rudely, so another thing I was surprised to see here on Yelp were the reviews that mentioned having received rude treatment by those who work there. The older gentleman (who I'm assuming is the owner) always makes sure to politely thank me when I pick up my order. As far as the cashiers, although they don't go above and beyond with their friendliness, they certainly have never treated me in a disrespectful or discourteous manner. \n\nOne drawback to eating at Pasta Moto is the fact that the food court becomes extremely crowded on the weekends. I sometimes come here for lunch on Sundays and it's definitely a challenge to try to find seating. However, that is to be expected taking into consideration the fact that the Westfield Centre is one of the busiest, most hectic places downtown and is naturally always full of shoppers and tourists on the weekends. In order to secure a table, you pretty much have to catch customers already finished with their meals who are gathering their shopping bags and look like they are about to vacate their table. I hate hovering around people who are getting ready to leave, and it makes me feel like a vulture circling its prey, but that's essentially the only way you're going to be able to find somewhere to sit during peak business hours like Sunday afternoons. But otherwise I have absolutely no complaints about lunching at Pasta Moto and it is actually my favorite eatery in this entire food court. \n\nAlthough it may seem unfair to give them four stars when I've only actually tried one entree, in my opinion they deserve it at least for the consistency of their food quality since what I order is equally as good each and every time I go. For me personally, consistency is of the utmost importance; when I'm very hungry, I only go places that I know I can count on to serve me the same delicious food that I've had in the past at that locale, and as far as I'm concerned Pasta Moto has proven to be this type of eatery time and time again. Again I can only comment on the penne since that's the only entree I've tried here, so if you're ever in the vicinity of downtown and are in the mood for some good penne, Pasta Moto is without a doubt the place to choose.", "author": "Tito The Incognito .."}

Things looked good but nothing really popped out at us. So we kind of settled for Pasta Moto. My friend got the Alfredo and i got the Rustia pizza. The Alfredo wasn't really good, but it was good for being in a mall food court. The pizza however was pretty jam packed with flavor. I liked it a lot! And if you're a pizza-ranch person like me, the place next door has ranch! The only thing i didnt like about it was that the crust toward the center of the pizza was pretty soggy. So trying to pick up the pizza was pretty challenging. You kind of have to fold it in half, then still hold the front part with another hand. If you don't, it will all sag down and the toppings will fall out. They should work on getting that middle a little more stiff. \n\nANYWAY! I digress. This place's pizza is ok. Worth trying, unless if you're a tourist, then there are better places to eat. Prob go and hit up Blondies on Powel street. Its right there.", "author": "Patrick A."}

Always do. Pasta portions are generous and it easily gives me enough for a second meal. So really, my meal cost $5.61. \n\nTo boot, the workers are pleasant and helpful (a combination you will have trouble finding at most food courts) and entrees come with a side of tasty garlic bread.

I had to be outside in 15 minutes and there is no fast food type joints inside the SF Shopping Center. We had to be at a show and we were pressed for time and knew we needed to eat before the 8 oclock show that would most likely let out after 10PM.  There's not really anything easy to take to-go and fast from inside the food emporium either...  but I spied with my little eye paninis in the food case and decided that was what I was going to go with.  I ordered a prosciutto and a pollo panini to go thinking they'd probably just have to press it and ta-da I'd be done and ready to go but I still had to wait a good 10 minutes for it to be done.  I was getting hungry seeing all the pastas coming out before my order.  My hubby who I was meeting outside actually had to circle the block a few times because it took awhile.  As soon as it was ready, my pager buzzed and I grabbed the food and ran.  We ate in our car... how romantic... but it ended up actually being really good!  It came in a small box, so I thought it would just be the paninis but there was a salad tossed in balsamic vinagrette with tomatoes too and potato chips.  A perfect sized meal.  We split the sandwiches and got to try both.  The chicken was the better one in my opinion, it had slices of chicken breast, avocadoes,  mozzarella, and a pesto sauce.

As it is an 'upscale' emporium there isn't a Sbarro to be seen anywhere and I can honestly say that Pasta Moto is everything that Sbarro wishes it could be.\n\nAs Italian as Marlon Brando riding a Vespa, this place serves pizza and pasta that would not be out of place at La Westfield Centro, Naples and that is a good thing.  The owner is often stationed at the register doing everything to bring together American-Italian relations by handing out free drinks to pretty girls and discount pasta to those that work in the centre.\n\nService aside the food is delicious and given I've eaten a lot of Italian food in Italy I can vouch for it's authenticity.  The pizzas are hand tossed from fresh dough and then baked very very quickly to ensure the right balance between crisp and chew.  The pasta is perfectly portioned for a pre-gym meal (not too much) and delicately flavoured and EXPERTLY SEASONED. \n\nMy pet peeve as you might know reading my reviews is restaurants in Cali that think salt is evil.  Pasta Moto doesn't.  So please forego the Sbarro prejudices and give this lot a go, they serve great food at slightly high prices. :)", "author": "Tony S."}

He was craving some Hawaiian pizza, but Pasta Moto didn't make it, so we got a different pizza instead.  They buzzed us pretty quickly so we got the pizza fast.  What was kind of funny was that the man is a pretty picky eater, so he literally picked off all the toppings from the pizza so it ended up just being a cheese pizza.  Which makes me wonder if they make just a cheese pizza so he didn't have to go through all the work of picking off all the toppings.", "author": "Kris L."}

I got the pasta special mix with tomato and cream sauce as recommended by the cashier and I also paired it up with some nice crispy garlic bread.  The pasta itself contains a great mixture of chicken, mushrooms, basil and onions that created such a great taste it totally knocked my taste buds out.  Kudos to the cooks for making this great meal for me!! Definitely one of the spots I will try to stop by at least once a week to fill in my pasta cravings.", "author": "Lu Lu L."}

In malls, this option usually doesn't exist because that giant grease slice is not frequently made to order. Cheeseless pizza can often be a terrible disappointment (think wonder bread flattened with a mallet and rubbed with ketchup) but the crust and sauce here holds up without being drowned in mozzarella. You can get the margherita with roasted vegetables for an extra dollar and you've got an excellent flatbread focaccia. Yeay for the tasty default vegan pizza! Servers are also very friendly. For mall food, yes perhaps its expensive, but for the quality of the pizza, I think the prices are pretty reasonable actually.", "author": "Hallie R."}

I took Bart from Fremont and got to the San Francisco shopping center starving for food.  I wanted to find some place nice to eat, but I also didn't want to wait very long.  I ordered one of their thin crust pizzas and it was served lightning fast.  It is a little pricey for mall food, but at least it was good.  The area to sit and eat was crowded an noisy, but that is to be expected in such a high foot traffic area.  I would go back again if I were in the same situation where I was in a rush for decent food.", "author": "Sherry R."}

It's actually quite decent, but like every other eatery in that food court, a bit overpriced for what it is.\nAlso, while I like friendly, courteous service, I do not like complete strangers attempting to flatter me. That said, did not enjoy being called 'babe\" and \"bella\" by total stranger, and a skeezy looking one at that. Call me old fashioned, call me a raging feminist, but I didn't enjoy it.\nThat said, when I did have a complaint about my experience there, the mangement was very sympathic and had me and a guest come back for a free meal and free glass of wine, which was nice. If only the location manager was there when we went, as he said he would be.", "author": "A J."}

I got close to the menu and it must have been obvious that I didn't know what I wanted because the guy came up to me and started telling me about the dishes. His offer was sincere, but I could tell that his descriptions of the dishes was scripted. He could have told me, \"hey dude this is some good stuff, it's pizza with tomatoes and garlic and it's okay, but if you want the good stuff try this.\" but instead he gave me a script with his eyes looking up as though he was trying to think of the rest of the words. Halfway through his rant I decided to order the penne pasta with caesar salad and garlic bread, but he cut me off to whistle at a girl passing by. Dude take my order first THEN whistle at the girls. There will be plenty of girls passing by! The pasta was okay but it lacked Parmesano cheese. The portions were large though so I wasn't able to finish it. Overall I would say give it a shot if you're hungry. It's like Sbarro's but slightly better.", "author": "Clara M."}

The pricing is very fair for both the quality and quantity of food. The staff is very attentive and friendly, making you forget, that you are, in fact, in a mall. Trust me, this is difficult, as I used to work in this mall until very recently!!! And believe me there is only so much crappy pizza, pretzels and greasy Chinese food one can ingest! Good selection of wine to enjoy with your meal and it's open late.  Definitely worth a visit.  :)", "author": "Anie A."}
