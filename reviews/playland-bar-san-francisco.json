This bar has two stories and let me tell you.. the second floor is always a good time. Although it may get crowded through the night, the music is always relevant and fun! It's pretty dead around 10pm but once it rolls around 11, this place gets so packed it's hard to move around. There's four bars total (I think). Two upstairs and two downstairs. Drinks are standard prices, there's no cover for girls but I think it's a $10 cover for guys (depending on time and day I think?), all restrooms are downstairs. There's a fairly large dance floor, music videos are playing along with the music, and the DJ takes requests! Line does get out the door sometimes but it moves quick. \n\nCome here if you love dancing! Great vibes and I love it!", "author": "Amy L."}

We arrived at about 11:30 on a Saturday night and the line was wrapped around the corner. We waited in line for about 20 minutes or so, no problem. Once we finally reached the door, I was a bit surprised when the bouncers told us that the guys in our group had to pay a $10 cover fee. Also, if there was a dress code here, I didn't notice it and it wasn't enforced because god forbid, guys were wearing jeans with Converse and girls were wearing Stan Smith's. It was a very casual and laid back vibe from the start. \n\nOnce inside, a few of us ordered drinks from the cocktail menu on display. They were just okay, too sweet for my palette. The bartender making the cocktails didn't seem to be too familiar with the recipes as she kept having to turn around to refer to the list of ingredients on the wall.\n\nUpstairs was complete pandemonium. It was extremely packed and hard to maneuver your way around the dance floor. Cramped would be an understatement. Once you find your spot, you're there for the rest of the night! I'm almost positive the building occupancy exceeded the maximum capacity for fire code enforcement! Basically, don't come here if you're claustrophobic. If you go to the bar, have fun finding your way back. Luckily, there's a small bar closer to the dance floor, but come prepared because that particular bar accepts cash only. Drinks weren't too strong, but they were cheap (IMO) compared to what I'm used to in Vegas! \n\nI liked the music when we first arrived. The DJ was playing TLC, Ashanti, and that Oye Mi Canto throwback. The crowd was chanting the words to every song that blared through the speakers, which I guess says a lot about the age group here. As the night went on, the music got progressively worse. I love me some Cardi B, but one can only listen to Bodak Yellow so many times.\n\nOverall, I'd say we had a good time and enjoyed ourselves.", "author": "Jordan I."}

It was free for girls and $10 cover for guys. At a first glance, I thought it was the smallest bar ever but then noticed there was another room off to the side and also an upstairs area. There was a line to go upstairs and I understand why - it was PACKED. We managed to order a few drinks at the bar but the dance floor was full so we ended up going back downstairs. The music was good though. I ended up in the smaller room off the side where theres a good amount of seating and a small bar. S/o to the female bartender (forgot her name) that was there at the time, you were super fun! Drinks are regularly priced as expected ($9 shots, etc.).\n\nI like how there's a few different areas that you can hangout in, and you can move from room to room.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-03-28", "description": "Just had a very unpleasant experience at this bar with Judith, the bartender upstairs. We had our first round of drinks and she was totally fine. Upon our second round of drinks I felt the apprehension and rude remarks from her. We had originally ordered 3 shots of Rye and 3 Shocktop Beers. But we had changed our minds to 3 shots of Rye and 2 Shocktops instead. We thought she heard us because we saw her pour only 2 cups of beers from the draft, but note there was 1 cup set aside from her previous pour (we did not know how long it has been sitting there). Upon serving us our drinks she served us 3 shots and 3 beers. We kindly informed her that we thought she acknowledged the fact that she heard us change the order to 2 beers as she only poured 2 cups. She responded with, \"I can't even hear in here facing you guys you think I can hear you with my back turned to you? I mean I can't drink this beer because I'm working so I'll just have to throw it away?\" *So take note, the other cup was from her previous pour for another customer that was left behind the bar.* Her response was just uncalled for. We ended up just taking the cup of beer, a small plastic Bud Light cup .\n\n\nFinally the ticking point was her just being flat out rude to her next guests that were next to me. Judith claimed that her guest (who happened to be a tourist from another country) gave her a fake $100 bill. I saw the $100 bill with the yellow strike from her detection pen, and as someone who had worked in a bank, I know for sure what a real and a fake $100 bill looks like. After their altercation, I thought to have a conversation with Judith and inform her that a fake $100 bill would show a black color after using a detection pen. Judith had informed me that their bar received 8 different $100 bills last week that all showed a brighter yellow strike using the detection pen and all were fake. I responded by letting her know that there are other features on a $100 bill to determine whether or not it is so indeed counterfeit. I honestly was not trying to cause any trouble or call Judith out on any misconduct, (granted the fact that she should have confiscated the $100 bill that she analyzed as counterfeit per proper protocol), I was simply trying to provide assistance and knowledge. Judith coldly and harshly responded, \"Oh yeah? In that case you want to come work here?\" \n\nAfter hearing Judith's response to the situation, it was time for me to close out my bill and leave. I too am in the Beverage and Food business, having managed 3 highly rated establishments in the Bay Area, (Mortar & Pestle, Pink Elephant, AC Waterfront Lounge). I was appalled by Judith's lack of professionalism and idiotic sarcasm. After this experience, I definitely will not return. And as one last piece of advice, per ABC standard, follow your bar dress code and wear some non-slip shoes. You might fall and slip at your bar with your Vans. \n\nHappy Easter!", "author": "Kenneth K."}

We arrived early in the evening around 9:30 on Friday so it wasn't busy yet. The bouncer was awesome and gave us some great info when he heard it was our first time there. Around 10:00 the DJ started playing and around 11:00 it started getting packed. The music was good; mainly what is on the radio right now. The crowd was dancing and singing and everyone was laid back. There was people dressed up and people dressed casual which was nice. Around 11:30 it was chaos. The whole upstairs was jam packed and it got really hard to move, let alone actually dance. The music was good though and the DJ played the music videos on multiple screens throughout the upstairs. This place is definitely great if you want to dance all night long! We are happy we found this place and will be back!", "author": "Jessica C."}

A couple of us had been here before and they liked it, I had not so I was down to go in and have some drinks. However, the bouncer didn't even let us in - he took about 5 mins looking at my Washington driver's license before declaring it fake and confiscating it. This was ridiculous, I've never been accused of using a fake ID before, let alone ever even needing one. Also, was he even allowed to just confiscate it like that? I had to argue with him just so I can get my driver's license back, but was still not allowed in. We finally gave up and just went a block up the street to another bar.\n\nReading the recent reviews here, I'm pretty disappointed this happened. It's sad that a bouncer isn't able to tell fake IDs from real ones, this guy must either be new or maybe I'm just unlucky. 2 of us with non-California licenses got bounced. Although, one of our other (non-Asian) friends was allowed in just a few moments later, despite also having a Washington license. Regardless of why this happened, I will not be coming back the next time I visit SF. Thank god there's plenty of other choices on Polk St!", "author": "Josh L."}

We hung out by the windows because it got hotter than Africa in the main bar area, and it was super fun looking down at all the Santas parading (euphemism for \"stumbling\") below. The bartenders here do a great job noticing everyone at the bar and serving drinks quickly even with a huge crowd! It was also a fun crowd, which could be due to SantaCon, but not as dicey as some spots on Polk where you're clutching your purse under your arm the whole time and waiting for the next fight to break out. \nThe floorplan of this joint makes zero sense. There is one (1) (uno) restroom for every sardine packed in here, located on the first floor in a little hallway next to the stairs. This means that the massive line will inevitably block traffic to the stairs and the rest of the downstairs area. I felt so bad for the security guard who had to consistently usher crowds away from the line. The stairs also made me super nervous, because they were so congested and were legitimately shaking from the amount of people packed onto them. Security tries to control the flow of traffic, but people posted up on the stairs and started partying there, which isn't cool for everyone trying to get through", "author": "Delaynie K."}

I'm GLAD we did and I definitely will be back! The line to get in was longer than you would anticipate anywhere on a Thursday night in SF, but thankfully we were able to get in quickly. (Memphis girls aren't used to the lovely weather we have here in SF.) Drinks were reasonably priced, and considering how many people were there the quick service from the bartenders upstairs was appreciated. The music selection by the DJ was great! A good mixture of genres that kept everyone moving. \n\nAfter 11, the dance floor upstairs was packed. Like, sardines packed. I went outside for some fresh air and noticed that some crazy young girl was literally ALL up in the door guy's face demanding that he give her ID back. Intrigued, I sit back and watch the show. Not even two minutes later, this girl's MOTHER is at her side cussing and threatening the guy for her daughter's ID. To my (and everyone who was watching with me) surprise, he was brushing them off with more patience than we all expected. When they were done with him, they went straight to the manager who was waiting for them a few feet away. Ding Ding, let round two begin! Mom and daughter are now tag-teaming the manager. I'm thinking, \"This is it! This crazy, rude, and obnoxious mom and daughter duo are about to get it, and my girls are upstairs missing it!\" Wrong. He acknowledges their anger and frustration but somehow manages to stay calm and patient throughout their entire exchange. Finally realizing that they weren't getting a rise out of him or the ID back, they both walked away, defeated. Hat's off to both of those guys for remaining professional and courteous, when they really didn't have to considering how insanely rude that mom and daughter were to them. \n\nMy only complaint is that if you go downstairs to use the restroom (which are all located on the ground floor) or outside for some air, you will have to wait in line a few minutes to get back upstairs to the dance floor.", "author": "Jessica M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-06-07", "description": "Walking along the lit up thoroughfare of the Polk Street nightlife, my friends and I were encouraged by the rumbling of fellow bar-goers that stumbled about. There are many good bars in the area, but one I had yet to visit had my eye, Playland Bar. A line around the corner, modern architecture, and beautiful black slate sign, I felt like I might meet a good time inside.\n\nAfter a 5-10 minute wait wait in line, I found myself face to face with a bouncer who assured me the $15 cover charge is worth it. We obliged out of semi-drunken curiosity, stamped ourselves in, and were ushered into a cool lower level bar where people mingled and met with arriving friends. I ventured around as my shoulders pressed back and forth between groups of people, and was quickly turned around as i unknowingly entered a private back room.\n\nNo matter, I wanted a drink, so I got one. Whiskey Sour ($12). As I waited for my drink, as did my friends, we found ourselves being pushed about by a drunken, self-entitled mess: \"the bathroom line\". Annoyed by the inadequate lack of space between different facets of the bar, I managed to get a drink in just a few minutes, and we headed toward the upper floor.\n\n\"Stop,\" A bouncer says to my friend. He asks my friend to remove his ball cap, as hats are apparently a form of gang symbol in the area. My friend was forced to hold his ball cap beside him the whole night.\n\nWe trudged upstairs in a flurry of people and came face to face with a medium-size dance floor style area with two small bars. We took toward the floor in a slow plod. Like air in a rubber balloon, as people began to enter though the middle of the dance floor, subsequent patrons were pushed outward. The sweat began to condense over the windows, flying elbows made drinks bob up and down like buoys in an ocean storm. When I came to a point of no further advancement, the dance floor seemed just out of reach, unattainable.\n\nWe decided to mingle elsewhere, and we found ourselves with a group of lovely young women who eyed us down with looks that seemingly spoke louder than words. Words have little effect here as the music on the upper level blares above most conversational volume; all the more reason to dance to keep things from getting awkward. After we shared some of our drinks with them, they began to advance on us in a way that ousted a knee-jerk reaction from my friend:  \"I'll buy shots!\"\n\nHe paid an ungodly amount of money for five or six shots, and the women quickly faded into the sweaty abyss of Playland like Jack Dawson into the Atlantic. With hope of finding our way back to the dance floor, we sought out the other upper level bar for more liquid encouragement, and hopefully some conversation. \n\nI bought another Whiskey Sour, because, well, it was a damn good drink. However, this time it cost me $15, which I tried to fix with the bartender, a woman who had little bereavement for the mistake. My friend was given the wrong amount of change as well, so it gave me the impression of someone capitalizing on drunken customers. (An impression, nothing more.) However, based on the quality of the second Whiskey Sour (piss poor), I'm convinced there was either some neglect by the staff, or they were testing out a new trainee.\n\nAfter speaking to some beautiful older women out on a bachelorette party, it took us till nearly 12:30-1PM until we could manage enough room for adequate dancing.  Before that, dancers are subject to the sweltering heat of the looming sweat-fog and the jabbing of butt shoves from men with confusingly hostile temperaments.\n\nWe left the bar in an Uber with little desire to return.

That risk is just looking for a place for a good drink but I am very selective in that category but I wasn't planning to go out on a Wednesday night but yesterday evening, I've met one Canadian named Amanda and one Australian at the downtown hostel and we just click and decided to go bar hopping. So we just went around town looking for places and drink but there was one that stood out and we had to check Playland Bar out. I'd like the low light theme and as a photographer it was well lit. Now about Christian the bartender Wednesday night (last night). What an amazing guy and what he was doing at the bar was extremely cool with the hand skills and tricks but not only that, he made some nice and beautiful drinks. I'd like an IPA beer and my IPA was good and not flat like the last place we visit before Playland but my new hostel friends wanted mix drinks this time around. I had a very interested and fun time at playland. We were all upstair and didn't get a chance to visit the downstairs level to check it out. The lighting was excellent and I would love to take some photos of the place and that was the plan in a way from the next day but I can't, maybe next time. The space is good for groups or for a date if you are on one. There are two restrooms on the first level but I am not sure for the lower level but I'd have confident in Playland to have two more. This will be mine place to just hangout with I am not doing work and will just have a drink or two. I'm not a party person that much and just like to keep things smooth and relax. Maybe this is the place for you and maybe it's not and I am not   doing this for the place at all but doing this to share an experience with you and maybe you will decided on your own if this place is good or not. As I said before, it may not or maybe the place you are looking for. So the total time we were there was about 25-45 minutes talking and drinking and feeling good. So it was a very pleasant experiences  and hope you have one of the same.\n\nEnjoy", "author": "Keiki-Alexander D."}

When my friends and I waltzed in early on a Friday night (9PM ish), we managed to get in for free. Downstairs was pretty populated but the upstairs area was nearly empty save for a few people floating by the bar or the couches along the wall. Typical dim lighting, sticky wooden floors, and an almost disused look to it. We took up camp on the stage at the back because there were couches available and we were fascinated by the R&B throwback music videos playing on the two TV screens. First impression? A random chill R&B lounge.\n\nAs the music transitioned into modern pop hits more people straggled in to join our awkward dancing. We were also kicked off the stage because it's apparently reserved for not-so-private parties, guarded by red ropes and bouncers. The bartenders were fun-loving and eager to dance while mixing our drinks, adding to the increasingly lively atmosphere. By about 11PM when the DJ phased into EDM, the top floor was essentially a dance club, with barely enough room for various staff to squeeze past the writhing bodies. Which they did REALLY often. \n\nAnyways, crowd is nice for the most part but prepare to stand your ground against a few aggressive dancers as usual.", "author": "Helen S."}

We have never been accused of using fakes especially because ours are actually real. He stated that having us in the bar would be a liability. \nWhen my roommate proceeded to defend our friend and try to reason with the bouncer, he repeatedly referred to her in demeaning pet names like \"baby\" and \"sweetheart,\" even though she politely asked him to stop because her name was Olivia. Once she grew tired of it, she asked to please speak to the manager and he informed us that they had no manager on duty. \nAll in all, even he recognized he was being unnecessarily disrespectful to all of us yet made no attempts to stop his abusive behavior.

Just because my pants weren't skin tight and were barely sitting below my waist they didn't let me in? I then proceed to slightly pull up my pants and tighten my belt. If I was intentionally sagging it would have been called out right away and they wouldn't have had to ask I felt profiled. The security guards told my friends who were inside that people have been getting there phones stolen so I guess they are profiling people in hopes of reducing this, because security said that is why they are being strict. If more than one person on yelp feels they have been profiled by this place it must be true. Then the security guard proceeds to tell me that the Manager is on duty and is watching the cameras and called me out and that if he wasn't there he would've let me in. In addition to this while I am pleading my case to go in I see a person come out of Playland sagging and with a hat on and soccer jersey and my friends who were inside later on tell me they saw people sagging and dressed way more casually than I was inside.

We gloriously took over the James Polk Room in the back of the bottom floor, where our lovely bartender, Yana, showed us her amazing bartending skills. \n\nShe makes the best bullet bourbon Manhattans and made my friend a really nice tequila old fashion, which I had for the first time. Exceptional. The lighting was dim and the music was chill, so it was a perfect environment for catching up with friends before beast mode. \n\nCome beast mode, we went upstairs and basically took over again, slowly forming our little dance circle that everyone eventually hates but wants to join. We couldn't help it, the DJ was on point with his mainstream/house playlist. Even I got down, and I usually don't get down because I'd rather eat Hot Cheetos.\n\nYou never know what to expect on Polk street in terms of quality women, but at Playland you can always expect to find cute and classy chicks that love to dance. I would attribute this to great DJ's, the quality drinks, the cover they charge men, and the seats they make available to people who don't care for VIP tables. \n\nAt the end of the night, we waited outside and gathered up all the wounded members and even the bouncers were chill and polite. This was impressive because if you've ever been to Ruby Sky, you'd agree with me then buy me a drink.  \n\nPlayland is a great spot if you are with a group and want solid cocktails at an affordable price in a sexy club scene. Otherwise you can go to Ruby Sky and get crappy cocktails at a ridiculous price and be overwhelmed by dudes and stuck up bouncers. \n\nI also recommend Topsy's bar on Kearny street which is under the same ownership.", "author": "Jesse W."}

I think we showed up around 10PM and expected to be at Playland for a little and bounce around Polk St but we ended up staying all night! The bar upstairs is usually packed but they move pretty quick.\n\nThere is a downstairs which feels more like a lounge and then an upstairs which is more like a club with some pretty great throwback music videos that play but it is pretty typical with sticky counters and dim lighting. We stayed upstairs in their \"VIP\" area since we were a large group and no one was there so we just danced around by ourselves until the place filled up which is did by about 11:30! Then we got our fair share of groups that wanted to congratulate the bride (since we were wearing bridesmaid headbands) and leave some single guys with us which isn't really my idea of a good time but they were definitely good sports. Somehow the DJ caught on that our group was from Miami and a lot of Pitbull and Enrique got played.....\n\nOverall, it was pretty great for us. We danced the night away and had plenty of drinks and was a better experience than I have had there in the past.

It has two levels, with the upstairs hosting a cramped dance floor playing modern pop hits. \n\nI showed up around 9:45, which is absurdly early apparently because I was greeted with a nearly empty club. All the bartenders upstairs were eager to take my drink order, and my friend and I sat at a table for about twenty minutes commenting on the lack of people, debating about whether or not we should leave and try another spot, and getting distracted by the big screen televisions playing music videos. \n\nWe eventually started talking to someone in our vicinity and the place suddenly filled to the brim with people. It was like a torrential flood of people came through the doors ready to down shots of Fireball and grind on random people on the dance floor. I decided to attempt to dance with my friend, but it was so packed we could barely move, and guys came at us from every angle trying to ask us questions which we couldn't hear over the excessively loud tunes. We decided to venture downstairs, which was significantly less packed but had a completely different vibe. We went back upstairs and decided to get another drink, which was shockingly easy and quick given there is only one bar upstairs and the place was packed. The bartenders actually remembered us, which I appreciated. Not the best experience but certainly not a bad night.", "author": "Emily D."}

I highly recommend this back space for anyone who wants to reserve the space.\n\nThe rest of the bar and dance floor is insanely packed since it has gotten increasingly popular lately.

If you go up to the second floor you will find a club like atmosphere with a DJ and about 2-3 bars. We were here on a Friday night and it was PACKED with people. People pouring drinks, laughing, jumping, and honestly, really having a great time. I was able to meet up with my friends and had a couple of shots with my boyfriend at the bar. Although I am being shoved left and right, I tried to enjoy the scenery and environment. A couple of strangers came up and tried to strike up a conversation, I played along to do the same.\n\n5 minutes into being on the second floor, my friend finds that her iphone has been stolen. After searching the floors we find out that another girl has had her phone stolen out of her purse. This place was so packed that there was nothing that we could do to find the phones again. Someone had obviously been going around nabbing phones from girls purpose. Not cool. \n\nI am not blaming the business itself for losing the phone, there was little that they could do. The place was so packed though that there was little space to move around. The place felt very much above capacity and it made it difficult even for people to stand around. \n\nThe employees could do little about it and then they started to move us out to the street.

This place is located on Polk which is cool because you can go bar hopping. I wasnt able to experience it but it was coo. Supposedly on a regular day, girls get in for free and guys would have to pay a bit but that night everyone paid. They jacked up the prices as the night continued so I had to pay $40 to get in which is ridiculous. Happy new year indeed. I do not believe there is a guestlist so just show up and get in line. The crowd is mostly white which is totally different than the asian club scene. What a contrast indeed. What I did like was the music. It is totally different than the Raven I am used to with the old school hip hop and pop. This place played current music like Dont Tell Em and the stuff you would hear on the radio. I have to come back on a regular night and update this review and experience the Polk. There are two floors and the dance floor is quite small but doable.

My first experience- liked the music, appreciated the space, and thought the bartender was awesome. I had a cucumber martini here that is the second best I've ever tasted. When I mentioned to my friend how the numero uno still haunts me, the bartender slid over and topped off my bevvy with a little St. Germain to taste like the best cucumber martini ever made. I thought that was sweet. \n\nThe second and third time I came, however, I was a little put off. Service has slipped. This last visit my friend and I waited quite a while for our drinks to be ordered, and I waited so long that I actually gave up and just sat down with friends to chat. The bartender was texting! And the bar-back was watching! To be fair, it may have been for business, but call me crazy, I love a good multitasking bartender/bar-back team. Then they were out of the beer my friend wanted, then they had no cold bottles of the second beer of request. Blah. \n\nThe third time... I am sorry to say, but men were getting served with far more charm and attention, and while I believe that every bar has to have a shtick, I was put off by the clear play for tips from dudes while the ladies of the bar were treated like children interrupting adult conversation. C'mon, this place isn't run by amateurs, I've seen better service here! \n\nI'm not saying I've crossed them off the list forever, because there is something about that huge Spanish Bull on the wall that makes me dream of Pamplona, but I hope the service improves next time.", "author": "Kelly B."}

Now I know how trumped up that series is so I had to come check it out for myself. I have been to a ton of clubs and had somehow missed this one. \n\nI have to get this out of the way first. I don't know if it was just the night we went but I felt like I was in the Castro. I want this to be clear to guys and girls that go here. First there was a majority gay males there when we went like two out of every three guys. And I truly don't have any issue with it but guys that are looking for a club spot might want to know that this is the clientele it attracts. On the other hand women may also want to know this for a couple reasons. \n\nFirst if you are looking to NOT get grinded on. To enjoy of fun night of dancing with your girls. Dance around some flamboyantly awesome gay guys then you are going to love playland and to be honest I get why girls would want this for a little bit after going through the meat markets of Vertigo and Mayes. But its just not as fun. No one is really dancing with each other and it kind of turns into a crowded standing fest. \n\nSecond if you ARE looking to get grinded on it didn't seem to be happening here. We left around midnight as it started to get packed and we saw several of the groups of women from playland at Mayes getting down later that night. \n\nAnd that kind of encapsulates this place. Its a safe fun starter night type establishment but if you want to have a real dance club experience you go somewhere else. Its good for a meeting up with four or five friends and some innocent dancing but don't we all want a little bit of regret in our night out? This is a little too safe and bland. \n\nI have to admit though. Maybe it was just the night we went but good god. The women were absolutely gorgeous. Like the best we have seen in this city. Probably they felt safer here than other establishments but as guys were felt like we have found the holy grail. It was glorious and then sad because they were stuck in this place. \n\nThey charge a five dollar cover for guys which I am cool with I get it and then having to pay ten later to go to Mayes is a bummer but some might stick it out all night. The downstairs was a regular bar setup with fewer people. Upstairs is where the party is with a couple of bars and great bartenders. The floor was big enough to get a good number of people dancing without feeling too crowded like Vertigo but not as fun as Mayes' floor. \n\nThe DJ was okay. If you are into EDM then this is your thing. A lot of mashups and safe music but no hip hop to be found. \n\nThere were a lot of bouncers there for such a small space so you should feel safe and sound when you head into play land. \n\nOverall for a danceclub/bar this place is right in the middle. If this sounds like your clientele you are going to have a blast. If you are on the fence at all there are much better places to check out on Polk that will guarantee a good time. \n\nI must say so long to all the gorgeous women at Play land for I am sure I will ever see you all again if you only go here but it was a blessed sight while it lasted.

I went on a Friday night with a big group of friends. Let me start off by sayin I'm no thug, or lowlife, I'm an upstanding citizen and when I got out I spend money at whatever establishment I go to. When we approached Playland Bar the doorman said I couldn't come in because of the dress code. I was wearing black pants a nice shirt and Timberlands. I looked inside and most people were in jeans and t shirts so I asked what he meant and he said my shoes weren't allowed it. Again I looked inside and most of the patrons were wearing tennis shoes, slip on vans, I even saw one guy in there with smiles face emojis all over his shoes. Not in a rude way, I went up o the door man, who by the way was wearing black and red Jordans (which he looked too old to be wearing anyway) and I asked him \"vans are allowed but not Timbs?\" To which he Rudely and confrontationally said \"are you wearing Timbs? They obviously we don't allow Timbs\". I don't want to sound like a snob, but I could have bought 5 pairs of Vans for the price my Timbs were. The door guy had a weird power trip over a bar and I took my business elsewhere. Too to anyone that has a similar encounter walk down to Vertigo. No dick on a power trip at the door and good music.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-05-07", "description": "Unless I'm truly blown back in my seat I never like to 5-star a joint on my first visit so I would usually go with four until I've seen it on 3 or 4 different nights of the week. I'm going to make an exception because this spot is new and they need the publicity - plus the owners did a first-rate remodel.\n\nI'll start by saying this is definitely *not* the old Kimo's. Playland is its own experience and stands up nicely along side the other swanky ambiance bars on the Polk Gulch stretch (Lush Lounge, Royal Oak, Amelie, Zeki's). It is a split level bar, though the upstairs does't open until May 10th.\n\nPlayland is named after the old Ocean Beach amusement park ( http://goo.gl/lm4NP ) and will have loads of fun theme decorations when the owners finish it up.\n\nWhere a bar like Eve is trying very hard to convey a Victorian/Gothic feel, or to be a high end Harlot, Playland succeeds at an elegant down-tempo sort of Steampunk. Rosewood, copper accents, and wall to wall dark paneling (large rivets) give an Edison/Tesla sort of feel to the place, complete with vacuum tube lighting in the alcoves behind the liquor shelves.\n\nMy drink was well mixed, if a bit on the pricey side at around $8.60 for a Mandarin Cranberry (they only had Ketel Orange). The bar & door staff was friendly and the light Sunday evening crowd was diverse, as you might expect on an off-night in this part of town. I had a great chat about the changing neighborhood with a tattooed Mexican guy with a bright smile. I noted the standard Polk street crowd in the center of the bar, and a guy working on his laptop at a table by the window.\n\nI stopped by Playland for two reasons. For one, my brother's SEO Firm (Kickstart Search) had been contacted to do a very basic website for them so I was curious what kind of a venue they had put together. The other is that I was waiting on a large pizza at Victor's, half a block away, and had a puppy with me. I was looking in from outside, checking out the spot, and the bartender waved me in saying my small dog was ok.\n\nCheck, immediate star for a dog friendly bar.\n\nThey also have two gorgeous LED TVs in high definition at the downstairs bar and will have more upstairs. It looks like a great game spot.\n\nOnly time will tell what Playland becomes. They will be opening the upstairs this week, at which point the layout should feel like a smaller version of Raven Bar (1151 Folsom). As a result, this will be yet another venue packed to the gills with 20-somethings on Thursday, Friday and Saturday night. If that isn't your scene, then you probably aren't on Polk those nights anyhow.\n\nThe Bush & Polk Garage ($2/hr - closes at 10 on week nights, 2 on Fri/Sat, closed Sunday) is your closest workable parking location. Just be very aware of the hours of operation.\n\nAs for the rest of the week, if you don't mind the higher-end drink prices and feel like an alternative to the nearby Lush Lounge, Playland is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood.\n\n--\n\nUpdate: having toured the upstairs I now know that the a/v system is stellar. The floor to ceiling windows offer a beautiful view of the bustle on Polk street and it should be a particularly nice vantage point right around sunset. The stage area includes two 60\" LED televisions and the bar has several beers on tap from keg lines downstairs. There's really nothing else like this North of Market and the owners are making a real effort to avoid having it fall into a top-40 niche upstairs. They are even booking a burlesque accordion band to play there.\n\nAgain, it takes time for a venue to develop a personality (the reviewer behind me had a nice time trolling the clientele before the Grand Opening even occurred) but the ingredients are there for Playland to develop a fun one.\n\nAs for a hands-on approach, this was the first time I was personally contacted by a venue owner to thank me for the level of detail in a review. Say what you will about the style of the decor and the future band choices but the owners are a real class act.", "author": "Ian A."}

The ambiance of the bar was great! Kind of dark, interesting and fun mix of people, and fantastic music. Literally the only downside was this super awkward air that was blowing in our faces at different areas. When you get to a bar, you really shouldn't be COLD. But I guess it makes sense because every time we took a break from dancing, the air felt really nice. But the air should be on the dance floor...definitely not right next to the bar where people are talking and hanging out (and thus, probably not dancing/hot). Buttt sorry for that digression, amazing ambiance! Just crowded enough to not make you want to kill yourself but not so deserted that you think you're at the wrong place. \n\nDrinks: Decently priced and really sweet bartenders! There is a $20 minimum for credit cards though, so watch out if you don't have cash. Also I asked the lady to make my $17 total for two drinks into $20 to let me use my credit card...and she made it $20.89. Kind of annoying because I didn't ask her to make it higher than $20 but it's okay I was having a really good night :) \n\nBottle Service: A friend of a friend's got our group bottle service and it was amazing! We got the area in the front of the dance floor with couches, and enjoyed our night with handles of Grey Goose, orange juice and cranberry juice and tons of dancing :) Definitely pricey, but also easily made our night infinitely more enjoyable (and less crowded). \n\nVerdict: GO GO GO! It's also around a ton of other bars so a perfect place to bar hop and there's also good food in the area open super late (Bob's donuts or Mel's Diner, both good options) so it's a great place to be at night! Also no cover (not sure if this is only for girls) but yay! And the bouncers are all super nice, so you don't feel at all annoyed or weirded out.", "author": "Anu P."}

Downstairs is small and great for individual or smaller gathering (that is if you can snag a table) but we needed a bigger setting so we went upstairs and was able to have our own designated area with great upbeat music, courteous bartender, and scenic view overlooking Polk Street. There is a good selection of cocktail choices and I found my favorite..the Strawberry Basil Martini! A phenomenal cocktail ..very tasty and goes down smooth. We stayed longer when the place becomes party central after 10:30 pm. This is when everyone awakes from their nap after work or had their dinner and is now ready to party and burn off their calories! You won't be sitting at all since the DJ mixes all your favorite music from top 40/Hip Hop to Old School. Overall, this playground is definitely a great looking place. It's a more intimate feeling than other clubs downtown or SOMA. \n\nI highly recommend this place for happy hour, cocktails, and dancing. An improvement over the old dingy Kimo's. \n\nTo the party people\n\nPros:\n1) Great place to drink, talk, flirt, and be in pleasant company with friends and strangers\n2) Good crowd control, still packed but not to the point where it's unbearable\n3) No cover charge!\n\nCons:\nNone - negativity gives negative outcomes to oneself\n\nThey also have clear plasma TVs for sports and hope they have special gatherings for Super Bowl, World Series, Summer Olympics, and PPV boxing.

I asked him where the sign was and he said someone must have taken it because he put it out at 8 when he got there. Funny bc we had been there since 9 and upstairs was empty I guess one of the other two people up there must have removed all the signs for the tables. I called him out on his lies and he was just so rude to us. He then proceeded to tell me I can take my business elsewhere if I am unhappy. So we did, we left immediately. The area didn't even look like a bottle service seating area it looked like a free for all seating. I'm sorry but play land is nothing special where you need a bottle service area it's a joke.Someone needs to teach this fool how to properly ask people to move, don't lie about it and don't be a dick.\n\n\nSo two stars because upstairs played good music and AC was on full blast upstairs which was nice when it started to get crowded and all the body heat.", "author": "Krista R."}

There is an upstairs and downstairs and either way you go you can't go wrong. This is a good place to go if your looking to socialize and have a beer or a drink and just be in the city life but not go to crazy. The bartenders are all attractive so that's never a bad thing. I went around 10pm, no cover which was great and the bouncer was fun as we waited in line which made the wait feel shorter than it actually was. We went straight upstairs since everyone looked to get stuck downstairs. It became a bit challenging to get upstairs since everyone was right by the bar but just be a bit forceful you'll get through. The drinks are reasonable but there is a $20 minimum on credit cards which sucks because that's all I use. The shots looked pretty small from what I'm used to seeing but I didn't get one so it maybe the same amount I just didn't try it. They have tv's showing music videos of all modern music which is fun since you get to sing along when you know the song.

I would have to thank not only atmosphere, but also the bar tender Jessica, who took wonderful care of me while I was there. Jessica was attentive and \"on the ball\" when it came to the drinks. She was friendly and a blast to chat with, she really has mastered her craft! \n\nWell done Playland!\nYou will be sure to see me in the next coming week! \n\nMolly", "author": "molly c."}

She takes really good care of all the customers and is very quick i getting your drinks. She experiments with new drinks and they come out fantastic.\nI've been here on days she's not working and honestly it's a bit dull on those days, but still a great place to hang out and grab a few drinks with friends.\nOverall a fantastic place. Cheers!!!", "author": "Harry S."}

Great venue with a happening vibe right on the corner of Polk and Pine. Had a great conversation with the bartender Natasha who was very friendly, courteous, and exhibited great  customer service. I will definitely be making this place one of my regular spots", "author": "Walter W."}

I've been here on either Friday or Saturday nights and their DJ's are usually awesome.  The top floor gets a little too hot and all the windows are completely steamed up by 10:30ish but it's still super fun.  You can always go downstairs or outside to cool down.  I recommend you try this place if you enjoy dancing!", "author": "Eugenia S."}

Playland is not the only bar I frequent, but it is my favorite bar in SF.  Please do not go here so I can have it all to myself.", "author": "Chris A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-07", "description": "I was fortunate to be touring the Polk Street night scene with a veteran who knew about Playland.   This place sits on Polk Street in the heart of the fooding and drinking district.  In contrast to the neighboring bars, Playland has huge panoramic windows that give it a nice transparent feel.   A nice change from drinking in a windowless dive - of which there are numerous establishments to do just that nearby.   The bartenders appear to have been handpicked for, among other things, having well-conditioned hair - aesthetics are definitely important to the management.  Which fits with the well-groomed and appointment contemporary interior.  The lighting was nicely dim and well-planned.  As the evening went on, this place transitioned from a cheery loud crowd to almost a nightclub level of noise and activity.  The bartenders were super attentive, which on a busy night was very much appreciated.   Despite all the craze, they were constantly checking in and making sure we were good.  Great work, Playland bartenders - for that alone 5 stars! :-)", "author": "Jaydee B."}

Totally not worth it. Please...do yourself a favor, walk a block down, and go to Kozy Kar.", "author": "Kat M."}

I don't remember what occurred at Playland, but what does come to mind is Polk st. and a nice upstairs area. We got prime parking right outside and decided to mosey on in because the name was so appealing! Haha. Anyways, went upstairs and I was really impressed they had such a spacious upstairs with plenty of natural sunlight due to a million windows. I don't know what the crowd was like but that's because we were the only people upstairs which was nice....it was like a private party. Haha. Anyways my friends and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and would probably come here again.", "author": "Jackie M."}
