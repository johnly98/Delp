The fallout of their previous business turned out to be a blessing in disguise. \n\nTheir Egg Tart (dan tat) is the best on the West side of San Francisco mainly because of their flaky crust.  The egg filling is good also, but plenty of bakeries can deliver good egg fillings. Even I can make decent eggy fills.  However, they've got the perfect crust, together with smooth egg fills, and $1 price, I always buy by the dozen.\n\nTheir Portuguese Egg Tart (po tat) has creamy egg fills, like that of creme brulee but without a hard caramel top.  It ain't pretty without the candy top since the top skin chars and thickens from high heat.  The crust is more doughy than it's cousin but that's how it is.  Mr Bread does a good job on this product as well.  Be that as it may, due to the extra creamy calories and heaviness, I control myself on this one.  Cost $1.50", "author": "Connie W."}

Also, very inexpensive.\n\nWe had to make a second check-in there before we left SF.

When I used to live out in the Richmond, it was easy to choose a Chinese bakery - Golden Chariot. Now that we live in the Outer Sunset, it's been a struggle. However, we noticed Mr. Bread recently pop up and we instantly had to try it. We're glad we did! Below are the hot buns we usually get:\n\nCurry Bun - Soooo delicious. Never had a curry bun before, but such a different bun when you're tired of eating the same old chau siu bao. The bread is the same as used in the baked pork bun, with curry beef in place of chau siu. This is the perfect combination of sweet and savory.\n\nPortuguese tart / Egg Tart - My wife loves the po-tats here, but I'm not a fan of any po-tats in general. Their egg tarts are very good and flakiness is on point. Overall though, not better than Golden Chariot.\n\nPhoenix Bun - They're okay. Not very oiley, but not much flavor. I would say they're average.\n\nPineapple bun - Delicious. Bread is soft, crust is flaky. So much flavor in this thing. They're best when they come straight out of the oven. But that's pretty much a given for any bao.\n\nPork Bun - Better than average! I only buy the baked ones here. (Not sure if they have steamed actually). If I recall correctly, they don't put the paper beneath the bun. Which is appreciated when I'm super hungry. No soggy paper getting between my teeth when I'm in full blown hangry mode.\n\nHot Milk tea - we get this less sweet. It's a perfect complement to all baos and they always give it to us in to-go carriers, which is super helpful.", "author": "Kevin C."}

However, when the lease was up, the owners moved over to the other side of 19th avenue. \n\nOverall, there are buns that Mr. Bread does very well, and buns that are only so-so. I'd recommend ordering the BBQ pork buns and the egg tarts - These are consistently the best buns in the San Francisco area. It's best to eat them while they are hot and fresh out of the oven (go in the AM if possible). I've noticed a dramatic difference between eating them right when I purchased the buns and waiting 2 hours later. The coconut bun, taro bun, and pineapple bun are so-so. I'll probably try the curry beef bun next time because I enjoyed that when I frequented Victor's Bakery in the past. \n\nService is also prompt and friendly-ish. Bonus points if you can speak Cantonese. \n\nOVERALL: Bring cash. Order the BBQ pork bun and egg-tarts. Eat them while they're hot and fresh (it makes a huge difference).", "author": "Nicole J."}

So depending on design the one I got cost me around $135 for a 6in cakes & the other cakes design cause me $170 for a 6in also. When ordering she only has one type of flavor cake which is Vanilla. HERES THE CATCH: the cake doesn't taste like how it look unfortunately :( her custom cake tasted so so dry within the first 2 bites you need something to wash it down with. For flavor wise it taste like a stale/hard sponge cake with very little flavor. Between the layer it's very little amount of buttercream. So I was very disappointed:( when I ask her to put more buttercream on my next cake she can't because she say the fondant won't hold to well :/ I wanted to cancel my second cake design after that but couldn't becauSe I already put down a deposit :( this place is not cheap just really disappointed about the taste & flavor of the cake. DONT BE LIKE ME DONT LET THE DESIGN ON HER PAGE FOOL YOU INTO ORDERING ONE. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. I WARN YA! HOPE THIS HELP! \n\nOVERALL:\nIf you think to order a customize cake here just know that what you are paying for is just the look of the cake not the taste. I would pay an extra $20 to get it customize elsewhere at least I know it'll will not only look good but also taste good.  I don't know if her tradition Asian style fruit cake is good or not I never try it so I can't give any judgment on that. However her custom cupcakes was pretty good. Not too sweet at all.

I raved about this place to everyone but the last 2 occasions I was disappointed.  On mother days I ordered 2 cakes one is light and fluffy (very good),  one is dense (not good). Just last week I got another cake it was dense and dried (so bad).  Please stay consistent.", "author": "Lu L."}

The store is quite small but the workers are really friendly. The pastries are pretty good and the price is average for a Chinese bakery. One thing disgusts me. They have cupcakes that say happy mother's day on it which means it's obviously a few months old! That's disgusting. But everything else is fresh! I would recommend the banana cake. It's the best", "author": "Carissa C."}

The crust was not soggy and the fillings had the right amount of sweetness. The price was right too. I bought some lao puo bing for my aunt and she said they were not too sweet and delicious. Smaller shop but plenty of options. They offer custom decorated cakes too which looked impressive.", "author": "Angel D."}

These are by far my favorite go to treat when I feel the sweet tooth kicking in. If it wasn't for calories and sugar I'd probably eat them everyday.

I used to swing by Victor's semi-regularly and was therefore thrilled to see the announcement about Mr. Bread opening on Hoodline.  Brought a batch back for family breakfast and my girls devoured the coconut bun, the hot dog bun, the ham and egg bun and - of course - egg tarts!   The char siu bao was still warm from the oven.", "author": "Jan C."}

I ordered varieties of pastries.\n\nPortuguese egg tart - it has nothing to do with traditional portuguese egg tart like the ones in Macau. The taste is just like regular egg tart.   \n\nEgg tart - it was just ok. The tart shell is so thin. I like thicker shell which has thousand of layer to make it more flaky. \n\nCurry Beef Bun - This bun is the best in town.  The curry beef fillings were spicy and smells great.  My hubby normally doesnt eat bun, but he likes it. \n\nBBQ pork pastry - I hate mushy filling with lots of pork fat in it, but this bun has lot of meat in it that I really like.\n\nPineapple Bun - it was just so so. It was not soft enough.\n\nPineapple Bun with red bean paste - Lots of red bean paste in it and it wasnt so sweet.", "author": "Brielle K."}

I love cake so I decided on a slice of strawberry shortcake. The slice was wrapped in plastic but the cake and cream were not fresh, very dry. I guess I should have known from the presentation in the display case. There was a variety of slices scattered on a tray. I doubt I would go back.", "author": "Melissa C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-07-05", "description": "I love the egg tarts and Portuguese egg tarts here. The egg tarts have a nice flaky crust and aren't overwhelmingly sweet, and the custard has a nice texture. The Portuguese ones have a different, sweeter crust (a bit like kougin amann - it's layered with caramelized sugar), the custard is sweeter, and it has a bruleed top. Personally I find it a little too sweet, but it's delicious, so whatever. They're delicious warm or at room temperature, and it's almost impossible to stop at eating just one.", "author": "Em F."}

Discovered this place by accidentally parking in front of it last month and have been coming 1-2-3 times a week.  Notables are the oft mentioned Egg Tarts, regular and Portuguese.  Golden Gate's tart is a 10, hands down.  Mr. Bread's a solid 8.5 + a 1.5 for the option of sitting down with a cup of decent coffee and enjoying a warm egg tart right out of the oven.  Tart + Experience = 10.  But there's more !  The curry beef pastry was surprisingly delicious.  And there's even more !  The lemon sponge cake roll ... divine.  Soft, perfectly lemony, hint of sugar but not too sweet and moist, moist, moist.  Yes, the egg tarts are on point but other items are on point !  This afternoon they were out of curry beef pastry so I opted for the curry beef bun only to come home and bite into a tuna bun.  Yep, add it to the even-more list.  Excellent tuna bun.  Not mushy, good amount of celery for the crunch and egg white.  Always happy to support small family owned business but not always able to leave 5 STAR review.  This place is dangerously close to home/work and my world is better for it.", "author": "Beautiful B."}
