There was free valet parking for the restaurant but there was an event next door (9/28) so there was a cop telling us we couldn't even pull into Osso, I think he thought we were trying to park on the street to get into the special event. Because it was heavy traffic we didn't even have the time to roll down our windows and explain to him we were trying to get to valet, so we ended up paying $35 special event parking at the garage, even though we didn't even go to the event. Ugh. Not a good way to start the night, but I knew this wasn't the fault of the restaurant so I went on to enjoy my dinner and that I did. \n\nThe highlight of it all was the potato side. The entire time I was eating them I was wondering why they were so good, kind of sweet and I think I figured it out! They seasoned them with furikake, I had never had anything like it and it works soooo well. I've been thinking about these potatoes ever since I left. For my steak choice I got the filet mignon medium and it was perfectly cooked just how I like it. \n\nThe service was superb our waiter was super friendly and gave us order suggestions as it was our first time (definitely not our last!).", "author": "Alexa A."}

Front desk staff were very accommodating and professional from the time I booked to showing up. \nThe menu and food here were very similar to many steak houses I've been. \nOsso gets a generous 2 stars solely based on service.  Our waiter was clearly under the influence of something.  He totally forgot what we ordered and then had our table mixed up with another. We were very patient with him, but something was clearly getting in the way of him doing his job. \nI was hosting a party of 8, and they were getting very annoyed. I eventually got up and asked the manager to give us a different server.  The new server was a lot better, but he was not very happy about the reassignment. However, everything worked out okay and my guests were satisfied \nOverall, I would say Osso was a charming and warm restaurant at first, but the service was average to poor at best.  The food was quite good. My guests were happy with their selections.  I ordered the scallops, which were very tasty and presented very nicely on the plate. But for a high-end steakhouse, Osso was very disappointing.  It's possible that I experienced an off night. This can happen anywhere. Unfortunately with vast selection of other restaurants in the area, it will be very hard for me to visit or recommend Osso.", "author": "Ray M."}

I went to make a reservation online around 4pm, and noticed their availability was completely open for two people.  I could not make a reservation as the internet signal was poor, so i figured oh well there will be nobody there even.\n\nWe stopped by the front desk and two women greeted us, they asked if we had a reservation i said \"No\".  So she leads us back to this completely depressing area of the restaurant with the sun shining in our eyes, and really worn out carpet, yikes.  We asked for a booth and she told us there reservations were completely booked so we could not have a booth or sit in the main dining area, we were well aware these were alternative facts. \n\nThen we decided to sit in the bar instead, the wine tasted like it was recorked and left to sit overnight for a $25 glass of Jordan, horrible.  Couldn't even open a fresh glass for that price, it tasted horrible.  The bartended was far to busy to be bothered anyhow was the impression he was giving off to the guests.\n\nOn top of that we were sitting at the bar and overhead two men come in to the front desk where they were asked if they had a reservation and they said no.  And then were seated in a booth, hahaha, me and my wife just started cracking up about how poor their service was. What a joke.\n\nThe customer service was horrible by the curly haired lady at the front, we ended up going to the Top of the Mark and spending almost $300 on wine and dinner instead, we just could not justify spending the money at Osso steakhouse due to the poor customer service interaction.", "author": "Ian G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-16", "description": "Perfect storm meal.\n\nThis restaurant brings back some memories, mostly good other than the unexpected closing of the previous dining establishment here.  Originally a satellite location of the North Beach breakfast staple Mama's, this unassuming restaurant housed the 2nd location of a low key Mission District restaurant named Watergate.  This was a frequent family special occasion spot that offered palate pleasing food at reasonable prices.  Their signature dish was a lobster martini which I have not seen since the tragic passing of the chef owner.  \n\nFast forward about eight years later, a restaurant group made the commitment to revive this spot as a steak house.  Watching the popular public TV restaurant review show, my friend and I made a point to find time to check it out (about a year after it was talked about on said show).  I made a weeknight reservation for three.  They offer valet parking but we found a legal space on California Street a half block away.  My friend had a large truck which the valet refused to drive as it would not fit their garage.  As a result, he was about a half hour late while looking for a suitable space.  Our waiter was patient and understanding as well as the restaurant manager who told us it was no problem (being tardy).  When he arrived, my other dining friend and I had already planned the appetizers so it didn't take long for us to order our entrees a short time later. \n\nHere's what I tried:\n\nAppetizers, shared\n1. Crispy kettle bread (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bKqfSQu16FTdEegNsUrdlA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - What's not to like about steaming hot bread served on a pan with creamy rich butter?!  \n\n2. Chorizo cheese bread (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=oaNb7SBtrZis38bUSKg78Q&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - This is the highly touted one that is often mentioned in reviews.  Being rich and cheesy, it was expectedly oily and heavy.  It did pair well with the above kettle bread as we dipped that in the sauce to make the original one lighter.\n\nEntree\n3. Bone in filet mignon (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4Dh72hIt5JErip4qcslvTw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Photograph wise, this is not that impressive, but once you cut into it and start eating...  The meat was melt in mouth tender, cooked to a perfect medium rare... juicy and soft.  That's why you eat a filet, right?!\n\nSides, shared\n4. Crispy vegetables and potatoes (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=9Up2WEouo1OEZPABL_lJGg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - This was more exciting as its description as everything was nicely roasted in herbs, perfectly seasoned to complement our individual steaks.  The portion is generous so definitely have an appetite or at least three diners in sharing this.\n\n5. Cremini mushrooms (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pa0z3oRPF0xiI-jFAfqMdA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Just as advertised, cooked in a wine and vinegary sauce, it's a nice change of pace from the above flavors.  Only improvement would be having the mushrooms with more or a crunch as they were on the soggy side.\n\nOur waiter was patient, efficient, and watchful in meeting our eating needs.  Staff was prompt in bringing and removing plates as well as refilling drink glasses.  During the meal, the manager checked on us to confirm all needs and food expectations were met.  We shared humorous quips about how the City has changed.  Smiles all around so how can this be any less than a five star event.\n\nBack sooner hopefully than later!", "author": "Mike C."}

The restaurant is located under an apartment complex and across a hotel.  \n\nWe were seated at a booth where it has good lighting.  Other than the front seating area, everywhere else in the restaurant is dark and the decor is old school.\n\nWe were given a drink menu but was told that some of their popular red wine was out, and also out of basil therefore I wasn't able to order their basil martini.  I ordered the cucumber martini instead which was delicious and my husband ordered half a bottle of Syrah.  Our drink came out really quick.\n\nWe ordered:\n*Skillet-roasted chorizo cheese bread ($7.95) - it's a must have when you come here.  It's so good!  It comes out fresh from the oven so it's hot!  cheese is bubbling from the heat, the bread had crispy edges.\n\n*Calamari fritti ($15.95) - nothing special.  Just any other calamari.\n\n*40z bone-in ribeye ($64.95) - it's HUGE.  It's cooked how the diner wants it.  Season well but there was so much fat instead of the meat that you think you're paying for.  I'm not really a huge meat eater, so there was so much left over. \n\n*lightly creamed spinach ($9.95)- my husband enjoyed it.  I don't like creamed spinach so I didn't try it.\n\n*crispy potatoes & vegetables ($13.95)-  it's just ok.  I was disappointed because it came out cold, and the roasted sweet potatoes were so mussy and cold.\n\nBesides from the skillet roasted chorizo cheese bread, everything else was just ok.  Nothing spectacular.\n\nThe service was very poor during our visit here.  Entrees and sides came out 45mins to almost an hour after our appetizers came out.  I don't know what happened, it felt like the order was not placed immediately because the party across from out table who came in 30 mins after us got their appetizer, entree, and were already done with their meal yet our entrees has not come out.  Another table with party of 3 who also came later after us got their appetizers and entree while we were still waiting.  Our server did not explained why the food was late and why our vegetables was cold.  Our reservation was at 6pm and did not get out of the restaurant until past 9pm.\n\nThere are better Steak Houses in San Francisco with much better service.  We won't be coming back here.", "author": "Junaline G."}

Came here just as they opened around 5pm so I got to really soak it all in without the crowd. The first thing I noticed was the amazing lighting through out the restaurant and bar area. This steakhouse has a very classy and unique vibe to it. Instantly felt transported into another city or time even! Impressive.\n\nStopped at the bar first so I could get the whole experience. Drinks were great and so was the service, at the bar at least!\n\nI wanted to sit at the perfect table for my lady's birthday so I tried a few out and ended up picking one of the tables with the green glowing light around it. Just magnificent.\n\nStarted with some crab cakes and oysters. The crab cakes were honestly kind of disappointing. But man, those oysters were amazing, ended up ordering more of them right after.\n\nNext up was with a large sizzling platter of shrimp. And half a crab. The shrimp very flavorful and succulent. Couldnt have been happier with it. But as soon as I tried the crab I realized I made a huge mistake... I should have never ordered that half crab. I should have ordered a whole one, damn! Simply amazing. And that butter sauce just took it to a whole other level. Ordered another half crab before I even finished the previous order. Yea it was that serious.\n\nFollowed that with a massive bone-in rib eye steak. I mean this thing was just colossal. Perfectly seared and cooked. Had a little more fat than Id like and it was not seasoned at all. I mean like no salt period. But it was still amazing after I seasoned it myself.\n\nEnded this amazing dinner with a couple slices of cake. A caramel crunch and some type of lemon cake. The caramel crunch one was so good we had to order an extra one to take home. Lemon one was just alright.\n\nAlthough I had a spectacular experience here I have to say our waiter sucked. Very snooty attitude and barely check on us through out dinner. It wasnt easy to get his attention. He was really dry the whole night and only became animated and only wished my lady a happy birthday after he realized I left him a big tip. The bus boys on the other hand were great and a lot more attentive! They deserved the tip, not him.\n\nAll in all this was still 5 stars for me and the birthday girl.", "author": "Guerito L."}

Adjacent you have Grace Cathedral, and a block or so down the Mark Hopkins and the Fairmont.  And I believe Flood Mansion and the University Club are in very close proximity too.  Old San Francisco elegance.  When you step inside the restaurant you see this as well, the black leather chairs and booths, dark wood accents, and waiters in tuxes.  Parking was easy because they offer free valet, but if you want street, good luck, you'll be circling around for a long time!  \n\nI've had Osso bookmarked for so long and we finally made it out for our anniversary a few months back.  While I would've loved to go the surf and turf route, we refrained.  But next time, I may order us some crab or shrimp because every time a waiter walked by with the hot plate, I smelled the garlicky goodness and I almost drooled.  \n\nI heard so much about their chorizo cheesy bread that I decided to have that and the Brussels sprouts ordered for our appetizers.  To try two different cuts, I went with the bone in filet, and he did the New York Strip.  To get some veggies in we got a side of cremini mushrooms.  They're known for their bone in filet mignon after all! \n\nHe got an old fashioned and I got a mojito.  The mojito was strong!  The chorizo bread was really cheesy with some rosemary baked in and was a hearty sourdough loaf.  While it's called chorizo I only could taste the subtle cheese.  It was good to experience once, but I didn't see much fuss in it.  The Brussels sprouts were so crisp but the chef was a bit heavy handed with the lemon juice.  It didn't make it inedible but was tart for my liking personally.  The moment we've all been waiting for...the beef!!  My bone in filet was so tender and cooked for the most part on point medium rare.  The bone gave it lots of flavor to compliment the light butter sauce.  His NY strip was flavorful from the fat but was a bit tough.  Cremini mushrooms were overly salty.  Special occasions get complimentary vanilla panna cotta.  It was nice and firm enough with the subtle vanilla flavor.  \n\nFriendly service, old fashion SF vibes and one great steak.  Pricey but worth it for a special occasion.  It's all about the meat here folks.  3.5 rounding up.  Next time we'll both get the bone in filet and some seafood.", "author": "Cat C."}

The booths and table chairs were a neat experience. \n\nRestaurant is located at the bottom of an apartment building and you need to travel a bit for a restroom, which is kinda scary... \n\nMy party and i walked in a couple min past our reservation and the table was set up already, great. \nFrom the bar, the ginger martini was delishhhhhh! \nWe ordered the crab fondue, kettle bread, and roasted shrimp and crab to start. The butter made the seafood really \"pop\". \nWe ordered the petite filet mignon and bone in steak. Both were made to perfection! Although i didnt like the sauce that it came in... i much prefer a simpler preparation for my meats. \nWe also ordered garlic noodles which were very light, i would have preferred more garlic flavor. \nThe wine selection was good but most brands were something i've had already tried, which is ok but i would have also liked to expand my palette.\nAs dessert, we ordered the creme brulee cheesecake and some dessert wine. I'am so sad to say the cheesecake was disappointing. It was neither of each. And absolutely dry and horrible.

This is still a steakhouse, you're still paying a pretty penny for food here and some of that price should equate to good service. I'm not asking for a lot but just the normal standard of service.\n\nAmbiance: it was okay, I wasn't impressed by the decor. I found it odd there weren't restrooms in the restaurant you had to go out and take an elevator down a floor. It was pretty full when we got there and it was fairly loud. They do have free valet so that's a plus because we couldn't find any street parking nearby! \n\nFood: 4 stars. We ordered their baked kettle bread ($0.95) it was a pretty big size, came out fresh and warm, I enjoyed it. The issue was it took over 30 mins for the bread to come out and we had to ask. We got two ribeyes medium rare ($60) which were HUGE. There were four of us and I couldn't even eat half of one, at best a third. And while it was flavorful and decent size for the price, I've had better ribeyes before. The meat itself was cooked perfectly to medium rare but the meat was somewhat tough and just not as tender as I was hoping for. The sides range in price (approx. $10 each) and we got the creamed spinach, twice baked potato and cremini mushrooms. My favorite of the sides was the creamed spinach, it wasn't overly creamy. The potato was good but they only give you half a potato!\n\nService: 1 star. Our waiter was alright, he wasn't that nice in the beginning but at the end of the night when it was clearing out he seemed nicer (we rarely saw him throughout the evening). Our reservation was at 6:30pm, we ordered around 7pm and we didn't get our bread until 7:40pm. They forgot our crab fondue completely so we told them to just cancel it by the time our ribeyes and sides arrived. Our waiter never came back to check on us, we had to flag people down anytime we needed something. And when they brought out the sides they didn't give us any serving spoons with it.\n\nI'm not sure if the restaurant is just understaffed, but I found the service extremely disappointing for a steakhouse and the food was good but not spectacular enough to make up for the lack of service. I think they need to hire more staff if they're so busy they can't even come back to check how guests are doing.

Easy of parking?  Reservation or no reservation?  Etc., etc. etc.\n\nIt's rare that the six of us will eat red meat at dinner.  However, after seeing FB friends with their foodie photos, I decided to take a chance and come here to check out their steaks.\n\nMade a reservation on Open Table with ease.  We were seated at a nice round table by the window facing California St.  Ambiance - rick dark colors.  We'd eaten at this restaurant prior when it was different owner with different name and different cuisine.  I'm not sure if the d\u00e9cor was changed or not but same floor space.\n\nOf the six of us, four went with red meat, and the other two with the sea bass.  Hubby, bro in law, and our friend went with the bone in rib eye which I wanted but when I was informed it was 48 oz. before cooking, I decided on the 8 oz. filet mignon.  But I really had my heart set on the 48 oz.   Each steak was cooked perfectly to order.\n\nWe started with the kettle bread.  Good price $0.95 for an entire cast iron skillet of bread.  \n\nHubby & I decided to skip the carbs.  We did share the beet salad which was excellent.  Little cubes of red & yellow beets on two beds of romaine lettuce.  \n\nThe other four diners went with the twice cooked potato and the garlic noodles with their dinners.\n\nAs it was a birthday celebration, we were given the French vanilla bean panna cotta.  We didn't want to say there were three birthdays even though there were.  We shared the comp dessert, and ordered two more desserts.\n\nService was efficient.  Our waiter spilled some beer on our friend.  Later the manager came over to check on her.  It was all good.\n\nTotal bill $600.00 for six people.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-04-26", "description": "Recently (Saturday, April 14th), a group of gals and I descended on Osso for an early dinner and this is a review about the experience.\n\nI'd say that Osso is a surprise. Who'd think to find a steakhouse on the top of Nob Hill with a view of the side of Grace Cathedral outside the window? And with all steakhouses these days you have to expect to shell out some dollars (big time) and Osso is no exception except, maybe, how the gals and I decided to go about dining that night.\n\nFirst off, one of the gals was super hungry and she decided to get the mussels appetizer for herself (what a glut!). Gotta say this dish came out on a sizzling platter and was set on a wire rack that placed the dish above her eye-level (which sort defeats of purpose of being able to admire the dish - hey, what can I say I'm a visual person). From her comments the mussels were only okay. The mollusks weren't that big but tasty as a starter.\n\nFor dinner we decided to approach it family-style which is really a great way for noshers like us to attack the variety of options available.\n\nHere's what the four of us had:\n\nAn order of house bread (99 cents) \nA 30-oz New York Ribeye steak ($59)\nA mixed grilled veggie and potato platter ($13)\nA side of lightly creamed spinach ($9)\nA side of roasted asparagus ($9)\nA sea bass entre ($29)\n\nI've gotta say that I like having bread baked fresh and Osso's was nice with a soft texture & crisp edges, warm but it didn't have much taste.\n\nThe steak was h-u-g-e and definitely a cut that is best shared by several people especially by small eaters like us. Osso grills the steak to the doneness specified by the diner (which is nice). In this case, 30-oz is a lot of beef to tackle so we divvied up the portion. To our horror there was a whole lot of fat on the steak so sort of was disappointed that we had globs of these rather than meat we thought we were paying for.\n\nAs a light entree alternative, we ordered a sea bass entree. This was tasty and pleasant with a light glaze & char. Two fillets on this dish. The odd part was that the fish sat on chopped up romaine pieces -- not very posh.\n\nOf the sides, I'd say the mixed grilled vegetables and potato platter was the best dish. There were smashed small potatoes, chunks of sweet potato, grilled onions, grilled broccoli and grilled cauliflower. Super yummy and I'd say two normal appetite people could comfortably polish off this platter.\n\nThere were 10 grilled asparagus spears with small chunks of gorgonzola cheese dotted atop the dish and, in my opinion, this tasted mediocre.\n\nI'd also say the lightly creamed spinach is a dish that would be okay to pass on. The order itself is really small for the price you're are paying; it was about the size of a softball which is not worth the money.\n\nAfter all this food, we did decide to split one dessert and got the vanilla panacotta which came in a glass cup topped off with a layer of whipped cream. The taste was okay - not super vanilla-y and there were no vanilla bean seeds to be seen.\n\nDecor at Osso is very old school. When you arrive at the front door, you see the bar area immediately in front of you. To me, this looked like a man cave bar because it was really, really dark. The rest of the restaurant other than the front is also somewhat dark.\n\nWe sat at the front of the restaurant where the glass windows were and so we passed the elevated open booths and kitchen and found ourselves in an enclosed booth with posh drapes surrounding our table. This gave a secluded feel to the seating since you can't see any other part of the restaurant except what's right in front of your table.\n\nService at the restaurant was awesome (four stars)! The best I've had in a while. Our waiter was very kind and supporting wait staff was on top of changes in cutlery, whisking away plates and filling water glasses promptly. We never had to deal with trying to find help because there was constantly someone floating by to check on our needs.\n\nOverall, I thought Osso was a good place to eat (three and a half stars). Definitely a splurge restaurant because the food is pricey but thinking about the level of fine service and food options available this might make this the steakhouse to satisfy your taste buds if you're in the mood for a sharing experience.", "author": "Joanna T."}

The bread itself had a hard crust with aromatics but buttery, soft interior. The melted cheese on the skillet could be spooned onto the bread, creating a rich, hearty flavor.\n\nThe scallops gratinee were not overcooked, and the sauce accentuated the savory flavor of the scallops.\n\nThe rib eye, seared textbook medium rare, came slathered in some aromatic butter sauce, which quite literally damped the sear crust. Also, the it seemed less dense and flavorful than expected for aged prime.\n\nThe creamed spinach, light on the cream (as stated on the menu) tasted as expected, to my enjoyment.\n\nThe brussel sprout chips, roasted brussel sprout leaves with salt and lemon, possessed contrasting rich bitterness, salt (duh), and citrus balanced in a way that the bright, bitter, and rich flavors seemed to dance around the palate. \n\nIronically, at this steakhouse, I liked everything but the steak.", "author": "Justin S."}

Despite this, the staff continued to be attentive and didn't rush us out. It's interesting coming up to this place because it felt like coming into someone's home rather than stepping into a restaurant. We were seated in the room immediately to the right as you enter. It's a cozy little place but I'm sure it gets bigger as you go in more. \n\nWe started with a couple Rob Roy's that went down like juice. You could definitely taste the alcohol but the balance was perfect that it didn't stop you from gulping it down like a Capri Sun. They have this really good crispy kettle bread for starters and amazing Dungeness crab crostinis with smoked salmon, avocado, olive oil and burratta. Definitely a must-try. We got the bone-in ribeye for dinner at medium rare and it came out perfectly, with the twice baked potatoes and creamed spinach family style. Our friends also got the shrimp and mussel iron skillet and they seemed to enjoy that as well. \n\nAll in all, it was a great dining experience with good food and good service. We'd definitely pay Osso Steakhouse a visit the next time we're back up in San Francisco.", "author": "Jonathan Z."}

It is your quintessential steakhouse - classic lines and great ambience. It's a great place for business dinners and a romantic dinner. I have been there with my husband, colleagues and even my son and mother. Everyone loved it. \n\nMy husband and I normally sit at the bar when we go. Jay, the bartender, is really great. It's a full bar with an extensive wine list, and you can order off of the dinner menu. The crowd is always lively - a mix of locals, business folks and couples.  There are traditional bar seats and small tables. I love the artwork as well. \n\nIf you need a private room - there is one right off of the bar. It looks like it seats about 12 and is often occupied. \n\nThe only thing to beware of is that Osso is really expensive. Like many steak houses, everything is ordered a la carte. Two people can not eat there with wine for less than about $200 (and I'd say that's still conservative). My husband and I usually split a steak and order two sides plus wine. We are not big appetizer or  dessert people, so it would be more if you added these items to the bill.", "author": "Josephine G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-02-22", "description": "A solid 3-3.5. I came here with 4 friends at 8pm for dinner, and damn the walk up those hills posing as streets killed me. Anyway, this is a pretty old fashioned steakhouse judging by the decor, with some bizarre chair choices (they look like office chairs).\n\nWe opted for 2 if the chorizo cheese breads as a stater, as it seems to be one of their signature items and it's pretty highly rated. The other reviews turned out to be a big disappointment, as it just tasted like pizza, and i could barely taste any chorizo.  The bread was a bit too soggy, and there wasn't quite enough cheese to go around.\n\nI opted for the New York New York, while my friends got the ribeye and the petite filet. My New York was a big disappointment, as it wasn't particularly tender or flavorful. This steak made me question why anyone would even opt for a New York strip in the first place. \n\nThe filet was one of the better ones I've had. I appreciated that it was a thinner cut than other places, as the super thick filets get really gross in the middle even when cooked properly. \n\nThe ribeye was no doubt the best of all the steaks that evening, and definitely one of the best ribeyes I've had. It was tender, it was flavorful, and it was BIG (like 30ounces big). I regretted not getting the ribeye for myself, as it was such a thick slab of juicy flavorful tender meat. There was actual steak flavor to it that the New York lacked, and it was very tender. \n\nOne of my favorite things about Ozzo is that they make a sauce from the meat juices and it was very flavorful and had some Body to it. I wish there was more of the sauce actually as it made my New York somewhat bearable. \n\n\nSides\nMy saut\u00e9ed mushrooms were disgusting- WAYYYYYY too sour - I think they put too much balsamic.\n\nBrussels sprouts - very good! Most restaurants can't do Brussels sprouts, but osso was smart and made chips out of them. \n\nCrispy potatoes - delicious! I think I tasted seaweed with the potatoes, which was an unexpected but welcome combination. \n\nCrispy onions - not a fan as I prefer caramelized onions. \n\nWhat's stopping me from giving osso a higher rating is the price. I think $60 for the ribeye is a very fair price as you get a gigantic steak that's cooked very well. $40 for the petite filet is similar to New York prices. However, $60 for the New York is highway robbery in my opinion; not only is the physical size of the steak smaller than the ribeye, it was not particularly well executed in my opinion. The New York cut is not particularly more expensive than a cut of ribeye sure not sure why they carry the same price point. $10 for sides is pretty standard, but the mushrooms were a disaster. \n\nOverall a decent steakhouse, and I would recommend people to come here for the ribeye, but I don't see myself returning in the future. Also the music was horrible - it was literally the same tune playing over and over and over again - I hate my friend who pointed it out because all I could hear from then was that annoying soundtrack.", "author": "Kevin C."}

My high school English teachers would be ashamed. \n\nI had booked a reservation here with my family for Thanksgiving evening as we were in town for the weekend, and, unfortunately, the dinner was a bit of a disaster from start to finish. We had arrived around 10 minutes early to our reservation, yet we were not seated until nearly half an hour later. What's the point of a reservation, if your table is not \"reserved\" at the requested time?\n\nOnce we were seated, we ordered a celebratory bottle of wine and bread for the table, which arrived quickly. However, from that moment on it was difficult to keep the attention of our server throughout the evening. Nearly every request from our table was either completely forgotten within seconds, or frantically addressed after catching a fiery scowl from my father. \n\nNow on to the food - I'll admit that all of our steaks were cooked perfectly, and the bread that accompanied the meal was fantastic, but nearly everything else fell short of a restaurant that prides itself on elegance and culinary quality. The seafood was remarkably dry, a shortcoming that not even ridiculous amounts of butter could hide. The sides were also underwhelming and overly priced. \n\nOsso is undoubtedly a beautiful and atmospheric restaurant, but there were very few redeeming qualities throughout our evening that could convince me to return.", "author": "Andrew N."}

Well It's in the lobby of a residential building and has a nice private driveway where your chauffeur can drop you off at. \n\nUpon entering you'll feel almost as if you have traveled back to the roaring 20s. Plenty of round piping, smooth corners, gold hues and neon colored lights. They have a number of free standing tables and the edges lined with booths with and without curtains. I first noticed how hot it was inside, I think the heater may been up a little too high. There's no natural air given that it's inside a building so I wouldn't dress to heavily next time. \n\nWe happened to get a private booth which was nice because it was just a fun Friday night dinner and we could say whatever we want and not have to worry about anyone overhearing our conversation. \n\nDrinks were good nothing more than what you would expect. \n\nWe started with the sea bass, slightly tangy and refreshing. Great for preparing you for the next plates!\n\nIn the distance I could hear a sizzling noise and as it grew louder the voices in the background became quieter. The waiter presented us an iron platter piled with crab legs and mussels. Just as I began hoping the sizzling platter would calm down so we could indulge, the server waived his hand over the dish giving it a splash of seasoned butter and that golden goodness began dancing on the platter once again even louder than before while the entire restaurant was silent. The mussels were plentiful and the crab had good meat. The seasoning was also excellent. \n \nI went with the Oso steak (fillet mignon) I figured I couldn't go wrong given that the restaurants name and I wasn't ready to tackle a huge steak that evening. \n\nThe steak had an excellent crust it was almost as if there was a thin cracker on the outside of the steak.  The fillet mignon, medium, was kind of tough, way too lean, but it's was cooked right. Every one else got the bone in rib eye. It was definitely big and juicy. Im definitely going for that next time!\n\nFor dessert I ordered a limoncello cake, they made a mistake and brought out some sort of caramel cake. At that point the food started take effect and I just wanted to leave. The waiter came by and I asked why the cake didn't taste like limoncello and he noticed it was indeed the incorrect cake. I asked to cancel the cake and he was insisting he bring me the correct one because he wasn't able to remove it from our order and the manager wasn't around.

We did it right, started with a round of martins and manhattans all prepared expertly with a potent punch. \n\nFoodwise we didn't skimp, each of us ordering an app/salad and steak. Of course there was an order of their famous skillet-roasted chorizo cheese bread for the table, gawd, that's some good stuff. I love the caramelized cheese along the edges of the cast iron it's served in. \n\nHere are some highlights from our dinner:\n\nCalamari Fritti - this was kind of the sleeper hit at the table, but Osso's addition of sweet peppers is a knock out. \n\nBone in Ribeye - the menu says \"big\" I'd say this huge. If you're hungry, this is the steak to get, ordered medium rare, this will not disappoint. \n\nPetite Filet Mignon - still a nice hunk of meat considering its smaller size. Incredibly tender and Osso tasty! (sorry, couldn't help it)\n\nMac & Cheese - I'm certain they use the same chorizo cheese used on the bread, this is a good thing. Creamy, rich with that nice chorizo flavor, such a hit we ordered two! \n\nOf course there were many other dishes, one in particular should be skipped, the Crab Cocktail.

The restaurant is HUGE and classically decorated - a little dark with white linen table cloths.  It reminds me of Joe's in Chicago or Miami.  Very elegant.\n\nThe service is abhorrent.  We waited for an hour for our order to be taken. The issue was the our table was underserved. Our one guy was nice but couldn't keep up with all that he was assigned to do.\n\nSome of the food is great and some is somewhat disappointing. The steaks are fantastic - great quality tender filet that was perfectly cooked.  The cast iron shrimp was overcooked and only redeemed by drawn butter.  The fried onions are totally standard but still delicious.  The chorizo cheese bread (half a loaf of sourdough sliced and topped with cheese to be melted on while warming the bread in a chorizo flavored tomato sauce) blew my mind - better than grilled cheese and tomato soup for me.  The cauliflower and creamed spinach are standard and a bit of a snooze. The Brussels spouts chips (basically four sprouts separated into leaves and deep fried) will blow your mind.\n\nThe cocktails are spirit heavy (too much on a Manhattan; perfect for a Sidecar).  The wine selection is good (the Faust Cab is great).  I had a great time, but I expect better service.  5 star food, 1 star service.  I guess that is better than the reverse.

The garlic noodles you can pass on, which the server suggested not to get and we didn't listen. It's a steakhouse in the fist place, so stick with the steak. The Porterhouse hands down is the best steak there. It is a bit pricey roughly around $96, but it is a really good steak. They should bring the price down easily by 30% in my opinion and the friends that were with me agreed. It is best to share the Porterhouse for two, which is plenty of food especially if you order the side dishes. Avoid the fried food and stick with mushrooms and spinach for sides. Bring your own bottle of wine and pay the corkage. The wine list selection is just Ok. They need to have more selection, and better priced Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot by the glass.

I actually prefer Osso's more now, although it's a tad bit pricier than HOPR.\n\nWe started the evening off with a couple of starters: skillet-roasted chorizo cheese bread (must order) and the crab cakes. The bread was phenomenal as the bread was soaked in the melted chorizo-infused cheese. The crab cakes were underwhelming to be honest.\n\nWe ordered the bone-in ribeye, new york new york, lotsa crab, the kettle-baked crispy chicken, and bunch of other sides. Everything was fantastic, but the star of the show was the ribeye, which was cooked a perfect medium rare (more on the rarer side, but it just melts in your mouth)\n\nService could be better, but I'll definitely be coming back for the ribeye again!", "author": "Dustin W."}

Waited a good 20 minutes before our waiter appeared.  It seemed there were only 2 waiters that night, the rest either food runners or support staff.  Our bottle of wine arrived promptly, but our appetizers took a while to arrive.  However, they were good to very good, our mains came shortly after, and unfortunately the steaks were cooked very oddly.  The cooking was uneven, as if left on one side too long, and then a quick flip to the other side, and one steak was completely under cooked.  I had the sea bass, and while the portion of fish itself was cooked well, and tasty, the choice of lettuce to sit it on was a bad one.  Wilted lettuce is not pleasant.  I thought at first it was cabbage, but it was romaine lettuce.  The shared sides were very good, the twice baked potato was awesome. \n\nSo, we sat for another good 20 minutes waiting for our waiter to come around, for another drink/water, for dessert order....we grabbed one of the support staff, and he said he'd get our waiter.....we waited and waited....and finally passed on dessert as we just wanted to leave at that point.\n\nI wouldn't recommend Osso, based on the service issues.

Interior was nice, kind of dim. We ordered:\n-bone-in ribeye steak, medium rare ($59.95)\n-petite filet mignon, medium rare ($39.95$\n-kettle bread ($0.95)\n-creamed corn ($8.95)\n-Asparagus ($9.95)\n-Moscow mule x2 ($13.95)\n-blood orange margarita ($13.95)\n\nNothing stood out.. Our bone in ribeye was the worst ribeye we've ever had. We've tried it at other places (Alexander's, izzy's steakhouse), and have never been let down. It was so hard to slice and chew the rib eye, and was more rare than medium rare. It also lacked in flavor, so we added some salt. It's a pretty pricey steakhouse, so having to add the salt for taste was a little disappointing. The filet mignon was good, but more medium well than medium rare.. The seared outside of the filet tasted really good though! Kettle bread was our favorite thing on the table, the bread was very fluffy on the inside but crispy on the outside. Creamed corn was good, but nothing special. The asparagus was also good, but they add blue cheese, and we're not huge fans of blue cheese, so we cut off the sides that had it on. Our drinks were also mediocre, and took forever to come out. Service was whatever, my boyfriend had to wave him down for everything. Total came out to around $188. Not worth it, wouldn't come back. Definitely wouldn't recommend.", "author": "Pauline E."}

We thought a treat to Osso was well deserved for a nice steak and crabs. Our waiter John was pleasant when he was at the table but that turned out to be very infrequent . I asked about the Arnold Palmer Margarita and he recommended it so I ordered it with no salt. When it arrived I can tell the salt had been attempted to be cleaned off the rim and was dripping down the glass. I asked another waiter if I could get it taken care of but he never returned with another. John was MIA so I tried to enjoy it but the salt ruined it for me. The first course arrived and everything was delicious from the salads, chorizo bread and yellow fin tuna. We wanted to order a bottle of wine with dinner but again John was MIA so we had to flag down another employee who got us the bottle right away. John would glance over at our table as he was waiting on the table next to ours joking and being attentive to them but never once checking in but to take our initial drink and food order. Our two steaks and whole crab arrived with crispy potatoes and brussels sprouts. The steaks were cooked perfectly and sides were delicious. Wanting another bottle of wine we had to flag down our waiter as we had empty glasses at this point. When it came time for dessert we asked our waiter for menus because he didn't offer us any and was ready to offer the check. At this point a friend made a comment about his lack of service and he told us he had a big private party that was keeping him away. What upsets me is that if their is a large party you should have a dedicated server to them so the rest of your paying guests experience isn't affected. Considering the price point it left me wondering is it worth giving it a second chance. I am sure SF has other steakhouses for me to try who treats all guests with the same level of care. To recap the ambiance is everything I expected, food was delicious but the lack of good service ruined our celebratory dinner.", "author": "Joan R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-02-28", "description": "Ive always been a skeptic of restaurants that are located inside a hotel building.  Osso didnt change that stigma.  Osso was recommended by a local, who we asked for the best spot to eat in SF. \nWe were able to get a table via opentable so upon arriving we were sat right away.  The decor and ambiance had that \"old time steakhouse\" feel. Dimly lit, dark carpets, white table clothes and green lamp shades. Servers were dress in black suits and ties. Ive dined at over 20 different steakhouses high end and low and i didnt feel like i was in a high end establishment... more upper middle.  \nWe ordered a round of drinks and it took a out 20 minutes for it to arrive and one drink was missing, when asked about it the server said \"its coming.\" He took our orders and we waited for 15 more minutes and we finished our first round of drinks and asked for another plus the missing drink and the server said \"bar is really backed up but its coming.\"\nAppetizers came out, the chorizo cheese bread was pretty good and the calamari was done nicely.\nAbout another 30 mins had pas before second round of drinks came but still missing one drink. Which was eventually brought out with the meals.\nSteak portions are well priced and huge. $60 for a 30 oz bone in ribeye is a steal of a deal. It was cooked well for its size but lacked flavor. My friend has the petite filet mignon and his was very bland. Side items at $6 - $8 each isnt worth it because its just about two scoops of food which is hardly wnough to share. \nNo one ever came back to see how things were going, if the food came out right, if we needed anything else.  Overall, its an okay spot at best to share a steak and some sides if youre wanting an above average steakhouse with some what of a \"high end\" appeal. But based upon other choices in the area - if you dont need to budget there are much better choices and id bet the service is impeccable compared to our first and last experience.", "author": "Nam N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-02", "description": "For my old school San Franciscan grandparents, this spot was their happy place. My best friend told me about her recent experience at Osso and I knew I needed to return for my birthday. As soon as I arrived the nostalgic aura and memories came flooding back. If you're trying to derive happy memories for older loved ones, this could be the place to make magic happen.\n\nWhat we consumed:\n\nMy husband and I are big seafood fans. As soon as we sat down my husband hadn't looked at the menu and immediately ordered the medium portion of mussels and shrimp.\n\nA. The mussels and shrimp came out on a scalding hot skillet sizzling with sexy spices and tantalizing garlic sauce. Both the shrimp and mussels were perfectly cooked. I was sad the shrimp weren't peeled, but the shell locked in so much flavor I wasn't sad for long. Whooooooaaaaa that spiced garlic butter mixture was unforgettable. A+\n\nB. Husband and I always start with a salad. Went with the Caesar. Sad and pathetic. Lacked Caesar flavor. Tasted like plain romaine. \n\nC. Skillet chorizo cheese bread. Yes, I'm sure you've seen many photos and videos of this smoking hot cheesiness. And yes, the photos make it look sexy. \n\nThis was the biggest letdown of my meal! \n\nIt was not sizzling, it was superheavy, loaded with sodium and butter, and DID NOT taste like chorizo. It's too heavy of a dish to start with especially split between two people. Would be more successful devoured between a party of four or more. If I knew it was going to be such a lackluster aspect of the meal I would've passed to save room for more beef. \n\nD. Husband ordered the bone in ribeye. I ordered the filet mignon. I was tempted to order the bone in filet, but feeling so full from our starters I knew I would never be able to finish it. Both cuts were great. My husband's ribeye was by far superior to the filet mignon. However, he was really turned off by the presentation. It looked like a large dinosaur bone with a layer of what should be melted butter -- but by the time it reached the table looked like a congealed, iridescent layer. \n\nE. It was beyond surprising Osso does not supply one mashed potato option. Not one! The twice baked potato is NOT a substitute for mashed. When I inquired about the mashed it was explained the twice baked is just as creamy. The twice baked potato sucked. The potato was so hard and chunky that it tasted under cooked. Lacked seasoning and creamy texture.\n\nF. Lightly creamed spinach was hands-down the best side dish! Light, sophisticated and paired best with our proteins. Order that!\n\nG. Even though we couldn't finish our meal, I strongly believe in the philosophy of \"no dessert left behind\". We consumed the limoncello cake (8/10 light, fluffy and tenderly sweet), salted caramel crunch cake, and my personal favorite: the vanilla panna cotta. \n\nAs a random patron was leaving she told her friend to order the salted caramel crunch cake. She seemed like a regular so I figured she knew what's up. I'm absolutely sure this salted caramel crunch cake was designed for adult \"men children\" who can't be pleased by desserts other then chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream. Pass. \n\nOur server, Ian, was impeccable. I was impressed by his presence. He never interrupted and made us feel well taken care of. Even though some aspects of the meal were anticlimactic, high quality interactions will ALWAYS make it better. Go Ian! \n\nI hate to snitch, but it should be known: The table across from us was an older party of four. It became obvious they come here a lot and know what they want. They each started with a salad, then three minutes later their main proteins arrived. It made me uncomfortable to hear them complaining so close to my table in regards to the miscommunication between courses. They were pretty pissed. \n\nPro Tip 1: free valet. Nice guys. \n\nPro Tip 2: $10 corkage fee. \n\nPro Tip 3: depending on how busy the night is, it could take anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes to fetch the car. You may want your date to wait inside (out of the cold) while you take care of the car.\n\nPro Tip 4: the valet, attached valet court, and entrance is all ADA accessible.\n\nPro Tip 5: this establishment is poor at answering phones, taking special requests, and making reservations. This lack of communication may detour you from coming. Try not to let it spoil your experience.\n\nPro Tip 6: the bar area is lavish, mafioso, limelight living. Nice place to WOW out of town friends. Also, if coming for a small meal try to reserve the King's throne. Meant for cocktails and signing contracts.", "author": "Rosalyn W."}

It just says big in parentheses and boy was it huge! Good bang for buck since it's shareable and well priced. \n\nWe ordered sides to share with the table. Asparagus had bleu cheese crumbled on top which was a tasty touch. The twice baked potato and creamed corn were also really flavorful good choices that paired well with the meats. The Caesar salad was just that, nothing abnormal. The mussels and shrimp appetizer plate was flavorful; mussels had just enough salt to it and shrimp was well seasoned. The cheese with bleu cheese bread was amazing, super buttery and of course cheesy! Dessert was on the house for the birthday...a vanilla pudding sort of thing which was sweet and delicious. They even brought out another since they forgot to light the candle. We didn't mind since we almost ate it all but they insisted which was really nice gesture. \n\nService was really great!

It was cooked to a perfect medium but it wasn't seasoned well. Tried my boyfriend's bone-in osso filet mignon cooked medium rare and it didn't taste much better. They were just okay. I make Gordon Ramsay's steak at home and it is seasoned way better (simple salt, pepper, butter and thyme). Only thing this steak had going for it was that it was a better cut of meat than what I use at home. Point is: you can cook a better tasting steak at home for cheaper! \n\nThe side of crispy potatoes were fantastic. Had a great crunch on the outside but soft inside. It was the right amount of salt but a hint of sweetness. Not sure if that was from the potato itself or they sprinkled it with a tiny amount of sugar.\n\nGot the side of mac and cheese but it was dry. Would not reorder again. Nothing impressive about it. \n\nWould definitely reorder the limoncello cake. It was amazing. I preferred it over the salted caramel vanilla crunch cake. The limoncello cake was the perfect density. And it's slight lemony flavor was not overpowering--it was a perfect, light ending to a heavy meal.\n\nWould not come here again. Overall, not worth the $$$$. Would rather splurge somewhere else like Alexander's steakhouse. It's a little bit more pricey, but the food and service are both way better. The way their steak is flavored/cooked is not something I could recreate at home. \n\nService:\nDid not get seated until about 7:30pm. Twenty minutes later, a server still had not come to our table so we had to ask for one. Ordered drinks and appetizers. Had to wait a long time again before our server came to get our order for our entrees. When it came time for dessert, we had to call a different waiter to take our order because our server still had not returned to our table. \n\nWe don't blame our server, but whoever manages them could have done a better job. Our server was given too many tables. We saw him serving tables all the way across the room. We thought that the service may have been like that because it's Christmas Eve, but it might be an all-year round thing based off of other reviews.\n\nBut once they did get our order, the food did come out in a reasonable time frame. Overall, our dinner was a little over 3 hours--all due to the service waiting time.

My first time and I made a reservation based on what I read on Yelp!\n\nOsso is a very traditional-looking steakhouse with the expected ambiance and level of service (attentive without being annoying). Free valet parking is a nice touch, especially given the busy location.\n\nWe started with oysters and calamari (both were good, though not outstanding). Entrees were 2 bone-in rib eyes (absolutely gigantic), a petit filet, mac & cheese (fairly small serving), brussel sprout chips (tasty!) and the family-size roasted veggies (easily the best side, btw and the best value). Steaks were done medium rare by default, though I asked for my rib eye to be more on the rare side, which they delivered perfectly. The other rib eye was more on the medium side, which disappointed my friend (but not too much since he ate the entire thing). Overall the steaks were pretty fantastic. Not the best steak I've ever had, but certainly ranks as one of the better ones. We split one of the desserts after (salted caramel cake-thing....quite good).\n\nSoooo yeah, a nice dinner out and a solid steakhouse experience. Knocking off a star for a few reasons: 1) while I love rib eyes for their rich marbling (hence the flavor), both of ours had several solid fat deposits, which is not what I'm used to from past steakhouse experiences 2) the chef has a heavy hand with salt...literally everything was pretty salty 3) the gent tasked with cleaning the table was always trying to remove things and we had to tell him several times to leave items behind since we weren't done yet.", "author": "Foodie S."}

Sides were alright, as were appetizers. \n\nService wasn't terrible, but it wasn't that great either. I've definitely received better service at other establishments. We were seated in their wine room and I think it's nice that it was secluded from the rest of the dining but it's still pretty noisy; from the room we could hear a clearly drunk patron at the bar screaming nonsense at someone. \n\nOverall wasn't impressed with the quality of the food or my experience here.

And they have some pretty great steakhouses with great meat, wine, and all-around (southern hospitality) service which are the key ingredients to an exceptional steakhouse. With that being said, I will have to rate this experience mediocre that did not match their asking price - which by the way has a disclaimer at the bottom of their menu to say that they will add on another couple of percentages to your meal for you to absorb the business expenses that the Californian government slaps on to them.\n\nPros:\n1. No wait time - not sure if this is an indication of SF foodies' score onto this place, but hey, just focusing on the positives right now, no waiting time was great for two hungry passersby that wanted to check out a generic SF steakhouse on a Friday night. \n\n2. The ambience was nice (except the blinding neon green lights that separated the booths - but this is my taste!) and the people that wined and dined here seemed to be locals, which we enjoyed people watching from our booth to get a better sense of the fellow people in SF. \n\n3. Pretty good wine prices - I don't know if it's again coming from Texas, but wine prices seem to be more fair in restaurants in Cali and this place was not an exception. \n\n4. Pretty good side dishes and dessert. We enjoyed most of the dishes throughout - especially the grilled mussels and the cheesecake was delicious!\n\nCons:\n1. The meat - eh. I'm sorry, that's all I'm going to say! Which is the primary reason why I have to give a three star to this eatery. \n\n2. The service of the waiter. From the slow start - we were pondering where our waiter was after 15 minutes, trying to make eye contact with anyone that was wearing a tux in hopes of them taking our order, to not having our questions properly answered, left us with an impression either it's the waiter's first couple of weeks at the restaurant or they haven't been trained or tasted the restaurant's food themselves. \n\n3. Our waiter's knowhow on wine. I was going to include this in the service section, but upon writing, I feel this deserves a separate section since this House is supposed to be a nice steakhouse and wine is a big part!\n\nFirst, I had to ask the waiter to kindly give us a cabernet glass for our cab that we ordered - apologies, I'm a vigorous swirler!\n\nSecond, the menu stated it was a 2013 estate, and the waiter brought out a 2014 without any disclaimer. Now I know a lot of restaurants do this without second thought, but this is what separates the top notch to the mediocre (at best). Know what is on your menu v. what you're bringing out to the customer! A highly rated wine one year may not be as good or what the customer was looking for the next. \n\nThird, he poured in a way that wine kept on dripping onto the tablecloth and stained most of the wine label.

No one suggested we go to the bar or how they would find us, but being British I gravitated to the bar and ordered a drink. After 40 mins we were escorted to our table whereupon we sat for 10 minutes while various staff members ghosted past us. \n A gentleman came to the table and asked us if we needed drinks and we demurred, and then sat patiently for another 10 mins. At that point I flagged down the gentleman and asked if we had a server. He replied \"You have me!\", and then fell silent. \n I asked him his name and then ordered the crab cakes and our entrees. \nAt that point I assume he was abducted by aliens since there was no trace of him until much, much later. \n 10 mins later, what can be only described as a drive by occurred. Someone, I couldn't tell you the sex age or height of the person, such was the speed of entry, dropped (literally) the appetizer on the table and proclaimed \"crab cakes!\" Which although technically what we had ordered  wasn't particularly helpful. Or indeed it turns out accurate. The deep fried shredded crab leftovers masquerading as crab cakes were truly a culinary disaster. I would have loved to have informed anyone, but at this point there had been more verified Bigfoot sightings than server sightings. \n The food runner arrived with our entrees, and was the first person with an actual personality we had encountered. He seemed a bit flummoxed that nothing had been prebussed (or eaten) and attempted to remedy the situation. \n At this point I didn't care, my bone in filet sat in front of me. I cut into the medium well steak, which would have been fantastic, had I not ordered it rare. \n The flavor can only be described as beige. I have had more tastebud tingling euphoria from muesli. \n To be fair my girlfriend's crab was very good. \n The table next to us was angrily remonstrating with the manager, as the table opposite informed us that they had been here for 2 hours and desperately wanted to leave. They had the look of a couple waiting for a parole board decision. \n And now the one highlight of the evening. The manager. We explained our plight, and he was fantastic. No excuses, just a bemused acceptance of the disaster. He brought us an excellent desert and a nice 20 yr tawny and comped most of the meal. \n\nIn summation. Come here for the hostess, food runner, manager, espresso and desert. Skip the rest.", "author": "Marcus T."}

We saw people rolling in non-stop. Granted we arrived early, we waited until 7:30 to check in again. Hostess said she doesn't know how long the wait till be. We asked again at 7:39pm to ask about our table again. The hostess said there's still 1 table ahead of us so don't know how much longer we'll have to wait. In the meanwhile, we continued to seat small 3-4 people parties as they rolled in.

I came here with my significant other for a night out with a babysitter watching our one year old. We started with the crab crostini which was refreshing and the chorizo bread which was nice and hot. We also shared the bone-in New York steak and the whole crab. I thoroughly enjoyed the crab. Not only did they serve an excellent Dungeness Crab but they served it on a sizzling hot plate! Although you have to be cautious from touching the metal hot plate, I had a great first time experience eating crab without having it get cold from being too slow to peel the crab. In addition, my fingers didn't get cold as well because the crab was hot throughout the entire time eating it! I was very impressed of how well they cooked the crab considering the meat easily peeled always from the shell! Eating crab here definitely was an incredible experience!", "author": "Michelle V."}

First, we had to wait 25 minutes just for waters and to be greeted by a server. When the server brought our waters, he hit my mom with the tray. Then, we waited another 30 minutes for our food to come out. The cooked-medium rib eyes were grossly undercooked and rare. Finally, we were charged for an extra entree. Rather than realize that there were eight people and nine entrees on the bill, the server argued with us and double checked that it never came out. We were very frustrated with the way we were treated.\n\nWhen you spend $600 at a restaurant, you should be waited on with respect and served quality meals.", "author": "Kate N."}

It was my eleven year anniversary with my boyfriend and we wanted to try something new. We read that this place had good reviews and was a good restaurant. This was differently not the case. First, the waiter was rushing us to order our meals. We wanted to enjoy our appetizers first then order our meals. We felt since a big party was walking in that they wanted us to hurry up to order so he could attend to the party. We then waited a long time for our meals to come. We understand that sometimes the meals take a little long to come out but this was longer than usual. The waiter didn't even acknowledge us at all or to let us know the status of our food. There was a family behind us who was also waiting for their meals and the waiter offered them bread and was acknowledging them. When our meals finally came they were super disappointing. The veggie were charred and did not taste good at all.

We then asked to see the manager who claimed he didn't know what the weight of meat looks like. Really? You're the manager of a steakhouse.\n\nThey ended up bringing us another porterhouse of the same size which seems to confirm what they originally served was closer to 14oz.\n\nTo the management of Osso steakhouse, don't try to deceive/cheat your guests.

I'm a fan,\" but instead, just barely above average).\n\nOsso Steakhouse has some great features: a well-conceived and well-executed menu, a nice layout, and appealing deco aesthetic.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some less appealing elements. The most unfortunate thing is that, for a steakhouse, it is simply too brightly lighted. A steakhouse should be dark, practically by definition. Osso's management would be well served by a walk down to Big 4 for some lighting inspiration. The appointments and seating they currently have are very attractive (and deco) and would be greatly enhanced by a dimmer atmosphere. It's a small adjustment that would yield great improvements to the ambience. The service I encountered was only slightly above average and not at all commensurate with the menu pricing.\n\nThe food is very good, though not uniformly excellent. In my view, there is one thing that a steakhouse must do perfectly: prepare steak. In this way, Osso delivers. The steak I had (a deconstructed porterhouse, ordered rare) was perfectly seasoned and the temperature was perfect. If you want an excellent steak, Osso is just about the best choice in the City. Not surprisingly I found their seafood items, specifically the roasted crab, good but nothing compared to Crustacean (mere blocks away), and the sides (especially the garlic noodles) are pretty average. Notably the chorizo cheese bread appetizer is, as mentioned in innumerable reviews, positively fabulous.\n\nIt is a nice restaurant that is lighted like a prison cafeteria with some very good food, including superb steaks. It is wholly recommendable and I wouldn't hesitate to take discerning friends here.", "author": "Joe A."}

(Not the dark depressing old time snobby Steakhouse ambiance). \nThere were 6 in our party, 3 couples. We were seated at a table at the window with a great view of Grace Cathedral in the heart of Nob Hill. \nThe wait staff welcomed us and  opened our wine. \nWe took a few minutes to review the menu, that has a nice selection & is not overloaded with too many choices. \nWe started with the cheesy chorizo bread that is severed with a spoon!  (That should tell you something). \nIn one word, Scrumptious. \nFor our appetizer we ordered the large skillet of grilled shrimp. The sizzling iron skillet arrived with a bang & lived up to its eye appeal. Drawn garlic butter on the side, begged for the shrimp to take a dip in the pool of molten goodness...\nSoooo yummy!\nFor our sides we ordered: Brussels sprouts - served crisp & tender. \nCrispy potatoes were perfectly crunchy & well seasoned. \nThe mushrooms were a perfect choice for the steaks that we ordered (get to the beef in a moment). Deep flavor and great texture. \nAhhhhh the steaks!\nThe menu says \"Big Steaks\", and do they deliver!\nThe entire table ordered the \"Rib Eye\". \nThe main course arrived at the table well received & impressed everyone. \nOn the menu it's says \"Rib Eye (Big)\"...\nThat's no lie!  \"30 oz.\" of beautiful beef \ncooked to a perfect medium rare. \nDelicious!  (We all had plenty to take home). \nFor desert we decided to taste the menu. \nLemonchello  cake, Carmel crunch cake, Chocolate mousse & the White chocolate parfait were spot on & highly recommended. The Cheesecake was average, really wasn't memorable. \nThe service was outstanding. \nWe brought our own bottled wine ($10.00 per bottle corkage, great value). \nThe wait staff brought out the upgraded stemware that was much appreciated. The waiters were attentive & didn't make themselves part of the party, (which we thought was a good reflection of the restaurants culture). \nOsso Steakhouse is a uniquely trendy, retro place with a traditional old school Steakhouse feel to it. \nOne can feel comfortable dressed in a Suit, or come casual in jeans.

The rib eye landed on my plate and I knew right away this was gonna the best one I ever had. It was giant. I'm a big guy and Ilike to eat and this was GIANT. Perfectly cooked, excellent flavor, excellent texture - so damned satisfied thank you food gods! \n\nMy friend got bone-in filet mignon, and that too was gigantic! Tasted as perfect as it looked. I tried it and that was also the best I'd had. I am not even a filet mignon fan, and it was excellent. Also, I'd never seen filet mignon served with the bone and clearly, this is the way it SHOULD be served! Oh and I did ask for horseradish and it was EXCELLENT.\n\nFor Dessert my memory is a bit hazy, as I was so high from the amazing steak - but I think it was some sort of vanilla ice cream with marscapone and mint leaf.

I was able to secure the semi-private room by the bar for our party and I was impressed right away with the sophisticated and charming decor.\n\nOnce we were all settled, our watier, equally as charming took our drink and appetizer orders. The crabcakes are highly recommended. As usual, I ordered a mocktail(the Ginger Mocktini was superb and refreshing and the Nojito was just average). After debating back and forth, I finally settled on the Bone in Ribeye which states \"Big\" next to the item on the menu. Boy, was it ever big!\n\nThroughout the evening, our water glasses were refilled quickly and our waiter checked in on us from time to time.And in the end the food was exactly what you would expect for a steakhouse of this caliber. Was it perfect? No, the ribeye although extremely large was a bit bland for my tastes and wasn't as succulent as I was hoping it would be.\n\nAll in all, Osso is a wonderful experience that should be tried once.", "author": "Angela L."}

But, let me say, if Gordon Ramsay was the one to walk into this facility, he'll probably going to ask the servers if someone had died. Joke aside... :p\nWell, it is a fine dine steakhouse, so, you'll expect to have the top of the line everything. Their food was great and to its expectations, along with the service to compliment that. The staff were friendly and very helpful! \nThere were 5 of us, my 3 friends and my husband (the picky eater), and we were pretty satisfied with the food and service.

I overly over stuffed myself last night because everything was so good so I'm working off the extra calories I consumed! \n\nEvery year it's my job to host a Company Christmas party for my employer. I work for a couple of respectable surgeons here in San Francisco, so I had to make sure I pick the right place! My husband went here for dinner with some family for his Bachelor party. He couldn't stop talking about how the steak was cooked perfectly! \n\nI inquired about this place in the beginning of 2015. That's where I met Charlie, the general manager! Perfect guy for the job. We exchanged a handful of emails throughout the year. He answered all of my questions in a timely fashion and was very professional through it all! \n\nThe day of our party, which was December 11th, 2015, Charlie allowed me to come early to decorate our private room. We had about 50 people attending. Even though we haven't met in person, we felt like we knew each other. When I walked in, he was busy on the phone, but he pointed to our private room letting me know it's ok to start decorating.\n\nWe started the party with cocktail hour. There were appetizers outside our price room which was a nice set up. We started with 3 things.\n\nFried Stuffed Olives: I'm not really into olives. In fact the only time I'm served with olives is in my martini! But these ones were so delicious. They were not oily and had a perfect crunch to them.\n\nFried Calamari: Again, not oily and had the perfect crunch! The calamari was not over cooked and it was easy to swallow!\n\nChorizo Cheese Bread: OMG! So good! It's a load of bread on top of this chorizo cheese dip! Get that bread soggy with the cheese dip and you're in heaven!!\n\nAs fit our dinner, we got to choose 3 things. An 18oz Filet, salmon, or a portobello mushroom dish for our vegetarians.\n\nMy husband had the steak which he demolished! He said every single bite was tender and juicy. Also, very flavorful!\n\nI had the salmon which was cooked perfectly. Every bite I took just melted in my mouth. So good!\n\nThe Ceaser salad I had was just perfect. It had a lot of croutons and cheese, just the way Iike it! \n\nRoasted Potatoes And Vegetables: I have to ask them how they cook them so perfectly! If I knew how to make vegetables the way they do, I would add vegetables to my eating plan! Lol!!\n\nThe Vanilla Panna Cotta was so good! The waiter gave me 2!! \n \nI honestly love this place and it has become my favorite restaurant! Move over Gary Danko! I have a new favorite!! \n\nThank you, Charlie and staff! You actually made me look real good with my bosses! These surgeons wouldn't stop talking about how great the food is! You will definitely see our faces again!", "author": "Darlene M."}

We had a reservation on Saturday, December 5th at 5:45pm. We were going to be a larger group so they gave us the private wine room. In the end, we were a party of 8 which was way more comfy than trying to fit 12 people at our table.\n\nCocktails ($13.85 each):\n*Guavamosa: sorrelle branco prosecco extra dry & guava\n*Ossogoodhattan: bourbon, sweet vermouth, fernet branca\n*Blt: bulliet, lemon & tonic\n*Moscow stoli\n*Old fashion bulliet\n\nWe started off with cocktails. I got the manhattan. I'm not a huge fan of fernet, but I didn't mind it much here. It wasn't so strong that the drink was too herbal tasting. If you're thinking of getting scotch like I was, someone got the Glenlivet 12 yr single malt ($13). Not horribly priced.\n\nMocktails ($6.95 each):\n*Basil breeze: fresh basil, cranberry & lemon juice\n*Ginger mocktail: lemon juice, ginger ale & candied ginger\n\nSome got mocktails as they were the DD for the night. I didn't try any of them, but my gf seemed to like them.\n\n*House-made fresh crispy baked kettle bread ($0.95) \u00d72\n*Crab cakes: dungeness ($17.95) / x-each ($8.95), 8 crab cakes = ($71.65)\n*Yellowtail carpaccio: diced chillies & arbequina evoo ponzu ($15.95) \u00d72\n\nI think it's weird that they charge you for bread, but it's a giant loaf for less than a dollar, so it's not too bad. The bread was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. The crab cakes were crispy and filled with a good amount of crab. I liked the carpaccio. Fresh and a great contrast of flavors with the chili and ponzu.\n\n*Bone-in (osso) filet mignon: 18 oz ($59.95) \u00d73\n*Bone-in ribeye: big ($59.95) \u00d74\n*Sea bass: parsley, garlic, paprika butter encrusted ($27.95)\n*Garlic noodles: gemelli, parsley, paprika butter sauce ($14.95)\n\nI got the filet, which was huge in itself. The ribeye?! It's gigantic. I believe our waiter said it was 40oz! Suffice it to say, everyone who ordered the ribeye took home leftovers. My filet was cooked perfectly. I got it rare and it was nice and red on the inside. And super tender.\n\n*Mac & cheese: chorizo spiced ($9.95)\n*Creamed corn ($8.95)\n*Brussels sprouts: sauteed bacon & onions ($9.95)\n*Lightly creamed spinach ($9.95)\n*Sauteed mushrooms ($9.95)\n*Crispy potatoes & vegetables for the table: carrots, onions, olives, sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower ($13.95)\n\nI really liked the creamed corn and spinach. Both were very creamy and comforting. The mac & cheese and mushrooms were also great sides. The mac was cheesy and the mushrooms had a nice earthiness. The brussels were okay. I didn't really like the onions as they were kind of slimy. The potato and veggie dish wasn't my fav. Everything was crispy but kind of dry.\n\n*French vanilla panna cotta ($8.95)\n*Chocolate cappuccino mousse cup ($9.95) \u00d72\n*Creme brulee cheesecake ($9.95)\n\nThe panna cotta was smooth and silky. The cheesecake creamy. I didn't get much creme brulee flavor though. I don't really like chocolate so I didn't care for the mousse. I thought the desserts in general were just okay.\n\n*Joseph phelps, napa valley 2012: cabernet sauvignon ($109)\n*BR cohn silver label, sonoma 2012: cabernet sauvignon ($49)\n*Duckhorn merlot, napa 2012 ($22 glass)\n*Graham's 20 yr tawny port, oport-portugal ($15 glass)\n*Coffee ($4.50) \u00d72\n*Latte ($4.95) \u00d72\n\nWhat's dinner with some wine and coffee? I enjoyed both reds. The coffee was also pretty good. I loved getting my own pot, though it was pricey at $4.50.\n\nGood restaurant for steak. If I ever come back, I'm getting that giant ribeye!", "author": "Elena N."}

While there is a bread item that you can order off the menu, we noticed the table next to us was provided free bread in a cast iron.  Not sure why we had to ask them for it, but it was good bread.  Soft and warm.\n\nOn to the main course of my filet mignon, it was perfect.  I love my steak medium well, and I loved every single bite.

After seeing this restaurant on Check Please Bay Area with my wife, we both agreed this would be the treat for our upcoming 25th wedding anniversary on 5/13/17.  Reservations made a month and a half in advance, stay in a top of the line hotel, Uber over and there atop Nob Hill is our destination.  I walked through the entry thinking that this is going to be a 5 no doubt on Yelp.  \n\nSince our reservations are for Saturday night, I decided to call the Maitre d' a day in advance to let him know that this is a special occasion.  It was 4:50 on Friday and they do not open until 5pm, so I left a message on the General Managers voice mail.  Today is 5/18/17, I still have not received a call back... (uh oh).\nFirst thing I saw upon entering the building was a sign informing me that the restroom is an elevator ride away.  Let me factor this in as I plan to prime the pump at the bar first.  Second thing I see, a line out the door!  We simply walked past the crowd and to the bar.  They have any drink you could want, and a full wine list.  What is missing?  A wine Sommelier!  Although we live in the Bay Area and visit wineries regularly, we still like to refer to a Sommelier for their wine selection.  The bartender could not answer the questions my wife had regarding the different selections.  This might be a problem.  Wifey orders a half carafe so the wine will decant, the bartender brings a glass of wine and we both think that he is storing the rest behind the counter.  Nope... Oh well.  By the way, the bar tender was a low talker.  I was asking him about the different Scotch that they offer, and could not hear him.  \n\n What seems to be the Maitre d' came to inform us of our table, so he then directs us, no problem.  Well really, yes.  He failed to collect my wife's glass of wine for her, and she had to carry it herself.  I know... first world problem, but just saying.  As you can tell I am a detail person.\n\nWe sat in high backed padded swivel chairs which I liked.  Our waiter is Jure.  We ordered the following:\nAppetizer - Cheese Bread, this was incredible\nBeet Salad - Very good mix of three differently prepared beets\nTwo Bone in Fillet - This was simply the best steak I have ever eaten, and prepared medium rare\nSides - Spinach with light cheese sauce, perfect amount to share and not too cheesy.  Twice baked potato, fair rating from me only because my wife makes an exceptional twice baked potato.  This is enough to share though.\n\nNow here is the problem:\nJure took the order and then after a reasonable amount of time, he has his guy bring out the sides (beets, potato, spinach and bread), and ONE STEAK!  He proceeds to arrange that one steak in the middle of the table.  Finally, Jure comes by and I asked did you know we ordered two steaks?  He says yes, it is coming and to SHARE THIS ONE!  I looked quizzically at my wife, like did he just say that and leave?  I flagged him down when he popped from the kitchen.  Jure, what do you mean share the steaks?  He replies, your steak is not ready, it will be soon.  Okay, I respond thinking this might be a minute or two.  Half a drink later and my wife uncomfortably asking if I will share with her (mood changing to black).  I asked Jure again, what happened?  He finally said, \"someone took my steak\".  I replied back, no someone took my steak, why did you bring out all the food if it was not ready or a full order?  He apologized and said he would make it right.  I know that there was nothing he could do.  Anyway, finally a steak arrives and again it was the best steak that I have ever eaten.  \n\nNO ACCOUNTING DEDUCTIONS ON THE BILL FOR THIS FIASCO!!!\n\nTo spare my wife embarrassment, I did not engage with Jure anymore nor did I suggest an adjustment.  We simply paid and left.\n\nSorry Osso, but you really blew this one.\n\nSadly, I will not be back, but since we live in the Bay Area there are many other top notch steak houses that we will be happy to try.", "author": "Jay S."}

Nob Hill, waiter in a suit, big huge comfy booths, something very romantic about this place.  We made reservations for 6pm and upon our arrival it was very mellow, but as the time went on filled up.  It felt nice to be there when it was early and quiet.  Our waiter was a professional, like took his shit very seriously.  Cocktail menu was pretty nice and the moscow mojito caught my eye.  It was delicious and I quickly sucked down 2 before the food even came!! The cheesy skillet bread is a MUST.  I only eat bread & dairy on Sat & Sun, and it was a Sat and my birthday, so I fuct that thing up!!! Soooo good.  Like last meal good. MUST order. The waiter also highly recommended the Brussels sprout chips, but that was the only dish I could have done with out.  It was just like kale chips, and as I said it was the weekend and I was tryna go hard.  But luckily the massive bone in steak quickly came and did not leave me wanting. We went with medium rare, as the house suggests, but after one bite we both found our steaks to be a little too rare for our tasting.  We asked if they could do it medium, and in a few minutes we each had brand new steaks cooked to medium perfection.  The waiter was very eager to ensure we were satisfied and yowza we truly were.  Just a beautiful meat experience.  We also had  the creamed spinach (maybe the best I have ever had) and a baked potato to split.  Usually bubba and I shoot the shit during our meals, but once the meat was present.  It was pretty silent except for a few moans of ecstasy and awe struck dumb comments on how delicious this dinner was. I felt like such a 30 year old WOMAN finishing my massive steak before my man and with no shame. This was a very special meal.  I will never forget it.

Didn't visit the bar on this go round but it looked like it was worth coming back to check out. \nI started with the asparagus soup and had the bone in rib-eye plus a half dungeness crab for my main. Side note about their crab: they only buy crabs that are 2 lbs or larger so you should expect a massive amount of crab. \nThe soup was decent. It had a nice flavor but wasn't really a stand out. I could pass on this next time. \nThe bone-in rib-eye was perfect. They use dry-aged prime beef so you are getting a really high quality piece of meat. It was about 2 inches thick and it had a nice crispy crust with a warm pink center. It will come medium-rare (probably most enjoyable this way)  unless you specify otherwise. \nThe crab was also excellent. It's coated in a savory garlic butter sauce so you don't really need additional butter. Wear that crab bib though, it's pretty messy. \nIf you're looking for a good steak in SF and a little local flavor as well with the dungeness crab, Osso is a great option.

Not knowing anything about steak houses in the area I searched Yelp to see the best options. \n\nWhen I landed on Osso Steakhouse and read the reviews I was sold! I made the reservation through Open Table about a month in advance. \n\nOn the day of our reservation we hit an insane amount of traffic and had to call to push our reservation time back by 30 minutes. The first time I called there was no answer. A few minutes later I tried again and was able to get through to the host. I told her the situation and she pushed the reservation back 30 minutes. \n\nWhen we finally arrived we left our car with the valet. Upon entering the restaurant were greeted by two hosts. We gave them our name and they seated us in a booth right away. \n\nAfter a few minutes at the table our server came to take our drink order. Husband had a Peroni and I opted for a Vanilla Soda. A few minutes later a food runner came out with some bread and butter. \n\nWe started our meal by sharing the house salad. Don't let the size of this salad fool you! We shared it and it was just the right amount of food to curb our appetite without spoiling our meal. All the ingredients were extremely fresh and crisp. \n\nFor entrees, husband had the bone-in (Osso) filet mignon and I opted for the half crab. We also ordered a side of creamed spinach and a baked potato to share. When the food arrived my husband was grinning from ear to ear at his massive filet mignon. The steak was juicy and extremely flavorful and cooked medium rare as he requested. The crab was tasty too! The half crab was 5-6 crab legs cooked in a garlic butter sauce. The sides were just as good as the entrees. I highly recommend the creamed spinach. It was excellent and not too creamy. The baked potato was delicious as well. \n\nFor dessert, we chose the vanilla panna cotta. My husband had his usual espresso and I paired it with a latte. The panna cotta was the perfect end to our meal. It was light and the vanilla flavor was not too overpowering. \n\nWe were not blown away by the service here. It was good but not great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-11-20", "description": "Last night, I made a reservation for 4 people to have a wonderful experience at Osso after I raved about how awesome the food and service was. However, we received a completely different experience than the other two times I have eaten here. We started off with a few apps; I ordered the signature soup which came with no spoon. I waited a bit to ask our waiter for one but after 5 minutes passed, I decided to hunt down my own spoon before my soup got cold. \n\nThe waiter was extremely apologetic for not providing a spoon and apologized for our food taking a bit longer than expected (60-70 minutes after we placed it). We were chatting and didn't mind and decided to order a few more cocktails while we waited.\n\nOur waiter stopped by a second time to apologize for not having our food yet. I told him if our food wasn't here in the next 5 minutes we were going to leave since he already stop by 15 minutes prior to apologize; all while still waiting for our 2nd round of drinks that never seem to arrive either. After getting slightly annoyed with the waiter our food arrived. \n\nWhen we received the 2 petite filets which were supposed to be cooked med-rare. We sliced into both only to discover they were both cooked medium to well done. One of my guests returned their filet and didn't want to reorder since the first filet took an hour (so he ate the side of Mac N Cheese while still waiting for his cocktail). Since the service was at a snail pace we thought we would be proactive and order our desserts so we didn't have to wait another hour. We should have known better. \n\nWe received the dessert menu only to wait another 15 minutes for the waiter to come back. At this point, our water glasses were empty, we had no cocktails, the filets were cooked wrong, one guest had to leave due to the time--needless to say we were over it! Meanwhile, we are watching the table next to us go through the exact same scenario as we just experienced.  \n\nI asked for our check. They brought it right away saying they discounted us for the filet (we only cut into but never tasted). A discount? We returned it which technically doesn't make it a discount. We hand over our cards before the waiter left so we didn't have to wait. Only to find ourselves waiting to get our cards and check back from the waiter. The waiter said he wanted to give us a comp'd dessert. We told him we just wanted to leave the building but he insisted on giving us the dessert. He returned a few minutes later with the dessert and our cards. We signed the bill and left the dessert. \n\nOn our way out the door one of my guests decided to mention the experience to the front end manager. Half way into the conversation I nudged my friend and said, \"let's go he doesn't give 2 cent about your story\". \n\nWith all the restaurants in SF, this is by far one of the worst dining experiences I have received in the 10 years I have lived here. I can easily say, I will NEVER return back to Osso. It was such an embarrassing and horrible experience--what a waste of time! I would give this place zero stars if I could.", "author": "Tim A."}

Everything that is, except for good steak, or good food period. \n\nOsso is a parody of a fancy restaurant, and eating here is like living out the reality of an Onion article that satirizes the lengths to which people will go to justify the 4 Star yelp rating that sucked them inside in the first place. \n\nWe started with oysters, some of which were great, but others had barely any meat in the shell. The ribeye was massive and at least 2-2.5 inches thick, which sounds appealing until you realize that your medium rare steak is unevenly cooked. We sent ours back because some parts were still completely raw. On top of that, the steak was basically unseasoned, so in addition to bringing your own wine, I'd recommended you also BYOBBQS (bring your own barbecue sauce). \n\nThe sea bass was overcooked to the texture of rubber and served on a bed of iceberg lettuce, doused in what I'm assuming is a sauce made purely out of Kikkoman soy sauce. \n\nThe side of vegetables and potatoes were cooked in so much oil that you could literally feel the oil seeping through and pooling in your mouth with every bite. \n\nAdd on top of that the fact that your server will probably forget to refill your water and yet rush you to box up your food and get the check, and you have what is the most underwhelming and disappointing facade of fine dining there ever was. \n\n1 star solely for the fact that they have a little jar of Andes mints at the front.", "author": "Angela W."}

Upon arrival the hostess appeared to not be able to find our 7:30pm reservation, then proceeded to ask for confirmation of my reservation (never been asked this before, but OK). She typed on the computer for a few minutes, handed me my phone back and we were escorted to our seats.\n\nOnce at the table the wait staff was very friendly and promptly brought our water, wine, bread, and appetizers. Caught up in conversation and the romance of the evening, we didn't realize how much time had passed and we still had not received our entrees of shrimp garlic noodles and sea bass with sides of potatoes and spinach. No big deal...it's vday...they are probably running behind. After awhile, we realized we hadn't seen our waiter since he brought our appetizers and appeared to be avoiding our table. Finally we were able to flag him down and he seemed oblivious to our concerns that we had not received our food yet. He said he would check and came back to say our food would be ready in 2mins.\n\nDuring this time, one of the bus-boys that had passed our table a few times throughout the evening noticed that we still had bread on the table and no entrees. Just out of curiosity he came over and asked what was going on. We explained that our reservation was at 7:30pm and now at 9pm, we are still waiting for our meals. We asked to see the manager and without hesitation he brought the manager. Please note we have not seen our waiter since the 2min update 10mins ago.\n\nThe manager came over and we expressed our concerns. He said he would look into what was going on and agreed the timing was unacceptable. A few minutes later the manager arrived with complimentary glasses of wine, but no update on the food. 10mins later we left - food still had not arrived. \n\nWe spent 2hrs at this restaurant on Valentine's Day and ended up having dinner at Jack-in-the-Box.

Osso came up because she had eaten there and loved her crispy chicken. My Experience was not great. Service was slow and inattentive. My $14 cocktail was marginal. Waited 30-40 minutes for our entree after appetizers were served. My appetizer was the crab crostini. The smoked salmon on it was sliced so thick that I couldn't taste any other ingredients. My entree, crispy chicken was lukewarm and not crispy at all and the potato vegetables were also lukewarm and soaked in warm chicken fat. When I stated that my dish was cold the waiter asked if I'd like for him to have it warmed up. $26 for a half chicken.  For what I paid for my meal, I was expecting much more.

Atmosphere is upscale minus the green lit glasses. It reminded me of the great Gatsby theme.  Bathrooms are located on the A floor, you need to exit and make a left u turn into the elevator, then go down one floor. \n\nWhat we ordered:\n\n-Asparagus soup, personally it was ok, but the hubby loved it. He said it tasted like mongo beans. \n-Calamari fritta, you really can't mess up calamari. This was delicious, and enjoyed eating this with my Caesar salad. There are also deep fried bell peppers and lemon slices that compliments the calamari. \n-Caesar salad, shaved Parmesan and mini croutons with ever bite. The dressing was not heavy and it was light. I really appreciated that the croutons were smaller pieces because I could enjoy every bite and crunchy texture. \n-Roast crab, deshelled that bad boy like it was nothing. No shame in my game, hahaha I am Filipino and I will get a crackin'. Our servers were amazed at how fast and efficient I was at opening the roast crab.\n-Bone in ribeye, this was a beauty. I almost felt like crying. It glistened in it's juiciness when it arrived on our table. So good and flavorful. I love bone in (giggity) I feel that there is so much flavor that is added to the meat. \n-Twice baked potato, this was so delicious. Imagine the creamy consistency of mashed potato in a baked potato topped with cheese and bacon. \n-Ube panna cotta, our wonderful server suprised us with dessert. Sachin you are awesome! I love ube and panna cotta. It was perfect because it was not too sweet with a custard consistency. \n\nDrinks: bulleit old fashion, root beer\n\nWe killed the starters but had plenty of leftovers for the next day of the ribeye and crab. Nomnomnom. Had leftovers for brunch. I placed some of the crab meat on top of the twice baked potato and ribeye meat on the side. Just as good as the night before and super juicy.

For my first impression I liked that the seating was in booths because I have a 1 year old and it's just easier for me to have him in the booth next to me rather than in a high chair (but that's only my preference.) Secondly, they have a section in their drink menu as \"Mocktails\"! If you are a Mom and your child is still getting breast milk you will understand my excitement. There are very few restaurants that already have a section for these types of drinks. Sometimes you don't want soda or tea or juice, and just want a \"fake drink\". Well, this place has it. I ordered a \"Nojito\" - obviously a Mojito with no alcohol. It was soo good!! \n\nAs first timers, we decided on the large skillet of mussels, the chorizo cheese bread, a dozen oysters, asparagus soup, the big bone in (Osso) filet mignon, side of mushrooms, salted caramel vanilla crunch cake.\n\n-Mussels: were good, but honestly you can't get this item wrong. But still, I recommend it.\n-Chorizo Cheese Bread: Chorizo wouldn't be my first choice, but this bread lived up to all the hype that the reviews made it to be. Definitely a must. The portion is very generous so for 2 people you'll definitely have left overs. \n-Oysters: 2.99 each. For my taste in oysters my first preference is salty and creamy but these were not creamy and yet it was still very delicious!! Small and tasty!\n-Asparagus soup: I only ordered this because they didn't have mashed potato as a side option for my son. This soup was too salty for my liking. Next time Id pass on this. My son eats anything but even he didn't want this. (He was given house bread instead and loved that by the way.) \n-The bone in Osso filet: dun dun dun..... this is their famous steak. Previous posts refer to it as being 40 oz but it is now actually 30 oz. Thick, tasty, perfectly cooked to our medium rare, seared to perfection. Definitely recommend this as a first timer and a great dish to share for 2 people. We still had plenty of left overs. Also, this was only $60. If you eat out often then you'd know this was cheap. We go to a restaurant in the Mission called Hog & Rocks often for oysters and just this week they had a special that was $120 for a 32 oz Tomahawk Steak. They aren't a steakhouse so I'm betting this steak is still better and it's half the price!\n-Mushroom: went well with the steak\n-Salted Caramel Vanilla Crunch Cake: all I'm going to say is that this is so good. Get it and try for yourself!!!!! \n\nDon't forget to validate your valet ticket! We had a great experience last night (celebrating Father's Day early) and would definitely be back again.

Good food and overall service has been great when we've been seated but here's the thing: they are flakey and I would say they can't truly be trusted to hold a reservation, especially on a weekend.\n\nLast time we had a reservation for a birthday celebration on a Friday, we took a taxi from our apartment, showed up 5 minutes early, got in there, and they proceeded to tell us that it'd be at least a 45 minute wait before we were seated. Basically, they had given away our table to someone more important and proceeded to turn us away when we pressed for our table. \n\nWhen I asked what the deal was, they didn't have anything to say...just that the table had been given away and they were sorry. Thanks! Emailed them about the poor experience and heard nothing back. Would be a one star review but I've had some good dinners here so it's not all bad but the fact remains: Diners need to take caution. Won't be back for celebratory dinner.", "author": "Jason P."}

We made a table reservation via open table & were seated promptly. The service after that left much to be desired. \nThe server took his time to come, didn't really talk much about the menu items. The bread was okay, the butter was so hard that you couldn't spread it on the bread. \n\nThe filet I ordered was tender and delicious. Our friends ribeye (which they said they'd be sharing) wasn't cut. We had to wait to catch the severs attention to get that cut. There were no steak knives provided to eat the steak. We had to ask for it. The Diet Coke didn't arrive and we had to ask for it twice and then got it after dinner was served. \nHe got us panacotta on the house to make up for it which was nice. But nothing of the experience would compel me to be a regular here.", "author": "Wildeflower M."}

They were pretty accommodating to seat us half an hour early. We weren't expecting to be sat and was just planning to wait at the bar, but thanks!!\n\nWorking in the restaurant industry, I will admit it, Valentine's Day is the worst freaking holiday to work, so I understand the lack of service the weekend of. However, our server Jack was on top of his game. You could tell he was going kind of crazy with all these tables in his section, but he still took the time to make sure everything came out great and none of our food contained dairy (allergy). I was expecting the dairy part to mess up somewhere, like it usually does when a restaurant is busy, but nope! He came through and everything came out excellent. \n\n-Moscow Mojito: Made to perfection! Ever since I came back from Puerto Rico, I cannot drink Mojitos the same but THIS one was deliciousssss\n-40 oz. Bone-In Ribeye: 32 oz of PURE MEAT! Cooked medium rare to perfection and SUPER THICK! Definitely took it home for leftovers\n-Crispy Roasted Potatoes - The seasoning had so much flavor, you don't even need ketchup for these!\n-Brussels Sprouts: Not sure if the right wording is correct, but these were \"de-leaved\" and had just the right amount of crisp. Not too much citrus taste either.\n-Guava Passion Fruit Sorbet: SO light, smooth and creamy! Either this isn't really sorbet or they make it in house...no way can this be pure sorbet though because I had a slight reaction to it causing my throat to get all itchy, but it was kind of worth it because it was soooo good.\n\nIf the service was great with all the Vday madness that night, I can only imagine how great it would be if we came on a non-holiday night. The entire experience here was just amazing. Loved the ambiance too! Comfy chairs and cozy decor. The green accent lights in the bar and lounge area gave it a Wizard of Oz vibe, pretty cool.

We had reservations and were sat right away. We really enjoyed our chorizo cheese bread and bone in filet. The reason for only two stars is because of it waiter, Joshua. He did not make our experience memorable nor did we feel welcome. We felt as if we were just another table and just trying to get us out for the next table. Other wait staff filled our drinks the entire time and were much more friendly! \nWhen our food came, the filet was delicious. Not one time did Joshua ask how our food was, how we were, or if we would like another glass of wine or drink. It was almost comical because I counted 8+ times that he walked by our table and not one word. With many years of experience in restaurant management this type of service is not acceptable for such a upscale restaurant. \nIt was disappointing to celebrate such a joyous occasion at this restaurant. My fianc\u00e9 advised the host it was my birthday. Another waiter brought a pana cotta with a candle which was sweet, but this is after Joshua asked us if we wanted dessert (which I ordered not knowing a pana cotta was coming).

Located on the ground floor of the Gramercy Towers, the restaurant was a bit difficult to find. We ended up passing the restaurant and missing the free valet sign. \n\nThe ambiance was charming. A mix of classy and chic, with its leather seated booths. I enjoyed the large kitchen window, which allowed me to catch glimpses of the busy chefs at work. I also enjoyed our server, who was sweet and friendly. \n\nFood-wise: delicious! Our meal was good and satisfying!\n\nDouble mussel, double shrimp, double crab (4/5):  First of all, the portion was huge! Instead of one platter, each item was brought out on its own platter. Of the three, I liked the mussels and crab best. The shrimp dried out a bit fast since it was sitting on the hot skillet platter. \n\nBone-in filet mignon (5/5): I've been wanting to try to the New York New York bone-in. But since it's 32 oz, and there were only the two of us, we opted for the 16 oz. The steak was so delicious. I couldn't get over the pan sear, which created this nice flavorful crunch. Meanwhile, the inside was cooked to a perfect, tender, and juicy medium rare. Mmm, I'm salivating just thinking about it. \n\nWhile I thoroughly enjoyed the food here, there were a few flaws. The somewhat obscure location to start. Then, our service could have been better. We were in a bit of a rush to leave for a show, but we couldn't locate our server. When we finally found him, he took a while to return with our bill. We ended up bringing our bill to the hostess area since the server never returned to take our payment. Finally, the restroom! The restaurant does not have its own restroom and requires patrons to exit the restaurant and take the elevator down. Unfortunately, there is only one elevator and it is slow. I happened to venture to the restroom at the same time when the janitor was working and using the elevator to get to different floors. My trip to restroom ended up being a 15-minute journey.", "author": "Marti L."}

Very flavorful, garlicky dressing and crispy croutons, finished off with some goat-tasting cheese\n-I liked the panna cotta, but my friends thought it was overly sweet. Rich vanilla pudding topped off with sweet whipped cream\n-Andes dark chocolate at the reservation table!!\n-Chorizo cheesy bread was good\n\nCons:\n-We had reserved a table weeks in advance for 8PM, and got seated around 8:40PM....\n-Everything is fried, served in a puddle of butter, and somehow, still slightly bland - applies to the shrimp, \"roasted\" vegetables, steak, and chorizo bread\n-Kind of weird but the food came in a different order than listed on the menu...\n-The steak was cooked well, although the sides weren't seared and the middle was a little too bloody-red to be medium-rare\n-Our booth was blindingly green\n-Overall, a very subpar meal.

They were very accommodating and sat us in the side room that we had all to ourselves. Great! \n\nThe waiter came in and started spouting off instructions about how to order most efficiently given the kitchen was closing shortly, fine...it's late. We get it. After asking him to bring out some appetizers for the table (at his suggestion, an instruction we would come to regret), he proceeded to bring our tray, after tray, after tray of food...before we even had our entrees ordered! Fine, we would just be super full. Not the first time. \n\nFlash forward to bill time (after an otherwise enjoyable remainder of the dinner), it turns out the waiter selected an abalone dish for the bulk of the appetizers, which was actually one of the most expensive ENTREES on the menu...not even an appetizer...and had delivered 10 plates at $70 per plate!?

However I was told by the server that any steak would take at least 30 mins to cook thus making me feel like I had to hurry and order rather then relax. So I ordered my main coarse and settled in to enjoy the appetizer. Not to long after receiving my appetizer. The main coarse arrived. Thus having me to relinquish the appetizer for the main coarse to have a place. I asked for softened butter for the bread and the server looked incensed that I would ask.

The service is good, they come by often to check on how you're doing but maybe a bit too often.  We had the bread, potstickers, soup and salad.  Bread was okay, nothing special, potstickers, soup and salad were good but nothing to rave about.  We had the bone-in ribeye, petite filet and the sea bass.  The petite came on a plate that was too big for the size of the steak but the steak itself was okay.  The ribeye was huge but chewy and tough for the price paid.  The sea bass was just okay, two pieces one was moist and cooked just right the other piece was overcooked and couldn't be cut through without a knife.  Desserts were the best part of the meal, we had the crepe br\u00fbl\u00e9e cheesecake and the lemoncello cake, both were very good.

Both huge foodies- i was a pastry chef and he works in a very very large food industry company. We were excited to make great memories and had high hopes. We check in and inform the hostess at 5:40pm that we had rsvp for 6:00pm. She then tells us that they don't have reservations for us. I had to convince her that I did actually call on Friday the 29th exactly at 5:30pm- to get us our slot. After we get confirmation for checking in- I overhear this woman next to me tell the other hostess that she has reservations at 6:15pm, the hostess asks her if she has checked in- which she hasn't. So she had to walk to the end of the line and check in like everyone else. It becomes 6:08 and the floor manager or supervisor starts chit chatting with the couple that had rsvp for 6:15pm and gives them a table on the sly. What is going on...?? I even saw two other couples with a 6:15 reservation  that were actually there before us- still waiting! Seriously???? Is this racism that I'm seeing??? Really??? I went up to the front desk and confronted him about our rsvp.  He had the nerve to act all high, mighty and pretentious while he lied, stating that the couple had a earlier rsvp than us. I told him that I overheard her informing the hostess that she had a 6:15pm reservation. He then goes on about how she checked in earlier than us. NO. I told him that I know we got there earlier and checked in earlier than them. A waiter overhears all this and steps in to tell me that the next table will be ours. We finally get seated. Had to wait for another waiter to step in and open our wine- blah blah blah. And in the end. Guess what???? They double charged the credit card. This place was recommended by my brother who brings his clients here. I'm disappointed that I won't be able to tell him that I liked this place.

Green lighting and gold all around. \n\nThe highlights of the meal- \n\nappetizer: yellowtail carpaccio. I've had this elsewhere before and wasn't impressed so when they didn't have beef carpaccio I gave it another try since our waitress highly recommended it. And man, it was SOO good. We devoured the entire plate in like 30 seconds. Cut thinly, even slices, super fresh but the star was the ponzu sauce. *DROOL* \n\nsides: roasted potatoes and vegetables. Yes it doesn't sound glamorous but the other sides were so heavy like mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, creamed corn. And with the roasted potatoes and vegetables you get lots of vegetables-broccoli, brussell sprouts, cauliflower, carrots and olives. IT WAS AMAZING. They flash fry the vegetables so it's SO crispy and the spices on top was so flavorful. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful side. It's meant to be shared with the entire table as it's the most expensive side on the side menu- $15 but so worth it compared to ordering two sides. \n\nmeat: porterhouse, what what. Boyfriend enjoys the new york steak and I enjoy filet mignon and the porterhouse - you get both! cooked separately. It was what we were gonna order anyways but now we save $5 hahaha. You do need to agree on the temperature but who is eating their steak other than medium rare!? WHAT ARE YOU DOING!? The meats had a crispy crunch on the top and it was cooked perfectly. The filet mignon is soft and tender and the new york steak was chock full of flavor. \n\nWe also ordered the skillet-chorizo bread.. it was good but it didn't blow my mind. If we didn't order it, it wouldn't have been a deal-breaker in our overall experience. It was good but not a highlight. \n\nFor drinks, he had a house red and I had the guava prosecco.

Not the case. Service was excellent, and the food at this traditional steakhouse was top-notch across the board. We devoured the salad, chorizo skillet bread, mussels and shrimps (extra), veggies, petite filet mignon, and panna cotta. It was more than enough and we left stuffed.\n\nThe restaurant itself may be not the most exciting place as it clearly caters to an older crowd, but the food and service were awesome.", "author": "Valerie L."}

It's almost like you would have to know the place existed in order to come here because there is zero curb appeal.  \n\nInside the decor is posh and old money. Above the restaurant is a condo complex which costs approximately 1.3 to 2.5 million per unit. I mention this so you get a better perspective of the overall ambiance. Being a steak house I had to order the steak, porterhouse to be exact. A 32 Oz beast that was rubbed with spices and came with greens. I took a photo of this monster so I would have a clear visual of a dream that had become reality. The flavor of the rub was very juicy, soft and flavorful.  I also enjoyed a very pleasant marlot. The price range starts around $50 and heads upward to $100 per steak. Add in your wine, appetizers and extras and you could easily spend 300+ as a couple. I came with a group of friends for a birthday celebration. Our bill was almost 5k. \n\nBy the time we were leaving the place was pretty full so if you decide to come make reservations to avoid waiting.", "author": "Tracy J."}

Friendly staff, old New York vibe and great food. The day we arrived, the valet in the front was free with a restaurant validation. So we tipped $5 on the drop off and $5 on the pick up. If you have never been here, you probably should pull into the small lot the have in front since it's probably the safest spot to drop off the valet.\n\nThe Bone-in Rib Eye is flavorful and tender. I am not sure if the cut is aged or not, but I will say that if it is... they failed. Absolutely no aged flavor but rather a very fresh steak. It's extremely thick and cooked perfectly! (We ordered Medium Rare, the way every steak should be cooked). I would say pretty much the same look and size of a steak you would get from a New York Steakhouse. Perfect char and caramelization.\n\nThe dinner bread I think is not free but maybe under a buck?! Even if it was $5, it would TOTALLY be worth it. Probably one of the BEST breads I have had ever, perfect density, lots of nooks, thick crunchy crust and perfect chew. It took my butter and cradled it similar to an English muffin. \n\nTheir chorizo cheese bread... absolutely amazing! Same bread but cheesy, buttery, chorizo flavored goodness. You HAVE TO try it.\n\nThe fried baby onions sound great but I think there is too much onion and not enough breading. Still good but I'll stick to onion strings or something less dense inside the breading.\n\nThe fried potato side dish was fabulous! Buttery, perfectly crisp and crunchy bite size potatoes. Definitely a winner.\n\nAll of the deserts were underwhelming. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e cheesecake was not cheesecake at all. If this was made fresh, the pastry chef deserves to be fired. It looked, tasted and had the texture of powered ingredients and I would absolutely never order it again or suggest that anyone ever orders it. I think we had a passion/guava sorbet... tasted like regular sorbet with some guava pur\u00e9e. And last, it was my birthday so they surprised me with a purple vanilla pudding type custard. I hate to criticize a free birthday dessert but it just tasted like a generic vanilla pudding and was a bit too sweet. They actually give you a decent portion size with all the deserts, and in every case, I think they were too big in size based on the flavors. Lastly, there is absolutely nothing chocolate on the dessert menu. What's up with that?\n\n***\n\nNow... the main purpose for me to post this review. Obviously the food is great over here... and you go to a nice restaurant, expect to pay a premium because of all the fresh ingredients and finer cuts of meat etc. I have seen some shady things at some places... usually smaller mom and pop places who don't know better or the classic automatic gratuity some restaurants apply to all bills (which is definitely bullshit since gratuity should never be implied as it is supposed to be based on your experience/level of service. \n\nI would NEVER expect to go into a fine dining restaurant and see an automatic TAX on my meal based on the cost of running a business. To elaborate, there is a note on the menu, at the bottom, stating, \n\n\"4.9% will be added to all checks, in part to help offset the cost of doing business & government mandated expenses\"\n\nThis is probably one of the top dishonorable business practices which you would impose on your guests. The cost of doing business is simply that... incorporate that into your $1 bread or add a few bucks onto your steaks or sides. The fact that you are openly taxing people for the cost of you doing business is out right crap and shameful. Second, the cost of doing business... and government mandated expenses... are the SAME THING. I own a business and know that I have to account for all my expenses including government mandated expenses, payroll, rent, materials prices rising, electricity etc etc etc. I have never seen any business charge someone a tax on their cost of doing business. You just add that into your costs. We all already think that the government taxing us for everything is bull... now we have restaurants taxing us in addition to our bill total. Just add it in, I don't mind paying more for good food, what's the difference between a $62 steak and a $65 steak?? I do mind having another Uncle Sam though. Third, on top of this shady business, you are playing a numbers game just like all the other big boys. What's up with 4.9%?? If you're going to steal from me (not incorporating it into your original committed prices), then don't play with my emotions! 4.9% is the same as 5%. Last I checked, this is a steakhouse... not a gas station \"$2.99 99/100\" per gallon, not a government and not a sale \"$99.95\". Taxes are BS and the last place I would expect to see this behavior is from a quality restaurant. Shame on you for that.", "author": "Chris B."}

We were at an event across the street at Grace Cathedral that was running late.  We had a 9:15 reservation that we moved to 9:30 and then to 9:45.  When I saw that perhaps even the 9:45 might not be a possibility, I called the restaurant to explain what was going on.  Nate was SO incredibly kind and informed me the kitchen closed at 10:00 but if we could get ourselves there before 10:00, then we'd still be served.  We got there at 9:55 and granted, with the glassed-in kitchen, every eye in there was looking our way like, \"Are you kidding us?!?!\" and yes, our server while not blatant in his, \"Don't dawdle, this place is shutting down any minute,\" we could feel the pressure to keep it moving.  And then, Nate came over to our table to ask how everything was and said, \"Listen, slow down.  Enjoy your meal.  We're here for you all, so please take your time.\"  Now THAT, kids is customer service!  And then on top of that, he was kind enough to ask more about the event we attended across the street.  \n\nOh, and as for the food...this may sound like an odd favorite to have at a steakhouse, but OMG the roasted brussels sprouts and crispy potatoes are lick-the-plate good (but don't try licking the hotter than Hades cast iron skillet the 'taters come in).   And yeah, the steaks are Jurassic-sized, so if you order anything other than the petite filet, you better not have eaten all day or be prepared to take some of it home.", "author": "Kim H."}

Hundreds, nay, thousands of cows have entered my mouth in infinite shapes and form for me to decide that Osso was the most perfect bite of steak I've ever had.\n\nLet's start with the context. Valentine's Day, 2015. I was with my girlfriend, and my OpenTable reservation rewarded us with prime seating next to the window. The interior wasn't flabbergasting, nothing crazy, but it was intimate enough to enjoy the night with great steak and a fine bottle of wine.\n\nWe both got the bone-in filet mignon (my fav cut) of varied sizes. Both medium rare, although you could easily get away with rare here. \n\nThey season their steaks with garlic and butter and delicious herbs. The result is a tender steak with an ever so crispy exterior that is literally bursting with flavor. Wow, my mouth salivates just thinking of it.\n\nFor apps, we got fried calamari and brussels sprouts, both good, but not remarkable. We brought our own wine, so I cannot report on that. The service, however, was pristine.\n\nIt's not the cheapest place, but it was worth every cent. They gave us a beautiful evening, filled with flavor and romance. Thanks for setting the standard, we will come here again.

We were seated at a raised booth.  Very nice.  The space is a bit reminiscent of the old Fog City Diner, but much swankier.

It was recommended by my Auntie. The table was set up in a rectangular shape in a beautiful room. We brought our own wine, they opened the bottles but left the wines on the table & walked away. I started pour, realizing they didn't come back to pour the wines  After pouring 4 glasses & passing it, someone asked if I wanted him to pour it. I told him that would be nice. We ordered the chorizo bread which was yummy but very hot. They left it on the corners of my table. When I asked if they could put it more in the center of each sectioned table, the waiter said it was hot & we could pass it ourselves. That was the second strike. We ordered crab for the table, they wanted to place it right in front of where I was sitting & told me it would be good if I moved my chair (not in a polite manner). It was more like can't you see you need to move cuz I have this platter in my hand. I had to serve the entire table myself, after asking for some plates. Isn't it their job? They said they couldn't walk around to certain areas of our table & he actually demonstrated for me. Maybe they should have repositioned the table better, so one dinner guest doesn't have to serve the rest of the table & everyone passes food around. After the meal, had to look for waiter to get the dessert menu. Then after dessert, had to look for someone to get us our check. Chorizo bread, calamari, crab & ribeye were good. Sides were small & service lacking!  Usually I tip well, but my siblings & I agreed, service didn't warrant a good tip, since it was mostly self serve. I even had to ask for crab crackers & they told me they only had a few, gave us 3 for 18 people. Smh... dinner was a lot of work. Not an enjoyable experience!", "author": "Nancy K."}

Because of you guys, Osso replaced them with potatoes and I was deprived of a taste. Way to ruin it for everyone else, assholes.\n\nAnyway, I typically don't like steakhouses because I find the food to be generic and pedestrian. However, this place was Osso good! It doesn't serve wagyu, but the juicy bone-in cuts made me want to gyrate against the table. We ordered the Porterhouse Osso Style to share. Both the filet and New York were cooked perfectly and had a rosemary garlic aroma. The filet was my favorite - it came with a wonderful crust and looked about rare-plus in the center.\n\nFor a light appetizer, the Yellowtail Carpaccio was the perfect precursor to our meal. Yellowtail is usually a common fish, but this dish had a delightfully unique flavor. \n\nIf you intend on ending your meal with dessert, then I recommend the pineapple cake, which was essentially a really good pineapple French toast.\n\nThe overall experience was nice, but I do have two complaints:\n\n1. A classy lady should never have to refill her own wine glass at a nice restaurant, so why was I inundated with this arduous task?\n\n2.

We started with their signature chorizo cheese bread which did not disappoint. Next were starters of scallops gratinee and a pan of wood fired shrimp.The scallops were great. but the shrimp were on the small to medium size, and they were fired with tail on and still some shell on them. It was a little work to get to them, but with the sauce that came with them, they were dee-licious. \n\nWe both had the 8 oz filet mignon, and this was by far the best steak we have ever had in entire lifetime. It was seared on both sides perfectly and cooked inside to perfection. The seared outside had a crunch to it like I have never seen. It was served in a shallow bowl with the steak's jus. Still thinking about it three days later. \n\nA la carte sides: french fried pearl onions, good, roasted mushrooms, perfect with steak, and mac and cheese, not my favorite southern style but rich, creamy, and cheesy, really good. \n\nFor dessert we split the salted caramel vanilla cake, and OMG, sooooo good, especially with a glass of bubbles to end the meal. \n\nThis is a fairly pricey place, but it is a great place for a date, a birthday, an anniversary, or any special occasion.

After being seated I waited over 15 minutes for a waiter to come to the table. After he did, I ordered a martini and asked for the shrimp skillet for the appetizer. He stopped me and upsold me on the scallops instead. I also ordered the ribeye and half a crab at the same time I ordered my martini and appetizer. My complete order was in. After another 15 minutes waiting, the martini finally arrived but it looked as if someone drank half of it. Keep in mind...it's Friday night and the place is a ghost town. 20 minutes later the scallops arrive and the server said \"be careful because the plate is hot\". The plate was hot but the two tiny scallops were cold. So here I wait another 45 minutes and nothing. The waiter is off talking to the bartender and kitchen staff and doesn't even come to the tables in his section. I finally flag him down and ask for another martini and I ask where there restroom is. He says it is downstairs and I say I hope my martini is waiting when I get back. 5 minutes later...nothing...the waiter is just standing around and tells me he forgot to put my martini order in. It's now been an hour and 20 minutes so I tell him I want the check and I'm going to Bobo's steakhouse instead. He gets the manager with a major attitude and I tell him I just want to pay and leave. He proceeds to give me a bill with 2 martinis even though I only had one because of the incompetent waiter. The waiter then buts in and says that he forgot to put my dinner order in. Stay away from this place. Read the recent reviews on yelp. This place is a horrible waste of time and money. The prices they charge for 2 undercooked VERY small scallops is a clue right there. Forget Check Please reviews...if the place was really that good, you wouldn't be able to walk in on a Friday night at 7:30 and pick whatever booth you wanted. And no Carlos...save your response.

Have tried the good ones in SF - Alexander's, A5A, Alfred's, Bobo's, Lolinda, Harris', Bob's.  Yes, I've been to HOPR, but this isn't a prime rib review.  Haven't tried Leathernecks yet, nor the chains of Morton's or Ruth's Chris'.  I feel as though my work is done, though.  Before dinner I joked about the comment in the menu that the steaks were voted best in SF - I wasn't aware of the survey and I questioned the source of the survey.  Here you go....\"Voted best steak in SF - 2017\" - my belly.\n\nSteak (bone-in filet) was outstanding and cooked perfectly.  Asparagus soup, sides, free valet, $10 corkage, you name it, you hit it all.  Now, I suppose it's time for me to go back to Chicago to see if you can expand the reach of your current city-wide trophy.  \n\nNow, you're all probably wondering why only four stars (technically 4.5).  One half star was lost due to the waiter at the other table.  This guy spent a good five minutes telling the party next to us how great Alfred's is, went over their entire menu, and told them how he used to work there.  I can only hope the people asked him what he thought about Alfred's, but, dude, you didn't stop.  Everyone in our party got this bewildered look that perhaps we were back at Alfred's.  I'm sorry, but if I'm the waiter and someone who is dining at Osso on a Tuesday night asks me where they should go for steak the following night, the answer is Osso.  \n\nGuess I'll be back in a couple months and as long as I don't have Alfred A.

We weren't seated until 7:15 (having arrived on time for our reservation) and, to make matters worse, most of the staff demonstrated pretty outrageous customer service skills, more or less cheerfully telling us to buzz off, as though it wasn't their problem at all.  No \"I'm so sorry,\" \"I understand,\" \"Can we offer you a complimentary drink while you wait,\" or any of the things you would usually expect if a restaurant completely failed to honor your reservation.  The exception was one guy who had great interpersonal skills but kept disappearing for long periods of time, even after telling us that our table was being cleaned at that moment (it was still another half hour before we sat).  On the plus side, the Crispy Potatoes and Veggies were fantastic and not as crazy overpriced as the rest of the food.  Sadly, though, with so little time to eat, I had to throw half of it away just to make the tail end of the warm-up band.  On the petty side, the staff needs to learn that the past tense of \"to seat\" is \"seated,\" as in, \"the party of three has been seated,\" not \"the party of three has been sat.\"  I normally wouldn't point this out, but I had to listen to the malapropism over and over again while waiting at the host station with no drink for an hour, so I feel compelled to mention it here.\n\nUpdate:  The manager of the restaurant followed up with me promptly by email and expressed both concern about my experience and a desire to make things right.  He invited me to give the restaurant another chance.  As I would typically go to Osso only if I had a concert next door, and that's the very situation when I'd be afraid to risk what happened last time, I'm not sure when or whether I'll be able to accept the nice offer, but I have changed my review from 2 to 3 stars as an acknowledgment of the restaurant's solicitude in following up with me.

Lol. We walked in and you what, the ambiance was definitely old school steakhouse feel, and it was pretty cool. Especially with no one there, you had that \"I'm the boss eating alone at this fancy place\" feel. Lol. \n\nSo I had to dock half a star for service. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't amazing either, considering that we were the only ones there. I had this vibe that we looked young so the waiter assume we weren't gonna have the money to tip him well. That was a bit annoying, but in the end, he picked it up, checked on us more and even gave a great dessert option but you know, you can't forget first impressions.\n\nThe other half star was the sides and apps that we ordered. Again, they weren't horrible, but for the price, they weren't amazing either. Let's say, I could have done without. For apps, we had the chorizo cheese sauce with bread, it really was just melted cheese, barely tasted the chorizo and you dip bread it in. We ordered it because it was suggested by yelp reviews but I wasn't a huge fan.  The crab cake were a little dry and tiny but it did have a good amount of crab meat. But like i said, not worth the money.\n\nLet's just move to the positive though, the STEAK! We had the filet, medium rare always, and it was to die for. I would definitely come back for that. I can rave on and on about how awesome it was because it was. Cooked to perfection, melted away in your mouth and just definitely mouth watering. At least they are about their steaks right? Lol. As for dessert, I highly recommend the sorbet refresher. You'll scan right pass it on the menu but it's light and refreshing and they really need to hype this dessert more because they don't describe this dessert justice.

As we drove up to Osso it's in a beautiful setting across the street from Grace. Cathedral. It was great to drive right up and turn the car over to the free valet parking. The Deco ambiance was very welcoming and set the mood for a lovely evening. We pretty much took the recommendations from the show and there were no disappointments. The bread with cheese was so delicious and could have been a meal by itself. We went with the featured bone in fillet and I believe it was the best steak I've ever eaten. I usually take a doggy bag but could not stop eating the entire steak it was so delicious. We also enjoyed the sides - spinach, creamed corn, baked potato.  All were excellent. The service was perfect. Non obtrusive but available, helpful and didn't miss a beat. Can't wait to go back.", "author": "Suzanne N."}

I made a reservation for my father's birthday and the man hates waiting for anything. My party of 8 arrived expecting to be seated no longer than 10 minutes because that's what happens when you have a reservation. A reservation means a table should be RESERVED AT THE AGREED TIME. The hostess told my boyfriend that there were 2 tables, a nicer one or the not so nice one. The nicer one would be a 5 more minute wait. So obviously, he agreed for the nicer table for a 5 MINUTE WAIT. WE WERE WRONG. We waited a ridiculous additional 35 minutes for a table. This is meant to be a high-class restaurant, not a Red Lobster or Applebee's. I bet I could've gotten a table when I am supposed to at those 2 locations. The hostess was NOT apologetic and OBVIOUSLY can't tell time because she made the wrong judgment and overpromised us. We would've been fine with the other table if she didn't promise we would have it in 5 minutes. She basically had the restaurant manager running from the \"nicer\" table back to us to apologize and check on the other party occupying it. Let me mention that we didn't even get the \"nicer\" table. We got placed in another table, which would've been fine without the 30+ minute wait. Get new hostesses, Osso or train them better.\nThe waiter was a nice guy. Gave us the appetizer (Boyfriend had to ask because we already waited 30+ minutes for a table) that we deserved and was accommodating to make up for the hostess' mistake. My only thing with him is that if the bone-in rib eye is normally shared among 2 people, why didn't he mention it (4 people in our party each ended ordering a rib eye for themselves)? Makes me question if he just wanted a bigger tip based off of the total.\nThe food was great. I enjoyed the appetizer. The bone-in filet mignon was delicious. Everyone loved their steaks. Dessert was great too. \nAlso, the valet is free which I appreciate but the booth is easy to miss so make sure you drive slow when getting near the restaurant unless you have been there before. \nI would love to go back here but the hostess gave us such a bad experience that I think we might take our annual steak birthday dinner somewhere else.", "author": "Rita L."}

The steaks and vegetables were served cold or luke warm, at best. We had to ask for a share plate 4 times before finally getting one. The waiter dropped an entree and several side dishes on the floor while serving us, so multiple people at our table had to wait for their meal while other people ate. To make matters worse, the person masquerading as the General Manager, doesn't spend sufficient time on the floor so she has no idea what's going on and is ill-equipped to correct situations.

Both were refreshing. \nWe ordered the chorizo cheese bread and the crab cakes for appetizers. The bread was so good! Crusty, and lots of cheese... we told ourselves we should not eat all of it, to save room for the steaks,.... but nah, all gone! The crab cakes were awesome. We ordered an extra one so we can have one each, but we sure did not need to. A very nice amount of crab! So delicious! \nFor the main course, my husband had the abalone, my son the bone-in rib eye, and i had the bone-in new york....i was going to order fish, but this being a steakhouse... the steaks were cooked properly, the huge ribeye was more blue than medium rare. The abalone was just ok, we had better. The steaks were good. The spinach and the creamed corn were excellent, the Mac and cheese did not have enough cheese. This restaurant must be very old school, no b\u00e9arnaise, no red wine sauce, no peppercorn sauce to be offered for the steaks.

We arrived at 5 PM thinking (correctly) that within an hour or so the place would start filling up (boy did it ever) and we prefer to come when places are not jammed with diners and overly bustling waiters. The only hitch when we arrived was not the restaurant's fault... we had made confirmed reservations via Open Table which somehow had not made it through to Osso's computer-- so luckily the host rectified that promptly and we were seated with a nice view out over The City. Our waiter, Tom and his backup, JP, attended to us right away and our drinks arrived promptly and our order was taken pleasantly and efficiently. Both Tom and JP were very friendly and helpful with answering questions. As we had already done a lot of feasting in San Francisco over the previous few days, we were not exactly starving so we ordered the house salad (delicious and dressed just right!) and the petit filet mignon (done on  the rare side of medium rare, perfect!) with succulent grilled  asparagus on the side (in a great light sauce!). The meal arrived in timely fashion, not to quickly, not too slowly, but timed just right. We had plenty of time to chat, linger over our meal and enjoy our last evening in The City for awhile, at least till the Giants start up again in the spring. The decor here is beautiful and the outside is very classy looking. I would not hesitate to recommend Osso to anyone looking for fine dining while in San Francisco. The only thing I would like to see is the patrons dressing better, for a place with this much finesse it is a shame to see so many of the customers arriving in rumpled sportswear and running shoes. They don't know what they are missing by not dressing the part, and if I were the manager I would insist on a dress code, that is, if one can afford to do so,  in this day and age.

The service was not good , every time it fell short , I thought to myself just let it go , but it happened too many times for it to be a one time miss. So it started with the waiter taking the wine glasses after asking if our daughters were twenty one and we said no. No sign of him for twenty minutes, then he comes and takes our order ( so far very tolerable) . Long wait for our appetizers ( again not enough to mention). My wife ordered a margarita, when it came it was mostly tequila and ice in a pint glass, after taking a few sips we had to flag down the bus boy ( because the waiter was no were to be seen) to take the drink back. She then orders a glass of house merlot instead which the waiter now says\" are you sure it's a $24 glass\".( frustration  starting ) . Along comes our main course which is only for three of us (5 were present), no sign of sides or the other main dishes. We would have finished our main before the sides showed up had we not stopped ( twenty minutes waiting  from our main dish till the others got theirs with the sides , frustration turning into anger) now our main dish is cold. We just kept quiet and had our meal. After dinner the waiter brought my wife a desert with a birthday candle, ( nice thought maybe they can pull this out of the gutter) . Then he shows up with the bill , never even asking if anyone wanted desert. We gave him back the bill and said we would like to have some desert, twenty more minutes goes by and out comes the desert after a few bites I find a hair in mine( ok now I'm pissed). The waiter comes with the bill (again) and we tell him how bad the service was, he says he will do something for us. He comes back and tells us he took the Margarita and my desert off the bill. The food was good, but the service was a big miss. I am still gaging over the thought of someone's hair in my throat. Too many coincidences, that tell me to stay away.

The restaurant is in a condo or apartment building which kills the vibe the moment you get there.  Once you walk in the door you are blasted with neon green lights everywhere and waiters in cheap mock tuxedos, it was so tacky.

We ordered two fish dishes and they were both just OK.  If you go and want fish the salmon is much better than the sea bass. The bread was hot but the butter was rock hard, all in all average.

Bobo's is well-known for their Bone-In Filet Mignon ($43.95) so we both ordered that and sides: http://bit.ly/12aLd6r.\n\nI rarely send back my food unless it's the wrong order but the bone-in filet I received looked like it was stabbed with a knife multiple times during the cooking process. Upon cutting into it, it had the texture of a fibrous brisket not a steak: http://bit.ly/10lFg8b. I alerted our waiter. He apologized and said they would rush another one out for me.\n\n25 minutes later and after Mr. NSS' food was cold, I received my second steak. It was not as stringy as the first one (it had gashes in it like the first one): http://bit.ly/11ftdel but it's nothing like Bobo's original bone-in filet that's smooth and cuts like butter. It was also aggressively overseasoned. With the first bite, it felt like my mouth was assaulted by Mr. Morton. Very disappointing and one of the worst steaks I've ever had. Our waiter did check in again but I didn't want to be a douche and send it back again. \n\nI'm no chef but I think most people can agree with me that a \"steakhouse\" chef should know better then to stab into a steak as it cooks: http://bit.ly/15ncwzb (it arrived exactly like this). \n\nOn the bright side, the Zucchini Fries ($8.95) were ridiculously good: http://bit.ly/11Qhjmd and the Moscow Mojito ($14) gave me a good buzz: http://bit.ly/13sAepb. It's a good thing you can't mess up booze.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I'm really REALLY surprised how highly rated this place is on Yelp..\n\nI love steak and eat steak quite often with clients and at business meetings, so I have a pretty high standard for what a steakhouse should be. The first rule of thumb being that the steaks should be perfectly cooked. Out of the 19 cuts of steak that we ordered, there were at least 5 that were overcooked. Most of us were just hungry and didn't want to fuss over it, but a couple of us sent it back. Our server for the night didn't give us any grief over it and apologized, which was definitely appreciated..but it was kind of ridiculous to have over 25% of the steaks come out overcooked. On top of this, they were extremely salty.. my steak was so salty that my tongue started getting that coarse uncomfortable feeling and I stopped tasting the meat altogether..\n\nSides were for the most part underwhelming.. our table ordered the creamed spinach, mac and cheese, brussel sprouts, and crispy potatoes. Nothing was really outstanding except for the mac and cheese.. that was the only good thing from the night, unfortunately. Crispy potatoes were too salty, the spinach wasn't really creamed and a bit bland.\n\nConsidering the other steakhouses in the area and the heftier price tag, the food really should have been better and didn't meet expectations. The only pluses were, 1. the ability to accommodate a larger group last minute, 2. free valet parking, and 3. our friendly server for the night - which saved this from a 1-star rating. Definitely won't be coming back", "author": "Jennifer S."}

Servers are decked out in tuxes but are never aloof.\n\nWe started with their (already legendary) chorizo cheese bread.  It's an unbelievable molten combo of those ingredients: a loaf of slightly toasted sour dough sitting inside a skillet of cheesy chorizo goodnesses.

Being in a customer service job, the first thing out of your mouth should be your name and to greet the whole table. Also he didn't bring out our salad after we requested it twice.

Don't pay the $26.00 at the parking lot right next to the restaurant...that's a mistake this dummy will never make again! Also, when you enter the valet area, you need to walk into the building and all the way back for the restaurant entrance as there is no entrance facing the street.\n\nAnyway, on to the review...The bf loves steak, so took him here for his birthday dinner. We had a great experience and our server was wonderful! I don't recall her name, but boy does she work quick! She had sass (in a good way), was understanding, and extremely helpful in offering her opinion on some of the items we wanted to try.  \n\nWe had the following (plus lots of wine of course) and it was all delicious:\n\nCrab cakes ($16.95).....I think these are the best crab cakes I've ever tasted. They were perfectly fried, full of crab flavor, and there were no little shell flakes in them (you know what I'm talking about). This tells me two things: 1) they use fresh oil and know how to not overcook seafood, and 2) they take a lot of time carefully doing prep work. Props to the chefs! I could probably eat  20 of these babies, no joke.\n\nYellowtail carpaccio ($14.94).....\"it looks like a painting,\" the bf exclaimed when it was brought out! As he's a protein nut, I think this was his favorite appetizer. Thin slices of yellowtail oozing with EVOO and ponzu deliciousness. He could probably eat 2 lbs. of this stuff. The Asian in me was thinking \"where's the rice to accompany this heavenly taste?\", ha.\n\nBeet salad ($11.95).....I know, I know, you come to a steak restaurant to eat steak, but for me, the beet salad was the surprising highlight of my meal. Don't get me wrong, the steak was a-maz-ing, but this salad went perfectly with all the heavy duty meatiness that comes from this type of dinner. Perfectly cut cubes of beets, palm, and avocado on a little butter lettuce cup garnished with goat cheese, pumpkin seed, some onion, and wonderfully tart red wine vinaigrette.  What's not to love? I would come back here just for this. The only downside, however, was that it was so small *tears*\n\nBone-in New York ($45.95) and\nSurf & Turf (half crab and filet mignon) ($59.95).....The meats were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. It was the best filet mignon both of us ever tried, and the crab was so succulent. Enough said. FYI, they give you a bib and some hand towels for the crab because it will get messy.\n\nLightly creamed spinach ($8.95).....was not impressed with this, but that serves me right for trying to get vegetables at a steak place :P \n\nSorbet refresher ($8.95).....not actually sorbet, but a GIANT three layer gelato ball dipped in chocolate. That day (I believe the flavors change) was strawberry, chocolate, and pistacchio. Yum! \n\nWould totally come back here again to try other appetizers and salads, and get a fab protein fix too.", "author": "Jamie C."}

I read that Osso Steakhouse was actually going to be the second location of Bobo's until the owners of both establishments parted ways. The first time I ate at Bobo's I tried their famous bone in filet. It was delicious!  Osso's menu is very similar to Bobo's so I couldn't wait to try their bone in filet. \n\nAtmopshere/Decor: \n\nThe restaurant is very nice. It has the 1920's era vibe. I like the design of the restaurant. It looks very elegant and high end. All of the dining tables were very nice. The color pattern and contrast throughout the restaurant goes hand and hand with the overall 1920's theme. \n\nFood: \n\nI ordered the Big Bone-In (Osso) filet mignon (premium aged steaks cooked in their natural juices with a hint of rosemary & garlic.) The bone in filet was good. It had a nice flavor. The only issues were I ordered my steak medium rare but it was overcooked to medium almost medium well. I noticed the texture was a little off. This was probably due to my steak being over cooked. I noticed my girlfriend's regular filet was way more juicy and tender compared to my bone-in filet. That shouldn't be. A bone-in filet should have more flavor and marbling compared to a regular filet. My steak would have been excellent if it was medium rare. The rosemary and garlic made the steak even taste better.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Filet Mignon. She loved her filet! She said it was one of the better filets she's eaten. She said her steak was beyond tender and very flavorful. We both agreed that her steak tasted better than mine. \n\nWe also ordered the Mac & Cheese chorizo spiced and Brussels Sprouts with bacon. The Mac & Cheese didn't taste like mac & Cheese at all. It tasted like pasta with artificial cheese. It wasn't creamy or cheesy. It had a watery cconsistency. The Brussels Sprouts with bacon were just okay. I didnt like the parmesan cheese on the Brussels Sprouts. It gave them a funny taste.\n\nService: \n\nOur waiter Ian was pretty good but he wasn't as attentive as I would have liked him to be. He asked us how everything was when we were half way through our steaks. Of course I don't want to be bothered every single second but I think it's very important for a server to ask you if the steak is cooked to your liking especially when your dining at a steakhouse. I didn't say anything because it would have taken another 30 minutes to cook a new steak and we were on a time schedule. \n\nOverall:\n\nOsso is a pretty good steakhouse. The ambiance is really nice. Even though my steak was overcooked it still tasted really good. Rarely do you ever see a bone in filet on a steakhouse menu. You should definitely try a bone in filet if you haven't already. The side dishes I tried at Osso were lacking and fell short. I noticed their online menu doesn't have the ounce size listed for their steaks. Most steakhouses list the ounce size for their steaks on their online menus. I'm not sure why Osso doesn't. If you want a good steak give Osso a try.", "author": "David R."}

Next, we had the sizzling mussels & scrimp, topped with herbed butter which was also very flavorful. The salad was alright, nothing special. Our 16oz bone in filet finally came out and it was huge! Usually the bone takes up a good portion, but the bone was tiny and the steak was ginormous! I recently ate at Harry's in Cancun, and Osso's was definitely more well seasoned. I ate probably about about half if even and then I was defeated. The roasted veggies were probably my favorite, I think they were deep fried, so perfectly and topped with a furikake seasoning.

Big comfy booths, a retro black and white checkered floor, and classy lighting for an old-school feel, which I love. The sides are not to be missed either. Crispy potatoes better than French fries, an indulgent skillet roasted cheese chorizo bread, and Cesar Salad is all you need. It's a refreshing escape from small plates and trendy hipster spots that seem to be taking over this city.", "author": "Sonia S."}

You can have the second part with crackers and dried fruit, or with stir-fried veggies, next brunch. The 16oz bone-in filet mignon is nice and thick, so it stays more rare by nature, and is truly delicious, tender, juicy. Chefs know what they're doing here. Nice ambiance. 1940s-ish styling, and jazz playing over the speakers. Very relaxing. It's like if a classic diner grew up into an elegant noir restaurant ;) Really enjoyed it.

My wife and I were in San Francisco for our honeymoon and was looking for a decent steakhouse.  Made reservations here after reading some good reviews.  \n\nMy disappointment started shortly after being seated. The hostess was great but our server was horrible. Never introduced himself and just didn't seem interested in \"serving\" us. Oddly enough he was very cordial with people that had come in after us and you could see him interacting with a bunch of the patrons that were seated after us. Took him a while to come back and finally get our drink orders and upon asking for suggestions or recommendations from him, with no help from him, we finally ordered our drinks. Again after waiting for quite a while, he finally returned to take our food orders. Again after asking for recommendations, again with no help from him, we decided to order the bone in rib eye which seemed to be the most popular dish being ordered. \n\nOur food came and quite honestly there was nothing special about it. I have had much better steaks at franchise places like Chili's or Applebee's.  Again we waited for our server to come back as I was interested in some dessert and overheard a little conversation he had with a couple a few tables away from us. Again with no luck in getting any suggestions or recommendations,  I decided to just pay the bill and leave. \n\nNotice I referred to the server as \"he\" or \"him\"? Simply because he never introduced himself at any point of the night. Upon paying the bill he had made small talk and only after finding out we were visiting from Las Vegas, he grew interested as his mother lived there also. Needless to say, at this point I was uninterested and my wife and I left. I gotta say this, it was the 1st time for me in San Francisco and I absolutely loved every bit of it with exception to this place. I'll definitely be back to San Francisco just not back here.", "author": "Keven L."}

Though our waiter offered to get us new sides, it was way too late, the whole dinner and experience was already  ruined.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-15", "description": "I really do have a mixed review of this place, as so many entities of my experience were fantastic..but there were also some very disappointing parts, as well (for the quality and price that this place has put themselves into)\n\nTo start: we were sat promptly, and had a very very nice waiter who explained everything on the menu to us, and was  bending over backwards to keep us as happy as could be. Service: 11/10! Fantastic!!!\n\nAs we started to get our food, our experience started to take a bit of a nose dive, as we ordered the Calamari and two martinis. The Calamari was very battered and didn't have much, if any taste. Very disappointing. The martinis came in smaller wine glasses.. Which was a little awkward. Usually I'd just roll with it, but with the prices Osso is charging, I'd expect excellence and perfection on all fronts. If Bobo's can do it, so can Osso! They are almost there! \n\nLastly, the steaks. I ordered the large bone in, and my girlfriend ordered the petit bone in. Mine was very good, but again, not excellent. Hers was medium rare, and was supposed to be medium well.. With a lot of grissle/fat running through the meat (also, all they did to make the fillet a petit, was cut the big one in half! Big NO NO! If you can't find a petit with the same thickness, please just take it OFF the menu!). We notified the server and he said that he'd make it right and was so so very sorry for the mishap. Where the large disappointment came, was when he brought it back.. It was the same steak.. And had just been put back on the skillet. Yes, this would suffice if the steak was simply undercooked. No problem with that. My problem is with why they brought the same steak back out when we told then it was full of grissle and fat.. \n\nIf your specialty is steaks, then please double and triple check the quality!!! Especially if you're charging $50!! We left with a $216 bill, with tip, and were not extravagant what so ever.\n\nThe overall experience was great. Excellent service, dessert and ambiance! They are just lacking with a little quality control for steaks, and could do a heck of a lot better with the Calamari. Do note that Osso has only been open for about a year, so kinks I'm sure are still being ironed out.", "author": "Mike P."}

To start off with, the service was good. The employees make you feel like celebrities and treat you like a star, especially when there are only 4 other guests. The staff is not overbearing and checking on you ever 10 minutes, but they get you what you need. However, I have been to my fair share of steakhouses to know a good steak from a bad one. In the case of a properly cooked steak, less is usually more. A nicely seasoned steak does not need any additional sauces. In the case of the filet mignon, it was drenched in a somewhat soy-saucey substance that was overpowering and took away from the meatiness. It would have been fine if this was there style of cooking, however I think that the price of the steak is not a reflection of the quality. There were alot of great competiton steakhouses in the area that would have been better cooked for less.", "author": "Sabryna L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-07", "description": "Boogie Nights. That's the movie I was thinking of when Jamie W. and I came here last Friday. It was a step back to the 70's the moment I saw the Art Deco sign and etched-glass booth dividers (photo: http://bit.ly/17gofgF). If some indie filmmaker wanted to create a period piece about the Watergate years, this looks like the right location to lens a clandestine conversation between Nixon's henchmen. Otherwise this is a somewhat hidden steakhouse in the Gramercy Towers condo complex (built in 1974, of course) opposite Grace Cathedral on moneyed Nob Hill. You have to walk through the main floor hallway to enter the premises. Once there, I kept looking for the disco ball flickering in the bar but to no avail (photo: http://bit.ly/1afBv6n). We were early enough to score a step-up booth.\n\nAfter a particularly strenuous week at work, I wanted a steak, a good one. I never felt I needed a bone-in filet mignon, but that night, I did. But first, the particularly old-school waiter convinced us - with little resistance - to get the $4.95 Skillet-Roasted Chorizo Cheese Bread as a starter. It was really just a wedge of sourdough sitting in a pool of Velveeta-looking melted cheese (photo: http://bit.ly/14AHnmd). Not that we were complaining, but I was expecting a presentation more than something my mom would have done for one of her mah jong parties. From there came the real appetizers. First were the $5.95 Fried Olives, which were easy mouth-poppers though awfully Lilliputian in size (photo: http://bit.ly/1cSRSXu). So were the $11.95 Calamari which were all rings and no tentacles (photo: http://bit.ly/1aVtWor). But devour all of it we did.\n\nThen the best part, the $43.95 Big Bone-In (Osso) Filet Mignon done medium-rare (photo: http://bit.ly/1dQG6QD). Pricey yes. Tasty yes. Meltably so with a pronounced crust infused with rosemary and garlic. The closer the meat was to the bone, the more tender it got. Ah, I see now that was the steak I was supposed to get at Bobo's, but it looked so lonely by itself on the huge dinner plate. A baked potato was in order with all the trimmings, and of course, what could be more 70's than an $8.95 Twice-Baked Potato with Zucchini, Chives, Bacon & Cheese in its own little warmer (photo: http://bit.ly/1cSSc8D)? Now Jamie got all conservative and ordered off the bar menu, the $16.95 Alfonso Scunatelli's Famous Fishwich, quite a huge creation with a big buttermilk-battered cod filet topped with a heavy cole slaw and housed in a torpedo roll that had to be divided three ways (photo: http://bit.ly/13sYWaz)\n\nAlongside his sandwich, he received a plate of Shoestring Zucchini Fries which barely tasted like anything from the garden (photo: http://bit.ly/19utrxx). We downed all of this food with $9.95 shaken-not-stirred cocktails that would been served by waitresses wearing low-cut orange evening gowns and Farrah-feathered blonde highlights. Jamie had the Ossogoodhattan with bourbon, sweet vermouth and fernet branca, while I went for the Ginger Martini with yazi vodka, canton ginger and cranberry (photo: http://bit.ly/1epUWvX). Each came with their own shakers, and I only wish they could make Cappuccino Martinis (photo: http://bit.ly/169kEl0). Last but not least - actually it was probably the least - was the dessert we shared, the $8.95 Hot Pineapple Rum Cake with a small scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream (photo: http://bit.ly/1aVtiHh). Good as it was, it was a bit anticlimactic for our taste. Now it's time for my number...Last dance, last chance...for lo-o-ove...\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...the star of the evening was the bone-in filet mignon, all else was good but definitely overshadowed\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...do the hustle, do the hustle...\nSERVICE - 4 stars...old school attentive\nTOTAL - 4 stars...nostalgic for Watergate, disco, and an old-fashioned steakhouse?...well, here you are", "author": "Ed U."}

So lucky us we got a booth on Valentines Day. \n  My party was a munch of carnivores so we went for the steak. We orders bone in rib eye and bone in fillet. Both steaks were at about 15 oz. They were amazing perfectly cooked medium. They both came Osso style which is their signature sauce. The sauce is just right it doesn't take over the taste of the steak.

We thought it was interesting that the receptionist insisted that we were the first to arrive so we waited outside when most of our party were already seated and waiting for us inside.\n\nThe appetizers were all great (with lots of butter), we had mussels, shrimps and the famous chorizo bread. The house bread was one of the best, so addictive, hard not to overload. The cocktails were great, wine was delicious and service was very attentive.\n\nHalf of the party ordered the bone-in fillet medium rare (16 oz), all were extremely impressed with the tenderness and flavor of the meat. The other half of the party had a porter house and several NY's (14 oz); again all asked for medium rare. One NY was cooked perfectly, the porter house and one of the NY's were unfortunately over cooked. My husband, a big NY steak fan was disappointed at his medium to medium well steak, ate half of my fillet.... We read about the smaller portions of their sides so each ordered one, they were indeed not as generous as some other places, tastes were ok/good. Coffee was very nice, served piping hot in a pot good for at least 2 cups, we also received complimentary chocolate mouse with whipped cream for the birthday people, a nice gesture.\n\nFor a high-end steak house, it's a little bit hit and miss.

The wait staff are all decked out in tuxes, another nice touch.\n\nWe both ordered the bone-in filet mignon which was cooked perfectly: crispy on the outside, medium rare inside.  For sides we shared the twice cooked potato and the cream corn, which was deliciously seasoned.  Standard salads were ordered to start, spinach and Caesar, which were fair.  The cr\u00e8me brule cheese cake for desert had an interesting and light texture to it, and definitely worth a taste.\n\nValet parking is free with validation.\n\nNow for the markdowns: 1) I felt like I was constantly being watched and/or monitored, which was kind of annoying, and plates were cleared as soon as my fork was laid down (OK w/that); 2) an offer to decant a corkeraged bottle of Pinot Noir would be preferable than to immediately pour for tasting, before cocktails were delivered; 3) if you're going to wipe down the bowl edges after plating, use a clean cloth - both of us noticed visible smears surrounding the salad plates from the reflection overhead; and 4) if the need to counsel or discipline a subordinate arises, take care of this off the main floor, and out of the earshot of your guests.\n\nI would think any steakhouse of this caliber would know these basic forms of fine dining etiquette.", "author": "Ron F."}

There are times when we all convene in the area and go out to a nice dinner. Knowing the tendency of some of them for choosing carne, we decided to give Osso a try. The art deco in the off the street cove of Gramercy Towers is interesting. Not sure most would know there's a resto here if they were just walking by the area. The rear patio has a great view of the southern part of the city due to it's NobHill locale. We were greeted and seated by two very friendly hostesses and got one of the booths up by the kitchen where we could watch the service. \n\nAfter hitting a round of cocktails we perused the wine menu for meal time drinking. Turns out they have a concise but fairly good list that actually has in some cases very little markup. A bottle of 2009 Dominus Estate was only $20-$30 more than retail when generally high end restaurants will do 2-3.5x markup depending on where you go. If you can afford it the 2006 Chateau Petrus Pomerol is $2800 which is probably almost double what it runs on the retail market. If you're getting this, let me know and Ill help you out with it :)\n\nAfter alcohol decisions were made we shared for apps and sides:\n\n-Chorizo bread\n-Cavollo fritto - \n-Brussel Sprouts\n-Cauliflower\n\nThe table was split between NY Strips and Filet Mignons, which were all cooked to their medium rare temperatures. Im not quite sure what their default sauce is but it was tasty. The staff took good care of us and the pacing was fairly even for not being open too long. If you're in the area, Osso is definitely worth a try if you like classic drinks and steakhouse ambiance in a classic art deco setting.", "author": "Kim N."}

So we're sitting there reviewing the menu and getting excited for the opportunity to enjoy the decor, eat some great food, and maybe sip a cocktail.\n\nI went over to the bar with my friend to order a drink while we waited.  The bartender was chatting it up with other people and making drinks, so we patiently waited behind a seated couple in front of us - they were sharing a bottle of wine.  We attempted to flag down the bartender, he clearly saw us standing there for a solid 5-8 minutes.  He kept on talking to other people, and at one point, he wasn't even making drinks anymore.  The lady in front of us kindly asked us if we wanted her to get the attention of the bartender - we accepted, thanked her and waited for the bartender to take our drink order:\n\nLady: Hey, I think these guys would like to order a drink\nBartender: Are they with you?\nLady: No...but...\nMy friend: We're just trying to order some drinks, she was kind enough to get your attention...?\nBartender: Get in line, buddy - I've got a lot of other people to serve\n\nWe were baffled.  We thanked the lady for trying to flag down the bartender for us.  We went back to the waiting area and decided that we didn't want to spend our money here, indirectly supporting a bartender that gave us some genuine snobby attitude.  Guess what, guy, you serve drinks to people.  Your job is to pour alcohol to people at this expensive steakhouse.  Now, if my friend and I were acting belligerent or rude, then yea, bad service is to be expected.  But we were patiently waiting just like everyone else.  The lady in front of us kindly flagged you down for attention.  Were we dressed to casual for you?  Oh, I'm sorry, I guess our money isn't the same?  We were going to spend some serious money at Osso, but you just had to go and ruin our dinner.  Thanks, you jerk.\n\nA note to management: I'd love to come back and enjoy some steak at Osso.

He has short silver hair, you probably know the one - Saturday, January 23, 2016, 9pm.  Have a chat with him.\n\nA note to the bartender: Stop chatting so much, maybe that'll clear your ego a bit.  You know why people love talking to you in the first place?  You serve them liquid inebriation.  Know your role.\n\nAnd finally, I usually don't even write Yelp reviews, this is my first.

Finally popped up outta nowhere, didn't even apologize for not being around. Took our dinner order and than we didn't see him for about another 40mins. We ordered two crab (which he said he would bring out first before our steak since bone in takes 35-40 mins), bone in ribeye, filet minon, mac n cheese. Crab finally came, it was over cooked, Filet minon was horrible tasted like a hamburger and wasn't even medium it was over cooked. My fianc\u00e9 said the bone in rib eye was good, the mac and cheese was disgusting. He came over and asked if everything was okay, I told him the filet minim gross and tasted like a hamburger, he said he could take off the crab cakes since the filet minon wasn't good. Even though we were paying almost $300.00 we honestly didn't want to pay for any of it except the bone in rib eye. This is suppose to be a 5 star restaurant. It's over priced for mediocre food.

My girlfriend and I both ordered our own steaks. We came to realize later we could've shared just the one. The steaks are huge, cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. We both ended up finishing our steaks because they taste so good. I would recommend eating steak cooked well, but everyone has their own preference. The steak was very easy to chew and juicy full of flavor. And of course the red wine complimented that. After the meal I ended it with a nice shot of cognac and a shot of espresso.

Very solid and enjoyable starter but not earth shattering.  My issue was the shell in the mussels and that they forgot to give us utensils to eat the crab.\n\nAs a main course I had the bigger bone-in fillet, I believe 32 ounces.  First, I was surprised the waiter had to check if it was in stock.  Given that my friend I was eating with had it the last time there and we were both ordering it, it's not like it is a rarity.  They did have it and it was a beautiful piece of meat.  Unfortunately what I ordered as rare plus was closer to medium, especially on the outside.

The food was good but the service was extremely poor. We did, however, like the free valet service. Four of us did the Prix Fixe for $65 and it came with Caesar Salad, Skillet Chorizo Bread, choice of Shrimp or Mussels, 8 oz Petit Filet and Dessert. I ordered the Half Crab and Sea Bass. We also shared Crab Cakes and Italian Pot Stickers as appetizers. All the food was delicious and prepared very well. Both the Shrimp and Mussels were quite savory and flavorful. The Petit Filet was cooked perfectly to order and the medium rare had the right amount of searing and the redness was the same throughout. It tasted great and was extremely tender and juicy. The server kept bringing up the Pot Stickers so we decided to go for them. They weren't to die for but were satisfying. I loved both the Crab and Sea Bass which werw surprisingly good for a steak restaurant. The portions were good so I had other people's plates to pick off of. The Mac and Cheese was very boring, lacking cheese and much flavor except for a little bit of chorizo spice. As for the service, first, the server brought drinks to the wrong person and then as he brought appetizer plates to us, he chipped off food stuck on them before placing them down. Four people should have received their Shrimp and Mussel appetizers but two Shrimp came out on our side of the table and then after they were half way done, we had to ask the server about the other Shrimp and Mussel Skillet. Then we had to ask for the bread because it didn't come like it had at other tables around us. Two people shared a bottle of wine after apertifs but the server never came to refill the wine glasses. He was definitely unattentive. The food runners were people who worked the kitchen and they were auctionong off the food by asking who's plate it was and literally throwing the plates down and running.

I'll start off by saying that the ambiance in here is good--though it's a little outdated, it's very classic. Soft music in the background, attentive waiters, quiet enough to have a conversation without shouting. It would have been great for date night, if the food didn't put us two in so much literal pain...\n\nBoth of us ordered the bone-in filet mignon, which we were told was their specialty. When it came out, it looked amazing--this huuuuuuge slab of meat sitting in a small pool of its own buttery juices. Crispy and beautifully browned on the outside, and the first couple of bites were spot-on. One thing I did notice was that even though we asked for medium-rare, the coloring wasn't even. Meaning that even though the outside was well-cooked, the inside was RARE. Translucent, bloody, and definitely very, very raw. What this means is that the steaks weren't taken out and sitting at room temperature before they were cooked, so heat is difficult to evenly distribute into the center of the meat. We excused it as us just being picky eaters (it's really difficult to get that nice, even, pinkness to a medium-rare steak) and continued on. BAD IDEA...\n\nAnyways, add an improperly and very uncooked steak to some really intense red wine, and you will get a nasty situation in about 10 minutes. I spent the latter half of my meal wincing, sweating, and holding onto my stomach for dear life, frantically willing myself not to appear too obviously discomforted (I mean... you don't want to look nauseous in a $$$$ restaurant, even if it's just for the sake of other diners).\n\nI WILL say that the sides were good. We ordered creamed spinach, creamed corn, and the twice-baked potato, all of which tasted heavenly. They comped my glass of wine, because I had originally thought that it was a wine issue,  until my boyfriend later complained of the same stomach pain.\n\nI'm not going to go into all of the vulgar details about the aftermath of dinner... but we ran home FAST after paying the bill, and thanked the heavens about a million times that we only lived 2 blocks away.\n\ntl;dr; medium rare steak came out completely RAW and gave our stomachs the rollercoaster ride of a lifetime.", "author": "Chrystal Z."}

The service was fantastic, crab cakes were phenomenal and the steak....well, it speaks for itself. Take Bobo's steak selection and add 5 or 6 additional cuts to choose from. I crushed the New York New York which is their 32 oz. bone in strip. I know it probably not something to brag about, but it was soooooo damn good, I could have eaten the bone. \n\nThe reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the side dishes were not very appealing. Steak goes with potatoes, am I wrong? They only off a half baked, which was so-so. Good flavor, but tiny. Everything else aside from the asparagus didn't seem too appealing. Hopefully they will get back to the basics when it comes to the sides.  I'm sure Osso Steakhouse  will be 5 stars soon.", "author": "Chris P."}

And, we eat out often and enjoy a great dining experience.\n\nIf I could give less than 1 star rating I would, but I don't believe that is option here on Yelp.\nThis is the first time I posted anything negative on Yelp.  I have told 6 people today about our experience last night at Osso's and no doubt will tell many more.  My friends asked me why I wasn't posting on Yelp as this would be helpful information to know...and due to their prodding, here is our experience:\n\nWe had 6 p.m. reservations and we chose Osso's because it was the closest restaurant to the Masonic Auditorium and it was favorably reviewed and Zagat rated.\nThe service was horrible.  Our waiter, Michael, was exceptionally unpleasant.  The assistant server, Joanna, was great and should be commended for doing a good job in an unpleasant situation.\n\nWe informed all parties that we were going to the show next door (Josh Groban at Masonic) and we were told we had plenty of time.  We were seated immediately (in the back room) at 6 p.m. and we ordered a bottle of wine.  Our server brought the bottle of wine around 6:20 and that experience went like this.... He poured the tasting of wine for me to try.... I barely smelled the wine in my glass and before I tasted it he said \"its fine?\"...and just started pouring the other wines.  He gave NO attention, NO eye contact the entire evening.  He never came back to fill our glasses.  There was a total lack of presence with us from the very beginning to the end.\n\nOur food order wasn't taken until 6:45 p.m.   And, that was only because we flagged down the help and asked for it to be taken.\n\nAt 7:15, we inquired with the assistant server, \"Where is our food?  She quickly informed Michael that we were inquiring, he peaked around the corner to see who was asking...and he said \"oh, it's coming\" and went away.\n\nThe food was delivered by other folks and we were never asked, \"is the food okay...\".  The first course was initially being delivered to the wrong table, but I flagged the person and told her it was for our table.  I had a Caesar salad and was never offered crushed black pepper nor was there any condiments/pepper or salt on our table.  My friend had the scallop appetizers served on a dirty plate, which he pointed out to the assistant server as she was taking away the plates (he indicated to her that it wasn't her problem but that he was surprised to have a dirty plate).\n\nMy friend, called Michael over, and told him, this is the worst service we have ever seen.  He \"huffed/puffed\" and walked away.  Said nothing, not even, I am sorry for the bad service...absolutely nothing.\n\nNeedless to say, there was no time for dessert and we had to also ask for the bill so that we wouldn't be late for the show.\n\nWhen we left, I was just wanted to get out and not be late for the concert...it was already 7:50 p.m.  However, my spouse and friend, wanted to share with the manager our experience.  The manager said, he was sorry, and my friend said, by your body language you don't seem too interested in what we have to say.  The manager said, \"have a good evening\" and walked away. We looked to the manager for a turnaround story, and unfortunately, he only cemented our poor service experience.\n\nDuring the intermission at the concert, I walked up to two gentlemen (that were at another table in the restaurant back room) and they agreed with our judgment and said \"they won't be going back.\"\n\nWow.  All, I can say is \"wow\".", "author": "Bras U."}

I do not usually write a review, but since I selected this restaurant based on Yelp, I felt compelled to write one. I selected this restaurant for my girlfriends birthday. We celebrated it at Harris' Steakhouse last year and wanted to try a new place. \n\nLet me start with the pros: Excellent waiter and the staff was great. Atmosphere was great, typical steakhouse environment. Side dishes and fresh \"warm\" bread was amazing. \n\nNow the cons: For the price of $200 without tip, the steaks were very disappointing. She ordered the bone in filet mignon and I ordered the bone in New York steak. Both were very small and not thick at all. I understand neither of us picked the Super Cut steaks, but I have had thicker cut steaks at Chili's. That was very disappointing. Her Filet was very nice, but my New York was very tough. I have been to enough steakhouses to know a good steak should not require me to saw through the steak, the knife should slide through the steak. As I said before, I have been to enough steakhouses (Gallagher's(NYC), Harris (SF), Sundance(Palo Alto) to know we did not get our money's worth. Lastly, which was a deal breaker, there were actually fruit flies at our table. If they are in the restaurant area, that is not a good sign. \n\nSorry, I would not recommend nor go to Osso's again.", "author": "Dan K."}

There were many disgruntled customers in the same situations we were - having made reservations well in advance.  No one offered apologies.  They could have cared less about their \"captive audience on Christmas\".   After finally being seated, we ordered a bottle of wine and found out that we would have to pay for bread...ridiculous. Our server was not full of Christmas spirit, especially after my wife and I ordered appetizers (our son had a fillet). His steak had to be redone because it was overcooked.

We were tucked away in a corner in a back room, practically left alone to enjoy the funky Art Deco decor. We especially enjoyed the abstract images of early 20th century train stations on the walls around us. The experience definitely started off well. \n\nOur server was on point for the most part (having to ask to have our waters filled was the only misstep), almost always there when needed, but never over-bearing. I wouldn't say the vibe was \"warm\", but we were perfectly happy to be mainly left to ourselves.\n\nThe breakdown of our meal:\n\nVodka Martini: spot on and they delivered on my request for extra olives. \n\nRutherford Ranch Cabernet: solid, nothing to write home about.\n\nMocktail with mint and vanilla soda: sweet, but good.\n\nCaesar salad: Good, but miniscule. I had anchovies put on mine, which added some heft.\n\n8 oz. bone-in Filet Mignon: delicious, with a slight crunch on the outside and perfectly pink on the inside as the medium rare preparation was advertised. \n\n10 oz Filet Mignon (no bone): Wife had to order this well done (preggers prep) and she felt the outside was a bit charred. I tried it and liked it, though we both agreed the bone-in version was better.\n\nSides: Mac n' cheese and creamed spinach. These were the biggest disappointment of the evening. I would take off an additional half star if I could to reflect this. At a place like this, I feel the sides should be outstanding. We were so psyched to eat some creamy, delicious Mac n' cheese and frankly it tasted like undercooked Safeway pasta with a hint of refried chorizo juice. I like the thought (who doesn't love both of these comfort foods), but the mix ended up tasting like a slightly spicy sock. As for the creamed spinach, it was flavorless, watery, bleah. \n \nDessert: Keylime Cheesecake. Again, this particular flavor combo didn't really do it for either of us. \n\nDouble-espresso: kept me up for midnight mass, so well done there.\n\nFinal call: probably wouldn't go back. The restaurant itself is stunning in its self-conscious Art Deco way, but the whole experience falls short of the 2-hundo for two price tag.", "author": "Matthew Z."}

And let me begin by saying that we were all very impressed.  I know I'm going to get some flack for not ordering steak at a steak house, and ordered salmon instead (just to try it out). My friends ordered the different steaks offered ranging from the petite filet to the bone in. All the meats were cooked to perfection.  The petites are really small so be warned, and I guess the name should be enough warning.\n\nThe salmon dish, I wasn't so impressed with. The two tiny pieces I got didn't seem fresh and almost seemed like they were frozen Costco packaged salmon.  Also, the sauce that uses was a buttery/oily mess which turned a healthy option into something not so healthy.  That'd be my only complaint.\n\nAppetizers were good and everyone seemed to have enjoyed the cheese bread dish.  Calamari is calamari, just like any other place.\n\nService was good to begin with, with the wait staff being patient with our large party. Towards the end, it seemed like we were being rushed out because they began clearing our table when people are still eating.  We had extra bread leftover and the waiters just took it and dumped it, and didn't even bother asking if we wanted to take it home.  I'd understand that sort of action if the bread were free table bread, but we actually had to pay for that.\n\nAll in all, I can't throw that much shade at osso other than what I mentioned above. It was a great experience, good food, and my friends enjoyed it.", "author": "Bing W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-17", "description": "Tried Osso last night for the first time. Osso good but not perfection. \nThe thing I love the most about the restaurant is the acoustic tiling they have on the ceiling. This might be the only restaurant I've ever been in that has pure acoustic tiling on the ceiling. This does wonders for the noise. I'm hearing impaired and wear hearing aids and usually restaurants are torture. The acoustic tiling at Osso really made this problem negligible and I enjoyed that immensely. While on the topic of decor, I liked the layout of the restaurant. We had a cozy little table next to the kitchen and I liked how the kitchen is in the middle and you can see the chefs cooking. The kitchen is also sealed off by glass so that you don't smell like a BBQ. \nOn to the food. I had the famous bone in 18 ounce filet. I ordered it medium and it was definitely med. rare because the middle was red but I'm not too picky so I just enjoyed it as it was and it was an excellent steak. Absolutely no complaints whatsoever about the steak. The light sauce they put on it complements it perfectly and no other sauces are needed (or offered from what I could see). \nWe also had the mac and cheese and roasted vegetables. The mac was quite dull and boring. The roasted vegetables were good, however they were covered (caked) with seasoning of some kind that was good and thankfully not too salty, however I think they would benefit from a reduction of this seasoning. We also had the beet salad which was quite nice. Not mind blowing but good.\nService was ok but they seemed to be too busy and it was sometimes difficult to get our server's attention. At one point she seemed to run off before my wife could take 10 seconds to decide on a cocktail which we both thought was a little rude.\nAll in all Osso is about what you'd expect for a chain restaurant steak house. Ruth's Chris is also a chain and in my opinion is classier and better than Osso, but steak lovers should not be disappointed with Osso. If you are going to a show next door at the Masonic this is the perfect place to have a nice dinner before the show.", "author": "Matt H."}

He made reservations and we were seated late plus after we were seated it took 30 mins for our waitress to assist us. \nAs I was asking questions about the menu our waitress took a deep sigh and said she would be back when I was ready...RUDE! I hated the service!!! We go out to be serviced, otherwise we wouldn't go out! \nWe ended up ordering an hour later because our waitress kept passing us. By this point we were both starving! Also we ordered a mint mojito and she brought back a Moscow mule, when I mentioned this to her she took it and the bartender just added mint to it, without muddling it. I know this sounds like I'm nagging but if we are going to pay $200 for food and drinks we except quality service! The food is good, thank god! The food is what saves them. I would like to go back for the food, but I advice you to just sit in the bar or ask for a gift card for Christmas or your bday bc the service sucks and you shouldn't have to pay for crappy service like that.", "author": "Angelique C."}

It's my favorite part about the place: stylish and somewhat art-deco.  The dining booths are intimate, but I don't necessarily like the green lights.  One gets used to them though.\n\nOne can tell that these guys are really trying to create a classy and affordable spot, and as a fellow Nob Hill neighbor - I'm rooting for them.  I love seeing new places in my hood.\n\nBut to be taken seriously in a city like San Francisco, this place needs to focus on offering AMAZING food - not just okay food.\n \nHere's what I recommend: \n1. Juicier steaks (The bone-in filet mignon is more flavorful than the regular filet mignon. What?!)\n2. Offer mashed potatoes as a side (Let's try to be a little less fancy here.)\n3. Simplify dessert options.  (Maybe something that resembles chocolate cake or ice cream?  The carribean rum cake is a little over-kill)\n\nAnyway, I'll be back and I'll bring more friends next week.

Hopefully just due to the Valentine's day rush.\n\nService: \n2 stars. Our server appeared very flustered, and it being a busy night, I gave him some slack, but both our table and the table next to us were waiting a long time between visits from him. The busboy in white (Hispanic gentleman with a shaved head) on the other hand was an absolute delight, and I'm pretty sure we saw him more than our server. If he had been our server, I would have given service higher marks.\n\nAmbiance: \nDidn't take enough time to look through others' photos here on Yelp, and was expecting a much more dimly lit and romantic atmosphere, but instead it was pretty bright. Threw the mood off a bit.\n\nDrinks: \nMy SO ordered a Moscow Mule (or similar, not sure what it was called on the menu, as she walked over without me) while we waited for our table to become available, but we're pretty sure she got some kind of non-alcoholic drink instead. No hint of booze or ginger to be found. Almost cloyingly sweet. Later had a bottle of Faust Cabernet 2012 with our food, which was tasty. \n\nFood:\n- Caesar salad - Manchego cheese as opposed to the more traditional Parmesan was a unique touch and was tasty, croutons were decent, fresh lettuce, but otherwise the salad still felt somehow under-seasoned overall. 2 stars.\n- Crab cake appetizer - Amazing. Crunchy exterior, tall \"hockey puck\" shaped cakes, full of delicious crab meat. Perfectly seasoned. ***5 STARS***. If you don't want to order anything else besides your mains, at least give these a try.\n- Chorizo cheese bread - Letdown. After all the rave reviews, we knew we had to try it. The bread was good, but the chorizo cheese sauce was very greasy and nothing special - no big hits of chorizo, that we could taste at least. 2 stars.\n- Petite filet - Simply seasoned, cooked to perfection. The weight of the knife alone was enough to cut through my thick medium rare steak. ***5 STARS***.\n- Roasted vegetables. Tasty. Almost unbelievably crispy potatoes, well seasoned roasted cauliflower, carrots, broccoli, olives, and Brussels sprouts. 4 stars.\n\nNext time, we'd definitely get the crab cakes and steaks again, and maybe repeat the roasted vegetables or try a different side. We weren't crazy about the caesar salad or cheese bread though, sadly.", "author": "Eric F."}

I love the little courtyard outside the restaurant.  Leather chairs, rich mahogany, very enjoyable ambiance.  There were leather booths but also these swivel leather armchairs (i loved them!)\n\nMy bf ordered the large filet and said it was one of the best cuts he's ever had and he's eaten at Peter Luger's.  and I devoured the whole 2lb crab.  It got messy but I had a bib and about 10 napkins =P it was delicious. we ate up everything.\n\nWe also started with crab smoked salmon avoc crostini and yellowtail carpaccio.  Definitely get the carpaccio. Super thin and the soy sauce mixture was well done.  Crab avocado was decent, but given that I ended up going with the crab entree, was probably redundant.\n\nDrinks solid - a little disappointed the pappy 23 year was out of stock, but decent manhattans and pinots for our food.  Finished with an oban 14 with the BF. \n\nOur server was the worst part of the experience. We were there for our anniversary and had a relatively late reservation - 8:30 (seated around 8:40 because we got drinks at the bar).  Upon first seeing the server, we hadn't even looked at the menu yet so we asked for 5 minutes and told him we were not in a rush.  Our server goes \"just so you know, we're really full tonight, so you want to get your orders in\".  It wasn't clear to us if he was saying he wanted us to rush so he could seat someone after us, or that we would have to wait a while to get our food. But we JUST told him we weren't in a rush, so the latter wouldn't matter.  Either way, super awkward comment and it was a bit of a downer on the experience.  And the restaurant started emptying around 9:30 and was totally empty by the time we left.  Really perplexed why our waiter made that comment. It did not take long for our food to come out at all.", "author": "Alice Z."}

Reservations were running late so we happened to sit at the bar and sip on a cold drink while we waited. While at the bar we had prompt service from the older bartender, he poured the drink stiff and it was very enjoyable. Finally we get seated, younger Asian gentleman takes a bit longer then average to get to us and wasn't overly friendly (it's Valentine's Day, it's busy, I get it), get rid of the PDA ordering system, it's obvious it doesn't work. He had to fumble with it in his hands for five minutes before he could even take our order, then when the chefs would bring the food out, they didn't know where it was going . We order the Kettle bread for a starter and it was delicious and our food came out the bone-in filet was phenomenal, the potatoes were filling and delicious. The waiter wasn't around much, maybe twice during our hour and forty five minute visit. But the bus boy who was an older bald gentleman with a Russian accent was fantastic, I've never had such wonderful service from a restaurant. He took charge of everything in our area of the dining room and did a fantastic job at it, and still found time to be friendly. Took my girlfriends drink order since our waiter was absent. I was blown away. Someone get this man a raise. He also wrapped my filet like a swan with foil! The Cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e cheesecake was also another hit, wish I could eat it every night.

From the outside, it's unassuming, almost hidden, as it's located in some condo complex.  Tip:  You can't park in the lot in front but, they have complimentary valet parking on the curb.  Free valet parking in the city...say what?!?  Just be sure to tip generously.\n\nWe started with the Iron Skillet Roasted Chorizo Cheese Bread.  Like whoa, if you love cheese and chorizo, you will love this!  We literally wiped the skillet clean; it was that good!  We also started with the Iron Skillet Mussels and Shrimp combo.  The s/o ate the Mussels and I ate the shrimp, which were peel and eat.  It got messy but it was good...although we both agreed Bobo's version tasted better.\n\nFor our entrees, we both got the Filet Mignon and Half Crab, and our sides of Mac & Cheese and Mushrooms.  The Filet was spot on, cooked perfectly.  The half crab was good, but definitely not as flavorful as you'd get at Crustacean or Thanh Long.  Sides were decent, we'd probably skip the Mac & Cheese next time since it was the same base as the Chorizo Cheese Bread dip, and I'd rather order the latter.\n\nWe skipped dessert as we were planning to go elsewhere but I did end my meal with an Americano, which was decent.\n\nOur server and the runner who served us throughout the evening were top notch, made sure everything was to our satisfaction, kept our glasses full, tables clean, all without being too intrusive.  I forgot our server's name, but she was the lady with the glasses...super duper service, we tipped her 30% of our bill.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend Osso's as it's classic, not trendy i.e. loud, new wave food, patrons who act like a million bucks but live on credit; you know what I mean.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-11-27", "description": "My wife's uncle recently passed away, necessitating that Kari and I, with her mother, fly up for a two day visit to San Francisco from Orange County, where we met up with her brother, Mark, from Seattle. \n\nWith Mr. Qvale's funeral at Grace Cathedral, and the reception at the Pacific Union Club, we naturally booked a room at the Fairmont Hotel, all within walking distance of each other. We thus learned of the Osso Steakhouse from the concierge who not only raved about it's fare, but noted that it too was located right around the corner from the Fairmont. \n\nThough we've been fortunate to dine at many of the world's finest restaurants, Kari and I do not frequently order steak. However, Osso's close proximity to the Fairmont, combined with the enthusiastic recommendation, made it the ideal choice for our emotional day and tired legs.\n\nActually, we had planned to dine at the Fairmont in the Tonga Room, where Kari's father had proposed to her mother, Hope, some 64 years prior. Kari's mother also worked at the Fairmont following the war. Understandably, it held fond memories for her. Unfortunately, the room was booked solid with a large party. Though we were disappointed, we were to soon discover it was a blessing in disguise.  \n\nOsso Steakhouse is located across the street from Grace Cathedral, in the swank Knob Hill neighborhood. It's decor is definitively art-deco, sophisticated and elegant. The ambiance, much to our surprise, was warm and inviting. Two hostesses quickly greeted us with genuine, friendly faces - we felt welcomed from the start. \n\nNo sooner did we find our place in our spacious, comfortable booth than our waiter greeted us with Voss Sparkling Water. As the light jazz softly soothed our souls, he gave us the lay the land, whetting our appetites for what was to come.\n\nThis was just the beginning of superior service that would delight us throughout our entire evening. Actually, friends and family find me a bit too demanding - I've been chastised more than once for my fastidious nature and \"nit-picky\" expectations. Were I to have one complaint it might be that the service was a tad too swift. I would have preferred that my appetizer/salad had more time to digest before my steak arrived. I told you, I'm critical. Sorry.   \n\nAs to our waiter, we were especially impressed to learn that Osso's steaks were dry-aged (the respected, time-honored, gold standard technique of preparing high-quality beef) and were pan seared in their natural juices, with a \"hint of rosemary and garlic.\" Though I wasn't particularly hungary when I arrived, I became famished after hearing the extraordinary measures Osso went to in preparing their beef. \n\nAs tempting as the Porterhouse Super-size appeared (serving 2-4 @ $114), I ultimately set my sights a tad lower, and settled on \"The Big Bone-in (Osso) Filet Mignon\" ($44.95). Kari's brother, Mark, ordered the same; his was medium rare, mine was medium. Both arrived quickly, sizzling hot, and fragrant beyond words.\n\nI almost forgot to mention our salads, which were light and flavorful. We all agreed we ate much more than we should, that is, if our intention was to fully enjoy our fine steaks. Quickly then, I ordered the Panzanella, which was a delightful mix of tomatoes, onions, croutons and avocado. At just $9.95, I should have ordered an additional plate for the flight home...\n\nAs to my first bite of an Osso steak...ambrosia. It's texture and taste was rich, buttery, and ever so delectable. Mind you, though I love a good steak, I am not a regular steak eater; regardless of eating every bite of my Panzanella salad, I savored every morsel and sopped up every plash of juice on my plate. When I was finished, I looked over my plate and across the table to see how Mark was faring. He too had devoured his filet. Our eyes met, and we smiled in pig-heaven delight.\n\nThis was truly a remarkable evening - an exceptional restaurant. The last time I recall being taken by surprise by a steak was in Las Vegas at CarneVino (mind-boggling delicious).   \n\nAs to dessert, I've got two words of advice regarding the Hot Pineapple Rum Cake: 1. order it; 2. DON'T accept a request to deliver it with spoons for the table. Though everyone was much too full to order a dessert (except me), once my cake arrived, it was gone in seconds. Oh my Lord, it was extraordinary! \n\nIn summary, the next time your visiting San Francisco, and you've got a craving for something from which memories are made, look no further than Osso Steakhouse. It'll be the one of those restaurants you'll be talking about for years to come.\n\nOther great Steakhouses to put on your bucket list:\nCut, Beverly Hills, CA\nKeens, New York City\nRed, South Beach, Miami\nPappas Bros.

After a lot of searching, I think my family and I have found our new steak place.\n\nI can't remember how I originally heard about Osso, but I bought my parents a gift certificate for Christmas, and they were nice enough to include my brother, his girlfriend and I on a night out. My mom made reservations in advance for a Friday night, and we were seated in the back area at a table that was in a tent. I'm not describing this well, but for someone like my dad whose only demands are a good steak, a great martini, and a quite ambiance, he was thrilled. It was almost like having our own room. Even if we hadn't been seated there, the restaurant as a whole was quiet and had an old-school vibe to it.\n\nService was excellent and attentive. I think about 5 different people helped with the serving process, and all of them were professional and great at putting the right plates in front of the right people (it's a minor detail, but my mom noticed and thought it was great). \n\nFor food, the steaks definitely stood out. Most of the salad and side portions were smallish/normal, but the steaks were massive. I didn't mind the portion sizes since I wasn't trying to gain 12 pounds; my mom and I split the bone-in petit filet and saved plenty of room for everything else. I started with the beet salad, which I could eat every day of my life. For sides, we all split the twice baked potato, spinach, brussel sprouts and mac & cheese. All were delicious, but I still can't get over the steak. It was cooked perfectly, the sauce was awesome, and we were all thrilled. Desserts were also great, but I couldn't finish my chocolate cappuccino mousse. The total on the bill was about $400, which for 3 steaks, 5 salads, 5 sides, 5 desserts, a bottle of wine, and a couple other cocktails was not bad.\n\nNothing detracted from our evening at Osso, and I can't wait to go back again. I'm glad we no longer need to go to Marin for a great steak restaurant.", "author": "Eve D."}

Since we only had 2 people, we were sat at the very comfortable lounge chair tables near the kitchen. This was truly a wonderful first impression, since we had walked the majority of the city throughout the day. \n\nAs far as food, the selection was top notch. Being a steakhouse, they feature a vast selection of choice cuts cooked to perfection. On this trip, however, we were in the mood for some seafood, so we ordered a salmon salad and one of the shrimp skillets with 3 side dishes to share. To start with, the shrimp were just perfect. They had a distinct, bold seasoning and were cooked perfectly on the sizzling skillet. Our 3 sides were marinated mushrooms, roasted potatoes, and asparagus. All 3 were very well done. The potatoes especially stood out to me, as they had a great mix of spices that was perfectly balanced.\n\nThe salmon salad ended up being quite good, but it took two tries. The first time, we received sashimi atop the salad. The menu does describe it as such, but we wanted the cooked version. After sending it back and getting the entree salmon atop the salad, all was well with the world. It was well seasoned and the perfect accompaniment to the greens.

We had reservations for 615, arrived and on time and were seated right away.  The bar area looked beautiful with mahogany wood all around. The dining room was old world elegant with cozy booths the same mahogany decorating.  We were seated in one of the booths, which was both cozy and romantic.  Our waiter Khalid, was there right away and he noticed that I had a bit of laryngitis and immediately offered me a cough drop.  I told him no thanks, I had my own, but was very appreciative of the thoughtful gesture.\n    We ordered the appetizer we had been told about which was a skillet, cheesy, chorizo bread.  It was phenomenal!!!  My husband, who is on a low carb diet, could not get enough of the gooey, cheesy bread that was seasoned perfectly!  We had brought our own wine so we had that with our meal.  I ordered the bone in filet and my husband ordered the scallops.  We also got the creamed spinach and brussels sprout chips.  The bone in filet was cooked perfectly medium rare, and seasoned with rosemary and garlic. It was so tender, I could almost cut it with my fork.  Easily one of the best steaks I have ever had!  The scallops were also amazing and so were the spinach and brussels sprouts.  If you are looking for a great steak place, look not further that here.

The meat was certainly flavorful, but on this night much more rare then medium rare. My buddy sent his back to get re-fired, I decided to see if letting it rest further would help... it did a bit, but near the bone on the bigger bone-in filet it was just rare. After some time they finally brought back my buddy's bone in NY strip steak and it was way over done - exactly what I was afraid of and why I didn't send mine back - but then again, his was so much bloodier, he really had to.\n\nThe staff was solid and professional though, and he could have sent it back, but given how slow the restaurant was and how slow the kitchen was seemingly moving, didnt want to inconvenience me by making me wait for his steak. At the price they charge, I wouldn't have minded.\n\nBut what really got me was the sides. When the standard, have you been here before, let me introduce to you to how we work speech, includes the sides are big enough to share and they are barely big enough for one... and they cost $9 each, you expect a bit more. Osso is not up to upscale steak house standards IMHO, should have gone to Bob's or Alfred's. The twice baked potato was so small, I actually said something to the manager about it. $0.40 of groceries max... very disappointed.", "author": "Chris H."}

First of all food quality is only average and I won't complain about it.  Second of all is their service, we had a party of 6 sat down for a table at 7:30, after 10 minutes time, someone came by and opened two bottles of wine for us and just put the bottles down on the table and attempted to walk away.  As he saw me looking at him he must have realized that I was expecting him to pour the wine for us asked us if we want him to do so... I believe it is something a guest is already expected him to do in any fine dining restaurant and the question shouldn't be asked.  After that, another 10 minutes passed by and our waiter still not appeared to take our order until I have to ask one of the servers to find our waiter.  Which means it took us more than 20 minutes after we sat in order to know who our waiter was.

So, often, we're also doing takeouts for sides.  Now, it's time to get real about the patterns of unwanted experiences.  Before we do, let's give a standing ovation for service, which is always, always over the top.  Separate from that---the food inconsistencies---and isn't that why we're choosing Osso?-- can be thoughtless at times.  It's become like a lotto:  I wonder what we're going to get this time?  At this point, we've stopped the recommendations to the locals.  I mention it during my tours, if someone wants delicious beef, and have to add about the inconsistencies.  The two of us love the bone-in ribeye.  At times, it's more grisle than we should ever be paying for.  At other times, it's chopped up, instead of slices for us.  The tastey mixed veggies will be predominantly potaties.  If you can find the four pieces of broccoli, lucky you.  If you love, love tons of unfresh little round onions thrown in , you've hit the jackpot.  Osso's farmed salmon has little flavor.  Of course, you don't go to a steakhouse for fish, even though I have twice.  The mac and cheese rivals velveeta.  The setting is beautiful, calm, like a retreat.  The bread's a specialty and astounding.  When we went recently, we knew to change our sides to whatever single fresh veggie they had; insist on a piece of meat that was dominated by meat, not grisle; and to present sliced as they originally taught us by their example...not chopped.  Osso's will continue to be popuilar because it's made the map for red-eating tourists and business folks from everywhere in the country.  And even it's hefty prices are bargains for beef if you live in Asia.  For the rest of us locals, who dine out and takeout a lot, it's a toss.", "author": "Paula H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-29", "description": "My boyfriend and I were looking for a nice place to celebrate the end of a successful quarter at his work and we decided to try Osso, which was still fairly new and had only been open a couple of months.  It was conveniently located a few blocks from his apartment in Nob Hill, so we were able to walk there in less than 15 minutes.  The decor is warm and inviting and strikes a balance between modern and traditional.  It definitely fits the bill for a place to go to celebrate an achievement, anniversary, or anytime you're looking to class it up.  They even have a small bar near the entrance so you can get a little splash of class without going all the way on a full meal.\n\nThe service at Osso is impeccable.  We were first seated across from each other in these plush leather chairs, which I thought were nice in theory but weren't that comfortable and made it difficult to sit over the table properly.  I asked the waiter if we could move to a different spot and they put us in a massive booth overlooking the rest of the restaurant.  The rest of the service was just as accommodating.  The waiter was knowledgeable and friendly, but not too friendly.  You know how sometimes waiters can go overboard with the conversation and you just want them to leave?  Not here.  They have been well trained in striking the right balance which came off as charming and added to our experience.\n\nService and decor notwithstanding, the food is by far what makes Osso worth the while.  They're known for their bone-in filet mignon, and they do it to perfection.  My boyfriend ordered the regular filet and I ordered the bone-in petit filet, and my boyfriend later said he wished he'd ordered what I had.  I think he referred to it as \"meat candy\" because it practically melts in your mouth.  They are devoted to doing steak their way and staying true to the flavor perfection they deliver.  My boyfriend asked them if they could do a filet \"Oscar\" style, which is topped with crab meat and bernaise sauce, and they told him they couldn't do it because it would mess with the true flavor of the steak.  A little frustrated at first, once the steak hit his mouth he understood and respected that stance.  Any restaurant that refuses to cater to the whims of the customer because they believe in what they're doing so strongly is doing something right!\n\nWhile the steak clearly holds the spotlight, the appetizers are a solid supporting cast that are worth mentioning.  The yellowtail carpaccio was mind-blowing--thin slivers of yellowtail spread out on a plate and drizzled with this soy-based sauce and little bits of red pepper.  The shoestring zucchini fries were done to perfection; not too greasy and satisfyingly crispy.  The brussels sprouts were just okay; we could have done without the capers and we both agreed we'd had better elsewhere.  I guess you can't get everything perfect, but Osso came darn near close.\n\nIf you're a fan of steakhouses and haven't tried Osso yet, put it at the top of your list!  Get the bone-in filet, give a few of the appetizers a try and enjoy the roller coaster for your tastebuds.", "author": "Anna T."}

We ordered the petite filet mignon and the bone-in ribeye. Filet was ok but the ribeye was absolutely terrible.  Considering it was 20oz, I should have sliced different sections to make sure the it was medium rare as ordered. Was extremely disappointed to discover that half of it was cooked perfectly while the other was 80% fat and still bloody! The waitress was nice enough and offered to have the kitchen cook it a bit, but the cut was still so terrible with huge clumps of fat. I really regret not calling the manager over, but I did not want to embarrass my date. I paid $60 for a cut that was worth about $20 at the local grocery store. Will never go here again.  Spent about $300 on 2 drinks, the aforementioned dinner + 2 sides (served in tiny cups the size of my palm), and cheesecake. Absolutely not worth the $$$$$.", "author": "Amanda S."}

I'm truly shocked that more foodies in SF haven't been here or even heard of this place before!\n\nI came here with my coworkers/team for a celebratory dinner, and the nine of us were seated in a semi-private room, which was really nice. We sat down first for drinks near the bar, and they had these wonderfully leather-cushioned chairs on wheels! All the tables seemed to have huge comfortable leather chairs as well.\n\nI have been to many steakhouses in the city, and I must say that Osso has a one-of-a-kind elegant and old-school vintage feel to it that you can't get at any other steakhouse. There is no snooty-ness from the waiters/waitresses and the decor is classy but cozy.\n\nThe service was impeccable - our waiter helped recommend the perfect wine to complement our steaks and appetizers, and gave us the perfect amount of attention throughout the dinner to check on how we were feeling.\n\nFor an appetizer, the mussels were a scrumptious choice and as a carb-lover, I must say that even the bread they served was MMMmmmm good!\n\nMost people in my party ordered the bone-in-filet mignon, which is hard to come by across steakhouses. The bone-in was perfectly aged and cooked to each person's delight!\n\nWhen the bill came at the end of the dinner, everyone was in shock that it wasn't more expensive! We felt like we had gotten such a steal for the amazing dining experience!\n\nI truly look forward to coming back here again, whether it be for a date, family dinner, or work function!", "author": "Connie Y."}

It was Christmas Eve and waiter seemed genuine but once we paid the bill it was all downhill from there.  An email was sent to us to verify our reservation.  We noticed it said that there was no corkage fee.  We therefore, brought wine with us to dinner.  We were confused once we saw on the menu that there was a corkage fee.  We asked the waiter though and he said that it wouldn't be added to the bill.  First, a fraudulent drink was added to our bill.  It was taken off once we pointed it out.  We proceeded to pay the bill with a tip of close to 20 percent.  The waiter later came back with the bill and said THE TIP WAS TOO LOW!!  HE SAID SOMETHING TO THE AFFECT THAT HE TOOK THE CORKAGE FEE OFF.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!  THAT IS SO TACKY AND IT RUINED OUR NIGHT.  ABSOLUTLEY NO WAY SHOULD A SERVER COME BACK AND QUESTION THE TIP EVER, EVER EVER!!  IT WAS EMBARRASING AND HE IS LUCKY WE TIPPED HIM AT ALL AFTER THAT.

He's def one to prefer less fuss on the plate & more flavor.  We had the kettle bread & calamari for apps... simple, tasty, & large enough for us to have invited another couple.  The kettle bread was warm with a nice crust & the calamari was flavorful & crispy (not over cooked either). . What really stood out was the steak tho!  We both ordered the petite bone-in filet mignon.  I ordered mine medium, his medium plus... & they nailed them both.  The steak itself was delicious but the thin gravy like sauce they add over it was very tasty as well.  We split the half crab & tho it was messy to crack into, it was very flavorful also.  We split the chocolate covered bananas for dessert (yummy!!!) & finished the night off with Their coffee drinks.  Our service was great, classy ambiance, & tasty food... Over all, a great date night or couples night out kinda spot for some steak & seafood.  I only wished they'd be willing to crack & plate the crab table side so it wasn't so messy for my manicure.

We invited a couple friends to join us for dinner here on a Friday night to celebrate the end of a crazy work week.   Aren't we glad to have found this place. Both our friends and us have been to many steakhouses ( NYC, LV, SF, LA, ect.), and all 4 of us agreed Osso is rated pretty high on our list compared to others.  The reason why that is, is that it wasn't jut the steaks that were great, other dishes and cocktails we ordered were wonderful as well. The service was excellent. The staff were very professional yet personable and we had fun exchanging conversations with them.  \n\nTo share some reviews on each item we had, I have to start with the bread. \n\nThe bread is amazing.  My husband normally don't eat much bread but when he had one little piece I broke off from the loaf, he wanted more. \n\nOur cocktails came out.  I had the basil martini and it came in a cute little shaker and it was poured into the martini glass at our table. Nice touch on the presentation and the drink was delish.  Our friend's wife had the blood orange mimosa and she said it was okay.  They ended up ordered a basil martini after having a taste of mine.\n\nWe then shared a yellowtail carpaccio as an appetizer.  If Osso still has this on their menu when you come, I would recommend ordering it.  This is our favorite dish of the night.  The fresh yellowtail was sliced thin and marinated in evoo ponzu sprinkled with diced chillies.  It was deliciously tasty and refreshing.\n\nNext we had the iron skillet roasted crab and shrimp. This is one of the best quality crab and shrimps we have tried. Loved the garlic butter that the shrimp was grilled with. I was lazy and didn't want to get my hands dirty so the hubby worked on the crab and gave me the meat. It was so tasty and sweet.\n\nWe also had the louie louie dungeness crab salad. The dish had a good amount of crab and their dressing was so good.  It was nice the sauce was served separately so we can control how much dressing we wanted to add. Dressing was so good that we used up all the sauce. :-\\\n\nWe had the big-bone-in filet mignon and the bone-in New York. Both were cooked to perfectly.  We asked for med rare and they delivered.\n\nAlong we the protein, we had some sides. We had Mac & Cheese, creamed spinach and brussels sprouts. Mac & cheese was great, it went well with the steak.   Both spinach and Brussels sprouts were good, it didn't stand out much for me but tasted great!\n\nWe completed our meal with a hot pineapple rum cake and a  chocolate cappuccino mousse cup. Both were yummy.  I love the rum cake.  Although our party didn't like it very much due to overly soaked-yness, I LOVED it.  The mousse cup was good. Others like this more than the rum cake. I'm not a big fan of chocolate but the layers of flavor in this desert was quite exciting for my palette. \n\nAll in all, I rate our experience at Osso 5 STARS!

My open table reservation was for 8:30pm and my date and I arrived 5 minutes early. The hostess informs us that they are running behind and that our table should be available in about 15 minutes. No big deal, I don't mind waiting till 8:40. At that time, my date goes to check on the status of our table and strikes up a conversation with another couple doing the same. Apparently their reservation was for 7:30, so they had already waited over an hour!! Of course my table wasn't ready. When my date reported all of this information to me, I became a bit alarmed because I had no intention of waiting anywhere near an hour to eat here. We argued a bit about what to do since it was New Year's Eve and any nice restaurant worth eating at was booked solid. I returned to the hostess and she tells me \"8:30pm reservations are experiencing a 30 minute delay\". I show her the time stamp on my phone (8:48pm) and ask her directly \"So you're telling me that my table will be ready in 12 minutes?'\" To this she replies \"Yes, IF there's a table available.\" This is such a bullshit answer. She knew damn well that the table wouldn't be \"available\" in 12 minutes. The couple with the 7:30 pm reservation still hadn't been seated for god's sake and there were a ton of other people also waiting. I wanted to leave then but my date wanted to stick it out till 9:00 because he's a more optimistic person than I am. Of course when I go to check on our table at 9:00, it isn't ready. When my date reminds the host that our reservation was for 8:30, the host rudely says \"All these other people waiting also have 8:30 reservations.\"\n\nSo if you want to be treated like crap by people who lie to your face, don't value your time, and don't give a rat's ass about you in general, please feel free to waste your money here.", "author": "Sally C."}

Dim low lights, waiters in tuxs and a very art deco decorum. We arrived on time for our reservation. Didn't look like the place was too packed. They had a nice bar in front which my bf and I mentioned that we should come back just for drinks sometimes as it looks like a nice place to lounge around. We were seated immediately at 7:30pm on a Tuesday night. We had the choice of sitting in a booth or a table with large leather chairs. We went for the booth as it looked cozier.\n\nFor drinks we started off with martinis. I got the basil martini while my bf got the cucumber martini. It's pretty cool as they come over to your table with the shaker of your drink and shake it up and serve to you at your table. The glasses are small but you get the whole shaker to refill as you like. I liked the basil martini a little better then the cucumber martini as I felt the cucumber one was a little too tart for my taste but my bf preferred his cucumber martini as he doesn't like overly basil-y drinks. But I do recommend starting off with any of their cocktails as they are pretty tasty and pretty boozy.\n\nFor Appetizers, we asked about the Chorizo bread and it was bread that was cooked in an iron skillet with chorizo sauce on it. It sounded amazing but a little too rich and when at a steakhouse I try not to fill up on filler food like bread.... I want ample room for my steak :) So instead we settled for 1/2 dz of oysters and an order of the crab and spinach fondue dip with crostinis. The oysters were ok. I didn't even ask nor did the waiter let us know what kind of oysters they were but it seemed like some of the oysters weren't prepped. I had a hard time eating a couple of oysters as they were still stuck to the shell. For the crab and spinach fondue, this was delicious! We enjoyed the toasted crostini bread pieces as this provided the perfect crunch to the dip. We kind of ran out of crostini and had to ask for the house bread. It took a minute so by the time we had more bread the dip was cooling and it was a little harder to get chunks of cheese dip onto the bread. But it was still delish with the house bread as the house bread was warm and fresh!\n\nFor our entrees and sides, my BF ordered the bone in filet while I ordered the petite bone in filet. We read up on the yelp reviews prior to dining here and it seemed like this place was known for this particular cut of steak so wanted to try it. For sides, we got the mac and cheese with chorizo sauce and an order of their creamed spinach w/ garlic. We also each ordered a glass of wine well because...it's steak... you always need a good red with a great piece of steak! We asked our waiter for recommendations and I went with the zinfandel and my bf ordered the rutherford cab. I preferred my zinfandel to the cab as mine was a bit smoother and spicer compared to the cab which I liked. The steaks are all cooked to med rare unless you tell them otherwise. Medium rare is how both my bf and I regularly like our steaks so this was perfect. When the steaks came out, they looked amazing! Upon first bite we both melted as the simple flavors of the steak with that sear was the perfect bite. We both enjoyed the first couple bites of our steaks at first but as we were cutting off pieces closer to the bone we noticed that the steak was a bit more rare rare then medium rare. It wasn't bloody but it was just a tad bit undercooked for our liking. The flavors were still great and we'd rather have undercooked steak then overcooked. For the sides, the mac and cheese was just ok. as soon as came out and we tried it, it was a little lacking in the flavor dept. As we waited and got closer to the bottom of the dish, it had a bit more flavor as I think the pasta had now had time to soak up the sauce that was in it. The creamed spinach with garlic was a lot lighter then expected. My bf said it tasted bland but I enjoyed it with bites of my steak. It wasn't creamy but I do like spinach and wanted some veggies with my steak so I didn't mind. So I do agree with the majority of the yelp reviews that the sides are only ok and that you should just go for the steak. \n\nThey brought a a chocolate mousse for us to help us celebrate my bf's bday so thank you Osso! :)", "author": "Christine W."}

It's hard to put into words what a perfect steak tastes like, but this is it.  I ordered it rare, and restaurants usually don't think I mean it so it comes out more medium rare than rare, but here they actually cook it rare - exactly how I like it.  The meat is so flavorful and the texture is like butter (it doesn't hurt that they baste it with butter either!).\n\nThey do have other things on the menu that look tasty, but honestly the bone-in filet is the only entr\u00e9e I've ever ordered.  The chorizo cheese bread is insanely good, the yellowtail carpaccio and octopus crostini are great, as are the cauliflower gremolata and asparagus.\n\nThe wine list is very reasonable and the corkage fee is $15 - as low as I've seen anywhere in the City.  The drink list is great as well - the basil martini is crazy good.\n\nThe ambiance itself is very comfortable.  The music is classic Sinatra, and not so loud you can't talk to the person next to you.  I know it's a novel idea to have conversation-friendly restaurants these days, but this place gets stars from me as a place you can actually have a conversation without shouting.\n\nThe service is great - everyone is very friendly and attentive.

I was planning a birthday dinner for four of us and wanted to make special and asked Bix some questions regarding their music, atmosphere and menu and they didn't have time to answer.

We ordered the  sizzling medium platter of shrimp as an appetizer as well like in the Bay Area Check Please video and followed the suggestion of the Bone in filet. petite filet and the bone in rib eye (big) on the menu.  We ordered mac and cheese, mushrooms, creamed corn(so yummy), creamed spinach (just ok, a bit salty), baked potato (so yummy). Everything was so great.  the meat melted in your mouth. For dessert we had the chocolate mousse (rich), the Cr\u00e8me Brule cheesecake (so good) and the ube purple panacotta (very light and just smooth- perfect for after a heavy meal.

Wow! It was cooked perfectly (medium rare). The twice baked potato was a little on the dry side but flavor good. They brought out sides family style as well. There were many so this may be long. The Brussels sprouts were cooked well, keeping a light crisp. It also had a bit of spice added giving it a kick. I liked it. The Mac and cheese was good. Not incredible but not bad. Cream of corn had a lot of whole kernels in there which I liked but others may not. Flavor was good. They also had crispy rustic potatoes which was perfectly fried and seasoned. Finally was the chocolate mousse. The bottom cappuccino layer was the best part. The chocolate layer was good as well. Overall the dessert was good enough to order again but not enough so that I would not want to try something else on the menu again.  \nThe following is my review on my tasting of my guest's order. \nThe butterfish (black cod) was amazing as well. Wow! Tasted just like back home, Hawai'i! I also tried their lemon tart which was less on the sweet side. Which I really enjoyed and it went well with the tea I ordered. However, it was not as sweet as most so if you enjoy your lemon tart with a lot of sugar in it, you wouldn't enjoy this at all. \nOverall, I will be going back to bring friend.

The filet was tender and juicy, perfectly seared with a light crust. It was so tender that it made the NY taste a little tough. But after I cleansed my palate with some brussel sprouts, I was able to appreciate the tastiness of the NY, which we licked clean (at home).\n\nLemon torte-perfect finish to an outstanding meal!", "author": "Christine S."}

We split the carnivore's delight, 2 pounds of dry-aged bone-in dbl cut New York steak (called the, brace yourself, New York New York)--Osso claims it's the only place you can get the cut--and still had plenty to take home for dinner tonight (can't wait to gnaw on the nutty bone). A seafood combo of mussels, shrimp, and crab legs and claws on a sizzling-hot cast iron platter was a snappy starter (especially with those martinis). \n\nOur extremely nice waitperson Sara made sure we kept the lemon tarte in mind as we plowed through the courses, and good thing we did.

I sent it back, and they simply cooked it further, with all the juices running out of the steak. Nonplussed, I still enjoyed the meat, which was finally medium rare.

We had reservations & had asked for a quiet booth.  This was our first visit & it certainly won't be our last.  We were seated in a luxurious booth at the far end of the room.  Michael, our server, recommended a smooth pinot from the wine list.  For starters, we enjoyed the chorizo cheese sourdough.  Lots of flavorful cheese, quite decadent!  I ordered the 18 ounce bone-in filet & my husband ordered the abalone.  Michael questioned the chef for us regarding its preparation & size as none of the reviews included abalone. Kudos to the chef as it was perfectly prepared & cooked.  My steak was as tender and flavorful as all the reviews. We had one side, the twice-baked potato.  It went perfectly with both entrees & was wonderful.  My husband took home a piece of delicious cheesecake.  Michael was one of the most professional, well-informed & attentive servers we've ever had & we have traveled extensively. After dinner, we stopped at their bar & was entertained by their  friendly, Irish bartender.  The manager stopped by & chatted & seemed very pleased we had enjoyed our dining experience.  I would liken this steakhouse to one in New York City, Keen's Steakhouse & Chophouse, which is rated  five stars with Zagat.  Some of the reviews have stated other steakhouses such as Ruth Chris, House of Prime Riib (which isn't a true place for a steak), or Harris were preferred.  I disagreed.  Osso's has their noise level contained which is essential for a 5 star dining experience.  Try Osso's & enjoy every moment, including the complimentary valet.", "author": "Kristin H."}

The chorizo bread and crab cakes were very satisfying; Good cheese, and the crab cakes were mostly crab, just as they should be!  The sides were very normal, nothing special. But, the FILET MIGNON was amazing. Incredibly juicy, very medium rare (It had the most beautiful red center...!), smelled delicious, tasted delicious. God, I'd come back to eat this type of steak no matter what! \n\nService: It was overall fine; the waiters were very pleasant and we got everything we needed. However, I have two stories to share, which is what brought the star down to 4: \n1. I was ordering at the bar, I didn't see anything that caught my eye on the drinks menu, so I asked the bartender if he could whip something up with a rum or whiskey base with some froth, or orange flavor. Maybe I spoke too quickly, or maybe I'm not supposed to ask for custom drinks, because he looked at me oddly and said, 'You want the Gin special?'  \n2. We had just about finished our appetizers, and so the waiter came and cleared our appetizer plates. However, he then left a basket of warm bread on the table, but we were left with no plates. I was SO confused. We waited a couple minutes, and then started cutting and eating our bread straight off of our table. Eventually, we caught their eyes and pointed out that we had no plates for our bread. They should have noticed themselves, or, should have brought plates out in the first place for the bread. \n\nPrice: I felt was very reasonable for the delicious steak!", "author": "Jennifer W."}

The bar is bewitching, the wait staff wear tails, even the busboys are nattily dressed that it would make Nucky Thompson proud.  \n\nCan we talk about the service for a minute?  We had Tim as our waiter and as my husband put it, they do not make 'em like that anymore - he managed to be the best waiter I have had in ages.  He knew the menu through and through, directed us to the right cocktail matching and was an overall delight with his knowledge of fine whiskeys.  \n\nNow onto our meal.  I wasn't too hungry so I opted for 5 oz. petite filet, oh goodness, the sear on the steak was beautiful and then to cut through to the juicy pink steak...it was a piece of perfection!  Hubby had the NY bone-in and he refused to give me a bite, because it was that good - he absolutely gobbled it up.  The creamed spinach side and mac&cheese were equally as tasty (maybe a tad heavy on the chorizo for the mac & cheese for me, but hubby preferred it that way) but the stars were the steaks.  We sat in a speakeasy-esque table with leather winged back chairs that added to the ambience.  To top it off (we were celebrating), hubby ordered a shot of the $100 23 year old Pappy Van Winkle - and yes, it went down as smooth as you can image (a little hot at first, but it went down well with the steaks).

When we arrived we were told our table would be ready in about 5 minutes, no big deal. The hostess came back and said it would be 15 - 20 minutes so we had a seat at the bar, again, not a huge deal. They were able to seat us in one of the cabana booths which was nice, as I requested a quiet table. Aside from a nice table and a decent waiter, everything else lacked. The overpriced food did not match the quality and portion size. We ordered Crab Cakes and a Caesar Salad to share for starters and they were both extremely small ($17 for 2 tiny crab cakes and $10 for an even smaller Caesar salad). I ordered my $50 filet medium well (I know, who orders filet mignon medium well), and it literally came out burnt to a crisp. I am not one for sending food back, but my husband felt so bad that I wasn't going to eat it so he kindly asked the waiter for a new one. But even the new one was pretty burnt. The waiter was great, he brought a new one and took both off of our bill, for which we gratefully tipped him very well for. I know it's blasphemy to order a filet mignon medium well at any respected steakhouse, but Ruth's Chris never misses the mark on this one so I know it can be done. We had the mac and cheese and brussel sprouts for sides. Neither of them were great. Again, tiny portions and the quality was just lacking. If this place was priced lower, I probably wouldn't go to such extreme measures to write a negative review, but I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to warn others not to spend their money here...go to Ruth's Chris or Harris' for delicious steak and pass this place up.", "author": "Valerie d."}

Saw they had good reviews and thought it was worth a try.\n\nHuge disappointment. Horrible (non-existent) service, and a downright tough and grisly steak and fish for a supermarket bag.\n\nService: our waitress seemed socially challenged or was having a bad day. After taking our drink order she showed back up with our drinks and answered a quick question. She came back a few minutes later to take our order and that was pretty much the last we saw of her. We asked her to take our picture and she disappeared. We finally had the bus man do it. When we were done with our food and the busser cleaned the table she did a flyby dessert menu drop off without a word. Then dropped the check with a very insincere smile and labored \"Thanks\".\n\nHad better service at a McDonalds!\n\nFood: we had Caesar salad, beet salad, bone in ny steak, and cod with the twice baked potatoes and brussel sprouts.\n\nThe beet salad was very good but small. The Caesar was also very small and frankly not very good. It should be noted that the bread was delivered after the salad and the butter was cold and unspreadable (I hate that). The cod was nothing more than a small portion drizzled with store bought miso sauce. Good but certainly not worth half the price paid. The steak was rare at best and tough (even though the menu says that the steaks are cooked to medium rare). The sides were good but portions small.\n\nIt's hard to ruin a good cut of steak and its even harder to make a bad cut good. For a place that claims to be a steakhouse they need to check the quality of their product.\n\nThe best things about this place were the super nice valet guy, and busser....oh and the beet salad.\n\nI hate the zero tolerance policy and usually give a second chance but there was just too much wrong when you're a higher class restaurant.

I'm not sure if  my expectation was too high due to my first experience but I was pretty disappointed with the quality of the steak this time.  The appetizers, drinks/wine and service were good.\n\nIn all, I'm not sure if this is the place for bigger party, and I'm hoping the quaintly is still there for much smaller group...maybe one or two.", "author": "Hilda W."}

We had been wanting to eat here for some time since it is a few blocks away. We were blown away by the decor, extremely comfortable chairs, highly attentive service, excellent cocktails, and delicious food. The steaks were cooked to perfection, the chorizo cheese bread is indescribably good (and addictive), and the mac & cheese/creamed spinach made for great sides. We can't wait to come back and try some of the bar menu. 5 stars without question.", "author": "Ryan C."}

Organic beet salad with goat cheese has incredible flavor and zing to the last bite! The Dungeoness crab cakes are amazing in taste and the fact that it's 99% crab which sits on a rosemary butter to give it the perfect balance of flavor and is amazing! The Bone in Filet is amazingly tender and the sauce glazed on top adds the perfect combination of happiness with each bite! The bottled wine list is surprisingly priced not reasonably and that being a Great thing! Groth and Duckhorn for $79! Compare at other places and you'll understand why I chose surprisingly not reasonable to describe! Excellent staff and the decor and ambiance of this restaurant is beautiful and different from section to section table to table! Good Luck to Osso!", "author": "Paul A."}

I've had a lot of steak in my time, not only here in San Francisco, but in cities throughout the United States and abroad, and I've got to say that the steak served here is the absolute best.  Really.  I like my steak super rare and it's not often that I get it cooked that way.  It almost always arrives over-cooked which is why I don't eat at steakhouses often, even though I love good steak.  But, they don't overcook the meat at Osso.  They cook it perfectly.  Each time I've eaten here the steak has arrived perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned.  The meat just melts in your mouth. It is super tender and flavorful.   I've only ordered the bone-in filet which is out of this world.  If you've never had a bone-in filet, I highly recommend you try it.  It is superb!\n\nI seem to always order the same thing because it is so darn good- bone-in filet with a side of brussels sprouts.  You can't go wrong.  A delicious dinner, and one in which you don't have to strain to hear what the people at your table are saying!  So refreshing!\n\nThis is a wonderful addition to Nob Hill.  With attentive, friendly service, wonderful\nfood, and a lovely are deco setting, what else could you ask for?  I will be coming back on a regular basis.", "author": "Anne C."}

The doors were opened, so we aproached the bar to have a drink before we were seated. The bartender looks at us with a disgusted look on his face and curtly states \"we don't start till 5\", then walks away (it was 4:52) The supposed hostess then asks us if we have a reservation, which she checks on, then mumbles something under her breath while walking away. At this point we walk out the door. We were about to spend $400+ at this place, but because of the terribly rude staff, we left, walk a few blocks down the road, and found a wonderful steakhouse called Bob's in the lobby of the Omni Hotel, that greatly deserved our business. A little tip to all you supposed 5star joints out there; if your business opens at 5, don't make reservations for 5, lots of people like to arrive early for drinks. You lost our business, Osso, we'll never go back. Also, fire your bartender, his attitude and unwillingness to serve us a couple really simple drinks chased us out the door.", "author": "Crimson Fiona M."}

I ordered the osso-style porterhouse cooked medium-rare.  Osso-style means they cook the filet and New York separately.  My filet was perfect.  But my New York was cooked medium, almost towards well done.  I let the server know, and she asked what I'd like them to do, and I said I'll just finish it.  Given how much the meal cost (we also had an expensive bottle of wine), they should have immediately offered to cook my New York correctly, not \"what would you like us to do\".

I have to say I was highly disappointed.  First, my sister and I ordered a bottle of cabernet and it came up chilled.  Understandably, it came from the cellar and so should be kept cool, but chilled where you could literally wipe condensation off the bottle.  The mussel appetizer was fine, oysters were good, but the true let down was the \"bone-in petite filet mignon\" and vegetable sides.  We ordered the brussel sprouts side and we were shocked that the restaurant uses frozen brussel sprouts not fresh.  This is very obvious from the size and shape of the brussel sprouts and of course the texture.  This should have definitely been a warning for the filet, but I was still surprised that the filet mignon was actually chateaubriand with a bone attached with meat glue.  I only know the specifics because my sister is a chef and was able to tell everything right away.  I am no expert but even I could tell with the brussel sprouts and the difference on meat texture.  Needless to say, I will not be returning nor recommending this establishment to my friends.", "author": "Elena P."}

Asked the Concierge at the St. Francis for a steakhouse that was high quality and moderately priced.  Osso is first rate.  We were told they specialize in Steak and Crab.  Both are prepared to perfection there.  The Filet was flavorful, perfectly charred, and cut by my fork like Buddah. The crab was prepared in Butter, Garlic and herbs, broiled just the right amount.  They also did a great job on the desserts.  Brought in a 1990 Lagrange Ste Julien.  Had a difficult cork, but the waiter handled it perfectly.  $15 corkage at a great steakhouse, are you kidding me?  Next time I am up this way, I'm sure I won't be able to get in the door, but I will savor this meal for a long time.", "author": "Mark D."}

The restaurant is quite lovely when you first walk in with the dressed up wait staff and the art deco finishes. We ordered a variety of appetizers. We enjoyed the fried olives and calamari. Our drinks took quite some time to arrive from the bar. My husband ordered the bone in filet which was actually quite amazing. I ordered the New York steak which was quite disappointing. My steak was over cooked, dry and not very flavorful. I wish i would have ordered the filet. This restaurant does not offer a Ribeye steak which was a bummer. I was not impressed with any of the sides we ordered. The mac and cheese was dry, flavorless. The creamed corn and brussel sprouts were over cooked and squishy. Our server did nothing for the birthday we were there celebrating but overall a decent experience. I will most likely go somewhere else to enjoy a good piece of MEAT.", "author": "Jennifer S."}

Wanted to end the night with a great dinner and we found it here!  One of the reasons we decided to try is because they were the most reasonably priced for a corkage fee... other steakhouses were charging $70 for a magnum bottle! Not here... The food was delicious!!! I had the surf & turf w/ a Petite filet and crab legs... it was the best steak I have had in a long time! It was cooked and seasoned wonderfully, as were the grab legs!  My husband had the bone in new york and let me tell you that steak had no chance! For the sides we had the shoestring zucchini fries, creamed corn and chorizo mac & cheese,  all were delicious!  Specially the zucchini fries,  the served a goof portion, enough for us to share w/ out friends.  The staff was great!  From our waitress,  to the bus boy to the maitre d!

I'm guessing thats why it's kinda loud in there.\n\nservice is pretty lacking. we were seated by the hostess and it was almost 10 minutes before the waiter came. he didnt introduce himself. by then we were ready to order. he asked us if we wanted water. we said yes and before we could say anything else he walked away. he came back awhile later and we ordered. in the next 30 minutes or so, we received and ate our bread and our appetizers, which were brought out by the other kitchen staff guys. i wanted to order another beer but the waiter never came around, and the guy who fills up my water cant take drink orders. he said he would call my waiter. i see the waiter come out of the kitchen a few minutes later and he goes to another table to see how their food is. then he goes to another table to talk to them. then he goes back in the kitchen. one of the guys who brings out the food noticed i looked a little upset and asked if i needed anything. i told him im waiting for my waiter so i can order a drink. he tells me he'll put in the order. he does this and i see him telling my waiter at the computer. the waiter still never acknowledges me or lets me know my drink is on its way. i see the kitchen guy bring out the food for another table a couple minutes later and i notice him checking that i got my beer. then a minute later he comes back with it. honestly i think this food server guys should switch jobs with the waiter. kinda ridiculous for a place thats supposed to be \"upscale\" according to yelpers.\n\nappetizers - grilled shrimp, chorizo cheese bread, crab and spinach fondue. all were pretty good and savory. non-pretentious portions\n\nentrees - petit filet, bone-in filet. twice baked potato, mac n cheese. \n\nsteaks - both came on a plain rectangular tray/plate with nothing else on it. the plate looked like it came from a cafeteria. my gf got the petit filet and it looked like about 5 oz. it looked like something from a mom n pop diner. it was only about 3/4in thick. my bone in filet was nice and meaty. probly about 1 1/2in thick and about 16oz. i ordered medium rare, but it was more rare than i would expect if i had ordered rare. it wasnt pink, it wasnt red. it was more of a purple. looked like seared ahi tuna. and the texture was stingy and mushy...almost as if it had been frozen and defrosted. for this price point, id expect to be able to cut right through it. but nope. i blame the meat, the chef, and the knife they provided. by the time i was half way through, it looked like raw ground beef.\n\nthe mac n cheese tasted like the chorizo cheese bread. the twice baked potato was about 1/3 the size of my steak and had no sour cream. it had the texture of day-old potato salad.\n\nthe mango panna cotta was meh.\n\nin the time we waited for the waiter to bring the check, we saw the table across from us send their steaks back, and the table next to them left after only eating about half of theirs.\n\nour total bill for the two of us was $169 before tip. do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. otherwise be prepared to wait awhile for your waiter just so you can tell him that your steak was prepared wrong.", "author": "JeF m."}
