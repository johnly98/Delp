Their claim to fame is organic ingredients for mexican food, and that's reflected in their price. They're like the Whole Foods of mexican food.\n\nI'm not one for organic food, but this place is high quality and close by. If I lived in the mission, and I felt like more of a tex-mex vibe, I would come here. Otherwise, their burritos and tacos are nothing like the mission style I have become accustomed to. One dish I would recommend: their rustic shrimp enchiladas ($20 after tax). It's a heaping mess, but the shrimp is super tasty and the cabbage on top is cut with lime juice, making the whole amalgamation one of my favorite things to order.\n\nBurritos are average, in fact, probably a little below. I wished they wrapped them a little tighter, because sometimes they're a little wieldy to handle. The duck burrito is also not that great, since they take the mexican vibe and add ... tamarind sauce? It becomes kind of watery and the flavor is not as focused. Stick to the basics if you want a burrito.", "author": "Albert C."}

For me not being particularly a shrimp person I was hesitated, but to be honest This dish blew my mind! \nI wasn't expecting anything like this. When I first had a bite of shrimp, I was like ok it's just shrimp and maybe I should've got a pulled pork or slow cooked carne asada. When I dug a little and tasted the sauce, I was like mmmm? MMMMMM!! What is this? Is this loaded with butter or what makes it taste like this?? I was confused but with a joy and happiness explosion in my mouth. I really love they mount the dish with thin sliced cabbages. It goes really well and add the texture to the already well polished dish. \n\nAnother high point is They service sangria from Cha cha cha, which I am a huge fan of. I just wish their version wasnt so watered down because sangria from Cha x3 is always on point. But it was still flavored good. Maybe I'll ask for it without ice next time. \n\nThere are a bunch of other things I wanted to get on the menu. I am definitely coming back!", "author": "Cartman P."}

I came in and after seeing 4 names ahead of me and a full house, I decided to order take-out. The solo waitress was on the phone, rushing here and there and it took ~20 minutes before she took my order. I had to stand awkwardly by the kitchen which was literally ~3x5ft or smaller (they had 2 chefs and 1 dish washer). I asked for a duck confit regular burrito (the super burrito included avocado and sour cream I think) and she confirmed by asking 'regular burrito?' and I nodded. Turns out, she wrote down 'regular burrito' and no duck confit... What did she think I was doing for the first 3 syllables of my order? I probably should have confirmed back about the duck confit/checked my receipt but it was dark, I was hangry and I thought she wrote it down as I was speaking. \n\nAfterwards, she gave us the check but forgot to take the receipt and was so busy the entire time that we just held the receipt, pen, and everything (basically right in front of her) until we picked up our order ~30 minutes later. \n\nLike I said, the rustic shrimp was amazing--flavors came together, great dynamic, good choice of cheese, but the burrito was the sum of its parts and not mind-blowing. That, on top of the unpleasant wait, made this experience rather disappointing. They also gave me 1 sauce for the chips even though they were packaging 3 different sauces (?)", "author": "Lydia Z."}

One thing to note right away is that this is not straight up Mexican and you wont get hearty taqueria dishes here. They have hamburgers/fries on the menu so don't be alarmed. With that said the menu has good options. The one thing that really bothered me was that they used fried chicken instead of grilled in a lot of their dishes (not my thing but may be yours?) . I always am in search of a good Mexican restaurant (not taqueria, although those are very near and dear to my heart) that serves an amazing plate of  enchiladas. I haven't found many in SF so I had been eyeing Papito for a while because they had two types of enchiladas on their menu. \n\nWhat I got: Guac, decent but def not super fresh table side made guac , but hard to complain about guac. Verde enchiladas with chicken, this dish actually had shredded chicken but I wish i got it without . I wasn't a fan of the taste of the chicken. The verde sauce was great!! I'd prob get this again but vegetarian instead and maybe less cheese bc it was really smothered. \n\nThey have some outdoor seating which would be great on a nice day.

The service was also quite inattentive, and we sometimes had to ask multiple times to get the things we wanted. All that being said, though, the food here is really tasty and a good value for the price! I came for dinner on a Friday with a group of three--we sat together at the bar and were started with chips and salsa. The menu here looks quite simple--small plates, tacos, burritos, and mains--with the same selection of meats being repeated for the various categories.\n\nWe started with the Ensalada Papito, a beautifully dressed salad of romaine lettuce, cucumber, and avocado. Every piece of vegetation on the salad was covered perfectly with a delicious, savory cilantro dressing--there was great crunch from the tortilla strips as well! We had the steak fajitas, which came on a sizzling plate--the thin pieces of steak were marinated perfectly (great, hearty flavor) and were grilled with bell peppers and onions. There were also tortillas and rice/beans on the side, but the meat was definitely the star of the show. We also had the chicken enchiladas, which came in a delicious, decadent tomato sauce, and the carnitas tacos, which came with amazingly juicy pork (not at all too fatty) and a nice slaw on top as well.\n\nOverall, some of the tastiest Mexican food I've had in a while--though the atmosphere and service are nothing to speak of, the great food was certainly well worth the visit!", "author": "David K."}

The place is small but comfortable; the music and hubbub were warm and engaging without being too loud for conversation. The staff was friendly and attentive; most importantly to me, they were all laughing and joking with one another. That's the sign of a good restaurant to me--if the staff is relaxed and having a good time while working. \n\nThe food was really good---the salsas that come with the chips are super fresh; one was tomatillo-based, and I think the other was chile de arbol. Just spicy enough to be interesting without nuking your tastebuds before dinner arrives. I had the posole verde; it was not greasy at all, which can be posole's main problem. It had light, bright flavors, with a bit of crunch from the thinly sliced radishes and shredded green cabbage. The pork was tender and flavorful without being fatty. Probably the best bowl of posole I've ever had. \n\nThe others had tacos, which they were very happy with; my mom did get the chicken enchiladas and felt they were too salty. That was our only quibble with the food. We also got the agave wine margaritas, which were very good and not very strong, which was fine with us. \n\nGet the churros for dessert, they were very tasty, and again, not greasy.", "author": "Jamey M."}

It's not your average taqueria and while it is by no means a ridiculous sum for the quality food and service that Papito offers, it is priced on the slightly higher end of \"casual dining\". Think $12-22 for an entree. \n\nService was great, we were brought a carafe of water and were constantly being offered refills on our chips and salsa. \n\nI ordered the regular al pastor burrito, which our server assured me was not dry in the slightest (such is my experience with many Mexican places in SF). My bf had the fried chicken (!!!) quesadilla.\n\nWe were in sort of a hurry because we did not want to be more late than we already were for the show we were catching a few blocks down. Despite this time constraint, we both enjoyed our dishes immensely.\n\nHis quesadilla came out looking absolutely fabulous. The presentation was simply tantalizing and although I didn't want to try too much of it for fear of the cheese messing with my stomach, the few bits of fried chicken I nibbled at were absolutely amazing. The perfect amount of crispiness to tender, juicy chicken ratio. And it wasn't sopping with cheese, either. It seemed to be mostly chicken and avocado with a thin layer of cheese below.\n\nThe tortillas incorporated in both of our dishes were toasted to perfection in all the right places--they had a great crunch every time you took a bite. \n\nMy burrito was DEFINITELY not dry or like any al pastor I've ever had! The first bite I took (after, of course, cradling this thing like a baby because of its size) was rich and saucy with a sweet tang aftertaste. A few more bites in and I realized the al pastor here is cooked with pineapple! Definitely unexpected and while it wasn't totally unwelcome, I may have ordered something else had I known. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed eating a sumptuous burrito the size of my forearm and having enough leftover to warrant a snack for later.\n\nThough I'm not sure when next time will be, as I don't get out to Potrero Hill very often, I would love to try the carnitas or fried chicken in a burrito.\n\nThank you, Papito, for giving me one of the most fulfilling Mexican food experiences I've had since moving to this city from San Diego 5 years ago!!", "author": "Megan D."}

For some reason it's difficult to find solid Mexican food in San Francisco - you can find it, but you need to search.  I came here with two friends for brunch recently and we chose this spot due to a craving for breakfast burritos and because the wait at Plow was 1 hour and 45 minutes.\n\nFirst of all, this is an \"organic\" restaurant and the food is very high quality.  Also the size of the restaurant its not too big nor too small (ok, maybe it's on the small side).  There's sidewalk seating with heaters if you're in an outdoorsy kind of mood, but eating in the restaurant is comfortable.  \n\nService was friendly and prompt, though the only issue we had (and the reason they lost a star) was that all of our orders where in some way......wrong.  First of all, my buddy was served the wrong breakfast burrito (shrimp vs. chorizo), on top of that, the two breakfast burritos were swapped between my friend and his girlfriend.  She ordered the vegi breakfast burrito, and we were happy she was not a strict veterinarian since it took a few bites of her burrito to figure out it was chorizo.  Finally, my crab cakes eggs benedict arrived sans egg.  This gaff aside, the food overall was very good and the serving size was also pretty generous.  Additionally the house salsa is nearly perfect, it tastes a little roasted and its spicy without being overly so.  Finally, they did comp some money back on our tab once we received the bill and apologized several times for the issues with our order.  \n\nOverall, this is great neighborhood Mexican restaurant that serves some unique dishes and excellent food overall.

One thing I look in a restaurant is consistency and might have to look for another place in the area. Also there is an aftertaste in the shrimp.", "author": "Eric G."}

I can only write up about the tacos because those are my jam and I never stray. The vegetarian taco, and the Hawaiian taco are both incredible. They look like small tacos but they're filled with yummy goodness so I usually order two and separate out the tortilla to get 4. Do not, I repeat do NOT forget to order churros at the end of your meal. They are next level. The service is usually great, but beware that the space is pretty small so on a Friday or Saturday night you could have to wait a bit. Not a problem because there's a great wine bar around the corner to grab a drink at in the meantime. Oh and also their salsa is spectacular. Not sure what it is that they do to make it so sweet AND spicy, but it's unlike other salsas I've had.", "author": "Rachelle T."}

This experience alone would have been a 2 at best, but averaging it out, I went with a 3.   Honestly, on each of my 3 visits, the customer service has always been lacking, but the food has made up for it.     I'm cant understand how ... With 4-5 people working, at a place the size of a studio apartment with 6 tables and as many bar seats, with nearly as many customers as staff each time we were there.... you'd expect that the staff... who stands around lollygagging with each other and their bar customer the majority of the time, would take the opportunity to sho better customer service.    People pay restaurant prices - Not so much for the food they can make at home... but much for the service and personality you get when you go out.    the Staff should check in and see if we needed more water, napkins, or anything else... but the overall pretentious vibe of the place (perhaps its the French influence) certianly does affect the customer service here... not just this last time... but pretty much each time.     \n\nAs far as the food, if you like paying 17 for a wet steak burrito that most any other place would have been half the price and twice the size... and probably just as enjoyable.    The salsa... well... its just ketchup with some Tapatio mixed in.   But the habanero salsa is pretty good, and helps add some flavor to the food... if you could get the attention of one of the staffers to reach over and squeeze it out of the bottle for you, witch takes only 10 seconds, but getting someones attention takes 5 minutes.      \n\nOverall... after 3 times... and never that impressed... I my go back... but likely I won't.   Its just too pricey for the quality of the food and quantity of the portions, and the customer service does not make up for the difference.", "author": "Vlad C."}

Caramelized onions, queso, and avocado on a lightly toasted ciabatta rounded out the burger. Wasn't a fan of their soggy wedge cut fries.

However, in the past few weeks the service, food, and operations have gone down hill. \nSeems the servers on any given night cannot manage the few tables along with take out orders. They have stopped answering the phone to place take out orders so we have tried using Grub Hub, that only works if the servers place the order. We have walked here the last few times to place our order since they don't answer the phone. This seems to take at least an hour to get our food, and most of the time they get the order wrong. \nIt is obvious they need 2 servers on most nights and they could use a server with a tad bit more energy. The staff a few months ago were always super attentive and friendly, now they seem to be indifferent and a bit rude. Sorry to say we will need to look for a new favorite Potrero Hill special spot. It's nice to see that this sweet little spot with great food become so successful, however, we see the sweet spot fading as quality and kindness have been replaced by quantity. This place has become way to stressful to deal with after an already stressful day.  We are very sad To say the Papito experience is no longer.", "author": "Mark N."}

I've been there twice so far and both times I have been impressed. The staff there is incredibly friendly and welcoming. I have personally never had to wait for a table but have seen the lines get incredibly long. The space is very tiny so only about 5 or 6 tables fit.\n\nEveryone gets a bowl of chips along with three sauces to dip into. On my first visit I got a carne asada super burrito--SO good. It is a bit pricey at about $10 but I was able to save half to take home for another meal. Rarely have I had a burrito where I didn't feel the need to add any extra salsa or sauces. The second time I decided to try one of their many taco selections. I got the camaron costeno taco (saut\u00e9ed shrimp, garlic, avocado, mango pico de gallo) and although you only get two tacos, they are PACKED so they fill you up. Sort of difficult to eat but overall really yummy. Paired with their red sangria (probably the best I have ever had), the meal was complete. \n\nNext time will have to try the duck confit because they were out when we went! Although on the pricier end for Mexican food (only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars), in my books it has been worth it every time.", "author": "Alysha F."}

This cute Mexican restaurant is right across the street from her apartment. It's not a huge restaurant, and seems quite popular, but we were able to grab a table immediately. I wasn't sure about the portion sizes here, I was worried that an order of tacos would just be two tiny appetizer sized tacos, but I was happy to find out that it actually makes a perfect sized meal if you're not starving. They have all different types of fillings, and what I figure out too late was that you can actually get two different tacos with each order. I ended up getting the shrimp tacos and they were tasty.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-21", "description": "Papito is that odd culinary conundrum, the upscale Mexican restaurant. Odd in the fact that we all know some of the best Mexican to be had in the city is in the well-known holes-in-the-wall in the Mission like El Farolito or Taqueria Vallarta. Only one in the semi-fancy category stands out to me, Colibri near Union Square, but now I can assert that Papito is just about ready to join Colibri in the top echelon. Just a few tweaks here and there, and Papito will become a go-to place beyond Potrero Hill dwellers. I only realized it was there when Genevieve earned Review of the Day about a month ago for her familiar summary of highlights. \n\nI decided it was worth Jamie W. and me returning to his old neighborhood where he readily points out that Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves canoodled in \"Sweet November\". Papito turns out to be around the corner from 18th on Connecticut next door to Rocketfish. It's a rinky-dink space but nicely appointed. It was a shivery evening, so we weren't much for waiting. Luckily, two seats opened up at the curve of the counter next to the window. It was a tight squeeze for the young girls at the end of the counter, but we all fit somehow. \n\nSo I knew it was \"upscale\" when they didn't lay down a basket of chips automatically. No, I ordered the $6 Guacamole Papito, which afforded us fresh tortilla chips with some of the most flavorful guacamole I've had in these parts. It had cilantro, serrano peppers, queso fresco, jitomate and lime mixed with the smashed avocados (see photo). Tasty and addictive. Jamie went with the $9 Super Burrito which had duck to go with the rice, beans, fresh guacamole and pico de gallo, and creme fraiche. For all that, he characterized it as \"pretty good\". Mine was more of a slam dunk, the $8 pair of Carnitas de Pato Tacos, which had duck confit carnitas, homemade pickles, habanero peppers, mint, and chipotle and drizzled with tamarind sauce (see photo). Those were mouthfuls of joy bursting with flavor. \n\nI went overboard and ordered the $10 Carnitas Quesadilla to share (see photo). We were actually hoping they forgot it since it was late coming to the counter, and we were quickly getting stuffed. It was huge and stuffed with Berkshire pork, guajillo salsa roja, shredded Monterey Jack cheese, and a pineapple pico de gallo (see photo). Delicious though we needed to doggie-bag it. That decision allowed us in our self-justified minds to order the $5 Mexican flan, perfectly firm in texture with just the right amount of sweetness from the caramel (see photo). Definitely worth a return visit sometime soon. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...solid four-star cuisine with tacos and quesadillas that soar and a burrito that was grounded for repairs \nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...dark and polished but oh-so cramped \nSERVICE - 4 stars...friendly Frenchman followed by a conscientious server \nTOTAL - 4 stars...nice surprise on Potrero Hill, the forgotten dining destination...at least to me", "author": "Ed U."}

The Carne Asada is grilled and charred very nicely. Other than Japanese restaurants, not many places can make a taco with the tempura shrimp.

Papito is the kind of small, affordable restaurant with lovingly-cooked food that every neighborhood should have.\n\nWe ordered the guacamole to share, they had the enchiladas and I got the 2 tacos for $9 deal, which the menu proudly states comes with sour cream (mmmm, sour cream). The guacamole was thick and garlicky, but missing that zest that I like in my guac. The enchilada was okay, but a little too dry for me.\n\nThe two tacos I picked were the Carne Asada (grilled skirt steak, avocado, caramelized onions, salsa molcajete, salsa roja, fresh radish) and the Papa Con Chorizo (homemade Mexican chorizo, potatoes, salsa verde and pico de gallo). \n\nThe Carne Asada was good, flavorful, filling, yeah, yeah, blah, blah--Holy sweet mother of Jebus, the Papa Con Chorizo was INCREDIBLE!!! If God himself decided to visit the earth as a taco, I bet he would be Papito's Papa Con Chorizo. Think perfectly-seasoned meat in a perfectly-created sauce with the world's tenderest potatoes. You know how meat and potatoes is a favorite meal combination in America? Well, Papito offers a Mexican version of that and you have to try it.\n\nThe space is small, probably only big enough for a dozen or so diners at most. My friend told me the kitchen is actually run by French cooks, hence the inclusion of non-traditional menu offerings like duck confit. Not sure if that's true or just Papito being different, but our waiter (who might also have been the manager) was certainly a fun, charismatic guy who isn't averse to teasing the heck out of you in a good-natured way.

I've dined in the restaurant a couple of times now (we mainly do take out since we live so close) and each time our service was very lacking. Our last time here was a few weeks ago. After being seated in the outdoor area by one of the servers, no one came back until at least 15-20 minutes later. We didn't even get water while we waited. All the while, we were seeing the servers place chips and water on EMPTY tables that were inside. Also don't care for their attitudes as well.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-25", "description": "Honestly, seeing 1 star reviews of this place baffles me. Let me establish a few assumptions.\n\n1) We are in San Francisco. Dining is not as cheap as it is in, say, my old local San Diego taco truck. We all knew this going in.\n\n2) This is a restaurant which is serving quality food. I'm not going to expect the flavors (or price, see above) of a greasy 2am burrito. I want something a little nicer.\n\n3) The Potrero neighborhood vibe is intimate -- small, unassuming shops which are routinely packed. This is intentional and good. The waiter is used to locals who enjoy their food, and isn't going to get in my face every 3 minutes about a drink refill. On a Friday night there might be a bit of a wait.\n\nWith that said, /wow/. What a wonderful find. I recently moved to Potrero from Palo Alto, and given the size and decor of the restaurants, I was sure I'd have to spend a small fortune on some overhyped \"gourmet\" portions. In other words, I'd either be frequently cooking at home or frequently guilty at how much of my budget was going to food. Papito, like Chez Maman around the corner, completely broke those preconceived notions. \n\nEverything I've tried has been delicious -- and this is coming from the sort of insufferable guy who always whines about [insert anything north of Los Angeles] Mexican not being up to snuff. The chips and salsa are inventive and wonderful, the calamari addictive, the burritos are uniformly excellent (try the Burrito Mojado with Al Pastor), and the duck confit tacos are out of this world. \n\nThe people are also anything but snobby. The owner clearly loves what he does, and is very friendly. Sit at a table with a friend, or at the bar alone, and have chips and salsa handed to you almost immediately. Service is as quick and attentive as you'd like it -- I can have a leisurely conversation while dining over an hour and a half; or I can get a Corona, an appetizer, and a burrito in under 30 minutes.\n\nFinally, by any reasonable San Francisco standards, the place is CHEAP. If you want to go all out with a beer, appetizer, and dinner, you might be looking at $20. If you just want a world-class burrito that's filling enough to hibernate for another 16 hours, you can do it for $12. No, it isn't a $4 beef-filled doorstop the size of Mark Wahlberg's arm, but is that really what you came to this neighborhood expecting? When compared to just about anything else of quality in the city, it's shockingly reasonable.\n\nGreat food, personal service, grad student prices. An amazing find, which I can only selfishly hope doesn't become as popular as it deserves to be. I'll be here every week, and I'm happy to not need a reservation.", "author": "Stephen M."}

That's what I kept asking myself during lunch at Papitos.\n\nIn my usual fashion, I sampled of a bit of everything on my first visit. Every single thing was amazing. And if you need more proof, check out my photos.\n- Watermelon agua fresca\n- Housemade chunky guac sprinkled with queso fresco\n- Elote (corn on the cob) with mayo and rubbed in spices\n- Prawn quesadilla with jack cheese, mango salsa, avocado and red onion - this was heavenly...grilled perfectly and oozing with juicy, cheesy goodness. Served with a side of salsa and guac, it was enough to feed TWO.\n\nI'm quite fond of their salsa sampler trio, especially the tamarind one. That's not something you see (taste) every day.\n\nBut it gets better. My sister accidentally dropped her fork into her lap, leaving a big salsa stain on her dress. Our server immediately ducked behind the counter and came back with an eco-friendly stain remover, which totally worked. WOW. Who does that? Papito does.\n\nAlso, they have purse hooks hidden under the bar so we didn't have to put our stuff on the floor.

I wish there was a bit more in the salsa dishes though.  \n\nWhen our courses came out, we were very pleased.  Each dish was presented well and tasted even better.

Let me tell you, it was probably the tastiest burrito I've had yet. The burrito consisted of your typical ingredients such as spanish rice, black beans, and pico de gallo, but what took it over the top was the slight tang of the creme fraiche and the abundant servings of guacamole and monterey jack cheese all throughout. I'm also happy to report that there were good, meaty chunks of rock cod with every bite. Since everything here is organic, I didn't feel too guilty about finishing off the humongous burrito.

They preferred the fried chicken burrito.\n\n- Quesadilla + duck ($12): SO GOOD.  A fairly large quesadilla stuffed FULL of shredded duck meat, with a smattering of pickled carrots/daikon, refreshing mint, and a sweet tamarind sauce.  I really enjoyed the flavors in this dish-- perfect harmony of savory and sweet.\n\nOVERALL: It is clear dishes at Papito are composed of fresh ingredients.  I just wish they took more care in ensuring every bite has the flavor profile they are aiming for.  I think prices are fair for the food they're offering... IF all items are composed like that duck quesadilla MM and I shared.  I'd be happy to return and try other items on the menu.", "author": "Susanna W."}

Some of my other reviews are given 1 star because service and food quality go a long way with me.   To get 5 stars, I have to be very impressed!\n\nMy first visit to this place was 8/25/13.   Right off the get go, I found some of their menu items are not common for  Mexican food restaurant (duck, fried chicken, battered and fried cod).    The place is small yet cozy.  The music is not my normal choice but seemed to fit the crowd (hipster type music).  The guy who waited on us...  What a great guy to have representing this restaurant.   He was very confident in the food from this restaurant and that right there set the bar high for my expectations.\n\nThe salsa's offered were delicious.   Salsa verde, a chipotle red salsa with a little heat, and a mango salsa (in the form of a sauce however).    The drink selection is ok fare, good choice of Mexican beers (Corona to Pacifico), house made sangria, and champagne mimosas (also offered in other flavors such as raspberry or mango).\n\nMy girlfriend ordered a mushroom quesadilla and I ordered a chicken burrito.    \n\nThe unique feature to their chicken is that it's not the standard stewed chicken you'd find in most taquerias.   It's a fried chicken.  I am not sure but I believe the only beans you can get is black beans, which are very delicious and way better than re-fried or pinto.   The burrito meshed well together.  Normally I am not a fan of Pico de Gallo on my burritos because it can run the flavor of everything else.   Tomatoes have a lot of citric acid in them and can ruin a flavor just as much as Mustard can, but I digress.....   instead of Sour Cream they use Creme Fraiche for the creamy part.   Overall the burrito was well constructed and tasted delicious from start to finish!   I dabbed a little Salsa Verde on it as well but really you wouldn't have to because the burrito was great!\n\nThe mushroom quesadilla was delicious and a good choice for veggie folks.   Granted this dish is NOT vegan but it helps give choices to the many Veggie folks living here in SF.    Savory cheese with the earthy pungent taste of mushrooms!   Quite delicious.   The quesadilla itself was cooked very well.  Not like what you'd get at Chilis or Chevy's.   Very hand crafted and made with a lot of care and respect.  Not burned.   The size of the quesadilla was amazing as well!\n\nSo I have to note:  My girlfriend had a raspberry mimosa, and a bug landed in it.   The guy behind the bar gave her a brand new drink when all she asked for was a spoon to get the bug out.  Much appreciated.\n\nI also noticed that this guy was good with the hand washing after petting someone's dog outside the restaurant.   As soon as he walked back in, the hands were washed.  Having someone be dog friendly but then respect the  humans paying to eat here (and subsequently be the lifeblood of any business) speaks in volume!\n\nI also observed other gestures by the staff that go beyond what they really should do and it made me feel like I was eating in someone's home.   Very comfortable setting!\n\nI'd say my only gripe about this place is the parking.   But hey, it's SF, we should know better than to expect royalty parking ;-)\n\nWe will be back because I am intrigued by the duck!", "author": "Craig T."}

They made sure we were provided filled glasses of water which is great because Mexican food makes me very thirsty. \n\nPrices are pretty spot on. Although I can pay less for an \"authentic\" burrito this place offered fresh, organic, clean tasting food that wasn't oily, or too heavy. Parking was easy as there are plenty of spaces a bit higher up on the incline.\n\nI have my favorite taquerias here in the city when I get a craving for Mexican (which is often). But Papito offers up a version of Mexican food with a touch of their French inspiration which is not something you see everyday. Apparently their duck confit tacos are awesome. I can't vouch for that since I'm not a meat eater and I've never had but the positive reference of this dish seems be a recurring trend within Papito's reviews.\n\nThey offered a terrific selection of desserts which I was too full for.

The grilled corn is sweet, juicy, firm, and slightly browned. The Mexican mayo, cheese, and lime are creamy and tangy. The chili salt that comes on the side adds intense spicy saltiness and made this hunk of creamy corn (speared on a fork for easier eating) even more amazing. Maybe I went a little crazy with it on my second piece of corn. No regrets at all.\n\nAlso got the Carnitas De Pato taco - duck confit carnitas, homemade pickles, mint, chipotle tamarind sauce. Couldn't really taste the duck confit, it was just mostly the flavor of carnitas. They pile on the meat on these tacos but it was overall pretty bland. Next time I'd ask for it without the chopped mint on top because it was pretty strong.\n\nThe Ceviche Papito with lime marinated shrimp was decent but not amazing...it was pico de gallo, with 4 large shrimp and a few chopped up bits of mango. It comes with chips (in addition to the complimentary chip basket that they give you with three different salsas).\n\nLastly we had the Tostadas Trios - one with duck confit carnitas, one with slow cooked berkshire pork, one with sauteed shrimp? They are really tiny, so I only got one bite of each. The duck confit carnitas and slow cooked berkshire pork tasted very similar (porky).\n\nThe ingredients are fresh and organic, and our server was very engaged. I want to come back to try the quesadillas...they looked really good, especially the one with  sauteed wild mushrooms, huitlacoche garlic, epazote, guajillo pepper, and oaxacan cheese...the enchiladas...and more of that delicious ELOTE ASADA.", "author": "Jessica C."}

Upon entering I was greeted by enthusiastic charming wait-staff - who quickly made sure I had a seat, a big glass of ice-water, and a menu in front of me.\n\nI ordered a veggie burrito with avocado and mushrooms to go.\n\nWhile waiting for my order, I scanned Papito's menu quickly. Their selection is impressive. All of their cuisine is organic and their dishes are inventive and unique. With a slew of dishes - that breathe life into fresh vegetables and wondrous meat dishes - through seasonings, marinades, and sauces - I wished that I had more time and people to share the wealth of flavorful dishes, that Christina C - alludes to - in her review - http://www.yelp.com/biz/papito-san-francisco#hrid:i5-tfkNvreALsjeI-N_2Xw. \n\nIn a matter of minutes I was carrying my heavy bundle of a beautiful burrito down a rain washed decline - back to Thee Parkside.\n\nI tore into it right away. A scrumptious medley of vegetables, bundled tightly together in a hot tortilla. There was just the right ratio of beans and rice - to compliment the vegetables.  What I truly adored about my brown bag of goodies - was the three different sauces which they included with my burrito. A hot spicy orange sauce with a punch, a light fruity sauce, and a green - slightly tart sauce. Drizzled over my burrito - they completed each bite perfectly.\n\nMy burrito yesterday - wasn't exactly the best burrito I've ever had. Papito does't claim that victory. But it was delectable and gratifying. It tasted healthy and just made. And though pricier - than your average burrito - the ingredients in it - reflected Papito's mission to bring quality to each of their dishes.\n\nIf you're in the area -and looking for an hospitable spot with fresh Mexican fare with a twist-  Papito is it.\n\nTrust.", "author": "Jessica T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-04-14", "description": "In an attempt to extend their \"Chez\" French empire around the block, it appears that the French have invaded Mexico again. This tiny space is a crass attempt to cash in on the taco/quesadilla craze and after-work margarita crowd who don't really want a full meal, just the small plates. But looks and tastes are deceiving, since the food is neither really Mexican or really anything.\n\n\"Duck confit carnitas\" are the cynical draw for most here, and it's a terrible concoction. Duck is simply too fatty and gamey to be rendered in the same way you would a pork butt for carnitas. It also doesn't seem to mix well with the not-homemade corn tortillas, although their provenance (La Palma across town) is admirable. The dish ends up tasting much too intense and vinegary, since they also added homemade pickle slices. It's not that I object to cross-cultural fertilization; it's just that this feels imposed to be able get a mention in Saveur magazine, or else the French can't leave well enough alone. When's the last time the staff who's really doing the cooking had duck on their menus at home?\n\nThe biggest problem I had with Papito was the underseasoned sauces ---from the trio of unremarkable salsas (with chips) to the sauces that accompany the various fillings. My pastor (pork) tacos were not just cold, but they didn't really have anything distinctive. The grilled pineapple slices were OK, but the rest of sauce where the pork was braised just didn't have any salt. My friend's quesadillas, the Papito, were marinated shrimp, but the protein was rubbery, a sure sign they were overcooked. The sauces they were served in didn't add anything, but the zig zag sour cream drizzles on top of the triangles of tortillas on the dish could have been served at any El Torito corporate location.\n\nAlso, why serve margaritas, if there is no tequila? I'm just wondering. We stuck with the Negro Modelos, which get tossed on the table as if they're mad at you. We didn't appreciate the aggressive, brusque service ---we believe, the same surly French guy who takes orders at Chez Maman, the -8 stool place around the corner. Must be the same owner. In any case, when he is yelling loudly in French at his staff, and as his surlier Spanish speaking staff is using expletives to talk about this or that, well, you know you're in for a typical meal at Papito. I'm still waiting for Mamacita to open up to extend these trite restaurant names --oh wait, there is a Mamacita. And it's much better than this literal hole in the wall.\n\nFinally ---two tacos, one quesadilla, an overly sweet Watermelon agua fresca and 2 beers: $35. Ouch.", "author": "Alfonso L."}

As the tables were full, we sat at the counter,  but it was perfectly enjoyable.  Our service was quick , casual and friendly.  \n\nWe started with the fried calamari, which was some of the best we've ever had.  You know when the calamari you ordered tastes...old?  Like it was fried much earlier in the day and then reheated in an oven?  This calamari was the exact opposite:  it was very fresh and the coating was crisp- nothing soggy, chewy or old tasting about it.  Also, it was mixed with batter dipped and deep fried jalapenos (no heat to them, so I could enjoy them), carrots, and red and green bell peppers- really delicious and sort of like a Mexican tempura.\n\nMy husband and I are big burrito fans- in fact the reason we came to Papito's in the first place was to get a good shrimp burrito.  This is what I had, while my husband had the chorizo burrito.  Neither of us were disappointed; in fact, even though I can eat a lot of men under the table (umm, that did not come out right!), I had to take half of my burrito home, as I was already pretty full from sharing the calamari.\n\nOne really nice point about the burritos- I don't believe that they were steamed as they are at some places.  After all the ingredients were put together, the cooks must have \"sealed\" the burritos by putting them back on the grill for a minute, which created a nicely crisped seam in the tortilla shell that was just delightful.\n\nAll in all a great casual dining experience.

Well, if you aren't, imagine being made to feel like your presence is neither wanted nor do you deserve to have the food provided in the place you happened to have chosen as your destination for what will hopefully be good food. If you remember the \"YOU GET NO SOUP!\" guy, you know exactly what I'm talking about. I picked this placed based on what I remembered to be pretty decent food. I arrived there with my boyfriend who had never been there before. We sat down to order our food and were immediately greeted and given water by our server. Too bad this gentleman wasn't our waiter because the gentleman who attempted to fill this role was nothing short of rude. When asked what we'd like to order for starters, we decided on the chorizo queso. The waiter (aka YOU GET NO SOUP!) guy quickly quipped, \"Why don't you order the guacamole. Anything else on the menu will take a long time. I'm just warning you.\" He then quipped, \"You probably should just order everything together so the cooks will know what they need to do\". \n\nQue? Ok, we had no idea what that even meant but we still placed our order for the queso hoping that \"a long time\" meant 5 or 10 minutes. By the way, there were only four people in the restaurant including us and the other two had asked for their check. We pondered the awkward menu for a few minutes deciding on our main course. I use the term awkward due to the menus placement underneath the glass of the table. Add chips, salsa and drinks to your table and good luck even seeing the thing. \n\nAfter deciding on potential main courses we politely asked the waiter for his thoughts. His answer was muddled and incoherent at best. We had no idea what the guy was even saying. However, it was VERY apparent based on his tone and body language that it was pointless to expect anything more than awful service from him. With that duly noted, we exited stage left never even taking a bite of we'd hoped would be delicious queso. \n\nAu Revior Papito!!!! We'll see you again NEVER!", "author": "H P."}

It makes the experience better.\n\nReservations / Wait?   \nI've only been on weekday nights, never made a reservation, and never had to wait.

We order some food for pick up.  They were really nice on the phone.  I drove to the restaurant and parked right in front - so my headlights were bright and they were low.  The folks sitting there were put off my lights were shining at their feet so some asshole flicks his cigarette on the hood of my car (not a finished off one, it was only half smoked so this guy was definitely pissed off).  I turn my lights off simultaneously as this happens because I didn't want to blind their feet.  Then I felt bad and backed my car out and waited on the side.  We walk in and he (the guy that flicked his cigarette) immediately told us it was closed and to leave rudely.  We ordered over the phone!  We let him know and I saw a light bulb go off in his head.  \n\nWe were nice the whole time.  So just because you work there, 4 wine glasses deep (you were holding them, obviously drinking on the job), it doesn't give you the right to flick a burning cigarette at my car.  \n\nThey were just rude in person.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-10-27", "description": "I truly don't understand how this place has such a high rating. I've eaten here once, although I tried to do take-out one other time.\n\nHow does one \"try\" to do take-out? Let me explain. The Potrero location is about half a mile a way. So after a long day of schlepping dirt into my yard for my new vegetable garden, the last thing I wanted to do with my manure-smelling self was cook. The lady and I were craving Mexican and had eaten Papito's once before (I'll get to that later). I called to place my order. Someone picked up after one ring. A good sign? Nope. The dude on the other end says something indecipherable, which I understood at the time to mean he was going to put me on hold. I say, \"Okay\". He puts me on hold for about 4 seconds and then I get disconnected. Thinking that this was a genuine mistake, I call again. This time I am actually able to hear him as he quickly states that they're busy and asks if I can call back in 5 to 10 minutes. Okay, there was a football/baseball/basketball thing going on in town. I don't sports, so I don't know or care. I have however worked in the service industry and know what it's like to be slammed on a game day. Still, I've never been asked to call back to place an order, especially for pick-up. I'm not even asking you to come to my house man, so how about just scratch my order onto whatever beer-soaked napkin is nearby and put it in the flipping POS system. Sheesh.\n\nI call back 10 minutes later. The background noise on the other end sounds somewhat softer which I take to mean they will now be able to handle taking my order. I ask for chips and guac. Fine. I ask for two super burritos, one veggie and one braised beef. Okay. I ask him for no mushrooms on the veggie burrito. Not okay. The lug head on the other end of the line says, \"It's all mixed in. We can't take anything out.\" Seriously? What you just said implies that you can't accommodate anyone with a food allergy and that your little shtick about being freshly-prepared is probably a super duper burrito sized load of crap. To this I reply, \"That's interesting, because I've ordered that exact thing before and had no problem. Your customer service is shit. Goodbye.\"\n\nThis brings me to my first trip to Papito's. An out of town friend was visiting and after a night out in the Mission we were all craving a hangover cure of the bean and cheese variety. So up the hill we go. It was a Monday and a little after the lunch rush. We were able to sit down immediately and everything started out fine and dandy. That's when I noticed the sign-up sheet taped to the outside door. It had several names that had not been crossed off and it was clearly remnant from a much busier weekend shift. Yet, no names were crossed off and no one had bothered to take it down. Not a particularly good sign, but I brushed it off as being part of the charm. \n\nWe place our orders. The chips and huac come out pretty quick. The drinks not as quickly. A few minutes later a couple behind us who had arrived after us get their food. Okay... Despite the fact that I've eaten my weight in fried corn, I still want my damn burrito. Finally, about 20 minutes after we ordered our food, the waiter comes to our table and says that the POS system wasn't working and our order didn't go through. Oh, and he forgot what we had ordered because he didn't actually write it down. Interesting that you didn't write down our order at the very same time that the POS system stops working. And yet this didn't effect the other diners around us. Cool story. So we order again, and I'm thinking this food should be coming out on the fly. Nope, wrong again. We wait another 15 minutes until the food finally arrives and the waiter tells us the drinks are on him. Great! A free iced tea for a total time-suck of a meal. At least they were able to give me food without mushrooms. \n\nThe take-away: If you have a solid two or three hours to blow, are willing to spend $12 on a decent burrito, and you don't give a crap about customer service, this place is for you. Personally, if I'm going to spend my money on decent food, I'll just take it around the corner to Goat Hill Pizza, who deliver. On time. And it tastes delicious.", "author": "Emily B."}

The one French guy who is a little older is ok to deal with - he is just inattentive and slow. The younger one with the really thick accent is obnoxious and always trying to be funny but it ends up being obnoxious. Last night we were there and we waited (no exaggeration) for 35 minutes for our check while other people were standing around outside waiting to get a table.  They could have already turned over a table and fed a whole new couple by that point!  What a waste of money for them and a waste of our time.  They are always short staffed here in the evenings.  If you have to, get the tacos or quesadillas.  Maybe not the shrimp tacos - they only give you 2-3 tiny shrimp...literally.  The last 5 or 6 times I got the entrees, they were terrible. The carnitas was so dry.  The steak fajitas were overcooked in this syrupy mucky goo.  Ugh, it was awful.  I can't believe this place is run by the same guys that own Chez Papa and Chez Maman.

Our server was very impatient - she asked us multiple times if we were ready to order, slammed plates down on the table (...two of which were also dirty), snapped at us for taking up too much space in the aisle (they set the layout of the restaurant, not us), and generally gave us the impression that she wanted us to get in and out of the restaurant as soon as possible (again - the restaurant wasn't full and no one was waiting outside).  As for the food, I ordered a burrito whose wrap was partially undercooked (the undercooked portions were hard and inedible).  On the plus side, the bottled Modelo Especial I had was excellent.\n\nBased on other Yelpers' reviews, it looks like my experience was probably an anomaly (and I should note that the French owner was very friendly to us when we left, almost the complete opposite of our server), but I won't be back.", "author": "Rishi N."}

Similar to most of the new-ish Mexican restaurants in SF (Nopalito, I'm talking to you...), Papito serves up unique, complex, and ultimately tasty food.

Introduced to this very unpretentious diner by way of my daughter (one of the many pluses of visiting her in the city!).   This establishment had good food and great service.  Our waiter was very attentive and cordial.  For appetizer I ordered and shared the crab cakes.  It was ok, probably would have preferred a bolder \"crab\" flavor and maybe less fillers mixed with the crab.  For the entree we had shrimp enchilada (loaded with mild yet smooth cheesy sauce and perfectly cooked shrimp with a bed of sliced lettuce and radish). I sampled a bite of the shrimp from my daughter and thought it was pretty good, eaten together with the lettuce and radish.  I ordered the flat iron steak entree which was good. The side sauce punched up the flavor. Served with black beans and spanish rice, I'd say overall it was tasty.  Best part was the dessert! Chocolate lava cake and flan. Both served with a dollop of marscapone.  Very rich and not for the faint of heart.  The mango margherita strong and delish! Would recommend anyone to try....", "author": "Renee T."}

[Cue the mariachi band.] After what was already a great summer solstice night celebrated with two tacos and a beer (and a certain local news anchor sighting), it seemed like there was no better ending than a surprise tequila shot to close the night. But I digress...\n\nPapito is known as an organic Mexican bistro restaurant. The ingredients are fresh, made perfectly juicy and not overly priced like some similar restaurants in other parts of town. Generally, I order the burrito to go and scarf it at home. But, as it turns out, just having the food is half the experience at this lovely restaurant. \n\nThe restaurant is fairly small so whenever you can sit outside on a gorgeous day and enjoy the view, the neighborhood and the food is ideal. \n\nI had the bajataco (rock cod fish) taco--which is what I call \"party in my mouth\"--you know, when a lot of flavors hit you all at once in an amazing way. This was by far my favorite. \n\nThe second one I had was the fried chicken taco, which was less exciting, perhaps so because the fried chicken was too dense for the taco itself. \n\nUsually, though, I have the grilled shrimp burrito--which, to me stands out because the shrimp is so plump and juicy.

Got the guacamole and it was still a small serving in my opinion (enough for two people) but it was outstanding, almost as good as my mother-in-law's.  Had a Pacifico, which was ice cold and reasonably priced at $4.  And had a super burrito that was super: tasted terrific, with lots of different flavors, textures and a slightly crisped tortilla.  It seemed like a deal at less than $10.\n\nIf I had gotten everything to go, my rating would be solidly 4+ Stars.  But I didn't and I was subjected to a loud staff argument that went on nearly the entire time we were there.  Seriously, the staff was sitting at the table in the middle of the restaurant (right in front of the door), arguing loudly about \"I never said I'd work this night so I'm not responsible because he texted me and asked me to work for him\" and a lot of other things along the same line.  Then the kitchen staff was blaring out expletives in Spanish most of the time we were there.  Some non-Latinos actually understand a little Spanish and do I need to be hearing puta-this and puta-that and pendejo and a lot of other stuff being spoken out above all the kitchen noise.  Not really.\n\nI've struggled with how to write this review but it ultimately it came down to enjoyment.  I think diners shouldn't be subjected to loud upset staff and when the kitchen is open to the dining area and about as big as the dining area, they need to tone it down a bit.  I cuss all the time, but not at work an d not constantly and usually not so people who aren't with me can hear (exception: driving).  And I appreciate that there there can be misunderstandings about things, but do I need to hear about scheduling problems at elevated volumes for most of my 30 minute dining experience.  Not really.\n\nI will be back, most likely for takeout.  The food is excellent, creative and quite satisfying.  The Potrero French Connection really knows food (Chez Maman, Chez Papa, Papito) and they have a cute naming approproach.  The people are also nice, so I'll chalk this up to a bad moment to be there, but that's what I'm reviewing: the dining experience I had yesterday evening.", "author": "Kevin M."}

After 20-30 minutes, we were sitting there w/ a half eaten appetizer wondering if they have forgotten about our entrees.. then it totally hit us, the waiter was waiting for us to finish our app, and never once rushed us - this is why I say it's surprisingly amazing!

The burritos are outstanding and have unique salsa and flavorings depending on the meat.  I'm a big fan of the duck confit and fried chicken burritos.  The only meat I don't really like is their Chorizo, which is oily as hell.  If you are hung over or sick I recommend the Posole, which is only served on weekends. Their vegetarian options are plentiful, and unlike most taquerias, their veggie burritos are filled with an assortment of well-cooked and seasoned vegetables- much more interesting than the standard regular burrito minus the meat.  \n\nIts a tiny space with a small, busy staff, so calling in orders ahead can be challenging.

While I appreciate their dedication to organic ingredients and their different combinations, I think it lacks the soul that real down to earth Mexican food has. \n\nTheir menu is quite interesting and I would be motivated to come by and try their other offerings. But it might take me a little while to get over the price.", "author": "Jeffrey J."}

Delicious!\n\nI wouldn't call them \"Mexican,\" though.  Mexican-inspired, but with a fusion/French twist.  \n\nThe second-best thing about this restaurant is fast, friendly service.  The staff seem to be genuinely glad you're there and happy for your business.  I can't even say how much good service means to me.\n\nA few small downsides: 1) portions are pretty small.  2) prices are not accordingly small.  3) the restaurant itself is REALLY small.  \n\nNo, I'm serious.  (3) is actually a big problem.  As I sat in their restaurant and tried to use my knife, my elbow was basically in the face of the guy at the next table.  And there wasn't a polite way for me to rearrange without breaking my arm.

Just had lunch and, well, I guess I'm going to keep driving.\n\nAs others mentioned, it's more of an upscale Mexican/French-ish affair, but the execution is pretty weak.  IMHO, if you're going to upscale a cuisine, do it well before you try to integrate other cuisines.\n\nI ordered the duck confit quesadilla ($11). I visualized as a gooey thing broken up with bits of crispy duck leg.  I ended up with a decent-size flour tortilla filled with a bit of cheese, dry duck leg (with zero crispy skin), a ridiculous amount of pickled and waaaay too sweet jicama/carrots.  By the third bite, I was bored with it and the weirdly flavored (some herbs) pickled vegetables overwhelmed what was there.  Maybe that much would make sense in a fatty Banh Mi, but not in a dry quesadilla.  On the side were a ramekin of pico de gallo and guacamole that didn't help anything and (this irritates me) the guacamole was of the type that is made way ahead of time, doused in a huge amount of lime juice so it doesn't oxidize, and ends up tasting like sour green paste.  If you're charging $11 for a quesadilla (and $10 for a burrito), spend the 30 seconds to have guacamole somewhat fresh.\n\nOther person had a burrito filled with same pickled vegetables and tortilla chips that tasted like Tostitos (they weren't, but they had that coarse yellow corn taste).\n\nSodas are $3.  C'mon.  Lunch for 2 with tip: $36.\n\nI was going to give it three stars because it wasn't really bad per se and the portions were fine, but then I thought: would I ever come back here again?

Waitress repeats (in uninterested french accent) after each item I pronounced ... \"Duck\" ...\"Chicken\" ... \"Shrimp\" ...\"Fish\".\nIf you're going to go through the trouble to lovingly name and describe your items on the menu, don't degrade the experience by repeating what I said like some pissed off short order waitress in a diner.\n\n* Sangria was dry. That's fine. But it was really dry. Not refreshing or sweet enough. Tasted like wine where someone had accidentally dropped a piece of fruit in it.\n\n* Another wait staff came by and asked us (we did not ask) if we wanted more chips. We said yes, cheerily, never to see him again.\n\n* 4 tacos came. Pretty tasty. Nothing extraordinary, but we enjoyed them. The \"Duck\" tasted a bit more like overstewed pot roast, though. Listen, Duck is a delicate thing. It can be gross more often than not. If you're going to make it, treat it with some respect. Serve it delicately. \n\n* Check came.

I think in general what makes this place good is the fresh authentic taste to all their dishes, and the flavors just pop.  Simple items like good cheese and prep can make any dish good, and they take the time to do it.

Who doesn't want a chic/tasty go-to Mexican restaurant where you can dine or dash?! \n\nWell, shortly after it opened my husband and I went to give it a go. First I was offered sour white wine (the server even admitted it was old!) that tasted horrible. I was quick to judge but instead labeled him as lazy since (he had to run to their sister restaurant to pick-up some additional bottles). \n\nWe ordered the soup - which wasn't bad but wasn't amazing. I ordered the tofu tacos and my husband ordered a burrito. I was SO pissed when my street tacos came and there were MAYBE two of the smallest pieces of tofu I've ever seen in both. Not only that. but the tofu was prepared horribly and was a bit chewy and tasteless - well, hard to taste being that they were so small. I was confused why they'd even offer a tofu taco if that was how they'd serve it. It tasted and looked like a lame attempt to appease vegetarians - they failed! \n\nAdditionally, the tacos had hardly anything on them - I basically ate a small corn tortilla with cabbage and sauce. I was so upset that our bill was comparable to a nice restaurant that I vowed never to dine there again OR recommend it. \n\nNow, my husband's burrito got quite a bit attention - and not in a good way. He chowed it down but agreed the quality wasn't worth the $13 bucks or whatever. He had a nice little reminder early the next morning when he sat on the porcelain throne revisiting the memory of his meal from the night before. \n\nGross right?!

But i guess that's normal in potrero hill. Anyways, Papito was not a bad choice. The place is small but that attribute translates into quick and very personal service. \n\nI was in health-mode mood so i decided on two of their entr\u00e9es: the guacamole and the shrimp  ceviche. The order came with chips and three style of salsas, which i thought were very good. However, I think they would've been complimented far better with small warm corn tortillas.  The Guacamole was very good and it comes with huge chunks of avocado in it - enough to heavily consider it a meal. \n\nThe ceviche, or to me, the main dish, comes with prawn-sized shrimp, mangoes, onions and some other good stuff. Which brings me down to the 3-stars. Although this is probably my own fault - everything was excellent, the ceviche was just plainly too salty. The saltiness was enhanced by the corn chips which were also salty. Perhaps if i would've ordered something else to offset the saltiness, I would've had a better experience. But salt with salt always equals too much salt. I also believe ceviche should be marinated and cooked with lime. This is probably how this was made, but the yummy lime flavors you come to expect from ceviche were nowhere to be found, which was a bummer. I think my expectations of ceviche are way high here, so i apologize for being bias about the taste.\n\nOn another positive note, the bathroom was very clean. In my opinion, the bathroom experience always extends to the kitchen and the overall cleanliness of the establishment. :) \n\nBesides the mediocre ceviche experience, I will definitely be coming back to try their many other dishes.", "author": "Rob M."}

One of my first dates with my boyfriend of several years was here and we had a great time. It was on a slower night and the gentleman working was very attentive and charming. \n\nThe bad review is because the last several times we have tried to eat here have been a customer service disaster. About one month ago we called for Carry-out because the food is good, but the service had been lacking and it can be a long wait since it is so small. The answering machine picked up and literally says \"We are too busy to talk to you.\" That was very off-putting so we ate somewhere else. You'd think at a small restaurant that they would be eager to do carry-out orders because they still make the money, while not having to have space for you. \n\nLast week we tried to go eat there and put our name on the list and waited outside. Another couple showed up and took a table outside. Three tables outside were open. At this point there was no one else waiting for a table and we didn't want to eat outside because it was chilly. The manager (the French guy) came out and rudely told them to stand up and wait for their turn. He told them to put their name on the list. They looked very confused and annoyed. No one else was waiting. They put their name on the list, then he sat them back down at the table and crossed their name off. They looked like they were about to get up and leave because of how ridiculous that was, but ended up staying and ordering. I understand and appreciate first come, first serve, but there was only our name on the list so far and three open tables...If we wanted to sit outside we would have and a list wouldn't have existed yet.\n\nA few more people came and added their name to the list under ours. Some bar seats opened up. About ten minuetes went by and no one came out to seat the empty space, so my boyfriend and I wiped our name off the list and sat down. The manager (who had seen us waiting outside and knew our name was at the top of the list becuase of the outdoor seating fiasco) rudely told us to wait outside because there was a list. We explained that we were at the top of the list. The manager rolled his eyes and went outside and said our name wasn't on the list. The peole outside said we were first. The manager made a snide remark about us lying about having had our name on the list. So, we left. That was the last straw for us. On the way out the manager grabbed my boyfriend's arm and tried to make us stay in a desperate attempt, because he knew he was in the wrong. We left and ate at Goat Hill. Never going to Papitos again.\n\nIt's so sad. The food is good. The customer service is getting worse and worse.", "author": "SF R."}

As such, it shares a number of characteristics with some of its neighbors: smaller portions, cramped setting, higher prices. But, you'll also get some friendly service and some delicious bites that will challenge and enthrall you.\n\nPapito does Mexican, from standard (including tacos, burritos, quesadillas) to some more exotic tapas, including queso fundito, a delicious baked cheese and chile dish, shrimp ceviche, roasted corn with cheese, black beans with or without beef chorizo, etc. \n\nWe had those tapas last night, which were all reminiscent of homey peasant-style food one might expect in Oaxaca, but at San Francisco prices. However, since we don't know any Oaxacan peasants, we'll be continuing to go to Papito for this kind of delicious chow. Also, they're open late!", "author": "Tom S."}

Unfortunately I was not able to eat anything. I have a good allergy to onions. When I eat them I get really sick, not dying sick but miserable sick. I scoured the menu for options with no onions. When I found one that looked promising I asked the waiter if it had onions. He said no. I then asked him if the salsa in the dish had onions. He said he didn't think so but he would check. He came back and let me know that the salsa had onions but he could take it out. In the meantime we ordered some guacamole (no onions mentioned on the menu) it arrived and was full of onions with onions on top as a garnish. I just waited for my meal and let my date eat the guacamole. When my food arrived it had a pile of fresh cut onions on top. From the side I could see that I was also full of onions. I asked the server if he could alert my waiter. When the waiter (a different one) arrived I told him that I was allergic to onions and could not eat the dish. He told my server to just take them off the top. I told him that would not work and that the dish was also full of onions. He was then extremely rude asking me me what I wanted and that it was a Mexican restaurant so of course onions are in everything. He told me to order something else from the menu but I asked him if he could tell me what did not have onions. He pointed out a number of dishes with onions on the description. I pointed that out to him and he basically yelled at me that he could take them out. I said no thank you and that we would just take the check. My date asked for a box (and here is the worst part!) the waiter yelled at the server to get us a box \"vamonos!\" he said and clapped at the server (who was a Spanish speaker and extremely nice). In the end we were not charged for any food which was nice and why I gave any stars at all. In future I recommend listening to your customers, if you can not provide what they area asking for, say so.

It was a Saturday afternoon, so they were offering their brunch menu....but they were nice enough to make us the queso even though it wasn't on the brunch menu. We were very appreciative of them accommodating our request. They also brought my dog a bowl of water without me even having to ask. The guacamole was nice and fresh, along with the chips and complimentary trio of salsas. I ordered fried chicken quesadillas and my hubby tried the fish burrito. I think this is the first time I've seen fried chicken as an option for tacos or quesadillas. The quesadillas weren't my fave...they were filled with a little too much spicy sauce, and usually love spicy foods. That's okay though. My hubby really enjoyed the fish burrito. Maybe I'll try that next time. Aside from the friendly service, we really liked the location. It's nothing fancy, but we never realized Potrero Hill was a fun spot to \"hit up.\" There are actually a bunch of restaurants right around Papitos.", "author": "Kelsey K."}

I mean, you can't get duck confit or tempura shrimp from a traditional Mexican taqueria, and all meats are the same price at Papito so if you want to get more bang for your buck, order a seafood or duck dish!  Also, their prices are slightly different than what is posted online -- yesterday (Saturday) night, it was 2 tacos for $8, a regular burrito for $7, a super burrito for $9, and a quesadilla for $10.  I ordered the duck burrito and it was delicious, the duck just melts in your mouth... mmm...  Moreover, the portions were surprisingly large for a semi-French place -- my regular burrito was about 3/4 the size of a regular Cancun burrito, and was actually even larger than a regular burrito from Pancho Villa.  Oh, and another thing to note -- they serve each table a trio of sauces: spicy, mango, and avocado, and the avocado sauce is delicious!!  And the service is great too!  I asked for some tamarind sauce in my duck burrito (according to the menu it is only served with the duck in quesadilla, not burrito, form), and when the bill arrived I realized they didn't even charge me extra for it!  Lastly, when we were finished, a guy (I'm guessing the owner) came by to ask how we enjoyed our meal.  I will definitely be back!", "author": "Beatrice W."}

Papito part duex or dos depending on if you're going off the owners or genre. \n\nI ordered the duck confit burrito and grilled corn. And was pleasantly surprised with how light the confit actually was. Typically you expect most duck dishes to be quite heavy but the flavors in this burrito were balanced, however, I could have done without the pickled veggies in this dish because of the potential of the vinegar overwhelming the flavor of the duck. The corn was also very nice, great creamy spice flavor from the mexi-mayo. I feel that a lot of new restaus these days are going for smaller portions with bold flavors that aren't gut bombs (eg heavy) and it's particularly true at Papito. Truly great clean food with good flavor, but you leave satiated not full. Service is also quite pleasant. \n\nMy only complaint is price... but I understand, good ingredients cost money.

Ok, you get the idea.  Although being Mexican does not mean I know everything about mexican food, I think that at my 48 years of age I should be good at knowing and sometimes crudely comparing taquerias and mexican restaurants around the Bay Area.  \nSo, last Wednesday around 5:30 pm, I passed by this cute place and I thought, \"one more taqueria\".  \"Papito\" as a name seemed absurd to me, but what caught my eye was the word \"organic\". stopped and read the menu and the \"Champi\u00f1ones quesadilla\" called me. \nThe place was half empty,  I went in and immediately loved the small but nicely decorated warm place. I sat at the left side of the bar to get a sight of the action in the kitchen.  I got my hot quesadilla and loved the rich flavors of different mashrooms, queso Oaxaca and epazote. The three salsas are very, VERY good! One rule of thumb, my mom would say, is; a place who has good salsas and good spanish rice is worth your money. The price I think was a little on the expensive side, but I thought the food was excellent so let's live it at that.\n\nI told my partner about my new favorite restaurant and next day I passed the word to all my coworkers as well. \nMy partner, another more demanding palate than mine, picked me up from work next day and head to Papito around 8:20 pm.  The place was packed but we didn't have to wait long to get sited.  This time I decided to try the \"Enmolada' a braised chicken, oaxacan mole, cr\u00e8me fraiche, monterey jack cheese, black beans, spanish rice, pickled red onion platter.  My partner went for the \"Champi\u00f1ones quesadilla\".\nTo my total disappontment, the flavor of the mole was just acceptable, the tortillas were hard to cut and the chiquen was dry and stringy. The rice was also dry and really not exceptional at all... My partner was contempt with his quezadilla, wich I was at least happy to hear.\nThe three stars I gave might be tough to take, but If your business has a Michelline recomendation, It better step up all the time, when is half empty or completely full.  So for this reason should you come to eat at Papitos only when is half empty? It's your decision.", "author": "David G."}

Just a gloppy. slurpy, slippery, tasteless paste. I reveal my prejudice when I say that I prefer my guacamole to be chunky but I can get over that if it is deliciously flavored. This was not and frankly, the guac is an acid test for any Mexican restaurant because it is so easily prepared; almost hard to ruin. But Papitos did. I will try again as I have long waited for a taqueria to come my Hill. \n\nStep it up, Papito. You guys are better than this.", "author": "Lynka A."}

So Off to Papito's we went.\n\nCame up from the mid-peninsula...was easy to find, right off of 280N.....and waa laa...there was parking all over the place.  WOW!!!  This has to be a good sign?\n\nYes...it was a great sign...because all four of us thoroughly enjoyed lunch at Papito's.\n\n3 of us had the taco dishes...although a variety of different ones.  I had the pork and the fried chicken tacos.  WOW....they were both great, but the Fried Chicken taco was SUPERB!!!!  I can't forget to mention that we had the guacamole and grilled corn as appetizers.  The guac was great....very fresh and tasty.....but let me tell ya....the Grilled Corn....WOW!!!  We ordered one small dish of the corn...which normally has two pieces....our waiter was great and took it upon himself to bring it cut into 4 pieces instead.  Even my daughter who doesn't like corn on the cob...absolutely loved it.  WOW!!!\n\nSo.....we will be back.  This is a great place....food was superb.and the service was excellent.  It's small....but we were there on a weekday around 1:30pm...and there was no problem getting a table.\n\nThis is a nice area with several other good restaurant choices nearby in case Papito's is packed.\n\nThanks!!  A great lunch!", "author": "K F."}

I find it hard to understand how some people can rave about this place.\n \nIt is extremely OVERPRICED, has ridicuously SMALL PORTIONS, and the food itself is BLAND AND TASTELESS - and all those fancy toppings mentioned  in such detail in the menu are NOWHERE to be found on the food! \n\n$7 for a regular burrito that in fact was the size of what every other place calls a \"Baby Burrito\" and should sell for about $4.50. The bulk of the burritto was taken up by the 2 ends of chewy, mushy rolled up Tortilla....and the FLAVOR was MISSING IN ACTION. The two bites of meat in mine were average in taste (certainly not as good as my fav mexican spots), the 6 or 7 black beans in it seemed lonely and confused as they wondered where all their brothers and sisters had disappeared to, and the Spanish Rice must have had a dispute with the French owners and run away, because it was simply non-existant.  \n\nTwo Tacos for $8 - small street tacos that should sell for about $4 bucks max. We had the Duck, which I had to try because that's the one I heard everyone talking about, which turned out to be some sort of stewed mystery meat that tasted sort of like pork, but not quite.  No rice or beans at all, and once again, where were all those exotic sounding toppings? All I could discern were a few limp shavings of red cabbage.\n\n3 small plastic containers with a stingy bare bit in the bottom of each\none that contained some thin runny faux surrogates for real salsa.\n\nA very small cardboard carton of chips that were on a par to what you can buy in a big bag on sale at the grocery store.\n\nOh well - at least we are still gifted with lots of places in SF for great, inexpensive and authentic mexican food.  I'd advise you don't waste your money at this place and go patronize them.", "author": "Auntie M."}

Today I stopped in for a late lunch. There are about 6 two top tables inside with an additional 6-8 seats at the bar and 4 additional tables out front.  The decor is very bright and happy in Lime and Yellows with copper accents. I ordered the two tacos for 8$ (one bajataco and one chorizo) and a Mexican Coca-Cola.  I was going to order the carnitas but unfortunately the were out of that and the duck (it was a late lunch so I can't fault them especially on their first week). The fish taco was AMAZING.  The flavors were a true delight on my tongue. I think I could eat them everyday. The chorizo wasn't bad, but after being wowed by the fish taco, the chorizo didn't stand a chance.   The food from my first experience gets a 5. The area needed a good taqueria. I cant speak to the noise level as there were only about 6 people inside while I was eating. It's hard surfaces so I would assume when it fills up, it's going to get a little hard to hear as the tables are less than 6\" away from one another.  The reason I gave it 4 stars, for my two tacos and bottle of Mexican Coca-Cola was just shy of $13. After tip it's over 15$.  You are getting table service and the food is better than a standard taqueria but the prices seem just a bit on the hefty side. \nAll said, you should definitely check it out.", "author": "Scott S."}

After two attempts at that, and 30 min of waiting each time, I will be calling in my orders from now on. Also there is someone there that orders duck and a glass of wine.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-11-22", "description": "\"Woohoo!  As good as it gets!\"\n\nI love this place.  I came here twice in two days;  the first time with my g/f to kill an hour before a show at Bottom of the Hill, and then two days later to celebrate her bro's bday.\n\nBasics first:  they have street parking, room for maybe 20-24 customers indoors (7 at the bar,  six 2-person tables that can be pushed together).  There are 3-4 outdoor tables.  Beer and wine for sure, an agave tequila, and I don't know if there's more alcohol beyond that. \n\nMy first visit was on a Friday night.  We were looking for a quick bite.  The place was packed, but it had good energy: lively convo, orange and red interiors with the rainy dark outside had everyone in the place very happy to be indoors.  There weren't seats immediately available, so we gladly stood inside and sipped on Sangria to get us started.  That was delicious!  I've never heard of white sangria, so we had the red (we had the white on Sunday night).   Very yummy, and dangerous if you like sweet and don't pay attention.\n \nWhen a table finally opened up 10 minutes later, we order tacos:  the Carnitas de Pato (duck confit carnitas, pickles, mint, tamarind sauce) and Pollo Empanizado (breaded fried chicken, chipotle remoulade, salsa roja, guacamole, pico de gallo, purple cabbage slaw, cr\u00e8me fraiche).  So, so, so tasty, especially the cr\u00e8me fraiche.  Two tacos run for $8.00/which I think were well worth the value for the flavors involved.  My girlfriend got the (Chicken) Enchiladas Rojas (three? enchiladas, red sauce, cr\u00e8me fraiche, cheese.  Those come in pork, too.  I didn't think those were as good for the $13.\n\nWe also got guacamole and chips.  The guac was delicious, came out very fast, and beautifully presented.   In fact, all of our food came out within 5 minutes of ordering.  Because the interior is so intimate, they were good about attending to our table without hovering or coming back too often.\n\nOn our Sunday trip, our party had five to start, and two more arrived an hour later.  They did a great job of juggling our needs (7 people sitting together) while juggling theirs.   The food was as excellent as the Friday before,  and they were super, super cheerful the whole time without making us rushed or embarrassed to take up the whole bar.\n\n* * *\nGo there if you're down for some Mexican cuisine that isn't just a super burrito (which they do have, BTW) in a classy environment that you doesn't require you to be classy.  If you're willing to try new combinations (tamarind, pineapple, duck), you'll be in for a treat.  And if you like a staff that is cheerful and remembers you, you'll definitely have a good time. \n\nI'll be back for sure.", "author": "Chris G."}

That restaurant, amigos, is Papito. \n\nUnfortunately, this lovely thing called Yelp does not allow one to give negative stars. Because this sh*thole would get a negative 5 stars and then some. Here's the rundown. After checking out Muni Diaries Live at the Make Out Room (awesome time, by the way), my slightly enebriated wife decided that she wanted to check out Papito. She read their review online from SF Weekly and was drunkenly fiending for something called the \"JJJ\". We checked Papito's website, and it says they are open until 11pm on Fridays. Despite my Taqueria Cancun-fueled objections, we hailed a cab on Valencia & 22nd and headed for Papito. Total cost of the cab ride, including tip: $10.\n\nSo we walk in the door at 10pm on the dot, and the bar is about 75% full. So we ask to sit down, and were rudely told \"Sorry, we're closed\". My wife attempted to explain that we had just wasted $10 on a cab ride from the Mission, but the jerkoff bartender (owner?) wouldn't budge. I pulled up their website on my phone and tried (soberly!) explaining that their site specifically indicated that they served until 11pm, at which point this utter and complete assh*le physically escorted us out of the restaurant! In his broken English, he tried steering us to their other place, Chez Maman, saying \"its the best restaurant in the neighborhood and it's not expensive\". EXCUSE ME?!? You don't have the foresight to update your f*cking website so that people wouldn't trek from all over SF to come to your restaurant, and then you insult your customers in addition? If I wanted f*cking French food, I woudln't have pissed away $10 on a cab when Cafe Des Amis is right down the street from my g*damned house! This d*ckhead can kiss my arse, he has no business running a restaurant in San Francisco!\n\nDisgusted, we jumped on the Double-Deuce and went home hungry, our Friday night completely ruined by this douche-nozzle.

I would have preferred it be more on the savory side but i enjoyed it with the fish which was perfectly cooked and seasoned.

She had carne asada steak tacos and they were fantastic!  The meat was excellent.  I had the chicken quesadillas and they too were out of this world!  They also serve mexican beer complete with salted rims, lime, and on ice....  perfect compliment to our meals.  Overall, I'd say we have to give this place four thumbs up!", "author": "Mac K."}

We started out with the elote asado (tasty corn on the cob, cooked perfectly, with some mighty scrumptious toppings), and then I had the vegetarian tacos, which were wonderful.  My husband had the quesadilla papa con chorizo, which he really enjoyed - he gave me some of the potatoes from his quesadilla, and they were like butter - perfectly cooked, and very fresh.  We will be back, and we will be bringing friends next time!", "author": "Heather C."}

The tacos are packed full of flavor.  The papa con chorizo taco is my absolute favorite, but I also recommend trying the enchiladas rojas.  It's nice to sit outside on a sunny day, but when it gets dark, it's warm and cozy inside.  I like that this place is small; it's intimate.  The food will make you forget everyone sitting around you - even the person you came with!", "author": "Jen O."}

I come across Papito.\n\nFirstly, let me say if you are looking for that Mexican hole in the wall feeling with huge plates that leave you in a wonderful food coma for hours - this is not your place.\n\nHowever if you want fresh ingredients, a quirky take on Mexican, wonderful flavours and attentive service give it a try.\n\nI sat at the bar since husband was not in tow. Asked for an Argentinian Malbec and was asked if I'd like to try a couple of tastings which I did and then I picked the Spanish wine. The tastings were generous BTW.\n\nChips arrived with a tray of 3 types of dip. Mild green, a sweeter one (not to my taste) and spicy salsa. Yum.\n\nI'm not a vegetarian but ordered the mushroom quesidilla which was filled with wild mushrooms. herbs, cheese and served with guac and fresh tomato salsa. Very yummy & so huge I took half of it home.\n\nAfter I paid the manger (owner) offered me \"one for the road\" an agave wine they don't sell but he keeps in. Also very yum. \n\nI felt welcomed, looked after, fed well and will definitely be back. \n\nPlus as has been mentioned - the GM/owner is very easy on the eye and with an accent to die for! :-)", "author": "D M."}

Both were delicious and made quickly (in about 10 minutes.) This corner of Potrero Hill has a couple excellent French restaurants (Chez Papa Bistrot and Chez Maman) and this is clearly French style Mexican. So do not expect any real heat or classic Mexican flavor. Do expect tender stewed meat, caramelized onions, carottes r\u00e2p\u00e9es and cr\u00e8me fraiche in your Mexican named dish. If you just want a cheap taco, head to Gaby and Liz taco truck at Jackson Park. Papito is unique and more upscale.", "author": "Edmund W."}

Was eagerly anticipating the opening of Papito - thought lunch last Friday would be the perfect time to give it a try - only to walk in and be told they don't open until 5:30. What am I to do? Easy, walk across the street and enjoy a wonderful bowl of pho at Sunflower as I watch group after group exit Papito as annoyed and disappointed as I was.\n\nTo the owners - you guys are responsible for amazing restaurants such as Chez Maman, Papa and until recently (huge disappointment for selling it btw) Pizza Nostra. You guys know better than this, rookie mistake. \n\nI have no doubt the food will be good and for $12 it better be but until they open for lunch I will continue to enjoy a great bowl of pho at Sunflower or a slice of pizza at Goat Hill.", "author": "Erika P."}

Yes I ate there twice for dinner, and once for lunch, and yes I am a local.\nThis is not just your neighborhood taqueria, the food is a step above that. I loved the duck taco and chorizo taco I had the first time. And the mexican flan to follow was sublime.\nBy the third visit the kitchen was running like a well oiled machine - turning out take out orders rapid fire, while not interfering with the food going to the tables.\nThis is definitely a mexican Chez Maman, and I can see myself going there a lot.\nYes it is possible to order lots of things and then suddenly be surprised by the bill, but this happens wherever you go. My two tacos were excellent and I dont think too expensive at $8, so the whiners should just keep driving to the Mission, struggle with parking, and save a buck or two at the same old places.\nMe, I will park easily on the hill, and enjoy excellent service and food. Oh, and the agua fresca - try the watermelon.\nThis is a must visit place....", "author": "Don R."}

The burrito is actually very large.  They gave me three different small containers of salsa, one red hot one that is ok, a mango or fruit one that is interesting, and a tomatillo salsa that I haven't opened yet bc that would slow me down from eating this burrito.

My carnitas burrito had wonderfully tender pork and was not greasy as you get with some versions of carnitas.

Again it was  a delightful experience and I met people at the bar and talked about the Giants winning the division and heading to the playoffs after a long drought.\nI decided to write this review after I read the previous reviews that are not necessarily factual. Any person who take their own food to a restaurant is abhorrent, disrespectful and totally primitive. They should go to a park and have a picnic.\nThis is a unique restaurant that offers succulent Mexican French inspired dishes. Tthe chef and the kitchen staff are Mexicans who have taken the Mexican food experience to another level that I find true only to San Francisco culinary heaven.\nIt's a small place with a great atmosphere and the personnel are friendly, attentive immediately and hospitable. Potrero Hill locals line up the street to wait for a table.\nI recommend that anyone who likes Mexican food to try this place on their own and experience it regardless of any review.
