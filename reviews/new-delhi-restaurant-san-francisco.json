I have a Bengali background and my husbands family is Italian -- we wanted to have an Indian buffet that catered to a variety of tastes. \n\nIt was actually really fun to plan the wedding menu with Chef Dey. He set up a tasting for the family -- he listened to our favorites and put together a sample menu.  We were able to have a great meal and to take notes and talk with him about what dishes we loved, what we would like to change. \n\nFor the food -- I LOVED the chaat canap\u00e9s -- chaat is my favorite thing and the way Chef Dey creates them is perfect for cocktail hour at a wedding. We also had dishes that reminded me of Kolkata like Kosha Mangsho (a lamb dish) and Macher Kalia (catfish in a Bengali style sauce). The only thing that made us sad was on the wedding day we didn't get a chance tohave the mushroom paneer or the rose water roshogollas but that's only because our guests loved them so much -- but we are definitely going to head to the restaurant for more.\n\nWhat I really appreciate is his empathy and attention to detail -- we were worried as some of our friends have strict dietary restrictions and he was kind enough to create a small batch which he served directly to those friends. \n\nOn top of all of that, our wedding venue was over 2 hours from San Francisco and because it was outdoors he had to set up his own work area and was able to manage to keep the food hot and delicious! \n\nChef Deys staff also did a great job serving at the wedding. They were all very friendly and polite -- I also appreciated how well everyone worked with our wedding coordinator. There were a lot of moving pieces and everything went smoothly!", "author": "Konina B."}

Closer to westfield really.\n\nAnyway, the parking is street only, which means there is no parking. the hilton not quite a block over offers the closest parking, and there is a city garage over on O' Farrell, but like just about anything in San Francisco, you'll be best served by finding a way here that does not involve driving.\n\nFrom the street it doesn't look like much. It's easy to pass by. Once inside everything changes. Upon entering you'll be greeted with a mural on the left side and the right is pretty much taken up with an old school pattern bar-polished wood, brass railing, wall sized mirror, the works. The bar here looks great, and it's a perfect spot to wait for your table, but this area has some truly epic bars. The bar has the looks, but overall it's not worth any more then a waypoint to the food. Not really a place to get your drink on/hang out is what I'm saying.\n\nThe dining room is exquisite. 20 foot ceilings, brick walls, central pillars, white table cloth with vest and tie waitstaff. This is a place to show off for dinner, or to feel pampered a bit. The chef -and yes it is a chef-runs a high performance kitchen. The menu really doesn't have any weaknesses. There really isn't a dish that I think won't be good. There is  not a deep selection-only one variety of chaat, and no dosa-but what is on the menu is mouth wateringly delicious. The house specials are the creation of the chef as is the house specaility wine-madhushaalaa. It's essentially a house made sangria with cinnamon and cardamon. Totally worth it.\n\nAbout the pricing. You are looking at a 30 to 40 dollar plate, and with two people it's quite easy to get to 50 dollars with add ons-like parantha, naan, drinks etc. So not necessarily a budget place. Still a good choice for an elegant dinner, and they do groups-weddings et al-quite well.", "author": "Steven W."}

His passion/dedication towards providing authentic Indian food, which also tells a story was super impressive. \nHighly recommend this place to anyone visiting SFO and looking to 'experience great Indian food'.\nRanjan's passion extends to creation of documentaries / writing books, being a great employer and all things culinary! \nIn a nutshell, you would just never be disappointed visiting his restaurant!!", "author": "Shubhodeep B."}

I arrived on a Sunday evening, and while I was seated immediately, other customers who arrived after me were told there would be a 45-minute wait without a reservation, DESPITE the fact that there was entire section of the restaurant that was empty and closed off. If they do not have the staff, hire more staff. But never turn away customers when there is ample space available, just because you cannot manage properly. I know about the 45-minute wait, because I was seated at the front by the register and heard for myself.\n\nEven with the limited tables, my service was poor. The server was slow to come to my table, my water glass was not filled until the end of the meal, and nobody came by to ask me how the food was. And when my dish arrived, there was no accompanying rice. I had to ask for rice, which I've always assumed is a standard side dish with Indian food. That's been the case for every other Indian restaurant I've patronized. I'm a huge rogan josh fan, and the dish I had was not as good as others I've eaten. While the lamb was nicely tender, the sauce lacked a savoriness I've tasted in other rogan josh dishes. The garlic nan was freshly made, but lacked garlic flavor.", "author": "Dennis M."}

To put it bluntly, I left pretty dissatisfied.\n\nPrice - $17 for a tiny dish of chicken tikka misala!?  What!?  No wonder they don't list it on the menu! $2 for my order of naan was reasonable but $17 for fairly dry (yes, even though it's bathing in curry) chicken? Never again. \n\nThe food - The chicken is dry and to make matters worse, there isn't that much chicken. I will however admit the curry that the chicken bathes in is quite good. As for the naan, it's wonderful. I love it.\n\nService - I don't know if it's just because San Francisco is so crowded, or because this place has bad service, but I had to wait painful lengths of time for my check at this place.  Multiple people would pass me by and ask if I wanted to order more food, and I would ask for my check... then they would ignore me. I counted around 20 minutes from the time I was finished with my food, sitting there alone looking sad, until the point I got my check. Then, I had to wait another 5 minutes to get my credit card back. The feeling was quite bad.\n\nAmbiance - It's nice and quiet, and the restaurant is well arranged, but one thing really bothered me.  I was seated under a rotating fan, and above that fan was a light, and thus the lighting around me was kind of like a strobe. It bothered me but wasn't enough for me to ask to be moved.\n\nTo summarize - Excellent naan (honestly, I don't know if I've ever had bad naan), excellent curry, mediocre chicken, overly high prices, and awful service.", "author": "Andrew H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-08-08", "description": "Being a huge Indian food fan, I ended up in this New Delhi restaurant in San Francisco. Location is great - close to shopping centers, Bart station, etc. The prices are for about $15 a dish but you have to pay extra for rice.\nAt the beginning we saw a nice table across from the table we were given (restaurant was half empty) but we were refused to change seats because those are for reservations only. When we mentioned that there are many tables and all of them are available, the waitress then changed her story and explained that that specific area is only for people who know the manager. What...!? That area had like 8 tables at least and only two (with managers friends, I guess) were taken. That's just rude. Well, here goes my first star off.\nNext, we didn't see our favorite Butter Chicken dish in a menu, so we asked the waitress which dish is the closest to BC. She said \"Chicken Masala\". So we ordered Chicken Masala and I also showed her my Yelp coupon for 2nd dish 50% off. She said she does not know about it but she will ask the manager.\nLater we ordered Palak Paneer and onion kulcha, still hoping to use my Yelp coupon.\nAs for Chicken Masala it was far, far from Butter Chicken! Not creamy at all. (We were brought Chicken Tikka later and it was much closer to Butter Chicken - please don't get confused here!)\nChicken Masala was way too runny, I did not like the dark meat instead of white meat.\nChicken Tikka was good. I strongly recommend it. Palak Paneer was the best - my favorite dish. It was the same size as other dishes, so we did not know it's actually an appetizer.\nOnion kulcha was okay, I didn't taste or see any onions in it though. I prefer lots of onion in my onion kulcha but this one was just like plain naan.\nAnother surprise was at the end when we learned that our 2nd chosen dish (Palak Paneer) was not an entree but an appetizer therefore we can not use our Yelp coupon. Well, we wish we were told about it before we ordered it, as I clearly showed my coupon to the waitress.\nSo the bottom line is that the food is good but little bit pricy for the quality and service. It was not one of the best Indian restaurants I have ever been to, and I have been to so many, including USA, Canada, Nepal, India, Dubai, Singapore, etc. but I would come back for that Palak Paneer.", "author": "Sanita M."}

That was my inaugural experience & introduction to South Asian cooking. Over the years, as you might imagine, I have had a very hard time not comparing Indian restaurant food to her cooking! I have tried not to do that but my heart & mind just couldn't help it!\n\nMy lunch at New Delhi restaurant yesterday was THE closest I have ever come to experiencing the WONDERFUL flavors of a mother's home cooking wrapped in a genuinely warm welcome! \n\nThe warm welcome came from Chef Ranjan himself, as he led the way to our table and shared with his love for his culture and cuisine! \n\nSometimes, the best way to tell if a restaurant is good or great is to order some of the basics! As my friend/colleague said, you can tell good Indian food by their samosas. \n\nWell, let me tell you THESE samosas are perfect! They are crispy on the outside, piping hot on the inside and when you open them up, a luscious aroma entices your senses to take that first bite full of the flavors of home!\n\nNext the basics again (from the Naan and Sag Paneer to the Tikka Masala) every bite was incredible on the palate! But the most delightful part of this meal was dessert and all you have to do is look at my photos below! \n\nThank you again Chef Ranjan for your hospitality!

Chef Ranjan's restaurant is a treasure in the heart of busy Union Square and with all the new restaurants opening up, it was great to eat somewhere that has been successful for 30 years. We loved the look of the restaurant, housed inside a 100 yr old building with exposed brick walls, Corinthian columns, and original Florentine tile. We walked past the beautiful bar and were greeted by a friendly host who escorted us to our table. Chef Ranjan came by to say hello and from there the adventure began!\nIt's truly special to see and hear from someone who is so passionate about his craft. We started off with cocktails and ordered the Murky Bengali Martini and Ranjan told us about the special Jalpaiguri olives he imports and pickles with his own recipe of spices. They were the biggest olives we have ever seen and drink was balanced and the perfect amount of spiciness. We there ordered some appetizers and entrees - samosa, alu chat croustade, rogan josh (lamb curry), hariyali murg tikka (chicken marinated with mint and cilantro) and a fantastic curry of tamarind and eggplant. Everything was so flavorful, but the highlight for me is when Chef Ranjan asked if I liked spicy food. When I answered yes, he brought by a tiny bit of his special recipe hot sauce which he keeps under lock and key. He talked about the 30+ ingredients (including ghost peppers!) in the sauce and shared his philosophy that there is no point of making something just spicy if it doesn't have flavor. He advised to start off slowly with just a tiny bit on the edge of my fork and to mix it into the curry of the dishes. What an amazing and spicy treat! Even the tiniest bit had a wealth of flavor and really heated things up. We cooled our mouths off with some rice pudding with mango drizzle and some chai tea. \nAll in all, it was quite the experience and my wife and I both agreed it was the best Indian meal we've ever had,  not only because of the fresh and flavorful cuisine, but because of Chef Ranjan's hospitality and enthusiasm. It was such a treat and we're so thankful! If you happen to be in downtown SF, this is the place for great Indian food.", "author": "Will P."}

Since the 90's I've always passed this place but for some reasons never have tried it, so I was a tad excited to finally have the opportunity do a tasting. As a precursor since this was a catered event I already had lowered my expectations as one has to factor that this is an offsite event. Keeping that in mind everything I tried was a real disappointment.  Lack of flavones and execution on everything. Unfortunately I'll still pass this establishment and not be pulled in to give it a try.", "author": "Lokesh D."}

I thought I'll give it a try since I had heard good things about Chef Rajan. It was easy to get a table Friday night. The ambience was very authentic. \n\nThe hostess seated us at a round table - perfect for our family of 3 adults and 2 kids. \n\nIt was all downhill from there...\n\nAfter being seated and settled in for more than 15 minutes and have ordered our drinks, we were asked to move to a different table because they had another reservation for the table we're at. If that was the case, why did they seat us there in the first place. We're moved to a corner table with only 4 seats - very cramped. I later asked the family that was given our table if they had made prior reservation and was told that they did not, and that they had just walked-in. So shady! Given all the trouble we had to go through to change tables again, which is worse if you have a 3-month old to take care of, one would expect to get an apology or at least a complimentary dessert/drink. Silence on both fronts. \n\nWe ordered madras tamarind chicken and chicken tikka masala - which we enjoyed. Naan was ok but paratha was so dry and cold. Rest of the food was just \"meh\". \n\nThe service here is pathetic.... I would have given 3-4 stars for food, but I'm taking 2 stars off for their service and another star for lying to us about the table reservation...", "author": "Sachin K."}

I am spending a lot of time in the bay area and stay in Union Square area.  I came across New Delhi a couple of months ago, exploring San Francisco.  The menu was authentic and the ambiance inside reminded me of some of the old palaces that I visited in India when I was a kid.  So a colleague of mine (Italian-American) and I decided to try it several weeks ago and just went to dinner there again tonight.\n\nBoth times that we went, we were blown away.  This time, she ordered the Chicken Tikka, Naan and Baigan Bharta (eggplant).  I ordered the Garlic Naan, Roti (wheat bread), Daal (yellow lentils), Chana Masala (garbanzo beans in curry) and Bhingiri Alu (potatoes and mushrooms in curry).  We both got a side order of basmati rice.  The food is outstanding and genuine.  I am frankly, one of the most challenging critics when it comes to food, specifically Indian food, and this is now my go to place in San Francisco for Indian food.  The flavors of each dish were unique and aromatic.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of our dinner tonight was that we were greeted by the host (Kiran?) and she remembered us from last time.  Now, I know that this place gets very busy and they have literally catered to thousands of people since we last came here, but she remembered us.  What else was really great, is that we just didn't have 1 server, but a whole team of them.  Shortly after we sat down, water right away, then a young gentleman took our order immediately.  The food arrived shortly thereafter.  I was parched, and must have drank 5 glasses of water in a few minutes - the outstanding service delivery aspect of this restaurant is that within seconds, my water glass was continuously being filled.\n\nOk, now I am going to say something that is potentially going to offend some of my fellow Indian restaurateurs; however, when I typically go to an Indian restaurant and make some special requests regarding how I wish the food to be prepared, I am usually met by a waitstaff that doesn't either care or understand my specific requests.  I was cautiously optimistic that the New Delhi team would cater to my request and waited for my food to test my faith in their team.\n\nThey did not disappoint in the least.  I requested no butter on my roti - NO problem - done.  I requested low salt in all my dishes - NO problem - done.  Everything was perfectly seasoned and customized to my requests, that my dining experience was outstanding.  Also, I had so much food left over, that I now have lunch for tomorrow.\n\nThe pricing was also very reasonable.  I can't even get a sub from subway for under $4, yet, I can get kickin Garlic Naan here for less.  It is almost criminal on low the Roti is priced at this reputable establishment.  The dishes are also moderately priced - on average, the vegetarian dishes are priced between $9-13 and the meet dishes between $13-16.  For downtown San Francisco, great value for the dining experience.\n\nThe best part was, that after the hostess asked us a couple of times how everything was, I informed her that I used to own an Indian restaurant in Chicago and that everything was quite outstanding.  She was very graceful in her polite response and notified the owner, a gentle man, I believe, by the name of (Ranjan?), who came over and conversed with us about our experience and the food.\n\nJust overall outstanding evening!  We will be headed back there soon.", "author": "Nick K."}

I ordered the Paneer Tikka, which was really a tandoori, a side of cheese naan, and one of their cocktails that was listed as being a stolen recipe on their menu. I was pretty surprised at how cheap their cocktails were. Well, when I got my drink, I could see why. Pretty small. My friend order the prawn tikka masala and a side of rice. My dish cost $12.95 and I think my friend's was $14.95.\n\nWe get our food and we're both surprised at how small the portions were. My friend's curry had no heat at all, but had some flavor. My paneer was okay. It was very dry though and was just laying on a bed of raw veggies that cooked on the pan the paneer came out on. The highlight of the whole meal was the naan and the check, which took a very long time to get. What made the whole experience, slightly better, was a 50% off an entree by checking in on Yelp.\n\nSave your money and disappoint for another day and just go to Blondie's.", "author": "Vanessa S."}

The service was unacceptable to both me and all of the other customers. My group called up and had a reservation, but they didn't inform us that there was dress rehearsal for a future  wedding. So we arrived and ordered and waited a 100 minutes just for them to forget a part of our order. And it would make sense for the food to be good because it was so many people were there.  But neither the food or portion was satisfactory. They only way people were able to bear the wait was the fact that they gave tiny appetizers and keep people in the restaurant. We were not the only ones who hated the restaurant, almost everyone was mad at the terrible service. However, I cannot blame the servers, I can only blame the manager for his terrible managing.

The description of the dishes as written on the menu have very little to do with the quality of the cooking and the resultant taste of the food. $ 19 biriyani was the smallest amount of biriyani ever served in any Indian restaurant. Personally I like smaller portions but it should be well cooked quality food. The rice in the biriyani\n(a rice based dish) was undercooked, the raita was thinned out. \nNext the cauliflower in mustard sauce .. not sure where the mustard went. For $15 that's the smallest amount of cauliflower curry ever served to me in an Indian restaurant. Again cauliflower the main ingredient was undercooked and they forgot to salt the dish. Achar boti kabab followed the same trend of poor tasting overpriced food and the salt they forgot to put in the cauliflower was added to this lamb dish. Chewy lamb pieces served in a platter and the only sizzling thing about the platter was the metal platter itself. Also none of the prices included rice or bread which has to be ordered separately and bread was again of inferior quality than in most Indian restaurant.\n\n We eat out in nice restaurants of all different ethnic variety as we love good food and because we are of Indian origin we cook Indian food and have eaten in many Indian restaurants all over united states. We had eaten several times in Rasika Indian restaurant in Washington DC area ( very upscale well known Indian restaurant ) and they have higher price range than most Indian restaurants. However each and every time they serve great quality, well cooked, Indian meal that makes every Indian proud. I have no problem paying well as long as the food served is good quality well cooked dishes that tastes well.\n\nMy advise to anybody looking up Indian restaurant in SF area, please avoid this place. Plenty other options available in this area and in a years of experience with Indian restaurant you will get a better value in any other place. \n\n I will again say our server was very nice and helpful and the restaurant was clean and tastefully decorated. We sort of wondered into this restaurant tonight without looking up in yelp first( like I almost always do) and initially looking at the decor and service, we were planning to come back again this week with more family. Off course we changed any such plan and felt compelled to log onto yelp to post this review. As an Indian woman who is a good cook and a better food connoisseur I am ending this review reiterating my advise, please try any other Indian restaurant in the area and you will be getting a better value for your money.", "author": "Subhasish R."}

Just so you understand how excited I am/was, let me repeat:  GHOST CHILI.  Got it?  Good.  \n\nI'm not sure that is on the menu, but when requested, they provide.  Well, it was not actually requested.  It was more of me asking for lamb vindaloo \"Indian spicy\" and the server laughing at me.  So, the manager comes out and asks for the person who requested Indian spicy.  I tepidly raise my hand.  He told me they would give us a little bit of ghost chili sauce in a bowl, and just to dip the tines of the fork quickly in the sauce, then mix with other sauces.  I think most people in my group tried the sauce, which made me proud.  It was extremely spicy, and the spiciness definitely lingers, but I loved every second of it.\n\nOnto the food - a group of 8 of us split papadum, samosas, naan, lamb vindaloo, chicken tikka masala, eggplant masala, chicken biryani, saag paneer, chicken madras, and a coconut curry dish.  Papadum, samosas, and naan were all tasty.  I like the lamb vindaloo, and it was very spicy, even without ghost chili sauce.  Lamb was tender.  I tried the chicken tikka masala, and thought the chicken was a bit dry.  The curry dish was great, I wish I could remember the name.  We also ordered two bottles of wine - one red, one white.

It was the perfect spot for the six of us who had come - we were able to enjoy great conversation while sipping drinks from the bar. In addition to fun creative cocktails like the Madras Madness rum, mango and grenadine drink I had, they serve non alcohol drinks like mango lassis (sweet or salty) and nimbu pani.\n\nFor appetizers:\n- Vegetable pakoras (fried vegetables, these are my absolute favorite)\n- Mini vegetable samosas (a smaller version of the larger samosas, these little treats had a kick. Careful, they're hot!)\n- Hariyali tikka (chicken with a spice. Yum.)\n\nDinner was excellent, we ordered: \n- Regular naan (savory, just the right texture of chewy)\n- Rogan josh (spiced tomato based curry with lamb, with a kick)\n- Saag paneer (on the sweet side, but still amazing with a generous amount of paneer chunks)\n\nThe food is delicious - wonderful flavors, always made to the spice level as requested. The ambiance inside is regal - tall ceilings, fancy decor - it feels like being in an Indian palace.\n\nEvery time I come, I feel nourished and relaxed. It's one of the places I'm happy to say that I'm a regular.\n\nAdditionally, I've gotten to know the owner Ranjan - in addition to the restaurant, he does amazing things with his culinary expertise, like the trip he is planning with patrons eager to taste more of India - with a trip there.\n\nHe also started the Compassionate Chefs Cafe, a non-profit organization dedicated to raising money to help children \"locally and globally.\" How many restaurant owners do you know who also have non-profits??

Given that New Delhi Indian Restaurant is just 1 block from the Union Square madness means it's a pretty big red flag for me. However, I was recently here on a business dinner with some out of town co-workers who love Indian food, and the restaurant didn't disappoint. Most of the dishes ordered seemed to be very flavorful and had spice (usually restaurants wimp out on the spice because they think people can't handle it). That was a refreshing surprise!\n\nWe ordered the mixed vegetable pakoras, papadum, and samosas as appetizers. All were solid, and a really great way to begin an Indian meal. For the main dish, I chose to go with one of the Ranjan's Specials, namely the spicy madras tamarind chicken. Being a huge fan of tamarind and never seeing such a dish on a standard menu at Indian restaurants, this was a no brainer! It was delicious!! More on the sweet side than the tangy side, so it was an explosion of flavor for the tastebuds. Loved every bite of it. The others ordered a variety of chicken, lamb, and seafood curries, as well.\n\nWhat I noticed was that the restaurant does not cheap out on the quantity of meat in curries. Usually you go to an Indian restaurant and they've got about 4 pieces of meat incorporated into a whole dish of curry and charge you about $12 or so for it. The dishes here were averaging about $15, but the amount of meat in the curries was fantastic! None of us finished any of the curries, because everything was so plentiful!\n\nThe one downside to the meal: The naan was slightly more doughy than I expect.\n\nI'd still come back here and bring out-of-towners looking for good Indian food.\n\nP.S. Not sure why the other reviews are so low commenting about the bland nature of the food. Being Indian, I know my spices, and this food was most definitely NOT bland.", "author": "Mansi A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-12-11", "description": "It was the first day at my new job and I didn't feel like making dinner in the evening. Indian food is pretty maddening to suss out in the Financial District, if you're looking for something cheap and quick. Having remembered there was a restaurant right on Market Street, I puttered over there, only to find entrees for $30 and an ambiance that didn't seem to suit itself to the jeans and sweatshirt I was wearing.\n\nPlus, it looked like the kind of place that didn't view take-out orders all that kindly.\n\nI found New Delhi on my phone's search and made my way over there. I much would've preferred the tried and true Gaylord's at One Embarcadero (amazing mutter paneer, if anyone's interested), but I didn't feel like making the trek in the opposite direction of my home, so New Delhi it was.\n\nNew Delhi's pretty centrally located, not far off Market Street, and not so far west as to end up in the Tenderloin (thumbs up on that end since it was after dark and I had my laptop with me). It offers a menu outside its doors so you can decide what's what before entering. Menu items are priced a little high, in my opinion, with meat entrees in the $15-20 range. At that point though, I just wanted to go home and decided I'd give them a try and get on with my night.\n\nAmbiance: Really lovely, actually. New Delhi is a bit narrow at the entrance, with a bar on the right and some basic seating on the left. Keep walking forward past the bar and you'll find a hostess and a much wider, more spacious dining area that I was actually tempted to stay and eat in. Alas, I wanted to go home more, so I asked about take out and was told they could accommodate.\n\nOrder speed: The hostess was polite, and my order of chicken tikka masala, rice, and garlic naan came out in under 10 minutes. Total cost with 15% tip was about $27. So much for avoiding that $30 price tag.\n\nFood: I got a veritable tub of rice for the $4.95 price, probably way more than one human being really needs. The naan came sliced in two and cost $1.95, as I recall. Fair enough. The chicken tikka masala was $14.95. For that price (which to me is a good $2-3 more than it really should be for a relatively basic dish), I expected a tub of tikka to match the rice. It really didn't seem like I got a lot -- of chicken or the full-out dish -- for that price. Yet I expected to be able to eat it in one serving and didn't manage past 3/4 of it. I eat relatively little though, portion-wise, so a lot of people could probably finish it off pretty easily.\n\nTaste: No complaint on the rice or the naan, but I do have an inquiry about the chicken tikka masala. Why is it that every place in this city I've tried has given me different flavors of what should be a pretty basic and static dish? To me, chicken tikka masala is tomato-based and orange. I've had a variety of colors of sauces when ordering this dish, the majority of which are more yellow in appearance. I can't really complain about the taste of the dish, since it was decent; it just didn't taste like chicken tikka masala, and that was unquestionably disappointing.\n\nVerdict: 3/5 stars, maybe? The ambiance was gorgeous within the restaurant, and it's clear New Delhi uses fresh ingredients. I'm just a little frustrated by the portion sizes and the taste of what should be a pretty uniformly made dish. I'd like to go back and try out a vegetarian dish, but the price, coupled with what I assume is a pretty consistent serving size, is a little prohibitive and unencouraging.\n\nIf someone wants to buy me my next dinner there though...well, no complaints on my part.", "author": "Andrew S."}

You walk straight ahead and you find yourself in a cavernous restaurant.  There are beautiful art work on the walls, lots of small comfy tables.  The service is impeccable and very friendly.  Our waitress was definitely great.  She was the kind of person you would want to hang out with.  You never have to ask for more water or anything because someone always magically appears and refills your glass.\n\nI had originally ordered the paneer, which though good could not compare to my friend's chicken korma.  Naturally we had to order a second entree of the korma and eat ourselves into cardiac arrest.

And I am glad I did!  My lunch turned out to be one of those Kismet experiences, and a good one at that.  I dug the interior of the restaurant; it evoked a mood that fit the cuisine.  Since it was just me, I limited myself to one appetizer and one entree.  The Samosas were perfect - the best I've had.  The Chicken Biriyani was top shelf.  I consider the prices reasonable and a good value given the quality of the food.  As I told my server, my barometer of food is to eat it plain and unadorned to gauge its quality and flavor.  Neither of these dishes needed a thing and the seasonings were deep and rich with just the right \"bite\" I look for in Indian cuisine.  But each dish was enhanced, ever so slightly, by the accompanying sauces.  The service was fantastic; my server was very sweet and attentive.  She seemed genuinely interested when she inquired about the meal and she listened to my take and perspective on the dishes.  I really liked her style - unobtrusive, helpful and sincere.  Wish I knew her name so she could get her props.  I liked the fact that it was relatively quiet at lunch time, but I would like to return in the evening for dinner.  I'm reserving a fifth star for a time when we can explore the menu further.  There is certainly that potential.  I ordered a couple of to-go dishes for my wife, who is home sick today.

It is by far the worst Indian food I have ever eaten in 25 years of my travels across USA from foodie places like New York & LA, to relatively smaller places with a small Indian population: the Little Rocks and Nashvilles... All in all, this could easily be the worst Indian restaurant in all of USA for what it boasts and what it delivers..it is a shame that such a place claims to represent the great Indian cuisine in a food Mecca like San Francisco.\n\n Where should we start?\n\nAll those Chefy descriptions of the dishes, they are just those. The dish and descriptions have utterly no correlation. Hariyali Murg Tikka, as the waitress haughtily informed us at the beginning, took more than 30 min. Even after that it was hardly cooked and had to be sent back to cook fully as I was worried the kids may get sick. Lamb Bhuna is a disgrace, and the Chicken Madrasi was...let us not go there...\nThe restaurant boasts a picture of Hyderabad Nizam on its walls along with other erstwhile Indian Royalty. As someone from Hyderabad, I can assure you that the Nizam would not even feed his dogs with what they are selling as Biryani here. The chef should visit the restaurant at the Nizam's palace in Hyderabad to get an appreciation of what Biryani looks and tastes like. This restaurant is a disgrace to all the great Royal cuisines of India and should be condemned for its fraudulent representation of Indian cuisine to our American friends and other unsuspecting visitors like us. They may claim to have the recipes, but the execution is utterly lacking. I felt completely cheated by the clever marketing of this place and one should do everything to stop such frauds..\n\nThe Chef/owner keeps insisting in some of his Yelp replies, that these are the tastes and flavor of the Royal houses and not the Indian street food. At the end of the day, good taste and flavors are  what they are, whether they are found in the Royal houses or at the street corner. And as many reviews on Yelp say, this place seems to have neither authentic royal flavors nor the street corner flavors. If you are visiting San Francisco, please avoid this place.

WTH! \n\nAnyways... like a mentioned the food was bland and not worth the price.

We hadn't waited any more than 10 minutes before we were escorted to a table. Walking through the dinning room my dinner companion and I were both struck by the complete lack and absence of ethnic patrons. Seriously the presence of white folk around us disturbed us both. Why wasn't there a more ethnically diverse group of people in this restaurant?  We were afraid the demographic might be reflective of the quality of food, but we were too buzzed and too hungry to jump ship.\n\nI liked how the menu included some historical background on the dishes. We ordered the lamb biryani our staple Indian restaurant dish and the tamarind eggplant. I wasn't wowed by the food but it got the job done. I've had better lamb biryani but this rendition got the job done. The tamarind eggplant was sweet and spicy. I had never ordered this dish before but I look forward to looking for it on other restaurant menus.\n\nWith so many other great places to dine in SF, I wouldn't race back here, but I would keep it in mind.", "author": "Lori K."}

Although not wowed, we thought that New Delhi Indian Restaurant was good.\n\nFor our meal here, we ordered the complete dinner (non-vegetarian), rice and Keema nan. We were hoping this would be enough food for two people, after the waiter made it seem like the complete dinner was really more of a one person thing, but it ended up being more than enough to fill us both up. There is a good amount of food with just the complete dinner, and to our surprise it came with rice too so we had a huge surplus of grainy goodness.\n\nIn terms of the positives, the rice was excellent, some of the better we have had. The mint chutney was also superb, as was the tea. On the downside, the Keema nan was a little dry, with the lamb not being anywhere near as flavorful as it should be. Everything else was so-so, from the decent chicken masala to the veg dish. The service was polite and attentive, though, to end on a good note.\n\nOverall, New Delhi Indian Restaurant was okay.

I love Indian food, but I am very critical of whether or not it is of good quality, so I was very interested to see how New Delhi could do.  \n\nFrom the moment we arrived, the service was impeccable.  We were seated immediately and our waitress was incredibly attentive without being annoying.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and deceivingly large on the inside-- it looks like a hole in the wall from the outside.\n\nNow to the food... AMAZING.  My partner and I started off with mango lasses to drink, and then ordered naan, garlic naan (for me), raita, saffron rice, chana masala and the chicken korma for dinner.  All of it was spectacular EXCEPT (and this is why it is not a five star review) for the chicken in the chicken korma.  While I am used to leg or thigh meat being used in these recipes, it seemed like every piece that either I or my partner bit into still had some cartilage or semi-hard fat attached to it.  I am really squeamish about that consistency in my mouth, so it was a little tenuous at points.  However, the sauce the chicken was cooked in more than made up for that.  I could have eaten a vat of that with their sublime naan.\n\nThe star of dinner was their homemade raita.  We wound up ordering two orders of it.  Our waitress informed us that it is completely made from scratch in the kitchen-- including the yogurt used.  Honestly, it was the freshest most flavorful raita I have ever eaten.\n\nI highly recommend that if you are ever in the city to find this place and stuff yourself to the brink of unconsciousness.  We spent right around $50 for two people and I know it will be a meal that I will remember for a long time.", "author": "Rachel S."}

The four of us family styled four entrees and they were all solidly very good. A lot of old standards but also many items that were fairly unique, at least to me. Rice and naan are ordered separately so we got two naan and two rice to round out the meal. The portions seemed a tad small for the price, but maybe leaving a table not stuffed to the gills is a good thing.  Next time, and there will be one, maybe we'll get an appetizer too, since they had a good looking selection of those as well. \nI wish I could remember specifically what we had. There was a mango prawn dish that made me wish for extra naan for dipping, a keema mattar, well seasoned and tasty, a specialty of the house w chicken, cashews & grated paneer which was unique and delicious, but can't recall the fourth.

We were visiting from LA and It was our first trip to SF. My wife and I are die hard Indian food fans. We have visited over a dozen Indian restaurants so we have pretty much acquired a good taste for quality Indian food. We initially noticed the nice decor and visibly this restaurant has in Union Square. Being die heart Indian food fans, we had to try it. I wish I had read some of the reviews first!\n\nWe walked in on black Friday after Thanksgiving and noticed that the place was actually quite empty. We asked the manager for a table and was asked if we had a reservation. Of course we didn't so we were asked to wait 15 minutes while the place was nearly empty. We were seated and greeted by the waiter who was not really friendly. All the while I was thinking maybe this is the typical attitude of waiters in SF... so after a couple questions, we ordered some chicken tikka masala, garlic naan and a couple of other dishes.\n\nI still gave them the benefit of the doubt at this point since the food hadn't been served yet thinking maybe they have such great tasting food and they can afford to lack in customer service... boy was I wrong!\n\nThe first thing we noticed were the portions, I mean c'mon! I know they say serving small portions leaves a better taste in ones mouth but this was ridiculous. The next thing I noticed was the white rice we ordered. It looked and tasted like it was 3 days old reheated in a microwave with stale grains all over the place. Again, IT'S RICE! it almost has no cost to restaurant so why not serve it fresh? Next came the Naan.. again no surprise here, it was almost cold with no garlic taste at all. we didn't understand how they could serve such food to customers. Of course the real kicker was the bill... WAY OVERPRICED!\n\nBefore people think we are one of those people who look to find something to complain about think again. Dining out for 15 years, I can only count 2 or 3 restaurants that have been almost this bad. This place gets the crown for being the worst. When we go to a restaurant, we don't really care about the customer service because we understand that we may have come in at a very busy time or short staffed etc. We don't care about the decor because we believe restaurant owners and chefs who are there because they love what they do might not have the money to spend on eye candy. We don't look at the price too much either because we believe price should reflect quality. But there is absolutely no excuse for having bad food, NONE! \n\nThis place really does a disservice to SF and its visitors. We came out judging SF food by this place which is a shame. We will never visit this place again and hope others don't either.", "author": "Nick M."}

Sadly, however, that's the best the service got. It took a long time for anyone to take our drink orders, and there were long stretches of time without anybody coming by. \n\nThe food was pretty standard for Indian. I think those at the table who enjoy their food fire-hot may have been a little disappointed - I'm unadventurous like that, so I was perfectly happy with my dish. You can order your food in \"grades\" of spiciness, which is helpful! It was a little frustrating that, for the price of the entrees, they did not include rice or naan. We ended up needing to order 4 orders of naan and 3 orders of rice for the whole table of 8. It would have been helpful if the menu had at least specified what was and was not included with the entree price (although they might lose business when people realized they are paying $15 for a small metal bowl of meat in sauce). Portions were also on the small side for price - after 15 minutes there was not a single bite left on the table (although we were pretty ravenous by that point). \n\nI'm not sure what the other options for Indian are in the area, and this wasn't a bad experience - it just wasn't great.

The paneer pakoras tasted stale. For the main course, we ordered Lamb bhoona, fish masala, tadka daal and eggplant bharta with some rotis. The lamb bhoona was tasteless...just a bunch of boiled lamb pieces saut\u00e9ed in generic brown onion gravy. I am not sure what the fish was...pieces of fish mixed with tasteless light colored gravy. The tadka daal had neither the color nor the taste. The eggplant dish was similar with uncooked green peas.

Although I tend to be a creature of habit, today while planning to return to a sushi boat place on Geary, I stumbled across this place.\n\nBeing by myself, I wasn't able to order a representative variety of food. But nevertheless I enjoyed my meal. I had a lamb vindaloo, raita, onion kulcha (naan), Indian pickles, and a nice large Taj Mahal.\n\nThe decor/ambiance was quite nice, neo-classical Indian with large columns. The service was ok to nice. The main waiter was pleasant, friendly, not very engaging at first, more so toward the end. Another person there who may have been an owner or manager went around to ask how everything was.\n\nThere were two women who had a little complaint. I couldn't really hear all the conversation, but my interpretation was that the rice arrived late, too late for them to even eat it with their meal. (They may have assumed that rice comes automatically with the meal which it doesn't  and is not unusual for an Indian restaurant.) The owner/manager came around to inquire about the meal and he encouraged them to tell him about any issues. They reluctantly told him. He profusely thanked them. I think he took off the charge for the rice. That's only from my interpretation of the body language and visual queues.\n\nThe food was very nice. My only issue was that my vindaloo which I ordered \"very, very, very spicy\" was medium. The waiter did write \"hot\" on the order, but I guess the cook didn't understand English.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my meal!", "author": "Nobbi L."}

Food was okay but the service was HORRIBLE!! \n\nThe samosas were really good! They were the best part of my entire meal. The price was a little steep for samosas but they were worth it. \n\nThe main course was just okay-if that. Garlic naan didn't have fresh garlic so ur better off just ordering plain naan. I was hoping they'd have butter chicken but they didn't so I had to settle for the similar chicken tika masala. It's was pretty good but the quantity is just enough for one person. Actually everything was basically for a personal size which was disappointing bc we were under the impression that they were meant to be shared. And for the amount you get, you sure are paying a lot. Tandoori chicken was good and juicy but almost not even worth getting bc we had to wait close to an hour to get served. They said it was bc the tandoori chicken takes a long time to make. No one ever bothered to check up on us after the samosas were served. We had to ask them as they passed by. And when we asked our waitress for the second time she went to the back and never came back to talk to us. Talk about rude! We almost walked out of there. So the daal was okay... Nothing special but it was a little on the cold side. Hariyali chicken was too sour. \n\nLike I said the service was horrible. We were starving by the time we got our food. They don't seem to care about service very much. They only refilled the small water glasses once and never came back. Overall just a frustrating experience. I would never go back..

Not only was our food delicious, but the wait staff were awesome and the place itself was beautiful.  Considering the quality of the food and the service, i don't think this is expensive at all.  This is one of the best Indian places i've ever been to.  I loved the whole experience of dining here.  Here's my breakdown:\n\nFood - very authentic tasting with a huge variety. The entrees are about $15 each and, when they arrive, look really small. But it's much larger than you think and very filling.  We shared the Bombay Saffron Bhuna Lamb (sweet, tender lamb, not oily or gamey) and the Chicken Madras (lotsa chicken, good heat).  The naan was very soft & tastes like they prepared it fresh (still really hot!) and made in the tandoor like it's supposed to.  I usually don't like basmati rice b/c it's too hard, but it was tastey here.  The Kashmiri Delight tastes great, very frizzy, good lime flavor, refreshing.  My Mango Lassi is freshly prepared and tastey, though I would like it colder (it was room temp).  The only thing I didn't like was my dessert, Gulab Jamun. It was wayyyy too sweet for my taste.  \n\nService - our waiter was very nice, knowledgable, and very accomondating.  The other servers were super nice too. Our water's always filled, never less than half the glass.  Only down side is that when I asked to see how naan is prepared (as suggested in their menu), i couldn't b/c the kitchen was too busy.  I would've love to see that.\n\nDecor etc - the high ceilings made us feel really comfortable and not crowded, even tho there were a lot of tables. Usually at indian places, i feel so cramped in.  Not here.  The whole place looks very professional and clean.  The peacock copper dishes set on the tables were reallllllly pretty.  Sadly, we don't use them.  Our waiter collected it away.

My friend and his Aunt were originally going to go for the curries of the world tasting but it got pushed back to a later date and they couldn't go so the owner payed back their two tickets which amounted to $70.  The $70 just about covered the 3 of us put together but THEN the owner threw in $25 for the inconvienence.  Plus he came down personally 3 times to check in on us and ask how everything was.  He was a super friendly personal guy.  So from my side of everything, it was free and we had quite a feast.  \n\nFrom this visit alone I can give Little Delhi no less than 5 stars.

Once they drop off your food - in very tiny dishes, so if you wish to share among several people, you need to order at least 3 entrees - it's hard to get their attention if you have a problem.

Yup, I got fried and breaded chicken bits for my \"kebob\". wtf? I've eaten Indian food in six different states, and no where have kebobs been interpreted to be fried chicken nuggets. I finally managed to flag a waiterperson, ask why I got a fried dish when the menu didn't mention it being fried, and sent it back. So all we had to eat between three people was 2 orders of samosas, a curried vegetable dish, some spinach dish that later gave my friends an upset stomach, rice, my chai, and two orders of naan. That small amount of unremarkable food somehow totalled $47!\n\nMind you, when the bill came, the chicken mcnuggets were still on there, which brought the original total to $56. The waitress said we didn't tell her we sent them back, to which I replied, \"you never bothered to come back to the table once you brought the food, so I didn't even have an opportunity to order anything else before my friends finished their food\". \n\nThe only reason we went there this time around was because my friend had a gift certificate. The first time I dined there, my friend from Vancouver's sister, who lives in Vallejo, chose the place. I wanted to go to Naan and Curry, but she told him the food at ND was fabulous. It was not, but we sure did drop a good chunk of change, which would have been better spent on a quality meal elsewhere. I don't like spending $20+ per person, just to be hungry two hours later because the portions are so tiny, or you get fast food at sit-down prices. Honestly, I can't get over the chicken mcnuggets... Learn from my pain and avoid! You won't be missing anything at all, except a lighter wallet. Oh, and my Vancouver friend, who just returned from a year of living and travelling in India, never encountered chicken nuggets outside of Mc Donalds. So there you go.", "author": "LunaCat X."}

Maybe that seems subjective, but given the large number of Indian places around that area of town, including another I tried, the quality of this place really stood out.\n\nI ate here alone on a Friday night.  I was seated a bit in the corner, which is understandable.  Staff were friendly but never overbearing, several people checking in on me throughout the meal.  \n\nI had a few wine options, and chose a nice glass of white wine, not too fruity or sweet.  Choice of wine, in my experience, exceeded the sort of run of the mill Indian places.\n\nI ordered my Indian Rut: malai kofta, rice, and garlic naan.  Everything was fresh and nicely flavored.  I find malai kofta ranges from buttery to spicy (yellow or red?), and this was on the buttery side (yellow).  I'm an orange girl, so this was a little mild for my taste.  But totally decent.  I'll just say I mopped the last bit out of the serving dish with my naan and leave it at that.\n\nHowever, this could be because the portions were smaller than I'm used to.  This had only 2 koftas.  I've had two koftas before in this dish, but they were big.  These were small, and so perhaps because I didn't do an appetizer or share dishes with another person. I felt I would have appreciated a bit more in there.\n\nOf course, spin this another way, and this is the first time I didn't roll out of an Indian place stuffed or toting leftovers.  You can decide whether this is an asset or detriment.  Jury is still out over here.\n\nIn the end, I would send you here over any other Indian place in this area.

He explained that while many restaurants can be a mix of Indian and Pakistani, this one was purely Indian.

OK by me!\n\nSo we ordered up the Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Tikka Botti (skewers) and Bengan Bartha.  I should interject here that thanks to my Yelping (and need to document what I ordered), I will FINALLY get to know an Indian menu.  You see, all times previously I eat Indian food with people who order for me so I never learn.  Oh, we also ordered up some nan (of course!).\n\nThe Bengan Bartha was my favorite.  Absolutely delicious, slightly sweet...maybe the best Indian dish I've ever had.  The Lamb was also outstanding.  The Chicken skewers were good, but pretty average.

By the time we were walking out the door; it was 8:15PM and we figured we'd just cab it instead of walking. Well; the cab we ordered was whisked away by someone else and we had no luck flagging one down, so we ended up walking the whole way. At 9:00PM; we arrived at the restaurant and our reservation had been canceled (which is to be expected).\n\nThe restaurant was packed and there was a waiting list on which we were 4th in line. We were told it would be about 30 minutes maximum which was fine with us as we were thrilled they could get us in at all. But; a few short minutes after we sat down at the bar table (no time to even order a wine (for us) or Coke (for the girls)), did the host grab us and take us to a freshly set up table (the one reserved for the \"Advisor to New Delhi\"). I only hope that the 3 two-tops in front of us weren't annoyed; but they were all seated shortly after we were.\n\nThe menu is expansive and fantastic; very artistic with historically significant descriptions. Our nieces were overwhelmed and while my husband and I knew what we liked; we weren't sure what to order for them since they're not fond of spicy food. But; to our VERY pleasant surprise, our waiter (Mohammed) was also the chef! We explained our situation; he made several recommendations and advised us on a couple of selections that we were considering. Bottom line; we had our whole dinner ordered with the greatest of ease.\n\nJim and I ordered and shared a green salad and dal soup; I have to admit, the soup was probably the best I've had. The girls had chicken tikka masala and the vegetarian version of the same (for Jessica) - both were very flavorful and mild (to our tastes), certainly the perfect choice for anyone new to Indian cuisine. Mohammed suggested the lamb vindaloo for Jim - it was perfectly spicy and fabulous, the sauce was perfect for dipping the wonderful assortment of naan bread that we ordered. Finally; we ordered the mixed Tandoori grill as well as a vegetarian version, I would order both again. In particular; whenever I've had fish made in the Tandoor oven in the past, it was always overcooked. The fish that came with the mixed grill was perfectly cooked (very tender and moist).\n\nWe ordered a red Zinfindel; at $24 a bottle, it was a bargain. As the girls were new to this kind of food and the inherent spice that accommodates it; the staff amazingly kept their water glasses full.\n\nWe will return!", "author": "Kymberli S."}

She had already ordered a drink, and since it's just a block away, I just met her here instead.\n\nAt first, we thought it was going to be more expensive based on how it looked, but the prices aren't that bad, more expensive than most Indian places though. The service was pretty good, very friendly, at points almost too friendly. \n\nI have to say, I was expecting more from the food. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but based on the price, I just thought it would be fancier. I appreciated the fact that they have a full bar, I ordered the New Delhi Sunset, and it was very refreshing. As an appetizer I got Bari Pakoras, they were nice and crispy, and not too oily. For the entree, I got the chicken Korma and Garlic Naan. I usually get Chicken Tikka Massala, and wanted to try something a little different. I enjoyed the Korma, very delicately spiced and tender bits of chicken. The Garlic Naan was ok, not the best I've had. Overall, very tasty food, but not the best Indian I've ever had. \n\nI gave it four stars for the combination of food, service and atmosphere. The atmosphere is worth the extra $$.", "author": "Kelly L."}

Even though we arrived at 8:50pm for our reservation -- 10 minutes *early*, and asked the hostess 3 times to record our arrival in OpenTable so we would be credited, they recorded us as a no-show and my OpenTable account was dinged as delinquent *and* we didn't get our points for dining there.

They DO have chicken tikka masala on the menu and my sister and I ordered it... it was fine. We had garlic naan (think garlic powder spread on naan) and cheese naan (think indian quesadilla - pretty plain). We also ordered the tandoori mixed grill - it had several styles of chicken, salmon, and shrimp.. all very exotic but noting too flavorful. We also ordered plain rice that was sort of yellowish in color. So this place is A-OK.... not really spectacular though. I like the rice, naan, and chicken tikka masala at naan n curry better and I pay WAY less there. Total came out to about $80 for two of us - I did use a $50 gift certificate from Bay Area Half Off ($12.50 for a $50 certificate) so it was decent.. but without the certificate, probably not worth it.", "author": "Kimberly S."}

One of them being that it's authentic and of course there's a full service bar in front of the restaurant. Can I bring you a cosmo with your naan and sag panner?\n\nTheir sag panner is the best I've ever tasted. It's thick and creamy with chunks of firm cheese. Eat it with the garlic naan and oh my god you might just pass out. The sauce for the chicken masala is thick and nicely seasoned. I always take the masala sauce and eat it with the pullao (basmati) rice, this in itself can leave me satisfied. The hariyali tikka tandoori left a refreshing taste of mint and coriander mingling in my mouth. To fully experience an Indian dining feast I order mango lassi to wash it all down.\n\nAs you walk in you see the bar to your right along with countless pictures if celebrities, local heros and other \"family\" members hung prominently (there's one f President Clinton using the telephone). Huge shiny columns line both sides of the rooms and a draped \"throne\"  that sits in the corner (I was told they use to have belly or Indian dancing at night) and Indian music in the background.\n\nI always see the owners walking around greeting patrons. On busy days I even see them seat and take orders. Dishes are roughly $12-19 but you always have left overs.", "author": "Lola L."}

My husband ordered the tandoori chicken and I got the chicken masala. Both were exceptional! The flavors in the chicken masala were so incredible - coriander, ginger, and other spices blended so well together. The chicken was cooked perfectly too. \n\nThe only reason I am not giving this review 5 stars is because the service could have been a little quicker. The waiter never came back to ask how our meal was and it took him quite some time to come back around to bring the check. \n\nEven though the service was a little lacking I would definitely come back here again.

Tandoori chicken was grilled just right and had enough zest to keep it interesting for the first couple of pieces; the lamb curry lacked spice and verve, quite bland. \n\nRice and naan are awarded passable grades; can't say the same thing about the mango lassi, which was rich and creamy but ten degrees too warm.\n\nThe decor is odd and quite uninviting - there's this rather ugly and hideous overhead flat lighting, draining the life out of the room. The crimson walls and large ceiling help accentuate that this could have doubled, at least spatially, for one of the rooms at The Overlook Hotel in The Shining. When you're at a restaurant you don't want to be thinking about this.\n\nDinner for two people without alcohol or dessert runs you $55, and given the unremarkable nature of the food, you're probably better off walking an extra couple of blocks to Naan-N-Curry.", "author": "Joseph K."}

The jukebox is connected to an internet sever which allows you to choose from all types of different music! \n\nWe had a ton of fun, the bartenders were all a lot of fun and great hosts.

Personally, I think it depends on the item you order.I love spicy and hot stuff, and I'm often the one who makes things too hot when making meals for friends and family. Also, the menu does indicate that you can order things in grades of heat. \nI went with a group of six people who all got slightly different things and we all shared a little taste of each others. \nI came close to giving it five stars, but I'd say that the rice was the most lacking although I smothered mine with curry dishes. I can also see why there are comments about the BBQ chicken. It was probably the least favorite of all the dishes among the six of us. \nFavorite of all was the Tandoori Lamb with pickling and spices and the Dol Gosht, which could have been spicier, but I didn't order it that way. \nOnly real con was the portion sizes with the price being so high.

No big deal, especially given the sea of humanity seething by outside. \n\nAfter ordering drinks at the bar, the bartender asked us if we were waiting on a table.

The atmosphere of the main dining area is pleasing, with tall captial-topped columns in ranks amongst the tables, and black and white photos of yesteryear's Indian gentry. We all ate way too much, and enjoyed it throughout.\n\nHOWEVER, two less-than-pleasing things stood out. The first was that our table, and at least three others around us had a direct view into the bussing station, where a box of 4-hour fogger was prominently displayed next to dishes and glassware. One of our group mentioned that the roach-killer was visible to patrons, and the staff moved it after an unconcerned shrug. VERY unappetizing. \n\nThe second was that the bathroom, at least the mens', was rank with the odor of urine. Like at a park bathroom, or a concert. It was really bad. Hold your breath bad.

Since I wasn't in the mood to walk around to find a place to eat I went in. I love Indian cuisine and was in the mood for something hot and tasty. Because I was eating alone I was seated right away. I reviewed their menu and was pleased to see that it included some historical background on the dishes. I ordered the non- vegetarian plate which included tandoori chicken, seekh kebab, chicken masala, spiced vegetables, nan, dessert, coffee or tea. I figured if I order a dinner platter I would be able to try a sampling of everything that they have to offer. To this day I have found no place that can match their Chicken tandoori. On the menu it talks about their tandoor oven that was brought over from India. It also says to ask the waiter to escort you to the kitchen so you can see it so I did. You think I was going to leave without a peek? To my surprise they escorted me to their kitchen and I met the chef and his assistant. I have never seen an authentic tandoor oven. They had two of them and I was surprised how hot it gets. A tandoor oven is a cylindrical clay oven used in cooking and baking The chef demonstrated how to cook nan. He placed the nan on the wall of the oven and within a second it was cooked. He asked me to give it a try but I chickened-out. That oven is hot and I wasn't going to risk burning myself. Just placing my hand over it, I felt my skin melting. How they do that everyday is beyond me. It was a fun, informative and tasty meal but one warning: the first glass of tea is included in the dinner special but after that re-fills are charged by the glass which is not mentioned on their menu.", "author": "Tina M."}

I enjoyed the taste of India and I'll go again. It's expensive, I guess... but It's worthy, believe me.", "author": "CacaoRock J."}

The space is somewhat ornate in atmosphere, or at least they've made a strong effort to recreate some sense of a Raj dynasty. The service and servers are really friendly, helpful, and the food itself is above average for your usual Indian cuisine. Again, agreeing with Shoba, the bar comes strangely alive on some weeknights, seems almost a separate entity compared to the relatively tranquil restaurant section - the surrounding Union Square outskirts and lack of other drinking establishments might be the reason for this, or perhaps we were there on an industry night. Either way, for some pretty decent and tasty Indian food in a nice sit-down environment, you can't go wrong with New Delhi.", "author": "Nish N."}

The restaurant is large and on the nicer side-- white tablecloths, cloth napkins, etc.  Service was excellent-- the waiters were friendly, and  the manager came over to check up on how everything was and ended up chatting for 10 minutes. The food was good and the menu had all the usual suspects-- samosas, koormas, naans, etc.  The drinks were also good-- we sampled two specialty cocktails before our friendly manager sent over some lychee martinis on the house-- all very tasty, and a bargain at under $6 each. By the time we left, the bar area was pretty crowded and people seemed like they were having fun.  All in all, I had an unexpectedly enjoyable meal!", "author": "shoba d."}

She had been raving about how cool this place is and about how much fun she has had at the bar. When the 5 of us arrived on a Fri, we were greeted by the bartender. He was pretty friendly and made us some nice martini's. The way the bar is set up, it's kind of hard to have a group. We pushed some chairs together  by one of the small tables, but we were kind of in the way of people trying to get into the dinning room.\nAfter about an hour, the male bartender left and a female bartender replaced  him. She was not nearly as friendly and in fact, I might say a bit rude. When I went up to the bar to order another round, she made a point to help other customers first. I had brought back to her all of the empty glass, so that she would not have to come and collect them. I waited patiently and eventually got another round. The next time I went to the bar, the same thing happen, except this time, someone at the bar pointed out that I was waiting to her. After this round I had had enough and told me friend I needed to go home.

My boss ordered a butter chicken lunch special which he must have liked since he ate it in like 5 minutes. My mattar paneer was perfect, it actually was on the hot side but I loved it. There was just enough paneer cubes and the Naan was hot and fresh and brushed with ghee.  They brought plenty of napkins and were on top of refilling our waters. Personally I loved this place.

We are both vegetarian and we found some good choices.  Perhaps they're listening to the complaints on here (i hope so!)... 2nd, there is one waiter at lunch time who is really nice.  he really tries and he seem like a genuinely good person.  \n\nnot sure if it is the owner, but you'll know the guy i'm talking about if you go ... he has a \"holier than thou\" air about him.  not fun to deal with.  he seems to be the only one to handle the money, which I think is strange.  suggestion: trust your employees.  both times we've gone for lunch, it has taken way too long to get the food, so we're rushed to try to pay the check.  please try to get the food to your customers in a reasonable amount of time.  We ordered off of the new lunch menu this time; this should have cut our wait time down because, i'm assuming, you don't choose your most time-consuming dishes for your lunch menu.  \n\nthe lettuce in the salad had some slime on it.  that's something you might want to take into consideration.  \n\nanother thing i wanted to mention is that the first time my husband and i had actually tried to come here (many months ago), the hours on the door showed that they were open for lunch, but when we walked in the door, someone came towards us quickly and told us they were closed.  something strange about this place. after reading all of the reviews, i'm actually pretty skeptical about their business ethics.  \n\none more suggestions for the guy who handles the money.  if you are trying to encourage people to use your new lunch menu, that's fine.  but if you have people who are asking for appetizers in addition to what they are ordering from the lunch menu, well ... you can even say no to that, i won't fault you too much... but **then**, don't let the people from one table over order appetizers.  that just makes the first customers who were refused the appetizers feel very strange indeed.  overall, you made us feel very uncomfortable.  this last time we went was the last time we'll ever go.", "author": "Cat F."}

Was very hungry when i arrived at the restaurant. I was promptly seated, orders taken. The guy waiter was the good one, the ladies were full of attitude. 2 Stars for the Service\n\nThe Vegetable Shorba is supposed to  be a light vegetable soup garnished with spices, but turned out to be a thick gravy dish which should be eaten with Indian Bread (Naan, Roti etc). Hmmm..surprised. On inquiry the waiter said \"we always serve it this way!!\" WOW but being from India i know what Shorba is and the way they prepared it. This wasnt the real thing. I ordered a Roti (Wheat Bread) which was good (this is so simple to prepare that it is difficult to screw it up!) and a Navarathan Curry (Gravy dish with vegetables and fruits). Surprisingly the Navarathan Curry tasted the same as the Shorba! That is ridiculous. Except for the tinge of sweetness in the curry, it was the same as the Shorba. I guess they had some readymade set of dishes which they serve under different names. I ordered a Salted Lassi (supposed to be thick yoghurt) it turned out to be very watery like buttermilk. I decided to try one more dish before passing the judgment. The Vegetable Biryani tasted like Sambar Rice. For comparison, it is like ordering calzone and getting a pizza instead!! The food is definitely tasty and eatable, but not authentic Indian fare. For those who dont know what Indian food is, it would not be a disappointment. I give 2 stars for food. \n\nAmbiance was that of a palace (though a cheap one). Carved high ceilings, ornamented columns, antique exhibits, portraits of different Maharajas etc. I like the inverted ceiling fans which were standing on pedestrals!! They were playing some fast beat hindi movie songs, would have preferred soothing indian classical music instead.

Starting from Food to Service , everything was just bad and i will never like to go again to this place ever . We took some guests to New Delhi Restaurant  who were visiting us from LA and we really were embarrassed with the food and the place . we got the table easily and it was not too crowded as well.. We ordered assorted Vegetarian Platter.. Its suppose to be a platter but we were actually surprised since it only consists of 2 oily onion rings , 3-4 veggie pakodas , 1 samosa and 1 papad.. Everything looked and smell stale and there was a bad oily smell .. When we placed our order for main course , it took the staff almost 40 minutes to serve the food on the table . we ordered Kaali daal and Malai kofta for main course with garlic naan .. Kaali daal was  tasteless with no salt or any flavor..It tasted exactly like a boiled daal . Malai Kofta again didn't had any taste and was bland. the quantity was less and we wanted to order more curries and rice but we were already so disgusted with the food and the service that we decided not to order anything else .. finally the last part ..

Very tasty and they had just the right amount of kick. The dinners were reasonably priced ($12 - 18) and it's enough to share with other people. They garlic Naan wasn't as garlicy as I'd wanted it to be, but it was soft and warm. The service was excellent and refilled our water every 5 mins. I'd definately go back the next time I'm in S.F.", "author": "David W."}

I love Indian food, and this is my favorite Indian restaurant of all time. The decor in the restaurant is very nice and it is located in the center of San Francisco, just a couple blocks from union square. My 18-month-old daughter LOVES this place too. I brought takeout back to the hotel room and she ate more than she had on the whole trip. Writing about it now makes me wish I could go back. If you live in San Francisco, don't miss out on your good fortune. Check out this restaurant today!", "author": "Kristine M."}

The decor inside the dinning area was extremely dull.  The walls lack luster a disgrace to New Delhi's colorful heritage and the royal kings pictures they have on their walls.  They had the temperature set to match New Delhi's in April because it was close to 77F.  After eating some spicy food just not the temperature to have.\n\nLets talk about the service!  As soon as we sat, we were served water and a couple menu cards - no one asked if we would prefer anything different.  After a really long wait & a few minutes of tapping our fingers on the table waiting for some one to take our order we got some service.  A vegetable appetizer sampler we ordered.  They would not substitute one of the items in there for another.   The waiters were most inattentive and same can be said about the person who took our order.\n\nThe food, murg akbari was mediocre.  The best part of my dinning experience was the onion kulcha.  \n\nI would not recommend any of my friends to eat there.  I have eaten at better Indian restaurants where the food and service was superb.", "author": "Amit R."}

Their menu is colorful and unique, offering spiced dishes that cant be found anywhere else, and leaves you wishing you had a party of 10 so you could explore a taste of everything. The Chili Cheese Pakoras were phenomenal (the spiciest of everything we tried), and are the single hook that will reel me back for another dining event. Since there are items on the menu that can only be found here, we decided to test the waters and steer away from our typical Indian entrees. We had the Mustard Gobi (a tangy collieflower dish with amazingly complex flavor), the Soya Josh (a vegetarian take on the Rogan Josh recipe, which had a lackluster flavor, and used the cheapest of dehydrated soy products from china town), and the garlic nan. The naan was okay, dry and used garlic powder and no corriander leaves, and the rice (which didnt come with the meal) was great. \nThe waitstaff was attentive, the ambiance is romantic and elegant, however hipsters beware as the patrons oogle you for leaving the collared shirts and slacks at home.", "author": "josh t."}

Also, he had horrible BO. i am not one for perfumes and things, and generally dont notice or mind BO but when i notice it, it's bad.  still i wouldnt have cared, if we'd gotten water in a timely manner or if he didnt have such an obviously bitchy attitude, he even walked bitchy. oh well. the other people who worked there were nice enough. our bill came out to about $135 for four people which was pricey given the lack of atmosphere, mediocre service and just ok entrees. as i mentioned, great naan and rice, and good lassis. i still wont be back.", "author": "Merredith L."}

Me, being Indian, went there one night with my parents and gf (who is another type of minority). It as 615 PM, way before city dinner time, and the place was ABSOLUTELY empty. The hostess just took a look at us, and without me saying a single word, said sorry there are no open tables. Then I said how do you know I don't have a reservation (I didn't but that's besides the point)? So then she is like well do you? I said no. She said, well in about 30 minutes we will have every table full. I said that's fine, every table is empty except for two (with white tourists), we have a show in an hour so we won't be longer than 30 minutes. She said no sorry, our tables are reserved there is nothing I can do. WTF?!?!??! The place was empty and it was only 615!! And just the look on her face and her dumb ass manager who promptly came to her side just had this stare like they were absolutely disgusted to see actual Indians trying to eat here. Maybe they were actually being kind and not allowing us to eat because we would then tell everyone how crappy their food is...I don't know. \n\nSeriously, I don't know how good the food is but it's probably not authentic. Save yourself the trouble and go to Little Delhi down the street. They are super friendly, the food is a LOT cheaper, and it's not only authentic but really good without being overly greasy. \n\nThe hell w/ New Delhi, this place will never see business from me or my family again. Nothing against white people but this place is a bunch of f'n sell-outs.", "author": "pankaj l."}

Though a pretty standard item at Indian restaurants, the chicken tikka masala is left off the menu with the intention of making it a \"special item\" no one knows about.  That way when you ask your server what he recommends he gives you a schpeal about the chef's new and totally unheard of special creation called TEE-KA-MA-SA-LA that he only makes on special occasions, ie, everyday.  Earthy and full of the flavors of India, unnecessary hype aside, this is a very pleasant dish.  Not to be forgotten was another dish actually listed on the menu, the pullao raja.  Saffron flavored rice with almonds and raisins. I'm not normally a raisin eater but the textures of this dish cannot be denied, even by my picky palate.  The lychee martini (also not on the menu) is a nice accompaniment to your meal in this spacious restaurant reminiscent of the dining hall of a great maharaja.", "author": "Shelley H."}

(palatial decor reminscent of the \"raj,\" clean table linens, etc).  the food is quite good though perhaps not as tasty as some of the aforemetioned holes-in-the-wall, but the friendly waitstaff (who were willing to submit to our bachelorette party antics :) ) and ambience make for a generally pleasant experience!  i will probably be back sometime, if not soon.", "author": "Roshni R."}

We're a party of six that included two kids for whom we did not order anything, and we're charged a mandatory 20% gratuity! I also don't like the practice of charging gratuity on top of sales tax.

I'm talking not just  about hanging a few paintings of India on the walls, decor comes down to even the architecture of the huge columns inside the restaurant. beautiful high ceilings, beautiful all over to look at. even the lighting was a perfect ambiance. bathrooms are nice, big, and clean. my hoe bag took a while in there. (\"wtf, did you fall in?\" \"no, omg i spilled my makeup bag all over the floor and i was scrambling to pick it up\" \"hahahah\"). i ordered a lychee martini and my coworker got a dirty one. (yea, she likes it REAL dirty.) my lychee martini was exactly the way i liked it. ice cold and sweet enough for only a slight alcoholic taste, and it was not at all weak. i even had 2! the hoe bag and i  enjoyed our drinks very much. left with a light buzz, definitely worth coming back to!", "author": "carmen n."}

From the service to the bland food to just the overall high prices i DO NOT recommend this place. When we first walked we were asked if we had reservations.. and when we said no.. we were given a weird look. Upon arrive to our table a waiter gave us menu;s and we asked if we could get a cup of chai.. and he said u can tell you waiter instead of going down himself and ordering it himself. Once we were done eating we asked for boxes and we were told in a rude way we dont box food.. i said thats fine just give me a box and i will do it myself. ONce i put my card in the check tab.. it took them 20 mins to come by and pick it and do my transaction. My advice is dont waste your money on a place thats slow service, bland food and is over priced. Go down a block or 2 and go to Naan N Curry.. better food and 1/3 the price.", "author": "Deven G."}

The food alone is second to none. by far the best indian food ive tasted in the bay area at least! The real reason you want to go to New Delhi is the EXCELLENT staff. You've got Lois who is a superstar waiter. Very Polite very professional and also if you go a little more frequently he's actually quite humorous. He gives off a very friendly and comfortable vibe that makes you feel at home at New Delhi. I was actually there last night and there was this really problematic family causing a ruckus out of something silly, about a toy or a baby or something of some sort. And while the family was chewing him out he was very courteous very kind and very professional. Gotta say they have a ROCKSTAR staff. If you ever stick around late enough to hangout at the bar. Id definitely recommend hanging out on Sophie's Shift. Awesome at customer service. And very cute as well :P", "author": "Duck M."}
