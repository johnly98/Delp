Only this time the battleground was in my belly. I don't know what drew me to come in here on a Tuesday evening except the faint promise of Vietnamese-style short ribs scrawled on a board within view from the sidewalk. I was planning to eat at Tio Chilo's Grill on the next block but gave it a second thought when I thought perhaps I was bypassing another hidden jewel on 24th. No hidden jewel to be found here.\n\nIt was perhaps the most dismal dining experience I had since the last time I gave a one-star review. I've only given 16 of them. The interior is quite huge but there was still a sense of clutter about the space with most of the activity happening at the counter with take-out orders or single diners (photo: http://bit.ly/1KW1zbh). I probably should have gone up there, but I decided to take a table next to the window. It turned out to be a big mistake as the waitress ignored me. It took her about five minutes for her to hand me the three-part menu, which wasn't a bad wait, but it took her about fifteen more before she returned. By that time, I had more than enough time to peruse the odd hodgepodge of a menu.\n\nIt starts with traditional Cantonese dishes and segues into all-American diner fare with the last page devoted to Vietnamese pho bowls and rice plates. I decided to try the $12.50 Pho Duoi Bo, an oxtail noodle soup, and start with a $4.55 plate of Pork Potstickers. I got them in a leisurely manner, and they were dried out with the crusty bottom just a little too crusty. it came with a sweet plum hoisin sauce that I couldn't quite understand they were serving as an accompaniment (photo: http://bit.ly/1FE59jE). About another twenty minutes elapsed at which point she informs me they were out of the oxtail. Seriously. She waited more than a half-hour to tell me this. She uttered a perfunctory \"Sorry\" and waited impatiently for me to order a substitute.\n\nRather spontaneously, I went with the $8.95 Bun Bo Hue, a combination pho with sliced beef shank, brisket, meatballs and steamed pork loaf in a lemongrass broth (photo: http://bit.ly/1HVUhhp). When it finally arrived, I was quite disappointed with the too-salty broth and the overcooked meat. I found the steamed pork loaf virtually inedible. Running true to form, she never did come back to give me the check, so after leaving most of my pho in the bowl, I didn't waste time walking up to the counter to pay. It was a miserable experience and I found myself grappling with the gurgling aftereffects on the bus ride home. Now I know how the Paris Peace Accords must have gone.\n\nFOOD - 1.5 stars...a rather unfortunate combination of blandness and saltiness\nAMBIANCE - 2 stars...formica tables in an expansive area\nSERVICE - 1 star...a very weak area for them\nTOTAL - 1 star...a hodgepodge of dishes none of which worked for me...and what's with the Indian name?", "author": "Ed U."}

There is a difference between 'salt and pepper' chicken wings which is a dish that involves breading chicken wings with a similar mix as the 'salt and pepper' pork chops are breaded with, and 'fried chicken wings' which is a dish that is a (much) worse rendition of kfc.

The spacious interior contains frozen moments from that time (like the giant rotary phone) and they imbue the place with a kind of mystery and longing - which is so hard to come by in this now-so-hip neighborhood, currently bent on mercilessly expelling from its nethers anything that stinks of gaudy design and \"value\" food not considered by urban leisure magazines to be the latest and the greatest in gastro-entertainment. This is one of the largest restaurant interiors you will ever visit in this city (there is also an upstairs private party buffet area), which is truly a wonder considering it's a privately-owned non-corporate establishment scrambling for survival in one of the priciest areas in town by serving straight-up, no-nonsense Chinese American midgrade.\n\nYes. This is American Chinese, with some straight-up \"American\" and a bit of Pho thrown into the mix. More rarified and decadent items like the Honey Walnut Prawn appetizer or the Punjab Spicy Eggplant Chef's Special hang out among standard-issue glazed chicken items, noodle and eggroll combos, and the heady aroma of wonton broth. No, it's not snob-approved, Michelin-rated, five star fare. No mixologists are on call to make sure you have the sexiest, hippest cocktail north of LA. If you were dumb enough to believe in the existence of bung, this is the kind of place you'd suspect of serving it to you. Whatever you are eating probably won't be free-range or organic. It might even have MSG. But it is good, yummy, and fairly cheap - and in a neighborhood where the $20 meal in some over-decorated ponce-hole is quickly becoming the standard, places like this need the locals to get behind it and support it with their economic votes. (As a matter of fact, they recently had to whore themselves out to some HBO TV series as - get this arrogance! - an unused restaurant space one of the handsome, privileged urbanite protags is possibly trying to turn into his awesome fusion tapas lounge or whatever. Que lam\u00e9.)\n\nFavorite items at this place include the Hunan Fish (some of the other dishes in that seafood fold-in are quite good too, like the Ginger Fish - though the Hunan Shrimp is a bit lacking in texture, honestly), the aforementioned Spicy Eggplant Chef's Special, and the Avocado Egg Rolls. Apparently, their Pho is getting some rave reviews too.\n\nIf you're in the mood for this kind of thing, then you will leave very happy!

But whatever, on to my initial experience at Punjab.\n\nAs I walked up the corner of 24th and Bryant, I noticed this restaurant and thought, hmmm, Indian food in the Mission, sounds nice, maybe I'll try this.\n\nAs I walked in, I didn't smell the typical curry smell of an Indian food place, in fact, just a clean odor of Fabuloso, which made me think of Mexico, and then noticed the strange Chinese decor everywhere, and a fish-tank without fish inside.  There was a 50's diner feel to the place as well, which, again, threw me, as the restaurant had an Indian name, Chinese dragons and crap all over the walls, and looked like a greasy spoon, but certainly didn't smell like one.  Only in San Francisco, I though to myself.  The whole layout focuses on a kind of darkish-greenish color, like forest green or something.\n\nSo I sat down at the bar/diner area facing the kitchen in a quite comfortable green swivel-chair, at the greenish-colored bar and was greeted by a Chinese/Malaysian lady of indeterminate age, whom I later learned was named Serene, or Serena, something like that. I tried the Punjab soup upon Serene's recommendation. Spicy but not overly so, shrimp won-tons that weren't overly dry or gushy, chunks of kohlrabi or baby bok-choy, in a large bowl, piping hot and utterly delectable.  They had Tsing-Tao beer, and other selections, all very reasonable.  \n\nAs I ate my soup, I recognized that there were a number of American offerings on the menu, so I quizzed the chef and Serene as to the quality of the American food they served there, and they both assured me that it was very good.\n\nSo, I took the 19-Mission from the TL all the way back to this restaurant on Sunday, soon after I'd tried it for the first time, with my girlfriend, for a little adventure, and we had brunch here.\n\nI can't say enough good things about the brunch as well, I order Chicken Fried Steak with eggs over-easy and hash-browns, which also came with two sourdough pancakes, I think the full cost of this giant order was around 11.00 or less.  Unbelievable price, and with a free mimosa as well!  My girlfriend had some huge omellette, which came with some other sides, and again, a free mimosa, for around 8 or 9 dollars, again, out of this world prices.  For only 2 dollars more you could get another mimosa, so we began killing mimosa after mimosa, all the while being attended very attentively by Serene, who's friendly demeanor topped off the experience making it as perfect as it could get.  \n\nUnfortunately it was super-hot that day, we'd intended on doing some shopping in the Mission, but were both too full to shop, so bussed back to the Tender-Nob and enjoyed some of the meds I'd found at the dispensary recently.  We both slapped ourselves silly for not ordering some of that delicious Punjab soup to go, as it would've suited our munchies perfectly.\n\nAll in all, I can't say anything bad about this place, despite the quirky Chinese decor, way too much green color on everything, the somewhat confusion selection of food, and finally, the name, Punjab, which just throws you completely off, but hell, they could call it 'Jack-Face' 'and I'd still eat here. This place is a true gem, and the patrons that I met whilst in my drunken mimosa reverie all seemed to love it as well, one sweet elder lady named Vera has been coming to this place for like 40 or 50 years.

On the plus side, it is known for, you know, Chinese restaurants with an Indian names, serving American diner food mixed with American Chinese food, served by hunchbacked old Chinese ladies who could be found at any such established in a semi rural Chinese town.  Yay.\n\nOn my trip there, M and I ordered the salt and pepper pork-chop, my standard go to at Chinese places, mixed stir friend greens, and something else that was generically American Chinese but that I can't remember.  The Pork Chops were decently tasty but a couple of orders too greasy.  The greens were varied in look but not as much in taste, probably owing to the sauce/oil they were prepared in.  Now that I think about it, the third dish was probably sweet and sour chicken, which I think I was left unimpressed by.  \n\nStill, the portions were more than generous, the prices cheap, the parking ample, and the service pleasant.

I have regular cravings for this place.\n\nIt is cheap and the portions are generous (like most Chinese places). But most of all, the plates are filled with veggies and the food is not too oily. I actually DON'T walk away feel like my skin is oozing oil after dinner at this place. And yet it's still so TASTY like Chinese food is. \n\nThe most important thing is that these people know how to cook. Whether the taste of their dishes happen to suit your personal preference or not, you can't argue with the fact that their chicken and shrimp are always amazingly tender, their veggies are perfectly steamed, and their fried items and ridiculously crispy. Some of the fanciest restaurants I've been to can't even get that right. And at that point, no amount of saffron or pretty plating makes a difference.\n\nThis is not a high-end place. less than 20% of customers here are under 100 on any given night (or maybe just the times I choose to go). But the food is tasty, the service is great (very atypical of Chinese places, I know), and the price tag is astonishingly low. Definitely a place to hit up if you're craving some take-out chilling on the couch. Definitely NOT a place to take your date.\n\nBrunch serves free mimosas and are dirt cheap. I've had the brunch there many times and I am always surprised at how much food there is and how low the bill is. As for the American food on their menu, you can find better places in the Mission for a few dollars more. \nBut their Chinese food is the bomb.\n\nI recommend the walnut prawns.", "author": "Diane W."}

I am not a picky eater at all and I couldn't even stomach three bites.\n\nBased on Yelp reviews, my husband and I tried Punjab for dinner last night.  Man, I don't know what you Yelpers are thinking!\n\nWe ordered the appetizer platter, the Szechuan Chicken, the Sesame Chicken and rice.  The items on the platter were deep fried to the point that the prawns were almost indistinguishable from the egg rolls.  As an after-thought, they brought sticky jars of sauce which were filthy.\n\nBoth chicken entrees seemed like scoops of the same thing --with just some sesame seeds thrown on the sesame chicken.  They were deep-fried globs of something that used to resemble poultry, drenched in corn syrup and red food dye.  Absolutely gross.\n\nAfter one piece of each type of chicken and a couple bites of rice, I was ready to go home and cook dinner.  No doggie bag needed as I don't even think our pooch would eat this crap.\n\nLook, I expected it to be an old school Chinese dive.  But this was inedible.  And for those Yelpers who think this stuff is \"authentic Chinese,\" you're kidding yourself.  This class of food is called tourist Chinese food and sometimes, it's even pretty good.  However, the places that serve this stuff, usually have an entirely secret menu of real Chinese food for their Chinese patrons.\n\nI'm giving two stars instead of one because it was basically clean, the service was prompt and the bill was cheap; $25 for two, including wine.", "author": "Amy A."}

This is a five star review of the best 3-4 star chinese food deal in the Mission, hands-down.  \n\nPunjab gets all kinds of things wrong:  Blah decor, semi-uncomfortable seating, understaffed tables, and unsettling oddities (empty fish tanks?) and a name that you'd expect would serve Indian cuisine instead.  At face value everything about it suggests mediocrity.\n\nThen the food comes.  \n\nNot only is it well above average but two people can enjoy 5 dishes here and the bill will be less than $25 guaranteed.  It makes no sense.  It's like the South Park episode where they go to the Mexican Space Program and get a ship for $200.  Is that the whole bill?  Si.\n\nPro tip:  Go for the family meals even if you're alone or with a couple, and substitute whatever for the Crab Rangoon.  It is to die for.  There's also a full (American-style) breakfast menu and free mimosas for brunch, which is random and awesome.\n\nJust skip the unusual candy that comes with the bill or go straight for the fortune cookie, which may contain a future that reads like this:\n\n\"You will feel like you robbed this place when the bill comes\"", "author": "niero g."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-03-07", "description": "I love Punjab for what it is - a cheap Chinese restaurant with quite a bit of character and an interesting history.  It's a great place for kids - particularly noisy babies and their inexperienced, neurotic parents. The waitress is very nice and personable. The menu includes some average diner fare (BLTs and the like) in addition to Chinese dishes, which is a nice change of pace (and sates the one hesitant, picky eater in the crowd).  They also serve breakfast with a free mimosa or glass of sparkling wine.  While hipsters are swarming St. Francis, you can have a decent, quiet breakfast without waiting in a 40 minute queue. \n\nThe large dining space is quirky. The \"regulars\" are interesting to watch - like the elderly lady with the high-pitched voice who can sometimes be seen helping to fold napkins.\n\nAs far as the food is concerned, they always use fresh veggies which I can wholeheartedly appreciate.  Portions are huge, but prices are not. They  frequently offer \"specials\" (like vegetarian brown fried rice) and experimenting with difference appetizers (like avocado spring rolls) and such which keeps things interesting.", "author": "Who Knows N."}

The Chinese guy added some Chinese food to menu while the other guy was gone, and eventually the Indian guy decided to never come back to San Francisco, so he let the Chinese keep the restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-05-08", "description": "I have no idea why there are so many bad reviews.  The veggies are not overcooked so they still have a crispiness to them (which is rare for American Chinese restaurants)  and what I really like is that they boil their chicken so it is really moist and its all white meat.  I usually get the spicy basil chicken with fried rice and an eggroll (combination) and I think it is great!  Crab Ragoon is also really good. The portions are huge for 7-8 dollars.  You can easily get 2-3 meals out of them. I am not really down for paying 20-30 dollars for some fusion food that people rave about but in the end lacks in flavor. It is not the healthiest food to eat but a great place to go when you don't feel like spending an arm and leg.  Also, I had the pho and I thought it was fantastic (can easily serve 2 people).  I went to 2 Vietnamese restaurants on Valencia and 18th and I think the pho here is better.  You can tell the broth has had more time to simmer than the other places I went where the broth was more watery and the meat not as tender.  It is a bit annoying when some yelp reviews below say this is not real chinese food,  yup you are right, it is americanized.... we get it.  We all understand that the menu has been americanized just like so many other ethnic cuisines.  There are some traditional items on the menu if people need to have \"authentic\" cuisine.  China is a big country with many variations in cuisine.  A large portion of Chinese immigrants came to America and created the Western version to fit American tastes, everyone knows this. The American Chinese food has been going strong for 20-30 years, it is common knowledge. Sorry, a bit of a rant there. Anyways, the staff is amazing and whenever I walk in the 90 year old grandma is sitting at a table cutting the snow peas and she is so cute.  They all work really hard considering how many to-go orders and patrons they have and only one waitress and 3 cooks. This is one of my favorite restaurants on 24th and because I like it so much this is my first yelp review! :-)", "author": "Jodie S."}

So that you wont bring all your hipster friends and ruin the whole thing. But I can't lie. I am in love...LOVE with Punjab. My boyfriend has even started singing songs about Punjab. We love it that much.\n\nI've driven/walked past Punjab a million times and have just chalked it up to another dirty Chinese American restaurant that I would never eat in. Please feel free to maintain this illusion for yourself. \n\nMy boyfriend works nearby and one day, his employee, sick of burritos, went into Punjab searching for more. My boyfriend ordered brown rice, salmon and asparagus and has not stopped going back ever since. At least three times a week, the friendly staff at Punjab fills his belly with delicious, nutriutious food. \n\nI stopped in to pick up an order for him one day and, unprepared, fell madly in love at first site. There were only four other people in the rather sizable dining room and some really mellow, classic jazz played at just the right volume. The sweet lady behind the counter (try to imagine a Chinese diner) prepared his order for me and even laughed at me when I was surprised that my bf had ordered an orange soda. \n\nI took the food to my bf's office and shared some of his chicken pot stickers. Holy Hell. Home-made from scratch, by hand...YUM. \n\nI decided we MUST try the breakfast. People, let me tell you something. For all of you hipster fools who stand in line for hours outside the Fountain or Boogaloos thinking you're gonna have the best breakfast ever and that its totally worth the wait...stay where you are. Do not approach Punjab. You will destroy it. \n\nI had the vegan sausage scramble (WHAT???) with FRESH spinach, mushrooms and jack. That vegan sausage was the best I've ever had. The hashbrowns were freaking perfection...crispy golden brown on the bottom, fluffy fresh potato, crispy golden brown top. The english muffins were just ok and the free mimosa was grossish. But it was free and half way through I didn't care. The food was amazing. \n\nThe people who work at Punjab are kind, funny, friendly and warm. They're not super fast (we waited about 20 mins for food and there were only three other people there) but you don't care. You're being soothed by the jazzy tunes, your eyes are being mezmerized by the myriad of Chinese decor and the feeling that you're in on a great secret keeps you happy. \n\nThe bill, for a vegan sausage scramble with toast and hashbrowns and a Jim's Big Five Omlette with double spinach, bacon, tomato and broccoli with home fries and toast AND two mimosas and a big pot of tea...was $20. Am I dreaming?\n\nPeople, seriously. This is my new favorite restaurant.

It was my mom's b-day, she was feeling nostalgic, and I was (still am?) kinda broke, so it was a good choice for us.\n\nThe first thing that stuck out to me was the level of cleanliness. It can be less-than-stellar (and usually is) at many Chinese food restaurants in the Mission. One of the servers there, Judy, has been there since forever: she's just as kind as ever and is especially attentive. That's the next thing I like about the place, it's the inviting atmosphere.\n\nBut I guess the most important part is the food. I've had some really good and really crap Chinese food. The food here is definitely on the better end. They've tossed in many American dishes into their menu. We started off with complimentary tofu-seaweed soup that tasted pretty much like any other tofu-seaweed soup I've had before: nothing special, but it was still tasty.\n\nFor the appetizer, we ordered some avocado rolls on Judy's suggestion. Basically, it's an eggroll-like creation. It's fried wonton stuffed with avocado and other tasty things and it comes with a small saucer of sweet prawn-honey sauce which totally rocked. The combination of sweet-savoury, and the textures of crispy wonton and creamy avocado worked really well. \n\nFor my main dish, I ordered the grilled sole, which comes with your choice of fries or mashed potatoes on the side. As I'm not the biggest fan of either, I asked for mixed vegetables in place of it and it was done with no problem. The vegetables were basic steamed vegetables (carrots, snow peas, celery, bok choy, broccoli), but with a twist: fresh chopped basil tossed in at the end. It lent to the vegetables this wonderful aroma, and gave them a slightly peppery-sweet flavor. It was a really good addition. The grilled sole was moist and flaked nicely and the portions were generous: there was totally enough for at least 2 people. It was a tad greasy, but overall it was super tasty and cheap!\n\nMy mom ordered a spicy eggplant-chicken dish. I found the eggplant a little overdone for my tastes. I like my eggplant to have some body  to it: this eggplant was one step before being mush. There were strips of roasted red bell peppers in it that I absolutely loved. This is a spicy dish, so have something to drink close by. Fortunately, we had a nice bottle of chardonnay to accompany our courses. This dish does come with a nice heaping of white rice which takes some of the edge off the spiciness. The bits of chicken in the dish are glazed with a thickish savoury, spicy, slightly sweet sauce.\n\nWe wrapped it up by getting a slice of carrot cake for dessert. On my way to the restroom, Judy stopped me. She said that she would wait for me to return before bringing out dessert. Making my way back after, she had prepared the dessert with a candle on top, which I thought was really nice of her. We both trekked back to the table and as we approached, Judy began singing happy birthday, and of course I joined in. It was really cool when everyone else in the restaurant joined in and sang along, too! My mom was totally loving it, it moved her to tears!  The carrot cake wasn't anything exceptional, but it was a nice way to top off the meal.\n\nTalk about great service, good food and a really enjoyable dining experience. We ended up staying there for over 3 hours. I've never found a restaurant before where I've gotten so comfortable that I've lost track of time: that's a true testament to how inviting the atmosphere really is. I've decided: this is my new place for Chinese food, dining in or taking out, even if it's somewhat out of the way, I can definitely justify the longer trip. The bill was a very fair amount for the amount of food we had.\n\nOh, and they serve breakfast there, too. Pancakes, eggs, among other things, and on the weekends you get a complimentary glass of mimosa or sparkling wine with your breakfast. How much does that rock?!", "author": "Christopher R."}

It's one of those places that you pass on your way to St. Francis Fountain and someone says, \"Hey guys, how bout we go to Punjab instead?\" And the crew keeps walking...\n\nIt must have been a full moon that fateful night because Punjab suddenly seemed like a great idea!

After surveying the reviews, we ordered:\n\nPotstickers\nCrab Rangoons\nWonton Soup\nBeef and Broccoli\nPunjab Chow Fun\n\nDespite the low expectations and positive 4-star rating, I was disappointed (see disclaimer above).

What was I supposed to be talking about?  Oh yeah, PUNJAB. \n\nOk, so my new roommate suggested this place and since it's right around the corner I thought I'd give it a go for a quick dinner.  I had been eyeballing the Spicy Basil Tofu on the menu he brought home so I already knew what I wanted.   Walking in, the first thing I noticed was....holy crap, this place is  huge!  In a neighborhood of cramped taquerias and limited personal space, this place is strangely large.   \n\nThe only patrons were a large group of old folks chattin it up and having a good time.  It seemed obvious that this was their regular Friday evening deal.  I overheard them talking about the good ol' days and also how Phil (who is apparently 90) had four women up in his room the other night.  What a pimp!   Anyway, my point is, any place that attracts regulars with character earns stars from me.   One of the ladies informed me that Felicia makes great Spaghetti and meatballs on Friday nights.   Weird...but good to know. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and were having a good time chattin it up with the patrons.  My food came out in under 10 minutes which always makes me happy when doing take out.  \n\nMy Basil Tofu was quite good.   Not exactly \"spicy\", but very flavorful and definitely hit the spot.   This is a great little alternative spot down here in burrito-land.   Good, cheap chinese food with friendly staff and a funky atmosphere.   I'll definitely be going back to see what else they have to offer....though I'll probably not go with the Spaghetti...that just seems wrong.", "author": "Scott W."}

Seven of us ate and had 1-2 drinks each for $100 before tip.\n\nThe only downside is that I had a bit of an upset stomach which started a couple hours after eating. Nothing crazy happened.

I actually like the service, there is a lady there that I totally love, she is super friendly and quick to help.  The food is decent and since it is right downstairs from my boyfriend's place, I can just go order it and get in like 15 minutes.  I kind of order boring things like Mongolian chicken, beef and broccoli and mushu chicken, but so far it's all pretty good.", "author": "Rebecca D."}

After visits 3 times a week for at least 4 months straight, they knew my name, what I ordered, and when I sent friends to eat there, they mentioned my name, and got the VIP treatment.\n\nThe food is always consistent, because the same head cooks are there all the time. The servers/owner are always very courteous, and love to make small talk and make you feel welcome. And the ambiance is amazing, huge restaurant, diner bar, top floor, and cafeteria style seating. Incredible.\n\nI suggest getting a combo meal. #17 is by far my favorite. Salt and Pepper Fried Shrimp, no tails, and BBQ Pork Fried Rice. How much? 10 Bucks. \n\nI don't usually write Yelp reviews, I loathe it actually, but this restaurant needs business. Its great food, with truly great people running it. It would shame me to see such a diamond in the rough close, without so many people trying it.", "author": "eric e."}

Great place to bring kids- and a great place to just sit and eat and talk for hours. They were accommodating with my veggie needs and that of my family! I even brought my own soy chicken to have them cook up just to experiment and they were happy to do so. The people there are very friendly and Sweet. It feels like family there. My wife has been going there since she was a little girl and she gets treated just like one of the family.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-09-03", "description": "I was wary to try Punjab for Chinese because they boast serving Chinese and American food, so authenticity may be suspect.  I was also a little worried seeing Tapatio on the tables, rendering the food slightly Mexican in flavor in addition to being somewhere between Chinese and American.  The eggplant tofu dish was not too bad, if a little squishy and the crab rangoon were cute creamy pillows, as another reviewer stated.  Everything was incredibly greasy and bland, though.  The staff was friendly and very much wanted us to return, but I probably won't.", "author": "Jody S."}

Not only is the food very good, but the cooks, waitresses, and the fellow diners are the best!  What I really like is that Punjab is opened seven days a week.  When you become a regular customer it seems like you join another family-the Punjab family.\nFelicia, the main cook, makes sure that all the ingredients are very fresh and as local as possible. The food is delicious and healthy. She is a friendly and caring woman.  Make sure you say hi to her. She doesn't get out onto the floor as often as she would like, because she is so busy in the kitchen.\nBREAKFAST-What many people don't know is that Punjab serves breakfast every day.  You can have the best breakfast in the Mission starting at 11:00 A.M. on weekdays and 10:00 A.M. on weekends.\nPunjab has an extensive menu with all the good dishes anyone would want for breakfast.  Felicia's  hash browns are great! I think her Hollandaise sauce is one of the best I have tasted. \n Felicia is also a great gourmet chef. She can whip up braised lamb shanks, pork loin in lavender sauce, and fresh fish dishes.  She doesn't have these specials all the time, but if more of us come in requesting these and other gourmet specialties she will make them more often.  Ask for her avocado spring rolls with spicy plum sauce.\nWhat is especially great is Felicia's Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners!  She makes a wonderful turkey dinner with all the other dishes we associate with the holidays.  Her Christmas dinner was to die for!  Her ham with a special sauce and scalloped potatoes was so good!   Punjab is also opened New Year's Day.\nThe staff is great.  Both of the waitresses, Judy and Serene, are sweet and will make your visit an enjoyable one.  Homg who makes most of the Chinese dishes is one great cook.\nI hope after reading my review everyone will want to come to Punjab to have great meals and become one of our family.", "author": "cheryl b."}

This neighborhood place has been around for generations. I've been going for years.  Believe me, it's not a trendy kind of place but where they lack in ambience and service, they make up by serving delicious fare at decent prices. I stand by that old phrase \"you get what you pay for\". Punjab really meets up to my expectations. With today's unstable economy, who's not looking for a bargain? One can easily feed a family of 4 for less than 25.00 or go with bunch of friends for Tsing Tao beers and sample the tasty appetizers. I love hot and spicy and here are some of my favorites.\nSingapore Rice Noodles - Spicy curried rice vermecilli stir fried with bbq pork, shrimp, bell peppers, scallions, bean sprouts and egg.\nMongolian Beef - tender slices of flank steak with julienned strips of red and green bell peppers, carrots, onions, scallions, bamboo shoots in dark spicy brown sauce. (I like this extra hot)\nPork or Chicken Potstickers - Homemade meat dumplings with minced garlic, ginger and cilantro lightly pan fried with house made chili dipping sauce.\nKorean Chicken -Deep fried battered chicken drumettes served with a tangy hot & spicy sauce. (I always order these and they are the first to go!) \nSalt & Pepper Chicken Wings - Lightly battered deep fried chicken wings tossed in a spicy mixture with jalapenos, bell peppers and onions.\nWonton Soup - After a night on the town, I love to have a steamy bowl of freshly made wonton soup with spicy oil.\nPunjab also makes great vegetarian stir fry. I love the Mixed Vegetable with Tofu or the Black Mushroom with Baby Bok Choy.  The fresh Long Bean or Snow Peas in Garlic Sauced is a must. You can also order that spicy. \nCheck out Felcia's Combo Plates.\nI encourage you to visit Punjab's for its no frills simple tasty food at reasonable prices.\nIf you want fancy, go to Great Eastern or Koi Palace", "author": "James W."}
