Ya-man!\n\nIt was my first time having Yemeni food and never thought I'd categorize it as one of my comfort foods, but here we are. Yemen Kitchen is the epitome of a hole-in-the-wall, with only three tables. Though you definitely wouldn't go for its interior design, the authenticity of the establishment is palpable through its savory aroma, the Arabic music, and of course the food. The generous portions of tender Lamb Aqdah, roasted Chicken Kabsah, aromatic pilaf, and fresh from the oven Tawa Bread made me nostalgic for and teleported me back to a time I've never lived through and a place I've never been. I imagined eating these dishes around a dinner table, surrounded by warm chatter with people I loved. Happy is an understatement, and safe is a closer description to how I felt (even in the middle of the Tenderloin).\n\nOn top of the mouth-watering food (I'm actually salivating thinking about it right now), the cook may have been one of the nicest person on this planet. Because he was the only one running the kitchen and register, the service took a little longer than what you'd expect from a casual place as such. But as you hear the pan sizzle as he prepared your food expertly on the spot, you can't help but know that the wait will be worth it.\n\nPro tip: you can order ahead online through various apps or their website to save yourself the wait. They also do delivery! There's NO question that you must pay Yemen Kitchen a visit.", "author": "Claire W."}

Plan A for lunch was unexpectedly closed and this was the closest place within walking distance. Praise the Yelp app!\n\nYemen Kitchen is the epitome of a hole-in-the-wall restaurant. It's run by one man, who's the owner, chef, and server. It's located in the seedy TL, a bit grimy, seats 8-9 people max, and the wall menu is only in arabic. \n\nI love that - the BEST ethnic places are the menus that I can't read!\n\nDon't worry, they have a laminated menu in English too: https://bit.ly/2Ixaql9. The menu is meat centric with lots of lamb and chicken options but there's also options for vegetarians and vegans. Most items are roasted or stir-fried. Nothing is over $17. Cc's accepted.\n\nI love Middle Eastern food but this was my first time having Yemenese food. This is the second Yemen restaurant in SF...the owner of Yemen Kitchen opened the first Yemen restaurant in SF (called Yemeni Restaurant) in Lower Nob Hill but sold it. \n\nWe started with the Beef Stir Fried w/ hummus ($15): https://bit.ly/2tMjUDr which was excellent! The stir fried beef was tender and robust with spices while the hummus was creamy with a nice chunky texture. This completely blows South Bay's Oren's Hummus' out of the water on any day. \n\nMake sure to order a side of the Tawah Bread ($2): https://bit.ly/2Mq8tsM for sopping up all that bomb ass hummus. The tawah is a Yemeni bread that's like a thick paratha with tons of deliciously crisp layers. \n\nFor our main, we shared the Roasted Lamb w/ potatoes, rice (Lunch - $13, Dinner - $16):  https://bit.ly/2MwlQrA. The roasted lamb shoulder was meaty and tender. While muted in flavor, the accompanying housemade green and red chili sauces were like crack. They were perfectly spicy and tangy which added a nice pop to the dish. The rice...ahhh, basmati rice and nicely spiced stewed potatoes were the ideal accompaniment for a deliciously satisfying Yemenese comfort meal. \n\nThe owner accidentally charged us the dinner price for the entr\u00e9e so he gave us each a complimentary square of Pistachio Baklava: https://bit.ly/2Kvx9TE. It was on point - flaky, sweet, and nicely sticky. \n\nSince it's a one man show and everything is cooked to order, expect to wait about 15 minutes for your meal to be prepared...longer during the lunch and dinner rush (especially with delivery orders via Eat24, UberEats, GrubHub, PostMates, DoorDash). \n\nThe ambiance? There's none...it's tight quarters with 2.5 tables. The food is the focal point. Personally, I think this would be a great first date place...to see if that person can appreciate good food or if they're high maintenance AF.\n\nBourdain was right...\n\nWhile we weren't on vacation, other than being on a 1 hour vacation from work: \"Sometimes the greatest meals on vacations are the ones you find when Plan A falls through.\"", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The specials are written on a chalk board in Arabic, so you have to rely on the laminated English menu.  There's only about 3 tables in this tiny storefront that is mostly kitchen.  And you'll definitely pass by some Tenderloin realness to get here.  But wow, the food is totally worth it!\n\nSaltah: This is obviously the benchmark dish one must try when eating at any Yemeni restaurant for the first time and it did not disappoint!  Super tender morsels of lamb at the bottom along with a few errant potato pieces.  Tons of broth that was closer to gravy in texture and richness.  A must for helping get through all that bread.  But it's the fenugreek foam on top that really sets it apart from other Middle Eastern meat stews.  I mean saltah was using foam techniques way before fancy restaurants started foaming anything they could think of.\n\nTawah Bread: This is huge!  Like if you want it to compare to Indian bread, it's 3 times the size of a standard naan.  But with many more flaky layers than a naan, almost like a thicker version of a Malaysian roti.  Anyway, it was just perfect for the saltah.", "author": "Adam B."}

The restaurant itself is a hole in the wall in Tenderloin but is very safe to go during the day. The place is a bit small but cozy and special with Yemeni decorations. The menu is written in both Arabic and English - a sign that food is super authentic. People from local Arabic community often come here to chat and socialize. Very friendly vibe.\n\nMe and my friend ordered Lamb Aqdah and Saltah (national dish of Yemen) along with Tawah bread. Lamb Aqdah is a spice-full lamb stew with potato and string beans. Lamb is super tender and soft and the spices are just right to blend with the lamb and vegetable. Saltah is a lamb soup also with some vegetable, with some pepper pur\u00e9e on top. The flavor isn't as strong as Lamb Aqdah, but the light pepper pur\u00e9e blends perfectly with the heavy lamb soup, making it a perfect dish for a chilly day. Tawah is Yemeni bread - multi-layer and very chewy. Perfect to dip into the soup and stew. \n\nWill definitely want to come back and order delivery during some cold rainy night.", "author": "Shen Q."}

I was famished and ordered a few items upon arriving. I was asked if I was dining in or taking out. If you dine in, you get to help yourself to some sweet hot tea. \n\nThe first taste of tea reached my tongue and I immediately felt this sense of happiness. It was perfectly sweetened and tasted like a great treat to finish my meal with. We then sat for about 20 minutes waiting for our lamb and veggies, fava beans, hummus, and tawa bread. I started to complain a little about the long wait. \n\nThe food arrived and I immediately told myself, I will wait over and over again for this scrumptious meal. The lamb was not gamey, but instead deliciously tender and full of flavor. I was even able to pull out some of the bone marrow (salivating as I write this review). The fava beans had the best texture any smashed fava bean could possibly have. The hummus came out completely fresh. It was as if they just blended it right there and added the right amount of olive oil and paprika to it. And the bread, oh man, that deliciously warm and wheaty flavor held everything together. \n\nBack to that tea. Yes. I recommend this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-03-09", "description": "I found Yemen Kitchen in one of the weekly local Yelp mailers and as I had not had Yemeni food I decided to give it a try. A quick search showed that Salta ($10) is the nation dish of Yemen so I decided to get that using the ordering functionality on Yelp. Yemen Kitchen is located in the heart of the hood so after crossing two homeless colonies I landed there after almost 30 minutes.\n\nFor starters I was completely ignored even though I was standing right in front of the payment register. The cook and his helper both saw my presence but chose to ignore me and continued to complete the order that they were working on. After standing for a couple of minutes I sat on one of the stools. After about 10 minutes I was finally attended to and was made to wait another 10 minutes for my order to be made.\n\nSalta is supposed to be vegetables and roasted lamb that are cooked in a pot, topped with whipped fenugreek. The dish that I got seemed to match the description. The issue was that it was almost tasteless. The lack of seasoning was not balanced with the appropriate use of spices. The lamb also seemed to have been overcooked making it stringy. Along with the salta I was provided 2 store bought pita bread that they did not even bother to heat up before giving to me. Look I agree I'd never had salta before but this just did not feel right. My hunch was proven right when I tried the salta from Yemeni Restaurant, which was a lot better than what I got here.\n\nAfter the lackluster taste of the salta I decided to give Yemen Kitchen another change and this time got the Zanbaka Dinner ($10.00) which is fava beans and ground beef. After ordering it was literally an action replay of the last time, preparation started after I reached even though I had ordered ahead. The food was bland, but this time I was prepared so a tiny sprinkling of salt did the trick. Yet again I got the crappy store bought pita bread. The Zanbaka after proper seasoning was much better than the salta but still not a great dish.\n\nIf I had not had Yemeni Restaurant to do an apple-to-apple comparison I would have probably rated Yemen Kitchen a lot higher, but having made the comparison, the best that I can do is A-OK. I'm more inclined to go to Yemeni Restaurant whose food is similarly priced but is a lot better when I'm in the mood for Yemeni food.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

He would find the food to be so good that he would encourage the emigration of Yemeni chefs to the United States.\n\nA small group of us came here during our lunch break of a conference at a nearby hotel.  I had the reviews that described it a small, downscale place in the Tenderloin, but fortunately my two lovely companions (lucky me) were up for a culinary adventure.  The walk here in the midday really isn't bad at all.\n\nYes, it is small - very small.  There is a table that seats two, a table for four, a table for about six, and a couple seats at the counter.  If you're here on your own, expect to have new dining companions.\n\nWe started our meal with Yemeni bread and hummus and absolutely loved it.  Yemeni bread is a flatbread, served hot, that is perfect for dipping in the smooth, creamy hummus.  My companions split an order of the lamb aqdah, which was a smart move because the dish was huge.  I tried some of it and found the lamb to be tender and flavorful and the vegetables to be a nice complement to the meat.  I had the saltah, which I was told is sort of traditional or national dish of Yemen.  It's a kind of soup or stew made with lamb in a spicy broth topped with fenugreek.  I was warned that the fenugreek could make the saltah taste bitter, but I didn't notice it at all.  It was delicious.  I almost came back the next day for another serving but decide to try a nearby falafel stand instead.\n\nWe were all very pleased with our meal.

Let's just call it a 'rhinestone in the rough' because owner Abdul Al Rammah's dishes represent straight-up comfort food by way of Yemen. It was satisfying, no-frills fare well executed. Getting here can be a bit of a challenge for the uninitiated in the Tenderloin as it is indeed in the thick of the neighborhood on Jones Street. A small spot, it was formerly Brooklyn Pizza, and in fact the big sign in front still says so which likely confuses potential customers (photo:  http://bit.ly/1WiMUsU). Inside is a bit sparse with just three worn formica tables for seating. Two were already taken, so I sat down at the last one available.\n\nMeanwhile, I considered the sixteen-item menu (photo: http://bit.ly/1O7MeAH). Without much thought, I went for the most expensive dish they prepare, the $16 Roasted Lamb with Rice, but first the friendly server offered me a complementary bowl of their Lentil Soup which was warm, thick and clearly homemade (photo: http://bit.ly/1PtlnmF). The main dish arrived soon afterward, and it was a huge serving of tender roasted lamb, two large shanks resting on quite a large bed of rice with a simple salad of lettuce and tomatoes (photo: http://bit.ly/1TYllGF). I believe this would be called 'madi' in Yemen and served at holiday celebrations. It was no holiday for me walking over here, but coming back is an option I'm willing to consider.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...hearty comfort food that shows Yemeni like their lamb\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...not much on decor or comfort but it's clean\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...they looked genuinely happy to see a new customer outside their immediate community\nTOTAL - 4 stars...gird your loins and give it a try", "author": "Ed U."}

I've now eaten there probably a little to much for my own good, but dang it is great. The service was awesome and if your not sure what to order, just ask. I've tried the chicken and rice (awesome), the Northern Beans....great spice. The chicken kabob, great and the lentil soup. This place is very affordable and I can wait to go once again......and while you wait or eat, there is some very delicious hot tea......and did I mention the service.....Mohammad and one other guy that works there were so cool.

We had already eaten a disappointing dinner elsewhere, so we stopped by for a snack to save the day.\n\nWe split Yemen's nation dish: Saltah, a stew made with lamb, some kind of squash, potatoes, and a dollop of fenugreek froth. It took a little getting used to the bitterness of the fenugreek layer, but underneath was savory, comforting, stewy goodness.\n\nThe dish comes with this pita-like bread for scooping up the stew contents.

We ordered the lamb roast, beef stir fry, chicken stir fry and the bread because those had gotten the most positive reviews on yelp and the Chronical.  But we were also salivating at the dishes being served around us.  I am a Pittsburgh native,somewhat adventuresome because of it in my choices of cuisine.  but I am not yet to the kidney stage so we passed on those choices.  But the smells were to die for and the food....well most food reheated is not as good but LOVE LOVE LOVE this food especially the rice which reminds me of a favorite find in the Burgh.  Glad a fellow yelper told us about the Brooklyn Pizza sign although at eye level Yemen's Kitchen sign is clearly visible.  I can't wait to return and try other stuff.

The owner (?) and waiter welcomed me with such warmth. The owner (?) said, Are you looking for something vegetarian? I said, Yes. He said, How about the hummus? I made a face because I ate too much hummus in my twenties and am not such a fan anymore. I didn't say yes and I didn't say no, but I thought the fact that I didn't say yes meant I wasn't interested. I said, I'd like a bowl of lentil soup and the special bread. I asked for the special bread twice. I sat down, and the waiter brought me pita. I said, I wanted the special bread. He said, Oh, the special bread we make? I said yes. Next he brought me hummus. I was thinking, I didn't order hummus. I was thinking, I wonder if it's on the house because they want me to believe in hummus again. I was thinking, Maybe I should try it. I tried it. It was very, very good and much better than the hummus I made in my twenties. I loved the lentil soup--so chunky and tasty--and the special bread, which tasted even better dipped in the hummus. At the end of the meal, I said to the owner (?), I didn't order the hummus, but I did eat it. He showed me my order on which he or someone had written \"hummus.\" I am not sure how that happened, since I hadn't agreed to it. I loved being there, but I learned an important lesson.
