{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-12-24", "description": "SoMa could definitely use another neighborhood cafe, but convenient hours would also be nice. I rarely walk by when this corner cafe is open because I'm usually doing my strolling in the evening after I do my routine at the gym (like letting the elliptical do the work for me) or the weekend when I'm getting coffee at The Market (since I can't afford anything else in there). Even though it's relatively new, the vibe here is a lot earthier than its geographically immediate brethren, Peet's and Coffee Cultures, where most of the hipsters congregate.\n\nThat may have to do with the pre-packaged picnic food they sell here rather than the high-end pastries of which they have just a few on the counter. I came in for just a $2.25 cup of their House Coffee (photo: http://bit.ly/2BRrtzX) and parked myself at one of their high-top tables. It was satisfying for a pick-me-up before heading home, and I noticed the motley customers coming in and out of the store looked like relatively normal people unlike the anorexically slender, nose-ringed youngsters who frequent the coffee stops across the street.\n\nCOFFEE - 4 stars...a fine cup of joe\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...pretty spacious\nSERVICE - 3 stars...a bit indifferent but who cares\nTOTAL - 4 stars...the hipsters go elsewhere, 'nuff said", "author": "Ed U."}

They also had a variety of pre-made salad containers - however every single one of them contained pasta. So no leafy greens for me. Bummed out about the options, I grabbed a chicken on multi-seed bread with pesto and provolone.

This is fine, as long as they are serving a superior product. They are not. Slightly less burnt than Starbucks, but definitely more watered down. Strike one. \n\nAside from that, all seats are very hard and uncomfortable wood. Makes it tough to work in this environment. Strike two. \n\nThe two guys thinking that they are having an intellectual conversation very loudly, but really just repeating mindless nonsense and cackling loudly about it, well, they are annoying, but I understand that a business cannot necessarily control their clientele. \n\nHowever, on a very hot day in the city such as today, WHY IS THERE NO AC ON??? biggest offense and definitely strike three.

The coffee they handed me is dark and smooth with a slightly bitter finish. It's good, but not very impressive - average.

During the day it's fine, but it's one of those areas you tell your kids to stay away from during later hours. Metered parking and downtown traffic makes for a crappy drive - take the bus. In terms of the actual establishment, they have one large table that seats six, ten tables that seat one-two, a couple of couches, and some desktop computers if you don't want to use their free wifi. Not really crowded and plenty of seats. Location aside, I like the interior a lot.\n\nOverall: It's pretty out of the way for most people, even if the inside's a decent study spot.

I enjoyed the mochas. I especially enjoyed the \"Bring a friend and you both get free mochas\" special that they had when they first opened.\n\nLately though, when my coworkers and I have come here for coffee, we've been disappointed. For instance, yesterday, one of my coworkers picked up drinks for 3 of us. He brought me back a latte and he brought my other coworker an orange juice while he had a tea. \n\nI took a sip of my coffee and looked at him questioningly, asked, \"Ummm, what did you surprise me with?\" He said he just got me a latte, and I said, \"No! This is no latte... why is it salty?!\"\n\nThen when I said that, my coworker with the orange juice and I caught each other's eye and then remembered when 2 weeks ago, she and I came by for coffees but had to return her drink because her soy latte TASTED LIKE WARM FROTHY SALT WATER... it tasted even saltier than SOUP! When she returned it, she said that the person making her coffee did admit that their machine was acting funny. So why did they serve her?\n\nAnyway, I took a break from work to go and return my drink the same way she did weeks earlier. When I went in, I told the cashier that my drink was salty even though it was a latte. She and one of the other workers just looked at each other with puzzled expressions. They looked extremely confused with each other, then looked back to me and asked, \"Are you sure it's salty?\" Well of course! I'm the one who was drinking it!\n\nI told them to go ahead and taste it if they wanted to. Then all of a sudden, the two of them start speaking in Spanish to each other about why I was trying to get a new drink. No, I'm not trying to rip off the system - I just want a warm drink that doesn't taste like salt water! (By the way, in establishments such as this, I think it is EXTREMELY unprofessional for workers to be speaking to each other in a foreign language while conducting business. And I understood it anyway since I speak it a little bit myself.)\n\nWhat made me even more mad was when they asked me what did I want them to do? As IF it wasn't obvious enough... I told them I wanted a new drink. I don't know why, but the woman who started making my new drink said, \"If you want soy it's an extra 50 cents.\" For one, I never once mentioned wanting soy in my drink. And two, you guys are the ones who messed up my drink in the first place, and you should at least try to compensate for it! (You know, just a little something I learned from my hospitality classes when trying to make a customer's experience a little bit better.)\n\nI ended up with a cappuccino that was meh. Oh well.\n\nMy coworker who got our drinks told me that he never orders coffee drinks from there because they always seem to taste a little off. Instead, he gets drinks or food that don't require someone making them. I should have listened to him.\n\nI do have to admit though that their foccacias and their breakfast burritos DO taste very good.

Taking a bite, its well toasted, and topped with the appropriate combination and portion of lox, cream cheese, capers, and cucumber (though I sometimes go rogue and substitute tomato!)
