Expect to share your table with a cute granny and her all her grocery shopping bags because there are never enough seats! It's a tiny place with an equally tiny menu but the food is delectable.\n\nI love ngau lam meen (HK beef brisket noodles) to death, and it's not easy to find a place in the bay that serves just this dish. Yin du is my go to place for this. If you get the beef brisket noodles with wontons, you're probably gonna get only 2 bits of beef. If you don't eat the odd bits and pieces of tendon and other indistinguishable cuts, you're gonna get 1 bit of beef. So, if you love the stewed beef brisket, I'd advise getting a side of the beef brisket. It costs as much as the bowl of noodles (or a little more) but you can be assured of a plate full of pickings! \n\nThe charsiew rice is good too, and the curry fish balls are quite passable. Getting by with English alone you're gonna have to engage in some pointing and hand gestures, and come prepared with cash, it's cash only! \n\nTip: Hollywood bakery is right next door if golden gate is closed and you want some asian pastries. Another busy location with lots of grannies and grandpas who will stare at you unabashedly as you walk in wondering what you're up to today. It's quite cute.", "author": "Su Lin Y."}

The restaurant itself is tiny - I think there are 6 or 7 tables total and probably has seating for 20 people tops. They are definitely not shy about asking you to scoot over so that they can fit other diners at your table. Hopefully you don't mind eating with strangers! With all that said, I still highly recommend Yin Du! Where else are you going to get a gigantic bowl of tender beef brisket, wontons, fresh egg noodles, and flavorful soup for under $6? Do yourself and favor and order a portion of the tendon for the table - you get a massive plate of perfectly cooked tendon for $8 which you can then happily plop into your noodle bowl for an added oomph. I'm not sure what sauce they cook their meats in, but it's freakin addictive. You can add extra noodles for a buck, though I think the regular portion size is plenty. They have congee and rice options too, but glancing around it looks like everyone is here for the brisket and noodles.

This one is in the heart of Chinatown while Hon's is just a couple of blocks away. Yin Du is as traditional as you get. Let's start with the stinking open trash can on the pavement that welcomes you as you enter; the strong smell that hits you once you are inside; the busy ladies at the counter that ignore you till they finish whatever they are doing; the awkward look that you get when they hear that you want something to-go; the trepidation of sitting on one of the dirty sticky tables and finally the sigh of relief that slips your lips when you are finally able to leave with your order.\n\nWell at least it's cheap. Wonton noodle soup will set you back by a humongous amount of $5.75. Extra noodles are another $1, another 25c for the container, another 10c for the bag fee, plus tax and you still haven't hit double digits. This has to be the saving grace, its dirt cheap.\n\nTaste wise its fine. The noodles and broth are given in the same container so as long as you eat as soon as you reach home its fine, else these cheap noodles will suck up all the broth and become baby food. Wontons are also fine, not great but not bad either. It would be better to dine-in, which is exactly what I did during my second visit. Had a much better overall experience especially with the food, even though the serving size seemed a bit small. Overall it's not bad for a cheap fix, but almost on par with Hon's.

He was craving some seafood/fish congee which is how we ended up at Yin Du.\n\nNow let me start off by saying we were on vacation and had sights we wanted to see so we started our day early. I learned that Chinese restaurants in SF are not open around 9 - which took my by surprise. Yin Du technically opened at 9:30 but their door was open so we asked if they would serve us early and kindly obliged without any malice that customers were there early.\n\nWhile Yin Du didn't have any fish congee, we were more than satisfied with their Mixed Meat Congee and Pork Stomach Congee. We also had the Dry Wonton Noodle (comes with soup on the side) and Duck Wonton Noodle (in soup). I'm biased towards noodles with soup but Moms & my sister were very into the dry noodles.\n\nYin Du was so good that instead of trying a new Chinese breakfast place, we had Yin Du the next day too. It really reminded me of being in Taiwan and having a go-to noodle and breakfast spot. If my from across the sea parents approved that should tell you how good the food is here. PLUS shortly after opening at 9:30 there were others who came in that morning and ordered bowls of noodles for breakfast - a true testament to the tastiness of Yin Du.\n\nIf you're in San Francisco Chinatown definitely check out Yin Du!", "author": "Kim M."}

If you've been to HK, then you know that feeling of storeowners rushing you to finish your food and leave so they can serve more bowls to hungry folks. \n\nYin Du however, makes you feel welcomed, not rushed, and happy. \n\nCome here if you want your beef brisket noodle fix, if you're in chinatown and want a cheap place (&declicious) to eat, or if you're hungover :D \n\nBeef Brisket is just bomb.com\nI can't wait to go back and try the pork knuckles and tripe :P", "author": "Dana Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-04-17", "description": "We were looking for a place to eat in Chinatown, and decided on this Cantonese restaurant after reading a list of positive reviews on Yelp. We quickly rushed over before closing time at 7pm, and were promptly seated by the kitchen. The hole in the wall, no frills d\u00e9cor included two rows of tables stacked vertically along each wall leading to the open kitchen.\n\nThe Beef Tendon appetizer ($7.50) came in a small plate that was overcooked with little texture. Portion size was underwhelming, and pieces were too small to pick up. Way overpriced. Do not order this dish. I was surprised the restaurant had the audacity to serve it.\n\nThe Chao Huyet Congee ($4.50) came with congealed pork blood and rice porridge. There was a decent amount of pork blood, but the consistencies of the porridge was not the creamiest or tastiest. It was overall comforting, but better versions are out there around the City. \n\nFor the dried noodles, the server initially recommended the Wonton Noodles ($5.25), but brought us Dumpling Noodles (same price) instead. This dish came with three dumplings, egg noodles served dry, veggies, and clear broth on the side. The pork dumplings tasted decent but really lacking. The noodles were overcooked, leaving the diluted broth to be the only highlight.\n\nThe Wonton Noodle Soup ($5.25) came with five wontons, egg noodles, veggies, and clear broth. Two more dumplings than the previous dish was the major reason we enjoyed it better, which is not saying much.\n\nThe highlight of the night turned out to be the Chicken Rice Plate ($6.15/off menu). There was plenty of chicken in the stir-fry. The chicken was tender and delicious in the light brown sauce. \n\nIt was overall an affordable meal, but we also got what we paid for. Interested diners should be aware of their cash only policy--and their unethical business practices. This led us to learn about their bottom line when the owner refused to provide us a receipt for the dinner (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yin-du-wonton-noodle-san-francisco?select=1BZTtWWL6zvo-1gd2biU4A&reviewid=TT3f57QbJTO3Qsx_EyZRnA). He insisted this is common practice in Chinatown, and generating receipts would create problems for him with the IRS. \n\nIn turn, I then suggested to Santi to forgo tipping the restaurant, which prompted the restaurant owner to point his finger at the table, raised his voice, and demanded that we tip him. Once we refused again, he made the same gesture again, slam his palm at our table, and started yelling at us.\n\nIn hindsight, the restaurant owner essentially tried to nickle and dimed us with cheap ingredients, then tried to game the system at our expense, and then expected us to tip after we had been disrespected. I initially thought about tipping him for the theatrical outburst, but based on the food and treatment we should have received compensation for our suffering. We left the restaurant still hungry. \n\nTo be fair to the other restaurants in Chinatown, I have never experienced anything like this in many years of living in the Bay Area. Those visiting the City should consider the restaurants in the Richmond and Sunset neighborhoods. This was one of the worst treatments I have ever encountered. We will not be coming back.", "author": "Daniel L."}

I ordered the beef brisket and wonton noodle soup and we shared the beef tripe and the curry fish balls. The noodle soup was pretty good, but nothing too special, not amazing enough for me to go out of my way to come here. The curry fish balls were pretty good as well, I would probably re order this. The beef tripe however, I would not order again - it tastes better at dim sum places. They basically just boiled it and added some soy sauce on it.. \n\nThe Service and cleanliness was not so great either, but what do you expect? It is in Chinatown. When we came in, they were wiping down our table using gloves. But they also never took off the gloves while giving us our eating utensils, our bill, napkins  and food, so that was a little disturbing..", "author": "Bailey L."}

In most cases, you'll probably have to share a table with another group if you have 2 or less people around lunchtime.\nSupposedly their noodles are msg free, and I would probably agree as their normal broth doesn't really have much flavor. This may or may not be a good thing, depends on your tastes.\nIf you want a broth with more flavor, get the beef brisket noodle soup. The beef marinate gives extra flavor to the broth. I believe this is their signature dish.\nHowever, if you're a duck fan like me, you can get the duck wonton noodle soup. I always choose to get the fun noodles (flat rice noodles), and add extra noodles for $1.00. Total only comes out to be about $7.00 per person, throw in a few bucks for tip. \nLike most noodles dishes, even after stuffing myself during lunch, I'll be hungry again by 5 o'clock.\n\nIt's cash only here, and I usually have to have my friend order for me in Chinese, otherwise I'm not sure if my order will go through.", "author": "Mike O."}

Like most Chinese places in Chinatown, they share and split tables here so be warned if you're not used to this.  Ie like a couple may be sitting with a single person at the same table. Anyways their menu is pretty simple.  The same things just in different combinations with each other. Wontons,  two types of noodles,  soup,  beef brisket. So we ordered a wonton noodle and a beef brisket wonton noodle. And what came out was not whay I ordered.  Thus the 3 stars.   The wait staff is pretty informal so they didn't write down our order. Not wanting to offend them I decided not to fight it and just enjoy it. It was the beef brisket noodle soup.  The beef was tasty and there was a generous amount of it. Good split between between fatty and tendon pieces and straight up beef. I did get to try one of my friend's wontons. Pretty good. Also noodles were nicely cooked and al dente. And the soup was hot and had gpod flavor. They also brought put two cups of tea for us. If you want anything else, just have to ask.  The best part was its so cheap. 5 to 6 bucks for a good bowl of noodle soup. Cash only though. It filled me up pretty well but I could see aome guys being still hungry afterwards. Haha.

My friend and I ordered two bowls of noodles for around $11 (seriously can't complain about the prices), and we noticed that when the bill came they added in an extra $1.50. We assumed that was tip, since some places in Chinatown will bake in tip without telling you (which really makes me want to tip them even less). When we got up to leave, the waitress rushed over and tapped on the table, demanding that we leave an additional tip. When I asked her about the extra $1.50, at first she pretended to not understand me, then loudly told me it for the tea, which they had placed in front of without even asking if we wanted it. Not wanting to cause a scene over a few dollars, we gave her \"tip\" and left. After reading other Yelp reviews, it seems like the hot tea is supposed to be complimentary and the server lied to us.

When I came back, I was very surprised as they were standing at the intersection not far from Yin Du and waiting for me, in the rain.\n\nIf you wondered what happened: the place was nearly empty when my parents walked in, they first sat down at a table that was set up with 4 sets of utensils, then a guy (potentially the owner) working there asked them to move to a smaller table which had 2 sets of utensils on top.  My dad told the guy we actually had 3 and the other table might be too small.  The guy became really annoyed and started yelling really loudly that he will add another set.  Dad was shocked by his reaction and decided to leave.  Since they were not familiar with the neighborhood they stayed around to wait for me...\n\nMaybe something significant will happen to the restaurant when a group of 3 sits at a table for 4,  hence the yelling and screaming?

The noodles were good, they were bouncy and not soggy or sticking together in clumps. The wontons though, were a bit disappointing. Of the 6 \"shrimp and pork\" wontons in my bowl, 2 had shrimp in them. The other four were stuffed with maybe 3/4 tablespoons of pork. The ground pork was not flavored well. It still had that pork \"smell\" in the wonton. Also, because the wontons were small, you could taste and see all folds they had to make to keep the dumpling together.

No, not by itself, not even for Chinatown where greasy spoons and overpacked bakeries stand next to ornate imperial palaces fit for emperors...or at least fit for Martin Yan. And after all, Yan can cook but can Yin Du? Well, if Yin can't Du, then Yin could teach...like Civics. I'm sure that's how my 4th grade gym teacher Coach Fiorello got his job, certainly not because of his bad crew-cut. But I digress. Yin can Du a decent won ton noodle soup, but it doesn't blow out my cylinders. It doesn't matter that much since I have so few cylinders left anyway. Jamie W. and I came here because I noticed it has been earning some pretty consistent praise, and a praiseworthy noodle house is something to cherish. Like everyone says, I think its nearest competitor is probably Hon's Wun Tun House on Kearny, which isn't as clean-looking and awfully orange.\n\nBut I did make up lyrics to the theme song I made up for Hon's, which needs \"musical\" accompaniment by the old guy who plays that two-string fiddle on Grant. Wanna sing along? (review:  http://bit.ly/165c7j9). Yin Du needs a theme song or something to spark some excitement to dawdle over to this quiet stretch of Pacific. Otherwise, it's a fairly humdrum menu that in the right mood, may hit your G-spot. G for girth-growing, I mean. Noodle soups, noodle and rice dishes and a lot of jook (photo: http://bit.ly/Hitl30). I went for the bargain-priced $4.95 Stewed Beef Brisket & Wonton Noodle Soup mostly because it had the longest name which in my simple mind, meant more ingredients per spoonful (photo: http://bit.ly/1eLC1uT). Good, not great with just enough wonton, bok choy, and beef to meet the daily minimum belly satisfaction requirements. So Yin can Du and so can you, and he may not have to teach.

The boyfriend and I ordered the stewed beef and wonton noodle soup for $4.95 each! I regret not getting any noodles because the portions were on the small size, will remember for next time. The bf suspected his ho fun were packaged rather than fresh, but no biggie. The wontons were also smaller but tasted like fresh homemade ones with thin skin and firm filling. The broth and beef really hit the spot! I wanted to order some rice so I can have something with which to finish that tasty flavorful broth.\n\nWe actually ended up also ordering a plate of gai lan w/ oyster sauce, a rice plate with steamed spare ribs in black bean sauce, and a cold milk tea.  The gai lan was steamed well with a nice crisp still.  The rice plate was passable, more black bean flavor would've been nice, but still a pretty good deal for about $5. The cold milk tea had a good obvious flavor as well as a string sweetness from the condensed milk.\n\nThe entire meal came out to $26, including tip.  Staff is friendly and service is swift. Yelp has the closing time incorrect, Yin Du actually closes at 7:30 but many parties snuck in and still received service. \n\nCan't wait to come back and try out their duck and wonton noodle soup... and their congee too!

I didn't expect much in the way of service, and when no one caught my eye and pointed me to a table, I sat at the only empty one that had just cleared up. In fact, I was a little surprised when someone came to wipe my table and give me a cup of tea. After that, I ordered the standard wonton noodle soup, as an older chinese man came to share my table with me. That was a bit of a surprise, but we mostly minded our own business.\n\nThe soup came out pretty quickly, in a pretty large bowl (not as big as most Pho places, but it pretty big). Compared to Hon's Wun Tun restaurant, I'd say Yin Du wins on the existence of vegetables in soup, but loses as far as noodles, wontons and broth go. The noodles didn't absorb as much of the broth's flavor, and the wontons were much softer and ready to fall apart, compared to the chewier texture I like better.\n\nIn all, if you value price and a hearty meal over service, then this place deserves 4.5 stars!

When we walked in, we saw two big mounds of fresh wonton's being wrapped and, when we ordered our wonton soup, into the pot they went.\n\nThe gailan greens are young greens.  They came out perfectly cooked with the right amount of crunch.  The chef also does not overdress the greens with oil and hoisin as many Chinese restaurants do.  It's actually a healthy dish even after cooking it the Chinese way.\n\nThe thing I enjoy most about this restaurant is the owner.  As I left, I told him this place was so good he could afford to raise the prices a little (with rent, health insurance, labor, and material costs).  The dishes right now are between $4-$7/dish and they are located in the heart of San Francisco.  \n\nThe owner replied that a lot of elderly Chinese from Chinatown come here and can only afford that.  A business owner with a heart-what a rare find!  \n\nIn any case, come eat here to support this amazing business owner and encourage him to raise prices.  Him and his family work way to hard to just break even with everyday living costs.

We grabbed one of the empty tables and checked out the simple menu.  Soon after, someone brought over two cups of hot tea (oddly the tea tasted like coffee) but she was never to be seen again. With the open kitchen, we counted 6-7 at any given time.  Not sure what they were doing and a bit irritated that nobody came to take our order.  After watching them busy doing nothing, I told one of the guys walking by that we were ready to order.  We were going to order a few side dishes but given their speed, we opted for only a wonton noodle and a plain dumpling.  Good thing because neither was good so glad we didn't waste more dollars and stomach space at this place.\n\nTwo problems: 1) they didn't cook or rinse the noodles right so the broth started to get yellow from it; 2) the wonton and dumpling are so plain and generic that it's no better than what I can make at home.  When they are supposed (at least I thought) to be master in wonton, this is a serious failure.\n\nPrice is lower than other joints but you've been warned.", "author": "Gloria H."}

She tells her to go into kitchen underneath the counter let's say she couldn't find a bowl. The owner never stopped eating or got up to help.

My sister suggested Yin Du, calling it the \"best place for wontons because their food is so drool-worthy,\" to make me feel better.\nWe walked a short distance to get to Yin Du, and this place is a true hole-in-the-wall. Literally, amongst all the bustling markets and hoards of Asian grandparents looking for the freshest produce, it can be pretty hard to spot Yin Du and its rather small hanging exterior sign from the street\nWalking in with a partially stuffed nose, I could still smell the strong fragrance of the wonton soups and congees wafting from the back kitchen. The place was so clean, especially since my expectations were much lower than what I was given\n\n+ SERVICE: The owner of this restaurant is totally adorable! We walked in, and although the counter is towards the back of the door, he was super vigilant with greeting and seating us.\nSince we beat the lunch rush, we got to choose our table and he was fine with that. \nHe brought us tea, with a smile on his face, took our orders, with a bigger smile on his face, and brought out our food, with a HUGE smile on his face. And it wasn't one of those \"oh I guess I should smile out of courtesy\" smiles, it was one of those smiles that made you feel like he was a long-lost relative who couldn't wait to sit down and catch up with you.\nThe older lady isn't as friendly, but it might be because she doesn't speak much English from what I understood? I asked her for a refill on tea, but she came out with another set of napkins/utensils, looked at our table, stopped halfway, and headed back to the kitchen, eventually coming out with the tea pitcher. \nShe did bring out our bill, with perfect timing even with all of the lunch rush coming in!\n\n+ FOOD:\nokay when my sister was telling me how amazing their roast duck wonton noodle soup was, I thought, \"oh it's probably pretty good,\" but I definitely wasn't expecting, \"WOW THIS IS BLOWING MY MIND AMAZINGLY GOOD\" type of good\n+ ROAST DUCK WONTON NOODLE SOUP (10/10: A+++++++) and now we break down the dish into its components:\n- Broth: so extraordinarily flavorful. I felt A LOT better by the end of the day, even with my horrible cold (probably because I slurped all of it up, oops)\n- Noodles: they were so well cooked! chewy, yet not tough to the point where you wanted to spit them out and give up, which happens very often with me, the pickiest eater ever\n- Roast duck: SO GOOD. the pieces literally MELTED onto my tongue, something that I find rarely happens with Chinese roasted duck that can be so poorly cooked that the texture becomes similar to that of rubber. BUT NOT AT YIN DU!!\n- Wontons: I've had so many wontons from different places where either 1) there is little to no filling so all you're eating is boiled dough or 2) the filling is still frozen solid and not consistently cooked so you're basically eating a chunk of frozen meat, as the outside skin falls off\nHOWEVER, the wontons from Yin Du changed my life as they were so soft and delicious and it was like eating little bundles of joy, tightly wrapped into a soft dumpling skin\n- Bokchoy: there was only one, but it was boiled to perfection, so you wouldn't be struggling with a huge steam/leaf in your mouth\n\n+ OVERALL: Amazing authentic Chinese food. Super clean for a hole-in-the-wall restaurant. Friendly/passionate owners.\nAnd best of all? CHEAP PRICES. That's right! One wonton bowl was ONLY $5!

Occasionally I see people bypass those waiting and sit themselves by first disguised looking for friends etc. Some restaurant operators use this no-system system to sit their preferred customers or friends; I don't know if it is the case here or not. For sure without a name board, a lot more of my folks (some Chinese from mainland China are uncivilized) will jump the line if they find the opportunity.\n\nToday I went there with a relative. During ordering, I asked the order taker, the boss (I think, he tends the cash register and seems to manage the restaurant), if they have dip-fried bread stick (the kind of bread very popular for southern Chinese to eat porridge with). His answer, \"This is a noodle place, how could we have that!\" In fact, he sells porridge there, and in fact, a lot of even small restaurant sell those sticks.\n\nAfter we finished our food, we stayed on to talk. About half an hour later, the boss came over and said, \"When people come to lunch, you have to leave!\" His exact words, not edited, not polite. I then looked around and found, in this small restaurant, three four-seat tables and one two-seat table, empty!\n\nFinally, if I did not miss any sign, the restaurant never inform customers that all tables are shared; suddenly a stranger sit in front of you without asking! They don't respect people there.", "author": "Adrian W."}

The wonton noodle is very fresh and the wontons are hand made. Depending on the time of day you are there, you can see them make the wontons. The soup is very clear and isn't masked in fatty or MSG like some other places. The prices are very reasonable too. I tried a few other dishes, but if you aren't getting the wontons here, I think you are coming to wrong place. The place is pretty small, so I wouldn't recommend bringing a large crowd unless you get lucky and it's not busy. And remember to bring cash, CASH ONLY.

I headed in and was promptly shown to a table that I shared with another lady. The place is very bare bones, but absolutely immaculate.  The menu is pretty small, but when you specialize in Wontons and Noodles, you don't need a big ass menu offering a zillion different items.\n\nMy Wonton noodle soup with beef brisket came quickly, and was delicious.  The beef was a little fatty for my liking, but I managed to eat around the fat.  The wontons were so succulent and they were cooked perfectly, as were the noodles.  I am a big fan of Hun's Won Ton House, but I've always thought their broth was kind of lacking.  The broth at Yin Du was rich and very satisfying.  \n\nIn and out in fifteen minutes, bowl of soup and mug of tea came to $5, accompanied by friendly service.  \n\nWhat's not to love?", "author": ".Hon H."}

When I was growing up here, there is no such thing as restaurants like these.  The less you knew about how the food was prepared, the better off you'll be.  The open kitchen allows you to see what's going on with your food.  This is a rarity in Chinatown.  The people here are from my village, Thaisan.  Very honest and hard working people with the intent to give you the best possible experience.  The owner lives in the neighborhood which gives it that sense of ...........I must support the local businesses.  \n\nTo the food.....................It's good.  Not the best I have ever had but for San Francisco, this might be the best won ton house that we have to offer.  The broth was made the way I remembered when I was a kid.  My uncle used to own On On Wonton house in Oakland.  I personally thought they made it the best.\n\nThe items they have here is limited.  Get the beef stew wonton noodles.  They are known for that here.  I've tried the curry and the jook here is only ok.  Just stick to the wonton noodles and beef stew and you'll be ok.\n\nThe portions are on the smaller side but for 4.50 a bowl, you can order 2.  As for the price, believe it or not, it's a little pricey for Chinatown.  You are probably thinking 4.50 a bowl is pricey?  Yes, it is for Chinatown pricing.

There are some off menu specials and I've yet to try them, but I'm sure you could ask; I'm pretty sure its stir fried liver and kidneys with ginger and spring onions, looks like most of the tables are having at it!

Sits about 18 people. The place reeks of deep friend lard oil. And yes, it will get into your clothes and hair. So be prepared.\n\nService: quick. took us about 10-12mins to get our food. The cafe was about 70% full at that time. the guy serving us only speaks in cantonese. Not sure if the rest of the staff will be able to understand english. \n\nNoodles texture i would rate 5/5 considering this is the US. Really well balanced and springy. Sauce that was used for the  noodles was well-balanced as well and i think there was a good amount of lard oil used - which probably is the the secret.\n\nI would rate the beef brisket at about 3.5/5. Really tender, portions were really small but well seasoned.\n\nThe wanton noodles soup. Soup base was not bad, i think there was MSG in it. So i would rate the soup with a 3.5/5. The vegetables weren't overcooked and fresh. \n\nWantons - BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! the skin of the wanton was soft and thin - perfect! Shrimp was fresh! But the meat was terrible! It tasted gamey/ porky! It almost had a liverish taste to it. I expected the meat to be seasoned in some sauce with garnishes like water chestnut, garlic, spring onions but i tasted none of those. I tried subsequent ones and it just tasted gamier and gamier. \n\nWould i return? Probably and i would try the rest of the non-wanton dishes.\n\nBTW the establishment only accepts cash.", "author": "Smo S."}

Kitchen is open so unfortunately (or fortunately if you care about cleanliness), you can see how dirty the food preparation conditions are. The bowls and soup spoons were simply rinsed at the faucet and placed in a red plastic bin for the next customer (yikes, me). The bowls came with stains from the previous content (and previous users secretions). I was the one facing the kitchen in my party of four, so as I witnessed all this during our 30 min there, I quickly asked everyone to stop eating and we left. I should have known when we sat down, the menus are covered in grime. The conditions are pretty awful, reminds me of back country China, where one might eat in an establishment with dirt floors and poultry running around your bench. I think if this is what one is expecting, fine, eater beware. But this is San Francisco where there are food inspectors and restaurant codes, clearly not followed here.", "author": "Eric L."}

There are many other $4.95 noodle soup options too.  Therefore, price-wise it's comparable to Hon's on Kearny Street, but that place closes at 7pm and this one stays open for an hour later.  My friend and I decide that the wonton at Hon's a better but still this is a good new option.
