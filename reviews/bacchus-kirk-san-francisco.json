I had The Rose, which was a nice summer drink, super light and refreshing, and even for it not being happy hour, very well-priced! I think the total for 3 drinks came to ~$34 before tip. Music playlist was fun and dance worthy, and the pool table in the back was in constant use! They also allow dogs, so we got to meet a few cuties as we hung out there! Great location to be near to some good food places and bars, and such a generous happy hour of 2pm-8pm that I'll know I'll be back!", "author": "Marites S."}

So, after dinner we walked around a little more, took uber back to the hotel and decided to come check this place out.\n\nIt has a really cool atmosphere to it from the wood flooring to the fireplace to the red lights behind the bar. Even the bar itself has a really nice patina to the wood. Smoking is only permitted in a small designated area. It did not smell of smoke inside. \n\nThey have a happy hour from 4pm to 8pm every day with $4.50 draft beers, discounts on well drinks and specialty cocktails which are featured on the boards behind the bar. I ordered an Elysian Space Dust IPA on tap and my wife ordered a Pomegranate Margarita. Both of which were very good. The service was very friendly and efficient.\n\nWe sat for a while and reminisced about the days events before heading back to the hotel for the night. \n\nThis is my kind of bar to hang out.

Ai yah.  This is a terrific neighborhood bar for this particular neighborhood, which is Nob Hill.  Some would label it Lower Nob Hill, some would even go Tendernob.  People who call this the Tendernob are clueless.  \n\nBacchus Kirk is totally legit from a neighborhood bar standpoint.  Great mix of taps.  Cool local patrons.  Good Happy Hour.  And, I won't lie, I am not a huge cigarette smoker, but I know some people who can't go ten minutes without a smoke in their hand, and this place has the smoking porch.  They have a fireplace and a pool table, and it is always comfortable. \n\nYou will find this a place with a terrific bar that plays a lot of roles.  It's local-oriented, but this is an area where a lot of transplants end up.  The bar opens early and the Happy Hour is deep.  It got a bit more expensive lately, but I will attest to a $4.50 solid Draft Beer list.  \n\nThe people who come here are solid.  It's not fratty/douchy like some places.  It's full of pretty smart folks.  They have good bartenders from my experience.", "author": "Adam S."}

It's really crowded, though, so you need to get there early (like before 8PM). And good luck getting a drink! Our team missed 3 trivia questions that I magically knew the answers to but didn't want to lose my spot at the bar, and didn't go consult them. Boo!\n\nUnfortunately, this is often the case I've found at Bacchus Kirk. It's so crowded that it takes a really, really long time to get served, and it's also sometimes a million degrees in there, which is kind of accentuated by the red lights maybe.\n\nPros: There's a really good jukebox! And a pool table, which is a plus for some people. I like the fireplace and the kind of rustic look of the place...it reminds me of a lodge a little bit. There's a good selection of beer. I also love the neighborhood. And I do actually really like the lighting - it's just not great when it's already really hot in there.\n\nCons: As mentioned, this place gets PACKED. Sometimes the music is a little too loud - I think they really crank up the volume on the jukebox. And I tried to play a Massive Attack song one night and it came on when I was at the bar. Right in front of me, one of the bartenders said \"Ugh, I hate Massive Attack\" and changed it after only a few seconds of the song! I was really surprised...I guess partially because I didn't know they could do that and partially because I'd paid for the tunes. Also, I've found the drinks to be more expensive than I'd expect.\n\nAnother con: walk by the front door and tell me what the place smells like.

You should clean it up though, because the bartender and the bar back/bartender's friend are all really nice and don't really have time to be picking up your lost bits of sushi/pizza/spaghetti-o's. \n\nLastly, I owe Bacchus Kirk for introducing me to one of my favorite drinks. Fernet with a Ginger back. Silly me, the first time I tried it I was like oh, yum, dirt. Wonderful. Then the bartender at Baccus suggested I try it with a ginger back and hoo-ray, dirt taste be gone!\n\nSo everyone should go for the next quiz, Tuesdays (9 pm). I'll be on the team that starts out really good, then gets a little bit too silly and winds up blowing it. But maybe we'll win some day...maybe...if no one else shows up?\n\nNote: Next time I go I will try and figure out what the prizes and other pertinent quiz info is and update this review accordingly.", "author": "Tiffany S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-07-05", "description": "Bacchus Kirk represents one of the more artful interior designs I've seen in a drinking establishment. It's layout achieves the delicate balancing act of being artsy yet not arrogant, and hip while still feeling homey.  Whoever put  this place together took a dicey mix of decorative elements....ones that often spell disaster when used improperly, and managed to pull everything together in a truly impressive manner.  They tastefully used the ever-so-dicey medium of pecky cedar for most of the interior, but did so in a way that circumvents the almost inevitable pitfall of creating a space that looks like a re-cycled cowboy bar.  It's artfully mixed with several other minor nuances like tasteful lighting, evenly drilled angle-iron, and patches of older stonework left over from the bar's previous decorative schema.  A worn hardwood floor helps round things out with by adding a touch of mustiness to a well-rounded set of walls.  Music is young, hip, and not too loud.\r\n\r\nI got here several hours after France had eliminated Brazil from the World Cup. There was a easy going crowd in place, but seated patrons and place-saving drinks forced me further down the bar near a thirty-something guy with heavy tattoos.  A cute-as-a-button girl with French flag in her hair sat one more seat over from him.  French-flag girl was fairly tipsy, and tattoo guy seemed to be pretty attentive whenever she came around.  I tried striking up chitchat with tattoo guy whenever French-flag-girl drifted away, but to no avail.  He'd answer me in terse, incomplete sentences while doing everything he could to avoid eye contact.  The rest of the crowd was a good ethnic mix with mean age of about 30 years and a standard deviation of 4.\r\n\r\nDespite a somewhat cheery crowd, great decor, and a decent selection of drinkables, I caught an odd vibe from this place.  Maybe it was the soccer crowd, maybe it was just the vibe I got from tattoo guy.  Regardless, I saw my empty glass as reason to move along rather than re-fill.  Bacchus Kirk is a pretty decent bar.  It's a good  place for groups, a good spot to take a date, and a great local hangout if you lived in the hood.  But if you drop in solo, don't expect bubbly chitchat from the regulars right off the bat....and be ready to drink alone.", "author": "Mike W."}

Always up for exploring a new place, I trooped over after work with some colleagues to check out this local watering hole.\n\nI didn't feel like ordering any adult beverages so I stuck to water, but I was impressed by the 7pm happy hour start time.  I've never been a fan of rushing to get an early drink special so it was refreshing (ha ha, me so punny) to find a place with a more reasonable schedule.  All of my coworkers liked their drinks and the menu did look interesting, so I'll have to try one of the house drinks next time.\n\nThey don't serve any bar food which was extremely disappointing (those who know me understand how important food is to me!) but they have plenty of menus on hand of nearby places to order food from.  Chicken wings and curly fries were soon delivered and I was able to finally concentrate on the basketball game.  Bacchus Kirk has quite a few TVs spread about the room ranging from small CRTs to a very large showcased flat panel so finding a good view wasn't a problem.\n\nSince it was a Tuesday night, they had bar trivia start around 9pm.  I've heard of bar trivia before, but I had never tried it so of course I had to stay to play.  It was a lot of fun and pretty interesting...they had two random facts rounds, one musical round, and one name-that-celebrity photo round.  According to the surrounding people, it's better than the bar trivia at a lot of other places, so I'm glad I had a positive first experience!\n\nThe decor is unremarkable in a typical neighborhood sports bar kind of way.  Rather dark lighting, lots of wood, slightly sticky tables and chairs, and the requisite pool table in the back.  But the staff is unpretentious, parking isn't bad, and the crowd is a nice eclectic bunch with a mostly chill vibe.  I wouldn't mind returning to this comfy and fun bar...especially on a Tuesday night.  Bar trivia anyone?", "author": "Helen T."}

No fun, especially in heels.\n\nPrizes are $30 for first place, $20 for 2nd, $10 for 3rd and cans of nuts for 4th/5th place or for the team with the most clever name.

I stick with vodka and cranberry usually, and all the ones I was served here were perfectly fine.  However, my British friend who introduced me to this place loves that they serve Magnus cider (which tastes quite good over ice, really).\n\nLast night I tried the smoking room out, which I hadn't even noticed on my first visit, and it was interesting.  I appreciate its existence, but I don't see how it could be legal.  Oh!

And I won't even go into the loss I felt when they closed for the 2.5 days it took to re-finish).  They have a tiny little smoking room though I don't use it.  \n\nThe regulars: great group of people.  The non-regulars: for the most part, not too shabby.  \n\nThey have nuts and chips as far as food goes.  If they served real food, I'd REALLY be in trouble.  But there's plenty around if you want to go get some to bring in (or even have it delivered to you there) - and BK is very food friendly.  I usually hit up Cybelle's Pizza just up the street and bring a few slices in with me.\n\nOh, and they're dog friendly, too.  I don't recommend bringing them with you when it's super-busy inside, but otherwise feel free.

Give me my card back\"  She still refused and threatened to charge the $15 minimum charge on credit cards.  I then said I would call the cops in 2 minutes if she didn't give it back to me.

I really enjoyed the fire place and the warm atmosphere.\n\nThe hot Asian bartender was very attentive and by our conversations she seemed to be very intelligent as well.  The smoke room was very convienent because it was freezing outside!!  They also have a pool table and a nice selection of songs on the juke box.\n\nYou can bet I'll be back because I live just down the street... No DUI for me!", "author": "Scott O."}

They do have a fireplace which is nice in winter (it gets Burning Man hot in there at times) and they do have a pool table, which is part of the reason that I have made it my local home.  There is a jukebox with a good collection of music from the-grass-is-so-emo-it-cuts-itself type to your standard I-sing-about-jail-but-never-really-did-time Johnny Cash.  Crowds are always cool; I have never seen any fights.  I did see a couple of tools arguing with each other once, but honestly Asian ladies fighting over the same scarf at Marshall's are more vicious.  Oh by the way, the douche from the earlier review that got 86-ed because he did fight there, STFU.  Grow a dick and find another bar to flex your compensatory muscles at.  I'm glad you aren't at my local.  Anyway, I digress...there is a cool little smoking room just off the doorway which always has entertaining conversation.  As a warning the bar is a pub crawl destination on some nights (and who could blame em?), so crowds get a bit deep somtimes around 9pm, but come on, its San Francisco, get used to it.  \n\nI will say that my favorite nights to go are Wednesdays because of Mike.  Seriously, if Jesus Christ had taken up serving drinks instead of that miracle-thing, well he would have been a helluva bartender.  Mike run's a close second.  I love this guy.  No really, like serious bro-mance.  He always gets my drinks quick, knows what I want and is always in a good mood.  Plus he has cool hair - man is this going to be awkward next Wednesday.  Ok, ok...I also really love George (female, dont worry) and Fiona (she's sweet) and Pamela (she's Brazzilian and hot! My girlfriend is going to kill me...love you babe *meow*) and Siobahn who guest-bartends every now and again and well frankly everyone there...they are all between 3s and 5s on the coolness scale...10 being max.  Just kidding guys...dont spit in my Stella!  Seriously though, if you are looking for a local joint to shoot some pool and grab a cold one, this is your place.", "author": "Mark C."}

(Instead, I knocked over my beer and got into a yelling match with him.)\n\nThe problem is, this bar is great.  I love it.  It's chill, never packed, and the music is good. But the bartender sucks.  Not all of them, just that one.\n\nStill, I do recommend this place, but make sure you leave early if he's working, unless you want to be ushered out of the bar like a homeless person on a door step.\n\nWhat a shame.
