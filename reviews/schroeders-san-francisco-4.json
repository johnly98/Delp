This place needs to be featured on Gordon Ramsay's kitchen nightmares. Yikes.  Started with the soft pretzels. Specifically asked for no beer cheese. Got beer cheese.  These pretzels were microwaved from frozen. The texture and freezer burned taste were not appetizing. And as soon as they cooled down they were rock hard. Like not even edible rock hard.  \n\nOrdered a burger which came with tots. The tots were from a school cafeteria. The burger was over cooked and came with little side dishes of mayo and ketchup.  These appeared to have been pre filled and stored in a cooler. How hard is it to fill little containers of condiments to order.  These condiments tasted off. The only highlight was that the pretzel bun was not bad. \n\nI get that this is not a culinary destination, but this food bordered on inedible. I wouldn't even go there to drink the beer on tap because there's nothing edible to snack on. Come on Schroeders. A soft pretzel is not rocket science. And they are inexpensive to make. Charging $15 for two rock hard pretzels and a little side a mystery cheese is highway robbery. Even for SF standards. \n\nI'd stay away from this place.", "author": "Paul W."}

I do miss the older European style pre-renovation look but the new logo is pretty cute. Also, you can still get the extra large boots full of beer and well, that might be the most important aspect of this place for some people. Lots of beer in a very large boot and you can pretend you are in your own 'Beerfest'. Food-wise, I think it's pretty expensive but the portion sizes are pretty reasonable. I got the schnitzel with mushroom sauce and beets. Not enough sauce at all but I asked for more and they gave it to me. We got a side of the fried spaetzle, meh, I would pass next time. No flavor at all. \n\nNote, this place is located in central downtown/financial district so expensive is the norm. Also note that you will be surrounded by financial district patrons.

It was a time to celebrate a 2 day offsite and what better way to reward our hard work than over some German food! \n\nWhen you enter, you're greeted by a host stand to the left, a bar to the right and lots of picnic style seating throughout. I thought it was odd that although we had reservations, there was no \"reserved\" sign on our table when we arrived. Not a big deal at the time because no one was occupying the table but the joint filled up quickly and seating seemed to be on a first come first serve basis. Since only part of our party arrived at the same time I did, we kept having to tell people that our table is reserved while we waited for the rest of the party. The service overall was helpful and quick. There was a 'hmm' moment but overall, good service. \n\nFor starters, I asked my server to recommend a bourbon or whiskey drink and that I usually go for Manhattans and he immediately recommended the Back in Black for $12: wild turkey bourbon, averna and chocolate bitters. GREAT CHOICE for a drink! Tasted exactly like a Manhattan, which I appreciated. Here's what our table ordered for food: \n\n-Kartoffel tots for $7: a bowl of tater tots with a couple of dipping sauces. Nothing out of the ordinary, loved that it was nicely salted\n\n-Two Barvarian pretzels for $12: served with a Bourbon mustard and bier cheese. Although I love pretzels, this dish was WAY TOO salty. Even after scrapping much of the salt off, still too much. \n\n-Fried pickles and mushrooms for $9: I mean who wouldn't love this dish?! Served with a fill ranch dipping sauce, this dish went fast!\n\n-Kase Spatzle for $9: soft egg noodles in gruyere, goat Gouda and cream. Tasted like a boujie version of Mac and cheese. Not mad about it one bit.\n\n-For dinner we shared the Schnitzel platter for $55. 3 kinds of schnitzels-pork, veal and chicken, served with corresponding dipping sauces and pickled veggies. I had a chance to try the veal which I though was really good and the pork which unfortunately was a little too dry. \n\nOverall, I'd give this place an OK in my book. Not bad but certainly not top for me. I'd be open to coming back, and enjoying a cold beer, maybe during Octoberfest.", "author": "Rockne H."}

It's called, \"Schroeder's.\" Schroeder's brings the vibes of visiting actual German Pub by serving their traditional and modern German cuisines and endless of German style beers every year! The atmosphere is very active and ongoing as I welcomed there. The concept is much old fashioned, yet it does have a good, modern flare for this generation filled with classic designs and illuminating dimmed lights across the whole room. Much traditional for the wooden furnitures and interior walls especially the bar side too.\n\nThe employees here from servers, hosts, bartenders and cookers are doing a great job for making the customers like me an incredible service despite the busiest environment. No cons.\n\nNow onto the food and drinks! During the World Cup 2018 match for Germany vs Mexico on Father's Day morning, I ordered one of their World Cup food menu specials called, \"German Breakfast.\" It contains a Bavarian style Pretzel with two dippings: strawberry jam and bourbon mustard along with a side of baked potato. As a result, that German breakfast was pretty good cause the pretzel baked perfectly and warm. Perfectly seasoned thanks to the beagles style seasonings. Both strawberry jam and bourbon mustard also tasted amazing compared to Knobs & Knockers sauces in Sacramento. Homemade and crafted for perfection! For the drinks, I simply ordered a glass of Mimosa and that cocktail was quite refreshing! Not too strong and wonderfully elegant. I haven't tried their German beers so far after my first visit, so I'll be back in the near future for my next visit. I do know that some customers liked the \"Weihenstephaner Hef\" cause that beer tasted completely refreshing and amazingly bold. Interesting imported beer!\n\nSpeaking of the World Cup, their watch party coverage of the World Cup was simply energetic and magnificent! I really loved the visitor's reactions about the game between two competing countries of the world cause it makes more lively and entertaining! Of course, they also have good yearly holiday themes from St. Patrick's Day to Oktoberfest too!\n\nParking at Schroeder's can be challenging to park. You can park at nearby surface metered street nor the parking garage if it's available. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, Schroeder's is an unbelievable and striking local German Pub that I've discovered and visited right here in San Francisco's Financial District. Perfect for friends, family and co-workers gathering. A well received! My rating: 4 solid stars.", "author": "William L."}

Granted, there aren't that many German-fare pubs around, so if that's what you're seeking out, then this place technically ticks that box. Arguably, the food is \"fine,\" but given the city we live in, you can do a lot better than just fine.\n\nthe real rub here is the service we received. on a VERY slow Saturday, multiple elements of our orders were messed up (requested a salad with dressing on the side, got a salad drenched in dressing, had to send back, got served an incorrect beer, got served an incorrect entree ... sigh) in addition to the food getting messed up a bunch of times, the service was a bit salty-to-rude as the evening progressed. i understand that servers can be bored on a slow night, but that doesn't really excuse eyerolls, sarcastic retorts, and suggestions to \"just try it\" when asking to get an order that was incorrectly made fixed.\n\nwhen my friend's dish came with the 5$ upcharge of egg and sardines (he hates sardines), he mentioned this error and the waitress grabbed a side plate and asked him to just \"slide the egg and fish off the top\" rather than offering to re-fire a new plate for him. i mean really? even if that's all you're gonna do when you take the plate back to the kitchen, you could at LEAST fake it / pretend to remake it. \n\noverall, i wouldn't return, and I hate leaving a bad review for a place that's generally fine, but the crappy service really set it off. if the staff wasn't so icy and indifferent, it would've been a much different experience.", "author": "Vicki L."}

I am inclined to believe that they are not from bags of frozen assembly line production --- but I could be terribly wrong on that front. They are deliciously crispy on the outside while moist and pillowy on the inside. The accompanying dip served to enhance it even more (the mayo, not the ketchup).\n\nA buddy and I decided to order different wurst plates and split them as the sides were the same --- red cabbage, pickles, and mashed potatoes. We split the Nuneberger and the Bratwurst.\n\nThe Bratwurst might visually resemble your nathan's ballpark hotdog sausage, but it's anything but. The seasoning is subtle but pairs deliciously well with the mustard and pickled red cabbage.\n\nThe Nuneberger is shorn of any casing and strongly resembles a seekh kebab. It was lightly charred and served on a bed of German red cabbage, with a side of creamy mashed potatoes, with a few slices of gherkins. This was seasoned a little stronger and, in my opinion, much tastier than the Brat.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed them both, and will definitely be trying the other sausages too.\n\nOn a prior visit, I had the Kraut Burger. It was served with a generous bowl of crispy, moist, and delicious tater tots, and dips of mustard aioli and ketchup. I don't care for the ketchup but the aioli was the perfect match. The burger patty was medium done and moist, topped with a generous dollop of sauerkraut, and cheese. It too was delicious but paled against the sausage platters.\n\nSpeaking of the sausage platters, you can select more than one sausage for your main course and aren't relegated to selecting only one.\n\nI look forward to coming back soon.", "author": "Umesh T."}

Last evening, however, we were trapped downtown at rush hour, and literally could not get on MUNI to go home, so we opted for an hour at Schroeder's.\n\nIt was rush hour in there, too - the place was utterly packed, and we almost opted out - but we saw a few tables at the far back of the room marked \"reserved\" with times on them. A very kind server told us we could sit at one up until the time of the reservation, so we plunked down and had drinks (beer for hubby, a German rose wine for me) and the slider trio: turkey pastrami, corned beef and chicken schnitzel. The food was excellent and quite innovative in flavors. Service was superb, with just the right amount of checking on us - and an offer for us to take a small table if we wanted to stay past the reservation time on the table. Truly, the service could not have been kinder.\n\nThe joint was really jumping, and it was fun to see the crowd - mostly young men - having a blast, drinking das boot, and generally having the closest experience to hofbrau possible in our city. The menu is somewhat limited (I'd love it if they brought the sauerbraten back) but solid - there are several things I'd like to try when we go back for a real dinner, and not just a snack.

And the Hermann Richter murals on the walls are awesome, no doubt.  The beautiful wood throughout rings true its Bavarian heritage.  The beer selection is impressive for sure.  But the food, albeit quite good, at least this my first try, was not worth what I spent there.  \n\n$27.00 for a .3L Hefeweissen and a Jager (sweine) Schnitzle with mash pototoes, purple kraut and Gerken...for lunch...for one person...well....I was more impressed at Stein on Clement with the food frankly.  At least for the price. Again, I wanted to really love this place.  But even as much as I loved the decor, I wish that I had seen it before it was remodeled.  It is cool, but for my taste a little too hipsterish.

I felt the modern German food was too posh. Really salmon flatbread is German cuisine? Where's the pork knuckle I used to have from the old Schroeder's? Despite that I would still come here for a drink beer and watch important soccer games. There are two things I did like about the renovation. First and most important was that the old bar was still intact. Second inside the restaurant the seating feels more like a beer hall in Germany.\n\nAbout a month ago my boss had a retirement party here. Our party was at the back of the restaurant. After taking a further look the inside the restaurant I like the furbishing inside Schroeder's as the d\u00e9cor has the classic yet modern beer hall. My boss and our clients had a great time at Schroeder's. \n\nWhen I originally wrote my review of the renovated Schroeder's my rating, which was 2-star, was based on the lack of German food. However during the retirement party there were classic German food as sausages yet modern twists such as chicken schnitzel sliders and pretzel knots. The day before the retirement party I came to Schroeder's to eat for lunch. I even noticed that the menu wasn't posh but had some German classic food. (I know tater tots isn't German food but it's still delicious.)  Even though the menu has improved with all the different selection of beers I wish there were more items that would compliment with the beers that are served. If Schroeder's ever serve the pork knuckle again I would consider revising my rating. The old Schroder's served the pork knuckle that had soft skin. The type of pork knuckle I'm looking for has a crispy skin like the ones I had in Germany. If Schroeder's ever serves this this type of pork knuckle then I'll give this place 5 stars.", "author": "Gerald R."}

My fault is that I didn't complain to the manager when we left.

However, one of the ladies mentioned that there was a reservation for the rest of their party at 7:15 pm and we would have to move when they started arriving. NO PROBLEM. They were extremely pleasant and we thanked them. A few mins later, this hideous waitress comes over with THE BIGGEST, UGLIEST attitude and tells us, \"you guys are going to have to move because you are not part of this reservation!\" my friend was about lay into her when I stepped in and calmly said, \"we know that we're not part of their reservation but these ladies said it was ok for us to sit here until their party started arriving.\" The ladies saw everything and told the waitress it wasn't a problem. She stomps off. We're all looking at each other confused and horrified of how this girl treated us. So the party started to arrive, my friend and I moved over - no biggie. I saw the same waitress and asked her for a glass of water and that's when she really pissed me off: she slams the glass down as she stomped away spilling some of the water on the table.

It seemingly just improves every time and my most recent experience was incredible.\n\nI spent the day on the Rock with my family and friends which worked up a great appetite for dinner.  I called ahead to insure that our party of 15 would be seated when we arrived while we waited for our boat to bring us back to Pier 33.  Schroeder's was very accommodating and worked out a nice loooong table for us to sit at upon arrival.  In fact, when we arrived 30 minutes early, the table was already set and awaiting us.  \n\nOur waitress. Hanna, was fun, fast, friendly, and even spoke German!  She along with the rest of the staff tended to our needs the entire two hours we feasted.  The service for our parties size was top-notch.\n\nWe ordered the Vesperplatte, a combination of cheese, meats, bread, and other delicious items.  Everything on this tray was amazing!  If the platter had been made of something other than wood, I would have licked it clean.  We also ordered the Smothered Tots that are tatter tots covered in mushroom gravy, horseradish, cheddar, and pickled peppers.  Um, these were absolutely amazing!  The kids gobbled them down and had no clue they just ingested horseradish. :)  My only complaint was that we ate them too quickly.\n\nThe menu is filled with many German selections from schnitzel to wurst.  My wife selected the J\u00e4ger Schnitzel and said it was fantastic.  I was looking for something I have not yet encountered and discovered the Kasekrainer that is your standard pork sausage filled with garlic and Emmanthaler cheese, one of my favorite cheeses.  When I asked Hanna what she thought of it, she replied, \"It has cheese in it, that's all you need to know.\" :)  She was absolutely right.  It was one of the best sausages I've ever had!  If I never find this anywhere else, it will be my staple at Schroeder's for certain.  The mashed potatoes, red cabbage, and kraut that accompanied the wurst was very good.  Oh, the mustard that topped the wurst was crazy good as well.  Everything was cleaned off this plate.\n\nOthers orders ranged from franks to burgers and everyone - and I mean everyone - was very impressed with their meal.  That's a 15 out of 15 from ages 4 to...well, matured diners. :)  My beer, the Andechser Doppelbock, was great and the flights were well enjoyed by the two ladies at our table.\n\nNow, if there would be any complaint about Schroeder's it would be one and it really is more silly than a compliant.  I spotted German Chocolate Cake on the menu and it is a disappointing thing to find on a menu of a German establishment.  See, this dessert isn't German.  Not even close.  It was invented by an American baker whose last name was, you guessed it, German.  Generally, caramel and coconut are not ingredients you find in German desserts or sweets in general.  I just found this interesting since everything else on the menu was pretty spot on with common German food.\n\nThe atmosphere was great, the food amazing, the staff incredible, and the experience well worth your visit.  Any native from Germany will be comfortable ordering off the menu while they enjoy a little bit of home in San Francisco.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-31", "description": "The atmosphere and staff are pleasant, but both beer and food are vastly overpriced. The k\u00e4sesp\u00e4tzle (a German dish similar to mac and cheese which is sometimes served with a light dusting of breadcrumbs) was 50 percent breadcrumbs and bereft of any taste. The staff kindly replaced it, but the second one was little better. We were then not charged for the dish, but ultimately would have far preferred just to have been served something palatable.\n\nA litre of local beer served in a German-style Maas beer glass will set you back at least $18 apiece, with a German beer costing you about $24. Pretty steep by any standards.\n\nThe interior is akin to a German beer hall, but you pay an exorbitant premium for it.", "author": "Alex W."}

I was hanging out with some family in the City and they wanted to try Das Boot beer, which probably has about 33oz of beer in there.  To order the beer boot, you would have to put down a $50 deposit in case the glass breaks -- which totally makes sense.  \n\nWe ordered a few plates to share.  The chicken wings weren't that great because it tasted like it was boiled before being thrown on the grill and covered in the sauce.  I personally wouldn't order them again.  \n\nThe bratswurst sampler was pretty neat.  They had 6 different types of brats, which all had unqiue flavors. If you want to try the different brats, this is a good platter to try.  However, I wasn't thoroughly impressed with them.

I checked out the lunch menu online and joined my two German pals for lunch there today.  I was happy to see in the passing of 3 years the luncheon menu had changed and expanded.  My tummy was very pleased with the Schnitzel that came with mash and red cabbage.  The charred lemon was the best touch, juicy tartness on the crisp (but not at all greasy) schnitzel.  The little pot of condiment was a weird touch to me, the wait said it was made with raisins, it had a hint of sweetness but I did not use it as it seemed not to compliment the dish.  ymmv.  One companion had the same dish and declared it yummy, she did ask for salt, and I confess, it added a boost of flavor.  Our third member had the frankfurter (being from Frankfurt herself) and she gave me a taste.  Yum, nice snap to the casing and the sausage was *very* tasty! Will have to come back and have a plate of my own.  So, from a 2 star review back up to a 4, a decided improvement.  \n\nService was prompt and pleasant.  We were also not rushed out as we lingered chatting.  They gave us the bum's rush by diming the dining room lights.  Which was totally fine.

All that said, they did manage to keep, and incorporate into the new look/feel, the old wall paintings.  All in all the remodle is pretty fab for this space.\n\nThe menu has undergone a similarly satisfactory renovation.  The mixed pretzels starter may be heavy on starches (and likely more gluten passing into your system than german troops went back into the Saarland) but this is essentially a comfort food menu- so get over it.  The tastes of the breads and the mustard & butter condiments was heavenly.

It was good stuff but rather premium priced for the paltry portion. It was just tongue after all. Everybody has one. But the find of the evening turned out to be a retro throwback, the $6 bowl of Kartoffel Tots which must be German for \"Tater Tots\" (photo: http://bit.ly/1ycmHjA). It came with two ramekins of dipping sauces, ketchup and an aioli. The perfect bites - piping hot, crispy on the outside and surprisingly light.\n\nBut wait, our late night snacking is not over. We were tempted by the dessert menu our waitperson (...there, I got it) casually left on our table. We immediately went for the $7 Pfannkuchen, which were shards of crepes dusted with powdered sugar, decoratively layered on a plate with a line of bushberries and covered with a dollop of white chocolate cream (photo: http://bit.ly/1Gwc3KJ). It was quite a pretty little plate of sweetness, very Bavarian in style and gobbled up in seconds. So this is the new Schroeder's, eh? We likee, we likee. We'll need to come back and try the Wiener Schnitzel, the Kraut Burger and...oh my God, they have Currywurst? I had that four times in Berlin. I love currywurst. Before the drunken patrons start singing songs of the Fatherland, we may have to come back very soon.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...bar bites with a nice German twist though the biggest hit was the most familiar, tater tots\nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...sleek, chic...like an Elizabeth Arden makeover of an old hausfrau with a wart\nSERVICE - 4 stars...quite friendly waitress...I mean waitperson\nTOTAL - 4 stars...the Schroeder's facelift is much better than Renee Zellweger's", "author": "Ed U."}

I am a huge fan of German food and I wasn't disappointed.\n\nI came here with 3 girl friends and we ordered a smorgasbord of apps and split the sausage platter. We had the loaded tots, the crab, the beets, spatzel, and pretzel knots. The crab was great, but a small portion. The beets I would skip -- pretty pointless to order roasted beets for $10+. The loaded tots are wonderful and so satisfying. The pretzel knots are also a skip -- they should have offered it with some sort of cheese sauce instead of just butter and mustard. The standout was the spatzel, it had bacon bits and cauliflower. \n\nThe sausage platter had 4 different types of sausages. I don't remember which was which, but we enjoyed it.

No biggie, we keep our convo to PG-13 but I went to the restroom (super clean!) and came back, only to find out that my neighbor took my napkin. Good ice breaker huh? ;-)\n\nYou'll pay a little bit more for your food since it's in the Fidi, but the \"california\" style German food was a bit of a stretch for me. Their version of currywurst has red cabbage, sprouted lentils and chutney. Um, delicious but too busy for me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-04", "description": "This is one of the few German restaurants in San Francisco and it's located in the Financial District. You would probably think a dining setting like Schroeder's would be overpriced -- given its beautiful art-lined walls and atmospheric lighting--but the price was, overall, very reasonable.\n\nLet's start off with the restaurant's atmosphere and decor. The place is modern and cozy, in that the beautiful wood tables and top-notch mise-en-scene is paired with the familiar appeal of a stereotypical European restaurant, with its huge murals, heraldic shields and stuffed deer heads. Case in point, my favorite part of the interior: the big circular light fixtures with warm toned light-bulbs that emulate medieval chandeliers. I also love the long dining tables--another updated European concept--that provide a good hangout spot for a big group or party. \n\n If you want to reserve a table for a big party, you can call in ahead of time, and they will send you a form to fill out details. Your credit card is needed to hold the reservation in case you don't show up. They have private party option available as well, but there is food and beverages minimum. P.S. They are fast with emails for any inquiries. \n\nDrink! I got Pur Coincidence Cocktail $12 (Pur pear liqueur, pur elderflower liqueur, scrappy's habanero bitters, and lime). Not bad, though I really need to mention that the bitters in this drink burned their way down my throat with every sip. Not that that's a bad thing. \n\nFood! Smothered Tots (5/5) $14, definitely recommend! I get amazed when chefs can make something common like potatoes into a great dish. It was crispy, flavorful and colorful! \n\nRoasted Bone Marrow (5/5) $15. This was my first time trying bone marrow, and I was not disappointed! Rich fat and juicy jelly-like marrow paste; pairing with the warm toast, great! \n\nSmoked Chicken Wurst (4/5). Delicious! Meaty with just the right amount of fat, not too oily. If you do want to try the wursts, you should get two instead of one. 1 for $18, 2 for $23. Might as well.\n\nKraut Burger (4/5) $15. The only thing I have to complain about the burger would probably be the house made buns. The bun was a little too dry and hard, but the meat, however, was very juicy and cooked to perfection. The sauces that came with the burger were also great! \n\nSchweinshaxe (Ham hocks) (1/5) $22. I was actually really excited to try this because I've had German ham hocks a while ago in Europe, but it turned out to be nothing I expected. The ham hock tasted just like the leftover lean pork in a broth stock. It had little to no flavor. The lentils might have made it worse. The combination is essentially baby food. Mushy.\n\nOverall service was good. I think the waitress can do a little better with the ordering. Bottom line is Schroeder's worth visiting again.", "author": "Tammy C."}

The entire night was fun and crazy like we were really in Germany.\n\nBut the spaetzle...  You German bastards.  Curse you for exposing me to this culinary delight when I live 100 miles away!  For those thinking I'm making this up, let me tell you about it and maybe you can understand.  Tiny dumplings, lightly dressed and tossed with corn, tomatoes, ricotta, and bits of heaven.

I came here for the World Cup viewing of Germany vs Portugal and found a fairly large place - first part is a beer hall with the typical long, wooden tables and benches. The back holds the restaurant with an open kitchen. \n\nWhile the interior is impressive and gives the restaurant a very modern look I'd call it German-style restaurant rather than a traditional German. It's definitely a nice pick on German-inspired dining (and drinking). Since the game started at 9am I didn't try the beer selection (and you call yourself German, Sebastian) but instead had the breakfast. Sadly, that was a bit disappointing - for $20 I got a rather small portion of scrambled egg with a Bratwurst. Both the egg and the Bratwurst looked a bit lost on the large plate. My friend's Bratwurst was even undercooked. $20 for that? C'mon.\n\nI'll be back to check out the dinner but so far only 3 stars.

Don't get me wrong, the food has always been good, but their latest menu really highlights German food at its best. \n\nWhat we ate:\nRoasted Beets with mandarin, goat cheese, pumpernickel, horseradish\nK\u00e4se Sp\u00e4tzle with bacon, cauliflower and herbed bread crumbs\nWiener Schnitzel (a la hostein) made of veal, potato salad, cucumber, dill and an egg on top. \n\nNot only did I pig out on the apps, but the schnitzel was so big and hearty that it went home in a doggy bag and served as breakfast the next day. With another egg, of course. \n\nWhen chef Manfred came out to greet the table, we gushed about the food. He probably thought we were pandering to his creative tendencies, but it was no joke. The food was amaze.\n\nA good German girl likes all German food; however, I've never been a German food fan until now. The winter menu has completely changed my mind!

I ordered it... took three sips, and left the rest of the $12 cocktail there - albeit there wasn't much left because it's a rather small cocktail. It tastes very sweet (no spice to it) - kind of like mildly alcoholic koolaid, so if that's your thing, go forth and prosper.\n\nBut what was criminal was the jager schnitzel. It came out and was beautifully plated. I dug in. Unfortunately, it was lukewarm (not piping hot) and extremely thin (all breading, no piggie). It might have been delicious about 10 minutes ago but had been clearly sitting around for a while. Perhaps this is service's fault. I'll give it credit though; the mushrooms and kugel surrounding the meat was delicious.\n\nAlso had pickled veggies and the potato pancakes (which WERE hot and were pretty darn good).", "author": "Sylvia L."}

This place is old as balls, but in a good way so you never feel like you're the crypt keeper of the bar scene when coming here.\n\nIt's like, you could go to a hip, hot new young people bar and it's like the Demi Lovatos and Taylor Swifts and whomever else is young and totally outside the realm of my understanding why they're popular.

It's not a standout kind of place but from what you can remember it's not offensive and a part of it will remind you of a really old version of your dad, young version of your grandpa, or any of the first few seasons of The West Wing (I still miss you every day, Leo McGarry!). \n\nI came here on a weeknight with some ladies for some forearm sized pale German beers and some filthy girl talk and had a pretty damn good time, considering the general level of exhaust we were all feeling. \n\nThe girl behind the bar was a fox, the beer was crisp, and the older gentleman sitting next to us was visibly uncomfortable by our conversation but still intrigued enough to continue to listen in intently and not leave when he finished his beer. It was nice because I felt like a whipper snapper in comparison to the general weeknight crowd and refreshing to see someone look at our conversation in the confused and disgusted way that I look anyone who's under 26.\n\nInside there's a nice big bar and classic German beer hall communal seating with kitschy paintings of busty lederhosen-clad women and the sweet smell of encased meats as far as the eyes can see and the nose can sniff. It great for groups, it's not hyper trendy, but it is a great place to grab a seat (Yay for not standing-room only!) and a beer and have a classically under-rated good time.", "author": "Candice G."}

Great potato options! I suggest the loaded tots and potato pancakes. My coworkers and I also ordered a sausage platter, some were good but others were not my preference. The platter was also a little pricey too. \n\nAmbiance\nI've never been to Germany but a few people in our group said it was a pretty good attempt of a replica. They had older men (late 50s) come and perform on a Friday night in authentic gear. It was pretty cool. \n\nService\nOption to go to the bar or have a server come to your table. Overall they are pretty fast and going to the bar wasn't a hassle.", "author": "Brittany S."}

German bar with no J\u00e4germeister ???  \n\nbut than i saw the new owner (or at least that bartender told me that is the one)  ... \n\nAsian guy! and he was running with orders and drinks on the floor, where 3 chicks on the front desk were simply doing nothing \n\nso... my opinion ... i miss good old Schoreder's. \nIt became just another bar. I might swing by there once more, but there are soo many more places that have a character and this one just lost it in translation.", "author": "Alex S."}

I love the inside vibe and look forward to coming back with the guys.\n\nThe beer selection was good, the tots were great, and the bratwurst was something I'd order again but not spectacular. The red cabbage and sauerkraut had way to much salt but luckily the mashed potatoes and pickles were excellent. Respectfully, the cooking staff should eat at Suppenk\u00fcche to see how great authentic German food can be.

Sounds about right...\n\nThe waitress kindly provided me several gluten-free options, and I ended up with the burger (no bun) and potato salad, which was delicious.

While after renovations the food menus have improved, I wouldn't say I would come back for the food.    The Beer though, that's a different story, still consistently good. \n\nYes before the renovations the place was very dark.  Food choices also was not great, but typical pub fair that you would expect at a German beer bar.  The place has now been transformed with beer all tables and bright candle style lighting.  Does make one feel like they are in a Beer hall in German, kinda... \n\nI say kinda, because we're still at the heart of the financial district.  And you can tell they really try to cater for that audience.  So while the thoughts of making it look like a traditional German beer hall is there, it does feel very much falsly put together and not quite right.  \n\nThis also comes down to the food.  While the food is good. It wasn't specular and amazing. A companion of mine loved German food, but he didn't find much of what we ate that day authentically German.   \n\nThe Spatzle was very American, very much more like a mac and cheese.  The Potato pancake was more like a hash brown.  The Schnitzel was very crispy and good.   Overall the food was good, but you can tell it was done so with a flare to cater towards the American Professionals working in the area. \n\nThe beers are still great.  It's still a great place to get a boot of good beer.   I'll be back for the drinks.", "author": "Maggie F."}

I can't speak for the food menu, but the beer selection is slightly better than it used to be but at almost twice the price. Before the renovation, liter beers were $12, now they're $18?

After many visits to the new incarnation,  I feel it's time.  \n\nI loved the Old Schroeder's.   A lot.   Old Schroeders was the alterna girl you knew Sophomore year who was sneaky hot.   Behind that mess of unkempt hair were beautiful brown eyes and cuteness that the masses didn't quite appreciate.   A spitfire in a New Order T-shirt.  She was friendly.   She was cool.   And the secret not many people knew:  she was hot.\n\nThen the first day of school Junior year you came back and she rolls in with a new look.   Blonde hair cropped shoulder length,  guess jeans and a bitchin new purse.   All the sudden the jocks start to pay attention.   Before long she's the girl all the guys long after.  She's still the same nice girl you used to know, and by no means has she written you off,  but she has some new friends now -  and some of them are pretty douchey. \n\nSo what do you do?   Do you go too-cool-for-school and write her off a as a sellout?  Tell everyone how she used to be so \"real\" back in the Doc Marten days,  but now is stuck up?   Or do you accept that despite the fact that the secret is out,  she's still your friend and probably hotter than ever. \n\nSchroeder's is that girl to me.   I loved her before, but I'll admit  that she's looking better than ever.  Fun communal tables.   Massively improved food.  Huge projection TV screen for sports.  Friendly waitstaff.  But despite all that,  she hasn't lost what made me fall for her in the first place -  the murals, the boots,  the beat up millwork that has seen decades of patrons drink and dine in its warm glow.   She's a warm hug after a hard day of work. Just as she always always has been.\n\nShe may not be just mine anymore (before it was half empty -  now I have to and get there early for a seat),  but I love her still the same.  I may just have to share her now with the masses.  Five stars.", "author": "Cully W."}

If we were told that we have to order xyz, we happily could have; ordering wasn't an issue we just wanted to settle a bit before we could think about it.

Now I have an idea.\n\nThe new look of the place is good, the atmosphere is good, and the staff is attentive and professional. Yet to call the food Germany is to dishonor Germany. \n\nOur whole table of four ended up voicing our complaints to the manager. He seemed like he had a speech prepared, like he had heard this all before, and did his best to try to describe to us what they were doing with the restaurant. To be hipster friendly with a California lean style to German food is pretty much what we were told. As well as if we didn't like what they were doing here are the names of two other German restaurants to go to so we can find what we are looking for. \n\nWell when I go to a German restaurant I expect German food! Not what was presented to us. It is clear that the chef doesn't know what he is doing. I shouldn't get up from the table feeling hungry for the price of the meal I paid for, which was what happened.\n\nI'm more disappointed than I am angry. I expected German food, and instead received extremely overpriced hipster styled food. You have to first be cool and be of quality to do that. I was told the menu is seasonal. Hopefully when the menu changes again it  will get changed to something that resembles German food.\n\nAt the end the Manger took off half of our bill and wished we would try them again. I might come back for beers and beers only, yet I am not going to order any more food from them until they can provide evidence that they know and understand what real German food is. \n\nEveryone that went was really looking forward to getting German food.

While I'll allow that any bar with a Das Boot is killer, here's the facets of the OLD Schroeder's I am very glad to see changed:\n\nThe floor: they have one now! And it's polished wood, not linoleum with potholes in it that went clear down to the basement.\n\nThe \"food\" at the old place was rancid meatballs and frozen vegetables. There's a real reason it was free. The new menu is insane; the best of the kitchens of Bavaria and CA. I'll admit I'm partial to German food, but their take on the cuisine is perfect: not too much vinegar and heavy sauces, the right leavening of California flavors, and more than enough fresh ingredients and creative preparations. Only food of its kind in the City.\n\nThe alligators in the bathroom. Yes, I'm pretty sure there were alligators in the old toilets. Never stuck my head in to verify, but I definitely made eye contact with a malicious aquatic reptile following a reading session at the old Schroeder's. Terrifying. New bathrooms, clean facilities, and like the rest of the place: updated and modern. Whew!\n\nThe \"service\". Gotta ask, where exactly do these Yelp reviewers come from that preferred the old staff?! What exactly is viewed as \"good\" service?? I don't know who considers it a fun-filled night to get yelled at by grumpy life-term bartenders, then to be delivered a bill that contains charges (cash only, naturally) that are double the amount of beers consumed. No, I'm not exaggerating, this happened three to four times to me and at least as many to more than a few people I know. If getting into a shouting match with that grouchy, sullen old manager in order to avoid getting charged up the keister for phantom drinks is your idea of fun, well, then, the NEW Schroeder's isn't your style. \n\nAnd finally, the beer hall itself. The good parts, I mean. I work in Munich for a chunk of each year, and THIS is what a beer hall looks like. They kept all the great old murals, the old wainscoting, the old taxidermy, basically they kept the historical lifeblood of the place....and updated and polished everything else. And thank God for that. Long, blonde wood tables, chandeliers that would be at home in any Braustube, benches, sexy lighting. The hall got the best kind of facelift: removing all blemish and leaving what made it special in place.\n\nThis place is the real deal: It's crowded, it's noisy, it's fun, it's a damn beer hall.

This is my new go-to restaurant + bar.\n\nThe food is terrific - don't miss starting out with the beets, spatzle, and brussel sprouts... and not necessarily in that order. The bratwurst and wiener schnitnel are delicious also, just save room for the black forest chocolate for dessert! The dishes sound familiar but are every bit new and exciting... much like the rest of the space.\n\nNothing beats a Derby Radler from the bar menu, though from the looks of the beer garden... a boot of beer gives it a good run for it's money!  I'm pretty sure it's the perfect compliment to a World Cup match and a prerequisite of all German patrons.\n\nBig fan of the new renovation, it kept the character of the old Schroeder's and updated the rest to be the full-service beer garden it always wanted to be. The staff are super helpful and knowledgeable of the menu, trust their recommendations. My favorite is their new wardrobe - it's equal parts refined + classic, in homage to the original crisp white shirt + black-tie wait staff back in the day, but are newly casual complimented by the pinstripe aprons or suspenders over plaid to add just the right amount of modern California.\n\nSuper stylish all around.

I was pleasantly surprised that the space actually re-images the look of a typical, Bavarian beerhall: long tables, big hoop chandeliers, etc.--all with a very clean/modern approach. The long tables are cleverly transformed into smaller seating spaces by the use of planters that turns a table for 12 into a table for two within seconds. They've done a nice job of maintaining the old German-style paintings, which were a great source of charm. And I'll admit the old Schroeder's was getting a little grungy; the new place is clean and very stylish. So as far as the remodel: good job!\n\nNow, onto the topic of food. I was very pleased to see that many of the old favorites were still on the menu. I ordered the Bratwurst and sauerkraut with great anticipation! However, the Bratwurst was on a hotdog roll and the sauerkraut (on top of the Wurst) was cold--ala a brat like you'd get at AT&T Park. I'll admit that it was good, the brat was perfectly cooked! But like the re-model, the German cuisine is \"re-imagined,\" bearing little resemblance to the original. The potato salad was also very nice, but nothing of the sort ever left a kitchen in Munich.  No salt or pepper on the table.  The condiment on the plate was ketchup (with a BRAT?!)\n\nFinally, unlike my fond memories of the old Schroeder's, not a soul speaks German anymore; which is too bad.  But the service is fast(er) and friendl(ier), so that's a good upgrade.  \n\nSo there are pluses and minuses. I'd go back, but I'd love to see just a few of the old menu standards done in the authentic style.", "author": "Bill M."}

We ordered 3 beer selections and the smothered tots, which we really liked. I thought the tots were a good serving and had good flavors, though slightly overpriced. After the good tot experience, we decided to go with the chicken schnitzel sliders (3 for $12). We were instantly disappointed. Chicken was thin and overcooked, with a miniscule helping of coleslaw inside. They were tiny, but ok, we are in the FiDi, I get it. Had they been tasty I would have forgiven the size. Dry, overcooked and a total rip off! A terrible follow up to the tots that were so enjoyed! Can you really go wrong with tots though, we asked ourselves. Yes, yes you can. At this point, we sought to settle up with our server nowhere in sight. We asked for the check 2x from a busser. A new server took over our table, finally bringing the check and asking us to look it over to make sure it was ours.

Obviously people have different experiences and they do have a huge staff and yada yada yada, but each time I've been, nothing but solid customer service, delicious food, and overall just a fantastic lasting impression.\n\nLet me break it down for you.\n1)Solid customer service: very attentive even in the bar area and ready with great suggestions, but most of all flexible and accommodating. Example, my buddy and I asked to move around the bench area about three times because we wanted to get better views of the game as the tables cleared and Nicole our waitress was totally cool with it. Also, anything us drunk dummies needed she was there without even a request. We were sand bagging a little as we tried to finish our boots, OUR TWO LITER BOOTS mind you, and she comes around with two glass of water, \"seems like you guys are slowing down. This'll help.\" She called us out! And I like it...especially because I did need that water. \n\n2)delicious food: I have experienced both the bar and the restaurant areas, and both have superb menus. For dinner I've had the pork and it is to die for in that when we we perusing the menu, my buddy Jack and I, and we liked a lot that was on deck but we both ended up with the pork. It just sounded so good. No regrets whatsoever. It was very flavorful and not too tough, great sides that really refresh the pallet rather than just sitting there, as in the asparagus and quinoa actually contribute to the meal's taste. Also I hate quinoa if that tells you how good this meal is. Meanwhile in the bar section, to compliment our boots Lawrence and I finish off our terrible weeks with smothered fries and by the sound of it one would expect heavy and loaded. However, had great taste without being too cumbersome which one can run into a lot. Still had the grease that makes bar food delicious without being grease with a side of fries. And drinks? Cocktails are delicious, our waiter Yuri had great  suggestions. I wish I remembered the names of the drinks but that goes to show how good they are right? And of course get yourself a boot. It's just glorious, enough said.\n\n3)lasting impression: decor is great, I love the lighting. The inside is like buckshot and zeitgeist but less divey, and I love dive bars but the Schroeders experience is all encapsulating as in it's a full experience-food, service, and ambiance compliments one another. The staff is engaging and ready to strike up a conversation whether or not you are their priority. We had such a good time that we were able to chat it up with a whole slew of random people we just met.We actually ended up leaving shroeders with these people we met there and found ourselves drinking with them in the Castro dancing our drunken booties away. And most of all, the people I've talked to who work there seem to genuinely enjoy their jobs. When they speak about what they do and how they carry themselves, very down to earth and just wear this glow that makes you jealous like their in the cool crowd. I've spoken with Cassie, Mel, Diego, Cleveland, Dallas and Kori, and they make me want to come back and send people to Schroeder's. \n\nSooooooo to summarize, if you couldn't tell, I love Schroeder's. I highly recommend it. One could say it's pricey but this is what I'd say to that person, \"you definitely get what you pay for aaaaaaaand welcome to San Francisco honey.\" you're not just paying for food or drinks or service or whatever, you're paying for an experience.", "author": "Rajiva U."}

We also ordered the kraut burger and I joked with my friends it was going to be small like a white castle. Sure enough it was about the size of a slider and it cost $15.00 place is a joke.

This is a top game on a Saturday noon (kick-off at 12) and Schroeder's did everything wrong which they possibly could! \n\nFirst of all: kick off at 12 and at 11:50 there is a huge (!!!) line in front of the restaurant and still enough space inside. Should that make you think about whether you handle the door correctly? Yes, it should. Should the fact that people are nervously starting to pile up at the entrance and asking you why they have to stand in line for 40 minutes make you think? Yes, it should. The point I want to make is pretty simple. If somebody decides to go public viewing of soccer, they do not need their seperate table, a waitress that bring's them to that table and an arrogant cuff-linked manager at the door (don't get me wrong, I wear cuff-links on a daily basis, but that was the perfect synonym of how incredibly arrogant and unfriendly he was). You know what they need? Beer, atmosphere, the feeling of community & unity and most certainly not missing the freaking national anthem. And now comes the most ridicolous part for everybody that has not been there: THEY HAVE COMMUNITY TABLES!!!!! To sum that up: you seriously make your (anxiously waiting for the game) customers wait in line for over 30 minutes, to place them seperatly at the same community tables?!? I am sorry, I had to stop typing on my small iPhone screen for a second because I had to laugh so hard! Basically, you artificially increased the average wait time in order to achieve: nothing! How about that? Open your freaking doors, let the people sit wherever they want, and let them be happy. And please don't come me with excuses like \"well, the waitresses need that in order to bill correctly\". If you really think that way, check out your competition (Leopolds), they just got the place packed for the first Germany game and everything worked out just fine!\n\nThis leads me to my second point! I do not know where you got your management education, but I would get myself a lawyer if I were you and sue the last cent out of regarding institute because they clearly failed in performing their duty. Or where you drunk on your (admittingly delicious) beer when you set up the staffing schedule? In numbers: roughly 50-70 persons in front of the bar, the rest of the (huge) restaurant packed, the knowledge about the game (I mean you broadcast it), and you place two(!!!!!!!) barkeepers???!!!!! That must be a joke. Drinks took ages, since one of them was exclusively preparing drinks for the seated service, and the guy that serviced the crowd at the bar should either think about a career change or management should only staff him when he received proper training. I mean not knowing the beer price, taking (I timed it because I was laughing my butt off by this whole mess) 38 seconds to place ONE order in your micros register (a normal bartender takes a maximum of 5 seconds), and not being able to deliver a Hefeweizen with the proper layer of foam on top?! Seriously... And don't Arthur with a German (me) about how you pronounce Hefeweizen! You will clearly lose.\n\nAll in all, I have been to a lot of places in SF and the world to have food/drinks/watch soccer, and I thought I had seen incompetency at every level, but congratulations to the lads at Schroeder's yesterday, they put applied mismanagement to a whole new level! What s gigantic fail and a mess! At least the crowd at the bar had a lot of fun laughing at that, and the consensus was exactly the same: how can you possibly mess things up on so many different levels? I do not have the answer. Ah yes, what I almost forgot: 9 dollars for .5 beer?! Come on, that is even for SF a whole new level....\n\nSunmary: if I feel like entertaining myself with watching management fail, I will definetly come back!", "author": "Luca E."}

Hardwood floors and more modern feeling decor. But they still have tons of beer and large vessels to drink from should you feel the need. The bar looks the same but now lots of tvs. \n     I noticed they have a monster tv screen they can lower down. I am thinking this place may be the spot for world cup games. Plenty of family style tables to sit which is consistent with my memory of the old place but now everything is clean.\n     The dining area is in the back. Menu is solid german food options with some fun starter options. Its definitely not bar food so dont think you are getting like wings here. I went with the traditional pork schnitzel which was great. A good way to balance out after a couple hours of drinking beer.\n     So I cant really think of reason not to give place 5 stars. I see some other people had tough tiimes.

I have no complaints about the food but rather the service and management of the establishment was utterly dismal. To give a small background on myself I am a former restaurant manager at two different restaurants and I know from my experience that it is important that each patron and guest be treated with respect and dignity. Upon arriving at the restaurant in my most recent experience we had come with a fairly large group of about 15 people to celebrate a friend's birthday. We placed our name on a wait list and was given an estimated time of 20 minutes. After waiting for 30 the hostess failed to inform us that someone else had been taken to our table and that it would be another 30 before we were sat, she then suggested that we try and grab a seat at the community bench table tops that they have available. No apology was given for the confusion or the mistake she made and we waited until space opened on the community table. After about an hour into the service our sever came seldom and would not go around the table asking everyone's order and the manager, named Theresa, approached the girlfriend of the birthday boy and suggest that we leave because the guest of honor was \"too drunk\" and she didn't want to \"clean up after him or your party...\" My friend who's birthday we were celebrating was tipsy but not being belligerent, nor obnoxious, neither spilling or making any mess. For the manager to say such a thing to a guest is rude and disrespectful, especially for paying customers. She spoke condescendingly and was not apologetic for any of the circumstances leading up to that point. Even after all was said and done she suggested we pay out an leave. I will not be returning to Schroeder's and would not recommend anyone to come to their establishment. I would suggest to Schroeder's that Theresa be trained in hospitality and taught how to properly manage a restaurant. More importantly that she learn to simply be respectful.

The schnitzel was also good, but I felt it was trying to be too much - German and farm-to-table and Californian all in one dish.  The bratwurst was fine, but not my favorite.  I feel like the chef has immense talent but is being constrained by trying to keep a connection with the Bavarian dishes of yore, and also trying to be California-foodie.  I did miss the sausage platter that used to be available.

If an establishment is far more concerned for the bar crowd over that of the dinner crowd, then they need to let the dinners know that ahead of time.  My remedy for them would be to simply build a 3/4 wall between the two verses that of the chain screen, which does no good whatsoever.", "author": "Tess C."}

I am a big fan of German food and I appreciate that they have a true German chef who is taking a lot of pride in the food he's putting out. The spaetzle, beef tongue, potato pancake and the sausages were all delicious. Also, as weird as this may sound, the simple house salad was lights out. \n\nAnd for those German beer fans, this place will not disappoint.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-06-10", "description": "I will start off saying that I'm not the kind of person to write a bad review and I have been mulling over writing this for a week now. Had I never been to the original Schroeder's or never had real German food I probably would not be writing this one. I would have simply came, eaten and then left to never came back as the food was not good enough to warrant the price and it was not German food. \n\nLong story short, if you are looking for the old Schroeder's or good German food in general, don't come here as this is no longer that kind of place. If you want my long winded version why, then keep reading........\n\nI was so excited to go to Schroeder's after they reopened. I was craving some good German beer and a nice plate of Hungarian Goulash with German potatoes and sauerkraut. \n\nThe place looked great. They kept the paintings which was great. I loved the bench seating as that is just so eastern European. I could not wait to eat!\n\nImagine my surprise when the waitress handed me the menu with it's 8 entrees. Where is the Goulash?  Where is the sausage platter? What the hell is this? My friend and I had been raving about Schroeder's and we brought along 3 other friends that had never been (2 where new to the US from France as interns). I immediately began apologizing as it was very apparent this was not German food. Nothing on the menu looked German other than the Bratwurst. \n\nI have an open mind and was willing to give it a shot because you never know as it could be an amazing experience. 3 of my friends ordered the Bratwurst, one the Salmon Flatbread and I ordered the Chicken Schnitzel Sandwich and we got the Sp\u00e4tzle. With such a meager menu you would expect the food to arrive in quick order. An hour later it showed up. One of our guests had to leave as she could not wait as she had a meeting. So we got her food to go for her.\n\nThe Sp\u00e4tzle arrived first.. For me the best part of my entire meal was the noodle in the Sp\u00e4tzle. I will admit that little noodle was amazing but more on that later. The Schnitzel I had was just a sandwich. My friend Anca wrote a review the same day and you can read her opinion further down about the Schnitzel. You get nothing else with it unless you want fries for an additional $4. The Bratwurst came with no sauerkraut how can you possibly do that its a German restaurant for gods sake? However, it does come with a roll with a slit down the middle. I.E. A fancy hot dog bun. Really? The topper was my friends Salmon Flatbread. When it arrived I asked if that was the Salmon to which he replied yes. I then asked him where was the Salmon and he picked up some crumbles on the salad. Basically it was a salad with a few Salmon crumbles sitting on a piece of flatbread. $16.\n\nMy sandwich was OK. It had this mustard on it that was overpowering the rest of the dish. However, it was a decent sandwich but nothing to write home about and definitely not my Goulash (which WAS something to write home about). Overall the food was OK but we all said we would never be back. The food was just not good enough to warrant such a high cost for lunch.\n\nMy friend Anca got a nice reply from Schroeder's about her comment on the Schnitzel. They said they had a great Veal Schnitzel and were going to add it to the lunch menu based on her comments. So good going, please add a great Goulash as well. They also made a comment that their Chief, Chief Wrembel, is from CA born to German immigrants and uses his mothers recipes and spices them up with the techniques he learned in CA. They used the Sp\u00e4tzle recipe as an example of this. They said the noodle in the Sp\u00e4tzle was from his mothers recipe and the rest was his added spin on the dish. If you remember I mentioned for me the best thing of the lunch was the noodle in the Sp\u00e4tzle. I would recommend that he stop playing with his mothers recipes. If the noodle is any indication of how good she cooks then I would like to see more of her recipes without her sons twists.\n\nI wish Schroeder's all the best. It is very sad to see the place change in such a way as it was a great place to come too for some authentic German food. Alas no more. I wonder, do you still have the Das Boot or did that go the way of the Goulash?", "author": "Paul G."}

No table clothes, loud, noisy, tables up against other tables.  No privacy and the noise level is so high, bouncing off the bare walls, that you can hardly have a conversation with the person across the table.  The menu has changed too for the worse.  The veal was paper thin and dry, no taste except for the breading.  The potato pancakes no longer come with apple sauce or sour cream, but with some salad that adds nothing to the pancakes.  I won't be returning.  Pity!\n\nFinally, there was a big guy in suit and tie walking about.  He may have been the manager or owner, but what a sour face he had on!  Looked like a roaming ogre!   Nothing like a happy employee and one of the worst things to do in a restaurant if he was the manager or owner....no sense of hospitality.

So beer, they didn't have the beer I ordered, the waiter suggested another one that I hadn't tried. It wasn't good. I tried to change it out, but the manager didn't seem to care, and told me I was stuck with the one I ordered since it was a boot.  Then my friend ordered a boot, they ran out of the keg, have him half a boot and said, that's close to a liter so we'll charge you for a liter instead of 2, that's still $22 for a guess. Personally, I think that's bullshit. Normally when bars run out of a keg they give the half pour to you for free then ask you what you'd like for your actual order. Those 2 things soured my taste of this bar. Probably won't go back. Go to Leopoldo's on Polk instead.", "author": "Alan M."}

While it has been out of the family for almost 100 years, it was always great to be able to visit for lunch and see the decorations and taste the food that has been largely untouched since the early 1900s.  Coincidently this restaurant has been the favorite lunch spot of my graduate school mentor for 30 years which always tickled both of us.\n\nGiven the background, I had a lot of trepidation about what the new owners were going to do with the place when it closed for renovation.  Having visited a few weeks ago, I believe they've done a fabulous job positioning the restaurant for the next 100 years.  While I agree with some reviews about the food portions and cost, the food menu is something that always takes a while to perfect and nail down.  I'm confident the schnitzel plate and goulash will make a triumphant comeback at some point.  In the meantime, it is the coolest German beerhall in the city to sit and throw down beers at.  The renovation has the right balance of updating the decor and adding some much-needed swank while still hanging onto the \"Schroeder's\" feel.\n\nGreat job to the management!", "author": "Kristian H."}

Schroeder's is both nice with good food and reasonably priced. Therefore it's a place that earns my accolades for that and for the quality of the service too. The bar is loud and energetic as would be expected at a German Beer pub, but the back area where tables are reserved is calmer and more appropriate to dinner. You can meet at the front, be loud with your beers and all the others doing the same, but then be welcomed to the dining area and actually have a conversation and enjoy your dinner. The sausage plate and some cheese is a great sharing item and more than enough for 2. Lots of great beers as would be expected, so it's a nicer beer garden that is indoors!

The entry way is more inviting, throwing out the old gents club layout of yore. The menu is now made up of small fancy portions rather than big, old-school ones. The food seems a bit diluted from its roots. The bar man did recommended a great beer. Staff was friendly and accommodating.

By looking at the Currywurst, I had serious doubts that the owner has ever seen a real German currywurst.

Came in for lunch and it was pretty slow. Service was great, no complaints there. The food, however, was lacking. The bratwurst plate was tasty, but definitely undercooked. I should've sent it back but we were under time constraints. I miss the old Schroeder's honestly. Hard to slam liter beers in such a nice setting. Not sure if I'll be back again, maybe during Oktoberfest if I'm in the area.", "author": "Mark H."}

The menu is interesting and has something for everyone, the bar menu-- cocktails, beer and wine different and delightful. The waiters know their stuff and could not be nicer. The (new) decor is cool, and still respects the heritage of the brand. Really well done and a great new addition to the SF Bar/Restaurant scene.

It was happy hour about 6 and the bar area was PACKED like sardines.  Everyone was drinking beer of all sizes and brands and we barely found 3 seats tucked in the middle of one of the communal tables.  We wanted to order some food when the server asked us if we'd be more comfortable in the dining room.  We went there and felt relieved to be away from the throng of after-work crowd.  We were optimistic about the food and one of my friends is German.  What we got was almost inedible food.  The pickled vegetables were so sour it could jot be eaten.  The pretzel was soft and break-like.  Actually tasted more of Hawaiian bread than pretzel.  The duck sliders were a mush of meat and wet bun.  The potato cakes were greasy.  The bratwurst was grimy with small bits of chewy meat with terrible sauerkraut in the sauce so astringent the white hotdog bun in it could not help absorb it.  The wiener schnitzel was the driest piece of veal I could not believe it was served.  Close your eyes and try to identity the cut and you could say breaded 'cardboard'!    We ordered wine but maybe next time I'll fight the crowd and drink a beer instead!  Server was very nice so **.... But Yikes!", "author": "Gregory C."}

They were able to reserve one of the large communal tables for us. Our waitress was on top of all our scattered drink orders and when it came down to the check with people leaving before others, she had no problem taking items off and making separate checks. Everyone loved the pork rinds and smothered fries! Our waitress was also very knowledgeable when it came to the beer selection and able to make suggestions based on what some of us preferred as not every one was familiar with the beers served. Overall, great experience and definitely will be coming back!!", "author": "Tracey M."}

I love the decor - a mix of modern and traditional (especially the display case of all the bier steins!).  For drinks, I expected the long list of German beers, but was pleasantly surprised that they serve craft cocktails too.  Then there's the food.  What can I say?!  The spaetzel (spelling?) was to die for!  I could eat that as my meal!  The schnitzel was also incredible.  My friend had the burger and loved it.  I want to go back and try more stuff!

Shared the curry bratwurst sausage and my colleague had the chicken salad and I had SUPER spatzle.  They had corn in it and it was creamy.  Not diet food, but super yummy.  It was listed as an appetizer but could be a good side dish to share.  I would definitely have this again.  The sausage was bland.  I ordered it on the recommendation of the server.  It was just OK.  Service was good, fast, efficient.  Good water refills, quick with the bill.  The table was very long, picnic style benchs, and could accommodate a big group - but they put a grass/garden arrangement on the table which separated us from the other people at the table and gave us privacy.  The renovated venue is nice, open, good light, and clean.  Definitely looks like a German beer house/garden.  They take reservations on Open Table.  I would return here for lunch if I were in the area.", "author": "Sandra M."}

The wood-heavy decor is somehow warm and sleek at the same time.  On the night I was there (a Wednesday), it was definitely crowded but the bar is spacious and airy enough that it didn't feel claustrophobic, and the noise level was a happy buzz where you can still carry on a conversation.  The staff working the bar were incredibly friendly and pour some great beers and inventive cocktails (including cocktails that feature beer as an ingredient, which was a new and happy experience for me).  The food we tried included the pork cracklings (\"real\" cracklings, delicious and decadent) and the charcuterie plate that featured homemade pickles, yummy cheeses and one of the best and silkiest chicken liver mousse I've had in a while. . Unlike some others who seem to be posting reviews here, I have no nostalgia for Schroeder's in its former incarnation (my memories of the former establishment are unfortunate smells and perhaps the nastiest bathrooms in the FiDi).  But new Schroeder's I will be returning to again -- can't wait to get back there to try their full menu.", "author": "Leah S."}

Having eaten at other German places in SF (and Germany for that matter), the food here is kind of unique in the sense that it is a little bit lighter and more non-traditional than your typical German fare. Another reviewer said something about \"German-fusion\" and I had a similar feeling, although I liked it personally. It reminded me of German food meets California. Purists might not like it, but I thought it was tasty and well done. The selection of beers was great and I left stuffed full of breaded pork. No complaints!", "author": "Ryan B."}

We were quickly greeted at the entrance and quietly directed through the happy vibes of the beer garden to our table with a view of the historical interior that has been modernized with a light touch.  I loved the see through mesh like curtains that divided the dining area from the beer garden  and private parties to the rear of the room.\nWithout missing a step we were offered a selection of beers. A few sips of my light wheat beer and the crispy potato pancakes appeared with freshly grilled cherry tomatoes and perfectly cooked bacon slice on them. My European born friend enjoyed the pork rinds with a  horseradish dip . I am too much of a west coast native for pork rind.\nThe side dish  of spatzle was interesting  with corn, tomato and poppy seeds. I loved the al dente green beans with a shallot puree that garnished the weiner schnitzel. The weiner schnitzel was very thinly sliced with an excellent crisp coating. The sauerbraten fell apart with my fork and the potato dumpling was a combination of substantial and delicate, just perfect for the meat's sauce. Of course the innovation was there with grapes instead of prunes in the sauerbraten sauce.\nNo dessert, too full!", "author": "Aileen M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-05-20", "description": "I don't know. I just don't know if there's a niche for whatever this place has become. Both the menu and the service may turn out to be problematic. 1) The menu: Noveau-German? German inspired? The menu, in my opinion, does not have enough of the pure classics that people want from a German place to keep it exciting. Our server told us it was lighter, German-inspired San Francisco fare.  The appetizers were better and more interesting than the main dishes. I thought it was weird that most things on the sampler platter came in threes. Why not fours? I rarely have a group of three at dinner. The schnitzel was fine. The chicken roulade was forgettable and also an example of what's new and not necessarily German here: it includes quinoa and peaches. The artichoke dish was tasteless. The pistachio cake was so small that I took a picture of it next to a quarter to make my point. 2) Service. As others have reported, indeed, it took about 20 minutes to receive our beers and it wasn't busy. Remarkable. Also, we expressed our desire to try a lot of appetizers and just see before we ordered main dishes. Our waitress told us to please decide on main dishes soon so she could \"tell the kitchen.\" What? Why? She came back with the same request a few minutes later. (This was around 8 PM on a very not-busy night, btw.) So I said, really, we just want to eat the appetizers first and we will be fine if it takes a while for the entrees to come after that if we order any later. And she shot me a look so rude that leaving that moment wouldn't have been out of the question. She had a different waitress handle us for the rest of the night--fine by us. Definitely not worth the trip to the Fi-Di--better German options in town if we want German and better San Francisco fare options if we want that.", "author": "Megan M."}
