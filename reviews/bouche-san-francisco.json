I met up with a friend who happened to suggest Bouche for dinner and it was an excellent choice. He lives nearby and had been there several times before. He explained that they have a small, rotating menu and each item on the menu is reliably tasty. \n\nI'm glad he made a reservation because the second floor dining space is very small. On a hot day, the space was also rather warm and the first thing I did upon sitting was to open the window behind me. I was concerned that other diners would object to the street noise but instead everyone else complimented me on the idea and opened the other window as well.\n\nOrdering was simple since there were only 4 entree choices. He went for the steak (medium rare) and I had the shiitake mushroom risotto. He looked at me in confusion, as I am generally a carnivore. But I have a soft spot for risotto and I love shiitake mushrooms and didn't mind getting the \"vegetarian\" option this time. I was not disappointed when the delicious meal came out. We chatted about life and before I knew it, both of our plates were completely empty.\n\nAlthough we didn't \"need\" dessert, we decided to share a Creme Fraiche custard. It was served with a mini bowl of butterscotch and had the perfect balance between the subtleness of creme fraiche and the sweetness of the butterscotch.\n\nFor the food quality and the convenient central location, Bouche is definitely 5*.", "author": "Yi Z."}

The best bread, so fluffy and buttery and tasted like it was baked with love. \n\nAll the ingredients are super fresh and delicious. Had the scallop crudo. Raw scallops were very good, first time I had a dish like that. Couldn't eat all of it, too much raw fish for me. They give a good portion. Luckily I had someome to share it with :)\n\nThe salmon entree was also delicious and cooked perfectly and paired well with the lentils. \n\nFirst time I had a cheese platter for dessert too and I am so glad we got it. They really know thier bread and cheese of course! Tastes just like if I was in Paris. I dont know what type of cheese it was but it was perfectly stiff and creamy at the same time and the honey and apples with it really completed the flavor profile especially with the bread they give you as well. \n\nMust go!

We sat on the second floor, which was quite cozy and dark.\n\nWe started off with the Crispy brussel sprouts app, which I quite liked.  It was tasty and crispy, although the yogurt provided became a bit overwhelming towards the end.  For the entree I had the Roasted chicken breast.  The chicken itself was a bit dry, but the spicy sauce and the herbed spatzles were a nice complement and was tasty.  We finished off with the Strawberry rhubarb eclair, which was a bit too sour for me.\n\nOverall, it was all right.  Personally, I didn't have high hopes since the menu was so limited.

However, don't let looks fool you--they have an upstairs seating area where there is a tad bit more space and the food is stellar.\n\nEnvironment: feels like youre sitting in someone's converted attic. There are only a few tables upstairs (and some bar seating downstairs) and tables are pretty close together. In other words, it's quite an intimate setting. There are windows upstairs to ventilate, but it will get hot inside. So don't wear any sweat-sensitive clothing when you dine here, and/or wear layers that you can remove! Atmosphere is smart casual -- you probably don't want to wear a T-shirt but jeans are probably fine and you won't stick out if you go a bit higher with slacks/skirts/dresses. Men's jacket not required but also ok.\n\nNote that the food is a bit pricey (apps $13+) but the flavor is on point. This time we just ordered appetizers because we weren't too hungry. We got the bacon bread (bacon pieces are literally baked with/inside the bread) which comes with some butter. YY got the carpaccio, which I thought was simple/clean but also very small. I got the pork belly, which was delicious and surprisingly not that small of a dish. Not to say I wouldn't have eaten more of it if it had been a bigger serving.... \n\nCute place for a date, but, again, be prepared to be a bit toasty and spend a decent amount of money.

Honest opinion and against the 4.5 star grain.  Let me explain.\n\n1.  Lower than my expectations, it's a casual bar below (and tiny and open kitchen), and up the stairs in a loft, small 8 table seating.  The feel is if you are in upstairs at someone's house.  True, it was cozy and charming, but not deluxe or upscale in anyway.\n\n2.  The hostess/bartender and the waiter both had heavy French accents, so that was nice.  But dressed very casually in jeans, was again, below my expectations.\n\n3.  It's casual modern French cuisine.  The menu is very small, and does not any feature any traditional dishes, perhaps seasonal or daily, but this menu on this day did not have chicken or beef -- my preferences.  4 apps, 4 entrees.\n\n4.  My order: seasonal greens (shishito peppers, really, French?) were cooked well, but unexciting and far from great (3.0 stars, $8).  Chickpea Fries (panisses) sounds so good, but they were thick and tasted like polenta.  I'll take my fried calories elsewhere (2.0 stars, $8).  The small Spring Salad with pecans and running egg yolk as dressing was interesting but nice (4.0 stars, $10).  The Pork Shoulder was very tender, but I could have used much more of the little bit of side vegies ($28, 4.0 stars).  The salmon was the highlight of the night, caramelized on one side, cooked to perfection ($28, 5.0 stars). The dessert with a big description, was very pretty, tasted as if it was concocted from cool whip ($11, 2.0 stars).\n\nAll in all, nice experience but not going back.", "author": "Randy B."}

We both agreed that the Union Square area would be the perfect middle point and I did a quick search to find this joint nearby. I had been craving some French food as it has already been 5 months since I was in paris for the euros (how time flies). Made a reservation on open table for 7 PM on a Tuesday night. The joint itself is very quaint and unassuming from the outside. \n\nAs soon as you step in, there is a sense of warm that comes over you with a very welcoming aurora. There is a bar right as you walk in and a few spots there as well as a table. The main dining room is on the second floor of this place and there are a few tables up there making it a very enjoyable atmosphere. I was a huge fan of the rustic feel and an even bigger plus was these folks speaking French and dealing with my poor French . Definitely made me feel like I was in a Parisian bistro vs on the streets of San Francisco. The servers were all friendly and joking with our table which I appreciated. The wine list here is on point as well so I was a fan of putting back a few vinos even though I had just wrapped up whiskeys at an earlier bar (yes it was slightly rough the next morning.#lifedecisions). We both looked at the menu and as she wasn't hungry and I am on a weird keto diet, we kept it simple by just ordering entrees. I really wanted to try a few of the appetizers but CURSE MY DIET to the high heavens. But I digress, I decided to go with the pork loin which came out promptly. I am not traditionally a huge pork loin fan but I have to say this one was solid all around. I was a bit concerned that they were going to overcook it but it ended up being tender and tasty. I was just going for a protein meal cos of the diet but I think the other entrees would have been more delicious based on what my counterpart was eating. \n\nAll in all, I think a solid place for atmosphere, service, and for the food that I had at least.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-04-02", "description": "There's not a lot amusing about Bouche. While I'm assuming Bouche is named after the fun tidbits that a creative chef sends out to preferred customers (i.e. \"Here's an amuse bouche from the chef.\"), this little restaurant is stressed out and in search of an identity.\n\nI noted on our reservation that we were celebrating an anniversary. While I wasn't looking for fanfare or anything free, I was surprised when the very first thing the host told us when we checked in is that he really needed our table and provided us with a deadline to be out of the restaurant by. He was obviously stressed and that should have been an indicator of what our Bouche experience would be like. \n\nBut wait, let's take a breath here and take it all in. The restaurant is intimate, cool and romantic. The seating is a little cramped, but really that's part of the charm. The detail work is just great right down to the crown molding finished with newspaper as wallpaper that catches the eye. This is an enjoyable space and while we were at a table upstairs, I think the wine bar below would be just as charming.\n\nThe food is good, but not great. It's sort of like a variety of ingredients in search of a theme. It's not quite French, but more like a creative ADHD chef that has decided to shake up the French palate. The citrus salad as a starter is refreshing and vibrant. There's pink and regular grapefruit, blood orange and a unique dressing that works well with it. The only thing that doesn't work is the peeled lime which is just too over-the-top acidic for the meal. The other starter we had was the \"crispy prawns.\" This one had us scratching our head. The salad around the prawns is wonderful with fresh farmers market lettuce, kiwi, shaved radish and other goodies. That alone would have been great. The actual prawns reminded us of the \"coconut shrimp\" that was a 1990s signature dish at places like TGI Fridays. It's deep with a think sweet batter that seems completely out of place at this restaurant.\n\nFor our entrees, we both had Yellowtail tuna cooked with trumpet mushrooms and Japanese eggplant. This was a dish in search of a theme. The eggplant was way undercooked and rubbery and the tuna smelled and tasted like it had more than a few days out of the water in storage on it. The sauce in some cases had a black inky quality. Also included were Fresno chili slices which provided a little heat and needed flavor, but seemed like a last-minute addition to just add some color to the dish. Overall, it was passable, but not wonderful.\n\nGiven the time constraints laid out to us upon arrival, we decided not to stay for dessert and move our celebration to a less stressed out environment. \n\nIn summary, this is a restaurant that takes itself seriously to its own detriment. Let's lighten up and actually have a little fun like your name implies. If you can't amuse yourselves, you certainly aren't going to make it amusing for your customers. Clearly, you intentions are good and even earnest, but it's okay to smile a little and realize that with the theater down the street advertising \"Touch Our Junk\" for its male strippers that no one on the block should take itself too seriously.", "author": "Eric W."}

The hanger steak was terrific, but the swordfish was out of this world, as was the black garlic puree under the sweetbreads. The fougasse comes in handy for mopping up the exquisite sauces, too.

They have chilled still water, sparkling water, coke, and orangina (which is a French soda that tastes like a mimosa without the alcohol).

We chose the goat cheese cake with beet ice cream (how interesting!) but they sent out some creme fraiche panna cotta with some dulce de leche first, those sweethearts. So simple and yet SO GOOD.

The whole restaurant looks like a little french cottage (both inside and out).  The staff were nice and friendly and made excellent recommendations.  They gave us a wine list with a million different types of wine, I didn't know which one to choose, so I said white, sparkling, and not sweet.  The waiter brought out a bottle that was imported from France and I must say it was the best wine I have ever had in my life.  The food was to die for, every plate had a burst of different flavors.  We ended the night with a chocolate cake which was served with a type of white foam that looked like ice cream.  I mixed my bite with that and a piece of chocolate cake, which came out to be a combination of sweet chocolate and white vanilla rosemary.  It was incredible.  Side note, the decor and pottery in the restaurant was just gorgeous.  Beautiful authentic plates with gold imprinted dandelions, created by the owner's wife.  The whole experience was truly amazing.  I will definitely be coming back and possibly have a small party upstairs in the future.  Highly recommended.", "author": "Greta K."}

Maybe I went on an off night? Maybe my expectation was to high? However, in the end I think the food and service was good but not anything special that would make me want to come back for more. \n\nWhile the menu can largely be called French, I would venture to make the argument that it is French-inspired California cuisine. Certainly check out the appetizers as they are small bites that are good to share and showcase a variety of their cuisine. The salmon, poached egg, and creme fraiche was certainly a star with a balance of texture from the crispy noodles and the delicate raw salmon and flavor with from the saltiness of the egg and salmon complemented nicely from the sweetness in the creme fraiche. The sardine, grapefruit, and mint salad was a refreshing dish, however I personally like fish and even this was a lot of fish flavor to take in. The Octopus salad could use a little acid to combat the natural saltiness of octupi.\n\nThe lamb with onion marmalade was nothing to sneer at, however was just a tad overcooked for me. While it was very tender, the flavors were somewhat muddled by the onion and fresh parsley which took over as star of the show.\n\nDessert made me go \"meh...\" It clearly wasn't their forte, however the creme fraiche custard was ok and the pear tart with vanilla ice cream nothing to sneer at either. \n\nThe small quaint feel and rustic charm of Bouche is its clear selling point. Its seating area is primarily upstairs overlooking the kitchen which adds to the intimate nature of the establishment. The service is good and reasonably attentive and helpful.\n\nOverall, it was an ok meal. Nothing truly stellar or wow-ing. The food was good, service decent, and ambiance lovely.

I guess he's use to limp things. I'm not. \n\nOpening in December 2011, Bouche is a tiny two-story restaurant with a small, tapas style Provencal menu. Formerly a chef at the two Michelin starred Coi, Chef Nicolas Borzee's dishes were foodgasmic from start to finish despite the naysayers of Bauer and the likes. Plating could have been better for some dishes but nonetheless the execution was near perfection and the flavors didn't disappoint.\n\nF O O D\nKeeping in mind that portions are tapas sized, order at least 2 dishes per a person if you want to leave satisfied.

The way pork belly should be eaten every time, the skin was sinfully crunchy and the meat was like butter as if it was sous-vide for hours. The confit was as tender as slow cooked pulled pork. Completing this phenomenal epicurean dish were the chanterelles giving an earthy comfort. \n\n*CR\u00c8ME FRAICHE CUSTARD w/ Sea Salted Caramel Sauce ($7) - 5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bouche-san-francisco?select=GLvujAqgziKmu4221IyWhg#YwaQHoYOzOrqhWVw6AaBVg\nA dessert that will appease sweet and salty addicts, the milky custard was velvety smooth with a salty sweet decadence from the caramel sauce that took this over the top.

The dining area has really, really low light (they could do with about double the amount of light output).  The tables are pretty close together.  I realize they're doing what they can with the space they have, but these things still take away from the overall experience, albeit in a small way.\n\nBut aside from that, you're looking at an amazing meal.  I started with the charcuterie plate which was almost exactly what you'd get in France; various types of pate beautifully presented.  Not all of it was to my liking, but that's not the restaurant's fault.  My companion had the lamb and bacon crepinette which was declared wonderful.\n\nThe mains arrived; I had the duck breast.  It was in the top three duck dishes I've ever had, ever.  My companion's rock cod was amazing...I'm not a huge cooked fish fan but I would have been elated with ordering that dish.  Truly great.\n\nDessert time rolls around and I order the creme fraiche custard (with a side of homemade caramel) and my friend has the toasted fig leaf ice cream.  Neither dish sounds particularly great, but they tasted otherworldly.  The custard stands as one of the best desserts I've eaten in years, and my friend's ice cream was also extremely good.  \n\nThe prices were very reasonable considering the quality of the food,  The service was good, albeit a tad on the slow side (but very French in that respect).\n\nThe food warrants a full five stars, but the drawbacks mentioned above do warrant an adjustment to the score on the overall experience.", "author": "Ben G."}

We had a 7:45pm reservation, but when we arrived, we didn't get seated until 8:20pm. They kept apologizing for the wait, but made no effort to make it up to us (I'll get to that later). The place itself is really small, dark and cozy. It would make a great first date spot. They have large windows that overlook Bush St for people watching as well.\n\nPrior to the entrees, the waiter gave us some complimentary cold bread and butter. After we devoured the initial bread, the waiter came around and gave us some fresh warm bread with bits of bacon in it. This was delicious! We thought it was complimentary because of the long wait, but when the check came, they charged us $5 for the \"fougasse\" aka bacon bread. I'm deducting one star for making us wait half an hour past our reservation and another star for trying to charge us for something we didn't order! \n\nThere are only 4 entree options on the menu. We ordered the salmon and wagyu beef. The salmon was delicious, and the portion was very generous. The wagyu was basically 5 thin slices of beef on top of some veggies. This was rather disappointing, not to mention, super salty. Also, I noticed people around me were cutting off the outer parts of the beef because it was fatty. I thought of doing that too, but at $30 for a few slabs of meat, I would have ended up with almost nothing to eat. To be fair, I've never been a fan of French food. I was hoping this place would change that for me, but unfortunately, I left unsatisfied. \n\nOverall, this was a mediocre introduction to SF dining. However, I applaud the boyfriend for putting in the effort to plan a romantic evening.", "author": "Joyce S."}

Bar style seating downstairs and a tiny dining area upstairs (overlooking the teenssy kitchen and all the piping) Sorry but for a place that tries to make itself seem fancy, that's just a big no-no. I don't want to see your blackened stove and the grease in your fryer. Carol L (see review below) was one the girlfriends I came here with for our Christmas dinner. \n\nThe server took us upstairs to be seated and there was already a party of 3 sitting by the wall, so any normal person would assume since the place is basically empty, he would seat you AWAY from them by the windows. You know, the common sense thing where you don't cram 7 people into one corner of this tiny deck? NOPEE. He makes us seat directly next to the other table overlooking the ledge of the deck. The chairs are so wide we had difficulty getting into our seats and by anyone's standards, we're pretty skinny. Plus there was the whole inconvenience of the guy who looked like a twig taking up 3/4 of our shared space with his chair. To add insult to injury, the waiter told us that the other tables were being reserved for couples who were coming. He said reserved, as in implied pre-bookings, not their delusional thoughts that 8 random couples would walk in to fill up the rest of the deck.\n\nFood: MEHHH !!! For a fancy meal, you know some of that cost just goes purely into the fact that you're eating there like buying something designer. Tiny portions that could not be justified by price or taste. Their only salvation was the desserts which were unique. The Milk Chocolate & Caramelized Hazelnut was very good. \n\nService was mediocre. I felt like we paid tip, because he had to bring our lukewarm food up a flight of stairs. So honestly, there are at least 100 places more worth your time and money in the Union Square/Downtown/FiDi area.", "author": "Jenn Y."}

Being so close to the financial district worried me about tourists skewing the reviews. 4 stars is too much credit for the great restaurants of SF. \n\nAs other reviewers noted, this is not \"traditional\" french food...But I don't want your opinion if you expect hamburger and fries from every \"American\" restaurant. I want creativity and good food. Bouche does this well with their apps, like the bacon bread. What is disappointing is not the portions of the main course, but the effort that the portions reflect. My wife ordered chicken and I ordered steak. They were cooked well, but that's all they were; just a couple strands of broccoli and meat. Not creative like the apps and if we had not ordered apps, the portions would be extremely disappointing. \n\nWhat threw us off was when I ordered a Bordeaux, which they ran out of. I asked for a similar wine and was served a chilled red wine. Some people may serve wine cooler, but an honest winemaker will tell you this is because you'll taste less of this bad wine. The wine was sour by the time it warmed up. The waiter let us down. I am satisfied with the restaurant, but this should not be on your bucket list.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-17", "description": "Are you looking for a pretty good dinner to start your fun evening in San Francisco? Are also looking for a worthwhile place to spend a good amount of money on some tasty and good quality food? Well, this place has your answer. I am giving this place a really high rating out of some mercy because I thought I had one of the most tastiest dinners at an excellent location along with some great service that actually exceeded my expectations. If you are looking for a big dinner, this may not be the right place, but you should have a big lunch or be prepared to have a tasty late evening meal later in the evening. \n\nBouche is the French word for mouth, and when I left, I thought my mouth was very happy after that dinner, as if you got a second chance to encounter that kind but gorgeous lady you really wanted to talk to after a really long period of time and the encounter was a stunning and thrilling success, leading you to think: \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"\n\nI had the Citrus and Honey Confit Lamb Shank. To be honest, it was probably the second best lamb dish that I have ever eaten within the past six years. That was how good it was. The flavor had the right amount of sweetness and it was still savory, and at the same time, the tenderness was just right. The ratatouille and couscous had an amazing blend of flavor that made this dish delicious and tasted very well with the lamb. The dish was not too expensive, probably at about $30. It should be enough for a light dinner, but an excellent one. \n\nThe dessert was also pretty good, and if you need to get your stomach fuller, the Creme Fraiche Custard is a good option. The creaminess and the texture was excellent. The flavor was not too sweet. \n\nAs for the service, the waiters were very friendly and knowledgeable. I was able to have a great conversation with Guillaume, the owner and he was very friendly and very committed to listening to any concerns you have. You don't really have to dress nice at this place, but you still can dress a little casual, and you still need to look fine at the same time. The interior is not very upscale, but not very casual with the wooden chairs, but overall, the interior still looks nice. It is also small, so at the most, you can have six people. It is a nice atmosphere for a dinner appointment with your companion or a couple cool buddies and a few great companions. \n\nYou may need to get a reservation, but coming later in the evenings at 9:00 PM should be fine. They are open late until 1 AM, so you could get a lot of drinks from their wine bar and also a tasty dinner after a night out in the city. It is at a great location, not too far from Union Square. \n\nOverall, I thought I had one of the tastiest and possibly memorable fine dinners in San Francisco so far. If you are looking to \"kick start\" an ideal, great and adventurous evening with your friends in a fun city like San Francisco, wine from the wine bar at this place and a great dinner is not a bad choice. After that, hopefully your evening will get better and better.", "author": "Ambrose C."}

So after the ballet we arrived at Bouche and were immediately greeted by a welcoming gentleman who asked us where we were coming from and seated us promptly in the front which was very nice. Then within a couple minutes another kind gentleman asked us if we knew what we wanted to drink or eat. We were still looking over the wine menu but we knew what we wanted to eat (Hangar steak for me and Salmon for my girlfriend, both were amazing) when we told him what we wanted to eat he asked us a couple questions to give us a wine which paired well with what we were eating. Came promptly with the wine which was paired just as well as the food tasted. After we ate we ordered dessert and some dessert wine which were both delicious as well! When we received the check he told us that one of the dessert wines was on the house! And for the money it is worth every penny.

Disappointed, yet patient gf checks yelp for near by restaurants. After each of us called a few restaurant, Bouche at 0.2 mils away told us they can seat us at the counter. So we said \"BE THERE IN ONE MINUTES!\" and we did.\n\nThe server welcomed us with a big smile and seated us at the counter overseeing the kitchen. Very nice modern industrial decors with nice and warm ambient.\n\nThe fixed vday menu was a 3 course meal and dessert with two options for each course so we opted to try each one. We tasted a few wines and settled for two glasses of whites since the set menu was centered around oceanic ingredients.\n\nAmuse Bouche Imperial Oyster, Uni and Caviar - Honestly the uni and caviar was too little that they did not come alive. I like the concept of mixing the creaminess of uni with oyster though.\n\n1st: Truffle Poached Quail Egg, Chicory Salad - nice warm salad with fresh ingredients. quail egg added a good creaminess to the refreshing and subtle dressing.\n\n1st; Lobster and prawn creamy bisque, crab salad - very creamy lobster bisque, but the flavor was much heavier on the smoky prawn side. Prawn is cooked to perfection. Crispy shell and tender tail.\n\n2nd: Smoked duck Carpaccio - nicely smoked. I liked the slightly chewy texture and the just right amount of savoriness cured in.\n\n2nd: Avocado and Crab Napoleon - This one was alright. the crab was very nicely flavored and the portion was generous. However avocado over powered the rest of the flavors. Avocado is hard to control though.\n\n3rd: Seared Scallop, parnip puree and tarragon sauce - Best dish of the night. You can't beat a good scallop seared to perfection with the right green herbal sauce. Crispy outside and tender and moist inside.\n\n3rd: Venison Loin, black truffle, wild cherry jus - Venison wasn't too gamy and the cherry sauce was well done, deglazing the jus of venison into a hearty sauce that is not overly sweet nor bitter.\n\nDessert: Chai tiramisu - I love tiramisu, but this one was not the best. Still it was nice.\n\nDessert: Foundant au chocolat - I'm not a dessert person, but the warm foundant was good. My gf loved it.\n\nBouche saved my v-day and gave us a very warm and nice French dinner with local twist.

Definitely get a table upstairs - overlooks the street and is very romantic. Perfect for a date. The restaurant is dim and the tables are close together - you can definitely hear other people's conversations (not great, but kind of funny).\n\nWe didn't get the shoulder of lamb as many diners suggested (neither my bf and I are huge fans of lamb). But we did go crazy on the appetizers and he got the snapper (it was ok).\n\nHits: bacon fougasse. Best bread you'll ever try.  Huge too. The loaf was probably enough for 4. Except we got 1 between the two of us. And I think the restaurant made a mistake and gave us a second loaf.  We couldn't help ourselves and ate 50% of the second loaf as well. The food coma that ensued was neither slight nor painless. \n\ndungeness crab mash was delicious.  Scallop appetizer was good but not a good value. 1 giant scallop for $15. Beef tartare was surprisingly fantastic - I'm surprised more people haven't mentioned it in their reviews.  It's the best seasoning I've had in a beef tartare.

However i had the priviledge to walk in with four friends at about 1 am after we had left work and were fortunate enough to be guided to a table at a time when the rest of that neighborhoods kitchens are already asleep. Good hospitality counts for a lot, right, and ive worked that late night shift before and know how much it sucks to be closing up and have 5 a-holes walk in yelling for food. So kudos, guys! Service was excellent, the staff knowledgable about the entire menu, all questions answered perfectly. The food was were I was certainly impressed. We had the luck to also have our rich doctor friend with us who in, show off cause i can, fashion, had to order about two of everything on the menu (Thanks for reminding me im poor, dick.).

The chef at bouche has to be some sort of mad scientist or somwthing because the hot line at bouche is despicably tiny, and the kitchen staff cramped, and almost in the dark, but the quality and volune of the menu is equal to that found in restaurants with 2-3 times the space.

But in either case a certain mood is set in the soul sitting upstairs in a dimly lit cafe, the soft rain pattering outside while warmth and food is brought to you.\n\nBouche has an older-time feel to it, almost cinematic in its setup, dark and moody but French and charming, in that French way if you can believe.  The waiter is a tad imposing, large and a bit frequent in trying to force an order, but pleasantly rare after.  I made reservations (though I needn't have for this rainy Sunday morning), and even parking proved not too challenging, quiet feat on its own.  But in any case the menu was small enough to be a right-of-passage, us eventually settling on three items while mentally nothing that we'd probably, like any good hobbit, require a second breakfast.  Translation: expected tiny portions.\n\nFresh Fruit Bellini 10\nCharming, simple, light.  It would take fifty of these for me to feel a buzz, though I would sadly grow tired of it long before then.  But one?  Sweet and supple, water on the side much appreciated.\n\nRoasted Banana and Peanut Butter Beignets, Preserved Straberries 12\nThe first plate to arrive, the beignets, were visually obviously handmade and pleasantly light, too.  They're a bit like donuts, the peanut butter not too strong at all much to my pleasure, while the banana flavor proved subtle but more notable.  Despite its lightness, it's a tad strong as a sole opener, though probably too subtle as a dessert.\n\nScallop Crudo, Pomelo and Grapefruit, Prawns, Apple Slaw 15\nIndeed the scallops are fresh though thinly sliced, the rest of the dish dwarfing it in comparison; this doesn't say much as the portioning itself is on the small side, but it is overall good and balanced to some degree, lighter in taste than the others presented, as would be hoped for in a seafood dish.\n\nHand Cut Beef Tenderloin Tartar, Basil and Parmesan Pesto, Fingerling Chips 15\nThere's always a bit of an odd feeling when green is combined with a meat of any kind, especially one that leans more to the rare side than well done.  Unless of course it's dragon.  But moving past that major aesthetic flaw, this dish proved to be my favorite in taste, perhaps the most balanced in flavor profile altogether.  The chips are housemade and remind of me Zanzibar Cafe in San Diego; the basil and parmesan make an excellent accompaniment to the finger food.\n\nThe soft conversation, helped by there being only three or four occupied tables throughout, provides a nice atmosphere of peace.  There isn't much space in the restaurant or on the tables, or to be honest much on the plates anyway, but we managed to walk out of the restaurant full enough not to get that second breakfast, as marginal as the first was.

My boyf and I were looking for a nice place for some unique food. Noting crazy unique but, oh, the flavors. From the looks of it the menu changes pretty often but I got:\n\nSALMON- lightly seared with quinoa, bruzzel sprouts + a tiny bit of bacon, and thin curls of sweet potato. I was never really sure what people meant when they said \"this pairs so well with this other flavor\" but there's no doubt I knew what those people meant after tasting the salmon with the sweet potato. The quinoa was done in such a way I didn't know quinoa could be done with so much taste; warm, full, and engulfing. All sorts of different savory and sweet flavors, all working in perfect harmony.  \n\nhe got:\n\nVENISON-  with potato, beets, and mushrooms. Usually meat dishes have some sort of \"splash\" of herbs and flavoring but this dish was doused with a rosemary flavoring, and in such a great way. \n\nWaiters- so lovely, actually french, gave us great wine suggestions. \n\nAll in all a great experience.", "author": "Alina L."}

I can't say I'll ever go to a little restaurant in Paris in my lifetime but if I do I hope it's a lot like going to Bouche. \n\nI'm really big on service and ambiance and this place nailed it on both. Everyone who works there greets you at one point or another.  From the chefs to the servers. It's a small place and the people working there give that at home feel that you want in a restaurant this intimate. If I ever get to have another date in my lifetime this would be on of the first places I'd take her. \n\nThough I only had a couple dishes I was blown away by them both. Salt Cod brandade and a side of baked beans with some sort of stewed meat. They were both killer.  If that wasn't enough to convince me this place was good the stranger on my left had ordered what I think was braised lamb and he devoured it in less than 5 minutes. By the time I looked back at his dish it was wiped clean, literally. I thought I could stop there but I got suckered into dessert. I was stuffed from going to a sports bar earlier in the evening and the dishes I had but everyone around me raved about this creme fraiche custard. I broke down and agreed to try a bite of my friends order but it was just like a lays commercial. I couldn't just have one.

We ordered the scallops, beef tenderloin tarar, and sauteed sweetbreads for appys. The sweetbreads were balanced well with mushrooms and cream but was unfortunately heavy handed with the salt. The scallops (2) were cooked perfectly and paired with a tarragon risotto which just as nice. \n  \nMy favorite appy out of the three was the beef tenderloin tartar. The plate itself was comprised  of the beef, lemon, chili powder, pesto and onions which were all placed separately from one another. None of the ingredients would have worked individually, but collectively, a dab and sprinkle of each in one bite was quite wonderful! \n\nAs for the entrees, I ordered the pan seared petrole sole while the bf ordered the tomahawk porkchop. My sole was rather good with a well balanced puree and perfectly deep fried risotto balls. I only had a bite of the porkchop and my bf seemed pleased with it. \n\nMoving onto the venue... the bathroom must have been 2' x 1' with half a foot between the smallest sink in life and the little black toilet. It was literally the most logistically focused and highly coordinated restroom visit I have ever endured. I had my celine luggage tote in one hand and had only the other to handle logistics.. needless to say, it was uncomfortable. \n\nOverall the food was definitely solid but nothing outstanding. It was nothing short of what was expected but my mind was not blown and there wasn't anything I'd rave about. The venue itself was really small with about 5 tables upstairs and a little bar area down below. From the food to the decor and setting, it screamed authentic french across the board.

This is just mouth-watering and perfectly balanced, the first taste and I knew it was going to be a great meal.\n\nPan Seared Petrale Sole, Crispy Porcini Risotto, Espelette and Carrot Pure, Lobster Cream Sauce.  The flavors in this dish were simply perfect.  The Sole was perfectly cooked, and the Risotto were in two balls, accenting very well.  I cleaned the plate of all food, even the excess sauce (not that there was much excess, nor was it lacking).\n\nWild Mushroom Medley, Spicy Apple Sauce.  You can taste the right amount of apples, it's not overpowering but again wonderfully balanced with the mushrooms.  This complemented the Sole quite well.\n\nCreme Fraiche Custard.  You Must Get This.  I cannot stress how simple and awesome this was.  The counter-balance of flavors and textures was artful.  This was also complimented by the Rivesaltes Ambre 2005, very sweet.\n\nI can't remember which wine I had with dinner, just that it was a lighter red and fit the meal well.  It was recommended by the server, and he knew what he was doing.\n\nThe staff were also quite friendly, made sure I was enjoying my meal, and helpful when asking pairing questions.\n\nIf you want excellent French food in SF, this is the place to go.

The hard cow's milk was like a raclette.    Served with apricot and blackberry compote it was excellent.   Like having dessert as a first course which is never a bad thing IMHO. \n\nNext course were the marinated sardines with grapefruit.   Excellent.   I can't recall fresher tasting sardines...they still had their full color and tasted like they had been caught in the past hour.    We also had the stewed and oiled peppers with burrata.   Simple, but tasty.   \n\nWe also had the King Trumpet and Maitake mushrooms with greens, which were a disappointment, hence the loss of a star.   Interestingly, the King Trumpets tasted exactly like stale biscuits that they sometimes served us in school when I was a child.   A somewhat odd but poignant memory sparked by the flavour of the mushrooms. \n\nFor Entrees we had Smoked Salmon with Creme Fraiche, and the Pork Belly & Shoulder.   The pork was mind-boggling good...two different cuts of pork - shoulder, confit, and the belly, which was unctuous and delicious.   The confit was topped with a tangy pickled onion which set it off nicely.    The salmon is their signature dish (see business photo - that's it), and while it was tasty, I found it plain and far eclipsed by the Pork.    I wished I had tried the Cod instead. \n\nThe Wine List is noteworthy - they have an excellent selection of small vintages from Provence and Languedoc Rousillon, among others.    I had a glass of the Jurancon and the Beaupre Coteaux.  The former was alive with fruit, not too snappy, and had a slight finish of Lynchee.  The latter was crisp and dry with elements of lemon and apple.   Both were excellent.   \n\nBouche has been likened to a \"Cozy French Home\" on Bush street....I would have to agree, and will be back.", "author": "Max K."}

There were a few people down in the bar area, but we were the only party in the dining area upstairs. Not sure if we were forgotten about because of that, but after we were seated, we didn't see anyone, nor get served any water for another 15-20 minutes. I think we were finally remembered when the next party arrived, because we were finally approached by a waiter right before the second party got seated. When the server arrived with some water, he seem apologetic. Service was faster after that as the dining area started to get filled with other people.\n\nThe boyfriend and I ordered the bacon bread, the salmon entree, and the pork shoulder entree. The bacon bread was okay, nothing too spectacular. I liked the bread by itself. Maybe there was too much bacon in the bread because the first couple of bites were pretty salty. But I think we got used to it after a while so we did finish the whole loaf of bacon bread.\n\nThe boyfriend's pork shoulder entree started off good. The flavors were there and the meat was pretty tender. However, after a while, the meat started to get a little dry. He really liked the polenta though.\n\nSaved the best for last! My salmon entree was DELICIOUS. The salmon was cooked perfectly all the way through. The boyfriend kept trying to exchange some of his pork shoulder for some of my salmon.

The server was excellent as he served us in smaller wine glasses for tasting before we actually ordered. This was the same when we were ready to do wine pairing later on too.\n\nA smaller menu and so we were able to try out a few of them. Fougase (house made bread topped with bacon and halved olives inside) was just okay and would have been better if the bread was warm. The soup was buttery and was okay. The beet salad with duck confit was good greased taste.\n\nSo we were a bit underwhelmed at this point, but then the salmon on top of a deep fried tiny noodles wrapping a poached egg wrapped was absolutely a phenomena! This requires skills and we were awed big time. The suggested Alycastre Rose pairing which had a bit of smokey flavor was great.\n\nRoasted Brussel sprouts were excellent and was a trending dish. It was crisp with layers happily falling like chips as I took a bite to it.\n\nBoth stuffed chicken and lamb shoulder were good solid, juicy. The recommended pairing Vinsobres, Corbieres were both matching and brought out the flavors of the dishes.\n\nFor Dessert we had panna cotta and white chocolate with caramelized pear (poached style) and brown butter sable were delicate and not too sweet.\n\nService was fantastic and attentive and the fact that they let us try a few wines before deciding which ones to pair was a very nice touch.\n\nAs usual, we closed out the place way after their closing time and they were nice to let us enjoy food, drinks and company without interruptions!", "author": "T L."}

I'm glad I found this place by chance on Yelp. \n\nThe restaurant is incredibly small. You definitely need reservations if you're planning on eating during normal dinner hours. \n\nThe hubby and I shared an appetizer made with Roasted King Trumpets And Maitakes, Dill Pesto & Fresh Pluots. Such a great salad to start with. The mushrooms had oodles of flavor. I almost licked the plate clean. \n\nThe hubby had a Marinated Salmon, Poached Egg And Cr\u00eame Fraiche as his entree. The salmon was so melt in your mouth. It was lightly smoked. It was almost sashimi-like. There was a bed of crunchy noodles or rice under the salmon. It was a nice play of textures.\n\nI went for the Roasted Berkshire Pork Belly, Confit Pork Shoulder, Potato Pur\u00e9e, And Summer Truffle. SO. AMAZING. The pork belly was everything you would want it to be: tender, flavorful, awesome. The potato pur\u00e9e was like a delicious sauce for the pork. And the plate was LOADED with slices of black truffle. For only $25, it was a steal!\n\nWe finished our night with a Cr\u00eame Fraiche Custard. It was a cr\u00eame fraiche panna cotta with separate side of custard. It was like having your cr\u00eame brul\u00e9e without the heaviness. Surprisingly refreshing. \n\nLove this place!

I was curious about this French bistro just a minute walk away from the Hyatt.  What could be in store if we cruised on by, without a reservation.  It's a Sunday night, in a bustling, energized city.  Could we get in?\n\nYup, they were happy to see us and had a table upstairs.  A tiny little box of a restaurant which reminded me of a wonderful French meal we had in New York City at La Boite En Bois.  As we entered the first gentleman we encountered asked us if we would like to sit at the bar, usually a go to hang out for us.  However, I asked about sitting at table and he immediately found us a place upstairs.  A quaint two facing out to the street overlooking a tattoo parlor and self service laundromat.  They only had few tables in the main dining area, which meant for an intimate romantic setting.\n\nThe menu was very limited, with perhaps 4 entrees, 9 appetizers and a nice wine list.  We started with the Cheese Special, followed by the Marinated Flat Iron Steak, Summer Squash And Potato Gratin, Shaved Asparagus, Red Corn and Seared Muscovy Duck Breast, Duck Confit Croquette, Burnt Honey Farro, Saut\u00e9ed Haricots Verts with the Tomates Farcies, Squash And Bell Pepper Risotto side.  Their wine list was nicely rounded and upon the servers choice we received the Ch\u00e2teau De Cazeneuve Les Calcaires Pic Saint Loup 2011.  A lovely red BTW.\n\nThe Duck.. ah hell, I'm not going to go through all that.  Let me put it simply.. this was da merde!  Heck, everything about this place was la bomba.  The quaint tiny restaurant was full of love and soul.  We were laughing with our neighbors, two gals from Vancouver, as well as the waiters.  Each of us would pause after having the first bite and just take it in.  We were punch drunk on the wonderful plate presentations and the service when presenting them to us.  We would finish our bites and look at each other with approval nodding heads.  Photo's were taken of food, servers and new friends.  Laughter and smiles were a bound as we finished our wonderful wine and dinner.  At the end of our entree's, we did something we generally never do, order desert.  A chocolate Tart of the day.  When the server returned with it, he quietly told us that this was on the house for us being some much fun to have in the restaurant.... I thought we were being way to loud.  Once dinner was over, we came down the stairs to see the chefs looking and smiling at us.. all we could do was applaud them and thank them for such a great meal and they in turn told us that they wished they could of joined us for a glass of wine since we were having such a fun time they wanted to join in.  Truly, one of the best meals and experiences in our lives..  To only live in San Francisco to make this a weekly destination.", "author": "Jens B."}

I haven't been this excited about a restaurant in a while. \n\nI went here for a girls' night out and was intrigued with the ambiance from the moment I stepped in... it's rustic, intimate, cozy and classy at the same time. There are two levels - bottom one is a bit more casual with a nice bar scene and the top one is intimate and romantic. We were seated in the corner of the top level. Our waiter was friendly and helpful and his French accent certainly didn't hurt either! \n\nNow to the good stuff... the food. Please listen carefully and I mean very carefully. Order the same order I made and you're guaranteed to love it. One of my friends ordered the fish and it was a bit too raw for our tastes. But everything else fully made up for this. \n\nStart with the Marinated Salmon, Poached Egg And Creme Fraiche appetizer to really open up your palette. We were all impressed with the perfectly smooth texture and the subtlety of the dish. This creme fraiche and salmon combo should be almost as famous as the peanut butter and jelly one. \n\nFollow this with the Roasted Berkshire Pork Belly entree. I'm not a hundred percent certain but I'm pretty sure I cried a few tears of gluttonous happiness while consuming this. It's tender, juicy, moist, flavorful, buttery without butter even being an ingredient and everything good in mankind. Bouche is now one of my favorite restaurants in SF and this dish is solely the reason why! \n\nLastly, conclude this explosion of foodie pleasure with the Creme Fraiche Custard. It takes simplicity and purity to the next level by maintaining the true flavor and taste of milk. The custard is served along with a chocolate sauce and the combination of the two is painfully powerful. \n\nPair all of this with a bottle of French wine and you've got a fabulous dining experience. Please make reservations in advance as the restaurant is quite small and seems to always be busy. \n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!", "author": "Priya S."}

Stopping in for dinner early last week with a friend, we were greeted with some accessibility issues that the waitstaff handled immediately, without us even requesting anything (more on that later). So, off to a good start, my friend and I ordered their:\n\n* Marinated Salmon, Poached Egg & Creme Fraiche [ http://flic.kr/p/dp6fgy ] - I've mentioned time and again my slight aversion to raw fish, but oh dear god this was an amazing dish. Every component of the dish blended together just so, to create a tasty, well-balanced burst of flavors and texture. We never quite figured out what the crispy noodle-like things were (strips of phyllo dough, according to Cherylynn N), but they certainly helped make the dish was it was.\n\n* Roasted Berkshire Pork Belly, Confit Pork Shoulder, Potato Puree, & Yellow Chanterelles - A dual presentation of pork, with my personal preference going towards the oh-so-tender-and-crispy pork belly, over the pork confit. Definitely something to be eaten alongside the rest of the dish for the proper balance of flavors, so make sure you get a mouthful of potatoes and mushrooms alongside that pork!\n\n* Lamb Shoulder, Onion And Almond Marmalade, Carrot & Coriander Puree [ http://flic.kr/p/dp6fuY ] - While still rather enjoyable, this was probably the most lackluster part of the meal, due completely to the fact that the sauce actually made the dish a bit too sweet. Though that aside, the lamb shoulder was prepared wonderfully, to the point of being melt-in-your-mouth tender.\n\nWe also had a white (to go with the salmon) and red (for the pork and lamb) wine suggested to us by our waitress, both of which went perfectly with the food - and this is coming from someone who still doesn't completely appreciate wine yet. Of noteworthy mention is that they let us split a glass of wine by actually pouring two very generous servings into separate glasses for us.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - So, as mentioned when I started this review, Bouche is not incredibly wheelchair accessible. Their actual tables are all upstairs, with the downstairs area being limited to high bar seating. However, they apparently have a fold out table stored away somewhere, that they can bring out for these types of situations: just be sure to let them know when making your reservation.\n\nBathroom - I didn't use them, so I can't comment.", "author": "Johnny W."}

Right when you walk in, you feel this intimate feeling of being welcomed into a friend's house for dinner, but with dim romantic lighting instead. \n\nThe place is really small so you'll feel as if everyone's in the same party. I don't recommend it for groups over 4 because once again, it is an extremely intimate spot. The service is fantastic and the staff their is friendly and funny!\n\nMy fiance and I ordered 2 appetizers, the charcuterrie and the pork belly, a well as the flatiron steak and the cod dish. Right after I ordered, I of course went on my phone to check in on Yelp. While doing so,  I accidenally  drop my phone which lands on my lap, slides down onto the floor, and riccochets past the ledge and lands under the top floor into the kitchen! I start freaking out thinking I hit a chef or worse... hit them while they were using a knife resulting in a huge accident!\n\nI run over and look below to see a smiling chef looking back up at me. Thank God it landed next to him and not on him! He makes a joke about getting a \"long distance call\" and runs up the stairs to hand me my phone. Thankfully, he was such a good sport about it all. Teaches me to play with my phone during dinner time huh?\n\nAnyhoo... the part of the food.\n\nThe charcutterie selection was delicious! The pork belly was surprisingly different due to it's leaner cut. Usually when I order pork belling, it's kind of fatty, which makes for a more sinful little treat. But I didn't feel too guilty with this dish. My fiance cleary enjoyed his steak because after I tried a bite, he cleaned off the rest of his plate before I  got through a third of my fish! Now... I normally don't like cooked fish unless it's sea bass. I'm just extremely particular on how it is cooked. This cod however... did not disappoint. Seared to perfection! And the accoutrements that it came with paired perfectly to bring out the natural sweetness of the fish!\n\nAlthough there were only four choices to choose from for the main course, they change their menu every so often, so I'll definltely make another trip out when they do!", "author": "amelia g."}

Well, everybody who works at Bouche really is French--as is the Tunnel Top crew-- and many of the customers also answer to the name of Francois so we really found the epitome of what we sought with this spot.  Don't be fooled by the fact that the guys working here can pronounce their \"r\"s without discernible foreignness: they are authentic.  Plus it is comfortably close to public transport (Union Square/Powell St.) which worked out perfectly as a meeting point.\n\nI enjoyed a great creamy soup with charred garlic and mushrooms, as well as a beautiful piece of perfectly cooked Halibut. My friend liked the carpaccio and the sardine salad he was given accidentally (and invited to enjoy for free). The salmon looks like a bird's nest with baby bird fetuses on it, which was both artistic and gothic. I didn't taste it but the customers next to us at the bar, who were copying everything we ordered, said it was incredible.\n\nDo make reservations because there is no way you'll get as lucky as we were, just sauntering in even at 10 PM. \n\nI hear good things about the polenta which I will try on my next visit.", "author": "Lara W."}

To their credit, the staff was friendly and even accommodated a last-minute addition to our party (three people instead of the initial two-person reservation.)  Once seated, however, the surprises were mostly unpleasant:\n\n1.  The tasty bacon bread isn't complimentary, which although it may only cost five bucks, pales in comparison to many other restaurants we'd sampled during our trip--all of which offered delicious free bread courses (Nob Hill Cafe in particular.)  It was accompanied by a minuscule pat of ice cold butter.\n\n2.  The appetizer we had (pickle plate) was extremely small and qualified more as an hors-douevre than anything else.  Four bites, max.\n\n3.  Only four entrees and four apps on the menu; while I'm a big believer in not having TOO big of a menu--this was just too small.  We ended up going with the pork loin and the sole.  Both were very tasty, BUT each cost roughly thirty bucks and were almost comically small.  The pork loin couldn't have been more than 3-4 ounces, while the fish came with \"potatoes and grilled Brussel sprouts\", which while technically correct, yielded about three tiny sprouts cut in half, and an identical amount of potatoes.\n\n4.  For dessert we tried the \"Compressed cotton candy grapes and melons.\"  For the uninitiated, cotton candy has nothing to do with the dessert--it's the type of psychotically overpriced grape they put on the plate.  In essence, you pay nine bucks for 8-10 small bites of fruit.\n\nIn summary, none of the food at Bouche was bad--to the contrary, it was good (although not spectacular)...the problem was that Bouche is simply not a good value for the money spent.  For two of us (WITHOUT any wine/beer--water only) our total was almost $110.  And we walked out hungry.\n\nThere are half-a-dozen restaurants in the Nob Hill area that will take less of your money and absolutely impress you more.  Unless you're seriously addicted to French food and small portions, I'd look elsewhere.", "author": "Trey D."}

All the tables are up stairs while downstairs contains kitchen and bar seating (also available for dining).  \n\nFood- I was in an off mood so everything that evening was a little off for me.  But, even with that the food was very good.  The food also came out very fast.\n\nAppetizers- We order three to share which was a little much for two people.  But all three were very tasty.  I especially like the salt cod, and I don't especially like salt cod.  The soup and pork belly were also tasty but the fish won me over.  The salt cod came as a baked cheese spread with toasted bread which were topped with a spicy blend of herbs and vegetables.\n\nEntree- My partner ordered the salmon which I ate half and was very good.  cooked just right, slightly raw in the middle.  The glaze did not over power the taste of the fish.\n\nI ordered the venison which was done very well.  The sauce and herbs made it really tasty.  It wasn't gamy (I was hoping for a gamy taste) but still very good.  The meat was also very tender.\n\nDessert- We ordered the Creme Fraiche which came as two little bowls.  One of the Creme Fraiche and another with slated caramel.  That was her choice as I am not big on desserts.  It was sweet enough to fulfill her sweet tooth but not too heavy or large as to make us feel bloated.\n\nCriticism-  the only thing I really didn't like were the potatoes that were served with the venison.  I felt it made the dish have a slightly mushy consistency.  (this is being a little critical, but as my only complaint I thought you might want to know)\n\nOverall- I would definitely go back hands down.  I would like to go back and try their other meals for sure.

Forced ourselves to eat it because we were starving. The scallops were way over powered by salt less slaw of apples, cabbage, citrus, and tomatoes! Yes tomatoes! C'mon....no respectable menu has tomatoes right now. And garnished with so much oil that I was kinda grossed out by my slippery greasy lips afterwards. Not to mention the over powering flavor of raw shallot or onion. Idk which it was because I couldn't actually see it. It just didn't work. Sorry. Pork n beans- that was ok. I give it a 61/2. Could've gotten more if it wasn't cold. And lastly- the tartar. Slightly underseasoned and almost half of my fingerling chips stuck together making them soggy/chewy/leathery chips. We didn't even finish it. Server asked how it was and I said it was just ok with a disappointed face. Not worth going Into detail because they probably thought we were just picky eaters and not actual SF chefs (which we are). O well.

We made a 5:30 reservation using opentable.  They called us earlier in the day to make sure we were coming and of course, I said yes!\n\nPARKING:\nWe parked in a parking structure right by Union Square.  Don't remember what it's called [Sutter Stockton Garage] but  Bouche was literally a block away from the structure.  So it worked out quite nicely!  I don't remember the rates but depending on which hour of the day you park, you pay a different amount for each hour you're there.  It ranges from $1-$4.\n\nAMBIANCE:\nThis place is TINY! No wonder they made sure we were going to be on time for our reservations.  There's probably 25 seats total.  The main dining area is upstairs with 2-3 person tables.  And several seats downstairs by the kitchen.  I loved the feel of it. Very cozy, homey.  I loved all the decor, a nice antique look.  And the kitchen/line where they prep the food is pretty small and you can see everything going on.  It looked like all they had in the back was a dish pit.\n\nSERVICE:\nHeh, felt sorry for the servers who had to climb up and down the stairs, but they were very attentive and refilled our glasses when needed.  No complaints.\n\nFOOD:\nI'm guessing due to their small size and extremely tiny kitchen {if you can even call it that], it explains why their menu has very little selection.  But hey, I love it that way! Quality over quantity!\n\nSauteed Sweetbread, Porcini Cream, Chanterelles and Black Trumpet Mushroom Persillade\n\nIt looks like their dishes vary slightly than what's on their website.  It's small things though like the variety of mushroom they have on hand.  I believe online it says \"Lobster Mushroom Persillade\" but on the menu it was \"Black Trumpet\".  Just FYI.\n\nIt was my first time having sweetbreads WHICH is not actually bread.  If I tell you what it actually is you probably won't want to eat it [and now you're going to look it up if you don't know].  But it was delicious! The texture was lovely, crispy and soft on the inside.  Flavor was great and all the earthiness of the mushrooms complimented it well.  The only slightly negative thing I have to say was it was a bit too salty for me.  But overall, a great first try at sweetbreads and would love to eat it again!\n\nWild Greens, Caramelized Pear, Roquefort, Walnut and Endive Vinaigrette, Pepper Crust Bacon And Pickled Poached Egg\n\nDespite it being a salad, it was amazing!  The greens were mostly arugula.  The pear added sweetness and the bacon added crunch and saltiness.  We were told to break the egg, mix it with the vinaigrette and eat it with the salad. The roquefort was actually in the sauce as well. It was a delicious amazing salad.  The richness of the egg yolk and cheese balanced out the spicy bite of the arugula.  The acidity of the vinaigrette cut through the richness.  It was well balanced and really delicious.  It was probably my favorite dish of the night. [A salad?? No way! Yeah I know, thought it wouldn't happen either]\n\nPan Seared Petrale Sole, Crispy Porcini Risotto, Espelette and Carrot Puree, Lobster Cream Sauce\n\nThe sole was lovely.  Cooked well,, nice and tender.  The risotto {more like an arancini in this case) was delicious as well, added some texture.  The puree was amazing.  Smooth and sweet bursting with lovely carrot flavor.  And the cream sauce tying it all together.  This was definitely my parents favorite dish.\n\nCitrus and Honey Confit Lamb Shank, Ratatouille, Roasted Almonds and Pomegrante Couscous\n\nI was a little disappointed with this dish.  The lamb shank was tasty as was the rataoutille.  But everything was SO HEAVY, it need some kind of acid to cut through the richness.  The pomegranates and the citrus in the couscous helped a tiny bit, but after finishing the dish, I just wanted to drink some lemon juice, straight.  It was also a touch too salty, though I guess the lack of salt in the couscous made up for that.\n\nTomahawk Pork Chop, Butter Beans, Walnut and Quince Marmalade Grape and Cognac Sauce\n\nI didn't get to try everything on this plate together, but none of us REALLY liked this dish much.  The pork was a bit overcooked which of course meant dry.  The butter beans were alright.  I don't know, nothing really impressed me about this dish or left me wanting more.  \n\nOverall, a great experience.  I know I left a bit of a sour note [pun intended] regarding the food but really overall most things were executed well.

The service was great and the servers (maybe they were managers since 2 of them spoke with a French accent?) were very nice, patient and talkative.\n\nNow to the food, I liked the food, a lot actually (mashed potatoes oh nom nom nom) but it wasn't anything to brag about considering the price range. But on the other hand I'm one of those people who have a strong preference for very limited dishes (usually cheap, greasy food at grimy restaurants) so I don't think I can be the judge of that. In addition, I didn't get to taste any of the wines they have to offer but I'm assuming that is also a highlight of the restaurant.\n\nEither way, I really enjoyed my time there (may return in the future when I'm in the mood I suppose) and if you are not sure if you should try it out, I say go for it.", "author": "Mona H."}

Very cool, cozy feeling. The space is a bit tight, but hey! it is San Francisco! I like the arrangement of the restaurant, very cleverly laid out. \n\nThe wine list was not as complete for my personal taste, but they got some unique selection that other French restaurants may not have. The food...it was full of surprise and very original! We started with  bacon fougasse and duck confit, the duck confit was not what I expected, but it was delicious. I only wish it were not fried, it was a bit greasy for my personal taste. For the main course, we had chicken paupiette and red snapper. They were delicious, different style of presentation and cooking. The portions were perfect. For Americans or diners used to American styles, they might be on the smaller side. But the dishes were definitely quality!  \n\nFor desert, we had a goat cheesecake and beet ice cream. THAT WAS VERY unique and out of ordinary. The goat cheesecake was creamy and tasty, and beet compliments the taste in an ice cream format. Excellent idea! \n\nTo me, what was offered here was not an authentic traditional French cuisine, but the new French cuisine with a twist.

However, it didn't really matter because the dishes we ended up getting were excellent anyway!\n\nI made a reservation on Friday night about an hour before our actual reservation time (8:15 PM). Super win! We got there a little early, around 8. We were seated right away in the upstairs area. Ultra win!\n\nService was A+ great. The French-speaking waitstaff with their thick European accents really added to the overall flavor of Bouche. The interior is pretty small, but the ambience is great. They really use the dim lighting, dark wood, and metal decor to create a great, rustic atmosphere that really sets the tone for a great date night. To make the night even sweeter, the waiter realized that he didn't have enough wine to fill an entire glass for my GF. Instead of charging us half-price, or some small percentage, he gave us the wine on the house! Not to mention, all of our food was brought out in a timely manner, and our bread replenished without hesitation. Excellent service.\n\nThe food was amazing as well. I had the veal, which was accompanied by this amazingly, succulent, rich gravy with mushrooms. The veal was tender and easily cut with merely a fork. The GF got the kale-stuffed risotto which was crisped perfectly and accompanied with a pleasantly cool, minty salad and two complementary sauces (spicy and nutty). The portions were small, but that is to be expected from a higher-class restaurant such as Bouche. Just fill up on the free bread and butter if you must.\n\nTo top it off, we had the creme fraiche custard with some dessert wine, which was the happy ending to our happy meal. \n\nYou will not go wrong with Bouche if you're looking for that perfect, intimate restaurant to spend with your loved one!", "author": "Dan K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-01-15", "description": "*4.5 stars*\n\nI felt like I was reaching the end of my rope with Contemporary-American-French cuisine. Restaurant after restaurant, it just seemed like the same old dishes -- roasted chicken (or quail), braised short ribs, or grilled pork chop with some kind of tart fruit glaze. It got to the point where I started to never crave anything that was \"Contemporary-American-French.\" In fact, without foie gras, I feel like French food (at least in SF) has become boring in general. Tasty, perhaps, but boring. That is until I came to Bouche. \n\nNow, there were some small misses here and there, but honestly, the food at Bouche breathes so much new creative life into the SF food scene that it's worth those small flaws to enjoy a meal that actually makes Contemporary French exciting again.\n\n--------------\nFOOD:\n\nScallops:\nI loved the intricate and subtly sweet flavor to this dish. The dish is a cold dish, which kind of caught me off guard, but the scallops were insanely tender. \n\nMarinated Salmon:\nThis was one of my favorite dishes of the night. The salmon meshed perfectly with the crunchy (equivalent of a) bird's nest and the creme fraiche. I've never had anything like this before and it was an incredible first.\n\nLamb Shoulder:\nI normally don't like lamb due to its sour gaminess, but the lamb shoulder is cooked to absolute perfection. It tastes like a very tender braised beef short rib, which is awesome for those who normally hate lamb. What really makes this dish, though, is the sauce -- a sweet marmalade with crunchy almonds-- that really brings out the flavor of the lamb shoulder. I could've done without the tangy sorbet-like carrot coriander puree, since there was so much sweetness in the marmalade already. Perhaps a more subtle puree, like turnip or potato, would complement the marmalade better.\n\nVeal:\nThe veal had an amazing flavor, but it was a bit too well-done. Whatever flavors they used though, worked very well.\n\nCreme Fraiche Panna Cotta:\nThis dessert was a bit too boring and tasteless for me, except those moments when all you have in your mouth is salt (not enjoyable either). The caramel sauce was a nice touch, but it just needed something else to really make this panna cotta memorable.\n\n--------------\n\nBouche has an intimate, hidden atmosphere that really brings out a rustic, underground Paris ambiance. It's actually pretty cool. Kind of reminds me of the upstairs section of Gitane. \n\nShane, our server, was on point. Our water was always filled, our wine glasses were never empty. \n\nAll in all, what I love most about Bouche is that it really pushes the envelope when it comes to discovering wildly inventive flavors. Most of what I ate tonight brought flavors and textures that I've never had before, and it was incredible to experience. I'm impatiently looking forward to a return visit.", "author": "Roy C."}

Can't blame him because one of the two waiters who served us had on an incredibly loud outfit. Plum colored bell bottoms and a matching patterned rayon/silk shirt. He had the craziest shoulder length hair too. And some kind of chin-strappy facial-scape. He was quite a site and I wish I were brave enough to take a picture. \n\nBetween the 3 of us, we got to sample a good variety of their offerings. We even had two orders of the salmon; which, btw, wasn't hard because the portion was petite. It was also the best dish of the evening as it was minimally executed. It was like salmon tartar with thin crispy noodles. The pepper note really brought out the velvety texture of the poached egg.\n\nMy least favorite dish was the wild boar civet as it was tough and lacked flavor. Everything else kind of fell in between the salmon and boar. I also ordered the wild mushroom side dish, but it wasn't cleaned well; some of the mushrooms still had a bit of sand and I found a twig. We ended the night sharing the creme fraiche custard which I enjoyed because I like panna cotta. Even though it was heavy cream, it tasted light and refreshing.\n\nThe space is tiny, so do make a reservation. It is divided into lower level, which shares space with the kitchen, and a mezzanine level. We sat on top and I got a good view of the kitchen staff in action.\n\nThe ambiance is quaint and it's more fitted for an intimate get together with one other person. I recall coming here when it was Bar Crudo and thinking that same thought too. Service was attentive; the other waiter (sin loud outfit) kept our water/wine glasses replenished and cleared our plates in a timely manner. When it was time to pay our bill, he was very European about it and didn't rush us. I like the concept of French small plates and wish them success.", "author": "Beagle M."}

It was cozy and I liked how the upstairs overlooked the kitchen.\n\nThe other dish he ordered was the veal which I thought was dry, bland, and not very good quality. Tasted more like overcooked stew beef. The BBQ flavor to it was also a bit strange. Instead of the veal coming out it one succulent piece, it was already precut to little chunks. Which I also think is a bit of the scam considering the price of the dish, the precut pieces made it seem like there was more food than was actually there.\n\nI ordered the Duck Confit Croquant which were three meatballs made of duck. It was ok tasting but also very dry and a bit bland. I would have preferred Trader Joe's frozen turkey meatballs hands down. The cherry garnishings on it were good though.\n\nI also ordered the Pasta Prawn pasta sea urchin app and that was probably the worst dish there. It consisted of a few chunks of sea urchin which WERE very good and creamy. However it also only had two baby clams, half a dry baked prawn with the shell still on it. I could barely scrape any meat out. And a little piece of toast totally drenched in olive oil. I think it was supposed ot have some lobster on it, but it didn't appear to have anything but a bunch of pesto like substance on there. \n\nOverall my meal ended up being about $100 and for someone that just came from statebird provisions and spent the same amount on an amazing 6-7 course meal and dessert for about the same price, I was MAJORLY MAJORLY disappointed by Bouche and would not recommend that anybody come here. Except maybe for the salmon dish.\n\nI also tried their wine which I felt was more resiny tasting than other red wines (I forgot which one my friend ordered) and the waitress was not very friendly and acted a bit cold and annoyed.\n\nAlso their house bread is dry and bland.\n\nMaybe I ordered the wrong dishes?

Very creative ingredient combinations, sauces, and beautiful plating. Each plate was like a little adventure through a few different focuses and tastes that you could recombine in endless combinations of flavor. \n\nBouche also played with temperature and texture really well - things you expected to be hot might be cold (sous vide (?) poached egg, escargot), extremely hot, crunchy mushroom dish. This extends to the wine. I don't know how they do it in such a teeny place, but the red and white wines we had by the glass were all at the perfect temperature; something that is unfortunately not often the case at SF restaurants. The wine pairing suggested by our waiter were so perfect - he nailed all 3 suggestions. The wine list is excellent. \n\nWe had the arugula salad, duck confit croquettes, a delicious prawn pappardelle with lovely bits of ikura and creme sauce, side of wild mushrooms, and the quail special (stuffed w/veal, red wine reduction, escargot salad).

I have a theory about Bouche's 4.5 star average on Yelp, and I realize that sharing this theory is totally going to make me sound like a snobby SF foodie, but maybe that's what I am so here goes:  the vast majority of Bouche's glowing reviews are written by people from out of town who are not accustomed to really great food.  I am cringing as I say this, but I think it's true.  And admittedly, if Bouche existed in almost any other city in America, it would be very deserving of it's 4-5 star reviews.  \nUnfortunately, Bouche is in San Francisco, and that means it has ALOT of expectations to live up to.  And sadly, these expectations were not met.  The food was fine.  Nothing terrible.  But nothing great either.  If you are hungry and would like a nice meal, this fits the bill.  It's easy walking distance from Union Square so it's very convenient for all the out of towners staying in hotels around there.  But seriously- if you check where people are yelping from, a lot of the glowing reviews are not from locals.  Maybe that means something, maybe it doesn't.  But there it is.", "author": "Cindy W."}

Bar and kitchen are on the bottom floor and a small seating area is upstairs with about 6-8 tables for parties between 2-4 people. It's a tight space but I think it's cozy for the atmosphere it's going for.\n\nMy party of 3 split the marinated salmon, poached egg, and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche appetizer and it was amazing. Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche on the bottom with a basket of fried what I can only describe as super skinny \"noodles\" and smoked salmon on top. When you break the basket, the poached egg is inside. It was a perfect combination of textures and it was so light in flavors. Great start to the meal. \n\nI ordered the slow cooked cod, eggplant caviar, tomato tempura, and manila clams dish. My cod was cooked perfectly. I enjoyed the caviar as well - strong olive flavor. The tomato tempura was interesting yet again, another nice combination of textures. I think it was a great plate where every individual element really came together.\n\nMy friends had the lamb dish and the pork belly dish and I was able to try a bite of each.

This place is a mix of fancy pants French cuisine in a hole in the wall comfy setting (soft lighting, plenty of wood furniture, knick knacks for your eyes to wander over). In sum, this place should get you laid if you are not ugly.\n\nMake a reservation. Our group of 3 got lucky that someone canceled and they were able to seat us. There are two floors with the upstairs area being more quiet and intimiate (has space for about 15 ppl). It can get kind of cramped but that adds to the experience. \n\nDo yourself a favor and order at least the smoked salmon that is pictured on the front page. It rests on a nest of crispy noodles and there is a poached egg hiding underneath. All of this is swimming in some kind of fancy tartar sauce (i'm sure I offended the chef by calling it that).

It wasn't loud at all but the hustle of the staff, bustle of the  street and more so, the exciting sounds coming from the kitchen, of which we had a bird's-eye view, seemed to just all merge into an ambient noise. Out table for two was at the stair entry and I thought this would be a problem but it wasn't because once again, I had a great view, this time of watching each of the well prepared dishes make their way up the stairs by one of the two French waiters. \n\nTo be sure, the menu is limited: 8 appetizers, 4 entrees, 3 sides and 4 desserts with a wine list of maybe 70 bottles and 30 by the glass. But if you saw the space the chefs were cooking, you'd understand why. The kitchen space has room for two chefs and no room to squeeze by each other. The entire cooking process in its entirety is crafted in an area no larger than 60 square feet, which includes all equipment and room for the chefs. \n\nAs a side, there are 4 bar seats on the cooking side of the downstairs which may have an up-front view of the chefs but I only noticed those seats on the way out. The view may be obstructed; not sure. There are also 16 other barstool seats downstairs; 12 face the wall under the stairwell and 4 face the view of the street. Again, I didn't notice these seats until leaving but now a crowd of about twenty had formed waiting for seats (half in the cramped entrance and half outside) and the three people sitting in the window had to be tremendously cramped. \n\nStill, overall, the food and service was great. We loved the chunk of cheese, duck was juicy, tasty and had a great texture and the chicken, rarely ordered in a restaurant by me, was even more juicy and flavorful.\n\nBut the star of the night was the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche with caramel and sea salt. Exquisite. And I don't like sweets. \n\nThe person I was with who is well versed in fine dining said it was the best dessert she has ever had and I have to agree. \n\nThank you very much Bouche.

We ordered a wide variety - pork belly, scallops, eggplant, cod, steak, chickpea fries and risotto in tomatoes.  Of those dishes, I highly recommend the steak entree, the scallop appetizer and the pork belly.  I wasn't a huge fan of the cod, but it was still tasty.\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is that I arrived after my parents and the waitress told me my parents were sitting at a two person table, but that the adjoining table (to make it a table for four) was not ready yet.  That was perfectly fine, so my boyfriend and I went to drop off our bags at our friends house nearby and asked her if she could tell my parents that we would be right back.  She agreed, but then we later found that she didn't?  That was very confusing as it was her idea to tell them in the first place.  I'm sure she just forgot, but it was very odd.

The suggested wine, a 2010 Domaine Auchere Sancerre Rouge, fit the waitress' explanation to a T.  Very light, not too fruity, and lingers for a long time on the tongue.  What a delightful, almost musical pairing to our dish.  I'm buying a case when I get a chance.  We got a cheese plate to start, which came in a perfect portion size.  Each cheese... mmm mmm delicious.  \n\nMy entree was a pork loin with English peas, spring vegetables, and confit back fat consomme.  The waitress explained that the pork loin is slow cooked for 11 hours, and I could tell!!!  Incredibly tender.  And the broth that resulted was intoxicating and fragrant.  Man, that broth tasted good.  I'd have tipped the bowl up and slurped the broth down had I not been dining with 2 classy ladies.  \n\nWe finished up with some dessert.  The food was too good not to order more.  I got a berry/fennel salad with shortcake (more out of pure intrigue about the fennel).  It came in a long dish, with several components artfully arranged.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-09-28", "description": "Bouche - I AM A FAN.\n\nIf you read my review for L'ardoise, you would know that I think that this (along with Parc Central and L'ardoise) is one of the top three French restaurants in the City at this price range.  Let me tell you how to decide amongst the three: if you want safe, go with Parc Central; if you are on a date, go to L'ardoise; and if you are entertaining a \"foodie\" friend (wth that means these days because half of them are just gluttons with terrible senses of taste), go to Bouche.\n\nHere is why: Out of these three restaurants, and even amongst the higher priced and more well known ones, Bouche really is most avant garde with their dishes and pairings.  The best way I can describe some of their dishes is that they are deconstructed and then reconstructed.  Yes, we've all had food these days where the chefs break down the classic dishes into novel separate ingrediets - but the chefs at Bouche takes it a step further: they kind of put it back together into a dish that resembles the original dish but not really because it was deconstructed...\n\nWTF are you talking about?  Try ordering their White Corn Soup if that is on the menu.  You will know what I am talking about when you get it.  It's poetic!  Try the marinated salmon - is that a cured salmon sandwich?  No, it was deconstructed and then reconstructed!  \n\nMy only critique: My guess is that the head chef is one of these revolutionary new chefs from France that is moving away from the Michelin star system...not only because he is willing to try, but because some of his/her dishes does lack a bit of polish (e.g., their lamb can be a bit more polished in the roasting, as both plates I've seen were overcooked).  However, give him another 5 years and I am sure you will see him written about.\n\nLastly, the staff here are wonderful.  Just absolutely wonderful.\n\nConcluding thought: If you are in a long term relationship or are already married, come here instead of L'ardoise to change up the topic and pace.  You'll love it here.", "author": "Mark M."}

Then, we stumbled across this hidden gem. The atmosphere is quaint- be prepared to sit in tight quarters with strangers- however it's very fitting and a welcoming situation, given the atmosphere. You know when you hear most of the customers speaking French to one another, it's going to be good stuff. The menu is brief, but every single item is made so carefully and with love. We ordered a seafood and meat dish, and both items were very delicate and had rich flavor. The creme fraiche dessert was out of this world!", "author": "Kristina N."}

That's what makes dining here such a delightful experience. Straying from my usual Yelp reviews, I'll start with the atmosphere bc that's what I love most about this place.\n\nAtmosphere: It's a dim, cozy, intimate place. Sit at the bar to see all the action up close and personal. The kitchen is tiny tiny, so its really quite impressive. For a more romantic experience, sit upstairs near the window. You'll feel like you're dining in a small French bistro in Provence. \n\nFood: OK so it's not the best French food we've ever had, but it's still pretty good. The menu is small and manageable, which already a plus. So this is what we ate - \n-Green garlic soup - If you love garlic and creamy soups, this is your soup. Charred onions and garlicky croutons provide a nice crunch.\n-Halibut with butter beans - Light and flakey fish with hearty white beans. A little too much citrus flavor for my taste but still tasty. \n-Asparagus pasta - Pasta was al dente, asparagus puree was yummy. Actual asparagus spears were overcooked though. \n-Duck confit - Nice and salty but the meat was a bit on the dry side. I'm used to fall off the bone juicy duck meat from duck confits.\n-Sardines - Although the herby, vinegary, citrusy flavor was all there, I don't think I'm enough of a sardine connoisseur to appreciate the semi-raw almost rubbery texture of this particular dish. \n-Chickpea fries - Not recommended. Very dry, even with the BBQ sauce. Wait, BBQ sauce in a French restaurant? Exactly ;)\n\nService: Super friendly French hosts who make you feel like a regular right when step your foot in the door.\n\nPronunciation: Restaurant is pronounced \"Booosh\", like \"Bush\", the street it is on. ;)", "author": "Connie C."}

We were impressed and so were the guys because they were taking a picture of the dish.  My friend and I ordered this salmon dish, a beet and duck confit salad, a sardine salad, and a lamb dish.

It was so much fun finding it; you sort of feel like you are on the 'back roads' of the city, and yet it is right in the midst of all of the action. \n\nBouche could never be called just a tapas bar, because it's food is substantial (no need for hoarding); however, it's menu is designed with a French style, so the dishes are intended to be shared. If you were walking by it and blinked, you'd miss it as it is very small in terms of space, even though it is a two-story. However, whatever it lacks in sheer size, it makes up for it in taste. \n\n\nWe tried a number of different dishes (calamari, duck confit and beet salad, lamb, halibut, etc). All were memorable and delicious, but simple in the right ways. And the wine list had some great French selections at very affordable prices. \n\nThe staff, a group of French guys of course, was so much fun, and very accommodating. We actually had to rush out for the theatre (ACT - 'scorched'), and the team there was fast and helpful; they didn't take it personally. \n\nIt's probably worth noting that Bouche is open until 1 am.

Ended up at Bouche after searching for a late dinner spot  walking distance from my friend's Nob Hill apartment.  Everything closes so early in SF so bonus points for a kitchen open so late. Full menu at the bar and drinks are a reasonable price.\n\nService was borderline nonexistent.  There was 1 waitress for the whole upstairs (either 7 or 8 tables). Only half the tables were occupied yet our waitress rarely checked up on us and was impossible to flag down.  We went through the entire bottle of water at our table without it ever once being refilled nor poured into our glasses. Bottle wasn't refilled until she took the dessert orders. Not acceptable.\n\nMy buddy and I started with 3 appetizers: Chilled Summer Squash Soup with Ricotta, Arugula Pasta with Asparagus and Morels, and Beef Carpaccio.  Flavors were complex so kept the plates interesting. We enjoyed the starters slightly more than the entrees.  For entrees, I ordered Pork Loin, English Peas, Spring Vegetables and Confit Back Fat Consomme and he ordered Lamb Shoulder, Onion and Almond Marmalade, Carrot and Coriander Puree. I preferred the lamb.\n\nNow for the bad. Avoid both the Creme Fraiche Custard and the Tart of the Day: Lime and Nectarine Tart!  Trust me.  I'm normally very forgiving even with subpar desserts since I have such an insane sweet tooth, but dessert here was horrifying. Maybe it was overwhelmingly terrifying because it came so unexpected in juxtaposition with the great savory dishes but wow, the Creme Fraiche Custard tasted more like a flavorless pot de creme of...nothing. The Lime and Nectarine Tart was a disaster. Friend commented that nectarines tasted like canned fruit (ew) and the excuse for a tart crust was reminiscent of paper-thin cardboard. These \"desserts\" make Safeway's frozen desserts aisle taste like Johnny Iuzzini's creations at Jean George.\n\nSolid California-French fare (especially for the location and price point), variety on the menu, and great late hours, but skip this place if you're looking for attentive service and dessert that's even remotely edible.", "author": "Shelley W."}

We only could choose between veal, steelhead trout, risotto, and pork. Since we don't like veal or pork and the risotto was kind of blah, it would have been really nice to have beef or some other more creative seafood dishes.\n\nThe entrees were just a little bit disappointing. The steelhead was somehow a bit bland and the sides were okay but not at the level of the appetizers. The risotto was frankly, just above average but not great.\n\nThe wines were absolutely terrific - all French of course. In particular, we had the Couly-Duteil chinon blanc which was totally gorgeous. The vaucluse was dry but very impressive too.\n\nThe mackerel appetizer was very good. We had a leek soup which was also very good but it was extremely creamy, so be aware if you don't like too much thick cream. The octopus was great. The wild mushrooms were outstanding and perhaps I would call them the best feature of the whole meal. The flavor of those muchrooms was unforgettable.\n\nFor several appetizers, two entrees, and wine, we spent $116 for two people.\n\nThe atmosphere is very cozy and small and personal. They keep it very dim so that you cannot read the menu but it is romantic. The \"true French feel\" is all there.

It may be that, despite our reservation, we seemed to have waited eons before our table was ready. So by then, I was so hungry and disoriented I couldn't tell what I was eating anymore. I was just stuffying myself and making \"mmm\" sound basically. \n\nThe plates can be a little too chaotic for me.  The burrata salad and the octopus salads had very different components and yet their taste are similar, with a lot of tang.  The light is dim which is romantic, but it also meant that I couldn't tell what I was eating.  I wished those plates were a little simpler.\n\nThe highlight is the chilled corn soup. Rich and smooth. Beautiful texture and taste. \n\nMy main dish, the often mentioned marinated salmon, tasted a lot like eggs benedicte. In a strange way, it was disappointing because I was not physically prepared to have \"brunch\" at this late hour.  And marinated salmon tasted no different from lox in my mouth. \n\nSimilarly, the sardines which were raved in some professional review (can't remember which one), were a bit chewy and fishy. I  guess i had high expectations. \n\nOn the other hand, the space is full of ambiance.

The dining tables are upstairs, overlooking the kitchen, and there is room for probably 20 seats total. With the good acoustics, cozy feel, and romantic lighting, it is has the perfect atmosphere for a date. \n\nOur food was great too. Our table shared the Fougasse as an appetizer. I had to Google the word-- it is just French for Foccacia bread. The assortment included bacon bread, olive bread, and walnut bread. \n\nI had the creamy risotto rice topped with crispy baked artichoke. It was perfect. Every dish that came out was plated artistically. \n\n\nDessert-- The chef worked with the birthday girl's BF to arrange a special unique dessert for our table. It was a mixture of homemade ice creams, a chocolate torte, and quince. What a lovely touch. \n\nTo top it off, we had a very helpful French waiter (haha its an oxymoron, right?) who guided us through wine selection and made the evening very enjoyable. \n\nNote: No reservations accepted.", "author": "Bailey M."}

They have less then ten tables upstairs with some counter top seating downstairs.\n\nWe ordered the Chestnut Soup, Squash Cannelloni, Roasted Berkshire Pork Belly, & Lamb Shoulder.\n\nThe chestnut soup packed a lot of flavor; It definitely maintained the nuttiness, yet had a creamy and smoothed texture. The squash cannelloni was very....weird. The textures didn't work for me and the flavors were a bit confusing (unfortunately we didn't even finish half the plate). The pork was really good as expected, but I can't help but feel guilty after eating it. Now the lamb dish was delicious; the meat was tender and worked well with the marmalade. The carrot puree was a bit weird, but since it was presented on its own it didn't interfere with my lamb.\n\nOverall thoughts : When I walked in, I wasn't expecting this style of food. I was impressed (with exception to the cannelloni) and love the intimate setting. Definitely a good place for a date.", "author": "Stephanie K."}

Of course, that was where the fun started because at the next table, some d-bag had his chair slid way out and my GF could not get into her seat. Sensing our discomfort and having tried unsuccessfully to get the offending d-bag to move, we moved downstairs and enjoyed our bottle, along with some good banter.\n\nThe best part of sitting by the door was the people watching, and the wine was tasty.

While it was a bit stressful at first jumping in with no reservations, as long as you give the restaurant a call earlier the day of they'll do whatever they can to accommodate your party. I arrived early and was greeted by the restaurant's owner and a few members of the waiting staff - all French and all super friendly. They helped store my things and even helped me devise an elaborate dessert plate for the birthday girl (candle included!). Early on it became very clear to me that customers come first at Bouche.\n\nWalking in, you will see a narrow hallway with the open kitchen to your left and a stairwell on the right. There are dining tables on the first floor, but I highly recommend requesting seats on the second as you have a fantastic view of both the kitchen below and Bush Street just outside. The place sports dim lighting, plays soft music in the background, and caters to intimate dinners. Seriously, fantastic ambiance top to bottom.\n\nThe food speaks for itself at Bouche (as it should at all restaurants). Everything from presentation to taste was top-notch. Upon the main courses' arrival, the table conversation went from lively to \"mmmm\" and \"ooooo\" as we each bit into our respective dishes. I personally went with the lamb shoulder and nearly died of happiness after taking my first bite into the incredibly tender, juicy mouthful. Before I knew it, I was finished and sad. Thankfully, dessert followed, of which none was too sweet. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with the culinary experience, as I had no expectations coming in.\n\nIn short, this restaurant has it all.

So, I stayed. And, the smell didn't bother me after a few minutes. \n\nThe restaurant has a quirky feel to it. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the cheese plate which resembled a Georgia O'Keefe painting with all the bright colors and textures. It came with 3 different cheeses, greens, quince puree, grapes and all sorts of other things. It was both beautiful and delicious. The cheese portions were generous. \n\nFor entrees, BF had the bass and I opted for calamari with mushrooms. Both dishes were delicious. The calamari was spicy and had great texture. I feel like the dish had more mushrooms than calamari tho and that kinda disappointed me. The calamari was little tiny pieces. BF enjoyed his giant portion of fish with a delicious lemony white bean puree accompanied by whole beans making for a nice texture. \n\nOverall, it was a good experience. The food was well prepared.

The prices are actually quite reasonable, especially if you compare it to other French restaurants in the city that offer the same quality of food. \n\nDefinitely give Bouche a try.

Our hotel was just around the corner from this restaurant. We made reservations for 8pm. When we got there it is a small cozy french restaurant with a second floor. We dined on the 2nd floor where you can see the chefs whipping up your fine french cuisine. As  mentioned by other yelpers, their menu is very limited. We ordered the poached egg/smoked salmon and the cod along with the bread with olives baked inside of it. I guess you can say we are not used to small portions lol so we ended up picking up some sushi a couple hours later.\n\n Back to the food, since I am not a very picky eater I actually liked the poached egg with the salmon. The  creamy sauce went really well with the smoked salmon with the poached egg. I was not a fan of the cod all that much. Although, i did like the wine the waitress recommended. After dinner we decided to skip dessert so I can't really say all that much about it. \n\nOverall, this small place does have a romantic french bistro ambiance, but you need to be a hard core foodie to actually love and appreciate the small portion of food that is being presented. Come here to satisfy your taste palette, but unfortunately not your stomach. :)", "author": "Lynners C."}

We ordered our entrees and waited patiently for more than an hour, while the large party (who arrived after us) had their meals served to them.  We waited 20 minutes more before I finally asked our waitress about the delay.  She told us that they are very busy, and there were other orders in front of us (like the large party who ordered AFTER us, just par example) and then she went on to yell in my face 'and kitchen only has two burners!'  When the food finally did arrive, it was mediocre.  \nMy bf suspected the waitress was probably bumping the large order in front of us because she would take a bigger tip sooner.

I'm really guessing it was just an off, very late, late night (we came at around 11:00pm on a Friday night). Still, the food just left so much to be desired.  It's romantic-ish, we were on the top floor and as said in other reviews, what the chefs pull off in their tiny kitchen spaces is pretty cool.  If you go to the bathroom, you see a tiny little broom closet off to the side where one of the chefs was going at it.  I first thought it was a broom in a closet who was fairly animated, but no ... it was a chef.  And he was cooking some mean smelling shizzle.  But the food that came to us was pretty bland, not all that tasty, and just very fair (at best).  And for the price, you'd expect something more than that.  We had the lamb shoulder, and the crusted ?tilapia fish.  The fish was rather rubbery, had several bones, and was not very flavorful.  And the lamb shoulder definitely could have been seasoned stronger.\n\nI was really surprised at how I didn't enjoy the food.  The waiter was very charming, and put up with me and my wife on our cell phones the entire meal (definitely a restaurant fail move, but a pseudo-medical emergency was being actively managed while we ate)...  \n\nIf you want to give Bouche a shot, definitely go at a more normal eating time, try again, and hope for the best.

While I am not wise enough to provide the answer to this question, I am smart enough to know it when I see it, and this exemplifies one of my favorite destinations, Bouche. \n\nThe staff is French, but I don't mean it in the oft-cliche sense of the word. From the owner, Guillaume, to the dishwasher there is a warmth and joy and a sense of teamwork. From the tiniest kitchen you could imagine emerge the most meticulous, magnificent and on-point dishes. The chef has a deft hand and almost all preparations exceed expectations. Yes, a dish that may be your favorite might not be on the menu the next time you come in (unless like me your favorite is the house cured salmon with a poached egg in a potato birds nest), but this just just means that you should expand your mind and find a new favorite for the evening. Come prepared to experiment and you will not be disappointed. \n\nSeating is cramped, but in a way that encourages instant comaraderie between you and the couple next to you. A sensible wine selection includes reasonably priced offerings by the glass and bottle, as well as the essential splurge bottle. Beers on tap are excellent if you need something other than wine. \n\nA slice of France without the attitude or the plane ticket - a wonderful adventure every time you enter the door.", "author": "Steven B."}

The 3 of us diners had a reservation & were seated at the bar (per my opentable request)..I want to see the chefs make my food if i'm gonna eat it!\n\nWe ordered a great sampling of food & walked out happy campers. The fougasse was OMG, warm bread with bacon (or ham??) baked into the bread. It reminded me of chinese bakeries that sell/serve ham & scallion buns except this is way better because the pieces of bacon were bigger & just heavenly (5 pieces in an order, make sure u order 2 if more than 3 ppl in your group).\n\nI had the must try arugula salad w/poached egg. As suggested, mix it all up together..you get this fantastic creamy yolk wrapped with the peppery arugula & cured ham, fava bean puree w/the fried spring onion. I swear, poached egg in a salad takes things to a whole other spectrum..silky goodness.\n\nWe tried the english pea soup- a creamy, hammy based soup with some small potato chunks that was piping HOT (a good thing!!). We liked the soup as it wasn't just creamy but with the ham & potato, it gave texture. OOHH, fougasse dipped in soup..ahhh, tasty..\n\nEntrees-we ordered the Lamb loin, medium rare & the stuffed chicken. Both entrees were delicious. The lamb loin was good but next time, i personally might order it Medium (medium rare was just a bit too rare IMO but it wasn't my own entree this time around). I loved the haricot verts & summer squash salad that the lamb loin sat on..perfect summer veggies for the weird warm day SF experienced. Now, I rarely order chicken at a restaurant w/the fear of DRY chicken but the chef recommended it & i went with it. Finally, a chicken that wasn't dry & it was perfectly seasoned, paired well with the poached(?) half peach. It also came w/brussel sprouts cream which I thought was creamed spinach until i looked at the menu again..who knew? it was a nice take on that little cabbage! \n\nWe also tried the polenta & comte side dish--yum, I can eat this all the time. The polenta texture & creaminess was perfect with the slight cheddary nutty comte cheese mixed in. \nChef also sent out a complimentary dish of the wild mushrooms medley which I was eyeing on the menu but I thought spicy apple sauce would be weird. The spicy apple sauce definitely toned the woody-ness of the mushrooms. These really were wild mushrooms & definitely had the strong funghi, woody, umami flavor but with the apple sauce (which i thought was odd at first), i can see why it goes together. It had that interesting sweet/savory balance, not really spicy at all as noted. \n\nWe shared the creme fraiche custard w/sea salt & the caramel creme(was it creme? it definitely was caramel flavored) dessert. That was really good too, a creamy, not overly sweet dessert but at this point we were stuffed beyond belief. Of course, we still finished every bite of the dessert. \n\nPortions are not big by american standards but I prefer it that way. You can order different dishes to share, taste, eat & still be stuffed. All the food had such different tastes, flavor profiles, textures that it's just amazing to think it came from that small kitchen. I cannot wait to try the smoked salmon next time w/fougasse!!!\n\nAlso, they had a great selection of french wines by the glass or bottle & interesting microbrews. We enjoyed our glasses of Neri Rose wine, it was slightly dry & refreshingly chilled\nSuper close walking distance to Sutter Stockton garage (a huge plus in my book). Service was attentive & friendly, food was yummy & it had that really cozy bistro feel which i really enjoyed. I will come back again..even at midnite!

They do have upstairs tables but few and they probably require reservations. When one pays these prices and when the food is this long to come out and when the service is fairly inattentive, I want comfort for the time I am there. The bar seating does not offer such comfort.\nThe quality of the food and cooking is average at best although it is nice to experience something different for a change. \nMy stuffed chicken breast was actually thigh but it did work better than a breast would have for the flavors. The sausage in the stuffing was not crumbled up enough so that I actually had large fried pieces that had to be cut in order to eat. The restaurant was not busy so this was just carelessness.\nMy son said that his small meal was not an entree but rather a salad with a garnish of lamb. The lamb was cooked perfectly though it was the size of one lamb chop.\n The trout appetizer on the potatoes was quite a pleasant surprise but make sure to get all the different parts of it in your bite for the experience to really count.\n My husband's halibut was fine but again quite small portions. \nWe had appetizers and entrees and left hungry after sharing a wonderful pannacotta. When we got home we continued to be hungry despite spending $140 on the dinner for 3, not counting alcohol. At home we had snacks to fill us up which is not the way one wants to wrap up their pricey French restaurant experience.\nI eat out alot and this is overpriced for the fare, for the quality, for the portions, for the ambience and comfort.\n\nDid our waitress really have a French accent or was it affected or enhanced?

Everyone, staff and guests alike, seemed to speak French. The music was pleasant and part of the background, not part of the feature. And the kitchen is open, so if you are seated in the right spot you can watch the cooks and chef at work.\n\nOverall:\nI hesitate to give 5 stars, because that tends to mean everything was/is perfect. It's not. But our experience was excellent and for the price point you will be challenged to do better. We will return, and recommend this place highly.", "author": "Aaron H."}

We had two appetizers -the asparagus and the sweetbreads. The sweetbreads were really yummy. We had beef for our main course - it was perfectly cooked and tender. Our dessert was the caramelized pineapple - also excellent. So why the 2 star review? It is because our waiter was so condescending, arrogant, aloof and unwelcoming that we will not return. For one example, when we asked for a recommendation of wines to pair - he simply pointed at an entry on the wine list with a slight look of bemused disgust on his face. No description, no discussion, no words at all - just a jabbing finger. We were never treated like this on one of our several trips to France!", "author": "Diane S."}

I remember climbing those urine scented stairs in my youth from Stockton St. below to get to the top, where there really wasn't much to see.\nIt's conveniently located next to the parking garage which is dirt cheap for parking after 6pm (a buck an hour!!).  \nThere are few seats in the downstairs located to the right of the front door, but it's counter seating.  We went upstairs to the \"dining\" area which had 18 chairs, a bit more crowded than the usual 14 they normally seat, according to the waiter asst.  who made sure I knew he was \"French\" because his English was limited.  Our waiter spoke perfect English.\n\nWe tried 2 glasses of French wine (red and white) recommended by the waiter, pricey per glass but very, very good:  GL Beaupre $14 and GL El Moli $14.\nMeal:\n1. Arugula Salad, $9.  Hubby liked the dish a great deal. I remember nuts and pomegranate seeds in it.\n2. Mackerel salad, $12.  Not many pieces of mackerel in it, considering it's mackerel season.  It was good.\n3. Steelhead entree, $22.  The waiter warned me that it was raw. Gently seared on the outside, it came in a rounded chunk of fish, definitely raw inside.  It was just OK for me. I love sushi but this didn't appeal to me too much, then again, I don't like seared ahi that much either.\n4. Duck breast, $26, about 6 slices of duck, very tender. Hubby enjoyed it.\n5. Side of polenta, $6.  Nice amt of cheese and creamy.  This dish I would order again.\n6. Americano coffee, $3.50.  (don't expect a lot)\n7. Tarte (tart of the day).  The folks next to us had it and said it was choc.  I didn't taste any choc but thought it was fig or something.  I think the waiter told us it had choc, $8.\n8. Mousse, $9.  A lge tablespoon of white choc mousse, another of cream, and a 3rd scoop of a berrylike substance.  Meh.\nRoom temp bread comes to the table with cold butter only if you ask for it.\nOverall, I would come back because it's really a gem in the neighborhood but I might try something else instead.", "author": "Ry T."}

We had no reservation, so we came early and were seated at the Chef's Bar. The \"show\" was as good as the food. The deft prep in this airplane cockpit sized kitchen was fairly mesmerizing. We twice noticed the chef halt the \"sous chef\" from serving a dish while a tiny correction was made. Also, each time they needed to touch something (for instance a quail egg) that could possibly contaminate, they pulled on a pair of clean kitchen gloves. The plates were simple and delicious and fairly well priced. My husband is a \"reverse\" food snob. A whiff of anything francophilian and the place is already down a star in the door. In the end, he was in love with his beef dish and I can't stop thinking about the Creme Fraiche Custard. Poor reviews are more fun and snarky to write, but this time..

Our reservation was right at 5:30, when they open.\n\nThe upstairs dining room is small, with dim lighting. Our first courses were served promptly: English Pea Soup with a Croque Monsieur Bite, the Mache Salad with a Pickled Poached Egg, and, for my husband, the Crab Mashed Potatoes which is a side dish.\n\nOur waiter didn't realize that the Crab Mashed dish was meant to be a first course and so we had to ask for it.\n\nThen, we had an over an hour wait for our main courses. Each dish is prepared to order in a tiny kitchen downstairs. But, since we were among the first in this tiny place, this was not acceptable, particularly because our server never indicated that there were any \"problems\" with getting our meals to us.  After we complained, they explained that our food had been served to another table!!! \n\nBut, when we did get our food, it was wonderful: Marinated Flank Steak, Pan Seared Rock Cod, and a special meat dish for the day.\n\nThe food is outstanding, but, be prepared for a leisurely meal, possibly a bit too leisurely. Come here for outstanding French food. Don't come before you are going to theatre, as you will be stressed wondering if you will be there a curtain time; save it for after a matinee, or just a night out of dining.\n\nI highly advise going early to assure getting seated when you arrive.

Apparently, their menu changes, so if you're coming here for the Pork Belly, call in ahead!\n\nTo somewhat compensate for the lack of Pork Belly, we got the Fougasse which supposedly had bits of bacon in it. No idea why everyone thinks it's the best bread ever. It just tasted like cold, dry, dusty bread and didn't even come with any olive oil! :( We also got the potato soup, salmon with egg, and roasted veal. The salmon was probably the best dish as the crunchiness at the bottom was perfect with the salmon and the yolk smeared all over it. Everything else was just okay.\n\nBouche's ambience is definitely a plus though. Upstairs, it's charming with the dim lighting and soft music. Good place for a date. Downstairs, it feels more like a bar so it's better for drinking with your friends.", "author": "Kate Y."}

We split everything we ordered, starting with the arugula salad and squash soup. I will have dreams about that soup!

The ambiance is very cool: dim lights, old world decor, dishes made out of clay (which add a different but good flavor to the exquisite food), and excellent chefs. My opening salvo consisted of a creamy chestnut soup  with buttered croutons and a hint of pork, followed by a pork dish made in three different ways on top of a potato pur\u00e9e with a jam of some delicious sort on the side. The wine pairing was excellent and done at the recommendation of the staff.

Dessert was probably the worst.  $9 for a chocolate mousse, but it was literally one spoonful of chocolate, and one spoonful of whipped cream.\n\nMaybe folks in SF are not big eaters and are happy with paying $14 for three pieces of fish, but there are better meals to be had elsewhere.", "author": "Jay C."}

No need for reservations which was nice and, where we were seated (upstairs), made for a more private setting for us. We wanted to sit at a table by the window because we didn't want to be crowded up next to another table of 3; unfortunately, the host told us to move to the table next to the table of 3 because he wanted to save those tables for couples who were going to come in later that night. Needless to say, my friends and I struggled to be comfortable at the table we were at, the guy next to us wouldn't move his chair because he thought he needed all the space for his skinny tush and what really topped off my sundae was the fact that no other couples or groups of people came in. The only thing that saved dinner was the dessert; these delectable items need to be recognized! We ordered the Milk Chocolate & Caramelized Hazelnut ($7) & Creme Fraiche Custard ($7) and both were a hit! \n\nOverall: Food was pricey, portions were small (we went back down to Westfield to munch on a large order of fries and had large tapioca drinks afterwards), food was barely lukewarm upon arrival to the table, dessert was great, service was average.", "author": "Carol L."}

The ambiance is pretty nice, rustic in a trendy kind of way. The place is tiny though, so I probably wouldnt come with a larger group and without a reservation. \n\nThe food was honestly mediocre. I really wanted to like this place after hearing such great things about it (all the reviews below and it got written up in SF eater). My friend and I got the bacon studded bread (Fougasse?) and the cheese plate to start. The bacon studded bread was ok. It was pretty heavy on the salt, and overall it tasted like a dense, kinda doughy roll with a random bit of bacon every now and then. The cheese plate was good, but that being said, its a cheese plate. \n\nI ordered the monkfish tail, which came with a small side of fried shallots and roasted leeks. The fish was cooked well, but overall the dish was disappointing: the fish was bland and too oily as were the \"roasted\" leeks. My friend got the marinated salmon with a poached egg, which was also just OK. It came in a giant nest of some sort of fried crispy \n\nMaybe my expectations were too high, but I think that restaurants like this serve up a lot of pretension without following through.

We had the cheese appetizer, wine, the brussel sprouts, duck, flat iron steak, cream fraiche and tart of the day.  To us the stand outs were the bread ( truly authentic), the wine ( recommended by our waiter after hearing our preferences), the brussel sprouts, the steak, and the cream fraiche.  Our waiter was knowledgeable and helpful, engaging without being too pushy.  All of the food was excellent and satisfied our French cravings and with a true French waiter and small cozy setting we felt we were transported out of San Fran and over to France itself.

Next was the Grilled Lamb Loin, Summer Squash and Harricot Vert Salad, Tomato and Mint Relish, Black Olive Vinaigrette.

Charming ambiance (wall moldings decoupaged with vintage newspapers a cute touch)! Good service - we had everything we wanted at all times (there seemed to be a tag team of friendly Frenchmen serving us, but it worked well). Good selection of wines, and our server had the requisite knowledge to suggest excellent pairings. The menu is not large, but is varied enough to offer something to suit most tastes - except maybe vegan. For starters my husband and I shared the exceptionally tasty salad of wild greens, Roquefort and poached egg. Not sure what about it was surprising, but somehow it was. In a good way. After that husband had something he enthusiastically praised involving lamb, but I was so absorbed with my eggplant Napoleon at that point, I wasn't paying that much attention. Really nice balance of flavors. This sort of dish can be so easily ruined - boring, or greasy, or any number of other flaws, all of which this chef adroitly avoided. Super yummy.

The waiter quickly replaced it, but couldn't he have detected the strong musty smell before he served it? Lovely salad with greens, pear and walnuts and poached egg dressing. Petrale sole was delicious, as others have agreed, though the carrot puree and lobster sauce were very sweet. Great goat cheesecake, but the beet ice cream was a little strange.

The seating area is small and the menu is limited - but the food is great. They did not have a green salad on the menu - but when I asked for one they created it just for me. Service was excellent. The cheese plate was original and delicious and the pork was full of flavor and melted in your mouth. We will definitely go back.", "author": "Gail P."}

You feel like you've stepped into Paris, wonderful lighting, a unique and charming space. Both from the bar and upper dining area you can see the open kitchen, which is great fun. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly -- and very French. And the food is sublime. I especially recommend the chestnut soup (wonderfully rich, and it comes with delicious little vegetable crisps) and the red wine beef cheek stew (so delicate and tender!). If you request the (free) bread, you won't be disappointed, it's fresh baked. The wines are also a treat, though the pours are on the short side. I'll definitely be going back -- I'm always looking for a new favorite spot in the city, and Bouche has become one!", "author": "E D."}

Server was alright but not very personable. Food is where it kills me, how do people rate this high? Confit croquants were dry and had the weirdest ingredients that would have masked any subtle duck flavors(horseradish like flavor for one). Tartar could have been more nicely balanced with salt, mush less basil and with something other than partially soggy plantain chips...and that was the my favorite. Why would a french restaurant take it upon themselves to change a classic tartar recipe, which works, to an Italian failure with basil and parmigiano? The lamb dish was where it fell flat, they marinated the shank and then cooked it for 6 hours? It was hard to tell this was lamb vs dry stew beef. The plate was ugly and quite small, french is supposed to be complex yet simple in the preparation used. Getting the most out of the technique vs the amount of ingredients, these guys seem to be serving up poor contemporary American with a french wine list. I should have stayed in, my french cooking is worlds above theirs...maybe I should open a restaurant.", "author": "Michael W."}

Has the rustic French look in decor and it is tight and small so it has the crowded feel but in a good way. I will be telling people to go here. Both fish and lamb shoulder were cooked to a very nice tenderness and paired well with the recommended wine. Loved it!", "author": "Tasha O."}

Yes I can see how people say the portions are small, but don't expect bigger at a French restaurant. This is pretty standard. We had the soup, calamari (tangy and tender), white fish, and poached salmon (absolute favorite). We had the hazelnut dessert which was amazing. You can tell the owner cares about your experience. And that's all that truly matters--besides the food. We've had a few great experiences here and I'm sure we'll be back.", "author": "Rana K."}

The side of polenta was delicious and the cheese plate was only lacking some sort of toast or cracker to eat it with.  We loved the custard dessert and left full and content.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  Lovely atmosphere felt like we were in an intimate European restaurant.  About 8 small tables upstairs.  Unisex bathroom is off the dishwashing station.", "author": "Nancy H."}

The prices are reasonable and the food is delish as were the red wines we had - such delicious red wines! We had to wait a while for our table in the cramped bustling downstairs, but our wine and the atmosphere made the time pass pleasantly. We had the corn soup and mushrooms for appetizers - both were good, although the corn soup is quite sweet, prob not the best choice if you are in a savoury mood. Then we had the pork belly and the salmon. I especially loved the pork belly, and I enjoyed the salmon as well even though I am not usually a fan of smoked salmon. At the end of the night we noticed that they forgot to charge us for our wines downstairs and when we informed the staff, the manager thanked us for our honesty and said it was on the house! To top it all off, the staff were very hardworking and friendly, and I also enjoyed the music they had playing in the restaurant. I'm leaving Sf soon, and I'm so sad I didn't discover this place until now. I will try to go several more times before I leave!", "author": "Anji C."}

The vibe at this place is warm and inviting, the food is superbly prepared in the tiniest of kitchens. We love marveling at the chefs' execution almost as much as eating their offerings. The owner and servers are knowledgeable about the Alsacian cuisine and the creativity in every dish is impressive.  Ignore previous paid reviewers who criticized the over ambitious combinations of favors. That is actually the genius of the fare here.  There is nothing to lose in trying this reasonably priced, inventive and just plain fabulous place!", "author": "Neira F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-12-17", "description": "I found the upstairs dining room of Bouche recently on a Friday night to be anything but luxurious and cozy. It felt overly dark (the women at the table next to us had brought their own flash lights) and verging on oppressive considering how small the space is. And, there was not a single adornment on the walls...no artwork, no memorabilia, nothing except for the scones which gave off hardly any light. All in all, the upstairs ambience was like sitting in a dimly lit cave. The aroma from the kitchen directly below us was lovely but the noise coming up to our table of dishes clattering and pots being flung into the sink was jarring and overly invasive. The lamb shoulder is exceptionally delicious. It would be helpful if the waiters pointed out that it is JUST the lamb with a teaspoon of sweet potato puree. I would have welcomed the opportunity to order a couple of sides but alas it was too late by the time our main courses arrived.", "author": "Alison R."}
