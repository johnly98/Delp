Every time I walk past, I admire and chuckle at the folks in line all wide-eyed and excited to try the notorious cruffin. Super glam IG models pose with their box of Mr. Holmes goodies in front of the sign. All day every day. Reminds me of when I first heard of this place as well.\n\n1) it's a sketchy neighborhood but worth the journey. My car has been broken into 5x in one year but these all happen overnight.\n2) IG hype is real. Still two cruffins per person at 9am. However if you're here for anything else, the bakery actually opens earlier.\n\nBut okay, being super local and not affected by the hype, let's talk about the actual pastries. Are they good? Yes, yes they are. They're worth it as a treat once in a while as those things are $$$. Their croissants look overdone and burnt but they're definitely in the top 4 croissants in SF in my books. I've heard mixed reviews of their donuts but I actually think their donuts are a LOT better than the rest. Their donuts are deep fried fluffy pillows that leak grease through 5 layers of anything. They are sprinkled with sugar and filled with something. So depending on the day, the flavor may not be your gig, but the actual dough is different than your typical ring shaped donut. \n\nOne of the things I still admire is how they create the flavors so well. Having had more than 10 different cruffins, I can say they are not always consistent. Some are drier than other times. Other times I like the filling more than the pastry itself and other times it's vice verse. I judge based on convenience and not by flavor as it's pretty good every day and I'm not picky about flavors. Get ready to shell out that dough for yummy goodness. This place was a gem to me when I first had it and still is a gem to me to this day.", "author": "Josie W."}

I heard flavors of cruffin change everyday. I'd like to go back and try other flavors! I also got their matcha croissant. Matcha coating wasn't overpowering but it didn't really taste like matcha.

I had a friend visiting in town from New York City, knowing that I had to show her how we also eat good in the West Coast. \n\nWe got in line about 9-9:30, they say the earlier the better because they make a limited amount of cruffins, which are crossover between muffins and croissants with a flavored cream that is made to PERFECTION. Everyday they have a different filling, such as, matcha, pineapple, apple etc. The bakery also, has other pastries such as chocolate filled croissants, danishes and cookies and of course coffee!! \n\nThe infamous cruffins, are flaky and sugary from the outside, however I was concerned that they might be too sweet, but I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of the filling especially, it is the perfect level of sweetness!\nThe goodies range from $3-6 for each or you can get a better deal if you buy half a dozen.\n\nTypically, there's a line outside the bakery to get in, usually about 10-15 minutes. \n\nAesthetically, the bakery is trendy! They have a light up sign where people take pictures, it says \"I got baked in San Francisco\" however space inside is very limited.

I ended up choosing the churro crossaint and the chef's choice donut (flavor was speculoos). The crossaint was amazing, it was flaky and custard inside was great, and it was perfectly coated with cinnamon and sugar - highly recommend. The donut though, I could've done without. I couldn't really taste the speculoos flavor and it was just overall meh. I feel that the donuts and cruffins are pretty hyped up, and the other pastries they sell are underrated. I'd definitely get their other items instead of the donuts and cruffins. But if I happened to be there early enough where cruffins are still available, I definitely get one. \n\nOverall, Mr Holmes is pretty good.

(#truemillennial) I won't lie, I didn't even know what I would end up getting since I'm not really into sweet pastries. A Cruffin does not appeal to me at all; a ham and cheese croissant, on the other hand... yeah, I could eat one every day. So when I rolled up super early on a weekday morning I was thrilled to see a pastrami croissant just behind the glass of the counter. You bet I scooped him up right away. I was intrigued by the peaches and cream croissant as well, but I figured one would certainly be enough. I was right, since this was technically my first breakfast. (Calories don't count on vacation, or so I've heard. Or told myself.)\n\nThe ladies working the counter were friendly and wonderful even as I stood around taking an appropriate number of Instagram photos before I dug into my treat. It was delicious - like a Reuben crossed with a croissant somehow, without the heft of sauerkraut yet still tangy in some way. Who knows, it was awesome and I devoured it. \n\nGetting there early is obviously key, especially if you want to get that perfect photo or a cruffin.

You have to order a total of 6 pastries to get a box (which I wanted). \n\nMy boyfriend and I got 3 mcruffins, a matcha croissant, a peach croissant, and churro croissant. This was too much for four people. We ended up tossing half of the pastries out since we were only in SF for a week and had other places to eat at :( \n\nTo be honest, amazing pastries but not worth waiting more than... 20 minutes for.

They typically place the pastries individually in a white parchment like bag but since I wasn't eating them immediately, I asked for a box. The boxes are for when you order at least 6 items but I didn't mind paying extra for a it. I just wanted the ease of transportation and for the cream not to get everywhere. As for the cruffin, the chocolate earl grey cream was delightful. The flavor was literally as it's labeled. The cruffin itself has a sugary coating so eat with caution. That stuff gets everywhere!

I mean, how can they perfect the \"cr\" part of \"cruffin\" without first perfecting the croissant??! right?? it just makes sense.\n\nCome here, skip the cruffin line, and buy a giant box of every other pastry they have..you won't be disappointed! \n\nP.S. if you're worried about the crazy line, it isn't nearly as crazy as it was 2 years ago! I got here at 8:50am on a friday and was only 12th in the cruffin line! Probably has to do with them opening up additional locations. :)", "author": "Jennifer S."}

Every type of pastry neatly stacked! Happy to see the variety of selection. \n\n- Ordered Matcha croissant (half of the croissant dipped in matcha flavored white chocolate, and no custard filling) & Cruffin. The Matcha croissant tastes very average, nothing too impressive. The covered matcha chocolate didn't really taste like authentic green tea, but rather like white chocolate. Was a bit disappointed that there was no matcha filling in the matcha croissant. (.....Been riding the SF Matcha wave)\n\n- The aesthetics of baked goods, store interiors, packaging (hot pink paper bag w/ a white peace sign like the logo) are all trendy! The branding is perfect. Definitely came in for the neon lights & IG-worthy picture.\n\n- The space is petite, more of a grab-n-go breakfast spot (closes @ 3 pm too). People were standing around. The only bench is below the neon lights.

There are a lot of other bakeries in San Francisco where you can get better tasting pastries for 50c-$1 less. \n\nThe best time to go (if you're not trying to get cruffins) is before 9AM b/c you can skip the separate cruffin line and go straight into the bakery. It's a super small place, so definitely grab-n-go. \n\nI tried almost everything on the menu, and the standouts for me are: \n\n1. Ramos Fizz Donut (or any flavor donut) ($3): The donut is super light and airy, yet chewy which makes it super fun to eat. Ramos Fizz turned out to basically be a lemon/citrus flavor, which was really good! \n\n2. Coffee Stout Croissant ($5.8): I can't believe I paid almost $6 for a croissant, but I really really liked this flavor combination. You can really taste both the coffee and the stout,  yet the two bitter flavors don't overpower the croissant at all. \n\n3. Cheesecake Creme Brulee Danish ($4.8): Cool twist on the typical cheese danish! The creme brulee part on top was delicious. \n\nI was a little disappointed in the matcha croissant. I thought it would be filled with matcha creme or something on the inside, but it was just dipped in matcha white chocolate (which basically tasted like just white chocolate).

There was a line of about ten people in front of us. We made it there a few minutes before 8 AM. In fact another couple walked by & asked why were we standing in line. The gentleman in front of me told them that his sister said one must come here for fabulous baked goodies! That couple instantly decided to stand in line too!\n\nOriginally I wanted coffee but that idea fell by the wayside bc I wanted to focus on what baked goodies to order. Their cruffins weren't available until nine. So I chose the churro donut, blueberry cheesecake bostock & a pastrami croissant for hubby (I know right? He saved half for me! LOL)! The sales ladies were very pleasant and helpful if you had questions yet not holding up the line! Be aware the shop is very small. Maybe a few seats for a few people & a small window bar area for two.\n\nActually we sat against that popular wall for five minutes while I had my amazing churro donut. It was filled with oozing liquidy delicious custard filling that placed me in sweet donut heaven. Omgosh! I rarely eat donuts so I seriously got my fix here!

Mr. Holmes Bakehouse was a cute little bakery with unique pastries and an IG worthy wall with a hilarious lighted sign. I got the matcha croissant and donut with coffee flavored filling. Both were incredibly delicious, but if I could change one thing, I'd add a matcha type filling for the croissant. The staff was very nice and was helpful with the customers' questions about what they should try first. The space is small, but it's understandable because you come in, get your pastry, take a pic by the wall, and go on about your day. I can't wait to go back and try the other flavors!", "author": "Johnny B."}

I had no clue until we visited here, it's basically a croissant baked in the muffin tin and stuffed with daily flavors. Wished they offer two flavors a day but I guess that is the hype so you would visit daily to see the flavor of the daily.  Or maybe they just make them during the weekend? Not sure.. Any how we got there around 9am and the line was already long, after about 10min wait a lady came out to give a stickers that guarantees you 2 cruffins. \n\nWhat I didn't get was that if you didn't want a cruffin you didn't have to wait, you can just walk in and purchase there other pastries which they have a variety and unique flavors. The cruffin flavor for the day was blood orange which we ordered, as well as the matcha dipped croissant, donut in a cup with chocolate mouse and I think it was chai, and a lemon pear verbena pastry. Just Note: If you want your cruffin in a pastry box you have to order 6 or other pastries to fill the box. Since the cruffin has to be standing up they insisted that if you want the box we had to order additional items. Good thing my friend and I were able to share a box. They should have smaller box options, you can have it in a paper bag but we're site seeing so it was better to have it in a box.\n\nOverall, the flavors was good, the blood orange filling in the cruffin kind of reminded me of orange yogurt, the donuts was the bomb fresh yummy goodness, the matcha croissant is basically a flaky croissant dipped in matcha so as expected, the lemon pear really good. A must when you want pastries!\n\nAlso they have a cute lighted sign you can take pictures!", "author": "Julie Ann I."}

From the infamous crufin, to their buttery croissants, to savory danishes, and cookies too. Oh and donuts that rotate as well.  Everything here is satisfying and will keep you coming back for more....well at least that's what it does for me. \n\nSo far my favorite things have been their almond stuffed cruffin (the cruffins change quarterly, so do the donuts.) I'm glad I live here because it's nice to stop in during the week.  Even during the week the line can get long.  At 9am is when they start serving cruffins and it's first come first serve.  Once they run out, they run out.  They don't make any more for the day,  so get there around 8:40am if you plan on getting a cruffin.  I can't even imagine what it's like on the weekends.  The have the infamous \"I got backed in San Francisco sign.\" Great photo op after you purchase your goods.  Back to the baked goodness, I love the ham and cheese croissant ($5) , the strawberry jalape\u00f1o bear claw -runs about $4.5, and their savory bread pudding ($4).  Definitely worth a try if you are visiting.  Staff are friendly and the line goes by quickly.  Not really any seating inside, except a few stools by the window, so be prepared to stand in the street while you eat your delicious goodies.", "author": "Adrianna P."}

Guava cheese is one of my favorite food combinations.  No way I was passing that up.  I came straight from the airport.  There was a short line.  The people in front of me didn't know what they wanted so let me go ahead.  I got the Guava Cheesecake Cruffin and a Rest In Peach Croissant.  I was disappointed that the small seating area was taken up by a group who had bought several boxes of items, but were just sitting on their phones not eating or taking pictures of any of them.  They were there before I got there and still there when I left.  I didn't see any benches or anywhere I could eat nearby.  I ended up eating on a newspaper rack around the corner.  The Cruffin was my favorite.  The filling is what made it amazing.  The croissant was good but I didn't get any peach flavor which was strange considering the name.", "author": "Heather N."}

Also, you can look ahead of time on their website to see if the cruffin flavor is something you'd want. \n\nIn addition to the two cruffins I got, I bought the california croissant, cornflake cookie, two donuts, and a chocolate croissant. To get the box, you must buy 6 items. Everything was pretty worth it, especially the cruffins and cornflake cookie (such an interesting texture and flavor combination!). \n\nThere isn't much seating, so my friend and I brought our pastries to a nearby coffee shop and munched on our pastries while sipping on coffee. 10/10 way to spend your Saturday morning! \n\nI'm just sad that most of the items are seasonal, so if you try to come back in a year, it's likely some of the menu items are gone (sad reacts).", "author": "Bradford L."}

After reviewing it on Yelp, I was convinced to make it and try a cruffin.  Thank goodness I got two things to try:\n\nGrapefruit Ginger Cruffin\nPROS:\n- super crispy and yet fluffy croissant dough\n- not overly sweet crust\n- not overly oily\n- good sized portion for the price\nCONS:\n- way too sweet: I'm not sure if the filling was too sweet or there was just too much filling compared to pastry but I ended up chucking a portion of the dough with a large amount of filling because I felt like I was getting diabetes.\n\nBacon-Bleu Cheese Pastry\nPROS: \n- super light and not oily pastry\n- not overly heavy\n- not overly flavorful: nice balance between the cheese and bacon and I believe there were onion bits in there\n- great savory bite, not overly filling but not too light\nCONS:\n- none.  This actually was the one saving grace because the cruffin was a big disappointment.\n\nI might have just gotten a bad flavored cruffin.  Perhaps the other flavors are better.

It's called, \"Mr Holmes Bakehouse.\" Mr Holmes can be a fictional \"Sherlock,\" but he was quite an impressive baker right in my imaginary dream! In real life, Mr Holmes Bakehouse serves the customers of all ages to taste their incredible and devouring baked goods every 365 days a year! The atmosphere is very active and on-going as I welcomed there. The concept is very modern, contemporary and chic inside filled with basic decors along with an interior neon sign across the whole small compact room!\n\nThe employees especially the bakers are doing an excellent job for making the customers like me an outstanding service! No cons!\n\nNow onto the treats! When I arrived in San Francisco (coming from Sacramento) at 8:30 am PST on 2/24/2018 and parked at the nearby surface metered street parking, I got in line early before extra people were coming by. Why the line? Oh yes because they were eagerly awaited for the most signature item of all, the cruffins! Cruffin is a muffin in a croissant twist with a touch of seasonal flavors & sprinkled sugars combined right out in the oven. Boy, it was so fresh and clean after it popped out from the oven since 9 am, so I grabbed and ordered two Cruffins (today's arrival: the Custard filling with a white chocolate bark on top) and a Matcha Croissant. As I ate it, these eatable tasted flawless and unbelievably sweet tooth tasty! The cruffins did baked perfectly and eatable to chew which I did feel the sugary taste along with the custard filling too. The Matcha Croissant on the other hand also tasted great! Perfectly baked and flaky especially the half dipped matcha filling too. What a magnificent pastries grub just in time for breakfast!\n\nParking at Mr Holmes Bakehouse is very challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface metered street parking nor the parking garage if it's available. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nAll in all, Mr Holmes Bakehouse is the most incredible and amazing bakery that I've ever discovered and visited for the first time! Yes it will get packed before it opens, so get there early for the anticipation hype of all! Perfect for all ages from young to old! A well received!

On day 1, the kouign amman was excellent, 6/5 stars and one of the best kouign ammans I have ever had. The following day, it was dry, under-baked, and bland - a completely different pastry. On day 1, the donut was dry and under-filled. The following day, it was packed with delicious filling.\n\nThis isn't isolated to this location.

Bakeries on every corner baking up sourdough San Francisco treats. Sadly, this is not the case. I used Yelp to make an educated decision on what's baking.\n\nWalking into the store, it's very small. There's a few crazy items for sale and one of them leapt out with black sesame seeds, the California Croissant. \n\nThere are so many yummy baked goods to choose from! I asked, what is a California Croissant? The young man explains inside is seaweed, salmon, ginger and a touch of wasabi. Mmm, sounds funky! (My wife makes a face) \n\nI'm down for funk, let's go! \n\nIt's exactly how it was described, you take a bite into the flaky croissant. You also bite the seaweed and salmon.

I have been here on numerous occasions and tried an assortment of things and this bakery is just not at the top of my list (and I have been to a ton of bakeries!).  There were a couple of cruffin flavors that did I enjoy (believe it was a strawberry cream one) but overall it is just hype and looks good on the gram.  I will say they do a good job on the custard because I do like their doughnuts and I did like a white chocolate blueberry brioche bomb they use to do.  \n\nCroissants were nothing special, was not the flaky (Vive la Tarte has way better ones!).   The idea of a churro croissant filled with dulce de leche custard sounded amazing but the execution of it was disappointing.  FYI the matcha croissant everyone posts about, not filled.  I am all about the filling.  I tried the apple monkey bread and it did not have as much flavor as a I wanted it to be.

We found street parking nearby, and waited about 15 minutes for cruffins when we arrived a little after 9. Initially we were going to buy 5 pastries, but added another so we could get a box for them. None of the flavors were super strong, so if you don't like overly sweet pastries, this is a place to try. The textures of the pastries were healthy-ish, and didn't have as much butter as most other pastries I've had. I was disappointed because I was hoping for some stronger flavors (not necessarily sweeter).\n\nWe got 2 cruffins (flavor of the day: carrot cake), 1 matcha croissant, 1 strawberry elderberry croissant, 1 lemon ricotta donut, and 1 chocolate earl grey donut. Here is my review of them:\n\nCruffins: The texture was like a cross between a croissant and a cinnamon roll. There is carrot cake flavored filling injected inside the cruffin with a slightly smokey cream cheese frosting on top. Maybe it was the carrot cake flavor, but I wasn't super impressed.\n\nMatcha croissant: My bf thinks this is overrated; he was hoping for matcha filling in addition to the half dipped matcha shell. I thought it was well balanced, kind of like a pocky shell over the croissant. I wished the croissant was more buttery though. \n\nLemon ricotta donut: I wished the filling had a stronger lemon flavor and the dough had a more fried texture. This tasted more dough-y.\n\nChocolate earl grey donut: The filling tasted more creamy than chocolate-y, with a bitter taste finish that resembles the tea. To my disappointment, I couldn't really taste either a bold chocolate or tea flavor.\n\nStrawberry elderberry croissant: This was surprisingly enjoyable, despite the unconventional filling style where strawberry filling was injected on one end and creamy elderberry filling on the other end.

They had unique flavors at the time I visited with passion fruit, matcha, and others. Each baked good I bought (cupcakes, cruffin) were definitely pretty tasty (the price does reflect what you get). Overall, on the sweeter side that I am used to, but the bakes were great and my coworkers agreed. \n\nSERVICE: Great! \n\nOverall, Mr. Holmes is a place that I would find myself again if I was in the area, but I would be much pickier for the baked goods I'd get. I would also not opt to wait in those crazy lines I've seen before, but luckily, I hoped in on a Friday morning at 9:30 AM, so I didn't find myself behind a bunch of tourists.", "author": "Albert H."}

I was able to get here in time to get those cruffins.\n\nSo it was my first time here, but I was lucky enough to be able to purchase a cruffin. I went on a Tuesday and around a little over 10 am. Surprisingly there were quite a few cruffins left, so I was relieved. There was no line, but there were still lots of people. \n\nThe cruffin flavor of the day was Mascarpone Peach, which sounded AMAZING. Also for the donuts, they had Peanut Butter Caramel, Lemon, and Vanilla. I got a Cruffin, Vanilla Donut, Matcha Croissant, Churro Croissant, California Croissant, and a Roasted Tomato Croissant. I got exactly 6 in order to take home these pastries in their beautiful box. \n\nI have got to tell you, the Mascarpone Peach Cruffin was the best thing ever. LOVED the filling and the crispy outer part of the cruffin. The Churro Croissant also has a filling, not sure if it is vanilla or not, but the whole thing definitely tasted similar to a churro, delicious. For savory, I liked the Roasted Tomato Croissant, it was just the perfect savory croissant for me. The Matcha Croissant and California was a so-so for me. I thought the Matcha Croissant would have a matcha filling, but it didn't, so I was kind of disappointed by that. The California Croissant is a hit or miss, my mom loved it, but for me it was a miss. Not much of a wasabi and ginger person.\n\nThey are all priced in the $4-4.50 area, the cruffins are $4.50. Pretty pricey, but worth it.\n\nFirst time trying cruffins and glad I was able to stop by and try Mr Holmes Bakehouse pastries. Definitely want to come back, definitely recommend!!!", "author": "Rachel L."}

My delay has been due to their use of pastry cream for their signature pastry, the cruffin. I'm not really a pastry cream kind of guy. In any case, I made my way to Mr. Homes last week. There was a line, but it moved rather quickly. I bought a cruffin, a kouign amann, and a cookie.\n\nFor me, the cookie and kouign amann weren't that interesting. The cruffin was interesting. I wasn't that enthusiastic about the pastry cream, but the morning bun itself, which is what the cruffin is less the cream, was quite good. That I really enjoyed. In fact  I was thinking they could sell the morning bun on its own without any filling. I think it would go over well. I also need to mention there wasn't the tiniest lump to be had in the pastry cream. It was smooth as silk.\n\nNow, even though I'm not much of a fan of pastry cream, I do like lemon curd and the folks at Mr. Holmes rotate the flavors for the cruffin. So I'll check in with them, and when they have a lemon flavored cream, I'll be back.", "author": "Anthony W."}

The cruffin of the day (#COTD?) was pear & elderflower and it was sooo good. The filling consistency reminded me of applesauce (in a good way) and the pear really stuck out.....mainly because I have no idea what an elderflower is supposed to taste like.\n\nThe other pastries we tried included the creme-filled donuts & the churro croissant, which is ALSO creme-filled, which was a nice surprise. Both were quite good, but we agreed that the cruffin was definitely the star of the show for us.\n\nMy one gripe is that I wish the shop was bigger, but I guess you could say that about any place in SF! 4 stars, I would totally come back if I was in the area and craving a fluffy, crispy treat.", "author": "Stephanie C."}

I arrived at 8:50am on a Thursday and found street parking very easily. At 8:50 I was about #10 in line. If you're not buying Cruffins, you can just walk into the store and skip the line. Cruffins start selling at 9am sharp! At 9am the line actually moves quite fast and by 9:05 I was out with my Cruffin! (and made it to work before 9:30) I saw they make a few trays, a pretty rough estimation would be 100-200 Cruffins total at least. Cruffins are $4.50 each.\n\nThe Cruffins are really fantastic. It really feels like a muffin-shaped croissant, the outside is perfectly crisp without being dry and the inside is moist. It is filled with a pastry cream, which flavor changes every day. It is just right, thick and not too sweet. The Cruffin is really great, surprising and I'd say even exceeds its hype.\n\nMr Holmes' Bakehouse also has a bunch of other bakeries, I spotted a matcha-dipped croissant, a smoked salmon savory croissant, monkey bread, donuts and much more that I will definitely try next time!\n\nAlso, they sell Cruffin lapel pins at the register for $9.", "author": "Thomas L."}

I was not impressed with Mr. Holmes Bakehouse.\n\nThis bakery has been on my to do list for the long time, especially since they are only open 7am-2:30pm, and I work 9-5... leaving pretty much no time ever to visit. And there's no way I would sacrifice my weekend sleep for a line for pastries.\n\nI decided to take a day off of work and explore parts of SF and try all the things that are only open in the day time. One of them was Mr. Holmes Bakehouse and it was honestly disappointing.\n\nI'm glad there was no line so at least I didn't waste any time. I had the following:\n\n1. The cruffin - it was beer and oats flavored. I loved how the cream had a hint of beer flavor but overall this baked good was WAY too sweet. It was also very difficult and messy to eat. I am glad my friend and I snagged the only standing table inside, or else it would've been impossible to eat. Be prepared for grabbing multiple napkins and dripping the cream onto the floor. Oops. I ended up tossing half of it because it was just too sweet and too much. I think it would've been fine with a dallop of cream on top, and omitting the cream inside.\n\n2. Matcha croissant - this was probably my favorite one out of the 3 things I bought. It is slightly too sweet; the matcha reminds me of a matcha Kit Kat. I think it would've been better if the matcha could be powdered form.\n\n3. Churro croissant - reminds me of a sugar donut... it was okay. But what's worse is it is CREAM FILLED!! Whaaat. Why don't they list that?! Terrible surprise. Tossed half of this too.\n\nOverall, all the items were too sweet to eat the whole thing. I also wish they let customers know that the items were cream filled (yuck!!). I definitely wasted too much money because I bought 2 of the cruffins thinking it wasn't cream filled :(\n\nWhat's worse is that they charge 87 cents for a box. I'm spending over $20 for 4 items and they're so petty to charge 87 cents! You need to purchase a minimum of 6 items for a free box.... and so I decided to pay 87 cents so I didn't have to carry 4 bags of pastries. Unfortunately, the cream filled cruffin exploded in the box too. sad. \n\nAnd WORST of all... the neon light that read \"I got baked in San Francisco\" was broken!! Man!! So much for the 'gram.\n\nI will not come back. Only delightful part of the experience was the Inteligentsia coffee. I am so glad I did not wait in a long line for this experience.", "author": "Janet H."}

They have a great concept going, a cool vibe and unique pastries. \n\nThere's a couple outside factors aside from the actual product that kind of bummed me out. The location, it is in the rough part of the city so it's not like you can just walk around and make your way over to the bakery. The parking in this area isn't great. Also, the shop is so small, it's hard to be on line, deal with the girls taking photos, and the line for photos.

Their donuts are light and perfectly crisp, usually with a custard/cream filling that's not too sweet. Their chocolate chip cookie was very good. I've had one bite of the cruffin, and although it wasn't big enough for me to recommend it, the pastry seemed well made. Their design game is cute -- they did a good job decorating the tiny storefront, and all their packaging is very aesthetically pleasing. \n\nThe Bad:\nIn general, I don't think this bakery provides a good customer experience. It's very small -- there's no space to eat, and most people just grab and go. It's in a sketchy neighborhood, so there's not really anywhere to sit near by and enjoy your pastry. \n\nIt's also hard to see the full pastry selection as there's usually a line and I often feel rushed/unable to explore options. They don't do a good job of stocking the pastry shelves -- if you're here after 10am on a weekend, they usually don't have much left. To make matters worse, they don't really have a menu online or above the goods to make selection easier. \n\nThe biggest offender is the cruffin though; they only release it at 9AM everyday, despite opening at 7am. I think this is a way to generate demand/keep up appearances. It's hard for people with 9 to 5 jobs to purchase one, and the weekends are too crazy. I interpret it as a shitty PR move by an already popular bakery -- why not just have a constant batch of all your baked goods and keep your shelves stocked? You obviously have enough demand for it.", "author": "Michelle L."}

I'm very happy I read reviews, because I wouldn't have known that their infamous cruffins don't come out the oven until 9am. I also read on reviews that the line is insanely long, especially on the weekends. So I decided to arrive twenty minutes early to ensure a spot in line (this was a Wednesday). When I arrived, there were only 2 groups of people ahead of me (so much for being early). So, I waited patiently for the cruffins to arrive. \n\nExactly at 9am, cruffins came out of the back of the store and right onto the counter. Since I wanted to get a nice decorative box, I knew I had to order at least 6 bakery items. So, I ordered two cruffins (Neapolitan), 2 donuts (Nutella) and 2 croissants (Churro). I must say, I was actually disappointed in the cruffin. While the bread portion was good, I wasn't too keen on the filling. The chocolate was overpowering and took away from the other flavors and it was also kind of bitter. I also tried a croissant, which was absolutely amazing and something I wish I could eat every single day. Unfortunately, I'm not a huge sweets person, so I was unable to take down a donut, but it looked delicious. \n\nI don't know if I would come back for a cruffin again, it all depends on the filling, but please sign me up for the croissant, any day!", "author": "Victoria T."}

SO GOOD! Won't really get heartbroken if I show up here and they're all out of the cruffins as long as they have any of those three left. \n\nThe lady at this location also suggested we try the California croissant - croissant filled with smoked salmon, seaweed (nori), wasabi, and ginger. Strikes me odd when they gave us a soy sauce packet to go along with the croissant. You're supposed to eat it with the soy sauce - hand wrap sushi style. I didn't have the gutsy taste buds to give this one a try but my sushi snob brother did and he enjoyed it. So if your palette is into that kind of stuff - TRY IT! I heard it's good.

I really love the design, so classy and chic. A white, solid, cardboard box with gold foil lettering - give me three of them! The minimum order is 6 pastries to get them packed into a box and on average, each pastry is ~$4.00.\n\nSince it was my first visit and probably a long while before visiting again, I chose to order \"2 of each\" from the display case and a couple of coffees. As soon as we exited, those box flaps flung open and we went to town on the matcha croissant, mushroom danish, grapefruit danish, and chocolate filled donut.

Follow @mrholmesbakehouse on Instagram for updated cruffin and donut flavors. If I ever came back, I'd skip the cruffin line and go for their other pastries.\n\nCream/jelly filled donuts ($3.50) weren't remarkable but the cream filling is good. Same cream as the cruffin.\n\nThey have fancy croissants ($4). I tried the churro and elderberry strawberry ones. I have no idea what an elderberry is so I was surprised when the cream was more tart than sweet. I liked the churro filling which tasted like custard. Overall I'd rather just get a plain croissant, where you can actually taste the buttery flakey texture.\n\nIn the end, I'm still a cookie lover at heart. Their toffee cornflake cookie ($3) was surprisingly my favorite! Basically cornflakes cereal in cookie form. Thin and chewy but still had crispy edges!

I've seen photos of the pastries that this place serves and good god it looks delicious and seriously the best type of pastries one can find in the city. I'm not usually a sweets person or a pastries person, but this place can seriously make you change your mind. \n\nSince this place is so good there can be a line so expect to wait, but seriously it is worth the wait. This place doesn't have a lot of seating so don't really expect to be able to sit down here and dine. Despite having lots of pastries there is not a lot of seating- around 4-5 seats inside. Since this is located in the city, expect either to do street parking or garage parking. Parking can be difficult to find so you might have to uber there or walk if you want. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ended up getting a box filled with pastries, who wouldn't?! We ended up getting a Cruffin, a Strawberry cream donut, Thai tea donut, Raspberry jelly filled croissant, Matcha croissant, and a Matcha cream donut. All these pastries were so delicious especially the Cruffin. This Cruffin had two jellies inside tasting like raspberry and possibly an orange flavor. The downfall is that this place only allows 2 Cruffins per customer and the Cruffins are released at 9:00 am while other pastries are released at around 8:00 am. This makes sense though because the Cruffins are delicious and are usually sold out pretty quickly at this place. Overall, the pastries at this place is so delicious and are cooked to perfection. But if you want to try the Cruffins I highly suggest that you come early because they sell quickly. \n\nDespite the pastries being a little bit pricey, it is worth both the price and the wait.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-21", "description": "After hearing so many things about Mr. Homes' infamous cruffins, we finally were able to try them out for ourselves at the original location. I scoured the reviews on Yelp the day before we decided to try, and most people recommended getting there half an hour before the cruffins go on sale at 9 AM to guarantee a cruffin. Sadly we're not morning people, so we got there around 9:15 AM on a weekday. The line was already out the door, but we kept our fingers crossed in the hopes that we would still get a cruffin. So people mentioned that they give you a sticker to guarantee you getting a cruffin that day, and they also mentioned that there were two lines - one for cruffins, one for regular baked goods. Both weren't true the day I went: just 1 single line with no stickers. We just had to wait and see. \n\nIf you want their popular Mr. Homes Bakehouse box, you'll have to buy 6 or more pastries. That's pretty tricky of them, but the boxes are actually really sturdy and well-made. Just make sure your pastries don't tilt or get smushed in the box cause it'll make for oil stains. \n\nWhen we got to the front of the line, there were only about 15 cruffins or so left. The flavor of the day that day was Fruity Pebbles - probably not the flavor I would have wanted if I had known ahead of time to check their Instagram. It wasn't bad; I could really taste the Fruity Pebbles in the filling, and the outside of the cruffin was crispy and cinnamon-y while the inside was soft and flaky. Best eaten warm! Once it got cold, it was no longer good. Sadly, the worker who was placing the cruffins in our box accidentally tilted one, so it ended up making a mess. $4.5 per cruffin \n\nChocolate croissant: $4 - I expected a croissant that was flaky and crispy and oozing out chocolate upon biting inside. Instead, I got a dry and stale croissant with tiny bits of chocolate pieces inside. Not special at all and definitely not worth the $4. \n\nChurro croissant: $4 - consists of sugar and Dulce de leche cream. This was amazing! Apparently there was a Dulce de leche cream filling inside of the croissant that I had not been aware of, making it a tad bit sweet, but still so good. The cinnamon on the outside of the croissant definitely made me savor every bite. Flaky and crispy - this made up for the poor chocolate croissant. \n\nDonuts: $3.5 - I think the donuts were a blood orange and a pistachio cream - we ended up going with the pistachio cream. Nothing too special. After eating all the cinnamon-y desserts, the flavors started to blend together. Not a big fan of the filling, but the donut itself was pretty tasty. Probably wouldn't order this again. \n\nApple fruit Danish - $4 I was tempted to order a savory Danish, but at the end, I went for the apple crumble Danish (if I remember correctly). I remember it was one of the best things in that box. Lots of flavor in the filling, not too sweet, but the crumbles and the way the fruit was cooked was a perfect complement to the slightly savory Danish itself. I would order this again - it was good (but not as good as Renaud's) and definitely one of my favorites. \n\nOrdering is similar to Bottega Louie where you point and fill up your box or bag and pay at the cashier. The storefront is pretty tiny; the outside is unassuming if it's all closed up - it's once you walk inside that you see the bakery in all its goodness. You see all the people taking photos under the \"I Got Baked\" sign, but you might have to wait a few minutes before you can get your photo; and it's also awkward having other people watch you while you try to get that perfect shot. But no shame, that's why you're visiting Mr. Holmes anyway right? \n\ntl;dr - Ended up waiting in line for around 30 minutes, trying to take pictures for another 15 minutes before eating our box of goodies in the car and at a park. I'd get the Danish and the churro croissant again, but no longer need the box since I had to toss it out anyway. I can see why this place is so popular and I'm glad I got to visit the original location, but now that I've tried it, I don't think I am eager to revisit anytime soon, unless they have a cruffin of the day that I really want to try - especially since I can go to the location in LA now. They accept credit cards - prices aren't the cheapest and they do add up. Make sure you check their IG before you visit the store!", "author": "Tiffany C."}

People start lining up as early as 7am locals say and the store will be sold out by noon. After that, game over. Store is closed. On my 3rd try got there 10am and sure enough there was a line up on a sat morning. \n\nI went with a box of 6 and the he most unique of all was the california crossaint. When i asked why the name?

The rest were  choco and nuttela crossaint, bear claw and churro crossaint...\n\nCouldnt wait to get home so i ordered a coffee and immediately had a bite of the cali crossaint and my oh my...it was classic cali.in my mouth. Smoked salmon was fresh and the seaweed provided a good salty touch to the salmon. The ginger inside wasnt that punget and never affected the flavour but provided a good compliment to the filling. \n\nThe pastries all.looked succelulent and good.

People compare the two a lot and while Tartine--which is probably the best bakery in America--is better, the comparison itself is unfair since this place is doing its own completely badass and strange thing.\n\nCase in point: The California. Honestly, this is one of the best pastries I have ever had in my life and probably the very best savory pastry I have had period. It is like a smoked salmon sushi roll inside of buttery croissant topped with sesame seeds. It was just exceptional, and daring, and really satisfying.\n\nThe cruffin was solid, but I definitely preferred the donuts and croissant-type items. Really good bread pudding, amazing chocolate croissants, siiiiiick white chocolate raspberry cream filled donut. I agree this place is pretty heavy on the hipster/instagram-ready feel, but I wouldn't let that deter you. It is good, one of SF's extremely solid new bakeries and, besides, if you don't like anything at least they serve Intelligentsia coffee.", "author": "Paul A."}

We got really lucky that we arrived around 11 AM on a Saturday thinking that they probably all sold out. But they had a whole tray filled and we must have caught them on a slower weekend morning. Either way I was ecstatic! We also had the green tea croissant and the churro croissant. I think hands down the cruffin was my favorite and definitely something I would come back for! The cruffin was filled with chocolate goodness that was the right amount of sweet and richness. The outside was the many layers of croissant flakiness and crispy parts of the dough was just delicious. The green tea croissant looked too beautiful to eat, but I found the green tea part to not be as strong and I wished I had a little more of that flavor come out. The churro croissant was a nice touch and it did remind me of churros. But, it was filled with dulce de leche filling and it was a nice addition. This tiny shop on the street is definitely worth checking out and this is the place to go in San Francisco to get baked!", "author": "Christine N."}

That 9am rule makes the Cruffin an elite pastry only for medical device sales people, realtors, tourists, financial wholesalers, and others who aren't working or in general don't work very hard.

What did I want? \n\nTo watch the sun rise with my family while sipping coffee and eating a cruffin by a large body of water in my hometown, the city of my birth, San Francisco.\n\nI was willing to stand in line for this birthday wish. I know - try not to black out. \n\nMy family and I rolled up, parked right in front, and fell in line at 7:05 AM. There was a line. Said line moved quickly. \n\nOnce inside the bright clean bakery with music bumping made me feel less sleepy. My daughters took advantage of the \"aesthetic af\" selfie staging area with neon that screams \"I got baked in San Francisco\" (their slogan) \n\nI pretty much decided every single baked good behind that glass was to be mine. It's my birthday! \n\nI pointed at everything I wanted, ordered coffee, and picked up some pins to remember this day. \n\nWe raced to the Pier to watch the sun rise. My daughters and son in law shared their favorite story about me while we ate. It was so sweet. \n\nWe enjoyed: \nstrawberry vanilla donut\ngingerbread donut\nstrawberry jalape\u00f1o croissant\nchurro croissant\nsea salt chocolate chunk cookies\nchocolate monkey bread \nchickpea curry croissant (the only dud for us)\nbacon onion and cheese croissant \napple rum croissant \npersimmon croissant \n\nEverything was delicious and the technical merit behind each individual pastry really shines. \n\nImagine focusing your passion for the culinary arts on one thing: every variant of the initially tricky but so well worth it croissant dough. That is what this bakery is to me. Hyper focused perfection. \n\nIf you've never made croissants at home,  I invite you to. In this, you will have full working knowledge of what you are eating. No really, pick an entire day to bang out 24 croissants. You'll never forget it. \n\nI applaud the bakers mastery. The business itself is really great with friendly professionals. \n\nJUST TAKE MY MONEY!!!! \n\nWait!! I came for cruffins but saw none behind the glass and now I wonder if I was supposed to ask for it? Wow ok. That's a fail for me. Back to my review. \n\nPS - my receipt says \"Boycott Yelp\" but well, so here I am, a seasoned Elite Yelper giving you my high praise. I hope that mess gets worked out. \n\nI love Yelp and I love Mr Holmes Bakeshop. I hate it when mommy and daddy fight! \n\nThank you to everyone on deck today for your part in making my 45th Birthday morning with my family a memorable one.\n\nTake a bow, 5 stars for perfection!", "author": "Jennifer C P."}

Since I already tried the cruffins I came back here to try their Intelligista coffee + try new pastries. As usual, the lines were out the door, but service is friendly as always. \n\n- Coffee- for $2.5 a cup it pairs great with the baked goods. As a medium roast it's pretty light and not as strong so if you're craving coffee to wake you up I'd recommend going somewhere else. \n\n- Chocolate earl grey donuts- yummm. The filling is a great mix between the savory chocolate flavor and light tea flavor of the earl grey. Definitely one of the lighter donut flavors I've had and it's a new fave. \n\n- Cornflake/toffee cookie - GET THIS. Anything toffee is usually not a letdown for me and this was another case. The stickiness of the toffee mixed in with the crunchy corn flakes and chewy cookie dough was heaven in my mouth. \n\n- Chocolate/sea salt cookie - classic. Can't really go wrong with this one.

Her customer service is exceptional and stated today that she is glad I come in to order from Mr. Holmes. The two times I have gone, there were different pastries offered, which is always a plus because it gives me and my office a variety of tasty treats in the morning. Natalia is always willing to answer any questions and make sure that my selection is just right (with taste, quality, and quantity.) \n\nIn general, I have not ever had to wait in a line, if anything 2 people the most, but I have heard that the regular line can be long so be aware. For their Cruffins, although I have never had one, be sure to get in line early before 8:45am.

Luckily, we were toward the front and once 9AM strikes the line steadily moved.\n\nNot sure if I'd made it back for a while, I definitely got caught up in over-ordering..\n\nChocolate Passion Fruit Cruffin ($4.50): worth the wait, lived up to the hype. MUST eat within a few hours of ordering. I ate half in the morning and half in the evening; the texture of the pastry was dry later in the day. Recommend checking their Instagram account for weekly updates on cruffin and special donut flavors. \n\nHot Toddy Donut ($3.50): was described as a whiskey, lemon, and honey flavored filling, but all of those flavors were very faint, the whiskey in particular. good for a donut, but wished the filling was more pronounced. Again, eat the donuts within a few hours of purchase.\n\nWhite Chocolate Raspberry Donut ($3.50): good raspberry flavor.\n\nSea Salt Chocolate Chip Cookie ($3): great chocolate chip cookie, and massive. It's crumbly on the outside and chewy on the inside. Someone likened it to Jacques Torres' cookie in NYC, which I would agree to an extent, but I think this is better and thicker.\n\nChurro Croissant ($4): filled with a vanilla bean + some other flavor pastry cream and dusted with cinnamon on sugar on the outside. good, but wouldn't order again.\n\nMonkey Bread ($4.50): incredibly sweet, and smaller than I imagined, but that's good in this case. I didn't eat it fresh, but it was good in small doses.\n\nSome other notes:\n- There are two lines: one for cruffins (they come out at 9AM every morning, limit two per person) along the building to the right of the door if facing the store, and one for the other non-cruffin pastries that goes straight out the door. If you're in the cruffin line, you may still order the other pastries when your turn is up.\n- If you want a box for your pastries, you must purchase a minimum of six goodies (can include your later cruffin purchase) or buy for ~$1.50.\n- They post one daily donut flavor on Instagram, but they also offer two other flavors. Just ask what they are when you get there, even if they look like they're all sold out. They have sheet pans of pastries they use to restock the display case until they're completely out.\n\nCruffin was hands down the best pastry.

Monkey Bread - 1/5 - Way too salty and sweet at the same time. Kind of made me nauseous. I would skip this because we threw it away. \n3. Churro Croissant - 5/5 - These are always so good no matter which location you go to. The cinnamon on top of the flaky Croissant make it above the rest.

We got there at around 9:40am in line for about 20 minutes. I was expecting a longer wait. The day I went, they had chestnut cream filling, perfect for the holidays! I also tried their savory and sweet danishes. You get a box if you order half a dozen of pastries. I thought all of the pastries were delicious. The cruffin isn't too sweet and it is very delicious. I can understand how this is a successful creation! When I took a first bite, I was glad I waited in that line. The other pastries are delicious as well. They aren't too oily or flaky as some croissants could be. \n\nThe one thing I wish could improve is that I thought the servers were not that helpful. They did not give any recommendations or suggestions. They kind of just looked at us and waited for us to place the order, and we felt a little rushed. They also grabbed a box and assumed that we were going to get a bunch of pastries.

Luckily this forced us to try all their delectable items. For me, the most notable items on their menu has to be their flaky, croissant inspired goods. By far, the flakiness of their savory rolls (filled with assortment of toppings like bacon, cheese, gorgonzola cheese, mushrooms, etc.) sweet croissants, and cruffins (croissant muffins filled with different creams that change every day) is unmatched. It literally is perfection in every bite. \n\nThe only problem I have with this place is that it is NOT BIG ENOUGH and RUNS OUT SO FAST.

That makes 3 donuts in one day and the fourth for breakfast.

It was as if the person before me knew I was borderline an explosive bladder. I ran in, did my thing, and happily chose out my pastries. The only unlucky part was that they ran out of cruffins. I was told to come before 10am if I wanted cruffins. Oh well, I'll just have to come back next time. Oh, and also, their famous sign was broken. I still striked a photo with it though!\n\nI got 2 of each donut, chocolate pistachio, blueberry and lemon and 2 California Croissants. The California Croissant was the first one I chowed down because I hadn't had lunch yet. It has seaweed, salmon, ginger and a hint of wasabi!! Definitely something I've never had before. Not bad. The donuts were the winner though. Every flavor was a hit. They've got their proportions down, too. Not too much filling and not too sweet.

We went on a weekday morning (9:30ish), so the line wasn't bad at all..probably less than 5 minutes? And we were able to find a parking spot right in front of the bakery. \n\nWe were overwhelmed by all the goods, and planned on splitting a few. Of course, Mr. Holmes, being well known for their famous cruffin, was def on our to-eat list. Their menu on the website is not updated, so was unfortunately misled by the flavor. I thought they were making Chocolate Rye cream, but since it wasn't updated, it was actually Thai Tea flavor. Nonetheless, we still wanted to try the cruffin and ordered that along with the bread pudding and a savory root vegetable danish. The root vegetable danish was okay..nothing exceptional about and would have been nice if it was warmed. My favorite was actually the bread pudding, which had charred lemon and cocoa nib in it. I honestly wasn't super impressed by the cruffin. The croissant portion was def a nice flakiness, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the thai tea flavor. And maybe enjoying the top of a muffin more than the bottom of the muffin made me not enjoy the cruffin as much. In my opinion, the cronut sounds like a tastier option. But the plus side was that there was plenty of thai tea cream in the cruffin. \n\nA plus is that they have intelligentsia coffee, which made the perfect combo with the pastries.

And I say *first* stop because if you wait too long, you run risk of them selling out of your favorite treats! Mr. Holmes is very popular on social media for their elusive cruffins (the lovechild between a croissant and a muffin). Cruffins are $4.50 and there is a limit of 2 per customer. They come out at 9 am, and may sell out quickly depending on the day. Cruffins and donuts rotate flavors throughout the week. All the other pastries rotate flavors throughout the quarter (all flavor updates can be found on their instagram). My first trip to Mr. Holmes was a bit of a bust, as I came in past 12 on a weekend. The bakery closes at 2:30 every day, so there was a shortage of many pastries already. The cruffins were long gone, but I was able to pick up a donut and a savory danish. Today (a Thursday), I made it in just before 11 and was greeted with a pretty well stocked display case. I was able to get one cruffin and one of each of the day's donut flavors. My boyfriend got a savory danish. Everything I've gotten from Mr. Holmes has been delicious. The pastries are flaky, the creative fillings always work, and the pics are always instagram worthy. That being said, there is definitely a hype to the bakery that some people may not think is deserved. There are plenty of other great bakeries in SF if you don't find yourself in the Mr. Holmes neighborhood. \n\nThe area isn't the nicest of SF neighborhoods. Those coming from outside of the city might not feel comfortable wandering through the streets to find the little bakery. Street parking runs about $2.25/hour in this area, so I would park in front of a nearby busy store and put in enough for about 30 minutes. It's plenty of time to walk up the street to grab your goodies (unless you're coming during a weekend rush hour).", "author": "Rachel A."}

On a recent weekend, I decided to brave the queue and see what all the fuss was about.\n\nI got there around 9:30 AM on a Saturday, and given the length of the line, I was worried that I would get to the front and all the cruffins would be sold out.  Luckily, I was able to get my hands on one, and overall, I thought it was excellent.  The flaky croissant dough held a raspberry and pistachio cream (the flavors change regularly), and I liked how the mixture of cream flavors gave it a tart and sweet contrast.  Did it blow my mind? No, but I'm happy I can cross the cruffin off of my baked good bucket list.\n\nI also tried their churro croissant, which came with a dulce de leche filling; while I liked it, I was expecting more of a caramel note to the filling, and the crream seemed more vanilla-like to me. \n During a subsequent visit, I tried a raspberry hibiscus kouign-amann and a matcha dipped croissant, and while I thought both were good, I feel like I've had better kouign-amanns and croissants at other local bakeries.

(Cue angel choir: \"Hallelujah!\") They begin selling these at 9am, run out within a few hours, and limit 2-per customer. Because I went on a deserted weekday morning and gave them a big ol' smile, they let me buy 4. Tee hee. Major points to them for being friendly and adaptable business folks! Think opposite of the Soup Nazi character from Seinfeld.\n\n****TIP#2:**** Utilize their social media accounts to plan your visit accordingly. They offer 1 flavor of cruffin daily, and list them on Instagram. If you're not into the ingredients for the day (pumpkin/lime/strawberry/hazelnut, etc), you'd be better off visiting when they have your flavor! \n\nUse the following link to view their flavor, accompanied by some ridiculously sassy Instagram captions: https://www.instagram.com/mrholmesbakehouse/ \n\n****TIP#3:**** Pick up a couple boxes for your officemates/team/angry estranged friend that you need to make amends with, and they will instantly love you, irrespective of what else is going on in your life.

The cronut was so flavorful, and the pastry was flakey and to die for. It was heaven!\n\nThe matcha croissant was also delicious; buttery, sweet, and crunchy. \n\nThe donuts has very unusual flavoring; we had chocolate passion filling and it was a very very strong and unexpected passion flavor.

I am on Thanksgiving break and woke up *even earlier* than I normally would for a workday to get to this bakery around 8:30AM on a Wednesday morning. Ended up 2nd in line to get my hands on the cruffin of the day (birthday cake for their anniversary!). You can check out the week's upcoming cruffin flavors on their Instagram page.\n\nThe CRUFFIN is light and flaky, with a good mixture of sugar and cinnamon dusted on the outside. The exterior has a light crunch with a fluffy interior. For the birthday cake flavor, the inside was filled with a subtle and creamy vanilla custard that was mixed with some colorful sprinkles, and topped with a piece of  small birthday blonde brownie. I was pleasantly surprised that this dessert wasn't overly sweet or rich. I would eat again! \n\nI also grabbed a STRAWBERRY JALAPENO BEARCLAW and loved the combo of sweet and spicy cream cheese on the inside. I would drizzle that sauce over all my pastries!\n\n For something savory, I got the HAM & CHEESE CROISSANT and ate that later at home. The croissant was amazing after heating it up at 375F for a few minutes. The thyme and pepper provided a nice savory flavor throughout the croissant and the gruyere and ham melted together perfectly. For this specific croissant, I will always get it to go so I can heat it up later.\n\nMy friend liked the CHURRO CROISSANT and enjoyed the generous cinnamon and sugar on the outside. She also liked the ORANGE TANG DONUT and that it tasted like a legit french beignet with a subtle and creamy orange curd inside.\n\nService was very fast and all the workers were happy to explain the flavors to us. \n\nOverall, my inner Yelper was pretty impressed with this bakery. I would come back the next time I'm in the area, maybe before going to an event at the Asian Art Museum or the orchestra. It's worth the 16min walk from Civic BART station (not too bad, especially in morning time).", "author": "Bonnie Z."}

I needed 4 caramel praline cruffins, but I didn't know that there was a limit of 2 per person. I was disappointed and must have looked really sad because the lady behind the counter was nice enough to give me the amount I wanted anyway. Yay! \n\nI didn't eat one until I was back home, so I had to reheat it. I thought the filling was going to be sweet, but it was sooo delicious and creamy.

They have two lines; one line for their regular baked goods and another for cruffins ONLY. If you time it right and have enough players, you can play it right.\n\nIn the regular line: You can get their pastries of the day in that particular flavor(s). They have a variety of sweet & savory goods. I tried a bite of their peanut butter & cocoa nib donut & their savory croissant of the day when I was in line. I got a box of goods for my family that included a churro croissant, strawberry filled donut, monkey bread, and strawberry jalapeno bear claw.\n\nIn the cruffin line: People seem to wait here fairly early to get a head start on the cruffin line. By the time it's moving, the line was around the block! Each person gets a sticker for two cruffins each (hack: bring a baby and they can help get two more cruffins as we saw the people in front of us had) and there's only one flavor. When I came they had a cherry cordial flavor with cocoa nib. I actually liked it! But these pastries are heavy for 4.50 a pop and I couldn't eat it in one sitting.\n\nOverall, it's worth trying at least once.

I came here multiple times just to try to get my hands on their renowned cruffins, but my first time there, I found out that, although they open at 8am, they don't bring out the cruffins until 9am. Unfortunately, I had to get back to work and could not wait till 9 - attempt #1 failed. The next 2 times, I went around lunch time to find that they were all sold out already - attempts #2 and 3 failed. Finally, I stopped by this past weekend at 9am sharp and got my hands on one. Attempt #3 - long awaited success! \n\nThe flavor of the day was s'mores (2/5). (You can check their facebook page for their flavors that week, so you don't go on a day they have a flavor you don't want). Since I was already there, I snagged a couple other items as well. I got their strawberry elderberry croissant (4/5), matcha croissant (4/5), churro croissant (5/5), white chocolate cardamom donut (2/5), butterscotch donut (3/5), and the California croissant (5/5). Let me just say, they know how to make a damn good croissant. All the croissants were delicious, buttery, flakey, and not super sweet. My personal favorite was the churro croissant with the caramely filling in the middle. My friend couldn't stop raving about the California croissant, which was filled with flakey salmon and seaweed. For those who prefer savory over sweet, this is the perfect item for you. \n\nI was sorely disappointed by the cruffin and the donuts that I had heard so many good things about. The cruffin was way too dense. Croissants are supposed to be light and flakey, but because it was jammed into a muffin tin, the croissant dough didn't really get a chance to rise and just clumped all at the bottom. Their chocolate filling was good though, and the toasted marshmallow on top was a nice touch. Their donuts were also too dense for my liking and they were really dry. Both the cruffin and the donuts lacked filling. There was a thin streak through each donut and cruffin, but because of how dense they were, they both needed more. All in all though, I'll definitely be back here to try out their other savory and sweet croissant options!\n\nCons:\n- Cruffins and donuts are dense and overrated \n- Long line so be prepared to wait \n- Tend to run out of cruffins pretty early in the day, so if that's what you're coming here for be sure to get here early\n- No seating inside\n\nPros: \n- Croissants were darn near perfect \n- All their sweet items weren't grossly sweet like a lot of other bakeries\n- Pretty reasonably priced in terms of what you get", "author": "Diana C."}

Sigh.\n\nHowever, I was still able to try the donuts and the croissants there and those items are what this review is based off!\n\nNote that the donut flavors change daily so make sure to look online to find out what the flavors are for the day if you're looking for a particular one! The donuts available for the day that I went were blueberry lemonade and chocolate. The donuts were a little too sweet for my taste but overall were pretty solid. \n\nMy favorite was definitely the California Croissant. The concept is a little bit weird but it's basically a Japanese themed croissant with baked salmon, ginger, seaweed and sesame seeds in it. It comes with a soy sauce packet for you to drizzle over the whole thing. This was really nicely done! The croissant was flaky and nicely complimented savory bits of fish baked into the croissant.", "author": "Nancy T."}

The matcha croissant wasn't anything special, not the best croissant I've ever had but it was decent. It somehow lacked the crisp flakiness that I always crave with a croissant and it was just simply, a croissant dipped in matcha on one side. Their cookies however were much better and surprisingly tasteful. I should have just bought more cookies instead!", "author": "Alan C."}

I was lured by the interior design and the beautiful white with gold fonted bakery boxes I saw coming out on gleaming faces. \n\nThen I realized, this was the cruffin place, yes THE CRUFFIN, a croissant shaped like a muffin, filled with orgasmic buttery goodness. There wasn't a line and I knew it was too good to be true. It was about 10:30am and when I walked in, undoubtedly the pastry trays were sparse with only the circular butter rings left behind from the cruffin's morning presence. \n\nMy brother came to town to visit that weekend so this was the perfect motivation to wake up early with the single mission of consuming a warm, flaky cruffin. \n\nThis is the process people: \n- the shop opens at 7am, and yes, lines are already being formed by then\n- get a sticker that allows each person to order a max of 2 cruffins \n- cruffin orders officially start at 9am\n\nWe showed up at 8:30am on a Sat morning and were lucky enough to receive one of the last few stickers handed out that made us worthy of getting a cruffin. The line up was approx 30 mins before we got to the front where we loaded up on every baked good possible that would fit into the box. \n\nWe got a mix of sweet and savory baked goods: peanut butter chocolate cruffin x2, California croissant (salmon & seaweed), artichoke bacon croissant, mango coconut danish, blueberry french toast, pumpkin cheesecake donut ~ $35. \n\nEvery bite was worth it. My brother even surrendered his detox and derailed his 6 week flow for these orgasmic pastries. \n\nEat here!", "author": "Janice K."}

After seeing all the hype surrounding Mr.Holmes and coming across photos all over Instagram, I decided to make the drive down from the east bay to try it out. I woke up at 7 am just to get here so that the line for cruffins wouldn't be too long, that's how badly I wanted to try it haha. \n\n(Note: Cruffins don't come out until 9 AM, so don't come here as soon as they're open expecting them to be available.)\n\nMy boyfriend and I arrived around 9 AM on a saturday and quickly found parking across the street. At that time, the line wasn't too long, so we were able to receive a sticker that signified we would be able to purchase a maximum of two cruffins. The line probably took about 20-30 minutes and we were out of there with a box of six different pastries - 2 lemon cruffins, 2 matcha croissants, and 2 churro croissants. The cruffins were yummy, and my bf loved it specifically for the lemon cream inside. I thought the churro croissants were delicious - the outside was flaky and the inside was fluffy with what tasted like a maple or cinnamon cream?\n\nThe store itself is very tiny inside. There were no tables or chairs indoors or outdoors, so be prepared to take your patries to-go or to eat them standing outside. Service is quick and nice. \n\nOverall, I would say the line is worth it only if you wait about 30 minutes. Any longer than that, and it's a little much.  Other than that, if you really want the nice IG photo with the \"I got baked\" sign, guess that could be worth it too, lolol.", "author": "Michelle C."}

I knew Mr Holmes was close. i could smell him and his as yet un-tasted by me Cruffins. I was close.\nThen i saw the line and i knew i was in Cruffin-Ville!\nMr Holmes bakes things other than the earth shaking Cruffins like Cookies, plain and filled Croissants and something they call a Churro Croissant.\nShopping here is like shopping at a post Christmas Sale at Macy's. You know there are people waiting for your place and therefore you move quickly: probably missing several things.\nSome of the people in line told me they come 2 or 3 times A DAY to visit Mr Holmes and his stuff.\nSo i buy some Coffee Caramel Cruffins, Corn Flake Cookies, Churro Croissants and something called a California Cruffin.\nFirst the Cruffins: basically the Sweet Ones are sugared Croissants, baked in a muffin tin. I bought one stuffed with Coffee Flavored Caramel. Though the baking of the croissant was flawless: all flaky and buttery, very much in the French tradition, the filling was too much both in quantity and in sugarocity, Though a bit of this filling would have been enough. whoever was manning the pastry bag got carried away. Weight-wise there was more filling than Croissant. Yet all i did was squeeze most of the filling out and finished it. This cost $4.50: did you think i would dump it?\n Speaking of pricing: most items are 4-5 bucks which is pricey yet what cannot be denied is that these products are carefully and thoughtfully produced and just as beautiful as fine pastries that i have seen in Paris or Vienna.\nThe Churro Croissant was baked (not fried) and filled with a creamy, smooth, a little lemony Bavarian cream. Yes!\nThe Corn Flake Cookie was mouth melting-ly good. Very Good. Like Toffee and corn Flakes ground into a luscious, molassesy Cookie.\nThe California Cruffin was not sugared but it was stuffed with Smoked Salmon, Nori , Wasabi and Ginger. I couldn't have this everyday but for a savory it was pretty delicious.\nBTW: my perhaps future business partner, a San Francisco resident had never even heard of Mr Holmes or his wares but he was bowled over, almost literally after trying out all of these Bakery delights.\nAll in all a good visit to Mr Holmes and now I can scream from the rooftops: I AM A CRUFFINATOR! \n(attached is a You Tube about the Great Cruffin Caper!)\nhttps://youtu.be/l8fuNvLKk6o", "author": "Michael A."}

This bakery is known for making the elusive *Cruffin- cross between a croissant and a muffin. To keep the demand high and the suspense their the bakery only makes a limited number of cruffins per day and  you must go super early and get in line to get one. If you are not in line early your chances of trying the famous cruffins will be slim to none. Personally I enjoyed the donuts and other pastries more but you need to try them at least once.

We could tell where the shop was by the line and the bright pink neon signage. A very sweet and brave Holmes worker came out to the street to let us know that the people waiting in line where we were do not have the guarantee of receiving any cruffins. However, that is in case people before us didn't get their allowed quota of 2 cruffins for the day. We were not too far from the \"guaranteed\" customers, so we stuck through and actually were able to get cruffins which were a delicious cream-filled cruffin with a mini brownie on top! YUM. We had to get in another line and start over to pick other donuts...so come to Mr. Holmes expecting a wait.\n\nWe were helped both times by the wonderful and spirited Jeremy. Cheers to you ya breath of fresh winterfresh air!! He made the experience fun and positive so early in the morning, and even though some customers didn't respond well to it we were cheering for you and your personality all the way! A paper box fits 6 donuts basically, but you can stuff more in it if you're a baked goods savant. We also got two chocolate cream filled sugar donuts, which were alright compared to the other pastries. I loved their crispy flaky kougin aman and blackberry/cheesecake brioche bread! UM yes, I could eat that forever. The ube puff we just had to get because of that interesting bright pink prickly pear frosting on top! Hello audacity!\n\nThey also serve hot coffee with their signature bright pink peace sign imprinted. I also noticed lots of merch in the form of bags and water for self-service too. Not a lot of room inside or out for sitting, so most people just buy and take their treasures home. In terms of how long to keep them, we were able to eat them even 2 nights after and they were just as delicious and fresh with a quick pop in the oven. Nothing was overly sweet or crazily mixed with flavors. That's what I loved about Mr. Holmes. I will be back no matter the line!

The matcha croissant was BOMB. The perfect kind of flakiness you would ever want in a croissant, not like one of these soft and soggy croissants but actually crunchy flakes fall out whenever you take a bite. The cruffin on the other hand, was also crunchy and flaky, but it was a bit hard to chew on.

Though they are reknown for their Cruffins - the marriage of croissant dough baked into a deep muffin tin chockablock with delectable, piped-in fillings - I CRAVE their donuts. They have the best filled donuts in all of San Francisco - that I know of (so far). \nEvery single item (savory and sweet) I've had from the Bakehouse has been good (kouign amann - go to B Patisserie for theirs) to exquisite (most donuts and cruffins). They have their croissant dough down to a sweet (or savory) science! Most of their flavors are curious and amazing combinations. \nMy first trip to MHB was on St. Patrick's Day a couple of years ago. The flavors of that day were Irish Car Bomb cruffins and Whisky Caramel donuts. Since I'm not a huge fan of most alcohols, I was skeptical I'd like either pastry. Oh-Danny-Boy was I wrong! Both flavors were delectable and amazing! The Irish Car Bomb flavor was slightly sweet with the definitive splash of Guinness incorporated into the smoky-ish flavor of the cream filling the light and crispy muffin-shaped croissant. My mother, who is a tee-totaler, even loved the cruffin. \nThe Whisky Caramel-filled donut was just as drool-worthy. I'm a sucker for most caramel, but the depth of that whisky-infused caramel was buzz-worthy if only for each enchanting ounce of caramel filling that donut-belly. And the caramel, and all the donut flavors, is encased in some of the most light and lusciously yeasty pastry dough. The MHB elves do a remarkable job in frying each pillowy-goodness to the perfect point of both doughyness and crispiness. The sweetness of the dough is balanced with each flavor they choose to pipe in that day. If I lived closer, I would be a daily customer, the donuts are THAT good. \nMHB changed their flavor rotation to quarterly versus weekly sometime last year (2017), which I'm not a huge fan of since I adore rotating variety, but I know the flavors are well-done and on-point. I agree with others that the Matcha Croissants are okay and should have some piped-in filling, especially since MHB are masters of that skill. I tried most of the original line-up of pastries, including the California croissant (smoked salmon, nori, sesame, and pickled-ginger filled), and all were really good and crave-able. Now I see there are new \"standard\" items on their menu, I will have to go back to check out their new fascinating and unique flavor combinations encased in their amazing croissant and donut \"shells\".  \nSince I am a holistic person, I will also mention, their marketing acumen is marvelous, too. Their graphics, boxes, signage, and shop are definitely picture-worthy. I got a thing for hot pink, so the \"I got baked in SF\" neon always gives me a giggly grin each visit. I'm also a bag/container hoarder and do my best to keep my box of treats as pristine as possible, so I might be able to keep my non-pastry collections inside that beautiful white and gold case as a visual reminder of my SF happy foodie adventures/obnoxiousness. ;)", "author": "AK C."}

The blueberry and lemon worked really well together since the blueberry was sweet and the lemon was more tart, so there was a nice balance of sweetness to counteract each other. The dough of the cruffin itself was very flaky and chewy, which I loved. The pineapple papaya donut had the same effect on me. I didn't think those two flavors would go together especially since I've never heard of that flavor combination before but boy, was I wrong. I was blown away by how good their pastries were. I don't have a favorite from them because I honestly enjoyed everything I got and couldn't pick one for the life of me.", "author": "Linda C."}

Get there early to make sure you get cruffins because they sell out! \n\nOverall, the cruffins are so so good. It's flaky, like a croissant, and the cream filling is perfectly sweetened.

Yes.\n\nI'd wanted to stop by Mr. Holmes for the cruffins while in SF but was hesitant when my friend told me we had to get there pretty early to get in line and hope for the best. I'm not a fan of long lines and rarely think 1+ hour waits anywhere for anything is worth it. But man, am I glad we decided to wait. Cruffins are GLORIOUS and \"cruffin\" is officially my favorite portmanteau. Forget cronuts and whatever other hybrid of croissants x baked good exists. Cruffins are IT.\n\nFate would have it that the day's flavor was strawberry matcha aka my favorite two flavors of all time!! If you know me you know I love all things matcha/green tea, so when the employee made the announcement prior to handing out the coveted pink stickers that indicate you're guaranteed a cruffin that morning, I was ecstatic. \n\nWe arrived around 8:30AM on a Sunday and there was already a line forming. Needless to say, the wait was long because the shop is TINY and there's only one employee serving the cruffins, but luckily there are several Pokestops within the proximity of Mr. Holmes Bakehouse. Drop a lure and Pokemon & chill until 9AM when the cruffins are ready. Also, unfortunately, if you want to get a box you need 6+ baked goods and each person with a sticker is limited to 2 cruffins. So if you want the pretty gold foil box, you'll need to get in the other line for other pastries. \n\nOverall the entire ordeal took about 2 hours but the crispy, swirly, fluffy, matcha cream-filled deliciociousness was well worth it.

If you're anywhere in FiDi, you can walk over to Workshop Cafe and they have a stand right in front of their doors. Feast on most of their pastries they offer at their brick and mortar location, such as the donuts, kouign amanns, Danishes...\n\nWait, hold up...\"most\"?\n\nYes. Because they don't offer the cruffin here (their unicorn pastry, the one that put Mr. Holmes Bakehouse on the map!). \n\nActually, I personally prefer it that way, as I know it's difficult to mass produce in the first place, and there's just way too much demand for them right now. Besides, cruffins are worth going on a quest for anyway! \n\nHowever, I question how they are able to keep their pastries warm. Since I work next door, I stopped by for a savory artichoke and feta Danish, and it was quite cold, which took away from its flavor considerably. I guess you must come early to get it, or just toast it when you get to the office. \n\nAlso, instead of Sightglass Coffee, they offer brewed coffee supplied by Workshop. Not a plus or minus on their part, I felt the coffee did its job for me. \n\nAnyway, I'm also glad they have a presence in the FiDi now!

My party got there at 8am on a Saturday and there was already a little bit of a line - travels pretty quickly though! We got one of everything. Once we finished buying our pastries, we just moved on to the cruffin line. There was basically no line for the rest of the baked goods at 9 am! The staff is great; they keep the line updated pretty frequently (reminding people what each line is for, when the cruffins will be ready) and give you each a sticker to reserve two cruffins per person. So far, all of the pastries I've tried have been amazing! The pastries are the great because the flavors are bright and interesting and best of all, not too sweet. I really couldn't justify waking up early to wait in line in the cold to get a box of overpriced pastries, but I am definitely glad I was able to try this bakeshop.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-10-16", "description": "LOCATION// Tenderloin area. If you're walking here, you'll get to see some colorful characters/scenes. On my 8am walk here, got to witness man taking a #2 outside someone's business (right next to the doors), used needles from someone's last high, and plenty of other human #2s that seeemed to lead the way to the bakery. Not sure if you have to be afraid of being attacked in the day, maybe just offensive and racist obscenities thrown at you (in my case). Just keep walking, no big deal, it'll just add to your day. Definitely don't come at night, though, because if the broken glass on the bakery doors are any indication, maybe things do get a little iffy at certain times of the day.\n\nGOOD TO KNOW// Two lines out the door. One is CRUFFIN ONLY (but you can add coffee), of which sales start at 9am. Two per person (e.g., if you come with a friend, you're allowed 4). You cannot choose your cruffin flavor. There is only one flavor for the day, so check beforehand on the website before lining up if you care what you're lining up for.\nThe other line is for every other pastry/coffee/etc. No, you cannot order your doughnut in the cruffin line. You must get back out and line up at the other line after you've paid for your cruffin.\n\nVERDICT// Is it hyped? Yes. Is it worth it? I dunno for you, it's just croissant dough pressed into a muffin mold then injected with whatever flavored cream and dusted with sugar crystals. The novelty factor is the shape of the croissant. Did it taste special to me? No. Did it taste good/decent? Yes. Remarkable? Not to me.\n\nI also tried some of the other pastries. I thought the calamansi doughnut was good, but everything else that was made with croissant/flaky pastry dough tasted burnt. You can tell from the photos, that dark browning is charring, not \"golden brown.\" The one sliver of pear on my poached pear and cheese pastry was good, unfortunately it was mostly dough, 90% of which was just so bitter that I had to throw it away. I wouldn't come here again, but some of the flavor profiles are good. The pastry dough is a little dense, though, not enough air between the layers.\n\nSTAFF// Yeah, the people at the bakery are smug. But I didn't see them being rude to anyone. Front of house just act a little bemused and self-congratulatory.\n\nThey also put pastries inside individual waxed paper bags. I bought 4 pastries, and she just handed me four separate bags. Most other bakeries would either put them all in a larger bag or in a box for you, so that it's easier to carry. Instead, here they seem to save the boxes (sturdy, thick cardboard ones that probably cost more than typical cake boxes) for customers who are also getting cruffins.\n\nTIP// The non-cruffin line actually moves pretty fast. So don't be intimidated if you want to try something else from the bakery. Avoid weekends, and you can avoid long waits for cruffins. Otherwise, come around 8 or 8:30am to guarantee yourself one.", "author": "Ada L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-15", "description": "Alright, so I know that Mr. Holmes is known for their croissant muffins, known widely as cruffins. And I was prepared for a long line.\n\nBut, surprisingly, an hour after opening on a Saturday morning, the line wasn't too bad. It didn't even go down for half a block. But then I realized the line was really for Cruffins, and if you weren't getting any ... you could BYPASS the entire line and just get your other pastries instead. \n\nThe Cruffins were in the last stages of being baked and were going into the display case within the next 10-15 minutes. I had done my research beforehand and realized the flavor of the day--I think it was blackberry--was not one I was super stoked to try. Granted, if it were something chocolaty or cinnamony, I would have waited my turn in that line. But, since I had my eyes on the other pastries and on the chocolate chip cookies, my friend and I breezed past the line and got up close to the bakery display case.\n\nThe Mr. Holmes logo is to the left when you enter the store, so you can pause briefly and take your picture before proceeding to check out the treats for the day. I was overwhelmed -- everything smelled delicious and it was hard to narrow down my choices. It was a good thing I had an idea of what I wanted before entering the bakery, so I could attempt to demonstrate some sort of self-control. \n\nIf you have never been there before, Mr. Holmes is definitely worth checking out ... especially if you love bakeries and have a sweet tooth, like me. It'll be hard to stick to your designated list, that's for sure, because everything looks and smells so good! Pastries are about $3-4 each, depending on what you get. My advice would be to get a good assortment if it's your first time - I got a cookie and one of the croissant varieties, and if we were not walking around the city all day, I would have gotten one of the donuts as well.\n\nHere's what I got:\n\n\"Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie\": This cookie was nothing short of amazing, sporting the perfect balance of salty and sweet. At first, I was afraid that the cookie would be too crunchy for my preference ... but the girl behind the counter reassured me that it was slightly crunchy on the outside, but soft and chewy in the middle. She was totally right and I'm glad I ended up getting two of these cookies. They were chockfull of chocolate chips, which was good news, but the crowning glory was that sea salt on top. I've had salted chocolate chip cookies before, but I think this version had the most salt I've ever tasted on a cookie before. At first bite, it was borderline too salty ... but as I continued to eat the cookie, more and more, I was convinced that the amount of salt worked in the cookie's favor and made it more amazing. The cookie was soft and chewy in texture, but the salt crystals gave it some extra crispiness. Yum! I absolutely dream about these cookies now and would get more if I ever return to Mr. Holmes. There was also a Cornflake Cookie (brown butter toffee and cornflake cereal) that was available, but this cookie is sure to be crunchier because of those cornflakes. I was intrigued and did want to try it (I love the salted oatmeal cornflake from Sprinkles Cupcakes), but decided to save that cookie for a future visit. \n\n\"Bear Claw\": I was so busy asking questions about the chocolate chip cookie that I didn't even see this pastry at first. My friend brought it to my attention, saying that I should try it because it contained chocolate chips and the traditional croissant ... but not in the traditional form. I'm not sure if this was a weekend special, but I didn't see it on the Mr. Holmes website before, and I'm so glad I tried it! It was definitely different. This huge bear claw featured layers of croissant dough, but it also appealed to my sweet tooth because it had a chocolate chip cookie dough filling. I didn't taste it with my initial few bites, but once I hit the middle of the bear claw, it felt like it was eating cookie dough, straight up! It was sweet and indulgent--definitely sweeter than the salted chocolate chip cookie I got--but not overly sweet, since the croissant was plain (no glaze). If you like cookie dough or want an unusual treat, I highly recommend this option. \n\n\"Churro Croissant\": If my purse had been any bigger, I would have ordered one of these as well. I love churros because of their cinnamon flavor, and this croissant looked absolutely delicious in the display case. It featured dulce de leche cream and cinnamon sugar ... and boy, was it covered in cinnamon sugar. I was curious about the dulce de leche cream but from the outside, this croissant really did remind me of a churro because of the liberal amount of cinnamon sugar on the outside. I definitely want to try it one day - because I know the croissants really are delicious, thanks to the bear claw, I'm sure this cinnamon flavor would hit the spot.", "author": "Kelli S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-19", "description": "I arrived at 8:40am on a Monday to join the line, waited 20 minutes for the cruffins to come out of the oven, spent $27.50 on a box of pastries without any second thoughts, Instagrammed the \"I got baked in San Francisco\" (after multiple tries, of course), walked briskly through the sketchy neighborhood (not sure if I was more likely to be robbed of my Mr. Holmes goodies or my wallet), and arrived at my car with one minute left in the meter. I find it moderately alarming that this all seems perfectly normal.... because it is the quintessential way to spend a weekday morning in SF.\n\n[TL;DR] Is it worth it? \nIf you are a food enthusiast and/or have lots of free time: yes.\nIf you are curious but relatively busy: yes, at least once.\nIf you just want the Instagram: maybe.\nJust because: no.\n\nMr. Holmes has been on my bucket list for awhile, and this is my charmed third time after two unsuccessful pilgrimages. Its cruffins are likely the most elusive, legendary baked goods in the Bay Area! Who would have thought that even weekday morning visits require standing in line. (But then again, start-up workdays beginning at 11am and idle millennials are well known and jested about - sigh - gentrification)\n\nIf you do decide to tackle the ordeal, I suggest arriving around 8:30am on a weekday. Weekends are too crazy, and you have to deal with two lines, one just for cruffins and another for everything else! The meter parking fees kick in at 9am, so plan accordingly and bring quarters (I actually saw cops checking). Street parking isn't so bad around that time, though the rate is a hefty $3.25/hr. Also, be sure to check their weekly Instagram updates for cruffin/doughnut flavors--if you're going through all this trouble, you'd better be excited for your cruffin.\n\n(+++) Strawberry lemon cruffin - Mmm as epic as expected. Flakey soft croissant layers filled with fruity custard, coated in sugar like a morning bun (reminiscent of Chinese sugar egg puffs). It boasts a melt-in-your-mouth texture and the filling tastes freshly made of fruit with just the right sweetness. The beautiful shape of the cruffin wins the beauty pageant of pastries, though it could use an additional garnish.\n\n(+++) California croissant - A California roll inside a croissant?! This sourcery of a croissant filed with a small smoked salmon roll, a dash of wasabi, and a sesame coating turned out unexpectedly mind-blowing. The roll was small but I did appreciate the art of airniness in the croissant composition.\n\n(++) Plain croissant - Crisp exterior and silky interior. I liked how there wasn't a caramelized layer like Arsicault and Neighbor, which I find excessive. Really enjoyed Mr. Holmes' simple perfection.\n\n(+) Choux bomb - Tasty with the coffee cream in between buttery cookies with a small chocolate piece; however, I am not a fan of buttercream and I thought this used way too much (which also made it difficult to eat). Too sweet and not as outstanding as the others, but very pretty.\n\n(+/-) Ube pastry - Not as refined in aesthetics (rectangular pastry with a smear of bright magenta frosting) and taste (the sweet ube paste and frosting made it way too sugary, and it had disappointingly little ube flavor). Probably the least remarkable item I tried; like a fancy pop tart.\n\nTips:\n- To get a box, you must buy a minimum of 6 pastries, and it is a darn fine box of thick cardboard and shiny letters\n- Max 2 cruffins per customer\n- Mentally prepare yourself that the surrounding area smells rancid, but once you walk into the shop you are bathed in the aroma of bakery heaven\n- Don't plan to Instagram holding a cruffin in front of the sign; in my opinion this is too messy because the sugar coating. (Plus, there is a line of people judging you)\n\n[THE VERDICT] The hype borders on ridiculous, but Mr. Holmes deserves its fame for the consistently high quality, clever uniqueness, and sheer perfection. While browsing their website, I found that their shift begins at 3am! And in spite of the inelastic demand, they keep their prices reasonable-ish (in SF standards) at ~$3.5-5 for most bakery items, versus Tartine's more exorbitant prices. The value of Mr. Holmes' pastries is indeed evident by the intriguing news of a burglar who stole the cruffin recipe and left the cash register untouched.", "author": "Edna C."}

If you're a foodie, this whole experience is a lot of fun. If you're not a foodie, this whole experience will make you hate the foodie friend who convinced you to participate in this crazy circus that is Mr Holmes Bakehouse.\n\nThings to know before you visit the Bakehouse:\n-Cruffins are available at 9am, but stickers to those waiting in line go out about 8:50am\n-They make roughly 200 cruffins a day, but some of the 200 won't make the cut due to baking discrepancies and what have you, so it can be more or less depending on the day \n-Each person who receives a sticker can purchase up to 2 cruffins\n-The flavor of cruffin served each day changes! The menu is posted on their website/IG\n-There are two lines that form in front of the Bakehouse: one line for cruffin purchases ONLY and another line for all other pastries and merchandise.\n-The box comes with the purchase of roughly six pastries, any less than that and they might just bag your pastries. A friend asked if she could buy a box but they said no.\n\nNow I know what you really want to know: how early do I have to get there to guarantee myself a cruffin? There is no straight answer to that. Some days are busier than others. I can only share my personal experience. I arrived at 8:35am on a Saturday morning (they open at 8am on weekends) and immediately got in the cruffin line. There were already 30 people ahead of me.\n\nI visited with two other friends. I had one friend hold our spot while my other friend came with me to take the obligatory Instagram pictures inside while it wasn't busy (I recommend this because once the cruffins come out it gets pretty packed in there). At 8:50am we each got a sticker guaranteeing our cruffin and by 9:10ish we had cruffin in hand. This line goes pretty quick because you can only purchase the cruffin in this line. Then we jumped in the other, much shorter line and bought some of the other delicious delicacies inside.

I came for the cruffins, and arrived around 8:30am (since cruffin distribution starts at 9am). When you're standing in the line, you're so tempted to buy other pastries because they all look so good! The cruffin itself was amazing though and definitely worth the wait. My friend and I originally thought that the flavor that day was going to be chocolate cream, but it turned out, that was one of the donut flavors instead and the actual cruffin flavor was passion fruit. Check Instagram to see what the flavors that week will be! At first we were disappointed, but it was hard to stay disappointed after taking our first bites of the delicious pastry. The tangy passion fruit cream on the inside actually complimented the sweet, flaky croissant on the outside quite well. \n\nYou can also get a nice box of you buy 6+ items, but it costs an additional $1.50 for it. The pastries are all pretty pricey too (and cruffins are $4/each), but they'd make a great gift since everything is presented so nicely.

Im not even a donut person, but wow so impressed!\n\nOf so the cruffin. I expected to looooove it. How could you not a croissant and muffin hybrid?! But i found it too sweet personally (and i loooove sweets).   Its a sugar coated croissant texture with cream filling like the donut. Maybe the flavour i had the cream was too sweet? It was just alot with sweet cream and sugar coating and chocolate balls on top. That day the cream was cannoli cream. \n\nA few days later when i recovered from my sugar coma I tried their croissant and their ubi (probably misspelling) puff which is like a homemade pop tart with sweet plum filling. The ubi was pretty good the frosting was really unique and flavorfull just wish there was more plum filling (it was pretty empty :(  )\n\n\nSo in conclusion amaaaazing coissant, great donuts, ube puff was a nice lil sugary snack and cruffin was good but not as good as its hyped to be.\n\n\nSomething definitely worth mentioning is that they have an instagram account where they do a weekly post of both cruffin flavours and donut flavours.\n\nDefinitely going back to this place to try more of their pastries. Also worth mentioning the staff was very friendly and informative.", "author": "Sara Emily S."}

My friend and I ordered the Thai tea cruffin, chocolate banana donut, Kahlua something donut, caramel apple bourbon square looking thing (LOL), and a cornflake cookie. Out of those 5 items I only really liked the cornflake cookie! The Thai tea cruffin wasn't very soft and the Thai tea flavoring was meh. I'm not a big fan of anything tasting like alcohol so I guess thats why I didn't like the kahlua donut and bourbon thing. I guess after the cookie I would say the next best thing was the chocolate banana donut. Their donuts remind me of malasadas! So maybe I would like them if I came on a day with a flavor I like.. \n\nSo anyway,we bought six items so we got their cute box for free! The total came out to 23 for six items! A little pricey if you ask me. I'd have to say if I'm going to spend that much I'd rather go to b patisserie.

I personally went for the Kouign Amann which was described as a caramelized croissant.

They also sell tote bags among other things there.\n\nI came here for the aesthetic of the \"I got baked in San Francisco\" sign and the shop was a lot smaller than I expected.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-04", "description": "I'm actually not usually a pastries person (especially when it comes to breakfast) because I always crave savory food. Mr.Holmes lives up to all of the hype, the expectation, and the anticipation for me and I don't mind the sugar rush after stuffing down a donut and a cruffin in 10 minutes. \n\nTIP: Check Mr.Holmes' Instagram for weekly flavor updates. Cruffins flavors are as listed. As for donuts , the store tend to have two to three flavors even though there's only 1 listed online. Save yourself the disappointment and check the flavors before just in case you're not a fan of something. \n\nCRUFFIN PROCEDURES: \nHere's the lowdown for your weekday/weekend cruffin adventure: weekend lines are ridiculous. I would definitely recommend coming here on the weekday if you have time to snatch a cruffin. I've been here around 8:30/8:45 during the weekdays and there are no lines at all. I came here pretty late on a Sunday around 8:45 and the line was almost around the block. Cruffins come out at 9am and is limited to 2 per person (doesn't matter how many stickers they have). The store will give you a sticker as a number count for how many cruffins they made to how people are in line. Don't be discourage if you don't get a sticker! They tend to have leftovers (some people only buy 1 instead of 2 or there's extras) so stick it out until the end (unless you're really really late then yeah, sorry!)\n\nTASTE: \n(+) Cruffin: As for the cruffins themselves, they're worth the wait and the hype in my opinion - even though I do agree with the argument that it's basically just a croissant baked in a muffin form. However, it is crispier than a regular croissant and definitely not as heavy as a muffin so I'm getting the best of both worlds! No complaints here. I've had the passionfruit guava and it's delicious. I prefer the cruffins over the donuts because there's not as much fillings in the cruffins so it doesn't overwhelm the pastry. \n\n(+) Donut: If you missed the cruffins line, I still recommend trying the donuts! I love how soft and light it is but the filling makes the whole thing pretty heavy for breakfast (& the sugar high!) . The matcha is my favorite but the blueberry jam and the vanilla ( + basically any flavors) will put all other donuts to shame. \n\nBesides the cruffins and donuts, the other pastries are also not short of expectations. The regular croissants and the bread pudding were spot on. You have to buy 4 things to get a box , or they'll charge you an extra $1.50.

First off, the lines are not that bad if you're just looking to get their regular pastries.  In fact the line on a Sunday morning was dead at one point for pastries.  As for the cruffin line, that seems to fill up, but at 9am, it didn't look like they had given out all the stickers which guarantee you 2 cruffins.  \n\nAs for what I sampled, some things were great while others were plain or not so great.\n\nCookies and Cream Cruffin\nLoved the cruffin part, hated the filling.  I really didn't care for the flavor, but since I was in SF I had no choice since the flavors change daily and this was what they had that day.  I would pass on this flavor unless you like frosting,  The flavor is spot on, but it's a lot of cream.  The cruffin itself was great, it was like a croissant but on the heavier side.  I would've preferred a plain cruffin over this flavor if they had plain cruffins.  But for the wait, not sure if I would line up again for this.  It wasn't to die for great.\n\nCalifornia Croissant\nProbably my favorite thing here.  Got it fresh first thing in the morning.  It makes a great on the go breakfast.  The croissant was really light and flaky.  On the drier side.  But the salmon, nori, and ginger inside added some moisture and made the entire thing taste fantastic.  I loved the flavor, and it did remind me of eating sushi.\n\nUbe Puff\nDisappointing, I didn't much care for this one.  I thought there would be a stronger ube flavor, but it was pretty light.  It was a cool concept in writing, but the execution wasn't anything I was crazy about.\n\nRaspberry Donut\nGreat donut, and fantastic filling.  I loved the raspberry filling they had.  The donut was light and tasty.  The filling wasn't too sweet, but there was a ton of filling.  It was almost borderline creamy and really reminded me of raspberry sorbet.  \n\nApple Honey Bostock\nMy least favorite thing that I tried.  It looked great, but didn't taste like anything special.  The outer crust portion was pretty hard compared to the rest of it and it tasted sorta burned almost.  There also wasn't too much apple to go with the rest of it.  \n\nOverall, this place is probably worth the visit, if not for the cruffin, then for the California croissant.  The other items are pretty hit or miss.  Choose carefully since they're pretty pricey (most stuff are $4+).  Also if you're coming for the cruffin, check for what flavor is being offered, makes a big difference.", "author": "Bryson L."}

I have to admit the cruffin is a rather unique idea (and definitely makes an awesome/hipster picture for Instagram and snapchat). A cruffin is a croissant in the shape of muffin and has cream filling in the inside. Mr. Holmes offers only one flavor each day for the cruffin. The best way to check the flavor of the day is to check their Instagram page. They start selling the cruffin at 9am each day. However, depending on the flavor of the day, the length of the line varies. Today (a Friday), the line for the Matcha Mallow was rather long at 8:30 already. Yet there were times when I didn't see a line until 9....\n\nAside from the cruffins, they also offer a variety of other pastries including doughnuts, croissants, danishes, cookies (no need to wait in line for these pastries!). If you weren't able to get the cruffin, just get the doughnuts instead. They used the same kind of filling. I suspect they probably reuse the cruffin filling because I have seen the doughnut filling being the same as the cruffin from a few days earlier.\n\nOverall, the cruffin is an interesting idea. The outside is very crunchy and the inside has the same texture as a croissant. Aside from the shape, it is very similar to the cronut from Dominique Ansel in NYC. The rest of the pastries weren't that much of a surprise to me compared to other bakeries in San Francisco.", "author": "Ida L."}

Good thing everything they serve here is quite good and everyone who works there are great!\n\nDonuts are always good because every component is good: the dough, the amount of sugar coated, the cream, the cuteness. Every flavor I've tried (Vanilla, Lemon Poppy, Chocolate, Orange Cream, others) has been juicy. Obviously some are better than others depending on preference. What I can tell you is that I would never go for an Orange Cream donut but my friend gave it to me and I ended up really liking this donut 100x more than I thought. \n\nThe Choux Bomb is decadent and kind of annoying to handle because it's fragile and needs to stay cool but it is worth trying. Very sweet and delicious.\n\nUbe Puff Pastry was something I really looked forward to, but I was not interested in the tangy frosting/coating on the top of the pastry (I think it's blueberry?). Everything about the flavor was not familiar to me or what I expected based on what I know of ube (nutty, coconut milky) so I was personally disappointed. However, the puff itself is not bad. \n\nOn the days I don't get to get donuts, I still order everything else.\n\nIn terms of savory, I've tried the California Croissant and the Onion Tart. The CA Croissant (California roll in a croissant) was interesting...smoked salmon, wasabi, and other things I don't remember. It was good! Onion tart was DELICIOUS! I would for sure get that one again.\n\nBoisenberry Tart, Blueberry Bostock, and Kouign Amanns were all great. The Bread Pudding was a surprising, delicious surprise as it was juicy. The salted chocolate chip cookies were good, but too salty in my opinion. \n\nOverall FANTASTIC bakery that is pretty worth the hype, it's just that it's better to avoid the lines if you can.

It was only around 12pm on a Friday when we walked up to the store only to see the infamous sign, \"SOLD OUT.\" I was devastated. And when things like this happen to me, it only makes me want whatever the hell it is that much more. A nice man from inside Mr. Holmes saw how sad I was and gave us some \"defected\" croissants from that day, but DAMN THEY WERE SO GOOD. I could not believe these were defected. How? They were buttery, soft, flaky, a little sweet... Unlike anything I have ever tasted. I can only imagine what the non-defected ones taste like haha.\n\nFast forward to today... (11:30am on a Friday) They were open with pastries in tow and the line was very short. I happily got to try a variety of their Le Donuts, a Strawberry Jalape\u00f1o Brioche Bomb, and a Potato Danish. Their Le Donut flavors today were 1) Vanilla Lavender 2) Guava Earl Grey and 3) Raspberry Cream, which were all very delicious.

Taking advice from all the other Yelpers, I made sure I was out of the house by 7 to make the hour long drive up to San Francisco. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ended up getting there a couple minutes after the bakery opened on Sunday. Rather than trying to park on the street, we found a small parking garage just around the corner and just parked there ($3 every half hour, if anyone's curious). We stood in line for maybe 15 minutes before we got into the bakery and were able to purchase the regular baked goods. Donuts, croissants, danishes, etc. We filled up a box, which hold at least 6 items. This is super easy to do, and your money will be spent quickly, especially if you tack on some of their other merchandise like I did. \n\nAfter we had made our first round of purchases, we went back outside to wait in the line for the elusive ~cruffin~. We waited about half an hour, and we were maybe the 15th people back in line. At about 8:45 (they start selling cruffins at 9), someone from the bakery comes outside and hands out a sticker. If you get a sticker, then you know they have enough cruffins for you. Two per person, but if you're in a group you can pay together. For example, my boyfriend and I each had a sticker, so I just bought 4 at once. The flavors of cruffins change every day, and they post on their Instagram every Sunday for the coming week's flavors, so check there to make plans for a specific day, if you want a certain flavor. \n\nEverything ran super smooth and everyone was really nice and very helpful! Though the line really did start to build up at 8:40, so I'd definitely advise getting there early. \n\nIn terms of merchandise, I bought a tote bag ($12), a coffee mug ($19), and a pin (I think it was $8?, I'm not 100% sure). They also had aprons that came with a pin ($35), and pre-packaged oatmeal. \n\nThe cruffin was delicious, of course, but my favorite otherwise (of what I've eaten so far), was the churro croissant and my boyfriend *loved* the ferrero rocher croissant! I've got enough pastries left over to last me the rest of this week for breakfast, and I'm looking forward to trying something new every day! I loved my experience at Mr. Holmes and I'll definitely be back!!", "author": "Samantha V."}

Nah.\n\nI came to Mr. Holmes Bakehouse on a Tuesday and was the first person in line for cruffins! Whoaaaaaaa! Never thought that would've happened in years. Honestly, if I wasn't first in line, it wouldn't have been worth the wait. For one, I thought that there would be more than one cruffin option. NOPE. New flavors daily. That sucks because I'm not a big fan of chocolate and the flavor of the day was Chocolate Rye. Lame, it doesn't even sound appetizing. I was hoping for a green tea cruffin or creme brulee or something neat. The chocolate cruffin honestly was just okay. It wass comparable to pastries elsewhere. This place is just overhyped nonsense in my opinion and I think that The Boulangerie in Dallas/Village Baking is much better. There is such a low cream filling to cruffin ratio, and even though I got the cruffin right out of the oven it was very hard and tasted stale. It was a huge bummer.\nI wish that this place met my expectations, but at least I didn't have to wait.", "author": "Violet H."}

I don't think I ever need to go back here, especially with the line. I think one cruffin is enough for two people - they have so much filling! The donuts aren't that great either.\nI'm glad I went just to try it,  *obviously* had to be one of \"those people\" and get the pic with the neon sign, but the flavor of the pastries are not as good as the presentation.", "author": "Emma B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-13", "description": "Ok, so two things I absolutely hate about Mr. Holmes: the absurd hype, and the intentional scarcity.\n\nThat's what leads to over 100 people lined up on a Friday morning by 9:10am. Cruffins come out at 9am, but I timed my arrival to 8:15am and I think it was a good choice - I was about 10th in line and was done with my purchase by 9:10. I doubt the people who joined the line after 8:40ish had a chance at a cruffin.\n\nUnlike most places, I definitely blame Mr. Holmes for the hype because they purposefully produce scant quantities of their main item and only bring it out at one time every day... Even if they only want to produce X amount of cruffins each day, I think bringing them out in two batches (as in, one at 9 and one later) would give people more opportunities to get them. As it is, you only have a chance of getting a cruffin if you have the luxury of waiting around for long periods in the morning in the middle of a not-so-great area. So I hate that, and probably won't go back now that I've finally tried a cruffin... unless a friend from out of town is persuasive enough, perhaps.\n\nThat said, cruffins are pretty damn good. Very flaky on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside, and the cream fillings have great texture. I was a little disappointed that the matcha dark chocolate cruffin fillings were mostly dominated by the chocolate cream, so I didn't taste much matcha, but that's not too huge of an issue. \n\nTheir donuts are lovely as well, and they usually have more flavors than what is listed on their weekly Instagram posts. But they sell out almost as quickly as the cruffins! I think that's probably because their other croissants, Danishes, etc. are all items that could be found at other bakeries. \n\nAnd finally, their staff are usually great. Very quick and friendly, even when mobbed by the morning rush.\n\nSo, although I like to lead with the negative, I think four stars is a good approximation of my opinions toward Mr. Holmes - it could be a great experience if not for the limited quantities and long waits, so one star off for that. But I think it's definitely worth a one-time visit.", "author": "Delia Z."}

This shop's specialty is its cruffins. The combination of a croissant and a muffin gives you the specialty cruffin! I believe they have a different flavor of cruffin every day. There's always long lines here since the goods are sold out pretty quickly, so it's best to come early to get your hands on the cruffin and any other pastries you're in the mood for. It might get a little crazy having to wake up early and wait in line, but getting to the front of the line, entering the shop and then feasting your senses on all the pastries is totally worth it!

And if I'm waking up extra early, I'm probably trying to visit Mr. Holmes Bakehouse on my way to the office.  \n\nMr. Holmes Bakehouse is inconveniently located on Larkin St., meaning that if you're coming via BART, you need to brace yourself for an interesting walk through the Tenderloin district of SF.  If you're eying one of their precious cruffins, I suggest arriving bright and early.  If you plan on queueing at 9am for cruffins, save yourself the effort and try for an earlier start the next day.  I lined up at 9am once and literally the 2nd person ahead of me in line purchased the last 2 cruffins.  \n\nI only purchase cruffins when I have a special visitor in town and I want to treat them to an exclusive SF treasure.  I've only successfully purchased 2 different types of cruffins. Cookie Dough and Passion Fruit, and I must admit, they're worth the hype.  Flavor and texture are on point. \n\nThe donuts are also the best I've ever had, but I'm also very partial to filled donuts with custard fillings.  I have tried the passion fruit donut, bananas foster, and orange creamsicle donuts.  They should consider changing the name of the orange creamsicle because I was expecting something that tasted overly sweet and artificial and the flavor turned out to be anything but.  It was light, mildly sweet, and rich with the essence of orange zest which cut through the sugar and \"dough-y-ness\" like a delicious hot knife through equally delicious butter.  Without exaggeration, these are literally my number one favorite donuts in the entire world.\n\nI initially discovered Mr. Holmes Bakehouse by searching for the best croissants in the city on Yelp.  The croissants are fantastic and it is very, very obvious in taste that they are made with high quality real butter.  Rumor has it that the butter is purchased from France.\n  \nIf you're looking to get one of their signature white boxes, plan on purchasing 6 or more pastries, or paying an additional fee.  I'm not waking up early and queueing for anything less than 6 pastries so this has not been an issue for me.\n\nMr. Holmes Bakehouse is great, but it'd be even better if there were enough cruffins for everyone.

We arrived shortly after 8am. First thing you need to know are that there are two lines! One for their famous cruffins and one for their other baked goods. So make sure you come with at least one other person and make them wait in the cruffin line! They open at 8am but don't start selling cruffins until 9!\n\nThe bf and I got in the regular baked goods line while my other two friends waited in the cruffin line. Service was so friendly! They told us that we had to order 6 pastries at least to get the box. So being the basic people that we are, of course we got 6 pastries! Out of the 6, I recommend the chioux bomb (basically a cream puff), coconut cream donut, ube puff pastry, and the chocolate croissant! All the pastries range from 3-5 dollars a pop. My total came out to be 25 dollars. \n\nWe exited the store and returned to our friends who were waiting in the cruffin line and switched places with them so they could line up in the regular baked goods line. It may look pretty long but it moves pretty fast because they got their pastries before the cruffins started selling! \n\nOut comes one of the workers at 8:50 and she explained that she would hand out one sticker per person to the people waiting in the cruffin line. If you manage to get a sticker, you're guaranteed two cruffins! She made it about three-fourths of the way down the block before she ran out of stickers. So if you come and you're after that point, you aren't guaranteed a cruffin :( \n\nFast forward to when we actually got our cruffins. Omg they were amazing. The flavor of the day was \"death by chocolate\". You can find what flavors they offer for the week on their Facebook page! It was a bit messy to eat because of all the sugar so make sure you get napkins. The cruffin had so many fluffy layers and was filled to the max in the middle with chocolate cream. Delicious!

There were two donut flavors that day and they rotate flavor so check their Instagram. We had the cherry almond and a mixed berry. The cherry almond was really good!! Not only is the filling flavorful, the donut itself was fluffy! They had a few savory danishes, but this one was recommended. It was super flaky and the filling was good, but I'm more of a sweets girl. \n\nNow onto the cruffin...They start handing out stickers in order to know how many people will be able to get one. By 9 am, the line wraps around the block! The flavor was rose champagne and it was beautiful. Literally so pretty, I didn't want to eat it. The filling was delicious and the outside was super buttery and flaky. \n\nI'd say, try the cruffin at least once but get the Ube tart and donuts! Literally everything else was amazing so you're not missing out either way.", "author": "Vy T."}

The cruffin flavors always change but so far I've tried the matcha and black sesame as well as the pink lemonade too and both were amazing!

(I went on a weekend, so the line was to the left, if you're facing the store, but apparently if you go on a weekday, it's to the right). If you get a sticker, that means you're guaranteed to buy cruffins. The limit is 2 per sticker per person and the flavors are posted weekly on their Instagram (@mrholmesbakehouse). \n\nDo not be bummed if you miss out on the cruffins, because honestly, their other pastries deserve the amount of praise and recognition as the cruffins get! They have the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had! I love how they add sea salt on top, it gives the perfect balance between sweet and salty. I'm also a fan of their croissants and their California Croissant is a must try! You have to get 6 pastries in order to not get charged for the box.\n\nTheir \"I Got Baked in San Francisco\" is a super cute light up sign that is so Instagram worthy, but it's really difficult to take a picture with it because the bakery is so small and cramped.

We ordered a couple of butter croissants, 1 prickly pear donut (their only other option was orange pilsner), a chocolate chip cookie, and their butter toffee cookie.\n\nThe butter croissants were nice and silky. They're made with french-cultured butter, similar (but not as delicious) to a true Parisian croissant. Thumbs up.\n\nThe doughnut - sorry - was gross. Legit milky peptobismol lol - Not even the churro-style donut could recover from that filling. Thumbs down.\n\nThe cookies. The butter toffee cookie was nice - Not too sweet, but a bit too snickerdoodle-ish. The chocolate chip cookie had tons of chocolate chunks, which I liked, but! they're way too excited with their salt. They use salt slivers on their cookies, so the first bit tasted like I dipped my beautiful cookie in the ocean. Once I removed them, the cookie was bomb.

While waiting in the 30 minute long line - I mean, I had nothing else to do - people were coming out with bags and boxes full of treats. Ok, really now, this place HAS to be amazing. I finally get inside after waiting in the blistering cold to find a pretty decent amount of items to select from. It ranged from cookies to croissants to cruffins (that's a croissant/muffin hybrid, for those of you who were curious). My favorites were the pastries dipped in white chocolate matcha. \n\nTrying out the food was alright. I wasn't really blown away as much as I would've loved to. I mean, come on, I waited for 30 minutes. But I appreciate how different their pastries are. Who would've thought to mix matcha green tea with white chocolate and dip a croissant in it? Or make a muffin out of a croissant? Genius. But was I impressed?

Enjoyed the savory pastries more than the sweet ones here, but felt like they were pretty overpriced. Did the quality justify the price? It depends on what you get.\n\nCame here for the second time 9am on a Monday, and waited around 15 minutes. This time around I ordered all of the supposed hyped pastries, such as the cruffins, filled donuts and california croissant.\n\nCruffin: Flavor of the day was Matcha Green Tea. Score. I love matcha green tea flavored stuff, but I have to say I was actually pretty disappointed in the cruffins as it was basically just a croissant overly coated in sugar, filled with custard like fillings, and baked in a muffin mold. The taste could be described as if someone accidentally spilled a pound of sugar on it. Also I have tried the cronut in the east coast, and felt that cronuts were superior to cruffins. I guess I expected to be something mind-blowing, however, the cruffins are definitely aesthetically pleasing and instagram worthy. Would I wait more than 30minutes for these suckers? No. Or at least, not anymore. But if you have a sweet tooth, go for it, tiger. \n\nDonut: Got the blueberry-cheesecake filled donut. I like this one because I just love custard filled donuts in general... but again, that excessive sugar coating took away from its taste and elegance. The filling reminded me that of Beard Papa's cream puffs. \n\nCalifornia Croissant: Inside the croissant, there is a seaweed wrapped smoked salmon? and more than generous amount wasabi (or similar downed version of wasabi paste). The croissant itself was suuuuperrr flaky and crispy, which me gusta. It surely was an interesting item to try, but I wish there was more of the salmon and less of the wasabi inside.\n\nOverall, I recommend this bakery to try different pastries.

The fillings for their donuts, cruffins, and other pastries change often, so be sure to ask what's being sold day of. \n\nThey start selling their famous cruffins 1 hr after opening each day. There's a limit of 2 per person, so if you're buying for a group, don't just go by yourself. Typically there's are two lines, one for cruffins, and one for other stuff. Show up 30 min early and get in queue. If you have a friend, I recommend buying some other stuff that you can munch on while in line. \n\nTheir stuff is just BEAUTIFUL. From the decor of the shop, to the carryout box (if you buy 6 or more pasteries), to the pastries themselves. Literally had a mini photoshoot after I came home. \n\nAnyways, what to get:\n\nStrawberry/Jalapeno brioche bomb (5 stars): AMAZING! So moist and filled, no overflowing, with this sweet and spicy jelly and topped with some sugar crumble to give it some crunch. Ate this while in line and was so sad when a clump of jelly fell to the ground. Definitely one of the best.\n\nChoux Bomb (4 stars): I don't know what flavor but this was a great pile of cream on moist shortbread textured scones? cookies?? Honestly, I thought it was going to be hazelnut/chocolate flavored and was disappointed when it wasn't - but still delicious for what it was.\n\nSugar coated donut (4 stars): Flavors of the day were peanut butter and lavender caramel. These donuts are literally oozing with filling. Forget taking the first bit to only get a mouthful of fluffy dough. The cavity in these is so large that there was too much filling for rest of the donut! The lavender caramel itself was too sweet and heavy for my personal taste though very uniquely flavored. My guess is some people might be turned off by it, but it was certainly different. \n\nCruffin (4 stars): Rocky Road was the flavor of the day. much like the donuts, these was stuffed fairly full with whatever filling they have. The rocky road happened to be chocolate pudding with some nut clusters and homemade marshmellows. I wished there was a little more \"oomph\" to it though, some of the cruffins were filled with almost pure chocolate pudding - nothing too special. The cruffin itself is flaky and coated in sugar. But it doesn't quite have the buttery fluffiness of a croissant since it's baked - comes out more like a danish.\n\nWhile I wasn't blown away by the cruffin, I definitely think it's worth trying.

It's small, it's cramped, and the line is forced outside after no more than five or so people, but the warm and friendly service once you're inside will have you forgetting that you may have just spent 45 minutes of your morning waiting. Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\n$4.50 for a (huge) Cruffin and $3.50 for a (smaller) standard donut. These prices are more than fair considering these are the definition of specialty goods in what is a very expensive city. Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nWow. Okay. Let's start with the Cruffin, which was seriously amazing. The flavor of the day this Saturday was Peppermint, which really kicked my holiday spirit into overdrive, and the flaky croissanty exterior blended perfectly with the smooth peppermint custard. Delicious. \n\nWhile I didn't think it could get any better, the Salted Caramel Donut very honestly put the Cruffin on the back burner. This would have been a flawless donut if it were empty on the inside, but the salted caramel was sensational, and was the take away of the day as I see it.

The choux puff was basically like a super huge cream puff filled with a delicious hazelnut cream. Tasted like an oversized Ferrero Rocher truffle in cream puff form. The hazelnut flavor was absolutely wonderful - I could eat that cream by itself everyday if I could.\n\nThe ube puff was one of the most unique pastries I've ever tasted, but it was a wonderful party in my mouth. I love yams in general, and the purple yam filling was great because it had the yam taste without being too sweet. The prickly pear icing was sweet and tart and perfect accompaniment to the purple yam.\n\nBut the star of the show... the CRUFFINS were the best things I've ever tasted. The flavor of the day was chocolate earl grey, and the filling was so amazing - not too sweet with the perfect hint of tea from the earl grey.

We got here around 8:45am and received a pink sticker with their peace sign logo shortly after. Each sticker guarantees two cruffins per person. While the bf stayed in line, I wandered into the bake shop to get some of their other good looking pastries. And of course, we dived into them in the 15 minute window before the cruffins come out. \n\nThe Kouign Amann had a great texture. Super crisp and flaky, however, the flavor of pistachio in this pastry was a bit lacking. \n\nThe California croissant was also extremely flaky but a bit softer than the Kouign Amann. What makes this a standout was the filling! This croissant was filled with smoked salmon, seaweed and wasabi. This combination was unique and quite tasty. I just wish they had more of the filling than just one little dollop in the center.The packet of soy sauce on the side was a cute touch. We didn't get a chance to pair with the soy sauce since that would make a mess. \n\nFinally, the cruffins! The cruffins for the weekend was peppermint. Normally I am not a fan of peppermint, but this was yummy! The peppermint flavor was pleasant and the pastry had just the right sweetness! I love how the cream was filled evenly throughout giving the perfect bite of flaky and creamy each time. \n\nWish they reheated the pastries and also maybe leave a trash can outside for those who can't wait to eat them!", "author": "Eva I."}

Fantastic for breakfast along with their chocolate cruffin.

I mean, who could resists taking a picture of your beautiful croissant under the \"I got baked in San Francisco\" sign?\n\nI did enjoy their pastries but nothing for me stood out. The pastries are also REALLY good fresh so enjoy them as soon as you can. I didn't get to try their famous cruffins but I did get to try a number of their other pastries. They were all enjoyable. Their croissants had a nice buttery, flaky texture. Their bread was soft and fluffy. Nothing was overly sweet so I really enjoyed that. My favorite that I tried was their strawberry jalapeno danish. It was sweet, creamy, fruity, with a hint of spicy from the jalapeno. It was such a nice blend of sweet and savory.\n\nMake sure you get a box since the box has their signature design on it but you do have to get 6 or more pastries. The shop itself is small. There's enough room to line up and take a picture against the wall with the sign. You can almost miss this shop but all you have to do is look for the store with the neon pink sign inside. Their logo across the door almost looks like graffiti which makes the store blend in even more with all the other stores.\n\nMaybe one of these days, I will wait in line for the cruffins or more likely I would bribe someone to get these for me.", "author": "Jennifer H."}

It was pretty timid and we managed to make it in before the cruffins ran out, buuut I'm pretty sure everyone that arrived after us was not as lucky. There's very short optimal time period during which you can seize one of these vessels of flaky, baked goodness. The flavor I had was hot toddy: whiskey and lime. Gotta say it was worth the wait. The pastry was flaky yet soft and just the right amount of chewy. The filling was a lot nicer than I thought it would be since I don't particularly like pastries with alcohol. The bottom of the cruffin was my favorite part of the whole thing. The donuts are solid and they have a good variety of other pastries too. I downed a cruffin here then walked over to Jane on Larkin for a coffee to balance out the sugar rush. You should definitely check this place out if you are in the area.\n\nThings you should know:\n- 2 cruffin limit per person.\n- Things sell out quickly so get there early.\n- Caveat for the prior statement because cruffins are only brought out at 9:00 am.\n- The line is relentless on certain days.", "author": "Lakshmi M."}

But no biggie, that's what 2 minutes in the toaster oven is for.\n\nEarl grey cruffin. The cruffin, at its core, is a solid croissant that maintains its light butteriness, even 2 days old. What elevates the croissant to a cruffin is the cream filling, perfectly imbued with Earl grey flavor, purposefully portioned to occupy a considerable portion of the pastry, and thankfully devoid of that waxiness that leaves your mouth with a film coating. The muffin shape lends to better distribution of cream filling since regular croissants have bottom-heavy fillings and very spacious, lacking tops. The delicate coating in powdered sugar, which makes it seem like a donut, is the icing on the cake. Or the sugar on the cruffin, I should say. Albeit the uneven playing field, the cruffin is much tastier than Paris Baguette's \"cronut.\" This pastry is worth your money.\n\nCalifornia croissant. Just like the cruffin, the croissant was solid but not the star of the show. This pastry was elevated by its tiny filling of smoked salmon wrapped in seaweed. The wasabi, though present, wasn't overpowering (and I'm very sensitive to wasabi). Didn't use the soy sauce, didn't think it needed the soy sauce. Would have preferred more salmon, but who wouldn't.\n\nSavory brioche bomb with red Thai pumpkin curry. The taste of the brioche was definitely affected by being \"stale\" as the dough was a bit tough. The curry flavor was concentrated only in the middle, leaving the remaining 85% of the pastry as an underwhelming, airy cheese bagel.\n\nBut, no time to dwell on the past.

Other baked foods are alright but not stellar\n\nI came here twice on a mission to secure cruffins as a gift for my brother and his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nThe first time, I foolishly came too late in the day and they were sold out. This seemed strange to me since only a few months ago I was at Dominique Ansel in NYC, and there is no longer a wait for cronuts and they were still available at 3 in the afternoon on a weekend. This indicates to me that the supply is artificially limited (as was the case for cronuts a while ago)\n\nTo get a pair of cruffins, I showed up at 830 on a Monday morning and was the front of the line. If you think a 30 minute wait doesnt sound too bad, you have not yet been disappointed by a cruffin. It has the vague flavor of a croissant, but without the airiness as the layers are all jammed together to fit a muffin mold (the cronut avoids this problem by proofing and frying without any constraining molds). \n\nI also sampled a few other goods, which were a bit tasty but not all that unique or memorable. Props to Holmes for some creative attempts, but I'm wary that they are just cashing in on a food trend, and not actually delivering the same kind of creativity you see in all the baked foods at a place like Dominique Ansel, and not executing classic techniques at the level of a place like Tartine.", "author": "Neal B."}

As one very helpful employee told us, the strategy here is that after you get a ticket showing that you are in the cruffin line (2 cruffins per person), have someone in your group go in the other pastry line, which usually has way less people at this point. That way, you'll get everything at the same time!\n\nI only got the cruffin when I went. It was fruity pebbles flavor (flavors change weekly) and it was GREAT.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-13", "description": "After trying the infamous cruffin a few months ago, I finally got to try some of Mr Holmes' other baked goods. I'm still not convinced that the cruffin is worth the ridiculous wait, but it's worth a visit for some of the other items. Honestly, most things still weren't particularly special in my opinion and Mr Holmes is really 3-3.5 stars to me, but the REUBEN DANISH itself bumps it up to 4 stars. Savory pastries don't appeal to most people like sweet pastries do, but I'm definitely more a fan of their savory items.\n\n* REUBEN DANISH ($4.50) - 5/5\n[pastrami, thousand island, house fermented sauerkraut]\nNot gonna lie, a pastry with pastrami and bright purple sauerkraut seemed pretty iffy to me at first, but I love savory things so I gave it a try anyway and I'm so glad I did. It may sound disgusting but man it's AMAZING. Super savory and balanced very well. Pastrami's not too salty, sauerkraut's not too strong and there isn't too much thousand island. And the danish part is perfectly flaky and crispy\n\n* KOUIGN AMANN ($3.50) - 4/5\nCrispy, buttery and flaky with a nice, not-too-sweet filling\n\n* CROISSANT ($3.50) - 3.5/5\nSuper buttery and flaky when completely fresh, but the croissants lose their crisp and become softer, kind of like Costco croissants. They're good and big in size, but are they worth $3.50? I don't think I can agree with that.. A Costco croissant will do the trick for much less.\n\n* DONUT ($3.50) - 3.5/5\n[pumpkin spice]\nAs far as donuts go, theirs are pretty good - airy, fluffy and filled with a good amount of filling. For anyone who likes pumpkin flavored things, the pumpkin spice actually tastes like it, and for anyone like me who isn't really into sweet pastries, the pumpkin spice at least isn't overly sweet or rich/creamy (can't say if other flavors are the same)\n\n* SAVORY BRIOCHE BOMB ($4) - 3.5/5\n[red thai pumpkin curry]\nBasically a soft, fluffy but pretty plain and average brioche bun topped with pumpkin pur\u00e9e and shredded coconut. I liked the pumpkin (had a slight kick to it), but there was too much brioche and not enough pumpkin.\n\n* CRUFFIN - 3.5/5\n[smores]\nFrom my original review - I thought a cruffin would actually be some cross between a croissant and muffin in texture, but it's really just a croissant (buttery and flaky like everything else) shaped like a muffin, overly stuffed with a sweet, creamy filling. Too much filling and too little pastry in my opinion", "author": "Jessie L."}

I'll admit that I'm a huge savory person so I LOVED the California croissant and the danishes the most compared to the sweets I purchased.

This isn't the only thing they're known for, their cruffins are their most well known pastry. The variety is limited since they sell out super quick. I got one cruffin(coconut rum was the flavor of the day), sweet danish(persimmon), and a donut(coffee). The lady that grabbed the pastries was super sweet, she answered my questions and telling me which was most popular. The total for me was $12.00 for three pastries. I think you really get what you pay for because the pastries were so fluffy and crispy. It was still warm too when I took a bite.

My friends and I came around 8:15 and waited in line. They start passing out a pink sticker guaranteeing you two cruffins. (limit 2 p/person) The cruffins comes out at 9:00 but the bakehouse opened at 8:00 when I went. Thankfully we found parking and it was free Sundays! \n\nYesterday's Cruffin flavor was Birthday Cake - celebrating their one year anniversary. Congrats & Happy Birthday btw. I can see why they are doing sooo well!! Honestly, I dont know how I feel about the cruffins. For sure, the presentation is beautiful. They were AMAZING, but at the same time there were some parts there were meh. My first bite was meh but once I reached the center were the cream filling was I was BLOWN AWAY. The filling was rich and creamy. The cake on top was super moist and spongy! Kind of messy to eat, but it's worth it! If you were to ask me Cronut or Cruffin, i'd still choose Cronuts though! I really wish I tried the Matcha Cruffin on Saturday, I think I would've liked that a lot better! I'll be back!\n\nAlso, I tried their California Crossaint... It was good until I reached the wasabi...I really wish there weren't any wasabi, because it seriously ruined it all :( but if ya'll love wasabi, salmon, and nori seaweed this would be good.\n\nI heard they're actually coming to LA, soooo I'm pretty excited for that!", "author": "Michelle Y."}

So you're in a bar, and you want to hit the bathroom - but you're a lady, so there's a huge line. But then you look over, and see an opening: it looks like the men's room is unoccupied. Now of course, there's always the possibility that when you come out you'll get the awkward look of disapproval, and ideally you'd use the women's bathroom, but you know what? Sometimes you don't want to wait in line. And there ends one of the worst metaphors I've ever written. \n\nSo at MHB, as the locals probably don't call it, I ate the second best cookie I've ever had. Shout out to Levain in NYC for #1, but this guy really stood its own as a fantastic chocolate chip creation that left me legitimately sad when it ended. And the best part? You only have to wait in the short line, not the insane one for the Croissuffin, as the locals likely don't call it. The line for the Muffsant, as the locals definitely don't refer to it, starts hours before the place starts serving them and typically will cost you an hour that you could otherwise spend climbing random hills around town or designing a new app or whatever people do. \n\nI'm not proud of comparing the Croissuffant, as the locals undoubtedly do not call it, to the long line for a women's bathroom at a bar.

Girlfriend and I went pretty hard, copping the max 2 cruffins per person, along with 3 of each type of donut, a caramel sticky bun, chocolate kouign amann, and an ube puff. We were surprised to see that ube puff last minute. Needless to say, instacop. The daily flavor for cruffins was blueberry cheesecake; and donuts were cranberry orange and spiced chocolate. \n\nYou know how sometimes you see pastries that look good, until you take a bite and are disappointed by a dense, stale, flavorless baked mass of dough? None of that business here. Everything we had was delicious. Pastries were light, buttery, and flaky. Fillings were tasty - not too sweet, as my mom and her sisters would say. If you're a fan of pastries, definitely come here. Highly recommended. \n\nProtip: Cruffin flavors change daily. Peep their website or social media beforehand to see what's on the menu for the day.

Well, that was my original intention, but I couldn't because I really wanted to try the famous cruffin ($4.50 a pop). Thus, I was only able to purchase only that particular pastry on the day of my visit. Once you're in the cruffin line, you can't purchase any other of their other pastries. \n\nThere are two long lines: the cruffin line (limit 2 cruffins per person) and misc. pastry line. \n\nI dragged my trooper of a mister here with me, so that I could get four cruffins, which I inhaled and I subsequently regretted doing so. Ugh, four sugary cruffins to myself, never again. \n\n+ In order to get the cruffin on a weekend, you have to line up right when this bakery opens at 8 am. Though these bad boys are ready to order at 9 am, don't wait to line closer to 9 am, because they're limited and the lines get long! Once you're in line, you're not even guaranteed to get one. You need to obtain the pink sticker, which is essentially your golden ticket to the damn cruffin. \n\n+ Cruffin flavors vary each day. I got to try the Chocolate Hazelnut Cruffin, which had a pleasantly golden crisp exterior, a buttery, fluffy center, and an ample amount of chocolate mousse filling. \n\nOverall, I don't get the cruffin hype.

I had been plotting my trip to this place to grab one of those infamous cruffins everyone has been raging about. I figured that a Friday would be the perfect day to go: tourists may not be in town/willing to get up that early, and the locals are at work. So I sauntered on down to this place with the doggies a little after 8am, and as luck would have it, there was no line!

Literally 5 minutes later, the line started to grow (although by no means as bad as on the weekends). \n\nNow let me get to the good stuff (pun intended). That cruffin! The flavor was chocolate toffee (which they post on their Instagram page, btw. And no, you don't need an Instagram account to see it). It's a croissant in the shape of a muffin, that's dusted with powdered sugar, and then filled with a daily flavor. What I liked most about this treat is that it wasn't too sweet. It was the perfect croissant:cream:sugar ratio. I told myself I would only take a couple bites, but the next thing I know, it's gone! So I guess I ate it. And loved every minute of it!!!\n\nI also couldn't resist the ferrero rocher choux bomb (then again, I can't resist anything ferrero rocher-like). Again, deliciousness!!!!

Get one or two, or hell get all three that come out!  \n\n+ Location: (boarderline) Tenderloin and Nob Hill +\nThe bakehouse is pretty darn small, so you might miss it along Larkin St.  It is what it is... A room-sized bakery with a glass display of pastries galore.  \n\n++ Gettin' down to business ++\nThey do open early, but if you arrive at 8:30am, you may notice a long line of people waiting to get their hands on some cruffins.  What are cruffins?  You'll find out.  They start offering them at 9am, but note that you can still bypass the long arse line if you only intend on buying their other goodies.  \n\n+++ Now for MY GOODIES, not yours, MINE +++\n~ Maple Almond Bostock ($4.50):  Hmm, this was different!  Kinda like a monkey bread baked in a square shape, and sliced big like a piece of Texas toast only way bigger.  Or better yet, more like an almond croissant threw up on top of sweet bread, mmm!  I ate half (only because I wanted to try all my other pastries), then toaster-oven'd the leftover slice and loved the sugar rush all over again!  It's gotta be the moist buttery almond paste taste with that slightly crisp maple top! \n\n~ Savory Danishes ($4.50):  \n1)  Mushroom danish, first bite... Dude!  I didn't know these were like quickly sauteed and peppered.  One bite and I couldn't stop biting.  Much recommended.  Next...\n2)  Grilled onions danish, first bit... Holy sweet Jesus, even better than the mushroom danish!  Really really really recommended!  Engulfed, next...\n3)  Artichoke cheese danish, first bite... Mmm, mmm, mmm, I never knew baked artichoke could be so good with some cheese chunks!  And I believe it was feta too, imagine that!\n4)  Bacon danish, first bite...  Ah, ok, seems like something I've made before.  Good, but surprisingly not my favorite.  \n~~ Now I ate them in this order expecting thinking it was worst to best, only it ended up the other way around.  Can't go wrong with ordering any of these!\n\n++++ CRUFFIN ALERT!!! ++++\n~ Green Tea Strawberry Matcha Cruffin ($4.50):  OK, after 35 minutes of waiting, here's what I think....\nCrusty, buttery, sugar everywhere, green tea matcha strawberry filling that was nice'n'cool, flakey, and everything you've ever wanted!  I liked it, but sorry, it wasn't worth my time.  Why?  Because the Ferrero Rocher Choux Bomb and the cream filled donuts were EVEN BETTER, imo of course!\n\n~~ Lets start with the Ferrero Rocher Choux Bomb ($3.50):  HEAVAN! Yes with an \"A\"!  I was fortunate to grab one of these as they came out.  Not to mention, I was already paying at the register.  If you're an almond lover, caramel lover, cream puff lover, then this is for you!  Words cannot describe this dainty piece of hmm heavan!  Just like a freshly baked Ferrero Rocher itself, only life-sized!  Whatever that's supposed to mean!   \n\n~ And finally, the Cream/custard-filled Le Donuts ($3.50):  Three reasons why they tasted so good!\n1)  Tempted to buy all three varieties, I just went with the Peanut Butter-Chocolate which was just oozing with what seamed like a firm chocolate mousse.  Reason number one as to why I think Mr Holmes makes some of the BEST EVER donuts! \n2)  Next, I had the Orange Creamsicle, and DAMN!  Never new life could be so good...  The fact that the custard was cold, and it really taste like an orange ice cream bar justified reason number two.  But my #1 favorite item of everything here.  I can eat a whole box of these!   \n3)  No mess as you bite and lick, but both donuts simply had an aroma that makes you wanna devour it in one bite.  The donut itself was crisp and sugary on the outside;  Made that way it should be.  I can smell them now!  \n\nI can only imagine how that passionfruit donut taste and smells... \n\n+++++ Overall +++++\n~ It's been a while since I've written a review this long, that's how good it is.\n~ Oh yeah, and service.  No issues as the girls moved quickly and tried to be efficient.\n~ Pricing:  eek, I've never spent $50+ on pastries before, but it was worth it!\n~ 5-stars!  Eat it!  Try it!  Loved it!

I am a huge fan of bakeries and whenever I travel, I try to visit as many as I can ( I love my carbs!) Looking at other reviews on Yelp and blog posts, there was two things I had to be aware of: one, the long line ups and two, the cruffin! I was dedicated to coming early because when I went to Dominique Ansel in New York I missed out on the cronuts by 15 minutes -_-.\n\nI arrived at around 9:15 and there was already a line outside the door! It took me around twenty minutes to go in, but oh boy you can smell the sweet aroma of the pastries outside the door. I would've loved to get a box, but you had to order a minimum of six items. Unfortunately, I was by myself so there was no point of me getting all of that. \n\nThe first thing I saw was rows and rows of beautiful cruffins. That day, the flavour was Reese Peanut Butter, I believe they change up their flavours everyday and they put these on their Instagram page. They looked so flaky and crispy so I definitely snagged one of those. Don't just settle for their cruffins, they have a lot more amazing pastries too! They had donuts, croissants, cookies, and savoury tarts as well! I ordered the Bacon and Leek tart.\n\nThe Bacon and Leek Tart was hands down my favourite. It was so flaky and there was a ton of filling inside it too! The chunks of cooked onions and bacon was the perfect combination. I'm not a huge fan of overly sweet items but the cruffin was delicious. You can definitely split it amongst two people because these things were huge! They are quite messy when you eat it, so get those napkins ready.

They have 1 flavor for the cruffin and 2 flavors for the stuffed donuts each day.  I took a gamble that it wouldn't be coffee and was pleasantly surprised that it was lemon meringue pie that day.  \n\nTip #2:  If you are facing the storefront, the cruffin line is to the left and the regular pastry line is to the right.  There is a pink sign notating that but when you jump out of the car like I did, I automatically just lined up where I saw the line.  Luckily, 5 minutes later at 8AM, I noticed my line was moving so realized I was in the wrong one and was still able to be near the front of the correct line.  \n\nTip #3 - If you can come with a second person, one person can get some pastries to munch on while you are waiting for those cruffins.  They start handing out stickers around 10 minutes before 9 so make sure to be back in line before then if you want to maximize the cruffin allocation!\n\nSo I got 1 chocolate pistachio donut and a California Croissant to tie us over in line.  I had salmon baklava as an app before during dinner at Saha which coincidentally is pretty close by as well and absolutely love it.  It takes the sweet and savory to a whole new level and I loved it!!  So we decided to take a chance and try the California Croissant which has salmon in it as well.  It is salty enough that it did not require the soy sauce pack that comes with it and was tasty but did not knock my socks off.  I had the chocolate pistachio donut later in the day and the density of it reminded us of a malasada.  I thought I would like it more than I did.  \n\nThe cruffins on the other hand, yum and worth that hour wait!!  Each person is allowed 2 so we got the max.  Dusted with sugar on the outside, followed by light flaky layers and then ending with the not overly sweet filling was a perfectly balanced treat any time of the day making it 5 stars!!", "author": "Joyce Z."}

So, we actually ended up being the 1st ones in line for cruffins. \n\nThe cruffins were supposed to come out at 9AM, but they actually took 10-15 mins more to finally be ready. The flavor that day was Almond Joy. \n\nI ended up getting 2 Almond Joy cruffins, 2 chai donuts, 2 pineapple donuts, 2 Ferrero Rocher choux bombs, and 2 cruffin bread puddings.\n\nIt being my first time here, I was most excited about the cruffin of course. Although I'm not the biggest fan of coconut, I'm glad that the Almond Joy cruffin wasn't full of coconut. It was sweet and creamy. It also was hard to finish because of the filling. So, I was only able to eat half of it. \n\nI thought that the Ferrero Rocher choux bomb was ok. It did have the signature Ferrero chocolate hazelnut taste. But, I felt like it was overly sweet. \n\nThe donuts and cruffin bread pudding were devoured by my family and they really enjoyed them. So, I'll definitely have to get more of those next time. \n\nOverall, I would say that the cruffins are worth the wait (depending on flavor). I think I would've enjoyed mine more if I was able to try a flavor that I actually liked. But, nonetheless, the concept is great.\n\nI hope to come back and try a better cruffin flavor and a savory Danish because my friend had the artichoke one and said that it was really good!\n\nFor all my pastries and the reusable tote bag  that I bought, I spent almost $60.", "author": "Fallon P."}

It is a really cute small bakery with white bricks that gives off a hip and modern look. It has a neon light against the wall that writes, \"I GOT BAKED IN SAN FRANCISCO.\" \n\n2. Food: We ordered the Chocolate Croissant, Cruffins, and Choux Bomb. Everything was made fresh and an astute person would order everything mentioned and more. I have nothing to scrutinize this bakery as everything was perfectly baked to perfection in all its entirety. \n\nThe Chocolate Croissants were fluffy and buttery with melted chocolate pieces stuffed inside. The cruffins, I had discovered, were fluffy croissants made in a muffin shape with fillers inside. \n\nEvery day, there is a different flavor of cruffins and this particular day was salted caramel & toffee. It was sweet, fluffy and creamy, and definitely worth a try. \n\nHands down to the Choux Bomb. I had placed it in the fridge so it was cold and wow, it was amazing. It consists of almond roca cream inside the buttery pastry. It tastes like you're eating delicious cold cream mousse with a buttery crunch. So worth the calories!\n\n3. Service: For the cruffins, there was a line. My friend and I waited in line for 30 minutes starting at 8:00 a.m. and we were the 9th person there. We received a sticker each, which grants us two cruffins per person. There is a separate line for cruffins checkout. Furthermore, if you do decide to to get more pastries that are not cruffins, you can jump to the regular service line and order. Service was fast and friendly. Great group of workers that offered wonderful customer service.\n\n4. Costs: Cruffins are $4.50 a piece. Most of the items are under $5.00. It's worth it and the portions are a good size. \n\n5. Overall Experience: Besides the long line, which they have no control over, the experience was great. I enjoyed the pastries and they have a nice checkout system, which made the process of paying fast and swiftly. I am grateful that there weren't any inclement weathers that would affect the process of acquiring some delicious baked goods. \n\nSide Notes: Go early to beat the crowd.", "author": "Chau P."}

They open at 7 for their regular, delicious, pastries. \n- California croissant: buttery, flaky, croissant filled with smoked salmon, wasabi, ginger and seaweed. \n- regular croissants. \n- filled donuts. (I bought one flavor each that day which were passion fruit and strawberry).\nAnd other baked goods. \n\nI originally came here for their \"I got baked in San Francisco\" totes ($12), but after seeing the filled donuts, I had to grab a box full of goodies. Fill a box with 6 pastries and the box is free, anything less than 6 goodies in a box will automatically be $1.50 charge for the box itself. But hey, the box itself is just too gorgeous to pass up.\n\nCruffin's make their appearance at 9AM everyday so make sure you get in line beforehand ! We lined up around 8:30ish and the line wasn't bad at all but that's because it's a week day so yay! Lucky us ! It took about only 5ish minutes top to get in and grab the cruffins. \n\nSo just to cut this review short because what really matters is: is this place worth going to? YES. Was this place worth me waking up at 3:30AM to get ready, drive from concord to San Francisco, stop by a Starbucks, kill some time at Jane's, and wait in a line with other eager people waiting for cruffins? Damn right it was worth it ! \n\nOTHER DEETS:\n- parking is street parking so definitely come earlier to find a good spot. It was a Thursday and the meter's start charging at 9AM.\n- inside Mr. Holmes is cramp so if you're trying to take a photo, be prepared that it won't come out exactly as you'd want it ! \n- their doors open at 7AM for their regular pastries.\n- 9AM Cruffin appearance so line up at 8:30 or even earlier ! \n- $1.50 per Mr. Holmes goodie box. \n- buy 6 pastries and the box is free. \n- $12 \"I got baked in San Francisco\" tote. \n- they take card and cash.\n- sadly, 2 cruffins per customer. \n- cruffin flavors aren't guaranteed to be the same flavor the next day. \n- cruffins: $4.50 a piece.", "author": "Grace Anne D."}

The star of many social media photos... And the destination following a sometimes lengthy wait...\n\nWe showed up around 8:45 AM on a Friday morning and there were already 10-15 people in line. And once it hit 9:00 AM, the line moved really quickly. We got all our stuff and were out the door by approximately 9:15. The nice thing is that there is no wait for pastries besides the cruffins, so you can head on in and skip the line if that's the case. Buuut I can see why there's no line for the pastries. \n\nFOOD RECOMMENDATIONS\n+++ CRUFFINS: Where else are you going to get a cruffin... Nowhere. So yes, the wait is definitely worth it on a WEEKDAY. The lines aren't that crazy so do yourself a favor and come on a weekday. They post the daily flavors for their cruffins and donuts on their Facebook & Instagram, so keep an eye out for that. I thought double cherry would be a weird flavor for a cruffin, but boy was i wrong. Everything about the cruffin is tasty!\n+++ CALIFORNIA CROISSANT: I loooove salty/savory breads (from asian bakeries), so this was easily my favorite pastry besides the cruffin. Smoked salmon, ginger, wasabi and nori wrapped in a croissant... Sounds weird, I know. But the flavors worked surprisingly well and the ginger and wasabi was not overpowering at all. \n\nAND THE NOT SO GOOD ONES... \n- COOKIE: It's a huge cookie for $3. Sea salt and chocolate sound like a good combination, but I just found this cookie to be a little too salty. I like salty and sweet, but this cookie just didn't have the balance between the two down. \n-- DONUTS: Got one of the passionfruit, pear, and flavor of the day: chocolate peanut butter. It's just a standard sugar donut with a little too much of extremely sweet filling. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't amazing.\n-- FERRERO ROCHER CHOUX BOMB: Meh...

The chocolate flavor was subtle because it's all chocolate chips while the cream filling was still in its perfect custard form.   I appreciate how it wasn't overwhelm fly sweet and as usual, the pastry dough part was sweet, buttery and flakey.  Love it so much! All of it! I think we snagged up the last cruffins of the day.\n\nSAVORY DANISH - MUSHROOM - $4\nI never imagined a Danish to have while mushrooms before and I enjoyed it!  There was some cheese and there was some white gravy/sauce embedded under the Rosemary flavored mushrooms.  All this was baked on top of a flaky Danish that reminded me of a really good croissant.  I really enjoyed this one! \n\nPEAR DANISH - $4\nThis sweet Danish was pretty straight forward.  There was sweet pear and a bit of custard between the sliced fruit and pastry dough.

I came here on two separate occasions and got different items each time. The first time I stopped by on a Friday around 1:30pm, and there was no line at the time. Of course, they had sold out of the cruffins a few hours ago. The second time I made the mistake of coming on New Year's Eve day, and there was already a super long line at 8:30am (you can start standing in line early but they only start selling the cruffins at 9am each morning). It's a maximum of 2 cruffins/person, so bring more people if you want to purchase more cruffins. Since we were so far back in the line they already sold out of the other cruffin flavor by the time we got to the front. They charge you for a box unless you purchase a minimum of 4-5 items. So far, I've tried:\n\n-Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie ($3.00): FREAKIN' DELICIOUS. This cookie was nice and chewy, and I loved the ratio of chocolate chip to salt- highly recommended!\n-From L to R: Salted Caramel Donut ($3.50), Chocolate Kouign Amann ($3.50), Sticky Bun ($4.50) [http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wZsK1NZzKCSNtyXFhbldPA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg]: The donut was just ok for me since the salted caramel was too sweet. The chocolate kouign amann was good, but nothing special. The sticky bun was my favorite out of the three, and nice and buttery- I would only get this one again.\n-Pomegranate Cruffin ($4.50, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qW6NAWfyLDDKqv8NYs-BOg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Just ok, and not worth the hype, although I think the pomegranate flavor had something to do with my disappointment- it was too tart for me.\n-Ube Puff ($4.50) & California Croissant ($5) [http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zgJD0CEdpkfZiQeEGcjqAQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg]: Just ok; the prickly pear icing on top was too sweet and overpowered the taste of the ube filling. I wasn't a fan of the California Croissant- it was too weird to have salmon and pickled ginger inside of a croissant, in my opinion. I also though the croissant was dry, and not at all flaky.\n-Choux Bomb ($4, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tFHdtVpPp07BBoZcLW1Aig&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum, delicious!! i love the piece of caramel inside, and the custard was creamy and smooth- recommended!\n-Donut ($3.50 each): I didn't like the Orange Cream flavor (too orange-y and flowery tasting), but the Earl Gray was good. The jam filled was too tart and I didn't like it. \n\nI would definitely come back for more cruffins and cross my fingers it wasn't the pomegranate flavor that day, but not sure I would stand in line for a couple hours again to get it. They don't always run out of cruffins right away, and it really depends on the day, so worth it to call ahead and check if you're in the area. I will also be back for the salted chocolate chip cookie (amazing) and to try their other items. Parking in this area can be difficult, but there is street parking available.", "author": "Amy D."}

The prices here are ridiculous and the pastries aren't that much to rave about. I got one of each flavor for the donuts (mint chocolate, peach, and something mascarpone... I forgot the exact name of the flavor) and a Ube pop tart. Each donut was almost $4 and the pop tart was $4 as well. I wish I could've gotten a cruffin because the day I went they had a brownie flavor. I was also hoping they were gonna have their matcha flavored donut, but that's okay. I think my favorite was the mint chocolate because it had a well balanced mint to chocolate flavor ratio. I was impressed with that flavor. \n\nThe shop was also smaller than I expected and it gets super crowded because everyone wants a picture in front of their famous sign. So you do wanna get here as early as possible to beat the lines, the crowd, and to get the parties you want.

Cruffins were filled with a coffee creme filling, I believe.  This was SOOOO good.  It was similar to a croissant with a crunchy exterior and a soft, flaky interior.  The creme added a perfect complement to the \"croissant/muffin\" part of the pastry.  A must try if you can here on a weekday.    \n\nI also tried the kouign amann.  In terms of texture, I thought it was very similar to the cruffin with a crunchy exterior and soft, flaky interior.  The main difference is that this one had a caramelized sugar glaze on the exterior and no creme inside.  Also, it wasn't shaped like a muffin.  This is also a very good pastry, but I did like the cruffin better.  \n\nI'm not sure I'd be willing to come here on a weekend and brave the long lines, but it was definitely worth a visit and well worth your time to see if you think the cruffin lives up to the hype.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-07", "description": "Mr Holmes has become one of the most IG'd bakeries in SF according to one article I just read. From their sleek white and gold boxes, the pink neon sign against the white subway tiled walls and the black and white tiled floor that reads \"Holmes Sweet Holmes\", Mr Holmes certainly seems to understand the marketing aspect in this business. \n\nI've said before that I won't wait up in a long queue for food and will leave that to the tourists but curiosity got the best of me after seeing countless photos of yet another pastry hybrid the cruffin. Like a sucker I eventually caved and had to get my hands on one of these. So we set the alarm clock to stand in line and headed out way too early on a Saturday morning for their much raved about cruffins. \n\nWe arrived at 8:30 as cruffins are served promptly at 9am. Upon arrival it was surprising to see the cruffin queue was already about 70 people deep. The other line had about 30. They make 150 single flavored cruffins a day and a sticker (the golden ticket) allows you to purchase 2 max. We walked out with $50 worth of pastries (we kinda over did it, no?) since we were going to make the time spent waiting here worth it.  \n\nSome notables:\n\ncruffins - I'm sure you're familiar with the cronut that took NYC in a whirlwind a couple years ago but these are croissant dough in a muffin shape (opposed to the donut shape) hence the name cruffin. It was flaky, sweet with a burned caramel type flavoring up top. I personally didn't care for the caramel as it was too sweet for me but it eventually erupted into yet another filling (chocolate custard?) towards the very center of the cruffin. I preferred the filling over the top caramel. \n\nchoux bombs - messy to eat, a tad too much filling but nevertheless they were delicious\n\nDonuts - a \"doughgroni\" (in celebration of Negroni Week) is a donut that accompanied vial of negroni to inject the pastry. We also had what I initially thought was vanilla custard filled donut but ended up being a citron flavored filling. Perhaps it's because I've been avoiding sugar as much as possible for the last two-three weeks however I found the fillings were much too sweet for my tastes. However the donut itself was perfection and this was for me the clear winner. I may be biased bc I am very partial to donuts. \n\nYou can't help but feel sorry for those who naively arrived later and stood in the cruffin line (particularly those who traveled from outside the city) after the stickers were already distributed. But they later found after overhearing others or checking their phones there is a daily limit on these things. Doing some research beforehand might have helped them avoid their rookie blunder. \n\nAs much as I liked this bakery and they have some very legit pastries the wait is just too much. I might be back but for me, I'll probably just wait in the non-cruffin line.", "author": "Esther A."}

This bakery was recommended by people both on and offline, and upon approaching the venue I knew by the wonderful smells of buttery baked pastries, that I knew I wouldn't be disappointed.\n\nIn New York City people are queuing up for Dominique Ansel's cronut, a hybrid between the croissant and the donut. But, over on the west side people are going gaga for Mr Holmes' cruffin, a fusion of a croissant and a muffin. At Mr Holmes the cruffins come out at 9am, but be sure to get there early as lines start even before opening and cruffins are limited to two per person. The flavours are posted on Instagram beforehand, so if there is a flavour you're seeking you can check for updates.\n\nThat morning the flavour was Passionfruit, which luckily enough would have to be one of my favourite flavours! I did not have an original cronut to compare with, but the cruffin was worth the hype. The filling packed a fruity punch, while the croissant dough was flaky, buttery and slightly sugary.\n\nI also greedily grabbed a box of other goodies, but to be honest I forgot the names of all of them. However, I can tell you one of the standouts was the California Croissant, do yourself a favour and order one, you won't regret it. It's basically a croissant with smoked salmon, pickled ginger, nori and wasabi in the centre. A delicious savoury option topped with sesame seeds and served with a packet of soy sauce.\n\nDefinitely put this on your San Francisco list, and don't miss out on the cruffins!", "author": "Fran L."}

We rarely all have the same schedule, so I took advantage of it and crossed my fingers and prayed to the Cruffin Gods for the latter. We passed the shop at about 5 after 8 and saw about 2-3 people in line. (YESS!!) In the no more than 10 min it took to find parking, unload my sleepy family, and walk over, there were about 15 people in line ahead of us.  If you're serious on getting your hands on a Cruffin, plan to get in line between 8-8:15 am.\nThis morning's flavor was Banana's Fosters.  The chocoholic in me was hoping for something more decadent, but I was still excited to try it out.  We waited it out, keeping the kids busy with iPhones, as the line grew and grew behind us. I can't count how many times I heard people pass by and say, \"This line is ridiculous!\"  But I knew deep down inside, they were all just kicking themselves for not getting up earlier! Before you knew it the line began moving.  We made it to the counter of the tiny shop and were allowed 2 Cruffins per person.  You better believe we took full advantage and purchased 8 (to share with family of course).  We also somehow managed to fill up 2 additional boxes with other goods, and spent way more than I care to admit.  Here are the takeaways from our purchase:\n\n**Banana Foster's Cruffin-- SOO Yummy!  Did not even remember I was hoping for something chocolate.  Croissant was slightly sweet, with just the right balance of buttery-ness to flakey-ness.  Filling was a deliciously creamy banana custard with real banana fruit pieces hidden in there.\n**Ube Puff-- Same well done pastry, filling was true to the Taro Root, and not overly sweetened or processed or \"purpled.\"\n**Bread Pudding-- Just okay.  Could have used a yummy sauce to go with it.\n**Choux Bomb-- (White Chocolate) My favorite next to the Cruffin.  Decadent and sweet, filled with a white chocolate pastry cream that was stacked to the heavens!  And the cutest piece of salted fudge tucked in there.\n\nI've heard through the grapevine that if you come on a weekday, you can likely show up at 9am and still get some Cruffins, no need to tough out the line.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-02", "description": "After months and months of obsessing over all of the pictures posted on social media of decadent, lavish pastries, I finally planned a day with the BF where I put my foot down and said \"WE ARE GOING HERE. Wake up at 7am. NO excuses!\"\nSo, as committed as I was, even though we woke up a bit late (30 minutes), we left and made our hour long journey to wait in line for the infamous Cruffin.\n\nLo and behold, when we got there (btw the area is in the TL if you didn't see that already, so be prepared to dodge poop and pee on the sidewalk), the line was already 20ish people long just for the cruffin--not bad for arriving close to Cruffin time, aka 9am!! While the bf waited in the cruffin line, I entered the storefront to grab some baked goodies ^__^ Once the cruffin line started at 9am, it took us about an hour before we walked out with 4 cruffins and several other baked goods, all in 2 of their recognizable boxes. HOORAY!! \n\nWHAT WE GOT:\n\n1) Doughnuts: Flavors of the day was nutella and lemon curd--the lemon curd was a lot more sour that I expected!! But it was nice because I think something sweeter would make the doughnut way too sweet. Nutella doughnut was good but not great. I love love love doughnuts, so there are a couple other doughnut shops that reign over these Holmies (I'm so lame ha!). Nonetheless, because of my love for doughnuts I'd probably get them again if/when they are different flavors!\n\n2) Amelie Aman: YES. DROOL. PLEASE. Give me another. One of my favorites actually! It's sweet, crispy, melt in your mouth, everything. Just try it.\n\n3) Blueberry brioche bun: this one was meh. EH. I had my sister try this as well and we weren't too impressed. A one time try was enough for me.\n\n4) California Croissant: If you want something savory, get this! Surprisingly, I enjoyed this one, even without the soy sauce they give with it...and my sister and the bf agreed too. Different, but good. \n\n5) Almond bostock: hmm this was pretty good! It's this pound-cake like toast thing with almond paste and sliced almonds on top. If you like almonds/almond-tasting things, you'll love this. For me, I felt it to be a bit too sweet--if there was a bit less sugar I'd be a completely happy camper (but maybe the sweetness thing is just me, I don't eat sweets very often so I don't think I'm accustomed to them)\n\n6) Ferrero Rocher Choux Bomb: A bit too sweet for me on this one too, I think there was just so much filling--maybe put half of it and it would be perfect. I loved the hazelnut taste in every bite though!\n\n7) THE CRUFFIN: Yes yes, everyone is going crazy over this. Well....it's basically a morning bun, but with an added twist/filling/flavor in the middle. As half croissant, half muffin, the presentation is always on point. I have to admit, I did a photo shoot with one of the cruffins.... ^__^ The cruffin of the day was smores--with a torched marshmallow on top!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-05-09", "description": "How To Mr. Holmes Bakehouse:\n- 7:30 - Arrive early. Bring a friend to be your partner in cruffiny crime. \n- There are two lines forming :: one for pastries at 8am, the other for cruffins at 9am. \n- Jump into the cruffin line - that pastry line will die down by 8:20, leaving plenty of pastries for your leisurely purchase once the pastry crowd has all filed in behind you in the cruffin line.\n- 8:30 - Leave your friend in the cruffin line to go make your/their pastry purchases. To get an awesomely-branded Mr. Holmes box that you'll convince yourself to upcycle to hold useless things on your bookshelf, you have to buy 6 pastries. Take your picture of the \"I got baked in San Francisco\" sign, because if you don't, were you even really there? Then get back in line to await your sticker.\n- 8:45ish - Stickers are handed out. A sticker guarantees you 2 cruffins. No sticker? Don't stomp home angry. Some folks just purchase one cruffin, so there is hope yet!\n- 9:00 - Buy your cruffins and go sit in a park or something and get baked, as they say.\n\nPro Tip: they apparently deliver and accept orders, so you could potentially just avoid all that. Just check out the website for details. (www.mrholmesbakehouse.com)\n\nPS - My favs were the Ube Puff, the Strawberry Jalepeno Brioche and the donuts. God, the donuts.", "author": "Amanda W."}

My friend and I arrived around noon and I was a bit confused when I went in. I only saw a few of the dulce de leche out and thought they were probably going to put out more pastries, so I only bought 2 for me and my friend to try. After paying and everything, I realized those were just what were left for the day and that they were going to be sold out soon. More people swarm in after me and it was sold out in like less than 5mins!\n\nSighhh so much regret for being stupid and just buying 2. The dulce de leche was SOOO GOOD. I thought it would be overly sweet, but it wasn't...like I could probably eat at least 3 of these one after another. Next time I know to 1. Go early in the morning and 2.

There are dozens of people already lined up\n2. There are two lines, one for the Cruffins and one for the rest of the baked goods\n\nWe didn't know which line was which so my boyfriend got in the first line we reached and I went to go check which was which. It ended up being that my boyfriend lined up in the normal line (to the right of the bakery) and I lined up in the Cruffin line (to the left of the bakery). \n\nAlthough the bakery was already open at 8:30, the cruffins aren't for sale until 9am. My boyfriend got to the front of his line fairly quickly; he probably waited around 20 minutes. Tip* If you do split up with your party make sure to look up what regular baked goods you want! Thankfully I had all of the yelp pictures to help me decide what I wanted as I was stuck in the Cruffin line. I asked him to get me a Banana Cream filled Donut, Amelie, 2 of the White Chocolate Rasberry Brioches, and a Ferrero Roche Brioche Bomb. \n\nMeanwhile, as it neared 9am, someone came out with cute pink stickers to pass out to the line - I think the amount of stickers indicate how many cruffins they have to sell so if you have a sticker, you're good to go. I was also able to get a sticker for my boyfriend too, who shortly after came back with 3 boxes of bake goods lol. \n\nWe got to the front of the line around 9:20am. Each person is limited to 2 cruffins each and on the day I went they were serving a Pecan Brownie Cruffin decorated with Gold Flakes (?). I forget... But, I do know that it was SO GOOD when I actually tasted it. It was nice and flakey, just like a croissant, but had a nice creamy chocolate filling and a sugary coating on the outside that made every bite so delicious! The inside of the bakery is small, but does the job. I also love the lit up sign that says \"I Got Baked in San Francisco\". \n\nAll in all, we waited about an hour for the Cruffins but it went by so fast that it didn't really feel like it was that long.

They sometimes sell out of everything by 11am or noon but otherwise they are open until 3ish.\n\nThe line for the Cruffins (croissant dough baked in a muffin tin and filled/topped with some different flavored cream and goodies daily) is usually long and starts around 8:15-8:30.  Cruffins come out at 9am and they only make a limited amount daily.  If you don't want Cruffins and just want other pastries, YOU CAN SKIP THE LINE!  They have two different donuts that are also filled with different things daily.  I think you can check what the daily offerings are via Twitter but I don't tweet so I just peek my head in and ask.\n\nThe sweet pastries are better than the savory in my opinion.  They cycle through things by season so you can't always get the same things (I love the Ube Puff and the Stollen, which is dipped in bacon fat and rolled in sugar, but both are now unavailable).  The kouign amann, the bostocks and the Ferrero Rocher hazelnut dipped croissants are favorites.\n\nMost of the people who work there are super nice and friendly and they sell coffee but I've never tried it.

It's more than an IG trend (even though it's great that it's IG worthy), as these pastries are pretty innovative. I don't know any other places that offer such interesting creations in the West Coast (Dominique Ansel, please come to Cali, specifically SF b/c I live here now) so I think it's worth the occasional splurge. I came on a Sunday to grab some treats for a coworker's upcoming birthday. R drove because we were out at dimsum at Mission Bay. Parking can be difficult to find,even though we got super lucky. Walking here can be a bit of a leery task too, since the trek here involves passing through somewhat less than pleasurable circumstances. Since we came in the afternoon, all the cruffins were sold out which was too bad because they had the syringes of port wine that day inserted into the cruffins, which R  was interested in trying. Either ways, I recommend their donuts. I like them more than the cruffins anyways. I ordered the raspberry and lychee. No lie, their lychee infused flavors always blow my mind. I had gotten their Jasmine Milk Tea and Lychee a while back in LA and it was SO GOOD. I got my coworker Chamomile Blueberry and Cardamon Peach Danishes, which she said was good. The thing about the pastries here is that they're not extremely sweet. R does not have a sweet tooth whatsoever but really liked the donuts I bought. The one thing I wish they would do is have a set flavor every day because I like certain flavors more (Jasmine Milk Tea!) and wish I can always purchase them whenever I pay a visit. Expect an average of $4/ pastry, pre-tax. If you buy half a dozen, you get a free box. If you don't want to buy that much, it's a $0.87 extra charge.", "author": "Michelle R."}

Funny enough though (since there is a separate line for cruffins and cruffins-only), there was no line for the other pastries. So since it's best to roll as a team with someone else, one of us stayed in line and the other went and got a box of the other goodies to take with us, plus a croissant to munch on with our coffee in line.\n\nCruffin line got going around 9am and probably around 9:15ish, a guy came out and was counting the line and told the lady in front of us, she was probably good, we were shaky and everyone behind us should leave. This is because each person can buy 2 cruffins (and most people do). We decided to stay in line and as it worked out, when we got to the front, the woman in front of us with her kid got only 3 instead of 4 because she was nice and so we got the very last cruffin! (As a side note, I think children shouldn't count as a person to get 2 more cruffins, but I saw a few people pull that one.)\n\nSo how was the cruffin? Not as good as the other pastries we got! The flavor (they only have one a day) was raspberry pistachio (I think), and I wasn't that into it. Wish it had been something more appealing to me like toffee or PB banana. The other treats we got were better I thought, and with no line, I'd go back for them instead. \n\n- Ferrero Rocher choux bomb - did taste just like a ferrero rocher, but too rich for me\n- Amelie amann - pretty good! not my favorite, but one of the group's favorite\n- Blueberry brioche bomb - good\n- Almond something square - the best!! my favorite! \n- Banana creme filled donut - good\n- Raspberry creme fille donut - less good", "author": "MaryKate M."}

And it's apparently limited to 2 cruffins per person.\n\n*although they have official closing times they close early if all the pastries are sold before then\n\n*you can call for pickup or delivery (but they may not always pick up the phone since it's busy). They may also have a $50 minimum from what I saw on their website (best to check yourself as I am not completely sure)\n\n1st visit: 7am on a weekday\n20 min wait and I arrived right when it opened . No cruffins(@9am) but still worth the wait.

Maybe I was lucky but they still had some available at that time, and there was no line! Lots of the pastries were gone but I managed to snag some. Of course, no cruffins left.

I wouldn't count on being this lucky again- not including Outsidelands, the festivals and county fairs in and out of the city probably kept them away from this bakehouse.\n\nThese pastries are now my new guilty pleasure, and snagging a cruffin is now my goal.

If you haven't heard (you already have) they're famous for their cruffins, the west coast response to the east coast cronut, and yes, they do live up the hype.\n\nThings to note:\n- First things first, you need to be able to get up early to even hope of getting your hands on this elusive pastry. They take them out of the oven at 9am, an hour after opening, but you best believe there's a line at least an hour before then so prepare accordingly.\n- They post the cruffin flavors a week in advanced (plus the donuts) on Instagram, so you may want to peep that to determine if it's worth the wait.\n- They have two lines, one for the cruffins and one for the other pastries (including their filled donuts which rotate flavors each day). If you come early enough, you can usually just go through the regular pastry line and lineup for the cruffins after.\n- They limit cruffin purchase to two per person.\n- They only offer those beautiful boxes if you buy 6 pastries or more; otherwise they charge.\n- It's a teeny shop so prepare to eat it elsewhere (and eat it immediately while the cruffin's still hot, makes such a difference I promise!) And yes, that also means you will struggle to get your neon light insta shot in frame.\n\nAs for the things I tried....\n- Lemon curd & milk chocolate donut: Loved loved loved the lemon curd donut. It had a lot of tartness but it was nicely balanced by the sugar covered dough. The milk chocolate donut was a more creamy flavor, rather than a ganache, and was pretty tasty as well.\n- THE CRUFFIN (strawberry rhubarb): warm beautiful buttery flaky goodness. Seriously, this thing is so messy from its sugar coating but you'll want to eat it right away. It's generously filled so don't worry about them skimping on that. It's also wonderfully crispy on the outside but soft and pillowy on the inside. It's more so a custard filled croissant in the shape of a muffin then anything else, but your perfect conception of it. Definitely worth trying at least once.\n\nI'll definitely be coming back to try their California Croissant (smoke salmon and seaweed in a flaky buttery crust, sign me up), as well as their Ube tart (it's sooooo fat).

To our (sort of) disappointment they don't even start selling cruffins until 9am, so there was no line. No matter...we peeped at their other pastries and knew we wouldn't be leaving empty-handed. Then the convincing lady behind the counter told us we could have a cute pastry box if we bought six. And to hell if we didn't get a box (for what...we were flying back soon... just an excuse to eat 6 pasties, that's what..)! \n\nI was so glad they had a few savory options. I got the turkey pesto danish for a hit of protein. My friend followed suit and got the potato leek danish. As for sweets, the lady told us about the pastry that was a cross between apple pie, cheesecake and french toast. Uh, excuse me? Throw it in the box! \n\nWe also got a famed choux bomb with vanilla bean pastry cream between two fluffy choux pastries with a hazelnut fudge surprise in the middle. The vanilla cream was...beyond words. These are best eaten right away in a messy, sticky manner. Another popular pastry was the kouign amann, which is a denser version of a croissant.

Cruffins are made daily and available at 9:00 a.m.  However, the limit is only 2/person. \n\nMy brother's gf bought my parents and I some delicious pastries from Mr. Holmes.  We were lucky to try the following:\n\nElvis Cruffin -  peanut butter and caramelized banana creme cruffin drizzled with honey.  Although I've seen PB and banana as a healthy snack, I've never actually tried it myself.  I wasn't sure if I'd be a fan, but I was.  It had the right amount of PB and banana where one didn't overpower the other.  The only thing \"muffin\" about this was the shape.  As far as texture, it's buttery, flaky, and covered in sugar, resembling a cronut.  \n\nAmelie Amann - Mr. Holmes version of the Kouign Amann.  It was flaky and buttery,  but doesn't compare to B. Patisserie's Kouign Amann as it was smaller and more dense. Still yummy though!\n\nCalifornia Croissant - This was our least favorite of the bunch.  It's a croissant stuffed sushi filled with smoked salmon, baked seaweed, wasabi and pickled ginger, and topped with furikake.  Although the croissant was flaky, the taste was unpleasant.  It had a muddy taste from all the different ingredient combinations.  I'd say it's definitely an acquired taste.  \n\nFerrero Rocher Choux Bomb - If you're a fan of Ferrero Rocher, you'll LOVE this pastry.  It was absolutely flaky and delicious.

Their cruffins are okay, nothing really special. I think the main reason why people are willing to line up for them and what makes Mr.Holmes unique is that they make a different flavor cruffin everyday. Otherwise, it's not worth waiting in line hella early and finding out that they ran out an hour or two after opening. \n\nThe pastries are eh. I think the only one I actually liked are the donuts and they change the flavors every now and then. But again, are they really worth $3.50 for one donut? Nope. My boyfriend got the croissant. He took one bite of it and was immediately disgusted. He threw it away 'cause it lacked texture and taste. He said he has had better at local coffee shops selling plain croissants. \n\nService is practically non-existent. The male worker with the glasses working on Saturday, April 9th needs to quit if he doesn't like his job. My boyfriend and I were waiting in the pastry line and we barely walked through the doors and he was practically yelling at us at what we wanted. Their pastries change so how are we supposed to know what we want right off the bat? Also, they need to add some kind of large menu either by the window so people waiting in line can see what they are selling that day or have a large menu posted on their wall behind the pastry counter. You have to like walk down the entire counter to see your options but you can't even walk 'cause there's always a freakin' line! \n\nAnd honestly, the cruffins are basically flavored croissants in my opinion. Nothing fancy. They don't even resemble muffins at all. The name throws you off a bit if you've never heard of the word before. \n\nI do not see myself coming back here.

So I checked their instagram for their weekly flavors for the cruffins and doughnuts and yelp for tips on what to do! This was one place I had to try!! and y'know get baked!\n\nMr. Holmes opens at 7AM and the cruffins start selling at 9AM.  From what I saw from other yelpers' reviews, ALWAYS GO EARLY SO THEY DON'T RUN OUT because they make about 200 cruffins a day or so. **They have a limit of 2 cruffins per person!** Arrived about 8:50AM and the line was about 2 doors down (not long at all apparently according to the frequent buyers). \n\nTook about 15 minutes for us to get to the front of the line, and I'm pretty sure the reason why it takes so long to get the pastries is because everyone stops to take pictures of all the pastries and take pics with the \"i got baked in SF\" sign because i know i was one of those people. \n\nMy friend and I thought that the box looked aesthetically pleasing so we bought enough cruffins and doughnuts to fill it & yes we still have the box! The daily cruffin flavor was Peach Tea and it was amazing. Right when you take it out of the box/bag, you can feel the crunch and the flakiness just like an actual croissant. I thought it was going to be too sweet but the inside was moist and chewy, filled with a tea creme and a small amount of peach to balance the flavors instead of it overpowering. A little messy to eat because of the sugar on the outside but nothing a little finger licking can't fix!\n\n(It was so good, I was able to get back in line for a second round of orders. YES THATS HOW SHORT THE LINE WAS!)\n\nWe also got the Green tea match doughnut and chocolate doughnut as well, and those were like XL doughnuts, so soft and puffy filled with cream! I'm surprised it didn't explode!\n\nThe only down side was having to wake up super early to get in line. I like my beauty sleep ):", "author": "Janise Q."}

We still got a chance to try a couple of delicious treats! \n\nWe ordered a guava citrus filled donut, and a shortbread mousse dessert thing! \n\nThe guava filled donut was AMAZING. I usually get sick when I eat donuts, and I've had a pretty good amount of donuts to notice, even if they're good quality donuts. But with Mr. Holmes, I was able to have a little more than half without even feeling the tiny bit queasy. I attribute that to the flufiness and lightness of the donut! It has a lot more air than your typical donut, which I liked a lot because it added to the fluff factor. The inside was super delicious too. It was sweet but also with a citrus tang, which was a perfect refreshing break from the sweetness of it all. Especially since there was sugar dusted on the outside too.\n\nThe mousse dessert was pretty good too! Too sweet for me to finish by myself. I could only have a bite after having the donut because it was kind of rich with the small cookie/shortbread and also the mousse and fudge on top. It was still really good though. My favorite part was the fudge on top!\n\nIf you plan on getting the cruffin, definitely get there early because they sell out fast.

Their croissants are delicious and super crunchy. LOVED the double baked croissant, although I wasn't the biggest fan of the custard and raspberry filling inside. I lucked out today because they had matcha cruffins :) I would say cruffin lives up to their hype! The filling inside reminds me of the creme used in Beard Papa's cream puffs, and the outsides is very crispy and flake :) But for $4+ for one and the wait, I probably won't be back anytime soon.

I got two of the orange earl gray cruffins and a California croissant. The cruffin was a bit dry and had a lot of flavored pudding inside which was a bit overwhelming. If I did it over, I'd only get one, two is just excessive for one person. The California croissant was a unique pastry, with a smoked salmon roll baked into a croissant. It was fun to try, but the combination was a little weird to me. I think I'd prefer to eat the roll and the croissant separately. \nFor those planning a visit on a weekday, I wouldn't be overly concerned about getting there early.

I got baked in San Francisco, but I must say that I baked too long and became a tad bit sunburnt! \n\nArrived around 9:50am and there was still a ton of cruffins left. The bakeshop opens at 7am, but they starts serving their cruffins at 9am. Most of the time, customers come about 30mins-1hr early and wait in line to get the cruffins. Also, make sure to check their instagram as they update the different flavors weekly. I asked one of the workers there what is the best time to get cruffins and he mentioned Monday-Wednesday will be your best bet. Plus, you won't have to wait in line! \n\nNow onto the actual baked goods.. \n\nCruffin (Chocolate Earl Grey): Super decadent! I think the chocolate was extremely rich, but you can still taste the earl grey. I can't imagine how someone could finish one because it is literally filled with cream & topped with sugar. As for the cruffin itself, it reminds me of a tough croissant shaped like a muffin. Not my favorite, but it looks esthetically pleasing. Depending on the flavor that day.. it could be a hit or miss. \n\nDoughnut (Coffee Rum): If you are a fan of cream, this is gonna be the one for you. Literally, it was 90% cream & 10% dough. I personally liked the dough, but the coffee rum wasn't my favorite. The rum flavor overpowered the coffee taste and was a bit too much cream for me. Like the cruffin, depending on the flavor.. it's a hit or miss.\n\nCookie: This cookie was the size of my head! Super big and my favorite frankly. I think what made the chocolate chip cookie so delicious was the sprinkle of sea salt. It allowed it to be this sweet & salty treat that I really liked. \n\nUbe Puff: Grown-up pop tart filled with ube. Absolutely delicious as well! I liked it a lot cause it was flaky and had a good amount of filling. I remember this was $4.50 though.. so pretty pricey.\n\nIn all, I think their well-known pastries don't live up to my expectations! I liked their other pastries, but for a bakery.. it is pretty darn expensive. I think everything ranges in the $3-4.50 range.

You need someone to stand in the pastry line while you stand in the cruffin line (or vice versa)\n-you also need a friend to pay the meter because metered parking does not start until 9am\n-you need a sticker to get a cruffin. 1 sticker=2 cruffins. 2 cruffin limit per person \n-stickers are passed out around 8:50ish\n-DO NOT LIMIT YOURSELF TO CRUFFINS. THERE ARE OTHER PASTRIES TO BE LOVED AS WELL (get the ube puff)\n-check their instagram for donut and cruffin flavors on certain days \n\n\nDear Mr. Holmes, can I meet you? Can I throw a bread themed all carb party that you can cater? Can you be my personal pastry chef? I was sure that the hype wasn't going to be real, but dammit these pastries got the best of me. After months of yelp-searching, I finally mustered up the craziness to go out and make the drive from SJ to SF at 6 in the morning so I could make it by 7am and be #uno. I came on a saturday, the day after new years day. Don't be left in the dark like me, I assumed that the flavors were something you found out the day of to make it special and fun, but NO. IT IS POSTED ON THEIR INSTAGRAM EACH WEEK. Normally I would like to say that i thoroughly look through things especially when I'm really interested in it, but I do not know why I did not even try in this instance. So because of my lack of research, and because it was after new years, the flavor I got was a Pink Champagne cruffin. \n\nOkay wait, let me start over. So yes I got to SF at 7am and I was first. I had mixed emotions because I was happy to be first, but I also thought to myself, \"man, if there doesn't end up being a long line, I'm going to feel like an idiot doing too much for a pastry.\" We parked at the metered parking which btw does not start accepting money until 9am. So it's necessary that you probably bring someone so they can hold your place in line while you go pay for the meter. There are two lines, one for normal pastries, one for cruffins, both will be indicated by a sign. The shop opened at 8am for normal pastries. By this time, a line for the cruffins really started to form. Trust me when I say that you definitely should get normal pastries as well. One reason is to hold you over till cruffin time. Second is because I think their pastries are actually phenomenal. The ube puff especially. Oh geez. That is one of the best ube flavored things I have had. The donuts were also delicious (I don't even like donuts). The california croissant would be my 3rd fave, which is a sushi croissant along with a packet of soy sauce. It's very messy, but worth the crumbs and spilled soy sauce! Their savory danishes were also pretty tasty, I think the one we got was a salami one (not completely sure, so just refer to photo). The butternut cheesecake was also yummy, pretty big too. The only pastry I was not fond of was their bread pudding, it was a little too dense and the caramel on top was very very sweet. \n\nONTO THE CRUFFIN. It was my fault for not checking the flavor and knowing my luck I ended up with a weird flavor like Pink Champagne. I remember talking to the other people in line like, \"Yeah I'm not picky, I really don't think theres any flavor I wouldn't like!\" Then the woman came out and announced pink champagne. Once I got my cruffin though...man, maybe it was a good thing that I got a flavor I thought I wouldn't like. Because even though I wasn't a fan of the flavor, I still really liked the cruffin. So I can only imagine how much more amazing it would be if it was a flavor I enjoyed. Which just means I will just have to come back hehe. I loved that the cruffins are so crisp on the outside, but soft on the inside. The filling inside was not overly sweet. I was afraid of a sweetness overkill like reviews have stated, but it was perfect to me! Even a few days later, these were great when I threw them in the toaster oven. Repeat TOASTER OVEN. NOT MICROWAVE. Microwave would just make it soggy and not do it justice. Anyways, I got to talk to one of employees and she told me about how on average they make about 200 cruffins a day, but since they're tricky to make, only about 170 or so end up baking correctly. Aka that's 170 chances for me to get another one, IM COMING BACK.", "author": "Maleah M."}

Generally, there was a good flaky exterior vs soft bready innards ratio which was unique from the typically shaped croissant.  Perhaps the most distinguishable part of the cruffin was the flavor injection.  The peanut butter and jelly flavor-of-the-day was a bit overwhelming for me; it masked the flaky buttery croissant flavor with an ooze of PBJ. I am sure this is not the case everyday, and other flavors might play better with the pastry flavor. \n\nPassion fruit donut 4/5 - this unconventional donut had a great doughy texture that I enjoy, and was encrusted in a thin layer of sugar.  There was a bit too much filling, but with a few wipes, I was able to create a good pastry to filling balance, and the filling flavor itself was a really delicious sweet passion fruit flavor without being too sickly sweet or sour or pucker-y like the real fruit.\n\nNegroni donut 4/5 - this donut was a sensory overload.  First, there was a little but strong eyedropper shot of liqueur piercing the top of the pastry, and I injected it into the center of the pastry before eating it.  The distribution of the liqueur was uneven as some bites had really strong alcohol tastes while others had none.  It was an interesting combination to have a really solid pastry mixed with creamy filling and an alcoholic kick.\n\nImportant to note, during the week, there is no sticker-ing system for cruffin purchases, it is run with a first come first serve basis and cruffin distribution starts at 9am.  That said, I was able to get in line at 8:45am (cruffins are served starting at 9am), and be served at around 9:20am.  For a Wednesday morning, this was a surprisingly long wait, but nothing compared to the weekend rush for cruffins.

There was a line which moved relatively quickly. We heard cruffins typically sell out by 8:30am so we knew we weren't going to get our hands on any (this time!). Not to worry, everything else they sell is damn delicious. We ordered a couple filled donuts (dark chocolate and peach), a churro crossaint and a California croissant (a savory croissant filled with salmon and seaweed). The churro croissant was filled with what tasted like dulce de leche cream. I highly recommend buying one...or three. Peach filled donut was second fav. Flavors vary daily.

(Cruffin distribution begins at 9am). They started handing out \"you're guaranteed to get a Cruffin\" stickers around 8:50am ... and the girl in front of me got the last one. Although I grew anxious, I stayed positive (cuz that's the way I live my life. And would they REALLY hand out the exact number of stickers?). Anyhow, about 35 minutes later -- we got to the front of the line AND they still had a handful of cruffins left! As you have read/researched, they allow 2 cruffins per person. I ordered 1 because (a) they looked big and sweet and (b) I wanted to give someone else a chance to try a cruffin.\n\nThe cruffin itself was good, but a little too sweet for my palette. Is it wrong to say that I threw away some of the filling? Well I did. Sorry, Holmies. Since I woke up at 6:30am to get here and stood outside in the rain, I was expecting a little more. More what? I'm not sure. More all around crispiness? More photo ops??? I really wanted to take a photo of the \"I Got Baked in San Francisco\" neon sign, but alas, it was off. BOOOO!!! This is worth a visit if you're open to the flavor and willing to standing in a long line, but I would HIGHLY suggest getting in line before 8:20am to guarantee yourself a cruffin.", "author": "Jane L."}

I could do cartwheels in the room if I wanted to (and I did want to since I FINALLY got to come here). I've been dying to come here for months but considering the location and the reported sell-out times, I never had a chance. But today was my day because there were a TON of cruffins left.\n\nI purchase a big box with 3 cruffins (2 chocolate, 1 banana cream), 1 California Croissant, 1 Choux bomb, and 1 chai tea donut. You have to order 6 items or more to get the box (I coincidentally wanted 6, lucky me!) All the items came down to three things for me 1) the texture/taste of the pastry itself 2) the filling 3) how it came together.\n\nThe chocolate orange cruffins were the main cruffins they had today. I got two and kind of regret it. They're very heavy. The orange flavor isn't very distinct and results in a chocolate cream that just tastes a bit \"off\". The cruffin itself is basically a large portion of the crusty exterior of a croissant. It's buttery and crusty but I prefer the soft inner portions of a croissant the most. Overall it doesn't come together very well for me but it was fun to eat. (3.5/5)\n\nI have very similar feelings for the banana cream cruffin. The banana cream flavor is very strong but something about the cream just didn't sit right with me. I prefer the banana cream at Tartine. It's not bad but it's also nothing very interesting either. (3/5)\n\nThe california croissant was a huge disappointment in my opinion. I don't know if they forgot the wasabi or if I grew immune to it or what but all I could taste was the salty salmon and the ginger. All the fillings were smushed into one small roll in the center and I felt like I ate a croissant with a bad california roll in the center. Also since the texture of the croissants here are a bit tougher and the baked salmon was dry, the whole bite was a bit hard to chew. I think it definitely would've tasted better warmed though. (2/5)\n\nThe choux bomb and chai tea donut had similarities to them despite being very different desserts. Both of them had the best overall bite (the pastry and the creams actually complemented each other) and the creams were both tasty though a bit too sweet for me. Between the two I prefer the chai tea donut more and if I came back I'd definitely get another one. (3.5/5- choux bomb) (4/5- donut)\n\nOverall, I'm glad I gave Mr. Holmes a try at least once and I'm relieved I didn't spend hours in line just to get it. It's a bit pricy. My 6 pastries were about $27 total. It's worth a try at least once but it wasn't my cup of tea. However I did LOVE taking photos by the sign, especially since their boxes are beautiful. And I was very happy with the helpful service here.", "author": "Vivian C."}

Here's why:\n\nWe get to the bakehouse at 9:30am on a Wednesday morning, and the line is out the door. Okay... I get it... everyone else in line is probably a tourist too. There's also plenty of people cutting the line, taking photos of the \"I got baked in San Francisco\" light, then leaving, which makes the place seem even more packed. \n\nMinutes after we got in line, one of the workers came out and walked around asking people in line how we were doing, which was really nice. Then, he announced that there were \"only 100 pastries left. After we sell the last one, we're closed for the day.\" I was in shock... they're supposed to close at 2:30pm!!!! It was barely 9:40am!

After those two cookies, the line stopped, the lights turned off, and they were done for the day.

Total came out to under $30 for 7 pastries. Pretty reasonably priced for the city I'd say..\n\nCali croissant-- crispy outside and soft/ flakey buttery inside with a delicious California sushi roll in the middle. Aw man it was tasty. 'Twas really flavorful and savory. I could eat it for breakfast everyday if I could. \n\nPeanut butter Cruffin-- crispy sugar coated outside with a surprise filling in the middle. I'm not really a fan of peanut butter but it was 'licious. The peanut butter was very subtle. I believe it was mixed in with marshmallow fluff? It wasn't too sweet which I liked. I enjoyed it so much that I was having second thoughts on whether to eat the one I was saving for a friend..but yeah I had self control...\n\nFerrero rocher choux bomb-- this was definitely my favorite outta the sweet pastries. It was basically an open cream puff but with their ferrero rocher filling. Oh my yum it was so delish--not too sweet and the flavor was subtle. #nomnation\n\nBlueberry brioche bomb-- I had an opportunity to try it but I was too busy stuffing my face with the Cali croissant and peanut butter Cruffin. My friends devoured it. They said it was nom-worthy \n\nNot even 10 minutes after we got there they were completely out of cruffins and most of their pastries.

This is where there was a problem. So I came around 8am with two other friends. My friend stayed in line while me and my other friend went to the other line to buy some donuts and whatnot. While we were in the other line, the guy came by around 8:45 and gave out these stickers that guaranteed you a cruffin.

I came here with a friend on Saturday morning exactly at 8 AM (they open at 8). There are two lines, one for cruffins and one for everything else. Thank god my friend agreed to come with me to wait in line. She stood in the cruffin line, which had probably about 10-15 people in front of her at 8 AM!!! And I stood in the other line which had about 5 people. You definitely need to come with a friend if you're planning on getting cruffins and other pastries. \n\nMy line moved fairly quickly, I got 2 boxes of pastries (6 in each box) and was out the door and waiting in the other line with my friend by 8:20ish. The pastries were all ~$3-5 each, so it's a little pricy. If you want a box, you have to get at least 6 pastries, otherwise the box is $1.50. ALSO, that box is HIGH quality LOL. It's some sturdy cardboard box, and very aesthetically pleasing hahhaha. I basically ordered one of every pastry there LOL so yeah I had two boxes. The inside of the bakery is VERY small, and the person at the front was helping each person one at a time, so the line moved slowly but it wasn't too bad at 8 AM. They do take card, but that day their system was glitching so it was taking longer than usual. They give everyone in the cruffin line a sticker to claim their cruffins, 2 cruffins per person (i think ~10 minutes before they start giving the cruffins out at 9 AM). \n\nSO THE VERDICT ON THE PASTRIES -- DELICIOUS. Ugh. Can anything be more perfect than a pastry????? We ordered a ton of pastries, and literally every single one was delicious. The standouts to me were definitely the matcha donut (flavor varies daily), the artichoke danish, strawberry jalepeno brioche bomb, and the apple honey bostock. The strawberry jalepeno brioche bomb was especially delightful since I was not expecting a slightly spicy pastry at all. And the flavors worked surprisely well together! I wish I had another LOL. I'm in love with danishes, so all of their savory danishes UGH SO MOUTHWATERINGLY TASTY. The cruffin was good as well, but the flavor of the day was chocolate strawberry and I don't really like strawberries or jam and cruffin was topped with a strawberry flavored jam and fresh strawberries...but the chocolate part was great! It's basically a giant croissant shaped like a muffin filled with chocolate pudding. LOL. The insides were amazing. \n\nThere are so many delicious choices.

Be in the cruffin line, which is to the left of the bakery by 7:30AM to guarantee a cruffin. Limit 2 per person. Flavors vary every day. \n- Make sure everyone in your cruffin party receives the Mr. Holmes sticker. You'll need the sticker to get a cruffin. \n- Come with a camping chair or happy to chat with other people in line. You've clearly got something in common with all the other crazies in line. Why not joke about it?\n- If you intend to buy 4 more pastries from the non-cruffin line, tell them you will and ask for a box. Otherwise, the box will cost you $1.50. You need to buy 6 pastries to get their box.\n- Eat your cruffin ASAP if possible. They get a bit soggy after a few hours and don't transport or reheat very well because of the center filling.\n\nImmediately after purchasing cruffins, I always hop into the non-cruffin line to get extra California croissants to eat and to take home and refrigerate. It's great the next day popped in the oven at 400F for 5-8 minutes. I also recommend getting the Ferrero Rocher Choux Bomb, if it's available and perhaps their jelly donuts, which remind me of Hawaiian malasadas. \n\nAll the other pastries are good, but I reckon you can find comparable if not better ones at rival bakeries, but you can decide for yourself.

I had seen so many images of their pastries online and I had stalked their yelp account for days prior to our arrival. \n\nOne thing I kept reading was arrive early because lines can be a bit long, that was what I was anticipating for, but as we arrived there was hardly anyone there. I screamed for joy in my mind, my patience was starting to thin after that 5 hour drive. It was 9am and no one in sight, we even found decent parking! We had our fur babies so we went into the bakery one at a time. There were no descriptions of what each pastry was so either you asked each items description or you chose solely on aesthetics alone. From photos online I was able to distinguish the ube puff and ordered it immediately. The only issue I had was while I was ordering I had asked for the iconic box and the associated quickly snapped at me stating that it was only for purchases of 6 items.\n\nI ended up ordering\n\n a cruffin (croissant muffin hybrid), ube puff pastry, strawberry jalape\u00f1o brioche, two cream filled donuts and a choux bomb. I insisted that my fianc\u00e9 have a try at the strawberry jalapeno brioche and it did not disappoint. Overall I spent $27 on 6 pastries which was pretty standard for a boutique bakery and even after 3 days the pastries were still delicious. The ube puff and the strawberry jalape\u00f1o brioche are my favorite. I cannot wait until you all open a location in Los Angeles!", "author": "Karyn T."}

We rounded up a group of friends and showed up at 8:30am Sunday. There was a line, but thanks to good friends who got here at 8:10, we didn't have to wait more than 30 minutes. The great thing is that you don't have to stand in line if you are not getting the cruffins. So some of us got the filled donuts and other goodies, while others waited. Their strawberry smoothie donut ($3.5) is very very good!! Now as for the cruffin, it's amazing. It was stuffed with a generous amount of German chocolate filling, slivers of coconut pieces, and SO crispy on the outside just like a croissant should. The shape is of a muffin, so I guess that's the part it takes on its name. Note that you can only buy two cruffins with each visit.\nOverall I had a great morning, all thanks to my visit at Mr Holmes. It is worth visiting at least once.", "author": "Alice S."}

We all read the reviews and were well-versed in our plan to tackle the hot ass mess that is Mr Holmes, including waking our asses up at 6am!\n\nHere are my tips that'll make the process hopefully easier for you!\n1) Split up your group. There are 2 lines, one for cruffins and the other for any other pastries. Send someone to get the other yummy pastries you want, while you stay in the cruffin line for the special sticker. IF by chance you're stopping by alone, go to the other line FIRST, then the cruffin line. The other line moves way faster! \n\n2) The holy sticker!! Each pink sticker guarantees each person a max of 2 cruffins. I know, sad right?! Stickers are usually distributed between 7am-8:30am, sometimes a little later because cruffins come out at 9am. If you don't get a sticker, don't completely give up! They usually give some leeway to the next 2-3 people after the last person who received the sticker\n\nWe got the special 4th of July cruffins they had that day that were filled with passion fruit. What i love about the cruffins is that they aren't overly sweet like you'd expect them to be - for me at least. The cruffin itself has a nice crusty exterior because of the sugar, but it's light and airy at the same time. Hard to explain so you'll just have to try it for yourself! Trust me, it's worth the wait \n\nGood luck!! Keep calm & cronut on", "author": "Joelle P."}

The sticker permits two cruffins per person. The flavor changes daily. The cruffins do not last longer than the day they were made. They are best eaten immediately. No joke.\n\nIf standing in line is not your thing, or you missed your opportunity for cruffin, their other baked items are just as good. Everything is delicious.

Anyway we finally got our sticker and the features flavor was Lemon Poppy Seed. Of course my bf and I got all 4, since there's a 2 per person minimum. We ended up buying more pasties as we felt we might as well considering we waited for about 1.5 hours. \n\nThe lemon poppy seed wasn't my favorite, too tangy for my taste and I usually love lemon pound cake. You have to eat your cruffin ASAP, I waited till about half way to eat my second one and it was all soggy, no crisp after a few hours. Over all, I'd go back to try the other flavors, but not the lemon poppy seed. They only have one flavor per day. I just feel that if we're going to wait for 1.5 hours in line there should be more of a variety on cruffins.\n\nI also ended up getting the Ube pastry which was amazing!!", "author": "Marisa B."}

Warning it can get real messy scarfing this treat down. \n\nThe coconut donut was way better than the cruffin though because the filling to dough ratio was more balanced. The apple honey bostock is a solid choice too.

We missed the cruffin cut-off by half an hour or so (I'm gonna say we did this intentionally), and some other popular items like the choux bomb had run out, but we managed to snag the following pastries:\n- Mint chocolate chip donuts: Greedily took the last two remaining donuts of the day because capitalism. I honestly didn't think it would work but the creme had an authentic mint flavor without being overpowering. \n- Artichoke danish: Awesome. Again, was weary of too much artichoke but the balance between the feta/bechamel and the good ole thistle was on point.\n- Kouign Amann: Okay but not outstanding, especially if you compare it to the one at b. or Dominique Ansel in NY.\n- Chocolate sea salt cookie: Thick with just the right amount of saltiness. Yeah I said it.\n- Pumpkin apple danish: to be tried at home but it sure looks good.\n\nOverall, I'm annoyed that I'll have to come back for reals before I can pass final judgment, but after trying a good selection of Mr. Holmes' back catalogue, I have a good feeling about his hit single.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-22", "description": "Finally got to try Mr Holmes and their famous cruffins. (Do not mistakenly call them a cronut, lady selling them will give sassy response. Which is fair, but my poor companion was dragged out of bed by me to wait in line in the wee hours of the morning on a weekend)\n\nTwo lines: the one on the left (facing the storefront) is for cruffins, the one on the right is everything else. Unfortunately, you can't order other items in the cruffin line, but that makes sense because the store itself is actually super tiny (VS Dominique Ansel in NY that started this whole hype, you can buy additional items to your cronut in the cronut line.)\n---Cruffin line started pretty early - we got there around 8:15 on a Sunday morning and there was already a small line (about 10-15 people in front of us, more added as people joined their friends). Stickers come out at 8:40. Unlike one of the yelpers, I do NOT recommend you necessarily split up your group. If you miss the sticker hand out, you will not get a cruffin. Yes, the sticker grants two cruffins per person, but dont you want all two to yourself? I did watch two people leave to join the other line to get other goods and by the time they came back, they had missed the sticker hand out. My alternative: we waited it out in the cruffin line, and immediately after getting our cruffin, the lady will ask \"Are you buying anything else?\" If yes, you literally hop over to the other side and fill your box with more goodies.  This second line does not always exist and even when it does, it moves pretty quick.\n\nNo seats. It's a tiny store that can only accommodate a handful of people. You give them your pink sticker, you get your cruffin, you pay, you GTFO. \n\nFlavor of that day: Strawberry Rhubarb! My take-away? DELICIOUS. They really do capture that perfect croissant texture - flaky and buttery - and combine it with sugar so that it caramelizes into an almost creme brulee type flavor. I truly enjoy it. Warning - the texture does not carry over into next day, but the flavor is still good. I think the filling softens the cruffin from the inside out, taking away that signature light delicate flakiness of a perfect croissant.\n\nOther verdicts: We ordered a savory danish (Turkey & Pesto) and an Amelie Amann. Savory danish was bomb, and we wished we had ordered more...that ale & onion one looked promising. Amelie Amann was tasty, but nothing to write home about. The signature pistachio and rose paste they put inside was minimal and I barely noticed it. I wish we had ordered a donut, but at this point, with six pastries between two people, we were worried about too many gainzz right before summer ;)\n\nTL;DR: Cruffins are tasty, worth the wait if you're really into pastries. (For us, about an hour. Arrived Sunday Morning at 8:15, out by 9:20). They have really captured the perfect croissant flavor/texture. Best to eat it that day. Other pastries definitely worth a try - especially the  savory danish to balance that sweet. You can just order the other pastries after you pick up your cruffins.", "author": "Josephine T."}

I'm normally not even a pastry loving person, but I had to see what the hype was about with those cruffins and custard filled donuts! The hype is definitely real!!! Unfortunately this also means... the line is real too, ha! I've been on a weekday afternoon (wasn't too much left), but i've also been on a Friday at 8:40 am, and I was around 10th in line for cruffins, which come out at 9:00 am every morning. There's also a line for people who don't want cruffins (in most cases, you can just walk up to the counter and order). I've found that the best time to go is around 9 am Monday - Friday, as for Saturday and Sunday... don't even try! LOL!\n\nWhat I've gotten to try so far:\n- Pumpkin spice cream cruffin: During fall, it's all about the pumpkin spice... This cruffin did not disappoint! I was surprised by the size when I first saw it through the window.. This thing is huge! The outside is crunchy, and the inside is soft like a croissant. The filling inside was perfect--not too sweet, but had a strong pumpkin spice flavoring!\n- Blueberry cheesecake donut: I got this for my bf because he loves anything blueberry flavored. Mr Holmes' donut texture was soft and pillowy, not dense at all. Loved the blueberry cheesecake filling! I even ate this one the day after and heated it up in the microwave for a few seconds, and it was still good!\n- Matcha donut: I was sooo excited to try this! From the looks of it, I thought the matcha custard filling would be scarce, but it was actually pumped throughout the whole donut! The matcha toned down the sweetness of the sugar coated exterior too. Delish!\n- California croissant: I absolutely loved this!! There is smoked salmon, seaweed, ginger, and wasabi rolled inside the middle of a huge croissant. The ginger and wasabi aren't too strong (I don't like either usually). They box it with a little packet of soy sauce, but I didn't use it because the croissant is very flavorful on its own.\n- Artichoke danish: The artichoke and the feta blended together and the outcome was amazeballs!!!! Now I want to try all of their savory danishes!! \n- Ferrero Rocher choux bomb: I didn't know what to expect, but I love ferrero rochers so I decided to try this! The inside was a bit too sweet for me. I would share this with someone else in the future because I couldn't finish the whole thing!\n- Kouign amann: Super dense layered croissant dough with a glazed, sugar coated outside. I thought this was alright and nothing too special. I think that's my personal preference though because a lot of people enjoy this!\n\nThe cute box is free if you buy 6 pastries, but costs $1.50 if you get less than that. A box of six pastries will probably run you around $25! Most items are less than $5.\n\nI will be back soon! The cruffin is game changing, but so are all the other pastries... Be sure to get an assortment to try everything out! :) By the way, cruffin and donut flavors change daily, so be sure to check Mr Holmes' instagram or facebook for flavor updates!", "author": "Tara A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-22", "description": "If you like baked goods and sweets, don't miss this place. Yes, it's probably slightly over-hyped and over-priced ($3.50 for a donut, $4.50 for a cruffin, and most other pastries), and you'll have to wait in line for an hour to get a cruffin. But it's delicious, and you should check it out at least once. I've now been 3-4 times and I love trying all the new flavors and different pastries that they make.\n\nIf you want the highly sought-after cruffins, be prepared to wait in line. The cruffins come out at 9 am, and they only have one flavor of cruffins per day. On the weekends, you'll need to get in line by around 8:15 - 8:30 am in order to get one - they hand out stickers to people around 8:45 to ensure that people aren't holding places in line for multiple people. On the weekdays (or at least on the Friday that I went) you'll need to get in line by around 9:15 or 9:30 to get a cruffin. On the weekends, the cruffin line is separate from the normal line to get the other donuts, so if you have multiple people in your group, you can send someone to get some other baked goods while you wait for the cruffins to come out.\n\nI'm going to be blasphemous and actually admit that I like the donuts the best of everything that they have, even over the cruffins, which is good, because I don't have to fight with the rest of SF in the mornings to get one. \n\nHere is what I've tried and my thoughts:\n\n- Cruffins ($4.50): This is probably like an 800 calorie bomb, but I suppose every now and again, you have to treat yourself. Imagine a croissant in a popover form, dusted with granulated sugar, and filled with a lot of flavored cream. I've only tried the matcha with dark chocolate cruffin, and it was delicious. Maybe because it was the first time I had ever had a cruffin, but I thought it was the best thing ever. The second cruffin I had was pumpkin spice, which I didn't care for as much -- I usually love everything pumpkin, but I found it to be too sweet and too much cream/filling for my liking.\n\n- Donuts ($3.50) - These are expensive donuts but these are some of the best donuts I've had in SF, especially when you get a filling that is delicious. They are closer to a bomboloni (Italian donut), so it's fluffy and airy, generously stuffed with a cream flavored filling or a fruit jam-like filling. The passionfruit is one of my favorites, with a little bit of tartness to balance out the sweetness. I also really love the blueberry jam one - it wasn't overly sweet, and paired really well with the dough. I recently had the cranberry-orange one, and it was good, but not better than the other 2 I have had.\n\nI've also tried their potato & leek danish, and one of their sweeter danishes, and I prefer the sweeter danishes better. At $4.50 a pop, they are pretty expensive, but nice for a treat once in a while. \n\nAll in all, a bakery worth visiting if you're in the city. Just be prepared to wait in line if you go in the morning, and be prepared to wait around an hour for a cruffin if you go on the weekend. They post flavors once a week on Instagram, so you can see what is worth waiting in line for. They serve cruffins until they are gone, and the rest of the bakery is open until they run out of baked goods, which is usually around 2-3 pm.", "author": "Christina L."}

It was probably not as popular of a flavor, so when we arrived around 8:15, there was literally no line. We returned around 9:00 and there were only ~10 people in front of us, lining up to the right hand side of the entrance.\nThe cinnamon flavors from the carrot cake were pretty strong, so after awhile we took some of the filling out of the pastry, enjoying the outside and dabbing it with the filling. \n\npastries\n+ AMELIE AMAN: This is similar to the DKA from Dominique Ansel, but crunchier and more dense. I am totally a fan! It is buttery, crunchy, and full of flavor without extra sugar or flavors! It is classic and perfect.\n+ CALIFORNIA CROISSANT: This is my favorite savory croissant. The croissants here are literally perfect. It's airy, but so crunchy on the outside, and doesn't leave croissant flakes everywhere. It keeps its shape as you eat it, with large flakes that come off so that you can continue to eat it. Some think this is too salty with the salmon and nori, but I thought it was just right. There is only a little right in the middle of the croissant, but it is enough flavor to sustain the entire pastry. They also give you a soy sauce packet but you don't need it!\n+ STRAWBERRY DONUT: The flavors of the donuts change daily, posted on their Instagram and Facebook along with the cronut flavors. The donut is like a cloud pillow in your mouth.  It's so soft!  Then, it comes with so much filling, but it's not overly sweet! I don't like jelly-filled donuts, but this was more like a subtly sweet, strawberry cream filled donut.\n~ BREAD PUDDING: This is dense. I lifted it and it had to be a good 2 lbs. by itself. This is really moist and filled with too many raisin for my own taste.\n~ CHOCOLATE COOKIE: This cookie is huge! It is loaded with chocolate on top and inside the cookie. Although we had this cold, I wouldn't say the cookie is something to come back for.", "author": "Sophie P."}

I arrived around 9 AM on a Saturday and there was already a long line outside. I was a bit worried I wouldn't be able to get a cruffin. However, someone comes out and passes out stickers to ensure that you'll be able to get some cruffins. I like that they have this sticker system because you know you'll get able to get a cruffin for sure. The maximum number of cruffins per person is 2.\n\nThe cruffin is truly worth the wait. It is not sweet at all so you won't get sick of it. It is super flaky and crispy on the outside with the perfect amount of sugar sprinkled on top. I tried the Snickers cruffin and it was perfect. The cream inside the cruffin was not overly sweet or overbearing. It tastes and feels like a crossiant and has the shape of a muffin.\n\nI've tried their other pastries and haven't been disappointed yet. I like their cream-filled donuts, especially the pumpkin spice! Their bread pudding is also exceptional.\n\nIt is a small shop, but the line goes by quick.

We were so confused as to why there were so many people and what they were waiting for....we got the name of the place and left. After reading all the reviews we decided to head on over the next next day for breakfast.  \n\nThey opened at 9am however there were lines before that. On one side there is a cruffin line (which we didn't make it in time for they only make a certain amount and hand out stickers for the people that are getting some for sure that day) but that's okay because we just stood in the other line which is for pastries. \n\nWe waited about an hour in line and finally made it into the store to order....at that point we said yolo and ordered everything that we thought looked good. For a box of pastries and two coffees we spent about $30. \n\nMan oh man was the wait and cost SOOOOO worth it. Honestly the best pastries we have ever had. Wish we could have tried the cruffins but we will for sure next time we are in town. \n\nWe got two donuts one was strawberry filled and the other was like a key lime pie fill.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-26", "description": "I had a friend a couple of months ago who stood in line and got some cruffins. She had one left, so she dropped by after work and gave it to me.  The cruffin was good - kind of what I expected crossiant like texture in the shape of a muffin...which actually makes it kind of hard to eat. \n\nThen I was able to wake up early one morning and finally got a cruffin. Well two since I'm allowed to get 2.  To get the cool box, I needed to buy 4 more items so I ordered 2 donuts, a california croissant, and the bread pudding.  \n\nLet's start with the thing everyone (or at least almost everyone) comes here for - the cruffins. They're what people will wait an hour in line for and there's so many pictures on instagram.  It's good, is it worth waiting an hour in line? Sure, why not. With a good friend and some great conversation it'll go by quickly.  The outside is crunchy and sugary and the inside has a great flavoring. I had the cookies and cream and I definitely enjoyed it.  Would love to try the matcha one though - probably will check their instagram for the flavors and try the matcha ones! \n\nThe California croissant was interesting - salmon wrapped in seaweed in croissant. Delicious to say the least. Probably the most creative and croissant there. Would definitely go back to get those (since there really isn't line for the other baked goods). \n\nThe donuts - well mine was filled with pomegranate and the other flavor was white chocolate. The donut was okay.  The filling (like someone else said) was very custard tasting. I didn't really taste the pomegranate - it was just all around sweet instead of a little tart like I would expect a pomegranate to taste. \n\nThe bread pudding, I only ended up having half of it to share with my roommates, but it was pretty good. Filled with chocolate and dried cranberries, topped with powdered sugar and some caramel, it was dense sweet and like a bread pudding should be. \n\nOverall, I did get some delicious pastries. Would I stand back in line? Maybe with some friends if they wanted to get some. It's quite a difficult thing to eat and created a definite sugar overload for me, but an experience nonetheless. \n\nProtip: Get there early if you want a cruffin - probably at least half an hour early. I got there an hour early - just as they were opening the regular bakery and I was #5 in line! California croissant is unique and something people should try!", "author": "Nina Y."}

I decided to finally give this place a try given all the hype around the \"I got baked in SF.\" I heard that the lines were not so great, so decided to take advantage of a random Tuesday morning to buy goods. I'm also constantly amazed by how people in San Francisco have time to wait in line on the weekdays. Like why aren't they at work? These are the questions I ponder when I'm standing in a line alone at 8:50 waiting for the magical cruffins to be sold.\n\nGiven that it was a weekday morning, the wait really wasn't too bad at all -- I was in and out in probably 20 minutes from my initial arrival time. I got the Cruffin, amelie amann, strawberry jelly donut, and choux bomb as per what everyone has recommended on Yelp. My thoughts:\n\nCruffin -- meh. Overly sweet, not about it. Not sure what I was really expecting in terms of texture. Just tasted more croissant than muffin to me. \n\nJelly donuts -- good, but also overly sweet. Donut texture was wonderful though.\n\nMama X took the amelie amann and choux bomb from me without letting me try a bite though -- she spoke highly of the amelie amann, but I think it's just because it was the only thing that I got her that was pretty minimalist and not filled to the brim with some sort of cream or anything. Apparently it was crystallized sugar and a slightly charred bottom and creamy croissant-buttery goodness. She highly recommends. Choux bomb was unmemorable.\n\nA box here contains 6 pastries, fyi if you want it for your instagame. The people here were a bit sassy with me because I was trying to buy two separate things for two different people and I got sassed out for not filling one of the boxes with 6 pastries. oops. Sorry not sorry. Service could be a little more polite given that we're waiting in line for your not super delicious goods, but not a huge deal.\n\ntl;dr overall, decent pastries and to be fair I can't think of any famous pastry place to rave about (maybe Tartine, but these two are playing in really different pastry markets) so it's unique -- I think it's creative and enjoy the ingenuity, but I found that most of the pastries here were of the creamy filled variety whereas I prefer more pure pastries that are less sweet", "author": "Jasmine X."}

The rotating flavors of cruffins is what brings people back. It's an enjoyable feat, though not quite an experience because they lack tables and chairs. The store size is mediocre at best and coffee is not something they socialize in. But not all hope is gone!

The first time, I got in line at 8:45 am and was too late. The second time, their oven broke. And the third time, I was finally in luck. Because I've been here three times, I've tried a lot of their baked goods. I've tried the matcha doughnut, blood orange doughnut, lemon poppyseed doughnut, peanut butter and coconut doughnut (+ two other flavored doughnuts that I can't remember the name of), ham and cheese danish, mushroom danish, ferrero roche choux bombs, california sushi croissant, amelie amann, french toast grilled cheese, and finally, the chocolate cointreau cruffins.\n\nMy take on their pastries are that the dough here is REALLY good. The cruffins are perfectly doughy and flakey and the doughnuts are soft and chewy. However, what lacks for me is the flavor of the fillings. All of their fillings just taste like custard. I felt that way with their matcha flavor, their chocolate cointreau flavor, and peanut butter and coconut flavor. Being Japanese, I was especially upset about the how lacking their matcha flavor was! Whatever I ate was just custard dyed green. Their citrus-flavored items (blood orange and lemon poppyseed) were better. The tangy and the sourness shined through the sweet, which I liked. \n\nYou can't go wrong with anything here. But with my track record, I would skip any of the flavors that is mixed with custard. For some reason none of them turned out flavorful.\n\nMr. Holmes Bakehouse is a great bakery, and such a fantastic addition to the neighborhood.

There is no limit on other pastries. \n\nOn the the pastries! My first cruffin in life was the tirsmisu. I am not a big fan of tiramisu but it was good. Nice and cripsy on the outside and soft on the inside. It is pretty sweet since the cruffin is coated in sugar but when you mixed it with cruffin filling inside, it is phenomenal. On my second visit, I had the caramel popcorn cruffin and I liked it better than the tiramisu one due to my flavor preference. It makes me really sad that you can only get 2 at a time but I assume it's for quality purposes and I respect that! The filled donuts are pretty good too, however, they are super sweet as it is also coated in sugar. I also got the california roll croissant and that was delicious! It is seaweed, salmon, ginger(?), n a hint of wasabi inside of a croissant.

I spent around $30 for all the pastries listed above and I'd have to say, it wasn't worth it. In all honesty, if I could redo my order, I would only buy the Strawberry Rhubarb Donuts or just the donuts in general. Everything else was okay, so I wouldn't pay $2.50+ each for everything else. \n\nWe went on a Thursday morning and the line for the cruffins started at around 8:30am. We were second ones in line. There is a limit of 2 cruffins per person. They started selling the cruffins at 9:00am. I believe they were $4.50 each.\n\nFrom most favorite to least favorite it would be Strawberry Rhubarb Donut, Vanilla Toffee Donut, Kouign Amann, Caramel Sticky Bun, Lemon Meringue Cruffin, and Ube Puff. Their donuts are soft, which is probably why I enjoyed them so much. The Kouign Amann basically just tasted like a croissant with a hint of caramel to me, so nothing too exciting, but still good. The Caramel Sticky Bun was also good, but I liked the center of the bun more than the outside of the bun because the caramel made the outside a bit hard. I didn't really enjoy the Lemon Meringue Cruffin because of the flavor itself. It was a bit too sour for my taste, so I just ate around the filling. The Ube Puff was definitely my least favorite. There was some type of pink icing on top and I just thought it didn't taste good. My boyfriend thought the same thing, so we didn't finish this one. \n\nOverall, I probably wont be standing in line for another cruffin.

There are a lot of people, including tourists, who do not live in the city to get these pastries (I find that they financially contribute more to MHBH than locals) and it is disappointing to wait for an inordinate amount of time on a weekend no less just to obtain a Cruffin that isn't even a flavour that you like. \n\nOut of all the pastries, aside from the cruffins, I thought the croissant was the best I've had outside of France. Everything else was lacklustre and I think it would be within the bakery's financial interest to solely concentrate on expanding the cruffin production to include additional flavours. I reckon it's a waste of time and resources to continue making other pastries that aren't even good---the cruffins are the best item anyway. \n\nFollowing the reviewers' advisements, I came at 07:45AM and did not receive my cruffins until 09:23AM. As I had somewhat of a walk up the hill, I asked for the box instead of the paper bag to carry my cruffins as I wanted something sturdier. \n\nIn order to get that white box, I was asked to buy an extra 4 pastries because they won't give it to you unless you buy at least 6 baked goods in total. \n\nThe cruffins are an interesting texture. It's extremely flaky, buttery, and the cream filling complements it very well. The sugar creates a sandy coating and honestly, this was very fun to eat. As soon as I bit into it, the cream exploded on the other end. \n\nI reckon if you have time on a weekend and are willing to wait a little for a pastry, go right ahead. It took me 90 minutes to get that sticker and I cannot blame others who would balk at waiting at an inordinate amount of time for a pastry---it's silly, right? \n\nOne good thing however is that when you are in the queue, you have an opportunity to meet strangers and chat with them. It's a chance for a brief, human interaction and you might even be able to make a friend. \n\nBut if you prefer not talking to anyone, then I suggest you bring a fully charged phone or some newspapers to read as you wait.", "author": "C.

However, here is my unfortunate story:\n\nAfter getting off the airplane, I took BART to the Civic Center stop and proceeded to walk the 0.8 miles uphill to this well talked about place. Thankfully there was a short line (10am on a Friday) and all the pastries were still well in stock. I took the famous photo of the \"I got baked in San Francisco\" sign and ordered my cruffin. I was about to pay, but remembered I read great reviews about their donuts, so I added that to my order too. I proceeded to walk towards City Hall as the bike shop I planned to rent from was about a mile away in that direction. Right outside City Hall I decided \"Hey my aunt was curious about a cruffin, why don't I send her a picture of it!\" I proceeded to pull said cruffin out of the bag and took a pretty clear picture of it. Proud of myself, I was putting away my phone and with all the sugar around the cruffin combined with a waxy bag.....I dropped the cruffin. It didn't just hit once, it rolled around. I kinda just stared at it for a second, told myself not to think about it, picked it up, tossed it in the trash, pulled out the donut and held onto it for dear life as I stuffed my face. As I walked away I realized I should have taken a picture of my sad cruffin on the ground, but in the moment I was in such a high from the excitement of spending the day exploring San Francisco that I wanted it out of my mind and my stubbornness prevented me from walking the almost mile back uphill...again..for another one.\n\nNeedless to say, I cannot speak about the cruffin. It looked delicious as you can see in my photo! But sadly, another day. However, the staff was incredibly friendly and my second choice donut pulled me through the rough time because it was very delicious (thank goodness I bought 2 items!). I'm even one to usually avoid creme-filled donuts, but the chocolate hazelnut was perfect.\n\nWorth the trip and always better on a week day to avoid long lines. Just watch out for that slippery sugar if you're holding up the pastries for a picture! Do it on a table.", "author": "Megan M."}

We didn't rent a car so we decided to try and walk it there from my friend's apartment. I was warned about walking through Tenderloin since it can be a sketchy area. Walking through Tenderloin around 730-8ish AM was kinda still kinda scary. Anyway, when we got to Mr Holmes Bakehouse there was a little line formed outside the door. There were maybe 8 or 9 people standing in line. One of the workers came out and handed out pink stickers which seemed like the ticket to Cruffins. \n\nOn this particular day they were selling the Matcha Green Tea cruffins. For some reason I thought they made more than one flavor so was slightly disappointed because I wanted to try a chocolate or caramel flavor. Anyway we bought a bunch just in case we liked them and also got an ube tart and a donut that my BF wanted to try. \n\nMe and the BF were excited and wanted to see what the hype was about. Ube tart was delicious! Just enough pastry to bite into. The cruffin on the other hand was not what I expected. To be a combo of a croissant/muffin i felt the consistency of the pastry was to thick and it was an overkill on the filling. It got real messy to eat and there was sugar all over my hands, my lips and the table. \n\nHopefully next time I stop by SF there will be a different flavor.", "author": "Donna V."}

THEIR PASTRIES ARE gooooooodddddd!!\n\nMUST TRY: ANY FLAVORED CRUFFIN THAT TICKLES YOUR SWEET TOOTH REALLY AND CHOUX BOMB! *Check out their website or instagram for flavor updates since they do change daily*\n\nNote: No place to sit down and eat. Most people just point, pay, take pictures of their goods with the \"I Got Baked in San Francisco\" sign they put up and go.\n\nStayed over at a friend's place in the city for the weekend and walked over to Mr. Holmes' Bakehouse on LARKIN EARLY IN THE MORNING, WHICH IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO cause THEY SELL OUT QUICKLY and the WAIT IN LINE CAN TAKE AT LEAST an HOUR! There was already a short line at around 8 AM and the doors werent even open yet. They ask you to form TWO LINES to keep the purchasing system going.\n\n1. For CRUFFINS. -  They hand out a sticker to EACH PERSON which entitles them to TWO CRUFFINS. Taste? THEY WERE DELECTABLE and really an INDULGENT dessert. Crisp and flaky on the outside with granules of sugar covering its exterior with caramelized crusts surrounding it. On the inside is the day's specialty flavors as its creamy light custardy filling. CHOCOLATE, MATCHA, GUAVA, PEANUTBUTTER, RASPERRY WHITE CHOCOLATE. All are pretty good but definitely something you can share. Note that they might not take being in the frige too well and are best eaten fresh/on the day. \n\n2. All other pastries - This line usually gets moving first. So you can get ahead of the pack but can only purchase everything but no. 1's line is for. Friends tried the guava flavored donuts and savory croissants. All were alright but not as special as the round morsels of dough filled with creamy goodness that you MUST HAVE: THE CHOUX BOMB.\n\nTip no. 1: WAIT FOR YOUR STICKER. This worked for me a my friends. We waited for them to give out the stickers so we each got one then those of use who wanted to buy something else went ahead and just got back in line where we originally were. Gets things going faster.\n\nTip no. 2: Besides Mr. Holmes' pastries, THEIR PACKAGING IS GLORIOUS and a thing to WATCH OUT FOR. Clean lines, GOLD  METALLIC font and design. Beautiful. Take note though, YOU CAN ONLY GET A BOX if you order 4 or more pieces. Tactics you say? \n      a. Buy at least 4 pastries,\n      b. Share a box with a friend or two or more, or\n      c. This one's a little sneaky. My friend went in the \"for all others line\" and purchased a few pastries and said that she'd be buying more cruffins so that they could give her a box. Let's just say she didnt get any more cruffins. Teehee! \n\nTip. no. 3: Surely you'd like some company? Bring a friend or two you wouldn't mind waiting hours in line with. If you're on your own though and on a mission to have a bite, dont worry! Those dessert loving customers in line with you I'm sure are as sweet! I enjoyed talking with the people I was in line with! \n\nThe pastries are good and definitely something you should try should you have the time and determination to try one of these goodies by lining up early in the morning. Without a doubt an indulgence but great box to bring over to a dinner/lunch at home or a party because it will surely impress!", "author": "Margaret G."}

We got in line at 8:30 on a Wednesday and it was already about 15-20 people deep, before the cruffin line even opened! I went in and bought all my other pastries and a coffee to drink while we waited. Once the line opened at 9am, it moved pretty quickly, and we were back in our car by 9:15 at the latest I'm sure.\n\nThe cruffin flavor of the day was caramel latte, and the flavor was present but subtle, which I liked. The cruffin is actually pretty huge and was soft and flaky but still held up with each bite. The one thing I didn't like about the cruffin was that it was covered in sugar so it was pretty sweet and messy. I would've liked it much better without the outer sugar layer. I don't think I'd go out of my way to wait for these again, but they are fun to get and a must try at least once.\n\nWe also got one each of their stuffed donuts (flavors of the day were a spicy chocolate and a berry jam), the California croissant, potato & leek savory pastry, Thai curry bun, cookie, and ube pop tart. I liked all of them except the Thai curry, which needed more filling and flavor throughout the entire bun. Favorites of the others were probably the California croissant and the pop tart - not too sweet, which works perfectly for me. The donuts were also covered in sugar and had quite a lot of filling - which are both good things, but for me, too sweet and too indulgent. I like the subtle flavors better :)\n\nWould I come back? Definitely- but for their regular items! Both to avoid the crazy cruffin line and because I enjoyed them more.", "author": "Kathy L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-05-31", "description": "Mr. Holmes Bakeshop, you reminded me of middle school/high school.  Why?  Because I've been semi stalking your Instagram, waiting for the perfect opportunity to \"meet you\" after crushing on you (your cruffins) for quite some time.  So, I've been wanting to get my hands on those damn cruffins for months and hubby always is skeptical of overhyped places like this but loves me so much that he'll go with me and wait with me.  We were close on one weekend but knew weekend waits even if we got there about an hour before the 9:00 cruffin time would be a lot worse.  So, we went on MDW Thursday with his cousin and stood in line while it was cold and slightly misty.  It was a little before 8:40 when we got in line and there were only about 10-12 people in front of us.  Of course there's no wait if you want to get non-cruffin goodies.  They kept coming out and making sure we knew of the \"two separate lines.\"  I asked one of the workers if they would be able to tell us what the flavor was (fearing it may be the matcha one, as I don't like green tea).  She asked me first if I wanted to know or be surprised and I told her I wanted to know.  She then told me that the flavor was Almond Joy..phew!  Really wish they would let people know prior to that morning what the flavor is though. \n\n9:00 hits and we were super antsy, though it was about a couple minutes after when they let the first person go in.  We finally got in about 10 minutes after and if you get six items then they give you the box (less than 6 you can't even buy it you just get a paper bag).  I totally over ordered but because I thought to myself when am I actually going to be able to come back (& be patient)?  We got six cruffins (2 max per person allowed), 1 passion fruit filled donut, 1 Ferrero Roche choux bomb, and one coffee for his cousin.  There is really no room to eat here, just a small bench under the got baked in SF lighting sign and a small standing table by the entrance.  The verdict?  It's all about the flakey glorious cruffin.  The layers were flakey like a croissant that everyone would love, sugared like a morning bun, and custard filled like an eclair, and topped like a true SF creation with unheard of ingredients.  Though I expected this to be super sweet it wasn't, which is good.  I'm not that big on coconut but like an Almond Joy it had some shredded coconut and a piece of chocolate with diced up almonds.  It all worked so well and was pretty foodgasmic!  As for the other items, the passion fruit donut was way too sweet and messy.  It wasn't anything special that you couldn't find anywhere else (minus perhaps the passion fruit flavor).  The Ferrero Roche choux bomb I saved for later in the night, and I saw one Yelp buddy's disappointing review on it, but I decided to go for it.  It was a disappointment for sure.  It just had a very slight hint of Ferrero Roche taste, but the pastry part wasn't that pleasing nor the cream part.  If I'm going to ingest hella calories it better be worth it and this one wasn't..it was like eating just a bunch of whip cream out of the can.  His cousin has been living in Brooklyn for about four years and not only enjoyed the cruffin, but also said the coffee they serve here was really good, which apparently he hasn't good coffee as good in New York.  \n\nThe other pastries actually didn't look as appealing to me, some looked too dark as well.  I'm not going to lie, I was kinda hoping that I was going to like their other pastries and not so much their cruffins so I can just go back and skip the line to get the other pastries.  But honestly the hype is real on the cruffins.  The stalking does pay off for the cruffins.  Just like that boy I used to like in middle school/high school, sometimes the wait is worth it when you go ahead and make a move.  I just wished the other pastries were as good.  Would I come back?  Perhaps if I got another weekday off and was lucky to find parking like we did (saw others get dropped off via Uber)..but I wouldn't wait longer than 45 minutes or so for it.

Sorry cronut, but you ain't got nothing on the cruffin. \n\nI woke up early on a Monday morning and drove over. There was plenty of street parking around the corner and I made it to the already growing line around 8:45AM. The cruffin come out at 9:00AM. There were maybe 30 people in front of me. The cruffin came out about 5 minutes late, but I managed to get my cruffin at 9:15AM. Remember, you can only buy 2 per person.  I also go the choux bomb and all the artichoke cheese danish.\n\nThe cruffin flavor was chocolate chip cookie. It was delicious! Now, it is VERY messy so I would sit down to eat it and have plenty of napkins on hand. Also, it is very sweet so be sure you have a sweet tooth like meee! My brother doesn't eat sweets so he thought it qas just a little too much for him. I didn't mind. I got to finish his! The chocolate chip filling was so creamy and smooth. Unfortunately, I lost some to the floor. I seriously ate it all up within a few minutes.\n\nThe choux bomb was also very good as well. Not as sweet as the cruffin but it was good. \n\nThe savory danish with artichoke was so interesting. The first bite was kind of a shock to your taste buds, but keep munching away and you will like it. \n\nI've also gone back on a Saturday morning during the winter holidays. I got there around 8:30AM and waited in line. We got a sticker guaranteeing that we get a cruffin! While waiting, I jumped in the normal line and grabbed an eggnog doughnut and earl grey doughnut. Both were delicious. The flavors weren't too strong or overpowering. It was very light and fluffy.\n\nFast forward to the cruffin purchase. This day was the mint chocolate chip cruffin. I was expecting the generic mint chocolate chip flavor, but this was different! The mint was more like mint leaves! It was such an amazing and a tasty surprise!

Be careful once you munch down on it, all the wonderful goodness inside will overflow and you do not want to waste a single drip, believe me,  haha.\n\nVery interesting flavors, e.g, today I saw strawberry lemonade (which is what I tried) and lemon poppyseed just to name a couple. I was told they have different options each day and make sure to follow them on insta to stay UTD.

I agree, as I've seen their pictures on Instagram before stepping foot in the store. That said, I have mixed feelings about this place. Their pastries, both sweet and savory, are awesome and for the most part, unique...but their cruffins, which they are known for and which people line up out the door for, were not the main attraction for me. \n\nWhat I liked: \n-California croissant. Savory, unique combination of salmon and seaweed in a decent-sized croissant. Surprisingly a combo I've never seen before. Salty on its own and doesn't need the soy sauce it comes with. \n-Mushroom cheese danish. Solid solid danish. Reminded me of cream of mushroom and again, it was such a unique taste and mix of ingredients (whole mushrooms) on a danish, that I was pleasantly surprised. \n-Classic AKA basic (?) Instagram shot with the \"I got baked in San Francisco\" neon lights. #basicbetch \n-Branding. My friend and I were very impressed with their cheap but effective branding. They seem to buy bulk items, such as cups, and simply stamp their peace logo on it. With wax paper bags, they do the same but use a small circular sticker. Cheap, effective, and hipster all at the same time. \n\nMeh: \n-Chocolate croissant. My cousin liked it, but I've had better. The chocolate was minimal - too much croissant in contrast to chocolate. Good, but not impressed. \n\nWhat I didn't like:\n-Strawberry cream cruffin was the flavor of the day. Filling was way too sweet. Just because you give a trendy new name to something you made up doesn't mean it's something I want. I don't see the hype and definitely do not understand why the line is out the door well before 9 am on a weekday. \n\nI do want to try the matcha cruffin though...perhaps that will change my stance on cruffins?

We came on a Saturday, and for some reason Yelp said it was closed, although if you call in it says they are open everyday except Christmas, so I'm glad we risked it and went anyways, and maybe that's how we got lucky to get a cruffin, as only so many people are guaranteed cruffins each day. The line for cruffins was very organized, and someone working at the bakery was very helpful and explained how the cruffins were distributed and that if you were not there for the cruffins there was a shorter line available. We got a chocolate flavor cruffin, I did not realize that the cruffins came with filling, but you don't have a choice with flavor. The chocolate filling reminded me of pudding, it was flavorful, but I wish it was a little more solid consistency like a chocolate croissant, because the pudding flavor was too runny and got everywhere. I would definitely preferred a cruffin with some type of berry filling. We got 3 cruffins, and if you want a box to hold your pastries you have to buy 3 more pastries for a total of 6, or pay 1.50. Since we were already there, we decided to get 3 additional pastries, which we ended up liking better than the cruffin. They made some \"savory\" danishes, one with artichoke heart filling, another with blue cheese and pear, and these were amazing! I l loved the flakiness of the danishes and the flavor combination was perfect. \nI thought it was helpful that everything in the display case is labeled, so you appropriately identify what you want to order, the problem being that I didn't recognize the name of most of the pastries, so I asked, but there was a long line behind me, so I felt like I had to make a decision and move forward. Everything here is at least $3-$4 so be prepared to spend a pretty penny.", "author": "Lisa H."}

Since there was already a line when we showed up it was easy to find. About 10 minutes before 9am, a worker will come out and hand you a hot pink sticker. If you get a sticker you can get a cruffin. The flavor that day was Rocky Road. I am not a fan of that flavor, but this was my only chance to taste a cruffin I bought 2 to share. For me the real stand out was the California croissant, their croissants are SO flaky and really are divine. The California is a great savory item\n\nWhen I came back home. I wanted to share half a doughnut. So I cut it in half and a ton of filling squirted out! I was so surprised. I thought I had squished it all out! Turns out I didnt and there was plenty of filling still inside. The amount of filling they are able to SQUEEZE inside is crazy!! \n\nI really can't add to what everyone else is saying.

Got here around 7:40 on a Saturday morning. The line was pretty long and I was worried my boyfriend and I wouldn't get to try those bad boys. \n\nWe had time to kill so I decided to leave my boyfriend in the \"cruffin only\" line while I lined up in the other line to get my hands on their other goodies. Halfway through my wait I get a text from my boyfriend saying he received a sticker from one of the workers which meant he was guaranteed cruffin. I was ecstatic but worried that they wouldn't let me purchase a cruffin since I didn't receive a sticker. I figured they'll let me slide since I was in their other line purchasing other pastires from them. \n\nI get to the front of the line in the and I pick up 2 chocolate croissants (my weakness!), banana filled donut, strawberry filled donut, amelie amann, and a ferrero rocher choux bomb. \n\nWent back to the \"cruffin only\" line and rejoined my boyfriend who was holding our spot in line. We get to the front of the cruffin line and my boyfriend orders 2 (2 limit per person) and I try and order 1. That's when the worker said they were not able to sell me any since I didn't have a sticker. He explained to me that it's not fair for the other people behind me who may not receive one in the end. I explained to the worker that I was in their other line purchasing other pastires and even showed him the box to proe it. But he was still adamant about not selling me ONE CRUFFIN. So I let it go and we come away with 2 delicious tiramisu flavored cruffins!\n\nOn our way home, I continue to think about the situation and now believe it was unfair for me. Standing in line they hand out stickers to guarantee people a cruffin. However they also have a disclaimer to the people at the very end of the line telling them \"There's no guarantee\" that they will receive a cruffin. It was explained to those at the back of the line that its up their discretion if they want to continue waiting in line or not since there's no guarantee they would receive a cruffin. With that said, how is fair to me then?! It's not my fault the people behind me didn't wake up early enough, or get there early enough to receive a cruffin. It's not as if I was sleeping in bed and made my boyfriend line up for me. I was in the other line supporting their bakery! I even had the receipt and box filled with pastries to prove it, I expressed that to the worker but he wasn't having it. He was adamant about not selling me ONE cruffin. I wasn't even taking advantage and trying to get 2!  I only wanted to purchase 1 and yet they couldn't accommodate that for a customer who woke up early and waited in line for more than hour. The worker continued to say it's unfair to those at the back of the line. EXCUSE YOU, BUT I WOKE EARLIER AND LINED UP EARLIER THAN THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME. Yet, it's not fair to them? You've got to be kidding me. I didn't even want to purchase 2, I wanted to buy 1. I thought it was rude that they denied me selling me 1 cruffin when I waited longer than the people behind me and yet I'm punished for that? NOT COOL MAN. \n\nHowever, everything was delicious! Things I didn't like about this place is obviously how I was treated about not receiving a sticker. So I'm taking 1 star off. Also, I'm not sure if wait 1+ hours is worth the cruffins. It was good though, I just wish I could walk in order one and not have to wait for it, but don't we all wish that. Also the bakery is located in s pretty sketch area and the pastries are over-priced.

The new hyped up bakery is Artsicault so I figure the lines will be shorter. :)\n\nI was a little disappointed. I had a few things over the weekend and the plum cruffin today. I was hoping it be the \"SHIET\" but there are so many good bakeries in SF that it didn't hit the spot for me. The regular croissants seem a little dry. Actually most of their pastries we had seem to be on the dryer side (except their donut).\n\nCruffin: It's not as flakey and moist like a cronut or a regular croissant. The bottom area is dry and I assume it cooks more because of the shape of the pastry. There is a lot of sugar sprinkled around the whole pastry which made it a bit too sweet for my liking.\n\nCali Croissant: We just didn't like it... \n\nChocolate Croissant: We had better. It's not as light and flaky as other pastry shops.\n\nI would totally skip the cruffin craze and stick with the cronut. Cronuts are a lot more light and flaky. My favorite cronut place in the city is Fillmore Bakery. They usually have a couple of flavors and I believe they ask if you want sugar sprinkled on the it (it's nice to have that option). BTW, they have GREAT pie here too! This is my favorite place for pie. :)\n\nFor Croissants, my favorite place is La Boulangerie on Pine St. If you're lucky (which I was ONLY once), you get here right when the croissants come out of the oven. As I walked out of the bakery eating my croissant half way down the block I had to stop and turn back around to get another. This has only happened to me 2x in my life where I had to stop and go back into a store for seconds (the other time was a fish taco place in Newport Beach).\n\nI haven't had the chance to try Artsicault yet.

Let's just ask the bicyclist who I saw slowly get hit by a car, get up and brush himself off, park his bike at the bike rack and then proceed to get in the cruffin line.  Yup, it's really that good!! Lol.\n\nCruffin:\n\nWhile the other pastries are great the cruffin is definitely the shining star.  You can just tell the quality in the texture and the taste of the croissant.  Buttery, flakey....just perfect.  Now the varying fillings makes things interesting and keeps us coming back for more.  It is true that most of the time you don't know what filling you will be getting until you are already lined up.  I personally don't mind as I am not a picky eater and don't mind a repeat as they have all been delicious.\n\nI do want to take a moment to comment on some people's sentiment on increasing the supply.  This seems completely logical for a patron as who wants to ever wait in line?  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure the limited supply is helping to keep the hype going. However, for a small business this isn't always an easy thing to do.  When you are just starting out you may have limited resources, e.g. funds, staff, space...also being careful not to compromise the quality of the product.  These beauties also take 3 days to make.  It's the technique that makes these amazing.  In other words, all good things are worth the wait.  \n\nOther Pastries:\n\nThese are all excellent as well.  Their filled donuts are like malasadas and they always change up the fillings.  My faves are the sea salt chocolate chip cookies, white chocolate blueberry brioche bomb and the donuts.  The only thing I would change is to have more of a rotation in selection.  I've pretty much seen the same items the past few months and am itching to try something new.  \n\nStrategy: \n\nOn the weekends we usually try to get there between 7:45-8:00.  The wait really isn't that bad.  It goes by quickly especially when you're in good company.  There will be two lines.  The one to the left of the door will be for cruffins only, which go on sale at 9:00.  The one on the right is for the rest of the pastries, which go on sale at 8:00 on the weekends (7:00 on weekdays).  Come with a buddy if you can and split up so you can try more things.  Just make sure your buddy gets back in the cruffin line before they hand out the stickers though.  Usually 15 minutes or so before 9:00 one of the staff members will hand out the stickers guaranteeing you 2 cruffins.  And just like that...you're in! \n\nShop/Staff:\n\nIt's a small shop in not one of the nicest of neighborhoods but it's not that bad during the day.  The shop itself has a cool/fun vibe to it and they have good taste in music.  There's not much room to eat your treats so you pretty much need to take them away to enjoy.  The staff is awesome... always so nice each time we've been there.\n\nI highly recommend giving this place a try.  Everyone should try a cruffin at least once or 12 times.

There are two lines - one to the left for cruffins ONLY, and one to the right of the storefront for all other goods. They start serving cruffins at 9am on the weekend, and there were maybe 10 people in front of me. My friend parked and by the time she scooted over to me about 10 mins later, the line had grown way past me and around the block. We waited patiently for the oh-so-coveted pink stickers / golden ticket, which entitles you to purchase 2 cruffins each. People brought their small children to grab a sticker each to also count for 2. Smart, wake them up and force them to stand in line for goodies (I'm totally doing this to my future kids). Stickers were handed out around 8:40am, and right after we got our stickers, my friend hopped to the other line, which moved pretty quickly, and returned about 15 mins later with a box full of pastries. Right at 9am they started collecting stickers and people were moving forward in the cruffin line. We were out of there by 9:10am, treats in hand!\n\nCruffin - flavors vary per day, but we forgot to ask the flavor and mistakenly thought we'd be able to tell. The cream was sort of nutty, but not exactly chocolatey... three of us could not distinguish exactly what it was. That being said, the cream was not impressive at all. In fact, I ended up ditching about half of it because the cream to croissant ratio was just off. The croissant part of the cruffin was really good - perfectly flaky, slightly crispy, powdered sugar all over - BUT about on par with some amazing croissants I've had in my time. Would I stand in line again for a cruffin? No. Especially now that I know it's just a croissant baked into the shape of a muffin, with some cream in the center. Meh. Underwhelmed.\n\nAmelie Amann - now THIS was money. Maybe it helps that I had absolutely no expectations, but this was the cream of the crop out of the pastries we got. It was sweet, but the kind that is excellent for treating your tastebuds, with the right amount of sweetness. It was sticky, flaky, buttery, crispy... DROOL. I ate half and saved half for the next day and it was still very very good. 5 stars for this!\n\nDonut filled w/ salted caramel filling - underwhelming. Donut itself was kind of dry, was nothing memorable.\n\nOther things we got: Ferraro Rocher choux bomb, almond brioche toast. Both were decent, but nothing to rave about.\n\nI'd come back for the amelie amann, and for other instagram worthy moments, but not likely to go out of my way.", "author": "Lily C."}

It's no joke that if you want to be sure to get a cruffin, stand in line no later than 8:45am! Around 15 mins into us standing in line, one of the employees came out and told us that we had a 5% chance of getting a cruffin even though we were only 3 parties behind the woman who got the last sticker! I was so sad but still determined to try these famous pastries so we braved the line for about an hour, hoping that there would be some left for us to try. We got to the front and there was indeed, another whole tray of cruffins for us and everyone in line behind us! I felt so bad for the few parties behind us who left halfway through because of the information we were given. \n\nAnyways, onto the review for these delicious pastries: \n\nThe cruffin was AMAZING! The flavor we got was strawberry cheesecake with a balsamic reduction. It was SO good! Even though this place has so much hype and I had to stand in line for an hour, the cruffin did not disappoint! If you live in SF or just visiting, this is one place you MUST GO!\n\nWe also tried the stuffed donuts - raspberry lemon and chocolate. Definitely recommend these, especially if you have a huge sweet tooth because they are extremely sweet.\n\nThe chocolate croissant was pretty good, but it didn't taste much different to me than others I've tried at bakeries across the bay. \n\nTo counteract all this sweetness, we also got the mushroom danish which was also just ok. Maybe it would be better if it was warm? But to me is just tasted like a flaky (kind of dry) danish with some very lightly seasoned mushroom topping - nothing too special or overwhelming.\n\nBasically (TL;DR), GO HERE FOR THE CRUFFINS! \n\nJust a tip, if you want to get more pastries besides just the cruffin, send someone to stand in the pastries line while the rest of your party is waiting for cruffins.

Went this saturday morning and ended up arriving at 8:15 and there were already about 20 people in line.. We thought we were doomed but turns out we were there at just the right time. The first people in line said they had gotten there at 7:15/7:30a but why bother going That early. People later in line still get the same cruffins. Hence, 8:15 is the sweet spot. However, be warned, you can't go too much later or they will run out.\n\nGeneral information:\n2 Cruffin per person/sticker limit\nCruffin ONLY line to the left\nAll other pastries to the right. Cannot get Cruffins in this line.\nCruffin's are available at 9a.\nOther pastries start at 8a on weekends.\n\nLike other reviews say, you get into the cruffin line and around 8:45a they hand out stickers that help them identify that you were in the cruffin line. Note, just because you have a sticker does not reserve you a cruffin. If you aren't in the line, they'll sell the cruffins to the next person in line. So, if you are in the line to the right you won't be guaranteed a cruffin if you go back to the cruffin line later.\n\nEverything smelled amazing and all the pastries were delicious. Honestly, the cruffin just tastes like a croissant but in the shape of a muffin. But it's really well done. The cruffin is extremely crisply and flaky and the matcha green tea flavor they had that day was on point. I also really liked the Amelie Amagn. Some people really like the donuts but I thought they were just ok. It was a bit too oily for me, but the passion fruit filling packed a really flavorful sweet punch.\n\nEverything was about $3-$5. Weekend parking on nearby alleys are metered starting from 9a-6p.

Got ready, left Oakland at 7:20 AM. Got to the city at 8:25. Stood in line. Received a sticker a few minutes later. Still did not receive cruffins until another half hour later. If patience is not your strong suit, you may want to send a friend to grab a cruffin for you, but heads up, they are limited to 2 per person! \n\nDoes all this sound crazy and irrational? Yes. But with all the hype surrounding this place, I had to try it at least once. My friend has been there before so he showed me all the ropes. Get there super early to line up for a sticker, which allows you to get those cruffins. If you're too late, too bad. There's a separate line for their other pastries, which isn't as long as the cruffin line. Once I got my two cruffins, I went to the other line to fill up my box. Donuts, choux bombs, and a savory danish. I was on campus visiting friends and was like Santa, walking around with that gorgeous white and gold box, passing out baked goods to everyone I came across.\n\nThe cruffin is very good--but it's really just a croissant in the shape of a muffin. With all the hype and the cute name, I thought it was somehow a mix of a croissant and muffin, which drew my curiosity to the place. Still, the pastries are VERY good here. Flaky, light, and airy. The donuts are especially good, and my friend raved about the savory danish. Would I ever come back and wait in the cruffin line again? Probably not, because that was way too much effort. Definitely something to try at least once though, and the other pastries are worth coming back for.", "author": "Angela L."}

I especially enjoyed their California croissant, the smoked salmon and seaweed make this savory croissant unique and extremely flavorful. If I could have one for breakfast everyday I totally would. Their cookies and doughnuts are equally amazing and their salted caramel filling is to die for. \n\nMy one complaint- the filling they use for their caramel/Apple cruffin was just not my cup of tea. The pastry to filling ratio was a little off. I'm all about biting into a ooey/gooey pastry, but this cruffin just had too much filling. I wish I had gone on a day they had their chocolate cruffins, but I definitely look forward to going back for more. Idk about pastry crazes, first there was the cronut and now the cruffin, but apart from the hype, the cruffin's dough was light, buttery, and apart from the filling very good. \n\nCan't wait to go back and trying more things on their menu.

Also a lot of filling and the outside was still fluffy, even 10 hours later! \nFerrero rocher choux bomb($4):not really a fan of but my brother enjoyed it a lot. Also tastes like nutella, there was just way too much filling for me\nSavory danish($4): highly recommend, i ate this after i tried all the other pastries because i just felt sick from eating too much sweets and this was perfect for that!

The one thing everyone raves about, the one thing that I woke up and made a long trek for, was not even made yet. I resigned myself to settle for something else, mentally making a note to deduct an entire star from what could've been a perfect 5-star rating. I got the amelia aman, the raspberry danish, and the maple almond bostock.\n\nThe aman blew my mind: it was glazed, flaky, and just perfectly sweet. And the danish was excellent.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-30", "description": "On some very good advice, my partner and I embarked on an early morning adventure to check out the much talked about Mr Holmes Bakehouse. And boy, did it not disappoint! Can't say that I've ever lined up for baked goods before, but I can see why.\n\nWe visited on a Monday morning. The bakery itself opens at 8am, but the infamous cruffins do not hit the shelf until 9am. We arrived roughly 40min prior to cruffin time. So we took some time to take an obligatory selfie infront of the fluoro lights, and bought some of the other goodies to keep us going before lining up for cruffin time.\n\nFor a Monday, the line grew pretty heftily so we were lucky we decided to still get in early.\n\nWe went overload on our sugar breakfast, but it was worth it. We tried the salted dark chocolate cruffin, pineapple mango and cherry doughnuts, the choux, and the Blueberry bostock. Everything was amazing. We were very impressed that the fillings were extremely generous. The custard was a delicious consistency and the salted chocolate in the cruffin was in particular TO DIE FOR. Perfect combination of salty and sweet. I never thought I was a fan of cronuts. And this may be because back home, I've not had a good one. This cruffin however was perfect. A pastry flakiness, soft and not hard or over cooked. Well covered with sugar. A lot of filling. Amazing. The cream choux was our second favourite. The thick cream was like a cream cheese. Delicious flavour and so fresh. Followed closely by the pineapple mango filled doughnut. A perfect dough consistency - soft, chewy and fresh with a lot of filling - delectable custard with great flavour.\n\nThe coffee was pre-made. It was ok, something to keep you going whilst waiting in the cruffin line. But nothing special. \n\nService was the only thing that slightly let the whole picture down. Whilst the team were efficient and answered all questions, it would be a refreshing compliment to the amazing food if it was at least service with a smile. Nothing would suit the cool and chic air of the store like some bubbly, cheerful service. That and perhaps a coffee machine with some equally great coffee beans would see for an excellent overall experience here. \n\nAll in all a good time had, and can't wait to return.", "author": "Rachel A."}

Is it worth standing in line for?  Is it worth spending $ on? Yes! Yes! and Yes!\n\nTruth be told, I am a sucker for sweets and I am usually willing to wait in crazy long lines for the latest craze.  Heck, I made my husband take the subway w/ me on our last day in NY for some cronuts.  Thankfully, the line for Mr. Holmes is nothing compared to NY's and I like how my native hometown have much more selection too! :) I know they are here to stay!\n\nWhile I prefer my kouign\u2011amann elsewhere over Holmes' amelie amagn, I come here for their other amazing goodies such as the infamous cruffins, CA rolls + savory fares, and donuts.  What's so special about a donut you may ask?  While something as simple as a donut can be easily over looked, Mr. Holmes makes them so onolicious that it reminds me of the yummy, fluffy malasadas I've had in Hawaii.  My very first Holmes donut was their Salted Caramel and I was immediately hooked the moment I took my first sugary bite - delicious and not too sweet with filling oozing out.  I've been a fan since and have gone back to also try out their Passion Fruit, Strawberries n Cream, and Vanilla donuts, all very tasty and bursting with fresh flavors as well.  My only disappointment was that my passion fruit donuts weren't as filled as the rest.  Not sure if it was because I came on a weekend for those but I bought a box to share with friends and they all had the same complaint, they were only able to get the filling in one or two bites and the rest was more like a plain malasada.  Other than that, the passion fruit flavor we were able to taste was still great.\n\nNow onto the savories, I don't often go into a bake shop expecting them to master both their sweets and savories but Mr. Holmes does both so well!  I love how the CA roll pays homage to the Japanese culture and if that is not available, give either their mushroom or artichoke croissants a try, those will blow you away too!\n\nSaving the best for last, how can I forget the cruffins?!?  The idea of a croissant + muffin hybrid is genius and in my honest opinion, way better than a cronut since it's not as oily.  Plus, the amazing fillings Mr. Holmes comes up with to stuff each of them, I'm in love!!  I've stood in the cruffin line 3 times so far and my current favorite is their Super Matcha Kruffin.  Anything matcha is always great, but when you top an already delicious cruffin with a matcha marshmallow, how the heck do you beat that?!?  While it sucks that I am only limited to 2 unless I bring an entourage with me, I think the system is fair in allowing everyone to try a piece of this heavenly sweet.  It's nice that they are consistent with the times too, they come out at 9am sharp every morning.  I do suggest that you get here earlier than 9am to stand (if not start) the line but if you get a chance to come on the weekdays, I have gotten pretty lucky with getting some even arriving shortly after 9.  Plus, it's great conversing with fellow sweets fans in line, I even met someone that came all the way from Seattle to check it out!\n\nThank you Baker X and his staff for constantly whipping up new flavors to keep all of us Holmies addictively excited!  :)", "author": "Janetto L."}

It has a lightly sweet glaze on the outside, which made it that much better.\n\nAmelie Amann - Their rendition of the kouign amann. Essentially croissant dough baked with an outer coating of sugar. It was buttery and delicious, but I personally still prefer b. patisserie's kouign amann.\n\nAlmond Bostock - Brioche topped with frangipane. I highly recommend this baby.

Obviously if I endured the line for the cronut on the east coast, I will for sure be doing it for the cruffin on the west side. This review is if you are going on a weekday. I was going to attempt to do it on a weekend but when the opportunity arose where I didnt have to wait 1.5 hours with a \"shorter\" line, then I was all for it. I am a a crazy person and I was planning to spend all day in SF so I made the trek from San Jose to SF on a Thursday morning. I left at 7:30 and arrived a little before 9am.There is plenty of parking on a weekday that you have to pay for but you may have to go a block or two away. The whole process will take you less than an hour. I got in line and there were about 30-40 people ahead of me. Yes, it is true that there is a separate line for cruffins so if you want the other goodies, then you can skip the line. You are limited to 2 cruffins at a time. There are so many options to choose from and likely you will be purchasing the actual box for all your goods. I didnt get to the front of the line until 9:30 so much sure you give yourself enough time. I am so sad they ran out of the double baked croissant so if you have a friend, make sure they get it first and then they join you for the cruffin line. I spent $30 on 7 pastries. Jeez. There is a small area where you can stand at the counter or sit on those stools. It was a nice experience to have but I dont think I would endure the lines for pastries. I go for the hype...on to the next!\n\n1) Cruffin- Yes this is why I came here. That day was matcha flavor. They do not tell you what the flavor will be that day but yolo. I am not the hugest fan of matcha so I just dealt with it. This is quite messy to eat and flakes will explode everywhere. To be honest, it is more of a croissant that is shaped like a cruffin. No crazy taste or anything but I respect the idea. Honestly, you cannot beat the cronut.\n2) California Croissant- This is the salmon savory croissant which was nice to have in my mix of sweet stuff. This is good\n3) Amelie amann- this is a tiny thing that is covered in pure sugar with more sugar inside. Meh\n4) Caramel Donut- So much caramel in a basic donut\n5) Choux Bomb- I had to get this because it was Ferrero Rocher flavor. The cream is exactly like that but since I didnt eat it until hours later, it was a bit soggy. Bloop\n6) Brioche with blueberry & white chocolate- I liked the fresh blueberries.

Bakery opens up shop at 7am, everything but the cruffins are out and cruffins come out at 9am with a limit of 2 cruffins per person.\n\nFor those who don't know what a cruffin is, it's a crossiant x muffin. Shaped like a muffin, filled with cream but has a flaky croissant exterior as opposed to your typical flour and egg muffin mixture. Very much like a churro too as it uses a cinnamon and sugar dusting! Flavors varies everyday, check their website or instagram for weekly flavor updates!\n\nPastries:\n-Cruffin: Tastes like a churro in terms of flavoring but has the flakiness of a crossiant and the burst of sweetness like a jelly filled donut. Yummy but if you don't like super sweet stuff, you might not be able to finish the whole thing. Somewhat hard to eat too because the filling tends to leak out as you bite in, \n-California Croissant: A croissant filled with a sushi roll served with a packet of soy sauce on the side. I prefer to eat this without the soy sauce. A little bit odd but it works.\n-Pesto Turkey Danish: OMG, it's so good, I've had a bite of the brown ale onion one and that was tasty too. I can only suspect that ALL of their savory danishes are super yummy. You can't ever go wrong with danishes. \n-Donuts: Donut flavors varies everyday, you can also check the daily donut flavor on their website or Instagram! Had the lychee donut and was surprised the filling wasn't tooth aching sweet, it was actually really yummy! BF had the Guinness chocolate donut, said it tastes like Guinness at first and then the chocolate sweetness kicks in and cancels out the bitterness of the beer! WOW!\nStrawberry Jalapeno Brioche Bomb: Wow, this thing packs a tiny kick to it. Most jalapeno flavored stuff don't have a kick to it but this thing does! I really liked it, the bread was nice and chewy and filled with just the right amount of jam!\n\nVerdict: \nDefinitely grab some pastries from here, you'll find yourself inhaling the whole thing and suffering from food withdrawals once you realize you've devoured it all!\n\nTips:\n-Get here early, preferably before noon.\n-Get the cruffin if there are any left, if none, get anything else, everything is just as yummy!\n-You need 6 or more items to get one of those fancy smancy boxes!", "author": "Kelly L."}

I agree with the hype. \n\nI came here on a Saturday and made sure I was in the right line. There's one for just Cruffins and then a line for everything else. \n\nIf you want to come, come with another person. They hold your spot in the Cruffins line while you can go get some other goodies. The regular stuff opens up earlier than the Cruffins. I must say it's SO smart of them to do this, sell out of most of their regular stuff and then when the cruffins are ready, they are sold out and can close shop for the day. Smart! \n\nCruffins are one flavor each day (supposedly) and you are limited to two per person (drag some people with you if you want more than two). The day we were there it was a Torched Meringue Coffee Creme Cruffin. It was really good but for me, the meringue made it too sweet. The coffee creme wasn't super sweet so it was nice. It's super flaky, kinda hard to eat, but if you're at home and sitting with your coffee, no big deal. \n\nAlso, I heard they aren't selling wholesale anymore so I think the bakery will have more goodies for everyone. \n\nOk, I will be first to admit I am NOT a breakfast fan, nor a pastry fan at all. So when I say I didn't hate any of the items I got, it's saying a whole lot. \n\nSushi Croissant: I was most intrigued by this. It comes with a side of soy sauce, which isn't needed because it borderlines a little too salty. BUT I loved this. It was delicious. I wish I was the one who woke up thinking... let's put sushi into a croissant, genius. \nHam & Cheese Danish: Delicious, it comes with a dijon mustard sauce. \nArtichoke Danish: This was really yummy. Filled with artichoke and a gravy underneath. \nPassionfruit/Banana Donut: Ok, I'll admit it was kind of hard to tell the flavors of Banana but once you ate the passionfruit one, you knew which was which. It's kinda like a filled malasada. Delicious, but I'm not a super fan of the sweetness. \n\nI'd actually come for the regular stuff over the Cruffin. While it was good, I think my palate is just geared for the savory than the sweet. My mom, however, LOVED the flakiness of the Cruffin so I'll be back in that line to pick her up some. \n\nYum!", "author": "Jeannie L."}

The prices on the receipt reflect the pre-tax price, from which when you add 8.5 or whatever % to it, equates to the price displayed on the placards in front of the baked goods. Notwithstanding this admitted stupidity of mine, I would like to say that Mr. Holmes is still as delicious as ever, and that even though their pastries are slightly more pricy than the average baked good, it is well worth it. I don't know if it's worth standing in line for 1+ hours for, but it is definitely worth standing in line for up to half an hour.\n\nTheir savories are definitely not as good as their sweets. Whereas their sweet pastries are an amalgam of delicious flavors intermingling in a genius and pleasant manner, the savories that I tried only seemed to have one flavor, which was salty (not that it was too salty or anything, it's just out of all the flavors, it just tasted like salty toppings, on delicious fresh-baked bread)\n\nFrom my old review, this still stands:\nThe pastries are delicious. Definitely something you'd want to enjoy on the same day you buy it as the crunchy crispy glaze on almost everything will be gone after a few hours. Nonetheless, it's still delicious next day, but definitely not the same.", "author": "Joshua L."}

Strawberry jalape\u00f1o brioche bomb? Most interesting combination of flavors with a kung-fu kick, could be 15% moister though. Donuts and chocolate croissants were equally on point. \n\nWhat was seriously unfortunate were the unfriendly and snarky employees, who were impatient to our questions. How dare we ask them what flavors the donuts were and what were their favorites! \n\nIf they were labeled individually with each flavor and not just generally labeled under \"donuts\" we wouldn't have to ask you. \n\nIt was incredulous how two employees were yelling at the customers on a Saturday morning.

I first decided to get the california crossiant and a white chocolate donut. Then we went in line for the cruffins. The wait wasn't too bad but it wasn't short. \n\nI thought the white chocolate donut wasn't that great. It just tasted like a regular donut that was filled with some type of custard. The california crossiant was actually really delicious. It's basically kind of like sushi in a croissant. I've never seen anything like it so it was cool to try. The cruffin was really good, but I actually expected more from it. I might have set too high standards for it but it did taste great but not spectacular. \n\nI think another thing besides the cruffins that drew me to this place was the I got baked in San Fransisco sign.

I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time after seen countless mouth-watering photos of their pastries, especially their cruffins!!! Just dreaming about how they would taste... omg. Visiting this place has been on my list and I am so glad I got to finally try this place. A cruffin is basically a croissant + muffin, hence CRU-FFIN. Cool huh? Their cruffin flavors changes everyday so you will not know what cruffin you will get! This makes it more exciting and suspense, hahah! Definitely try to go on a weekday. I heard the lines on the weekends wrap around the corner! :O I made sure to set my alarm clock at 8am sharp.. didn't get up til 8:30.. IT'S OK, didn't matter, I got ready 10x faster. I needed to get those cruffins!\n\nMy boyfriend thought I was crazy waking up at 8am for pastries. BUT I had to do what I had to do, and of course, drag him along with me. Tag team duo. We left the house around 9am or so. The cruffin line starts at 9am. I was reading the past reviews as we were driving there and was afraid there wouldn't be any cruffins left! My heart sank and my anxiety went up. \n\nWe got there around a little after 9:30am and quickly got out of the car! There was a line, however it was short to my surprise. ^___^ There were about 15 people in front of us. And as we got closer to the front of the line, I peeked through the window and was ecstatic to see about 40 cruffins left!! WHOO. OMG. Super duper relieved! I had to contain myself to not make a scene.. did not want to look like a crazy lady being overjoyed by pastries.. \n\nEach person is limited to just 2 cruffins. Today's flavor was flutternutter! This was a peanut butter + marshmallow cream inside topped with peanut butter fluff + chopped peanuts. Pretty good. I was really hoping for the matcha cruffin because I love matcha... but it's okay, because I will be back on the hunt for that flavor! I was happy with the flutternutter. It was flaky and yummy. The cream was not too sweet! However, I did not really taste the marshmallow mix, it definitely tasted more peanut buttery-- but I would come back to try the other several cruffin flavors. I also really wanted the box that comes with the pastries. If you order 6-7 pastries, you get the box. So of course, I had to get the box, duh. \n\nAlong with the cruffins, we got the amelie amann, choux bomb, banana cream filled donut, coconut cream filled donut, and a negroni cream filled donut. The negroni was my least favorite. There is alcohol in this one. You can taste the alcohol in the cream so I was not too big of a fan... The banana and coconut cream filled donuts were pretty good. The banana was my favorite out of the three brioche donuts. The donuts just had the right amount of sweetness! The choux bomb had a slight taste of ferrero rocher. It was not very strong. Additionally, there was way too much cream in the middle and the cream was just eh. Overall, I just thought it was okay. The amelie amann was crispy, good, and flaky. However, I did not think it was anything spectacular. \n\nYou have to come here at least once, to at least try their cruffins. It is pretty pricy... so beware... Don't be surprised when your box of pastries come out to be $$$... your wallet may be crying but you will be oh so happy that you got to try this place LOL.\n\nYay for Mr. Holmes!", "author": "Kimberly H."}

We would sleep over our friend's place on Saturday night and wake up early to get some fresh pastries. Got to the bakery at 7:40am in my pajamas thinking we will just be in and out, but I was so wrong. There was a sign there that said the cruffins wouldn't arrive until 9am (should have read the Yelp reviews lol), so we waited in line. I watched the line for future visits and if you arrive around 8:30 (maybe it was a slow Sunday though) then you shouldn't have any trouble getting some cruffins. They usually sell out by 9:30-10am on the weekends, so be early.\n\nWe had the chocolate chip cruffin and it was good, but so much muffiny though. The custard is a flavorful without being too sweet and perfectly flaky as a croissant. I would like to try other cruffin flavors, but it wouldn't be the end of the world if they sold out. \n\nOther pastries worth trying: Sweet Onion Danish is a great savory pastry with a crunch, California Croissant is interesting but it doesn't taste awful, Ferrero Rocher choux bomb is flaky not too sweet deliciousness, and the filled donuts were light and fluffy. \n\nThe only thing we would pass on is the coffee, maybe it was a bad batch but it tasted burnt.\n\nI hate waiting for food, but its worth waiting in line at least once or maybe twice. :)", "author": "Mimi N."}

Everyone is restricted to 2 cruffins per person. Be aware that the weekend will require you to line up even earlier.\n\nSo I came last Friday right at 8am which was nice because meters don't start charging until 9am. Cruffins weren't out yet but we got to buy some of their other popular items. By 8:35am there were 2 separate lines outside, one for cruffins and one for the general pastries. \n\nNow onto the pastries that I've had the chance to try the 4 times I've been here!\n- Strawberry Milk Shake Cruffins: Cruffins taste very similar to cronuts, it's just their shape that resembles a muffin. The strawberry cream filling was so good! \n- Coffee Cruffins: Mr. Holmes usually changes his flavor daily now and only provides one flavor a day. The coffee cream filling and the visible flaky layers of this beautiful pastry really stole the show. I actually like this flavor more than the strawberry one.\n- Matcha Strawberry Cruffins: really like this combo but the strawberry overpowered the matcha a bit.\n- Chocolate Hazelnut Cruffins: this tasted like a Ferrero Rocher in every bite, pretty amazing!\n- California/Sushi Croissant: Definitely recommend trying this if you like salmon! It's like a fun fusion between the French & the Japanese.\n- Artichoke Croissant: I actually waited to go home to heat this up which made it taste way better. I wish they would have the option to heat these up for us here...\n- Donuts: We had 1 vanilla cheesecake and 1 salted caramel donut. They were great donuts but I probably would skip on these next time in comparison to the other selections.\n\n\n(NOTE: I GOT PLAYED! So right before I got into Mr. Holmes to redeem my cruffin, this girl appeared out of no where stating how she ONLY wanted to get the other pastries and NOT the cruffin. Since the line for no-cruffins disappeared, I felt bad. She even swore she wasn't trying to play me so the part of me that believed in humanity let her through.

My lifelong dream of being on TV was fulfilled when I was interviewed at Mr. Holmes Bakehouse. I have this clip recorded if anyone's interested. But sorry, I don't have time to sign autographs right now. I must give my undivided attention to writing this review, because this place is DOPE. \n\nMy friend stumbled upon it when it first opened, and urged me to try this amazing cruffin- a croissant muffin, not to be confused with the cronut. I started following Mr. Holmes on Instagram, and it was obvious they were really starting to gain traction. You can no longer stroll in to pick up some cruffins. It's an intense competition now.\n\nIF YOU'RE READING THIS, IT'S NOT TOO LATE: The bakery opens at 8 AM, and I suggest you get there early. Two lines are formed- one exclusively for cruffins, the other for everything else. Cruffins come out at 9 AM, and they sell out within the first 30 minutes. You are limited to 2 per person. If your mission isn't the cruffin, you can sleep in- there are plenty of other baked goods.  \n\nMy friends and I snagged 6 cruffins, a Ferrero Rocher choux bomb, lemon poppy seed bread, vanilla custard donut, apple cinnamon scone, berry citrus tart, Amelie amann, and white chocolate blueberry brioche bomb. 65% of that was for me. They don't even like sweets that much, but hey, we got on TV, so everybody's happy.\n\nThe cruffin flavor of the day was honeycomb caramel. It's truly DIVINE and totally worth the wait. When asked to describe what it tasted like during my interview, I told the ABC news correspondent, \"It tastes like a sugary croissant.\" I swear it was the editing that made me sound like an idiot. It looks like a muffin, but the similarities stop there. The dough is light and flaky with a cream filling, dusted with sugar and topped off with MORE cream. It is not easy to eat given how tall the pastry is, and it will leave a trail of crumbs on your face/hair/shirt. We were asked to take a bite on camera, and I'm so relieved that ended up on the cutting room floor. Really, NOBODY looks graceful while eating. \n\nIf you can't get your lazy ass out there before cruffins sell out, don't leave disappointed. The vanilla custard donut, berry citrus tart, and Ferrero Rocher choux bomb are all marvelous! Or there's always TaskRabbit.

Their other stuff is just as good and there is no wait - generally - for that stuff.\n\nOn two visits, here's what I've had:\n-Amelie amann - their version of the kouign amann, with rose pistachio filling, is divine. Crispy, flaky, and sweet. This is what a kouign amann should always be and rarely is.\n-Butter (plain) croissant - so simple, in theory, but so hard to pull off. They rose to the challenge. One of my favorite croissants ever.\n-Doughnut - clearly a brioche dough, and so much better for it. Puffy, soft and pillowy - yum! Went with salted caramel filling.\n-California croissant - who would take a california (sushi) roll and replace the outer layer of rice with a croissant? These guys! And it's delicious.\n-Cruffin - fantastic! Crispy, flaky croissant dough, coated in sugar and then filled with a flavored cream. How could you go wrong? You can't, with them.\n\nFor the future: want to try their chocolate chip cookie, the almond croissant, the chocolate croissant (pain au chocolat), and some of the danish.", "author": "David B."}

I had discovered them on instagram and really wanted to go there.  Luckily I did on my second day!  \n\nMy friends and I got a later start to our morning than anticipated and decided to go to Mr. Holmes for breakfast. I had known about the cruffin from instagram, but I didn't know if there were rules or anything like getting a cronut (ie when they start selling them, if there is a limit, etc..) so we just showed up.  We got there around 8:30 and there was a small line formed outside the store.  The store itself is pretty tiny, and it was open up for customers to buy anything except the cruffin, which they start selling at 9:00. So we got in line, which wasn't too bad, although we went on a Thursday morning so it might be worse on the weekends.  I went in and got something to hold me over till 9:00. There were so many good looking options, but I went with the ham and cheese danish. It was really good, and had a nice flaky crust.  There was even some mustard in the middle, which I normally hate, but I didn't seem to mind too much and easily finished off the whole thing.  One of my friends got an interesting croissant. I think it was called the California croissant and had seaweed, wasabi and tuna inside.  It looked like it also had some seeds on the outside.  I didn't try it, but my friend enjoyed it. Another friend got a regular croissant which I had a bite of that was really good!  It was sweeter than I would normally think of a croissant being, and I really liked that.   \n\nThen 9:00 rolled around and they started to serve their cruffins!  That day's flavor was creamsicle, and it was so good!  I just got one for myself, it didn't seem like they had a limit on how many you could buy.  I asked them how many they make each day and they said about 130-150, and they usually sell out in an hour.  So if you want a cruffin I'd say get there early. I think when we got there at 8:30 we were maybe 15th in line and more people kept coming after us.  \n\nI really liked the cruffin.  It was nice and crispy, and flaky!  The filling was really good too, and not too much of it.  Go early to try a cruffin, but really just go anytime and try something!", "author": "Rachel W."}

I got in line about 8:35 am on a Saturday and it was almost to the corner.  I was not sure if I would get their infamous cruffin or not.  Reading the reviews, I guess people line up about 7 am..WOW!!  Anyways, aboout 10 min til 9am, a worker comes around and passes the \"golden sticker\", which guarantees you to a minimum of 2 cruffin.  Note:  DO NOT LEAVE THE LINE!  There were people who left the line to line up on their non-cruffin line and realized when they got back to the cruffin line, they missed out.  I think the last person who got the last cruffin was in line at 8:50 am.  Maybe I was lucky to get a cruffin to come at 8:35.  It may be different depending on the weekend you go.\n\nSo, I got my cruffin and the flavor was chooclate carmel!  How did I like?  I liked it, I didn't love it, but I liked it.  Oh ya, I got to the front to get my cruffin at about 9:30 am, so not bad of a wait.  The cruffin was flakey and alittle messy since it is a crossiant shaped like a muffin with chocolate in the middle and carmel and chocoalte on top.  Once I got my cruffin at the cruffin line, I went to line-up in the non-cruffin line to try their other pastries - I was not going to leave after waiting in line for just a cruffin.  So I picked up amelie amann and a scone.  The amelie amann was nice, sticky and flakey and the scone moist.  Both were surprises and I would defitnitely come back and get them again.  \n\nOverall, it was a good foodie experience.  Here are my final thoughts:\n - Cruffin:  It was good, not great,  I would come back if a friend wanted to pick one up.  It iis alittle gimcky / novelty to line up and try it out.\n -  The Box:  They have the nicest box to put your pastrries in!!  The best than any bakery I been to - seriously!!  The only issue with the box is that I wish they had a cruffin holder inside the box to hold up the cruffin.  One of my cruffin tilted and the filling would spill out..=(\n- The employees - awesome.  Very friendly which made the experience even so much better.\n - The Other pastires - excellent and I would swing by again to pick them up again.", "author": "James L."}

Maybe this isn't a totally fair review on account of the fact that I've never been into the store, but I felt a need to express my love and gratitude for the cruffin. It's a crispy, sugary croissant-muffin hybrid filled with ooey-gooey goodness. I am usually not a fan of fruity mystery custard, but it was excellent stuffed inside the cruffin. The other assorted pastries that filled the box were just as tasty and unique as the cruffin. \n\nNow here's the thing about Mr. Holmes, the early bird (and ONLY the early bird) catches the worm. The cruffin is usually sold out by 9 or 10 AM so you better set your alarm if you want one. You could also be waiting awhile to get your sugar-high, so bring a friend or spend some time catching Pokemon. Part of the hype about Mr. Holmes, if the hype itself. It's part of the experience to get up early, wait in line, and finally get your box of treats. If you're visiting SF, it's a must!

Frankly I don't even like pastries but the uniqueness and craft of the Cruffin is rather enticing, especially if you appreciate cooking (or baking) and I read that it is an extremely intricate process of cutting and layering the dough to master one (which is why they can't come out right at 7am). I was also excited to know that there was a hidden gem in the neighborhood that called for attention, as my brother tweeted me an article about it on CNN the day prior which prompted my decision to embark out in my pj's (http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/03/travel/cruffin-shop?sr=fb040715cruffin1aStorygallLink).\n\nThe wait:\nOn a weekday and esp if you live in the city, you can mosey on over between 7:40-8:00 and be one of the first in line (at least the day I went) or show up around 8:15-8:30 for a more moderate wait. I imagine showing up closer to 9 you'd still be okay, but on a Friday or weekend I hear it's much more difficult. There are two lines (the cruffin line and cruffin-free line) on the weekends but getting the other pastries or waiting in line for them if there is one goes by fairly quickly and the taste value is worth almost as much as a Cruffin in my opinion.\n\nPost Cruffin:\nOverall, if you're crazy enough to stand in line for one, you truly won't be disappointed. They were heavenly delicious to me in particular. It was a perfect, crisp, croissant on the outside with a delicious soft filling on the inside. The flavor of the day was Mandarin with Vanilla Custard. I think it's such a better binge than a Cronut, which I also stood in line for at Domnique Ansel's bakery in New York.\n\nOther delicacies: \nThe plus side is that the bakery opens at 7am and if you don't care to wait for a Cruffin, they still have so many delicious pastries to try.

I still like the kouign amann from b patisserie. I still prefer donuts from krispy kremes (i know i know) but where else can you get a cruffin? they are crispy, sweet, chewy on the outside, soft and filled with luxurious cream on the inside.", "author": "claudia y."}

The whole experience was great! you do have to get there early if you want a cruffin since they hand out stickers to those in line, which I didn't know. Another thing I didn't know was that you have a limit of 2 per sticker. While waiting in line, we decided to order some pastries (you can walk right in). My favorite would be the Turkey Pesto Danish. I would come back for this alone! Everything else I tried was good, but wouldn't make me crave for it. \n\nAs for the star of the show! We got the Cookies and Cream Cruffin and it was amazing! I thought it would be too sweet with all the filling, but it wasn't at all! The cuffin itself was very light and airy.

Wish I had stayed in bed.  So not worth the wait....cruffins are tasty enough but their operation is terrible.  They open at 8, but cruffins aren't available until 9.  So they constantly have 2 lines...1 for just cruffins and 1 for everything else.  I asked the person at the counter why that was and she said because it takes so long to prepare the dough that the cruffins are literally still in the oven when they open.  What?  That just makes no sense to me.  All your other croissant-like pastries are ready right at 8, why can't you just start earlier with the cruffins?  I'm not a baker so forgive me if I'm a bit ignorant about the process but it seems that they make it so much more difficult then it has to be.  \n\nTo make matters worse, their Square wasn't working properly, so they were taking so long to ring up people.  Maybe they should consider using a proper POS system rather than Square...you know since they're now global and all.\n\nPastries are fine but definitely not worth the long wait.  I'd pick b. patisserie instead for better quality pastries, better service and a better experience.", "author": "Tina P."}

The first time, we came way too late (I think around 11:30 am?) and I foolishly asked if they still had cruffins. Then I realized that you have to get there at least by 8:30am to secure a spot for the elusive cruffin. So naive! My friends and I got a sausage roll, a banana donut, and a chocolate chip cookie. The sausage roll was a bit too salty, but the banana donut and cookie were delicious! The donut was the highlight.\n\nThe second time, I was determined to get the cruffin. My boyfriend and I ran up and down some hills before running over to Mr. Holmes so we could earn our treat. Thank god we did that because we ordered SO much for two people! We got a couple green tea cruffins, a California croissant, a ham and cheese croissant, a strawberry donut, a choux bomb, and an apple puff pastry.\n\nGreen tea cruffin - bomb. It was so incredibly flaky and the green tea filling wasn't too sweet at all. Definitely worth the hype.\nCalifornia croissant - I was really excited about this, but it was way too salty. The croissant itself was extremely delicious, but the salmon filling was too much. They even provide soy sauce on the side, but that would've been sodium overkill!\nHam and cheese croissant - hard to screw this up, but it was good!\nstrawberry donut - good, but a bit too sweet. I preferred the banana donut.\nChoux bomb - SO GOOD. I love Fererro Rocher, and they nailed the flavor. Wasn't too sweet.\n\nI didn't get to try the apple pastry because we gave it to someone else. Overall, this is a great bakery, but there are some hits and misses. I feel like some of the fillings are too salty or too sweet. The pastry itself is delicious, but the filling can be too overwhelming. I wouldn't be able to finish the sausage roll or the California croissant by myself.\n\nAlso, everything was SO BEAUTIFUL. The pastries, the decor, the boxes...definitely picture-worthy.\n\nI would come back for their cruffins, the choux bomb, and to try some of their plainer stuff!", "author": "Lisa N."}

YES! A couple of more months of no frill delicious pastries!", "author": "Jessica D."}

So, of course, the moment that one of my bikini sisters told me about Mr. Holmes Bakehouse, I had to make the Saturday morning dash after my morning gym session (EARN THOSE SWEETS, FOLKS!).  I totally did a face smash on a Strawberry Vanilla CRUFFIN after back and biceps.  OHHH EMM GEE!  So deliciously sinful that I had to share with my BFF and bikini sister, Sarah Chang.  \n\nI also ordered an apple-cardamom scone (eh) and a banana cream filled do-nut.  Both of which I did end up sharing with other people.  They weren't half as tasty as that amazingly delcious and flakey CRUFFIN and I decided that moving forward, I would wisely invest any daily macros/calories in CRUFFINS.\n\nThere also were some savory goods that I wanted to try next time, which won't be for another month or so.\n\nI read some reviews from nay-sayers and I have to admit, I don't see it.

I was only about 20-ish people in so it wasn't too bad.  I assumed it was the line for cruffins since there was only 1 line, but based on other reviews, there usually are 2 lines.  My friend went to the front of the store to check if we were in the right line, then came back to tell me that the line for cruffins was on the other side.  Obviously, we split up and managed to be the 1st in lines for the infamous cruffins!  Either everyone else in line didn't care for cruffins, or they weren't aware there was a separate line.  Either case, my friend and I were guaranteed to get one!  Once the bakery opened at 8am, I waited for my turn to order and got enough pastries for my friend and I, which we ate while waiting for the cruffins to come out at 9am.  A sticker is handed out to everyone in the cruffin line around 8:50am, which guarantees that they would get one.  No sticker = no cruffin.\n\nWe went a little crazy and bought practically 75% of the pastries that were available that day, and I have to say that i loved everything!  We bought extra so we could eat the next day, and they are equally as good if you re-heat them in the toaster oven.  The reason why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the amount of sugar they add on all of the sweet pastries.  Had to rub off the sugar on the donuts and cruffin.\n\nNotes:\n*  2 cruffin limit per person\n*  there are 2 different lines (be sure to read the signs on the windows) - one for cruffins, one for everything else\n*  box of pastries:  minimum 6 items, or they will charge $1.50 for the box\n*  Banana Chocolate Toffee Cruffin:  right amout of sweetness, banana flavor is not overpowering\n*  Mango Ginger Donut:  mango ginger cream is light, and not too sweet.  ginger flavor is subtle\n*  California Croissant:  crispy, flakey, and buttery.  can't ask for anything better\n*  Kouign Aman:  croissant on crack", "author": "Melanie T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-20", "description": "Sometimes visiting another bakery gives me an existentialist crisis as a baker, and this place definitely made me question myself the most (in a good way). If you live in SF, please support these guys, the pastries are amazing!! Super creative without being dogmatic (i.e. wayy better than Craftsman or Tartine's pastries, on par with b.patisserie). \n\nI was luckily invited to a tasting party, and the items that I tried were..\n\n- twice baked croissants filled with strawberry jam & curd: jammy, fruity, dense aromatic goodness. It borders on being too sweet for me, but I'd stuff myself with it if it's within my vicinity. It was sort of a laminated, haute version of a pop tart \n\n- ferrero Roche choux pastries (think hazelnut praline):  this was my favorite. The texture was excellent; crunchy bits of craquelins and creamy, cold interior. And the hazelnut aroma lingers on your palate too. The sweetness was perfect except for the salted caramel cube; I would be fine without the cube. \n\n- muffin-shaped croissant filled with passion fruit curd and glazed with chocolate icing: Loved the curd. Slightly acidic, great body and consistency, not cloyingly sweet, and fantastic croissant dough. Wished it was dark chocolate instead of the icing. My second favorite!\n\n- \"sushi\" croissant with salmon, wasabi, and furikake served with a packet of soy sauce: I was very skeptical of these type of eccentric pastries, but danggit it works. The wasabi cuts through the richness of the fish and croissant, and it leaves you wanting more. A really nice savory option\n\n- amelie amann: this was their version of a kuignn amann but with a middle eastern twist--rosewater and cardamom. I'm a sucker for rosewater, and cardamom is my favorite spice, so this was an automatic winner too\n\n- brioche with strawberry jam and creme pat: again, great jam and curd. Bread was just a-ok\n\n- chocolate pop with some kind of filling: was too sweet and the only thing I wasn't enamored with. A dark chocolate coating would've balanced out the sweet filling imo\n\nThe people there were very friendly, the coffee was delicious (a lot of SF coffee are pretentiously under-roasted and acidic), and the space was quaint but modern & minimalistic. I would definitely be a regular even if it means possibly getting killed by the lovely residents of Tenderloin. \n\nI wish these guys great success!", "author": "Ray B."}

While many artisanal coffeeshops feature impressive local bakers, Mr. Holmes' goodies especially stood out. I often found myself asking baristas at Fifty/Fifty and Saint Frank, \"Where was this baked? Who is your baker? I must know who is producing this devilish witchcraft of pastries!!\" And they'd always tell me, \"Oh, we have this awesome baker named Mr. Holmes.\" I was like, \"Um who is this Mr. Holmes and can I meet him?!\" (Of course, there is no actual Mr. Holmes. Apparently the bakery is in homage to a cat named Mr. Holmes.) \n\nI started to follow them on Instagram and Facebook and noticed they were establishing a stand-alone store this fall. Naturally, I beamed up with joy and have since awaited their grand opening. Voila! The day has come. On November 22, they opened up a shop in the Tenderloin. I planned to go around opening time at 7 AM, but found myself too sluggish and distracted by the rain. I got to Mr. Holmes around 10:15 and just within three hours, I was told most of their pastries were \"SOLD OUT.\" Bummer. However, I did manage to snag a couple things: a raspberry pistachio brioche and an amelie amann (similar to a kouign-amann). The brioche was stunningly pillowy and light even though it looked dense. It was, thankfully, not too sweet and the raspberry flavor really shined through. The amelie amann was flaky, soft, buttery, sweet, and slightly sticky just like a proper kouign-amann. For the two, it came out to $7.50 -- probably the best seven dollars and fifty cents I've spent in a long time. They also sell coffee to accompany your sweet treat.\n\nKeep in mind, this is a straight-up hole-in-the-wall. There isn't really a place to sit. There are some black crates you can temporarily rest on, but it's definitely not for lounging. The shop is minimally decorated. White hexagonal tiles, big counter, register: boom! That's the store. Oh, and then there's this cheeky little neon sign that says \"I got baked in San Francisco.\" HA. \n\nAnyway, check this joint out.

Unlike the previous experience the chocolate croissant this time was much flakier, suggesting that the one the week before was day old (don't they sell out and close?).  In other words, nothing like the previous one.  The regular croissants were very good as were the savory pastries (I still prefer Hearth, but these are still quite good).  This past week I stopped by at an old one time favorite on Fillmore at Bush, for a chocolate croissant---and an amazingly awful one at that---how can something made with butter and flour have so little butter flavor?  So, while I was disappointed in my soft and chewy chocolate croissant here, even as sad as it was, it was still miles above this other product--whose name will not be advertised by mention!  And, a week later, this bakery had improved/restored the quality.  (I did not identify myself to management, did not ask for refunds or credit or otherwise engage in any deceptive or self serving behavior, and paid for my purchase as one would).\n\n\nMr. Holmes is the place where there were two lines out the door---one to the North and one to the South---when it was new and hot.  It's still the place where you'll see out-of-towners at SFO with their easy-to-spot white and gold boxes.  There's still a line, 'round opening time, but if you're not working that day, the selection is still good a couple of hours later and without the wait, such is the nature of being trendy, and \"In\", and then, so suddenly, not.\n\nEven at its best, it's pastries were still a shadow of those up on 17th, in the Castro, at Hearth (if you had the time to endure the abysmal service there).  A croissant is supposed to be a buttery, flaky, melt-in-your-mouth affair, an ethereal experience in finger food.  Lee's Sandwiches, further down Larkin in Little Saigon, has the exact opposite of a good croissant---the bread like crescent roll.  A croissant and a crescent roll are as different as rolls and pastry---as different as a macaron and a macaroon.  \n\nMr. Holme's used to have fairly flaky croissants---very nearly ethereal, which would describe Hearth's croissants (or Sand Box up on Bernal Heights).  I had a chocolate croissant today and while good, it was chewy, not flaky at all.  Not tough to chew, not gum---no nothing like that.  Instead of being flaky, melt in your mouth buttery, it was chewy.  I've had their donuts at different times. as well as their filled pastries.  All are good, the pastries being generally more flaky than today's chocolate croissant, but hardly the place to wait in line over, let alone fly home with.\n\nI'll go back---it's on my way most everywhere on my day off--but I can't see standing in line.", "author": "Paul T."}

Which also us just made it to the cut off for cuffins sticker. The stickers indicate much cruffins they have available and each person only allow 2 cruffins per sticker. Mr. Holmes starts selling their cruffins at 9am. \nAfter we got our cruffins, we needed to line up on their regular bake good line. The regular bake good line moved way much faster than the cruffin line (Thank goodness ). Overall, we spent over $50 for 2 boxes of pasties. \n\nThe cruffins were very good definitely worth the wait. They were really flakey and the filings were just right. But I wish they didn't used cream on top because once I got home the cream was starting to melt :(  I didn't have a chance to try their regular bake goods. My parents finished them before I got around to them , I guess it's a good sign : )", "author": "Stacy L."}

Get it!\n- California croissant: stuffed with salmon, ginger wasabi, and nori. They give you a soy sauce packet on the side which is unnecessary. Very interesting. Very tasty. If you like smoked salmon then definitely give this a try. \n- Sticky bun:  excellent. Get it. \n- donut: mine was filled with a peanut butter cream, and they're all covered in sugar.  good stuff.  check their instagram for the flavor(s) of the day.\n- ube puff pop tart: meh. Pass.\n\nIf you want their famed cruffin, you have to show up early and wait in a separate line for them and you're limited to 2 per person.  I guess they're worth trying, but I'm not inclined to get one again.  Their other stuff is much better IMO.  My favorites were the savory stuff (california croissant, savory danishes) and the sticky bun.  But don't show up too late bc the pickings are slim later in the day (say, by lunch time?).\n\nAlso, they have some fancy boxes for their pastries, but you have to buy at least 6 to get a box; otherwise, they just put it in a paper bag.", "author": "Ed L."}

It was worth it. It's in a super dicey area and there was syringes on the street as well as a few homeless folks hitting up the people in line for money. Don't block the door to the apartments while standing in line for your cruffin because there's a grumpy ass SF 49er's fan that will let you know how much he hates you and baked goods. Standing in line you get a sticker and then redeem that for your cruffin once they start slinging them at 9 am. We arrived about 8:30 and had 15 people in front of us. 2 per person limit. You can get anything from the regular bakery side whenever you want- no line. The fluorescent sign wasn't working when we came which was kind of a bummer. Check the instagram for Mr. Holmes for a weekly flavor breakdown. We had a coffee flavored cruffin and a raspberry passion fruit donut. Both amazing.

Luckily, I came with another person who was able to stand in the non-cruffin line, otherwise I would have been waiting for days.\n\nTop Choice: Passion Fruit Donut (California croissant was sold out as well)\nOther things tried: Banana cream donut, Strawberry cream donut, croissant, white chocolate blueberry brioche, Amelie amann, apple pie (stop judging!)\n\nThe donuts were all very tasty. Not oily, not super fried, super fluffy, definitely tasty. However, at $3.50 per, I'd suggest getting only the passion fruit. The banana cream and the strawberry cream were good, but nothing special. I've read lots about the white chocolate blueberry brioche but couldn't find the chocolate. Not sure what happened there. \n\nAmelie amann...is definitely not the Kouign Amann from B Patisserie. Smaller, more dense, and about the same price. Advantage: B Patisserie\n\nOther quick tips:\n1) There's two lines. One (probably the longer one), is the cruffin line\n2) People continually get into the cruffin line, and people just wait and wait and wait until someone at the front signals that there's no more left. Said people are left having to move to the \"regular\" item line and waiting even more time to obtain other pastries\n3) Got there at 8:30am on a Saturday morning. Line was super long.

Unfortunately, there's no way to know what flavor cruffin they have beforehand (apparently you can check it out on social media!) so there's an element of luck in getting the flavor you want. In retrospect, we could have picked up some pastries while waiting in line for the cruffins so definitely going to do that next time. \n\nAfter waiting in line, it made sense to max out on the number of cruffins I could buy (max 2 per customer). In retrospect, DON'T unless you can eat it in the next few hours. The cruffins have a custard center which will make the pastry portion a little soggy and not as good as it could be if you wait too long. While the custard core was good (nothing too sugary/heavy), the true star is the actual croissant part. Again, so wonderfully flaky and crispy. It was coffee flavor that day so the bitterness really complemented the lightly sugared dough. \n\nBig fan of their more salty options though so you should definitely come even if they aren't selling cruffins. I tried the California croissants which had great smoked salmon flavor mixed with nori, but I didn't really get any taste of wasabi and ginger that's supposed to be in there. Still delicious though and would recommend. REALLY liked the reuben danish where the pickled sauerkrauts went so well with the saltiness of the pastrami. These pastries have a longer shelf life compared to the cruffins; just warm them up in a toaster oven and it will revive that wonderful flakiness of the croissant dough.

After reading many reviews we decided to show up quite early. It was a Saturday morning and we showed up right around 8:00 and we were the 4th couple in line(7th and 8th in line). I went and got donuts inside while my boyfriend stayed in line. \nDONUTS: The doughnuts were great, very much so like Leonard's malasadas in Hawaii maybe even better. They were raspberry cream flavored and I was quite surprised at how much I liked them. Very soft and just the right amount of filling.\nCRUFFINS: To be honest I did like them. Sugary and crispy, yet fluffy and delicate all at the same time. However I do think they are overhyped. I am definitely going to give them another try because I do think the flavor was a huge aspect of that. It was hummingbird which was a spiced banana with pecans and pineapple. To be honest it was waaaaaaaaaay overspiced and had an extreme clove and nutmeg flavor. I really didn't taste the banana or pineapple at all which was quite disappointing. It was more so just a spiced cruffin. I really hope to try a more exciting flavor like the strawberry milkshake or matcha!", "author": "Alexis T."}

I think it's kind've a poor design. It falls apart pretty easily. It tastes like pudding with coconut sheds and a croissant dipped in cinnamon sugar. Idk I guess there are just better things out there.... \n\nBut yeah he only makes one flavor a day. So get there before 9am and you should be fine. But be prepared to wait about an hour. $4.50 a pop btw. And make sure you grab napkins before you leave.", "author": "Ashley H."}

Visiting this spot I knew there was gonna be a line so I was prepared. We came here on a Saturday at about 8:30am and the line was not that bad at all, if you didn't want CRUFFINS then the line is fast and you can go right and and get other things, but if you want CRUFFINS you have wait in line that only took us about 15 minutes. I enjoyed that the people in line which was friendly and made the experience fun. When you get to enter you get to see the awesome neon lighting, and I've seen it in pictures already but seeing it in person it still very cool! The staff was friendly and the I enjoyed everything about this bakery. The the CRUFFINS was good! and worth a try because not many places make it, the other bakery goods were also very good!

Mostly haven't been here because of the line, oh and because I work at another bakery in the city.  But had the day off and finally wanted to see what all the fuss is about.\n\nI looked at their website before going and found they put out an Instagram every week of what the cruffin and donut flavors are going to be for the upcoming week.  That's nice of them.  \n\nDid not like their flavor of cruffin today- caramel popcorn.  There were actually some left when I was being waited on at 9:30, which I hear is unusual.  Probably because it's the middle of the week.  Also, I get naming the cruffin that; it sells and it's catchy.  But really all it is is a oversized, overstuffed morning bun.  \n\nI really enjoyed the guy up front; he made recommendations to people, was friendly but firm with customers, and I just knew he'd been doing this awhile and still liked his job, which is nice.  I actually didn't get helped by him, but it was fun to watch.\n\nAnyways, I was torn between getting the Ferrero choux bomb and the donut.  Based on Yelp reviews, I was not wanting to pass up the choux bomb, even though I came there for a donut. But when I asked about the choux bomb (aka cream puff), they had changed the flavor to a white chocolate, coffee, chocolate concoction, which is good but not Ferrero good. \n\nSo I got the chocolate/cherry custard filled donut.  It was good and I liked the surprise that on top of the donut, there were chocolate cereal puffs, and not chocolate chips which I was expecting.\n\nThey had a lot of great classic selections like caramel sticky buns and a large chocolate chip cookie (which the dude says is one of their best, most overlooked items), and then because they're a trendy place they had out there selections like the California croissant and the pear/blue cheese tart, etc.  \n\nOverall, this place has gone to the tourists and the people who need to be trendy in the city.  I was chatting with the lady in line behind me and she said they used to sell wholesale to some place else and she used to get their pastries back then (so she's old school).  She doesn't come often because of the line. That does suck for her and others like her and I, but it's great for their business and I do like that they have their place in the city.", "author": "Becky N."}

So on my next trip I looked them up and sought them out. We did out research so we knew that if you wanted a cruffin (the croissant muffin they're known for) you should get there a little before 9am. They open at 7am, but cruffins don't go on sale until 9am. We got there around 8:50am to find there was already a line of about 15 people. We got in line and an employee brought around cute peace sign stickers. She said that sticker gets you two cruffins and once she is out of stickers they are out of cruffins. After 9am the line moved pretty quickly, we probably waited 20 minutes in total. I got one cruffin and one passion fruit donut to go (and of course took a picture with the sign). I was hugely disappointed in the cruffin. All of the flavors I had seen online sounded delicious! Cherry tart, s'more, vanilla. The day that we went the flavor was grapefruit ginger marscapone. I like grapefruit and I love marscapone, and I have mixed feelings about ginger so I got one and hoped for the best. The ginger taste was hugely overpowering I could barely stand it. Aside from the filling the dough was good, and the passion fruit donut was great! I would like to return to try another flavor, but probably won't due to the line and high demand.

On a day with better weather... good luck.\n\nWe arrived around 9:30 and they had good amount of cruffins left.

It was super moist and the texture of the caramel and powdered sugar was lovely. It was slightly crisp on top and moist throughout. Super wonderful. \nThe ube flavor in the ube puff was overpowered by the lemon in the frosting. It still tasted good, but the ube was practically undetectable. Everything had a good texture to it, the only thing was that the ube didn't shine.

If you're a fan of traditional and simple recipes (chocolate croissants, donuts), then you'll find something to like here.  On the other hand, if you're a fan of forward-thinking and unique recipes, you'll also find something to like here...purple cabbage, passion fruit, artichoke, potato...just a few of the ingredients they often feature in their baked goods. \n\nI'd give them five stars if they offered more of a 50/50 split between their traditional and unique recipes that are available on any given day.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-08-14", "description": "One early afternoon I stumbled across Mr Holmes. I was impressed that they were sold out of everything except for a couple of jam filled donuts. After reading so many hyped reviews, I became very curious (and hungry). So me being in the city early one morning I decided to give it a go. I arrived at 8:15 a.m. and there was already a line of about 40 people--curiosity peaked.\n\nThe store opens at 8 a.m. with all their products on sale except for the cruffin. The line is only for the cruffin and they don't sell it until 9 a.m. I wasn't sure whether to wait 40 minutes for a pastry but I already started a pleasant conversation with someone in line so why not? Those in line will be given a ticket that guarantees them a cruffin, if you don't have a ticket you cannot be guaranteed one. There's a limit of two cruffins per person. Luckily if you don't want the cruffin the line for the rest of the baked goods is pretty short, yet they do manage to sell out between 12-2pm.\n\nCruffin -- good or bad? Average. It's a croissant in the shape of a muffin with a lot of cream piped inside and some whipped cream on top. I did purchase one of their croissants and it tasted almost the same but the cruffin is in the shape of a muffin and is coated in granulated sugar. The cream is very good; however, the flavor of the day was ROOT BEER. Root flippin' Beer?! Ugh. I like root beer but not in my pastry. Even though the root beer flavor is faint and the quality of the cream is good, it'd still be better to provide at least two flavor options. One with maybe, errr, vanila? And the other as root beer, the one flavor people wouldn't wait 40 minutes in line for. As a life long muffin fan I don't see any resemblance in muffin flavor or texture. It's merely the shape. What bafoonery is this? What you're getting is an okay croissant with a lot of cream shot into it. You'd be better off at Beard Papa.\n\nWhile in line for the cruffin I decided to buy some of their other stuff to see if it was any good. I bought a \"strawberry milkshake\" filled donut, a traditional chocolate croissant, and a california croissant. The strawberry milkshake donut was easily the best thing I had at Mr Holmes in terms of bake and filling. Although, the filling was a bit off because it had a strange lumpy consistency. The chocolate croissant was okay. It was airy and crispy but I've had better croissants (i'm looking for more buttery flakiness). The california croissant is a savory croissant filled with cooked salmon and seaweed served with a packed of soy sauce. It does kind of taste like a sushi roll when you eat it, but I was thinking why the hell am I not just eating a sushi roll. It's an okay idea but the flavor needs some work.\n\n-----\n\nAn average bakeshop. DO NOT WAIT IN LINE FOR THE CRUFFIN. There are so many other fantastic bakeshops in SF with little to no line. The limited quantities are for marketing purposes.", "author": "Michael H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-08-17", "description": "This was our 5th time visiting San Francisco as we have family in the area and were in town for a wedding this past weekend. The bake shop was near our hotel and we read a lot of good reviews of it on Yelp, so we stopped in to get some pastries before hitting up the SFMOMA. \nWe spent $35.00 in various pastries and coffee and orange juice. The girl doling out the pastries was nice, but when I simply asked the girl behind the register if the orange juice was fresh squeezed she gave me a lot of attitude and acted like I was crazy for asking the question. She said, \"If we did that, we wouldn't have enough time to even bake.\" The response was really rude and a simple \"no we don't\" would have been sufficient. She was fairly tall, had reddish/ strawberry blonde hair and was dressed in a punk style with multiple piercings and what looked like purple triangular makeup or tattoos under or around her eyes. \nMy mom and I brushed off the rude comment. We stayed in the store to enjoy our pastries. Because we bought a lot it was put in one of the large boxes. We had about 1.5 pastries left when we were done eating. We were walking to and from our destinations and didn't want to have to carry a big box to the museum. So I went up to the same girl to ask if we could consolidate and put our pastries in individual bags. She did and said we could just throw away the box. I asked if she could please throw it away for us and she gave an extreme negative attitude once again that we were putting her out by having to throw away one of the boxes from her store. I figured the store recycled and would have a better disposable system rather than me trying to hunt down an industrial garbage bin in the city while 7 months pregnant!\nAfter she threw away the box she came back to the register, rolled her eyes, and yelled out \"Jesus Christ!\" She really was put off by actually having to work and give her version of \"customer service.\"\nThe pastries were good, but not good enough to be treated in such a way. There are plenty of other amazing bake shops in the city that we frequented on that trip and that we will come back to. For example, Tartine Bakery had out-of-this-world pastries and excellent customer service. But unfortunately because of the poor customer service from this one girl behind the register, I'm sorry to say we won't be back to Mr. Holmes. She completely put a bad taste in our mouth and now we associate her with this bake shop.", "author": "Tala M."}

There was a really long line behind us; it went all the way down the block and to the corner. I recommend coming around 8:40-8:50 to try cruffins. \nThe flavor of the day for cruffins were chocolate peanut butter and the donuts were orange creamsicle and pumpkin cheesecake. I didn't like the flavors that much, but they were good, so you should depend it on the flavor before buying donuts.\nOther than cruffins, we bought the cream/choux bombs, a California croissant, and two donuts. Everything was fabulous, but they are not good for a long car ride nor they are good a day after, so make sure you don't go overboard with cruffins or the other cream stuff.\nThe only pastry I would buy multiple of next time is the California croissant. This would be the only thing I stand in a line for. This is a masterpiece, and everyone should praise this wonderful creation. Seriously. It's terrific and savory and sweet and flavorful. The croissant is moist and stays moist and the salmon and ginger and seaweed...it's heaven. \n\nDefinitely check out this place, but in my opinion, cruffins are not worth the line.", "author": "Diana O."}

Almost every time, the exception of once, I've wanted to take a jar of the filling home and pair it with something I've made instead.\n\nThe items are, more often than not, cold and greasy, as if the grease was meant to stay on, in order to hold the dusted sugar to the item. Seriously? If I'm waiting outside in the cold for at-least 45 minutes, because it's not enough to be there as soon as they open you have to be outside at least a good 20 minutes before, dependent on the flavor of that day. I mean, heaven forbid I get something toasty and warm to scare away the chill that has nipped at my fingers in the misty overcast weather that is San Francisco. Nothing is as unappetizing as taking a bite into a cold greasy donuts and looking at your hands as if you had slathered them in a sugar scrub!\n\nAlthough it can be noted that the store and decor are so very inviting once inside. \nI will also say that the updates that get sent out regarding that week's flavors can be very helpful.\n\nOh and this 2 cruffin limit and only before a certain time. If you're extremely keen to try and I believe that everyone should try them once. I would encourage you to bring a friend or 2.

Ever since the cronut era, places have been trying to combine two different pastries into one to make something interesting. When I went to San Francisco, my friend suggested that we go to Mr. Holmes Bakehouse to try a cruffin? WHAT? THOSE EXIST? I have never heard of a cruffin until August of this year LOL. If y'all want to know what a cruffin is, it is a hybrid of a croissant and muffin. My friend and I got to Mr. Holmes Bakehouse at around 8AM in the morning, which is really early, and there was already a line! They do not serve cruffins until 9AM, but their other pastry area opens at 8AM. When we went there, we were served the vanilla bourbon cruffin, which was good! It was an interesting concept because it tasted like a cronut but looked like a muffin? LOL.

Known for their iconic \"I got baked in San Francisco\" catchphrase and their even more popular \"cruffin\", Mr. Holmes Bakehouse quickly rose to the top of every San Franciscan's bucket list of treats to try. \n\nHOW TO \"CRUFFIN\":\n-What is a cruffin you say? Well, it's a flaky croissant..shaped like a muffin..filled with a fluffy cream filling..and powdered in sugar all around the outside. Yes, please do contain your excitement.\n\n-Okay, so you want a cruffin? So does everyone else. The bakery opens at 8:00 AM, but the cruffins don't come out until 9:00. But don't show up at 9:15 expecting to snag one. Expect to line up in the cruffin line (yes, there's a separate line specifically designated to cruffins) at 8:00 - 8:30 and wait until the line starts moving when they bring the cruffins in at 9:00. My friends and I got there around 8:30 and got our cruffins at 9:30. If you're starving, you can always send someone (always come with friends) to grab some goodies from the non-cruffin line so you may enjoy those while waiting for your main prize. \n\n-Only 2 cruffins per person (sad, I know)\n\n-Only 1 flavor per day. Flavors I've seen range from Matcha Green Tea, to Strawberry Milkshake, to Chocolate Passionfruit\n\n-Those cruffins are MESSY. Eat in your car at your own risk. Expect sugar to get caught in your hair, on your face, on your lap, in your beard, or just everywhere. \n\n-When you pick up your two cruffins, you can either get them scrunched together in a little pastry bag, or you can opt to buy a really pretty box for like $1.50 or something. The box is free with the purchase of 6 pastries. Each cruffin costs $4.00. \n-----------------------------------------------\nI personally went in on a Sunday, which I think is ideal considering the parking game wasn't so much of a struggle and meters were free. If you go on a workday, I'd anticipate a bit of a headache. \n\nI didn't have the opportunity to try any of their other baked goods, so this is just based on my cruffin experience. Although the cruffins were absolutely delightful, I don't know how often I can drive out into town to wait an hour for one dessert. I will say it was a great experience though, and I'm glad to have crossed it off my list!", "author": "Cara O."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-24", "description": "Question we ask ourselves before waiting at least 30 mins in line for a highly raved particular item (the infamous cruffin in this case), \"Is it worth the hype?\"\n\nSo the cruffin itself is quite the unique invention, I mean a croissant + muffin? Nice! The idea itself already takes the expectation high. Which leads to the debate of what's the hype... discussing in terms of a what constitutes a high review of a baked good: the cruffin was flaky, taking after the croissant, and had good texture. Maintained its body while I was eating it like a muffin, which I like, instead of it falling all over the place. But toooo much filling in my opinion. The flavor of the day was chocolate cherry, which I was already indifferent about (wish I was there for a matcha green tea or blood orange day) so the flavor was already kinda made me meh to the cruffin itself.\n\nNow would I wait 30+ mins in line in the morning again? Maaaybe. Possibly for a different flavor. & more likely too if the prices weren't as steep for $4.50 each. \n\nOther items: doughtnuts were ok, was expecting better to be honest. Although the texture was once again good, just the filling kinda killed it. And not really a fan of the topped sugar. What I did probably like the most was the Ferrero Roche choux. Flaky and not too sweet. The kouign amann was also good, simple and not too sweet. \n\nOverall, in the texture/base of the baked goods were great. I would say 4-4.5/5. It's comparable to other bake shops like Tartine and b. patisserie where you can find that same quality in other products. But I'm giving Mr. Holmes itself only a 3/5 because the filling ruined it lol.\n\nBut major props to the business aspect though. The marketing for Mr. Holmes Bakeshop is pretty awesome in my opinion. Their 6 item minimum to get the free box is a great marketing sales mechanism. They also have launched their products FAST, effectively, and upscaled their reputation well through social media and this is greatly demonstrated as you have people waiting in line DAILY for their products. And their creativity- only joint I know that's skyrocketing in their sales due to their infamous cruffin. & not to mention I'm sure everyone wants to \"get baked in San Francisco\". \n\n\"FInal\": 3.5-4/5. glad I was able to see what the hype was about, but not that outstanding for me to go back. There are lots of other specialty bakeries also worth checking out.", "author": "Shelby C."}

Ya, I think that's the most important piece of advice I can give. If you're in the business of getting a cruffin or 2, try to get there before they open so you can get a sticker. I did not show up early enough to get a sticker BUT I got lucky and was able to get 2 cruffins of my own. I really appreciated how organized and informative they were about the cruffins. You will not know the flavor of the cruffins until you get there, but chances are it'll be good anyways. They had a coffee custard/sea salt caramel cruffin the day I went, and it was ahhffreakingmazing. They count the cruffins they receive, divide that by 2, hand out that many stickers, and usually not everyone takes 2 (the limit per person) and they end up with around 15-20 cruffins after the stickers are gone, which offers good odds to at least 10 people without stickers. IMO, you only need one, but if it's your first time, go ahead and take 2 and maybe regret it the next time you're at the gym (or don't, yolo) Also, boxes are $1.50, but they are free if you buy at least 6 pastries.", "author": "Christine G."}

Not a big fan of their cruffins, but their passion fruit donuts are fantastic. However, if you work in a customer service industry of serving people, perhaps a bit of smile (or better yet, an attitude adjustment) should be useful tool to have. I have to say, the attitude of the ladies behind the glass is somewhat of a soup natzy, consistently. Also, thought when you order 6 or more items, you were supposed to get a box, not individually bagged (and left out an item you ordered and still pay for).

Price wise I'd say they are ok. The Cruffin itself is a bit dry on the outside and I'd prefer it without all of the sugar crystals on the outside, but that's just my taste. The filling itself was quite good and I very much liked the attention to detail with the small dried strawberry on top. In the past if tried a lot of trend food like Cronuts, Cragels and even a Burger wrapped in a Langos, and I got to say the Cruffin is not quite in the top spot. Funnily enough, I got two and put the second one in the fridge and ate it the day after.

I couldn't eat the whole thing, and overall was too sweet.\n\nAlmond Bostock - 2nd favorite pastry after the cruffin.

While the cruffin did seem pretty appetizing, I opted for the thai tea donut instead and I have to say that it was pretty good but I couldn't imagine having more than one. The thai tea cream was sweet but not too sweet and the outside of the donut with sugar crystal was the right amount, but I still feel like I might've needed a tea or milk to go with it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-15", "description": "I thought I wouldn't like the cruffin. I mean, it's just a croissant that's shaped like a muffin, rolled in some sugar, topped with some pop rocks, and filled with some kind of cream. Plus you can't even see the flavor of the day until you get there (at 8:30 am, if you wanna get a cruffin!)\n\nBut I was wrong. Forgive me, cruffin. You are pretty amazing. Unlike the cronut (which is disgusting, sorry) the cruffin doesn't taste like oil, and the sugary crust gives it a fantastic crunch which perfectly complements the silky smooth custardy filling (which is just lightly sweetened and heavenly). I had the privilege to try the chooclate brownie cruffin, and I hope to one day try the matcha cruffin.\n\nPlan of attack: Get there by 8:15 am. Bring at least one other partner in crime. On the weekend there are two lines - the Cruffin Line and Everything Else Line (weekdays are easy - just one line). Your partner will go to the Everything Else Line, and you will make a beeline for the Cruffin Line. It would behoove the person in the Everything Else Line to get a box of six pastries (favorites: apple hand pie, almond croissant, almond bostock, kouign amann, California croissant with smoked salmon and wasabi...the list goes on! I loved the ferrero rocher cream puff thing for the creamy hazelnut filling, but not for the outer shell - way too crunchy such that when you bit into it the filling squished out - not architecturally sound but still worth trying!). \n\nWhen they get the goods, they should join you in the Cruffin Line (by this time you will likely have gotten a sticker guaranteeing you at most two cruffins) and the two of you should enjoy a few of the pastries while waiting for your cruffin. \n\nA note on cruffin line etiquette - if you joined someone in line, YOU DO NOT GET A CRUFFIN. They get max two, because they've been waiting. You are a bystander, just there to watch the show. Common sense right? Do you want to be killed by the people behind you? Didn't think so. So don't do it.\n\nNow go wake up early and get your cruffin and other pastries!!", "author": "Connie W."}

I was a little too eager as we showed up around 8:15 on a Tuesday morning. I knew that cruffins were not sold until 9 but I wanted to make sure my waking up early would be rewarded with a cruffin!\n\nMy boyfriend purchased a coffee while we waited outside of Mr. Holmes Bakehouse for cruffin time (theres a convenient countdown clock on their website, btw.) A line began to form around 8:40, which is probably a little later than normal considering this is a Tuesday morning. Once 9 o'clock rolled around, we were inside the quaint, yet trendy, bakeshop and decided to order 6 pastries. If you want a box, you have to order 6. The cruffin flavor that day was pear cobbler, and since that sounded so delicious, we decided to get 3 cruffins. (There are 2 cruffins allowed per person.) To complete our 6 pastry collection, we went with an ube puff, the California croissant, and a passionfruit donut. \n\nSo now, the verdict: the cruffins were delicious!!! Layers of crispy croissant in a vertical format, covered with sugar, and complete with not overly-sweet filling. It was certainly messy but worth it. I was a little disappointed that we didn't order our allotted 4.\nThe ube puff was interesting. I had no idea what ube was but the pink prickly pear-based icing on top was intriguing. The puff was good, yes, but didn't taste like much. I would have traded it for that 4th cruffin.\nThe California croissant was excellent! Complete with a little package of soy sauce. If you're looking for a savory, rather than sweet, start to your day, go for this!\nThe donut flavor choices for the day were passionfruit or coconut. We chose passionfruit and gave the donut to my boyfriend's dad. He told us it was excellent! \n\nSo overall, if you have some time to spare in your morning to wait in line, go get yourself a cruffin! I don't think you will be disappointed!", "author": "Bridget G."}

The blueberry brioche bomb was delicious with fresh blueberries and the dough was soft. The choux bomb was sweet for my taste, but nonetheless definitely something I would get again if I have a sweet tooth that day. It is somewhat of a ferrero rocher flavor.

It is ironically one of my favorites on their menu. I was not able to stay in line for the cruffin because they release them at 9am and I had an exam to take during that time.

I'm glad I didn't given the type of service I had today. Last time I was here (still not aware of any particular time frames of when cruffins are offered to be purchased), I wanted to try this 'Cruffin' hype. I got here the moment it opened to avoid a line.. But it was obviously no line. The lady told me I had to wait an hour because the cruffins aren't finished being made yet. Sure. Not an issue. I've seen photographs of how long the lines were so I asked if its possible if I could pay for it first and I'll be back in an hour to pick them up. She was fine with that and accommodated me. Awesome. Came back in an hour. Picked them up. Brought them back and shared with my family. It was delicious fresh. Different. Amazing.\n\nToday however left a bitter taste in my mouth. Extremely disappointed. I just drove up from LA. Dropped my luggage off and headed straight over here. Arrived at 735am. There's a line and no parking close by since its street cleaning on some parts of the streets nearby. This time.. I got a really rude gentleman. Sorry.. Not sorry NOT gentleman.. More like a DOUCHE.. His response was extremely rude towards me. I asked when the cruffins were available. His response. \"9am daily it has always been 9am and will only be available at 9am due to the high volume of people wanting this\". Ok not a problem. I figured I could wait but realized I'm parked in a loading zone only. Any SF native knows those meter maids will be here 9am ON THE DOT. If you're lucky a few minutes later. So of course I lined up again to ask if its possible to accommodate me. I DID just come from LA to get some breakfast here and I AM going to wait outside. Since I'm here already and waited twice .. They did it before why can't you do it again? He didn't even apologize and told me rules changed or that it might have been a one time thing. Instead the response was rude. No. We can't do this for you otherwise we would have to do this for everybody. Ok well you did do this before? No. 9am. You are parked there and you'll be the first in line. Um.. Right.. First of many in line. So he pretty much said I had to wait in line like everyone else even if the line went down the block. Rude! Sorry guys but I won't be returning. If the service is inconsistent its not worth my time. I did however support one last time because I didnt drive out here to come home empty handed. It'll be my last three items I'm purchasing ever from this place. And here I wanted to buy boxes to share with my family. You just lost some business and I won't be recommending it to anyone else.

We went around 10:30 and of course their infamous cruffins were sold out. The lady told us that they let out a bunch at 9:00am and they sell out usually around 9:30am. Should really make more!!! At least there isn't a huge line, which I appreciated. \n\nWe tried the Chocolate (Nutella) and Lemon donuts (which are very similar to malasadas from Leonard's located in Hawaii-if you find yourself in the area). Similar taste and everything. Like a sugar donut with filling. I didn't care for the lemon one too much because it was more tart that I expected. If you miss out on their cruffins (cause you most likely will) their croissants look delicious! We got the chocolate one, wish the chocolate was more melted but the croissant itself was good! I think I would just do the normal croissant next time. Make sure to wash it down with coffee or milk (they only have coffee and sparkling water).", "author": "Lauren W."}

At first I was a little skeptical and thought this place was only famous because it was highly Instagrammed - but this place definitely lives up to its hype. There is a line outside to get in, but it moves extremely fast so I wouldn't be intimidated by it. \n\nDisclaimer: I'm only giving this place four stars for now because I didn't get there early enough to try the cruffins. I've heard you have to be there around 8am, but I could be wrong!\n\nMoving on, I got there and I tried their savory artichoke danish, turkey pesto danish, raspberry danish, pineapple donut, and choux. The pastries are extremely sweet and I would recommend eating them from sweet to savory - mainly so you feel less guilty about eating all the sweets when the taste of saltiness is still in your mouth. The raspberry danish was a little too sweet for my liking - but I am also not the biggest fan of sweets. The savory danishes were really really good. The outside was the perfect amount of crumbliness - although I do wish there was a little bit more pesto in the pesto danish. The pineapple donut was amazing! It was filled with so much pineapple filling that actually tasted like pineapples. But I would say the donut outside was more of a mechanism to put pineapple filling into your mouth. The choux was okay - a little overrated and slightly tasteless, but everyone else seems to disagree, so I would still recommend trying at least once.", "author": "Alice Y."}

They are flaky pastries (croissant shaped like a muffin basically) filled with generous amount of cream/whatever filling they have for the flavor of the day. Get in line at least by 8:30am. We got there around ~8:20am and we got the stickers that guarantee us cruffins and I think there were only 10-15 more people after us that got the stickers. \n\nIn the middle of a semi dingy location, this bakery is such a cute hip place. cute stickers, cute box ($1.50 for less than 6 pastries, free for 6 pastries), and the famous \"I got baked in SF\" sign. \n\nBesides cruffins, I got amelie amann because it seemed like a house specialty. I think I can describe it as a denser, flakier croissant flattened out with caramelized surface. aesthetically, it doesn't really stand out but I really enjoyed this as well as the cruffins.\n\nI wouldn't come here just to get some pastries but it's more like a weekend morning adventure with your friends.", "author": "Becky M."}

But really, you have to try this bakery ;) \n\nGot here around 8:30 am on a Saturday morning to stand in line (thank god we missed the rain) ...such dedication just to try the famous cruffins. We got to the front at around 8:55 or so, right before the cruffins get out which is 9 am. While we waited, we did what every customer/instagrammer there was doing. Instagrammed the \"I got baked in SF\" sign, deciding which other pastries we wanted, and checked yelp reviews to see which flavor cruffin they might be serving today - it was coffee! Yum. \n\nHere are the goodies we got: \n+2 coffee cruffins - totally worth every minute we waited that morning. The outside was flaky and crispy, as youd expect a croissant to be and inside had an out-of-this world coffee pudding. It was a messy and sinfully delicious pastry. \n+1 banana cream donut - Not a huge fan of the banana cream flavors but the donut was phenomenal. Soft and the banana pudding on the inside was a perfect consistency. \n+1 chocolate croissant - I would skip this and get an extra cruffin if you can. Not a bad croissant, just not their forte in my opinion. \n+1 blueberry brioche - did not try this so can't comment (a friend took it home for her bf who was still peacefully sleeping - lucky man) \n+1 mushroom croissant type pastry - a great savory addition to the mix! The mushroom filling was delicious and it was a great change in midst of all the sweet calories we were consuming. \n\nTips:\n+Cruffins only get out at 9 am - so either wait in the cruffin line, if that's all you want (We had no idea there were two lines), or stand in the regular line and if you happen to be paying around 8:55-9:00 am, like we were, they won't make you stand in the cruffin line and will just let you get those at the front. Weird policy I think? \n+You get pins while you are in line. Each pin let's you get 2 cruffins. \n+Skip the coffee (we though it tasted sort of burnt) and walk yourself to philz/another cafe in the area where you can enjoy your goodies\n+ No seating \n+ You need to get 6 pastries to get one of the famous \"I was baked in SF\" boxes. If you don't get 6, you pay $1.50 for the box. Good business strategy to scam all us desperate instagrammers? \n+ Pastries get pricey - we spent over $30 on just pastries so watch what you're ordering as you fill up that box! \n\nVerdict: Yes, definitely go!

I'm having a love affair with Mr. Holmes! \n\nLike most crushes, the affair started out innocent enough but quickly turned into a dangerous, calorie-laden liaison.... \n\n-2/3/15: 12:18p.m. After a 20 minute walk from my work in Union Square, my best friend and I arrived to find the bakery closed with a \"sold out\" sign. \n\n-2/3/15: 12:20p.m. Walked back to Union Square with my best friend and plotted our next-morning return.\n\n-2/4/15: 3:00a.m. Lay awake in my bed with insomnia (unrelated to Mr. Holmes) and thought about Mr. Holmes. \n\n-2/4/15: 8:32a.m. Arrived at Mr. Holmes.No line! And my best friend is already awaiting with a box of every available pastry. THIS IS WHY WE ARE BEST FRIENDS. \n\n-2/4/15: 8:34a.m. Began methodically dissecting and sampling each pastry. My findings:\n\n-Amelie Amann: mmm, flaky, buttery croissant dough baked with extra butter and a pistachio filling. Just a slight step below B Patisserie's Kouign Amann, but really, really good\n\n-Brioche with Raspberry & Pistachios: my least favorite pastry, but only because I wasn't a fan of the tarte filling. If you like tarte flavors, this may be for you.The dough was light and flaky though. \n\n-Sea Salt Caramel Donut: Dough, fluffy pillow of goodness with an interesting salted caramel filling. It was less sweet, and more savory, with almost coffee, toasted almond notes.\n\n-Apple Pie Turnover: my 2nd least favorite pastry, and same review as the Brioche above\n\n-Mushroom & Sumac Croissant: Mmmmm, this was really good. The savory notes of the mushroom and sumac reminded me of a really good breakfast quiche. \n\n-Ferrero Rocher Choux Bomb: SPOT-ON. This tasted exactly like Ferrero Rocher. The luscious Ferrero Rocher  cream is sandwiched between two cheeky halves of a flaky choux pastry. \n\n-Caramel Cruffin: my FAVE thing I tried. Flaky, buttery croissant dough baked into a whimsical muffin shape and then completely dusted in sugar and cinnamon. And inside, there is a luscious caramel custard that comes oozing out with each bite. With every bite you get the crunchy outer crust coated in sugar and cinnamon, the doughy inner crust, and the creamy luscious custard. A messy, get all over your mouth/face/fingers pastry that was worth the wait (when we arrived at 8:30a.m., the Cruffin didn't come out until 9:00a.m.). I'm sitting here, eating little by little, trying to extend this heaven as long as possible. Quite possibly the next \"CRONUT\" sensation!!! \n\nWhile slightly pricey, I thought the quality of pastries was worth it. As a plus, the aesthetic/decor of the shop is on-point: cheeky gold lettering across the front door, white honeycomb tiled floor, hip white minimalist interior, and of course, your catchy neon sign (sure to become an instagram phenomenon). \n\nIn my opinion, way better than other over-priced bakeries (I'm looking at you, Craftsman & Wolves & Tartine) that were over-hyped and lackluster for me.

Very hard to split with my coworkers, as it flaked all over the place when I tried to cut it. It was a little hard on the outside for a couple of the flakes, but overall I loved it. The buttery light flavor mixed with the salmon was light and savory, and a pleasant savory surprise. The soy sauce was a cute addition, but I didn't pair it with the pastry for fear of getting it everywhere. My coworkers were skeptical, but loved it after trying it. \n\nStrawberry Croissant - The filling proportion was great, and it was very sweet, though not overly strawberry flavored. This croissant was perfect, this one wasn't as flaky as the sushi one. Tough to eat gracefully (lots of powered sugar and almonds on top), but worth it. \n\nSalted Caramel Filled Donut - The filling was extremely rich and dark, but the proportion in the donut was perfect. The consistency of the chocolate salted caramel filling was excellent, and you could taste the deep caramel flavor with the chocolate. I would have wanted perhaps some salt flakes on the donut exterior, but otherwise it was delicious and extremely soft. Pro tip: they sell the filling at the counter in cute little jars! They also sell coffee and granola. \n\nI will definitely be back with guests and fellow pastry lovers.", "author": "Claire S."}

My boyfriend and I stopped here for breakfast before venturing out in the city. The line went outside the door, which I expected since I heard great things from the bakery. The line wasn't too long though, we waited probably 15-20 minutes before we started ordering. Everything from the window looks amazing, we wanted to try everything! The decor was modern and cute, I was a bit sad to see that the famous baked sign they have wasn't lit lol, but that's because I wanted a nice picture. My boyfriend got the choux bomb and he loved it, and he isn't a big fan of sweets. I got the strawberry and jalape\u00f1o brioche bomb which was AMAZING. It was a little odd at first but it got better with every bite. We also got the bread pudding to share and 10/10 from us.

Unfortunately the cruffins had run out by the time I got to the bakery, which is understandable, I know how popular they are, that is not something I am holding against them. What is not understandable is how they can hire someone so rude to run the front of the shop. Seriously, if your job revolves around customer care and having to interact with people, you would think you would make more an effort to be approachable and friendly.

We heard you needing to get in line early and saw some people mention getting in line 30-60 min ahead of time. Well first off their instagram says cruffins at 9- but when we went to their website it showed us it opens at 7am weekdays and 8am weekends. We got there at 7am thinking cruffins were at 8. Nope. We were obviously confused that the main shop opens at a different time than when cruffins are there. So... we waited around 2 hours. We learned while waiting- that an hour is probably too early unless you want to be at the front of the line. We likely could have come 15 min before 9 and still gotten a cruffin and other baked goodies. And as for the cruffin- definitely something I recommend trying at least once. Great flaky texture and so soft and yummy. But in my group- we all preferred the crime filled donut of the day better (it was pumpkin spice). Which we could have gotten at 8 when the shop opened.

I noted from the yelp reviews that cruffins is THE THING to have, so I hauled ass to get myself there before 9am. \n\nThe line wasn't too bad for a Wednesday morning, and I managed to get my cruffins and some other goodies within the hour. So here's the verdict (whoops my bad but I don't know all the names of everything) - \n\nCruffin - Mixed feels on this one because the flavor of the day that I got was the pina colada, which actually had a mini tube of alcohol on it. The creme and cruffin was alright without the tube (the outer shell was very sugary and flaky, while the center was pretty soft), but once the alcohol was in, it was a no go for me. But some of the other flavors sound like they were way better - namely, the Strawberry Milkshake, which I wish I could have had instead.\n\nApple Scone - This was pretty good! I think generally everything at this bakery is a bit heavy in flavor (heavy compared to asian bakeries), but it worked for this one. A nice touch with actual apple bits.\n\nThat ferrero rocher(sp?) choux creme - This was definitely the crown jewel of the set for me. I actually ate this one days later...but it was still incredibly good! The creme really does taste like the chocolate, albeit a lightweight version of it, and the pastry bits were delicious. I would definitely eat this again, and I think it was honestly a lot better than the cruffin.\n\nBanana-filling doughnut - This was alright. I wasn't in love with it, but again, nice touch with the banana bits in it. I was expecting the creme to sort of taste like banana pudding (which I think would taste really good too!), but it's got more of a natural taste to it. It was decent, but nothing I would write home about. \n\nOverall, pretty decent. I'm a bit unsure about the cruffin, but hey, the bakery is kinda cute in this hipster dive kind of way and some of their other things are really good. Plus, their boxes are really cool and you can actually just buy the box for $1.50. I would say definitely worth a shot especially if you're a local because you've got nothing to lose but the time you wait in line (and probably that $4.50 you have to shell out but you get my point).", "author": "Doris K."}

I've tried the california croissant as well and maybe this was the only one that I liked. It had smoked salmon, nori, ginger and wasabi in it.

I came here around 10 am on a Friday morning, waited in line for at least 40 min, only to find an empty space on their baked goods counter where the cruffins are supposed to be. I was pretty bummed...since I'm like never in the city. But of course after waiting so long, I couldn't leave without a box of baked goods. You need to buy 6 or more pastries to get a box, so I got a good variety. Can't remember the names of everything that I got, but all of them were SO delicious! The texture of their pastries is perfect, and I didn't find any of them to be overly sweet. The strawberry jalapeno brioche was hands down my favorite--I loved the spicy kick and warmth that the jalapeno flavor added to the strawberry filling.

I thought the flavors for the cruffin were overwhelming and the donut was just meh. It tasted like a regular chocolate filled donut to me. However, I did like the chocolate chips on the outside of it because they were crunchy, I wish they were on the inside as well. Don't get me wrong, the cruffin was baked to perfection but I thought it was overly sweet in my opinion and I love sweets! You should eat the pastries right when you get them, I ate them hours after and they were kind of soggy, oops. \n\nThe thing that bugged me the most was the lady who was putting my order in. I felt rushed and I felt like she wasn't really paying attention to what I was saying. I asked for 2 Ferrero Rocher choux bomb but I realized when I got home that I never received any. I wanted to try this the most got home without it. I asked for 2 chocolate donuts and she gave me 2 chocolate and 2 lemon donuts. Maybe she heard the word \"donuts\" and gave me 4, which is why I felt like I didn't have her undivided attention. She also put them into the box carelessly so the filling on top of my donut fell on the box and stuck there and so did the marshmellows on top of my cruffins. \n\nAs for the wait, I was first in line for the cruffins because I arrived at 8 am on a Thursday. People only started arriving around 8:30-8:45 to line up for the cruffins. At around 9, however, when the cruffins come out, there was an extremely long line down the block. \n\nSince this bakery is in the Tenderloin, parking is very limited. While waiting in line, I saw maybe 1 or 2 spaces open. Meters start at 9 am so if you want to stand in line for cruffins, you're gonna have to start feeding the meter by the time you get there to ensure when the clock hits 9 am, that you don't receive a ticket, or you can bring a friend and have them stand in line with you so you can go and feed your meter when 9 o clock hits.", "author": "Marlene H."}

The donut was an ok donut, but had way too much toffee inside, making it super sweet. It didn't feel very special considering the $4 price! For $1 it would have been ok, now it was just an overpriced bad-to-mediocre donut. The ferrero cake was also a disappointment. The cream was in this case not very flavourful, it felt very buttery.

In general the stuff with fillings of some kind seems much worse than the stuff with no fillings.\n\nAlso the service is hit and miss. Once the lady at the register couldn't calculate my change. She literally couldn't deduct two from three, so the guy packing the pastries has to intervene saying she was \"overworked\". Maybe they should put someone who knows numbers by the register... \n\nSo all in all, there are a dozen better bakeries to load up on calories around in SF.", "author": "A D."}

I arrived about 30 minutes before the store opened.   I saw about 3-4 people already waiting in line.  Luckily there are two lines.  One for cruffins and one for everything else in the bakery.  My girlfriend got in line for the regular pastries while I stood in line for the cruffins.  The cruffins don't get served until 9am so if you wanted to get something from the other line and then get back in line for the cruffins, if is possible.  If you do however, the line will probably be a lot longer.  It's best to come with two people so one person can wait in each line.\n\nThe doughnuts were delicious.   I don't remember which one I had but it was one of the filling doughnuts and you can tell it was freshly baked and prepared very well.\n\nThe cruffins however was a little disappointing for me.  I waited in line for about over an hour and found out that they only had one flavor.  The flavor of the day was coffee.  I like drinking coffee every now and then but the taste of coffee in a morning pastry for me was not working.\n\nI would go again only if I knew what they were having that day or if I was craving doughnuts.  It was a fun experience and the workers were really nice as well.  Mr Holmes himself came out to let people know that cruffins were on their way and he made the crowd happier staying in line.", "author": "Alan B."}

I'll review what I had!\n\nStrawberry jalape\u00f1o croissant: \nRating 5/5 \nWow! This was probably the best tasting out of everything we purchased. It was so different and unique. The croissant itself was pretty good but the cream cheese filling was divine! It was almost a cross between a jalape\u00f1o cream cheese filling and a strawberry buttercream. Not too heavy or too much off \"anything\", simply perfect and refreshing.  \nSavory Bread: \nRating 4/5 \nI choose this bread because it stuck out on the display and I've never tried anything like this before. It was really dense and full of flavor, but it definitely had a lot going on. Overall, I really enjoyed it and would definitely but this item again along with the croissant; I probably wouldn't finish the entire piece in one sitting though. \nChocolate Chip cookie: \nRating 5/5\nBoth me and my cousin enjoyed this cookie very much. You could taste the quality of every ingredient in the cookie. As an avid cookie connoisseur, I would confidentially agree that this is the probably the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever had and I highly doubt I'll ever be able to make something as delicious as this.

We agreed to check it out if we were up early enough, since they sell out quickly. Luckily, we were up and at em in the morning and joined the line around 8:50. The anticipation continued to grow as we waited and heard people talking in line. The flavor of the day for the cruffins was strawberry milkshake...ohhh ahhh. As the line moved we saw the adorable interior of the bakery. They have a really cool little spot. The boxes are adorned in gold and piled high in front of the window. Their branding is on point. They have a fun neon sign on the wall inside and some crates converted into seats, although it's far too small to sit inside. The counter has about a dozen gorgeous baked goods on display and you can't help but to salivate and want to jump the display window and eat all the things! Of course you stop yourself because there's a long line of witnesses and there's no way to talk your way out of that. Instead, you ask for a box, which you can only have if you order 6 or more pastries, no problem! There is a cruffin limit, 2 per person, so you'll have 2 of those and then 1 of everything else. I ended up with a delicious tart with a beautiful merengue on top, a donut, an Amelie Amann, and a brioche with fruit in the middle.  \n\nThe cruffin was out of this world delicious. It's flaky with a doughy center and the strawberry milkshake filling was like a strawberries and creme cloud. I scarfed it down while trying my best to relish the deliciousness. I moved on to the Amelie Amann, I just wanted a bite. It was flaky and buttery and everything I ever wanted. I had to walk away...\n\nWhen I returned to my hotel room I had to eat the tart because the merengue was losing its life. The crust was thick, which was annoying at first, but once I got to the filling it really helped to balance the sweetness. Initially there was a just a yellow filling but when I got to the center I found a citrus filling within the filling, filling ception! The tart was so delicious, I ate the entire thing and immediately felt sick, I recommend splitting it with a friend. \n\nThis bakery lives up the hype, it's on a whole 'nother level!

Think of a croissant merely cooked with the bottom half inserted in and molded by a muffin pan/cup with a flavored cream filling squirted in the top end.  So, it's just a cream filled croissant of a slightly different shape.  Not sure why people are so fascinated by that but they are.  \n\nThe service is efficient and very friendly, accommodating.

We arrived a little past 10:30am on a Tuesday and we were told that all the cruffins were sold out by 10am (which was considered late). The cashier was the sweetest and was the most accommodating for my friend that is allergic to nuts. She recommended to get in line by 8:30-9 to ensure yourself a cruffin! As we were munching away at their other lovely, perfectly flakey pastries, out comes Ry Stephen and the cashier with a single cruffin from the back room. They were nice enough to offer us this last majestic Choc Pop Rock Chip Tiger Drip Cruffin. We were simply ecstatic, totally made the hour commute from the east bay all the more worth it!

It was beautiful and truly a work of baked art.  The rest of the baked goods all looked spectacular as well.  I ended up getting my allotment of 2 cruffins and a few other items.  The cruffins were amazing!  Croissant texture with a delightful filling and lots of sugar!  All if the other items I tried were also delicious!\n\nWhile all of the items I tasted were truly amazing, I don't think it was worth my 40 minute wait.

I was surprised at how tiny it was inside! But, I guess they don't need much more space then they have. No seating in or outside of the bakery so keep that in mind it's a grab and go place. You can get a box of 6 pastries for roughly $25 and it's completely worth it. Also note that the famous cruffins (croissant/muffins) are not served until later in the morning. I got there right when it opened and there was no line luckily but I was informed that the cruffins aren't ready until 10 or 11 each day. I was bummed at first but I got my box of 6 other delicacies (flavors change daily) and I was NOT disappointed. The salted chocolate chip cookie was to DIE for.

One day you got chocolate banana, and the next you got matcha.

My boyfriend and I arrived at the location at 7:30 hoping to get an infamous cruffin when they opened at 8:00am.  The bakery opens at 8:00 but the cruffins wouldn't be sold until 9:00. On the windows were two different signs, a sign to line up for donuts and a sign to line up for cruffins.  We lined up for the cruffins because they were more popular.  Since there was two of us, they had a special Matcha filled donut that day so I went to that line and got me some donuts while my boyfriend waited in the cruffin line. Then at 9:00 the cruffins were brought out.  Wow, it was like waiting to get a glimpse of the queen. HAHA! It was quite exciting being the first and everyone was flashing photos trying to get a shot of the ooey goodness. I don't like being in people's photos so in that sence I was quite unfortunate. Well, when we got our donuts and cruffins it was taste time.  The cruffins were good.  Just what I expected.  Tasted just like a sugary flaky croissant with chocolate carmel filling shaped like a pretty muffin.  Probably not worth the 1.5 hour wait.  Then it was time to taste the green tea match filled donut.  That in my opinion was better than the cruffin.  Donut was sweet due to the sprinkled sugar but the dough tasted light and not heavy at all.  I don't like alot of filling but it was generously filled. Would I come back again? Sure, probably for the donuts.", "author": "Chanie S."}

The California croissant was intriguing.  Very flaky and crispy croissant with sprinkles of black and white sesame seeds.  Curled inside was seaweed, salmon, and tiny bit of wasabi.

I should count how many \"flaky\" word I use in this review.  I was blessed to go inside and found the place empty, literally empty of people and empty of any baked goods.  There were only 5 items left.  What the heck, I got the California croissant.  I was told that if I wait 10 minutes \"something something\" would come out of the oven.   I kept on asking over and over what was coming out since I didn't catch the name.  Why is it, all the nice baked items have really hard names to remember?  The person at the counter was very patient and nice to explain.  Unfortunately, all I remembered was passion fruit and custard.  I prepaid and left.  When I got back there were people waiting inside and next thing you know a line formed behind me.  I didn't know I was so popular?  Not really, they were there for the goods.  Whatever it is I got, it was delicious and flaky.  The passion fruit jam was very flavorful.  I understand now why they run out of items.

You would think that with something so in demand, they would increase their supply enough to at least last until 10am, but I guess it's a tactic to increase the hype. \n\nHowever, everything else was SO GOOD. \n\nVanilla cream donut - I'm not usually a fan of donuts, but this one was excellent! Crispy, sugary exterior with a fluffy, doughy interior and then the creamy vanilla custard inside. It had the most divine, authentic vanilla bean flavor and I could actually see the vanilla seeds which means they use real vanilla bean! \n\nSalted caramel donut - Same delicious dough as the vanilla cream donut, but the salted caramel filling was too much for me (not much of a caramel fan) but my boyfriend loved this donut! Plenty of filling too. \n\nArtichoke and cheese pastry - yum! Just a really good savory pastry. Plenty of huge artichoke chunks and different types of cheeses. \n\nSushi croissant - was curious to try this one and it was actually really interesting and delicious! Basically a california roll but instead of rice as the carb, you have flakey, buttery croissant.

Very, very sweet though, so I kind of regret ordering 2 because 1 was more than enough.  \n\nOnly $23 for 6 baked goods is actually a pretty good deal considering the quality and freshness of the ingredients used, we were expecting to pay a lot more so we were pleasantly surprised.", "author": "Paige M."}

Sure, their cruffins are good, but are they worth waiting forever for? And in order to get one of those hype boxes, you have to get at least six pastries, so you'll get two cruffins, max, and four...not so good things.

They make a big deal if it, and plenty of reason why. That day's flavor was rocky road. Rocky road for a breakfast pastry? It worked.  The inside was filled with a chocolate pudding almost, and the exterior was covered in sugar. It was a bit of a mess to eat, but it was a delicious mess. My only fault was I waited about an hour or so to eat it so I feel it wasn't as soft as it would be super fresh.  Never the less, this was awesome! Also while there I picked up a blackberry bostock and raspberry filled fried donut. Those were the under dogs right there. I feel those were better than the cruffin itself and not as much hype.

The flavor was Mint Chocolate for that day, and it was delectable. It didn't taste like artificial mint chocolate chip ice cream, it was much fresher and tasted more like actual mint plant. My only issue with the flavor was that there was a lack of the chocolate flavor, but the tiny chocolate balls at the top of the cruffin offered some chocolatey-ness to it. The orange creme cronut was not good at all, it tasted like the rind of an orange. The other pastries they sold were delicious, and I definitely will come back to try more and more of what they have. The employees were super friendly and helpful, and will explain any pastry out of the selection they have available. Just remember to not be rude and hold up the line -- tons of other people want to try the deliciousness too.\n\nTips:\n- Follow them on Instagram. They post flavor updates every week, so that way you can be aware of what you can potentially get in terms of the flavors for the cruffins and cronuts.\n- The flavor normally determines how fast the cronut or cruffin (mainly cruffin) will sell. If it's something deemable as normal, like Mint Chocolate, then there's no need to come too early to wait in a line in the early AM to try it out. If it's something seemingly unique, like Pink Rose Champagne, then come and line up early. We foodies have the same mindset about flavors.\n- Get someone to wait in the car for you. It's much easier to have a system of one person waiting in line while another person stays in the car/looks for parking.\n- Order 6 pastries to get a box for free. If you get less than 6 pastries and still want a box, you'll have to pay $1.50 for the box itself.\n- Take a picture with the \"I got baked in San Francisco\" sign for foodie proof :)\n\nDefinitely give this place a try, it's delicious, but be aware of the flavors so you won't be disappointed.

Below are the things I remembered although I think I got others.  I guess I just remembered the important ones?..\n\nFour Barrel Coffee Flavored Cruffin-\nThe texture of a true croissant (flaky and crispy) enveloping a nice chilled filling of Four Barrel coffee flavored cream.  This was a great combination because Four Barrel coffee has amazing strong flavors.  There was nothing muffin about this pastry but the size and shape, which was a little taller than the usual muffin.  \n\nThe California Croissant-\nAmazing.  Imagine a California roll but instead of rice you wrap the meat of the roll into a croissant.  This too was very flaky and crispy, but the inside was a nice meaty (but not meat) surprise.  If you're on the savory side of food, this a great pastry to get instead of the sweets that you usually get from bakeries. \n\nCustard Filled Donut-\nImagine a jelly donut except the inside is custard.  This was okay and felt like a typical item to have at a bakery.  They do have many different flavors and the custard filling is chilled like in the cruffin.\n\nOverall thoughts, this is a great trendy place that lives up to it's hype.  Would I come here everyday, probably not.  It's pricier than other traditional bakeries, but it's a hipster spot, it's supposed to be.  I came here to try it, and I would go back if I wanted to surprise a friend with a treat or something for their birthday.

For that one you can just walk into the store and they will help you. \n\nThe day I went our flavor was the Lemon Ginger Raspberry cruffin. It was delicious. It was the mix of a sugar coated muffin, a croissant and a donut with frosting inside. I can't do justice to it, but it tasted amazing! If the trip back didn't involve a cross country plane ride for me, I would be back there in a heartbeat.\n\nPro Tips:\n-They only allow 2 cruffins per person, so if you want more than 2 you better have a friend or four waiting in line with you.\n-They don't start serving the cruffins till 9 a.m., so don't go there at 7:30 expecting to get your hands on a cruffin\n-I ended up saving a cruffin that had sat in a moderately warm car all day Thursday and ate it on Saturday morning. (Not that many would be able to resist saving it that many days, but if you do it still tasted good and okay to eat!)", "author": "R C."}

Although it lacked the nuttiness and essence the original candy had. This was a creamy and well balanced hazelnut-chocolate duo of flavors. It was like Brian McKnight and Mariah Carey had a reunion concert in Las Vegas... and 10 years later.. still killed it.\n\nTheir Signature Cruffin, reminded me so much of an old fan favorite of mine (Cream Pan's Strawberry-Banana Custard Croissants). Substitute the muffin for the croissant, add a killer custard and some slices of strawberries (jesus, I need to stop). Anyway this one was just as good, lots of flakiness but not was moist in the center a little dry and a bit more heavy with the sugar. I was hoping for it to be a bit lighter on the sugar coating so I could avoid cavities but sometimes you gotta live it up.\n\nI also tried a ham and cheese bread and their amelia amann. The Ham and Cheese, cannot be commented on simply because I forgot the balance in components (my apologies). However their amann, had nothing on B Patisserie's. It was glossy and sweet but didn't held up with the perfect balance of crispy and flakiness I am accustomed to.\n\nThe Customer Service was excellent, I hope I remembered the right person correctly (I believe it was Bridget). She answered all of my questions and helped me cleared an accidental spill I caused (sorry about that) without leering at me. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed my first tasting so far the only cons are the slightly bit excessive sugar on the Strawberry (the Coffee cream Cruffins, which were tasty in their own right). Despite the location being a bit cramped, perhaps a few more stools or small tabletops would help in seating for guests? Especially if they want a quick (and un-interrupted) bite before venturing back out into the begging vultures of the Tenderloin.\n\n3.5, but bumped up to four due to excellent customer service and another bakeshop to possibly rival Tout Sweet Patisserie and Craftsman and Wolves.", "author": "Ryan M."}

But it just didn't live up to the hype.  In fairness, they sold out of their famous cruffins (around 9:45AM) but given how I felt about all of the other pastries I tasted (we tried 6 in total), I doubt I would have liked the cruffin much (the cashier said the cruffin was similar in flavor to the donuts but with the texture of a croissant...and unfortunately I didn't like the flavor of the donut).  Basically, I felt like it was all heavy handed and not as refined as some of the other bakeries I love.  And I do have a big sweet tooth and am generally happy with any sweet eats. So really bummed I was disappointed.  Here's what we tried and a little review of each:\n\n1.  Chocolate Chip Cookie with Salt on top:  A decent chocolate chip cookie but a little on the sweet side...does not live up to the B. Patisserie chocolate chip cookie (also with salt).  Or he chocolate chip cookie they sell at Fraiche on Fillmore.  (3/5)\n\n2.  Blackberry Bostock:  I enjoyed this but I didn't think it was worth standing in line for.  The tart blackberries were a nice balance with the crusty, buttery french toast like bread.  (4/5)\n\n3.  Chocolate Donut:  Too sweet, just not very good.  Felt heavy, wasn't a light donut which I prefer.  (3/5)\n\n4.  Regular Croissant:  Fine...but not better than Rustic Bakery  (3/5)\n\n5.  California Croissant with smoked salmon inside:  Enjoyed this b/c it is unique.  I thought it was odd that they give you a soy sauce packet to go with it.  It's smoked salmon so it is definitely salty enough and doesn't need the soy sauce (another reason I kind of think the flavors are heavy handed).  (5/5 - didn't use soy sauce).\n\n6.  Ube Pastry:  We asked the lady helping us if it was very sweet and she said no.  I should have trusted my instinct when I saw the thick layer of bright pink frosting on top.  The frosting is too sweet and overpowering.  The ube inside is more subtle.  But the pastry was thick and not as flaky/light as I would have liked.  After first few bites with frosting, we removed all the frosting (and some pastry shell) to make it more edible.  Meh. Least favorite. It's a shame b/c I think it could have been good if it was a lighter pastry shell and just the ube filling.  (1/5)\n\nAll in all, I would never recommend this place to friends...maybe if there weren't a wait it would be OK...but I personally won't go back with or without a wait.  Go to B. Patisserie instead.", "author": "J O."}

We found this place to be almost nauseatingly sugary, despite all the buzz about the studied pastry techniques going on behind the scenes. All of the filled pastries we had (a cruffin and a donut) were ridiculously full of custard, to the point that it was difficult to even get a sense of the pastry as more than just a custard conveying unit. The chocolate in the chocolate croissant was also weirdly sour, and the croissant itself was somewhat gummy and over baked. The people working there were great, but all in all, its not worth the hyped up price tag. If you want to feel this hip, just move to Brooklyn.", "author": "Henry C."}

The pastries just aren't that great. The cruffins are a little oily, the pear Danish was really unspectacular. Nothing that we ordered (2 cruffins, 3 donuts, a Danish) was that great, it all tasted pretty mediocre and like it was made with mediocre ingredients (read: you feel gross and unhealthy after eating these).

Light and airy and filled with a raspberry vanilla creme filling (flavor of the day), it was delicious.  That said I'm not sure its worth waiting in line for two hours but I'm glad I tried it. I feel sorry for the people waiting at the end of the line because they sell out within an hour.

I wasn't too disappointed but moved to the other line to try their other pastries. Sadly, every other pastry I got was nothing to write home about. The apple-filled pastry tasted like it was filled with applesauce which was not my style. This place is typical of some spots in SF where they purposely create scarcity to drive the masses wild. Hence, everyone takes pictures with the signs and posts about how they got one of the oh-so-coveted cruffins. If you are a bakery that runs out of what you are famous for at 8am then I would say you have a failing business. In SF tho, it makes you famous.

I'm not absolutely dying to try one and if I ever get lucky enough to get one - great. If not, that's perfectly fine, too.\n\nI've tried three pastries: croissant, a cherry danish, and an artichoke danish. All were delicious, flakey, and 'light'. \n\nWhat I really like about Mr. Holmes' pastries is his technique. He meticulously layers paper-thin dough upon layer giving his pastries a very layered and unique look. It's tempting to eat layer by layer while eating the pastry, but that would take a very long time considering how many layers are in one pastry, and you'd also be missing out the experience of his goods. I think by doing the layerings makes the pastries crispier. \n\nI also like that he isn't afraid to experiment and try new things like having an artichoke danish. I don't think I've ever seen an artichoke danish elsewhere, but I knew I had to try it when I saw it. \n\nIf you're like me and hate dealing with crowds, going in around 1:30 pm on a weekday is great. The only downfall is the lack of pastries and baked goods, but that's my own fault for not waiting in line at 7 am. :)\n\nAlso, one of the workers told me they only make ~30ish cruffins a week.

Two girls were standing awkwardly outside in spandex and uggs, each with a Starbucks in hand and the very first in line. More basic then the most basic can possibly be basic. I guess they found it funny I took a lyft to the tenderloin at 7am and one proceeded to snicker at me as I got of the car. All good, the one who laughed looked like a horse anyways. Fed her an apple out my hand, brushed her mane and continued on. I got in the main pastry line (read: non cruffin) and luckily I was number 6. I bought a slew of various pastries like a fattythen I quickly switched to the cruffin line, naturally. Saturday is cheat day and I don't play around with these clowns..I go hard, considering how clean I am during the week. Anyways, I was number 5 in the cruffin line. These holmies indicate cruffin availability by handing out stickers to people in line...if you receive one, you're guaranteed two cruffins and a slap on the ass (optional, I opted out). There is no set menu, so you can't pick what you're gonna order beforehand, which is good because you're way too predictable of a person anyways. I was a bit disappointed to see that the cruffin flavor was strawberry milkshake, but needless to say, I devoured my cruffin like Babe Pig In The City (that's the sequel, you uncultured vegetarian). Also made friends with a geneticist in line and his cute three year old son.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-01", "description": "For the weeks leading up to my actual visit to Mr. Holmes, I gushed non-stop about how badly I needed to try the cruffin - basically the SF equivalent to a cronut. When I finally got up early enough on a Sunday to line up for the cruffin, I had such high expectations for the specialty pastry as the smell of butter and sugar wafted down the street. The flavor of the day was chocolate chocolate chip, and the cruffin itself was filled with a chocolate pastry cream and topped with chocolate nibs. After actually trying it, I think calling it a cruffin is extremely misleading - I was expecting a mix between muffin and croissant in every bite, but it's essentially just a croissant in the shape of a muffin. The outside had a little too much cinnamon sugar for my taste, and the cream was a little over the top. However, the intermediate layers were the best, the buttery and flakey croissant layers with just a hint of the chocolate cream. My favorite thing from Mr. Holmes ended up being the California croissant. An extremely creative idea, the California croissant is a croissant filled with smoked salmon and nori. A savory croissant may seem strange, but somehow the flavors came together perfectly with the salty smoked salmon and the buttery pastry dough. I'd go back just for that, but probably wouldn't line up for the cruffin again.", "author": "Ashley T."}

Perhaps I'm spoiled after eating lots of French pastries in past years. I'll try to come back another time for their cruffins and see if they're better than the other pastries.", "author": "Michelle E."}

Their croissant are is soft, buttery in the center with a crispy sweet shell. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.

So a friend and I came early thinking the line for cruffins would start right after it opened, but there wasn't a line established yet so we bought the passionfruit donuts. Oh man, those were soooo good. Every yummy donut bite was accompanied by a little gloop of passionfruit filling and it was just the perfect combo. A refreshing taste of passionfruit and then a little bit of donut to even out the taste. I would definitely come back for the donut. The cruffin however, wasn't what I expected to be, and a little bit of disappointment. I felt like the matcha strawberry cruffin would've been better with just the matcha, but the berry filling kinda made it taste like croissants and jam, although crispier and crunchier. I much would've preferred maybe hazelnut filling or something. It was pretty expensive, which made me sad, but it's the hype right now so I guess that's how it'd work. The employees here seem to work really hard and are friendly though, so there must be a reason why their pastries are so expensive. Will come back for donuts, but cruffins--not so much. At least I won't have to wait in an hour and a half line next time!", "author": "Bonnie T."}

I excitedly dragged my sister there at 8:25 this morning and was surprised to see that the line was not as long as I had expected for a Sunday...but the line soon wound around the corner of the street. At 8:45, a staff came out to announce the flavor of the day and pass out stickers to buy the cruffin (2 per person). Once the cruffins came out at 9, the line moved pretty quickly. Today's cruffin flavor was banoffee (banana+coffee+toffee). The wait was totally worth it...the flavor and texture of the cruffins were totally on point. The cruffins had a flaky and sugary exterior and was filled with a buttery and rich cream. The cream was mostly dominated by the bananas, so I didn't taste much coffee or toffee. It wasn't a big deal though, because it was still delicious! I'll definitely be back to try the donuts and their other beautiful goodies next time!", "author": "Kathleen H."}

We thoroughly enjoyed the Amelie Amann - flaky and perfectly sweet. Banana creme filled donut was outstanding. The ham and cheese pastry was good too. Items are around $4 each. Order 6 pastries to get their cute box. Oh and a note, even though Yelp says this is Lower Nob Hill, it definitely feels like its in the Tenderloin.

Almost didn't attempt to stop by because of other reviewers' comments about the long line. Well, we decided to drive by last Sunday around 11am and see if there was a line. To our delight, there wasn't! \n\nSo I went in and picked up 2 cruffins (flavor for the day was S'mores), a California Croissant and a donut (orange and passion fruit filling I believe). The donut was fresh tasting, but wasn't anything memorable. At $3.50 a piece, it lacked value. My hubby said he California Croissant wasn't special either and that the salmon tasted very salty. And finally, the cruffins. I liked the texture of the cruffins, but apart from the marshmallow sitting on top, there was nothing S'mores about it. The chocolate cream tasted sort of strange - ended up just eating the cruffins and avoiding the filling. Hubby is a big fan of flaky pastry like croissant, but even to him, the cruffins wasn't anything spectacular. I'm actually shocked to read that there's a 2 cruffins per person limit because I can hardly imagine anyone liking them so much that they will buy more than a couple at a time. We feel this is unfortunately a hyped-up place that we wouldn't recommend or visit again.\n\nOn a positive but less important note, I really like the little cute pink paper bags with gold lettering that the goodies comes in though!", "author": "Tanya Y."}

I'm guessing from her angry demeanor towards me, that it's every day. I ordered a sweet & then stepped over to the register after she tossed it in a bag while having a personal conversation with another worker. Both looked at me without acknowledging me & continued their conversation without even giving me a total. Instead of interrupting these workers from doing the job they're getting paid to do. I held my iPhone out towards the Square payment machine when suddenly the angry worker blurted out \"you wanna use google pay?\" I said yes & she said \"then why didn't you tell us that?\". I responded that I didn't want to interrupt the personal conversation she was having with her coworker & she then replied \"all you have to do is open your mouth and speak\". So, instead I'm now opening Yelp so that everyone else can read what I experienced & hopefully this angry worker learns a lesson that when you're on the clock & there's a paying customer standing in front of her, that you cease all personal conversation & do the job you're being paid to do - serve customers with a smile & use proper etiquette when addressing them, since without these customers, you won't have a job to be angry at paying customers. I told my friends what happened right afterwards & they said they've had similar experiences with this same angry worker & that they try & avoid her since she's always so unpleasant to them too.", "author": "hot t."}

Varsity House Gym likely saved my life. \n\nI am a grandma in my 60s. I joined VHG as a participant in their Six Week Challenge last spring. At that time I was a size 14 with high cholesterol and osteoporosis. My endocrinologist warned me that if I did not lose weight and lower my blood sugar level that I'd have to begin medication for pre-diabetes, which seemed to me like the beginning of the end. I couldn't run, could hardly do a sit up; I was truly out of shape. Witnessing my health deteriorate, I felt like I was in a rowboat without paddles being swept towards a massive waterfall. And then I heard about Varsity House Gym. \n\nVarsity House Gym does not look like any other gym, and I've been to the best. Apart from the partial football field occupying the center of the facility, flanked by what I've come to call, \"serious gym equipment\", the kind professional athletes use to train, VHG does not rely upon typical gym machines. \n\nThe Six Week Challenge began with an enlightening lecture by one of the VHG owners, Joe, who taught the Challenge group about healthy eating. I mistakenly thought that I was eating healthfully; organic means nothing if one is eating the wrong organic foods. That lecture alone was a life changer.\n\nNotwithstanding, six months have elapsed. My endocrinologist called me earlier today to tell me that my osteoporosis had improved; I now only have osteopenia, and I hope to do even better in the future.  Moreover, I am down to a size eight, I am no longer pre-diabetic (not even close) my cholesterol is normal and I can run! I didn't even think that was possible six months ago. I am incredibly strong, feel great both mentally and physically, and to borrow a line from Bob Dylan - \"I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now.\" \n\nDue of the personal nature of this review, I am not revealing my name, however I highly recommend VHG. Members are treated like family and I will likely be able to spend many more years with mine because of the program and expertise of the staff at VHG. \n\nA grateful Varsity House Gym member.", "author": "C A."}

It smells *wonderful*!  \n\nAnd so, I met Ry, and heard about Mr. Holmes, which is opening a storefront at 1042 Larkin, but has been selling wholesale for several months now. Ry then he told me to wait a bit, only to come back with an amazing, crisp-yet-moist and rich plum pastry, with what appeared to be a gelee that the plums were set into. The tartness, the sweetness, the occasional bright mark of tart lemon in the gelee... really, really good. And along with the plum pastry, a wonderful, serious scone. \n\nThe whole experience triggered those times in my youth when I visited England, and had tart fruits and serious scones. Obviously, Ry must have experience with preparing pastries on the continent, but those more northerly, tart, rich, hearty aesthetics were there too. Wonderful! I love Jane on Larkin, but Mr. Holmes' choice of flavors just feels less sterile and more robust.

Their flavors change daily, so basically you can't go too often. I recommend that you choose at least six items to get your baked goods in a box. If you order five or less, they are put in bags. Fine, but clearly not the same experience. Although I've been over twenty times, I've yet to time visit to get a long sought over cruffins. Somehow, I don't feel bad about that when I have a chocolate bacon fat stolen or pear and blue cheese Danish. Their donuts are melt in your mouth perfect.

Their rooms are clean, lovely, tastefully decorated, their prices are not inflated AND, the most important of all, pets are free. Anyone staying in a Red Roof Inn, who has a furry friend accompanying them might want to show the hotel the respect they deserve by cleaning up after any accident your furry friend has that, more than likely, is due to your negligence in not taking them out when they needed to go. A motel right next door which, in my opinion, was a s$%hole, didn't accept animals at all, so what does that tell you?

We arrived around 30 min before closing on Friday.. I wish we would have read the reviews closely before arriving. In any event... We arrived and were rushed to pick what we wanted. (In hindsight, I shouldn't have ordered anything). Of course the cruffins were gone but we decided to choose other items because we drove over right away and didn't want to leave empty handed. The gentleman that helped me was really awesome and basically told me when to come, what to purchase and what the best items are. I ordered bread pudding, chocolate cookie and pear and blue cheese pastry. The woman that was behind the counter was exceptionally rude. She totally rushed me out of the way and yelled at her co worker about how she had to help other customers and how the line was getting long. (my sister had just completed her order, she was behind me and there was one person behind her. We had probably been there all of 6 min at this time). The gentleman that was helping me also mentioned to her (in a low voice, don't be rude) She followed that by saying that there is a line and she wanted to keep it moving. Customer service...He received an A and she obviously received an F.  IDK if I'm even interested in returning. The items that I bought were OK. I wouldn't pay to cross the bridge to get them. I am sure there is somewhere in Oakland that I can go to. Maybe one day I'll either go back or find another place with them. Making them from scratch is such a daunting task.", "author": "keenia b."}

I do not wait in line for much, least of all pastries, no matter how good. And especially when an artificially created supply \"problem\" is the cause of the line. I'll be alive long enough to try Cruffins when they are no longer the rage. No, I'm reviewing the Chocolate Chip cookies which were delivered by Uber. They are $3 each. Background: I got a free Halloween sugar cookie from Batter Bakery (also by Uber) which was fantastic, so I went to get a chocolate Chip cookie at the Kiosk @ Calif & Kearny. It was great, just as good as the sugar, but was $3.50. That one was about 50% larger than say a Mrs. Fields. Not a great value, but a truly great cookie. The next day Mr. Holmes had their cookies at $6 for 2, so I decided to take a shot as they were a little cheaper. I was not disappointed. The cookies are HUGE! They are twice the size of Batter's (making them 3X as big as a Mrs. Fields) And their are a near-perfect consistency, crispy edges and exterior and chewy interior. They are a hair less good than Batter's, but the best hands down are from Kako (which I don't think you can get anymore.) I'd rate the Holmes cookies at about a 4.5 out of 5 for the quality and the best value for a gourmet cookie you can get in SF. But I did nick the bakery itself another half star for the line \"problem\" stated above. I heard about this in NYC about a year ago and was appalled that people would wait in line for an hour to get a pastry. While I'm all for a business maximizing its profit, I, myself, will not be inconvenienced in addition to paying premium prices for a product. One or the other, brother.", "author": "Jeff S."}

This is a place that has the laminating right on, and isn't afraid to bake a croissant until it's a nice golden brown. This chocolate croissant was flaky, yet tender, and flavorful. Everything it should be. I dare say I found a chocolate croissant to rival my favorite one at La Farine. In fact, Mr. Holmes' chocolate croissant may just be a little better (sorry, La Farine!).

I am not quite sure what one of the reviewers was talking about when he/she wrote about the bakery's aroma in the air a block away.   All I could smell was the homeless' pee on Larkin.  But this review is not about that.    We did not have the privilege of tasting the infamous cruffins.  In facts, we did not have the privilege of tasting anything that were mentioned in the reviews.   The only things available at 1:00 PM on a Sunday were a few savory danishes and some chocolate chip cookies.   When asked if more were to be made, the answer was \"No\".  Usually, everything is sold out around 3:30.  Because of the holidays, it was earlier today.   I hope the manager takes note and changes the store throughput to better serve its customers.  Or perhaps, this is the strategy to hype up the business.  \nOk, back to my purchase - what a difficult decision to make since we had such a wide selection of two items.  Cookies or danishes?   We settled for two danishes for $4.50 each.   Let me tell you, I regretted paying that much money as soon as I bit into one.  It was so dry and tasteless.  The danish tasted like it was made yesterday and left in the open until the time I picked it up.   \nPeople, if you want to find out what the hype is all about, go ahead and get in line for some over priced pastries.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-05-24", "description": "Here's how your visit is going to go: \n\nYou decide you want a cruffin, because why would you pay ~$5 for a doughnut unless it was something special? You're not going to waste time finding parking or dealing with the line before work, so you pick Saturday. You wake up at whatever time it takes you to get there before 830. It's 830 because they only make one batch of the things 90% of people are there to buy, and a line starts forming around 8 for them. So, as the employees will happily tell you, they \"sell out\" of cruffins about 30 minutes before they start selling them. Now you wait in line, the first half an hour for them to start selling cruffins, and the next hour and a half (if you're towards the end of the line) to actually get to the counter. The employee will come out to tell you if there's even a slight chance at getting one, but if you're towards the end of the line the only way to find out for sure is to actually wait the hour and a half to see how many cruffins the people in front of you decide to buy. If you miss it, you will only have the exact same 2 hour song and dance to face on Sunday. Also, since the cruffin line is for cruffins ONLY, after that hour and a half you won't even have the option to pay $5 for some other pastry, you will have to go wait in that line first.\n\nSo that's my one star. I'm not reviewing the product, they're lovely. I'm reviewing the exploitative, manufactured scarcity BS that they use to sell their product. There is no way to get your hands on the product (on a weekend) in less than 2 hours at 8 in the morning. They don't make more before opening, the don't make a second batch after opening, they don't do any of the things they could do to serve their customers, despite knowing exactly what the demand is.", "author": "Evan S."}

While excellent pastry, etc. there are just as good that don't have a wait line of an hour or more...and if you want a cruffin you have to wait even longer and they don't even start serving them until an hour after they start selling everything else...PLUS if you want items other than Cruffins you have to go back into another line!!!

It's a shame that the quantity is so limited. I would definitely had purchased more than the 2/person limit. I actually stayed in the line despite the fact they ran out of the coveted stickers several persons before me and lucked out. I also purchased the croissants which were excellent though I'm indifferent to the light sugar glaze treatment. The doughnuts themselves were disappointing, but I enjoyed the fresh taste of the fillings. Given the opportunity, I would return.", "author": "Jess C."}

Jonathan the main contact person for the business is so amazing. Very knowledgeable, very responsive, has a deep knowledge of the plumbing products that are out there and able to give sound recommendations. \nThree weeks ago I called on them to fix a clog in one of the toilets in our building. Same day that I called they came to the rescue. Did the work almost at a blink of an eye. He told me then that said toilet needs to be replaced, its old and its flushing mechanism is almost done in. He recommended then what toilet to get when the time comes for us to replace. Today they were back to replace the said toilet. He made the right call and again they were here with all the parts, got the job done in record time with the least amount of disruption and they left the bathroom cleaner than how they found it.\nThey are now our go-to folks for all our plumbing needs.

The guy behind the counter told us that the more popular items sell out by noon and they've been making more each day, but they still keep selling out! I wasn't upset, though, since we did get there so close to closing. Luckily there was one last Ferrero Rocher choux bomb and I got a pear danish. The guy said it was a similar texture to a cream puff. And it was a bite of heaven! Imagine Ferrero Rocher but so much creamier. I must come back to get more! The pear danish was pretty good too. And the owner gave us an extra danish since we were his last customers of the day. Such a nice guy! And his staff is very nice too! Our cashier suggested that we get there before noon next time so we can see all that they have to offer.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-16", "description": "Yes this place has alot of hype and yes, I totally think it's worth it.  The cruffin is ridiculously flakey and well built considering all of the moist creamy delicious filling.  I think the timing is essential considering it's not something that you want to let get stale or soggy.  The line is honestly pretty random.  Yes, it can wrap around half the block at times but I was very lucky swinging by on a Tuesday morning just after 9:30... the line had just died down to nothing and a fresh tray of cruffins came out!  It's all about time and chance... it's absolutely worth the time if you get the chance.  But even if you miss the rare and illusive cruffin, the other baked goods in uncommon flavors are absolutely delicious and equally flakey and buttery and great to try.  A trip to this bakery will never be wasted time!  From the california croissant made with seaweed and smoked salmon and pickled ginger to the and chocolate and pistachio flavored Kouign-amanns to the fresh filled donuts, there's honestly plenty of other amazing delicacies to enjoy.

So two bites: 1. A pumpkin bacon spiced quiche. Result: The best thing in my mouth. 2. Giant blueberry chocolate cream muffin situation. Result: the best thing in my mouth.

They were adorable, enthusiastic about the goods, and sweet. Got most pastries as a gift for a friend. He immediately hid them so I don't know what his favorites were and I didn't get to try any. Luckily I had separately bought the cruffin which had a fruit flavor that day. I can't remember what kind of fruit but I don't really dig fruit with my pastries. Despite this, I shoved the cruffin down my throat in the car bf I got home. It was really good but I would like to try non fruit in the future. Also got the CA croissant. It was put in a plastic container with the top shut.  By the time I ate it the croissant was mushy. Ewww. Next time I should probably put it in a bag and leave it open part way or just eat the croissant right away. The salmon inside was decent, but even though I love salmon, it wasn't my thing.

I finally realized the first two people in line never moved, although it appeared the store was empty. finally said something to the people next to me, and it was then they said I was in line for the cruffins... ?!

I walked in and proceeded to order but not before I told the gal it as my first time there and perhaps it would make sense to have a sign or something for newbies like myself so they don't line up unnecessarily...
