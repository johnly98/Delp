I've never felt so devalued as a customer. I ordered online and came in to pick up my order. Walked up to the register and the lady working the register did not look up or acknowledge me at all. So I waited and stood there...awkwardly. And when a second lady came up and finally looked available, I tried to ask about my take out order. But the first woman butted in and told me in an extremely rude tone that I had to wait a minute and they were very busy (ringing up credit cards). Collecting that money is so much more important. Obviously if she said that the moment I went up I would have been happy to stand aside and wait until they were ready. She treated me like I had no manners when honestly she needs to work on hers.

Personally, I like the soup as spicy and zesty as possible, which the restaurant did, providing a generous portion of spring onions. The only slight negative is that the meat was kind of bland. I think for most or all the pho there is no small or large portion. Other than that, you get a decent amount of noodles and the soup is addicting! A differentiating factor is the omelette dish, which is savory pork encased in a crispy omelette - excellent flavors! \n\nThankfully, the place is rather affordable compared to other Vietnamese restaurants. A bowl of Pho is around $10. On the expensive side, the avocado milkshake is delicious, but comes at a hefty price of $6.00. The only kinds of downsides to this place is that it is on the small side, so bringing in a big group would be difficult. Also, a few of the small sauce dishes were not 100% clean. The waiters and waitresses have pretty good attitudes, from the few times I've been there.", "author": "Louis Suo L."}

This place gets busy during peak hours since there are only about 10 tables. It's a small restaurant, family-owned and the boss lady wearing green is badass, friendly, and efficient (her brother runs the Yummy Yummy on Irving). I've tried a couple items but will rave about two that I order often: pho #25 and #4 bbq pork spring roll appetizer.\n\nTheir pho #25 is my favorite. I love everything, the broth - light and flavorful, noodles - not overcooked or soggy at all, and particularly love their beef balls--they're quite big and has a springiness texture to it. They only serve the pho in one size, but you can add extra noodles for an additional charge. If you order pho, they also give you a plate of bean sprouts, jalape\u00f1os, basil, cilantro, and lemons. \n\nI also enjoy the bbq pork spring rolls appetizer #4. The bbq pork is charbroiled and it's SO good, wrapped in a bed of noodles and lettuce. Comes in 6 pieces.

I asked if they can add tendons with it and the staff was great in adding what I wanted.\n\nI have to say, tendons seem to be a hit or miss at some of the Vietnamese restaurants I've eaten at - some are hard which I don't like and others are deliciously slimy and soft. The tendons were definitely on point here. There was something about the noodles that set this restaurant apart from previous ones...they were more firm in texture. Whatever noodles they used, it was delicious!!\n\nI will say that the staff seemed a bit unorganized at one point. One of the ladies came up to me and offered me a bahn mi until I told her that that's not what I ordered.

Mostly because my most recent visit dates back to my pre-Yelping days (over eight years ago!), but also because, despite how long it's been, I vividly recall never feeling all that impressed by their food.  Granted, my experience was limited to just their pho, but I can't say I ever felt all that motivated to try anything else either.\n\nFast forward a ways and my friend and I found ourselves at Y & Y for lunch (Yummy Yummy's sister restaurant).  In this case though, I was actually kind of excited since I was both trying something new while also indirectly giving Yummy Yummy another shot (I've been curious).  While I can't say how similar the menu looks, it's definitely smaller in comparison.  Just like the restaurant itself; it looks about half the size (if that), so don't be surprised if you see a line.\n\nSince I didn't see my go-to on the menu (Rare Steak and Tendon), I opted to get (#26) PHO TAI NAM - Beef Pho with Rare Steak and Well Done Flank ($9.25).  As a whole, my order felt a bit small for the money.  However, relative to the bowl's size, there was a good amount of beef and the ratio of meat-to-noodles was fair.  What's more, the latter had just the right bite.  Sadly though, the broth fell short.  It may have looked the part, but it wasn't as beefy as its appearance suggested and it needed more body.\n\nAs for the rest of the menu (starters, vermicelli, rice plates, etc.), I can't say how good they might be, but the photos and reviews on Yelp seem to do them justice.  Still, for me, THREE AND A HALF STARS rounded down (for now).  While it wasn't explicitly bad, nothing about the food sets Y & Y apart from the majority of pho restaurants out there.

Not much pickle flavor from the veggies, spice from jalapenos or freshness from cilantro. Plus, there just just the smallest swipe of pate.

The roommate and I have had our fair share of mediocre bowls of noodle soup, but Y&Y's pho broth tasted like water. Granted, it was beef flavored water, but it was pretty bad. No amount of sriracha or hoisin sauce could save this soup.

I got the pork with vermicelli noodles and my other friends got the five-spice chicken with vermicelli noodles. The pork was flavorful and the noodles tasted pretty fresh, but when I tried my friends' chicken some parts were tough to chew... It could definitely have been more tender and flavorful.\n\nOh! One thing that I did like was their spring rolls!! They were crispy on the outside and chewy (in a good way haha) on the inside, and the texture was awesome and pretty unique compared to other spring rolls I've had. It wasn't crunchy and hard, but crispy and chewy. Mmm :)\n\nTheir service was great and they kept on refilling our waters, so that was a big plus! If I could I would give this place 3.5 stars, but since I can only pick between 3 or 4 I chose 3 because they were known for their Five-Spice Chicken with Vermicelli and it disappointed me and my friends; the dish wasn't as amazing as I had expected coming from previous customers. \n\nOverall this place is pretty solid, and on the cheaper side, so regardless of this review you should check it out if you're in the area!", "author": "Joy K."}

Customers started pouring in around 6. I was pleased to see that their menu included a lot of traditional Vietnamese dishes that most places in SF don't have like Bun Bo Hue and Banh Canh Cua. \nMy party ordered the Carpaccio appetizer (raw beef), Pho Dat Biet, Beef rice plate, and Banh Canh Cua. The raw beef was perfectly thin. Some places have thicker cuts and its just kinda gross to have a mouthful of chewy raw meat. The Pho didn't stand out too much but it was still good. The Banh Cann Cua however, was the best I've had in SF! It's a seafood based thicker broth and it comes with two pieces of crab, pork, and pork blood. Yum. \n\nIt surprises me that some reviews say that the service is bad. When I came I thought the waitress was great! She was so nice and made sure we were happy.

There is a coffee shop across the street from Y & Y that I had been to before. Once I realized that I was familiar with the area I proceeded on towards Y & Y. First impressions, this place is small. Took a seat inside and was given a menu and began to review the menu items. I knew I wanted BEEF and that is exactly what I go. My lady got the SPRING ROLLS and some barbecue chicken with rice. \n\nI got the spicy beef soup and it was AMAZING. This was the first time that I could not finish my meal. I was even taken back that I left food in the bowl. They give you a big portion for the soup so you had better be HUNGRY and ready to CHOW DOWN. \n\nGood stuff here.

The bun bo hue was alright. I thought some of the spices in the broth were too powerful to the point that I couldn't enjoy the flavor of the meat and the noodles too. It needed a bit more balance. The five spice chicken pho was alright. However, my boyfriend thought it was very good. He enjoyed the broth and the crispy skin of the chicken. Since the broth was clean and simple, it paired well with the fried chicken. Still, I wasn't completely sold and don't think I'd order it again. I thought the clear winner, though, was their imperial egg rolls. These were probably some of the better ones I've had in a long time. The wrapping was perfectly fried (nice and golden!) and the filling was delicious. I love that it came with a small garnish of greens and noodles too. \n\nThe service was fine. The restaurant isn't very big, but it's orderly, efficient, and bright. It appears they have a solid clientele and a diverse one too -- younger, older, Asian, non-Asian, etc. Even at an off-hour (we went around 2 PM), it was relatively busy.

It has all the right ingredients of a bun bo hue. Broth was good, flavor was ok. But it was NOT bun bo hue. If it was called pork soup or by any other name, it would be a decent bowl of soup. But it didn't taste like bun bo hue. If you are looking for an authentic bowl of bun bo hue, this is not the place for you. I was in the SF area and had a crazy craving for bun bo hue. I ate the entire bowl, it was a decent bowl of soup but I could not come to the conclusion if it was bun bo hue.\n\nI think the same can be said of the other items we ordered. The foods were not bad, it was just not what it should be. To simply put, it's \"Vietnamese\" foods made for non-Vietnamese. \n\nWhat is most perplexing is the entire menu is Vietnamese. At first glance it was an impressive variety. Some of dishes you don't see even in most Authentic Vietnamese restaurants. But after 4 orders, it was clear this restaurant is not meant for those who know Viet foods.\n\nI would give this restaurant 3 stars on taste alone, but only 2 stars because of inauthenticity. You can call your dish anything you want, but if you call it pho, it must taste like pho. And if you call it bun bo hue (my speciality ;)), then darn it, it must taste like bun bo hue!", "author": "Quinn V."}

We had been lazy all morning and he was in a craving for Vietnamese food. The only other Vietnamese restaurant we've been to in SF is Yummy Yummy, which is the sister restaurant to Y&Y. We liked Yummy Yummy so there was no doubt that we wouldn't like this restaurant also. \n\nBecause it was the late afternoon, there restaurant wasn't too full and we were able to be get seated right away. For an appetizer, we ordered spring rolls. I had Bun Bo Hue and my boyfriend had Imperial Rolls with Five Spice Chicken. The spring rolls were huge! Too many noodles in my opinion, which meant that as soon as I took a bite, the roll kind of broke apart or things started to fall out. There was also a chili pepper picture next to the Bun Bo Hue, so I knew it would be spicy but I wasn't expecting for it to be THAT spicy. If you like that burning feeling on your lips, then this will definitely do that for you. The Imperial Rolls and the Five Spice Chicken was something new to me. I personally did not enjoy them as much as my boyfriend. Maybe I don't like the change from ordinary egg rolls to Imperial rolls. It seemed like it was made with a different paper because they came out fried differently. \n\nOverall, this place was pretty good. We were immediately given a pot of hot tea as we got seated.

They used to be inside an Asian grocery store on Clement St. by 8th and we used to go there almost every other Sunday to share one of their awesome and bargain bahn mi's and chicken noodle soup (with the vermicelli noodle option)  for brunch between ourselves.  \n\nAs many bahn mi aficionados know, the perfectly baked and toasted bread that completes this stye of sandwich can make or break it.  Bahn mi's must be a careful combo of the baked, then toasted French roll and the contents inside, including the pickled veges, jalapenos, which give it the slight heat, crisp and tangy offset to the array of pate and BBQ meats.  \n\nWe love our bahn mi's,  we love it here best, and we are so stoked Y&Y re-opened in a new space on 914 Clement St (by 10th Ave) after almost a year they moved out of their other location.  \n\nWhat makes their chicken noodle soup stand out is their fresh made daily home made chicken broth and the optional vermicelli noodles (no longer an option on their new menu, you'll have to ask the server), not the standard \"pho ga\" type noodles most of us are familiar with.  The lady who worked there before, who we recognized when we went in on Friday 29JUN12 (a day after their grand opening in their new spot), must be one of the owners, and we were glad to see her still there, smiling and proud of her new set up.\n\nTheir new location takes over the recently retired brothers who owned the Japanese restaurant Miyoshi's that used to be in this spot.  It's great to have actual tables to sit down at now, spread out, a larger menu selection, and they also now have BEER.  \n\nWe also tried their deep fried chicken wings for the first time on Friday and those were pretty darn tasty too.  They even prepare them with the little \"French style handles\" for easier grasping and eating.  \n\nWe look forward to trying new and different things on their expanded menu, but we know that we can always count on their bahn mi's and their chicken noodle soup.  We hope they can keep up the quality and taste standards they had when they were just the little hole in the wall deli.  From what we could tell when we tried them the other night, we were not disappointed.  Our every other Sunday brunch ritual at this little affordable, tasty Vietnamese gem is back on our lifestyle schedule for SF living.\n\nY&Y is one of those small businesses that makes SF such a great city for food (affordable eats too) and the Inner Richmond neighborhood a destination street for us.

I think they just opened recently and place was packed during lunch time, the dinning area is not that big seats maybe 30ppl max. They have varieties of Vietnamese dishes from the sandwich to pho to rice dishes. They also have a pretty good drink menu. \n\nSince we were starving we ordered the following:\n1) Shrimp spring rolls, taste just like the ones out there nothing special, the dipping sauce was a bit sweet.\n\n2) Lemon beef, raw beef with peanut and lemon sauce, one of the best! if you like beef carpaccio this is the Vietnamese version of it\n\n3) Pho, of course you have to order the pho to see whether this restaurant is authentic or not and I have to say theri PHO is one of the best I ever tasted\n\n4) Five Spice chicken with rice, also one of the best I ever tasted, but I have to say the other Vietnamese restaurant down the street is a bit better but YY's its not bad at all.\n\nFor drinks we ordered the Viet ice coffee and grass jelly both were great! The other plus is for the wait staff, they were actually very friendly and helpful, smiles a lot and willing to help you.

Perfectly fried and coated with sticky sweet/salty sauce, topped with a bunch of saut\u00e9ed onions, it was the best thing I tried at Y&Y. \n\nThe bad - The pho. So I'm not Vietnamese and I can't judge on what is truly authentic. But I've had the chance to eat at many Vietnamese restaurants in Garden Grove and San Jose with my Vietnamese friends. The broth at Y&Y is the first time I tasted broth that felt \"wrong\". It was different than any both I've tasted before and it wasn't the good kind of different. The taste was overpowered with something weird making me think they did not balance this broth right.\n\nThe OK- Bun Bo Hue. This packed a punch and it was great for the rainy day, but not the best I've had.\n\nI'll probably never come back here unless I lived close by. I suggest trying somewhere else, unless you are close and too lazy to go somewhere else.", "author": "Julie K."}

Let it be known that we've been here twice in one week because it was so good the first time.  \n\nI got banh canh, and he got mien ga. They were both DELICIOUS! You can taste distinct differences between the broths and know they use different recipes for all their other soups too. \n\nI recommend getting banh canh if you aren't too hungry because you can always bring it home and eat the leftovers later. The noodles don't expand like pho noodles. \n\nThe mien ga broth was a little sweeter than the banh canh. Don't really believe they use MSG because I wasn't dehydrated after. \n\nThe second time, I got bun rieu - it was okay; probably won't be getting it again anytime soon. I also tried the bun bo kho which was really good. I think it would taste better with bread, but the noodles are still wonderful. \n\nThere always seems to be good street parking, which is always a perk to me. \n\nEven though the service isn't the best, like most Asian restaurants, this is by far my favorite Vietnamese noodle place in the city.

I've never had Yummy Yummy before (on Irving), but have heard so-so reviews about it.\n\nBetween the three of us, we ordered:\nBanh Xeo (Vietnamese Crepe)\nSpring Rolls\nBanh Canh Cua\nBun Bo Hue\nGrilled Pork Vermicelli\nBanh Beo with Cha Lua\n\nThe banh xeo wasn't as crispy as we would have liked, although the portion was big. However, after digging into it, we realized that there was hardly any meat/shrimp in it. The filling consisted mostly of bean sprout.. meat to bean sprout ratio was like 1:100 practically. I understand that this is not home, and you can't stuff your banh xeo to the brim in the interest of making money, but at least ground up some pork and spread it out or something... the fish sauce was too sweet for our tastes.\n\nSpring Rolls: Decent size, only came with shrimp. I'm used to having both the sliced pork belly AND shrimp in my spring rolls. You're already slicing the shrimp in half, throw in some pork belly slices! (Although, we may have accidentally ordered spring rolls that only came with shrimp? Not sure.)\n\nBanh Canh Cua: The soup had a weird consistency, and was very bland. Not much to say about this dish.\n\nBun Bo Hue: When this came out first, we all thought, \"Ooooh\". It looked very promising. Deep red soup base with tons of spices, 3 slices of the cha lua (pork cake), couple cubes of pork blood, and some pork meat. The broth ended up being really bland, despite the red coloring and abundance of spices floating around. The pork, however, was really tender, and you could tell they slow cooked it in the bland broth.\n\nGrilled Pork Vermicelli: I didn't personally get a taste of this, but according to my sister, it was decent. Pork had good smokey flavor and was tender. The only thing is that the fish sauce they make here is a little too sweet for our tastes, so that negatively affects the other dishes that include fish sauce.\n\nBanh Beo with Cha Lua: Decent. Not much to say about it...\n\nOverall: The bill for these 6 dishes came out to be $47.xx, which isn't that bad. This is more of a 2.5 star, but I'm going to round up because the service was very friendly and accomodating (although they did not speak Vietnamese).\n\nI understand they used to have a Vietnamese sandwich store located in a nearby supermarket... maybe we should have tried the sandwiches.", "author": "Munnie T."}

I looked at the menu and found the soup and ordered it by name. I had to point to it, cuz they had this confused look, like I really wanted that soup?? Fine!!! I don't want them to screw it up.   Within a minute, I given a fork:). .... Seriously !!! I'm over this!! I really need to ask why Chinese people really think certain South East Asian cultures...  can't use one, or prefer a fork.

I started to eat a bit cuz I was so hungry, but after a minute I asked the waiter if this was Bun Bo Hue... He had to get someone else, cuz he obviously could not speak English, really I don't care about wether he could or could not.   The other waiter explained to me that they took many of the ingrediants out because only Asians prefer them!!!!!.. WWWWTTTTTTFFFFF!!!!!  Another employee came over and we had a \"discussion\":). She offered to correct my order, so I gave her back my soup, but instead of bringing me a new order , she just microwaved the missing ingrediants in another bowl and brought it to me!!! NICE!!! Very NICE!!!!!! THey still forgot the Pork Hock/knuckle... Pretty much the MAIN ingrediant!!  \nWell.. The side of Veggies was all wrong as well ..

My friend Lara and I stumbled on this Inner Richmond dining spot on a Sunday evening while looking for some Pho to devour.  When we arrived, there wasn't a seat to be found, but the wait list was short.  The dual-purposed hostess/server seated us within 5 minutes, and placed a pot of hot tea in front of us as we were seated - very welcome on a chilly night.  The menu is extensive, and is comprised of the usual suspects in your typical Vietnamese restaurant: pho, rice plates, vermicelli noodles, etc.  The waitress was very pleasant and did not try to oversell, in fact, she told us we may be ordering too much and suggested that we scale down a bit, which we did, and yes, she was right.  Our order of spring rolls arrived shortly after we placed our order.  The rolls were fresh.  The sauce was a good texture and very flavorful.  The pho arrived as we finished the last bite of our spring rolls.  We both ordered the same thing: rare steak with beef balls.  The usual accompaniments: citrus wedges, bean sprouts, basil, peppers, and cilantro were all very fresh and complemented the hot bowl of pho.  The broth was clear, flavorful, and the noodles were perfect, not sticky at all.\n\nI'm a fan, and I'll be back.  The food, and service were great.  The two bowls of pho and the spring rolls put us back only $24 - what a bargain!  \n\nI wish I would have asked our server her name, she was great!

They forgot my sister's dish and did nothing to compensate for it aside for removing it from the bill. The food overall was just ok to me. The bun bo made me nauseous which is unusual for me. \n\nOverall I'm glad new businesses are popping up and I welcome this place to keep up the competition for good Vietnamese food which is rare in SF.

I've been to solid Vietnamese places down in Orange County and decided to give this place a try.  First off, plus for having the USC-Notre Dame football game on (more of a bonus point).  \n\nAs for the food, I tried the Five Spice Chicken (their house specialty) with vermicelli.  The chicken was juicy and it had a good flavor to it (not spicy at all, more of a peppery taste).  The chicken rested on the vermicelli, shredded carrots, some lettuce and sprouts.  Next, I had some Pho with rare steak.  It came in a good size bowl with the normal fixings (sprouts, peppers, basil, cilantro, onions, and lemons -- not limes).  I'm personally more of a fan of pho with lime juice, but that' okay.  Each dish was about $8 which I find reasonable.\n\nAll in all, it was a worthy, reasonably-priced dinner!", "author": "Kevin L."}

The offering is your standard Viet variety with Pho, rice dishes, vermicelli and appetizers with a lot of additional hard-to-find favorites as well. We had the Bo Bia rolls, Bun Bo Hue and Banh Hoi with pork and all 3 were flavorful, but slightly smaller than I would have expected. \n\nAll in all, a good quick meal with friendly service in a good location.", "author": "Julie T."}

I got the Spicy Chicken Curry and rice and stepmom got the Beef Ball Pho, good reports from me on the spicy cury, pretty spicy, but not overly done.

I have eaten at every Vietnamese place on clement between arguello and 30th - and most on Geary. \n\nTakeout: pho tai nam and bun thit nuong cha gio. \n\nPho: disappointing. While the eye round is of easily the highest quality I've ever had in SF, the flank was so so. Worse the overall quantity of food was truly about half of what you'd get elsewhere. It would have been comical if it were not so disappointing. I are a large bowl of cereal after this meal. Thats not normal. Finally, the broth seemed like it was built on a mushroom base. Truly odd. \n\nPho: 3/5, would be 4/5 if it were a normal-sized portion. \n\nBun: the spring roll is always the first impression, and unfortunately it did set the tone - fine but bland. Quality of meat was again a high point, but the whole dish just lacked anything to distinguish itself. \n\nBun: 3/5\n\nThe consensus on this place is so positive that I may try it again while eating in, but my first experience was so underwhelming that it will probably be a whole before I give them a second chance.", "author": "r g."}
