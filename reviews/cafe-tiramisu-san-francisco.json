When my business friend chose this old time place in the Financial District, I grinned and remembered I'd never tried this place.  Belden Alley especially in the evening reminds us of being in Europe where there are sidewalk tables and seating while no vehicles drive by.  There are a number restaurants in this alley, from Peruvian, French, and Spanish to Italian, the cuisine here.  \n\nComing in around noon, we were offered an outside table but, since there would be business discussed, opted for an inside table on the left.  My friend didn't recognize the host as he is a frequent diner and knew one of the partners pretty well.  Turned out is was his day off.  After studying the menu, nothing really piqued my curiosity but he did mention a special that day, I believe.  I tried the grilled prawns with penne pasta (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=X0kQ_hCZghA1_Hzs_27EjA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  It was nicely done, not overly sauced and everything was cooked to the perfect temperature from pasta, prawns, and sauce.  The sprinkled Parmesan gave it a little richness and a change in texture for each bite.  While waiting for our food, we worked through our bread basket pretty quickly prompting me to ask for a refill.  I used a slice to wipe my plate clean of the sauce... who needs a dishwasher, kidding.\n\nOur host actually took our order while another younger gentleman served our food, bussed our table, and refilled our drink glasses.  The dining room was about a half full, likely with other diners who worked in the area.  It was a relaxed lunch and the noise level was good as we were able to iron out details about our meeting.  With all of the Italian restaurant options in North Beach, this will likely be my spot if meeting someone working in the Financial District or downtown area.", "author": "Mike C."}

Came back this evening for dinner date with hubby... Same decor, nicely upkept, very Italiano vibe. Although I did miss the Italian servers from before. The owner back in the days was quite the management... Managing every staff from the front point of ristorante to the kitchen and back. But today he is still very hands on managing as the evening host. Taking customers to their table and handing them checks. \n\nHubby ordered lamb... He was very pleased. The taste is still the same like when we first dined. Meat was made to perfection... Not over cooked, beautiful pink inside with no signs of red juice spilling out, the lamb had a nice crunchy texture and nut burnt. Topped with mashed potatoes and bed of fresh sauteed spinach. \n\nI had their petrole fish. Made well... Sitting on top of risotto with green peas and hints of jalapeno slices. Very light and delicioso. \n\nWe also shared the mussels. And the tomato red sauce broth is still the same. \n\nReally 3.5 stars. \nService is decent\nFood is excellent\nAmazed to see owner and still rocking it. Business can be challenging.

As soon as you enter the street you have to make a difficult choice, Italian, French, Spanish?  What does my taste buds fancy today?  We got there right before the rush around 11:50.  The best time to go there is between 11:30-12 before the rush.  When our weather is 70's, it is ideal to sit outside.  The Lane can be drafty so bring a light jacket.  Needless to say the parking around here is impossible so Uber or Lyft.  The ambience is very much like Europe.  Casual dining.  Right outside each restaurant is the menu so you check menus out before you decide.\n\nWe were a party of three and opted for Italian.  Although not the best in town, it is solid with a great menu selection.  Ask them for the specials before you sit.  Usually there is and appetizer, a fish, a pasta special.  We were all on light carb day so we ordered the octopus salad, cioppino, salmon and of course my Mediterranean branzino.  The octopus salad was definitely a flop.  Presented beautifully but way to over powered with capers so salty and the texture was not there.  The cioppino was a little too rich for my taste.  Salmon is slightly smaller than I thought but good.  So why did I give them 4?  Two reasons: the branzino was prepped just like I like it, simple and whole.  I never let others debone my fish because that is how I know if the chef appreciates the fish.  The meat barely fell off the bone.  Perfect.  The best part of the fish is the belly and the head.  As I am deboning I was salivating.  I can already taste the fried garlic and sage and the eyes...yes I and one of those.  Second reason?  Manager was wonderful.  We did not order a dessert but needless to say, Tiramisu must have tiramisu right?  Indeed.  He gave us a piece on the house and wow!  It was light, and beautifully done slightly different from the traditional recipe.  It was done with Kahlua rather than rum.  Over a million pieces served in 30 years!  The cream was light and tasty.  Rounded my lunch with an awesome cappuccino.  I was a happy camper for a Monday lunch.\n\nDefinitely a visit especially if you crave fish head and eyes..with tiramisu.  until next time bon appetit and ciao.", "author": "Dee Dee L."}

Be sure to listen carefully to the specials of he day because they are usually very good, as is the rest of the menu. On my most recent visit, I had the fish special which was excellent, cooked to perfection with thin crispy skin, over a bed of vegetables tinged with just the right amount of capers and a little thin sauce. The price for the fish and most dishes are within reasonable ($22 for the fish dish I had) and not the most expensive but also not the cheapest. The location is in a European style alley with indoor and outdoor seating. Very charming. We had nice weather but when it's cold or rainy, then seating can be challenging. I just wished the city would re-pave the street because of the roughness of the well-worn asphalt. Service is very good. Because prices can add up, we didn't drink anything other than water and we did not have dessert or coffee on this recent trip. But I have had the tiramisu many times and it is delicious and you must try it at least once when eating here.", "author": "Lucy L."}

Unfortunately, the bread was burnt and that was all I could taste. \n\nThe menu had lots of options from appetizers, salads and more filling entrees. I opted for a small salad with Chicken, but I was told they had run out? The goat cheese on the salad was very delicious and complimented the balsamic vinaigrette very well.\n\nWe received complimentary bread right before our meals arrived. This was odd being as though the guests sitting beside us got seated after and were served with both before us.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere is very nice. The staff is very polite.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-25", "description": "We recently bought an apartment in Scalea, Italy and one of the benefits has been the recommendations we've got for restaurants owned by Scalea expats in the SF Bay Area. Cafe Tiramisu was recommended to us by two separate friends there, both in the restaurant business. Sounded good to us, so we recently had dinner there with some friends. We're so glad we did. First off, we had never been to Belden Place, what a cute little alley lined with restaurants, very European. Cafe Tiramisu is a  beautiful, comfy, inviting, place.\n The other half of our party had smooth sailing into the city and arrived half hour early for our six o'clock reservation, as the weather was bad they headed straight to the restaurant.  They texted us that they were seated quickly and were already having drinks. When we arrived, we joined them and we also had our drink orders taken immediately, nice way to start an evening.\n  The menu covered a lot of territory and it was hard to make a descision, and we weren't rushed. I'd say service was very attentive without any feeling of being rushed. To start  our friends ordered salads and we ordered a cauliflower puree soup. The salads were beautiful. One a caesar and the other mixed greens, our friends said they were perfect.  I almost wished I had ordered a salad, that is until I tasted my soup. It was to die for, very complex but smooth flavors, I could have had seconds, maybe thirds. \nFor main courses we ordered, linguine with clams, papardelle with meat sauce, salmon on a bed of saffron orange sauce topped with a crab hash and whole Branzino fish. We all agreed that our dishes were excellent. I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu.\nWe also had desserts, the tiramisu and cannoli. We're Tiramisu fans that and this was excellent. I've never been a bit fan of Cannoli, but that's just changed. These were heaven, light crispy containers holding a most wonderful filling, again very   complex but subtle flavors.\nPresentation on all the dishes was beautiful. The kitchen here really knows their stuff. Its flavors you expect with hints of something special.\nWait service was on point, as I said attentive but not pushy in any way. Prices were reasonable, especially for the quality of food.\nWe'll be coming back.", "author": "Vince S."}

First of all, the food is out of this world. The lamb and sole are my personal favorites, however there really isn't a bad dish on the menu. The Jalape\u00f1o crab risotto is 10/10 and easily my favorite item to accompany any dish.  My girlfriend loves the spinach and cheese ravioli and that's all she gets! Also, all of their pasta is made in house and is extremely fresh. On second thought, everything has always been extremely fresh. This is due to the fact that the menu is designed around what foods are the freshest at certain times of year. Don't expect the menu to be the same all year long because the owner likes to rotate it as the seasons change. \n\nThe ambiance at Cafe Tiramisu is amazing. Whenever I walk in through the front door it feels like a trip to Italy. It can be a perfect social setting or a more romantic setting depending on which you are going for. The service is great. I could spend hours admiring this restaurant and how beautifully decorated it is. I never want my visit here to end. \n\nThe dessert is amazing especially the Tiramisu!\n\nIf you're debating on restaurants to visit in the city give this place a shot as you will not be disappointed!", "author": "Anthony F."}

The indoor seating is pretty nice and the decor is very Roman, but I think I prefer outdoor seating just because the ambiance is better. \n\nThey change up their menus quite often I think, because I didn't see the same entree I got last year on it this year, nor did I see some of the entrees that other Yelp reviewers are talking about. Last year I got veal scallopini with risotto, which they have changed to pork scallopini. I really liked this dish! The risotto is amazing. I also tried the steak carpaccio last year, which was also delicious. \n\nThis year I split a cheese board with a friend; I'm not very informed on cheese nor do I eat it very often so I can't really give an opinion here. For entree I got linguine with clams, which was really good! Lots of clams and the white wine sauce was very flavorful.

One of the best I've ever had. Caprese salad was good.  You can tell the cheese was fresh mozzarella.  The pear arugula salad was also pretty good. The pear was purple (infused with wine) with gorgonzola.  \n\nI ordered the shellfish linguine and when I got my dish, naturally I asked for cheese for the whole table and then I was kinda of embarrassed for asking for it.  Our waiter was grilling me about ruining the dish and not tasting the flavor of the seafood if I add cheese.  I understand and maybe its offending to the chef but the fact that the waiter kept going on about it really killed my appetite after that.

There's plenty of outdoor seating and everything is cramped like it always is in San Francisco.  It's about 30 feet away from a dark alleyway along with the 2 homeless people who live there but it's so crowded here, so it's unlikely that you will be the unlucky person to be bothered here.\n\nI came here with my medical department during a convention, and I personally ordered the veal while everyone else ordered the chicken breast or ravioli.  Veal was soft, and slightly salted, very typical  for an Italian restaurant. We all loved our meals, BUT I would like to comment that this is NOT a filling meal.  The chicken breasts that my coworkers ordered were small, and side dishes are not included in the prices on the menu.  (See photo below of the veal.) \n\nWe also ordered the tiramisu and a slice of chocolate pie, both of which were delicious (as almost all desserts are.)\n\nTo summarize, the service is pretty slow, the portions are very small, the outdoor seating isn't special, the location sucks, and the lighting is very dim outside, but the food is prepared well. The dimness would be acceptable if the restaurant was designed to be romantic, but the tables outside are designed to seat big crowds, not couples.", "author": "Andrew H."}

I bring up the price because one of the wine bottles had gone bad. They didn't have us try the second bottle and I suppose its because they knew it had gone bad. They just automatically poured it in the decanter since I guess they thought it was the same bottle so no need to try it again. Its pretty ridiculous to charge so much for wine and not make sure its being stored correctly.\n3- I went up to the manager after waiting OVER and hour to find out why it was taking so long to at least put in our order for food.

He got salmon and I got the seafood special, halibut.\nBruschetta was OK, not special. Salad really good with beets, apples, nuts. Very fresh. My fish was spectacularly good. A light crust, perfectly cooked. Just enough seasoning to enhance but not drown flavor. It came garnished with large shrimp and tiny mussels; I got an extra tiny fork to get the mussels out of their shells. A sprinkling of peas and a fabulous sauce. On a bed of squid ink risotto. My first try of squid ink. I thought it might taste strong but it's actually quite mild, what I'd call an ocean flavor. Probably more drama than anything. \nAlso liked the bread with dipping/drizzling sauce - chimichurri? \nIn the midst of our meal, a group of women sat at the next table, really a continuation as there was a long bench, several of them wearing VERY STRONG perfume. I am severely fragrance sensitive and knew at once I had to move as I immediately got a massive headache. If I did not get out of there I would be painfully ill, too nauseated to eat, and all food would taste like perfume anyway. We moved outside, although it was a bit cold. (People on the East Coast might disagree.) The waiter kindly carried out plates, wine glasses, bread, water, etc. We were able to finish & enjoy our meals. \nI asked the waiter (large white male) what the sauce was on the fish, he said lobster. No wonder it was so good!\nI wonder of those women were able to taste their food?\nDessert: I got cannoli and he got baba. The cannoli were excellent, they nailed the pastry.

I ordered the gorgonzola gnocchi and my dining companion ordered the ravioli. Both were pretty bland and unremarkable. The gnocchi in particular was underwhelming. Overlooked and more like mushy paste balls than the al dente gnocchi I've experienced at other establishments, it came served with a bland cream sauce topped randomly, with sliced almonds. I ended up adding some of the basil olive oil dip that was still on the table from the appetizer bread, which livened it up a tad and made it more palatable.

Sounds dreamy?  Indeed, it is!\n\nD E C O R - The decor of this place has a Roman touch to it and romantic dining arrangements!  Dine outdoors when the weather forbids!\n\nS E R V I C E - You will be assisted by a hostess upfront and be served by attentive waiters and waitresses throughout your meal courses!\n\nI T A L I A N  F O O D - I loved every dish I tried!  What I HIGHLY RECOMMEND as an opening appetizer is to customize your order by combining their MUSSELS AND CLAMS together in spicy tomato broth!  Having the scrumptious spicy tomato broth to compliment the mussels and clams, the three way combo was tantalizing to my taste buds!!  It was super delicious and when everyone finished eating the mussels and clams, I drank the remaining spicy tomato broth!

The restaurant name was tucked behind a row of umbrellas so it was a tad bit hard to find.\n\nWe were greeted by a friendly hostess who seated us outside right below the heater. A server came out and recommended that we order the pappardelle and the cioppino so we did just that...plus carpaccio! After ordering, a couple servers came out and started placing our utensils down for us. A basket of bread and a cup of olive oil was also brought out. The olive oil was enjoyable, heh.\n\nAll 3 of our dishes came out at the same time but I'll start with the carpaccio. It doesn't look like your standard carpaccio, most likely due to the black pepper. It looked like lightly seared, rare beef. It was topped with arugula, fennel, artichoke and Parmesan and dressed in a vinaigrette. It didn't really appeal to my taste. The beef wasn't as flavorful as I hoped it would be and the vinaigrette really didn't too good of a job complementing the beef. \n\nThe pappardelle was the dish I personally ordered so I was hoping it'd be rocking. The server said that the pasta was house made so I appreciated that. The dish honestly looked like flopped lasagna, which I don't really mind, but it tasted just okay. The bolognese sauce was pretty standard.\n\nThe cioppino was probably the dish that I enjoyed the most but like the pappardelle, it was just okay. My mom actually said that it was worse than something similar she had at The Fish Market. It's not that it was bad...it's just that it could have been better. \n\nThe service was above average though! The waiters were always checking up on us to see if we needed anything. They happily brought us out more bread and olive oil when we finished the first batch. \n\nQuite honestly, had the prices been lower, this place would have earned another star. However, the ratio of taste to price really just didn't work out. It's on the expensive side for what you're getting.

I must be getting old.\n\nAnyway, this was a picture perfect night.  Why??  Well, it might have to do with my childhood of being around a bunch of people during the holidays and being outside in inclement weather.  This night, we were with our kids, one of my kid's friends and our two friends from Oregon.  We were going to just stay home and have homemade spaghetti sauce and some garlic bread - I am sure glad we decided to come into the city!!!\n\nWe parked at Union Square garage, went by Macy's and saw the kitties and pups, saw the tree in the square and then went to Chinatown for some bargain xmas shopping - my kids idea.  All the while, the rain was coming down in buckets.  After a few stops in Chinatown, we decided to get a snack, but, decided otherwise since everyone wanted more than a bite.  I remembered Cafe Tiramisu from another celebration, so, off we went from Chinatown.\n\nThe place is located in Belden alley, which in my mind, is a perfect little getaway.  The scene couldn't have been more perfect.... walking down Bush street, jumping over huge puddles, me yelling out to the crowd through the rain buckets \"take a left, it's down that alley.  The bright neon sign above the door showed us the way to our perfect destination.\n\nEvery dish that was ordered was consumed in record time, not because we were overly ravenous, rather, because with each bite you wanted more!!\n\nI had the Caesar and the short ribs.  The Caesar was good, nothing extraordinary.  The short rib didn't look like much, just a long piece of meat on a bed of horseradish mashed potatoes with a red/brown sauce.  But the taste.....it was veryyyyy good, succulent meat - didn't even need to chew it, it was that tender.  The sauce was also perfect.  I also had a Manhattan and a glass of Cab - both accompanied my meal perfectly.\n\nWe all ordered dessert, because, well.... our other choice was to leave and go into a major downpour.  So, we stayed, had cappuccinos and some sweets.  The profiteroles were amazing, the tiramisu was off the charts, I had the sugar and cinnamon coated doughnuts filled with italian custard.   OH  MY EFFIN GOD - THESE WERE AMAZING!!!  Maybe one of the top 5 desserts I ever had - that good.\n\nWe were the last in the restaurant, the manager gave us some comp'd lemoncello's. We got to talking to him and the next thing you know, it's 10:15!!!  (we got there at 7:30!!!).  So we bid Tiramisu a fond farewell and went out into the night.\n\nBut.... our night wasn't done yet!!!  We walked over to the B of A building (in light rain) to see that tree - it is much nicer than the Union Square tree, imo.  After a photo shoot around the tree, I came up with the idea to walk down to the Hyatt Regency to see their Christmas display.  It was nice, it was warm, it was dry.  After a few trips up and down the elevators (and finding the on/off switch for the lobby xmas tree on the 14th floor and messing with that, hehe) we settled into the Hyatt bar for a drink.\n\nAll in all, just a perfect evening with wonderful companions on a picture-perfect night (for me).  This night, not only thanks to Tiramisu, will go down in the annals as one of my fav holiday season visits to the city.  It was just that good.  Sometimes a perfect storm can be quite positive, and in this case, truer words could not be uttered. \n\nYa feel me??", "author": "Johnny L."}

They have heat lamps but they're not all around. \n\nOn the DAT menu, which has a very nice selection, I ordered the appetizer: Hand Made Orecchiette with duck ragu & fresh ricotta, Black Pepper Beef Carpaccio with arugula, shaved fennel, raw artichoke & shaved parmesan, entree: Dungeness Crab Angolotti with mascarpone vodka sauce, dessert: Piccolo Tiramisu Lady finger cookies, mascarpone, espresso. My boyfriend ordered soup: Cauliflower with Dungeness Crab, Black Pepper Beef Carpaccio with arugula, shaved fennel, raw artichoke & shaved parmesan, appetizer: Grilled Butcher Steak over creamy portabella mushrooms, red wine & parmesan shoestring fries.\n\nMy favorite had to be the Dungeness Crab angolotti! I could've ordered another 2 orders! It is basically a dungeness crab ravioli with more dungeness crab on time. I will go back just for that!\nEverything else was very delicious! No complaints!\n\nThe service was very good as well. Our server was very patient, since we were still waiting for my boyfriend to arrive. He was 30mins late. We were able to sit down at our table without having to wait for the entire party to arrive like other restaurants, which is a good thing since it was cold outside!

It used to be a good place for Italian downtown, but the owner and his once celebrated staff are now tired and cranky. \n\nLast night I was in the area and since I hadn't been to Cafe Tiramisu in several years and was craving Italian, I decided to stop in with my wife to see if they had a table. Yes, it's the busy holiday season and no, we didn't have a reservation, but we thought we would give it a try anyway. Immediately upon walking in, a waiter (heavy-set guy who has been there for years) walked our way and asked if we had a reservation. When we said \"no,\" he responded, \"We're full, try the place on the corner, they have similar food, unless you want to wait 20 minutes.\" No greeting, no niceties, no smile, just a shrug off and then he walked away. No exaggeration. We stood there for a spilt-second and then the owner walked up and the exact same interaction followed. Wow! We again looked at each other and I said, \"I don't feel good about this place anymore.\" The owner overheard me and then said, \"Well, you should've stayed home.\" Wow! The place wasn't packed and we would've gladly waited 20 minutes if we were at least treated cordially. Sad. As a small business owner myself, it's sad to see a fellow small business owner and his staff treat prospective customers with such disregard. We all have bad nights, but somehow, I got the sense that this sort of thing happens often at Cafe Tiramisu. Sad. Very sad.", "author": "Rocky B."}

We were both in the mood for pasta, so after walking up and down the street, we chose Cafe Tiramisu. \n\nI am happy with our decision and would go again and also recommend this place to my friends. Although I work in North Beach where italian is king, this place held its own. \n\nWe ordered the calamari, spaghetti with crab, and mushroom risotto, all to share. When the calimari came out it did not look like your usual fried calamari, we were super confused. But then we ate it. Wow! This was the best calamari I have ever had. It felt lighter since it was not fried but was bursting with flavor. The plate included potatoes and thinly sliced cucumbers and a vinaigrette drizzle, my mouth is literally watering thinking about it. Please do yourself a favor and order this. \n\nThe spaghetti with crab with good, not great. The spaghetti was nice and light, not overly sauced at all. But didn't have the kick of flavor I wanted. The crab was also good. I think if these are the flavors you are in the mood for, it is a tasty dish. Note on the service here -  our waiter was awesome. Very friendly and attentive but not overbearing. We asked him to please break the crab for us (don't judge me) and he graciously did so with a laugh. \n\nThe mushroom risotto with ahi tuna was heaven on a plate. We both said \"mmm\" on first bite. I never choose risotto over pasta, but I am so glad we did here. For all your mushroom lovers, this will hit the spot. The ahi tuna was also wonderful and went really well with the rest of the ingredients. \n\nAll and all, I am looking forward to trying this place again. I did not check out the inside or the bar. The outside isn't the prettiest/fanciest but it was nice nonetheless. The whole vibe of Belden Place made it a really cute dinner spot.", "author": "Zahra K."}

At $14, I would have expected a better quality wine.

Rob says cryptically \"Tiramisu!\" to which Tom doesn't know whether he should be eating it or performing it with an extra-large vibrator and a dozen hard-boiled eggs. That's how I kinda feel when I'm in this always-crowded place. Given that I forgot my vibrator and eggs (...of all days!), that left me with just one other option - eating.\n\nOf all the Belden Place places, this is probably the best food-wise. That's not really that high a watermark as I'm kind of meh on all the other places, maybe because I feel they should do more crowd control in that alley during the lunch hour. But Italian is hard to screw up unless you're Buca di Beppo or the Olive Garden. Cafe Tiramisu is better than that and actually delights me on occasion.\n\nI had a soup-salad combo while dining with a colleague there, and it turned out to be a smart digestive move. I had the $7 bowl of Heirloom Tomato Soup, creamy with a drizzle of basil-infused olive olive and a couple of croutons. As a complement, I went for the $13 Roasted Yellow Peach and Arugula Salad with Prosciutto and Aged Ricotta. It was a nice blend of peppery and sweet and a good combo of textures. That turned out to be satisfying enough.\n\nDining inside did make a difference, and the service just seemed more punctual since most of the noise was coming from the outside. I didn't have any room for what I assume to be their signature dessert - tiramisu - but I did find my vibrator later. What happened after that is not particularly relevant to this review.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...well-prepared soup and salad does the trick for me\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...not particularly exciting decor-wise, but you may want to sacrifice the sun at lunch to secure a greater peace on the inside\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...serviceable with an Italian accent\nTOTAL - 4 stars...I'll let this Belden Place eatery have four stars and let the others aspire to it", "author": "Ed U."}

It was creamy, full of flavour and very comforting. \n\nFor mains, I ordered the Penne Puttanesca ($17ish) and my sis had the Gnocci ($17ish). Both were good, but the Gnocci won that round.

My girlfriend and I then finished by sharing the chocolate mousse cake, pistachio ice cream and raspberry sauce, which was also outstanding.\n\nReally, my only (mild) complaint is that the restaurant can get kind of loud, and I expect that with full crowd it would be difficult to carry on conversation in a group.

My fiance and I had flown into town for a fun night in SF and felt like Italian food so we decided to check out Cafe Tiramisu because it was walking distance from our hotel in Union Square. \n\nMy fiance is 100% Italian so we were excited when we walked in, speaking some Italian and being friendly with the staff. Our experience from there on was rather disappointing. I don't recommend this place unless you're actually from Italy or really speak the language, the owner/waiter was only paying attention to the 2 tables who seemed to be from the \"old country.\" \n\nIt took 15 minutes just to get water, never mind asking for a cocktail and a menu. I finally got up and went to the bar tender to politely ask if there was a waiter in our area or if we could get some help. The owner/waiter came over to our table and was a complete dick. He proceeded to hound me saying \"What are you in a hurry?\" I said no, we just wanted to order a drink and some appetizers while we look at a menu...seems like a normal thing when you go to a restaurant. He proceeded to be pissy with us, not sure why we didn't just get up and leave. I think we were starving by that point and didn't want to have to hunt down another restaurant. I finally got a cocktail 25 minutes later and some appetizers but you could tell the guy was completely offended by me getting up and asking for some service. \n\nNow my father in law is from \"the old country\" in Italy and is a very kind man. I know how they can be sometimes but the owner/waiter went out of his way to be a jerk and for that it pretty much ruined our night and dining experience. I will never go back as there are plenty of kind Italian people in SF that would be more than happy to have your business. I only give it two stars because after we finally got the food it was okay.

The oysters were fresh, of course, and the Caesar salad was decent but not the best we've had. The risotto was fantastic, lots of spices and a ton of flavor throughout. The ravioli was OK, a very good flavor but _very_ small portions.\n\nThe only issue we had was when we ordered one of the less expensive bottles of wine, and the one brought out was the same but an earlier year, thus nearly twice as expensive when the bill came.

I love it's location in the FiDi - we went on a sunny day and sat outdoors (I didn't even go inside so no idea what it's like in there).  Good mix of working professionals and lucky people who did not have to work that day.  Very European style outdoor seating with flower pots and large umbrellas.  Pleasant waiters and hosts to serve us.  Bread is served with olive paste at the start.  The bread was nothing special....save your appetite for the appetizers and entrees!\n\nFirst, we ordered the caesar salad (freshly baked croutons and tasty dressing) and bruschetta to start.  The bruschetta has anchovies which I was not fond of, so I picked them off.  Otherwise, it was very tasty.  \n\nFor entrees, we ordered the salmon, black ink linguini with ahi, and mushroom risotto.  The salmon was well seasoned and over grilled asparagus.  It was a basic dish, but well prepared.  The black ink linguini was very creative and something I had never had before.  The ahi is supposed to be seared, but I have never been a fan of seared fish, so I requested that it be well done.  They had no problem customizing the dish for me.  There is not a lot of flavor in the pasta itself other than a lot of olive oil with some tomato....a little plain but still delicious.  As for the mushroom risotto, I was really impressed with the mushroom flavoring - a lot of places make the mushroom flavor too strong and I get tired of it after a few bites.  However, this was really delicious and I almost wished I had ordered it instead of the linguini.  \n\nAs for the portions, the dishes look small but they are very filling.

The lasting impression I got from this place is all style and no substance. \n\nWe, like so many other people, were sucked into eating here by the pretty lights and European-ish feel to the street it's located on. But of course, because the restaurant can reel in people due to its location, it can under-deliver on taste, service and quality. \n\nI think people are maybe coloured by their \"European\" type of experience they have. Perhaps the feeling and ambiance makes people more forgiving of the food they are served? Or perhaps I just made a bad choice. \n\nI ordered the boar dish - it was a pasta dish so I was expecting something interesting. The first plate that arrived had likely been sitting for a while because it was luke warm. I asked the waiter to send it back, and the second plate that arrived was admittedly warmer but the portion sizes were not reflective of the price I paid. \n\nThe food itself was pretty salty as well as not being hot enough - I'd expect a stronger flavour due to the boar, but it was a bit too much for me. Probably partly my fault for ordering that meat, but I stand by my moan and say it was too salty! My other half said his meal was very bland. Ho hum. \n\nI was hungry after I'd finished the food - it took me all of three minutes to scarf it. There just wasn't enough there to merit a dinner-sized portion of food, ESPECIALLY in the States!!

On the positive side, it is a lot less touristy. \n\nThe wine list is extensive, but their selections for the per glass and half bottles are a little dated. The asparagus and crab Risotto with delicious, but the seared Ahi tuna was overcooked. A very common but novice mistake. The doughnuts filled with Italian custard dessert was pretty sweet, although the sauce was a nice dark chocolate.

I'd driven up Kearny countless numbers of times and never knew that this Belden Place existed just a stones throw away. The area is teeming with diners and although not all Italian restaurants, it bustles with a similar NYC Little Italy energy.\n\nThere's a good amount of outside seating but since the night was a bit chilly we decided to eat inside. The restaurant is very narrow, closet like, and there's additional dining in a cozy downstairs area where we were seated. Murals and paintings adorn the walls which themselves already have quite of a bit of relief texture. Our waiter introduced himself and then left us to peruse the menus.\n\nWe chose to start with two glasses of the Dolcetto and with one of us being keen on dessert, we proceeded to straight to the entrees. It was destined to be a pasta night, so a plate of the ricotta gnocchi and the tagliatelle with wild boar meatballs were chosen. The gnocchi were little mini ones, cooked with a really nice texture (not gummy) and picked up the tomato sauce nicely. The wild boar meatballs and sauce were excellent and I don't think I'd enjoyed a pasta dish this much in a while.  I could probably eat that once a week and never get sick of it. After we polished off our entrees we tackled the dessert sampler which consisted of just about everything; tiramisu, creme brulee,  banana tart, canoli, chocolate cake, profiteroles, and a fruit sorbet. \n\nThe seating of our reservation was prompt and our waiter was very keen. The food also came out surprisingly fast considering it was a Saturday night.  I think some people would be afraid the area is too touristy but I think it's worth giving a try because you can get a fine meal  and it's fairly inexpensive. 4.5 stars for this tucked away gem.", "author": "Kim N."}

They didn't have any outside seating available, so we sat inside. It was very noisy and people were packed in. Not the kind of experience you want at their price point and type of food. We were given menus and then ignored for ten minutes. A group of six were seated next to us and we had to move seats around to let them in, because things were so tight. Certainly not a good place for an intimate or romantic or for that matter any kind of sit down meal. After about five more minutes, the other group was waited on first.

Since the weather was actually sunny and above 60 degrees, we sat outside in the alley.  Between us, we had three glasses of wine.  Each glass cost $11-12, which I thought was overpriced, as I found nothing special about the wine.  But then again, I'm no wine expert, so who knows.\n\nI ordered the Rack of Lamb, which turned out to be delicious.  Even though the meat was cooked to medium well, it was tender.  The rack was flavorful and fragrant in exactly the way a good lamb rack should be.  It was so good that I didn't pay much attention to the sides.  (According to the menu, there were supposed to be garlic chips, herbs, and black truffle; there may have been, but I have no recollection.)  That said, I liked that the mashed potato accompanying the rack seemed lighter than most of the mashed potatoes I've had.\n\nMy friend ordered the pork chops (I don't see it on their menu; it could possibly have been the Pork Medallion), which tasted great as well.  He finished his lunch with a cup of coffee.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed the food, I was surprised by the $102 bill.  Everything did add up, but I hadn't expected to spend close to $50 on lunch where I had one entree with a glass of wine.\n\nIn conclusion: great place to eat, but don't expect to save money.", "author": "Niya Y."}

They're all the same... so beautiful, on this incredibly picturesque little alley of restaurants in the middle of the Financial District.\n\nThing is that Cafe Tiramisu and the others on this row rely on their location and charm to substitute for quality of food, while still charging a premium price.  Without exception, dishes here have been just average, if not actually unappealing.  My fish for instance was pretty overcooked.  But what can you do, it's Belden Place.\n\nIf you want a business lunch in a place that looks beautiful, and quality is not a necessity, then come here.  It'll look great.

The squid ink linguini with mussels, clams and prawns exceeded expectations, with the mussels and clams cooked but not dried out - I think the rapid turnover keeps everything freshen the kitchen.

We had the Pear appetizer which was outstanding - A pear marinated in a red wine sauce I believe, very creative and tasty. They also served rolls with Pesto sauce, and the sauce was perfect. My girlfriend and I had the Sea Bass and Steak Medallions. The Sea Bass was ok, but the steak was great - cooked properly and served with a potato and cream of spinach. My sister was with us and she requires a Gluten free diet, so she ordered the Steak as well and asked the waiter if it did not have any wheat or flour and he confirmed. Unfortunately I don't think he fully understood as the steak was served with a sauce, which appeared to be made with flour. He offered another dish, but she was already content with eating the sides and appetizers. It is tough being gluten free and trying to eat out, especially on NYE. We also had desserts, the chocolate/caramel torte which was ok. Shockingly, nobody in our party ordered the Tiramisu, the restaurants name, so we have no idea if it is the best in the city...perhaps it is something to go back and try. 4 of 5 stars, mainly based on the lack of gluten experience, but again, that is a tough one to support, especially on NYE.", "author": "John P."}

Wld have assumed tourist trap worst but for the fact that it was chosen by my SF foodie friends.  It was really fun--my friends know the owner Giuseppe, who is wonderful and treated us right.  The bruschetta with eggplant paste, roasted red pepper and white anchovy was wonderful-- it helped that Giuseppe told us how he loved anchovies since he was a boy in Italy, steadying the boat as the fishermen dragged in the bulging nets.  Pastas were all fine--go with the ones involving things like veal cheek, boar Ragu, but all seemed really flavorful.  We had a nice primitivo which was appropriate to the food.\n\nLesson learned: food on belden lane can be excellent--tiramisu will get a return visit from me!", "author": "Leslie C."}

We ordered the zucchini blossom tempura, scallops and risotto for appetizers. My fianc\u00e9e liked his scallops but I was disappointed in the zucchini. It was a small size and it was lukewarm. And mind you, there were only 2 other patrons at the time, so I expected the food to be piping hot since none of the staff had much to do but cook, greet, and serve. The staff was very prompt, however. Anyway. So for entrees, we ordered the ravioli beef short ribs and the grilled hawaiian swordfish. Very, very underwhelming. The swordfish tasted like it was frozen then microwaved for too long. Very bland and dry. No flavor whatsoever. The ravioli was just ok but my fianc\u00e9e's grandma makes it ten times better. Also the portions were both so small compared to the prices they were set at. Finally, we order a tiramisu. This was the best thing we ate. I mean, it wasn't the best tiramisu I've had but it was the best part of the meal. So all in all, we spent $100 for the whole meal, including tip and, unfortunately, I have to say that it was not worth the money, time, or appetite.

Yes, truffles! You know when the waiter goes around shaving truffles on everything you're in the right place. I ordered the mussels for a main course, since the weather was soo cold outside, and dipped my bread in the soupy fennel broth. I got a tiny bite of Nish's veal and it was cooked perfectly, Roma style.\n\nOh, and the desserts! This place isn't joking about their tiramisu. It was the perfect texture with just the right amount of cream and rum-soaked cake. But of course, the molten chocolate cake with hazelnut stole the show. It all paired wonderfully with a bottle of wine from the Barbera region in Italy.\n\nOur waiter was really quick, but not very warm, and not helpful at all when we asked for recommendations. I think his attitude was \"everything here is good\" which is true, but c'mon! I wish he could have pretended to have been inspired about at least one dish.", "author": "Nicole G."}

Why!!!!!\nI know KQED has a lot of foodies, and it's quality t.v. so while in the City I was dying to try this place.  We were greeted by the hostess, the owner was as my bf. said \"kind of an ass', didn't get the friendly vibe like on the show.  We were sat at the very back, people have said \" They felt as if they were transported to Italy!\" Yea it smelled like the Venice canals.  I get it, its an old building but the smell was off putting and gets worse when you go down stairs to use the bathroom or being punished and actually have to sit at the tables down there...  The owner took our order, didn't go over any specials maybe there weren't any?  The menu wasn't that exciting, I wanted to try the homemade pasta and at the recommendation of the owner I ordered the Paperadelle with meat sauce and the bf had Veal Scallopine.  Truthfully nothing sounded all that great.  I ordered a deeelish Prosecco, the waiter brought out with bread, never caught his name.  The bread is made in house, again nothing exciting rolls that should have been served warm I thought and the dipping oil people raved about on this site was forgettable.   I ate a lot of bread since I knew the entree was gonna tank, it did... My dish was paperdalle noodles that were super thin, maybe that's how they are in Italy but I like my pasta with a bit of substance.  The sauce was kinda tasteless except for an overbearing wine taste.  Meeehhh on my food. The bf loooovvveeed his Veal Scaloppine, I don't eat veal but I tried the Parmesan Risotto and again I have had better.  So I thought I will try the Tiramisu, terrible.  Again made in house but over espresso-ed and the bitter chocolate powder was just that a bitter addition, the dish wasn't overly sweet that the powder needed to be added.  It was super crowded, why who knows.  I'm no food expert but this experience for me was bad.  And to offend all the foodies out there, Maggianos which is a chain has better food and the atmosphere doesn't need to transport me anywhere except to sheer ecstasy.  Their Tiramisu is wonderful, and you get as much as you want!  Some Yelper posted on her review that an appetizer, 6 beers and 3 or 4 entrees was $ 150.00, for 1 salad 2 entrees 1 prosecco and a coke was close to $ 80.00 and for a 20% tip we left $ 100.00 lighter.

A must have if you are a meat eater.  I had the cioppino, which was good, though the prawns were a little rubbery.  The pasta (large tubes, called paccieri) with a spicy tomato based sauce and seafood was good, and the \"spiciness' was mild.  \n\nWe ordered the dessert sampler (\"for 2\", even though we were 6, we were pretty full), and this was a fun way to have some dessert.  It does turn into a free-for-all. I probably liked the creme brulee the best.\n\nThe wine menu selection was pretty good, more Italian than California, but not overwhelming in volume.

I was disappointed to find on my last visit that they removed it from the menu because someone complained that they found a bone in the fish.  I've had that fish many times and never had any issues.  The chef debones it perfectly but this is a fish that is cooked whole and so to miss a single one is not unreasonable.

If  Uncle Ben could make risotto, he evidently set up shop at Cafe Tiramisu.   The risotto was NOT creamy and rich, but tasted super chewy and grainy, like a converted rice would taste.  And the spicy sauce combination in my tuna risotto was just plain weird.  I can't say anything much better about the squid ink risotto.\n\nBy the way, the men's room at this restaurant was not working, so you had go down 2 store fronts to their \"sister\" restauant Taverna next door.

It almost has that 1950s men's club feel (in a good way... you know, the way Taddich Grill does). It's wonderful little corner of the world on a long workday.\n\nThe seating is European, meaning the tables are long and you just sit where you can in the mix...which is actually pretty cool unless the guy to your left starts slurping his pasta or the guy to your right starts yelling at his buddy, both of which happened while we were there (my only complaint) .  I can't (and won't) fault a restaurant because the guys next to me never learned a thing from their mamas, but  seriously? My God. I would have been served my ass for breakfast if my grandma had seen me do either of those things.  \n\nAnyway, the food was gorgeous and delicious... fresh fish, perfectly prepared pasta, flawless service and satisfying desserts.

But, um, WHAT?!?!  strange, right?\n\nAnyhow, one of us had ordered a glass of wine that just never showed, and the waiter came rushing over asking, \"Did you never get your wine???\" when we were already done dinner, at which point we said, \"no, we didn't, but nevermind\".

One of my rules of dining is that most restaurants can't do most things all that well.

I thought it was really good. I ordered the orichette with white beans and mussels. The mussels were huge and very tasty, and the pasta was very good, but could have used a little more tangy taste; maybe some lemon juice or parsley would have added to it. The tiramisu is awesome! It had just the right amount of cake to cream/liquor ratio. Maybe I'm crazy, but I thought it was some of the best tiramisu I've ever had! They served it with generous pieces of dark chocolate around the edges, too. Yum!\nWe sat inside. If I return, I'll definitely want to sit outside...Belden Place is cool.", "author": "Jenny R."}

I do love how the restaurants have chairs and tables spilling out into the alleyway. The ambiance and charm of Belden Place is inescapable.\n\nCafe Tiramisu fits perfectly into Belden Place. My group of 8 was squeezed inside, near the tiny kitchen. (Honestly, we marveled at how they must be very efficient with their serving/cooking skills with such a small space. \n\nFor the amount of food we got, I felt like it was a bit overpriced. My ravioli contained about five (semi) large pieces of pasta in a (semi) spiced creme sauce. The bread appetizer left me more fulfilled.\n\nFor dessert, we each ordered our own creme brulee, based on the sizes of our entrees. Mistake. The desserts were bigger than the meals! We easily could have shared the dessert between two people. \n\nSo, while the ambiance and the idea of Belden Place seems attractive, Cafe Tiramisu did not deliver.

It's just too filling for me. However, I must say that while this place has a small menu, the appetizers and courses were very tasty and the portions were not too big and not too small. \n\nStarters -- We had the following for the table: Blackened \"Kobe Style\" Carpaccio. Sauteed Dungeness Crab Cakes. Ahi Burschetta on Risotto Cake. I would pass On the Ahi, but the other two were very good. \n\nIn terms of entrees. I am a big fan of minimal pasta dishes. So, I had the Cioppino (which I buy at Trader Joes all the time; it's wonderful). The waiter said the seafood is brought in fresh everyday at this place. Well, it was absolutely delicious, fresh and cooked to perfection. I couldn't finish it (generous portion). I recommend it for those trying to ease up on the carbs and those who love seafood and tomatoes. \n\nOthers at the table had the Ravioli w/Roasted Eggplant. They liked it very much. And someone had the Gnocchi with meat sauce. She said it was good, but again very generous serving--good for two. \n\nDesert --We tried Yogurt Panna Cotta. Wonderufl! I recommend this. Light and rich at the same time with fresh fruit. A great finish. The table also ordered the Warm Chocolate Cake w/Hazelnut ice cream -- pass. \n\nLastly, wine.. we had a Pinot Grigio and Pinot Noir.

I had been drooling over the menu at Cafe Tiramisu for months because I just happened to notice them on OpenTable and it looks sooooooo good. So I made a reservation for this special night and found a hotel close by (The Executive Hotel Vintage Court http://www.yelp.com/biz/executive-hotel-vintage-court-san-francisco#hrid:iiS_EE6i0H3H18UQNFJnHQ) and booked a room at the last minute. \nSo we walk from the hotel, which is just about a 3 block walk downhill. \nWhen we get to the restaurant we come up to the patio entrance where there is a hostess standing outside of this giant plastic cover thing that encloses the entire patio area. The hostess tells us she has a seat for us outside. She unzips the plastic thing and brings us into the patio area (which seems nicely heated) and walks us to a table that is right up against the plastic. \nOk fine. Then she seats someone next to us, and since the tables are packed in soooo tight this basically means she might as well say \"this couple will be joining you for dinner this evening.\" \nOk fine. So after a few minutes the waiter comes over. He has such a thick Italian accent I can barely understand him. We order two glasses of wine (two of the SAME wine- seriously, we were making it easy for him) and an appetizer (I cant exactly remember what). Ok for the record, I HATE when the waiter or waitress doesn't write anything down. I seriously hate it. It stresses me out. I get anxiety thinking they are going to mess this up but sometimes they surprise me and its all ok. This guy? Yeah who knows. He was gone for about 20 minutes, then came back and took the order of the people next to us. No wine for us, no appetizer. \nOk, fine. A few more minutes go by. He comes over with the wine for the people next to us and then steps over to our table and looks at us blankly. \n\"Uh...\" he says. Yep nothing. Nothing going on up there in that head. I remind him that we ordered wine and an appetizer. He asks me which wine and which appetizer, so I tell him. \nHe runs back to the kitchen. 20 minutes later our wine arrives. He tells us there is something wrong with the computer and runs off again. \nI'm slightly irritated at this point, but its the plastic cover thingy that's more annoying that the waiter, because I am freezing my butt off next to this thing. I'm wearing the most adorable dress with a sweater over and ex bfs jacket over my legs to keep from hypothermia. I'm little ok? No meat on these bones! lol \nAlright so the appetizer never came. We finally flag the man down and order our dinners, because at this point we are starvatious. He takes the order and leaves without time for us to ask about our appetizer, but we are so over it at this point. The people next to us are eating their entrees. A few minutes later, here comes Mr. Ding Dong Waiter again. \n\"Uh... uh... you uh order uh...\" he says. \nI remind him AGAIN of what we ordered. We are trying to make conversation, and trying not to think about our grumbly stomachs, when 10 minutes later the waiter comes back. \n\"So sorry, your order?\" CONFUSION look on his face. \nThis is when the guy sitting at the table next to us says \"He ordered the gnocchi and she ordered the risotto!\" lol \nWaiter looks in shock. \n\"Oh sorry sorry something wrong with computer...\" as he runs away again. \nWe finally get our food when the people next to us are finishing their desserts. In my opinion, the food was EXCELLENT, but the service was insanely bad. Took us another 30 minutes after we were finished and our plates had been taken for us to get the check, and we were never offered coffee or dessert.

After all, what waiter enjoys serving such a monstrous group? And really, what business did our huge group have invading the quaint, European charm of Belden Place?\n\n\n I doubted, but Cafe Tiramisu delivered.\n\n\n The waitstaff somehow made it so our group didn't feel so damn large, providing prompt and attentive service. Despite the growing boisterousness among some guests, they never slowed down in bringing out the wine, grappa, and port to keep the party going. And the main attraction, the food, was excellent. Between the osso bucco primavera, the gigantic steaks, seared tuna, and brick-baked chicken, everything was top notch and well presented - and surprisingly served in great synchronization, which is no small feat for such a huge group.\n\n\n Based on their outstanding service alone, I give top marks to the place. The brick-baked chicken puts it over the top.\n\n\n Oddly enough, tiramisu is one of the few desserts I've never cared for, but the 30 others told me it was excellent.", "author": "Omid T."}

Both appetizers had white truffle shavings, which can never hurt a meal (I know, truffles are so 2000, but I still love the mushroomy yumminess). \n\nThe service, on the other hand, was weird (as evidenced by my 3.75 stars, rounded up to 4). For example, my water glass was almost never full (I'm a huge imbiber of the H2O), but when I returned to the table from the ladies' room, the maitre'd was there ready with my napkin to position it perfectly on my now seated lap. Also, they took absolutely forever to clear our table, and were in no rush to take our orders. Strange, right?\n\nOverall, it was a good experieince.

The main course, the salmon encrusted with a crab and pesto was tasty on top of a bed of wax beans and a very delicate flavored sauce from squash blossoms. The salmon was cooked quite right and was a perfect serving. \nDessert was actually a clever departure. Not off the wall, but I ordered the molten chocolate (cup) cake, the scoop of gelato and all accompanied by a warm pureed hazelnut chocolate soup. That was a very key and nice approach. \n\nThe house Pinot Noir was pleasant on the first bottle and a little less complex on the second. \n\nThe service was excellent and very warm, and the weather matched.\n\nAs far as wine goes, I think I may start bringing my own to any restaurant and pay the corkage of $12-20...

The Heirloom Tomato Salad was good and it came deconstructed. I end up ordering the Pappardelle which pretty much taste like Bonalese Spaghetti. My dining partner order the Orecchiette and that was better tasting than mine but a bit on the spicy side. Overall dinner was okay. I thought it would be better but dessert totally made up for it. We ordered Panna Cotta and well they ran out of the Vanilla one so we end up getting a White Chocolate one. Boy was it good and it literally taste like you were eating a bar of White Chocolate.

I appreciate the \"home made\" pasta, but the flavor is a bit on the bland side.  Another friend had the porkchop which came in a formidable size.  She thought it was okay.  One friend picked the linguini with clams that she saw on the online website but we didn't realize that the menu changes everyday.  However, the waiter was nice enough to accomodate us and served linguini with clams even though it wasn't on the menu.   For dessert, we shared the profiterolles with vanilla ice cream which was good.  \n\nService was good and friendly, and price is what you expect for Belden Lane: about $20 an entree.

None of this vegan nonesense just yet.\n\nSO I ordered the sanddabs, not realizing that they were going to be coming out literally swimming in pure butter. SWIMMING! It was like a really unhealthy sand dab soup. And the flavor was nothing to write home about.

Did I mention it probably had about 3 sticks of butter in 1 single dish? I felt so sick after eating there, I had to go home from work early.

Rich and creamy. My husband had the crab cakes that comes with a little crab salad and it was good! I love shell fish. \n\nI think the theme might be seafood cause for the second course we had crab ravioli, which is amazing, and I had the half lobster with risotto.

Nonetheless, I was in heaven. I think the only words can describe their food are good and amazing. So let me be redundant here. \n\nThe third course, we had the medallion beef steak and sea bass. I don't particularly like this fish but the way they cooked it made this dish exceptionally good. \n\nThe 4th course is the dessert, my favorite. My husband got the fried bananas with caramel and vanilla ice cream. I got the chocolate cake with raspberry sauce? Guess what? Yep, the desserts were good. They are to die for! Especially the chocolate cake. \n\nThe place is really cute and I think if you come here, you should seat outside. Yeah, no matter how cold it is. They have outdoor heater. Actually the four restaurant on Belden does look very european with the location in the alley, the tables are very close to each other, and the christmas lights above.

He insisted to be moved to another bigger table but the waiter told him that table was for 4 people. Begrudgingly he accepted his table. Kudos for the waiter. \n\nI understand that he might want some privacy as many americans hate being close to each other but come on,  the whole point of the tables are being so close to each other is to create the communal dinner atmosphere like many restaurants in Europe.

We were both born and bred in California and although, I have encountered my share of eye-slanting and bigotry in less urban places, I was completely taken off-guard by a supposed \"fine-dining\" restaurant in San Francisco.

I took my wife back to experience this bliss.  They had salmon and it was very good, but it was not that peak experience.

I sat outside, I sat inside upstairs, I sat inside downstairs.  Outside is nice on a warm day when you want to people watch.  I actually prefer inside.  Yes, the inside is a little bit kitschy.  I don't mind.  Yes, it is Belden Alley.  It is often crowded and bit chaotic.  The people trying to lure you into each of the places on the alley can be a bit pushy.  Despite this, I like Belden Alley.\n\nI have had various pasta dishes.  Always good.  One time I ordered clams with linguine.  I don't know what came over me.  I was surprised when it came to the table with the clams in the shells -- no reason I should have been surprised.  Even though I would not order it again, I ate it and thought it was very good.  One of the people from the office is vegetarian and always wants a menu item prepared in some special way.  They happily accommodate.

My friend and I arrived here last night around 7 and got a table on the patio which wasn't at all busy. It took about 15 minutes for a waiter to finally come over and throw menus at us. He didn't greet us, make eye contact or say anything just gave us menus and walked away. So as we peruse the menus another waiter walks over and drops off a couple glasses of water and my friend asks if they have any warm bread. He returns with a basket of room temperature dinner rolls and so my friend asks again politely if he could warm them up. This asshole gives her a cold hard stare, takes the dinner rolls and shoves them onto the wait station near our table and walks away. Wtf? So eventually another waiter (a bald older gentleman) comes over and takes our order. No smiles, no specials, no greetings just another hard stare that said \"Wtf do you want?\" At this point I suggest to my friend about blowing out of this place but she really wants Italian so we order two apps and two entrees. About ten minutes later another waiter comes by and drops off another basket of dinner rolls, room temperature, whatever. It takes almost half an hour for our first appetizer to appear, a caprese salad which was mediocre at best. The fennel mussels came next which were decent, and our entrees when they finally arrived (tortellini & lamb shank) were actually quite tasty. My gripe with this place was really just the horrible service. I had to ask multiple times to get these guys to clear our table, asked three times for the check and every time I kept getting attitude like \"what now, why are you bothering us?!\" Seriously, this kind of service for $130 meal?

Excellent! Bf ordered the dover sole with calms, that was ok. Actually I ordered the sole but when I realized it came with calms he took it off my hands since clams give me hives.

I brought a copule of friends from out of town here the other night since they hadn't yet been to Belden Place. What a complete letdown. We were all seriously disappointed.  The meal started with my *trying* to order a reasonably priced - think under $40 - bottle of Sangiovese.  The waiter rudely countered they were out of it and suggested a $70 bottle of Chianti. When I politely said that we weren't interested in a Chianti, he walked away and someone else came up to talk to us about the wine. They were out of our first two choices and we finally settled on a reasonbly priced bottle of Syrah (in the $35-40 price range), which our waiter commented \"wasn't very good\" when he realized what we ordered. Ok, um, then why do you have it on your menu if it's \"not very good\"??! Does this mean that the only wines that are \"good\" are the ones that are over fifty bucks!? Anyway, moving on. The wine turned out to be decent, and then it was time to order. They had only one veggie option (ravioli), which I wasn't really in the mood for. Since they had several other pasta options, I asked if the meat could be left out of one of them (since they had other veggies in the ingredients). He (again, in a very rude tone of voice) informed me that, no, the kitchen could NOT leave the meat out because it was put together in advance! Huh!!?? Pre-made meals!? Really!? Were we at Applebees?! Then, he pointed to ONE dish they could leave meat out of: a pasta with tomato sauce. I asked if, since they were leaving the meat out, they could throw some mushrooms (or any veggies) on in its place, and he said yes. Well, surprise, surprise, the dish comes out with only pasta and tomato sauce (and the small amount of goat cheese that came on top). When I asked about the veggies, he replied that they didn't have any. HUH??? The kitchen doesn't have a single vegetable!!?? REALLY??! Well, by then, I was so annoyed by his rudeness and the absurdity of it all (I do NOT intend to pay in the neighborhood of $20 for some boiled pasta with a little bit of sub-par tomato sauce slapped on top), that I told him I was sure the kitchen could find SOME veggies somewhere. He abruptly snatched my plate, took it to the kitchen and brought it back a few minutes later with some asparagus thrown in. And, surprise, surprise, the only other ingredient (besides the pasta and tomato sauce) - the goat cheese- had disappeared! I asked him if they could put this back on there and he replied: \"You want MORE cheese!?\" As if I was asking too much because I wanted the cheese that was SUPPOSE to come on the dish AND a few pieces of vegetables in the place of the meat that was left off!!!!! \n\nAfter it was all said and done, the food was maybe a 2.5 or 3, but the service renders it a zero! My friends' meals were equally average, and they were so astounded at the terrible service that they asked me if service is \"usually like this in SF\". Thanks, Tiramisu, you ruined the night out with my out of town friends and made me look like an idiot for taking them to this place that they commented \"must be for tourists since they certainly don't seem to care about repeat business\".

Atmosphere was great, was a little bit cold for outdoor dining, but would not mind going back when it warms up. Indoors was a little bit cramped in space, and might get loud with large parties. Waitstaff was very attentive, informative and nice. They all seemed to speak italian among themselves which added some authenticity to this place.\n\nI got the Ravioli, and it was delicious! Unlike many italian + faux-italian restraunts, the dishes weren't overwhelming you with spices, chees,e and creme. Portion was average, but with the unlimited bread + olive oil, I was full.  Only thing holding me back from going again is the price.", "author": "Pope A."}

I like the festive lights the line the alley at night and how you can pretty much smell and check out other people's plates from the restaurant next door from where you're seating. \nMy roommates and I had dinner here on a Friday night for my birthday.  I'm glad that it's only a few blocks from the Montgomery Bart station. We had some really good stuffed calamari and squids for appetizer and it's probably the cheapest item in the menu (~$12). The price range is about $12 to $32.  Anna liked the Cioppino ($18 - stew of local rockfish, Tomales Bay Manila clams & mussels, Dungeness crab in Lobster broth) - lots of seafood in a light broth. Annie thought that her sole dover ($24) is kind of bland and it has no pasta in it. I tried the Crocchette ($25, I'm not sure if I spell this right) and I love it! Just enough seafood (clams, Dungeness crab, and shrimp) and thickness of the red sauce and it has some pasta! Very filling and yummy. We tried the house wine and had some Merlot and they're ok. We split a $20 for two dessert sampler (Tiramisu, Warm  chocolate cake, Biscotti, Cannoli, Creme Brulee, Ice cream in a home made sugar cone bowl, Lemon Meringue Tart, Yogurt Panna Cotta, and Profiteroles). The only ones that I really like are the creme brulee and the yogurt panna cotta. Overall, the food is okay but pricey but the ambiance is awesome! The wallpaper inside the restaurant is reminiscent of Pompeii. They haev a very nice, intimate setting and bar inside and I'm just glad that they have a restroom, unlike the other restaurant next door.", "author": "Joselita T."}

We had had a range of items, including the raw oysters, black ink risotto with scallops, buffalo mozzarella and heirloom tomato salad, mixed grilled seafood, linguine a la vongole and finally, seared ahi  over spicy shrimp risotto. Of all of these dishes, the only ones I really enjoyed eating were the oysters and the salad, both of which I could find elsewhere or make at home (not enough scallop with the black ink; grilled fish item from mix was rather dry, and the general mix was good but not special; the linguine also lacked outstanding qualities, with the pasta being a little too dry and too much; the spicy shrimp risotto was like risotto mixed with Sriracha and topped with canned tuna fish since the fish was not so much as seared as it was fully cooked). But, though not impressed with the food, the waitress and management were very accommodating; example, my grandfather was not familiar with any of the menu dishes and has for a long time considered linguine a la vongole his favorite Italian pasta dish. It was not on the menu, but management whipped it up for him anyway.\nI've been told that at night the outdoor seating does not exist, and really the charm of Belden is the canopied front shop seating (note, if you come at 12, you may have to wait a while but if you come at 12:30, forget about it. This place is very popular with those working in the Financial District, so clusters of co-workers and small business lunches line up beginning at 12. Try to get there at the very latest, 11:45); so, if I were to come back it would only be for lunch.\nIn summary...\n5 for customer service\n5 for atmosphere\n4 for presentation\n3 for food... and though everything else was outstanding, I really have to emphasize and warn about the pretty but lackluster food that priced at $20/person for lunch! I would not object to coming here again, I did have a lot of fun, but be forewarned... this is about the relaxing, 2 hr dining vacation experience than the actual food itself.", "author": "Jessica L."}

Then I had the rigatoni with sausage, spinach and goat cheese, which I really liked.  She had the cheese ravioli, which looked really good - but I didn't try a bite.

Luckily my bf remembered this place during our trip to SF this past weekend.  I wasn't sure what to expect with the mixed reviews, but I'm so glad I ate here because it was one the best meals I had this weekend! \n\nFor starters, we had the black ink risotto with seared scallops and the dungeness crab ceasar salad (recommended by the hostess)...both were really good. I've never seen my bf clear our a plate as fast as he did with the black ink risotto and seared scallops! I'm kinda picky with ceasar salads because they're usually drenched in dressing, but this particular one was perfectly dressed -- pretty much the entire salad was lightly coated with the dreassing and topped with a bed of crab meat and parmesean.  For our main entrees, I had the ahi tuna with spicy crab risotto and my bf had the braised short ribs. The spicy crab risotto was not so spicy, but I didn't care because spicy or not, it was so good! I felt the ahi tuna and the risotto paired together really well. The braised short ribs was done exactly the way we like our short ribs - so tender that you don't really need a knife.  (Hey, I just noticed that we ordered pretty much the same thing as Joe H.'s review below! I guess we have the same good taste in food!) After all that food we didn't quite make it to dessert. I was bummed out because I saw a few items I really wanted to try, but I was seriously way too full and I didn't think I would be able to walk back to our hotel, or anywhere at all! We loved the food so much that we can't wait to go back!\n\nI had to -1 star because our server was kinda weird. He didn't seem so friendly at first, I think even the people at the table next to us felt that way, but he improved over the course of the dinner. The place is super small and crowded, but I guess that's part of the Belden Alley experience. Hopefully you'll get seated next to people you don't mind talking to because the tables are so close that you 're pretty much dining with them.", "author": "Cat T."}

This place filled up pretty quickly, esp. for a Monday night.\n\nAs for the food, they give you a breadbasket and some pesto/garlic spread which was awesome.

A vast improvement over the dish I remember having two and a half years ago (slab of grilled salmon or something. It stands out because I remember it being very tender... almost as tender as the scottish salmon that Aqua used to serve).

Not really the spicy shrimp as described though.\n\nMy friend got the short ribs, which was an absolutely monstrous plate. It would be a good entree if you are starving.

It was real easy to daydream about being a wise guy and having a family business meeting all while enjoying a tasty rib eye.  The waiter even had a thick Italian accent and it would be a safe bet to think his name is Tony, Furio or Gino, or some other stereotypical name.  I don't usually stereotype people's name but it fit in with my daydream so leave it alone!\n\nIt is a bit crowded in the patio area but 'tis nothing to complain about understanding the need to utilize space in SF.  We started with some appetizers and they were all very good.   I had a medium rare rib eye that was a generous portion of meat positioned in the middle of some wine sauce and mashed taters.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and felt like I got a whole week worth of protein in one sitting.  I think I unlocked the secret of Tony Siragusa's gargantuan size.  He's a big, fat-assed football player turned sideline commentator for those of you that neglect watching NFL football.  Everything was quite delicious that evening so we decided to try a dessert that would gently lull us further into food coma.  There were a lot of choices being thrown around so the waiter suggested we try the dessert sampler platter.  I heard of this platter before and my wife's purported feat of eating the whole platter by her self.  I was curious to see this platter of goodies so I was glad we ordered it.  When it came out I could hear moans of excitement.  The platter had everything from tiramisu and chocolate dipped biscotti to sorbetto and connolis.  The dessert platter was a big hit and the platter was more than enough to serve 4 people.  So, this begs the question, did my wife really eat a whole platter by her self?  According to one living eyewitness the answer is \"yes\".  After this was disclosed she got mad and ate the eyewitness so with no substantial proof and a fear of getting eaten alive the legend lives on.  Just kidding honey.", "author": "DC R."}

Oh and then Maurizzio our waiter yanked my partners menu and mumbled something about spilling olive oil on it.  Thank goodness my partner didn't hear what he said because he would have been pissed! \nThe food was pretty good the Mozzarella Salad and the Black Ink Risotto\nwere pretty tasty!  For our entrees we had the Crispy Chicken cooked under a brick and the Beef Short Ribs, both were really good.\nIt wasn't a total disappointment although I will never go back, to many other options that I like on Belden Place!\nOh and by the way, take your time ordering because they bring the food out so damn fast your head will spin!  I don't mean to be so negative, and I know this is just an outdoor cafe.  But can't the management change all the damn burned out light bulbs that are strung outside??\nTotal bill with tip was around: $155 for 2 ppl", "author": "John M."}

(I will admit that friends of mine know the owners, but they only know them because my friends ate at the restaurant so often.)  I have eaten at Tiramisu with vegetarians (though I doubt there is every anything vegan on the menu) and with ravenous meat eaters.  The menu always pleases.  The food is always exquisite, well paced, and the wine list is immense.  They always offer recommendations to fit our price range, even lowering prices to fit as well.  \nI highly recommend the Caesar salad with lobster, any of the raviolis, and do not leave without getting the dessert sampler.  It is huge.  For four people, we often order only the sampler for 2, and cannot finish it.  They also do a cocktail with espresso and sambuca which is amazing.\n\nPS, I just had a small wedding reception dinner at Tiramisu in their basement semi-private area (other guests walk through to use the restroom).

Usually I don't like crab cakes because they're too bready or mushy but the crab cakes there are at least 90% crab, just the way I like it.  And they have a nice combo of fluffiness and crispiness.  The only problem with this place is that it gets filled with suits during the lunch hour and you get crammed into tables and have to bump elbows with strangers.  It also gets really loud and it's difficult to hold an audible conversation.  And once my friend found a rock (yes, a rock) in her cioppino.  She could have bit into it and broken some teeth.

I almost couldn't finish my entre as I had half of a huge pot of steamed mussels. Then for dessert we were debating whether to get the tiramisu and we ended up getting the gelato/sorbet instead. There were 2 kinds of gelato (vanilla bean/hazelnut) and raspberry sorbet contained in a bird's nest (a crunch sweet shell). With every bite you would have part of the crunchy shell with a spoonful of gelato/sorbet. The two elements really complimented each other. By the end of the meal, I was overly full.

The crab and lobster ravioli was most delicious! The downside of the dish was that the crab/lobster wasn't cleaned well, so you had to be careful and spit out the shells. However, the flavoring was so tastebud-teasing that the shells became a minor issue. My friend had the sea bass, which was buttery. It was a little fishy for my taste, but nonetheless, it was good.

The salad dressing was too heavy on the oil, and therefore flavorless. The salmon was good. Not great, but it was cooked appropriately, with a nice polenta cake included. My colleage had the mozzarella salad, which looked delicious, with a good amount of mozzarella and some nice arugula. He also had the chicken. It looked large and appealing, if you're into chicken, but it was not only pink inside, there were parts of it that was actually blood red. Uh, excuse me?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-04-05", "description": "This restaurant was recommended by the Campton Hotel Concierge. It was by far and away one of the worst restaurants I have ever experienced. I was very disappointed because we paid more than $100 for a dinner for 2. We went on a weekday and they only had once soup to choose from--artichoke soup. I love to try new taste combinations but this soup was as bad as it sounds. I have never eaten any soup as bad as this. It was quite bitter with a horrible aftertaste that no amount of bread, water, soda, or liquor could remedy. Every restaurant has at least one bad item so we were hoping for some solid hits with the entrees. While waiting for our orders, I finished a diet coke and had it refilled only to find out that this restaurant charges $3 for each diet coke including refills!! Maybe I would not have minded so much had the waiter acknowledged this before slamming refills on my table one after another. I had the rack of lamb. This entree was good, they gave you a decent amount of lamb and paired it with a mediocre side dish. My wife had their special, Halibut with beans. You heard me right, beans. As I said before, I love to try new tastes and flavor combinations. I was a little hesistant but went into it with an open mind. Do yourself a favor both at home and when you dine out--never under any circumstance combine fish and beans. I don't know if they ever tasted this dish but the combinations was painful. The fish was so well cooked that it had the consistency of  leather and we had to use my steak knife to cut through it. It also tasted like leather as well, actually, it tasted like paper, because it was very bland and had no taste. The beans were straight from a can of \"pork and beans\" from your neighborhood grocery store.  I don't know what else to say because I was so sick afterward that I could barely stumble back home. The service was absolutely poor. It was outside dining and our waiter was standing next to us the entire time. It would have been great if he was actually paying attention to our needs. He only had one table to wait on, ours. He spent most of his time monkeying around with the other waitors, putting each other in headlocks, making jokes, and have a good time. This would be acceptable behavior if he was out enjoying himself after ours at a bar, but he was not and obviously was not paying attention to his duties as a waiter. Suffice it to say, I've been served by 4th graders in a high school gym that did a far better job than our waiter and his merry band of pranksters at this restaurant. After the awful meal, we decided to go with the namesake dessert, tiramisu. How can you name your restaraunt Tiramisu and not be absolute masters with this dessert. The tiramisu had the appropriate taste, not too sweet like many others but it was the soggiest stuff I have ever eaten. This is my favorite dessert that I order from almost every single restaraunt that I eat at. This was somewhere above the average but nothing that I would ever name a restaurant after. The presentation was great with sauce strewn back and forth on the plate and a few sliced strawberries along with the tiramisu covered on four sides by black chocolate. It was just truly a crushing experience to sink by teeth into this soggy sponge cake. Although if I had to choose, soggy tiramisu is better than rock hard tiramisu. As I said, the flavoring was accurate, but it felt like they left it in a refrigerator that was turned almost to he off position. This may seem a harsh rating for this restaurant but consider that I spent over $100 for this meal during my stay and also ate at Nieman Marcus and Ana Marana for less than this amount while enjoying possibly some of the best food of my travels, I have to give my humble opinion not to waste your money at this establishment. It may be good when compared to restaurants of its class, but if you are to compare it with restaurants in the SF area, it definitely deserves no more than 2 stars and nary a second look.", "author": "Tommy L."}

From a distance it seemed like the American hostess was out of line, I assumed this because I figured the Italian manager/owner knew better than to argue out in the dining room in front of patrons, but when the argument got to our table I overheard the manager/owner backing down and agreeing that she was right about the money she was owed.  The whole scene of the manager/owner trying to cheat the hostess in front of everyone was pretty ugly.\n\nI wouldn't go back, the food doesn't live up to the prices, and although our service was fine, the scene in the dining area was definitely amateur hour.", "author": "D C."}

The artichokes under the sand dabs were more delicious than the fish itself.  The buffalo mozzarella salad was delicious- it comes with red bell peppers marinated in a sweet sauce, arugala, proscuitto.  Except for the vanilla gelato, the desserts were terrible (we ordered the dessert sampler).  Do not order this, unless you want to be disappointed by most of it. The service and waiters were good.  I was happy with the restaurant, aside from dessert.", "author": "Nisey D."}

Had reservations for New Year's eve and was seated promptly. Prixe fix meal was changed slightly from what was originally on their website, but they charged less for it to compensate. Can get pricey really fast, but overall no complaints.", "author": "Juan M."}

So, sit inside, as close to the window as possible, so you'll feel like you're outside without all the irritations.  It's quieter inside too.  Make sure you eat here on an expense account because it's damn expensive for what you get.  Appetizers were the best value.  A heaping mussel plate ($15) with the largest mussels ever.  I thought I would be scared, but they were tasty.  The oyster appetizer was underwhelming and the oysters were small, smaller than the mussels.  Strange.  As for the main entrees: my seabass was so overcooked, it tasted like halibut.  Erg.  The assorted seafood platter was horrifying: the most gigantic crawfish (or is that shrimp?) ever with the head and arms still attached (I don't want a gigantic insect like thing sitting on the very top of my plate like it just killed the other items there), and the remaining items weren't appealing, either.  The scallop risotto was a thimble full of risotto with maybe two scallops on top.  It was damn tiny, and you had to laugh.  And the ahi tuna was nice, kinda like if you can't decide between raw and cooked, so you get both, seared on the outside, raw on the inside.  But not a lot of it on the plate.  Thank goodness the appetizers were so large!  The desert cheese plate was 5 small pieces of cheese, four grapes and one strawberry slice on an enormous plate, reminding me of a modern art gallery.  The saving grace was the tiramisu, the best I've ever had in my life, and I always get tiramisu when it's available.  But that's not enough to eat here.  Just get appetizer and tiramisu, avoid the entrees.  And if they try to seat you in the basement, just walk out.  The only reason to go down there is to use the restroom.  The atmosphere is horrible, horrible down there!", "author": "A P."}
