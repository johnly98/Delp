I decided to give it a try one evening as I was leisurely strolling through Japantown and found it about half full of customers. I didn't have high expectations about the quality based on some of the Yelp feedback I read, and frankly that preconception helped me get through my meal without incident.\n\nI decided on three smaller items off their menu, but to my pleasant surprise, they generously served me a miso soup and salad anyway (photo: http://bit.ly/2z8G2xR). My first item was the $8.50 Chicken Yakitori because I felt like having a couple of skewers of poultry (photo: http://bit.ly/2Kx8QVW). The meat alternated with scallions and red pepper, but the flavor was compromised by the gooey marinade. Better was the $12.50 Hamachi Kama which was yellowtail collar simply grilled with the skin left intact (photo: http://bit.ly/2KDjNVv).\n\nThe simpler, the better. That's why the kama worked for me, but sometimes simple is just too simple. That was the mistake I made with my third choice, the appropriately priced $5 Avocado Roll which was just that, avocado rolled in rice and nori (photo: http://bit.ly/2KN9afH). There wasn't enough flavor to make it interesting. I didn't find anything offensive about Kippu, it just felt interchangeable with any number of J-Town eateries offering the exact same dishes. Maybe that's good enough sometimes.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...middling Japanese fare with the kama the best of the plates I had\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...pretty standard decor for J-Town\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...a bit on the slow side\nTOTAL - 3 stars...kinda nondescript for my taste", "author": "Ed U."}

Kinda reminds me of the neverending menu at cheesecake factory, indecisive eaters beware! That aside, we kept our choices simple. We chose the rock and roll and the spicy killer roll. Both of rolls were decent. The spicy killer roll was an amped spicy tuna roll which tasted overwhelming of siracha, taking away from the flavor of the fish. Rick and roll hit the spot for my fiance. Overall, the experience was okay. \n\nA bit overpriced for mediocre rolls with decent fish quality. Quick and speedy service, however they did forget our utensils.

I decided to give it another try last week during the weekday and boy was I surprised! \n\nThe First thing I noticed was the deco: they definitely cleaned up nicely compared to my last visit.\n\nSecond, the food presentation bumped up quite a bit! Dishes were wonderfully plated, meticulous even.\n\nThird, most important of all it seemed as though they've improved on the quality of the ingredients. I wouldn't say it was the absolute best quality but reasonably decent for its price.\n\n\nThings to try:\n\n1. Flaming Dragon - I'm not much of a sushi roll person but if you are, this is a definite must try! Baked salmon with avocado and crabmeat with a special sauce which reminds me of Lion King Roll(which is another good roll). Doesn't hurt that it has a theatrical effect with the actual FLAME which adds a finishing touch to the baked flavors of the neatly aluminum wrapped roll(which they'll peel for you once the flame is out).\n\n2. 22pc sashimi combo - This was my favorite. Of course pricier than sushi rolls, but the meticulous attention to detail and the fresh ingredients used made it my most memorable of my visit.\n\n3. Vege Tempura - Again I'm not a big fan of tempura, but one member of my party wanted to try it so we decided to split it. I ended up grabbing a few pieces of my own and was delightfully surprised! Crisp, vegetables cooked to tenderness, solid tempura that made me craving for more!\n\n4. Service was incredibly attentive, which is expected at a Japanese restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall: If you've made it this far in the review then I'd like to congratulate you :)\n\n\n\n\nKippu is a cute and modern sushi-stop with a twist of traditional charm.

We weren't expecting much from a Japanese restaurant right on the tourist strip, but Kippu's fish was really good. Nice temperature, good texture and larger pieces than I would've expected. More importantly the sushi rice was a really well done: vinegar with just a touch of sweet, very similar to my own recipe. I'm pretty sure the place was Korean owned, which isn't a surprise these days in J-town.  \n\nThe service was a bit sparse, as it was two hosts/servers/bussers for maybe 15 tables and you could not order anything, even sushi, via the sushi bar.

Of course, I am not a San Fran native - I hail from a frosty midwestern town where sushi is subpar; however, I know a good deal when I see it. The sashimi pieces were HUGE - big enough where I dropped it in my soy sauce and splattered my shirt by accident (and I'm usually good with chopsticks). We had a boat deal for $69 which included four rolls and many pieces of sashimi. I requested that all of my sashimi be salmon, but you can sample quite a few using this deal. The rolls were fantastic, but be warned - their spicy tuna is so spicy my nose began running one piece in. I attacked the sashimi full force and still struggled to finish it.", "author": "Carrie K."}

We were looking for a place to dine on Thanksgiving Day for a late lunch; this seems to be the only other restaurant (Japanese unless you prefer Korean of which there were several in Japantown of all places) that was open in addition to Mifune.\n\nThe service was totally harried and too efficient in a bad way.  If one wanted to request something from the server she was either rushing around seating other diners or getting orders to the tables.  It was just chaotic and irritating to have to flag the server down.\n\nOtherwise, the food was pretty substandard & portions meager for the high prices charged.\n\nA bowl of seafood udon consisted of two medium sized prawns, one (yes, one) bay shrimp, and a tiny smattering of what they consider mussels (the tiniest they could buy and without shells).  Oh, there was one miniscule piece of squid's tentacles included with maybe two slivers of carrot. All of this at a price of $14.95.  Robbery.  The rolls were just ok.  And their bento boxes were beyond overpriced for what one got (e.g. thinnest cut of salmon).\n\nSo they were packed on Thanksgiving Day not because they're great but because nothing else except Mifune was open.", "author": "Luisa T."}

Our waitress was not very friendly, and seemed as if she wanted to be anywhere but there. We had to ask her for water, which is understandable given California's drought. However, what was not understandable or acceptable was why she gave us half-full glasses of tap water, while the tables near us had full glasses of water with ice cubes. The waitress did not offer to refill our glasses once we finished the half-full water glasses, so we kept having to repeatedly ask her for more water (which we received in a slow manner). My food was okay; I ordered the vegetarian bento box, which came with inari, vegetable tempura, miso soup, salad, and karrokes. The quantity of food I received for the price (around $13) was pretty good, and overall I enjoyed my dinner, with the exception of the inari tofu. It was soggy, hardly breaded and fried at all, and just tasted bad. My boyfriend ordered the dinner bento box special, and the California roll portion of his meal literally came with two pieces. Finally, after sitting and waiting for our check for about 10 minutes after our plates had been cleared, we had to ask the waitress to please bring us our check, which took several more minutes. When she finally arrived at our table, she brought us someone else's check, so we had to go up to the front counter and ask for our proper check. \nWe wanted to try a new restaurant in Japantown that we hadn't been to yet, so we chose this one.

A few days ago, my friend and I were hungry and were craving sushi rolls. And since we were in Japantown, we popped by here and saw what looked mighty big sushi rolls as displayed by the pictures in the window. But in actuality the sushi rolls were pretty tiny - definitely not as big as how they were advertised on the window pictures! How disappointing. \n\nWe ordered the Java roll, Dragon Roll and the Incredible roll... As well as a spicy tuna hand roll and salmon skin hand roll, and for dessert, a scoop of green tea ice cream. Meals come with miso soup (this was kind of bland...) and a side salad with sesame dressing (dressing is good).  I'll admit the food in general had pretty good seasoning and flavor (however the seafood tasted slightly fishy, meaning it wasn't super fresh), but I was just a little upset that the portions of the rolls were smaller than advertised.  Each roll came with 8 small sushi pieces, kind of a lot of dough given the high $11-$13/roll price tag.  OK, $11-$13/roll is pretty standard at most Japanese joints, but usually sushi rolls come with 10-12 pieces, not a measly 8.

I'd ordinarily give this place 3.5 stars, but based on all these BS reviews, I have to be objective and cut completely the opposite way. The sushi was fresh and arrived quickly. Would I say it was out of this world? Absolutely not, but without a doubt it is good, and the menu is quite extensive.\n\nSo now, lets move onto service which is another place where people are busy trashing this establishment.

I ordered Sushi Combo C, which had 7 nigiris and a tekka roll, which costed $17, so the price is definitely on the high end. The sushi was ok, but wasn't exceptional as I had expected beforehand, and the variety is very narrow (all the nigiris in the combo were of red/white fish pieces--there was no color e.g. egg, octopus, fish roe etc, which was disappointing).\n\nWould definitely recommend finding sushi elsewhere e.g. the conveyor belt sushi boat places, where you can find a much larger variety of fish selection", "author": "Henry L."}

I had seen Kippu before, but never got the chance to give them a try, so for the sake of adventure, I did. \n\nKippu is a very cozy narrow restaurant that seems to have mostly younger people working there. I noticed that their menu had many wonderful pictures of the different sushi rolls they offered, and instantly I became quite excited to give a few a try. \n\nI saw numerous individuals on yelp talking about the \"flaming dragon\" roll, so I opted to give that a try. my friends ordered some other rolls to sample. and after a bit of a wait, we were served. \n\nof the numerous rolls we had, I feel that while they were quite good, some of the fish didn't taste very \"fresh\" to me. not that they were old or spoiled, just that I feel I have tasted fresher. maybe that's just the cat in me being picky, but that is my feeling. the flavor of the rolls we had were decent, nothing too crazy or overwhelming, basically your standard decent sushi. \n\nthe flaming dragon I saw many speaking of is definitely a show piece! they bring the foil wrapped roll on FIRE which is visually appealing. although I feel the roll itself while good, wasn't too much special. \n\nservice here is very nice and polite and they were very attentive to us which I highly appreciate. \n\noverall, I'd say that Kippu is a fairly priced sushi restaurant that isn't the best in the world, but isn't bad either! worth a shot if you are in japantown and don't want to go to one of the \"main\" restaurants in the mall. \n*Chirp!*", "author": "Jei C."}

I ended up getting the double salmon roll because mercury tastes delicious, and a vegetarian bento box on the side because vegetables and fibrous materials. The miso soup is really, really salty here, and I say that as someone who always finishes her complimentary miso soup. \n\nWe decided to be annoying and asked for a seat in the back with the comfy lounge cushions instead of the rickety wooden chairs in the front. The waitress shook her head, saying that the back tables were only for parties of 10. It was 2 o'clock on a Wednesday. A party of 10 is not going to come strolling in and demand to be crammed around two tiny tables. I said so more or less, and she signed through her nose and said, sure, but only if we agree to move if a party of 10 comes in. It felt a little bizarre playing this passive-agro tug of war over a hypothetical party of 10 stragglers, but she lit up when we ordered 5 rolls and a ton of bento boxes. \n\nTwo stars for delicious agedashi tofu.

The food literally made me sick.\n\nMy friend I arrived at 9:20pm, which seemed like plenty of time given that the restaurant allegedly closes at 10:00pm.  With in two seconds of seating we were told to order within the next five minutes because the kitchen was closing.  Ok.  A minute later the waitress was back demanding our order.  It is a large menu and we did not even have time to read it.\n\nThen we ordered.  The waitress talked my friend into ordering two rolls that basically were fried California rolls.  I had not even read half the menu, so I asked the waitress for a recommendation.  At her suggestion, I ordered one roll, something with spicy tuna.  And, of course the waitress pushed me to order more.  Based upon the photos and high price, I thought one roll was sufficient.  But, the waitress insisted otherwise and further pressured that the kitchen was now closed -- it was only 9:22pm.  So, I also ordered a spicy tuna hand roll and croquets. \n\nWell they must have had items pre-made because the next thing we knew they were throwing food on the table and taking it away faster than we could eat it.  The waitress failed toe toon that everything comes with miso soup and salad.  When they both unexpectedly arrived, we officially knew we were swindled into ordering too much food.  \n\nThe spicy tuna hand roll was nothing to write home about and a bit fishy.  The moment I took the last bite the waitress, knowing I had another roll coming, swiped my plate, ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce.  Then set down the croquets which were average.  As soon as the croquets cooled they were disgusting and they got cold fast.  \n\nThen the rolls came.  My friend's rolls were average fried and expensive California rolls that were made with fake crab at real crab prices.  She was upset because the waitress clearly pushed her to over order as well and the once the rolls cooled off they were gross.  Again, my roll had fake crab and spicy tuna. It tasted worse than a cheap roll from the grocery store and cost $16.  It was not fresh or worth the price charged.  In fact, I asked for a beer to wash it down and didn't finish it.\n\nThe service was so rude.  They started putting chairs up on tables around us at 9:30pm.  This is inappropriate because the restaurant is open until 10:00pm and, more importantly, there were guests still waiting for food.  We left well before 10:00pm and the lights were off and the staff was walking out too -- seriously change your hours to reflect the restaurants actual closing time.   If the rushed service, bad service, and fact that the restaurant closed before completing its food service wasn't bad enough, our waitress was not friendly and purposely oversold us on food.  Maybe that works with tourists, but we live here and expect a more honest approach.\n\nTo make matters worse, by the time I got home, I was violently ill.  I think it was the fishy tuna.  Let's just say it was a long and unpleasant night of my body physically ejecting what I ate there.  Miserable.  I think it had to be the fishy tuna because my friend did not feel well, but was not violently ill.\n\nMaybe it was an off night for this place, but either way they got me really sick and that is really not ok.", "author": "Kiki I."}

I regret not taking a photo of it, but it didn't look like toro to me when it came to our table. First of all, color and texture weren't like toro or any part of tuna. Secondly, it looked like it came out of paper shredder; they made diagonal cuts on the surface... What kind of sushi restaurant treat a piece of toro this way?? I was already suspicious even before tasting it. So we tasted it, and it tasted nothing like tuna. It kind of had Saba flavor but definitely not tuna. It also had this weird consistency; the center was harder than the surface. I realized the diagonal cuts were to hide this weird consistency which was so different from real toro. \n\nWe asked our server if what we had was really tuna. She was not sure so she brought another server to our table. This person had a frowny face and stood by our table without saying anything. So I asked the question again, then she said, \"it is fatty tuna, and there is nothing wrong with the fish.\" I asked for the proof that it is actually tuna, then she went to talk to a sushi chef, and then came back to our table, took our bill without saying anything, and came back with a new bill and put it down on the table without saying a word and left. We looked at the bill and found they took out \"Toro $14.95\" from our bill. \n\nI'm 99.5% sure that the fish we ate was \"white tuna (oil fish/escolar)\" which is nothing to do with tuna. It was very oily it made my stomach upset. \n\nThe fact that they didn't have a proof or that they didn't try to explain why they can't bring a paperwork already says something. And there was no \"I'm sorry we didn't meet your expectation\" or \"Thank you for coming.\" She said nothing to us and just left the bill on the table. \n\nI'm not going back there. I don't trust any of their food now. If you choose to go, avoid \"toro.\"\n\nIt's so sad this restaurant is in Japantown because it really doesn't represent Japan.

Came into the establishment and was seated right away, looked through the menus and the waitress comes over and asks us if we are ready to order. We weren't ready yet so we started off with two cokes. Once we were ready, we ordered 3 rolls, an appetizer and some miso soups. The miso soups were complimentary which was nice and we got the oysters, the mountain roll, the scallop bay roll and titanic. The first roll that came was the rainbow roll which wasn't what we ordered and so we let it sit there till our server came so we can tell her that it isn't what we ordered. Later on, she dropped off the titanic and scallop bay roll which was good and then later dropped off the mountain roll. Here's when things get a bit frustrating. She was the only server and she running around frustrated which I understood cause business started picking up but when she dropped off the mountain roll, I guess she didn't realize that it wasn't the mountain roll to begin with and it took her awhile to come check back with us. And we were patiently waiting, so patient to the point where we finished our first two rolls and our oysters that weren't even pleasant. Once she came, my friend and I were telling her that this isn't what we ordered and she tried to tell us that it was and we showed her the picture and she said, \"it has this this and this\" and then we pointed it out that it didn't have the certain toppings on it, so she asked us if we wanted those toppings on it and we said yes and she went and did that for us.

The food came out in stages of course, but they tried to make sure everyone had at least one of their dishes in the first round so that no one would be waiting and hungry. Everyone really enjoyed their food (and this was not just because we had been drinking sake...).  To top it all off, the waiters all sang very exuberantly to my friend for her bday, and brought her a dessert on the house which was big enough for literally everyone at the table to have some.  Yum!\n\nThe bill was really reasonable considering the beer & sake, all the food, and the great service.  It came to about $50pp, including paying for the bday girl and tipping well.\n\nI would definitely consider bringing another large group here.  I can't believe our luck to come without a reservation, at 7pm on a Friday night, and still make it in with like a 5 minute wait (while they set up the table).

Keep in mind I do not have very high standards for service at all, I don't even mind if I have to ask for have my water glass to be refilled and such. But this was just abysmal. The miso soup didn't come with spoons, and we had to ask twice before they finally got us spoons, by the soup was already lukewarm. Then there was no soy sauce on the table so we had to ask for that. The food was good although average quality for the price. But then the waitress started walking to us asking if we wanted to order more food (what was the rush? I was literally 5 min into my entree), and when we said no, gave us the bill. Here's when the service went from meh to bad: the bill got in just 7 min into my entree (I was 40% done) and the waitress starting pressuring us to pay. What in the world? Then we reluctantly handed our credit card. They billed it and threw the signing tray on or table. Literally threw the bill with a *slap* onto the table. We were polite, reasonably dressed customers!! Uncalled for. And of course I was still only 75% into my entree, and the waitress rudely tapped on the bill and said \"sign please\". To which I replied \"can you please wait for me to eat?\". This is seriously the first time in years that I HAD to leave a bad tip. Disappointed. Regular service is really not that hard.", "author": "Crystal Y."}

The water content from the eggs and onions leaked and made my rice soggy.  The flavor was alright, but nothing spectacular.  The saving grace was the cheap drink prices.

We ordered two bowls of Udon while our friends ordered some sushi rolls.   \n\nIt took only about 5-10 minutes before all three sushi rolls were quickly expedited out and placed on the other side of the table in front of our friends.  As they began to eat, we continued to wonder where our Udon was.  (Udon should probably be ready in under 5 minutes- it might be the EASIEST Japanese dish to prepare in the back kitchen- broth, noodles).\n\nAfter waiting nearly 15-20 minutes we asked if our food was on the way, only to be quickly shrugged off by the crappy waiter with the mohawk. 10 minutes later we decided to ask again with the same response, \"its coming its coming... one minute\".  About 45 minutes after our friends finished their last piece of VERY AVERAGE/ OVERPRICED sushi- I finally walked up to the front to cancel our dishes.  \n\n(The same thing happened to the couple sitting next to us)\n\nOVERALL- terrible experience.

We sat for a longer time than we should have (I managed in the industry) and I eventually had to say \"excuse me\" to order drinks...on Valentines Day!?\n\nThe young lady who served us was less than attentive to us, but they may be due to the fact that they were understaffed (for a restaurant holiday) and very busy...I gave that fact a lot of slack and I understand how that is...So, I was patient.\n\nI ordered my dish and when I recieved the dish, I thought it was a mistake...well, it was...it was mine.  I ordered Nigiri rather than Sashimi (don't ask...)\n\nI asked the Sushi chef (who was slammed and I couldn't even converse with him) if I could just exchange ONE of the fish for another, I hadn't touched it and I really was hoping for that particular fish.  The young lady approached me and said \"Sorry Sir, once it's made we cannot change\"  I replied \"Really!?...you won't even hear what I have to say and make a slight adjustment?\"  She says, \"Let me get the manager\". (or the decision maker, apparently)\n\nI had to ask again later \"who do I have to speak with?\"  She puts this guy in front of her and say \"him\".  \n\nTo our delight, we meet Uugii.  I explain the situation to Uugii and let him know that it was my mistake and I will pay for what I ordered, but I would like to switch a slice if I could.  Uugii was so laid back about this request and had no problem in being accommodating.  Let me just say; this is where I will go back to Kippu just based on that.  Well done Uugii, but it doesn't stop there, more to follow...\n\nThe fish was tasty, fresh and the cuts were honest.  Not the warmest place, it almost felt like a Chinese or Russian restaurant, but Uugii changed all of that.\n\nWe left and were all the way around the corner on Sutter St., we hear a yell and someone running, I braced for a homeless guy to come asking for money or something to that effect...here comes Uugii with our V-Day cards that we had exchanged and forgot...Seriously?  These cards were just cards to them, but he made the run to make sure that we had our cards.

The location is conveniently right off the street and its nestled in a cute corner like location. The place is clean and the staff greeted us with a warm welcome even before they knew that we knew the owner. Overall the food was pretty good and everything tasted fresh. We ordered everything from nigiri, sashimi, hwe dub bap (Korean style sushi bowl) and dessert. Because we knew the owner he surprised us with the flaming dragon roll which comes on out on a plate on fire and even though we tend to not like cooked sushi this roll was delicious, I recommend it to everyone. We also received miso soup and salad which are the usual tasting fare but I was happy to receive it in any case. We also got hot and cold sake, the hot sake went down really smooth and the cold sake had these interesting gold flakes in it, but both were good. The staff were quick to remove plates and to refill all of our drinks.

So we decided to try this place and I'm glad we did! \n\nThe first trip I had the teriyaki beef. It was very tasty! The soup was great as well, I'm usually not a fan of miso soup at all but theirs was different than most. Had to put two ice cubes in it to cool it down but the taste was great. The sushi (not a fan of sushi and I have no idea what was ordered) was good as well. The salad that came with lunch was tasty and the dressing was just right. \n\nToday I had the spicy chicken lunch. The chicken was GOOD! Just spicy enough to have a bite but not to the point where it tasted like burning. Service was great and food came out fast.\n\nPros:\nPrice. It's not a bargain meal but the prices are still really fair. Where else can you get a great meal like this for 6-8 bucks?  \n\nFood. Everything I've had has been great so far!\n\nService.

It's about higher than, say, some restaurants in the Sunset but still price is satisfactory for fulfilling the crave for oysters.\n\nService is overall good. They show signs of potentially being disorganized when busy. For example, the waitress forgot to bring me a new napkin after promising to do so after seeing mine fell on the floor. No big deal. In fact, I'd say I like admiring one of the ladies to me was cute, the one that's more petite that was working there this past Monday night when I ate there. ;)", "author": "H K."}

It's close by and the first time I went was for lunch and the donkatsu was pretty good and service was fine.\n\nI went again recently for dinner and the overall experience was terrible. Hey, restaurants get swamped and honest mistakes are bound to happen. The kicker was the manner in which they handled what they knew was a terrible dining experience for a customer.\n\n1) Walked in and got a seat at the sushi bar. About 10 minutes passed when an older lady asked if I had already ordered. I told them I didn't even get a menu.\n\n2) Ordered a spicy tuna hand roll, which came out promptly but with no wasabi. \n\n3) At the same time, also ordered a tempura cold soba. And waited.\n\n4) And waited some more. After about 30 mins, one of the guy workers asked what else am I waiting for and I told him the zaru soba with tempura. He yells it into the kitchen. Tempura comes out 10 minutes later. Soba comes out another 5 minutes later.  They tasted decent.\n\n6) Another 10 mins pass,and  an older worker (maybe the owner?) apologizes for the long wait and gives me a side salad that is supposed to come with the soba dinner set. \n\n7) Side salad has a jagged sharp piece of plastic over an inch long in there which did go in my mouth. I mention it to one of the waitresses who gives it to the guy at the cashier's area...who just seemed to bury the evidence without a care (throw in the trash and pretend it didn't happen). I told the waitress to give my check and inform the older lady (owner?). She does and the lady comes over and just looks kind of surprised and flustered but unapologetic.  No mention of anything to make up for the bad experience. I promptly left. \n\nNormally, I try to base the review mostly on food taste and minimally on service unless it's a fine restaurant. And maybe it was a one-off but it's pretty hard to be a fan of the restaurant after that experience. I certainly didn't expect to be there for almost an hour for just a cold soba with tempura and a hand roll.", "author": "Bern H."}

I admit, it's hard to eat sushi in the lower price points and expect the same quality as places like Maruya in the city, but sometimes you just cant help but think, I rather pay more and get a little more in terms of satisfaction.\n\nWe ordered a few rolls (Double Salmon, Spicy Juno, Golden Gate, King's roll) and the agadashi tofu. I must say, I think the complimentary miso soup was the best part of the meal, as the soup came piping hot and was extremely flavorful, then it just all went downhill from there. There was absolutely nothing special about any of the rolls, and as hungry as I was, I literally only ate at most 3 pieces. The sushi was missing the fish quality and taste, but rather, each roll was just masked by either the flavor of spicy tuna and other sauces imbedded within. The rolls were fine, but the worst part of the entire meal was that agadashi tofu. WORST I've ever had and I didn't even know that was even possible? First of all, I was so disgusted by the texture, since to create that fried and soft exterior, Kippu used some type of starch that creates a thin clear layer of slime. Second of all, other than the nasty film of stuff, the taste was just not there and the tofu was more of a medium softness tofu rather than soft, which is what agadashi tofu is really supposed to be.\n\nI was really disappointed, considering the fact that one of one co-workers suggested Kippu as one of her usual date night spots.\n\nAlthough the service was spectacular, and the waiters were extremely attentive, I would surely not want to ever return here for another meal again.

Their Kippu has them!  They're tricky in that it's not listed under drinks but deeply entrenched in their Appetizer section.  What's interesting is that their Oyster Shooters are of a red color.  They do have the oyster, sake, roe and scallion but I don't know what makes it red.  Either way, it was rather disappointing.  I don't think I'd go again for their Oyster Shooters.\n\nOkay, Oyster Shooter aside, the atmosphere was really nice, it's at a lower level so when you look out the window you're seeing people's feet but that has a nice feel to it.

Nothing special, though I felt it was a bit interesting, given that the beef/egg and added vegetables were about 50/50 with the rice, something I was not expecting or used to. The edamame was not well mixed with the salt, but it was good. The yakitori was good, no complaints there. The best part, and most redeeming quality of the meal was the tempura ice cream. It was a unique dessert, and I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nI would go to Kippu again just for the desserts, and I look forward to trying a bento and some sushi there in the future.", "author": "Rina R."}

I was here on business from Chicago and thought coming to Japantown for a great sushi dinner would be the smart move.  Sat at the sushi bar with a work colleague and the tip off should have been the lukewarm tap beer that we were served.  Never understand a place that can't get the simple things like a cold beer right.  From there it was downhill.  We tried a couple of rolls and nigiri sushi.  The roll was horribly put together by some young kid that had no business being behind the sushi bar. The roll was practically falling apart. The fish for the nigiri sushi was sliced incorrectly and the nigiri itself was not properly shaped or portioned.  Not to mention no selection of fish to speak of and not very good quality fish.  This was a Friday night!  This is not an authentic Japanese restaurant (I know I am Japanese).  The people making the sushi are not experienced or qualified and quality was terrible.   After a couple of tastes we abandoned this place.  Very disappointing experience.", "author": "John S."}

I had the extreme displeasure of dining here this afternoon with my daughter and a close friend.  We had a terrible experience, a terrible lunch, and terrible service.  \n\nAfter close to an hour of complete and utter disappointment, we all got up and left.  We were disgusted by the experience and the poor service.  \n\nI ordered 2 sushi rolls and I was served quickly.  The rolls were mediocre, and the fish did not taste fresh.  My daughter and my friend ordered Bento Boxes for lunch.  The wait for their lunch was endless - over 45 minutes!!  Unacceptable!! \n\nFrom the start, the service was completely lacking - - our water and hot tea did not arrive for over 30 minutes.  After sitting for 45 minutes, we finally were served cold Miso soup which tasted horrible.  When we were told the lunch entrees were \"ready\" in the kitchen, it was still another 15 minutes before they were brought to the table.  At this point, we had been sitting for an hour.  We decided at this point that we could no longer tolerate the extreme lack of service.  We all three got up to leave.  The manager came over and spoke to us very rudely saying that we should stay to eat the food ordered.  We said we would not, and that we would not pay for it either.  This got the manager very angry, and he screamed at us.  I paid for the Sushi rolls which I had eaten an hour earlier, while my daughter and my friend sat waiting and waiting for the food, which would finally arrive an hour later.  \n\nSan Francisco is filled with amazing restaurants - THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM!! I would never return the restaurant Kippu, and I will tell my family and friends about the awful experience I had today.  I had wanted to take my young daughter out to a nice lunch in the city, which would normally have been a memorable treat for both of us.

I asked for a soy sauce plate but she just pointed to the small space where the wasabi was placed in the middle of the bento and said this was it. But that part of the bento box was DISGUSTINGLY HORRIBLE. The paint of that part of the box seems to be all scratched up! I don't want to put soy sauce in there to dip. Also I asked her for a soysauce plate because the last time I went to to eat, the other waitress just gave me one without asking so I assumed that I will get one this time as well. I just dislike the attitude of the waitress this time. She always seems to look pissed. She only had one expression throughout the whole meal time: semi-angry look.\n\n2) I really wonder about if they do cleaning or not. If you sit near the end half of the restaurant, there are so much bugs flying! My friend and I were basically \"accompanied\" by 5 or more of those bug flying around out food. I would be better off eating a take out outside in the streets than sitting inside. \n\n3) Old dishware. The paint on the bowl of the miso soup was all gone on the brim. The bottom of the bento box looked like it was all scratched up. It all just looks dangerous to eat on. \n\n4) Slow service. My friend and I ordered food earlier than 2 other customers who came in.

The rice was a little rough and didn't taste fresh. The katsu seemed over cooked and had been sitting out for a while. The food was mediocre and their prices do not correspond to their level of precision they put into their sushi. To be very blunt, this sushi was one of the worst yet. And I would not come back unless their sushi has risen to the prices they charge here.", "author": "Michelle T."}

I wish we were told that roll was raw. I still tipped them because I work in a similar field as well and rely on tips sometimes. I hope this review and the other reviews helps them with a little service upgrade.", "author": "Dixie x."}

I probably would come back and try their sashimi next time. Place is not bad. Probably ordered the wrong item. Their lunch special are pretty cheap but again just beware that maybe some of the items are just okay. Overall 3 out of 5 stars.", "author": "J C."}

My goal of this review is for anyone that works there to never provide this kind of experience to other customers.\n\n1. Took close to 20 minutes to get any attention from the two waitresses to take our order. Obviously, this is not the first time anyone has experienced this, but for a restaurant that is less than 300 sq ft it was not acceptable.  I was also ignored twice with clear visual eye contact.  Two other parties had their order taken before mine was; I had a party of 2, the others were of 2 and 4.  \n\n2. After they took my order of 4 dishes - Post Roll, Washington Roll, Unagi Lover, and Ahi Tuna - we waited about 5 minutes for the miso soup which was not an issue.  However, after 30 minutes, the same waitress comes up to ask if we have ordered yet - she was ruffling through her pad to look for my order.  She ends up going back to the cashier to find my order which at that point she tells me it will take 5 minutes to come out.  \n\n3. She tried to compensate by providing edamame which was a nice gesture, however, the edamame was clearly old and had been sitting out in the open for a while.  It was sour (which it should never be), and much too soft like an old banana.  There was no way this can be OK to serve.  \n\n4. The orders started to come in about 5-10 more minutes, all of which was significantly smaller than the picture.  Yes, it will never look identical to the picture, but it just looked like they didn't have enough ingredients to even complete the dish - even the rice on the rolls looked barren.  \n\nI ended up paying about 65 dollars for this meal and it will be the last that I will ever spend there.  My girlfriend and I left hungry and totally dissatisfied with the food and service.  I've had bad restaurant experiences before and I do not have exuberant expectations, but from a customer service / technical support managerial background, this was unacceptable and needs to be improved on all ends.  Even if the quality of the food does not improve, I would continue to visit only if the service was there.  \n\nIf you get the chance to visit this restaurant, I recommend that you think twice about it before spending your hard earned cash.", "author": "Ben L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-08-14", "description": "Went here twice; once for ramen, once for sushi.  \n\nThe miso ramen, I thought, was very low quality stuff.  The flavor of the soup/broth was very weak and bland, and no amount of toppings could balance out the taste.  Not to mention I ate this very late at night when I was very drunk, and I'm rarely picky about food when I'm hammered. I give the ramen 1 star. \n\nThe sushi wasn't bad though.  Compared to most sushi places I've been to, the price was about right for what I got.  The sushi tasted average- not bad, but not terrible either- so no complaints.  And on top of that, the service was relatively quick, and my sushi came out pretty fast.  \n\nFinally, and this isn't all too relevant, but I ordered the cherry blossom sushi, and in the pictures on both the wall and menu it was arranged in a very specific \"cherry blossom\" shaped arrangement.  However, when they brought the sushi out, it was arranged in a typical sushi row.  I dont know, I just feel like if you're gonna call it the Cherry Blossom, and have it pictured as a cherry blossom, well then you'd better damn well SERVE the thing as a CHERRY BLOSSOM!! lol . \n\n3 stars total for that", "author": "Sean S."}

Things starting off good.\n\nNew waitress knew nothing of the menu.  I wasn't asking for explanation of the menu, she just didn't know what I was saying when I ordered the rolls.  Kind of a bummer, she had to look at the menu to know what to write down.  \n\nPre meal, you get miso soup and a salad.  Soup was ok.  Salad had a small bug in it.  Major bummer.  When returning the salad, we didn't even get an apology, instead we got a \"oh hahaha\" kind of like woopsy thing w/o any remorse.\n\nGot the happy hour beer.  Forgot the name of it, but it was fizzy, just as it said on the btl.  Best thing so far.\n\nGot 3 rolls.  To start off, they were all very tiny for the price.  I was then expecting great quality.  Wow, disappointed.  I basically felt they lacked any flavor.  Tuna was blah blah, fried tempura was cold, and I could go on and on.  It basically felt like I was just feeding hunger vs enjoying sushi.\n\nUnfortunately, for a new place, I do not know if they will survive.  You're in Japantown, you should make at least good sushi.  \n\nOverall, will not go back.  Hope they improve on all aspects from service to quality of food.", "author": "Deon C."}

We ordered the Candy Cane, the Incredible and the something with the word Mexican in it. I can't remember the full name of the last one. They were all really good! They were all under the Special Roll section of the menu. The servers were interesting - there were several girls and one guy that seemed to be serving us, and the guy seemed to be the only one who really knew what was going on. The girls didn't seem to know what they were serving us and couldn't really answer questions. They were friendly though :) The miso soup was good. The salad wasn't as good as I've had it at other Japanese restaurants, but it's a pretty basic salad, so it can't get that bad or good. Oh, and they have cool cocktails! I got the Purple Gecko, my fiance got the Mojito Affair and my cousin got the Plumtini. All very good.

We tried a well-reviewed-on-Yelp spot inside Peace Plaza but they had a minimum of $20 a person and we just didn't think we could pull that off (plus, I don't like being told what to spend). So we tried Kippu, even though the reviews were mixed on Yelp. For starters, the restaurant was pretty empty except for table right next to us that looked like it was the owner or something. Our waiter greeted us and promptly spilled water right next to me. No harm done and we weren't bothered by the spill at all. Next thing we know, the owner makes sure we ok and a few minutes later, brings us this fancy dish, \"The Flaming Dragon.\" He tries to tell us what we're supposed it to with it...something about smelling and waiting a minute after the flames die out before we open it...but then just tells us he'll be back to help us. IT was this cool looking thing--something long wrapped in foil with flames literally coming from the bottom. So after it's not on fire he comes over and opens it up...it was a super yummy roll with a bunch of fish I can't remember and some of that delicious crab filling. It was delicious and really cool of him to bring it out to us juts because of a little spill. We ended up getting 3 rolls (The Lion King, The American, and a basic unagi roll) and the chef's choice nigiri and everything was pretty good. I would give the food 3 1/2 stars, but the service bumped my review up to 4! My fam got the green tea ice cream and they enjoyed that as well.

Then she came up and was going to get the plate again but we were like cant you just bring out the tempura (which was missing) in another bowl because we waited one hour and shouldn't my dad be able to eat? And she was liked I pressed the wrong button. Since you work at a restaurant shouldn't you know the menu well enough?

Then I got my lunch, and having eaten in Japanese restaurants all my life, I know they never serve meals together. It comes as it is ready. So I waited but hubby said to eat. After what seemed like much too long, we asked our server about hubby's lunch. She smiled and said she would check. She never came back to us. 5 more minutes and still no lunch. Asked the guy server, who said he would check, but never saw him again. Finally, after I had finished my lunch we asked our server what had happened and why she never came back with either his food or a status. Found out that they had served my husband's lunch to another table! And they didn't even bother to tell us, nor did they offer to give him lunch on the house for their gross oversight. He was so upset he just asked for the bill and we paid and left. We will never go back and it's too bad because we are very loyal to restaurants who admit a mistake and make amends to customer. Glad they can afford to lose customers.", "author": "Janet P."}
