As soon as you walk in its a whole different world of a finely orchestrated dance between the hostess and servers and chefs. Everyone working to please your culinary foodie fetish in every way possible. The ambiance is very elegant and serene yet not cold or pretentious. \nDuring our dinner experience each server knew exactly what came next and all 3 of them worked in harmony providing us with amazing dishes and wine pairing. If you come here go for it get the pairing and all the extras you will not regret it. Its dim lighting and very romantic. There were all kinds of celebrations going on and different occasions of why people were there but all were special occasions no doubt. Its very relaxing and enjoyable from the first bite/sip to the end. \nI was trying very hard to be discreet about taking pictures so I could truly enjoy but my inner Yelpie had to take some pictures. \nIf your a fan of Michelin star restaurants this is the place for you in the bay area and you must come here to enjoy and partake in the master class restaurant that sets itself apart from others. \nEveryone and everything was amazing, from the cutlery, plates, stem wear, to the food. No detail was omitted in making your dinning experience superb. \nEach dish was thought out and planned to perfection along with the wine pairing that went with it. Pictures do not do it justice you must come and see and taste for yourself.   \nAs you go they will box your left over desserts in beautiful boxes and bags. As you walk out they are waiting for you at the door with hot chocolate. We were very happy, tipsy (from all the drinks) and full. \nCant wait to dine there again.", "author": "Theresa G."}

From the get go they excelled at service -- they asked if we'd like a picture taken in front of the restaurant & they allowed us to dine earlier because we showed up 30 minutes before our reservation just to make sure we were on time. They asked both over the phone and in person if we had any food allergies. \n\nEach dish was presented in a timely manner. It did take us from 5:45-9:00pm to finish our meal so don't come here if you are in a rush. I loved every single dish, all of the attention to detail and the atmosphere set a relaxed mood. Most men were not wearing ties or coats. I didn't notice any women wearing super elegant dresses either. So business casual or a nice dress seems appropriate for this restaurant. No one was being overly noisy nor too quiet - just the right balance. \n\nThey made a special menu that had my boyfriend's name on it (which we got to take home at the end) and I'm not sure how often they do this since it was only a table set for two, but they let us dine in the kitchen which was such a delightful treat and first time for both of us. You got to see them calling out orders, the different prep stations and how well organized they are. \n\nThey also served a special desert for the occasion. The bathrooms were beautiful with a candle and hand wrapped towels. When we were leaving they offered us hot chocolate in to go cups which was such a nice way to top off the evening. \n\nWe spent around $850 with tip, but every dollar was worth it! Thank you Quince for making an unforgettable birthday for my boyfriend and a dining occasion we will both never forget!", "author": "Stephanie P."}

In contrast to other Michelin 3's (NY, Chicago), Quince somehow made this extravagant multi-course meal feel like a home-cooked meal from a mom-n-pop store. Just more expensive.\n\nMust try: secret dining opportunities w/the chefs\nMeh: nothing\nMissed: meeting the head chef\n\nFrom the beginning to the end, Quince managed to meet and exceed all dining expectations. I cannot begin to express my absolute gratitude towards the servers as well as the chefs who meticulously crafted every single item. Given that the menus change seasonally, I do not think that given a detailed description of my meal would be relatable to my readers, but here are some advice:\n\n1. Celebrate a special occasion and let the staff know\n2. Get the wine pairing, the pours are very generous and can be shared\n3. The staff makes everything personal and relatable, and a special shout-out to the waiter, Tom, who made such amazing and well-timed comments throughout the dinner.\n4. Do not be embarrassed to ask for seconds (mostly bread), as the staff is more than happy to cater to your every need.\n5. The cocktails are a must try, even if you get the wine pairing, as the glass and crystal in which the amazing concoctions are poured in are extraordinary by themselves.\n\nAt the end of the day, this was by far one of the best dining (and most expensive) experiences I've had this year. Maybe it's taking picture with the sous chef, or seeing a huge truffle being lathered onto our pasta dish, this is an amazing experience that should not be missed. \n\n5 stars all around!", "author": "Xiao Z."}

I mean, I love dining out and especially love high end restaurants. Quince definitely had me impressed and intimidated at the same time. You just feel the luxury of their property the minute you step in and are greeted. I don't even think I touched the door when I arrived because someone was right there to open it for me.  I felt I really had to be on top of my etiquette game.  \n\nI arrived a little early and was welcomed to wait in the lounge for my dinner partner.  I had a wonderful cocktail to start.  Upon my partner's arrival, we were quickly seated at our table and greeted by our servers.  I knew I was in for a crazy special meal when the first utensil was a tweezer for our canap\u00e9 assortment.  It was details like that, knowing exactly what to use to serve each dish, and how to serve each dish so that it could be enjoyed immensely by the guest, that really made Quince a joy to dine at.  \n\nThe attention to detail and ability to serve an outstanding meal while still accommodating special requests is what I love about this place.  The menu had a birthday greeting at the top, the servers, including the bartender, were aware of the allergies we noted in the reservation and were careful to note what to avoid, and even when we left, the thoughtfulness to provide a warm cup of hot chocolate for me and hot tea for my partner who has a chocolate allergy as we left that night just made you feel extremely special and grateful for the experience to dine at Quince.  \n\nThis isn't a place I will be able to frequent often, but I will absolutely keep it in mind for very special occasions and make sure to recommend to people looking for a very special dining experience in San Francisco.

There were 2 other tables so the setting was very intimate. The servers were very attentive, of course. \n\nThe menu featured mainly white asparagus and our server told us the story behind it and how it is grown.

I couldn't wrap my head around it.\nI know it's popular and all, but there's a thing as too much butter. I also saw a lot of that green sauce on every dish.

Quince has been on my bucket list for quite a while now, and once I saw there were reservations available just a few days prior to my birthday, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to splurge in a nice meal prepared by Michael Tusk!\n\nDriving into the city on a weeknight was a pain, and trying to find parking was even more chaotic, but luckily enough made it in time for our reservation at 6:30 PM.  \n\nAfter being given a quick introduction of Quince by Kei, we were given the option with their special menu of the night (which included white truffle sprinkled on every dish) or their prix fixe tasting menu.  We opted with the prix fixe tasting menu, and our night kicked off with with Canape, or otherwise known as hors d'\u0153uvre.\n\nThe next 3 and a half hours was pure nirvana.

The notable highlights for me were:\n- Pumpkin pie with caviar...such a creative dish that maximized the full flavoring of the caviar.  \n- Black cod wrapped with ruby beet, I know it sounds a bit odd but it complemented the cod perfectly!\n- Lobster Garganelli was packed with fresh lobster meat with the mushrooms stuffed inside the egg-based pasta.\n- Farm egg...this was just...WOW.  Our socks were completely knocked off with this one (figuratively).  \n- The \"miss\" for us was the venison...there was just something about the texture about it that was rough and gamey.\n\nOnce all the main courses came out, Quince was kind enough to bring a birthday tart cake to share as well as a smorgasbord of small delicacies to try from the dessert cart.

We were shown to our table and my menu was personalized, saying \"Congratulations, Ziyan!\" across the top. Throughout dinner, the entire staff was incredibly professional but also not too stuffy. We're not usually ones to drop $800 on a dinner and could easily have felt out of place at Quince, but instead we felt very welcomed. \n\nRESERVATIONS: I made the reservation online exactly 90 days in advance for 6pm on a Saturday. \n\nTHE FOOD: See my photos for details! The menu must change all the time. The presentation was always exquisite, and it seems every piece of dinnerware is custom made for the dish.

Quince has a great atmosphere, excellent service, and really good food. We liked it better than Coi but thought Mourad was comparably fun (and much cheaper). Quince was about $1000 after tax and tip for both of us (2x tasting menu, 1x $55 wagyu beef supplement, 1x $125 wine tasting w/half pours, a couple drinks).\n\nThe food was presented and described well, and the meal had a generous and \"homey\" vibe. My favorite part was the two pasta courses. The garganelli, in particular, was borderline transcendent. Most courses were good or very good and both of us were full at the end of the meal.\n\nUnfortunately there were also two courses I didn't care for. I really didn't like the lamb and am glad we replaced one of our lamb dishes with the wagyu beef supplement, which was excellent.

By and large, it deserves that rating. My husband and I dined there for our anniversary, and they were prepared with a menu with our names on it as well as a note wishing us a happy anniversary. They also set us down in the loveseat so that we could snuggle while dining. If you like to sit next to your significant other as opposed to across from them, ask for the loveseat booth in your reservation!\n\nIf you go to Quince, you will be graced by the presence of true professionals in a romantic setting. But you will absolutely pay for it. Unfortunately, there is no real way to get around forking out the price of a full ten-course tasting menu. One way I like to afford to experience Michelin star restaurants is to not opt for the tasting menu or wine list. Here though, the 10-course tasting menu is the only choice you have. And that is expensive AF. For two people dining on the full testing menu and one of them pairing it with wine, you will pay an arm and a leg.\n\nFor the price alone and the fact that there is no real way to reduce the menu, I am not sure I would recommend Quince. But if you are rich AF and are willing to get past that, you will experience some highly advanced cooking techniques, delicious food, and in-season flavors. \n\nThe creativity of the chefs at Quince is outstanding. Some of the highlights of our tasting menu were: fish poached in a green broth before our very eyes; a \"garden\" with rare mushrooms and locally grown potatoes; a soup served in a literal ice bowl; squab which is really just a fancy name for pigeon; fresh, warm bread of multiple varieties; an apple, vanilla bean, and rum dessert; and some of the best tasting and smoothest wine I have ever had in my life. Quince truly titillated my taste buds!\n\nBut, unfortunately, I did not feel that I had eaten that much \"food\" at the conclusion of my meal (I kind of stuffed myself with bread to fill my stomach, lol). Of course, it was a tasting menu, but I left barely satiated (and also drunk from the wine pairings). I wish there had been more food on each plate considering the price. The plates overall, while artfully and beautifully crafted, were rather empty looking. I am not sure I'd return, but that doesn't mean I don't recommend this restaurant.

The tasting menu was just amazing:\n\n(1). Starters include Canap\u00e9, English peas, Tsar Nicoulai Caviar with asparagus and Brassica \"Crudo E Cotto\" (raw and cooked). What struck me during this part of the meal were the exceptional vegetables (and I am really a big fan of meat). \n(2).  The next section of the meal involved white asparagus several ways.  I loved the soup and the tea.\n(3).  Black cod was an excellent fish dish and the kale chip on top was just exquisite. \n(4).  Garganelli including lobster, black trumpet mushroom and spring onion.  In terms of a singular dish, this was my favorite.\n(5).  \"Beet Wellington\" - it's a really surprising combination. \n(6).  The main protein was milk fed lamb including shoulder, belly, loin and chop. \n(7).  Desserts include kiwi with coconut (too much coconut for my taste), strawberry with fromage blanc and meringue (this was stellar), chocolate cake and madeleines. The chocolates and confections came out in a cart. It's a real beautiful sight. \n\nHospitality was just outstanding and even though I did not have the wine pairing, the bartender created non-alcoholic beverages that paired perfectly with the dishes.  The attention to detail is noteworthy, especially with the plates and the utensils. Quince also did something special for me - they set a table for me in the kitchen during my pasta portion. It was incredible - the kitchen was a well oiled machine with several dedicated stations and the Chef in charge signed my menu.  Ambiance was just perfect - it's elegant and classic.  I also got treats on my way out.  Highly, highly recommended.  I can't wait to come back.", "author": "Andrew S."}

Service was fantastic at every step.  They called a week in advance to ask about dietary restrictions.  We received a menu with a happy birthday greeting for her printed on it.  Each course arrived at the appropriate time.  Wait staff were all very friendly and knowledgable about the food, attentive but not overly so.  On the way out the door, I was handed a hot chocolate and my girlfriend--who had reported a chocolate intolerance--received a chai tea.\n\nAmbience was elegant and understated in dark tones.  Music was quiet and varied (including some hip hop!).  Dining room was moderately private, with other parties seated close by.\n\nFood was delicious.  Every bite had a unique flavor.  But some entrees were little more than one bite.  I anticipated small portion size but a couple of these were laughably so.  Three thumbnail-sized paper-thin chips of something delicious might have been twice that many.  The meat entree was five bitesize pieces of lamb.  My favorite dish of the evening was a wonderful cold tomato soup, served creatively in frozen ice bowls.  Though the bowls were small, they could have easily held double the minuscule amount we received.  Wanting to ask for another two ounces of soup made me feel like Oliver Twist.\n\nI spent over $1,000 with tip and valet parking and could have easily spent more.  We purchased the $85 caviar upgrade but ordered only a half-bottle of wine and no aperitifs.  I left the restaurant a bit hungry, which was a bit disappointing.  I recommend Quince for its high-level experience as long as diners know what to expect.  My five-foot-two girlfriend left sated.  Six-foot-plus males with big appetites, like me, should have a little snack before dinner.", "author": "Hurds N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-01", "description": "SUMMARY\nWe booked the newly-minted 3-Michelin Quince as\nthe second dinner to celebrate wedding anniversary #11.  It was surprisingly full on a Monday night!  Overall the full tasting menu (easily 15 courses or so if you include all the desserts) was outstanding.  The chef is awesome at seafood and veggies, and he uses a variety of mushrooms in each dish.  Flavors were really balanced.  The meats were good, but not great (lamb can use touch more seasoning while rib eye a tad chewy).  Desserts and overall service and attentiveness were tops.  So happy to rate 5 stars on overall basis.  You had better come hungry since you will get stuffed!  I would rank Quince below Joel Robuchon (Vegas) and Benu (SF), but above Saison (SF) and French Laundry (Yountville) among the 3-Michelin dinners we've had so far.  Unlike the nearby 2-Michelin Coi, you definitely won't leave Quince hungry!\n\nFAVORITE DISHES\nThe seafood items were by far our favorite.\nLobster Garginelli: Perfectly poached lobster tail with al-dente pasta stuffed with more lobster.  Then some black cabbage and black trumpet shrooms to balance it all.\nHalibut: This was my favorite - Moist, seasoned fish topped with miso bitter, chanterelles, pickled ramps, and fiddlehead fern.  \nDungeness Crab: They had that combo of Dover Sole and Crab (similar to Navio last night!), but the flavor profile is lighter with almonds, strawberries, and asparagus.\n\nINTERESTING DISHES\nWhite Asparagus: It arrived in a boiling pot and was cooked to order. Super tender and sweet, and that's before they pour Vin Jaune (French Yellow Wine) with Morels!  To make it more interesting, they served some of the poaching liquid with Yuzu to make a salty, citrusy tea.\nAgnolottini: Little, pillow-shaped pasta stuffed with squab and served with fava beans, but the weird thing was this hollowed-out rolling pin with six little pieces of suckling pig!  Good, but Strange!\nSpringtime in Bollinas: This is a hybrid salad made of snails(?!), some microgreens, sunflower seeds, then this refreshing nettle soup.  It was like drinking/eating a garden, with the snails included.\n\nDESSERTS\nDeserts were truly epic.  Standard is their Smoked Caramel Strawberry and Meringue along with candy cart where you pick your poison.  For our anniversary, they offered this special Devil Food Cake that was super light and virtually melt-in-your mouth.  Deceptively light and decadent at the same time!  I don't recall ever having such a moist and creamy cake.  After paying the bill, they offer another can of lemon-thyme cookies and two cups of hot chocolate on the way out.\n\nDefinitely recommend Quince if you like seafood,\nveggies (especially mushrooms), and are willing to be indulged by multiple rounds of desserts.  Our server, Milton was superb and funny; he made our dinner memorable.  He even reminds me of actor Eugene Levy a bit (the Dad from the American Pie movies).", "author": "Daniel C."}

Tasting menus are offered in the dining room, and you can order \u00e0 la carte in the salon. When dining at a Michelin star restaurant, I think it's almost always preferable to go with the tasting menu, particularly if it is your first visit. A tasting menu allows you to clearly see the chef's vision for flavor pairings and overall flow of the courses. Quince's tasting menu for Winter 2016-2017 was superb -- each course was unique, meticulous, and in some cases whimsical. One dish, highlighting the truffle, came out served along with an iPad playing a video of a dog hunting for truffles. We also purchased the truffle supplements and they were fantastic.

Well, today was our fifth attempt and it was a failure once again. It's to the point that I don't want to come back to quince any more and so I decided to update my review. \n\nA couple of months ago I called to see how we can join the bar. I was told that I need to call the restaurant the day of and see if their are any seats available. I have called so many times ( weekdays or weekends) and even though there were seats available and I was there at 5:30 right when they open, they refused to offer me a seat! As the seats are \"reserved\"! So how do other people get these bar seats \" reserved\" that I can't? \n\nNo one seems to care to want to give me an answer. The only answer I get each time is that the bar seats are on a first come first served basis.Well, I AM one of the first guests to step into your restaurant right when you open! \n\nIt appears to me that quince only wants the guests to try their tasting menu and limit the bar, period. Or they keep trying to send me to their sister restaurant next door which is always packed. I also can't find anything to eat there since nothing is gluten free.

Quince certainly also did a good job in seafood - that small piece of king crab with caviar on top, tenderly cooked while still maintained its rudimentary freshness.

This is definitely the most sophisticated meal in my life. There's typically 2 menus, 1 lighter seasonal menu with fewer courses and the full Quince menu. We wanted the full experience and chose the Quince menu. I had mentioned it was my parents 30th wedding anniversary and the staff went above and beyond to make it very special. There were a total of 11 courses but it was like a seamless orchestra. We went at 6pm and it was eerily silent with a few older people at some tables. It felt a bit oppressed but as more parties trickled in and the evening went on the mood lightened up a bit. I'm going to write about my personal highlights because other people have talked to death about the amazing menu. I loved how each course was so meticulously planned out, frequently the cutlery changed, as the plates of course did too and it was like a theme for each. The delicious salmon came in a modern Japanese-esque metal sheet dish, delicate hand pressed ravioli came in a french-y dish, etc. We had more than the 14 courses, I think we had 2-3 extra \"gifts\" from the chef. My favorite courses were the abalone which was served sizzling off a snow, and the mushroom tortelli with truffle shavings. Also, so basic but the bread was also the best bread I've ever had. They had sourdough, one with pesto and cheese and the last with olive.  \n\nFor the first dessert course they actually pranked us and brought out ENORMOUS meringue covers and were watching for our reaction. Considering how petite and beautiful everything was we were expecting something delicate and enjoyed the playfulness. That was my favorite dessert though, the smoked caramel was incredible. The finale included a dessert cart to fix any craving you could have, fruity, pastry, chocolate, nougat, etc. We ended up getting one of each and shared. The stand outs were the blueberry lemon tarts, and the fruit jellies. \n\nWe ended up parting with a cup of hot cocoa to go for each of us (delicious and incredibly thick with a touch of cinnamon) and a gorgeous, thoughtful gift from them, a set of mother of pearl caviar spoons tied with ribbon and rosemary. They also bring out your copy of the menu since I imagine most are customized to the party. Ours had my parents name on it and their celebration which was sweet. \n\nOverall, a 5 star experience, I think it's a fun 3 star michelin experience, more playful than you'd expect. I highly recommend it.", "author": "Amy K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-05-30", "description": "\"With great power comes great responsibility.\"  - Ben Parker.  Or Voltaire.\n\nWhen a restaurant finally achieves that coveted third Michelin star, there comes a set of expectations that come with it.  The Michelin Guide states a 3 star joint boasts \"exceptional cuisine.  Worth a special journey.\" \n\nWith that in mind, when I managed to secure a table at Quince, I chose to make a special journey for the \"exceptional cuisine.\"  Travelling down from Oregon, I came to SF just for this meal (and Benu the next night).  \n\nI was so disappointed. \n\nThe ambiance at Quince is quite nice.  Beautiful flowers and artwork provide multiple points of interest in the room.  The linens are crisp and pressed and the flatware and glassware are superbly elegant.  The lighting is dark and moody and intimate.  Overall, the decor was a bit busy and \"old fashioned\" in terms of the style of the room, but I could see the appeal for someone who's less militaristic about modern decor than myself. \n\nThe service is attentive and friendly without being overbearing.  My water glass never ran dry and my table was always promptly cleared of spent dishes.  The waiters did a lovely job describing the food, but some of the clunkier dishes could have benefited from a bit more of a tutorial on how to eat them. \n\nAt this point, you're probably asking yourself: \"Self?  if things at Quince are so nice, why only 3 stars?\"\nGirl, I'm just getting started. . .\n\nFirstly, the pacing of the dishes was unacceptably slow.  Pacing is one of those things that you only notice when it's off, and this was off in a big way.  Now, I'm a fast eater.  I can snarf down an entire Chipotle burrito in somewhere around 6-7 minutes; so I promise that my eating was not the limiting reagent in this reaction. \n \nNormally a meal like Quince should take 2.5-3 hours, but this took over 4 hours to complete.    I timed over 20 minutes between clearing off a plate and bringing out the next dish on at least two occasions.  As the evening drug on and on, I found myself repeatedly hungry and cranky as I waited for the next course; by around 1130 as the meal was still slogging along, I was exhausted and just begging for us to wrap things up so I could go to bed.  \n\nAdditionally, they tried to upsell us on three items in the menu.  A choice for a caviar upgrade and a foie course at the beginning of the meal, and a cheese course at the end.  We're paying over $800 for this dinner, either give us the fancy caviar, foie, and cheese, or don't mention it at all.  I hate mid meal upsells b/c it inserts a transactional element to a meal that really detracts from the experience. \n\nNext, as far as the food itself, it was much sound and fury signifying nothing.  Now don't get me wrong, nothing was BAD.  The cook on my proteins were spot on.  There were several lovely sauces.  There was a light and floral sorbet with candied flower petals which was fantastic; but overall, the food was underwhelming as over and over Quince delivered beautiful and complicated presentations that were ultimately nothing special.  \n\nA tower of glass holding three caviar dishes was presented with much fanfare, but two of them were overly complicated and completely lost the caviar in the accouterments.  A crab dish with an entire platoon of garnishes but only one small piece of crab proved very confusing to eat (how do I assemble this bite?).  A giant glass bucket holding a single spear of white asparagus was bizarre and clunky and unnecessarily showy.   A meringue \"lid\" to another dessert which was hidden underneath grossed me out (how many other people had been touching that meringue lid which is now touching my food?).  Multiple dishes looked nice to the eye, but were just lackluster when it came to taste. \n\nFinally, I'm a big believer in the concept of the Hero Dish.  If a meal is overall solidly executed and you can get that ONE dish that just slays, the overall memory of the meal will be very positive (a la Beyonce showing up and crushing it at Coldplay's Superbowl performance).  Now a Hero Dish can't save a bad dinner, and you can certainly have a good meal without a Hero; but I think having an *amazing* meal often hinges on having that Hero Dish. All of my favorite meals have had a Hero.  Le Bernadin had steak tartare w caviar.  Eleven Madison Park had their spin on Eggs Benedict.  Benu had fois gras xiao long bao AND a caviar/urchin/sushi rice epiphany (two heroes!  It's like the Justice League over at Benu).  Quince had no hero.  Quince didn't even have a sidekick.  48 hours after my dinner there, I can't recall any dishes without resorting to the photos I took of the dinner. \n\nI think my favorite thing all night was the hot cocoa they give you at the end of the night.  Not because it was delicious (it was too rich and too sweet), but because it meant I could finally go the hell to bed.", "author": "Shaun L."}

What's better than a 3 michelin star restaurant?\n\nI tried to keep my expectations reasonable since every time I'm overly excited about dining somewhere, I leave disappointed. The thing is, I think if I came to Quince with ridiculously high expectations, I would've left completely satisfied. \n\nI was honestly blown away by the food at Quince. Dish after dish it was back and forth of OOH's and AHH's. The \"A Dog in Search of Gold\" presentation was out of this world, and super cute. My least favorite of the night was the lobster, which was lacking flavor in my opinion. Presentation, however, was beautiful. My favorites were the soup and the pasta with white truffles served in a Quince box.\n\nThe service was amazing here and surprisingly unpretentious. Sadly, I was hungover beyond belief from the night before so I was unable to have the wine pairing with my meal. Our servers were very understanding of that and even joked about it with me (several times throughout the meal, which made me feel so comfortable).\n\nReal people. Real food. Simply amazing.\n\nP.S.

Quince personalized 2 menus for me, in gold print, with my name, listing the night's menu!  The service was absolutely perfect.  You won't have to ask for anything because they anticipate what your needs are before you even know yourself.  The ambiance was even more impressive, flowers by Chestnut and Vine, paintings as big as the room, and the lighting was just enough to take in the beauty around.  Every plate was a work of art and an explosion of flavor that was all at once delicate and bold.  Work with the restaurant as the price for this level of detail can be astronomical.\n\nOverall, an absolutely classy restaurant from the moment I stepped in to the moment I left the premise.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-11-13", "description": "Quince had been on my \"list\" for quite some time and it shot straight to the top when it earned its third Michelin Star. I made a reservation the day of the announcement for dinner a week away and held my breath that the price wouldn't increase before then. While valet parking is offered, we were able to find street parking nearby easily.\n\nI hadn't done much research about the restaurant in advance and didn't know what the experience would be like. Quince turned out to be more formal than any restaurant I've been to in the Bay Area. I don't think I've ever seen so many suits in one place in SF. The restaurant is an area with law firms and other \"serious\" businesses and there were clearly clients who were there for business dinners. Even the couple next to us who were on a date were talking about index funds. My date and I dressed the part but I really wish this fine dining experience wouldn't have felt so formal and stuffy. \n\nMy date picked out a bottle of oaked California Chardonnay for our meal and it paired well with most of the dishes. One of his pet peeves is when expensive restaurants try to upsell you on add-ons and Quince definitely did that with both the caviar selection as well as shaved white truffles. I'm glad we passed on both.\n\nThe meal started with canap\u00e9s and my favorite were the mini cheese puffs. \n\nThe first real course was called Freshly Dug Potatoes and it was served on an uneven plate to simulate the rocks and dirt in the ground. It reminded me of the slow feeder bowl I use to encourage my dog to eat his dinner more slowly. The potatoes were lightly seasoned and were served with fine crumbs. Cute creation but not really special. \n\nNext up were Monterey Bay Abalone served in a long and narrow plate with forceps. The presentation was lovely but completely impractical for food consumption. This was another average tasting dish.\n\nOur next course was the regular Tsai Nicoulai Caviar with King Crab, Heart of Palm, and Mandarin. If I hadn't gone to Saison a few weeks prior and had their life-changing caviar, I might have enjoyed this dish more. A second preparation of caviar was presented in a roll form and it was crunchy and flavorful. Other than the cheese puffs, this was the standout so far.\n\nSoon, we were served three types of housemade bread, which were all excellent. \n\nThe dish that followed was a visually stunning L'uovo with White Fuseau Sunchoke and Chanterelle Mushroom. I was starting to get excited about the meal but we were then served what I will describe as wilted cabbage. Not really my style for this type of dinner.\n\nAfter the lackluster cabbage was the incredible Fagottini Alla Fonduta served with shaved white truffle. I found it interesting that the waiter had tried to upsell us shaved white truffle at the beginning of the meal but failed to mention that one of the courses already featured this ingredient. This pasta dish was served in a wooden \"Quince\" box. While the presentation was nice, it was not easy to eat out of the bowl inside a box.\n\nThis was followed by another great pasta dish; this time it was Tortelli with Porcini Mushrooms. The lightly fried herb leave on top was a great touch.\n\nThe meal had very little red meat and the main course consisted of Venison with parsnip, salsify, and currant. It looked better than it tasted. And that concluded the savory courses.\n\nNext up were the desserts. The first was a refreshing Meyer Lemon cold dessert with huckleberry and lemon thyme. I really loved the tartness in this dessert. The other dessert had Pine Nuts, Pomegranate, and Persimmon. It was sweeter with a sheet of white chocolate.  We were very full at this point and the Mignardises cart came around. There were many chocolates and confections to choose from and I tried six different types while my date was much more disciplined and only had two. The best item I had was the rum cake.\n\nThis concluded our three hour long dinner experience. There were a few highlights but most of the courses were not that memorable. Quince may have gotten its third Michelin Star but the overall experience is not iconic like at The French Laundry, not unique like Benu, and not creative and comfortable like Saison. It was just ok.", "author": "Yi Z."}

We were pretty excited to dine there since we have never been to a 3 Michelin star restaurant. We made our reservation 3 weeks in advance and were able to get a 8:30pm slot on a Friday night. I didn't give Quince 5 stars because I was expecting to be more impressed since it has 3 Michelin stars. Overall the food was great, and the service was superb. I really appreciated the presentation and intricacy of each dish. It truly brings your dining experience to another level. I like how they are quite flexible with the menu. They allow adjustments to the menu if you have dietary restrictions, so my friend was able to substitute the lamb dish for fish since she doesn't eat lamb. The only major complaint I have is that the wait time between courses was too long. For a 12 course meal, our dinner lasted over 3 hours. The portion of food for each course was pretty small, but we were very full by the end of the night because it took so long.\n\nI loved the plating of every dish; it was just so entertaining to look at. My favorites were canape, white asparagus, and garganelli. The canape was cute small bites. I liked the warm pastry puffs with cheese inside and the croquette the most. They were just fun to eat, and I loved it when the cheese exploded in my mouth. The white asparagus was something I had never eaten before, and the way the prepared it was very interesting. They brought out a huge glass container of yuzu marinate where the asparagus was soaking in all the flavors. The waiter picked out the asparagus and topped it with a sauce made with vin jaune and morel mushrooms. The asparagus was very tender and rich in flavors. The left over yuzu marinate was made into tea, and it had an intense savory and sweet yuzu flavor along with a mild citrus taste. It was the most unique tea I had ever had! Another dish I really enjoyed was the garganelli, which had lobster meat wrapped in it. The texture of the pasta was perfect, and it was topped with foam that actually had a taste. I didn't like one of the desserts but definitely enjoyed the variety of desserts the dessert cart offered and ended up getting one of each!\n\nI would recommend dinning at Quince. I had a positive experience overall, and the price is very reasonable for a 3 star restaurant in SF.", "author": "Linda W."}

Everything that came out was beautiful and delicious and the meal was planned to take you to that exact point of wanting more but not being able to go on. We opted into a pricey wine pairing but arguably worth it, in that it included wines we had never tried before presented with patient explanation that were spot on for each dish.\n\nAdjustments are made real time for allergies, but all the changes were seamless. Altered dishes seemed as well considered and delicious.  The meal was thoughtful and service was near perfect.  The food quality was excellent.

Some dishes were (of course) very excellent, some dishes were just A-OK. The service was excellent. I don't think I need to harp on the food much, as people who are more \"foodie\" than me can provide their feedback. All I can say is, at this price range, food isn't going to taste bad. \n\nThe only thing I want to point out in this review is that the portion size is way too big! You may think that this is a great thing, and who can complain about having too much food at $200+ per person. Well, it takes away the elegance and classiness of the restaurant, not to mention the discomfort of walking away feeling way too full. High-end restaurants with tasting menus should leave you full, but not stuffed; you should have the slight sensation of \"wanting more.\" Not, \"I'm not coming back for a LONG time.\" \n\nI've felt very full at other high-end restaurants, but Quince was over-the-top! Maybe they should have different portion sizes for people to choose from? They told me that the smaller menu serves the same amount of food, just less variety than the bigger menu.

You don't exactly know what they will be serving on their menu as it changes seasonally/regularly. It is like a surprise every single time. Walking in here gives me the vibe of dinning in a dark room, kind of mysterious but yet you feel relaxed. In every corse of the meal, the server would prepare your food for you and your friends at the same time. I find that impressive sometimes because they have to serve all the dishes at the same time. They tell you the name of the dish and described the dish in bits of details which you find it interesting sometimes. If you ever feel curious about what you are eating, you are more than welcome to ask them- they are passionate in what they do and they will do whatever to have their customers satisfied.\n\nMy favorite part of the course would be the dessert cart.

Overall a great experience, and for the standard (\"Quince\") tasting menu starting at $220, I'd say it's one of the better valued 3 Michelin star restaurants around the Bay. Price for 2 people without wine pairing + 20% tip + tax + additional $40 foie gras dish set us back about $675. \n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n- Reservations were easy to make - We were able to book a 9pm Saturday dinner time (ok it's a tad late, i guess lol) 5 days before. \n- Service (minus the mistake I noted below) was good, as expected\n^ part of that - I really liked the menu with our names and celebratory purpose on it. A customer care rep called us a day before to confirm the spelling of our names.\n- Kitchen tour with free picture and alcoholic sorbet snacks...We thought we were special, but apparently it's something they offer every table, which is cool. Transparency and added value is always cool.\n- We got a complimentary anniversary mini cake added to our dessert line up :))) \n- Half of the dishes were mind-blowing (see pictures for more details)\n\nTHE MEH:\n\n*** Dropped dish (-.5 stars*)? I don't blame this on the waiter at all, as the dishes he delivered were stacked in an odd way... but when he did make it to my side of the table, a tier of the caviar fell from the structure and pieces of sauce and food fell onto my table, chair, and dress... The waiter fumbled, quickly apologized, picked up the dish, and ran into the kitchen to recover a new one... 5 minutes later he came back and gave me a towel and asked if any got on me. Not the experience I was hoping for my first 3 Michelin star restaurant - I recommend more ergonomically designed dishes for the waiters. What's the point of it being pretty/edgy when incidents like these are going to happen.\n***Horrible draft (-.5 stars*) - It was raining the day we came, and as a result a lot of wind was blowing around. Quince doesn't have double interior doors (not sure what they're called), so when someone leaves or enters, it would send a cold draft into the restaurant... We sat close to the door, and I was rubbing my arm and pretty much freezing the entire time in my dress. Mentioned this to the waiters, but there's not much they could do besides offer me my coat.\n*** The dishes were 50/50 to me (-.5 stars*)- I'd like most, if not all of my dishes to taste good during expensive dinners - wouldn't you? I guess the search continues for a better 3 mich. \n*** Limited bathroom access, there are two gender-neutral bathrooms at the end of their hall. There was a 4 person line when I went to use it... \n***They didn't have the dessert cart during our night :(((( ... We got some desserts at the end (see pictures), but I was really looking forward to being overwhelmed by the cart...it would have ended the night out nicely. In the future, I guess you should call in advance to see if they have it because if I knew they didn't have it that day, I'd personally reconsider.\n\n\nTaking Quince for everything that it and our wallet claims it to be, I have to give it 3.5 stars - rounded up to 4 on Yelp.. It'll be a long while until I consider coming back.", "author": "Vy T."}

Quince was our first foray into this and we chose it to celebrate our wedding anniversary.\n\nWe had a great time.  The service was very good and certainly within expectation of a restaurant of this caliber.  There were small aspects of the service that could have been better but nothing that was bothersome.  \n\nSo why did I rate only 3-stars when we had a great time?  \n\nFrankly it could have been 2 stars because although the food was good it was no where near the level it should be for the Michelin rating or the price.  A Yelp reviewer mentioned somewhere that the French Laundry makes this place seem like a burger joint... and it's kind of true.  The trappings of a very fine restaurant are there but the food is pretty darn middling for the reputation of the restaurant and the rating. \n\nOther than the caviar (which doesn't really count) there was only one dish that I felt was deserving of 2 Michelin stars, and that was what the chef is known for - pasta.  Every dish should be exceptional or near so, and that was very much not the case. \n\nThe dessert courses were shamefully below par.  At the risk of sounding snooty the mignardises were a joke.\n\nBut again, we had a great time.  The price for the food though is grossly distorted and I did leave thinking I had overspent.  I don't ever remember that feeling at a Michelin starred restaurant previous to Quince.  \n\nMany will refute me by giving five stars but on that particular night - there is no freakin' way the food was at the level it should be for the rating.  The service - yes.  The ambiance - yes.  The plating - 100%.  The food on the beautiful plate... below the set standard.", "author": "Josh D."}

The food itself was immaculate but a bit too earthbound to wow me.\n\nWhereas a lot of high gastro-temples lean more towards rare seafood and A++ grade meat ingredients, the most notable flavor profiles here were earthy and country comfort: cheese, mushrooms, small cuts of smokey meats, grains, pasta, squash, all of it heightened by delicate dabs of truffles and caviar. The whole feeling is very autumnal, like a fall harvest for a medieval king in a landlocked country. It felt more traditional rather than virtuosic. The couple seated next to us repeatedly said they much prefer this to a good seafood meal, so I'm willing to concede that rustic landfare just isn't my thing.\n\nMy favorite bite was oddly the frog's leg tempura amuse bouche in the beginning, followed by the lobster garganelle. The lobster was probably the single most springy, succulent bite of lobster I have ever enjoyed. I was hoping there were more moments like this, but the cheese-and-grains leanings were much more to the fore than any succulent fish or flesh or meats. It made the price tag seem a little steep at the end, when Cotogna next door already excels at so many of these same grainy flavor notes.\n\nThe waitstaff knew it was an anniversary and never failed to make my date and I feel welcomed and attended to. At the end, they sent us off with cups of hot chocolates. We walked away smiling from the warmth of the people. I have to give really high plaudits for that -- it's a lovingly wrought feasting temple, and I want so very much for everyone to succeed here, but the price was hard to sleep on relative to the food, which is a bit of a pity, I think.", "author": "Ken H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-27", "description": "The food here is impeccable! Been trying to secure a reservation at the French Laundry for years and have not been successful at it. So we tried Quince. It was our anniversary and the menu had our names on it. Cool! The ambiance is truly formal and it was worth making reservations as early as 5:30 because the 12-course dinner was a delightful 4-hr occasion, not kidding! French cuisine has small servings but because it is cooked with the right technique and under the right conditions, you will want to savor every bite, and have this experience before your last breath. :-)\n\nThe 12-course meal was worth every bite and we added the foie gras and pasta (with white truffles) specials. They had a delivery of white Alba truffles that morning and they brought a \"giant\" size white truffle inside a glass right on our table. They shaved pieces of the truffle over the pasta. Oh man, that was the most exciting part of the evening! I am truly a down-to-earth kinda person and something like this makes me feel like I am in heaven! At that point, I forgot about how much this dinner would cost later. \n\nThe individual courses were delivered one at a time, we did not feel rushed. Every dish is just simply too good for words but one big word I would use to describe the food is that: IT IS THE BOMB!!!! I realized that when meat, vegetable or fruit is prepared and cooked with the right techniques and process, the flavor is just out of this world- it was that good!!! Each had a creative and artistic presentation. What amazed me the most is the duck meat. I cooked duck once a long time ago and burned it because it was fatty. This one isn't. It was tender, moist and not fatty at all. I forgot what technique they used but whatever it was, it worked. The foie gras was one of the best that I had. When our orders were taken, they had asked about food allergies. When I mentioned that I have seafood allergies, they were happy to substitute items that I can tolerate. \n\nService was excellent! We felt like we had our own waiter. Milton was the best. He folded my napkin when I left the table to use the ladies' room. Places like this are so polished and elevated to the highest quality that you feel like walking in heaven. After dinner, Stephen and Milton led us to a a tour of the kitchen and drink a glass of spritzer. We met the chefs and saw their hands prepare those attractive dishes with very delicate, yet skillful craftmanship. I could watch them cook and plate all day!\n\nWe took home desserts. It was a cart full of choices. Each candy or pastry is prepared everyday, by the chefs. Was happy to take 2 boxes home and rekindle this experience the next day. I remember giggling and making oohs and yummm sounds each time a plate arrived at the table, and wishing how I would have seconds of everything. We felt like little kids but we had so much fun! Milton made us feel at ease of being in a nice fancy place like Quince. \n\nOverall, the experience is unforgettable. I realized that places like French Laundry, can be overrated, not only that it's tough getting a reservation but the idea that is being presented by similar French cuisines is the right way of preparing and serving food. You really get your money's worth here.  If you feel the itch for French laundry but cannot get a reservation, go to Quince. Food is meant to be enjoyed by your palate.  I could easily pay $200 or more for a piece of Wagyu beef at Alexander's steakhouse, but that's one big chunk of meat that is dry-aged and grilled just like every steakhouse (but honestly, their steaks are one of the best!!!). The beauty of French cuisine here at Quince is that you get to taste a little bit of everything. For a 12-course meal, you get a taste of how food is meant to taste, even without having that professional culinary background.\n\nSo for those of you who have not been to French Laundry, try Quince. I bet ya you will get the same type of food for the same price. The difference is the experience and how the staff made us feel.", "author": "Ammie A."}

I was lucky enough to take my man here for his birthday, and put ourselves in their extremely capable hands. From the host, who was bright and welcoming and sweet, to the backwaiter Juan who knew every detail of every dish, plate, herb etc, to the managers, somm, expo team and of course our amazing server- our dinner was flawless in every way, in every single detail we were treated like royalty. Their menu is perfect, it's complex yet has the farm-to-table \"simplicity\" that makes it approachable while simultaneously mind-blowing. They have a rooftop garden where most of their herbs and some veggies grow. We ate at Atelier Crenn a couple years ago, and it was delicious and amazing, but it wasn't Quince. What Quince has is so special, so rare. Michael Tusk will go into the chefs hall of fame for this beautiful projection of his ideas and amazing pairings. The experience here is well worth the price tag- you'll never feel so important in your life as this staff makes you feel. Every dish was perfectly orchestrated- and Milton, who I believe is head Server, really translated the heart and vision of every dish with his descriptions and notes. If you're even thinking about dining here- do it. Life is short and money should be spent on experiences not things.

Their beverage pairing, though a glass or shorter than other restaurants, was a very welcome addition.

The tasting menu I had included 11 courses, 3 of which were dessert plus an extra slice of cake since I was celebrating my birthday. Of the courses I tried, the only ones that I truly enjoyed were the lamb, salmon, and oyster (see photos). All the other savory courses were just a little too salty for my taste. I do give Quince props for presentation. Everything was plated so beautifully and service was very attentive.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-21", "description": "It was just announced in October that Quince had earned its third Michelin star. Since it's rare for a restaurant to lose a star once it has earned one, even if the food has declined, I thought that now would be the perfect time to experience firsthand what the Michelin tasters thought was worthy of three stars. And Quince did not disappoint. It was, hands down, one of the best meals of my life! Everything, from the meticulously-crafted food to the impeccable service, was absolutely perfect.\n\nWe had the unique opportunity to dine during white truffle season, and Quince was offering two options: a 5-course prix fixe menu for $395 ($300 for wine pairing) and a 9-course for $595 ($500 for wine). We opted for the 5-course tasting.\n\nStuzzichini di Benvenuto con Tartufo Bianco -- What a delightfully entertaining way to begin the meal! After an amuse of truffle goug\u00e8res, we were presented with a tablet -- yes, a tablet -- featuring a video of a truffle dog nosing around a wooded landscape. On the screen/plate were bits of moss, rocks, and branches from said forest. And hidden among the flora were tasty bite-sized truffle-infused edibles. As you watch the dog wandering around the mossy terrain, you, the diner, accompany the dog and hunt for truffles yourself. Next to the tablet was a round bowl with miniature skewers holding truffle-infused marshmallows over smoky truffle croquets -- a veritable truffle campfire with marshmallows. Paired with: 2008 Pierre Gimonnet, Special Club, Champagne.\n\nAfter this whimsical first course, we were presented with the bread boxes, which were, quite literally, to die for! I personally loved the pain d'epi and the brioche roll, but they were all very good -- so much so, in fact, that we got another. Carbs be damned!\n\nBay Scallop -- Our second course consisted of sliced bay scallops, sliced miniature potatoes, miniature potato chips, chervil, and, of course, shaved white truffles. Quince's play on surf and turf, this dish was refreshing and earthy at the same time. The sauce, which tasted a bit like vichyssoise, brought everything together and was absolutely delicious. Paired with: NV Krug Ros\u00e9 Champagne.\n\nLasagna -- The Michelin tasters called this dish a \"masterpiece,\" and they weren't kidding. It was only the size of a small millefeuille pastry, but I could have eaten several. Consisting of Four Story Hill Farm sweetbreads, parmigiana reggiano, some kind of vegetable, and thin medallions of shaved white truffles, the lasagna may just have been my favorite dish. But what really took it to the next level was the rich and creamy b\u00e9chamel-like sauce. It was absolutely stunning, and we didn't hesitate to \"fare la scarpetta\" to wipe up every last bit of those wonderful flavors. Paired with: 1998 Montevertine, Il Sodaccio, Tuscany.\n\nArrosto Mista -- The fourth course consisted of perfectly-cooked veal, savoy cabbage, tropea onion, porcini mushroom, and white truffles, served on a plate made from petrified wood. The unique presentation and yummy earthy flavors transported us to the verdant hills of Alba, Italy, home of the white truffle trade. Paired with: 1999 Gaja, Sperss, Piemonte.\n\nChiboust -- Dessert was also a highlight for me. It was a light and fluffy souffl\u00e9 cake sitting atop a truffle cake with Piedmontese hazelnuts and praline cr\u00e8me anglaise. And it was absolutely gorgeous! Our server asked whether we needed more truffle. Um, yes please! So there it was, more truffles. Paired with: 1997 Chateau d'Yquem, Sauternes.\n\nMignardises -- As if dessert wasn't enough, my jaw dropped when they wheeled out a cart filled with maybe a dozen or more miniature confections -- such as lychee and green apple jellies, homemade marshmallows, salted caramels, canel\u00e9s, and a variety of bite-sized cakes and tarts. It was a wonderland of sweets, and we were invited to partake in as many as we wanted.\n\nBy the conclusion of the meal, we honestly did not want to leave. We wanted to stay and bask in the glory that we had just experienced. But when we did finally decide to vacate our table, our gentle server was there, standing by the door, with our coats and umbrellas, and a goody bag full of arborio rice and a recipe for Quince risotto. It was a bittersweet ending to a beautiful meal.\n\nThank you Chef Michael and Lindsay Tusk for such a wonderful evening!", "author": "Paul L."}

Both did have exceptional service.  In terms of the food, it was the perfect blend of rustic and modern.  Everything was beautifully presented, and had a good blend of textures, flavors, hot vs. cold, molecular gastronomie and was very creative.  At the same time, it did not lose what food is all about: amazing flavors and taste.  It was a memorable experience and is now probably my favorite restaurant in the Bay Area.\n\nWe ordered the tasting menu below, but added a cheese course supplement, and the black truffle risotto supplement ($80 dollars but worth it).\n\nCANAPE - they had 5 different bite sized canap\u00e9s, all interesting favors and textures.  It was a melody in my mouth.\n\nFANNY BAY OYSTER\npink peppercorn, tarragon, horseradish\n\nEMPIRE CLAM\nborage, fennel, meyer lemon\n\nTSAR NICOULAI RESERVE CAVIAR - \nchampagne, leek, chive - served two different ways \n\nSTEELHEAD TROUT\nwatermelon radish, dill, buckwheat\n\nFARM EGG\ncarrot, perigord truffle, four story hill farm sweetbread - best farm egg I've tried out of all the restaurants I've been to.  One of the many highlights of the meal.\n\nTORTELLI\nred kuri, lapsang souchong, colatura di alici\n\nBRODO\nonion, black garlic, rocket\n\nMONTEREY BAY ABALONE\ncauliflower, nasturtium, lardo\n\nLASAGNETTA - also one of the many highlights of the meal.  Amazing, rustic, executed perfectly.\nguinea hen, swiss chard, wild mushroom\n\nBLACK TRUFFLE RISSOTO - best risotto I've tried ever.  This was worth the $80 dollar supplement\n\nBLACK TRUFFLE TORTELLINI - we got this free course as the chef was amused at how much we loved the Rissoto.  Also mind-blowing.  They did not skimp on the truffle in both of these courses.\n\nMILLBROOK FARM VENISON\nsalsify, celery root, prune\n-perfectly cooked and seasoned, also contrasting flavors and textures with the sides.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL CHEESE COURSE- they had 12 offerings and they let us try as many as we wanted.  That is amazing, and also came with warm home made breads, macarona almonds, apricot preserve and honey\n\nBLOOD ORANGE\nmarshall's farm honey, ginger, kataifi\n\nMERINGATA\ncandy cap, salted caramel\nWow.  The meringue texture with ice cream inside had a very good contrast.  Caramel sauce was perfectly balanced.  \n\nMIGNARDISES\nchocolates, confections\nThey served as a few of each kind and gave us a Togo box filled with goodies, along with hot chocolate to go.\n\nThis is a place I would go to each year, despite my desire to explore other places.", "author": "Katherine G."}

We were joined by our friends, one who had to abstain from food due to a recent illness. We called ahead of time to check and see if she was still able to go without ordering, and the restaurant was very accommodating, saying that it wouldn't be an issue.\n\nThe atmosphere itself was very intimate and quiet, it was nice being able to listen to ourselves and our company talk. \n\nIt was a 12-course prix fixe menu, and 3 in particular stood out to me: the caviar atop brioche, the garganelli (lobster), tortelli (porcini mushroom), and the strawberry dessert with smoked caramel coffee. All three had phenomenal flavors, I definitely could've used more than one portion of each! Quality over quantity, however. We also opted for an add-on, the foie gras, which was exceedingly rich and buttery. \n\nI was glad that my non-eating friend was also catered to as well, our servers would ask her if they could get her anything at all, and her water cup was always well-filled. She did have some of our bread during the bread course, and a bite or two of her husband's dessert. Service was exemplary overall. \n\nThe entire dinner was a 3.5 hour affair, and I quite enjoyed being able to savor all of my food. The reason it's missing that last star is because for the price of the meal, I was expecting one dish to blow my mind and my tastebuds. While all dishes were very good, not one was THE one, and I was just missing that wow factor. However, I truly enjoyed the food there and am happy to have finally tried a Michelin-starred restaurant.", "author": "Penelope K."}

It's an intimate feel without feeling too crowded.  \n\nWe started off with cocktails. I got one that was champagne based, and another that was rye based, and the highlight of the cocktails was the beautiful Japanese glassware. \n\nWines: they were donating proceeds from all of the North Bay wines towards the fire, so we had to go with a Sonoma Pinot. \n\nTo start - canap\u00e9s:\nSmoked potato croquette with garlic, perfect warm \nFried artichokes with crumbled iberico\nDry aged beef with nori crackers, squid ink aioli, and avocado \n... and to clean your hands: warm lemon shiso water\n\nThe meal:\n1. Kumamoto oyster: with a pink peppercorns, a vermouth and fennel glee, and horseradish granita. I love that it was served in a white porcelain dish shaped like an oyster shell \n2. Caviar: on super buttery brioche with a hollandaise on the side. It was Tsar Nicoulai (there's also a Golden Osetra Caviar panna cotta option as an $85 supplement) \n3. Razor clam: served in a long dish shaped like a razor clam (!) Also, Nantucket bay scallops, potato, squid ink croutons, and crosne\n4. Egg: soft cooked, with uni, topped with foam, served in an eggshell, but served in a larger porcelain egg container (at this point, I was loving the concept of foods served in dishes shaped like the food... \n5. Bread: served with a buffalo milk butter (made in house): country loaf, a pesto roll, and an olive bread; the pesto cheese one was my favorite, served warm in a pretty box \n6. Cod: with beets, brussels sprouts, and a brown butter sauce \n7. Garganelli: I love lobster and peas, which were the accompaniments for this. It also had a fragrant lemon verbena  sauce \n8. Abalone: with sun choke and chicory, great grill flavor, balsamic vinegar \n9. Squab: a very fall dish with chestnuts. I'm not a huge squab fan - it's generally too gamey for me as a protein, but this dish was done pretty well \n10. Tortellini: served in a long rolling pin with parmesan; I wished we had double of this \n11. Venison: wit carrot, salsify, walnut, and pomegranate - another very fall appropriate dish\n12. Almond pistachio tart with quince sorbet with a birthday cake\n13. Il flotante: with passionfruit creme anglais; I love passionfruit \n14. Mignardises - dessert cart (reminded me of Masa and La Folie back in the day): highlights were the financier, fig kouign amann, and my favorite - cannel \n15. Mini macarons with powdered sugar \n\nWhen we left, we were given to go cups of Mexican hot chocolate for the walk to the car, which was a nice touch. \n\nFood wise, everything was very well thought out and refined in preparation, but I did leave still feeling a bit hungry.\n\nOverall, definitely a good experience in terms of service and the skill involved in the preparation of the dishes. It was very different from my first time there - fancier, more refined, but I think less stuffy / more approachable.  \n\nNote: I think the price maybe doubled since my last visit, and corkage is now up to $75/bottle (but their wine list did get more extensive).", "author": "Marilyn T."}

I was thinking this was just another business dinner (albeit a very expensive one).  However, as we were getting our pre-dinner drinks, my manager and VP both surprised me by congratulating me on my promotion. So this turned out to be a promotion dinner.\n\nThe experience from beginning to end was phenomenal.  The moment the news was broken, it became clearer to me that the entire staff was also in on the surprise.The bartender quickly congratulated me with a special cocktail.  They took us to our table where a bottle of champagne was waiting.  The host took the bottle and congratulated me by my last name.  As each wait staff came to the table the first time, they also greeted me with a congratulations!\n\nThe food - in a word - AMAZING.  Each of us ordered the Quince menu.  As each dish came out, it was better than the previous. Although every dish on the tasting menu was delicious, my favorite was the squab.  The first bite was the moment many of us enjoy where it just smacks you in the face with flavor and the only response can be, \"oh my god that is good!\"\n\nMidway through our meal, we were escorted to the kitchen to meet the kitchen staff.  Again, there, the staff greeted me with a \"Congratulations,  Mr. Nguyen!\"  The sous chef gave us a quick \"walk around\" of the small kitchen.  I noted to him that it was very quiet in here, not like what I would have expected.  His response was that serenity and peace in the kitchen translates into each dish.  By every account that is true.  The intricacy of each dish is incredible and watching the staff plate the dishes was a very enjoyable experience.  In the kitchen, the sous chef had prepared a mid-dinner palate refresher.  It was a \"mojito\" that was frozen into a small sphere.  Shortly after you put in your mouth, it quickly melts releasing the mint flavors.  Yeah - aweseome!\n\nWe returned to our table to finish out the tasting menu. Then the dessert trays came out...two servings of dessert!  There were so many options, so we asked the waiter to pick for us.  He gave each of us the samples of samples.  Basically a bite of each.  Truly overwhelming!!\n\nAs we finished off the night our hostess greeted us at the door with hot chocolate to go.  Undoubtedly the richest, silkiest hot chocolate I've ever tasted.\n\nFrom the moment we stepped foot into the restaurant to the moment we left, we were treated incredibly well.  The food was incredible of course - but the entire experience was absolutely fantastic.\n\nThank you to the Quince staff for making my evening extraordinary!!", "author": "Thai N."}

It is pretty expensive but for a 2-star Michelin, I think it lives up to it. For a very special occasion, I think it's worth the splurge.  \n\nFrom the moment you walk in the door, and they know who you are and what you are celebrating, to the little cups of hot chocolate they provided on the way out, it is top notch service in a beautiful setting.\n\nThe dining room has high ceilings, interesting art work and absorbs sound well so it doesn't have a hustle bustle feel.  Even the cutlery and plates have a back story to them.\n\nIt is all prix fixe but they can customize it for you based on your dietary needs.\n\nThere was a dish I really didn't care for and so later on in the evening they brought out a small extra pasta dish \"to make sure we had enough to eat\".  Oh my goodness, there was plenty of food, but the antique rolling pin-turned into a serving dish was beautiful and the pasta was even better.\n\nThey do like to cook their pasta VERY al dente, so if you don't care for that, maybe let them know.\n\nSome highlights:\nFreshly dug potatoes (i know it sounds simple but just so flavorful)\nSpiral pasta with charred okra and tomatoes\nSquash blossoms with lobster\nDuck\nFoie gras\nChocolate cake (it was a special occasion so it's not on the menu but it was the best chocolate cake I have ever had)\nThe butter - yes the butter.  I ate the bread just so I had a vessel to eat more butter. So rich and creamy.\n\nThere are two unisex bathrooms in the back and both are beautiful and well-kept.\n\nValet parking is $15 and they add it straight onto your bill (gratuity not included).

I wish I could say that the culinary experience outweighed the negative service but the food was lackluster in taste and presentation. The flavors are bland and the dishes lack inventiveness.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-06-01", "description": "Exceptional.\nIt was an amazing experience we haven't expected. The reality of the dinner exceeded our anticipation and hopes greatly. If you want to splurge and create a memorable dining experience, Quince is a place to be. First of all, a tremendous thank you to Chef Tusk and his incredible team for the unforgettable evening they designed and implemented without a single glitch.\n\nThere's always much buzz about new and established best restaurants in the SF Bay Area and the city itself, and I've learned from experience that hyped places don't always deliver. More often than not, their level of sophistication fails expectations. Those with long waiting lists that open up once in a blue moon (and require enormous determination to sign up) often tend to disappoint in the end.\n\nAt Quince, your experience is building up on itself as the evening progresses. Hands down, the best place I've ever eaten at (and drank). It just tops them all IMHO. It currently holds 2 Michelin Stars. They undoubtedly upped their game to the point of 3-Star distinction already on the horizon.\n\nAside from the absolutely incredible tasting menu developed by Chef Michael Tusk, where each and every dish shines, the service is very much personable and beyond outstanding. The ambience is elegant and quant.\n\nThe timing is everything, both behind the scenes in the kitchen (of which we were given a tour, as well as an introduction to maestro Tusk), and in the dining room. Everyone is as attentive as can be, without showing their presence, mindful of your conversations... Absolutely no hovering while your every need is anticipated.\n\nIt is incredibly difficult to maintain the soft and attentive service over the course of several hours, and these guys stepped up to the plate figuratively and literally speaking. It's an art. We were truly impressed.\n\nNow to the food. Or can you even use the word as ordinary to describe the deliciousness that you put into your mouth? Slangy mouthgasm pales in comparison to your actual taste buds sensations!\n\nFor instance, a spring lamb canap\u00e9, from the Watson farm in the Napa valley, comprised of several pieces of different variety, and artfully presented... the middle bite of souffl\u00e9 mousse lamb - is there such a thing? - melted in my mouth as if it was a dessert... Indescribable!\n\nAnother memorable canap\u00e9 of Black Cod - wild ramp, Manila clam, fennel - never ever have I tasted a black cod this delicious and tender, just the right degree of preparedness to avoid over and/or undercooking, heavenly done!\n\nTsar Nicoulai reserve caviar - avocado, radish, fromage blanc - there was a portion that came in avocado fraiche and another one on a croissant brioche, complementing one another wonderfully. They pour out the creamy avocado sauce onto your creme fraiche out of individual avocado shaped containers!\n\nFanny Bay oyster - samphire, green strawberry, lemon verbena - served in the oyster shaped dish, it was our first bite and it dissolved in our mouths like the food of gods.\n\nQuince features California contemporary cuisine at its finest that celebrates the seasonal bounty of NorCal. They have a roof top garden where fresh herbs and veggies are picked up just prior to creating your next bite!\n\nIt's expensive. Factor in a bottle (or two) of their fine wines or champagnes (very extensive selection to satisfy a fine wine connoisseur), and any variations off the prix fixe menu, and the listed pricing grows exponentially. It is, however, well worth the enjoyment of the evening, if you can afford it.\n\nThere are treats and favors along the way, too. Your name printed on the menu as a keepsake; an unexpected trip to the kitchen and the Chef's treat to enjoy there; a cup of hot chocolate they send you off with to keep you company in a chilly SF night...\n\nThe respect and the warmth you get here are truly incredible. We left at midnight (and felt no slight inclination of gently seeing us out)! It felt as if we could have stayed throughout entire night if we wanted to!\n\nSeamless night with top notch execution on Quince part - I can't wait to return!", "author": "Grey R."}

They're on just about every list of must-try restaurants in San Francisco, so again I was anticipating highly. The atmosphere was even more upscale and obviously fancy than I remember The French Laundry being, and I automatically felt nervous. But again the staff was so warm and welcoming that I was immediately put at ease.\n\nWe were about fifteen minutes early for our reservation, and they were apologetic that our table wasn't ready yet--we didn't mind! We were early. When the time came the table still wasn't ready and they enticed us into the salon and offered us a complimentary glass of champagne--I'm still in the beginning of my wine appreciation years, but it was without doubt one of the most delicious wines I've ever had.\n\nI don't remember our primary server's name but he was fantastic. He was obviously having a great time doing his job and made the experience even better for us. Service overall was, as expected, impeccable. The food was inventive without being precious. Standouts: the gougeres!, poached asparagus with morels, tortellini with pork (served in a rolling pin with plating tweezers as a fun nod to chef's tools), the lamb plate (with sweetbreads, sausage, chop, and ash-grilled shoulder and belly--I didn't even know lamb could taste like this), dessert plate with sorbet, gelee, and an ice liquid poured over--texturally interesting and great. I also had the foie gras, which I had never tried before, and it was just incredible. My spouse declined the foie gras, and they brought him a ricotta raviolo so he would have something to eat at the same time.\n\nThey also offered us a chocolate-and-rhubarb cake for our anniversary celebration, which was very kind of them. And despite having already eaten almost too much, we ended up eating the entire cake, too. It was soooo light and fluffy. We had our sweet cart selections packed for us, and they were handed to us at the door with a minicup of hot chocolate on the way out. Outstanding start to finish.", "author": "Amanda P."}

The SO and I have been to a number of fine dining restaurants in the city; for most of this city, fine dining service is usually acceptable, sometimes awkward. I can say without a doubt though, that Quince's service is the best I've ever had -- the attention to detail throughout the entire meal, the efforts and lengths they went to to make up for a very minor mishap during our first meal, really exemplify what it means to have truly spectacular service and what it's like to make your patrons feel really special throughout their meal. Everyone was easy to talk to and fun to interact with.

First it should come as no surprise that this restaurant is expensive. It is in San Francisco. It is labor Intensive.  The menu last night included, geoduck, caviar, sea bass, abalone, lobster and lamb, not cheap ingredients.  We were there for 4 hours so they clearly they aren't like a lot of restaurants that are trying to turn tables, they really want you to have a enjoyable experience. Plus what started this rant was the fine print I missed last night on the menu I noticed this morning was they they have a \"tip pool\", the people in the back who are preparing the food are given a piece of the pie. How amazing is that??? They treat their whole staff like a team. And one look into the kitchen from the street it takes a lot of behind the scene work to put the evenings experience together.  So get over the price. It is worth it.\n\nThat being said it was an Excellent experience!!!! Celebrated my 3rd Anniversary with my love last night and it was perfect. Sebastian was our main waiter was attentive but not intrusive. Loved his knowledge and love his passion for the food and the wine. In fact all the staff were gracious and welcoming.  The food was what I would expect from a Michelin starred restaurant, creative, varied taste and texture most I loved and a couple were just ok. Yes, I said  all the food wasn't perfect but that is personal because what was ok with my sweetheart I  loved and vice versa. I wished we had done the wine pairing but because of driving and the needed to get up early to go to work just ordered the wine by the glass. The glasses of wine suggested by Sebastian were perfect with the meal. \n\nIf I was to complain and if I could give stars to their patrons, I would probably give  1 star to the people nearest us. The conversation two tables away was so loud, I learned things about the gentlemen that I really didn't need to know. And the table next to us asked for the food to come fast(they were tired) and the staff was quite accommodating. They asked for cold water and the staff brought iced water and they complained it was too cold. And one patron used it to wash their silverware. WOW but the best was to come. The one patron who was hosting the table who was on her phone most of the time stop midway and asked for the rest of the meal to be boxed to go. Yep that really happen and the staff was gracious and attentive as they waited on these people.  The staff  did not bat an eye. I don't think I could have been that gracious.\n\nClassy restaurant on all accounts. Go for the experience and you will leave with a wonderful memory.", "author": "Lisa Z."}

I visited a while back when the chef, Michael Tusk, offered a special tasting menu in conjunction with visiting chef Valeria Piccini from Ristorante da Caino, itself a two-starred restaurant in Tuscany.\n\nFrom start to finish, everything was exquisite, starting with the elegant dining room, which is cozy and intimate enough for either a romantic occasion or a serious business dinner. First came some delicious canapes, and next came a refreshing tuna tart from Valeria that featured tomato sorbet, pappa al pomodoro, nicoise olives, and capers. Even though all the ingredients and flavors going into it looked different on the surface, they all somehow managed to go down in a highly complementary way. \n\nNext came two pasta dishes. First, from Michael, was trofie with Nantucket bay scallop, cauliflower, and golden osetra caviar. Heavenly without being too rich, with the scallop and caviar adding interesting texture and taste to the pasta itself. Then, from Valeria, was the tortelli ripieni di cinta senese with chestnut, hen broth, little vegetables, and aceto balsamico tradizionale. Although the tortelli looked like small little pasta flowers at first glance, it was satisfyingly rich and filling going down, with the delicious hen broth adding to the richness and density of it all.\n\nA meatier entr\u00e9e followed - Michael's Paine Farm squab with farro, porcini mushroom, and treviso radicchio, all prepared to highlight the unique flavor of the squab, which wasn't quite duck and wasn't quite chicken, but was sure delicious nevertheless.\n\nThen came the first dessert, Valeria's orange and \"Maurizio Menichetti\" olive oil emulsion with goat's milk gelato and pink peppercorn. Once again, you'd think that citrusy orange flavors would clash with goat's milk gelato and peppercorn, but Valeria somehow managed to find balance and complementarity in the whole equation. This was followed by Quince's dazzling dessert cart, filled with dozens of little treats to pick from. Yeah, I'll sure have one of each!\n\nFurthermore, the wine pairing menu was worth every penny, and matched each dish perfectly.\n\nThe service here was immaculate, anticipating your every need while not being intrusive in any way. For example, the server offered me the restaurant's wifi code and a notepad with pen when she noticed that I was taking notes and photos with my phone. Each dish and glass of wine was also timed perfectly. Lastly, Michael and Valeria themselves took the time to walk around the restaurant, greet each patron, and answer questions.\n\nAll in all, one of the best dining experiences I've ever had - one that's worth marking with my 900th Yelp review.", "author": "Vincent L."}

Having recently dined at Momofuku Ko and Nightbird, my expectations for Quince were high and were definitely met. It was an interesting contrast to the usual Asian/Californian cuisine I'm accustomed to, and was a surprise to see it escalate to 3 michelin stars after my experience, \n\nFor those concerned that you won't leave full, you will. The price is well justified, and many dishes were creative with textures and flavors and the diversity of the menu made us anticipate each subsequent dish. They have complementary bread that is made in house (3 different kinds) that I believe are refillable. The beginning dishes were so creative and fun, and the plateware really complemented each dish. Some of the dishes that I still think about today are their corn ravioli and pork agnolotti! Oh and lest not I forget lobster wrapped inside a squash blossom. I was never really a fan of lobster until I ate this! For my anniversary they noted so on the menus and gave us a complimentary lemon tart. However, the desserts were OK, a little too sweet and tart, possibly just the choice of ingredients given the season. \n\nAs one not well versed in wine, the pairing wasn't too much to my liking as they had mostly old vintages with more nuanced flavors. However, they were still great pairings and it was great that we were able to split one among us. One of the pairings was served in an opaque black glass that we were coaxed into guessing!  Service was fantastic, the servers weren't intrusive and were diligent in maintaining water glasses full. Wines were explained, INCLUDING how they would pair with the dish and whet the appetite or accentuate the dishes. \n\nUpon exiting the restaurant, not only do you get to keep all the delicious mignardises they prepare for you as you finish dining, but our server greeted us at the door with house made hot chocolate! A sweet and warm way to end the night on a chilly SF evening. This is one aspect that still sticks with me with this restaurant as it leaves a happy memory in your mind as you leave instead of just paying for your check and the maitre de saying 'thank you for dining with us' on the way out. \nOverall it was a wonderful experience that ran almost 3 hours and I'll definitely come back for another special occasion; after I check out the other places SF has to offer!", "author": "Chad S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-22", "description": "It'd been a while since I'd been in San Francisco to try some of the finest dining in town (at least according to what Michelin says), so I was excited for our dinner at Quince. Given that they had just achieved the pinnacle with their third star, it definitely feels like you are in a treat when you get seated. The restaurant is housed in an older structure, with lots of exposed brick giving it a very homey feeling. With parts of the dining room sectioned off by curtains (which is where we were - off to the right side, with only one other couple at the other side of our section), it has an extremely intimate feeling despite the largeness of the space and the high ceilings. The service here was phenomenal, with extremely friendly waiters who detailed every last sauce and dressing of the food and chatted us up beyond the food as well. The drinks menu (particularly the wine) is extensive, but I had my first Pliny the Elder (which I'd heard much about) to start, and then a couple of absolutely delicious cocktails to round off the rest of the meal. My wife had tea service, and with teas sourced from Song Tea - her favorite tea shop probably anywhere - she was a big fan.\n\nOn the weekend, only the main Quince menu is offered (during the weekday, you can choose a seasonal tasting menu as well). However, you could add 2 dishes - a risotto or a fondue course; while the fondue sounded amazing, we opted to only go with one (the risotto, which we both had to order), as the menu looked plenty daunting to start with (11 courses, including dessert). The food is inspired by French and (more clearly) Italian cuisine, but the food is definitively contemporary American in its interpretation, and with a very big focus on locally sourced food from nearby farms. This was my first experience at a purely West Coast 3-star Michelin restaurant, but compared to Chicago (where the critics and high-end restaurants veer towards the experimental) and NYC (which hews more closely to what I feel is Old World preparation, with exceptions such as Chef's Table), the food at Quince seemed to take a more contemporary approach to the food. Frog's leg tempura and a parmesan-infused marshmellow were a couple of the delicious bites to start, showcasing different takes on those Old World flavors. A pumpkin-oat croquette had a sturdy meatiness and flavor despite having no meat. The start of the meal focused on creamy decadence - caviar served on brioche and on a blini with edible silver (the first edible metal of the night), with a richly flavorful hollandaise to dip in without the heaviness that usually has brunchers hankering for a nap. The Scottish lobster was poached masterfully, with thick drops of truffle-infused sauce adding that signature earthiness to each bite. Next up was a veloute-based soup served with celeriac, a generous chunk of creamy burrata, and leafs from brussel sprouts, all topped off with more slices of black truffle - a delicious dish perfect for the wintertime.\n\nWe started moving into the pasta portion hereafter with the risotta - a green color due to plankton(!), served with a few pieces each of uni and king crab. Aside from the color, the plankton makes it a salty dish that has a lot of warmth to it...perhaps the most memorable dish and a delicious one to boot. The bottoni pasta was delicious - another dish with pumpkin, a warm broth with a black tea base and parmesan fizz giving it a (very) light cheesy finish. The artichoke was the one dish I was a bit agnostic on - the presentation wasn't that appealing, and I'm not a big artichoke person to start, but the creme fraiche and truffles (again!) made it another dish perfect for the colder months. The guianciale pasta was a celebration of carrots - topped with carrot sauce and with pasta made with carrots, served with 'ash butter', it was a very rustic take on pasta that dialed back the richness of the other dishes. The tortelli was served in dishes as well as in a grater that was opened up, showing even more. The suckling pig filling was so juicy, and it worked great with rich barolo-infused sauce, making every tiny bite juicy and succulent. The last main dish - the venison - was the most straightforward, and while it was very good, particularly the jus, which amplified the gamey flavor - it was not as interesting and compelling as everything else we had.\n\nThe attention at dessert undoubtedly goes towards the massive cart of petit fours at the end, where you can take as much as you can manage - and there are so many delicious choices - but I actually liked the bearss lime crumble, which looks and has a bit of the texture of feta cheese but is an incredibly creative and refreshing palate cleanser. The meal was exemplary across the board, and the execution of the food at Quince felt straightforward: perhaps the food has some biases towards Italian cuisine, but it feels like you're dining at a uniquely American restaurant - and it does a great job of doing so without pretension.", "author": "Asuka N."}

That was one of quite a few interesting platings\n- food tasted good but heavy on the whole, with a lot of similar flavor profiles \n- there were too many truffle and pasta courses which made the meal feel too heavy and one-note. We would have liked some crudo to break it up\n- one salad that was served under offals finished tableside gave the meal a punch of freshness and acidity\n- the mignardises cart was pretty and stays on display in the hallway\n\nDrinks:\n- the wines recommended were interesting and unique.\n- the lemon sage non-alcoholic drink is amazing. The pro provencal, not so much, so they brought me an ad hoc orange chamomile which was kind of bland and not effervescent. They kindly offered to switch it again but i kept it because I felt bad.\n\nEnd of the Night:\n- they give you menus to take home and a box of mignardises that they think you will like based on what you ordered off the cart\n- they gave us hot cocoa, which tasted just okay but was a nice thought\n- the valet bill ($18) is added to the check and they pull the car around for you as you leave.\n\nOverall:\nA lovely dinner, but not my favorite for the price we paid. The food is delicious but overly rich and one note in flavors. My advice would be to just get the seasonal/smaller menu.", "author": "Christina G."}

The only thing I'll have to say is that the service is on point though. Very knowledgeable and attentive staff.  \n\nI know they recently went through a renovation so I couldn't tell you what it looked like before but the decor and atmosphere was very elegant. However, they did raise their prices afterwards.\n\nWe had reservations for 8:30 but got there a little early so we had a drink at the bar. One of restaurant attendants came to us and apologized that  our table wasn't ready yet but I said it was ok because we were the ones that were early. He insisted that our first drinks would be on the house. We thought that was so nice of the restaurant to do that. What a great start to my birthday meal right? Well, let's say at the end of the meal they didn't comp those drinks. I didn't care that I had to pay in the first place but when they say something at a restaurant you'd hope they honor it. Very disappointed on that level.\n\nThe entire meal was generally good but I felt like each dish was just missing a little something that  would have made it great. One of us had the wine pairing which went quite well with the meal. I maybe weird to appreciate these kind of details but they had an assortment of all types of wine glasses that went with each pairing. Great to know they use that kind of detail in this part of the restaurant.\n\nSorry to say but I've waited this long to try Quince and it left me disappointed.", "author": "Nguyen L."}

It's beautiful.  Service is perfection.  But after 4 visits, I wanted more.  Especially after just being awarded a third Michelin star.  \n\nMy expectation in raising a restaurant from two to three stars is that there is a substantial uplift in the level of quality, service and refinement.  Please don't misinterpret what I'm saying - these things have always been excellent at Quince.  But going from two Michelin stars to three should be like going from a really high-end Mercedes to a Ferrari 458.  Everything should be noticeably hand-built and perfect.\n\nBut, I feel like I've just gone from my nice Mercedes to one that's just a model year or two nicer.  It's perfectly good.  I can't complain about it.  Oh look, the navigation screen is a little bigger this year.  But I don't daydream about driving it while I'm sitting at my desk at work.\n\nIt's wonderful that their recent renovation enhanced the dining room and gave them some additional private room space.  The new art is fabulous.  That all, of course, translates to higher menu prices, as well.\n\nAnyway, bravo on your third star.

It was the most disappointing dinning experience ever!!!\n\nIt was my boyfriend's birthday and after long search of fine dinning restaurant we decided to try Quince, based on amazing Yelp reviews. \n\nOn the night we dined there, the only options they had was Truffles Tasting Menu, 5 and 9 courses. We decided to stay with 5, which was $375 per person. Also, the menu they presented was in Italian (interesting, how many people in America speak Italian? I don't know anybody). So, you don't even know what you are going to get. One big surprise!!!! But as l learned later, it was very disappointing and expensive surprise!\n\nSo, first course was 3 pieces if celery with few tiny pieces of beets , carrots and tasteless dressing. Truffles on the top saved it. But, com on!!! Celery??? I wish chef would come up with something more creative!!! Also, the strong taste of celery completely killed flavor of Truffles...\n\nSecond course as I remember ( I'm not good  at Italian, can't read the menu) was Cod with crusted potatoes on the top... It was just ok, truffles saved it again. \n\nThird course was ravioli, that was best dish of the night!!!  More truffles!!!\n\n4th and the most disappointing!!! Chicken breast and the worst Foie Gras ever!!! Let's start with Chicken...it was undercooked, with soft and mushy skin on the top. Next... Foie Gras looked and tasted like Chicken liver cutlet!!! Over cooked and very dry! The liver was grounded, dipped in the bread crumbs and then deep fried!!! Horrible!!! I would rather eat Chicken nuggets from McDonald's!!! Even truffles couldn't help this disaster! \n\nDessert was nice!!! But, I already was so mad that we were wasting our time and money on 3 pieces of celery and the chicken breast!!! I didn't even care for truffles at this point. \n\nAt every high end restaurant chicken is the least expensive dish on the menu and when you go to such an upscale restaurant and pay more then a $1000 for party of two, you expect something more then piece of Chicken breast!!\n\nAlso, after spending more the a $1000 for 5 courses for two of us they didn't even offered us a dessert cart. I guess, maybe you have to spend a $1000 per person to be offered that??? Such a rip off!!!\n\nI'm huge foodie and been to many great restaurants with famous and not very famous chefs and Quince was my biggest disappointment!!! \nTwo days later and I'm still very upset about!!

It was the most anticipated dinner I've had since...umm, well, since I waited for the rotisserie chickens to come off the skewers and into the warmer at Costco. OK maybe I should aim higher than that comparison. Quince is fancy and elegant but not off-putting, at least as much as you think it would be for the price point. Oh dear, did I mention the price point? It's $190 for the seven-course, prix fixe menu (photo: http://bit.ly/1srRSI8), and that's without wine pairings or the shaved truffles or any other indulgence you may feel you deserve. This is Special Occasion dining with an other so significant that you should be able to recite your pre-nup from memory. And oh yes, it was my birthday.\n\nIt's been renovated although I have no idea what it looked like before. Of course, it's quite smart-looking, very black, white and tan with the elaborate floral arrangements providing the only real color (photo: http://bit.ly/1yShimC). The bar is small and sparsely populated since there is no scene here. Chef Michael Tusk is an artist, as every dish looked immaculate, precise and completely unique even in a foodie-saturated town where presentation is king...or maybe queen. Even the first thing at our table, a cup of deceptively simple Breadsticks, offered just the right seasoned crispiness as Jamie W. and I devoured them quickly (photo: http://bit.ly/ZT1qRt). A parade of amuse bouche came in easy succession as they brought immediate joy with every bite.\n\nFirst were the Goat Cheese Puffs (photo: http://bit.ly/10YY3Zz) and then tiny Vegetable Kabobs with equally tiny bites of Parmesan-Sprinkled Polenta (photo: http://bit.ly/1ySDRYf). A hefty oblong glass tray arrived next with miniscule hors d'oeuvres on display: spherical Beets with Black Olive and Creme Fraiche alternating with Squash Napoleon cubes (photo: http://bit.ly/1xwX1OX). Then another little plate came with Kampachi floating over a thick cube of toast and a gelatinous Avocado appetizer over what appeared to be a Crab Cake (photo: http://bit.ly/1ySHUnA). All of these items were quite nice, but we have yet to begin the actual dinner. Finally an adult-size plate arrived with the first course, the Royal Sterling Caviar with Green Apple Gel\u00e9e, Kaffir Lime and Sea Urchin (photo: http://bit.ly/1EC40ef).\n\nThe caviar was so decadently good and nicely complemented with all the unexpected flavors. The Spot Prawns looked like they were in a Renoir painting as part of an elaborate arrangement of Nasturtium Leaves, Capers and Cauliflower (photo: http://bit.ly/1uPrZlZ). Lovely freshness in a garden-like setting on a plate. An unusually Black Roll came next (photo: http://bit.ly/1th4MdL) to accompany the Abalone \"Minestra\" with Shelling Beans, Black Garlic and Smoked Tomato (photo: http://bit.ly/1D0eEtD). It was indeed a comforting seafood minestrone. Artistically arranged like a Pollack painting, the Sunchoke Casoncelli came with Fontina Val D'Aosta and Black Trumpet Mushrooms (photo: http://bit.ly/1EC4mle). The candy wrapper shape of the stuffed pasta added to the whimsy.\n\nThe more substantial follow-up was another pasta dish, the Grano Arso Tagliatelle with Paine Farm Squab, Pomegranate and Chestnut (photo: http://bit.ly/1oWPRON). Chewier goodness with the pomegranate painted onto the plate. A real piece of quality meat ended the savory dish extravaganza, the Marcho Farm Veal with Wheat Berries, Turnips and Brussels Sprouts (photo: http://bit.ly/1xwY6GE) accompanied by a roll shaped like a longhorn and a canela of creamy butter. It was a tender cut and gone too soon if you ask me. An unexpected palate cleanser came in the form of a light Vanilla Sorbet with a tiny Blueberry Cobbler and a Chocolate Cookie (photo: http://bit.ly/1w9pNUG).\n\nDessert finally but first a surprise Chocolate Pave with a single candle as if I was Zsa Zsa (photo: http://bit.ly/1quSFSS). Then our attention was immediately redirected to the Valrhona Chocolate Cremeux with Piedmontese Hazelnut and SIghtglass Coffee (photo: http://bit.ly/1th5uaW). Enough? Not yet as we were shown their legendary buffet cart of sweets (photo: http://bit.ly/1vTaiQI) where we promptly tried two of everything from Chocolate Bark to Baby Lemon Meringue Tarts (photo: http://bit.ly/1varu7x). Enough already? Yes, we caved finally but not before getting a gift-wrapped Breakfast Muffin to go (photo: http://bit.ly/1yTj2Ms). Even the restroom was swanky with a beautiful chandelier to admire (photo: http://bit.ly/ZT3jO8). A memorable evening indeed, luxurious dining not for the penny-pinching Costco diner but for the foodie extraordinaire with deep pockets.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...Tusk is quite an artist in the kitchen\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...darkly elegant, just a little too close to the next table \nSERVICE - 4 stars...very polished, polite and attentive if a mite stiff\nTOTAL - 5 stars...elegant & premium priced but definitely worthwhile for special occasions...like my birthday, of course", "author": "Ed U."}

Checking in with the hostess, we were immediately seated in one of their smaller rooms, which had a more intimate setting, albeit the lighting was dim.  \n\nYou'll notice the high level of service from the start.  Our main server described the menu options, the Quince Menu and the Garden Menu.  She also described and pour the wines for the pairing.  Our other server ensured that our water glasses were filled, cleared plates, and refilled the bread. She was answered our questions about the history of Quince and about the current location.  We had several people that brought our food and poured the wine as well.  Some of the servers were more personable than others. \n\nOur Quince menu items:\nWelcoming bites / Amuse-bouche. Served on skewers in a custom-made two compartment dish that consisted of salmon, avocado, and king crab.  \n\nBlack River Russian Caviar - Burrata, celtuce, radish.\n\nTomato - Monterey sea urchin, shiso, coastal seaweed \n\nCharentais Melon - Wild fennel, prosciutto, almond\n\nAlaskan King Crab - Pumpkin, Asian pear, Masutake\n\nTagliolini \"Carbomare\" - Squid, Gaper clam, Agretti\n\nPhil Paine's Squab - Gooseberry, chestnut, chanterelle\n\nBershire Pork - Flageolet, eggplant, okra\n\nPalette Cleanser of Blood Orange, Marshall Farm honey, ginger, Kataifi\n\nConcord Grape - Sesame, cocoa nib, Dulcey chocolate\n\nMignardises - Chocolates, confections.  What a spread.  Of course, we got one of each. \n \nThere were two bread servings, a mini torpedo baguette and a honey roll.  \n\nOverall, a delicious artful presentation of food in an intimate setting.

I've been eating at Quince since they were located on Octavia Street in Pacific Heights but there is no comparison to their current level of service and what their world class kitchen is producing to what they used to be.  Michael Tusk is a genius and his constant evolution shows his unmatched passion. \n\nBeyond their absolutely incredible food and wine, their service is especially uncommon.  While Quince is probably the most formal restaurant in town, the staff still has personality, a sense of humor, and is very approachable.  A while ago after my 10th glass of wine I joked during the cheese course that nothing they had could compete with Boursin.  (yes, the cheese in the tin foil from Safeway)  Some time later during my birthday meal I had there, placed in front of me during the cheese course was a perfectly unwrapped mound of delicious Boursin with a lone lit candle in the center.  Hilarious.  And delicious.   A few weeks ago, unprompted, they made \"potato skins\" with fingerling potatoes and Boursin for my table.  I love these guys. \n\nAside from the delicious Boursin jokes, their Risotto is the best in the world.  It's so good it deserves a new category.  Everything is phenomenal.", "author": "Will H."}

In a lot of ways it was like being with familiar folks from the beginning. We were super comfortable around the amazing staff.\n\nThey were totally respectful of my pickiness. I don't eat seafood. I also mentioned that my wife loves German chocolate cake and they made her a small one for dessert too.\n\nMy wife went big (right side of the menu with the wine pairing.). She upgraded to a caviar feature. Not only was the dinner a nice journey, but you could just tell how passionate the kitchen was about making sure people love it. They sent out an extra plate to make sure my wife got to try something she didn't order.\n\nBefore dessert we took a tour of the place including the kitchen and being able to chat with a chef. Again, these people are just so nice and completely passionate about their art.\n\nMy wife didn't love one course and they saw she didn't eat much of it so they apologized profusely and made another special dessert plate. My wife looked at me and said \"this is possibly, probably... IS the best dessert I've ever had.\"\n\nI'm not a truffle nut by any means, but they just found such a wonderful way to make truffle a big part of the experience, but without just adding more cowbell (if you know what I mean).\n\nEven as we left, they had hot chocolate waiting for us. We left our menus on the table and they e-mailed me to say they'd send it to our house.\n\nI'm just such a fan of their food, their people and the experience. \n\nWell deserved 3 stars.

It is a most elegant restaurant with numerous pieces of impressive artwork. We especially liked a photo of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara on a fishing vessel.  Anyway, rather than sitting  in the main dining room, we asked for another table in the more intimate side \"rooms\" -  a simple and elegant setup with tables arranged next to each other. Before ordering we both ordered the Quince Martinis which were outstanding, so much, that we ordered another set of these, which interestingly, were presented in different style glasses. (I have now found the recipe for these delicious drinks and will make them at home)\n\nBoth of us tried the Quince tasting menu and the wine pairing. We understand that this menu changes frequently and therefore, what we experienced, might not be repeated on other days. The Amuse Bouche consisted out of San Francisco anchovies and salmon presented on a very petite plate - very delicious! This was then  followed by several wood containers presenting small bites - we simply cannot remember what they were but the taste and presentation was outstanding.\n\nThis was before the main courses began. First of all we had the Black River Russian Caviar  with Wasabi, Lime and Avocado accompanied by an unusual, but in hindsight,  delicious choice, Aizu Chojou Sake Honjozo. This was followed by the Santa Barbara Spot Prawn with Burrata - an outstanding and delicious combination accompanied by a Vino Bianco 2012 Fiorano. \n\nThe Big Island Abalone came next with Black Garlic and Cabbage - a combination that worked exquisitely. The wine pairing was a delicious 2006 Keller Riesling from Rheinhessen - wonderful - I must try to find this.\n\nThe informative and extremely pleasant and enthusiastic server then  presented Tagliolini Carbomare accompanied by a 2013 Quintodecimo Giallo d'Arles Greco di Tufo  wine, an outstanding selection among the Greco di Tufo wines. This was followed by Fagottini with Australian Black Truffle and a 2008 Pino Noir from the Sonoma Jack Hill Vineyard - this course was absolutely delicious and paid a compliment to the Chef's skills. \n\nThe following presentation was Watson Farm Lamb, which my wife is still raving about. This was paired with a 1995 Chateau Beaucastel Chateauneuf du Pape. A palate cleanser arrived in the form of Blackberry, Elderflowers presented in a delicious ethereal light foam - outstanding. \n\nLast, but not least, we were given an Elephant Heart Plum with a 1975 Sauterne, Chateau Rieussec. To finish of this delicious meal we were offered a migniardise cart filled with caramels, eclairs and chocolate and other confections.\n\nTo top it off, when we waited for our Ueber car we were given a cup of hot chocolate to go, a nice touch. The entire meal ended up taking around 2.5 hours. We both were unanimous in giving the overall experience 5 stars.\n\nOur meal was clearly compelling and the outstanding, warm, professional  service made it all the more unforgettable, despite the $1100 price tag.", "author": "Thomas C K."}

Everyone was all smiles and the ambiance of the restaurant put us immediately at ease. The tables are nicely spaced, so you aren't packed in like sardines. Our table was in the middle with a light shining right on our table. Now you may not think this is a big deal, but for someone who likes to snap a picture or two during dinner -- it was nice to not have a dark, blurry picture of the food or to try and brave the shame of having your camera flash go off.\n\nWe both had the Tasting Menu which had been customized with a \"Happy Anniversary Jennifer & Ben\" right at the top along with the date. SO CUTE! Every single dish was phenomenal -  notable mentions were the squash blossom stuffed with lobster, the caviar panna cotta (which was an added \"upgrade\"), and our absolutely favorite: Tortelli covered in truffle. Each bite from these dishes left happy goosebumps trailing up and down my arms. \n\nOur server was Aaron and he was exceptional! He was extremely knowledgeable about the food and wine..and really seemed to be really be in engaged in our entire experience. When being introduced to the pairings, there were moments when I felt like he was speaking a foreign language - but he kindly let me nod my head with no judgments. Throughout the meal Ben asked a lot of questions, and Aaron humored him with unrushed answers. At one point, Ben had asked about how the kitchen staff operates and proceeded to ask how the team artfully choreographs the service so seamlessly...of course, right as I was about to tell him to stop asking so many questions, Aaron actually asked if we wanted a tour of the kitchen. Um. YESSS! The highlight (among only highlights) of the night was getting a private tour of the kitchen with the Chef. Who walked us through the different stations and we saw all the kind, smiling faces of the people who had thoughtfully crafted our entire evening.\n\nI really can't say enough about how wonderful the entire experience was.

Our waiter was very warm and friendly and made us feel very comfortable during our meal. We ordered both the Quince menu and the Garden menu and both were exceptional. I've never tasted anything near as good as the food here. In between courses a couple times an employee who has worked at Quince for 12 years would come and talk to us about the artwork, and the furnishings, and the roof top garden. It was very clear that he takes great pride in the restaurant. At the end of our meal our waiter asked if we would be interested in having a tour of their wine cellar and kitchen. The wine cellar was very nice and impressive, but I was blown away by the kitchen. It was very clean, very organized and yet again it was very clear that these people take great pride in their work. The most impressive were the guys that were lining up caviar on plates with tweezers!

I was a bit bashful about ordering wine as they have some that cost a few grand and with the quality of this restaurant I'm sure most of their patrons can afford bottles that are at least a few hundred dollars.  However, Pinky and I are not one of those patrons that can afford those bottles, not yet at least. ;)  She didn't bat an eye when we told her our price range and she gave us many helpful information and suggestions for our pick, even pouring us some tasting glasses and opening a brand new bottle to try before we commit.  Amazing service!  \n\n The food, to be honest I can only remember the two dishes that completely stood out to me which was the first complimentary bite of the fried tomato with b\u00e9chamel sauce...like lasagna in one bite!  The young chicken dish which I forget the name of was Pinky's favorite, the meat was so tender yet springy.  \n\nAll the touches of complimentary bites, amuse bouche, palette cleansers, additional complimentary desserts and aperitifs down to the vanilla bean caneles they send you off with..genuinely nice service and zero pretention. This is why rich people pay so much money to dine at restaurants like these!!!  This was by far the most expensive meal I have ever had in my life hands down and probably the most expensive meal Pinky has ever paid for hands down.

Every course of this tasting menu was done to perfection. If you confuse pretentiousness with luxury, this is not the place for you. It's expensive and formal. I was a little put off when I read that they have a dress code, being the rebel that I am. Once inside you will see why. The waitstaff was like a highly trained army with utmost courtesy and attentiveness. We were invited into the kitchen for one of our courses. That kitchen is a totally heads-down operation to a person. Chef/Owner Michael Tusk came to our table (there is only one 2 top table) and chatted with us and I got to compliment him on his art collection, which adorns the walls of Quince with spectacular opulence. The one negative is that we were seated in the section where the staff goes from the kitchen to all the other dining areas so it was constant \"background action\" whizzing by our table which was distracting from the experience, thus the \"army\" reference. Not just one at a time but 6 or 7 people all in a line heading to and from the kitchen. Next time I will request different seating. When making reservations make sure to say that you don't want to eat in the way back in front of the private dining room and the somm station.", "author": "Mik H."}

Both are tasting menus.  The Quince Menu offers a tasting menu reminiscent of excellent fine dining restaurants like The French Laundry where guests are presented a series of amuses and then several courses highlighting both high quality and a variety of proteins, fruits and vegetables with an indulgent mignardises service finale.  Quince also offers a Garden Menu, which is not exactly a vegetarian menu but definitely a showcase of the season's best fruits and vegetables.  Given how Quince integrates Italian cuisine in a lot of its presentations, the Garden Menu is also the perfect way to experience delicious made from scratch pastas.\n\nLike the Quince Menu, the Garden Menu starts with a canapes service and it is one of the best in the country.  Wonderful flavor combinations and a variety of pleasing textures are presented in small bites like an ode to New York with a crispy thin feuille de brick filled with creamy smoked fish and covered in seeds to produce a flavor like an everything bagel.  There was also a great chickpea panisse, black radish filled with crab and a Manresa-like brown butter and sorrel financier that combined savory with sweet.\n\nThe amuse bouche was a great reflection of spring with a nasturtium panna cotta paired with ramps and a sliver of sweet uni.  My first course was creamy cauliflower bianco, both raw cauliflower and cauliflower crisps, a sweet note from juicy sultanas, and a salty flavor provided by smooth, thinly shaved and even creamy Pecorino Romano.\n\nThe next course was the only miss of the night--a salad of thinly shaved and lightly cooked vegetables like asparagus and zucchini sitting on a base of tonnato with shaved cured egg.  While this was a fun presentation, there was too much of the creamy and tangy tonnato.  I think it is best to consider the tonnato like butter for bread where you only use as much as you would like.\n\nThis was followed by amazing white asparagus with white asparagus puree, spring onion and a sauce of morel vin jaune poured tableside.  White asparagus is milder than green asparagus as well as much more rare.  It was a great contrast to the slight sharpness provided by the spring onion as well as the savory morel cream sauce, which provided a sherry-like flavor as well as perfectly cooked, nutty and meaty morels.\n\nA series of pastas followed and they were all excellent.  There was rotolo pasta, which featured made from scratch pasta wrapped around an exceptional filling of finely minced and earthy porcini mushrooms.  Artichoke was also integrated into this dish, which was very well balanced in combining creamy and light elements with a rich and distinct mushroom flavor.\n\nNext was busiate pasta, which was mixed with a variety of spring ingredients.  There was great freshness provided from peas and Bergamot mint, which also introduced a fragrant and a surprising peppery flavor that added distinct natural seasoning to the dish.  The best pistachios out there (Sicilian pistachios) were lightly toasted to bring out their sweet and nutty flavor.\n\nThe entree was a robust and meaty salt baked beet, which was served with sweet and crunchy hazelnuts and exceptional swiss chard that was nicely cooked down to deliver an experience like creamed swiss chard without the heaviness.  I also added a course of tender abalone with perfectly prepared fiddlehead ferns (charred enough to reduce their strong bitterness), fresh fava beans and exceptional morels.\n\nDessert started with a palate cleanser of blueberries, blueberry sorbet, crunchy almonds, and buttermilk foam.  The main dessert integrated sweet strawberries with a cheesecake like cream of sheep's milk yogurt and a refreshing and tart but still sweet rhubarb sorbet.  The mignardises featured all kinds of great bites like delicious nougat, a sugar dusted pastry filled with coffee cream and a variety of tarts.\n\nService was very good--polished and professional (courses were also served at an even pace).\n\nPrices are high and since the Quince menu utilizes a lot of premium proteins, it feels like a better value than the Garden menu though you will see integration of expensive truffles in the Garden menu during certain times of the year.\n\nThe Garden Menu is an excellent representation of the exceptional cuisine Quince is capable of.  I also think their pastas shine more in the Garden Menu than the Quince Menu.  For first time guests, the Quince Menu is probably the way to go though you may want to see if the kitchen will swap out a Quince Menu course with one of those tantalizing Garden Menu courses.\n\nMetered street parking is available.", "author": "Anthony N."}

The performance of their staff was simply outstanding. They were on top of literally everything, checking in on the precise start time of the meal, counting guests to know whether everyone had arrived, on top of every empty glass and always having passed appetizers at the ready. \n\nWe had mistakenly given a final guest count of 14, when in actuality the guest count was 16. The head waiter noticed a couple unaccounted for guests had arrived and after confirming with me, he simply went into \"no problem\" mode and quickly adjusted the table and readied the kitchen while the guests continued chit chatting in the adjacent wine cellar, no one noticed. \n\nThe food was once again perfection. The highlight for me is their \"cheesy poof\" (not it's official name :)... a warm gouda filled pastry ball. Second to the poof was their amazing c\u00f4te de boeuf. \n\nQuince will continue to be one of my go to spots for special occasions or whenever I need an outstanding dining experience.", "author": "Jeremy S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-28", "description": "I've written several reviews of Quince, both here and on OpenTable in the past year. These reviews pretty much all said the same thing: the meals at Quince rank among the best I've had in my life. They're fun, they're delicious, they're well-made.\n\nHowever, it turns out that Michelin has belatedly realized this as well, and recently gave Quince its 3rd star. Yes, it's deserved - but now it's noticeably more difficult to get reservations. My schedule is sufficiently hectic that this makes it distinctly more difficult to go. So I have somewhat mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, it's nice to see recognition for good work, on the other hand, it was also nice knowing that I'd found a somewhat underappreciated world class restaurant right in my backyard. Now the secret's out I guess.\n\nMy most recent meal there was actually in November, soon after their third star. Like any Quince meal, it comprised a terrific assortment of courses. Several of the courses were so spectacular I can still taste them like it was yesterday.\n\nMy favorite course was a pasta dish with white truffles and fontina. I make a lot of homemade pasta myself and very few restaurants can compete with good homemade pasta; this was really good. There was a strong truffle taste to it too - most local restaurants that say they add truffles to thing add so few it's hard to taste the truffles. Quince put quite a bit on there. Anyway, it was a rich, complex flavor, one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had, I'd say.\n\nAnother simple but remarkable dish is one that I doubt readers will even believe can be as good as I describe: a simple pain d'epi. Quince always has wonderful breads, easily the best of any restaurant I've been to, but even for them this simple piece of bread, looking like typical baguette, was just amazing. Delicate, crisp but firm crust; airy, flavorful interior.\n\nOther highlights were a wonderful and complex venison dish. Grilled venison is served alongside a separately prepared skewer of venison, served over charcoal at the table. So good! I also had a terrific squab dish. \n\nI'm actually not a wine expert, but even I could appreciate a smooth and delicious 1996 Bordeaux (Chateau Lannesan), served out of an Imperial (6 liter) bottle.\n\nI was also a bit amazed, even after all my meals there, at how accommodating and helpful Quince is. I am definitely a challenging customer, with all kinds of dietary restrictions. Most restaurants, even great restaurants, respond by just leaving out some ingredients or making some simple dish. Quince actually made me several fairly complicated and excellent dishes that weren't even on the menu (foie gras for instance). Not only was the food great, but I was kind of dumbstruck by how hard they were willing to work to give me and my companion a memorable meal.\n\nLike I said in my previous review, there are so many courses - something like 18 dishes, depending on how you're counting - that it's inevitable that not all of them will be as great. My favorites were the truffle pasta, the venison, the foie gras, porcini tortelli, the pain d'epi and the wine (although I also liked the amuse bouches). But the pithivier was not quite as good as other desserts I've had there. Or maybe I was just stuffed by that point.", "author": "Hungry S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-14", "description": "I've been very fortunate to have been to three restaurants that were awarded 3 Michelin stars (The Restaurant at Meadowood, The French Laundry and Joel Robuchon Restaurant in Tokyo), three 2 Michelin starred and five 1 Michelin starred restaurants.  I'm not bragging but I want to put my review in context of my past dining experiences.\n\nWe had the Quince tasting menu with the wine pairing for dinner.\n\nPresentation of the food:  Everything was nicely presented but nothing really wowed me.  The presentation at Joel Robuchon's La Table in Tokyo (2 Michelin stars) was over the top; they made their food look like art and that was my bar to gauge other restaurants.  I was least impressed with the presentation of the Suckling Pig Tortellini.  Honestly, it looked like a plate I get at the Olive Garden.  I understand it is just tortellini and cheese but they could have placed the tortellini to make it look more appealing or add a few other ingredients to add color without affecting the taste in a negative manner.  Other dishes were presented better but still nothing outstanding.\n\nTaste:  I liked that Quince didn't hide behind butter and cream.  Their ingredients were fresh and I could taste the individual ingredients.  For example, I could taste the subtle sweetness in the abalone.  The lamb dish was amazing because they served 4 different cuts of the lamb (chop, loin, shoulder and shank) on one plate.  Each cut tasted so different from one another and it was a real treat to be able to try all 4 cuts side-by-side.  I think this attention to detail on the flavors is what really earned them their 2 stars and set them apart from other restaurants.\n\nService:  The service was awesome.  They don't hover over you but they are  there if you want something.  The staff was extremely friendly and some even joked around with us.  We opted for the wine pairing so the wines were explained by various members of the staff (not by a dedicated sommelier).  They didn't mind when we inquired about some of the ingredients in our dishes.  We were celebrating my husband's birthday and I was really surprised to get so many birthday wishes from the staff.  It seemed like all the staff knew it was his birthday and wished him a happy birthday.  I personally thought the service here was better than at The French Laundry.\n\nEnvironment:  It is a comfortable setting and accommodates all occasions.  We chose to dress up but didn't go full formal (e.g. suit no tie).  We saw some wearing suit & tie, business casual and one in jeans with a plaid shirt so it seems you can just be comfortable and dress for your occasion.  With the exception of a few tables for two near the bathrooms, the tables were spaced far enough apart to provide a sense of privacy.  The noise level was nice and quiet but still loud enough that you didn't feel everyone was listening to your conversation. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience at Quince but there was nothing that stood out to make me want to come back right away.  Well, maybe the near perfect service was outstanding but I think I will continue to try some of the other restaurants in the bay area that were awarded 2 Michelin stars.", "author": "Lily L."}

They were very accommodating and when I arrived in a flustered panic, they calmed my anxious nerves with sincerity, comfort and care. The host did not punish me with a long wait but rather took my coat and kindly escorted me to my table. The environs of the newly renovated restaurant embodied a restrained elegance and masculine inspired color palate of deep rich browns and accessible earth tones punctuated by warm, inviting lighting and opulent chandeliers cascading above. With that said, I must admit the staff was incredibly warm and friendly, as well. Especially for a restaurant of this caliber, I've come to expect a certain level of pretension and I honestly felt none of that at all throughout my dining experience here. \n\nAs we glanced through our menu, the nimble staff spared no time in presenting us with some charming canap\u00e9s which included a black radish wrapped dungeness crab with finger lime, potato with almond terrine and fava bean tartlet. They were all quite delightful gems that excited the palate and invigorated by appetite for the inspiring culinary journey ahead. But that wasn't all, more exhilarating canap\u00e9s followed like the chickpea panisse, white asparagus croquette zeppole and more I can hardly pronounce but I do recall they were fantastic.\nNext up were a pairing of luxurious caviar dishes. The plating and presentation was immaculate but more importantly was the incredible mouthfeel and flavor profiles of these exquisite dishes. The caviar had a beautiful briny flavor and supple mouthfeel that paired perfectly with the silky Creme fraiche and buttery brioche.  I was taking awhile to savor my dish. As a result, the support staff kindly replaced my accompanying brioche with new warm brioche without me even asking. Remarkable! \nOur subsequent dish was a delicate and supple salmon wrapped white asparagus served with light & airy fried salmon skin and creamy buttermilk. An extraordinary dish that was both bright and fresh with warm earthy notes. \nNext up was the foie gras and sweetbreads. Both equally marvelous dishes but If I had to choose seconds, it would be the sweetbreads hands down. Warm earthy incredible texture and deep permeating flavors that made my tastebuds dance in sheer delight. \nNaked ravioli with porcini mushrooms and bronze fennel. A comforting dish with subtle yet familiar flavors that didn't necessarily excite the palate but rather cradled it in a blanket of warmth and love.\nWe continued with a beautiful casoncelli stuffed with Phil Paine's squab ruby beets and borage. A praiseworthy dish that was both masterfully prepared and infinitely satisfying. \nWe enjoyed a beautiful Watson Farm Spring lamb shank as our final savory dish. The lamb was prepared with a succulent and perfectly pink center. The contrast in flavors made for an fantastic dish that had me gasping for more. \nWe enjoyed an impressive palate cleanser soon after and oh how sublime it was! A sake granita served with 24 gold! Now that's rich.\nFor dessert we enjoyed a splendid Valrhona chocolate Guanaja mousse with crunchy shortbread. Impressively plated and devoured within moments. A spectacular end to our inspiring meal.  We left with a collection of whimsical mignardises, petit fors and financiers. As we left the restaurant, we were offered hot chocolate for the journey and our jackets in tow. I left satiated and completely satisfied. Our meal was both compelling and the impeccable  service made it all the more unforgettable. I'd gladly enjoy a dinner like this when I'm in town again and it's one i'd personally recommend to my friends and family alike. A well earned 2 Michelin Stars and 5 Stars from this guy for a dinner that was nothing less than stellar!\n\nBravo Quince...and \n\nHappyeats!", "author": "Kent D."}

While we really knew it was a done deal, he was expecting the official call, while we were at dinner.\n\nOur menus had been customized for our event, and our waitress, sommelier, and even both Lindsay and the chef Michael Tusk, were so involved and excited for us. Our waitress literally teared up (which of course made me cry) when I told her my husband's story...the American dream; poor Mexican boy living in a bad area of the City. Mom and Dad working multiple jobs to send him to private school..and is now a successful business man, amazing husband, and terrific father...\n\nMy point is that when \"THE\" call came in, before we could bat an eye, there were two champagne flutes placed in front of us. Everyone (and I mean everyone!) came by to congratulate us and we were invited back into the kitchen to meet Michael Tusk, himself.

Come here for a dining experience or special occasion. I am not giving it a 5 as the desert we got was not very good - essentially some chocolates, caramel & one other item - I would have expected a high end restaurant to prepare something such as a cake or mousse, for the price we paid of $250 per person, plus drinks, taxes, & tips. The Taj Campton Place still stands as my favorite high end place in San Francisco The 1st time we dined at Quince a few years ago one item came to us which was not vegetarian, but they more than made up for that error with the manager personally checking everything after & this time we did not have that problem.

The restaurant was rather fancy and service was excellent. My boyfriend told them that it was my birthday when he made the reservation, so they specially printed the menu with my name on it and greeted me happy birthday :) They even let me keep the menu at the end of the meal :)\n\nWe had the Quince Menu ($180 each) which comprised of quite a number of courses.\n\nWe started off with some welcome snacks, compliments of the chef. There was some curry flavored cracker which we both really loved, and we love how the treats were all garnished with flowers that apparently came from their rooftop garden. \n\nIn between courses, we were offered fresh bread (loved the soft and warm white bread with milk), and we had a waiter come chat with us and told us all about the lovely art display around the restaurant.\n\nMy favorite dishes were the spot prawn, caviar with oyster, fish, and squab. \n\nSpot prawn with avocado, persian cucumber, wasabi - Loved this! The cucumber and wasabi accentuated the freshness of the spot prawns, which were smooth and glided down my throat :)\n\nRoyal sterling caviar with champagne, oyster, oxalis - My first time having a caviar and oyster pairing. It worked very well :)\n\nLoup de mer with green strawberry, broccoli di cicco, almond - I loved that the fish was crispy on the skin side, and yet soft and tender at the same time. The fish was warm but not too oily, and the sides worked very well.\n\nPaine farm squab with porcini mushroom, black barley, smoked onion - I liked how they gave a small cut of different parts of the squab which gave the dish layers in terms of texture. \n\nThe suckling pig tortellini was a little disappointing. While it was beautifully presented and looked exquisite with the tiny hand made tortellini, I found it too hard and chewy for my liking.\n\nWe were offered a cheese course (not in the tasting menu) just before our pre-dessert and the waiter showed us the cheese cart which had a lovely selection of cheeses. We ended up sharing a plate of 3 cheeses. Our favorite was definitely the triple cream from Mt Tam in Petaluma. The blue cheese made from a blend of goat, cow and sheep milk was a close second :)\n\nThey had a great selection of sweets (more compliments from the chef) on top of our rhubarb dessert. They also gave me a small slice of pistachio and chocolate cake with a lighted candle for my birthday :) How awesome! Pity though, as I was too full by the end to fully enjoy the desserts :(\n\nOverall, a very pleasant dining experience and a decadent (and rather expensive) meal.

Changed my mind.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nIn most fine dining establishments there are at least a few dishes that make me crap my pants with delight. Unfortunately I left Quince without even a skid mark. I was served multiple excessively rich dishes back to back to back with no respite & no balance. Gorgeous presentation, but those darn flavors, yeah, apparently not so critical.\n\nTHE DEETS:\n\nItems \"enjoyed\" (their words, not mine):\n\n***TERRINE OF POTATO, smoked onion, panisse w/ green garlic, yogurt, & Meyer lemon; ROMAN PUNTARELLA dressed with Meyer lemon; BLACK RADISH, Brokaw avocado, Dungeness crab, finger lime  \n\nCanap\u00e9 #1. Potato tasted like corned beef hash, radish cup tasted like it was filled with a chicken salad w/ mayo. Meh.\n\n***DUCK CONFIT wrapped in lacto-fermented cabbage, veiled by violet mustard; FEUILLE DE BRICK, house-made cream cheese, smoked salmon; PICKLED BEET, Gorgonzola, hazelnut; WARM CHEESE GOUGERE\n\nCanap\u00e9 #2. Not particularly memorable. The cream cheese & salmon was kinda fun. Gougere kinda like a bite-sized cream cheese fondue.\n\n***BLACK RIVER RUSSIAN CAVIAR, smoked eel, Jerusalem artichoke, horseradish\n\nUnfishy caviar, various textures of sunchoke, which provided a nice contrast. Nothing remarkable, but I kinda liked it.\n\n***GOLDEN OSETRA CAVIAR PANNA COTTA, chive, egg yolk, shallot\n\nOsetra not at all fishy, flavor of salmon skin. Sieved egg yolk was muted & meh, as was the chive & shallot--decorative but not pulling their weight. Panna cotta was more like cream cheese--heavy, non-sweet. The magic here was the brioche toast, which was buttery as high heaven. Spreading panna cotta & caviar on top was triple rich, became difficult to finish.\n\n***STEELHEAD TROUT, fava bean, new potato, buttermilk whey\n\nServed sashimi style, nice fresh texture & completely unfishy, though not really bursting with any particular flavor. Cute that it was served with its own roe. The buffalo buttermilk was slightly lemony, but boring, as was the fava bean. Potatoes were over-salted. Arugula was welcome. A visually appealing dish that lacked sex appeal.\n\n***WHITE ASPARAGUS, sweetbread, watercress, black trumpet mushroom\n\nThe beauty of the white asparagus was nullifyed by wrapping it in crunchy feuille de brick. Mushroom were pretty but pretty flavorless. The emulsion of foie gras & black truffle was unrealized. Lamb sweetbreads tasted cheap & battered, but needed salt. \n\n***LA BELLE FARM FOIE GRAS, Perigord truffle, rhubarb, pink peppercorn\n\nThe most memorable dish, stunning potential, but in execution was death by fat. A torchon of foie gras wrapped in truffle, as rich as Donald Trump, like consuming a pound of butter. The rhubarb compote provided a bit of tangy relief (a marvelous counterpoint, though the pink peppercorn was masked), but that same brioche from before abrogated said relief with a second pound of butter.\n\n***GNOCCO, Perigord truffle, leek, green asparagus\n\nAs if the foie gras wasn't enough to choke a donkey, they followed it up with a big gooey gnocchi filled with some kind of cheese + ricotta. The sauce & the decorative goodies contributed nothing. Feeling a bit nauseous at this point. \n\n***CASONCELLI, Phil Paine's squab, beet, borage\n\nThese candy wrapper shaped pastas were half hollow & half squab. Dry on the outside & dry on the inside. The giblet and the savory cookie made from foie gras should have been replaced by something juicy or fresh. Flavorless, presumably watercress puree. More rich.\n\n***WATSON FARM SPRING LAMB, Nicoise olive, Meiwa kumquat, brassica\n\nExtremely tender & pleasant, though it felt wrong that the creature only had a few months to live. Seemingly no sauce or rub, which was interesting. Spit-roasted lamb shoulder on the side was a bit more robust & salty. Broccoli & turnips, pretty boring. A pool of brown sauce. I hate brown sauce. Served with a roll sourced from United Airlines.\n\n***FUJI APPLE SORBET, Meyer lemon mousse & curd, Moscato d'Asti granita, chopped hazelnut\n\nFuji apple sorbet is a unique idea, nice play. The Moscato d'Asti was invisible, and the Meyer lemon kinda dampened the experience.

Not only is the interior swanky and beautiful (ask for a booth table in the main dining room for the ultimate dinner date experience), but also the food is indescribably delicious. I had a dish called \"Dave's Little Egg\" as part of the tasting menu back in December and OH MY GOD, was it infused with crack or something? It consisted of a yolk surrounded by some kind of cum-textured ricotta cheese mixture meant to emulate egg white and the combination was unforgettably divine, as were all the other courses! Six months later, I still cream my pants when I reminisce about that meal. \n\nTo simply sum up how I feel about Quince...it's better than Gary Danko, Acquerello, and La Folie combined. Delicious and intricate food, precisely-timed service and attention whores are going to love this - they'll even personalize and write your name on the menu for special occasions.", "author": "Suany W."}

Lots to cover, so let's get started, shall we?\n\nOutright, I must say their service is impeccable. It is at least as great as their food, perhaps even better. You will feel you are treated and respected royally here -- fantastic!\n\nThe dishes I am sure I had from their prefixed menu were as follows:\n-Amuse Bouches (several)\n-Golden Osetra Caviar Panna Cotta with Chive, Egg Yolk and Shallot\n-Diver Scallop with Cauliflower, Meyer Lemon and Brown Butter\n-King Crab with Musque de Provence Pumpkin, Mandarin and Lemon Verbena\n-Cinta Senese Pork due Modi with Faggotini, Wild Nettle, Extra Vecchio Balsamico, Chanterelle Mushroom, Swiss Chard, Thumbelina Carrot\n-Valrhona \"Perigold Truffle\" with Guanaja Chocolate, Satsuma, Armagnac\n-Migniardises: Chocolates, Confections\n\nThe dish I cannot recollect the name of was what I requested if an alternative existed for. Not being a fan of mushrooms, I was not tempted by the sound of Gnudi Morel Mushroom dish with Black Truffle and Parmigiano Reggiano. I had zero issues requesting an alternative from the garden menu -- could have been involving pumpkin or tortellini. I was surprised I could exchange a dish on a prefixed menu, and again, that's one of the many reasons I was so satisfied with their service!\n\nEverything I consumed that evening was worth every bite and cent. My absolute favorite dish was the Caviar Panna Cotta -- it did cost $75 extra (just letting you all know...), but for this special occasion, I was not about to say whoa nelly! It practically gave me goosebumps, it was so delicious. I also particularly enjoyed the concept of having edible gold flakes upon the chocolate dessert.\n\nWe had two types of wine that night, accompanying our food: first, a shared bottle of Flower. Then, nearing the end, we each got a glass of Tawny Port '85: dessert wine as old as me!\n\nI do believe such gracious occasions like these, with personalized printed menu, are ones that are earned, as here, you can see the gold and eat it, too.

I didn't want to subject him to eating bonsai trees, hibiscus flowers, and foam at Atelier Crenn or Coi so I choose Quince. \n\nHaving heard very mixed reviews from friends (both Yelpers and non-Yelpers), I came in with low expectations. However, every dish at Quince exceeded my expectations and nothing was short of amazing. So why 2 stars? More on that later.\n\nF O O D\nThanks to Janice C's advice, we each choose the 4-course menu ($95) that took 2 hours and 45 minutes.

The silky Chanterelle Flan was my favorite.\n\nThe Crudo of Octopus, Kampachi and Sea Urchin was like eating an ocean breeze. So fresh and so delicate. The Triangoli w/ Burgandy Truffle made me weak in the knees with the milky, buttery smooth burrata encased in a perfectly al-dente house made pasta. The truffles were a luxurious icing on the cake. The Suckling Pig was a slice of pork heaven; the loin was \u00fcber tender and the crisp pork belly deliciously orgasmic.\n\nThe subtly sweet Chestnut Crepe nicely ended our epicurean affair along with an array of complimentary sweet-tooth satisfying Petit Fours and Chocolate Covered Hazelnuts that were like balls of crack.\n\nS E R V I C E\nQuince is my 26th Michelin starred restaurant and was by far the WORST in service (hence the 2 stars). Too many \"mishaps\" happened last Saturday night that should have never occurred and certainly not at a Michelin starred restaurant.\n\nOur table wasn't ready when we arrived 3 minutes early for our reservations so we grabbed a drink at the bar until our table was ready (took 15 minutes). Upon being seated at the table nearest to the restroom, no menus were given to us. 15 minutes later our waiter appears. Never introducing himself, he handed us our menus but he didn't bring a wine menu. I instead ask him for recommendations on a glass of Pinot Noir and asked out of the two which one was his favorite. His answer? Both. Umm ok, that's very helpful, Buddy.\n\nIt took our waiter 45 minutes to bring me my glass of wine. Yes, 45 minutes! And that's only after having the busboy check the status of our drinks.\n\nWe then received our bread the same time as our first course with no butter. Had to ask for that twice too.\n\nI was asked if I wanted another glass of wine as I was finishing my last savory course. WTF. It's a little too late for that.\n\nWe were never asked if we wanted coffee or tea with our dessert so I had to bug our busboy once again because we rarely saw our waiter.\n\nI would have let this go IF our waiter was nice and apologetic but he was not. While I understand that a fine dining restaurant has a certain level of \"professionalism\" to uphold, our waiter was very cold and pretentious; simply put, he was rude. Actions speak louder than words. He never once smiled, never once said \"you're welcome\" when we thanked him numerous times and he never once asked us how our dinner was going. If Quince was my first fine dining restaurant experience, I would never step foot into another fine dining restaurant again.\n\nDo I think service would have been different if we were older and seemingly more affluent and generous diners? Yes. My bad, we should have rolled up in our Bentley that night.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nA Spruce look-alike, Quince is contemporary sheek with a stunning and spacious dining room, mute ivory and grey walls, vintage chandeliers, pink and grey chiffon curtains, and exposed red bricks\n\nIt's a perfect place for celebrating a special occasion as tables are well-spaced apart and it's easy to hold a conversation even when it's bustling.\n\nP A R K I N G\nHorrendously bad street parking.

Easily one of my top fave Michelin starred places!! \n\nFood was perfect... service was above and beyond. \n\nEverything on the menu was spectacular, including the amuse-bouche with the beef tartare.. they seriously need to have a dish just for that tartare!! \nThe Cote de Boeuf with the foie gras on top... LOOOVEEE, and portion was just right. \nCaviar was amazing.. I took a bite with one of every different piece in the dish, and it was so unique and delicious that my mouth didn't even know what to make of it, besides that I wanted more! \nBlack truffle Tortelli ... just keep the truffle shaving comingggg! each little tortelli was splendid. \n\nThe only dish that did not meet expectation was the alaskan crab.. the meat itself was a tad bland, as if they only boiled the meat with no flavor. Everything else on the plate had a more 'earthy' taste, so earthy + bland crab wasn't too good of a combo. I think they could've done better with the crab\n\nDessert.. too many to describe, but allllll delightful!! \n\nService though. WOW! I cant even.\n1. We were placed at a table near the restroom and sort of next to a busier walkway, so we requested a table where we can sit next to each other for a more intimate experience. Unfortunately there were no tables, but he did move us to a more intimate space/room immediately. \n2. We were very interested in seeing the kitchen, so we were thinking of asking whether we could get a quick tour of it... to our surprise, our waiter asked us first! I don't know if he was eavesdropping..since he was def not in the room when we said it, or whether he was psychic, but we got to meet some of the chefs and got to see how some of the dishes from our dinner were being prepared. Our waiter even offered to take a picture for us in the kitchen. \nWe also noticed that no other table in the same room were asked? (maybe we didnt notice?) but nobody else left the table during dinner so we felt a little special ha! \n3. *after dinner* My boyfriend tells me a super cute story. So he originally made a reservation making a note saying that it was our anniversary, but changed it last minute to have our menu say \"Merry Christmas\" instead (online). Apparently, our waiter waited for me to leave the table for the restroom in the beginning of dinner to approach my boyfriend to say that he noticed our reservation was originally an anniversary and would like to know if he wanted them to bring out a special anniversary dessert still. Of course the boy says yes, and it was amazing!!! more dessert ontop of the dessert cart ftw!

They threw in at least two or three extra bonus plates.\n4. The chef, Michael Tusk, gave us a personal tour of the kitchen after we were finished.\n\nLet's get to the food, as it was great as well.  I'm leaving out a lot of the bonus dishes they threw in and just mentioning the important parts.  They did in fact start off the meal with amuse bouche containing quince.  That was surprisingly good.  The abalone dish was perhaps the highlight of the meal for me.  I don't get it often, the presentation in the shell was perfect, and the texture and chewiness of the abalone was incredibly enjoyable.  The venison was great, although just a bit tough.  The dessert was chocolate with Sightless coffee (local!) ice cream.  Tasty, and I liked that they did a local spin on it.\n\nThis is one of those situations where I would literally feel bad if I didn't post a five star, because it was that good and they pulled out the stops in a way I'm just not used to.

Dinner at Quince\n\n11 months later, the bf FINALLY took me here. (yes, he runs on Asian time)  It was also our anniversary so we knew to go all out with champagne and tasting menu, which consist of 8 courses that highlight Italian, French and Californian influences that Chef Michael Tusk is known for.\n\nThe food is thoughtfully created (coco nero bean paired with partridge and dandelion), flawlessly prepared (sweetbreads with chanterelle mushrooms and the squab with black garlic) and presented beautifully on the plate.  All the \"upscale\" ingredients you'd expect to see in a tasting menu for a fine dining destination like Quince are all present: Royal Osetra caviar, black truffles, lobster, etc. are incorporated seamlessly in each dish.  The fagotelli and tortellini pastas are perfectly al dente and just bursting with flavor. \n\nTheir \"bacon and eggs\" dish is a playful take on breakfast: crunchy lardo, creamy egg yolk and melted fontina cheese to act as the egg white. \n\nI was surprised that the wild turbot didn't come deboned, especially since your fork easily sinks into the fish, indicating its flakiness then you bite into ... bones.  BIG fish bones. tsk, tsk. \n\nService is Quince's strong point. Extremely professional with an army to boot. Looking for the bathroom? let me escort you there. Do you need a cab? no problem. Madam/sir, our next course is ... Do you get what I mean? perfect.  Almost too perfect which I found kind of stiff.  The only stiff thing I want when I'm dining out is ....\n\nMy drink. In addition to an impressive wine list, the cocktails aren't to be missed here!  I was swooning while reading their short cocktail menu. Talk about classic textbook preparation with the right balance of ingredients. The Corpse Reviver is one such thing. \n\nIf you order a Bobby Burns, they will prepare it tableside for you. Notice all the fine silverware and fancy stemware (very important for cocktailing!) being used. It's a joy for me to watch since I'm a cocktail lover. But what went wrong was our server/barman, mistakenly referred to the Bobby Burns cocktail as the Corpse Reviver.  Honey, I know my gin from my scotch, but I don't know about you!  (no we didn't correct him, it was too embarassing!)\n\nWhy only 3 stars? I don't feel the price point for the tasting menu was worth it. In fact, I'm gonna go the extra mile and say, if you dine here, you should just order the regular prix fixe menu instead. (we kept eyeing our neighbors plates! we were THAT jealous) The TINY portions only have about 2 - 3 bites (yes, I know it's a tasting!) plus the long lag time between dishes just don't do it for me. Does a normal 8 course tasting menu run 3 hours? please let me know.  I would bring extra padding for my tushie next time because my chair wasn't the most comfortable.\n\nWhen we walked out of there, we left feeling, hmm, strange. Did we really just spend $500 on dinner?

That was a mistake. Sure, the first couple of bites are amazing, but after a while, you get tired of it and you start getting incredibly full. We weren't able to finish it, it was too heavy. \n\nAlso, one last thing. The restrooms...they really want you to think that you're the first person to use it.

No a la carte menu. Cocktails are $14 each and wines by the glass start at ~$20. \n\nService: The service here is actually quite amazing.

Overall, incredibly satisfied in this regard. \n\nAmbience: very stuffy. For some people this might be quite fine, but I like my dining experiences to have a lot of action going on. This place, sadly, was very dim and quiet. This is probably a me-specific issue, but if you don't like a dim, quiet, candlelight dinner then I would refrain from coming here. Also, our meal took 5 hours! 5 very very slow hours. \n\nFood: quality was obviously very high and full of ingredients that I had never tried before. Was it \"knock your socks off\" quality though? Sadly, no. Perhaps I shouldn't work for Michelin, but I've had better food at non-rated places both in SF and across the world. Also, I was seriously still a quite hungry after our 7 course (actually 10 course with all the extras) meal. \n\nCocktails: dirty martini is very solid.

We walked from our hotel to Quince to try to snag a seat in the Salon/Bar area (which does not require reservations).  There are only 3 tables, so we were lucky to grab one.  We had a couple great cocktails, followed by a glass of wine.  We also ordered some of the snacks off the bar menu, which they accompanied with canapes and bread service.  The sourdough bread was some of the best I've ever had.  They even gave us some (ridiculously good) hot chocolate for our walk back to the hotel in the rain!\n\nEverything was great and the staff was super friendly and attentive.  Would love to come back and try their full dinner experience.", "author": "Peter C."}

My first time back after the recent remodeled and so glad that they received a second Michelin star.  The bar is much smaller than it used to be and the cocktail menu has changed since they just had a new bar tender but that's not short of an experience by any mean.\n\nThe changed in menu also mean you are no longer able to do an a la cart but do have option of either a garden menu or a quince menu both for $190, a 7 courses meal including dessert and end with the decadent Migniardise cart.\n\nWe did not do the wine pairing ($135 ) this time but both my husband and I tried both menu.  I chose the garden menu and he chose the quince.  In essence we get to taste everything and let me just say there is absolutely nothing did not enjoy. Although I love the Quince menu more.  The Black river Russian caviar was heavenly. \n\nWe were here with another couple for a double date night and there were just moment of silence where we all just made the \"hmmmmm\" \"yummmmmm\" sound. It was just that good \n\nThe amuse-bouche was just amazing as well, I wish we can just order extra amuse-bouche. ..lol\n\nQuince got me at my first dining experience there 2 years ago, and they got me again when we stop in for a drink while waiting for our table at their sister restaurant Cotogna next door.  The host actually walked our drinks over to Cotogna when our table was ready on a silver tray ( that's was sure exceeded my expectations).  Now I can formally say it is my favorite restaurant in SF.\n\nQuince is the epitome of fine dining, impeccable service,  artful presentation,  delicate,  refine and creative and flavorful thought out journey of food courses.

They then opened the evening for us with a selection of champagnes. \n\nThe meal itself was remarkable.

I know, completely different in theory,  but they are very similar. The staff glides stiffly through the restaurant. It's almost entertaining. It is mostly grays and a little dark. Everyone was dressed to the nines and then some. The crowd was a mix of thirty somethings and older.\n\nEvery dish was beautifully plated and was delicious with portions on the smaller side though not as small as other restaurants of the same caliber. Desserts did leave a little to be desired. Service was spotless and beautifully orchestrated. They recognized our anniversary by printing a special menu as well as bringing over a dessert with a candle for each. \n\nI do think it is a little stuffy for my taste so just be warned if this is not your cup of tea.  Not too stuffy that you are uncomfortable but not too many warm smiles to be had either.\n\nI would love to maybe try it with a bigger group and do the chef's tasting menu one day. However, with so many wonderful places in San Fran, not sure that I would choose this again.

I couldn't have the dairy based soup so I watched everyone else have it.  They said it was just ok.  The entree was the biggest fail, literally one boiled beet served on an almond dusting.  It tasted exactly like a beet, which was all it was.  I would have left it but I was starving.  The dessert was 9 little berries on a plate.\n\nI will say that the service was impeccable in that they open the door and push your seat in every time you get up.  However, the waiter was visibly annoyed by my vegan request though and asked if I was really vegan or just didn't like the prix fix.\n\nThe atmosphere was very fancy as to be expected in fine dining but not necessarily memorable.

Unfortunately, some of the finer details were left out of service and the meal was underwhelming at times. Maybe it was an off night...We thoroughly enjoyed the incredible wine pairing (although Sake was an interesting choice for the caviar course). The cocktails were outstanding. \n\nWe decided to try the Quince Menu for two with a split wine pairing. One supplemented for the more expensive caviar and the foie gras dish. The Tagliolini Carbomare was the one stand-out dish. It was perfect, border line too salty but right on the edge. We enjoyed the lamb dish but it was a bit disjointed and surprisingly had a middle-eastern flare. The spot prawn, foie gras, and desserts were disappointing. The dessert was particularly bad. The elderflower bubbles course was cool and unexpected. However, the main dessert course was a pastry that was so hard we could barely cut into it. It seemed to have been left out a little too long or made days in advance. Really disappointed in the desserts- and mignardises were nothing special. \n\nOur server was knowledgeable, particularly in the department of the wine pairing. He did lack passion and simply went through the steps. The back waiter was friendly and courteous. Pacing of the courses was just right. Unfortunately we were marked incorrectly on more than one occasion. There were crumbs on the table when we sat down...They didn't follow the \"ladies first\" rule of thumb.

Did not give five stars for two small things, but yet important- reservations were made about 3 weeks ago over the phone, at that time they only had 5:30pm or 9:30pm. We chose 5:30 and I asked the reservationist to put us on a list for a bit later- which she said was very likely given we had 3 weeks to go. Not sure if they block the time for regulars or friends of staff? She said she noted the request and would confirm the week of. Week of our reservation never heard from her and the gentleman who called said he didn't see any request for a later time? Bit disappointing.\n\nLastly no one inquired about the occasion we were celebrating- when we made the reservation, arrived at the restaurant or ordered. A bit disappointing that a small piece of detail like that was missed- especially after a $700 meal.

Mind you, we weren't dressed down either. They sported fake smiles and I'm conflicted whether they were hating on us as people or hating on us for actually being able to afford such a restaurant. \n\n**Bar: don't talk to them... HOW DARE you talk to them!? Let them imagine that they're in the movie Cocktail with Tom Cruise! S.O. asked them what's good and they replied: EVERYTHING. No such thing as asking your patron what they like in drinks... and so forth. Anything to not talk... well mission accomplished. \n\n**Dinner: we were a party of 5 and so I won't discuss what the other 4 ate but they were all delicious (we managed to share it with everyone...)\n\nFIRST COURSE:\n- maine lobster vellutata (parsnip and chestnut confit) = the presentation was phenomenal! its a soup with lots of lobster meat... just the right amount of creaminess and taste. I managed to savor each taste!\n\n- sonoma foie gras torchon = made the S.O. order this and he didn't mind at all! First bite: it was oh so creamy and we could hardly taste the livery taste... it went so well with the white wine that my sis ordered... S.O. gave me two bites and the rest was all his. I can proudly say that this is better than La Folie!\n\nSECOND COURSE:\n- doppio ravioli (chanterelle mushroom and pumpkin with burrata cheese) = probably my favorite dish of the night! It was honestly... delicious! Perfect amount of mushroom and pumpkin... wow oh wow!\n\nTHIRD COURSE: \n- Il St. Canut Farm Suckling Pig (Tardivo Radicchio and Potimarron Pumpkin with Quince Mostarda) = my least favorite out of all my dishes... the pig lacked taste... it was bland. I ended up just eating a couple of bites and calling it a day.\n\nDESSERT: \n- vanilla marshmallow (warm chocolate, almond and caramel ice cream) = this was good but not mind blowing good... I think by the time this portion came through... I was full from all the other three dishes and the wine... \n\nTheir petit fours were a bit limited compared to La Folie but they were still good... just not \"a lot\" ... \n\nOur main server was the \"token\" Asian guy on staff... I'm not sure if they assigned him to us because we were Asians (technically \"Pacific Islander\") or if we were seated in his spot but it seemed like he was assigned to us just cause we were the only Asian looking folks in the restaurant that night. \n\nI am not hating on him... if anything he made our night worth while! He was very funny... not so stuck up like the rest of the servers there (hello bartenders!) but he made sure that we were good all through out our meal! He gave us good suggestions (particularly to my bro and S.O.) and he accommodated all our wants and needs! \n\nIt was because of him that I am giving this review 4 stars. My siblings and I managed to ignore the snooty host and \"don't you dare talk to me\" bartenders! \n\nIf you're Asian looking and you get the token Asian server in the staff... be thankful and enjoy his service because he make sure you are served well and even make good jokes along the way! \n\nOverall... another delicious meal courtesy of my dear sister.

Chef Michael Tusk's menu is French and Italian inspired and sources local ingredients from Northern California. Walking into the restaurant, you couldn't help but feel at ease. The host made eye contact, smiled, and welcomed us warmly. Coats were taken and we were shown to our table in under a minute.\n\nAfter settling in, we started off with a glass of Rose in a striking champagne glass with a needle-thin stem. Our server, Jonathan, told us they chose Zalto, a boutique glassware maker from Austria, over Riedel and Ravenscroft because their stemware are extremely lightweight yet durable.\n\nThere were a few tasting menus to choose from; some were vegetarian and some were abbreviated (5 course). We decided on the full-blown Quince menu (9 courses) and just minutes later, our journey began with a delectable bowl of crunchy chips; the purity of flavor in this playful dish made for an excellent amuse-bouche.\n\nA flurry of canapes followed. First, a creamy ricotta and truffle concoction that I wish there were more of.\n\nNext was a tray of four bites that burst with contrasting textures and flavors.\n1) Parsnip, pickled cranberry, vanilla\n2) Noris, persimmon, mizuna\n3) Taggiasche olive, rosemary, mascarpone, candied citrus\n4) Faro, green apple, red kuri squash\n\nEven though the dining room began to fill up, the noise level was very low. Service was attentive and not intrusive. They were kind enough to give us a printed menu at the end of the meal which meant I could put away my journal and enjoy the meal with Anna.\n\nThe first dish epitomized what I liked about Quince. Flawless technique that yielded simple and pure flavors. Distilled to its core, this dish had 3 main components: a smooth beet sherbet with a tarty granny smith apple granita topped with small cubes of refreshing horseradish that were frozen with liquid nitrogen. Fancy techniques, unconventional format, but at the end of the day, the flavors were familiar.\n\n(For the rest of the review, please visit http://www.scrumphsus.com/blog/2014/2/16/quince)", "author": "Scrumphsus B."}

The garden menu was strictly vegetarian which left my boyfriend speechless being a true carnivore and all. Quince used fresh vegetables and fruit available at the Ferry Building Farmer's market that morning. The presentation was simply a work of art. The Quince menu was comprised of seafood (steelhead trout, herring, scallop), sweetbreads, and allowed me to substitute black cod instead of lamb since I'm not into lamb. I enjoyed each course especially the black cod.\n\nWhat I loved most about Quince is how they customize your dining experience. They ask what you like or do not like, and any possible food allergies you may have prior to your arrival. When we were looking over the menu it said \"Happy Birthday Jeff\" at the top. Their customer service is top notch. When I got up from my seat, there was always someone that rushed over to fold my napkin. When I returned to my seat, there was someone who pushed the seat in for me. My boyfriend asked if we can thank the chef for a wonderful meal. Quince allowed us to meet the chef and even gave us a tour of the kitchen. \n\nWhen I say set the bar high, Quince you have truly outdid yourselves. Thank you for a WONDERFUL dining experience.", "author": "Jen V."}

We also ended being seated in the table next to Rashida Jones and Quincy Jones. That, in itself, left me starstruck :)\n\nThe decorum of the restaurant, table setting and service were all phenomenal, carefully arranged, as expected from their 2-Michelin start rating. The wine list was extensive, almost setting me off to get the wine pairing as well. But decided to save for a later time. \n\nTo start off the tasting menu (9-course), which is actually the most affordable in the Bay Area for a restaurant of this caliber, we shared a course of smaller wafer-like eatable art pieces. I don't remember what each ones was, but they all tasted really interesting.\n\nSince the tasting menu changes regularly depending on season and ingredients available, I'm not going to spend the time going through each course, except to say everything was really really delicious and beautiful! However, there were a few dishes that really stood out for me. \n\nHighlights from the meal:\n-Royal Osetra Caviar on brioche toast was wonderful. It was buttery and rich in the most perfect way\n-Trofie with Nantucket scallops, yuzu and currants. This had an extremely unique flavor that which I could describe like a mix of what Unami and truffle would taste like. The pasta was also hand made and cooked to perfect el detente\n-Milbrook Ranch venison with huckleberry sauce was also quite memorable. The gaminess of the venison was paired very well with the berries. Almost felt like an upscale reconstruction of a caveman dish. Definitely very memorable. Wish I had more.\n-did not remember what this was called but they were little green hand wrapped mini ravioli. They looked like leaves until you glance closely and taste. Tossed very nicely in sauce. \n-dessert, which turned out to be like another 5 courses. My favorite was the wine poached pear with gold shavings. It was a bit over the top, but hey, I'm not going to complain about eating gold :P. I've had better desserts but there was a large range of execution/technique in the desserts presented. \n\nOverall, Quince was a really awesome experience. Our dinner ended up taking 3 hours because service really allowed us to enjoy each dish and talk. Even though we had the last seating, they did not rush us in any way. However, I will say that the execution of some dishes could be a little better. For example, I was really looking forward to the seared sea bass, which unfortunately turned out flakier and drier than I would have liked. The skin was also left on, for an additional crispy texture, but was too touch to cut and hard to eat. Aside from that, everything else was superb.\n\nI recommend reserving at least two weeks in advance. If it's for a special occasion, quince does try to accommodate for special arrangements. Just let them know in advance. My only regret was having not eaten here when the chef Michael Tusk was working. I hoped that he would be able to show us the kitchen for my boyfriend's birthday. Unfortunately he was away. Next time!", "author": "Jenny Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-10-15", "description": "The first time I dined at Quince was at the original location on Octavia in Pac Heights.  I hadn't been back until now since they moved into their new digs on Pacific Ave and since Chef Michael Tusk won the illustrious 2011 James Beard Award for Best Chef in the Pacific region of the U.S.  This recent experience was very memorable and the food is certainly worthy of the praise and recognition it has received.\n\nOpted to partake of the 4 course menu:\n\nAmouse bouche: A shot glass full of some green liquid (pureed artichoke?) topped with a burrata foam, a cubed fresh beet on the side, as well as a delicious fried little ball of something.\n\nFollow-up amouse bouche: Salted brioche!  It's basically a mini croissant that looks like a mini cinnabun, but it's by far the most amazing croissant you'll ever have in your entire life!  I absolutely loved the buttery and flaky texture and the salted topping complemented it very well; one of the most amazing things I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  The wait staff followed this up by constantly filling up my bread plate with mini Acme bread rolls.\n\nCourse 1:  Sformato of acorn squash with chanterelle mushroom and grana padano fonduta / Morro Bay albacore crudo with dragonfruit, flambeau radish, caroselli and bearss lime.  Both were great first courses but the albacore crudo was extremely tender melt-in-your-mouth good!  \n\nCourse 2:  Tagliolini \"monte e mare\" with four story hill farm sweetbread and delta crawfish / Agnolotti of paine farm squab \"salsa di foie gras\" and aceto balsamico tradizionale.  Both were excellent, intricately plated, savory pasta courses though I preferred the tagliolini if I had to pick a winner of the two.\n\nCourse 3:  Black sea bass with sunchoke, brussels sprouts and heirloom carrot with verjus / Liberty duck with ash roasted cipollini, turnip and tory farm muscat grape.  I honestly think it's hard to compete with the way Chinese restaurants cook sea bass for wedding banquets, but they did an excellent job with this tender, buttery and flaky fish.  The duck entree paired with muscat grapes was simply sensational, the most well-prepared and presented duck dish I've ever had, extremely tender and flavorful and the sweet muscat grapes complemented the savory flavor of the duck perfectly.\n\nCourse 4:  Banana pound cake with raisin coulis, chocolate nougatine and toasted oat ice cream / Guanaja praline with oreo crumble, milk jam and buttermilk sherbet.  I initially thought that I would like the banana pound cake dessert more that the Guanaja praline dessert, but the latter prevailed in the taste test.  Don't get me wrong, both were fantastic desserts, but I'm glad I ordered the praline dessert.\n\nDessert after dessert:  A petit four assortment with a very notable truffle of white chocolate and passion fruit.\n\nService was excellent throughout the evening.  Ambiance is classy, on the trendier side and very sleek though not stuffy; it's also a much larger space than their former Octavia St. location.  Each dish was exquisitely presented with vibrant colors and very photo-worthy.  You can also watch these amazing chefs at work from the street as there is a large window that peers directly into this amazing kitchen from the sidewalk.\n\nIf I could afford it I would happily, and very enthusiastically, eat here everyday for the rest of my life.", "author": "Erich D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-27", "description": "I know I have given out alot of 5 stars in my Yelp experience. Quince would have been the only 5 stars I've given, in my mind, who rightfully earned it. It was earned by its impeccable service and its tear-inducing quality of food. Likewise, this will probably be my longest review. \n\nI have eaten a lot of fine dine restuarants from around the world although not many in America. Michael Tusk and his staff at Quince now set a bar high for me in terms of high quality (abeit expensive and a splurge) tasting menus in this country. \n\nIt wasn't a 3 hr dinner but an experience in learning how food and wine can be connected and how food can look as good as it tastes. The amazing staff and 'captain' of our table treated us very much like royalty and answered all my questions when I had them (and I had alot!). I learned a great deal about food and wine last night that I will carry with me through my 'fine dine' life.   \n\nThere are 2 tasting menus available. Bf got the Quince menu and I got the Garden manu. In my mind, the Quince menu was much better although my bf's fave dish of the night might have been my white aspargus topped with a mushroom +30 yr old sherry sauce. We got one wine paring (with the Quince menu) and it was incredible. Many exclusive wines from around the world that apparently are hard for the public to try on their own. Some of the wines are producer grown which means they grow their own grapes (not that common).\n\nThe canapes provided before the meal were amazing with my favorite being the chickpea powder with green garlic - seared into a little ball and served on a stick. Yums. \n\nFavorite dishes of the tasting menu:\n- Quince menu: Golden osetra caviar panna cotta - so rich and delicious, served with buttered toast\n- Quince menu: Tagliolini with big island abalone - have mercy on me. this was my favorite dish of all dishes. It took me back to Italy and my bf gave me the last bite (bless his soul). \n- Quince menu: Casoncelli with squab - one of bf's favorite dish and he said it almost made him tear up. For the record, he doesn't cry that much so kudos to Michael Tusk and his staff for that :)\n- Quince menu: Watson Farm lamb - doesn't taste like lamb at all!! We asked and its lamb from California who eat their own mom's milk and are free to graze all over the lands to give back to the ecosystems. Delicious!\n- Garden menu: Insalata crudo e cotto - this came in a 'movible' / flexible plate and they encourage you to play with the plate after eating the salad. It was so neat! Apparently Chef Tusk went to Japan and bought it back from there. I made my plate into a triangle thingy after and the waiter who took it away smiled and said that it was very creative. :)\n- Garden menu: white asparagus with a mushroom and 30 yr old sherry sauce - bf's favorite. the sauce was spooned out of a mini copper pot onto the asparagus in front of you. the waiter said 'i'm trying to get every last bit out for you because trust me you will like it'. we loved it. the sauce was over the top good.  \n- Gargen menu: main lobster - got the tail and claw. it was alot of meat and the sauce it came with was very tasty.\n\nThe desserts we got on the tasting menu were good but i'm not sure if it is what made the meal for me. Also there is a dessert cart and since it was late in the night by this time, our captain saved us some (I was so happy!). an assortment of chocolates and tiny pasties were put on a tiny plate for us. We had complimentary espressos with them. \n\nThe hefty bill then came. Good food isn't cheap. It was ~$750 without tip. Ouch. But it was a great experience. \n\nAt the end of the night we were given a copy of the menu and warm hot chocolate in to-go cups. Overall, I think you can tell from my review that I was a very satisfed customer. I dont know if the lower stared - reviews were due to ever changing menu... but for me, it was a very very very nice evening. Worthly of their 2 michelin stars. Thanks Quince!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-04-12", "description": "To sum up my meal at Quince: Disappointing. \n\nConsidering the praise from the press, the accolades from the Michelin Guide (2 stars mind you), Quince has failed to deliver both times I've been there(once when it had 1 star and a second visit after it's 2nd star). \n\nWhile the ambiance is very nice and the service is attentive and professional, the food just didn't have that 'wow' factor, especially from a 2-star spot and a (close to) $200 pp meal. A few complaints about the food itself: \n\n- Firstly, out of the 8-10 courses we had, 1 course had truly 'luxury' ingredients which was caviar, which was actually one of the better courses we had. But otherwise, we got the other pretty standard 'fine dining ingredients (i.e. squab, some fish, some shell fish, a pasta, etc.). For nearly $200 pp, I would expect a bit more luxe ingredients. \n\n-Second, the food overall was nothing outstanding. Quince is trying a little too hard with the whole farm-to-table concept with an Italian flare. All the dishes kind of tasted the same and I've tasted one or a few of the items at one fine dining restaurant or another. \n\n-Thirdly is cost, I brought up cost several times already. But I did feel somewhat ripped off after our meal ended. The first thought as I got our bill was \"that's it?\". \n\nOverall, there are far better choices to be had in the $200+ price range (i.e. Benu and Saison) or there are far better choices that are far less than $200 price range (i.e. Commis and Acquerrello). I don't get what all the hype is about Quince. Although, Cotogna next door is a much more interesting dining experience and better food IMO.", "author": "Justin L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-20", "description": "Alright,\nso I'll start with the only downside.  The price.  It's expensive, but greatness is never cheap, right?  Having been to Alinea in Chicago (years ago) when micro-gastronomy, performance food art and plating using tweezers was just appearing on the food scene, Providence (the seafood sister of Quince in Los Angeles), and Maude (Curtis Stone's, star ingredient, prix fixe restaurant in Beverly Hills), I have found that creativity, beautiful plating and service and excellent food ain't cheap.  I was visiting SF and had the great joy of having dinner at Quince during White Truffle Tasting Menu.  All I can say is, please save your money and splurge on this meal- it's funny (serving a course on an iPad?  Oh yes, they do), it's complex and delicious and it's some of the greatest service I've ever had.  The food was unbelievable and the wine pairing we had was beautifully explained and perfectly paired.  John, our sommelier, was WONDERFUL.  His explanations of the wine were educational, accessible and interactive.  All of the servers had subtle humor which developed more throughout the night.  By the dessert course, we were full and decided to forgo dessert in lieu of just a cheese course.  Since the cheese tray was in use, we were offered (quite unexpectedly and so exciting) a tour of the kitchen.  Chef Chris described the different stations and we stood in wonder at the complex and serene dance of a busy and incredibly well organized kitchen.  I could write a novel on the food and the flavor profiles but 3 Michelins tell that story already.  Truly, the service pushed this restaurant ahead of so many others as Quince understands that the personality of a restaurant arises from both the food and the personnel who make and serve the food and guests.  Quince makes that connection elegantly and beautifully.  Can't wait to go back.", "author": "Hilary G."}

There are plenty of those here to read--and quite frankly, it's not that serious.  At this caliber of restaurant, the food is pretty much the same:  tiny portions of food exquisitely presented at the center of a huge but beautiful plate, and probably a lot of technique in making them.  Blah blah blah.  What sets these restaurants apart is the experience.  Here, the experience is on point. \n\nThe dining room looks and feels like a 4 star restaurant.  Be sure to dress up.  You don't need a jacket, but you'll feel better about yourself if you wear one.  The service starts out a bit stiff and formal.  But they quickly figure out the vibe of the table, and adjust accordingly.  We like to have fun at dinner (i.e., we drink and we're loud).  I thought they were going to shoosh us, but they had fun with us.  It probably helped that we (err my friend) ordered a ton of expensive wine.  The wine list is extensive, the Som was wonderful, and the cocktails were excellent.  \n\nI liked Quince a lot better than that emperor's new clothes place, i.e., Benu, which seemed to be full of rich techies in jeans--and where they literally starve you for four hours.  I'm not kidding.  I asked for bread at Benu and they wouldn't bring any.  At Quince, the portions are small but there are enough courses to leave you full.  Besides, you can fill up on the mignardise (those small candy and pastry thingies) they bring at the end of the meal if you're still hungry.\n\nIf you are vegetarian, beware that the \"Garden menu\" (versus the \"Quince menu\") is not vegetarian as the name implies.  I assumed that \"garden\" meant no fish or meat so I selected it without reading the menu carefully.  As such, there were a few seafood dishes included that I couldn't eat.  Maybe the restaurant should fix that.  As for value, you shouldn't be even thinking about that when going here or any other $200 prix fixe restaurant.

Well, it looks like it all changed.\n\nWhen we went 4 months ago, there were two tasting menus options at $90 each. Each tasting menu consisted of 5 courses (4 savory, 1 dessert). One tasting menu focused on seafood and the other focused on meat. There was also an a la carte menu available. We all went with the tasting menu and we were able to order different tasting menus.\n\nNow it looks like there is no longer an a la carte menu. Now it's either 4-courses for $95 or 7-course tasting for $125. I'm not surprised that the prices went up as soon as they won the James Beard award.\n\nThe food itself was excellent. The pasta dishes stood out most. The ambiance of the place is great. The service was good but a bit stuffy. However, our experience fell short at the end. You can refer to Diane M.'s review for details but basically we were charged $40 for substituting a dish on two tasting menus. They corrected the issue later on but this should not have happened in the first place.\n\nLesson learned, look at your bill before you pay and walk out the door.", "author": "Andy W."}

We showed up for our anniversary and were seated almost immediately. Given the choice between the Spring Menu, Garden Menu, and Quince Menu, we both opted for the Spring Menu.\n\nTo start, we were given some stuzzichini di benvenuto, or welcome bites (welcome nibbles? I dunno, all of it sounds flirty and vampire-y). They were essentially some vegetable crisps with a bean tart and some random single-bite goodies (http://bit.ly/1jg8ZZR). I know, that's not very helpful, but they were all tasty and definitely welcoming.\n\nThings that stood out among the menu:\n\n+Zuckerman Farm asparagus, served with a quail egg, dots of mustard cr\u00e8me and a sprinkle of pumpernickel. (Great shot from Edward A.: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/quince-san-francisco?select=sHi2euiunaNwbUmVDO0OAg#sHi2euiunaNwbUmVDO0OAg). It was light, refreshing, and so simply delicious. Why can't Michael Tusk make me dinner every night?\n\n+Scallop with Persian cucmber, sunflower, opal basil (thanks, Edward A.! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/quince-san-francisco?select=oLSv6TL7z4wuZQe6r_VzjQ#oLSv6TL7z4wuZQe6r_VzjQ). The scallop was LIKE BUTTAH. Seriously good.\n\n+For dessert, the sightglass ganache, served with Dirty Girl Farm strawberry (I'm just gonna use all of Edward A.'s photos here: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/quince-san-francisco?select=Qid5vGE3PsIii2i03yuOaw#Qid5vGE3PsIii2i03yuOaw) was perfection. I know the combination of chocolate with strawberry is good, but this was on a whole new level of tasty. \n\nOf course, it doesn't end there as you're given a mignardise, complete with truffles and caramels and mini cakes that would be perfect if you aren't already SO FULL.\n\nAlso, noteworthy:\n\n+I'd ordered the Spring in Two Acts drink (essentially a vodka martini with a spritz of yuzu at the first half of the drink, followed by a spritz of ginger when you're halfway done), which was served in this gorgeous glass goblet. After a few sips, I realized that the goblet had a tiny nick in the glass. I stopped drinking it for fear of swallowing the piece. When the server noticed this, he not only brought over a new beverage, but the bartender as well who apologized profusely and graciously offered a new drink. I do loves me some good ol' fashioned service.\n\nWe left over $400 lighter, but with a full belly and huge smiles. Truly a great meal.", "author": "Adena B."}

This is the way it felt when we finally arrived at Quince.

After a series of cab rides, and walking into restaurants that were not quite up to our heart's desires for the evening, we got to Quince. Sound crazy? Yes, probably was, but it sure was fun. \n\nDo the tasting menu here, with the wine pairing. Each course is like an adventure, a story and well sometimes a battle between who gets what.

We were very impressed with the decor and the indulgent Champagne cart service. Pairing menu was certainly haute cuisine; interesting flavors and textures and excellent wine pairings by the sommelier. \n\nThat said, I'm sure we will never go back. Even if you're wealthy, there is a tipping point on fine dining, where a culinary experience, which will only be a memory after three hours, just isn't worth the cost. Our meal was almost $2,000 for two people. No matter how great it was, I could have bought myself a nice watch and a designer handbag for that--and enjoyed them for years to come. And for that money, I didn't expect the server to come up to the table and say \"welcome back\" when we'd never been there before. \n\nI will say that I feel fortunate to have enough money to eat at a place like this.

Since the Quince Menu transforms weekly, and the courses (including the amuse-bouches) are MANY, here's a summary of my experience to whet your appetite:\n \nThe SPACE: This was the most beautiful interior of a restaurant that I have ever dined in.  The high ceilings, tall drapery, exposed brick, dark beams, floral touches and ambient lighting created a celebratory, yet intimate, space.\n\nThe FOOD: We opted for the 9-course Quince Menu.  However, combined with multiple rounds of amuse-bouches and a small candle-lit birthday cake at the end, it seemed that about 13 courses came to our table.  Each dish was fantastic, and often all I could say was \"Wow\", as I didn't want to miss a moment of flavor before the last morsel was gone from my mouth.  The experience built upon itself with each dish, and as I felt slightly saddened to meet the end of each course and wine pairing (I didn't want it to end), the arrival of the next course with its paired wine awakened the senses and my excitement.  [Also, at my date's encouragement, I opted for the Golden Osetra Caviar as the 1st formal course....and it was phenomenal.]\n\nThe SERVICE: The service was sophisticated and well-orchestrated, yet pleasantly unpretentious.  Amidst the elegance that abounded all around us, the attendants made us feel welcome and comfortable from start to finish.  Notably, while they never hovered over us during our meal, they had timing down to a science, as they seemed to know what we needed and when we needed it without us having to ask.\n\nTo say that I enjoyed Quince would be the gastronomic understatement of the year.  While I cannot find the perfect words to describe how much I loved it, I can say with certainty that being taken here for my birthday made me feel honored, and my dining experience was one of the best ~ if not the best ~ I've ever had.", "author": "StrwBerry T."}

I realized how incredibly difficult it is to find genuine value for money in this scene, and more importantly, cuisine that truly matches the hype.\n\nNeedless to say, the ingredients are fresh, the food is tasty, the service (mostly) faultless.  And yet, and yet...Quince just can't compete at that top level.  The meal was instantly forgettable and not more than competent at the echelon they're competing at.   There's nothing that blows your tastebuds away, which I think one can fairly expect from a place like this.  That's right - high prices demand high creativity and wondrous flavors.\n\nSo it is just-good...which is damning it with faint praise.  Quince should be delightful, and it is nowhere near that.\n\nSeriously, for a third of the price, go to Commis in Oakland and get a vastly better tasting menu.\n\nAs for me, I'll stick with more rustic fare for now, or in any case, to food like that of State Bird, which is light years better without all the hoity-toity airs of high cuisine.\n\nGood riddance.", "author": "Morty C."}

I fondly remember Quince being one of them. I planned for a long time but never seemed to get there for a meal. \n\nCut to present day and Quince has moved into what is Myth's old, very popular space. Where Myth had very eclectic interior design with tangential shaped booths, and quasi futuristic design elements and art, Quince has refined and toned the ambiance down. The space is much darker, with warm, dark wood tones, art that belongs to the Tusks' personal collection, and a much cleaner, elegant layout. They've kept the awesome bar and upscaled the furniture. \n\nNow a reservation here has always been something you'd have to plan way ahead of time (like that of Gary Danko) but on Halloween, it was more than easy. In fact, one third of the space seemed empty all night. After arriving with my party we found an elegance that was quite high for what you'd find at a one star Michelin restaurant. All the servers were dressed very formally and so were most of the patrons. We were seated in one of the cool corner tables that happens to be able to seat three with a large tree branch/vase towering above us (which we would later find out would shed onto us as if we were sitting outside during Fall). We really wanted to do the tasting menu but with one person having Celiac, we could not since it's heavy on pastas. So we ended up making our own tasting menu as follows:\n\n-Amuse of squash soup\n-foie gras torchon, quince, walnut and pan di zucchero\n-nantucket bay scallop, coco bianco bean vellutata, pepper conserva and romanesco\n-chestnut tagliatelle, paine farm squab sugo and aceto balsamico tradizionale\n-\"trofie della casa\", dungeness crab and red pepper\n-guinea hen ballantine\n-duck two ways, breast with confit leg\n-semifreddo\n-Beaune du Ch\u00e2teau 1er Cru, Bouchard P\u00e8re & Fils, Burgundy, France 2005\n-Moscato D' Asti \"Cascinetta,\" Vietti, Piedmont, Italy 2009\n\nEverything was delicious. Now my friend who couldn't have pasta thought the poached egg wasn't all that exciting but since I didn't taste it, I can't comment. It's really too bad he couldn't have the pasta because I think if you're coming here, it's what they're known for and you'll be obliged to do the same if you go next door to their newly opened Cotogna. Service is definitely very refined/attententive . If you make it a point to talk to your servers, they may have an heir of snootiness at first, but they are well down to earth and fun.

My dining experience here has been the total opposite. \nHad reservations for 5pm. Soon as the doors opened for business we (my girlfriend & I) were seated immediately. Greeted with your choice of still or sparkling water, we received our menus which were custom printed saying Happy Birthday which we were also celebrating. I thought the customized menu was pretty awesome.\nConsidering we were the first to sit, our waiter Drew along with busboy Luka and the rest of the waitstaff were very attentive from the beginning to end of our almost 4 hr. dinner.\nWithin 15 mins we had water, menus and 5 gifts (little appetizer bites) which were excellent. We popped a bottle of 2004 German Riesling. They have a wide variety and great selections of glasses & bottles. \nPrior to ordering they ask if you prefer certain foods you can't eat or any allergens. My girlfriend doesn't eat cheese or dairy so they customized a couple dishes which were off the menu just to cater to her liking. As we continued thru the 9-course meal, still, waitstaff very attentive, topping off waters, folding napkins when you get up to use the bathroom, helping you back in your seat, changing plates and utensils after every dish, being super informative on ingredients of every dish, all this I thought was pretty much how a 2 Michelin Star restaurant should be.\nI thought the food was pretty tasty. Certain dishes standing out more than others but doing 9 courses definitely gave us a variety of the menu. Also bringing out an on the house birthday chocolate cream puff topped with caramel & gold flakes.\nDecor felt like I was dining in NYC being surrounded by brick. Lighting was dim but not dark still well lit. Spacing of tables weren't to close together so didn't feel the crampness or stuffiness other reviews mentioned.\nAfter bill was paid, Drew came out with a birthday bag to go filled with some muffins, a box of chocolates & confections, a copy of the customized printed birthday menu and a 2014 copy of Relais & Chateaux Taste of Americas book. \nJust before we were about to leave, Rex the manager on site invited us to take a tour of the kitchen. Excitedly said yes without hesitation we were guests in the kitchen. Got to see how the kitchen was segregated in cooking section and see how the kitchen staff operates. This was truly a treat because I also got to meet and shake hands with Master Chef Michael Tusk who is the brains behind the menu. \nOverall, I had a fantastic dining experience.

We were so excited to have an unforgettable culinary experience. Unfortunately it was underwhelming.\n\nTo be fair, the ambience is lovely. The service is very good. Nothing stands out as exceptional. However at these prices and for these Michelin stars everything from start to finish should be heavenly. My husband and I both selected the prix fixe menu paired with wine. I did notify the restaurant weeks ahead of our reservation, that I have some exceptions. I don't eat red meat, but I do enjoy seafood. I received a sparse plate of mushrooms with my husband's Tortelli Squab tasting plate. Additionally the wines were not appropriately paired with my reformatted menu. I received the same 1980 Latour Cabernet with my Loup de Mer as my husband did with his venison. I also noticed that the pace of the food was coming out much more slowly for our table than for those who dined around us. The table next to us was half way through their dinner when we sat down. They left. A new table was seated a quarter of the way through our tasting and finished before we did. They too had the wine pairing and the same prix fixe.\n\nFor what this restaurant is touted to be, Quince did not provide a lovely dining experience for my husband and I. This was a $900.00 meal. There is a serious disconnect between the kitchen, the food quality, and the pace. The attention to detail is lacking as well as imagination and creativity with the cuisine. I will not be back and would encourage potential patrons to look at other dining options such as Saison, Benu, and even Spruce.\n\nI would remind this establishment of the Pete Wells NYT review of Per Se last year, Daniel who went from 3* to 2*, or Le Cirque.......", "author": "G.

We both partook of the full tasting menu and with the wine pairings and the cheese plate.  Needless to say we were a bit stuffed. \n\nFirst, the service: it was amazing as it should be if you are spending this much money.  We were first seated near a bit of a draft and two ladies in dresses can get chilly pretty fast, so we asked and were promptly moved to a much warmer spot.  We had the most adorable waitress who was very knowledgeable about the wines, but not stuffy or overbearing.  When we got our menus, they were individually printed to say \"Happy Birthday Kate!\" at the top of them and I got a miniature one to take home. \n \nFood & Wine: (disclaimer - the wine pairing leads to you drinking A LOT of wine - my memory gets a bit fuzzy after about course 3).  They have an extensive wine list which included my friend's favorite bubbly that she rarely finds on menus: Billecart-Salmon from France.  I do remember that the Prager 2011 Riesling was particularly good (mostly because it's the only bottle I took a picture of some it must have struck a chord).  The courses were well portioned (risotto was a little large) and delicious - as well as creative.  Particular favorites were: smoked trout which came in a dome with smoke trapped inside and the venison with endives and candied walnuts, BUT everything was fabulous.  I left stuffed, sauced, and spoiled birthday as a girl should be - so thanks Smeade.", "author": "Kate H."}

Bookmarked for several months, Quince is in a familiar name in a familiar location (former Myth space).  Reading reviews from Devon F. and Mike K. piqued my interest and sparked a recent Friday night dinner.  My friend and I ordered the following:\n\nAmuse Bouche\n1.  Chilled Heirloom Tomato soup with Fried green tomato - Soothing fresh flavor with the crusty, heavy Fried tomato provided contrasting tastes.  Nice start.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=N9G6POR2cAewJF_R1wk3mg)\n\nAppetizers (shared)\n1. Poached Lobster - Small tail and claw pieces in a buttery sauce with fresh corn and English pea.  Light yet rich.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=BcOSUo3GmkYHFgBwgeHlHA)\n2.  Fagotelli - Tiny pouches filled with cheese and corn.  Our waiter  informed us that their pastas are their signature dishes.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=2o3HzzTESCFIg_FSWOGFTA)\n\nEntrees\n1.  Raviolo (friend)- One dish sized ravioli filled with ricotta cheese and garnished with tiny cauliflower pieces and pine nuts.  A good combination of flavors, perfect for the summer.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=h6IByqjlkflbz1GrLt8a1A)\n2.  Mix of Quail and Squab (me)- Recommended by our waiter, this came with potatoes, and some light greens. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=TIWPdom3xW03nNfdWlK3-w)\n\nDesserts\n1.  Valhrona Chocolate Custard Cake (friend) -  Dark, dense chocolate cake with the fresh blackberries and raspberries.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=tzIFg6VGMvc3DPZ3os8YGg)\n2.  Fresh Plum Crostada (me) -  Puff pastry topped with fresh plum slices.  A scoop of vanilla gelato accompanied this.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=aDcyahh_VIrfIcd6NC_4xA)\n\nSweet endings -  Green berry, Strawberry muffin, and grape candy.  A good mix of sweetness and tartness.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=k848ouGiJhrEGNCNq9Ga6g)\n\nThe dining room, like the entrance area, is dark and low key.  Most of the diners on this particular evening were in their 40's to 70's.  The servers and our waiter were very efficient in coordinating the service and making sure our table needs were met; there is more of a formal feel here.  Overall, the meal was satisfying, but not overwhelmingly filling (not a good sign if I eat two pieces of their onion bread and one roll).  My friend was not particularly hungry so the portions were perfect for her.  My friend gave this dinner a 5 star rating, while I gave it 4 stars, averaging out to 4.5 stars.", "author": "Mike C."}

My dining partner and I love the special occasions at well rated restaurants - recent memorable meals at French Laundry, Manresa's and Coi. We dined at Quince 9/17/2015 at 9:00 pm, and had a most disappointing experience. We see from other reviewers our experience was unusual, but we did have our very bad experience which we will describe.\n\nThe GOOD: waiters were great - attentive; one of the wine pairings where there was clearly too much sediment was replaced without our asking. Ambiance is lovely - elegant, serene - did not disappoint. Overall, the wine pairings were well done.\n\nThe BAD: the food. It is hard to describe having a 9 course tasting menu where every course was disappointing in some way. In several, the tastes were very ordinary and uninspired. No complex creative combinations - no synergy of familiar tastes in novel contrasts, and no dishes that delighted and surprised. Really, isn't that the reason you go to these \"great\" restaurants?\n\nSome single elements were very good. Japanese uni was fresh and sublime - not anymore so than buying a box in Tsukiji though. Did not complement associated ingredients in any meaningful way. But you don't pay over $400 per person for a good piece of uni - you expect creative and occasional greatness, and on that we were uniformly disappointed. \n\nIn truth, there were a two courses where the texture was very poor. One vegetable blend that was course in both texture and taste. On piece of pork (fried, wrapped in prosciutto) that was supposed to be light and crisp, which was hard and inedible, as fried in oil not nearly hot enough. My partner's piece came out as intended; mine was way off.\n\nSeveral courses felt like something had been left out - something key. Three of the none courses were so salty they were unpleasant - and I rarely consider food too salty.\n\nI suppose it all boils down to some anomaly in the kitchen that evening. We ate at 9:00 pm, so maybe the first string chefs had left, but clearly there was grossly inadequate supervision of the remaining cooking staff. \n\nI suppose the only rational statement I can make is that we had what appears to be an outlier experience, but clearly such severe lapses in quality control can, and did, occur. It left us with a bad taste in many ways, and deep sense of receiving a very faulty and expensive product. We were severely disappointed.\n\nI see where the manager has invited other reviewers who were unhappy to return to try to have a better experience. That is a financial risk I will not take. Once - shame on them, twice etc....\n\nI would not recommend this establishment to anyone I know. Try Benu, Saison, Coi, any of a number of other places where I have had better experiences, and would risk my reputation and money.\n\nI have no disclosures about potential conflict of interest. I am a legitimate (-ly dissatisfied) diner.\n\nGeorge T", "author": "George T."}

I loved every dish and found the mini pies and cakes at the end adorable! I have no idea how they could make it so miniature, FULL PIES, with such an eye for detail. Will definitely return.\nThe only bummer is that our reservation was set pretty early, the first reservation when the restaurant opened. We arrived 10 minutes early and was standing outside the door peering in. The staff obviously saw us and refused to open the door so that we could at least sit in the lounge/waiting area.

There is only a price fixed menu , no more choices you have to take what they give you. The food was so, so but the portions very small but the prices big. The service was good but the restaurant should get waiters that one smile and two do not have an air about them that you are eating in the best restaurant in San Francisco. The wine list is extremely overpriced especially for this area of the country. \nThere are many many better restaurants in the city , that serve better food and want you to be there and not be as standoffish as the staff at Quince was. They are trying to be like the French Laundry but they are not even close in any way. Save your money and look elsewhere.\nI doubt we will ever go back, but their sister restaurant next door has better food, a friendly staff and wonderful food choices. We did order a 300 dollar of wine at Quince because it was the year of our anniversary and the bill with tip was 1200 dollars, you can go to other better places for much less.", "author": "Michael S."}

My bff took me to Quince for my birthday, which has been our tradition for the last few years. I was extremely lucky that we decided on Quince, since it was one of the best dinner experiences I've had in a while!\n\nCHEF'S TASTING MENU (Start of photo barrage here- http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=DM42FXRLOz1SlYVWGOiwOw#DM42FXRLOz1SlYVWGOiwOw):\n-(1st Course) Royal Osetra Caviar, Brioche, Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche and Flowering Herbs: DELICIOUS. One of my favorite dishes of the night.\n-(2nd Course) Terra Firma Farm Tomatoes, Fior Di Latte Mozzarella, Fino Verde Basil: Pretty good, but nothing special.\n-(3rd Course) Isle of Skye Blue Lobster, Lemon Verbena, Zucchini and their Blossoms: Amazing! The lobster was cooked perfectly, and I could've eaten 3 plates of this.\n-(4th Course) \"Orecchiette Della Casa\", Sea Urchin, Lardo, Hot Pepper: Again, amazing! Another fave dish of the night.\n-(5th Course) \"Tortellini\", Red Legged Partridge, Burgundy Truffle: Eh, just ok. I wasn't a fan of the partridge, which was a little on the dry side.\n-(6th Course) Four Story Hill Farm Sweetbreads w/Chanterelle Mushroom, Leek, Thumbelina Carrot and Sauce Albufera: The sweetbreads were also on the dry side for me, but I'm not a huge fan (I much prefer liver based dishes).\n-(7th Course) Paine Farm Squab w/Flageolet Beans, Capsicum and Mirto: Ok.. I wasn't a fan of the way the squab was presented, and didn't like the too smooth texture. I also felt the beans were too heavy to include in a 7th course. \n-Palate Cleanser w/Hibiscus: This was awful!! One of the worst tasting palate cleansers I've had. The hibiscus was overpowering, and I could barely eat it.\n-(8th Course) Chocolate Cremeux (Caramel Jam, Sesame Croccante and Yogurt Sherbet): I loved everything except the yogurt sherbet, which just tasted very bland.\n-Mignardise: Unfortunately, they looked prettier than they tasted. I didn't really enjoy the mignardise, but appreciated the time and effort it must've taken to make all those cute desserts!\n\nAlthough I wasn't in love with all of the dishes, this was still one of the most memorable dining experiences I've had, and highly recommended for special occassions since the Chef's Tasting Menu is $140pp. I definitely enjoyed the first few courses a lot more than the last few, since I'm not a fan of some of the proteins they were serving. Another great thing about Quince is that you don't have to worry about leaving hungry- we were already getting full after the 4th course! That was partly due to their incredible brioche, which was deliciously buttery, but very dangerous- I ended up eating 2 along with the other breads, which I would recommend skipping in favor of eating more brioche.\n\nLastly but not least, the level of service at Quince was spectacular, and really elevated the overall dining experience. Our server was very attentive, and even went out of his way to ensure my friend's white wine was put on ice so it was extra cold. He was also super accommodating and packaged our mignardise for us since we were too full. We got a fancy Quince bag to take home, which also included a tin of chocolate covered toasted hazelnuts (super delicious).  \n\nSince we were too full for the optional cheese course, we will have to come back to check it out, since we've heard so many good reviews about it. Parking can be tough in this area, but valet service is available. I will definitely be back to dine at Quince, and cannot wait for my next visit!", "author": "Amy D."}

The amuse bouches (notice more than one) set the stage for an incredible evening of food.  The only miss here was a carrot, yuzu coconut foam that just did not quite come together.  \n\nThe tasting and wine pairing was an event.  The tortellini with sea urchin was melt in your mouth richness.  The rabbit, sweetbreads and lamb were spot on and cooked to perfection.  The only wine pairing we did not enjoy was the 2006 Italian, Schiopettino, Bressan, Friuli had an odd \"chemically\" note.\n\nThe Dirty Girl Farm strawberry fleur de sel and yogurt was okay but the fleur de sel was not very obvious.  But that was overshadowed by the mignardise (how French does that make me feel?) which were too much fun and closed the meal as it opened with beautiful little bites.\n\nOur main server was knowledgeable and accessible and a pleasure to speak with.  The only other nit was the bathroom situation, two separate areas aligned in such as way that you have no real indicator if they are in use except to the try the handle with is a little creepy if you the one on the other side of the door.\nThank you Quince for a lovely evening!", "author": "Heather D."}

Living in Tampa, we no longer get exposure to great, Michelin starred restaurants. \n\nThe setting is simply delightful with high ceilings and muted colors. Despite the full house, a conversation could be held. Staff was very patient (my mother is a demanding restaurant patron) and efficient. The wine list is pricy, but there is a good selection, and the sommelier is very friendly. \n\nBut ultimately, I go out to eat for the food, and this place did not make me leave happy about spending more than $200 per person. Presentation was good, but I was rarely excited by the selections on the menu. I started off with the grilled octopus, my mother had the tomatoes with prosciutto, and the guys had the lobster. My dad thought the lobster sauce was salty, although I disagree. The lobster was cooked perfectly and was so sweet and good. However, the La Quercia prosciutto was too salty, and my octopus was pretty fishy.\n\nFor the second course, my father and I had the sea urchin risotto, which wasn't as creamy as I would have liked, although the sea urchin was quite good.  My mom and husband tried the other pasta dishes. My mother liked the fermented garlic tagliatelle. My husband found his nettle pasta too salty and rich. \n\nFor the main course, my husband and I had the dover sole for 2. I didn't\nfind the fish as flaky As I would have liked, and the accompanying. Usurious we're sickeningly salty. My mother did not like the suckling pig at all, although it was the only dish she had where she was not complaining of too much salt. My father enjoyed his king salmon. \n\nThe dessert course was fine, although my tongue was still stinging from the salt in the third course. My mother love her cheese course - I do love their  wide selection and the waitress' lovely presentation of the four cheeses my mother selected. \n\nOh, the extras - the two amuse bouch\u00e9e and the petit fours were all lovely. \n\nLeaving the restaurant, my tongue continued to burn from the heavy hand used to salt the meal, even after drinking several glasses of water at home. I have not had such an experience at a nice dinner. To feel so irritated by expensive food was not a great end to an otherwise lovely evening.

Located in a historic landmark building on Pacific with both service and d\u00e9cor befitting the Relais & Chateaux designation it was just after the restaurant's 5:30 opening that I was welcomed at the hostess podium and soon finding comfort at a spacious two-top it would not be long before the show began, a complimentary glass of champagne and five small bites presented before I ever even glimpsed a menu.  Featuring three options for dining with a trio of optional supplements it was without debate that I opted for Tusk's 9+ course \"Quince Menu\" and starting off with an amuse bouche of melon soup nearly every course to follow could be best summarized by the word 'fresh' - the chef's time at Chez Panisse on full display with perfect produce and light proteins in harmony at every turn.  Steady in progression with a gift of pea soup proving an early favorite it was in the menu's third proper course, the $30 supplement of \"Tortelli alla Cecilia Chiang,\" that the evening truly took flight and although nothing to follow would surpass the burst of briny eggs juxtaposing creamy smoked sturgeon both the Tagliolini and Tortellini were also beyond reproach, a similar bit of praise befitting the poussin and its accoutrements despite a near-thirty minute delay in its delivery due to a large party  Beautiful in sweets service though unfortunately not on par with the savories in terms of taste or texture it was with good fortune that an early inquiry was made about the restaurant's recently-defunct cheese cart and in a show of service befitting America's top tables the chariot emerged once more - a $20 supplement worth every cent not only for the matured fromage but also for accoutrements including rooftop honeycomb and the best fruit bread to ever pass my lips.", "author": "Michael U."}

We arrived at Quince's great peaceful location, off the bustling main streets. It's great that you can watch the chefs at work in the kitchen through a window on the sidewalk\n\nI love the ambiance at the restaurant - classy without being over-stuffy with waiting staff who were knowledgeable and discreetly attentive. The perfect accompaniment to Chef Michael's Tusk's impeccable food. \n\nUsually never ones to eschew a tasting menu, Tammy and I were feeling the effects of eating a lot of very rich food all week and we went with the a 4 course la carte menu. Although there were fewer dishes than with the tasting menu, by choosing different dishes, our cunning plan meant that we got to try 8 dishes total.\n\nOur choices included top class ingredients ranging from lobster to squab and suckling pig. Everything was cooked to perfection and served with accompaniments which blended symbiotically with the main ingredient to enhance and not overwhelm it. The quality of the meal has even made me question my policy of always going for the tasting menu.\n\nThis was an amazing meal, which enabled me to end my week of gastronomic gluttony in San Francisco on a high", "author": "Yee Gan O."}

Though we've had a few rewarding experiences (most notably Eleven Madison and Per Se in NYC), most have been outright disasters (Komi in DC, and most particularly and painfully Vetri in Philadelphia). Happily for us, Quince comes far closer to finding a niche in the former category.\n\nFirstly, Quince may be among the quietest restaurants we found in San Francisco -- really the only one where conversation among four diners could be held without raising one's voice. The staff, though perhaps a bit aloof (not a crime in my book) was professional, knowledgeable, and accommodating. We dined with my San Franciscan cousin and her husband and the conversation was lively -- lots of catching up to do -- thus the meal passed quickly and quietly. My cousin summed it up best -- \"It was wonderful, but I can't remember what I ate!\" My experience exactly! What we learned from this experience is that tasting-menu restaurants are NOT for socializing, they are for talking about THE FOOD! \n\nAnd the food at Quince is exciting!. From what I can remember, most of the eight courses were of subtle complexity and were clearly compositions of the chef, completely unique to Quince. That's precisely the experience we were seeking -- it's unfortunate in that all this passed by at the periphery of our awareness!\n\nSome might classify Quince as a bit pretentious and precious.

We spent as much as we have ever spent on a meal, comparable to Guy Savoy in Paris.  Compared to Guy Savoy, Quince just didn't measure up, on any of the dimensions of food, drink, setting or service.  Although Quince is unquestionably better than fellow 3-star Saison, to compare to another SF restaurant, it was not uniformly outstanding.  The amuse bouche and first dishes in the prix fixe dinner were great.  After that, things leveled off.  First off, almost all of the expensive wine pairing was white wines (a pet peeve of my wife and me).  The dishes themselves seemed cute and clever, but not particularly outstanding or memorable.  Most dishes consisted of small cubes of semi-interesting food, arranged in a haphazard way on the plate.  We live in the Washington DC area, and there are several DC restaurants that we would consider superior--Minibar for inventiveness, Plume for atmosphere, and Fiola and the Source for food.  The new DC entrant, Mirabelle, which has no Michelin stars yet, surpasses Quince on all dimensions.  The quality/price relationship simply doesn't hold up at Quince.  In its favor, the service was friendly and gracious, much more so than at (say) Saison.", "author": "Roland R."}

They took the extra time to personalize our menus, and then put them in an envelope for us to take home later. Very nice touch. \n\nWe started off with cocktails, and were brought curry chips to snack on while we looked at the wine list and menu options. I liked how everything was done at a leisurely pace and we were never rushed. We ordered the Quince tasting menu with a cheese plate addition, and I asked for my dessert to be swapped out for something else. \n\nThe first course was 5 amuse bouches. Five of them! I could have had an entire meal of amuse bouches, they were so pretty and delicious. The other courses were: maine belon oyster, white asparagus with morel mushroom, alaskan halibut, trofie with crab and sea urchin, suckling pig tortellini, and lamb. My favorites were the white asparagus (how do you get mushrooms to taste so good??) and the trofie. The husband had a rhubarb yogurt, and I had an espresso ganache for dessert. \n\nSince it was my birthday, they also sent a cake with a candle along with our desserts. After we finished the meal, we were handed 2 drinks for the road (passionfruit soda), and a little bag with our leftovers and a small gift. \n\nOn a side note, their tasting menu is supposed to be 9 courses, but the menu itself only lists 7 courses.

It is fantastic (and refreshing) how the place is able to balance such astonishing class with warmth that feels like you are dining in a good friend's home. \n\nOnce seated, each one of us (there were 5 for my husband's birthday celebration) had an attendant to bring some tasty amuse bouche where the tastes varied in temperature from coolest to warmest as you moved up the plate.\n\nI don't have time or space to go into detail of each dish and the entire experience but these are the main points:\n\n1. If you're gonna go and spend the time and money on this restaurant, do the quince menu with the blind taste test. Its like Disneyland for adults! You taste, swirl, pair and discuss with your dinner mates the possibilities of what the wine might be (and the fact that they have 9,000 bottles makes for the ranges of potential wines that much more exciting).\n\n2. The service truly is wonderful! The kind men and women who served us were attentive, hospitable and again felt like they were hosting us in their own home.\n\n3. Lastly, you can feel the gratitude this restaurant has for its patrons. Other restaurants where we have dined (which will remain unnamed...) feel as if they have their \"territory\" in San Francisco and because they know what they are doing, feel stuffy; making each diner feel as if they should be grateful to be able to come into their restaurant. At Quince, as you leave, you feel as if it truly was their pleasure to serve you, to see the excitement as you ate each of their immaculate courses and actually do hope to share in an even better experience (if it is at all possible) when you come back... and after eating their once I can guarantee you, (as a wise cyborg once said) I will be back.", "author": "Jen D."}

We arrived a bit early and decided to order a drink from the bar, or rather, from the bar cart. Now, my fiance and I love antiques and recently purchased a mid century modern bar cart of our own so we were super excited to see one put to use in a restaurant. The drinks that the bartender prepared were amazing and complex scotch concoctions. If you're a scotch drinker (hell, even if you're not!) you should try one of the 3 bar cart specialty cocktails.\n\nBoth my fiance and I decided on the 9 course Quince tasting menu with the wine pairing. When I opened my menu, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the restaurant typed \"Happy Birthday, Jen\" inside. Now that was an incredibly thoughtful touch. Speaking of thoughtful, my fiance informed the restaurant in advance of my gluten intolerance so everything that was prepared for me was a gluten free incarnation of the original. The chef even prepared fresh gluten free bread for me, which was amazing. Every dish looked like a work of art and the ingredients were incredibly fresh. It doesn't get more local than veggies grown in Quince's roof top garden! The wines that the restaurant selected were beautiful and paired perfectly with each dish. Every detail was elegantly executed.\n\nOur primary server was incredible. She was friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. It really does \"take a village\" at Quince since numerous servers, as well as the sommelier, visit your table throughout your dining experience. The staff really does a remarkable job of ensuring that you enjoy absolutely everything about your experience.\n\nAs we left, we were handed a copy of my special menu and hot chocolate, which was undeniably the best hot chocolate I've ever had.

You can order a smaller tasting menu called Spring or the Garden tasting menu which has the same number of courses with a vegetable theme.\n\nThe dinning room is very upscale and the noise level was low with the perfect light ambience to make it a special romantic occasion.\n\nThe service was amazing but unobtrusive throughout the meal. We had a number of wait staff that helped keep everything running smooth in this 3 hour experience. Yes... Three hours although it seemed like 20 minutes. The pacing of the meal from start to finish was amazing.\n\nAnother nice touch was the menu were personalized for our occasion and our names. This was a Keepsake for us of the evening.\n\nWe started with some small bites sent from chef to start the meal. It was the start of something special.\n\nThe sommelier led us through a taste guessing of the different paired wines providing information about each wine and why it was paired with the course. There was history about the regions and the particular elements we were tasting/smelling in the wines. It was fun for my wife and I and we found new wines to try from around the world.\n\nThe courses were: \nHibiscus Fromage Blanc, Beet and Seville Orange\nFrutti Di Mare, Avocado, Persian Cucumber, Wasabi\nRoyal Sterling Caviar, Champagne Oyster, Oxalis\nTrofie Nantucket Scallop, Yuzu, Cauliflower\nSuckling Pig Tortellini Fatto a  Mano, Parmigiano Reggiano, black Truffle\nPaine Farm Squab, Porcini Mushroom,Cabbage,Crosne\nDon Watson's Lamb, Fava Bean, Morel Mushroom, White asparagus\nGranny Smith Apple, Green Chartruese, Wild Flower Honey\nTierra Farm Rhbarb, yoghurt, Oat Sable, ValRhona Opayys\n\nEach course had a wine that took us an adventure from the Loire region in France, Napa, Sonoma, Italy and a fe wither wine regions.\n\nAt the conclusion of our meal when we left, they had my wifes coat and our car ready to go as we left our table.\n\nMichael Tusk is the Chef Owner and he summed it up perfectly as, \"The meal should not be just what we put on the plate, but the entirety of the experience.

Quince was unfortunately the one that didn't make it at the time, and I filed that little piece of unrequited dining in the back of my mind. \n\nAnd then, suddenly, I knew it was time to go there. No special occasion other than enjoying some good company, and I managed to find three other people willing to give the place a shot. One had never been, and two had but under a different chef. The former loved it, the latter duo loved how it was completely different and even better than before.\n\nAmbiance - perfect. Quiet enough to really enjoy the food and talk amongst ourselves. Just enough hum and busy noises so we always felt at ease and comfortable. Aside from a 2-top near us that kept talking loudly on the phone, which we had to laugh about, everything was great. \n\nDrinks - awesome pairings. And if you're flush with the funds, get a pre-dinner cocktail. We got a variety between us, including some made tableside, and it was hard to pick a favorite. All had their subtle benefits. The sommelier, in fact, was the person most present during the meal and we really liked her. Super friendly and knowledgeable, fast, efficient, effective. \n\nFood - we got the 9 course Quince menu, no arguing over the options. It looked too well-roundedly awesome. Favorites included Carpinteria abalone, and optional cheese course, which was served with a fruity chewy bread that we all received a small loaf of as a parting gift.\n\nRestroom - well, this was a surprise. Do try to take the time to visit one, and then go back a few minutes later. :) Someone goes in there and resets the room everytime. Ha! \n\nCall it serendipity, but the cab the restaurant called for us to take us home turned out to be a food blogger. Totally delightful to go home in post-dinner bliss with lively chatter about the meal we just had with the driver, and comparing notes on other places we'd all been. \n\nAlso call it serendipity, but just a week after our meal, the latest Michelin guide came out, awarding Quince a second star, so we're all feeling a little smug with our decision to eat there.

I've been here multiple times with clients who rave about it --- usually it's good  (NOT great, but good).   What I am confused by is the value.   I don't see it.  For $750, I can think of 2 (or 3) great dinners at other restaurants in our amazing city.   \n\nAnd of course, when the server offers up attitude, I am always disapointed.   I guess he doesn't realize who is paying him.   But aside from that, food is decent, other service staff were good, and the decor is nice & comfortable, but missing the mark on value for your dollar.  \n\nI watched wait staff simply walking in circles.  Made me wonder if they are not allowed to stand in place -- but have orders to constantly be moving.  It's pretentious and unnecessary.   If I sip my water, you do not need to refill it.   I want to be comfortable and relaxed, not constantly thanking someone.  It's distracting to an enjoyable evening.\n\nThere are so many great places to eat in SF, and with much better value.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-27", "description": "My spouse and I had dinner at Quince last night.  To be honest, it was with a bit of trepidation given the bifurcated reviews on yelp.  There are the five star \"loved it/meal of my life\" people, and then there are the \"food was bland/portions were tiny/I've experienced much better meals for less money\" people.  It's truly odd to read such varying accounts of the exact same restaurant.  \"What could cause this?\"  I wondered, and which side will our meal more closely resemble?\n\nTo cut to the chase, I left Quince last night completely bewildered as to how anyone could find something to criticize.  It is a true two Michelin star experience.  The room is the most suave and beautiful I know of in San Francisco.  You walk in and just know they are going to take care of you; look at the amazing flower arrangements; look at the comfortable banquettes; observe the way the staff is interacting with their guests and with each other.  Before you even sit down, it's clear this is going to be special, and you are going to be looked after with great care.\n\nOnce the wine is decanted and poured and you've had a chance to speak with your server about the menu, you mull over a couple of options and place your order.  The amuse bouches start to arrive and they are, one after the next, spectacular.  So many layers of flavors and complexity in each bite.  Anyone who could say this food is bland either doesn't know what they are talking about, or they must need to write such a review to feel superior.\n\nAs to the question of small portions...no, I'm sorry, if you are a normal person, there is no way you could leave Quince feeling hungry.  Think about it, you are eating virtually non-stop for three hours.  The pacing of the meal is perfect.  No, at no point are you going to have a slab of ribs plopped in front of you.  Does someone coming to this caliber of restaurant seriously expect such a thing?  But the cumulative effect of all this delicious food, one amazing bite after the next for three hours, is: you leave very full.  \n\nRegarding price, I don't think this is an argument that can be convincingly carried out on Yelp.  If you are booking a meal here, you know what it's going to cost.  If you don't want to spend that kind of money, go elsewhere; don't come to Quince and then complain it was too expensive.  That's just crazy.\n\nLastly, I want to say something that I think most reviewers on yelp have missed: there is a gestalt to Quince that induces joy.  When you combine this lovely a room with this perfect caliber of service and food, when an army of people has it as their goal to please you in any way they realistically can, the meal becomes more than just a meal.  It is a unique experience you will look back on many years later and remember, and you will smile at the recollection.  You will wonder, \"How DID they get those lines of caviar and egg yolk and tiny little chives to line up so perfectly?  Why DID that one tiny leaf of coriander (from their rooftop garden) impart so much flavor to the rest of the dish?  And where DID they find servers who seem smart and polished enough to be running a good-sized corporation?\"  In the end, none of these specifics matter.  In the end, you float out of Quince, aware that you just enjoyed one of the greatest meals -- one of the greatest experiences -- of your life.\n\nGo without trepidation.  Five stars.", "author": "Stephen K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-12-14", "description": "I came last Saturday for a repeat visit to celebrate a friend's birthday.  The menu format has changed slightly since my last visit, the options now are a four course pre-fixe or the chef's tasting menu.  I ordered the tasting and sadly only two of the dishes were good - the quail egg and caviar pasta and the chocolate dessert.  Everything else was either just average or did not suite my tastes at all.  This was probably the first time I've left any dish on a tasting menu more than half uneaten.  Then to top it off, they forgot to bring out one of the courses on the tasting menu.  The \"cranberry sorbetto\" course never appeared.  The omission was probably because I was the only one at the table who ordered the tasting, the others ordered the four course.  It is still inexcusable, as they assured me before hand that it was perfectly fine if I was the only one who ordered the tasting.\n\nThis was a sharp contrast to my first experience here where I loved every dish that was served.  My friends who ordered off the pre-fixe menu had mixed reviews on their selections, though they seemed to enjoy their dinners much more than me.  The cocktail menu did not disappoint, each concoction was surprisingly delicious and refreshing.  I wouldn't mind stopping by the bar lounge just for cocktails.   \n\nOther than the mishap of forgetting one of my courses, service was outstanding.  The waitstaff never miss a beat and are attentive to questions.  There was a miscommunication with the kitchen and they mistakenly put peanuts on my dessert when I had informed the waiter prior to the meal that I was allergic.  He immediately swooped in and quickly replaced the dish when informed of the error.  \n\nI left the meal slightly embarrassed.  I was the one who suggested we come to Quince for this meal.  I also gave a glowing review of Quince to another friend who dined here two days prior to my last visit and she was not impressed either.  She specially told me to try the tasting menu and tell her what I thought afterwards.  My past experience with the chef's creations have been extremely positive.  I loved my first visit to Quince earlier this year.  My friends and I dine regularly at Cotogna, whenever we can manage to snag a reservation.  I'm really at a loss as to why this last experience at Quince was so poor.", "author": "Wei K."}

It took a while, but my wife and I finally made it there for dinner, and enjoyed a fabulous meal at what rivals any and all restaurants in SF that I have previously dined at.  My only previous visit was really just a quick drink in their bar while waiting for a table at their sister restaurant Cotogna (next door).  While doing so we were impressed with the menu and atmosphere and agreed to try it sometime soon.\n\nOptions in the main dining room are a 4 course (3+dessert) meal or a tasting menu.  The dishes are \"loosely\" Italian in genre- with a modern touch which one expects at a fine dining establishment such as this.  We went with the 4 course menu and were delighted with our selections.  Amongst them were a delicious tomato dish, a tortelloni plate, main courses of salmon and halibut.  Incredible service and top notch presentation up and down the menu.\n\nQuince is the REAL DEAL. I'd place this at or above the category of Gary Danko, Acquerello, La Folie, Seasons @ the Four Seasons SF, the dining room at Auberge du Soleil (Napa), and anywhere else in SF.  5 very shiny stars.", "author": "Andy S."}

After the move to Downtown they become my #1 restaurant, where I knew food could never disappoint.  In July 2015 I returned to the restaurant only to learn otherwise. Bar area shrunk to nothing, dusk settled onto the dining area and place became dull. It felt like having fun is no longer permitted, night time has fallen and it could be your last meal. Well, for me it was at  Quince.  Through my 5-6 course meal I struggled to find a dish that I wanted to eat again. I have dined at Michelin Star restaurants in Italy and France and I can still remember the dishes I had, I can still remember the duck I used to order at Quince. The dinner I had this time was nothing resembling those past experiences. The ambiance is still there, the service is excellent but food is not. Some dished were hard to eat at all - they lacked flavor, not to mention innovation. Overall, I could not wait to finished my dinner, pay my $600 without wine pairing and go home. The hot chocolate served as I was leaving the restaurant saved my night but it was not enough to return back for another meal.

It's about a 15 minute walk from FIDI and the door is slightly hidden, so keep your eye out when walking. Coming into the restaurant we planned on doing the 4-5 item menu instead.... yeah that did not work out as soon as we read the menu. We decided we wanted EVERYTHING. We each picked the Quince menu and Garden menu (so we could basically try a bite of everything) and boy oh boy did we make the right decision. I personally love preset course meals so I don't have to figure out what I want to eat, they already KNOW. These menus were $158 per person, but you get what you pay for-- quality of food and service. I'm not picky but I have a high enough standard for food to know that everything was absolutely divine. Make sure you clear your whole night, the dinner takes approximately 3-4 hours, I kid you not. We started around 5:50pm and did not leave until 9:35pm. Portions seem small but you always end up full at the end.\n\nQuince claims to be Italian/French but it definitely leans more on the side of Italian. The courses come with multiple pastas, each unique and each delicious. The gnocchi from the Garden menu was my favorite pasta. I also loved the flavor king pluot shot (it's like dippin dots, they use liquid nitrogen to make this frozen sorbet into little balls) from the Quince menu and lemon rose sorbet from the Garden menu. I enjoyed the squash blossom from the squash blossom pasta, but the pasta itself was extremely oily and heavy. This was probably my least favorite course of the meal. If they turned down the oil, I think the dish would have been perfect. So if you are deciding between the garden or quince menu, I personally enjoyed the garden more-- but be forewarned it does not come with any meat. Quince has more variety in terms of what kind of food they serve though, and the lamb in this menu was amazing. The presentation of both courses should get over 5 stars. Everything was placed so carefully and delicately I swear they used tweezers to place it on. The plates were beautiful and the food in it even moreso. Every dish was colorful and the ingredients complimented each other perfectly.\n\nOur server was so kind and smiled at us every 2 seconds. Attentive, but not overly imposing. The bread was so freaking good (little warm rolls with celery seeds sprinkled on top) that we asked for some to go and they wrapped them in a box at the front along with some complimentary chocolate covered nuts. Impeccable service.\n\nThe meal was so much fun. Tasting everything is like a game on your taste buds that you always win.

A very intimate setting as well.  There were so many employees dressed in suits running around that it was hard to tell who was who.\n\nWe decided to go with the regular 4 course prix fixe.  (Note, they don't have an a la carte menu).  I started off with the Squash Blossom Salad with green cherry tomato, cheese, and olives.  I never had squash blossoms before, but it was very tasty with the cheese and olives.  For the 2nd course, I went with our server's recommendation, Squab Lasagnette.  This was one-of-a-kind and the best dish I had that night!  The timing in between courses was just right as I was able to digest the food and enjoy my husband's company.\n\nSince it was our anniversary, they provided a complimentary ravioli amuse bouche.  It was made with homemade ricotta cheese and had a touch of honey.  It was mouthwatering that I was wanting more.  Too bad they don't have that as a dish!\n\nFor my main course, I had the Wild Alaskan Halibut which was cooked nicely, but nothing too special.  For dessert, I had the Banana Pound Cake with raisin coulis, chocolate Nougatine and oat ice cream, but I couldn't stop staring at the cheese cart that the table next to us was getting instead.

The tasting menu is incredible from every aspect including the actual plates, silver ware, plating, color, and uniqueness of ingredients.  Every bite is special.  The service is first class. The servers are everywhere without being seen or obtrusive.  The wine pairing was probably one of the best, if not the best, wine/food paring I ever experienced.  The only disappointment to us was the dessert.  No chocolate.  We would have liked some kind of rich, chocolate delicacy in front of us.  Thank you chef for sending out the extra courses.  We enjoyed each on tremendously.  Thank you also for the cigar in our goodie bag.  I'll be sure to let you know how it was when I have the chance to smoke it.   Overall, this is probably one of the best fine dining experiences you could ask for, in any state and in any country.  Quince should be rate 10 Michelin stars!  Keep an eye open for Chef's Tusk new pasta line.  Coming soon to market near you!", "author": "Michael B."}

It wasn't damage control, panicked curiosity, nor was it marketing - it was genuine concern for our experience, & why service was off that night.  He had mentioned a few good points I had made, and they even took some of my comments and changed some things.\n\nI am happy to have a less than perfect experience that is worth around 3 stars (expectations, obviously, are high), but it's *obviously* a fantastic restaurant if management is so engaged, and cares this much. I was impressed they reached out to talk, and as someone who only wants to be fair, I upgraded the star rating to reflect my feelings about the overall experience.  This level of sophistication and elegance is somewhat rare in SF, and it's why Quince is at the level it is at.\n\nSometimes you have to have a bad experience with a business to give them a chance to show just how unbelievable they are.  As overwhelming as social can be, their GM Paul is an impressive, dialed in, excellent manager.  Cheers to Quince!", "author": "Uncle Fishbits Aeneas X."}

The atmosphere was very nice and we were able to comfortably catch up without yelling. Actually, we did not even have to raise our voices to talk to each others. The drinks were great as was the service. We had the 9 course tasting menu, a really surprising assembly of different kinds of food and styles that surprises with every course.

Let's start with the good news:\n\n*Ambiance: Quince is an extremely beautiful restaurant. Two very big thumbs up to whoever did the interior decorating; it was a huge a \"wow\" factor. \n\n*Service: Service at Quince was great. Yes, my family was that table obnoxiously taking  pictures of everything; I would be annoyed with us. Our server was warm and amiable and was more than happy to accommodate our photo-happy tendencies. Table-side cocktail making was also neat.\n\n*Food (the good): \n-There were so many amuse bouches (maybe 4?), and most of them were great in how they played with textures and flavor.\n-The execution of the cooking of the food was perfect. Medium rare was indeed a perfect medium rare. Lobster was not overcooked in the slightest and tasted succulent and cramy. Pasta was perfectly al dente. \n-Pastry tray and chocolate hazelnuts that were served at the end of dinner were also perfect one bite dishes.\n\nAnd now on to the bad news:\n\n*Food (the bad):\n-Major seasoning issues. This issue was what ruined almost everything for me. My sister ordered the lobster appetizer, and it initially came out salty to the point of being inedible. After my sister sent it back, my mom mentioned to our server that we are not a salt-heavy family. Subsequently, everything else that came out tasted UNDER-salted and maybe even slightly watered down since the flavors were muted to the point of almost not tasting like anything. The reason why I feel mixed about this is because I don't know if the flavors were so underwhelming in order to accommodate our salt-sensitive palates or if that's just how the food is. \n-Duck. Although it was cooked to a perfect medium rare, the skin was not crisped up enough.\n\nBecause of the seasoning issues, I left Quince feeling extremely underwhelmed. However, I don't know if that was my table's fault or the restaurants so take my review with a grain of salt if you will.", "author": "Wendy S."}

Souffle was decent and we added white truffles, which were very bland, literally tasted like thin pieces of paper. Total waste of money. Had citrus in gelatin, which sounded great but the gelatin was grainy, not quite set, and weird tasting.  I could go on and on.  The dessert was a tart thing with pear and  white chocolate in a thick ribbon, which tasted like sweet dough, disgusting.  I have been to many amazing restaurants, but this is not one of them.

Our bubbly server, the server that remained a constant though our entire meal, said that the kitchen prefer that we order menus that have the same number of courses (the winter menu, which looked appealing to my dining companion only had 5 courses). The meal began with a few small bites, compliments of the chef. \n\nThe flavor and dishes were tasty, and even some of the more \"our of the box\" items such as the sweetbreads were prepared in a very approachable way (smothered in a barbecue sauce).

I was a die-hard fan of Myth before and was extremely sad to see it go.  I'm glad at least that the cool space Myth once occupied on Pacific is now home to Quince.  Granted they took the liberty to heavily change the old space, I feel they've maybe toned down the prior cool factor and substituted it now for more of a mature, upscale flair.\n\nWhen we sat down, we were immediately impressed by the custom menu that wished us 'Happy Anniversary' on the top of the menu..nice touch for sure.  Rather than overthinking things, we just decided to go all out with the chef's tasting menu.  This was essentially 8 courses with 3 extra small courses thrown in (appetizer, sorbet, dessert cookie/candy tray).\n\nRather than go into each of the 11 courses, let's just skip to the chase and say everything was delicious and very artfully prepared.  Service throughout the meal was excellent overall.  The one thing I wasn't a fan of was the fact that they would constantly rotate servers for every single course.  While I understand this allows each server to be an \"expert\" at describing the exact details of each course, the lack of one central server made things slightly confusing when it came to simple things like ordering additional drinks.  I thought I was being nitpicky about this at first, but I later realized that this had somewhat of a greater impact on the overall dining experience when we got the bill.\n\nEssentially when I dine at high-end restaurants, I make the assumption that the bill should be always correct.  Given this, I always toss down the old credit card without looking at the actual bill itemization.  As usual, I did the same with this meal at Quince.  After tipping and putting my John Hancock on the final bill, I started folding up my copy of the bill to file in my wallet when my eyes happened to inadvertently see a few bill items that were not familiar.  After taking a closer look, I ended up being incorrectly charged for a more expensive glass of wine and for 2 bottles of sparkling water we never ordered!!!  I was definitely irritated by this but it was really late at night and I didn't want to go through the hassle of fighting over the extra $30 I was charged.  I do however feel that if a place is already commanding over 4 benjamins for a dinner for 2...they need to do a better job at keeping track of what was actually ordered.  You would think that this would be especially simple given their set menu system.  I basically felt I had to knock my rating down purely because of the billing discrepancy.

I eschew offal and Quince kindly swapped out the sweetbreads, which is a twee name for a thyroid or thymus thingy.\n\nThis restaurant is best left for expense account types, and guys trying to impress dates that are way out of their league.", "author": "Fred F."}

I think they are far more innovative and paying greater attention to detail instead of just basking in their glory.\n\nThe cocktail menu at Quince is great (as good as Danko); I started with a \"Blue Moon\" and instead of being cheap beer that was London Dry Gin, Creme de Violette, Maraschino, and Lemon.  Boozy but perfectly balanced.\n\nThen there were 2 different amuse bouche:\n\n- Green tomato gazpacho, Compressed melon with prosciutto, Goat milk croquettes \n- Smoked salmon with local osetra caviar, Scallop tartare\n\nFollowed by the courses of the tasting menu:\n\n- Local abalone and tomato consomme\n- Prawns with Bronx Grapes\n- Black olive pappardelle with uni and braised octopus (WOW! I had asked for this to be substituted in the tasting menu for the giant ravioli and I am so glad that I did)\n- Cappellacci filled with veal sweetbreads and served with rabbit tenderloin and rabbit chops (have you ever even seen rabbit chops?  It's not common)\n- Four parts of suckling pig (chop, loin, belly, and sausage), served with peaches (which I think had a brown sugar glaze)\n\nA palate cleanser of chamomile sorbetto, orange scone, and raspberry jam, followed by\n\nAn absolutely ridiculous cheese cart.  Only a handful of cheese carts are as good or better than this one, but it is up there with Robuchon and No. 9 Park.  I have never seen cheese wrapped in tobacco leaves or covered in brandy-soaked grape seeds.\n\nPolished off with a dessert of chocolate caramel cream, salted caramel ice cream, and spiced bread, then concluded with 2 rounds of mignardises.\n\nI can't recommend it enough.

But after such a horrible experience at Quince, I felt obligated to share. \n\nMy husband and I love trying Michelin restaurants and having recently moved to the Bay Area from NYC, we were eager to see what SF had to offer. Overall the food was mediocre, fine but not memorable, but the reason for the one star was the horrible service. \n\nAfter being seated, we waited for at least 15 minutes before even water was offered. And it was an impolite \"Uhh, you guys okay?\" with a look that made it seem like we did something wrong. Then another 10 minutes before the waiter returned and asked \"Did you want Chardonnay or something to start?\" No offer to look at the wine list, no menus yet either. I requested to look at the wine list and then waited another 10 minutes before he came back to take our order. \n\nWhat made things worse was that there was an older couple seated next to us who ordered at least 15 minutes after us and they received much more attentive, quick service. We ordered the same prix fixed menu first, paying extra for the caviar dish, and they were served dishes before we were, on top of receiving extra dishes and wine on the house, I'm assuming because they paid extra for the wine pairing. Our final bill was $600 so it wasn't as if we didn't order our share of alcohol. Speaking of alcohol, my husband's beer glass were empty for a few courses before one of the waitresses took his glass away. Then I watched her pause before returning to our table to ask if he wanted another beer. Yes he did, a few courses ago. Meanwhile the waiters were attentive to the table next to us course after course, never leaving their glasses empty, saying things like \"I just couldn't help myself!\" while bringing them free dessert wine while we sat with empty glasses.  \n\nThe last straw was when my husband went to stand in line for the restroom and another gentleman came later, started chatting with the attendant about the artwork, and sauntered in first even though my husband had obviously been waiting. The attendant apologized but that was it. \n\nFor a final bill around $600, what a horrible experience. Service shouldn't differ like that between tables. It made us feel like our time and money were not valued. We are used to impeccable service at Michelin restaurants, like Daniel's and Le Bernardin in NYC, and were sorely disappointed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-13", "description": "One of the best dining experiences in San Francisco, Quince is most definitely deserving of its Michelin star.\n\nWith unsurpassed execution in the kitchen and professional service in the dining room, Michael Tusk's Quince features an Italian-inspired menu based on the local bounty of Northern California.  The brick and timber dining space is at once relaxed yet sophisticated.  Tables are far enough apart that diners do not learn the most intimate secrets from patrons at other tables, and the noise level is such that it is easy to carry on a hushed conversation.\n\nA veteran of Stars, Oliveto, and Chez Panisse, Tusk consistently turns out dishes that are spot on.  The sea scallops with wild nettle and little farm potato pur\u00e9e ($18) were succulent and sweet.  Tender and still a little al dente, the white asparagus served with buratta cheese and bottarga di muggine ($19) had a subtle flavor profile.  The gnocchi with Maine lobster, fava beans, and tarragon ($22) was rich and delicious.  The delicate flavor and texture of Devil's gulch rabbit ($29) was showcased in three exquisite preparations:  a torchon wrapped in pastry, a filet, and a rack of ribs.\n\nThe well-planned wine list has numerous by the glass and by the bottle offerings that complement Tusk's cuisine.  With some wines starting at less than $60, diners from bargain hunters to high rollers will find a selection to fit their budget.  However, with an egregiously expensive corkage fee ($35), wine director/sommelier David Lynch is basically telling patrons that their wines are not welcome.\n\nService is impeccable.  Staff training is obviously a priority, as the attentive but not intrusive wait staff is knowledgeable about ingredients and preparations.  At Quince, diners want for nothing: pacing is perfect, used dishes are removed immediately, and water / wine glasses rarely get below half full.\n\nDespite some Yelp reviews to the contrary, Quince continues to impress.  Yes, the impressiveness comes with a cost, but a dining experience of this calibre is well worth it.", "author": "CJ G."}

I started to think this restaurant didn't have any options and that they bring out whatever food and drink they want.  Waiter asks if we want to start with a cocktail, without giving us a wine list, looking at us as if we should know what drinks are offered. Waiter gives disapproving look when we opt for tap water. \n\nThere was an awkwardness to the entire dinner as if we were inconveniencing the waitstaff. Their attitude created an uncomfortable atmosphere. I guess that's what happens when the owner puts the restaurant on auto-pilot.

Paper coffee cups, one-year leases, take-out breakfast, lunch and dinner. One-night stands (both single-serving AND serving singles!), consigned clothing, disposable paperbacks, the same Ikea Malm unit (regurgitated repeatedly, to new, different vagrants).\n\nWe were casually committed (spontaneous seats in the luxurious lounge that constitutes the bar area), but quickly realized that Quince was much more than a one-night stand, despite the steep, and steeper spends for a four-course pre-fixe ($95: $6 more than Marea's Central Park South address commands) and tasting menu ($140 - dwarfing the nose-in-the-air, New York likes of Le Bernardin). Did I mention that there was a neighboring cheese wheel (seriously, think the moon, in September)? \"Quince, you had me at 'neighboring cheese wheel'.\"\n\nThere are no beer goggles required to get cozy - but we opted for some preprandial cocktails anyway, which warmed and primed us for a pair of singular appetizers. My review of the seasonal dinner menu is likely out of date - but here's hoping that the exceptional high quality of the First Time can and will be transposed to future falls and springs.\n\nLove at first bite: my Nantucket Bay scallops, daubed with caviar, were slightly-sweet, perfectly cooked, textured nibbles were outstanding. His sea urchin \"creme brulee\" was superior in concept over in flavor, but no faults for execution - he licked the bowl clean.  The second course -truffle-drizzled lobster risotto for two- was unchallenging in a crowd-pleasing sort of way, but nonetheless reeled us in with aplomb. The third course defaulted to hearty meats; neither accomplishing too much beyond the baseline merits of suckling pig and lamb. \n\nThe desserts were similarly unextraordinary, but not in the bad way; they allowed the savory bulk of the meal - and the most exciting proteins (the lobster, the urchin, the lamb) to retain the spotlight. The service, I'll note, was excellent - the courses were well-timed, plating was pretty, chitchat was unpretentious. \n\nIt was not only the best meal I'd had in a very long time (all things considered), it's one of those rare fine dining experiences that I'm very excited to replicate. \n\nYup.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-09-23", "description": "I struggled with whether to give Quince 2 or 3 stars, which is in itself telling.  Many things went well tonight but frankly at this level of restaurant EVERYTHING should do much better than \"well\".\n\nThe service was formal to the point of being a bit cold and stuffy, but still mostly efficient.  The timing  between courses was occasionally a bit longer than I would have liked, and one hot course came out before the wine.  Frankly that should never happen at a restaurant of this caliber, but ultimately these are sins that rank pretty far down on the list, and are foregiven if everything else goes well.  Except as you'll see in a bit, everything didn't go well.\n\nThe wine pairings were the highlight of the night.  The pairings were quite thoughtful (who would have expected to see a Sake and a Lambrusco? And they both paired with their dishes so well!).  And their were some great wines poured - a lovely 94 Rioja tonight as well as a really compelling Vin de Paille with one of the desert courses.  \n\nBut we're not here for the wine and service, are we?  The food was just completely  blase on so many levels.  Actually let me clarify... the savory courses were blase.  The desert courses were quite nice.  A lovely intermezzo of sorbet, and a wonderful chocolate dish to close things out.  What a great finish.\n\nUnfortunately every dish up to that point was absolutely forgettable. There is not one dish I would even want to try again.  Other than the sea urchin dish paired with radish, there were zero remarkable flavor combinations.  Nothing that made me think \"how did the chef think of this?\".\n\nOur server asked at the beginning of the meal if I'd like to substitute out the wild hare in the event I find those types of flavors too gamy.  I heard that and thought \"wild, gamy hare, I'm in for a treat!\".  \n\nWhen the hare dish came out, I searched high and low for... the hare.  And found none.  I did find a few strands of meat that had been \"braised\" down to a level that made it completely indistinguishable from something that came out of a can.\n\nAnd... the portions.  I know tasting menus and get that the portion size is ratcheted down.  Except these were the smallest protein portions I've ever seen on a tasting menu, and that's from a guy who has done his fair share of 10, 15, and 20 course menus.  \n\nI found no more than a few strands of meat in the hare dish, 3-5 pieces of fish smaller than my pinky nail in the abalone dish.  The veal dish had the largest piece of meat, no more than 1.5\" square.  They could have doubled the protein portion size and they still would have been smaller than that I've experienced at similar restaurants elsewhere.\n\nTake incredibly small portion sizes and completely unremarkable flavors, and no amount of service or wine pairing savvy can save the night.  On top of that I found all of the \"extras\" nauseating.  While the intermezzo was nice, the multiple rounds of canapes, the after-dinner candy, and the \"breakfast coffee cake to go\" added little to no value to the meal.\n\n4 stars for wine pairing, 3 stars for service, 2 stars for food, 1 star for value.\n\nI don't know what Quince was before or will be after this night.  But tonight beat out of me any chance that I would ever wonder or care.  This night was remarkable only for it's unremarkableness.  Not even a real word I suspect, but hey maybe then it's a new word, and that's one good thing to come out of tonight.", "author": "Jason T."}

We don't spend this kind of money very often any more, so I wanted to make it count.  I was very tempted to go back to Gary Danko, where we've not been for a couple of years, but then I've alway wanted to try Quince, so ultimately decided to go someplace untried.  When I made the res on Opentable, I mentioned that it was our anniversary, and I think by the time we left, everyone in the place had wished us happy anniversary at least once.\n\nWe started off with a cocktail  - me a martini, and he a gin and tonic.  Nothing extraordinary about them, but the olives were very tasty.  They started us out with two amuses bouches, a tiny rosemary madeleine, about the size of my thumbnail with a goat cheese ricotta spread.  The bread was a little too sweet, but the spread, which as a non goat cheese fan I expected not to like, was a lovely texture, almost like butter, and a tart, fresh taste, with only minimal \"goatiness\".  The other was a smoked eel and potato croquette, about the size of half my pinkie.  It had exquisite smokiness, and perfect texture.  Then, in commemoration of our anniv. they sent over a barely seared tiny piece of mackerel with citrus (I think tangerine).  I had none of the oily assertiveness I usually associate with mackerel, and was a huge hit.  Finally we got a cool saffron broth with a little dungeness crab, and a deeply seafood flavored foam, maybe, some tomato?  It was one of the highlghts of the night, even though it was about the size of half of a demitasse.\n\nBetween the two of us, here's what we got:\n\nFava bean mousse with prosciutto and verbena ice milk:  the ice milk was tart and acerbic and perfectly offset the sweet favas and pea shoots.  \n\nFoie gras terrine with medjool date, nastutium and radish:  Got to eat it before we can't anymore on July 1.  All I can say is I wish there were more\n\nMaccheroni with octopus, cannellinis and broccoli di ciccio:  This was very complex, buttery, with almost an anchovy note to it... perfect balance of richness, bitter tinge, and brininess from the octopus\n\nCaramelle with smoked porcini, spring onion and rosemary:  This was not high on my list.  The porcini had little flavor of smoke, or even of porcini for that matter.  It was shaved very thinly and had almost a raw quality\n\nTai Snapper with razor clam, fenel, castelvetrano olives and saffron:  very clean and fresh tasting.  The clams were cut small, and added a lovely textural note.  The fennel was almost indiscernable.\n\nSuckling pig with green strawberry, onion and mustard:  I never realized their little chops would be so tiny.  I was looking forward to the \"green strawberry\", thinking I'd never had it before, but it didn't have much of a strawberry identity, almost seemed citrussy\n\nSzechuan pepper roasted pineapple, yuzu caramel, macadamia and cconut sorbet:  The sorbet was the best part of it.  They applied the caramel tableside and my husband said it too was very tasty, but they were too stingy with it.\n\nCheese Cart, which was probably over doing it and led to a 2am heartburn, I think, but the total standout cheese was a soft rind, perfectly runny cheese called Dancing Fern, from Tennessee, of all places.  I hope to find a source of it.\n\nService was perfect.  We never felt it was stiff or overly obsequious.  I like the atmosphere.  In comparing it with Gary Danko, I'd say it loses by a hair, but the atmosphere is definitely more comfortable.\n\nWith foie supplement, cheese cart supplement, 4 glasses of wine and 2 cocktails, plus $12 for parking, it was just over $350, before tip.\n\nFood: 37/40\nService:  19/20\nAtm/intang:  19/20\nValue:  19/20\nOverall:  94 = A=5 stars", "author": "Diane B."}

The food was delectable, the ambiance romantic, and the service symphonic.  Unfortunately, our otherwise perfect dining experience was spoiled by one business practice:  the use of supplementary charges on the prix fix menu. \n\nQuince offers three tasting menus at fixed prices:  a five-course menu for $130 per person and two nine-course menus for $180 per person.  To coordinate service, couples must choose menus with the same number of courses. If the couple does not want to eat the exact same food, and wanted some variety, the only alternative was to pay $30 for a supplementary item. This violates the concept of \"prix fix\".\n\nIn addition, though the soft romantic lighting creates a wonderful ambiance, in combination with the tiny font used in the print, the menu is difficult to read.  For us, we were not aware of the additional charge for the supplement until our check arrived.\n\nAt upper echelon establishments like Quince, the chef sets the menu and the restaurant sets the price.

When my wife ordered the wine he brought the bottle around and acted almost as though he didn't have time to tell her about it.  He asked if she knew very much about the wine, which she did (she loves that type of stuff) so he made a comment similar to, \"oh okay well I won't get in to it much since you know about it already.\"  But he said it with a slightly sarcastic tone.  Complete bullshit.  Then, the Asian guy that brings out all the tastings to you can barely speak English!!  Several times my wife and I had to ask him to repeat himself because we didn't understand him.  WTF?  Seriously?  He must have been the head Chef's nephew or something....I have no clue how the hell you'd hire someone for that particular job, who can't even pronounce the ingredients in the damn food!\n\nAlso, at Gary Danko's, hell Progress, and of course Meadow Wood (I won't even mention the French Laundry since Quince is a burger joint compared to that place), if a crumb fell on the table it was wiped off immediately.  Try having our table covered in so many crumbs from bread they served...which was nothing spectacular at all, that I had to wipe them off.  I know that sounds petty, but hey, this is a two Michelin star restaurant, supposedly, so it should be held to that standard.  Oh, and our \"head waiter,\" the dick that acted like he was to good to tell my wife about the wine, forgot to bring out the butter which he asked if we wanted, and we said yes.  He forgot to bring the butter?!?!  Seriously, the Olive Garden doesn't do shit like that.  But hey, I'm only spending almost a grand to eat here, right? \n\nShould I mention how long it took for them to clear our table between each tasting?  We sat there with empty plates staring at us.  Other Michelin restaurants we've eaten at, before the fork hit the plate they were taking it away and getting it ready for the next presentation.  Or the fact my martini glass would sit empty  for a while until I was offered another one and then a while longer before the empty glass was cleared?  Normally, like at Rich Table where we ate the night before, my drink never went empty.  \n\nNow, the food.  It was good, but NOTHING great.  Nothing that made my wife and say, \"holly crap that is amazing!\"  Innovative is a word that is lost on the food here.  We love going to \"top rated\" restaurants like this because we are always so impressed with the things they can do with food.   Shit, at Alinea earlier this year they brought out a balloon filled with helium made of liquorice that you sucked out and then ate!  Here, the highlight of the night was leaving and getting desert at the Ritz.  I don't know if the Chef is on vacation, sucks this bad, or the people in the kitchen are just cooking up whatever they feel like, but this food was not worth the money, at all!!!  It's crazy when you go to a place like Meadow Wood, French Laundry, Blanca, Soto, and experience that level of service...and come here, and get this.  \n\nHell, Rich Table doesn't have a Michelin star but their tasting menu wiped it's ass with this food.  Not to be so harsh, but you have no idea how pissed off we were when we left, and felt like we blew $800.  Well $960, I did tip 20%.  My wife and I were talking tonight about how bad this place was.  No wonder it's so easy to get reservations here!  \n\nOne bright spot though, and this was a serious bright spot, Juan, one of the waiters, amazing!  So friendly, informative.  Juan, you belong in a real restaurant surrounded by people who believe in who they work for and what they are presenting/serving!   \n\nUnless you hate yourself or the person you are recommending this place to, I would not even waste minutes on your phone or gigs of data to make a reservation here.  If this even has a Michelin star next time they come around, I will loose all respect for that rating system.  This place, the chef, everyone there should be embarrassed of the crap they are putting out and the service they are giving.  \n\nOne last thing, dick-head waiter who thought he was better then my wife and I, when he dropped the check.....didn't even fucking thank us for coming in.  He literally just dropped the check after we paid and walked off!!!!!", "author": "C R."}

The wait assist (guy who picked up the crumbs and served us water) was both attentive and not intrusive.  His service was as it should be, but not everyone on their waitstaff was as good.\n\nGarden menu: the first two courses were creative and interesting, and the third course, a pasta course, was enjoyable, too.  These were followed by two more pasta with cheese dishes, neither of which was particularly special and seemed to fill holes left in the menu by (maybe) a lack of fresh, local produce that simply isn't available during winter months. The main course includes two options and I selected the vegetable option, a primarily pumpkin dish. Again, the dish was ok, but not great and not very creative. A very bitter and pithy tasting custard dish followed that left me wondering whether the chef had tasted it before sending it out. I love custard in almost any form, but I am sorry to say, not this one. A fruit-filled dessert course provided a more upbeat ending to this meal, followed by a few small assorted petite-fours. \n\nThe Garden Menu meal was underwhelming, but my dining companion did fare slightly better with the Quince (meat-eating) menu. Still, we've had better, more creative, more flavorful tasting menu meals at restaurants having one (or no) Michelin star(s), and can't quite agree with those who feel this restaurant deserves two stars.\n\nThe ambiance is nice enough, but not memorable.\n\nWe'll look forward to future meals in this great city, but we won't be dining at Quince again.", "author": "Lisa G."}

The friendly waiter brought me another dish -- ooo yummm! Good thing my friend showed up when she did because I almost polished off another little dish of these *tasty* little potato chips. \n\nFor dinner, I had the Alaskan halibut with soft-shelled crawfish and asparagus surrounded and then lightly covered with this lovely buttery, potatoe-y (I know that's not a word), creamy sauce - this sauce was sopped up with my bread later. And they give you a choice of breads, and they were all completely irresistible. Yummm, my plate was pretty much clean when the waiter came by to pick it up! Oh and I also had a Drusian prosecco towards the end of my meal - smooth, sweet and bubbly - loved it! \n\nWe both didn't have room for dessert, so we passed on ordering one, but the waiter brought us 3 tiny dessert tastes: a tiny cute cream puff, a lychee jellee circle and a tiny chocolate-y, crunchy brownie with a tiny gold leaf on top (nice!). Mmm, those all hit the spot and tastily finished off our meal - nice touch! \n\nThe service was smile-y and friendly, and I chatted with all of the staff and they freely answered all of our questions throughout.

My boyfriend and I have been wanting to come here for a while and we decided that his Quince would be a great way to mark his 25th birthday. We are self proclaimed foodies, having explored the array of Michelin restaurants from 1-3 stars, and thought this was one of the best experiences we've had.\n\nI wanted to do something special for his 25th, so I decided to buy 25 presents. Then came the part of figuring out how to give someone 25 presents. Here is where I reached out to Quince to see if they would be able to assist me in delivering these presents throughout our tasting menu. To my surprise, they said yes and I was beyond thrilled. Katrina, with whom I spoke with to arrange this was very helpful in having me try to figure out a plan on how to space out my 25 presents through the Chefs Tasting Menu.\n\nThe food was amazing. I've read reviews with some people complaining that its too salty, but I disagree. Yes, if you take parts of the dish by itself it may be a bit salty, but remember a chef conceptualizes the dish to be eaten as a whole, so once you take a bite of this and a bite of that, it all makes perfect sense.\n\nWe loved all of the food and felt that each dish was unique in its own way. My boyfriend stated that the wine tasting was a must to understand how the different flavors in the dish play together. We also loved all the assistance that everyone provided in bringing out the gifts, and even taking boxes and wrapping paper away.\n\nThank you Quince for helping me out in executing my crazy idea, and more importantly for an amazing meal we both will remember!", "author": "Yanna L."}

Some dishes were better than other. The abalone was good but the parsnip was a bit strong. The pasta dishes were so good and we took them with the white truffle. We should have hold onto the truffle as it is the beginning of the season and they are not at their best yet. \nThe caviar dish was great but we did not like they make the creme fraiche so thick.

Elegant place, impeccable service, amazing food presentation, and perfect food execution. \n\nThis is not a spot for the budget conscious or for folks who expect to scarf down heaping portions of food. One thing I have noted since I started frequenting higher end food establishments, is that the reason they tend to make smaller portions, tends to be because good food is incredibly rich, and you don't need to compensate with giant portions to feel stuffed. Quince manages to serve just the right amount of everything in my opinion. \n\nI went for my birthday dinner with my best friend, and he and I opted for the 9 course chef's tasting menu. My...dear...lord!!! \n\nI should preface, by saying that my buddy has stellar taste in rare and vintage wines, so he brought an '00 Beaufort Grand Cru champagne, and then surprised the hell out of me with an '82 Gaja Barbaresco Sori San Lorenzo (which is one of the single vintage plots). Gaja is my all time favorite Italian library wine, so I nearly fell out of my chair when he told me that was going to pair with our meal. If you need to get a gauge of how good the Gaja is, check any high end restaurants wine menu, and see what the younger vintages go for...it's insanely pricey, but worth every damn penny.\n\nI honestly can't even recall every single dish we had in the tasting, but we both noted that each dish seemed to somehow tie in to the last. The presentation, as I noted before, was beautiful, and the execution was just plain great. \n\nThe standouts for me were the Isle of Skye blue lobster fagotelli (a pasta dish), the Scottish langoustine crudo (with royal osetra caviar), and the Watson Farm spring lamb w/ fava beans. Absolutely a \"death row\" meal if I've ever had one.\n\nApparently the tasting menu has an optional cheese course, but how anyone could eat that alongside the other courses is beyond me. I did see the infamous cheese cart though, and despite the fact that I was stuffed to the gullet, it was still tempting. \n\nThe desserts were great, as were the hand made cocktails, and the service was perfect throughout. \n\nUnless you're rolling in $$, this isn't a place you'll be at very often, but if you can either save the cash, or if you're wealthy, I say Quince is 110% not to be missed.\n\nNext up...Cotogna, which if I'm to understand correctly, is Quince's slightly more casual twin next door. \n\nThanks for a very happy birthday meal Quince!!!\n\n*note - While we brought our own wines in, the wine menu there is superb.

After living together in the city for a few years, we have both (unfortunately) developed some fairly high standards when it comes to fine dining. It's not often we are blown away. Quince stands out from the crowd and has earned a spot as one of my favorite high end spots in the city. The flavors in every dish have a sense of depth and refinement that is rare in even the best Michelin star restaurants. The service is also excellent with a top tier, friendly and extremely knowledgeable wait staff. \n\nThere are two ways to dine at Quince -  The Chef's Tasting Menu which is a 10 course prix fixe menu or \"Dinner\" which is also essentially a tasting menu, but consists of 4 courses. We chose Dinner given that in our experience, the double digit courses can be a bit overwhelming. IMO, I'd rather have less courses and have a chance to enjoy each slowly, than embarking on a 3 hour feeding session.\n\nI started with the English Pea Vellutata (which is a cold pea soup). I like soup, but ordering it at a restaurant is not something I typically do. However after hearing the waiter describe it, I couldn't resist. I am glad I ventured, as the flavors were unreal. The soup was so fresh and vibrant, that it tasted more like peas than...well, peas. Unreal. There were also some delicious crunchy cheesy things in there that kept the dish from being entirely healthy, but contrasted well with the other flavors and enhanced the dish.\n\nFor our second dish, we both had the \"Carnaroli Risotto alla Modenese.\" The dish is just absurd...by far the best risotto I have ever had. The creamy, rich and pungent flavors of the cheese sauce contrasted beautifully with the sweetness and bitterness of the 25 year old balsamic vinegar glaze. I could go on describing this dish longer, but instead I recommend that you try this. You won't regret it.\n\nFor my main, I had the St. Canut Farm Suckling Pig. The pork was cooked to perfection and the cut was amazing. It was a great dish, but probably not quite as mind blowing as the Risotto, but one of the better pork dishes I have had in recent memory. Essentially the chef started with an amazing cut of meat, and cooked it to perfection - not much more you can ask for. Although the temperature was slightly cooler than I would have liked.\n\nAnd finally, for dessert, I indulged on the Szechuan Pepper Roasted Pineapple. Another somewhat unusual choice for me - fruit for dessert, is not exactly my go-to. But I am glad I ventured, as this dish rivaled the pea soup in terms of enhancing the flavors of the produce. The Szechuan pineapple reminded me somewhat of dried fruit in terms of the pure concentration of fruit flavor, but it wasn't dry at all. It was still juicy and amazing. I highly recommend this dessert. Mind blown.\n\nDessert was extended by the addition of a beautiful arrangement of confectionery treats including some particularly good macaroons. This was accompanied with a rather large cup of nuts dipped in toffee (if my memory serves). The second round of sweets were delicious and inspired, but at this point, we were both full and ready to call it a night. None the less, I always appreciate the little extras (in this case not so little) that chefs sometimes share with their diners.\n\nAll in all, this was a great experience that my fiancee and I will remember for a long time. I highly recommend Quince for special occasions or if you are just looking to treat yourself to a night of spectacular flavors, local ingredients and exceptional service.", "author": "Scott V."}

I'm sure that's because regulars who love this place so much had already tried everything on their menu. We have standing reservations here every month, so soon enough, I'll remember their menu by heart, (Not quite, bad in Italian Pronunciation) but I can locate it on the menu and point it out quickly! :0)\n\nThe 3 must haves:\n\n\"casoncelli alla bergamasco\" ricotta della casa, acacia honey and hot pepper. (We order this each time we dine here. So delightfully mouth watering.)\n\n\"ravioli giganti della casa\"\nchantenay carrot, beet, burrata cheese, artichoke and wild nettle (This gorgeously colorful ravioli was delicious!)\n\nRaviolo of Bellwether Farm ricotta (Wow, can they make an egg taste any more flavorful? It's so stylishly TASTEFUL. Can never get enough of this.)", "author": "Sweet P."}

Compared to other  2 star Michelin restaurants in the US I have been to (Corton, Marea, Joel Robuchon, Gordon Ramsey), I found the food taste to be less than par and service comparatively slow and thoughtless. While the setting is beautiful and dishes were properly announced, there was no sommelier to assist, maitre-d' was excessively rigid and then excessively casual (\"I'm going to brew another pot of coffee anyway\"), no amuse bouche or interlude courses to clean the palate, and- most importantly- most dishes lacked the flavorful punch of freshness. It was as if the sous chef had gone shopping for the ingredients one week earlier instead of the same day. There was a very boring duo of pasta courses, unremarkable dessert, lukewarm coffee, and interminable delays between courses. A Michelin inspector would have failed this restaurant.", "author": "K C."}

Five of us enjoyed the chef's tasting menu (very highly recommend). This chef and his staff have some true talent and each and every bite was so very much enjoyed. We decided to add the uni risotto to the pairing and once again were left very happy. Attention to detail on each course was so creative and the flavors complemented each other so well. They were so accommodating with dietary restriction (one tree nut, two dairy at our table). Champagne, wine and cocktails were offered and enjoyed. Staff was fabulous, and so personable. Every person who came to the table knew each dish and its ingredients inside and out. We didn't get a pretentious vibe as sometimes you do with high end restaurants.

We came for our 2 year anniversary. Right from the start we walked in and were greeted, sat down in the comfy chair my girlfriend sat on the couch which was very nice. The restaurant is breath taking I love the old Brick and the chandler. \nNow I will say this the servers and staff and anyone who worked there were very polite. As my girlfriend said we were treated like kings and queens. We had the 5 course with the wine pairing. Totally worth every penny. The food was impeccable, from the smell to the taste to the pairing of German brut with my sturgeon and caviar. Very delectable every course over exceeded our expectations. We were both blown away by the service as well as the food. I would recommend going here for any occasion. Also I have to say this, my girlfriend on the other hand would prefer me not to mention this but I am going to tell you that my girlfriend bought new shoes for this special occasion. On her way out of the bathroom her high heel shoes broke and were not walkable, so our server put the heels in a nice bag. Came back 20 minutes later with some nice sandals to replace her broken heels. This server saved the night for my girlfriend seeing that is we went to a comedy club afterwards with no other shoe stores open. This restaurant goes above and beyond the call of duty.  I will be back many more times with service like this. You bet I will be back. Now one more thing I shall say is the ambience is perfect nothing to remark about it. Chef Tush is absolutely the best.  Desert is spectacular, excellent presentation. And valet parking was most helpful. Also I want to mention as we were leaving our server brought us two to go Italian sodas in their old fashion bottles with paper straws. Well I hope my review has helped you on making your choice I would love to say more about this wonderful place but it wouldn't be necessary. Just go and enjoy.", "author": "David T."}

If time is an issue then the 4-course menu takes 2 hours and the tasting menu takes 3 hours to complete.  The service at Quince is impeccable.\n\nWe went for the tasting menu and cocktails instead of wine.  Their specialty cocktail list is short, but the two that I had were great.

This usually means daring LBD's, cherry and magnolia blossoms that perfume the air and balmy evenings dipped in champagne wishes.  \n\nI miss the wood paneled interior of the old Quince, but the the open window that gave a glimpse to the inner sanctum of the kitchen was a welcome sight.  As we were about to go inside,  we noticed one of the sous chef glazing a duck and carefully applying a coating of glaze.  Among other things, the shelves were neatly poised from the shiny cooking pans to the immaculate prepping tables.\n\nThe hosting area was modern and spacious with a statuesque mirror to agrandize the place. Our table was in a cozy main dining room which appeared like a tent made of white tavertine marble.  At the center was the magnificent fern like fronds of crystal chandelier.  It was modern compared to the old venetian milk glass chandelier of the past (later found them now hanging in the restrooms).  Jeff Wall size pictures adorn the walls, the one at our sight, echoed the sun peaking through a wooded scene. The lighting was serene--that sunset glow-- warm and inviting...\n\nAmuse Bouche:\nCroquette with cheese\nBaby radish and dipping olive tapenade\nTempura of some sort with a light aoli dipping sauce\n\nAppetizer:\nNantucket bay scallops- sweet and briny \ncaviar and cauliflower with tres riche pierre moncuit champagne sauce\n\nThe sweet saffron colored sea urchin was fresh atop the unctuously dreamy, salmon colored cream with toasted riso venere providing the contrast in texture rendering the\"cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e\" definition.  Succulent dungeness crab, slivers of citrus grapefruit and fresh chervil added a medley of freshness. \n\nPasta: \nThe \"tortellini en brodo\" distilled over hours of simmering into a clear, complex rich broth and  tortellini filled with veal sweetbread and foie gras. The broth was somewhat overpowering to the delicate sweetbread and ohhh how I searched for that foie gras taste...couldn't find it!\n\nMr. Tusk served the \"casoncelli verdi\" to President Obama during his visit here a few days ago and rightly so-- the Cowgirl Creamery cheese, barinaga ranch basseri delicate and nutty flavor went well with and winter greens pasta shaped as little boats then glazed with Capezzana olive oil. *Note to self-- from now on always add a dollop of fresh Capezzana olive oil to any pasta dish.\n\nMain Course:\nThe duck was the showcase of the evening and justly presented before carving.  It appeared as a sculptured piece, evenly coated in that dark caramel color from the saffron-acacia honey coating then plated with grilled kishu mandarin and turnips-- homage to the canard a l'orange classic with the sweetness and smoky outer skin flavor with dark crimson duck au jus.  The Liberty duck breast meat was slightly gamy, but did not taste like a fine rib eye steak and at times was still a bit hard to cut into pieces. The au jus however complimented it nicely. I would have preferred a crispy skin and thought there was too much fat still unrendered and making it hearty.  My dining companion agreed and we only finished half of it. \n\nOur dessert, the mandarin creamsicle was outstanding-- hazelnut streusel, vanilla bean semifreddo and toasted brioche couli.  A selection of mignardise followed but was so full I could only attempt at the truffle chocolates x2 and a macaron :-)\n\nThe wine: Brovia, Nebbiolo d'Alba \"Valmaggione\" 2008. A nice light cranberry color with soft layers of cherry, strawberry and rose on the palate-- a delicate start with even tannins and a slight white peppery finish. \n\nThe service was impeccable and crisp from the pouring of wine to the bathroom checks...hmmm \n\nPS:\n\nMinus 1 star this time because of the duck-- it was gorgeous to look at but did not lend itself to taste.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-09-25", "description": "So let me start by saying I am a hugh fan of Chef Tusk.  We have eaten at the original location multiple times loving EVERY MEAL there.  For some reason we never made it to \"Qince 2.0\" so I never saw the space prior to tonight.  So with that in mind as we enter the restaurant remebering all of the amazing pasta and meat courses we have expierenced over the years past, I began to get very excited for this meal.  The new \"Quince 3.0\" was beautifully remodeled reminding us more of that Manhattan restaurant feel.  The service was up to par for sure with a very knowledgable attentive staff.  I loved the way they walled off certain areas making the space feel intimate yet retaining the sense of a good sized room with great energy.  We sat towards the back middle looking out into the main room.\n\nI do not expect a price fixed only menu option when it came time to order, however as a fan of the 4 hour marathon eating that have done some many times in the past I was up for anything.  We had friends with us so half of us got the Garden and they other half order the Quince tasting menu.  The amuse-bouche was very pleasing.  A high light would be the house curred anchovie and the salted cod in egg shell.  As we moved ino the menu we began to notice how much better the garden menu stood up to the quince menu.  Everything that came out on the garden menu was solid.  The quince menu was left behind except for one dish.  The sunchoke casoncelli (we also opted for the White Truffle supplement here) was divine.  This is the dish that brought me back to the original Quince.  The pasta was beautifully done and the truffle added the right amount of earthiness.  \n\nI don't want to say we were disappointed but I feel like \"2 stars\" meant I can charge you a lot more for a pretty standard fare menu.  I have no problem spending $$$$ on great meals but tonight (dinner for 4 $2000) I felt slightly shorted or perhaps that the meal was more about the restaurant than giving the customer that expierence we so longed for from the original concept days of long ago.  It has only been re-opened for what a week now so maybe its still a little young and needs some work.  The spacing between courses I have to say was very inconsistent.  It felt like it could not hit that sweet spot and just start flowing.  We sat down just before 6 pm and did not finish until well after 11 pm.  On a positive note Conan was great to us nicely explaining all courses with ease.  Also I apologize I do not remember her name but we had a lovely sommelier who guided us perfectly to a great French Burgundy that made the night for me.  Thank you!  I would leave 3 stars, but really? That would be ridiculous.  Its a 5 star resturant for sure but tonight was just off for us so its 4 stars for me.", "author": "G... D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-15", "description": "This is world-class fine dining - with both service and food worthy of a full 5 stars.\n\nOnce a year or so, I make it a point to go to a world-class restaurant and indulge in a tasting menu - this year (for my birthday) that honor fell to Quince and I couldn't be happier.\n\nFrom the moment we entered, Quince took care of us and showed attention to detail that few places do. The decor is calming and tasteful (about what you would expect for a restaurant of this caliber). But the restaurant really came in to its own with the people - from the first server that walked over, everyone we spoke to was kind, helpful, friendly, and a delight.\n\nWe were celebrating a birthday that night. Since Quince only serves tasting menus (5 or 9 course) and has a higher price-point, I suspect most people go there to celebrate something, but that doesn't mean we were treated as average! When we made a reservation, they asked if we were celebrating anything and we let them know it was my birthday. When we actually sat down, the very first person to approach our table already knew that we were there to celebrate my birthday, and after confirming it, she brought us menus that actually said \"happy birthday\" with my name and date, and she promised to save them for us as keepsakes once we were done (more on that later!).\n\nWe finally settled on each doing one tasting menu. My boyfriend, the carnivore, actually opted for the 9-course pasta-based vegetarian menu and swears it was one of the best meals of his life. I had the standard 9-course Quince menu and wine pairing.\n\nEvery dish was extraordinarily composed. Almost every dish featured a local or seasonal item at its core, but there was no shortage of additional items (still seasonal or local) to round out every dish - one dish in the garden menu was at least 10 different vegetables all fresh from a local market that day, and yet despite the variety, they all blended together in great harmony! \n\nThere were touches of modernist moments, molecular-gastronomy-influenced flourishes, such as the nitrogen-cooled buttermilk crumbles that surrounded a trout roe dish. But they always felt like they added to a dish rather than competed with it - this is innovation with a purpose rather than cool food tech simply for the sake of it being cool and trendy.\n\nPortions were perfectly doled-out. No dish was too large or too weighty. Although any single dish might look small, at the end of 9 courses we were pleasingly full and content, but not overly full.\n\nThe wine pairings were well thought-out and an equal to the dishes they accompanied. The first wine pairing was presented blind - in a black glass, and they don't tell you what it is until you have had a few sips. Admittedly, I think that bit of drama (the black glass and the fact they make a big deal out of it) was a touch over the top, and I could probably do without it. But after the first course you can opt to have each wine fully explained at pouring, or you can continue in a semi-blind atmosphere, with each wine poured but not fully explained until you have had a chance to fully savor it and develop your own opinion.\n\nAt some point we were visited by another person - likely one of the floor or restaurant managers, though he never flaunted his exact title. We mentioned we were semi-recent transplants and had lived for years in Boston and had a great discussion about Boston restaurants, and how many of their staff came from No 9 Park or other well-known Boston places. That interaction typified the great service of Quince - they were attentive and interested in details, and yet were also always individual and personable, not just robotic staff members so focused on being polite that they lost all individuality.\n\nBut the moment when I knew Quince was a great restaurant focused on great service? 10 minutes after we left, when I realized we had forgotten to take the custom menu with us. After Uber-ing home, we realized our mistake and called to ask if we could pick up the menu later. The staff assured us it would be no problem and we could pick it up the next day. As I work nearby, but they are closed during the day, I called to see if I could pick it up during the day when staff is there to prep but they are not officially open. I got a call back from a manager within 15 minutes assuring me I could pick the menu up from the restaurant next door  (Cotogna). I stopped by Cotogna 10 minutes later and someone was waiting with my menu. Not only that, they remembered our visit from the previous night and briefly chatted with me, thanking me for my visit and again discussing Boston and San Francisco culinary overlaps.\n\nIs Quince the best restaurant I have ever been to? No, probably not. That honor may have to go to O Ya or Tetsuya's. But surely Quince is one of the top places I have been to, and the focus on both amazing ingredients and stellar service makes it worthy of a a visit (or maybe more than one as the menu changes daily).", "author": "Jane B."}

Mmm, just soak it up. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love eating out at chic spots and playing hoity-toity once in a while, but Quince is a time warp...the Titanic? Mad Men? It's from a bygone era, that's for sure. And the fanciest place I've been in SF, for sure. Which makes it a prime place for a special night out. A little stuffy and pretentious for a first date (unless you're Donald Trump), but good for impressing clients or the in-laws. \n\nThe service is choreographed down to the tiniest detail. You can sit back, rest assured that they will anticipate your every want and need before you're even aware of it. We had a whole army of servers, busers, and sommelier at our service, without ever having to beckon them. We resisted the so-so 5-course tasting menu and picked 3 courses of our own from the main menu, which were all superb, in that minimalist sort of way (I wanted to cry when the first course arrived and covered an entire 1 square inch of my plate!! Thank god there were 2 more courses to come...!) Special night. And very \"grown-up\" in every way. \n\nThe bar is very cool, not nearly as stuffy as the dining area.

The decor is very nice, elegant and modern.\n\nFirst course was a Maine lobster salad with blood orange and passionfruit - good chunks of well-cooked lobster, however I thought there was almost too much lobster to make it a salad\n\nThe second course was a fagotelli of housemade ricotta. This was a very nice filled pasta dish. The ricotta was nice and creamy and the pasta was cooked well with chanterelle mushrooms.\n\nThe third choice was a choice between goose in two preparations or spit roasted rib of beef. The goose was disappointing - the appearance was lacking as the goose was a purple-ish color, and my pieces were tough and had gristle within the meat. The beef was better and cooked well; however, was nothing special.\n\nThe dessert, a \"buche de noel,\" was actually a chocolate mousse take on a buch de noel with a creamy sorbet. A nice dessert, as it was not too sweet, but tasty.\n\nIn all, the meal was above average. The service was flawless.

We were very excited to try Quince...\n\nOur reservation was for 830. We arrived early and sat at the bar to enjoy a drink and just take it all in.  Bar staff weren't very welcoming...rather serious and cold, if you ask me. \n\nWe didn't get seated till 845. Took about 15 mins for someone to greet us at the table and begin the dining experience.  Each course was delivered by someone different, which isn't uncommon, but each waiter was very soft spoken and hard to hear. I had to repeat questions several times. It was a challenge. The presentation of each dish felt rushed.   \n\nOverall, the service didn't feel personalized or special, as it should at a place like this. Instead it felt like a machine with staffers bringing you the next dish and then rushing to another table.  Personally, I like having one head waiter that drives the train and acts as your caretaker for the dinner and checking in on you by name. That's just me. \n\nAnd strangely, while the delivery of dishes was fast, the pacing between courses was as slow as a turtle. Painfully SLOW. With an 8 course tasting, we were thinking maybe a 2-2.5 hr experience.  Let me just say, we left at midnight, so it was almost 3.5-4 hours. I nearly fell asleep at the table.  \n\nThe food and plating was outstanding/ fantastic/wonderful and mind blowing, so 5 stars to the chef!, but the service and experience just killed it for us. I lost interest after the 6th course. We asked them to speed things up a bit, which sounded so inappropriate at a restaurant like this, but we had no choice. \n\nI was really disappointed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-10-07", "description": "The birthday celebration for Alyssa J. Rapp was a beautiful 20 person private dining affair at a well known San Franciscan destination named Quince. We were treated to a tour of the private wine cellar and a delicious rose bubbly before sitting down to our four course meal.\n\nAlyssa chose the wine pairings which, not surprisingly, delivered a perfect complement to each course and presented a highlight in their own right. The food, however, was disappointing. I realize expectations run high for a one-star Michelin rated restaurant, but I arrived with an open mind. Our first two courses displayed signs of brilliance and quality of exceptional cuisine, but not consistently and certainly not with the main course. Private parties of large size probably present unique challenges to the kitchen, but that is not an excuse. I would also like to see and possibly explore the entire menu, but all I have to work with is our meal.\n\nOur amuse-bouche was a delicious melon gazpacho with mint and cucumber. The first course was a single seared scallop topped with a muscle served over a potato puree. The scallop was perfectly cooked and tender, but I did not see how the oyster or puree added to the flavor of the dish. It was a nice start, but too bland with all the ingredients used.\n\nOur second course was the best and a popular favorite among the diners. It was roasted red pepper and cheese filled tortelloni. There were amazing flavors that grew more complex with each bite. The pasta was handmade and tasted fresh. Everything worked well and I could have consumed at least 10 more.\n\nThe main course was a choice between chicken and lamb. I choose lamb and Erica chose chicken. Neither dish impressed us. My lamb had flavor but did not seem to be anything more complicated than what I or my better cooking friends could produce at home on our grill. There was no sauce and the sides of fingerling potato and artichoke puree were small and strange, respectively. It was also a rather small portion, especially for the main course of a four course meal. Erica's report on the chicken was similar and my one taste did not reveal anything I would describe as special.\n\nAlyssa made a good decision by selecting a cheese course as opposed to a traditional dessert. The cheeses were very good and well portioned. I could have done twice as many, but I love cheese and some self restraint is a valuable quality. I don't know how much credit to give a restaurant for a cheese plate. They didn't make the cheese, but I recognize there is a skill to selecting high quality cheese. The wine pairing stole the show though - Chateau Haut-Peyraguey Bordeaux, Sauternes, 2005 . It was the best dessert wine I have enjoyed because it was not overly sweet. There was a perfect balance of smoothness and sweetness that leaves a special taste and feeling in the mouth. Perhaps the wine is the reason I loved the cheese so much...\n\nI hate to sound like the meal wasn't great, but the best part of the evening was not the food. We were with great company in a beautiful private room drinking world class wine. One dish was worthy of high acclaim, but the rest were forgettable. I am certain Quince is deserving of the recognition and awards and I would like to return for delicious Italian cuisine. If the tortelloni were any indication, I bet there are some knock-out pasta dishes. For now, it was a great birthday celebration with many more to follow.", "author": "Jeff R."}

The experience was nice, and the ambiance is very cool.  It just wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be.  We did the chef's tasting menu along with the wine pairing.  When we were seated, we were given menus and when the server came over, she didn't really say much other than asked if we had any questions.  It would have been nice to hear a little about the menu, wine pairings, etc.. I don't even think she asked us how we were doing. When each course was brought out, there wasn't much of an explanation as to what it was, how it was prepared, etc, so we asked for the menu back so we could read about it. \n\nThe food was nice, although I do agree with some of the other reviewers when they mention it being a tad too salty.  The wine pairings did bring out some of the courses, but I would have liked to try a couple more red wines.  Nothing was really stand out amazing when it came to the food.  We did enjoy the asparagus course, and the pasta courses were nice too.  \n\nWe had a nice evening, other than the obnoxiously pretentious couple sitting next to us that had just \"flown in for the evening\".  They were being pretty rude to the server and their conversation was loud and annoying to be right next to!  Maybe if we just did the 4 course menu we would have enjoyed the food more.  For the price ($600+), the food and wine should have been much more memorable.  It was nice to try a new place, but we'll stick to Gary Danko from now on where we always leave looking forward to our next visit!", "author": "Kristen V."}

It's often easy to get jaded on appreciating things in life, as it is also extremely difficult to create special and wonderful things regularly.  Quince and Mr. Tusk don't need me to add any more to their chapter, I write because this diary of meals will be appreciated more when they are looked back upon, for the reader if they do come across it I describe a prix fixe menu made special on an evening, which perhaps has been done previously on so many occasions, but after 11 years I find it simply extraordinary.   \n\nThe six course menu offers pairings of old world champagne and wines, I didn't have enough context (except the Taittinger '05) as I've been west coast loyal but they offered balance, acidity and fruit to each course.  \n\nThe menu is clean, osetra caviar presented three ways, my favorite being on panna cotta and then the saltier toasted brioche.  A veloute with bay scallops is wonderful, and goose tortelli are amazing scattering cream and the right amounts of vinegar.  The main wagyu is wagyu, thankful that it is allowed to be just that with the right amounts of accompanying parts and nothing else.  Fine dining doesn't need to be covered with butter and salt.\n\nAnd the amuse bouche, presented oh so lovely and pretty to look at.  Some are tiny with intricate detail, while others pack so much flavored cheese, or are simply a beet, pure and confident to stand alone.  Dessert comes with guajana chocolate, and then more affectionate chocolate offerings.  Thank you for the impromptu lemon cheesecake to celebrate a belated birthday.\n\nAnd thank you Mr. Tusk for shaving truffles at our table :)   \n\nGrazie per i ricordi", "author": "M K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-08-01", "description": "I didn't want to drink the Kool Aid.  I wanted to be able to write a review that this place was all flash and hype (like a restaurant that begins with \"Gar\" and ends in \"anko\").  Sadly, the meal was amazing and I had to give 5 stars.  Quince is both obsessed with local sourcing and obsessed with culinary innovation.  I am so tired of places that brag about having the freshest and most local beet only to place it alone on a plate with some other boring vegetable.  If local produce tastes great alone, it will taste amazing when top culinary graduates work their magic.\n\nAmuse Bouche: A cool interpretation of melon wrapped prosciutto.  A chilled honeydew soup with crisped prosciutto flakes to stir in.  More like pancetta at this point, lacking the typical prosciutto silkiness.  The crunchy texture and increased salt factor worked well.  \n\nJapanese Octopus \"Al Vapore\": I don't think I've ever had octopus this perfectly prepared even at upscale sushi joints.  Octopus does not have have to be rubbery or burnt to a char.  These small slices were tender like a nice slice of holiday ham.  The crisp haricot verts helped give some crunch to each bite.  Though they advertised Persian mint and fresh coriander as the flavoring, I swear there was a subtle spicy pepper element going on.\n\nSenatore Cappelli Spaghetti: \"Senatore cappelli\" sounds a lot better then the English translation \"senator hats\" (which are probably quite oily in the U.S.)!  I had to order this dish because it was pasta with espresso and melon!!!  Really?  Who does that?  Apparently Quince and apparently they know what they're doing!  The coffee bean dust brought out a deeper savory side to the clams, similar to what coffee rubs do to grilled meats.  The fresh cantaloupe and honeydew mini balls helped counter the bitter aftertaste.  The perfectly al dente spaghetti gave a much needed chewy element because the rest of the ingredients weren't much to bite into.\n\nSuckling Pig: I could suckling on this pig all night long!  Several thin loin cuts with just a strand of baby fat attached.  Melt away tender, way softer than those old pigs.  The grilled eggplant circles were not a good choice because they looked too similar to the trotter circles.  Speaking of, not sure how they got those feet into a disc form, but they sure were tasty.  I liked the green chickpea mush since it was novel to me, though I'm not sure if the herbal undertone was added in or the natural taste of green chickpea.\n\nDevil's Gulch Rabbit \"Tre Modi\": A 3-way not to be missed!  The tiny rib rack had a firmer texture than the other cuts.  The loin wrapped in herbed lard was an excellent way to add fatty goodness to a smooth lean loin.  Wasn't much a fan of the skewer that had dark meat and innards (liver).  For such temperamental components you'd almost expect a terrine or p\u00e2t\u00e9.\n\nLemon Verbena Souffl\u00e9: It was actually part of the tasting menu, but eating at the bar near closing time has the advantage of no one else ordering a tasting menu which means no need to reserve the dishes.  Came out surprisingly quick for a souffl\u00e9.  Was puffy and airy as it should be.  The lemon verbena wasn't that strong though so the eggy/custardy flavors dominated unfortunately.  Also, wasn't a fan of the sour yogurt ice cream as a pairing.\n\nPanna Cotta: Very creamy.  The fresh raspberries were perfectly in season.  A great standard, though lacked the innovation found in other dishes.", "author": "Adam B."}

I couldn't understand one of the waiters/bus boys: thick latin accent. And with the menu being so special, I wanted to hear was I was being served. I had decided I was going to ask for a change of waiters, but fortunately he stopped coming over before I had to make that call.\n\n2. They took 5-10 minutes to get us an answer about a wine question we had. Specifically, their wine expert was busy evidently.

I've been to a few expensive restaurants around the city that did not live up to its hype (La Folie, Fleur de Lys, etc.), so perhaps I was trying to keep my expectations low before walking into the restaurant.  There were some reviews about the food being too salty but the flavor of the food at Quince fit my palette just fine.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e LOVED it.  I was a total hero for picking this restaurant out to try for his birthday celebration instead of our tried and true Gary Danko.  All the components of each dish blended very well together--mix of flavors and textures.\n\nThe entire table has to go with either the 4-course \"dinner\" menu or the 10-course tasting menu.  After a little bit of deliberation, we finally decided to go with the Chef's Tasting Menu.  I think we made a good choice.  It may sound like a lot, but I'm sure we would have been equally full with the 4-course menu.  Pros of going with the 10-course:\n\n1) More variety\n2) I get to try dishes I normally would not consider ordering\n3) With the smaller portions, each dish is not as daunting as you became more and more full\n4) With the smaller portions, I tend to savor each bite a little more really trying to taste out the flavors\n\nWe were served three amuse bouche before the meal even began.  All three were scrumptious, refreshing, and flavorful.\n\nKing Salmon Crudo - All the components and textures combined were yummy, yummy, yummy.\n\nScottish Langoustine - The waiter said that he could substitute this for the Dungeness crab instead if we wanted to, but we decided to give this a whirl and it did not disappoint.\n\nWhite Asparagus - The fianc\u00e9e really liked this one.  It was good but I'm not in love with asparagus.  The mushroom flavor and sauce was really good.\n\n \"Orecchiette Della Casa\" - The pasta was very al dente, just the way I like.  There were some crumbs in this dish that reminded us of this really memorable dish we tried when we were in Milan.  This dish brought my fianc\u00e9e back to our Italy experience.  Again, good flavor.\n\nSea Urchin, Lardo and Hot Pepper - That sea urchin was the best sea urchin I've ever had.  Flavor and texture were good.  Yes, I did get a late start in the game with liking uni, but it was GOOD.  Flavor, texture, yum.\n\nBurnt Flour \"Fagotelli\" - Don't really remember this one, but the burnt flour tastes interesting.  Don't worry.  It doesn't taste burnt.\n\nHeger Farm Corn, Young Onion and Leek Scape - The corn was sweet, very good.  A nice contrast and a way to clean our palettes after all the savory dishes.\n\nFour Story Hill Farm Sweetbread - Think this dish was a little too pedestrian for us at a restaurant like Quince.  The sweetbread tasted like chicken.  We swore we were eating chicken.\n\nArtichoke, Fava Bean and Burgundy Truffle - The fava bean was cooked just right.  Truffle sauce worked very well in the dish.\n\nLiberty Farm Duck - The duck was cooked perfectly.  Flavors were good on this dish.\n\nTory Farm Peach, Turnip, Porcini Mushroom and Rooftop Honey - This one was good, but I wasn't completed wowed.\n\nCherry Sorbet - Refreshing, nice way to cleanse the palette, good, but not exceptional.\n\nChocolate Marquise - Too rich for me.\n\nMignardise - The macaron was good and there was one other item we liked, but the rest did not suit my tastes--not to say they were not good desserts.\n\nService was excellent.  That includes service from the host, the person who took my coat, our waiter, and each member of the wait staff.  No one acted snooty towards us as I had read in some of the other reviews.\n\nI thought it was really cool that the waiters coordinated the timing of when they placed dishes on the table for bigger groups.  The waiters had to place dishes on the table simultaneously.  I also really liked how we were given new silverware after each dish; this has never occurred at any restaurant I've been to.

Everything was overly seasoned--too salty, too sweet, and/or too rich.  This is a restaurant that ostensibly prides itself on seasonal, local ingredients, but I felt like the evening focused on ruining those (admittedly on the whole excellent) ingredients in creative ways.  I was literally eating bread between courses to get the taste out of my mouth.  It's the only time I've had a tasting menu where I wanted to say, \"please, no more.\"  Dinner for two with a bottle of wine, $450--I wish we had gone to Incanto every day for a week instead.\n\nAn extra star for the service and decor.", "author": "Ben P."}

We saw the tasting menu and although the suckling pig was enticing, we went for the other side instead. Can't resist risotto with clams and snail. The waiting staff is super friendly and funny actually. One of them promised an Italian donkey would circle our table 3 times for the birthday boy.\n\nSo I guess I should talk about the delicious, mouth-watering food. I HAD to start with the sformato of acorn squash because I had no clue what sformato is. Heck, I can't even pronounce it. Needless to say, I was ready for the next dishes after licking this plate clean. Mushrooms and Squash is such a great fall season food. The table had to go with the acquerello carnaroli risotto (clam, snail, garlic, and wild nettle). The risotto was al dente and perfect. Everything was such so savory. For the main entree I went with the rack of lamb. No doubt, the meat was tender and juicy. It was a little on the salty side, but the overall meal was worth of that 1 michelin star!!\n\nI ended my night with the chocolate caramel creme... can never go wrong with caramel ice cream. The desserts here were just perfect, not super sweet which I LOVE. They also came out with a dish of varieties. The mini macarons were so cute and delicious along with this grape jelly thing.", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

Twenty?  Ten?\"\n\nThe server was cagey.  \"You mean in the city?  There's the one at Gary Danko, I think.  Of course there are tons in New York.\"\n\nIt is, in fact, a delightful cheese cart, very well stocked.  One of the best I've seen - not just in a \"look!  cheese!  on a cart!\" way, either - though a little weak in the blues.  They had two cheeses from Andante dairy the night we were there; we forced our server to go through and explain each and every one to us, which she did.  Perfectly.  From memory.  It must have taken a dozen minutes.\n\nThe cheese cart had been on my mind for some time, as it was stored behind a wall not far from our table, and every time someone walked past it, the rather ammoniated scent of washed rind cheese would waft past on the breeze.  Now, I certainly like a good stinky cheese, but it was a little distracting to smell sweaty socks periodically thoughout what was a very good meal.  There's a reason most restaurants keep the really stinky stuff under glass domes.  On the other hand, they had three or four washed rinds of varying strength where a less daring restaurant might have offered a single weak one.\n\nWe were there for my companion's birthday dinner - suitably commemorated both on the printed menu and with a candle and cake afterwards.  I ordered the chef's tasting menu ( they only offer a single tasting menu now, apparently a change in the last couple months ), and my companion arranged for the regular four course menu with an added pasta dish to match my first five courses.  We intended to share desserts, but they came out in pairs anyway without prompting.  \n\nWe also shared a wine pairing, adding a couple glasses when recommended by the server.  The wine pours were generous, and we were glad not to have both opted for full pairings.  The pairings were well thought out and worked extremely well with the dishes with which they were matched.\n\nService was very good, if the pacing was slightly slow at times.  Though it is a formal restaurant ( Jackets requested for gentlemen ), service was accommodating and friendly; not stuffy at all.  We were greeted at the door, twenty minutes early for our reservation, and seated in the lounge area for about ten minutes before being led to our table.  We had a couple of cocktails which were just okay - myself a very acidic Jackson Square Swizzle, and my companion a slightly sweet and fruity concoction of some sort whose name I disremember.\n\nThe food was very competent, excellently flavored and creative examples of Italian-inspired cuisine.  Nothing was a failure, from the tomato and uni salad to a very savory and perfectly cooked black sea bass, but there were also very few things that were anything more than artful, well executed dishes.  What we missed, I think, was a sense of delight.  Which is splitting hairs in some way, but which is a valid complaint at some level of dining.\n\nIn the end, this is one of the best restaurants in San Francisco, a classy, friendly fine dining experience with excellent food.  We enjoyed it very much.", "author": "Albert H."}

Instead of a wine pairing, we had a glass of champagne and dessert wine to celebrate.  I cannot remember the name of the dessert wine - it's supposed to be their best and a very well known dessert wine but it was absolutely worth every penny.  If my husband was more of a drinker, I could've easily guzzled a few more glasses!  Food was excellent.  We have only done a few tasting menus before and this was another wonderful culinary experience.  They do a great job of explaining each course and educating you more on their truffles and wines.  I by no means am a regular at fine dining establishments and I still felt completely comfortable here.  Great customer service.  They made us feel special and wrote a congrats message on our menus and took us to the kitchen for a tour.

Quince is very big on details - small details, lots of them, all done exactly right.  The sheer number of complex \"little things\" - each its own culinary project - is on the high end even for high end dining.  And virtually all those little things were \"right on the money\".  \n\nThe service, like the food, was detailed and impeccable.  The pacing was just right for us (about 4+ hours), but we noticed that they adjusted it table by table based on the diner's preferences.  We enjoyed some long pauses to talk and finish our wine, while others moved quickly through the nine courses.  Unspoken, but very tuned in.\n\nWe also noted very deliberate and precise control of temperatures, with several courses being multi-temperature compilations - something that is very hard to get just right.  For example, our smoked trout course had a flash-frozen green apple sauce that was giving off light wisps of nitrogen fog as it arrived at the table.  The fish was perfectly room temperature and worked so well next to the frosty bits of apple.\n\nThere was one course that had some minor textural issues - the skin on a roast squab was more waxy than crisp.  We wouldn't have mentioned it, but the the server said it was just added to the menu the previous day and asked for our feedback.\n  \nOverall, very impressive meal.

Some dick line chief decided to have his fun from across the kitchen (young tall guy, my height, 6'+, I think a goatee).  Worse thing was his sh*t-eating grin on his face as he walked away.\n\nI would think in a place like San Francisco you learn that you never know who people are, or how much money they have.  Plenty of reviewers had said they had attitudes, but I had a memorable run in.\n\nThere's lots of excellent restaurants to spend your money in (and more importantly, your expense account), so why go to a place like this?

We had both golden caviar and white truffle options. The truffle was in season and smelt exceptional. The dishes were small but we were full when we left. They gave us a warm chocolate on the way out which was a nice touch with the cold weather. Nothing against Quince.

My beef (on the four course tasting menu) was the best beef I have ever had in several years. \n\nUnfortunately I do not believe I will be back because we drank two bottles of wine, we both chose the four course tasting menu (which is the lowest priced menu) and still coughed up $600 for dinner. And I have a problem with spending that kind of money for even a nice and fancy dinner when $600 is what most people make as income in one month in most developing countries. \n\nHaving said that this place is absolutely exceptional in food, service, wine selection, etc. I highly recommend it for a special occasion or for business dinner.", "author": "bora o."}

My wife has certain dietary restrictions and Quince was the best establishment we have ever been to that remembered those restrictions with every plate.  Now to my struggles - this is one of the most expensive restaurants that one will go to. Portions are small, though there are a lot of them.  My biggest complaint is the time. Our reservation was for 8:30 on a Friday night, which we were seated early for. Our 1st course was not served until almost 9:30 and we did not leave until just after 11:30.  3 hours for dinner is excessive anywhere, even at $150 per person.", "author": "Matt H."}

After speaking to her, she told me that they do not charge for substitutions and this had to be some kind of mistake. She explained that when our server ordered the substitution, that he charged us by mistake. She did offer to refund us the $40 we were overcharged plus the tax. Now, although I'm happy that they gave us $40 back, I feel that they should have done a bit more to compensate us for the aggravation (ie. comp something on the bill or invite us to come back with some sort of incentive etc.). Even low end restaurants do this. I was at Chevy's a few weeks back and our waitress forgot submit the dessert order and without me saying anything she came over, apologized and comped it. I was so into my conversation with my bf that I honestly didn't even notice 15 minutes went by so I would not have even mentioned it. Now that's what I call customer service!\n\nI'm also a bit skeptical that the server genuinely made a mistake. He seemed like a seasoned waiter and I think that he probably was just trying to pad the bill to raise his tip which worked because I didn't catch the overcharge until I had already left and therefore he ended up with an extra $8 in his pocket. Had I seen the charge before I left, I would not have tipped him 20% due to the sheer fact he didn't mention anything unless he was willing to take the charge off at that point.\n\nOverall, I'm glad that they at least took initiative and contacted me about the charge. I still think that they need to work on their customer service though.", "author": "Diane M."}

It still has a very modern feel, although without the open kitchen, and you definitely feel like you're on a night out.  Probably a bit too large to be super romantic, but it's nice.  A nice touch is as you walk towards the restaurant you can peek into the kitchen from outside to build up the anticipation.  \n\nWe had a fixed course menu since it was Valentine's.  The breads were yummy (choice of 4 including rosemary focaccia, tasty breadsticks, onion roll and a regular roll).  The appetizer was our favorite - a fresh lobster salad with beets, foam, and an interesting taste (celery root?).  The second appetizer was also delicious - a raviolini of scallop, with truffles.  The main courses were good, but not as memorable as I would have hoped.  I had the dover sole, with hollandaise sauce, celery root puree, carrots, beets, asparagus.  My boyfriend had the roasted veal, with artichoke pie, onions and other things I can't remember.  We both liked the dishes but weren't blown away.  The dessert was our least favorite.  There was a white chocolate parfait with green tea, a milk chocolate mousse on biscuit, and then a very dry not-so-molten dark chocolate cake.  \n\noverall, the service was fantastic, and we enjoyed the evening.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-06-25", "description": "OMG, how did i NOT write a review about this place???? I LOVE LOVE LOVED my experience there and can't wait to go back! \n\nI had gone to Quince back in November for a friend's bday, and really enjoyed it. But they weren't ordering as much food as I would have ordered when I go out for fine dining (i.e. all the courses) so I felt the experience was a little incomplete. So I planned on going there at a later date with my husband (who was not at this initial dinner). \n\nI ended up taking my hubby there for this bday, and WOW, what a wonderful evening it was! They seated us in the 'best table of the house' our server told us -- the owner often likes to sit there. It's a comfortable couch seating, diagonally opposite to each other, opening into the whole room, so you can see the entire lofted space, the bar, and the street. It really is a nice table. \n\nBecause we've been rather disappointed with tasting menus at Michelin star restaurants lately, we decided to just order normal courses. When our menu arrived, by the way, it said 'Happy Birthday' to my husband with the date on it. That made me happy ... I said to my hubby, that that's the kind of service and attention to detail you expect when you're gonna blow hundreds of dollars on a dinner. Because I still have the handy dandy menu with me, I can share with you all what we got. I'm vegetarian, hubby's not, so you get a sense of both cuisines:  \n\nAppetizers: \nFirst of the Season White Asparagus with burratta cheese\nFoie Gras with huckleberry and wild arugula\n\nPrimi: \nCasoncelli (Ravioli) with ricotta della casa, acacia honey and hot pepper\nSpring Lamb Cappellacci\n \nSecondi: \nChef's choice of mixed vegetables for moi\nOrganic Cornish Hen with Asparagus, wild mushroom and onion\n\nDesserts: \nBoth on the menu ... something with chocolate and basil and a burnt honey bodino\n\nYES, this was an indulgent meal!! But oh my gosh, i loved it! \n\nMy Asparagus salad was perhaps the least exciting thing on the menu -- it was good, but nothing to write home about (like the others). The Ravioli was FREAKIN DIVINE. I have never had such pillow soft, melts in your mouth ravioli like this before. And usually when I see something without a red sauce (or even any sauce) i am skeptical ... this just had a little white sauce and a few drizzles of this hot pepper honey which was just amazing!! I would go back just for this. My husband also loved his foie gras, esp the huckleberry compote with it. And the Lamb was perfectly cooked and delectable, from what I could see on his plate (empty, looked like an unused plate by the end). \n\nI like letting the chef experiment with a vegetarian person, and create something new. I let our server know which vegetables I like (besides carrots, I think I like them all, when cooked properly). I've had several 'vegetable platters' from various restaurants, but nothing like this. Each and every vegetable tasted so amazing! The chef was from Chez Panisse, and really believes in letting the ingredient speak for itself, and that was clearly evident in this array of vegetables I was eating ... sunchokes (what are those?), wild mushrooms, parsnips (again, what are those?), and a bunch of other things I don't even remember except that they were great. The purple mashed potatoes were the least exciting thing, and I LOVE mashed potatoes!! \n\nBy this time, we were so full we decided to share one dessert, but the chef got us an extra one (w/bday candle) for my hubby's bday ... we cleared the plates on both of them. There was no room for cheese or coffee at this point. \n\nOverall, out of the 1 star Michelin restaurants that we've been to, Fleur de Lys, and Quince are my top 2 restaurants. I would go back in a heartbeat!", "author": "Antara B."}

It's not that I broke the rules, or even bent the rules. It's more that I have transcended the rules. I wasn't around when they were made, so they just don't apply to me. They're your rules---you live by them. I also ate things that aren't on the menu. Again: not my rules. Tuna tartar on house-made potato chips is a wonderful idea. Not only is the texture contrast fascinating, but salt compliments the tuna. The prosciutto-wrapped persimmons were also good, but Wifey and I have been making the same dish for weeks, and I find I like it better pan-seared. Just a thought. \n\nWe sat at a table in the middle of the room, white linened and spotlighted. The surroundings are spare, but luxurious. Like a Japanese feudal lord's castle would likely be. I have always liked the effect of good lighting on a correctly-positioned table. In the right company, you get the impression of existing alone, in a floating ball of light. The fact that we actually WERE alone probably contributed to the impression. Courses came and went. Wine pairings were poured so seamlessly that I only realized the pairing had changed when I reached for my wine and found a glass shaped differently from the last one. Furthermore, through some magic artifice of service, I don't believe any wineglass ever reached half-full. Again, I don't remember additional wine being poured, but it was. \n\nOne white became another, which became a red, which transformed into another red, to be replaced by a red dessert wine, slightly sparkling and quietly sweet (a series of five words that anyone would aspire to have ascribed to them). Stories were told, and even when we knew the story, it was told anyway because we knew we'd enjoy it. And we did. Espresso came out, in short porcelain cups with tiny caps on top. And it wasn't dark and bitter and burned (a series of five words that no one would aspire to have ascribed to them), but rather rich and layered, like an I-banker in Tahoe. \n\nMy college roommate, the astrophysicist, spent many a night trying to explain to me that the reason you can't talk about what existed before the Big Bang is that time itself did not exist before then. That time is actually a thing, almost physical in some characteristics, and that since there was no time until the Big Bang, there is no such thing as \"before\" the Big Bang. I'm not sure I completely understand, but I do understand this: while time may be roughly spherical as it sits on the universal plane, any two points within the sphere can be connected by a straight line, which is why we perceive time as linear. X then Y then Z. One result of that is that there is always an end to a thing, and always a thing that comes next.

Don't get me wrong, the food was OK, but I have to measure based on the prices they charge. \n\nOne example was the duck dish for two. The duck was brought out to us table side, it looked incredible, whole duck with a perfect crispy skin. They showed us the duck and then returned to carve it. When it was brought back on two plates, it had cooled, and the legs and wings were missing (they only presented the breast), plus nothing was done to really treat the skin of the duck.

I've dined at Quince twice (2011 and 2013) and both were amazing dining experiences. The dining area is very elegant and the surrealist paintings around the restaurant are outstanding (take a look at them, they are very fine pieces). I won't go into detail about the first visit since they have changed the dining method. On the second visit, my dining partner and I decided on the quince menu with wine pairings (lasted approximately 3.5 hours). We were seated at a corner booth, which allowed us to sit next to each other rather than across. This gave us ample room and provided a more intimate experience - we were able to immerse ourselves in the food adventure that was brilliantly prepared by Michael Tusk. The dishes were amazing as they brought out very interesting flavors. Presentation was delicate but also quite creative. As for the wine pairings, we chose the option of having them poured in mystery glasses. This definitely enhanced our experience as we both tried to correctly guess the region and type of wine. Although a majority of the dishes were exquisite, there were one or two courses that did not stand out with complex flavors. Overall, Quince is relatively expensive compared to other restaurants, but trust me, it is well worth it since it provides the total experience.

My artist bf enjoyed the atmosphere and photography upon arriving, and was even more impressed with the food. \n\nOnce seated, our server showed us the drinks, specifically non-alcoholic for me thinking I was expecting based on a mix up in the reservation notes. She was immediately embarrassed and apologetic. We laughed it off and as the couple at the table next to us pointed out, at least she hadn't commented on my \"pregnant appearance\"! We found the service knowledgeable and warm, not stuffy or pretentious at all. \n\nWe thought the food was delicious with layers of flavor in one bite, artfully presented and portioned well. The amuse-bouches were just the same and whetted our appetite for what was to come. We ordered off the regular tasting menu and had one glass of wine each. The knowledge of the wine was just as impressive as that of the food.\n\nI won't go into too much detail but rather just list off what we each had. We started with the amuse-bouches. They were their bite-size versions of a ceasar salad, chicken wing and clam chowder. There was also a quail egg with a caramelized tuft and a snail. I had the scallop crudo and he had the smoked trout for the first course. Following, there was a wild nettle soup with meyer lemon foam in between courses. For our second courses I had the squab fagotelli and he had the ricotta gnocchi. For the third, I had the suckling pig and he had the cote de boeuf. There was a grapefruit sorbet with grapefruit, espellete pepper and meringue pieces as a palate cleanser before dessert. For dessert, I had the the chocolate dariole and he had the mandarin creme cake. Before the bill, we were given chocolate dipped hazelnuts and about 6 little dessert bites. Everything was incredible and thinking back it's hard to say which dish I enjoyed the most. I don't think you can wrong with anything on the menu. I left feeling quite full, which I didn't necessarily expect. \n\nI would definitely like to go back and maybe even order off the enticing cheese cart. It was worth every penny, but especially great for a special occasion. They even give you a copy of the menu and a special little creme fraiche dessert cake.\n\n For now, we'll plan to go back when I'm actually expecting. :)", "author": "Kelly T."}

I was accompanied by my friend Butters (\"Loo loo loo, I've got some apples...\"). \n\nI had the chefs tasting menu. Butters had the a la carte menu.\n\nFood:   Excellent. \n\nNot in terms of quantity, but in terms of quality.  Any time you're talking about a 6-course meal, you can't expect the portion sizes to be particularly large, unless you intend to have \"Goodyear\" painted on your sides. Quality's the point here, and the food hit it very effectively. The blends of cheeses in the ravioli hit the mark, the spices in the abalone's breading gave it a uniquely delicious flavor, and the octopus, which is usually rubbery when I've had it elsewhere, was relatively tender and flavorful. A lot of thought and effort went into it, and it shows. Butters reported a similar satisfaction with his own choices.\n\nValue: Good.\n\nThis is not a cheap or moderately-priced restaurant, nor does it pretend to be. If you eat here, expect to pay ~$150 per person, and around $70 more if you order the accompanying wine with your meal. It's not the place for someone who's only making the minimum credit card payment. I owe Butters at least 2 dinners after he so generously and graciously treated me to dinner this night.\n\nService: Outstanding. \n\nIn terms of paying attention to the customer, this place gets it. There is no single \"waiter\" for your table. Many staff members float about the dining room (not literally, tragically),  and are also positioned strategically through the establishment. They're not dressed as waiters. They all wear gender-appropriate suits and conduct themselves accordingly. They're available to assist any table which requires it, which means that glasses do not remain empty, dirty dishes are immediately removed, and that nice chap with the various breads comes by frequently, should you want some.\n\nThere's no stuck-up attitude, no impatient or hissy I-hate-my-job waiters, and no staff whose true calling is as a stableboy. Just people who do their job, and do it very well. They're respectful, friendly, helpful, and very attentive. I can think of several other eateries I've patronized which could learn a few lessons from here.\n\nAmbiance: Excellent. \n\nThere's some disagreement among the posters about the dress code here. The deal is this: dressy attire is encouraged. More men are wearing suits or at least suit jackets, than not. It is not the sort of place to go if you've thrown on that shirt you only wear on laundry day.\n\nThat said, you're not going to be turned away or treated badly for wearing denim. I wore nice jeans, with a good button-down shirt and a blazer, and things went just fine. Butters had on jeans and a nice sweater (NOT the circa Bill Cosby sort). If a fellow diner had an issue with our attire, they kept it to themselves. Of course, had someone voiced an objection, I would have thanked them for their input, and then lovingly suggested that they consume their food and accompanying utensils rectally. \n\n(Side note: the point of going out to dinner is to enjoy some good food, with a person (or people) you like. Your food and your friends should be the focus of your experience, not your fellow diners. If you actually care so much about how the other diners are dressed, that you become upset by their choice of clothing, then you probably need an enema.)\n\nThe lighting was soft and sort of intimate, but still ample enough that I could read my menu without trouble. The place was lively, but not so noisy that you had to scream for your dining companions to hear you. The place has decor that's effective, but not distracting.\n\nSo, bottom line:\n\nQuince manages to be a restaurant that's high-class, but not snobbish. You're treated very well, regardless of whether you're wearing a suit or jeans. The food is both creative and delicious. While each individual course is small, the sum of them adds up to satiated hunger and a happy palate. It is expensive; that's a fact.\n\nOf all the restaurants I've reviewed to date, this is the first one that managed to hit it out of the park in terms of service and ambiance. The food was well above average.\n\nButters felt this place deserved 5 stars.\n\nAnd since it hits 4.75 on my scale, I'm going to agree with him.\n\n5 overall.", "author": "Tim B."}

Plus, gotta start documenting all of my Michelin star experiences :D\n\nI came last year on 9/30/2010 for my birthday dinner and had reservations for 8:00pm.  We showed up on time but unfortunately had to wait for almost 30 minutes to be seated.  I don't feel that is quite acceptable for a high class restaurant as such, not to mention there wasn't too much seating for those who were waiting so we ended up stanging for awhile before being seated.  However, onward to the actual dining experience...\n\nWe went with the 5 course tasting menu, and unfortunately I somehow lost the menu that we were given at the end of the meal, so I'm basing my review based on pictures I took (in other words, the names of the dishes will not be as \"cool\" as they sound on the menu, they will be more like \"yummy pork thing\" instead haha)\n\nFirst course:\nA raw scallop dish with the scallops thinly sliced, drizzled in a citrisy sauce.  I'm sorry I can't describe the ingredients better this time but this was tasty but did not blow me away.  The scallops were very very tender and sweet though... very fresh.  So I think it was the sauce that wasn't a home run for me.\n\nSecond course:\nSpaghetti \"Alla Chitarra,\" Mendocino Sea Urchin, Fennel, Hot Pepper\nI'm always a fan of squid ink pasta, and I'm a huge fan of Uni.  However, the uni is usually in the context of sushi, so this was a nice change.  The uni quality was okay, but mixed with the pasta it was a creamy, savory treat to the taste buds.   I definitely enjoyed this dish.\n\nThird course:\nOkay here goes I don't remember the name of the dish, but it was a creamy gnocchi dish with shrimp in some type of meaty reduction... it was wonderful and perfectly cooked (which for me is softer), packed with flavor... mmm... this was probably my favorite.\n\nFourth course:\nA fish bouillabaisse dish with mussels, shrimp, octopus... the broth was wonderful but I was getting pretty full at this point so I wasn't able to enjoy it as much as the other dishes.   Also, I'm not usually a fan of western fish steak type dishes, so I may be biased.  However, for me, this was my least favorite dish although it was still tasty.  \n\nDeserrrrrrrrt:\nChocolate souffle... it was just perfection.  I can't say much more.\n\nWe also did get a scoop of citris sorbet with a tall long candle because it was a birthday celebration, which is always a nice touch :)\n\nAll in all, it was a very pleasant dining experience, and the service was good as well.  The ambience was very modern and chic, and the food was delicious but not BLOW ME AWAY good (still very good though!!!).  The wait was a bit of a drag, but I can look past it and say that I'd come back again :).", "author": "Angela H."}

They renovated not only the room but the menu as well.  The food seems less Italian, but that's not a bad thing: the attention to detail, the methods, the ideas, the execution were all of the very highest order.  Quince is now one of the best restaurants to which I've ever been.  It's hard to change your operation as much as Mike and Lindsay have, and the success of those changes is breathtaking.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-14", "description": "Some of my fine dining foodie friends have raved about this place for years and I finally went last week. Phenomenal pasta and service. 4.75 stars--only reason it's not 5 stars is because I didn't love every single dish.\n\nCost to worth it ratio: 3 stars\n\nHighlights:\n- Environment: at first I was worried it was going to be a bit stuffy, but after the place filled up, it was quite comfortable and enjoyable. It felt like I was at an upscale party in a small room in a house. The place was bustling with activity and friendly people but quiet enough to maintain a private conversation. \n- Food: some dishes were superstars and others forgettable, but on the whole first class. We opted for the tasting menu which is the only way to fully sample the food at a place like this.\n-- Pasta: some of the best I've had (including Italy). The homemade pasta was tender, fillings were divine, and sauces were not make your stomach hurt rich, but oh so tasty. Standout dish of the evening was the cannelloni filled with ultra moist piece of roasted poultry. We added another pasta dish of super small pocket pastas filled with rabbit, veal, and pork topped with a delicate but packed with flavor jus. Both of these dishes deserve gold medals!\n- Squash blossom: airy delight. It was stuffed with fresh ricotta and every so lightly breaded almost tempura style. Heavenly.\n- Rib eye: few slices of super tender meat with just right amount of fat on em--enough to bring out the flavor but not enough to make you go \"ugh fat.\"\n- Amuse: green squash in mousse form with basil. Took us a while to figure out what it was creating that light green color, but it was quite tasty.\n- Bread: interesting combo of lemon pepper sticks and what looked to me like mini baked Chinese bao--one set topped with salts and the other anise. \n- Cheese: nice cart with a hefty selection accompanied by detailed explanations. \n- Last course: the mini desserts. 8-) The chocolate balls were oh so rich but my fave were the items I called mini big macs--I guess that would make them mini macs. The \"buns\" were those airy Italian ameretti cookies and insides had I believe some chocolate.\n- Service: one of the most top rate experiences I have had. At other restaurants I expected it and found it absent. Here it was second only to the food.\n-- Personality: Although due to her apparel and demeanor my first impression of our waitress was a cross between a librarian and a hostess at the haunted house who was oddly opposed to giving us menu suggestions to not taint our decisions, but she turned out to be quite excellent. She warmed up and instead of being stiff and serious as I was fearing , she made little casual comments like \"you got to have bubbly,\" \"everything sounds better in Italian, doesn't it?,\" her warning on not filling up on their fabulous bread, and stories about the chef that set a more at ease, pleasant tone. \n-- Informative: extremely professional and passionate about the food and wine with very detailed information about both--where ingredients were from, what family made a certain product, specifics of how things were prepared, etc. Her descriptions alone added to the excitement of eating the food and had me appreciate it that much more. \n-- Level of service: what you can only dream of at other restaurants. Example: our wine pairing went empty and we didn't have the next glass for a few minutes. She noticed, apologized for the wait, and upgraded our next glass of wine. As for the other wait staff, we always had our waters refilled, the appropriate silverware, and our dishes placed delicately in front of us. They were so good at their job, we barely even noticed they were there.\n- Wines: pairings were spot on. There was a surprise sparkling which made me oh so happy. With my new sparkling addiction, I was a bit bummed to not to see it as part of the tasting menu's wine pairings.\n\nLowlights (my flip side to highlights):\n- Prawn and lobster: one of the dishes I was looking forward to, but a big letdown. The prawn was a not-so-fresh-feeling weird almost hairy texture and the lobster was my least favorite rubbery claw part. Our table agreed it was the disappointment of the night.\n- Halibut: tartare in football form which was off-putting because of its hidden crunch. I'm sure it was just passion fruit seeds or sea salt, but the experience was more akin to egg shells. :-O Soy beans and fruit sauce were great with it, however.\n- Dessert: I wasn't a fan--like an icy panna cotta. To be fair, my friends both really like it and I did like the bits of Italian almond cookie and fresh fruit accessories.\n- Reservations: a bit restricted. Depending on how many people you have, they have certain available times. For 3 we had an option of either 5:30 or 8:30pm. Not a huge deal and I think this spreading out of parties pays off, but just something to note. \n\nThe more I think about my experience here, the more I love it and definitely will be back.", "author": "Eve K."}

It totally causes the \"price/value\" computer in my brain to short circuit.\n\nTo make matters worse, we went to Quince on Valentine's Day. Now who does that? Everyone knows it's absolutely THE SINGLE WORST day to go out to eat. But, alas, one of our best friends was in town, and it was the only night we could do it.\n\nMuch to my dismay, they had a special Valentine's Day menu. Cannot order from the regular menu.This is basically code for \"I will gauge you for every cent you own because I can\". I loath this practice -- at Quince, it was $150 per person worth of loathing.\n\nAll that said, the meal was absolutely sublime. First course was a crudo of scallops with uni, and abalone done Milanese style. The latter something I've never had (and I've eaten a  lot of abalone), and it was delicious. \n\nSecond course, a raviolo stuffed with ricotta and an egg yolk, topped with generous shavings of black truffles. We make it a point of eating as many \"truffle week\" pasta dishes as possible, and I think this could be the single best truffle pasta dish I've ever had in or out of Italy.\n\n3rd course, kobe beef. Again, the best beef dish I've had in a long time. Melt in your mouth delicious beef that is perfectly seasoned with that magnificent crust. Simple sauteed greens, trumpet mushrooms and a potato puree were the perfect complements.\n\nAll of this was accompanied by an incredible Barolo. I read the wine list in advance, and chose a 2001 Giuseppi Mascarello Borolo. Just incredible. At $235, it was (believe it or not) the bargain on a wine list at about 2x mark-up. Naturally, my ambivalence towards Quince extends to the wine list -- absolutely unbelievable selection of the greatest Italian wines, but very very very very healthy mark-up (3x is typical).\n\nDessert was a chocolate semifreddo with a pistachio/basil puree in the shape of kisses. Very nice but did not pass my \"worth the calories\" bar. But then again,  I only respect pastry chefs who can make a proper cake.\n\nThe whole evening was wonderful. The restaurant is gorgeous, the service not just impeccable but friendly. So, to net it out -- if money were no object, by all means, eat at Quince as often as possible!! For the value conscious, just come occasionally, put the calculator away, enjoy a magical evening, and implement austerity measures in the following weeks/months by eating at Cotogna and drinking at Mr. Bings :)", "author": "Judy D."}

They do this with a non intrusive, pleasant attitude (we call it European hospitality)\n\nThe food was an experience in itself. Every bite was a pleasure filled with unbelievable flavor. The amuse bouche was amazing and course after course was one breath taking bite after another. My wife and I were playing the \"guess this ingredient game\" all night and as foodies we were lost after course three and just focused more on enjoying the 9 absolutely delicious courses. It felt more like 13 or 14 courses as they have delicious small bite pallet cleansers that come in between meals.\n\nNow I guess I understand cooking show judges and their use of exotic words to describe dishes being judged :).

These were complemented by nettles and a potato puree.  Beautiful all the way around.\n\nNext, the chef sent out a few casoncelli alla bergamasco, light as air pasta filled with ricotta.

I can see the menu has already changed nearly half their items since I went around a week ago, so maybe I'll have to go back...\n\nI came here for a special occasion, and was pleased to see they had printed special menus for us. The service was amply attentive without being overbearing, and we managed to get through the tasting menu in under 3 hours which is unusual but welcome. We were underdressed in jeans and button down shirts but treated like real people. \n\nHighlights: Loup de mer with green strawberries and almonds. This was the best dish I've ever eaten, and the most perfectly cooked fish you can imagine. After a disappointing fish dish at another 2 star restaurant this was a revelation. A white asparagus with morel mushrooms was also delightful. I ordered a cocktail which came with vaporized flavorants that was just the right degree of absurdity for my liking. There was also a brilliant use of samphire in one of the pasta dishes that made it stand out nearly as much as the excellent fish. \n\nLowlights: I was scared when the first dish, oyster with elderflower and grapefruit, left an overwhelming sourness in my mouth. I've eaten straight citric acid before (don't try this at home) when making cheese and it was not far off from that. Luckily I had a strong drink and the remaining food was much better. There was also a little bug in some of the micro greens on one of the dishes, which doesn't bother me because the greens are from a local garden and I've accidentally eaten much worse (ever find half a snail in your kale?), but it does indicate an error on the part of the kitchen. A suckling pig tortellini was delicious but very monotone, lacking the varied flavor profile of most of the other dishes. \n\nOverall this was an excellent experience, with the exception of the oyster there was no food I wish I hadn't eaten and some very inspired dishes.

It has lost its intimacy, and its charm. The new (well, not so new anymore, but this was my first visit since the move) restaurant is quite elegant, and the division of this much larger space was done quite well. The bar is certainly a welcome addition - no more standing in the entry with glass in hand, keeping one's coat on to ward off the chill from the opening door just behind. But there was something nice about the old Quince location, with its cozy corner banquettes, and the ability to see everything and everyone in the room, and catch your server's eye with no difficulty.\n\nThe service at the new Quince was polished and professional, but felt less personal - partly because of the sheer number of staff now, with so many unfamiliar faces. Gone too are the beige jackets, which it's true would not have worked so well in this new space.\n\nAnd the food? That, happily, is as wonderful as ever. We both had seafood starters - scallops for CM, shrimp for me - and these were both excellent. Her pasta was the trofie della casa, with dungeness crab and red pepper, while I had chestnut tagliatelle, served with squab and balsamic vinegar. Strangely (?) in a restaurant known for its pasta more than anything else, I was unmoved by either. Mind you, they were very, very good, but not the expected highlight of the meal. For me, that was probably the rabbit main course I had, although CM's sweetbreads were exquisite as well. Wine pairings with each course were handled with aplomb, and each was spot-on. Forgive my lack of details in all of this, but I didn't take notes, and it's been over a week. Trust me - Quince is one of the very best restaurants in the entire Bay Area.

However we had to wait more than an hour for our table which then ended up being 9:30. By this time everyone had lost their appetites and just wanted to go home. We had made a reservation more than a month in advance so it wasn't like we were a walk-in. The host didn't even approach us or offer a drink until an hour had gone by. We asked about our table about every 20 minutes with the same response, \"we will be setting the table momentarily\".\nSuch a let down for a place with such promise. This is an example of how service and management can trump even the best food.", "author": "Kelton D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-12-09", "description": "As soon as I walked in, I stopped in my tracks, sniffed around like a demented dog, and told everyone that I thought it smelled like wet towel. It totally did, and I think it partly came from both the air conditioning vent and the cheese. People seriously need to cover their cheese. My (Asian) friend noticed it too, but no one else did, so we chalked it up to being an Asian thing. Whatever, though, Quince totally smells. \n\nThe service was attentive and overbearing, yet slow... the worst kind. It was dragged on like a local Caltrain making all the stops and even stopping to run someone over on the tracks. In eating this meal, I could have gone from San Jose to San Francisco more than twice, and there were only five courses. I've had thirteen course meals plus drinks that have taken less time to be served. Five grown men wearing suits would march out with all the dishes in unison long after you were done with your previous dish. There was no graceful, timed arabesque in taking up your dish exactly thirty seconds after you were done, but you felt like you were always being watched.\n\nThe waiter kept telling us that things were \"beautiful\" and \"gorgeous.\" I mean, seriously, how presumptuous can you get? I have eyes and can tell whether something is pretty or not, and let me tell you, sometimes things were not so pretty. He also kept jumping into our conversation while serving us, which is pretty much the most annoying thing a waiter can do. It got so bad that I almost wanted to suspend the conversation each time he approached the table.\n\nChanterelle mushroom soup, an amuse-bouche - I started eating this with a spoon but ended up drinking it from the shot glass. We were talking about how we should drink this, and my friend is all \"I don't know, whenever I see I shot glass, I only know how to do one thing.\" This soup was done well, though, because it wasn't too creamy and had decently good flavor.\n\nMonterey bay abalone - quail egg, porcini mushroom and garlic - This was my favorite dish of the evening. The abalone was rubbery and deep fried, but it went well with the garlic sauce, the wetness from the egg's consistency, and the earthy flavor of the mushroom. Quail eggs are so cute! They look like little jiggly eyeballs pleading for life.\n\nTorchon of foie gras - mostarda d'uva, hazelnut and pan brioche - The foie gras plus mostarda d'uva on the brioche tasted like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The hazelnut salad clump was also uninspired, dry, and the hazelnuts tasted like they were in a plastic bag for way too long. Disappointing, and I'm sorry that a duck had to get stuffed for this.\n\nTriangoli of pheasant - black trumpet mushroom and black cabbage - The waiter was all \"this is beautiful,\" but I thought it looked like plain ravioli. It was definitely not unpleasant looking, but it also won't be winning any beauty pageants any time soon. The pheasant was way too salty, but the broth was quite good. The vegetables were a bit slimy, but they weren't offensive or anything because I liked the crunchiness of the black trumpet mushroom juxtaposed against the mushiness of the black cabbage.\n\nPoularde - martin's ruby crescent potato, lacinato kale and guanciale - Ok so supposedly two of my friends said that they ate venison and potatoes like every day when they were children. It must be a European thing that I don't quite understand. Everything about this dish was mediocre: the meat tasted like iron, the chunk of potato was flavorless, but the quince was an interesting addition.\n\nBuckwheat crespelle with huckleberry ice cream - caramel and sage brown butter - I think this dish is meant to look like a plate of meat because the buckwheat crepe looked like some sort of roast beef and the huckleberry ice cream looked like some sort of rare inside-out steak drizzled with blood. It was quite good, though. \n\nAll in all, I paid $140 for a meal that I think is worth about $60. We had to deal with an overbearing waiter, slow service, a mediocre meal, smelly cheese, and a restaurant that was trying way too hard.", "author": "June L."}

Most of the dishes were exceptional. The service was attentive, and not at all stuffy or cold. Our waiter flashed a good sense of humor from the beginning, and comped us an after-dinner digestif when we gave him some small excuse to do so.\n\nI was particularly impressed with the way the staff worked cohesively. There were some large parties seated near us, and our primary waiter was sometimes tied up with them when our courses emerged from the kitchen. So other waiters sometimes brought out the dishes. They were just as knowledgeable and willing to chat as our regular guy. I was glad to receive each plate in perfect condition and at the right temperature fresh out of the kitchen.\n\nFour rather than five stars for one reason: Call me petty, but when I'm paying $30+ for a glass of wine, I expect the portion to be reasonably generous -- five ounces, or thereabouts. I didn't bring a measuring tool, and I know that the shape of the glass can make it difficult to estimate the volume, but one of my pours (done free-hand by the sommelier) was very much on the scant side. \n\nBut overall, a great experience in a beautiful setting.", "author": "Mark H."}

Well I'm actually just bored and waiting for my porn download to finish.  I don't do much  fine dining, since I usually don't have time to sit around for 3 hours.  When I do go though, it's going to be with good friends/family, or maybe that special person, lol.\n\nThis establishment was recommended to me by a friend who frequents these fine dining establishments.  I was also intrigued by the good reviews on Yelp, so I made my decision to participate in mastication at this restaurant.  I guess I came in with high expectations which were not met. \n\nAlrighty then, where shall we start?  The setting of the restaurant is very elegant and comfortable.  It is actually very spacious compared to other restaurants of this \"calibre.\"  The service here is immaculate.  The waiter was honest and very attentive to our needs.  My water was always filled and they made sure I was well intoxicated, haha.  Onward HO! onto the food.....\n\nI opted for the 4 course and started off with the Maine Lobster  with vellutata\nparsnip and chestnut confit.  Albeit it is a very interesting dish, it did not satisfy.  It reminded me of my mother's minced shrimp paste stuffed in tofu or eggplant.  I could've easily mistaken the lobster as shrimp.  The flavor in the broth was rich and buttery which made this \"shrimpy\" course only acceptable.\n\nNext on the menu was the \"Doppio Raviolo.\"  It's basically a wonton with chanterelle mushroom and pumpkin with burrata cheese.  The pumpkin's sweetness really overpowers it at first, then the saltiness of the cheese leaves a very uncommon salty aftertaste.  The mushroom sauce is delicious but does not accomodate the \"raviolo.\"  This course was easily passable.\n\nMy protein dish was served next: the Watson Farm Lamb.  This was the only appeasing dish out of the main courses.  The lamb was flavorful and not to \"game-y.\"  The artichokes reminded me more of eggplants although they are very similar in texture.  The vegetables were very well done.  This by far was my favorite dish.\n\nFinally the dessert: the Vanilla Marshmallow,  a toasted marshmallow served with warm chocolate, almond and caramel ice cream.  I don't eat much sweets but I did enjoy this.  When it was served it looked like a fried tofu.  Everything was very smooth and not too sweet (perfect for me).\n\nTwo out of four was not worth it for me (I didn't even want to count dessert).  Maybe if I selected different courses?  I shall not know.  I had an excellent time though since I was with good company.  Service and ambiance is 5 stars.  Food is 2.5 stars.  Son, I am dissapoint.", "author": "Ricky H."}

The deal was that fussy, food-restrictive me had to try everything.  And I think we really did order just about everything.\n\nFirst up, the atmosphere.  Finally, a place in San Francisco where people are dressed up across the board!  Ladies in dresses and skirts, men in jackets and ties... Classy!  I'm as casual as can be, but how nice is it to get fancied up for a wonderful me?  Very!\n\nThe atmosphere is serious and sexy, quite luxurious.  The waitstaff was attentive, patient and knowledgeable.\n\nThe amuse bouche plate was fun and whimsical. the soup, the cauliflower thing, the tiny bites - cute and yummy.\n\nThe bread was delicious and I fell in love with the flatbread cheese thing (the guys thought it was too salty, so I ate theirs too!) and the two butters... Oh, those butters... so good!  Sadly, when we got our butter refill, it was nearly frozen (unlike the first plate of butter, which was perfect temperature).\n\nWe started with tuna and sea urchin (nice, interesting and fresh-tasting), asparagus (not enough pancetta with it, but delightful egg!) and octopus (I didn't like it at all... it tasted overwhelmingly fishy, in a not good way).\n\nNext up: lobster ravioli.  DIVINE!\n\nAfter that, pasta with honey and cheese and chili (best best best dish, we all agreed - sooooo good, yum!!!!) and spring lamb pasta (a close second, AMAZING, it was art!!!).\n\nNext up - squab... poor little pigeon.  It was good, but not so good that I wanted to keep eating it.  I enjoyed the beef dish but the guys found it dry.  The pig mix roast was interesting - parts of it were delicious, other parts excited me less.\n\nFor dessert we shared the baked honey thing (I don't remember what it was called).  There was nothing exciting or memorable about it.  What was amazing was the chees tray.  I love cheese.  Love love love.  And the selections were divine.  we chose four cheeses and each was excellent.\n\nWe paired cocktails, white wine and red wine with the courses.  The somelier was fun and smart.\n\nIt was a divine experience... so much more than a meal, really.  I understand the Michelin Star... they deserve it!

And I don't even want to brag about the places I've been to...\n\nI went with my aunt and sister and we ordered a la carte, despite being heavily tempted by the tasting menu.  But after reading the reviews, we decided to go with sampling off each others' plates.\n\nEvery dish we ordered was perfect.  From the portion size, the plating, the execution, everything was just ... thoughtful.  Maybe we were just really good at ordering though.  I tend to know what I like and am pretty knowledgeable about pastas having worked in an upscale Italian kitchen once upon a time.\n\nI ate here about 2 months ago and without looking at the menu I can remember exactly what we had because everything was so good.  The 3 of us split two appetizers, one was the sweetbreads and the other was the lobster.  The lobster had a sweet emulsion sauce over it, and while I really don't care for cold lobster, was absolutely succulent and had just the right amount of sweetness.  The sweetbread was so tender and moist, we never wanted to stop eating it.  \n\nFor the pasta, we split the agnolotti with sunchoke puree and the cavatelli.  I was a huge fan of the agnolotti, everything was so soft a billowy and the sunchokes were really pronounced and creamy.  My aunt loved the cavatelli.\n\nFor our main courses, I got the hare, which was presented in several ways.  The meat was sooo tender.  One of the ways it was served was it was wrapped in lardo and deep fried.  That was to die for.  I also loved the presentation and the small rack of hare rib in the center.  My sister got the lamb, which was also presented in several ways, some of it was sliced for her, and it was so much she couldn't finish it, but I gladly helped.  My aunt got the duck, which was the simplest of the three and served with farro, and i LOVE farro (well, almost any grains).  Though simple, it was cooked with a lot of care, and the skin was so crispy and it was just hte most succulent piece of meat I've ever had.  \n\nLast but not least ... the desserts.  Oh my god.  Don't be fooled by how conventional sounding the desserts are.  That lemon tart nearly put me to tears it was so perfectly balanced with tart and sweet.  And it is just so simple and elegant I felt like I didn't know anything about well made desserts when I had them.  I had a pear crostata with burnt honey ice cream on top.  It was just .. SO good.  \n\nThis is definitely a place worth splurging on again, and again.", "author": "Biqi C."}

Fabulous food with the Agnolotti Dal Plin -- a signature pasta dish -- as a highlight.  It felt like we had 12 natty waiters serving us the entrees in a synchronized delivery -- looked practically operatic.  Private room in corner of the restaurant has semi-shear curtain that allows you to feel connected to the main dining room.\n\nDinner tonight was memorable again.  Started with the crab souffle which had a nice firmness -- not too eggy, not to cakey.  For my entree, I had to resist ordering the Agnolotti again, so I had a tender duck with lentils -- cooked a perfect medium rare.  Fortunately, my friend ordered the Agnolotti so I was able to scarf down a few of the tasty dumplings.  For dessert tried a nice trio of cheeses, one particular soft one was so gamey I felt like I might bleat on the spot when I ate a piece straight up.  It was very good once I combined it with the rye bread and fig.  I also enjoyed the Meyer lemon tart, (I love Meyer lemons) which was delicate with a light meringue on top.  So light, in fact, that I felt I wanted another dessert and ordered the Pink Lady Apple Crostata with burnt honey ice cream.  Much sweeter than the lemon tart, but not cloying.\n\nI'm not a wine expert, but the Sommelier recommended two whites by the glass, a Spanish and an Italian based on our request for something crisp that would complement our food choices.  Both stood up well, even to the duck.\n\nI did have to drop a star, though, because my water glass sat empty for about 10 minutes while I looked around to catch someone's eye for a refill.  Also, the women's bathroom had some sort of overflow situation that caused them to close the women's bathroom.  It flooded the rug area all the way to the men's bathroom.

This is among the lighter of the pastas mentioned above, but in my opinion, equally as satisfying.\n\n5. Beef Rib: Boy do they know how to cook this.

Well, it started off with me finding it in some dude's \"take your date here if you want to get laid\" list. A couple of reviews and visuals later, it was reservation time.\n\nFriday night, and 10 minutes after our due arrival time, we finally arrive and were seated immediately. Menus were handed out, water was  offered, and drinks were explained. We decided on the a la carte menu and I went for: \n\n\"heirloom beets\"\nricotta salata cheese, poppy seed and olio verde\n\n\"tortelli di zucca\"\nmarina di chioggia squash and amaretti cookie\n\nand this sea bass dish with mandarin oranges \n\nI loved it all, except for the sea bass; it was fishy (as in good/fresh fish shouldn't remind me of the beach), and it came with an unexpected surprise (and not the good kind): the mushy-orange-tongue-looking object that garnished my fish was a not-so-wanted sea urchin.  I was once told that that stuff is pretty foul-- and I must concur.  I was also told that uni is to be slurped-- like a quail egg shot-- and not chewed; I guess that's where I went wrong, oh well.\n\nEverything else made up for the marginal fish, especially the tortelli. It was one melting pot of goodness; all the flavors complemented one another. And get this-- the food was served on a sliver platter! And the butter on a piece of marble! Seriously! Lastly, the staff does this weird waggle dance before serving your food; there were times when the dance was omitted and the food came straight to you. I was perplexed by the whole performance, but that's what made it the more fun.\n\nWould I come back? Most def, even if it dents wallets! Why? After all, it did prompt me to write my first review.", "author": "Tammy T."}

From the first greeting to the final goodbye, Quince made me leave wanting more. We began with a beautiful rose champagne which paired impeccably with the amouse bouche of salmon tartar, tomato and ricotta, and bite of fish. We moved onto appetizers with an wonderful white to enjoy the prawns with bright corn and tomato \"salsa\" and delicate squash blossoms. Everything was coming together perfectly.\n\nSince Quince is very well know for their pastas we ordered three to share. I could have ordered another round. The cappellacci was probably the best pasta I have ever tasted. The sweet corn melted in my mouth and the sauce was truly heavenly. My main course of sea bass will top my list of fish dishes at any restaurant. It flaked away perfectly and was paired with tender potatoes and great morels. \n\nEvery dish at this restaurant bested the one before. And the desserts and dessert wines did not disappoint. It was one of the best and most amazing meals I have ever had. Everything came together with the feeling of a seasoned restaurant with an awesome staff.

Comparatively, all three restaurants are very similar: well-executed and creative dining without reaching the upper price echelon of the Michael Minas and Gary Dankos of the city. \n\nOther than that, Quince blows the other two away, which is saying something given the acclaim they have both received. The service was impeccable, from the multiple servers to the bread selection to the helpful advice when navigating their tome of a wine menu.\n\nEvery dish was a highlight. My roommate and I both ordered the scallop appetizer, and the fish was wonderfully rich and perfectly cooked. I loved the carrot puree that was served with it, in particular. The beignets with espresso-cardamom gelato and chocolate dipping sauce were an indulgent and delicious bookend to the meal. \n\nMy heart, though, has been stolen by their timballo di maccheroni with spring lamb ragout. Topped with wild nettle and ample shavings of pecorino di fossa, it looked like a little pasta castle. I trojan horsed my way through the pasta to the tasty lamb inside and I was not let down in the slightest. \n\nIt's both a shame and a delight that they change their menus often. Dismayed that I may not be able to order a pasta castle again, but enthused to try something else equally divine. Simply amazing.", "author": "Devon S."}

But when you are geared for a special occasion, that fits.\n\nThis particular night they had 2 tasting menu options so we did one of each.  One was a seafood themed, and the other meat, but the menu is really designed around the incredible pastas they make.\n\nThere were 2 dishes we had that I will probably remember for years.  A gnocchi prepared with lobster & lobster mushrooms is now my personal standard for gnocchi.  I can honestly say it was the best preparation I have ever had.  I could have bathed in the sauce and been happy.  The other was a tortelloni stuffed with burrata and surrounded with tomatoes.  Really, really fantastic. \n\nThe main courses were absolutely fantastic.  The only problem was that we were completely stuffed at that point.  Their preparation of Dover Sole was heart-breaking.  Heart-breaking in that I couldn't finish it.  The squab with caramelized quince was delicious as well, but again, I felt like I was committing a sin sending the plates back without finishing them.  Believe me, it was not from lack of effort.\n\nAs you would expect from a place in this price range, the service was stellar.  Attentive without being over-bearing.  The wine choices they helped with were great as well.\n\nDessert?  Who knows, I literally was asking if they had a wheel barrel to get me out of there in before it even came.\n\nThe only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the fish tasting menu was overall much better than the \"meat\" tasting.  If we had both ordered the meat, the meal would have been good, but not stellar.  Having the option to hog my portions of the fish tasting made the meal fantastic.  \n\nHighly recommended.  But it's not cheap, so expect a pricey bill.  I would definitely go back.", "author": "Andrew M."}

Line it up with Cyrus, Benu or French Laundry for instance and it comes in a bit below those in my opinion. But hello, that still means it is AMAZING.  Ok so that caveat out of the way....   lovely lovely meal.  I won't run down the menu because other yelpers have, and it changes often.  I will comment on a couple things I thought were special.  \n\nFirst, I had the 4 course, my friend had the 10 tasting course. I was surprised that they offer that, I usually see that the whole table has to do the tasting menu.  But what I loved was that the chef kept sending out small extra courses for me so I had something while he had his 10 courses.  All were good, one of them was awesome:  they have their own bee hives on the roof, and made this absolutely stunning filled \"pasta\" with a light honey sauce under them.  Really wow, I've never had a \"sauce\" like that.  \n\nOk I said I wasn't going to mention the dishes, but the squash blossom salad was also wonderful, great textures and flavors.\n\nI guess it gets a four because I thought the amuse bouche and the duck course were lackluster (yes I have had meals where EVERY course was good, I'm spoiled).  And the music was a bit much.  Super speedy jazz and a tad too loud.\n\nThe bar/lounge was comfortable, surprisingly unpretentious. About 10 seats at the bar, and about 5 nice couches/chairs in a lovely lounge by the windows.  Very friendly staff at the bar and throughout the whole restaurant.  Felt very welcome and taken care of.  Decor is gorgeous.  Great choice for a date, anniversary or special work dinner.\n\nI think my 4 course was about $90, and maybe $65 or so for the wine pairing.  Valet parking and lots of street parking.  Allow about 3 hours if you have the tasting menu.  I wanna go back now after writing this!  \n\nOh, and their sister restaurant Cotogna is great too!", "author": "C M."}

Isn't it wonderful how selfish Yelp can be? As to the basics, yes, against my best of intentions going in, I had the wine pairing and yes, each wine was fantastic with each new plate - but yeah, I'm not a wine snob, I drink enough to know good wine and bad wine and its ability to light up food. I also did not intend to try the chef's tasting menu, but yes, you see what happened with the wine pairing. Oh where to go? The service? The ambiance? The exceptional refinement of the delicious food? Oh, no. Not that. Again. There comes a point in fine dining where very rarely does the food jolt your consciousness. No, the jolt did not come here, but when you find food and service and an experience without a flaw, you luxuriate in it, you don't think about it, destroy it with analysis. Quince was a great meal in a great space with great service. If I had to rank Quince within SF city limits, the service is scarier (in the best way) at Gary Danko and the food is more brilliant at Benu - but you won't go without here because the food is better than Gary Danko and the ambiance is more luxuriant than Benu.\n\nThe Meal, more or less cut & pasted from the menu: royal osetra caviar - brioche, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and flowering herbs; wild turbot - brussels sprout, chestnut and black truffle; \"bacon and eggs\" - lardo, fontina val d'aosta and little farm egg yolk; \"fagotelli\" - langoustine, cauliflower and lobster mushroom; \"casoncelli\" - scottish pheasant, walnut and rye; four story hill farm veal sweetbread - porcini mushroom, thumbelina carrot and sauce albufera; paine farm squab - red kuri squash, black garlic and pomegranate; chocolate cremeux - caramel jam, sesame croccante and yogurt sherbert; mignardise.\n\nI spent a lot of money this evening, but I regret nothing.", "author": "Brski B."}

What started out as a couple making heartfelt pastas that sang with soul and emotion is now just a glorified Michelin ** star restaurant out for the bucks.  We went there on a date about a week ago and did the Spring tasting menu (just 3 choices) at $130 for 5 courses.  The first real course of tomatoes seem out of place as the presentation is so commonplace nowadays that the tomatoes had better blow you away...they were fine but not worthy of being the star ingredient by any measure.  The pasta course with tribute to some Chinese lady was weird.  I Google her and she is famous for Chinese food but unless her great great great great grandfather was Marco Polo...I didn't get the influence.  And with a little caviar...a $30 supplement.  The other pasta dish was a linguini sized pasta called Oro.  If was paired with Honeydew melon...did my kid end up in the kitchen tonight?  The combination was simply weird as the chewy al dente noodles competed with broken flesh of the fruit and made this one of the worst combo's ever. Worst yet was the main course of cod or beef...We hadn't noticed but the beef which was one of two courses was another $30 supplement...that is just outrageous when there was no luxury ingredient involved...it was not some A5 grade Japanese cut so why the big surcharge?  The beef was not able to be identified as dry-aged for 38 days as their was no detectable umami in flavor or texture. Now the price fixe price is not $130 but $190 for 5 courses and that is a ripoff at $38 per course.  With wine, cocktails, tax and tip...~$850 out the door.  I used to adore the original place off Bush but now it is just a obvious attempt to milk customers who want a Michelin ** experience.  Now it might as well be another wannabe place I could care less about.  This place again tells me that we are at a top in show and less in go times and I'm truly worried about the state of our culinary consciousness.  I'm saddened by such obvious sell outs.

The bartender was friendly enough but really lacked distinct personality.  I kind of got the feeling that she was just tolerating my being there since I didn't drink.\n\nWe were seated at our reservation time and greeted by our server.  I always put it out there that Italian cuisine is something quite foreign to me as I am just learning about the delicate nuances that this style possesses.  The server, I liked, a lot, she was friendly and spoke to me as if I knew I was talking about.  One of my biggest pet peeves of services is when people talk down to you, which I have experienced multiple times at Michelin restaurants.  I had her recommend courses to me and she helped me \"build flavors, that would make sense for a complete experience.\"  I loved her verbage, she was the epitome of class and professionalism. \n\nThe support staff was plentiful, almost too plentiful (they actually ran into each other once and knocked over a bottle of wine...I laughed)...There is a lot of staff here, whizzing by, not hurried, but definitely with purpose.  I counted eight different people clearing plates, serving bread, bringing water etc.  The one shining star of the support staff was the backwaiter/food runner.  He was charming and funny.  He seemed passionate about the restaurant and absolutely proud to be there.  I think he said his name was Matthew.  \n\nThe food was very good..Not quite excellent in my opinion, but very good none the less.  I started with the foie gras terrine which was excellent, I love foie gras so that is always great when it doesn't disappoint me.  They sent me a complementary course, which of course, is always welcome.  It was the best thing I had....It was two michelin stars good.  It was rich and powerful, aromatically intoxicating and completely memorable.  I could have eaten that for the entire meal, I really could have.  The beef I had was tender, but wasn't a show-stopper.  It was prepared correctly, but after eating Kobe Beef at French Laundry, I guess my perception is a little skewed.  \n\nOverall, I think 4 stars would suit my experience.

The servers all described the dishes as they were presented.\n\nI ordered the gnocchi (uber fresh peas), monkfish (meyer lemon sauce & pastry - yum!) & souffle dessert (can never resist a souffle).  I didn't consider anything tiny - in fact the monkfish was quite substantial - I was a little past full after 3 courses - wish I shared a course.  The tea service was very cute & flavorful - okay the teapot & cup were small but hot water is plentiful.  $135 for 2 people is much cheaper than GD.\n\nI love Gary Danko - my fav restaurant - but didn't have equal expectations of Quince.", "author": "Kim S."}

However, no such worries at Quince where the food was out of this world (would highly recommend the duck) and service was exceptional.  And this is coming from a guy that doesn't just throw around the word exceptional!\n\nLike another reviewer, I am also somewhat skeptical of the line other similar restaurants draw between \"stuffy\" and \"nice\".  Much, of course, is dependent upon the personalities of the individuals working at a restaurant who should adapt accordingly between the \"more uppity types\" and those that just want a nice meal in a nice place.  Quince is not stuffy at all. \n\nIt is a great restaurant, that delivers on its reputation by serving, what is possibly, the best food of it's kind that SF has to offer.  It does so in a really refined venue, with an easy-going manner.\n\nI would 100% recommend Quince to anyone that wants to celebrate a special occasion or simply to anyone that enjoys truly great food.", "author": "Steve O."}

I had just passed my Court of Master Sommelier's level 2 certified exam, and it was also the weekend before my birthday.\n\nMy husband worked with a friend from a wine shop on the menu and wine selection for several weeks and was pretty proud of what they had come up with for food & wine pairings.\n\nUnfortunately, although my husband emailed the correct menu choices (we checked the email), there was a disconnect between the woman communicating our preferences to the chef (hey everyone's human). We found this out only when I looked at the special menus printed up for our party.\n\nThe first woman I spoke with was a little hostile I have to say. I was not happy at all. She very snootily told me that it was too late and there was really nothing the chef could do about it now.\n\nThe owner of the restaurant Lindsay, however, made a beautiful recovery.  The chef WAS able to change the sauce so that the first course would still go well with the selected wine, and everything else was exemplary. The service couldn't have been nicer, the food better, or the overall experience any more favorably memorable.\n\nLindsay was kind enough to pick up a portion of the sizable check and smooth my husband's ruffled feathers.\n\nOverall for something that could have left a bad taste in our mouths literally and figuratively, we ended up enjoying our party immensely and would definitely recommend this restaurant to our closest friends.", "author": "Nora L."}

They have martini glasses full of potato chips to snack on while you sip your cocktail which was a delightful way to dilute my concerns about their pretentiousness. \n\nWe shared the Lamb Ragu pasta and it deserves 4 out of 5 stars. The pasta itself was great, the sauce was good, but the lamb was almost cured (bacon-like texture) rather than the traditional slow-cooked, fall-apart texture, not a good thing.\n\nFor dessert we shared a fig tart with burnt honey ice cream. It was excellent.\n\nThey then brought (free) a final course of sweets; sugared almonds, pear gelee, and fig spongecake, served with house-farmed honey (farmed on the roof of the building). This was a phenomenal end to the meal.\n\nI drank a $17 glass of Chianti which was very good, but I would have prefered a less expensive option for a red Italian wine. Nevertheless, don't go to Quince if you are planning to pinch pennies (or dollars).\n\nThe most important thing to note about the experience is the immaculate service. It is choereographed like a precisely timed dance. All staff is in dark suit and tie and they arrive and disappear unobtrusively, and exactly before realize you need them.\n\nLastly, the restaurant is tastefully appointed and perfectly lit. The choices of art were a little dubious; large blown up photographs all lacking a subject, but not at all abstract. The main piece is just a photo of a grand room in the Louvre with a lot of tourists lounging and looking at the paintings. It's a completely unoriginal and thoughtless photograph and I'm not sure why anyone would ever select it as a piece to hang, much less as a focal piece in a restaurant with such obvious attention to detail. Nevertheless, it in no way negates the fantastic dining experience. \n\nBravo to Quince!", "author": "David S."}

The menu was limited and half of the selections in each section required pretty high up charges for a 4 course menu that was already $100 per person.  Even the cheese plate option for dessert cost an extra $16 and they would not let me substitute an app for dessert which sucks since I try not to eat sugar!!!  The risotto was $15 per person up charge and we were both required to order the dish if we wanted it.   There was only 1 thing in the 8 options we had between the two of us that was unbelievably delicious (the scallop app).  Typically, in places of this caliber, we savor every bite of every dish, but this was not the case here.  \n\nThe up charges and restrictions totally ruined the place for me.  I will not be returning and I hate to say it but I'm feeling pretty ripped off.  \n\nIf you want to pay $400 to $600 per couple and get your money's worth go to Gary Danko's, Fleur De Lys or Boulevard.

Quince is located on a quiet block with a very non nondescript entrance.  The scene inside is hushed, California modern elegant and on the dark side (low lights).   The food was very inventive and the service was impeccable.  Every time I took a sip of water, the woman manning our table came by to keep my glass full.  She admitted she has an obsession with keeping water glasses full.  Overall a very good experience.  Pricey, so reserve Quince for a special occasion or an expense account meal.

My problem is that I wasn't blown away and, for me, I kind of expect that when I spend as much as Quince requires.  \n\nThe things that really stood out:  a delicious flageolet bean soup, the lobster pasta enjoyed by my partner in crime, and an unforgettable crespelle dessert that I would eat every day if I could.  \n\nMy main dish (a mushroom/zucchini pasta) was fine but not super memorable and the other dessert we ordered (a chocolate hazelnut torta) was kind of chunky and pasty - the direct quote from the partner was \"this is kind of rough and rugged.\"  As someone who would basically eat chocolate and hazelnut smeared on cardboard, I was disappointed that Quince's treatment of it wasn't out of this world.\n\nOne other odd thing is that we ordered a bottle of wine to go with dinner and, at some point, the waiter just kind of abandoned our table and stopped pouring it.  We would have just poured it ourselves had we had access but, since it was off on a side table, we were sort of stranded.  We gave up hope that we'd finish it with dinner and, after ordering dessert, we finally resorted to just asking if we could have the last glass that was left in the bottle.  Our waiter was totally nice about it, and apologized, but it just left the impression that we were sort of unimportant in the larger scheme of Quince customers.\n\nAnd, truth is, we probably were - we didn't order the big tasting menu.  We ordered smaller plates and not a ton of them, and only one bottle of wine which, at $80, was one of the cheaper ones on the menu.  For me, on my budget, it was an unusual, special occasion and maybe that was too obvious to the staff.  In any case, my guess is that Quince is probably great if you can afford to really do it up, but I left feeling a little underwhelmed.", "author": "Stacey M."}

Dimly lit, quiet, staff dressed in black and grey, and most of the guests wore black (except me, in a white dress, asking myself if I missed something about attire on the website).\n\nWe came not well very prepared - we shouldn't have stuffed ourselves with raw clams and oyster and wines and beers during lunch time, we shouldn't have hiked across San Francisco in the afternoon, or eaten that that scoop of chocolate milk passion fruit ice cream from Humphry Slocombe, we shouldn't have gone through that boring hot stone massage -  all led up to us arriving at Quince feeling hurried, stuffed, hungover, tired and bored.  My apologies, Quince, you and your particular awesome waitress deserve better.\n\nService:  5 stars -  in general, all the wait staff are good.  The young male ones look like supermodels moonlighting as waiters, some with genuine smiles, some looked a bit stuffy but gave out pleasant feelings nonetheless.  The superstar of them all is our waitress -  she was the girl next door warm in a skirt suit, she was attentive, tried to make us most comfortable, pleasantly conversed without stepping in our space, friendly and casual - in its best way under the formal fa\u00e7ade.  She knows her job well, and knows the human psychology as much.  With the hangover, I decided that no more wine for me, and my husband does not drink alcohol, so she offered us non-alcoholic cocktails - they came out surprisingly good, refreshing and definitely helped my headache.  I felt pampered - something I'd expect from a spa, not a restaurant, so 5 stars for our waitress!\n\nFoods:  all the dishes are perfect, well-balanced, artfully presented, I get it, this is fine dining.  But they were also ... boring!  I'm sorry for writing this, but we came to eat, we expect bigger portion, something that gives more pleasures.  Instead, it was 10 very short lullabies.  Each course was about two tiny bites, not enough to fully appreciate. Before I was able to understand the food, the food had gone, down to the dark pit being my stomach, faster than information being transferred from the nerves endings of my tongue to my brain.  This was the conversation in my head: Wait, what was that? Was it good? Yes, I think so.  In what way was it good?  Sorry, I'm not sure, need another bite but there's nothing left.  (The only dish that has quite a decent mass was the gnudi, with that suckling pig popped out its flavorful flavor inside my mouth and sent a strong enough signal to my brain.  That was also my most favorite course of the meal.). And the process repeated again and again, and by the course before the last, I practically begged in my head for it to stop. \n\nAfter that very long meal,  we cleansed our palate with some sorbet and mousse - surprisingly good, to wake us up.  Next to a chocolate overdose!  I'm no longer a chocolate person -  and the chocolate cake with the chocolate something was good (so many details were forgotten about this meal) but there was an effort on my part to finish the chocolate desserts.  Move on to the dessert cart - best ever, so good that the macaroon, left outside in a to go box after two days, was still amazingly good.  This coupled with the sorbet, they must have a real genius as their pastry chef.\n\nSo all in all, they have a smart angel in their waitstaff, and I'll hog more from the dessert cart next time!

After reading several reviews and after hearing great things about this place I thought it was worth to give a try, at the end of the end, the truth is that most of people in San Francisco have been here at least once. When I go out to eat with my friends we usually try different places and since this time I was supposed to select the restaurant I thought of Quince.  \nI left the restaurant with the impression that this restaurant is barely average, nothing but overrated, if it wasn't because they have been in business for so many years I could even say that the restaurant it's a fad restaurant (similar to Straits Cafe in Palo Alto).  Service was good, the waiter, a tall gentleman in his forties was attentive and he knew the menu very well from the first item on the menu to the very last one.   The restaurant decoration is very nice, ideal for a date or maybe a business meeting. However, the food is not even close to what I expected.  It did not match the service or the atmosphere at all.    \nFirst, we got our wine.  The wine selection was excellent and we decided to take the waiter's recommendations.  He chose an excellent Pinot Noir, a very light and delicate one with cherries, oak and earth.  After that we got several cheeses, they were not bad either, the waiter said the selection of cheeses were from local farms.  The main courses were a big disappointment; our pasta with truffles was nothing to rave or to rant especially because the truffles were melted at the time the dish got to our table.  The Duck was overcooked and nearly tasteless. For dessert we had the Apple Gratin and this one was likely the best dish we had during our dinner.  I really can't think of another restaurant that has a dessert as good as this one.  \nAnyway, it was not a bad experience, but it was still far from what I expected from a place with such a reputation.

We both are vegetarian, so we did a tasting with a wine pairing.  The nice thing is that biding the main course, there were 2 vegetarian options for both of us so we were able to try more.  They were able to make us a soup vegetarian which was great.  I love beets, so one of the starters included beets and we devoured them.  The second course included the triangoli (disclaimer: both of us are suckers for truffles, so this had no way of being anything but delicious) and the cappellini.  Our main course was great too.  And even though we were served the same dish, they made it a point to pour us different wines for the pairing.  There was also a croissant like bread that was DELICIOUS - no need for extra butter, and they were right.  Lastly, dessert was great.  You can't go wrong choosing chocolate and cheese.  My friend and I hadn't gotten a chance to catch up in a long while, so we were chatting away and definitely the last two at the restaurant.

We arrived on time and our table was not ready. We went to the bar to wait and were ignored by the frantic bar staff (there is like 5 bar tenders). They did not look up, did not acknowledge us, did not even look our way for about 4-5 minutes. When one of the bar tenders finally asked for our order he was somewhat rude or maybe he was over worked or maybe he just lacked personality, not quite sure. It took another several minutes for us to get our drinks. We were seated around 9:30 with no apologies for the wait. We did have a nice table waiting for us along with a special menu with the B-day wish for my husband which was a nice touch. \n\nIf someone at the table wants the tasting menu then everyone at the table must have the tasting menu (annoying) so we all agreed to the tasting menu. The table had mixed reviews on the quality of the meal, however we all agreed for the price it was a ridiculously small amount of food. They brought out a scoop of sherbet for my husbands birthday with a candle (really shouldn't have bothered) and then disappeared. We couldn't figure out where our waiter had gone? We were just about to go to the kitchen to find him so we could get out check and he reappeared. We were the last people to leave the restaurant and asked if they could call a cab, they said they would, but a cab never arrived and there was nobody around to ask if they could call again. They clearly did not want to be bothered. \n\nThe whole vibe of the restaurant is a bit snooty for a lack of a better word and there was no feeling of joy or laughter in the room (my husband called it 'morgue like').

I am a changed man, a believer, if you will.\nI tend to believe that the upper echelon restaurants nearly never live up to the hype... but not Quince.\nThe entire experience was a genuine treat. Enough with the foreplay, I feel like you are ready for it:\nFirst course- Sea Scallop\nConsidering scallop is quintessentially butter, when cooked perfectly, there is nothing better. 'Melt in your mouth' has never been such an accurate description.\n\nSecond course- Tortellini\nThis tortellini was remarkably unique.  The pasta resembled sui mai dumplings more than traditional tortellini.  Stuffed with smoked ricotta (which I had no idea could ever be so creamy), and finished with acacia (honey) and black pepper, the dish was a winner.\n\nThird course- Sweetbreads\nI am of the opinion that if your are confident with a restaurant, and they offer sweetbreads, or duck, then ordering should be a no-brainer. However, if both duck and sweetbreads are offered, things can get hairy.  Pulling a last minute audible, I went with the sweetbreads, and was not disappointed.

We arrived spot on time and waited about 15 minutes for our table. \n\nWe sat for several minutes with menus and water, but no bread or sign of the waiter.  The menus did have \"Happy Anniversary\" printed on them, which was a nice touch.  When the waiter arrives, we ordered the two tasting menus (chef and seafood) along with the wine pairings.  \n\nThen the bread arrived, foccacine I think they called it.  Yum.\n\nThe meal was very good, but not great.  A couple of good courses, but a couple of ho-hum, tasty but something I could make at home.  The wine pairings were diassapointing-- again good, but not inspired.  A 2004 Barolo was simply too young to drink, or should have been decanted for a couple hours.  \n\nOnce the service got going, it was smooth and unobtrusive.  We had a good table with a view of the whole place, which looked more like a restaurant in Manhatten rather than San Francisco-- a nice change of pace in a formal kind of way.  \n\nFor the price, I would say not up to par with other fine dining options.  I would recommend those who can routinely afford this type of thing to try it out, but if this is a rare event, take the time to get a reservation at some place like Gary Danko or Cyrus instead.", "author": "Richard L."}

The meal, which consisted of 5 courses, took 3 hours and 45 minutes for a two-top. Literally, we sat down to eat at 8:10 (our reservations were for 8pm) and did not walk out of the restaurant until 11:45pm. The following outlines how two people could possibly spend over 2 hours in a restaurant:\n\n1. No one approaches you to take your order until 15 minutes into the dinner. \n\n2. Bread and drinks arrive another 20 minutes later.\n\n3. 45 minutes into the meal, the wrong dish appears. \n\n4. It takes them another 20 minutes to make the right dish. \n\n5. 30 minutes after the first course, you decide you need to go to the bathroom. As soon as you stand up, the wait staff rushes over to the table and blames the bathroom trip on the lateness of the second course, telling the remaining member of your party that it was going to come out just as you stood up to go to the bathroom. Puh-lease!\n\n6. The supposedly prepared second course takes another 15 minutes to arrive once you return from the bathroom. \n\n7. The remaining courses appear every 20-30 minutes. \n\nOn top of it all, the food sucked. Seriously boring sea bass, a mortifyingly disgusting palate cleanser of mango/tanagerine/fennel/celery, boring beef, and a grotesque spaghetti/truffle/parmesan mix that tasted like children's butter and noodles. \n\nI will give the pastry chef credit. Well done desserts. \n\nBut seriously, Quince will never be able to maintain its stature with this kind of service.  For two people, the tasting menu should take two hours tops. It was appalling. And at the end of the meal, they denied that our service was particularly bad, even though every other table around finished well before us (in fact at least two tables had been seated and finished before our meal was even over and we were one of two tables remaining at the end of the night). \n\nBottomline: Avoid Quince and spend your $400 at a restaurant that deserves its reputation.", "author": "Jaclyn W."}

Funny enough, what was most memorable were the cocktails. I don't typically order martinis, but their house martini was the BEST cocktail I have ever had. It just tasted so pure. Our waiter actually wheeled out a cart with all sorts of contraptions, and demonstrated the entire process while giving us a history and martini-making lesson in one!

But I was underwhelmed by the experience. We came  for dinner to celebrate my husband's birthday, what I liked about the place is very easy to make a reservation, however they called me to confirm it on the day of the reservation, given that this place has a 48h cancellation policy, that seemed strange.\n\nQuince is not as romantic as I expected, we were seating very close to another couple, very easy to hear their conversation, and to be heard. The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable, very young too, they did seem a little blas\u00e9 at times, which was also surprising. They did not replace, or fold our napkins when we left to go to the restrooms, as it would happen at Aquarello or Gary Danko. Overall, I felt the service was lethargic. Often times we had more than one drink in front of us, and I felt rushed to finish my wine from the previous course as they were already serving the next course.\n\nBoth my husband and I had the Quince menu, with the wine pairing, and the white truffle supplement. The food was really good, the wine was outstanding, and however I would have appreciate more than one pouring of red wine. The only time during our meal we were served red wine was when we had venison, even though it makes sense with the menu it does make you feel a little cheated. We had the following:\n1.       An assortment of small dishes, very interesting and delicious.\n2.       Black caviar with maine diver scallop which was excellent.\n3.       Abalone, extremely soft. They do massage it to perfection, and serve with the extra white truffles. It was interesting.\n4.       King crab musque de provence pumpkin, satsuma mandarin, lemon verbena. Very tasty.\n5.       Gnudi porcini mushroom, fennel, chestnut. This course was served with table side shaved white mushroom, and abundant amount of it.\n6.       Fagottini acorn ranch cinta senese pig, wild nettle, aceto balsamico. This was probably my favorite dish, I could have more of it.\n7.       Venison medjool date, arrowhead cabbage, cipollini onion. Not gamey at all, very soft and delicious.\n8.       Valrhona guanaja cremeux piedmontese hazelnut, sightglass coffee, and some extra puff cream cake for my husband's birthday. It was good.\n\nMIGNIARDISES chocolates, confections. We did not get this, I saw other tables having it. Not a big deal as I don't really care for chocolate so much.\nThey did give us a hot chocolate to go, it was rich, and spicy, and very good. \n\nMaybe we came in on a day that the staff was a little worn out, however it feels that it should never be the case for a 2-michelin star place.

Well, OK, sort of in the kitchen -- the kitchen was actually on two levels with a short set of narrow stairs between the two.  The kitchen itself was so tiny, the \"Chef's Table\" was actually on the lower level where they made fresh pasta during the day; salads and desserts at night.  \n\nBut I digress . . . .\n\nQuite often, such success can breed failure.  What I mean is that -- just as there is a significant difference between cooking for four people at home versus cooking in a restaurant -- there is a HUGE difference between cooking for (round numbers or the sake of discussion) 20 people a night versus 200.  (Whatever the actual numbers of covers Quince used to do compared to what they do now; you know what I mean.)  Frequently the new, larger place NEVER lives up to the quality and the feel, of the original.\n\nThis was my big concern about the \"new\" Quince.\n\nThen again, knowing Michael and Lindsay Tusk, I needn't have been concerned.\n\nMichael Tusk and his kitchen staff haven't regressed; they've progressed.  Michael has long been known as a genius for his house-made pasta, and that certainly remains the case, but I swear he's gotten even better . . . \n\nWe started out with first courses of carpaccio of monkfish with black truffle, a Maine lobster salad, and saut\u00e9ed sea scallops on a potato galette - all this paired with an exquisite bottle of Raymond Boullard Brut Rose nv Champagne.  These dishes would have been enough to make us rave about Quince.\n\nFor our pasta course, I had their highly regarded angliotti - a favorite from the \"old\" Quince - delicate pasta filled with a mixture of veal, pork and rabbit in a stock reduction; Sherri had a tagliatelle and crab . . . LOTS of succulent, fresh Dungeness crab; and Lynn had the gnocchi with black truffle - pint-sized pillows of pure pleasure piled high that melt in your mouth.  Then, Michael sent out an extra little pasta for us to have:  little ravioli (tortelli?) clouds filled with ricotta, so delicate, so decadent, so delicious . . . mmmmmmmmmmmmm.  I think we all died and went to heaven!  These were paired with a McCrea Vineyards Viognier from the Ciel du Cheval vineyard in Washington State.\n\nAlthough, as I said, Michael's long been known for his pastas, his entre\u00e9s are also stellar.  Lynn had the sweetbreads - hedonistically rich and succulent. Sherri had the squab which, quite simply, was the best, most amazing, phenomenal squab I have ever had in my life.  (Hey!  All pigeons should be so lucky!)  I had the duck two ways - perfectly cooked breast accompanied by a duck confit that was outstanding.  This, paired with a Castello dei Rampolla Chianti Classico.\n\nFor dessert, we had a milk chocolate mousse, coupled with a lovely licorice sobet; and a pear cake, with bits of both fresh and candied pear and gelato.\n\nLindsay said to us that the new location has only been open for 82 days and they aren't quite where they want to be yet.  If that's true, then Yelp better come up with a sixth star . . . \n\n* * * * * *\n\nAs always, \"good for kids\" depends upon the kid, and they have a room that can be used as a private dining room.

They put on a good game face when it comes to service, ambience, and ambitiousness of the menu.  There are lots of adjectives.  Tromboncino squash, anyone?  Yea, I thought so.  Open that wallet.  \n\nBut the concept just doesn't work.  French and Italian are like oil and water; one is about refined technique and precision, the other is about regional, rustic, grandma's food.  The muddled ideas show on the plate, in addition to the various unforced errors.  \n\nIt's a shame the Michelin Guide starred this place, but then again, they offer tromboncino squash.

I went with four other people and we opted for the 4 course tasting menu and added 6 cheese cart selections (my favorite of which was the Ottavio, Le Baladin).  Each dish was, quite simply, beautiful.  Every bite of food was absolutely perfect and there wasn't a single complaint from any of us or a speck of food left behind.  You could really taste the quality of the ingredients and they were combined in an unique and exciting way.  The meal was perfectly paced and the portion sizes were perfect - big enough so you felt satisfied, but small enough so that you could fit everything (even a few extra pieces of their delicious bread) into your belly.\n\nAlmost as enchanting as the food was the ambiance created by the impeccable waitstaff.  They were a well orchestrated team of professionals who were all attentive, but not over-bearing or intrusive.  My water glass was never empty, yet I rarely noticed it being refilled.  Our plates appeared and disappeared at exactly the same time without a sound.  I am always intimidated by fancy menus where the descriptions are filled with words I've never seen before, but our head server, Conan, wasn't intimidating at all and encouraged us to ask questions.  Conan enthusiastically answered all of them and his descriptions of the dishes left our mouths watering.  I found his descriptions of my food to be spot on.  He was very passionate, professional, charming and funny.  Quince was definitely one of the fanciest restaurants I have ever been to, but I never for a minute felt uncomfortable (even when I took a wrong turn looking for the bathroom).\n\nAbsolutely one of the best meals of my life, and I have been fortunate enough to have dined at a number of amazing restaurants including a few with Michelin stars. Of all of the Michelin-rated restaurants I have been to (Ame, Boulevard, Chez Panisse - when it had a star, Commis, Michael Mina and One Market), I would be most happy returning to Quince.  It is the most splurge-worthy of them all.", "author": "Amy C."}

My wife and I went there for our first anniversary and when I was making the reservation, they asked us about any food allergies, preferences, and if we were celebrating anything. When we arrived, we were greeted with customized menus wishing us a happy anniversary and including a tasting menu that accounted for our preference.\n\nThe first thing we had was \"gifts from the kitchen\" that included bite-sized appetizers that were delicious. They were designed to taste like common dishes like clam chowder and nachos served up in cracker-esque form, but they tasted much better.\n\nWe ended up doing the four-course menu for $95 per person and I felt that was a more than fair price by the time we were done with our meal. The tortelloni was excellent and I loved the beef, but I'm not sure if the same items are on the menu because it's constantly changing. The desserts were probably our most favorite thing, and we were given little treats at the end, including candied hazelnuts (fantastic!), macarons, and other petit fours.\n\nParking was easy but they also have valet. One funny thing is that their sister restaurant Cotogna is next door, so there are a few very casually dressed folks who come in for a drink at the bar. The servers are extremely attentive and the kitchen gives you palette cleansers, so allow 2.5 hours for dining - longer if you're doing the customized tasting menu.", "author": "Drew K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-21", "description": "I came here with a small group to celebrate the day of my birth.  Given the mixed reviews here I was slightly apprehensive about the service and food but it turns out there was absolutely nothing to worry about.  We all had a good experience.\n\nHalf of the party arrived early and waited in the lounge area.  We were offered a small bowl of house made potato chips with our beverages.  The chips were crisp and nicely seasoned with just the right amount of salt.  \n\nWhen we were seated they offered us menus and to my delight my name was printed on the menu along with a birthday wish!   A small gesture but a very nice touch indeed.  We all decided to order the tasting menu, with half of us ordering the chef's tasting menu and the other half ordering the seafood tasting menu.    We also ordered a superb burgundy (I cannot remember which one, sorry) to accompany the meal.\n\nI had ordered the chef tasting menu and it came with a mushroom soup amuse bouche, abalone, terrine of foie gras, squab and guinea hen, cheese and cabbage filled tortelli with black truffles, suckling pig prepared two ways and the meyer lemon tart (it's one of my favorites and asked for this instead of the dessert offered with this menu option).  The dishes that stood out to me were definitely the abalone, suckling pig and lemon tart.  The abalone was tender and meaty and accompanied by a quail egg, porcini mushrooms and garlic.  Delicious!  The terrine of foie gras was prepared well but definitely a bit rich for my taste.  A little goes a long way and this portion size was perfect.  The pasta was well cooked and flavorful; there were plenty of truffles shaved over the dish.  The suckling pig was prepared two ways, one way included a piece of very crispy skin and the other way as thin slices.  The pork was juicy, tender and every so slightly unctuous.  The meyer lemon tart was simply divine. The crust was buttery and flaky, the filling was creamy, tart and slightly sweet, the meringue was light and slightly toasted.  A perfect ending!  At the end of the meal they brought out a selection of chocolates, chocolate cake bites and fruit jellies.\n\nService was efficient and friendly without being overbearing, obtrusive or obsequious.  Our waiter was very accommodating with our requests and made sure that I had a wonderful birthday celebration (I did!).  Sometimes a girl just needs to be pampered and spoiled!\n\nGiven the reviews here I was worried about the portion sizes, especially for those in my party that enjoy \"getting their money's worth\".  After the third course I was a bit concerned I would leave hungry (this has only happened once before, at a now departed SF restaurant where I had ordered their 5 course meal) but the pork dish and dessert definitely hit the spot.  The portion sizes were perfect for the number of courses provided, at least for me.  I wasn't stuffed but I was definitely satisfied.\n\nThe ambiance reminded me of dining in NYC - modern and chic.  A nice change from all the comfort food driven establishments popping up in SF lately, for sure.  Parking was not an issue as there was plenty to be found.  My only complaint would be that the prices seemed a tad high in comparison to some of the other well regarded dining establishments in the Bay Area.", "author": "Melissa L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-11-10", "description": "One of everything.\n\nOnce in a while, the tired catch phrase surfaces at a meal, usually received by a smirk, a polite chuckle to acknowledge the ho-hum joke, perhaps a raised eyebrow that conveys, \"no, seriously, kids.\" But when indecision at the over-abundance of delicious sounding menu items rendered five insatiably hungry men helpless to make up their minds, a noble suggestion was brought forth. What if we used the phrase... and meant it?\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation at hearing the request, our waiter threw us the usual surrendered look of, \"gee, good one, never heard THAT before.\" There was a brief period of silence followed by a parting then pursing of his lips, and then a glimmer in his eyes, conveying...what exactly? Excitement? Mischief? A misinterpretation of \"you're cute - call me?\" \n\nBut, lo, as the crash of steel clanging to the ground echoed throughout the room, conversations became hushed and eyes turned toward our corner to behold, in plain sight, a gauntlet lying at our waiter's feet. \n\nThat's right. We threw it. And much to our utter astonishment, Quince picked it up and answered the challenge without so much as flinching.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that there was some pretense for wanting to put Quince to the test so brazenly. Quince's closing and re-opening was one of the most talked about restaurant moves to occur in San Francisco since The Slanted Door migrated from the Mission to the Embarcadero.  With Slanted Door, I watched with disdain as a model of quaint, cozy, neighborhood friendliness was replaced with a textbook formula for profiting off of tourists. It was as though a wholesome, country girl had moved to the big city, got a boob job and broke off all ties with her former, beautiful life.\n\nI hoped and prayed (to Bacchus) that Quince's move was something altogether different, a decision predicated on giving a precious work of art a setting befitting its refinery. At some point over the past several years, Quince became aware of its importance in the SF restaurant scene, and it outgrew its humble, townhouse surroundings. But would this go straight to her pretty little head?\n\nEnter Quince 2.0\nThe move, as it turns out, was liberating.  Not only did she get a sleek modern look, but she appears more comfortable in her new skin.  Quince didn't just get a makeover, she went through a metamorphosis, and what emerged was genuine, natural beauty - not one trace of silicone, lipo or Botox. (You can FEEL the difference...just ask first, and don't fondle, for god's sakes.) \n\nChef/Co-Owner, Michael Tusk, is still the top billing, and his name and that of the restaurant draw a familiar crowd.  What's less obvious is that Chef de Cuisine, Will Foden, has joined the fray (he was the former Chef de Cuisine at Jo\u00ebl Robuchon in Las Vegas  - the only other restaurant besides French Laundry this side of the Mississippi to receive Michelin's 3-star boner). \n\nWhatever the reason, the food at Quince is rapturous. What was executed for us was choreographed precision - every dish served hot (as appropriate) and all plates dropped simultaneously, even the extra shared plates that sat in the middle of our table. Preparing five, seven or nine of the same item for a Chef's tasting menu seems like child's play compared to the logistical nightmare of orchestrating the delivery of all items at once.\n\nQuince didn't just meet our challenge, she brought us to our knees. In all, we experienced over 20 plates, including a cheese plate and petit fours that tempted even the fullest of stomachs. With each course, there were standouts, but that's not to say that every dish wasn't superb. Not to be missed, are the SEA SCALLOPS (like buttah) with La Ratte potato and sea urchin; SWEETBREADS that oozed with the flavors of black truffles and Madeira; PAPPARDELLE with teasing tidbits of suckling pig; a ricotta, egg and brown butter RAVIOLO that sent us into reverence, then revelry; LAMB that very well could have been \"of god\" given it's preparation with coco nero bean and fried olives; and BASS that might as well have been air considering how easily it was inhaled.\n\nThat the five of us could part with a dish to allow everyone a taste was a stunning feat.  There were morsels worth fighting for to the death, and every remnant of sauce was mopped up with bread (plates of which were replenished generously).\n\nFor dessert, we soiled our armor with a BUTTERNUT SQUASH FONDANT that I can only describe as equating to a mouthful of warm, soft, non-sticky caramel.  Served with brown butter ice cream and caramelized honey, it was astounding.  As was the COMPOTE OF PLUOT, an unusual but highly pleasing confluence of flavors, served with toasted sesame and riso nero sorbet (chocolate rice - not squid ink).\n\nWhat could Quince do if she did all she can?

I recently moved to San Francisco and have heard nothing but amazing things about Quince, since my move.  So, needless to say, I was pretty excited to go there.\n\nA group of four of us went this past Saturday....all of whom appreciate good food, great wine and terrific service.  Now, don't get me wrong, I love nice places and have had the opportunity to go to many.  But Quince is BEYOND SNOOTY!!  I understand the concept of appetizer, 2nd course and entree.  No one in our party was interested in getting an appetizer, but we just wanted to try a pasta dish to go along with our entree.  We ordered one pasta dish for the four of us to try and the server made it very clear that we were not ordering enough, and not in a \"I think you may be hungry\" sort of a way, but rather in a \"I'm annoyed that you aren't ordering more items to make my tip larger\" sort of a way.  The server made things very awkward.  \n\nWe were right next to the cheese cart, which was pretty gross, considering I do not like cheese.  This may have wonderful someone else, but to smell the cheese the entire evening, got to be a bit much.\n\nSo, the food arrives, and was not very good.  The portion was fine, but the flavor profile was very bland and disappointing.  My duck did not even taste like duck and had been way over smoked.  My boyfriend got the sweetbreads and chicken, which was also a let-down.  \n\nThe kicker was when we got the bill.  Now, I knew we would be charged for sparkling water, but $18.00 is rediculous.

I feel you should inform people of this charge if you are going to go around a refill glasses at a charge.  \n\nBottom line.....nothing special about this place.

Still had a new feel to it, and the decor was simple yet elegant. They had a lot of room and the tables were large and spread out. had a brick facade that almost reminded me of Baltimore. Noticed plenty of for-business folk there (Groups of men, etc). Also, the three tables around us all had birthdays, which comes with a long thin candle on top of dessert. I told them ahead of time we were celebrating an early valentine's. I guess I don't blame them, but they didn't do anything special for us. Also, the girlfriend was cold throughout the meal. They put us next to the door of the wine cellar (cold). As I've mentioned in previous posts, this happens too often to us (a young couple) to be coincidence all the time, but could have been this time. \n\nStaff: Definitely the highlight of this restaurant, they had a large staff that was very very attentive to your needs, on par with Michelin 2-3 star places. It was a nice touch when they proactively asked us if we needed a taxi, told us at our table when the taxi arrived, and escorted us all the way to the taxi door and opened it for us. As a downside, our head waiter was a little difficult to understand. He spoke perfect English, but spoke a bit fast or something, and neither of us really heard what the food was made out of or how it was prepared (which is a really big part of the eating experience!). \n\nDrinks: We had a Quince Martini while we waited a couple of minutes for our table (literally 2 minutes). One of the best Martini's I've had in quite some time - definitely worth a try. Also had a half bottle of the Lucia Pinot Noir ($42). It was alright but nothing to write home to mom about. Was lower on the tannins but the taste and after-taste were very mediocre. would recommend something else.\n\nFood: It was consistently good, but nothing was memorable. We had the four course pre fixe menu ($85 a person):\nIn order of eating:\nFirst reaction: No amuse-bouche? A little surprised.\nCourse 1) Appetizer\na. The Lobster Salad - it was fine, but didn't think the flavors of the greens really added to to the lobster particularly. The lobster was...lobstery but nothing special. I guess that's all I'd normally expect, except I'm still remembering the lobster at French Laundry and know that lobster can be done superbly. \nb. The frois grois with brioche and..some sort of sweet fruit substance. dates maybe? (missed because I couldn't understand the waiter!) This dish may have been one of the highlights of the night. The frois grois was soft but not mushy, and the fruit substance really added to it well. \n\nCourse 2) Pasta\na) dungeness crab tagliatelle - generous portions of dungeness crab, was good, creamy and on a normal night, would love to have had in large quantities as my main course.   \nb) angliotti - oversimplifying, these were mini raviolis with meat in them. these had a good taste to them, but I won't be remembering these in a few days.      \n\nCourse 3) Entree (meat)\na) The duck - both the duck and the lamb were served with a \"tasting menu\" idea in mind. They served us different portions of the duck allowing us to distinguish the differences between the different parts of the animal. I thought the duck breast was a tiny bit dry and lacked flavor. The other portion of the duck was pretty tasty in my opinion, but a little salty for the gf. the last portion of the duck, we couldnt even tell if it had duck in it or if it was a side...  \nb) The lamb was good but again, lacked any particular flavor to make it anything really memorable. \nIn short, I guess we were really supposed to be concentrating on comparing the different parts of the animal...but lacking a unique flavor, it tasted like the plenty of duck and lamb I've had in the past.\n\nCourse 4) Dessert: \na) Souffle - (pinapple coconut souffle with pinapple ice cream) tasted like a warm baked pina colada. literally. when the girlfriend said her souffle tasted like a pina colada, i laughed. but when i tasted it, it literally tasted like a pina colada. if you like pina coladas, then eat it. creatively done though.\nb) apple lady fingers with...saffron ice cream? (can't remember) Light, but nothign special. The ice cream had a nice flavor, but I'd opt to try another dessert before getting this again.\n\nGave us a little post dinner treat - 2 mini chocolate macaroon (good), 2 coffee macaroon like pastry (tasteless), and 2 coconut jelly (meh). \n\nThe damage? $288 after tax and tip (great service, so we tipped 20%).

Tortelloni with castelmagno cheese, honey and candied walnut and maccheroni rigate with pork sausage, ricotta cheese, and black truffle for pasta dishes. Rabbit and duck for entree. The dishes were mostly refined, but reserved, borderline dull. \n\nLastly the service was proper, but lacked personality, almost robotic. Maybe Cotogna, Quince's newborn sister, is a little more exciting. I will have to find out.", "author": "Aldo H."}

Tried the chef's five course tasting menu last night. Highlights were the poached lobster over corn and english peas, the piccolo raviolo di ricotta (always my favorite pasta dish here! house made ricotta filling with a farm fresh egg yolk baked in the middle. Once you carve into it luscious egg yolk spills out all over -  yum!) and the suckling pig platter (a bite of sausage, a tiny chop, some tenderloin - all perfectly cooked).\n\nAt one point, my fork slipped into some sauce on my plate. It didn't make a sound, but as soon as I removed it and put the fork to the side, ready to turn and wave down a server, there was already a gracious server extending a shiny new fork! Now that is service. \n\nMust leave room for cheese cart next time. I couldn't even eat my grilled peach homemade ice cream dessert!\n\nWhile they are known for a good wine list, cocktails here are also fantastic.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-05-04", "description": "My wife and I went here for dinner on the tail end of our honeymoon.  I had previously polled my brother, who is a foodie, to ask his friends in San Francisco for high end restaurant recommendations for this celebratory dinner.  We got multiple recommendations from each of my brother's friends but the one common thread among them was Quince.  And let me say that my wife and I were not disappointed.\n\nWe got the tasting menu, and I'm not going to get into the specifics of the food because I just don't have the time to write that long of a review.  Suffice it to say that each course was inventive and we both really enjoyed the entire meal.  The risotto and the crab mousse were especially delicious.  Many of Quince's Yelp reviewers have complained that not every course on the tasting menu blew them away, but I think that's just the nature of a tasting menu.  You're going to like some more than others, and maybe only a few will really blow you away.  But the point of a tasting menu is to put yourself in the capable hands of the chef, and at Quince even the courses that weren't my favorites were still very, very good.  Other reviewers have complained about the portion size, but the tasting menu is extensive enough that even a voracious eater like me was stuffed by the end.  \n\nBut I have to say that the best part of the night was the service.  Attentive without being overbearing, knowledgeable without being snooty, and friendly without being insincere.  The service was just impeccable.  I am relatively young (at least I like to think so) and I look younger than I am, and I often worry about not being taken seriously at high end restaurants, but this was not a problem here.  I've noticed other reviewers complain about snooty treatment but I also noticed that most of these reviewers admitted that they either wore casual clothing or went to Quince without a reservation or both.  Quince takes the dining experience seriously, so why not do the same?  For as good as their food and their service are, plan ahead, make a reservation, and dress up a bit.  I wore a suit and tie and my wife wore a nice dress and heels, and they treated us wonderfully.  For example, my wife and I were staying in a hotel closer to downtown SF, and I mentioned to her that I wasn't sure how easy it would be to find a cab near the restaurant to return to the hotel.  Our server heard this and stated that he would take care of it.  As we paid the bill, he said that our cab was outside waiting for us.  So thoughtful!\n\nQuince is expensive but it's worth it.  If you're looking for a delicious meal with incredible service to celebrate a special occasion, you can't go wrong with Quince.", "author": "Barrie C."}

We were very impressed since the day we made the reservation.  We received multiple confirmation emails as well as a phone call where I was able to discuss with the hostess my dietary restrictions - nothing too specific but wanted to be sure if we were paying for a 9 - course tasting menu that I would be happy with all of the choices.  We were surprised when we sat down and Dan (lead) greeted us and had made note of all of my notes that I had discussed previously.  We were also greeted with two full glasses of champagne for our honeymoon!!  \n\nWe decided on the 9 - course tasting menu with wine pairings.  We also decided that we wanted to do the blind wine tasting - which meant they would pour right before the course came and mid-course would come and explain what the wine was and how it paired with the course.  \n\nFrom the second we sat down we were full taken care of by the entire Quince team - each server that came to our table seemed to know us, knew which course we were on, what dishes I didn't eat, etc.  It was a perfect ambiance - light music and we could actually hear each other talk - which was perfect!!\n\nLOVES:  Bread service - best bread we have ever had, local and fresh bean ravioli, Black Cod, size of each course, impeccable service, amuse bouche\n\nA few things to note - the 9 course meal ultimately ends up being around 12 with the amuse bouche and intermezzo!!  Also - for the blind wine tasting - don't do this if you aren't fully confident in the pairing, we had some very different flavors!\n\nWe look forward to coming back to Quince at each visit we have to San Francisco - a definite favorite to look back on forever!!", "author": "Haley H."}

Me and my dining companion both had the 4-course tasting meal going a little extra by splitting the dover sole for 2 and adding the cheese course. Along with 4 splendid courses we were treated to an additions two amuses (a basil and buratta cookie followed by a almond gazpacho), selections of rolls to pair with courses throughout the meal, a bit of lemon ice and sorbet palate cleanser, after dessert chocolates and chocolate coated hazelnuts, and an extra little caramel cake for our special occasion. The food was delicious throughout and I thought the dover sole (topped with truffles and accompanied by lobster mushrooms and sunchokes) was a perfect selection for the main course of the menu. The meal showcased culinary expertise and fine execution but lacked a dish that stood out among the others and would lead me to highly recommend someone else to go to seek out. I was also underwhelmed by the cheese selections provided as this was a part of the meal where I experienced some definite misses and wish I was given a little more guidance as to what was available. For each cheese selected it seemed like one option was given rather than a true walk through of what was provided or what might match our preferences. The service was extremely attentive, maybe a little too much so. We were approached several times by different staff at the beginning with the same questions and it seemed an obtrusive way to start the meal. There's a fine line between attentiveness and overbearing and they definitely stepped on both sides of this line throughout the meal. Despite this, Quince was exceptional and I'm glad I experienced it during my time in San Francisco. I found the dining room charming and the table setting intimate (except when the service felt interrupting). I'm left wanting to offer a little something more than a 4 star review (I feel like Quince is solidly a 4.5) to capture what I saw as the epitome of Quince, a little more than you expect every step along the way.", "author": "Stephen S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-03-14", "description": "My wife and I were a bit disappointed by the dinner we had last night at Quince. After reading the Michael Bauer review, and having eaten before at the original Quince location in Pacific Heights, we were expecting thoroughly exceptional Italian food, but instead found ourselves eating rather fussily presented and prepared Lillipution-sized foo-foo entrees that might have made more sense in a tasting menu. \n\nFirst, the pluses: The remodeled space is terrific. It's probably the nicest restaurant space in the city - very elegant and at the same time comfortable and cozy, as it's divided into several different areas surrounding the central dining area. The seating is divided between chairs and couches, which adds to the sense of coziness. \n\nThe service is also impeccable. We were given a tour of the restaurant right after we walked in including the huge wine cellar. We had three or four people serving us at various times. Our waitress was very helpful in picking out wines by the glass and letting us have tastes before we chose. One waiter was dedicated solely to breads of which you have a choice each time he comes by. \n\nNow, the minuses: Although all the food was good, none of it wowed us. As mentioned, the food was overly miniaturized and over thought - pretty to look at, but not a complete package. I couldn't tell if I was eating Italian, French, or nondescript Euro-zone food. From the lobster salad that we shared to my pasta and main course - all of the food was presented in smaller than bite sized pieces with insufficient complexity of flavor. The minuscule agnolotti (2 to 3 to a bite) were unadorned except for a so-so brown sauce. The whole dish could be consumed in 1 - 2 minutes, which is pretty short for a $20 pasta dish. My main course - rabbit served four ways - also looked and tasted like a large appetizer. Our dessert - the pineapple souffle - also missed the mark.\n\nEvery dish seemed incomplete and slightly one-dimensional - we could see and taste the skill, but there seemed to be little soul or wow factor in any of the dishes. \n\nAll in all, terrific service, great surroundings, and obvious culinary skill do not always add up to a great restaurant.", "author": "Stan B."}

And by got my act together, I mean I found a nice young gentleman nice enough to take me. \n\nAs soon as I walked in, I immediately felt at home. You know how some restaurants have that spacious, airy, business-casual feel? (Michael Mina for example) Well this was quite the opposite - the intimate, warm dining room and close seating arrangement (which I like, because frankly eavesdropping can make the night far more interesting) made me want to sprawl out on some luxurious couch and bundle up in a dark-brown fake fur blanket next to a fireplace. It will be very interesting to see how the atmosphere will change when they move into their new spot (myth's old location) in 6 weeks. \n\nThe service - exceptional. Not stuffy at all, but certainly still professional. The only thing that might have been better was an explanation of why a particular wine was being paired with a dish, instead of just saying the name. But that's just me being picky and really not a reflection of how smoothly the service was run.\n\nOkay but obviously what we really care about is the food. I'll explain it like this - every dish was solid and perfectly cooked (I question if I've ever had a better cooked octopus), but there were only a select few that blew me away. One of which was the Triangoli of poussin with summer truffle, Madeira, and leeks. Finally! A pasta which wasn't delicious just because everyone loves pasta. The ingredients worked so well together that they should change the name from \"triangoli of poussin\" to \"triangoli of happiness in my mouth.\" The other stand-out was the lamb, which has inspired me to try to re-create the dish at home. Once I've perfected it, I'll invite Michael Tusk over for a lamb throw down.\n \nOne question. William Werner, why are you so good? His beautifully plated desserts (the frozen blackberry tart and peach creation) captured the essence of each fruit without over-complicating the dish. I don't even like peach and I was trying to steal my date's gelees from his plate when he wasn't looking!\n\nWhat really made the night special was being able to go back into the kitchen and talk to Michael Tusk and William Werner. I think they are the most approachable chefs I have ever been lucky enough to talk to, and I ended up having a good 10-15 minute conversation with them in the back. Next time I visit this restaurant (hopefully in the next 2 months to see the new space), I'm bringing them a special home-made treat to say thanks for being so cool. Then we will clearly be best friends for life.\n\nThomas Keller said that Quince is currently one of his favorite restaurants in SF, and I can see why.

After perusing the menu for some time and having my (many) questions answered by my very knowledgeable server (my knowledge of pasta has surpassed beyond spaghetti, ravioli, and macaroni now!), I decided to go with the a la carte menu. After I placed my order, the following exchange occurred with my server.\n\nHer: That's way too much food.\nMe: Yeah, I know...\nHer: No really. It's a lot. You can't eat all that.\nMe: I'm well aware that's a lot of food.\n\nShe insisted, so I took one protein dish off my list. She still thought it was too much food for two people but let it go. All the pasta dishes (except for the timballo) were available in \"tasting portions\" for $14.\n\nWe started off with the lobster salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=14v7QXsH435AHyzRwtGNag) and sformato of wild nettle (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=YVYfTbiLlvLqhMk8FrW9Cw). The salad was amazing. The pieces of lobster tail were so succulent and the vinaigrettes had a perfect balance of sweet and tangy. One was even made with foie gras butter! I also loved the sformato. It reminded me of a budino, with a very smooth and creamy texture. The parmigiano reggiano sauce was so good I was tempted to use my fingers to get the last of it.\n\nWe ordered all 5 (+1 on the house) of the pasta dishes: \n1) Chitarra of squid ink with red wine braised octopus (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=0_iN9RKXWHTN4hU8FwmwxQ)\n2) Tagliolini with morel mushroom and asparagus (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=03WSF5k9g--P42uLxTtIyQ)\n3) Fagotelli with artichoke, black truffle and parmigiano reggiano (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=XTo8JP9fRx_2JGeNKSWyIw) [pretty sure I pronounced this pasta wrong when I was ordering...]\n4) Piccolo raviolo with ricotta della casa and quail egg (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=tBQiOoL81OXbRuyFvu4tgw)\n5) Trenette with sweetbreads and english pea (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=AZh0ar3vfvA2_JD9qn83hA)\n6) Timballo di maccheroni with spring lamb ragout (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=9oEY7ANj4kdQVoe9VU6rLg, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=CcQslEjDmFOg06tr5bjGzw)\nThese were all very good, but my favourites were the piccolo ravioli (the quail egg cooked in the pasta was ingenous!), trenette (perfectly cooked sweetbreads), and timballo (like a tower with a ring of macaroni standing upright on the outside, with the lamb ragout inside; loved the cheese sauce that came with it). The only one I didn't care for too much was the chitarra - didn't like the texture and there wasn't much flavour.\n\nFor the protein course, we had the steelhead (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=Szceg-mcOddjHcOkHEztJg). This was really great too and the fish was perfectly cooked. Steelhead is kinda like trout/salmon - fatty and flavourful.\n\nWe ended with 3 desserts: the chocolate beignets with espresso-cardamom gelato (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=pqKEpFv8zdXgSgU6Y0in6g) (good, but nothing spectacular; could've used more cardamom in the gelato), passionfruit souffl\u00e9 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=xRpxnFKMVdFJ52v_DA92cw) (if you like passionfruit, you'll love this), and caramel poached apples with yogurt mousse (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zFxD8QinHt69Bs7M2mgB-Q?select=yflOZC2-xlgu-Thp99z_MQ) (tasty, but nothing spectacular either except for the yogurt mousse).\n\nAfter we were done, our server came up to us and asked, incredulously, \"Where does it all go!?\" I just smiled and told her I have a tendency to freak out my servers...", "author": "Steph L."}

We ordered the 9 course Quince menu.  Everything was perfect.  The pasta courses were exceptional.  The entree that evening was venison. I'm not a huge fan of game so they were kind enough to sub the suckling pig which was on the 5 course menu.  While the pig was good, it was not nearly as good as the venison.  It wasn't too \"gamey\" and the sauce they paired with it was great.  It was just a little more special and unique than the suckling pig.  The milk bread was also very good, coming to the table warm from the oven.  The fish that evening was very good (can't remember what type) but had a crispy skin, cooked to perfection, flakey and delicate.  The service was excellent- attentive, took time to explain each dish, staff was very knowledgeable.  Overall we had such a great experience that I decided to book the private dining room to celebrate my dad's birthday.\n\nThe private dining experience was all around wonderful. The staff assisting us from the planning stages to the service in the dining room were great, accommodating and very easy to work with.  The room was very nice with the wine cellar next door, very spacious and comfortable for our party of 19 (including kids).  There's a couch in the room which was great for relaxing. They assisted me in selections for the 5 course dinner.  All of the food was very good, (including a crab appetizer, pasta, fish, beef fillet and chocolate dessert) The pasta was exceptional.  The dessert tray was also wonderful, and I particularly loved the mini canneles.  Everybody on staff that evening was great and helped make it a wonderful and memorable celebration for the family.\n\nI should have written this review sooner so that I would remember all of the details of the food.  But overall, I would definitely recommend Quince for a nice evening out in SF or a special occasion.  Food, service and decor were all spectacular.

When we mentioned we were from the Bay Area, only one word was uttered from his mouth.. \"Quince!\" I had been to quince a few years back at their old location, and filed away this highest of recommendations for when they would re-open. Now that they had re-opened, I quickly made a reservation and awaited re-experiencing Quince at its new location.\n\nThe evening started out well with us finding street parking on the same block as the restaurant. Upon checking in for our 10PM reservation (yes, I made the mistake of trying to reserve only a week ahead), we discovered that our name wasn't on the list!! I'm sure the problem was my communication, but the host graciously pulled a few strings and we got seated at 9:50PM (we had arrived a bit early).\n\nFood.. My, was it glorious. We opted for the tasting menu. Our amuse bouche, a chilled maine lobster with diced fruit (we think it was quince) was excellent. It set a theme that we saw recur throughout the night; the pairing of sweetness with our dishes.\n\nFirst Course- Tuna. Amazing seared tuna, with its flavors brought out by the sweetness of ripe watermelon and with hints of saltiness provided by cured fish roe (bottarga).\n\nSecond Course- Abalone. The abalone was lightly dusted and fried, it seemed. The opposing sweetness was provided by lemon and bursts of flavor from what looked like fried baby spiders, but was arugula, I'm sure. It was topped with some sort of puree of what tasted like sun dried tomatoes + cranberries. Very delicious.\n\nThird Course- Sturgeon. THE BEST STURGEON I'VE EVER TASTED. The flesh was perfectly cooked, so it had not yet become too flaky but still had the bounce of rareness in the center. Reminded me of the halibut texture at Portland City Grill.\n\nFourth Course- Tortelloni. The tortelloni pasta was impossibly delicate, and stuffed with a cheese that was very savory. To counterbalance that, the tortelloni was topped with honey and candied walnut bits. Such a delightful contrast.\n\nFifth Course- Agnolotti. The most straightforward course, which looked like little wontons stuffed with piedmontese sausage.\n\nSixth Course- Suckling Pig. I have no idea how you prepare pork such that it tastes like well prepared rare steak, while still being cooked thoroughly. However, Quince figured it out and served it with this dish. Delightful.\n\nSeventh and Eight Courses- Dessert. To be honest, the desserts did not stand out as much to us. One was a frozen passion fruit tart (which did have an excellent crust) and one was an apple tarte tatin, which had great apple flavor and vanilla gelato accompaniment.\n\nBread- They offer you several types of bread, of which I liked the small xiao-long-bao shaped variety that seemed fried, as it was crispy! the butter was an excellent, soft butter, and we definitely overloaded on bread.\n\nService- Very efficient. For the first week out of the gate, the timing on our dishes matched our temperament very well, which was rather a faster tempo. \n\nOverall, Quince is definitely within my top 5 dining recommendations in the greater bay area.", "author": "Walter W."}

First, the stars are based on value so if my meal wasn't $150 per person I would probably go to 3 stars. Second, I was turned off from the beginning because they made me give them a CC# for a party of 4. When I tried to cancel because my pregnant wife thought our reservation might be too late for her they told me they would charge me a $100 cancellation fee. When we did show up (on time) they sat us a half hour late.  The hostess didn't really get my point when I told her she owed me $50. Point is, if you are going to threaten your groups with a cancellation fee you had better keep up your end of the bargain.\n\nWith that said, all of this comes down to the food. IMO, 3 out of the 4 courses were rather ordinary.  The main course was solid.  Everything else I have had better of.  The service was odd.  They were very attentive, but almost too much since our conversations were frequently cut off by waiters reaching over you. You are not supposed to notice service.  Here you do.\n\nIf this restaurant was in a more competitive environment (NY, Chicago, Philly) it would not have the reputation that it does or be able to get away with treating people like it does.", "author": "Keith W."}

The decor of the restaraunt is very simple but somewhat elegant at the same time. The personalized menu wishing the manfriend a happy birthday was such a great touch. \n\nWe opted for dining a la carte, so we could pick and choose which dishes we wanted to order, and boy did we order a few! We started with the halibut crudo and burrata cheese plates. If I wasn't wearing a dress and in a fancy pants place like Quince, I would have licked the plate the burrata came on. Between the pesto, tomatoes and warm cheese I was in heaven.\n\nNext round was the agnolotti and the suckling pig pasta off the tasting menu (which was another wonderful surprise as this dish was off the tasting menu and we weren't sure we'd get a taste). I could've stopped with these. My night would have been complete to just eat lots and lots and lots of both of these pastas! \n\nOur entree selections were the guinea hen and the devil's gulch rabbit. Both were absolutely delicious with the proteins equally balancing out the sides on the plate. And come on, you cannot beat tender meat wrapped in puff pastry! \n\nDessert was the buckwheat crepe with the mulberry ice cream and rooftop honey. Although I have a completely irrational fear of all things bees and wasps, if all honey could taste like the Quince rooftop honey, I would consider welcoming bees into my life.\n\nAll in all, one of the best meals I have had in a loooong time.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-12", "description": "Quince is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful food. I was a fan of Myth for its modern and sleek decor and great food, but Quince really takes it to the next level. The spacious room with neutral colors, high ceiling and giant windows is impeccably decorated. Even down to the utensils and food vessels were simply elegant. The ambiance is perfect for \"fine dining, \" but doesn't feel stuffy or outdated. \n\nThe food was great. My husband and I both have small appetites, so we each ordered an appetizer and a pasta dish. The waiter warned us that the portions are small, but they were perfect portions for us and left us enough room to enjoy desserts. My appetizer, steamed-then-chilled octopus on a bed of farro had this citrus-y taste, very light but flavorful. The somewhat crunchy octopus slices against the chewy farro also create a nice textural contrast. \n\nMy husband's farm egg with goose confit was great also. The goose confit was flavorful and not dry at all. The only thing he didn't like were the potato slices underneath that had a bit of a chalky taste and gritty texture. \n\nMy pasta, the taglioni (can't remember the exact spelling) was delicious and cheesy, but unlike a bowl of alfredo fettuccine that's greasy and has a one-dimensional taste, the creaminess of the dish was perfect. It was also great to have something heartier like this after a citrus-y appetizer. The smoked eel came in tiny pieces, but since they had such a strong flavor, I was glad that they didn't add more. \n\nMy husband's pasta looked like tiny raviolis that came with prosciutto. He thought they were on the salty side, but otherwise a good dish. \n\nNormally this is where diners go on to their third course, the entree, but I am glad we saved room for desserts instead. My husband had the orange sorbet, a perfect way to end his meal since he's been craving Popsicles all day. I chose the Bombolini, a beignet-like dessert filled with banana cream, very doughy, very satisfying. I even liked the coconut and crunchy almonds that came along when normally these would be on the bottom of my preferences. Overall the dish just worked very well together. \n\nAlong with dessert, I ordered a pot of oolong tea that came in a cute tea set. We then ended our meal with complimentary sweets, including a fruit jelly thing, a tiny opera and a tiny cake with toasted rice crispies on top. Simple, not too much, and all delicious. \n\nNow the miscellaneous: \n\nThe cool: Although the 5:30 reservation makes you feel like an elderly couple enjoying an early special so you can get to bed by 8, the parking around that time is awesome. We easily parked right across the street. \n\nThe good: Food came out very promptly. And we found out why after we left and watched a line of waiters waiting patiently in the kitchen so that whenever the food is ready, they are ready to serve them up. (These waiters only serve food, they don't take orders or pass out bread or fill your water.) \n\nThe bad: when we were seated, we were immediately given the wine menu but nothing else. Since we weren't drinking wine, we ended up waiting for quite a while being totally bored with no one attending us, while there were like 8 wait staff member just standing around. To be fair, Quince has a strict system where each one has a specific job, but why did it take so long for our waiter to show up? \n\nThe extra nice details: the bathroom is so pretty and smelled so good! And it provides lotions and real towels. A very nice touch to a nice evening. \n\nI feel like because we didn't have any entrees, I couldn't justify giving it a 5 star yet. But I would absolutely love to come back and if we get the same level of experience again, it's definitely a 5 star restaurant.", "author": "Candice B."}

Unfortunately, the management has neither an appreciation for hospitality nor good judgment, as they succeeded in ruining and therefore aborting the experience as soon as we arrived.\nDue to horrendous traffic on the way to the restaurant, we arrived 15 minutes late for a 6:30 p.m. reservation. Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by the host, who promptly told us that we had two options: either we could be seated at our table and be limited to the five-course menu as long as we left the table by 9:30 p.m., or we could have the nine-course menu while seated in the lounge, which has the atmosphere of a Travel Lodge lobby.\nWe were stunned by this awkward, tasteless greeting and protested the unreasonable restrictions but sat at our table, somewhat dejected yet hoping that our \"greeting\" was not sincere. However, our server spelled out the same script to us, whereupon my mother and I became upset and we decided to get up and leave. We were met by a couple of servers as well as the host and reiterated to the host that we had never been told by any fine dining establishment anywhere -- including some of the best in the world -- that there was a preset time limit to our dining experience and that they had ruined my birthday. We left Quince and had to make last-minute arrangements to salvage the evening elsewhere on a Saturday night in San Francisco, not a particularly easy task to say the least.\nThe staff at Quince may think that they are being proactive by guaranteeing table availability at a set time -- and that while assuming that the target of their ill-advised action will definitely exceed their time limit -- but such shortsightedness only succeeds in making their guests' experience unpleasant and causing them to never again patronize such a insensitive and pigheaded establishment.", "author": "James A."}

I enjoyed the decor and thought it matched the food well.  Could Quince do the same?\n\nI must admit.  I was apprehensive before arriving.  The latest Yelp reviews haven't been too flattering for Quince.  It made me wonder if Quince lost some of its charm moving to a bigger location.\n\nReservations were still hard to come by.

The food was still very good and the service was smooth.  We started with a very tasty lobster salad before sharing a nice truffle pasta.

(i didn't see him again after that. i really hope he didn't get fired for that.) poor guy. \n\nmake sure you dress up a bit for your meal here. like i said, it's classy. and the only way you might feel uncomfortable is if you are dressed too casually. also, quince is expensive. they don't put 4 dollar signs up here for nothing peeps. we spent about $300 with tip, including a bottle of wine and 2 cocktails. so this is definitely your special occasion spot. unless you're rich of course. and then have at it.", "author": "rachel p."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-05-28", "description": "My fiance and I went to a celebratory dinner at Quince last night after hearing many raves from our friends. The restaurant truly lived up to all of its praise and we had an excellent meal.\n\nThe food was elegant, simple but still exciting and the service was flawless. When we first walked into the dining room i thought it looked a little big and \"hotel-y\" but our table was very comfortable and the sound management was so well done that you weren't distracted by neighboring tables. My only criticism of the design itself is that two restrooms seems hardly sufficient for a restaurant of that size. (Well that and the cheesy light fixtures, but I can get over those.)\n\nThe servers have obviously been training very hard (I guess maybe they are making a big push to get that second star?). If you love the small details of good service, you will notice plenty of them at Quince. Everything is friendly and thoughtful without being pushy or bustling. It would be difficult to stump any member of the waitstaff on anything from the food to the art around the restaurant. They even gave us some macarons to take home with us, so they have many stars in my book.\n\nWINE:\nThe wine director was very helpful and made great recommendations and the wine service was flawless. We had:\n\nNV Prosecco di Valdobbiadene, Drusian, Veneto, Italy (by the glass)\n2008 Rias Baixas Albari\u00f1o, Do Ferreiro, Galicia, Spain (half bottle)\n2001 Palladino Barolo San Bernardo Riserva (bottle)\n1983 Porto, Ramos Pinto, Portugal (shared a glass)\n\nLooking at it now that really looks like a lot, but somehow over 3 hours it didn't quite feel like it. \n\nFOOD play-by-play:\n\nThe dinner rolls were good and I liked the crispy cheese crackers. I don't think I was quite as in love with the bread as some other reviews but I did LOVE the butter, especially the unsalted goat butter (the white butter). I loved the butter so much that I made it through the entire first portion. As some others have mentioned, the second round of butter came out almost frozen (I guess maybe they wanted me to slow down on my butter consumption?).\n\nThe amuse was a salmon/caviar/cucumber dish and some sort of amazing fried deliciousness. \n\nSquash Blossom Filled With Dungeness Crab -- Delicious! The lemon balm along with this one was great.\n\nRaviolo Gigante Della Casa -- This came with five stuffed ravioli in one long strip--one was carrot, one artichoke, one egg and ricotta, one beet, and one nettle. This was one of our favorite courses and there was really something special about the intensity of the carrot one!\n\nPici Toscani -- I loved the peppery-ness of the noodles in this dish and the freshness of the peas. The noodles were fabulous. The only thing strange about this dish is that the squab seemed sort of unnecessary and pointless (there were only a few bights of it). The noodles were so good though that I didn't really care.\n\nSuckling Pig \"Tris\" -- This was suckling pig several ways--a small chop, sausage, belly, trotter, and some sort of amazing trotter/myrtle combo. The myrtle was amazing and the fava beans and scapes were delicious! The only downer was the chop. It was cute but it was sort of like chicken.\n\nCheese -- Dunbarton Blue -- This cheese was amazing! And they gave us an absolutely huge portion of it--a steak-sized portion of cheese. The pickled green almond and fennel salad it came with were also amazing (I love all things pickled).\n\nLemon-Lime Sable -- I love lemon and lime so this dessert was great for me (less so for my fiance who is not so into citrus desserts). It was a combo of panna cotta, gelee and sorbetto. I could have eaten about a pound of the panna cotta.\n\nChocolate Praline -- This was a rich and intensely chocolate dessert, much more to my fiance's taste than mine (he loves pretty much everything with chocolate and crunch).\n\nMignardise -- Came with a nougat, a gum drop, a nut bon bon type thing and a macaron. All delicous (especially the nougat and the macaron)--though I have no idea how I ate them all at this point in the meal.\n\nThe tasting menu was a great experience and I would highly recommend it. The only downside to this one was that I did feel like maybe it was missing a red meat course--no beef or lamb! Perhaps I was just jealous because the table next to me ordered a la carte and had lamb that looked absolutely delicious.", "author": "J S."}

The overall decor is very rich, with white flowing table cloths, candles lit and waiters very well dressed as were most of the customers:) \nYeah it was stuffy in there; not really my kind of scene unless its' a special occasion or something.  So they brought over the bottle of wine that my BF brought (he's a member of several wine clubs and boasted that we would all love this wine)... He was absolutly right, it was amazing. I thought the waiter should have opened the bottle in front of us so that we can watch the wine being poured into the decanter. But when they served it, the bottle was already empty. I didn't like that. Whatever, I guess it didn't matter since my BF knows that wine. \n\nThe menu was a set 4-course meal with options to choose from each course. I believe I had the Uni or sea urchin as the 1st course.  It was delicious. It's been a few weeks since we went, and now I can't remember in detail what we ate.  I just know that the portions were small but the presentation of the dishes were beautiful and exuded amazing flavor.  We all enjoyed our dinner.

We went there to celebrate our 20th anniversary. I made our reservations on Open Table and let them know that we were celebrating a big anniversary and wanted a nice table. A nice touch was that our names were printed on the menu, however reading the other Yelp reviews we saw that the chef signs menus when people are celebrating a special event.  \n\nWe ordered ala carte salads, fish for the main course, and desserts.  We overheard the waiter telling other patrons that they should order a pasta dish since that's what the chef is famous for, that that was too late for us as we had already finished the main dishes.

Vibrant, eclectic, and down right enchanting.\n\nMichael Tusk knows what he's doing, and when taking a special friend out for her Birthday, I knew this would be a real treat for both of us.\n\nI think the only way to break down this review is my course, so lets get to it.\n\nFIRST COURSE:\n\nI started off with pork belly and she had the scallops. Both were sensational. The pork belly was soft, flavorful, and made your tongue beg for more.\n\nEven better though, were her scallops. I'm not sure what the cream sauce was, but those things melted into your mouth and found a home deep in your heart. 3 genuine scallops were presented on a bed of the most decadent sauce, and I am still craving for just one more bite today.\n\nSECOND COURSE:\n\nI had one of the most fantastic pasta dishes of my life. A spaghetti with sea urchin sauce, and it was simply immaculate. What surprised me was the generous portion that was offered. The dish was perfect, and I mopped up every ounce of the delectable treat.\n\nShe had another pasta dish with a pork sauce which was also mouthwatering. A rendition of macaroni; it was delectable.\n\nTHIRD COURSE\n\nI finished off with a roasted rabbit which was juicy, and hit the perfect note of game. The loin was stuffed with borage, which gave it a perfect taste that truly highlighted the extravagant taste of the rabbit.\n\nShe had the Liberty Duck and it was cooked to perfection. Dripping in a sauce that made the already moist duck a dish that left you satisfied beyond belief.\n\nDESSERT\n\nI had the Meyer Lemon cake and she ended with the Chocolate palate. They were phenomenal. Paired with a nice dessert wine, it capped off a dinner that I will never forget.\n\n*****\n\nLet me tell you. I have been to my fair share of SF eateries and Quince stands up there with the best. \n\nWe had the pleasure of being served by Graham who made the dining experience whole. His polite demeanor and playful descriptions of the dishes let our minds dissolve the work day stress and settle into a cozy romantic spot in Pac Heights to enjoy a culinary trail.\n\nThis isn't the cheapest of places, but if you're looking for that 1 year anniversary hot spot or special occasion location, Quince should be your destination.\n\nNo questions asked.\n\nFrom the classic ambiance, to the professional staff, to a daily changing menu that highlights the best of the Bay Area, Quince is a must for anybody willing to tip toe into a culinary high.", "author": "Mike K."}

I'm a drug representative who often entertains doctors at speaker functions in local fine dining establishments.  I also have several years of personal experience in working private parties from past restaurant jobs.  My experience at Quince was underwhelming to say the least--and I was shocked at the unprofessionalism of the banquet manager, Casey. When booking a private room at Quince one must meet a minimum of $2500 and pick from a variety of items for the menu.  One might  assume that when planning a menu for said private dining event, that the banquet manager might assist in helping her guest meet this minimum.  On the contrary, I was never given any indication that I would come up nearly $900 short on this evening's tab.  I was not given a bill until the following day via email (which in itself seems sketchy--as is they were hiding the fact that I was so far under minimum).  Had I been informed that night of such a discrepancy in the bill, I would have surely ordered a lovely bottle of Chateauneuf de Pape for my guests to enjoy.  Instead, I was left astonished the next day at the difference in cost.  When speaking with Casey of this snafu, I was told that there was nothing they could do, but learn for future guests.  Well, needless to say, I will not be one of those future guests.  \nLastly, to add insult to injury, the food was only slightly above average, and I received the wrong entree.  Go figure.

We thought Quince would be the restaurant that would sadly forever sit on our \"Must try quintessential SF restaurant list.\"\n\nHowever, several days after my initial review, I was contacted by Katrina the General Manager of Quince apologizing for our experience and stating that our situation was poorly mishandled.  She wanted us to come back and give Quince another chance and would be sending us a gift certificate.  I was impressed at the quick response and the effort made on Katrina's part, but was still hesitant on returning to Quince.  Several days later, we received the gift certificate and we were completely BLOWN AWAY at the amount; we were expecting maybe at most $50 - an amount to cover a couple of drinks possibly?  She sent us a $200 GIFT CERTIFICATE.  With this grand gesture, we thought it would only be fair to give Quince another shot.\n\nThe sting from the Valentine's day debacle still lingered in our minds. Unsure of what to expect on our next visit, we put off making a reservation for 2 months, deciding to go on our 9 year anniversary (dating; we celebrate our wedding anniversary later in the summer). \n\nIT WAS A PHENOMENAL NIGHT!  The level of service we received was top-notch; everyone was friendly and not overbearing.  I felt like I was having dinner at a friend/family member's home with the high level of care we received.  We had an intimate and private meal, but at the same time, we were carefully watched over without the feeling of being watched over.  People would STEALTHILY come in at the right moment to: refill water, remove plates soon after we finished, remove empty glasses, refresh our bread plates, fold / refresh napkins when we stepped away, pull out the table for me to slide back into the booth and so on and so on - IT WAS THAT GOOD.  The one weird thing that I do have to note, for some odd reason when they refreshed the bread, my husband would receive both a roll and cheese flat bread/crackers every single time (refreshed at least 4-5 times), but I only received a roll.  Why no crackers for me?         \n\nFor the food, we both decided to go with the seafood/fish tasting menu, which consists of 5 courses and we added a couple of courses from the a la carte side of the menu.  I know...we are gluttons; I can't drink much, so I put my energy into food.  Note: the size of the tasting courses are large and should be more than enough food for everyone.  Overall, the food was good, however, there were some hits and some misses.  \n\nThe LOVES:\n\nI really enjoyed the amuse, the bread (with the goat butter - so good!), the foie terrine, the pasta dishes, the grapefruit sorbet intermezzo, kushi sorbet (came with the budino), and the petits fours.  \n\nThe MISSES:\n-scallop carpaccio and caviar: I enjoyed this, but I would have loved it if each bite didn't come with a bit of grit/sand.  I was really surprised to find this to be the case at Quince.\n\n-some dishes came out bland, some overseasoned\n\n-sea bass: overcooked\n\n-desserts: were a bit underwhelming and had some execution/flavour issues; the creme anglaise was overpowered by the alcohol/liqueor in it (and a bit too runny), the huckleberry souffle was light and had a great texture, but was lacking something to balance the berry (maybe citrus? maybe herbs?), the \"burnt honey\" budino was too delicate, lacking the burnt/caramel flavour I was expecting and the crumble below anchoring the budino was soft and doughy in texture.  \n\nOverall, I'd give the food a 4.  Misses happen even at finer establishments and I'm willing to give a restaurant a second chance if  the service and the ambiance are on point, making it a memorable experience and warranting a 5 STAR REVIEW especially with the special touches we received.\n\nSPECIAL TOUCHES:\n-Customized menu wishing us a happy anniversary and keepsake menu to take home\n\n-Surprised us with two wine pairings for our first and second courses with glasses of Sauternes and Chardonnay, respectively\n\n-Surprised us with an additional course (braised octopus), which put our total number of courses to 8 (so much food!)\n\n-Surprised us with candles on our desserts since it was a special occasion - it was very sweet. \n\nTo top it all off, at the end of the meal, our server came by and told us that everything was COMPLETELY TAKEN CARE OF and wished us a good night.  It was so GENEROUS AND UNEXPECTED; we had champagne to start, another glass of wine, coffee, and they asked if we wanted the cheese course (I was too full and was able to moan out a \"no thank you\") and after dinner drinks plus all the other additional drinks and courses.\n\nTHANK YOU, Quince, Katrina, and Michael for making our anniversary so wonderful!!  Quince has a special place in our hearts after such a memorable evening.", "author": "Miss H."}

Meaning, it was above peer restaurants and deserves about 4 stars.\n\nThe rolls, scallops, scallops, and gnocci were all amazing.  The duck was just average.\n\nService, while good, did not blow me away.  I had a reservation made well in advance for my party for 9pm .  We were seated 27 minutes late which is just a thread under the point where I would have argued for compensation on our bill.  For a 9pm reservation, I expect a table to be open and waiting for me when I walk in.\n\nTAKING PRICE INTO CONSIDERATION:  I would not come back.  I would rather try other restaurants before venturing back here.  While the food was excellent, the service was acceptable, I don't believe that for the price this is worth aspiring to visit.", "author": "Ankur P."}

Danko - Check, Jardinere - Check, Aqua - Check, Farrallon - Check, and now Quince - Check.\n\nTo be honest most of the reviews on Yelp were spot on.  The kahki clad waiters were constantly swarming, attending to our every need.  Refilling the bread basket, topping off our water, refilling our wine glasses...the four course menu was just enough.  I couldn't imagine what the 5 course chefs menu, with wine paring and the cheese board would be.  They would have to wheelbarrow me out of that place.\n\nThe space is just right, not too big, and not too small.  The size is what I think allows them to be as attentive as they are.

Who would've thought such a little gem of a restaurant would be located just across the street from where we live?  The place is very old school classy...almost too old school.  I love fine dining but I don't like places that make me feel uncomfortable.  I had a Pretty Woman moment when I couldn't remember what piece of silverware to use and panicked slightly.  Then I remembered that it was my friggin' birthday (and that I'm not an uneducated hooker) and used whatever damn piece of silverware I wanted.

One reviewer on here called the portions \"precious\"...no lie!  It was the smallest food I've ever seen.  Absolutely savory and delicious but very...little.  The food is rich (in more ways than one) so this excuses the miniscule plates, I suppose.  The wine pairings were fantastic and I absolutely adored our server...all three of them.  They definitely take care of you here!  \n\nI finally understand what all the fuss is about.  This was a great birthday present but it's not a place I can see us dining at regularly.  Not in this economy, anyway.  My boyfriend and I each had a glass of wine before dinner, enjoyed the selection of cheeses, and each had the 5 course dinner with wine pairings...~ $400.

First of all, the service cannot be beat. Our waiter and,in fact, all the wait staff was professional , warm and at the top of their game. We arrived 15 minutes late on a Friday night for our reservation. The hostess held out table but she warned us that we had to be done by 845. Since we were seated at 7 , we thought this shouldn't be a problem. We didn't leave until 930. Not because we weren't eating like maniacs to comply with the 845 deadline, but because the courses were on a very slow cruise control. we must have eaten a platter each of the bread rolls and crackers that they give out. They didn't give us any kind of attitude though and were gracious to us when we were leaving.

I felt the same way at Cotogna, though. So i wasn't surprised so much as a little sad about tit. the tortelloni though was AMAZING. The rib of beef was also a highlight.

The whole experience started off on the wrong foot when our reservation for 9pm was held up for 27 minutes (my friend counted).  We were about to get uppity, but they were able to seat us.  I myself didn't mind, as one of our friends was late and I was a bit tipsy, so in my bebop scatting mood, I let it go.\n\nIf I had to describe this meal in one word, it would be 'perfect'.  As in each and every thing I tasted was done with an exacting amount of preparation and skill to the point, at least in my mind, the dish could not be executed any better.\n\nFor my three courses, I had the scallops as appetizer, a bolognese tagliatelle, and the Alaskan cod.  The scallops were amazing.  Perfectly cooked, from a delicately seared outside Maillard could have studied for days, to the near raw inside, each layer was textbook.  The epitome of a scallop dish.\n\nThe pasta was also excellent.  Again, cooked to perfection.  I overheard someone at our table mention that Mario Batali said Quince's pasta was the best in the country.  One can see why.  Well balanced and flavorful, the tagliatelle was simply delicious.\n\nMy Alaskan cod, again, could not have been done any better.  Fish was fresh, flaky, and only lightly seasoned to let the natural flavors win out.  Actually, I didn't end up enjoying this dish as much as the others because it was too subtle and muted for my palate by this point.  Again, I had a bit to drink before dinner and the glass-plus of wine I had during may have left me craving something more intense.\n\nI found the service to be quite good, but nothing really stood out.  I guess that's a plus because you can often find yourself overwhelmed by too much attention at a restaurant like this.  Just let me eat and enjoy!\n\nSo why only 4 stars?  It really should be 4.5.  Well, the wait for one, and like I said, I think my personal choice of the cod ended up not being the best thing for me at the time.  I would go there again if I were entertaining some foodies, but it's not somewhere I would take a date; the crowd seemed a bit stuffy.\n\nAs for price, it ended up being about $100/person for 3 courses, a bottle of wine, and apparently parking as well, but I didn't notice.  Not bad for a great meal, but it certainly isn't cheap.  Once is good.\n\nReserve well in advance.  Also, if you plan on taking 8+, you have to do the private room, which requires a spend of at least $1000.  Yikes.\n\nPS:  Seriously, who rates a restaurant in 2 ways?", "author": "Zhi Q."}

With the extra courses of rich foods (9+3 courses) and wide variety of wines we both left not feeling sated, but uncomfortable and unable to walk straight.  As to wait staff, it would have been excellent but it was actually over staffed.  Every 30 seconds the numerous wait staff rotated thru the room clockwise.

The whole experience was outstanding and I am amused by the negative reviews that I read because this place could not be better.  Here are the highlights for us\nFood: we ordered the four courses.  Prior to ordering, we started with two cocktails that were made at our table and were excellent. Our waiter explained the different choices on the menu  to us providing detailed explanation about the food. We ordered different items on each course so we could share more dishes. For our first course my wife had the Nantucket Bay Scallop Crudo and I chose the smoked rainbow trout.  The scallops were delicious with grapefruit, radish, and a caper.  The rainbow trout was prepared with a pearl onion and dill and the flavors were terrific.  We also ordered the wine pairing for the whole meal and will discuss that later in the review.  For our second course my wife had Gnocchi Di Ricotta with black truffle and Broccoli DiCiccio.  The Gnocchi were like little pillows and delicious. I chose the \"Casonchelli\" which was artichoke hearts with ricotta Della Casa and Olio Verde Novella.  This was my favorite dish of the night. Great flavors and completely new for me.  For the third course my wife had striped sea bass with fennel, citrus and Puntarelle.  Again, cooked perfectly, great mix of flavors.  I chose the Suckling pig with a plum jelly, cippolini onion and black salsify.  It was presented as a chop and a small fillet, cooked to perfection, delicious with great flavor.  For our fourth course my wife had Mandarin Creme Cake with Creme Fraiche and \"teased caramel\" and I had Chocolate Dariole (like a small round piece of cake) with spiced cream, brown butter, and pumpkin ice cream.  Both were outstanding and not over the top. Additionally, they brought us a little flan with a candle for our anniversary.  Throughout the meal we were presented with several Amuse Bouch\u00e9e (sp.?) before during and even after the meal that really added to the whole experience.\n\nWine:  with the wine pairings, we were served 5 glasses of wine--1 to start, and then 1 for each course.  All were expertly paired with what we ate. The sommelier explained everything about the wine in detail and answered any questions we had.  her selections were outstanding with every course. She was extremely knowledgeable and professional and added to our enjoyment of each of the wine choices. I should mention that the wine pairing cost was $75, which was expensive for us, BUT it was a special experience that we both felt was worth doing for a special occasion.  It really enhanced a terrific meal.\n\nService: we were served by 7-8 different people and all, including the bus boy could not have been any nicer or more professional.  Every item was clearly explained in preparation and ingredients and again, added much to a great experience. The service was attentive but not hovering.  We were at the table for close to three hours and never felt rushed or as if we waited too long. The pacing was perfect. They even printed out a copy of everything we ate and drank with a Happy 40th anniversary printed on a nice card.\n\nIn summary, this was a wonderful evening that we both felt was worthwhile.  yes, it was very expensive, and not something we could do on a regular basis but we were both thrilled to experience what this outstanding restaurant had to offer.", "author": "Wayne E."}

He reserved the chef's table in the way WAY back of the restaurant.\n\nWalking in and past the kitchen I felt like Henry Hill in Goodfellas.  \n\nExcept no one gave a shit about me or even noticed that I walked by.\n\nBut I digress....\n\nThe rules are simple, you can have up to 10 people at this table, but you must commit to a minimum amount of money to spend.  Let's just say the amount is pretty high.  \n\nSo, for 10 people, a number of us brought bottles of wine to enjoy for this dinner.  Ok, I brought one cheap bottle that was taking up room in my kitchen.  Sorry Art, I am in a truthful mood this evening.  \n\nI would say there were 6 GREAT bottles of wine waiting to be imbibed brought by others at the table.\n\nExpecting a corkage, or even an increasing corkage, we were shocked to hear that the limit for the table is 2 bottles.  That's it, no questions asked.  \n\n10 people.  2 bottles of wine.\n\nThat's a little more than a half a cup per person.\n\nSo we pleaded our case.  Quince upped it to 4 bottles for the table, and increased the corkage.  \n\nThis, I appreciated.  \n\nWhat I didn't appreciate was the fact that they were SO rigid with the enforcement of this policy.  So much so that the manager kept checking on our wine and kept whispering to the waiter.  This detracted from the evening.\n\nI understand that for a table of 4, or even 6, a two bottle limit might make sense.  But for a group committed to spending a TON of money at a place, in a special setting, rules are meant to be bent if not broken.  \n\nNow for the food.  \n\nThree courses\n\nFirst was mediocre, not worth mentioning.  \n\nSecond course of braised beef filled pasta was probably the best pasta dish I have ever had.  \n\nThird course I had the ribeye.  Good stuff.\n\nDessert was a cinnamon souffle.\n\nWithout the controversy of \"Winegate 2008,\" I would have gone with 4 stars.  Not quite 5 star material.  \n\nAgain, I recommend Quince to others as this is most likely an isolated incident.\n\nPolicy.", "author": "Archie R."}

We had to wait for our table on each occasion, but it certainly wasn't unpardonable.  I don't think it exceeded 15 minutes.  There's not much the host can do about this; the restaurant is small.  If you're going to flame anyone, flame the people sitting at your table who finished their meal two hours earlier and then decided to loiter.\n\nPeople have already mentioned the art adorning the walls and the warmth of the room (both in ambiance and temperature).  I, for one, think the Murano translucent white light fixtures are beautiful in their sterility and completely transform the decor from basic SF feeding trough to something exceptional and elemental.\n\nYou don't even need to glance at the menu in order to tell that this dinner will require a couple of Franklins.  Just feel the napkin.  See the tasteful label spelling out \"F-R-E-T-T-E\" which is discreetly stitched into the corner?  \n\nI thought the service was excellent.  Our server was well-informed about the menu and took great care in explaining the more exotic dishes to our party.  The courses were also well-timed; we weren't waiting for millennia, nor were plates brusquely snatched away.\n\nThe food, in short, ranged from excellent to phenomenal.   The meal begins with an amuse-bouche, of course.  I highly recommend all of the pasta dishes, even though they are technically second courses.  I will probably opt for multiple second courses in lieu of the third course on the next occasion.  The steak (on occasion #1) and the veal (on occasion #2) were excellent, but the dishes weren't outstanding.  The wine cellar is well-edited though rather small -- in fact, part of the cellar is adjacent to the restroom, which is slightly distasteful.\n\nI rate Quince at four and a half stars, but will round down instead of up because my expectations of a restaurant increase in tandem with the cost.

The staff tolerated and worked with my mania for days beforehand to get it just right, printing special menus, helping me pre-select great champagne, and even let me put flowers on the table.\n\nMy Italian grandmother's been hand-making her pasta for 90 years now and I'd venture to say Quince's is just about as good (no one can beat the Grams).  They have an extensive, eclectic winelist that even had Montefalco Rosso, a pretty tough, pretty obscure wine that i love that's next to impossible to track down.\n\nThe staff is always there when you need them and and never there when you don't.  They are polite without being phony, and give spot-on recommendations when you ask.  As one who worked in a five-star restaurant for a long time, I usually notice the little things...crumbing properly, not back-handing when serving, a competent clear.  And our waitress did all of this flawlessly.\n\nBeautiful, sparingly decorated interior.  Great piano the night we were there.  And the manager came over toward the end to make sure everything had gone just right.\n\nOnly thing I'd change is wasting that much money and time on a girl who turned out to be such a fake.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2006-06-05", "description": "Where, oh where, to begin?\r\n\r\nWe arrived a few minutes before our 8pm reservation, and were asked to wait... in the doorway. The hostess apologized multiple times (to the point where I finally told her to stop) and brought us a wine list. But still, we're standing in the doorway -- there's no bar, no waiting area, not even a chair to perch on. We ended up getting seated about 15 minutes after 8, and summarily ignored by our server for another 10 minutes. Adding to all the fun, we were seated millimeters away from a boistrous table of two couples in their late 40s, bragging about their european second homes and the new-college-grad offspring they were intent upon supporting because \"there's no need to torture them\" with hourly-wage work. (roll eyes)\r\n\r\nThe food was... well, not up to the hype. There were a lot of pristine ingredients, and a lot of pretty plating techniques, but not a whole lot of interesting tastes happening. \r\n\r\nFirst courses: The asparagus and deep-fried egg starter was lovely, but nothing that anyone with access to good produce couldn't accomplish at home. And frankly, it needed salt. My husband's pig-foot salad was more like two mini crabcakes with a garnish of leaves around the band of the plate -- it had nothing of the lip-smacking, porky, gelatinous beauty of the trotter about it, and the sauce was underwhelming. (And no, I don't mean \"subtle\".) And, I'm sorry -- I appreciate the idea of variations on a theme -- but something described as a \"salad\" on the menu should have some vegetable matter on the plate other than parsley.\r\n\r\nPasta course: My spaghetti amatriciana was my favorite part of the dinner, but it was so sloppily presented -- especially compared to our first courses and other plates I'd seen go by -- that I couldn't help but wonder how it got smacked into the bowl. Served on a lukewarm plate, slightly undercooked and tepid spaghetti was topped with a lovely sauce of tomato, guanciale and red peppers... it made me want nothing more than a real bowl full of it, with a side of bread and a big jug of chianti. My husband's papardelle with quail was also too al dente, and oversalted to the point of being practically inedible (and we love salt, trust me).\r\n\r\nFor my main, I had a hard time choosing something that sounded appealing. There were no pork options, and no beef, either. Not wanting to wimp out and order the chicken, and not liking the sound of any of the seafood, I opted for the rack of veal. It arrived pre-sliced (arrrrgh!), slopped onto the plate looking like someone's leftovers, and garnished with one raggedy bone from the rack! And, once again, cold plate, lukewarm food. It was also noticably -under- salted, just like my appetizer. (Can't someone figure out how to season back there??) The accompanying potato \"gratinata\" was closer to the mark, but rather grainy and chalky. My husband's sweetbreads were overdone, and nothing to write home about.\r\n\r\nBy the time we got to dessert, there was a pileup of people waiting to be seated, at least a dozen people crammed into the doorway and hovering over the short glass partition in front of our table. Some of them had been waiting for 30-45 minutes by the time they took their seats, and were visibly peeved. Making people wait? OK. Making people wait without a place to sit or stay out of the way? Possible...but borderline. Making people wait for 45 minutes without a place to sit at a high-end place? Unforgivable! \r\n\r\nOh, and did I mention that it's SO LOUD in there that we literally couldn't hear one another across a very small two-top?\r\n\r\nNot really satisfied by our dinners, we glanced at the dessert menu. I opted for the meyer lemon tartlet with raspberries, and my husband ordered the profiteroles. My dessert looked lovely, but featured an inedibly bitter and burnt crust, amatuerish lemon curd, and disgustigly underripe berries. (I spit out the first bite into my napkin, and nobody ever asked me if anything was amiss.)  Mr. C's profiteroles came with a layered terrine slice of three gelati -- a delightful cacao-nib flavor and two other forgettable riffs on chocolate. Unfortunately, the profiteroles themselves were no great shakes, and the cherries were so flacid that they weren't worth eating.\r\n\r\nService was bizarre, starting with the hyper-apologetic hostess, and continuing through the nervous-tic rearranging of glasses and silver by the manager (stop touching my tableware!), and our server's spokesmodel-like flourishes when presenting wine bottles for approval.\r\n\r\nPrice for all this was $320 (including tax and tip) for 4 courses, plus 2 stems of prosecco, a half bottle of french Rose and another half of Merry Edwards Pinot Noir. \r\n\r\nThe food was generally tasty, and the level of execution would have been fine -- even remarkable -- at a neighborhood restaurant. But at these prices, food should be uniformly lovely, interestingly prepared, and properly seasoned. We definitely won't be going back for another round.", "author": "anita c."}

Intimate and elegant room, caring servers, sublimely simple, utmostly seasonal food.  It is my favorite restaurant in the city, and will be yours if you follow a few guidelines:\n\n1) Don't pass up the starters.  They are perfect distillations of the flavors they represent.  A tomato will be a perfect tomato.  A white bean will be the white bean by which to judge all others.  Etc.\n\n2) Order way more pasta than you think you can handle.  My date and I once knocked back five courses.  This pasta is transcendent.  Standouts are the ephemeral ricotta raviolo with brown butter (always on the menu - use the bread to sop up the sauce) and anything filled. \n\n3) You will be pretty full from all of this crazy delicious pasta.   So order one fish entree to split.  Fish dishes are consistently excellent.  Meat dishes are not.  The meat entrees just read better than they taste - I've had overdone, dry, salty.  Stick with the fish and you will be wowed.\n\n4) Pass on dessert.  Again, they read better than they taste, and are meager.  Dessert should be lavish and indulgent!

Alas the sqaush was so terribly bitter that I couldnt get past the second bite. I sent it back and requested for a roasted bell pepper SFormatto. Very tasty, but the portion was so atrociously tiny that I finished it in 2 scoops. My husband did not fare much better as he looked at his thinly sliced pear and tuna salad. Two scoops and was done.\n\nMain course - My Spaghettini was again a ridiculously small portion and was nothing great. Spaghetti with steamed cauliflower and olive oil is not praise worthy. Period. I make it better at home. My husband  fared slightly better with his gnocchi (2nd course) and lobster (3rd course) but alas two tea spoons was all that he was served making us feel like Oliver Twist waiting for more.

They open the doors for you when you go to the bathroom (do remember however that you must lock them yourself - I found that out the hard way). They fold your napkin again if you get up to go to said bathroom. They move your table over if they see that you are feeling a bit too squished. They are attentive.

Well atmosphere and unfortunately the service is just the service that's the only virtue of this quaint little spot. Fortunately my parents enjoyed the experience and found it relaxing.

I don't care about these catchy little phrases that USUALLY attract devoted foodies like myself who's eyes are so filled with dreams of things like cheese and cake that they can easily get duped by marketing.

I have never even noticed noodles before, let alone the possibility that they could be bad until I came here.\n\nI got a dish with octopus which apparently had been massaged to make it more tender. It came out as a flattened circle. For all I knew it could have been tofu cubes. It was not tender and the sauce it was served in was spicy and tasted like it came out of a jar from the supper market.\n\nOur meat was ok. My squab was the most noteable, swimming in a flavorful sauce, but the meat wasn't tender enough for something that costs that much (around $30).\n\nAll and all, the food was REALLY bad, but fortunately my parents said it didn't matter since the atmosphere was so relaxing, something of a gem in SF I guess.

But I digress.\n\nLast night found a group of four friends at Quince and what an evening it was.\n\nWhat was amusing is that Ryan had us going for a week...thinking we were going to go to Gary Danko (all he told us was that it was a Michelin rated restaurant)....he's so sneaky!\n\nQuince didn't disappoint, though.\n\nOur reservation was at 9pm and I walked in the door right at 9pm to find my friends already seated.  Prompt seating plus being seated by a waiter passing by, +1 star. The decor is simply and elegant.  This is a very small restaurant, so I imagine getting reservations here takes some time. The lighting is very low and I thought how difficult it must be for people with bad eyes to read the menu!  No sooner did I say something that we saw a waiter walk by with a flashlight for a patron.\n\nWe were presented with the menus for the evening, as well as a tasting menu ($90/person).  While the tasting menu looked exquisite, we were disappointed that there was only one choice of dessert on the tasting menu, so we opted to order from the regular menu.\n\nAfter ordering came the first piece de resistance (damn Yelp for not allowing accent marks!), the bread plate.  Now, most people would think bread is bread, right?  No...it is not.  This bread is sinfully delicious...and it's never ending!  They keep bringing it out.  You could dine JUST on bread at this restaurant and walk out satisfied, that is how good it is.  There are three selections - cheesy bread sticks, wedge like cracker bread and the best, a garlicy, fennel juicy roll.  It's like a sausage roll without the meat.  UH-MAZING.\n\nI started with the corn soup.  It was simple and delicious.  Not thick like a corn chowder, just perfect..a nice start to a chilly evening.  My second course was the Ravioli di ricotta - a giant ravioli filled with ricotta cheese cooked in browned butter and topped with an egg yolk.  It literally melted in my mouth...all my dinner companions had a taste and were amazed at how delicious this was.  I could've floated out of the restaurant at that point.  My main course was sole (I believe petrale sole, but not 100% certain) that was crispy on the outside, delisciously moist and tender on the inside, served with corn and greens.\n\nFor dessert I had the strawberry vol au vent (puffed pastry) served with lemon custard and chantilly cream (think very good whipped cream).  It was also served with a small amount of strawberry sorbet.  It was light and sweet - the perfect dessert after such an intense meal.\n\nWe stayed until they closed and had such a wonderful evening visiting.  It's not too loud in there, so it's nice to be able to chat without having to talk over people.\n\nMy minus one star may not be deserved to some.  At one point I asked our server if I could get a diet coke and she gave me a tight grin and said, \"we don't serve those drinks here...we have either a lemon or orange soda (arnaciata)\".

As soon as we walked in the door, I smelled what can only be described as eau de garbage.  As we approached our table, this was replaced by a really strong fresh paint smell.  Distracting.

Once again, not much can be said that hasn't been said already in all the previous reviews.  However, have I ever passed up a chance to rant & rave?  Never!\r\n\r\nQuince is my idea of the perfect restaurant.  And as far as I'm concerned (next to Chez Panisse) is the best that San Francisco has to offer.\r\nFirst off, the location is perfection.  Situated on the corner of Octavia/Bush (in Pac Heights), this is the perfect place for an unassuming little restaurant.  Not to mention, it's one of the few really great places to eat in this area (which frankly surprises me).\r\nThe valet parking upon arrival is wonderful (especially when you're running late).  And the hostesses have always been nothing but sweet, accommodating and helpful when trying to make reservations (which can be hard to come by on short notice).\r\n\r\nSecondary to the food, the service is the highlight of my trips to Quince.  The waiters are always aware of the dishes, the ingredients, where they get the ingredients from, the wines, food/wine pairing, etc.  It really feels that they hand select the waitstaff, which is really the only reason that I will pay the otherwise outrageous prices for their food.\r\n\r\nAhhhh, speaking of the food.  Impeccable in every way.  Presentation is stellar.  The ingredients are all fresh (in that \"everything is organic/sustainable/Alice Waters kind of way).  The menu is creative without being too over the top.  \r\nI always go for the artichoke appetizer and/or salad along with any of their pasta dishes, followed by a fish main course (their halibut is always delicious).  \r\nDon't event get me started on the desserts.  I try to save room for them, but end up either taking one home or sharing with my dining buddies.  Either way, they're a treat - don't leave without one!\r\n\r\nThe restaurant itself is quaint, clean and modern without feeling stuffy.  It does get rather loud since the space is so small, but I would still consider this a very nice, romantic place to go for a date, anniversary, birthday, etc.  In fact, I would come here for ANY occasion.\r\nYes, this is an expensive restaurant, but I don't think you can dock the place stars for being expensive...it's worth every penny.", "author": "Stephanie W."}

They had reserved the Chef's Table at Quince, which, at minimum, the bill had to be $1000 or so.  There were 10 in our party and I would say that would be the maximum # of people who can dine comfortably there.\n\nThe table is down in the kitchen so it was pretty great to be led to the back and to dine away from the regular patrons.  We're not the Quince type.  We don't live in Pac Heights, own cars or have 6 figure salaries.  We need to be secluded from the rest of the diners for our dinner conversation topics alone.\n\nThe tasting menu put together for the table looked excellent  but we decided to order off the regular menu as not eveyrone at the table could agree on if we wanted the tasting or not.\n\nThe restaurant started us all off with a little taste, a perfectly presented shot glass of gazpacho with a small round breaded ball of anchovie.  While I dislike both items most of the time, put together and done correctly, both were excellent.\n\nI started with the basil cous cous, shrimp, golden tomato -  Refreshing.  A great and light starter.\n \nI followed with the cheeese and honey tortoloni -  This dish seemes a bit heavy for a second course.  I know, I know, you see honey and cheese and you kinda have to expect heavy.  The tortoloni was stuffed with a mild tasting gooey cheese which I did not expect.  I had thought the filling would be lighter.  There were also a decent # of tortoloni on the plate and looked heartier then the rest of the pasta courses my friends had ordered.  The combination of the cheese and honey was pretty good, but maybe in a smaller quantity, or maybe if this was going to be my main course.\n\nI had also tried the Lobster & Fava Bean Raviolo and that was by far my favorite pasta dish.  The Chitarra ran a close second. (Yes, we did manage to avoid all bad Thundercat jokes, but the reason why it was perfect that we were not seated upstairs was that I knew we all thought about it.)\n\nI continued with the Flat Iron Steak as my third course.  This. Was. Excellent.  It was simple, the spinach was fresh, the 2 little fried cauliflower puree balls were great and of course the beef was cooked to perfection. \n\nThe only fault to this decision was my heavy second course.  Follow cheese and honey with beef and you're crying because you want dessert but you know you may burst at the seams. This is my ordering fault, and no one elses.\n\nBut I'm a trooper.  \n\nSo of course I got dessert.\n\nThe warm honey madelines with cardamon gelato and hot chocolate (poured over the gelato) was a great combination of flavors.  I did longingly look at my friend's Dark Chocolate Terrine and covet it with a passion of a thousand hot suns, but...there would be no way I could do a third decadent, heavy heavy item.  \n\nI topped it all off with a white darjeeling tea, served in the most precious glass tea set.  \n\nThe wine list was impressive and we managed to find a couple of bottles that would fit the budget of most of us at the table.\n\nFiguring out the bill at the end of this 4 hour tour de force, was a bit more challenging.  \n\nI am 31.  I make decent money in San Francisco.  Not excellent money.  Not Pac Heights kinda money. I brown bag my lunch, I belong to an expensive gym and I ocassionally have a hard time making a paycheck last as long as it should, but I can appreciate some of the finer things in life.\n\nWe're all still at that age where we're not rolling in it, but neither are we desolate.  \n\nIt's best if you pay the $1700.00 bill quickly and effortlessly and gawk about it at home...and not at the Chef's Table in front of the staff.", "author": "Jen I."}

It offered some of the most intriguing food combinations and I, naturally, wanted to try it all.  \n\nThe dinner started beautifully with a very fresh Japanese Octopus, grilled and seasoned to perfection.  Sweetbreads that followed were soft and juicy, but lacking flavor.  For the main course, we had lamb and squad, both of which were lacking focus when it comes to taste.  \n\nThe waiter even barely announced the dishes while placing it on our table, so all I heard was \"La\" and  \"Squa\".  Confused and before I could even say \"Thank you\" he vanished, as if he knew that I was just about to announce that he gets an F for his oral dish presentation.  Both plates were barely warm.  Lamb was tender but flavorless, the ingredients paired with it felt like an afterthought, rather than a well thought-out complementary duet.  \n\nAnd the squab...  The squab came with a little surprise - squab's HEAD!  Just laying there, among its' other grilled parts...  almost saying hello...  With its' little beak and hazel eyes...  Perhaps there is a Nuevo culinary movement that I am not aware of or maybe it was a delightful attempt to drive you to the vegetarianism - either way, we were not ready for it.  It literally stopped me in my tracks, which explains my attempt to hide it with the nearby and readily available carrots.  \n\nPanna cotta - the final frontier...  Most of the time, I would opt for a cheese platter, unless I see my beloved panna cotta on the menu, which was the case.  It arrived radiating with bright red colors, which made it ever so appetizing.  \n\nTasting it took my breath away, literally... and not in a sexy Top Gun/Berlin kind of way.  It was buried under grapefruit gello, fresh grapefruit chucks, shaved mango (I think) ice and mango sorbet.  It would have been a wonderful pallet cleanser after any course, but completely conflicting and offending my panna cotta.   \n\nIt took me some time to scrape it all off, after which I was left with a bright red pile of melting things on my plate, which incidentally, would have been a perfect material I would of loved to have 20 minutes ago...  to hide our friend...  but maybe it takes two visits to be that creative...", "author": "Tati K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-05-07", "description": "I normally don't write restaurant reviews, but I find myself unable to stop thinking about my experience last weekend at Quince.\n\nI went last Saturday with my girlfriend for her birthday. Once we walked in, we were impressed. To start off with, the space inside quince is beautiful. Small, intimate, modern, classy, romantic. The server was a bit slow to take our order initially, but once we got going, service was impeccable and professional.\n\nThe magic truly started when the food arrived. We ordered 3 pasta dishes and one entree to share between two of us. Pasta is my first love, and I have pasta at almost every opportunity I get, so I was excited to try out pastas as Quince. Our first dish was a ravioli with six different fillings (2 kinds of cheeses, spinach, 2 kinds of beets, fava beans). The pasta itself was very delicate yet not too soft. Each of the fillings was extraordinarily flavorful yet still very light and pleasant. To top it off, there was a wonderful cheese sprinkled around the ravioli. It was by far the best ravioli I've ever had. My favorite was the ravioli filled with the fava bean puree - truly a statement since I generally do not like fava beans. For a restaurant to be able to turn something I don't like into something I do is quite rare and has only happened a couple times in my life.\n\nThe next pasta dish was their gnocchi. Possibly the best gnocchi I've ever had (despite what you might think, I almost never use such superlatives - but Quince really deserves it) - the texture of the gnocchi was perfectly chewy, moist, and tender, yet not mushy in any way. The sauce the gnocchi was in a nice and simple (not too heavy) cream sauce which was very pleasant.\n\nFinally, we had agnolotti stuffed with veal, chicken and rabbit. Again - the pasta was tender and extraordinarily well done. The stuffing was flavorful and complex - you could taste each of the meats, even though they were all combined together.\n\nAfter my blissful experience with the three pasta dishes, the rest of the night I was deliriously happy. They could have been very average the rest of the night and still had me raving about them. Despite this, I was still very impressed by our entree - we had a tai snapper with artichoke, artichoke puree, and artichoke chips, sitting in olive oil, with fresh peas on the side. The thai snapper was very well done - crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. The peas seem as if they were fresh from the garden and very tasty, and the olive oil was a very nice compliment to the artichoke and snapper.\n\nFinally, for dessert we had a \"strawberry floating island\" - strawberries in a sweet cream with a beautiful sugar-spun decoration on top. This dish shone more in its presentation and its novelty, but the strawberries were fresh and sweet.\n\nIt was also the nice little touches that really pushed this restaurant to the top of my list - from a birthday greeting printed on the menu, to three different waiters wishing my girlfriend happy birthday, to speedy, helpful service, to having my car already ready for me outside after my meal (they had told the valets we were ready to go after we paid, I'm guessing). They made a special occasion even more special.\n\nThe meal was reasonably priced for the quality - it was around $120 for the two of us.  \n\nI've been to Incanto, Delfina, Perbacco, etc... many of the top Italian-y restaurants in the city. This tops them all.", "author": "Gemmy T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-09-08", "description": "So some of my girlfriends and I work in Food for a pretty well-known company from the Sonoma area.  We figured it our duty to dine there (and I do mean Dine -- not Eat) when one of our colleagues, who used to be a chef at Danko, said that it was his absolute favorite restaurant in the city.\n\nStrangely enough, the night before we were going for dinner, one of our party happened to be at A16 and met a sommelier who recently started at Quince.  This was the icing on the cake, as we knew we would be treated to some amazing wines.  \n\nWe made an early reservation (6:00pm -- Straight from work), and got there only very slightly early.  The door was opened for us, our table was ready right away and our chairs were pulled out for us.  You don't even notice the wait staff.  They sort of breeze by, and appear at the side of your table ready to help you with the menu.  We ordered a bottle of white.  Amazing.  Noise level increased throughout the night, which was a great disguise to our constant laughter and dirty jokes.... \n\nDelicious cheese bread balls appeared on table, and didn't stop coming throughout the whole meal, without a word ever being spoken.  \n\nBeing accustomed to tastings, the four of us decided to share everything.  We order 4 starters.  3 Pastas.  And 1 Main.  \n\n- Tomato and Bread Soup\n- Sea Scallops and Shrimp wrapped in Squash Flower\n- Fried Petrale Sole with Aioli\n- A Gorgonzola and Egg Tart with Beets and Yellow Haricot Vert\n\nYumm, Yummy, Yumm.\n\n- Nettle gnocchi with Pork Cheek \n- Little pasta (for lack of the Italian term) filled with creamy cauliflower\n- Popes Hats filled with rabbit, veal and pork\n\nWowsa.  Another bottle of wine.  Red.  Delicious.\n\n- Black Sea Bass with Peppers\n\nYes!  We like it.\n\nThen there was dessert....\n\n- Chocolate Cinnamon Pot De Creme with Orange Caramel Bon Bons.\n- Strawberry Tartlett with Purple Basil Ice Cream.  \n\nOh yea.  Bring it home. \n\nFine dining at it's most  pristine, romantic and best.  This small dining room is near impossible to get a reservation for, so call in advance.  Way in advance.  Don't skip a course.  They are each amazing.  The menu changes daily, and will have you swimming in cream, aged vinegars and amazing cheeses.  Our meal took just under 3 hours.  So go prepared to lavish in your food's glory for awhile.\n\nNot 5 Stars just cause.  It's pretty delicious, but it puts a sizable dent in your wallet.  Have someone with more money than you take you.  And then start with champagne and order 3 bottles of wine.  It might have been 5 stars if we were drunker when we left.", "author": "Rachel G."}

I had to call more than 7 times for a reservation just to get in once. Coincidentally, Sunday nights are the best time to go, as walk-in tables are not that uncommon.\n\nOur worst experience was when we were running 15 min late, called the restaurant in advance to let them know we were stuck in traffic. When we showed up, they already gave our table to a walk-in because we showed up \"16 min late\" (meaning we were past their 15 min limit) despite our call to report our slight delay. Once we complained, they had the audacity to actually keep us waiting and seat the next walk-in customer, at which point we just left the restaurant. It's just not worth getting treated so badly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-12-03", "description": "Everything. Was. Perfect.\n\nI might even call this restaurant high-end Californian cuisine with heavy Italian influence and moderate French influence.  I think that many publications describe it more as locally-sourced Italian cuisine with French tastes.\n\nWe were a group of four, probably the youngest group there, but it didn't feel uncomfortable at all.  It was late Sunday night; we didn't have any wine, wanted to share many of our plates, ordered plates not even on the menu, and the bill was very affordable.  Yet our server's demeanor was completely accomodating and unpretentious, as many other reviews have noted.\n\nHow could a $$$$ restaurant be affordable?  Two first courses, four second courses, two third courses, and two desserts = a perfect personalized tasting menu for four, and on the lower side of the four dollar signs.\n\nDespite the limited floor space, Quince did not make like many other \"intimate\" restaurants and cram tables together.  This is a very neatly laid-out romantic little restaurant so I'm sure you couples out there will appreciate this.  You can hear the people in your party, but not the table next to you.  You can hear yourself think.  And oh, the thoughts you will have will be quite good when you taste the pasta.\n\nIf you love freshly-made pasta, you should definitely try and make it here.  Let me put it this way:  I have a friend, Paulie, a true blue Italian New Yorker, who for a dinner party will come rolling in with a medium-sized suitcase full of tools and ingredients, clamp the pasta cranker to the counter, and make each and every component of his pasta dishes by hand.  The stuff he turns out is amazing.  If he came to San Francisco, I would JUMP to make a reservation at Quince for him just to show off our city.\n\nAnd jump you should, as the book is full far in advance, and I understand why cancellations are rare.\n\nI won't recommend any dishes as they change often - none of what we had is on the website's most recent sample menu - but I will describe one:  the first dessert, a chocolate pot de creme (sounds pretty predictable, but keep reading if you please) was accompanied by two bouchons with warm dark chocolate inside, and was covered with a not-too-thick, not-too-sweet zabaglione and topped with crumbled cookies.  These crumbled cookies were a perfect contrast to the creme - they had been broken and then cooked in a light sugar sauce for a glass-like crispy exterior and a slightly chewy interior.  That, layered into a spoonful of rich chocolate creme and a silk lining of zabaglione...", "author": "Jen X."}

So I was sad when they brought my pasta over, and it looked like someone had already eaten half the dish. =( The desserts weren't mindblowing either...\n\nThe quality of food at this place was excellent. The pasta tasted incredibly fresh, and handmade. Texture was perfect. The bread served at the table is incredible and unique. They seemed to have been dipped in olive oil, then flash fried. Each bite was crispy and flavorful...sooo good. Because of the amount of bread we ate, the small entrees were decent. \n\nBy far the best service in SF. My purse dropped on the ground, and immediately, a waiter swooped down and picked it up. When I stood up to look for the bathroom, another waiter came by, walked me to the bathroom, and opened the bathroom door for me. Our glasses were always full of water, and each time the bread plate seemed to be nearing the end, they came by with another plate of delicious bread. Bravo!", "author": "Carol L."}

But, they also miss a bit. \n\nLets start with service: The service was good. That is to say, very professional, they did not intrude on our conversation to ask how things were, and the sommelier was quite knowledgable (and had a great wine list to work with). They did nice little things, like add the valet tab to the bill, and have our coats ready when we left. About the only major gaff was delivering my dessert while I was still eating the cheese. I felt compelled to rush as I watched the ice cream melt on my pear ginger cake. There was also a minor issue (and it is so common that I think most people think this actually is good service) was the continual long description of each plate as it was delivered. Really, you DO NOT NEED TO DO THIS. I am an adult, I can read a menu, and I really hate watching my food get cold while the waiter describes all the different dishes that have been served. How about just asking, would you like me to describe your dishes?\n\nThe food: Started off great. We elected the Prix Fix menu -- I am soooo tired of the tasting menus when I wand dinner! The appetizers were very good, though the lobster bisque (actually a veloute) was so small as to be an amuse bouche.  The pasta course was excellent, I though the raw sea urchin tongue on spaghetti was spectacular - EXCEPT, the spaghetti was underdone - no excuse for that. \n\nThe main course was more mixed, the lamb was very good, but the John Dory was heavier (too much cream) than needed and overly salty. It is hard to salt fish correctly, but for $95, they should be able to get that part right. The cash also just did not ease all that fresh, or maybe they just overcooked it. In any case, Tom Colicchio would never have accepted this on Top Chef.\n\nDeserts were better than average, other than the poor timing in the delivery of mine.\n\nOtherwise, all-in-all an above average meal in a lovely room with better than average service.", "author": "R D P."}

Perhaps I was expecting too much.  I had a white shrimp app, and then some pasta filled with rabbit and sausage that I will dream about for a long long time.  Scallops for a third course that were good but I would have been fine without it - was wishing I instead just had a bit more pasta.  The other diners seemed to agree about the pastas being the winners here.  The one other thing I'll note is the bread - several types are served and all are good, but get your hands on the greasy round one.  They make these little guys fresh daily.  Filled with roasted garlic and brushed with olive oil, (I'm guessing) biting into it was like biting into a little piece of heaven.  We all asked for more.  \n\nOverall, some amazing standouts, but very pricey, pretty stuffy and conservative, and not worth the battle for a reservation.", "author": "Brad C."}

I barely noticed our servers, every time I looked down, my wine was full and a new meal or new place setting was there, no annoying Debbie coming over every three minutes to bother us.

I have consistently been surprised by everything: food, service, friendliness, setting, selection. There was only one time I can remember (out of about six) that one dish was sent back for being over salted, which was the chicken. I eat out a lot and Quince has everything I want to deserve and more. The wait staff is so completely knowledgeable and professional they must all have been to some type of training. I just cannot say enough about how good the service is at Quince. Once my father (hard of hearing) asked about where an item was from. Seeing that he really faked hearing, the server wrote it down for him and slipped him a note. They really take good care of you and understand you could eat anywhere or stay home, so they make it a special experience so you will come back.\n\nMy Italian is rusty but one appetizer you really should try is a single ravioli filled with cheese and I think a small egg, with a (I think) truffle sauce. Also, the cuttle fish entree was sublime. I mean I felt something like proudness or love while eating it. I don't normally go this emotional on food but my god man...perfect, and beautifully served, too.\n\nYes, it's expensive but for once in this city, it's actually worth it. I would go here over Danko or FdL.

Fabulous food and was hoping that Quince would do the same.\n.... QUINCE CERTAINLY PROVED ITSELF!\n\nThe Italian inspired menu is fabulous  Our lovely waiter Tim B., took the time to explain and define all the goods as the menu is very complex... but for a very good reason!\n\nEach course was superb, well-balanced, and well-proportioned.  \n\nFor the first course, we started with the Monterey Abalone and Scallops.\nSecond course, the Casoncelli alla bergamasco and the Lobster Gnocchi. \nThird course, the Four story hill farm poularde and sweetbreads (very rich and YUMMY!) and the Five dot ranch beef.\nAnd for dessert.... we had the Rhubarb cheesecake and Huckleberry souffle.\n\nPERRRRFECT meal!\n\nQuince's atmosphere is most certainly upscale, but their staff is extremely thoughtful and courteous.  This is VERY different from many upscale stuffy restaurants in the city.   (They actually have real, sincere conversations! --not the kind of restaurant where the wait staff will chit chat to try and make an extra buck!)  Another above and beyond note...We were initially sat near the front door.  Unsolicited, Tim B was kind enough to proactively move us to a table with less of a draft.  \n\nGreat food, great wine, great service--DEFINITELY AN EXCEPTIONAL DINING EXPERIENCE.\n\nThanks again!\n\nPS.

Such happy, memorable years so far :-)  For such a major occasion, we needed to celebrate it at a place that would satisfy our mutual love of food, and Quince fit the bill nicely.    But before we even got to the food, we were already impressed with the service, such warmth from everyone that did not feel forced.  \n\nThen, the bread and butter came... we would have been happy just having the flatbread and the butter from Vermont!!  Alas, we have to stop and save room for the 4 courses that were about to arrive.  But then came the amuse bouche of 4 different bites and a shot of soup, all perfectly executed.  The first course i had was squash blossoms with baby squid.  From another restaurant, it would have been just fine.  But coming from here, the flavor tasted rather pedestrian.  My 2nd course, the tortelloni with taleggio cheese was a standout!  The cheese in the pasta was initially very subtle but grew more pronounced as I chew those precious rings.  What a delectable dish!  We were also surprised with a ravioli like pasta dish consisting of 5 different stuffing in different sections of the dough.  So playful and so much fun to eat :-)  My least favorite dish of the evening was, unfortunately, the 3rd, or main, course.  I ordered the lamb that seemed to have been basted with smoked olives.  While the meat was cooked to perfection, the olives left a bitter aftertaste.  My partner ended up eating most of it and I had most of her duck, so tender and moist.  Probably my favorite dish of the evening!  Last was the milk chocolate semifeddo, a perfect way to end this special evening!", "author": "Yvette F."}

We were a party of five with a 9pm reservation.  The evening was one of the most underwhelming dining experiences of any type that I have ever had.  \n\nWe arrived on time and waited for about 15-20 minutes for our table.  Upon being seated, we were asked no less than six times, twice by the same server, if we would like to have our bottle of champagne opened which I had brought with me.  Eventually, I got the message:  for whatever reason servers wanted to get the bottle off their hands and on our table.  So I obliged them and had them open the bottle while two of the people at our table were simultaneously drinking cocktails, and I was drinking a glass of sherry (an exacting 2.5 oz pour of manzanilla, at that). \n\nAway from wine service quibbles, the service overall, in tone, style, and sheer staff size, was overly formal, stilted, overzealous, and overall...uncomfortable.  We opted for an appetizer and pasta course each, which very clearly was not an appropriate amount of food for most people.  This perhaps could have been gently pointed out by staff.  That aside, the quality of the food wavered from ok to very good.  I did not try the squash blossoms. The Dungeness crab dish was fine, no individual or combined flavors that stood out in any way.  My agnolotti stuffed with different meats and served with a butter sauce was very tasty, though the cheese grated on top was not parmeggiano reggiano but rather Grana padano.   No big deal, but not as advertised nonetheless.  It was small even by primi standards.  My poor brother, though, received three medium sized stuffed pieces of pasta (fagotelli) on his plate.  Six bites of food, pasta no less, for $19.  I was reminded of the minuscule portion on Steve Martin's plate in LA Story.  Others ordered tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms - a very plain, boring dish lacking in flavor and seasoning.   Our accompanying wine which we ordered off the list, a 2007 De Forville Nebbiolo, was quite good and well priced at $40, much, much more so than the food or the overall dining experience.", "author": "joe m."}

To make up for it they offered me another course of something else but I knew I was getting his dessert so I was fine.  They were more than accomodating.  The whole time we were there, which was almost 4 hours, Beauty and the Beast's Be our Guest was running through my head!

Everything was impeccable, from the decor to the food to the service. From beginning to end, it was a delicious, memorable meal. \nThe highlight of Quince was definitely the food. I'd recommend making sure you have time to enjoy a long meal, because the portions are designed so that everyone can enjoy an appetizer, pasta course, entree, and dessert comfortably. Our meal began with a complementary chanterelle mushroom soup - it was light and flavorful. I often find that when the amuse bouche is a soup, I am left wanting more - but this was a generous portion that still left us with plenty of room for what was to come! The star course was the pasta selection. We shared the tortelloni with ricotta, honey, and walnuts and the chestnut tagliatelle. The tortelloni was rich and creamy and contrasted wonderfully with the sweet crunchiness of the honey and walnuts. The tagliatelle was enormously flavorful, I could have eaten a pot full. For entrees, we had the sea bass and the lamb. Both were perfectly cooked and delicious - although, to be honest, it would probably be worthwhile to skip entrees entirely and just eat your way through all of the pasta options. \nI definitely recommend sampling from the large selection of cheeses. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and happy to spend time tableside telling us about the characteristics of each cheese and offering recommendations. As a serious cheese lover, I was duly impressed to find varieties of cheese that I had never heard of! As an out-of-town visitor, I really appreciated the large selection of locally-sourced cheeses and the waiters knowledge of the provenance of all of the selections. \nThe restaurant itself is beautiful and the service is friendly and attentive without being overbearing. As a side note for families with children, there were several children (ages 7+ by my guess) in the dining room while I was there for an early dinner. I got the impression that the restaurant is happy to have well-behaved children - which these budding foodies certainly were! \nIf you are visiting San Francisco, this should definitely be on your list - and if you live there, I envy you!

I was nervously telling my dining partners how nice their foods are.(Of course, since I knew they were paying.) So my sense of taste may not have been as fair as usual, but I decided to give 4 stars for the following reasons. \n\n- Even though Quince was an upscale French restaurant, the place was small and noisy. Excuse me for my bad listening skill, but I could barely hear the waiter speaking of today's special. (I had to stop the urge to say \"Me Japanese! Me no hear English!!\")  Maybe we got unlucky. We had a table in the middle of the restaurant near the door that waiters were walking out from the kitchen. I felt they were catering back-and-fourth behind my back for the entire meal. \n\n- The meal was flawless until I saw the desert menu. It seemed their desert selections were too complicated (or creative?) and most of them didn't sound very good. I had the most simplest one, Orange Blossom Panna Cotta, and I thought it was fruity and good, but raspberry was overpowering orange.\n\nBut overall, I had a great meal and great time at Quince.  Inside design was beautiful.  Their flower arrangement was really fascinating.  I wouldn't mind darkish candle light ambience.  Waiters were friendly and \"looked\" professional. They were all like GQ models in stylish brown suits. Foods were delicious.  Miyabi Oysters and Softshell Crabs, and Wild Boar had complete good tastes. (Squid Ink Garganelli was so so for me.

I thought the previous location was magic , and the kitchen table unique.\nThe new version of Quince 2 STARS! What is going on why chef becomes so arrogant to force only prix fix menu. The new format is either the traditional Chef menu (nothing wrong with that) either a prix fix menu with 4 course and 4 choice per course.\nAllegedly changing daily in reality after 2 weeks monitoring it does not change much maybe one item per day at the most. Now not only I have to make my selection out of a reduced menu but some of the items would even require a supplement , so in reality this is not a prix fix menu, but more a restricted selection menu with variable price.\n\nQuince was fantastic offering an a la carte menu in the traditional \"Italian\" format Starter / Primo / Secondo / Desert but with a mix of Italian and French. Although everybody believes in Italy each meal is all the course it is not the reality. Most of the italian order 2 course only out of the first 3 , sometimes pick a desert.\nQuince always had small portion to make sure you could handle the complete four course and that was fine, but every dinner at Quince was special because you could still play with the menu. All the way italian or a mix . I was personally ordering 2 different pasta, because I think is was the best course  at Quince . Every time I was going there where multiple interesting things, and part of the fun was to customize a menu\n\nNow somehow the selection is limited, the price are higher and the freedom is gone. This was clearly done to force a minimum price (probably to deal with the huge success they wanted to ensure a some minimum income p.p) and probably to waste less food , as a menu with less selection is by far easier to manage. Not sure what is the drive behind, maybe simply to copy  high end restaurant like COI or SaiSon \nIt was a great restaurant and a great chef, now I am sure is still a great chef but is not a great restaurant anymore, I don't find so exciting to go in a place I can't order what I like", "author": "Diego D."}

What isn't there to love.\r\n\r\nYes, if you want to come here, be prepared. It's hard to get a reservation and it's a meal that will take hours of time and hundreds of dollars to be done properly. However, if this isn't an issue, read on.\r\n\r\nWhen I called two weeks ago to make a reservation for my wife's birthday, the best they could do for a Saturday night was 10pm - which isn't really a problem as we're night owls anyway. When they asked if it was for a special occasion, I mentioned it was my wife's birthday, and that was that. \r\n\r\nThis afternoon, the restaurant called to ask if we wanted an earlier seating - which we jumped at. 10pm is fine, but 7:30 is better as we would be able to relax through the meal.\r\n\r\nThe service was amazing. As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by name, coats were taken and we were seated. It was then that we were presented with special menus that simply said \"Happy Birthday Janet\" on the top. No big spectacle, just a nice touch showing that they remembered it was a special night. These small touches ran the whole night - our water and wine glasses never ran dry, and the service was transparent - never intrusive or invasive. When the dessert menu was presented, we were asked if we were having a celebratory dessert or just coffee - a small but genuine touch that finished with a single candle in my wife's gelato.\r\n\r\nThe food was expertly prepared Alto Adige style cuisine. I started with two sea scallops with pureed sunchokes and black chanterelles, followed by a polpette with German bacon (speck), and finally a trio of pork preparations: belly, house made sausage and loin. Janet had a beet salad followed by a maccheroni with foie gras sauce and a perfect petrale sole.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected highlights were the beverages. From the champagne we started with to a hidden find of a 1994 white Rioja to the Quince ESB - a beer that was more Belgian than bitter - made by one of the chefs.\r\n\r\nAs we left, they presented my wife with one of her menus, rolled and tied with a bow. Walking past Willie Brown who had just been seated next to us, we were happy to have had the experience.\r\n\r\nA perfect place for a celebratory Italian meal.", "author": "Avery G."}

As soon as we get the menu we open it up to see that the first page states the date and Happy Birthday, Drew in elegant font. Wow! \n\nWe decided to go all out and ordered four courses of pure decadence. I had the oxtail appetizer, Drew had the scallops. Both were unbelievable. \n\nFor second courses, I got the tagliatelle and Drew got the gnocchi. The tagliatelle came with three sauces: marinara, pesto and duck liver. The marinara was good but not memorable but the pesto and duck were excellent. The pasta had an incredible silky texture. This dish was freakin' delicious. Drew's gnocchi was incredibly light and tasty as well. \n\nFor third courses, I had the duck and Drew had the monkfish. Relatively speaking, the third courses were the weakest part of the menu for me. The duck was delicious but it was a touch overcooked and I felt the jam that it came with was a bit too sweet and overpowering. However, I ate every bite. It was very good. Drew's monkfish was good but a little salty and the sauce was quite rich. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the vanilla bean gelato and dulce de leche gelato. As it was Drew's birthday, it arrived with a candle. The vanilla bean had fresh mint inside and was essentially wrapped in the dulce de leche gelato. The gelato was coated with toffee on the outside and plated in a rich pool of fudge. Sooo decadent and delish. We loved it.\n\nWe both had some wine with dinner, including the rose champagne. This champagne was the standout wine of the evening. Sublime. \n\nThe service was phenomenal. Our water glasses were never empty and our finished plates never stayed on our tables for very long. Our server was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and gave great suggestions. \n\nThe portions are not very big but the food is so rich that it was not necessary to have large portions. Also, it was clear that a lot of attention was given to each and every dish. Attention to detail was definitely not lacking in every aspect of this fine establishment. By the way, we were given the personalized menus to commemorate the evening. \n\nTop notch food and service in an intimate, romantic setting.

The food at Quince was delicious and the flavors were impeccable. Each taste was savory and paired well with the right spices and vegetables along with wine. I have to also mention that the staff was on top of it and really went the extra mile. This place is so awesome for private party or a romantic dinner for two. They really make you feel special. We went for our anniversary and they literally updated our menu's to say Happy Anniversary. Great for special occasions. I would say money well spent. I definitely wasn't thinking we should have gone to Gary Danko instead by the end of the evening. We all know if you have been to Gary Danko, this says a lot.", "author": "Kalifornia S."}

My date and I, at 32 and in our SF uniforms, jeans and sweaters, were by far the youngest and worst dressed couple in the joint at 10PM on a Saturday night.  Buffy and Hamilton seated to our left, Trevor and Madison to our right, it felt like high supper at the Olympic Club.\n\nEven so, the meal started out great with some ridiculously good bread sticks that I woke up thinking about this morning.  The menu featured a tasting menu that, for $187, felt a wee overpriced for a meal that, I hoped, would not be my Last Meal.  So we went a la carte and picked the asparagus soup and scallops to start.  Both good, but not amazing.  We had the sausage gnocchi for a second and, based on the waiter's recommendation, the most expensive main course, the lamb.  Also just good, but had clearly been under the heat lamp for too long as the plate was scalding hot and the flavors ran together a bit.  \n\nDisappointing.  Definitely not worth the $200 bill with only one glass of wine apiece, nor the almost unanimous 5 stars everyone here seems to give it.  \n\nThankfully the girl I went with is rad and she paid.\n\n(13)", "author": "Matt S."}

Everything we ate---from the delectable little dinner rolls to the rose and geranium scented creme caramel---was absolutely divine, but never pretentious or overly complex (I think this is because it's Italian cuisine rather than French). And, after eating such an amazing meal, we all felt serene and blessed, but not at all uncomfortably full....this may also be because the portions are pretty small.\n\nThe white wine we ordered wasn't chilled because they'd run out of cold bottles, so while we waited for it to chill they poured us another very nice white, gratis--that was a nice touch.\nThe waitstaff are dancers--they float and flit about the table in a single choreographed movement that is pleasantly attentive but unobtrusive.\nThe decor is modern romantic--Matthew Barney could've designed the chandeliers, everything else is very classic: creamy tablecloths, dim amber lights, the bright distraction of green pears in a hyper-realist set of paintings against the wall. Very nice, without feeling stuffy. \nWhen we finished our meal, the steward at the door had our coats in hand before we even walked up to the door, and the valet had brought my dad's car around to the front while we were paying the bill--the bill which, while substantial, was still considerably less than Spago.\n\nExcellent, amazing, well-done. Definitely if you're looking for a special occasion dinner, Quince is the place to go, without even a second's pause. Although it's best suited for an initimate dinner--2 or 4 people, I'd say.", "author": "Renu C."}

The menu was larger than I expected; my mom and I each selected our own 1st, 2nd, and 3rd courses.\n\nAmuse Bouche: Loved it. A cold glass of melon soup with fried zucchini and a fried anchovy with a sweet corn relish. Also, I must mention the bread they bring to the table. Thin, crispy bread sticks and small buttery rolls, topped with salt; all salty, buttery goodness.\n\n1st Course: Scallops with fresh spinach and cherry tomatoes in a savory broth. Amazing flavor; it was one of my favorite dishes of the night. I ordered an artichoke salad with prosciutto, light goat cheese, and roasted bell peppers. The sweetness of the peppers really added to entire dish. \n\n2nd Course: Foie gras mousse with sliced peaches (very small and sweet) and crisp slices of crostini. My mom thought the foie gras was a bit too rich. I ordered pasta with tender shredded pieces of duck with English peas. It reminded me of a ragu. \n\n*The chef brought out a special taste for my mom and I, which included something resembling an angloti with sweet cheese drizzled with honey- and a candied pecan on the side. This was DELICIOUS. And most definitely one of the perks to eating with a chef and having a friend work there (thanks Eric!).\n\n3rd Course: I ordered the lamb with japanese eggplant and caramelized onions. The lamb was perfectly cooked- rare and tender; the eggplant was so savory and melted in my mouth. My mom ordered the fresh local petrale with sweet corn, haricot verts, and cherry tomatoes with a lobster hollandaise. She loved the lightness of the hollandaise and sweetness of the fresh corn with the tanginess of the cherry tomatoes. \n\nSo full at this point. But dessert was in order. My mom's standard order of cappuccino, extra dry and extra hot was made to perfection and my french press coffee was smooth and strong. The dark chocolate semifreddo was a \"lighter\" dessert that we shared; it was topped with coffee nibs and raspberries, which added texture and sweetness. Our server gave us two truffles after dessert; pure chocolate but not too sweet. The truffle melted in my mouth. \n\nOverall, a purely delightful experience at Quince. The service was impeccable. I love the simple, elegant decor and the peaceful, calm atmosphere. Our server was clearly very  knowledgeable about the cuisine and wine and her passion for food was contagious. Quince really embodies the idea of bringing farm fresh food to the table. I don't think 3 courses plus dessert is necessary, but I am glad I tried it this first time.

I really like the open space, with its tall ceilings. It's inviting, comfortable, sectioned so that each area has the appropriate \"mood\". Even the wait area is nice! It's not a quiet space though, but that's just fine.\n\nTired from walking in heels from one of the BART stations, I wanted food and drinks to just appear in front of me. And, obviously, lessons learned from past dining experiences didn't carry over, because when the following exchange took place...\n     Me: Bring me anything.\n     Waitress: How many courses, two or three?\n     Me: Three.\n     Waitress: Any allergies or dislikes?\n     Me: No.\n...*gasp* I forgot to tell her no pork.\n\nAs I've written in two other reviews, fine dining does not do justice to [crispy] pork belly: http://www.yelp.com/biz/redd-yountville#hrid:sE8YUUrkLbeGaJG-UrpaQg and http://www.yelp.com/biz/fleur-de-lys-san-francisco#hrid:H8cK-UoVO2jNLXLgibOUxA. Of course, with my luck, one of the courses she brings me is the suckling pig mix roast, which consisted of different parts of a pig prepared in different ways. None of the parts were really exceptional; there was a fried piece (no, thank you); but the worst was probably the pork belly - there was no crisp (the waitress later explained to me that she introduced it to me incorrectly - not supposed to be crispy) and the meat was tough. Anyway, that was really the only low point of the night (along with amuse bouche). Hopefully I've really learned my lesson this time.\n\nThe rest of the meal was generally phenomenal:\n+ Breads: Tiny rolls of French baguette, came with salted butter and cow milk; cheese crisps\n- Amuse bouche: nettle soup, piece of swordfish (squidlike.. is it supposed to taste like that?), something cauliflower, and a piece of fried something. I know, this is such a helpful review... well, whatever the fried thing was, it had a good citrus-y sauce going with it.\n+ Hiramasa with spice rhubarb, radish buds, and fennel: prepared two ways, tartare and sashimi style. The first bite was odd, since there was a citrus-y flavor I wasn't prepared for, but then I was somehow addicted to this appetizer that was going to last only a couple more bites. Hint: eat everything on the plate.\n+ Another item, complements of the chef: Casoncelli stuffed with ricotta della casa, drizzled with honey and red hot pepper. This was just PERFECT. Perfect perfect perfect!\n+ Faella Spaghetti with sea urchin, geoduck clam and agretti - probably the first time I've eaten so much sea urchin, and loved it.\n+ Dessert: Burnt honey budino was nothing amazing, but it did come with that same delicious concoction of honey/hot pepper from before.\n+ Petite fours were good - liked the macarons especially.\n\nNext time I come back, I'm going to say, \"Bring me anything, mostly ITALIAN. And no pork!\"", "author": "Tina L."}

The couple seated next to us looked like they were on a first or second date.

The space is intimate and unassuming, seating maybe 40 with large tables, white tablecloths, and gorgeous stemware/china.\n\nSince we didn't want to do the tasting, we asked to split several of the menu's dishes, plated for two.  We focused on pasta.  The server happily obliged but warned that some presentations would make this impossible.  \n\nWe started with the halibut tartare, with ethereal potato crisps as thin and crunchy as molten sugar and a salad of herbs and fennel.  I would have liked the halibut in larger chunks to give it more  chew and a less creamy mouthfeel but the fish was fresh and the citric salad played well with the fish.\n\nOur next dish was a nettle bigoli with capers, a spicy tomato sauce, hand-massaged octopus, and black beans.  The tender, delicious morsels of octopus (was it massaged pre or post-mortem?) were the best bites of the night - light, slightly chewy, with a complexity not usually associated with octopus.  The tomato sauce, likewise, was perfectly balanced between sweet, salty, and spicy.  The pasta, however, was undercooked and the al dente black beans were just plain strange.  Again, I wondered why this could not have been plated separately since, like the halibut, it was just a mound of food; no sophisticated plating that would have been lost in the split.\n\nThe next two pastas were served side by side - ragout and sausage of rabbit on rigatoni and triangular ravioli stuffed with short ribs, served with mushrooms and mushroom jus.  The former was perfectly cooked and about as good as sausage and pasta can be; the latter was absolutely stunning.  Here, the pasta was even more perfectly cooked - tender, thin, with just enough bite - and the creamy filling harmonized well with the salty, earthy mushrooms.\n\nOur main was a duck breast, cooked very well with perfectly crisped skin and juicy meat (not at all gamy).  But it was served with soggy potatoes and a cloyingly sweet and artificial tasting fruit compote.  The dish cried out for acidity and we wound up scraping the sauce as far away from the meat as possible.\n\nWe ended with a tasty but overly eggy souffle and drank a pleasant Meursault that got markedly better in the glass and finished with a lovely vin santo.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will make sure that chef Tusk is present and accounted for and we would arrange a tasting menu ahead of time.  I would give this meal three and a half to four stars in a vacuum but in the grand scheme of things, we'll call it a mulligan.", "author": "Yan G."}

On a chance I called over and got a table for one before heading for the airport. In essence I had two days of travel food budget to spend in one day, as well as the offer of a limo and business class from the client that called me back, so spending $220 for the five-course tasting menu with the wine pairing didn't leave me feeling drowning in guilt. \n\nThe staff is just wonderful at Quince, both warm and highly professional. When I asked for another glass of the sublime madeira they served at the end of the meal they enthusiastically filled my glass. One of the waiters answered my questions about the Murano chandeliers with genuine pleasure. You can tell it's a plum job. I have to say that the last time I ate alone, traveling in Bath, England, I felt self-conscious and uncomfortable. The staff at Quince made dining solo feel like the entirely proper thing to do, and a bit of a stolen pleasure. \n\nThe food wasn't quite at the level of the best meals of my life - March in New York, Kommandanten in Copenhagen, Uni in Boston - but it was pretty damned good at every level: fresh ingredients, inventive presentation, soaring flavors, delicious wines. The wine list was staggering, both in breadth and depth. I just wished I'd had another $2500 for one of Lalou Leroy's Richebourgs. \n\nAs a final note, I sent the chef, Michael Tusk, a picture of my Swiss Mountain Dogs and the next day got a picture of his and his wife's back.

Fortunately Quince doesn't have a strict dress code so he ditched the trousers for his comfy jeans). \n\nService of course was what you would expect from this caliber of a restaurant- friendly, knowledgeable, not hurried, professional... the sommelier also gave us an outstanding recommendation for a red French wine and we savored every last drop. \n\nFirst course- Foie gras (amazing, one of the best we've had... it was sweetened with moist raisins). Yellowfin tuna tartare (very mild but good, great for the diner looking for a mild appetizer to whet your appetite.. but I still preferred the foie gras). \n\nSecond course- Pappardelle pasta with oxtails (it was surprisingly quite mild... I enjoyed it BUT the) Garganelli pasta with suckling pig was incredible... with a light cream sauce and shaved truffles. The 2nd dish is highly recommended.\n\nThird course- Liberty Duck was so moist juicy savory and SWEET (were there prunes in there?) with teeny tiny soft carrots.

The menu changes, so hard to say what's good.  An appetizer, of pork medallions wrapped in bacon was indulgent and savory, substantial but not heavy. As a main, I had the Saffron Squash Ravioli in Creme Sauce, and it was next to godliness, nirvana, orgasm or pleasure point of your choice. The flavor was effusively subtle, if that makes any sense - slow uptake, building climax. The rack of lamb my friend had was tender with just enough searing to make that gristle glisten and sparkle in your mouth. Too full, we shared a Chocolate Torte: rich, a little dense and dry but very good.\n\nThe proportions are a little sheepish by American standards for the price. A place to go for an occasional treat rather than a daily meal. Waitstaff is attentive, formal but not stuffy.

The menu changes frequently so its hard to make a specific recommendation, but the agnolotti usually is on the menu and is especially good. \n\nPortions are small which make the proposed three courses actually quite do-able. It won't be a cheap meal by any stretch, but it will be a VERY good meal. I'd recommend choosing one from the first course selection and then two from the second course (pasta) selection. The third course options are also very good, but there are lots of places to get meat, fowl or fish prepared well in the city, but few that rival the pasta here. \n\nIts tough to get a reseration here because a lot of locals set standing reservations. Not on open table either. Book a month in advance to the day is about the only way.\n\nCrowd skews a bit old, probably because of the price points. Go anyway. Its worth it", "author": "jeremy l."}

Too bad we didn't try Quince earlier because we definitely would have come back had we known how good our meal was going to be!\n\nReservations are really tough to get.  We had to settle for a Tuesday night at 5:30pm.  Our service was top-notch--we never had our water glasses go anywhere close to half-empty; our server knew the menu inside out & gave excellent recommendations; everything was cleared away promptly.  Also, I have to give props to the chefs & our server for taking care of my food needs.  I'm allergic to rosemary & almost every dish had a little bit of rosemary in it as it is in season right now.  The chef reworked my selections so there was no rosemary in my items.  :)\n\nFood is excellent--very rich & satisfying.  Most people order 3 courses, but we opted to split a first course so that we could both get our own desserts.  Quince is known for their pastas, so don't skip out on that course!  In fact, if I had known how good the pasta was going to be, I would have ordered a double portion!  Scallops were perfectly seared & very flavorful.  My duck was delectable, especially considering the chef had to come up with a new sauce based on my rosemary allergy.  All I can say is that the balsamic/quince sauce needs to be part of the regular menu!  It was the best duck course I've eaten ever!  The Meyer lemon chiffon cake that we had for dessert was one of my favorite desserts I've had.  The hubby & I were glad we decided not to share because there would have been a death match fight to the end on that one!\n\nI should note, this place is pricey & the only restaurant that Zagat was completely off in its estimate of cost.  But, if you want to splurge & enjoy a phenomenal meal, by all means you have to come to Quince!\n\nFOOD ORDERED:\nFirst course--Scallops\nSecond course--Spaghetti with Dungeness crab (me) & gnocchi (hubby)\nThird course--Duck (me) & Petrale sole (hubby)\nDessert--Meyer lemon chiffon cake", "author": "Jenny M."}

It is seldom that a restaurant blows my mind from A to Z! Generally, we have favorite items in certain restaurants and tend to start at one and finish at another. We dined a few times at Quince when it was on Bush and Octavia and it was SPOT on every time.\nWe have learned our lesson - Never go to those restaurants that charge an arm and a leg because they have Michelin stars and basically the chef/owner no longer touches a pan!!! There were more stars on the ceiling of the bathroom then in the cooking!\nOne item was above average - the lobster! \nThe mini mise-en-bouche no WOW factor! More Asian than Italian.\nThe nettle \"SHOT\" was very good!\nThe beets had no flavor, and the texture was like an avocado in the bad season where you have strands in them! With that, was some BURRATA whipped cream - how you can screw up \"BURATA\" IS BEYOND ME!!!\nThe crab had to be spit out!  Both of the orders were super stinky! Not exagerating!!! Probably left out overnight, and the culprit did not want to get fired, so he shoved it back in the fridge!\nThe Tortellini no WOW factor - not enough seasoning, and some ends were dry!\nThe surprise \"Gnocchi\", If that's what they want to call it, was tasty but borderline too salty...\nThe Dover sole (for 2) looked appetizing when it did it's catwalk around the table, but the one one that came back plated, simply was not cooked at the right temp - Rubbery. weird texture! \nRisotto had a funky perfume taste to it, although the preperation of the rice was spot on.\nThe \"Cote de Boeuf\"... Not true to it's real name... No bone, just some frou frou little medallions that had a weak bordelaise sauce - if you closed your eyes and tasted, you would not guess that you were eating beef!\nThe desserts were just WRONG! Michelin STAR???? are you kidding???\nTusk, you may or may not care as you're pockets are just overflowing, but go back to the basics!!! Keep things simple - too much of nothing ends up being a big fruit salad of nothing special!\n$3000 for 7 of us - granted, we had $1300 in wine, but that was the highlight!!!\nDaniel was fun, so was the young lady sommelier! They seemed to appreciate a younger table (30's and 40's,) as everyone in there was stuffed up!\nCONCLUSION: Just like the French Laundry is just no longer worth it like years ago, stay away, save your money, OR go to their casual bistrot next door! I've been told it is pretty good, and remembering the first location, I trust that info!\nBTW... We are all restaurant owners, and we have been doing this since the early age of 9!!! We know what we are talking about!!!\nAs a matter of fact WE HATE YELP WITH A PASSION, but felt the need to share this joke with all of you!\nCheers!", "author": "L L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-20", "description": "This review is for the Quince menu: Overall, way more misses than hits. Evening started off weird because they chose to send out the canapes before offering the menu or wine list, but didn't explain that too clearly, so for the first few minutes I was sitting there watching waiters and servers walk by and wondering what I was waiting for. Rest of the service went much more smoothly. As for the food, there was something off with many of the dishes that made the experience far from satisfying. The canapes and appetizers were fantastic in their simplicity, the highlight (and best dish of the night) being a surprisingly juicy stalk of white asparagus. The Quince martini was also delicious. But then the gnudi dish that followed felt confused--the porcini outshone the bland pasta. The urchin and passionfruit risotto had not enough uni flavor to justify its extravagant add-on pricetag. The casoncelli were so tiny I wondered why the chefs bothered stuffing them with \"Phil Paine's squab\" at all--there wasn't enough filling to do justice to what was presumably a delicious breed. Same problem with the duck tortellini, which was further compounded by the pasta being undercooked (or maybe it was a bad recipe?) AND being outshone by the mushrooms on top of it (truffles this time). The lamb dish needed more jus on the lamb and less lemon juice on the broccolini. In the end the tableware--which was thoughtfully chosen to complement the courses and visually quite appetizing--left a deeper impression than the dishes they contained.", "author": "Rich T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-02-04", "description": "I really really wanted to fall in love with Quince.  One of my friends (Scott W) came here for a birthday and said it was one of the best meals of his life.  Morgan M (the one of Bi-Rite meat guy fame) used to work here and I got a chance to meet some of the current chefs - who were of course super nice and only had good things to say about the restaurant.\n\nThe evening started out pretty well.  The current location (soon to be moving) on Octavia street is quiet and tucked in next to some residential buildings.  If you come up on Bush St there are huge windows where you can peer into the kitchen and gawp at the pasta or watch them at work.\n\nWe pulled up on our bikes and locked up at the signpost close to the valet station (I'll bet that doesn't happen very often! To contrast as we went in the valets were bringing out a Maserati and during dinner a Rolls Royce pulled up).\n\nThey seated us right away for our reservation.  I didn't see any signs of people waiting around for tables.  Either this is a sign of the recession or smart planning on our part to choose not to go on a weekend.\n\n\n*** AMBIANCE: small and intimate.  It's not a designer space.  I get the impression this is the kind of place to go eat good food and enjoy the company of friends.  The decor is nicely done but nothing flashy to compete with the food or conversation.  Very understated.  Some might call it stuffy but it didn't bother me.\n\n\n*** SERVICE: They make an effort to provide real table service - helpful and discreet.  I thought it was pretty good, better than a lot of restaurants, but I'm not sure why people raved about the service. I expected a certain level of service due to the type of restaurant it was and the service I received was equal to my expectations.  If you're not used to this, then you may be bowled over.  I've had better but I've also certainly had far worse.  I like that they make a real effort though to provide a good service since it seems to be an area where a lot of restaurants are failing.\n\nI will say that there seem to be a lot of front room staff and often times I wondered what they were there for.  It almost seemed too much.  Hubby thought it was pretentious to have so many people (especially as when we saw the back there were only 2 people there).  Maybe it just seemed that way because the space is so small.\n\nEven with all the staff they didn't notice that hubby was left handed and kept setting his utensils on the wrong side.  Constant swapping.  I expect really great service to notice this and adjust accordingly.\n\n\n*** FOOD: This was the one place where Quince was disappointing.  The pasta (gnocchi with dungeness crab, romanesco broccoli, hot pepper, meyer lemon and raviolo di ricotta) was excellent.  I can't recommend the pasta and especially the raviolo di ricotta enough.  If I were to come back, I would only get prosecco and pasta.  The first course (sea scallops with romanesco broccoli puree, pomelo-prosecco sauce and pork belly with farro, black trumpet mushrooms) was good but...it's hard to say... but not that interesting.  It was competently done but didn't excite the tastebuds.  Same with the third course (skate wig with scallop mousseline, lobster, rainbow carrots, ginger and Riverdog Farm pork, pumpkin, hedgehog mushrooms).  Both plates were on the salty side - still edible but definitely felt too salty.  All the dishes here were very old school rich and saucy.  In some cases, like with both pork dishes, you could hardly taste the pork because of the sauce.  We skipped dessert because the reviews here and the menu seemed to be mostly gelato.  However, they brought out a dessert of chocolate/lavender gelato for our celebration anyways - very nice.\n\n\n*** PRICE:  The price is on par with any nicer restaurant.  Only $2-5 more for appetizers and pasta than Delfina or Zuni Cafe.  About $5-10 more for the main course.  However, at Quince a single person can easily have all three courses themselves, whereas at Delfina or Zuni Cafe you can split a couple of dishes and still feel full.  \n\nThe prices are slightly higher for the tasting menu than indicated by their website, $110 per person, $70 per person wine pairing and $15 per person cheese.\n\n\n*** CONCLUSION: while I enjoyed my dinner there and didn't think it was expensive in comparison so every other place I go, I would much rather have spent the money on dinner at Michael Mina or Zuni Cafe instead.  I don't think I will be going back - too many disappointing meals at much touted restaurants is making me jaded.", "author": "Jean K."}

So I was pretty disappointed unfortunately.  The food was really well done but the attitude was a little but too much for me.  We were a party of 4, one of us was a vegetarian, but all are lovers of fine food and drink.  They do not have a vegetatian tasting menu so none of us were allowed to order the tasting menu which was too bad as the other 3 of us would have ordered it.  Our waiter seemed intimidated and said several times \"Chef doesnt like this\" and Chef wont do that.  This was not us asking for special preparations or anything other type of substitution as  I always respect a chefs building of a dish but we were asking if we could order somethign from teh tasting menu because they would let us have it to begin with.  I was really put off by the lack of desire to make the diner happy.  I expect more from a restaurant of this caliber.\n\nAnother negative was the uncovered cheese table was next to our table loaded up with very stinky cheeses.  Now, I love me some stinky cheese but not all throughout dinner.  It definitely put me off from ordering dessert.\n\nThat aside, the food we did order was great.  The place was beautiful and the seats very comfortable.  And the wine guy was charming and knowledgable.  \n\nOverall I would not go back and neither would the others with me..", "author": "M B."}

I had heard good things about Quince, so I was very excited to try it out. \n\nWe arrived 5 mins early and the place was packed. We found a cozy spot out of the way, but still in the main entry way. The place is small. We were promptly greeted, coats taken and given a wine list. 20 mins later we were asked if we'd like to order drinks, to which we responded no, since we figured we would be seated soon (plus we wanted to order a bottle - it's always more fun to open it at the table vs. standing in the entryway). Another 15-20 mins roll around when we are then told our table would be a few more minutes. ~ok - getting hankry at this point (hungry+cranky+angry)~ My friend finally calls it at 9:45 and asks for our coats. At this time, the folks at our table finally get up to leave (I failed to mention they had been finished for at least 15 mins and were waiting for a cab that the restaurant had called). I don't blame them, I'd do the same it was cold outside.\n\nThe GM of Quince came out to try to salvage the situation. Unfortunately it was too late and since we were so damn hankry we couldn't even formulate words. (you've all been there are one point in time). When you make a dinner reservation in SF at 9pm, you EXPECT to be seated on time. No one in this city eats that late!!! Anyhow, she was very gracious, apologized profusely and seemed genuinely sorry for the entire ordeal. Since we were too angry to speak, we took her card and send a follow up email the next day. After an exchange of emails, I received a gift certificate in the mail. A very kind gesture.\n\nMy friend and I plan to go back and give Quince another try (we would have without the generous gift certificate offered by them). \nThe food that was being served to all the other tables for the hour  we stood there *looked* and *smelled* incredible. \n\nThe atmosphere is also very elegant and they have wonderful hand blown chandeliers, the staff was very polished, etc (which is why they get 2 stars).  \n\nTo be updated in a few weeks after I go back.... dum dum dum....", "author": "melissa g."}

Your wine and water glasses are never empty, each course comes just at the right time, someone is standing by to pull out your chair and fold your napkin.

I thought it was so well presented and everything was in harmony. The second course was a duo of lobster and cod with some black truffles. I thought everything tasted fantastic. There was a purple potato mash on the plate, which for me did not add much to the dish, but tasted great. Third course was spaghetti with braised Japanese Octopus. Tasted great and certainly some interesting flavors. Last course was a black cod with some suckling pig and a spot prawn. I think the black cod was the highlight. I am torn between that and the scallops. We then did the cheese course before dessert. The gentleman going through the cheeses was quite informed. We loved every cheese we had. Last we ended with a dessert that I actually cannot remember and I think it was the wrong one, but we loved it.

The reception at the door was friendly and started the evening off on a positive note.  We only had to wait five minutes til we were seated at our table, but while waiting we were brought thinly-sliced freshly fried potato chips along with some yummy cocktails and wines. One of the drinks was made with strawberry puree and bitters - so decadent!\n\nThe meal began with appetizers of a sformato (sort of like a custard made with vegetables, in this case, kale) and served with an oven-dried tomato, olive oil and bean sauce.  Absolutely delicious.  Another appetizer was the cappelletti pasta with a soft, cheesey filling enriched with Jerusalem artichoke and burgundy truffle.  The pasta was toothsome and the cheese filling soft and flavorful.  One other pasta was made in a different shape and filled with a meat (lamb, I think) in a red sauce.  This had all of us oohing and ahhing it was so good!\n\nOur entrees were black sea bass, zuppa di pesci, and Watson farm lamb.  The standouts were the sea bass, crisped and served with an eggplant -pepper puree, sultanas and pinenuts.  The fish stew was a mound of seafood (mussels, clams, shrimp, squid and skate) in a bowl with a broth of white wine (no tomatoes) poured over.  It seemed a little creamy so it probably had some cream in it as well.  It was delicious!\nAlthough each plate had some vegetables (notably deliciously tender\nzucchini) there was not a lot of them and there was no other potato, rice\ngrain served alongside except for the lamb entree.  However, there was an endless supply of yummy house-made bread, one baguette style and the other an olive-oil\nsoft roll. The lamb was a nice piece seared nicely served with fingerling potato, olive, fennel and orange.  Nice flavors, but not as successful a preparation as the fish dishes.\n\nThe service was outstanding.  Attentive without being overbearing.  The wine-drinkers at the table particularly liked that they were given tastes of wine before ordering to make sure they had the right one for\nthe food served.  In some cases, it took a few tastes to get the one\nthat best complemented the food (and pleased the drinker!)\n\nDesserts were good but not groan-inducing,  including a dense chocolate torte and an apple tart/crisp with honey ice cream.\nIn all, this was a terrific meal priced not for the faint of heart, when you include all the alcohol.

I guess this will give me a good reason to go back.  I do suggest the duck.  It was perfect and delicate.\n\nThe only thing that bugged me, was our server.  Although she was very very nice, she came off as too stuffy at times, and it almost seemed that she was trying too hard to be a \"server at a fancy restaurant\".  I don't know if it was due to her being british or not, but she was a bit too stiff.", "author": "Jayson O."}

We walked over after a drink at Bix. Huh... well... what can I say? I think we would have been better off just eating at Bix for about half the price and twice the food. Yes, the restaurant is pretty but it is missing an intimacy that can be found at so many restaurants in SF. It felt like everyone was whispering - it was SO quiet (and it was Friday evening at 8:00). There is a stuffy element to Quince that just doesn't really make sense...it's like the table ar too spread apart. The food was good but not great.. but like the restaurant, it was \"pretty.\"  The best part of the meal - they printed \"happy birthday\" at the top of our menus. Cute.... thoughtful... but not worth the (over) $500 dinner. \nIf you are looking to have fun I'd skip Quince. If you are looking to have a quiet, elegant dinner (and you don't mind being slightly hungry when you leave), try Quince. As for me, I doubt I will go back because there are too many better options.", "author": "Laurie N."}

We ordered the appetizer that was primarily a white bean soup(forget what it was called), a lobster salad(delish), and two entrees:  some sort of cow's gland(that tasted like fried chicken) and a pasta dish.  I wasn't a big fan of the gland, but the pasta was great.\n\nOne of the entrees was wrong--they gave us the pork chop, and when we returned it, we were told that the chef wanted to give it to us for free.  Nice gesture.\n\nThe waiter was impeccably good.  There was also the guy handing out the bread.  He kept coming and asking if we wanted more, and we kept taking more.  We were too stuffed for dessert, and the waiter even overheard us saying that we' d be late to our next venue and was considerate enough to ask if we'd like to speed things along.\n\nThe cost, including a generous tip, probably was slightly over $100 per person for 1 appetizer, 1 salad, 2 entrees, 1 cocktail and 2 glasses of wine.  \n\nFor sure, I would not come here on every special occasion.

Here's a rundown of the evening: \n\nReservations: Made online, and I noted that it was a birthday dinner. A few days later, they called to confirm the reservation, and also to confirm the spelling of my wife's name. \n\nArrival: We got there about 10 minutes late, but no problem being shown directly to our table. We had theater tickets for after dinner, so our reservation was fairly early (5:30). The place was almost empty when we got there, but soon filled up. \n\nMenus: When they handed us our menus, we saw they they had been personalized with \"Happy Birthday, S.....\" printed on the top. A nice touch! \n\nFirst course: I started with the steelhead tartare, and my wife had the scallops. Wonderful tastes, although 2 scallops for almost $20 does seem a bit pricey. \n\nSecond course: We shared a pasta and sausage dish. It was delicious, and enough to share. \n\nThird course: I had the strip loin, and my wife choose the rabbit. Again, delicious flavors and very nice presentations. \n\nDessert: My wife selected the chocolate platter, and I went for the Quince. Her dish was a little overpowering (*very* dark chocolate), but mine was lite and satisfying. \n\nWines: We each had a glass with dinner and the selected dessert pairing. I've blanked on the details, but the sommelier was helpful without being overbearing. \n\nService: Very friendly, helpful, and not too stuffy. \n\nOne more thing: The bread was fantastic. I could live on those rolls for days! \n\nOverall, a very nice experience. Yes, it's pricey and we certainly wouldn't go here without a good reason.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-07-25", "description": "This is probably my favorite restaurant in San Francisco.  I found it because I was browsing the 2010 Michelin Guide and noticed that there was a new restaurant that looked interesting, so we decided to try it.  We've been here twice now, the first time was me, my bf, and four friends.  The second was just me and the bf.  \n\nThe first time around, it was good.  We had looked at the menu, and my bf and I really wanted to try one of the tasting menus.  What can I say?  We really like tasting menus.  However, the other four weren't as into it, so we ordered off the regular menu.\n\nI had foie gras, cheese and honey tortelloni and duck.  The bf had the lobster salad, some sort of other pasta that I don't remember, and sweet breads.  The courses were well done, and pretty good.  Some better than others.  Other people at the table had the agnolotti and it was probably the best course we had, although my bf's sweet breads were pretty amazing too.  The only flaw was we could only get 9:00 reservations (which is a bit late, but on a weekend, not so bad).  When we got there, they didn't have a table for us, and we had to wait about 30 minutes, which was a bit annoying as we were starving, but they did give us some free Persecco, so it worked out okay.  We didn't get done until around 12:30 or so, but when you're out with friends and drinking and having a good time, a long meal is not an issue.  In fact, longer meals are sometimes good, as it gives you time to digest and squeeze in a little more.  After that, the bf was quite curious about the tasting menu so we went back for that recently.\n\nOkay, so the tasting menu.  This time we had 6:15 reservations, so that was okay.  We knew the meal was going to be awhile, and so we were prepared.  Starving, and prepared.  So we get the chef's tasting menu and the wine pairings.  The courses were pretty good, with the star being the ricotta ravioli with basil and tomato and an egg yolk.  It was like having a mouth orgasm.  It was out of this world.  The lobster was tasty, but a bit overcooked.  The fettuccine with sweet bread was a bit undercooked, but quite tasty.  We were supposed to have suckling pig, but they changed it last minute to squab, which was okay because there was some foie gras on that plate, and you can't go wrong with foie gras.  The squab was good, I thought it was a bit salty, the bf thought it was a bit chewy, but it was quite tasty.  We opted to have an extra cheese course, and they brought the cheese trolley with about 12-15 different types of cheese.  We chose five of them, and they slapped giant hunks of cheese onto the plate.  It was a bit overwhelming, but we made it through somehow.  Dessert was a simple peach with nuts and honey gelato, but it was really amazing.  The wine pairings went absolutely amazing with all the courses, so we were happy with that.  \n\nI've yet to mention the bread.  Cheesy puff pastry twists (yum!), some sort of soft herby roll (also yum!), and some sort of french roll thing, which is good, but not on the same level as the other two.  And there's a lot of it.  They will keep you fully stocked on bread if you desire.\n\nDefinitely a place to go back to.  Get the tasting menu and the wine pairings.  The tasting menu was much more memorable than the regular menu, so I'd recommend that.  Be prepared for a long meal, they don't rush you.  Both of our meals there lasted over three hours, and while some people want in and out, if you enjoy fine dining over a long period of time, Quince is definitely the place for you!", "author": "Grant T."}

I finally broke down and planned ahead for our 5th anniversary dinner, and boy, am I glad I did!\n\nI admit, it started out a little rocky - we had an 8:30 reservation and must have waited at least 30 minutes before a table opened up. That said, we were immediately handed a wine list upon arrival, and received the best waiting area service I've ever seen. I ordered a glass of wine, and my husband ordered an iced tea, which they brought along with sweetener, spoon, etc, on a tray, and waited while he fixed it up. Pretty impressive, especially since he was accidentally wearing his slippers (yes, they're Ugg, but they're still ugly).\n\nThe only real dark spot of the evening was when, after 20+ minutes of waiting and salivating, they brought out some crostini for us and the other delayed couple. I was so hungry I popped it in before she got out the description: mackerel crostini. I'm a huge sushi fan and love fish, in this case it turned out I should have eased myself into such a pungent, over-sized mouthful. My eyes watered, and I wasn't entirely sure I was going to be able to choke it all down... but then they told us we had a table, and it all seemed better.\n\nSo, with this rocky beginning, how can I still give it 5 stars? Am I just a rating trollop, willing to give it away to any old tom, dick or harry restaurant?\n\nNo. This place deserves the 5 stars for two reasons: incredibly good pasta, and some of the best service I've ever seen (and let me tell you, I do my best to get around to good restaurants). \n\nThe basil pesto gnocchi melted in your mouth. Given that we were also in for the Ribeye for two as our third course, I decided when I saw the size of the gnocchi plate that I just wouldn't finish it... and yet, 5 minutes later, there I was with a completely empty plate. I think one of the reasons their service is so good is that they feel compelled to take the plate away before the diner gets it into their head to pick the plate up and lick fervently at the last morsels. I was already making a reach for it...\n\nSadly, I was way too full to try the cheese cart or desserts - an omission I will definitely address in the near future.\n\nIn terms of the service, I did a quick calc: there were ~ 40 diners in the restaurant (packed on a Thursday night), and at least 10 people working the room, and that's not counting people in the kitchen and alet. Everyone helped out every table, and yet there were no dropped balls or over-attention. \n\nAll around, I absolutely loved this tiny little gem of a restaurant, and have pledged to be a better advanced planner to make sure we get in earlier next time.", "author": "Lucinda N."}

So my three may be your 4, however...\n\nFour course dinner cost $230 with tax & tip - I don't drink, the bf had a glass of prosecco (sp?) & a dessert wine, so the tab was mostly for the food. It was my treat for his b-day. It's a big chunk of change for me, for both of us in fact, so we were both hoping for great things. Alas, Quince failed to deliver value for my money. The meal was very nice, but really nothing remarkable, nothing that we'll remember for years to come.\n\nAmbiance - dim lighting, fairly comfortable, not too stuffy. It was nice to carry out a coversation at a normal level. Cobwebs on the chandelier could do with dusting off. Despite one reviewer who advised against wearing jeans, I did wear a pair (sod it, this is SF) and saw other patrons also be-jeaned. Granted, a t-shirt with them would have been too casual, but nonetheless, no need for a three-piece suit to eat here.\n\nService - very attentive. A little disappointed that some of the waitstaff weren't as knowledgable as I would have expected & when presenting dishes, our server merely repeated the menu's description - whilst I inhaled way too much in the olden days, my menu isn't quite that shot, so it felt unnecessary. There's the obligatory napkin-folding should one leave the table for a breath of fresh air or a wazz, which always seems a little odd, to be handling things people have been wiping their lips on. How do they know I didn't pick up foot--and-mouth last time I was back home in the countryside?\n\nFood - \n\nAppetizer - red pepper soup & octopus. Soup was nice, the bf really liked the octopus.\n\nPasta - tagliatelli with three sauces & a pasta with lamb and hot pepper. The tagliatelli was really good, but the bf thought the basil & tomatoe sauces weren no great shakes, but likes the chicken liver sauce. My pasta was good,  but the lamb/hot pepper ragu was nothing special - I wouldn't have known there was hot pepper in it & was hoping for something with a bit of a kick.\n\nEntree - I had the duck, he had the rabbit. Pretty boring dishes with no great, exciting flavours. For $30 each, really not worth it.\n\nDessert  - I enjoyed my souffle, he felt the galette was lacking balance to the sourness of the fruits.\n\nTo summarise, I doubt we'll be back unless it's someone else's treat - I've had food I've enjoyed more at equally good restaurants that charge half.

She seemed truly happy and proud to be working in the Establishment. She came to check in on us multiple times. My husband and I were impressed with the coordination of service between the staff members. We do not drink and they came up with appropriate recommendations. \n\nNow the food. I picked the chef's tasting menu, while my husband chose the 4 course meal. We just wanted to try from both menus. Only later did we realized that I have more courses than him. BUT the chef was kind and generous, and made dishes for my husband to match my courses. In the end, he had as many courses as I had. The dishes were so beautiful in presentation. We were looking at them in admiration that we did not listen to the description. It all tasted great! \n\nMy husband and I appreciated the little extras and the attention to details.

This means that they are so on top of it, they notice whe you need a fill and make a special trip to take care of you.  I don't know of any restaurant in the city that can claim such attention to the customer (okay, Danko for sure, but you get my point....).\n\nAlso, we asked to split our dishes and they basically gave us two full dishes, instead of two halves.

Quince is a solid 4.5, but it's in the league of restaurants at a special level of fine dining - the level where using the word Gastronomy doesn't feel out of place. You won't find better pasta in San Francisco! \n\nOur appetizers were sea scallops, foie gras, soft shell crab, and black mission figs. All impeccable. \n\nThe second course: spaghetti (with melon and shrimp), tortelloni, ravioli, and another pasta dish I'd rather not name than mis-spell horribly. *Note: naming these dishes makes them sound terribly plain, but these aren't the common pasta dishes that the titles first draw to mind. Imagine dashes of espresso, the highest quality cheeses, and noodles prepared to redefine pasta perfection. \n\nIf our meal had been complete after this, the restaurant would have received 5 stars from me. Compared to the second, the third course was satisfying but not as remarkable. We had the duck, pork tenderloin, another pasta dish (magliatone?) and the eggplant parmesan ravioli. (Please remember their menu changes often.) The pastas, again, were nice. The others were a bit tough, though the flavor was strong. \n\nWhen you go, and I recommend you do, double up on the second courses but skip the thirds. Don't pass up the appetizers, and stay for dessert if you're enjoying the company. (We had the raspberry souffle and vanilla bean pain perdu. The pain perdu is worth expanding the belt buckle a notch.)\n\nAlso, be prepared for the extra-attentive and numerous waitstaff. In a restaurant of maybe 15 small tables, there were at least seven brown jackets and six black jackets of waiters, servers, and hostesses - enough to give me a reason to count!

It's the perfect place to take your special someone. \n\nWe started with the complimentary bread plate, which was delicious. Two different types of soft rolls and bread sticks. They were yummy. The menu is divided with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd course. We took a risk and only ordered 1st and 3rd. We were nervously that the portions were going to be small, but we did it anyway.\n\nI started with the eggplant with smoked mozzarella. The mozzarella was smooth, creamy and blended with bits of eggplant. It was served slightly warm. For my entree, I had the skate wing with lobster vinaigrette. The fish was pan seared nicely with a crispy top and the vinaigrette had big chunks of lobster meat. My friend had the quail and that was really good! The meat was flavored very well. My other friend had the paperdella with mushrooms. It was a bit cheesy, but the pasta was very fresh and al dente. Overall, the portions were quite big/average. I'm really glad we only ordered too courses because we were saving room for dessert! \n\nQuince did an amazing job with the desserts. We had the raspberry souffle which was so light and airy. I loved the chunks of raspberry in the bottom. We also had the peach pain du with ice cream. This was also very good too. Since it was bday, they gave us banana ice cream with crumble cookies on the bottom.\n\nWe finished dinner off with petit fours.

There was nothing terribly wrong, although I did send a fish dish back to the kitchen because I kept crunching down on bones and bone fragments.  It was just that we had such high expectations from eating there in the past and it was just not as good as it used to be.  \n\nThe best thing we had was a pasta dish with a Venetian tomato sauce and bigoli beans (that was amazing although a little oversalted.)   My delicate, lovely tortelli were swimming in browned butter sauce; the filling and accompanying peas could not compete with all that strong sauce drowning them.  Asparagus with a breaded egg yolk was perfect and the brown butter sauce was divine.  The chocolate caramel dessert was tasty and its accompanying banana sorbet was refreshing; however the hibiscus jellies had no real flavor and smelled way funky (the waiter said it's supposed to smell funky!! well if it's supposed to be funky then why serve it and shouldn't you warn diners of funkiness???)\n\nOur Italian server was charming and the waitstaff was expertly trained.  They are precise, polite, elegant and helpful.  The only slip (and a bit of a big one given how well everything else was done) was waiting about 15 minutes to order dessert.\n\nI hope Quince hasn't started to rest on its laurels.

We were seated promptly for our reservation and handed menus with a very nice touch - a personalized greeting for our anniversary celebration!  Everything on the a la carte menu looked good but some in our party were interested in the tasting menu.  They do have a policy that either everyone in the party gets the tasting menu or everyone goes a la carte.  It makes sense since the timing of the plates is so important.  We opted for the 2 tasting menus (seafood and chef's) and each couple chose a different one so we could sample more food.  \n\nThe food was amazing, from the presentation on the plate to the temperature, and the flavors - such variety!   The giant ravioli was a long strip with 5 different fillings, beet, carrot, artichoke, wild nettle, and burrata - delicious!  The lamb was flavorful but some bits were a bit chewy, not tough, just not as tender as its medium rare appearance made me believe.  Tasting my husband's dishes - all his seafood dishes were delicious.  Between the two menus, I think the seafood menu was just a bit better.\n\nYou definitely pay for the service and quality of food here.

It was dark inside and the tables were arranged with enough space to allow for a romantic interlude.\n\nThe bread was amazing. I asked for an onion mini roll, it tasted like brioche with crackling top. It had just come from the oven and it lushussness was memorable. They also gave these cheese twists that tasted just like something out of pastry box...forgettable. I recommend they stick to the rolls and do them in another flavor, like olives for example!\nI ordered the tasting menu so i got to try many things. Some I loved and some I didn't care for so it was easy to space and make sure I did not get too full by the end. Choir-boy like young men brought us a jelled nettle soup topped with creme fresh and a fried squash slice. The presentation was lovely but I hate starting my meal with fried anything.\nFor the appetizer I got a maine lobster with corn and english pea with lemon verbena essence. The lobster was a little rubbery but the mix of the soft corn and crisp peas was just perfect!\nThe second course was a gnocchetti \"monte e mare\", tiny gnocchi with a lot of mushroom on a greens puree. The flavors were up to the promise of the description and there was no sign of the \"mare\" part.  For the third plate I got the fois gras. The taste was fantastic and the deck was cooked perfectly!\nNext to the bread, if these two were the only two things I had for dinner, I would have called it perfect! \n\nFor the main I got the spring bollito misto- slow cooked beef, veal, and guinea hen with two sauces. I had great expectations for this dish, in my mind the variety was just perfect and the combination of the meats was creatively paired. The reality however was so disappointing, all three meats were over cooked and had zero flavor! What a let down.\n \nFor desert my favorite course of all, I ordered the dirty girl farm strawberries. The desert was made of five part, only one of which I cared for. The strawberry sorbet was so intense but the rest of it was lame. I know that lame is a weird word to use for food, but lame was the right word for the impact this desert had on me.\n\nI ordered the Navaro Reisling (non-alcoholic) wine. I am glad they had it.

For my recent promotion, my friend asked where would I want to go and celebrate.  My first choice was Myth but they were completely booked so last night we went to my second choice.  We had the 9:30 reservation.  Not ideal but then again, we were lucky getting a table for such a short notice.\n\nThe food is exceptional.  It's complex in it's simplicity.  We both ordered appetizers and pasta dishes.  Didn't bother with entree just can't imagine going to bed with a log of pork loin nestling in my stomach.  My appetizer of sea scallops cooked in Prosecco with mashed cauliflower was delicate.  My friend's appetizer of grilled Japanese octopus was flavorful but tender - cooked to perfection.  My pasta dish is garanelli with smoked eel in a white wine cream sauce.  The garanelli pasta is very fresh and the sauce is very light - nothing like the butchered Alfredo sauce.  My friend got the gnocchi with polpettine.  Yum.  The gnocchi are light and airy pillows with a hint of ginger.  Nice twist.\n\nWe wanted a medium-bodied Italian wine and so the sommelier suggested Cacc'e Mmitte di Lucera 2005 from Southern region of Italy.  It was perfect for our palate.  The wine is a blend of Troia, Montepulciano & Bombino Biano grapes giving it a nice hint of vanilla and floral as it was poured.  The taste is very complex and rich.  I highly recommend the wine.\n\nBy this time it is a little past 11 and we had already finished off the last drop of the wine.

I don't usually go to nice restaurants, but I got a gift certificate as a gift, so I was lucky to try this place. Quince is a small, but homey and upscale Italian restaurant.\n\n\nParking was not a problem- We found street parking, but they also offer valet service.\n\nAll the hosts and waiters were very professional. I didn't understand most of the menu, but the waitress kindly described the dishes to me. \n\nI can't remember everything we ordered, but I do remember that everything was DELICIOUS! The scallops were the best! There were only 2 large sea scallops, but I enjoyed every little bite. \n\nWhen I got up to use the ladies' room, I crumpled my napkin up and placed in on my chair. When I got back to the table, the waiter neatly folded it back on my lap. \n\nIn summary, the service was excellent, and the food was great, but it is a little pricey.", "author": "sophia l."}

The service here is impeccable, and they accommodated our dietary restrictions and preferences more than lovingly.  I caught a mini tour of the kitchen and downstairs eating area (reserved for one group larger than 6) and was blown away.  It was the way I imagined rustic country kitchens in early 20th century France.\n\nThey have a three course menu, not including the pre-meal teaser (our's was a watermelon, onion, cucumber conglomeration that was a surprising treat) or dessert (I had chocolate to die for) and I almost slipped into a food coma on our way home.  I dreamed of the goat's cheese Sformato.  The pastas are worth the fame and praise.  No vegetarian third course option, but the chef whipped up an amazing risotto, making my celiac friend jealous.\n\nI did, however, feel out of place being waited on hand and foot when my whole outfit probably cost less than any one of the courses.  This was in no way due to anything the employees said or did.  The other patrons were decked out in simple yet elegant styles, and I was not.  This is truly a 5 star place.", "author": "Liana W."}

Showed up early to our 9pm reservation and were immediately greeted with the wine list and a glass of wine while we waited for our table (there's no bar in there). Once we seated the menu read like something off of Andrew Zimmerman's Bizarre food show... Beef tongue, Sea Urchin Crostini. Fortunately we're both adventurous and had the Sea Urchin Crostini which was okay, great if you're a sea urchin fan. Big hits were the Octopus salad, smoked trout gnocchi (so rich and yummy), and the seared duck breast.  Expensive but not ridiculous $199 for bottle of wine, 2 glasses of wine, 2 appetizers, 2 starter pastas,  1 entree and dessert. We had a back up plan of going to In and Out if we were still hungry, but portions are good sized.  Leave the jeans at home, you'll be around suits and sports coats.\n\nFYI Corkage is a whopping $35/ bottle. Leave the nice bottle at home and order from the wine list.

Friends have raved about Quince to me for years, but even though I have lived in the city for almost 10 years, I had never tried it - I barely knew where to find it.  Much to my surprise the hostess said she would try to squeeze us in.  Polite and helpful, she called back in 5 minutes and said a table would be ready in 15. \n\nI love food, but tend to be pretty critical particularly when it comes to eating in SF.  It seems like its been a year or two since I have had something amazing.  Dinner at Quince ended up being the best I've had in a while.  I had the veal sweetbread and it was amazing.  The scallops I had for a starter were cooked perfectly and the cheese plate for dessert was an experience.  The price was expensive, but not ridiculous by any stretch of the imagination.  \n\nThe service was exquisite.  I always judge great service by what I call \"appropriate attention\".  If I'm deep in conversation, I don't want someone interrupting me to ask how my meal is.  I expect a good server to know when to ask and pick moments properly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-11-10", "description": "I will start out by talking about the negatives of the restaurant since they are few and the main negative will be changing next year.  The first and biggest one is the space, its very small and box like.  The entire main dinning room is stuffy, prissy and not very welcoming.  I say this is changing because sometime early next year Quince is supposed to move to the corner of Montgomery and Pacific in Myth's old location.  Once in this location (unless they royally screw it up) Quince should be considered a top 3 restaurant in San Francisco.  The other negative is a very pricey wine list, but what else do you expect...\n\nNow for the food which is superb.  It alone is enough to get Quince a 5 star rating even if they served it on paper plates.  This will be the best or close to the best pasta you will ever have.  I know the chef is known for his pasta and its with good reason, its stunningly good.  Everything you get will be delicious but if you go to Quince without tasting the pasta you really haven't gone at all.  I also think the desert is underrated here.  I don't like to point to specifics, especially at nice restaurants, so just make sure you leave room to at least share something.\n\nIf you love great food and fine dinning then Quince is a must try and a great representation of how good San Francisco dinning is.", "author": "Randy L."}

Atmosphere includes the overly (and I mean OVERLY) attentive waitstaff trying to constantly sweep away your plate midmeal. (We were not late for our table, and we did not linger, so this was not a service-the-next-reservation issue.) I felt claustrophobic due to the sheer number of standing/walking service people all around at all times. When they weren't within one foot, which was most of the time, they were along the wall, looking for what to do next.\n\nSo that leaves a question I cannot help but ask: Could they cut some staff and therefore some of the food cost? Seriously.\n\nOkay, so now the food. We had: dungeness crab salad, tomato-basil ravioli, gnocchi with corn/truffle/maybe something else, taglietelle stuffed with (sole? some kind of fish) and peas, halibut entree, some kind of pepper soup, and panna cotta. \n\nObviously, from the previous paragraph, some items were forgettable (this meal was just last week). But, in detail:\n\n--Soup: totally forgettable and bland.\n\n--Gnocchi: amazing! one of the top gnocchis I've ever eaten, if not THE best. Soft and tender perfectly cooked small dumplings, complemented texturally by the creamy corn and flavorfully with that and the truffle.\n\n--Ravioli: bland, except for the crisp zucchini chip that topped each pillow. The pasta itself was perfection; the stuffing and sauce were boring. Boyfriend loved this and would disagree w/me.\n\n--Taglietelle: AMAZING. Standout. As much as I loved the gnocchi, this was a surprise. No idea it would be this good. Although I can't remember the fish inside, I can still taste it in my dreams.\n\n--Halibut: Excellent quality fish. Maybe the absolute best cut of halibut I've ever had--but the combo of flavors on the plate just didn't work. Some kind of salsa.\n\n--Crab salad: Too new-California, large-plate-with-nothing-on-it type thing. Very tasty, but scarce.\n\n--Panna cotta: i died and went to heaven. I'm not a dessert person, and I was begging my sweetheart not to order anything because I was bursting at the seams, but I couldn't keep my chops off the PC. Amazing flavor and texture, complemented with tangelo gremolata. \n\n--Wine: Zayante Syrah. Incredibly \"cheap\" for this kind of place, and wow, what a pick. Delicious and complex on its own, but paired well. We loved it and will consume it regularly henceforth. :]\n\nIn summary, some of the best dishes I've ever eaten in my life were here. But too many forgettable dishes paraded through our fancy dinner night as well. And the place had a \"conservative\" feel to it, as if it caters to the wealthy and, um, distinguished. In our late 30s, we were some of the youngest there.\n\ni will also comment that for everything we consumed, and even the uneven consistency, it felt like a bargain. We laid down way less dough here than at even stuffier places like Aqua and Michael Mina, and I'd say enjoyed it more. So that counts for something.", "author": "Stephanie P."}

From the moment we stepped foot into the restaurant, until the minute we left, we were surrounded by unconditional warmth and hospitality. After checking in (a bit early for our reservation) with a friendly face at the front desk, my dining companion and I proceeded to have cocktails in the lounge. My Quince Martini was a delicate, yet dashing expression of it's often   \naggressive counterpart. \n\nWe were pleasantly surprised to have been seated after just a few sips of our drinks. Once our server happily greeted us, we discussed our menu options and agreed to go for the gold and order the Spring Tasting Menu with wine pairings. It was, after all, our big night out at Quince. Every dish was well-executed and beautifully presented. I absolutely loved and savored each course - the scallop carpaccio, lobster triangoli, tajarin with truffle and wild mushroom, the lamb with artichoke, and the homemade ricotta cheese tart. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about all the food and wine, and also shared mini anecdotes about the various wines. Since we went all out, we shared a cheese plate prior to dessert. This cheese cart was unbelievable - it was a carefully curated and gorgeous selection of unique cheeses from all over the world. At the end of the meal, our server presented us with a dish of dainty petit fours, including a coriander bonbon that has been the best piece of chocolate I've ever tasted.    \n\nThe food at Quince is not to be missed. But what made this meal so wonderful was every moment, step, and person that seemed to make it so meaningful - thoughtful hellos and smiles, a folded napkin, amazing art and decor, magnificent dishware and wine glasses, intelligent service staff, an escort to the restroom, and the list goes on. Our server even took us on a mini tour, in which he showed us the wine cellar and the busy kitchen. The service at Quince is the most exceptional I've seen in the city. It really is like an orchestrated symphony or a choreographed dance. I will surely return to Quince soon, be it for a drink and snack at the bar, or a leisurely dinner in the dining room.", "author": "Kadie C."}

We arrived for our 7;45 reservation and waited at least 5 minutes after being sat down before being offered a menu or having our drink orders taken.   Once the drink order was taken, it took at least 20 minutes before the vodka martini showed up.  We were told that the bar was backed-up.\n\nOne of our party is a vegetarian and when the waiter was asked whether there was a vegatarian tasting menu, we were told that he \"would have to check with the chef to see whether it was possible to put one together.\"  This question cannot be that uncommon in SF, and I was surprised that he actually needed to ask.  The vegetarian ended up ordering off the a la carte menu.\n\nWhen the bread server came around, he sometimes only offered bread to one member in our party.\n\nWhen it came time to order dessert, we asked if the pear sorbet with cake that was on the tasting menu was available.  We were told \"no.\"  But, we were allowed to order just the pear sorbet.  I guess they need to save the cake for the tasting menu diners??\n\nLastly, the a la carte menu is one-note -- \"rich\" -- everything we ordered, even the asparagus came with a cream based sauce.  Most Bay Area diners like to balance out their meal with different textures and levels of richness.  That's an impossible task with the menu that they had last night.\n\nIf you are looking for a special evening with professional service, I'd go to Michael Mina or Fleur de Lys before Quince.", "author": "S Y."}

We were greeted with an open door from the maitre d' and seated promptly at our table without any wait. The dining room was so pretty! It was filled with lovely flowers, gorgeous artwork and furniture. We had a very comfortable and romantic table against the brick wall too. Our server was very sweet and attentive. To my surprise printed in the menu it even said, \"Happy Anniversary Victoria and John.\"  What a nice take home memento for us to remember the evening. We had some really stand out dishes. We opted to do the four course menu rather than the chef's tasting so we could try different courses. Everything sounded so amazing! It was hard to choose favorites. The first course I chose was the Maine lobster which had the most beautiful presentation and was just plate licking good. The next course was the risotto nero which was to die for! It was like a black risotto with octopus and radicchio, just so interesting and complex.The flavors worked together perfectly. John got the fagotelli, which a great choice they just melted in your mouth. I can see why Chef Tusk's pastas receive so much hype. We shared the Liberty duck for two which again was amazing. I love the idea of getting a dish for two. Our server mentioned that the duck is local from Sonoma free of antibiotics and hormones. Gotta love that! I ended my meal with terrina di sorbetti which is a lighter fruit flavored dessert made with huckleberries. The Sommelier was also wonderful, she helped us select a wine that would work well with our meal and wasn't overwhelmingly expensive.

Beautiful restaurant--upscale atmosphere.\n\nAMAZING COCKTAILS!!\n\nHave to write about the cocktails first because they were superb! First, let me start off by saying I pretty much only drink wine, vodka martinis, and occasionally tequila or scotch with no mixers.  I NEVER order off the cocktail menus, because I've never been able to finish a single one of these types of mixed drinks.  They're always too sweet or have a disgusting combination of flavors.  My experience with the Quince cocktail menu was very different :) \n\nTHE QUINCE MARTINI WAS DELIGHTFUL! \nIf you like martinis, you'll looooooove this one.  And if you're not really a martini person, this one will change your mind. The gin is infused with chamomile, goes down incredibly smoothly, and has a very unique mellow taste.  (It also contains a bergamot liqueur.) We loved this one so much that between the two of us we ordered 4!!! We were so impressed with this concoction, we ordered two more cocktails of their menu instead of wine.  One was called the \"honeysuckle\"-something (comes with a fresh flower floating in it) and is made with tequila.  It's basically a margarita straight up, except that it's better than any margarita I've ever had.  I rarely order margaritas, because even when I beg the bartender not to make it sweet, it's too sugary or tastes like total crap! This is another must try.  The only added sugar comes from honey, and it is definitely a perfect amount of sweetness.  Plus, it's very delicate and flavorful. Don't remember the name of the last drink, but it was made with bourbon. It didn't compare to the other two, but still was a pleasant drink. It was a tad too sweet or potent for me--or maybe I just didn't like the flavors. I couldn't put my finger on it. Needless to say, we were severely buzzed when we left. But note: the Quince Martini is about half the size of a regular cocktail, so it wasn't appalling to have 6 drinks between the two of us. \n....So...thank you to Sophie, our bartender, who inspired us to go home and make the Quince martini.\n\nFOOD:\nWe ate here a few weeks ago; so, I'm not sure if the menu is exactly the same. \n\nTomato Dish:\nLight and delicious.  Tomatoes were sweet and flavorful, and the dish contained little interesting balls of tomato sorbet.\n\nOctopus Dish:\nNot my favorite dish, but it had interesting flavors.  I haven't had too many octopus dishes, but I could tell it was cooked perfectly.  It was not rubbery at all, was densely soft, and had a smokey flavor. (Not sure how else to explain it). I think it came with corn and cherry tomatoes, which added a nice flavor. \n\nSquab Fazzolettini:\nLittle dark pasta dumplings filled with squab and a delicious sauce. This was rich and comforting.  Maybe a tad (just a tad) too salty. There were also two tiny little thighs with crispy skin.  Good, solid dish.\n\nSuckling Pig:\nLoved it.  It was thin pork chops, cooked PERFECTLY---juicy and tender.  I can't remember what it came with, but I think it was some sort of potato patty that had horseradish flavors.  Very, very good!\n\nI'm planning on going back to the bar for another bite and a couple of those Quince Martinis!", "author": "s k."}

Friendly, gracious and knowledgable staff who worked seamlessly together and you barely knew they were there!\n\nAfter dinner Mike took us on a tour of the restaurant.

Where they really shine is the pasta: I had the most delicious gnochetti neri with octopus, olio verde and a pure\u00e9 of romanesco; they were pillowy and the octopus perfectly braised, the sauce was unctuous and intense, with a little spice, but it didn't overwhelm the seafood. My partner had the raviolo filled with house ricotta and egg yolk, in a brown butter sauce, which stood up to its reputation; it was savory and complex; I could live on that dish alone. \n\nI had the chanterelle sformato as my appetizer, which was excellent, perfectly paired with radicchio, a delicious aceto balsamico, and pungent parmesan. My partner had a very subtle dish of dungeness crab with precious tomatoes, served with a \"fried green tomato\" on the side which was a bit gimmicky for my taste. The main courses were very good, even memorable, but they didn't stand out like the pastas. We had perfectly cooked duck and rabbit, with flavorful sides like farro and filled turnips; everything on the plate made sense.\n\nThe desserts left much to be desired. We tried the butternut squash fondant, which was more like a warm gele\u00e9 and came with an assortment of earthy and sweet ice creams and meringues that felt incoherent on the plate. The meal ended with the nowadays requisite petits fours, which I frankly could have done without. While visually appealing, they were deficient in taste and texture. The most disappointing was a mini-canel\u00e9 that was tough like a shoe. \n\nThe service is almost impeccable. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly; he seamlessly guided us through the menu, and suggested a great, cheap Pinot Noir. My only complaint is that they only took our wine order after the first course arrived (we were working on our aperitif).\n\nI think the food, and especially the pasta, makes it worth your money. Without a blink, I would give them back the Michelin star they had before the move.", "author": "Halle L."}

I came with my two buds for my Birthday dinner and could only be sad about a couple things. Neither of which are the restaurants fault. Everything we tried was perfect but we couldn't finish those last few bites do to the fact that we kept eating not just our first and second course but the bread...OH MY GOD...The spring onion roll is out of this world and it kept coming and we couldn't say no to it. I felt I betrayed the roll when I told the dude \"I'd better save room for everything else.\"Our server was AWESOME. Our glasses of water never made it past the halfway mark before they magically were full again. He made excellent pairings with the wine to my food since my buds had beer and they wanted their particular beers. Quince if I had the power to raise your Michelin Star at least by one more, it would be done.\n\nOne friend had the poached egg, then the Strangozzi and then the Devil's Gulch Ranch Rabbit.\n\nMy other friend had the Foie Gras Torchon, then Tortelloni, and then the Duck breast with Confit Duck leg.\n\nI had the Veal Shortbreads, chestnut tagliatelle, and finally the farm chicken.\n\nOnce again great job to this restaurant and it's Chef's and servers.

It was 8:45 on a friday, and my brother was in town and wanted to hit up a fancy dinner.  Of course when this was brought up my girlfriend wanted to be part of it too.  Then we had to figure out what kind of fine dining restaurant would take a walk-in 3 top on a fri night.  We called Quince and they said we could hit the lounge or the bar, and that a table might open up.  Turns out, we got hooked up and there was a table available right when we got there.\n\nNext up: a la carte or tasting menu??  Between the 3 of us, 2 got the  chef's tasting menu and one got the spring tasting menu.  There was one shrimp course with a terrine that wasn't that great, but other than that all courses were awesome.  From the avocade soup and tombo amuse bouche course to the rhubarb gelato dessert- so good.  We decided to go all out and get the cheese course also, and that definitely helped this dinner put me to the brink of rolling home.  Super knowledgeable staff, so friendly, they didn't care that we were sticking around til midnight finishing up.  I know, they shouldn't if you are dropping this sort of dough.  But, I like that we can come in here and not get the stuff fine dining service that exists elsewhere.  You serve up the amazing food, we scarf it down.  Repeat x 7.  I do wish the server would have shown a little preference for something on the menu... when asking for recommendations he just would not offer up any insight.

But I was introduced to it as \"one of the best Italian restaurants in SF\", and I wouldn't question that at all. It truly was a great experience. \n\nThey just relocated to a different location so the venue is definitely very nice. It's not a huge restaurant, but good size and good ambiance. Gives you a classy elegant feeling. \n\nWe started off with ordering two cocktails-- QUINCE MARTINI & LA LAMBRETTA. they were both very good. the martini is very classic martini taste, and the la lambretta was more fruity tasting, which I actually liked more. \n\nFood-wise, we ordered the classic 4-course meal, that isn't the tasting menu. We decided to do it a-la-carte. Between the two of us, we had:\n\n+LOBSTER SALAD: this is soooooo delicious!! the lobster was cooked just right, small but very meaty pieces, and the sauce that they put on it was amazingggg~~ it was like mouthgasm xP\n+SEA SCALLOP: very delicious as well. i tried a piece and it was very good, cooked medium rare\n+FAGOTELLI: the most delicious pasta with artichoke, black truffle, and parmigiano reggiano  inside. it was AMAZING omg!!  this is definitely an appetizer size, very small. so don't think of treating it as an entree unless ur going on a diet! \n+BEEF TRIO: ribeye, cheek, and ox tail. very delicious trio. portions were small but still very filling, esp after the appetizer and pasta.\n+GRILLED SALMON: cooked pretty well, not the best salmon i've ever had but it was decent.\n+PASSIONFRUIT SOUFFLE: what the waitor said was the best dessert of theirs. it's a small portion but it was good and came with a bit of gelato on the side. very yummy. i probably would still prefer Roy's chocolate souffle over this though xP\n\nOverall, it was a very good experience. Definitely a fan of their pastas, wish they came in bigger portions! Next time, wouldn't mind trying their $90 tasting menu.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-11-08", "description": "My main takeaway from Quince: everything is borderline salty. Aside from dessert, every single dish I tried pushed my threshold for saltiness. On the other hand, fantastic wine. Service was a bit strange.\n\nI had a party of four. Two in my party arrived first and ordered drinks. When all of us had arrived, we were seated... without a wine list. We had to request one. To our waiter's credit, he made great wine suggestions. My friend prefers French burgundy, and he found us a great local syrah by Cep. Also, we had a vegetarian among us who requested a salad, but was brought a vegetarian dish that was clearly not salad. Quince was quick to return with the original order, however. Service was originally slow--the four of us chatted for sometime before our orders were taken. Things did eventually roll along. Everyone is served at the same time, as expected at higher end restaurants.\n\nWe tried the following dishes:\nScallops and sea urchin: scallops were perfectly cooked, and both scallops and urchin were fresh.\nPumpkin squash soup: creamy, buttery love. :)\nSweetbreads: the first bite was a harmony of flavors and texture, but overtime it became too salty.\nShellfish salad: unsuccessful. There was an attempt to be \"refreshing\" but in a strangely sweet/minty way that failed to hide the fact that the shrimp was fishy.\nRaviolo di ricotta: you get one ravioli, albeit a large one with wild boar flavor and an egg yolk. When you break the yolk, it mixes in with everything else. I think this could have been a great dish, but... too salty.\nSalmon: a very hearty dish. The salmon itself was cooked without being dry.\nBass: being that it was such a thick chunk, it wasn't cooked evenly. The outsides were almost chalky, the texture overall was chewy, and it didn't flake apart properly. And surprise! It was too salty.\nDesserts weren't memorable: I believe we had the Compose of Pluot, some sort of bread pudding, and a candy assortment. On the upside, these weren't salty! Yay.\n\nOne last note, we sat next to the actor from Office Space. I'm amazed that there are occasional celebrity sightings ae a restaurant that to me was really mediocre.", "author": "Esther L."}

I had a wrap party of four with the producer of my advertisement and my wonderful girlfriend.  The decor is opulent, yet stark and very clean.  A very clean and modern place with a lot of style.  The bar is over to the side, with a really nice menu of house cocktails and well chosen wines.  I started at the bar with a natural Sauvignon Blanc from the central coast which was awesome.  When the rest of our party joined, we moved to a table.  Tempted by the chef's menu, we were, but we all decided to go our own way with a three course choice that we shared, making it a 12 course tasting instead.  \nI ordered a bottle of the Somona Coast Pinot Noir Radio-Coteau.  The wine was divine, and the food matched it perfectly.  I had the mushroom and bacon hors d'eovre.  It was delicious, but very small.  All of the portions are relatively small, but opulent and filling despite their size.  \nMy second plate was the pasta with wild boar.  It was also small, but so full of flavor and delicious, it took my breath away.  We started sharing plates and I got to taste three other pasta dishes and they were all delicious.  \nMy main course was the sea bass, which was perfectly cooked, crusty on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside.  This and the delicious vegetables accompanying it where perfectly paired and melted in my mouth.  \nDessert consisted of some scrumptious gelato, and an array of chocolates and candies that I consumed with an amazing espresso, a Blackberry liquor and a few kisses.  All in all a great night and perfect meal.  \nThis is not a cheap date kind of place, but if you're looking to get away from the doom and gloom of the current financial meltdown and want to escape back to the go-go nineties, this is a great place to go.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-05-24", "description": "OK, any restaurant where the words \"amuse bouche\" are uttered is tops in my book.  Enter, Quince.  So much more than just a simple amuse bouche, Quince was as close to a perfect dining experience as it gets.  BTW, we went for our 12th anniversary and the owner's 12th anniversary was the exact same night!  Coincidence?  I think not!\n\nFirst, the room is very comfortable.  A coziness reminiscent of Plumpjack but with an ambiance of staid formality evocative of Masa.  I understand that Quince will be moving to a larger space in Jackson Square sometime in Fall 2009 and I hope they can create a similar vibe.\n\nWe had let the restaurant know that it was our anniversary and they had menus specially prepared that wished us happy anniversary at the top of the 7 course chef's tasting menu.  We chose the tasting menu with wine pairing even though the 4 course menu offered a very good selection.\n\nThere was an amuse bouche (so fun to say...) of a tiny fritter with squid in a lemon aioli.  Then the scallop carpaccio with sea urchin and halibut...then the monkfish with tiny mushrooms and lobster...then the ravioli with asparagus, peas and smoked trout...then the rabbit pappardelle (which they substituted for the duck at my request, thank you very much)...then the lamb prepared 3 ways with lavender stuffed squash, olive stuffed squash blossom and peppers...then the sorbet and tiny tangerine wedge (to clear the palate of course) and then finally, the tiramisu which wasn't tiramisu at all but all the elements piled into a little mound with spun sugar.  And every course with a wine pairing!  Oh, and then when we ordered coffee they brought even more sweets just because.  Are you drooling yet?  The pacing was tight and yet not rushed.  It's obvious that the staff is not only well trained but actually pays attention to each individual table.\n\nI know that people have already used the word impeccable to describe the service at Quince but it absolutely fits.  It almost made me dizzy to watch the cyclone-like dance of the servers, all dressed very professionally in brown tweed, men and women alike.  They revolve around and around the room in a choreographed culinary ballet.  I first found the service to be a little uptight but in the end appreciated the delicate discipline of the experience.  Our server Erin was perfectly attentive without being obtrusive however it felt as though the entire wait staff was at our disposal whenever we needed them.\n\nMake no mistake, you will pay through the nose for this kind of experience but know that you will absolutely get what you are paying for at Quince!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-10-04", "description": "UPDATE:\nQuince is *the* place for pasta. One bite of the tagliatelle and you suddenly understand what al dente really means. In Italian joints, the pasta dishes are really about the sauce on top. At Quince, the sauces are additional notes that bring out the flavors and textures of the past itself. \n\nThe appetizers are really good too - sfomato and soups (often with vegetarian broth base), and dessert has gotten much better than the first time we were in.  We continue to skip the mains and just go for a second round of pastas, but folks at the tables at either side of us seemed really happy with their meat dishes.\n\nService is always stellar, with veg-friendly and wine recommendations and a constant eye on the table for empty glasses or ugly spills (they will artfully move your water bottle to cover stains, etc). Everything is designed for a smooth, beautiful dinner. Sometimes I do feel I have to on my best behavior because the atmosphere is so calm and quiet, but somehow this adds the special to 'special occasion'.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nOnce again Yelp rocks my world!\n\nAfter extensive research looking for a nice upscale place for our anniversary, we picked Quince. Thanks to Yelp I knew to have two rounds of second course and skip the third course. This was an excellent plan! The pasta had bite but not from being undercooked but rather from being fresh and homemade. It was amazing! We had the tagliatelle with due sughi (two sauces) instead of the tre (three) because the third was meat-based and the server didnt bat an eye. The two sauces were a red and a zucchini butter, beautifully plated and soooooo yummy. You bet I scraped that plate with my bread! The butternut squash stuffed pasta was very well executed, but I tend to stick to dessert for sweet flavors. The sauce was very salty BUT I think it was called for in this case to balance out the sweet. All in all it was a good dish, maybe great, but not necessarily to my taste.  In the next round I had the ricotta raviola with an egg yolk on top and it was delicious and very different from anything Ive had before. Excellent. My fiance had the meaty pillows and loved them. Obviously, I didnt have a taste of that one.\n\nIn my excitement over the pastas I skipped over the first course - oops! We had three apps - the specialty sformata which I suspect was the artichoke app folks keep talking about since the server was stumped when I asked her about it. This late in the season it was a cauliflower sfomata instead and we were hesitant because we aren't a huge fan of the veg. But, we thought we should go for it for the novelty and it was AMAZING. It was like an extra thick creamy soup (so thick it can be formed) covered in a cheese sauce. I want more now - it was the ultimate comfort food. \n\nWe also had the haricots verts dressed with just the right amount of a creamy sauce which I adored and tuna strips with roasted peppers which was ok, but I think the flavor of the pepper overpowered the delicacy of the fish.\n\nService was amazing - it was great to come in and tell the server my dietary restrictions and have her rattle through the menu telling me all my choices, and it was plenty which also rocks! True to other Yelp reviews servers walked me to the Ladies room and opened the door for me, and when I came back my napkin was refolded. Glasses were kept half full and when it became obvious I drink a lot more than my fiance, they adjusted and kept topping my glass but only topped his occasionally. They were also excellent with the water. Aaaand, they called us a cab and told us when it was ready.\n\nThe wine service also excelled. The wine we were recommended was perfectly to my taste, which is far outside what you are supposed to want with lighter vegetarian dishes (I like a heavy rich red).  I was very impressed.\n\nAll in all it was an excellent night. I enjoyed people watching although the financial professionals at the table next to us were pretty disgusting. The lovely older couple at the table on the other side fully made up for them though - they are so in love with the place they are regulars although they dont live in California! \n\nAs pointed out in other reviews, they do fall short in desserts. Since I was expecting this, the dinner did not end on a low note. The cheese list looks amazing so if I did have more room left, I would have had that instead. However, I am taking one star off because I am a dessert fiend and it would be a nice touch to have a strong dessert chef on board.\n\nDinner for two was $240. We had a $100 bottle of wine, three first dishes, four second dishes and dessert. For a special night, I thought this was right on target and we could definitely have had a wonderful dinner with a far less expensive wine to keep it in check.", "author": "Lise L."}

If you're lucky enough to have gotten a reservation a month or two prior, this is how your evening might be. You arrive at Quince's front door and the valet's are ready to take your car (better be a Euro import!) to get you onto your fairytale dining experience. Interior is conservative yet tasteful: lights dimmed low but can still see the food, hanging photos or paintings of fruit (if I recall correctly), plush seating etc., all very clubby.  Patrons are very Thurston Howell the 3rd!! The wait staff is tactically efficient, yet distant.  Wine list is good (MO'MONEY!!). You have a \"composed\" salad for starters and then Halibut or maybe Risotto, which will be tasty (MO' MONEY!!).  Ambiance will be good, you'll be able to talk with your dining companion without having to yell. Total dining experience: better have your black AmEx ready.  Sum it up:  There are better Italian restaurants in the city with less 'tude. For the money you can do better than this Chez Panisse wannabe!

We had the tasting menu with cheese supplement and wine pairings. Extraordinary is the only word I can come up with to describe the experience. The buttery red abalone, the fork-tender asparagus with ouvo frito, the incredibly rich spinach tagliatelli with lobster, the black trumpet mushroom tortellini, the guinea hen 3 ways, the sublime cheese selection and the amazingly refreshing pineapple crisp all will be remembered with fondness. The wine pairings were spot-on, maybe the best I've had. The service, however, is why I will return again and again.

It definitely helps that Chef Michael Tusk, the love child of Alice Waters and Paul Bertolli, is in the kitchen.  If you want to impress someone with a good Italian restaurant, take them to Quince.  Just plan for this meal well in advance.\n\nFood:  5 stars.  The daily changing menu had too many good options to choose from, so we opted for the tasting menu.  The tasting menu had six courses with very small portions, just the way I like it (tasting courses tend to make you feel over-stuffed by the end of the meal).  However, if you are the type that values quantity over quality, don't bother getting the tasting menu.  The tasting menu consisted of a Santa Barbara spiny lobster roasted in the shell with cauliflower and lemon verbena (brilliant), dover sole with porcini mushrooms and Villa Manodori balsamico (light, flavorful, and the highlight of the evening), stradette con porri (delicious cornmeal pasta with leek sauce), chestnut tacconi with heritage turkey, wild nettle and chanterlle mushrooms (perfectly cooked and yummy), Marin Sun Farms rib of beef with potato galette, bloomsdale spinach and horseradish (excellent blending of flavors and the potato was perfectly crisp), and sweet cream semifreddo with lime-ginger sorbetto and pomegranate caramel (delectable).  I didn't want this meal to end.\n\nService:  5 stars.  Quince is the model for good service.  The attention to detail is immaculate from start to finish and the timing was impeccable.  I felt like a king - everything was perfect, from the constantly filled water glasses to the birthday sparkler placed on the dessert (it was my friend's birthday on me - my poor wallet).  \n\nAtmosphere:  5 stars.  The tiny space screams elegance, with cream walls, beautiful chandeliers, and crown molding.  The crowd ranges from the wealthy and young to old and rustic (the geriatrics next to us used flashlights to read the menu).\n\nHits:   Dover sole, pastas (including the stradette con porri and chestnut tacconi), rib of beef, semifreddo.\n\nMisses:  Tiny space, reservations are difficult.\n\nIf You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like:  Delfina, Oliveto, Acquerello, Perbacco", "author": "Keith C."}

This location was an entirely different ambiance in the large former Myth space.  It was a large and modern space but nicely done and very inviting.  The staff was extremely friendly but the service wasn't the entirely seamless experience you expect of a place of this caliber.  Nothing big but 2-3 times where the staff seemed a bit confused and disorganized. \nMy martini came in a tiny plastic looking cup that wasn't a martini glass that I wasn't very pleased with.  The wine list was limited and had very nice bottles but also prices to boot.  Given the range of say napa cabs and the average being in the $400-500 ballpark I would have felt cheap ordering say the $180 Ladera.  We brought our own bottle and the corkage is a rather hefty $35.  There is also a 4 percent health surcharge \nadded to the bill which is the highest I've seen.\nOur first course of scallops and beet salad were superb.  The second course is all pasta and again excellent.  I thought the 3rd and main fell a bit short with the ribeye but the duck and halibut were better but nothing special.\nFor dessert we had the cheese course and I thougt the cheeses were very good but there were no dates figs or fresh fruit to go with them.  The bread and crackers provided were poorly matched with the cheese.\n\nOverall I think some of the magic of the old Quince was lost.  I really \nliked the intimate romantic ambiance of the former location better.  We came out having enjoyed our dinner but feeling that it was no place special.

I could not bring myself to put on a dress or slacks, so, I wore my Italian jeans and a Parisian top, the irony of which I'm sure was lost on the hostess who gave us an obvious once over. Anand chose jeans and a very casual Indian shirt. Thank goodness he had decent shoes, otherwise I'm certain she would have turned him away. Everyone else was wearing sport coats, ties, and god forbid, sweater vests. SO, not my scene. A small moment of tableside drama occurred when Anand needed to spit out his gum. Because the linens, were, well, linens, he was unable to spit it out, and the bathroom was occupied. I suggested he stick it under the table, old school style, you know.  That \"suggestion\" was not well received, and he eventually used a receipt from his wallet to envelope the offending chicle, and was able to smuggle it out underneath his soup bowl later. \n\nThe one thing about this place is that the service is very nice, even the valet parking dude was polite and efficient. But in some ways, the service was almost too efficient. More than once I saw our server eyeing our table from a supposedly inconspicuous spot, with his eagle eye, swooping in silently to clear our plates, barely even giving us time to mop up the sauces with a morsel of bread. Although the cuisine is \"Italian\" with a \"French twist\", the efficient service was decidedly un-European. Too cool, too slick. Some of my best European dining experiences have included a lively repartee with the staff, sometimes ending in an exchange of email addresses! Here, they did not know our names, nor did we know theirs.  Polite clones, but clones all the same.  4 stars.\n\nThe ambiance was simple and elegant, not exciting, edgy, and no rustic or eclectic edge to take it to the next level. The music was barely audible and didn't add to the dining experience. I recall an evening in Florence, where a table of very well-bred Italians burst into a celebratory song at their table, in 4 part harmony.  No, Quince is not fooling me (or anyone) into thinking that their Italian linens make it somehow more cultured.  The table of nouveau riche fools next to us had the most obnoxious conversations about money, and although the diamonds on the man and woman were truly impressive in their sheer size, their lack of taste in the rest of their attire made me feel embarrassed for them.\n\nOkay, FOOD. That is why we went here, not to make snarky comments about the clientele.  And WINE. Small wine list for by-the-glass. Neither wine I had was spectacular, but both were drinkable. \n\nFirst course - I had the scallops, which were well prepared and melt in your mouth, as all scallops should. The pea and carrot puree that accompanied it was not very impressive. My mom makes better pea soup and serves it in a big bowl. Anand had some potato leek soup thing that was so bland I almost couldn't taste it. Sorry Michael! \n\nSecond course - I had a pasta with a foie gras and vino santo sauce. The sauce was rich and delicious, but the pasta was not the right texture to maximize capturing all that delicious sauce. Wasted foie gras. 3 stars. Anand's pasta was pretty good and sausagey tasting, not sure what it was. \n\nThird course - when I'm not eating scallops and foie gras, I'm vegetarian, and I wanted a vegetarian 3rd course. I was stuck with a raviolo that was filled with cheese and egg. It was flavorful, a bit salty perhaps, but more than anything, the combination of too many rich foods (I never really found a salad or vegetable dish on the menu) were starting to take their toll. Anand's seabass was cooked nicely, again, quite salty, but the fish seemed a bit \"fishy\" to me, which was unfortunate. The spinach that came with it was not exciting, tasted like something my mom would make me eat before I'm allowed to have dessert.  I should also mention, there was a significant delay between courses. I do not like to ever have an empty table while I dine, because it makes me feel like my meal is over. Also, after waiting 20 minutes for my 3rd course to arrive, I decided I wasn't that hungry anymore. Food 3 stars. \n\nDessert - I always get dessert, and opted for the Napoleon, which is a lemon poppyseed cookie sandwich, with lemon curd in the middle (extremely egg-yolky, which is a pet peeve of mine). The yogurt mousse on top lacked the depth and tartness that might have been achieved if it were a creme fraiche instead. Instead it tasted like the chef ran out of something and used yogurt instead. The sage granita was overly sweetened, so the subtle herby flavor was lost. Disappointing, not worth the calories. 3 stars. \n\nI think Anand liked it, but I wouldn't go here again. Maybe I lack something in my personality which makes me unable to enjoy an upscale meal without picking it apart!", "author": "Darcy V."}

I agree with the description of the waitstaff was a tad formal in a pleasant, Vanna White way, but with matching suits in prim ecru instead of the flowing gown. I was happy to see a plate of thin, homemade breadsticks and bread rolls materialize-- the grissini were delicious with a kick of pepper, but the tiny bread baubles seemed like they were steeped in olive oil as baklava is to honey. The oil pooled at the bottom, exuding what felt like a half teaspoon of oil with each tepid bite. \n\nThe veal pasta was excellent. My three small cuts of lamb were very good, but nothing stellar. The eggplant, onion, and tomato towers were underspiced and a little boring, though not offensive in the least. I prefered my companion's duck breats and leg served with deliciously balanced quince compote and a leafy green. The white carrots that came with the dish were more interesting for their looks than taste. \n\nWe skipped the cheese cart, but splurged with two desserts and a latte. The wine poached pears with muscat gelato and two tiny walnut cookies perfectly balanced sweetness, flavor, and delicacy. It was amazing, but far too small for a $10 price tag. The chocolate tart-- surrounded by a subtle orange caramel sauce and topped with a slightly crunchy cloud of whipped cream-- was much better value. It was excellent, interesting, and satisfying.\n\nAt the end of the meal the waitress grandly presented us with a plate topped with two tiny cookies to share. I was pretty upset that the table next to us was offered a truffle and fruit gelee-- I would have much preferred that.\n\nOverall, the food was very good and mostly worthwhile, but Quince would benefit from relaxing its service and cinching up value.", "author": "Jessica D."}

I think the chef is always trying to make new, interesting combinations and there can be some hits and some misses, but I'd rather have a restaurant that is inventive than a restaurant that plays it safe.

It is obvious that they are trying to earn more stars but they fall short of their desire to  compete with the likes of the quality of food and service found at restaurants such as Gary Danko and Coi. \n\nWe will not be going back to what was once our favorite restaurant in the city.  One reason is how their signature dish, the Agnolotti, has changed since it's original form.   The first time that my husband tried the delicate pasta dish, it brought tears to his eyes and we became big fans of Quince based on that very dish.  But they changed the recipe since the beginning, upsetting the ratio of pasta to meat and ruining it's previous delicate, sublime character.  Now it's just good instead of extraordinary.  In fact, when we took our in-laws for what was to be a special dining night out, the agnolotti we ordered was dry on the edges.\n\nWe felt that the service, while attentive, was very impersonal.  Our bread guy was the friendliest, while the main waiter that took our order left us cold.  We had to send back a bottle of wine (note: my father-in-law is a vintner so the wine was not sent back on a whim).  Though we got a nicer bottle and were charged the lesser amount, the sommelier did not seem happy with us.  After sending the bottle back, we felt that the staff was even more standoffish.  It was just uncomfortable and the service overall lacked the flair and personal touch of a high caliber restaurant experience.  Delfina, which presents itself as a more casual restaurant, consistently has an engaging staff. \n\nThe new location has a big main room, a side room attached to the main and another offshoot room where you can look at wine bottles.  We were placed in the wine bottle room and felt hidden and out of touch with the ambiance of the main floor.  One group that came in after us refused to stay in there.  The next group seated next to our properly dressed party was a group wearing fleece and jeans. That just added to the insult of being hidden away.\n\nOverall our food was not bad. The appetizers and other pasta dishes were delicious. It's just that Quince is now lacking in the combination of service and food quality that they once had.  In order to join the ranks of high cuisine, they must be able to give the whole experience. We are sad to witness the decline of what we believed was once a restaurant easily capable of competing with the best of SF and NY spots.  Bye Bye Quince.", "author": "Amanda L."}

My reservation making capabilities were somewhat diminished by finals and the various emotional crises that go along with the end of the quarter so alas, Spruce was not for us this year. However, I lucked out with a reservation at Quince and our meal was quite enjoyable.\n\nI'm in favor of strong flavors and spice and every sentence that I have ever read or heard about Quince includes the word \"refined.\" I was afraid that refined actually meant boring, but Quince managed to be refined and delicious. I was also concerned with the level of light in the  photo they show on their web page, but it's actually dimly lit inside and well appointed. I think that the style of the dining room appeals more to women, it's sort of an elegant, sparse, and adult version of what Anthropologie attempts sell. My one complaint is that the tables are elbow to elbow along the banquet and if your neighboring tablemates are jackasses, you might be a little close for comfort, more on that later though.\n\nI had also received an earful from various sources about Quince excelling at pastas and starters and that some of their servings were on the small side. The menu is quite extensive, with 10+ options each for starters, pastas, and entrees. We lingered over the menus with glasses of champagne, after all, we were here for some pampering. After a long discussion, we went with 2 pastas and 2 entrees; I know this is an odd choice but it made sense at the time. \n\nWe started with the tagliatelle tre sughi, three separate mounds of fresh tagliatelle topped by a wild nettle pesto, a liver sauce, and a tomato sauce. Of the 3, the manfriend preferred the nettle pesto and I was torn between the delicious liver sauce (they should find a more compelling name for the liver) and the nettles. The tomato sauce was fresh but underwhelming after spending many hours with Marcella Hazan's recipes, not to mention that tomatoes aren't in season. We were warned upon ordering that our next pasta selection took longer to prepare, which was great as everything didn't come out at the same time.\n\nFoie gras and sauces made of foie are impossible to resist. The foie and vin santo sauce that topped the tubes of pasta (mostaccioli?) had a luxuriously smooth mouthfeel and did not feel restrained at all. At this point in the meal, we were sampling the house-made grissini and chile and fennel rolls and sipping on a minerally French red that I had never heard of. It was also at this point that we made note of the extremely well trained waitstaff and how they continued to deal with the biggest jackass who happened to be sitting next to me. The biggest jackass was out of place with his loud self-inflated machismo, repeated gross comments to the female staff, and annoying enological monologues interspersed with German snippets to his dining companion.  I was disgusted to learn that he had draped his arm in my personal space and fired off some German commentary to his companion, I really wish that I had \"accidently\" dropped my water in his lap. Anyway, at least he provided a spectacle for our dining entertainment and I didn't want to make a scene during the annual indulgent Christmas dinner.\n\nI was passive during entree selection as my Italian vocabulary is a bit lacking. We ended up with two yummy veal meatballs perched on swiss chard and polenta thoughtfully split onto 2 plates for us as well as a pork sausage two ways preparation. Afterwards, we realized that perhaps we should have ventured away from the meatiness but both dishes were satisfying on the chilly night. The pork sausage surprised me in that it was patty shaped, one poached and sauced atop pureed potatoes and the other fried atop cabbage. I was partial to poached saucy prep. Both of the entrees sound simple and rustic but were refined and very well prepared.\n\nAlthough initially excited by the cheese cart, we decided to finish with a blood orange souffle. All of the dessert options consisted of novel and interesting ingredient combinations. The souffle was the perfect size for two people and arrived at the table puffed and golden with a small carafe of blood orange syrup to pour in the center. Although slightly reminiscent of fruit loops, it was fresh and not overpoweringly citrusy. A nice and interesting finish to a pleasant meal. \n\nThe staff at Quince was completely professional and made dining there a relaxing experience from the moment they took my coat to when they called us a taxi. Quince promotes the same concepts as many of the restaurants in the Bay Area with seasonal, local, sourced ingredients, yet manages to feel different than the rest. The attention to details and care of the entire staff was evident making it a suitable choice for a special occasion meal. 4 stars.", "author": "Candice L."}

Actually the private room is not so private, it is in their production kitchen, which makes the atmosphere more lively than a closed room. It is called the chef's table. It can seat between 6 and 10 people. We were 8. We had a dedicated waitress with a very caring and attentive touch. She really did a fantastic job. Each time they were bringing a new course, 4 waiters would come at once, each carrying 2 plates so that we would all receive the food at the same time. You get the table for the entire evening so there is no rush and the pace of dinner was just right. We all had an appetizer, a pasta dish, and a main course, and some of us had dessert. The highlight of the dinner for me was my pasta dish: I had the raviolo and it was orgasmic.\nI really enjoyed how they did not push us to spend either. It was very classy. For instance, they allowed us to bring up to 2 bottles of wine with a $25 corkage fee, so we brought some of our very best wine. When it was time for us to order from their wine list, we were pleasantly surprised by the selection which started in the upper $40's. The waitress recommended a pinot noir at $50 that was really good.\nThere is a $800 minimum charge for the chef's table. With all that we ate, and the 25% tip we chose to give them, our total bill was less than $900. This is the cherry on the cake to this most memorable night.", "author": "Elsa T."}

The food is really fantastic and the ambiance is so cozy and delightful, but the service--Holy Crap. Seriously, the service at this restaurant was incredible. Example: my date got up to go to the restroom. Within 1 second, the hostess, standing across the room, was at our table, folding his napkin and placing it just-so on his chair. When he returned, I commented on how fast she sprang into action, while he simultaneously remarked that she had opened the door to the restroom area for him. Seriously, the wait staff is everywhere they need to be at the EXACT moment that they need to be. Never did anyone come to the table and ask how the meal was going when my mouth was embarassingly stuffed with food (which was the case during a good deal of the dinner), never did the service seem stuffy or rushed. It was perfect. When we got up to leave (after taking our sweet time over a delicious dessert), there was the hostess (again!) and a waitress standing ready with our coats poised for us to slip right into them.

I mentioned when reserving that it was my boyfriend's birthday, so when they called to confirm the res, they asked the name of the bday guest.  Well, when we arrived and checked in at the host stand, they looked up the name and wished Justin a happy birthday!  I thought, hm, that's nice.  But then when we got to our table and they gave us specially printed menus that read at the top, \"Happy Birthday Justin\" with the day's date!  It was such a lovely touch, and it set the course for a fantastic dinner.  Our server, William, was fantastic - knowledgeable without being pretentious, perfectly attentive without being overly so, with just the right touch of humor.  We ordered the fish and shellfish tasting menu, with pairings.  I tried things I never really liked before - such as sea urchin and octopus - and was very impressed because those difficult dishes were done TO PERFECTION!  The pairings were exquisite, and really enhanced the food (or the food enhanced the wine, or both).  In addition to the 6 courses listed, there was an amuse bouche, a pre-dessert, and an additional course (with pairing) in the middle of the meal that the chef sent out since it was Justin's birthday, so we were totally spoiled, and at the end, quite stuffed!  They really went out of their way to make it a great birthday dinner.  It was an incredible experience, and one we will not soon forget.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-04-09", "description": "I took my boyfriend here for his birthday this week.  I have heard so many great things about Quince and have been so looking forward to trying it out.  Let me start out by saying that I really wanted to love it like so many other people on Yelp.  I also have eaten at many of our area's other fine dining destinations (Gary Danko, Michael Mina, Aqua, Boulevard, French Laundry, etc.) and so I definitely have some places to which I can compare Quince.\n\nFirst, the services was great.  They were pretty attentive, though we did sit and wait a bit before we were greeted by our server.  He was very knowledgeable and helpful throughout the meal.  One thing that I did notice that seemed out of place in a restaurant as nice as Quince was the condition of the bathroom.  There is only one unisex bathroom and both times that I went in there, the seat was left up.  So, using my heel, I lowered the seat.  I just thought it seemed strange for a restaurant this nice (and expensive).\n\nOn to the food - let me first say - the pasta is reason enough to come here.  It was truly amazing, and had I known better, I would have skipped all other courses and just ordered only off the pasta course.  But, I didn't know, so we ordered a little of everything.  They were good, not outstanding (sformato and frog legs were good for the first time trying them), but COLD!!!  Yes, they came out cold.  We didn't say anything because I thought this was maybe how they were supposed to be served.  The next course was the pasta (pappardelle and tortelloni) - and all was good in the world again.  Truly outstanding.  And, then, the meat course.  We got the lamb roast and the pork belly & loin.  The lamb was good - again, not outstanding.  The pork was just plain bad.  It had a taste that I would describe as unpleasant and again came to our table COLD.  WTF?  We sent it back this time because clearly it wasn't supposed to come that way.  Let me also point out that I am often way too polite and very rarely send anything back.  We didn't even finish the dish, and we are certainly big eaters.  And, there wasn't much in the way of an apology for the cold dish.  Lastly, came the dessert - the panna cotta.  I love dessert of all races, shapes, and sizes.  This one just didn't taste like much.\n\nLet me break down the cost - we had 2 glasses of champagne, a bottle of Barolo (around $85), 2 glasses of Sauternes, 2 apps, 2 pastas, 2 meat dishes, and 1 dessert.  I know it's a lot !  It all came to just under $400.  For that much money, I really would have expected something much more impressive.\n\nMy boyfriend is still reeling that I paid that much money for dinner when I could have put that money towards new golf clubs.  I agree.  Bummer.", "author": "Amy K."}

If I hadn't seen it listed in Zagat and Michelin, I probably wouldn't have ever known it existed myself.  We actually got reservations quite easily, considering we called about 2 weeks ahead and we were a party of 6.  The restaurant is small, but I enjoyed the intimate setting.  The atmosphere felt inviting, comforting, and still elegant without feeling too stuffy or pretentious.  I really enjoyed the ambiance much more than many other fine dining establishments I've been to. \n\nLet me just say the service here is phenomenal!  Everyone is very friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, and not at all obtrusive.  They have a lot of staff, so there is always someone paying attention to your table and ready to serve you anytime.  I also appreciated that they use high quality wine glasses and brought out appropriate glasses for pinot noir.  Not many places go out of their way to bring out the appropriate type of glass.\n\nShall I talk about the food now?  Let me start with the bread, because it was so delicious!  They give you these little focaccia rolls and crispy bread sticks, and they are fantastic!  Being a party of 6, our bread plate went super fast, but they quickly replaced it with a new batch.  \n\nNow the Quince menu changes daily, so not everything is served daily.  I'm also having a hard time remembering the name of each dish, so excuse me for my poor memory.  For starters, the most memorable dish was the rabbit salad.  The rabbit was cooked perfectly and the flavor was fantastic.  The veal prepared in 2 ways was also excellent and highly recommended.  The sardine salad was good, but nothing special and the calamari was just ok.  I had the squash soup which was nice and creamy and had excellent flavors.  Not spectacular though.  Second course was all homemade pasta dishes and probably the most interested selection of the entire menu.  The ricotta raviolo was the best dish that we ordered and it was heavenly.  Basically a single large ravioli drenched in butter and baked to perfection.  The skate was actually kind of fishy and my least favorite.  The smoked eel was excellent as well and so was the roasted quail pasta.  For entrees, my favorite was the turbot.  It has a crispy skin and the meat of the fish was so moist and flakey.  The monkfish and the lamb were also excellent choices. The duck was cooked perfectly, but probably the least interested dish of them all.\n\nAnd we can't forget dessert right?  We ordered one of everything, so we could try it all!  The pear creme brulee is to die for!  I would definitely order it again and next time i'll eat it all by myself!  The affogato was good too, and the souffle was fantastic.  The chocolate truffle was the least interesting, but still good.  \n\nOverall I had a very good experience at Quince and the excellent service really made the evening go well.  Not every dish on the menu is fantastic, which is why I give 4 stars, but I would definitely go back again.  I really enjoyed that the menu provided something different from what your typical fine dining/french menu might have and there was actually a lot to choose from.  Next time I will definitely have to get the chef's tasting menu, which sounded amazing.", "author": "Mai S."}

Quince is by far my favorite and in my opinion the best restaurant in San Francisco.  Quince has managed to capture a casual state of elegance which transcends not only the food but the visual aesthetic of the room, service, lighting, flower arrangements, etc.  From the moment you step into the warm and welcoming room of Quince you feel comfortable but are aware that the experience you are about to part take in will be special.  The food is stellar.  Plan to eat very thoughtfully prepared homemade pastas.  The menu changes daily and always has plenty of delightful choices.

Could the enormous overhead they have assumed in the new place made them more pushy and even pretentious and overbearing?  I was certainly made to feel like an ignorant freshman after we received the drill from our solemn server.  I had asked beforehand if everyone had to go with the pre-fixe dinner or a requisite number of courses. On the phone I was reassured not. My guests and I could order as we pleased. But our server clearly stated otherwise. And if we insisted, we'd be paying as much anyway so why not just \"go with what the chef wants.\" Geez! What an overbearing dictatorial chef. He/she should replace Ghadafy in Libya then, where people like this would be made to feel what they deserve--- abject disdain!\n\nThe food could have been good.

My Point: This place is too good.\n\nIf you are a lover of pasta and still manage to eat carbs nowadays, this is the place for you - the chef is known for his pasta creations and with sound reasoning, they were FAN-tastic! (Okay, I don't say shit like that, but it felt right for this specific pasta).\n\nI recommend (although the menu frequently changes):\n * The fig salad - very simple and a great, light start to a meal.\n * The Louisiana White Shrimp - I thought this was my least favorite thing I got , but I did like the lightness of the flavors and the textures of the shrimp and black tomatoes.  There was too much that I wanted so I would probably try something else next time.\n * THE RAVIOLO - omg! The best singular piece of food, in general, that I have ever tasted.  It is almost painful.  This better be on the menu when I go back . . .yeah, that's a threat.\n * The Angel Hair w/Caviar - Very delicious and creamy, but I did not want to finish it so I could save more room for dinner.  I would probably not get this again, but once again, b/c there are just too many other pasta choices here.\n * The Red Beam - great fish dish, light but I couldn't finish it all at this point b/c I was waiting for the dessert menu.\n * The strawberry tart - sounds simple, but it done really, really well.  I wanted two and the waitress threatened to have the kitchen bring me another one  - dessert on the house, round two, could this place get any better?\n * The chocolate Marshmallow cake - it was pretty good, but I'm not really a huge chocolate fan (except for that time of the month) and it all had the texture of a homemade marshmallow so I have to admit, that was a bit unsettling.\n * The wine selection here is great - I usually just call over the Sommelier and tell them what I'm looking for in what type of wine and they help me pick a good one out - Quince's Sommelier went one step further and let me even try samples of certain wines she thought I would like but which I typically don't drink b/c I usually am not a fan of - all in all - she knew her shit.\n\nI really liked this place and I would tell anyone I know to go there, you'll be sure to have a great meal and a good time", "author": "Lauren G."}

I would definitely come here to set the mood. The menu features some of the best farm fresh California ingredients. Tusk the chef from the Chez Panisse Paul Bertoli school of thought does really exciting authentic Italian food. He takes a beautiful ingredient and just highlights it. \n     For a first course you might find Vitello Tonnato which is a classic poached veal loin served with tuna belly poached in olive oil then pured into a mayonnaise using the oil it was poached in with anchovy, garlic and lemon. Then served with roasted peppers, celery and fried capers. You might also find artichokes served 3 ways. A Fig and peach arugula salad with toasted hazelnuts and aged balsamic or Fried oysters with dry farm tomatoes stuffed with remoulade sauce.  \n     The reason you come to Quince in the first place is the second course, the pasta course. 10-15 fresh pastas are made daily. I will list just a few. \n     Tajarin a thin hand cut pasta from northern Italy served with liver and onions; this is incredible. Tagiolini with Dungeness crab, Tagliatelle with fresh white truffles or maybe Pappardelle with braised rabbit or pig. You can't go wrong. Stinging nettle Gnocchi with Bolognese sauce is so light and rich at the same time. Really impressive is the Pici noodles which are a type hand formed spaghetti (this is a time taking task); this is possibly served with a lamb sugo. Bigoli noodles from Venice cooked in pancetta bean broth with tomato and hot pepper is probably my favorite.  Tomato stamped pasta often served with clams and white wine broth. \nAgnolotti with veal, rabbit, and pork farce served in a butter sauce is classic. The Carmelli candy shaped pasta is filled with celery root pure served in  butter sauce topped with aceto balsamico and parmigiano-Reggiano. I could go on and on, but I know I have to stop now.\n     The fish is spectacular here. Sockeye salmon, corn with a prosecco squash blossom sauce blew my mind. Or seared scallops chanterelles and truffle butter sauce. Maybe the best scallops I have ever had. If you see the crusted sole on the menu get it!\n     I happen to know Quince gets in whole lamb and pigs. Chef Tusk will use all the parts of the animal all over the menu from stocks, broths, stuffing's, sauces for pasta, house made pancetta and lamb 5 ways on your plate. Very rustic and very satisfying.  \n    The cheese and desserts are great. The fresh fruit they serve with it is not the typical garnish that you find in most old school desserts. They actually taste amazing. Not like those couple of raspberries you get with whatever chocolate dessert you have that have no flavor what so ever. Seasonal fresh farm ingredients do make the difference.\n\n     I suggest the tasting menu, but I almost always do. The wine list is beautiful and not too expensive. I do think service is just OK, but getting better; Consistency is not there yet, but overall I love this restaurant. I come here for the pasta and the fish.

This place has good execution, fresh ingredients, a quaint high-end atmosphere, friendly knowledgeable waitstaff, and excellent desserts... what else can you ask for!  ...A small ask is for piping hot food and that's also what we got!  (you'd be surprised how many nice places try to get away with tepid food)\n\nQuince is the epitome of California cuisine, relying on the freshness of the produce and other ingredients and a bit of creativity to carry the dishes.  While taking some risk, the chef also manages to make quite complementary combinations. From the chili leaf/anise/olive oil dinner rolls (best bread ever!) to the petit fours (apricot gelee, yogurt meringue, etc.), my taste buds and intellectual food curiosity were continually titillated. The semi-rustic approach justified its lack of brilliant presentations, while the execution of flavors and beautifully arranged desserts fully make up for that small void.\n\nQuince's small dining room is pretty dark so the candle light and oddly intriguing, Gaudi-like chandeliers made for a very romantic setting.  The warmness of the room paired incredibly well with the approach of the food and friendliness of the staff.  I was surprisingly impressed with how well-versed, smiley, and approachable the waitstaff proved to be for a venue that I could never get reservations at before... Despite the size of the room and approximately one staff member to every three diners, the room demonstrated only a bit of chaos, mostly organized chaos.  A few minor, but astonishingly rare service treats: the timing between courses were perfectly under 6 minutes, the dishes were removed immediately after we were done eating, and the waiter made a real effort to show the wine label while pouring.  Ah, a sign of impeccable training!\n\nUnder the 4-course tasting, between the two of us, we had the following (mostly delish):\n1a) Japanese octopus, fresh chickpea, cherry tomato and coriander\n      * Very tender preparation and extremely fresh chickpea medley\n      * The gnocchi looked good too, but I chose this over the gnocchi\n1b) Sea scallops, corn and ovoli mushroom\n      * Ever-so-sweet corn\n\n2a) Spaghetti with sea urchin\n      * Potent, yet homey flavored uni; nicely al dente, freshly made pasta\n2b) Agnolotti dal plin, traditional Piedmontese filled pasta\n      * Slightly sweetened, delicately prepared veal\n\n3a) Jones Ranch rabbit wrapped in speck, sweet pepper flan, romanesco broccoli and savoy cabbage\n      * Melt in your mouth rabbit\n3b) Watson Farm lamb, taggiasche olive filled sweet 100 tomato, peperonata and wild arugula\n      * Average lamb and slightly chewy preparations; strange olive arrangement\n\n4a) Red velvet cake, Santa Rosa plum, cream cheese and sarawak pepper\n      * A creative collection of flavors and textures; the plum sorbet and fresh slice were refreshing; the pepper glass was a nice surprise\n4b) Gianduja cheesecake, elderflower and cocoa nib gelato\n      * Innovative hazelnut ganache-like preparation; however, the elderflower gelato tasted like armpit or durian, take your pick\n\nI drool just recalling the delectable meal!  Every restaurant should be so thoughtful in their overall approach!", "author": "T D."}

We came in town for a business dinner with clients and were excited to try Quince out because of the great reviews and it came highly recommended.  They were able to squeeze us in since we were only in town for the night and put us at a fabulous table in the middle of the restaurant.  We sat down, got the menus and our waitress (I believe her name was Casey) came over and greeted us and brought us some items to sample.  One of our clients ordered a bottle of wine and sampled it, but as they started to look over the menu, they realized it was going to be a long dinner and we came in from Houston and it was 10:00pm our time.  Our clients were going to leave and find another spot to eat and we couldn't let them go on their own since we were there to entertain them.  We explained the situation to our waitress and asked if we could settle up.  They said since we didn't order anything we didn't owe anything.  We said please charge us for the wine or something because they brought out samples as well, but they were very friendly and understanding about the whole situation.  I still feel so bad that we had to leave but I cannot commend the restaurant enough!  They were very considerate about our situation and were still friendly to us as we left.  Then, I received a call on Monday from someone at the restaurant saying they wanted to send us a gift card in hopes that one of our guests would eat there if they made it back that way.  I was flabbergasted!  I hope to be back in San Francisco soon and make a stop at Quince.  What an incredible place!", "author": "Kathryn I."}

It's such a beautifully little restaurant with lots of delicate touches, like the fresh yellow flowers that mimic the curvature of the dimly lit chandeliers, and all the wait staff dressed in brown suits. The service was superb. It must have been a ratio of 6 guests to 1 server. Water glasses hardly dropped below 40% full, dishes were subtly removed and replaced, food was always presented hot the way I like it. And they smiled.\n\nThe food was amazing too. Rather, the pasta was what was outstanding for me. I typically don't like ordering pasta but at Quince, how can you not. \n\n1) We tried the a linguine pasta with crab in a lemon meyer sauce. DELISH! It was really light and delicate and made me hate having to share.\n2) Also had a medallion shaped pasta with lobster. This was in a creamy red sauce but it wasn't drenched which allowed you to taste the lobster. I don't know if I'm a fan of the round disk pastas but I ended up tucking my lobster chunks in the middle, folding over the circle and forking it up like a taco. Still good.\n3) For my main, I couldn't resist the Duck w/ Pistachio Sausage. Slices of perfectly cooked duck (medium rare) were artfully accompanied by a 3 slice tower of potatoes, a mini clump of veggies and 2 slices of sausage. So the portions aren't big obviously but all were prepared w/ care. My only complaint is that the duck and sausage were a little too salty. Given the lack of a starch (3 slice potatoes don't count), the duck could have had less sauce/salt. That was true of the sausage as well. \n* My companion had the Salt Veal. The idea is that the salt seals in the juices to make the veal tender. The veal was tender but it lacked flavor at least in comparison to the duck. The potatoes au gratin were really rich and creamy though. \n4) Dessert: Coconut Caramel Souffle. It takes about 15 minutes longer but it was really good. Light yet dense. Maybe cuz of the caramel. The flavor was so nice and light but decadent too. Really good.\n\nOverall Quince was superb for its pastas and desserts. I wasn't impressed by the 3rd courses though, especially at starting prices of $30. Nevertheless, the total ambience, service, and quaint location all lend to give it the 4 stars. I would love to go back and simply try the pastas. Excellent!", "author": "Cindy W."}

Even with the misses I would give this place 5 stars except one major issue, what is going on with dessert?!  I've been here many times now, and only once did I have a truly delicious dessert.  Something worthy of all that staff and the price tag and attention to detail. Look, I can do simple and perfectly showcasing the amazing ingredients, but once at the end of an interesting, special, and totally enjoyable if not altogether successful squash blossom tasting menu, my friend and I were served a completely insipid fruit soup with some not so perfect berries and melon lurking in it.  We were incredulous.  Springing for the tasting menu, and that's all you got for us?  We couldn't go out like that so we ordered another dessert,  it was also mediocre: some warm almond pudding cake with apricots or something- sounds way better than it was.\n\nI'm curious to see if they will be able to keep the cozy intimacy when they move locations.

On the bright side, the service was great - efficient, friendly, not at all stuffy - I felt the upscale neighborhood vibe.  The wine that was recommended was great and within the budget that we set.  I had a pasta - agnoletti (sp?) that was absolutely to die for.  However, I think there are just too many choices for each course.  This is a strange thing to complain about in this city - I swear, there were 10 or 12 choices for the appetizer and then for the pasta second course, and it was way too overwhelming.  I felt very lost - everything looked so good, what if I make the wrong choice?  My husband lost on that one - his goose ragu was very underseasoned and just ho-hum.  The 2 main courses we picked we didn't like at all - my cod was dry, very dry, and his duck was pretty flavorless, served with sandy spinach.\n\nI think I would feel more comfortable giving it a 3.5 stars if I could.  I really do recommend it enough to think that anyone would enjoy themselves.", "author": "Melissa G."}

The dining room is decorated like someone's home but small.  At one point I counted no less than 12 staff in the room going from table to table and standing right next to us against the mirror, by the door or back of the room.  It just felt...uncomfortable.  The service was excellent, but when you see 4 of them standing right in front of the door in their suits like that, I was expecting the President of the US to be walking in any minute and this was the Secret Service team sans sunglasses.  \nThe food was good, or \"OK\" as our friends who dined there last year thought as well.  We started off with the Japanese octopus with eggplant and the tomato salad.  Meh.  The 2nd course - cheese stuffed tortelloni with sugar-coated walnuts, an interesting blend of flavor.  The Bavette (zucchini blossoms & pasta) was very good but most of the dishes thus far had too much oil in it.  3rd course - I didn't care much for the sea bass but the duck was very good, even better than the one at Gary Danko's.  \nThe choc terrine was too sweet for me, a very chocolately rectangular piece of thick gateau with peaches.  The blood orange tea came in a tiny clear glass teapot and the tea was poured into a clear glass pitcher, reminded me of the mascot pitcher for Kool-Aid and you poor the contents of that into a tiny clear cup.  It felt like I was having tea in a doll house.  Coffee is brought in a 2 cup coffee press.  They printed \"Happy Anniversary\" on top of the tasting menu for the day with our names.  AND gave us 2 copies of that menu to take home for souvenirs.  Sweet.", "author": "Ry T."}

Overall, it was a fine evening, but I left wondering what all the hype is about - especially at this price.\n\nThe restaurant and bar is very handsome and comfortable, but the service was hit and miss  We arrived on time for our reservation and the hostess said it would be about 5 minutes, which was great because we could have a cocktail and sit in the lounge area.  Unfortunately the only seating for four people was a table that had not been cleared from the previous guests.  There are so many staff running around that we felt like we needed to get out of the way and sat at the open table.  It took quite a while to get our drinks ordered and then longer than I would expect to have them delivered.  While we were waiting for our drinks (which was well over 5 minutes, but would not have been too bad if we had a cocktail in hand), the hostess came to tell us our table was ready and they would deliver the drinks to our table.  We followed her to the back of a restaurant and rounded a corner and she stopped us because apparently the table was not ready.  We stood there in the middle of the walkway with waiters trying to get by with plates of food as she headed back to the stand to work things out.  She then led us back to the front, where the table we had been at was now occupied, so we had to wait in front of the hostess stand and were then brought our drinks to us standing in the middle of the entry way.  Finally, the table was ready and we were led to a back room that looks like it is normally used for private parties.\n\nThe view of the wine cellar through the brick wall and the venetian chandelier were attractive, but the rest of the room felt a little like a boardroom at an upscale hotel.  The service continued to be hit or miss, with a friendly and outgoing waiter, but a surly busboy, and a sommelier that came across as one of those wine snobs that make you feel a little inferior.\n\nAnyway, on to the food.  The amuse was a small taste of chilled green soup (due to a noisy party next to us did not hear the contents) and a small battered frog leg.  Taste was nothing special and more noted for the novelty of eating frog leg for some in our party.\n\nFor starters, we had the corn soup, guinea hen terrine, and squash blossoms.  All solid, but I felt the corn soup was again nothing special other than a unique presentation.\n\nFor the pasta course, we had fagotelli with ricotta, cherry tomato, and basil and agnolotti dal plin stuffed with what I believe was chicken, veal, and rabbit.  The agnolotti was good and probably the best course I had  all evening.  The fagotelli, shared by two others, got the biggest raves of the night.\n\nFor entrees, we had the duck, sea bass, rabbit, and bollito misto - all solid, but nothing to rave about.  By this time it was 11:15 and one in our party had a 6:30 AM plane to catch and the others were headed to the wine country, so we decided to skip desert and call it a night.\n\nOverall a fine evening, with only one major snafu, but nothing in my mind to draw me back considering the price and other great options in San Francisco.  The check came to more than $400 and they apparently comped our cocktails, although they never apologized or told us they were doing so. The pasta and atmosphere in the main dining room were definitely the stars of the evening.", "author": "Randel K."}

After we did order, the oxtail I had was really good. I also had a pasta with butter and sage sauce which was amazing. But my boyfriend got a veal which literally tasted like the Salisbury steak you get in high school cafeterias. It was tough and bland. If the waiter hadn't been so rude he definitely would have sent it back but it was our last course and we just wanted to get out of there.

They actually had printed a birthday greeting to me at the top of the menu--a nice surprise! The sfaff was very formal. The food was interesting and good. The tea service was perfect. However, we did have one problem:\nWhen our main courses were served, both my husband and I wanted to add some salt. We spent several minutes surveying the dining room to try to get someone from waitstaff to bring us some promptly. At that moment, our waiter was bidding other patrons farewell so he was unavailable for a couple of minutes--problem #1--our meals were cooling down while we waited for salt.\nWhen he came to our table, upon request, brought us salt and pepper mills. When I twisted the salt mill over my gnocchi, it dumped our an excessively generous amount (not just a sprinkle) of salt, thus oversalting part of my dish. We did not have time to have my dish re-done, nor did I want to make my husband hold back on his main course, so I just ate around the oversalted part of my dish.\nI later told Michael that I thought the salt mill may have malfunctioned and he didn't seem to pay heed: he didn't pick it up to have it checked out. Eventually the mill was removed by a saff member along with our dessert dishes.\nI emailed the restaurant about this issue twice and received no response--a bit surprising!

The last meal that comes to mind of a personal touch was Fifth Floor where they actually made a desert for me that said my name along with a message praising me for my good grades in school. \n\nQuince had a similar way of treating their customers by making a custom menu for my brother who we were having a celebratory dinner for because of his acceptance into Med School. It was a simple gesture yet impressive nonetheless and constitutes a restaurant that truly wants to impress their customers. \n\nWhile I certainly have had my fair-share of delicious and food, I was not really sure what to expect from the restaurant. My friend is close friends with the head chef who was a former chef for Chez Panise (talk about connections) and he only held favorable things to say about his cooking and restaurant.  The menu was seemingly basic and seasonal which is good to see from restaurants. Everyone in my family ordered something different  so that we wouldn't get the same thing and we were served a bread basket that was excellent. The funny thing was that the servers continued to replenish it without even provoking them which some restaurants tend not to do but was a welcome surprise. I had a crab gnocchi and it was relatively simple, delicate and just plain delicious. For main course I had a lamb trio (lamb served three ways: rack, rib, loin) which was also top-notch.  For desert I had a choclate cake with caramel ice cream and caramel corn. It was finished with some little macaroons and candies. \n\nOverall Quince delivers exactly what you want: A sophisticated dinner experience tailored to the customer.

Nice touch.\n\nLike other reviewers, we also enjoyed the bread plate, but it was too greasy for our liking.  My husband said they were like \"little donuts\".\n\nAt $10 for corn soup (incredibly sweet and more of a potage than a chowder) and $18 for ravioli (albeit nettle-flavored pasta stuffed with house smoked ricotta and garnished with a contrast of sultanas), this is one of the most expensive kids meals in town.  My toddler didn't care too much for the shredded nasturtium garnish on the soup, but he did like everything else.\n\nThe pastas are excellent and were better than the main courses.  Appetizers didn't seem much to rave about.  Next time, I'll order 2 pastas plus dessert and cheese. \n\nOur main server didn't seem to have a very good grasp of the menu.  When questioned, she developed a blank look on her face, paused, and then started to blandly recite descriptions as if drawing from some place deep in her memory.  It was hard to get excited about the food because she was so unenthusiastic about it herself.  \n\nOn the other hand, the sommelier was much more knowledgeable and engaging.  The other staff members were terrific and at one point, I had 3 different people direct me to the bathroom (just in case I didn't know which \"back right corner\" they were referring to).\n\nThe restaurant has great ambience and feels cozy yet sophisticated, but the noise level is pretty high.

Unfortunately, our experience was just OK.  On the positive side, the decor is very tasteful and classy.  The service was very attentive, bringing by tiny breads and water as soon as needed.  On the negative side, the champagne by the glass was a less than generous fill.  The two first courses we had, octopus and fluke tartar, were well done.  With the second course of pastas, the buckwheat pasta was tough but the other ravioli was fine - but we remember the pastas being spectacular in the past.  The third course which we both had was sea bass and it was disappointing - overall bland and the fish was dry and a bit overcooked.  I mentioned this to the waiter at the end of the meal - his response was that he would mention it to the chef and nothing more was offered.  So in summary, it was just not worth the price.", "author": "Ross J."}

The color palate is lovely, the light fixtures are gorgeous and the flower arrangements are perfect. It's beautiful and the perfect special occasion restaurant. The food itself is really, really good but not quite amazing. My husband and I did the four course prix fixe, the highlight of his meal was the lobster salad. It was amazing, beautiful presentation, the lobster was succulent and the blood orange in the salad was a perfect counterpoint to the delicate lobster flavor. The pastas here are amazing, my trenette with sweatbreads and peas was incredible. This was the first time I truly appreciated how much complexity and flavor can exist in a single piece of pasta. The pasta was al dente and had amazing flavor, it was like I could taste the quality of the flour and egg they used. It was one of the most basic yet complexly delicious bites of food I've ever had. If only they could have carried that through to their proteins. My duck was only okay and it was served to me lukewarm on a super hot plate which confused me. After the amazing pasta, the duck was a major letdown. The rhubarb tart that I got for dessert kind of made up for the poor execution on the duck, it was a refreshing finish to an overall delicious meal.", "author": "Cathy T."}

First, most of the offered dishes were too salty. I like my food well seasoned but even for me it was way too liberal on salt.  Next, the size of the dishes where you pay at least $95 per person was way too miniscule. Again, we are very familiar with what a usual fine dining dish should be, having a pleasure to dine at various great restaurants in SF,  LA and NY, and the size of the dishes was the smallest out of all. On top of that, we were overcharged for the wine, but I believe it was an honest mistake. Overall, don't think I'll be back here.

The wait staff and hostess, who I believe was one of the owners, had more attitude than the food had flavor.  Our meal, which consisted of several courses -- as would be imagined -- was neither interesting nor original.  The scallops were barely edible, drenched in what seemed like mayonnaise and nearly raw.  There was also another fish course (maybe Char) and a meat course.  In fact, it was so non-descript and disappointing that the bad taste has overwhelmed my memory and I have simply forgot what else was ordered.  The wine was fine, which was the only thing that saved the evening.  My wallet was $500 lighter for the two of us on our departure, which is not insignificant and is not a problem if worth it, but this was not worth it and I was glad to leave.   \r\n\r\nSo, not sure why Quince has garnered any fuss.

If we were doing a booze cruise or pub crawl we would have been happy.  The amount of alcohol we were served for our tasting menu would have been more than anyone could consume and remain conscious.

This is definitely a special occasion place located in a residential area of Pac Heights.  The chef is Michael Turk who was previously at Chez Panisse and Oliveto.  Their menu changes daily and like uber gourmet fine dining the portions are small.  You have the choice of a 4 course menu or the chef's tasting menu which is a few more courses.  I did the 4 course and thought the dishes were hit and miss.  I had the red velvet cake for dessert because I love it but found this version to be dry and not that great.  Also had a pasta dish that sucked.  Overall I would give it 3 stars.  Be prepared to throw down a lot of money.  for 2 of us it was over 400 bucks.  Ouch.", "author": "TravelBug W."}

Dined here the day after xmas (friday night) and everything was excellent. The space is beautiful, small but not overly cramped. There is probably one staff member per customer, but we didnt feel like they were hovering. Wine list is huge, we chose a Souve (spelling) white that was delicious and not wildly overpriced. Bread was great and tasted like it was baked fresh for each table. The tree of us shared two appetizers-sea scallops and a mixed green salad with hazelnuts, cheese and a citrus fruit, both were delicious. Portions are small but in a good way. For entree I had the Agnolotti filled with three minced meats and topped with fresh parmigianno regianno. The pastas are handmade and each piece of my agnolotti was hand cut and filled and a perfect texture. Sister had the chicken which was very flavorful and the spinach with it was delicious. Mom had the duck which was excellent and didnt taste gamey at all. Dessert was equally amazing, we had the gingerbread souffle which was very subtle and perfectly fluffed, with a stronger gingerbread taste towards the bottom. We also had a 3 cheese plate and i think these were some of the best cheeses i have ever had. The waitress was extremely knowledeable and described each pasta and each cheese extensively. I would haven eaten there again the next night, and will dream about this place in the future", "author": "Sara B."}

For an expensive restaurant the wines by the glass did provide options, lowest price being $10 I believe and up from there. Service though as lackluster for what should be a fine dining experience all around. Wine glasses sat empty, dirty plates sat much too long, no tap water was served and questions about the menu were not answered well. For example, a dish came missing an ingredient as stated on the menu and the server could not answer why, nor tried. $18...$19 for pastas do seem a bit steep...", "author": "B.M. B."}

We had the sweetbreads and scallops, which were tender and flavorful.   The pastas were incredible and obviously freshly made.  And the lamb and veal were both excellent, which seems like such an understatement now.

While I had no major complaints with the meal, the experience wasn't quite as transcendent as I had expected.  The scallop starter with chanterelles was light and a great way to begin the meal.  My second course, the bucatini all'amatriciana, was perfectly done and I highly recommend it.  For the third course, I had the lamb three ways, which was a little disappointing.  None of the flavors really stood out and 2 of the 3 preparations tasted pretty similar.  For dessert, I shared a concoction made of chocolate gelati, some kind of cheese (I want to say mascarpone but am not positive) and some other stuff.  The wait staff was very attentive and in general the service was great.  The room itself is very intimate and seemed to be a good spot for celebrating anniversaries (I counted 3 while I was there) with dim lighting, etc.  However, the tables are pretty close together and the chairs aren't very comfortable.  I can see why many Yelpers would give the place 5 stars, but I'm pretty stingy with them with regards to higher-end restaurants.  I would consider going back for a romantic occasion.", "author": "Saw T."}

Dined here several times, always an exceptional meal until this weekend.  Started with cocktails at the bar, and offered stale potato chips. We laughed, thinking this was a minor oversight in a restaurant noted for attention to detail.  Sadly, the meal deteriorated rapidly.  Not to dwell on too many details, but I think the kitchen was overwhelmed on a Saturday night.  First courses were fine when they finally appeared, after a long wait.  The pasta course came out of the kitchen luke warm at best, clearly sitting around for a while before served.  The sauces were starting to congeal as they cooled.  Not acceptable for a 19-20 dollar course. Several at the table with different pastas noticed the same thing.  The mains were so-so, my suckling pig was an undistinguished serving, a bit underdone with none of the crispy skin one associates with this dish.  My wife's sweetbreads were better.  I was also disappointed with the tired cheeses offered from the cart, although by this point my judgement may have been clouded by prior events.  In sum, I expect near perfection from Quince, and this evening they were far from it.  Hopefully just a bad night, will return one more time to see if this is a recurring theme.", "author": "Richard R."}

The pasta dishes were light, fresh and flavorful. I had the lobster ravioli; the only pasta that I had that was comparable was at a 3-star restaurant in Paris called Ledoyen. Nothing was over-sauced or over-done. The portions are a very good size, especially since everything is so rich and yummy. Price is not bad either. People were nice... not \"stuffy.\" The service was great. Our waitress was very helpful and friendly.

If you are looking for a meal this place fits the profile, but if you are looking for a true dinning experience then this place surpasses all expectations. Sure it's pricey, but worth it. This place runs like a well oiled machine. Everything is done in synchronized fashion it's unbelievable. My first time to Quince about five months ago and I didn't know what to expect. To my surprise, since that time I've had the best lobster salad with cucumber granite, freshly made pasta like gnocchi stuffed with eggplant and mozzarella, seared sea scallops and more... Since the menu changes daily you can eat there multiple times and have difference experiences. If you have a birthday they even print your birthday on the menu and send over a nicely wrapped scroll menu when you go. For anyone who is worried that this place might be pretentious- take it from me they do an amazing job at making the restaurant like a small neighborhood joint. Service is impeccable.

For the price, I expected everything to be exceptional and it wasn't that memorable. The best dish was the persimmon salad, very creative and fresh. The butter ricotta ravioli was a major disappointment, didn't like it at all. The foie gras pasta was only ok, the version at myth was much more flavorful and tastier.  The lamb was mediocre.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-02-08", "description": "It has been for years that my wife persisted on dining at Quince. So, finally I was able to get a reservation and to celebrate her birthday there believing that Quince will be one of those places that would make us feel special. We really wanted to fall in love with this restaurant, especially that we read so many fabulous reviews, as being one of the best if not the best restaurant in San Francisco.\n\nWell, if this is the case I shell never eats in any other SF restaurant. Fortunately, this is not the case. As residents of the Bay Area for nearly forty years we continue to dine in a whole host of fantastic restaurants in SF.\n\nQuince, however, was a major disappointment. The words on the menu were very mouth-watering, but that's as far as it went. As is expected we ordered three courses each. While the pasta dish was excellent the two other courses were bad to mediocre. Both of us returned the main courses as the meats were chewy and gristly and my lamb had a metallic flavor. These were exchanged for other dishes that were not much better. The three cheeses we ordered following dinner were also not impressive. So, besides the pastas the only notable thing was the wine we brought ourselves for corkage fee of $35 per bottle. \nThe service itself seams to be out of the ordinary. The restaurant appeared to have lot of front room personnel and in my mind I questioned what they were actually there for, especially that the room was very undersized.  In fact, I thought it was somewhat ostentatious creating unnecessary traffic. Perhaps, the attempt was to provide good service, but for my test it looked too...tacky ceremonial.\n\nWe will definitely not be back - sadly, too many disappointing dishes even at half the price. With all the respect to those enthusiasts that rave about this restaurant in my opinion it is grossly overrated and overpriced.", "author": "Jerry B."}

After walking by for months and watching them create their hand made pasta, I was ready to dive in. Interior of the restaurant is warm and welcoming. You feel as though you are in a private home while dining. Entire atmosphere is done right...the music, servers and lighting are all exceptional. The fare is delicious. Although portions are small. Be prepared to do a tasting in order to feel satiated. We started with the tuna three ways appetizer which was good, but not their forte. Then had the cheese gnocchi and the lobster pasta. Delicious and so light but rich, if you know what I mean. Dente had the chicken. Superb. I had the lamb dish. Yummy. As for beverages, we were taking it easy because of the night before. But their wine list is extensive and they pour some really unique beers. Also, when I wasn't sure if I wanted the Chianti or the Cabernet, our server brought me a tasting of each. Had the cab by the glass. We did not order dessert, but were treated with the most delicious ice cream. A vanilla orange, nutty confection. And then before the check came a petite truffle and some other sweets. Nice touch. Lastly, they personalized the menu with a happy birthday greeting.

Probably 6-7 times in the old location and 1 in the new.  I've always liked but not loved the food.  Everything I've had at Quince has been of high quality, but I've never had anything that wow'ed me.  I repeatedly went back to the old location because the combination of the room, service, and good food somehow made for a great experience.  I've only had one experience at the new restaurant and am not likely to go back.  The service continued to be good and the food is basically unchanged.  But for some reason the larger and more formal room made me less forgiving of the small failings.  For example, my girlfriend ordered the ravioli filled with egg as an entree.   We'd had the same thing a week before on a trip to Mozza in LA and the serving there was quite large so we assumed it would be enough for an entree here.  She's a very, very small eater - I've never seen her come close to finishing a plate.  The serving at Quince was so small that she finished it in three bites and was still hungry.  My issue isn't that the portion was too small so much that I think it was so small that we should have been told that it wasn't likely to be enough to eat by itself (in which case we'd have ordered more).  This used to be a place that was bigger than the sum of it's parts for me, and for some reason that wasn't true any longer in its new location.", "author": "Michael E."}
