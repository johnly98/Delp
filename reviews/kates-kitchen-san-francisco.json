After a doctor's appointment, my friend and I chose this quaint restaurant for a weekday breakfast.  There were only a couple tables occupied so we choose a table against the right wall.  \n\nAfter a quick menu study, I ordered my usual breakfast, corn beef hash and eggs (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Ex8EF31tmSQg94qd0sLgxQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q), sunnyside up and English muffin dry; the menu stated the name as New England Flannel corned beef hash, but, not having traveled to that part of the country in over 25 years, I don't remember trying this before.  I liked the potatoes and eggs the best and am still on the fence on the corned beef part.  It was shredded corned beef with some carrots and potatoes that didn't really stand out.  The potato side was actually more interesting to me especially after I jazzed it up with some ketchup and Tabasco sauce.  Mix in that runny egg... well, just good stuff.\n\nThe service was great yet laid back as there were no other customers as we finished our meal. In studying the menu, the cuisine seemed more southern style cooking than northeastern cuisine.  My friend ordered their signature pancake on the side and let me try a bite and it was not bad; I'm not a pancake person, more likely to be impressed by the syrup or topping than the actual pancake.  Would like to return to try their dinner offerings...  Would return if in the neighborhood.", "author": "Mike C."}

What set Kate's Kitchen apart is that they don't use ham, but rather a delicious sausage patty and they add grilled onions. While some sausages are salty and a tad bit artificial, Kate's Kitchen's sausage patty tasted organic and low in sodium. You also feel fuller eating the sausage benedict as opposed to the traditional ham benedict. Before ordering, I was concerned that the benedict itself may not be enough, but it turned out to be sufficient! The dish comes with a generous side portion of potatoes, which I eat with the ketchup and hot sauce provided on the table. One important note though: the restaurant has an open-kitchen layout, so it smells greasy and a little overwhelming with the sheer amount of different cooking ingredients. \n\nWhen I was reading the Yelp tips, I was warned of the lower quality service during busy weekends. Unfortunately, they turned out to be true. So what happened was my friend and I split the bill using two credit cards and the waitress put both halves on my card... You could imagine how confused my friend and I were when we got the receipts! Also, my friend wanted house fries instead of potatoes, but either the waitress or the chef forgot about that, even though on the receipt it said \"with house fries.\" Being too busy is not an excuse for lower quality service because many places are busy for Sunday brunch and they have been able to figure internal processes out.

I love the decor, and the diners seemed to be locals. \n\nThe beet salad was good. Sliced beets, lettuce, lathered up in a creamy cilantro dressing sprinkled with some cheese. Added a side of salmon, but it wasn't cooked all the way. Good thing I like sushi, so it was like eating seared salmon LOL. \n\nThe paella didn't really seem to have a paella identity. It had chunks of salmon, small grilled shrimp (almost bay sized), rice, and tomatoes. Reminded me of gumbo without the sausage and beans. Tasted like salsa with rice, in a good way. Not my favorite choice. \n\nWe were a bit excited about the fried chicken, but disappointed. The breading was crunchy and tasty, but the overall dish lacked seasoning. I ate it the way it was supposed to, whole. My girlfriend got picky (literally!) and picked off the skin and breading (oh the agony!) and noticed that the chicken meat itself was not marinated. The beans were bland, however the mashed potatoes were creamy, moist, and had good flavor. \n\nMy girlfriend likes her drinks sweet, and I like mine fragrant and not sweet. We both found the perfect drinks here. For her, the lemonade spritzer. I thought it was too sweet, even for a sweet drink, but it was tasty. Freshly squeezed lemon juice. Mmm. I had the herbal berry iced tea. Tasted like hibiscus tea with a hint of blackberry (or was it my imagination?). No refills on the drinks. \n\nOverall a bit disappointed, but on the positive side, the service was good. The server was very accommodating and polite. I may come back just because of the good service and neighborhood feel of the place and give some of the other dishes another try.

He's been twice before, and had a good experience the first time, and a poor experience the second time- so we thought that maybe the third time's the charm?\n\nWe were very wrong. We ordered 2 plates of biscuits with sausage gravy, one side of scrambled eggs, one side of eggs over medium, a side of bacon, and a coffee. \n\nThe biscuits and gravy: As soon as it was put in front of us I knew something wasn't right. The gravy was an odd green/grey color, and looked like they mixed split pea soup with an old gelatinous stew. So odd. But I try not to judge a book by its cover, so we gave it a try. It was bad. It was really bad. It was strangely sweet, but also bland, and tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. The biscuits were a nice consistency, but I personally wasn't a fan of the dill inside. They were herbaceous in an unappetizing way.\n\nScrambled eggs: Okay, under seasoned, but edible.\n\nEggs over-medium: Looked fine.\n\nBacon: Tasted strangely chemically? Like that $3.99 bacon you grab at the corner liquor store when you're hungover but craving salt.\n\nCoffee: Pretty good.\n\nMy bf and I are pretty big fans of traditional, diner-style foods, and while we've had a lot of breakfasts all over the place, we're fine with solid, basic, breakfasts. We weren't expecting anything ~fancy~, but this was just...off. We're also not fans of complaining or returning food, but we mentioned to the server working behind the bar that we weren't big fans of the biscuits and gravy, and that they might want to take a look at today's batch, as it didn't taste quite right. We also insisted that we weren't looking for a refund. He apologized thoroughly. However, the manager then stormed over and aggressively said that he \"heard that we didn't like the gravy, and that there's absolutely nothing wrong with it. That many people this morning have eaten it and loved it- that people either love it or hate it\" and a bunch of other rambling, obnoxious things. They ended up comping 1 order of the biscuits and gravy, and we quickly left.\n\nIt was startling, honestly. I came to Yelp to check out the reviews this evening, because I was starting to think that maybe we were in the wrong for not liking the dish- but after scanning the posts, it seems that at least 2 other people have mentioned the SAME issue with the dish.\n\nAnyway.. this is a pretty busy place with a line sometimes, so maybe they have something else on the menu going for them? Just avoid the B & G I guess.", "author": "Ally H."}

I ordered the shakshuka- which looked amazing on the menu, and my boyfriend ordered the egg sandwich.  Our food came out and his was good, mine was raw- like, raw egg floating in tomatoes.  The waitress, to her credit, seemed horrified when I brought it to her attention.  Unfortunately, when she brought it back about ten minutes later, the egg had been mixed into the stew, defeating the whole idea of a shakshuka, in which there should be two baked eggs on top.  The flavor was okay, a little too canned tomatoey for my taste.  It would have been good with my English muffin, but it was covered in butter despite me ordering it dry, so that wasn't an option.  At that point, complaining seemed to be pretty useless, given that we were completely ignored, as the waiters filled water glasses around us and ignored ours.  All in all, the food was okay, but the butchered shakshuka was overpriced for what I got and the service was lackluster at best. (To be fair, the egg sandwich WAS good.

After going through our bookmarks and searching through Yelp, we finally stumbled upon Kate's Kitchen. Luckily, we found street parking immediately as we found the place. Though there was a short wait, we didn't mind going to the smoke shop next door and checking out their selection of smoking devices. As for the place itself, it literally feels like a kitchen because it is very cramped inside with few tables and chairs and of course, the kitchen. \nThe food is the star of this place. I went for the Texas fries which is their version of a breakfast skillet. That dish alone was amazing, but include an order of the French Toast Orgy and this meal truly became an orgasm in my mouth. Though the French Toast Orgy can be a meal in itself, we found it is best to shared with our group of 4.

Whenever I get a day off work, I make sure to come to Kate's Kitchen...there's simply no better way to start my day. Unfortunately I'm not able to do so, which is unfortunate because as many other Yelpers have bemoaned, you'll need to come early on Weekends, because this place is small and fills up quickly...so be prepared to wait if you're not an early riser. \n\nBut make sure you do wait, however, because Kate's is an experience like no other, and you'll always leave feeling 100x times better than when you arrive. The menu is extensive, the wait staff is quirky and and extremely friendly, and the food of course is absolutely amazing.\n\nThe best part for me though, is that ALL \"egg breakfasts\" and most of the other menu items come with a MASSIVE helping of their homefries. And these are not just any homefries...they are quite literally the best possible thing that could happen to your hangover...ever. Homefries are an essential part of every person's balanced weekend brunch, and these are the best out there.\n\nNeed suggestions for what to order? Thought you'd never ask: \n\nThe biscuits and gravy...french toast \"orgy\"...meat omelette...veggie scramble...buttermilk pancakes (caution: the tall stack is massive)\n\nPick your poison - they're all good. If those aren't up your alley, be sure to check out their SPECIALS board, which is handwritten in chalk and full of delicious mysteries. Last time I came by they had this special of homefries that came stuffed with bacon, eggs, peppers, onions and other ridiculous things inside (Update: These were the \"Mindy Hashbrowns\". Highly recommended). Needless to say it was dank.\n\nApparently (per a recent Yelp review) they now have started serving dinner too!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-01-16", "description": "I have never been treated with such rudeness and blatant disrespect as I have at Kate's Kitchen. I've worked in the service industry for over the past 5 years as both a cocktail waitress and server, and I have never seen a restaurant owner treat a customer as poorly as I was treated at Kate's Kitchen. I maintain a plant-based diet for health reasons, and I normally eat at plant-based restaurants, but when I go out with my friends I accompany them to non-vegan restaurants and always look for items on the menu that are plant-based. When we arrived at Kate's Kitchen I saw on the board a dish that described having all veggies: Spinach, avocado, mushrooms, bell peppers, etc. I thought \"great, that's perfect, I'll get that.\" I ordered it not realizing it was a veggie scramble, therefore it had eggs in it (stupid mistake, I know). Because I'm used to eating at plant-based restaurants, and because eggs were not listed on the board as one of the ingredients, it didn't even cross my mind that it had eggs in it. When it arrived my friends even joked with me about how big of a dumbass I was, and I agreed and laughed with them. It was an honest mistake, but the way it was handled was completely out of line and shocked my friends and I. When our food arrived and I saw that it had eggs, I said \"oh my gosh, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize this dish had eggs in it!\" The waitress gave an awkward look and hesitated before saying \"okay, we'll remake it for you.\" Being well aware of how annoying and high-maintenance vegans can be, and not wanting to be \"that person\" or make a big ordeal out of it or be an inconvenience in any way, I said \"if it's a problem I can just eat the potatoes, seriously, don't worry about it.\" And she said \"no it's fine, no problem.\" She went to the kitchen to replace the food when the manager/restaurant owner came up to the table and said to me \"you ordered the veggie scramble?\" I said \"Yes.\" He replied in the rudest tone, \"How do you not know what that is???\" and waited for me to answer. I explained the situation by saying \"I'm sorry, I was just looking for something on the menu with veggies, and since eggs are not listed on the description I didn't realize it had eggs in it.\" He continued to speak to me in the most condescending (almost yelling) tone and said \"How do you not know what a veggie scramble is??? Everyone knows that a veggie scramble has eggs in it.\" At this point I was both shocked and embarrassed and just said \"I'm sorry\" again. He continued to say \"I'm running a business here, you do realize it costs money to replace food?\" Still feeling both shocked and completely embarrassed, I just said \"it's fine, I'll just take it. Don't worry about it.\" And he just walked away with his hand in the air and said \"whatever, we'll just remake it.\" Obviously, at this point I'm not going to feel comfortable eating food he guilted me about making. So I walked to the back of the kitchen and said \"Sir, do not worry about making me new food. You made it very clear to me that it is an ordeal to replace, and that it costs money to replace, so don't worry about it.\" At this point I was feeling pretty embarrassed about the situation and I could feel tears welling up in my eyes. The waitress delivered the same plate of food and she could see how defeated and embarrassed I looked and just said \"I'm so sorry. If he wasn't here, we'd replace it in an instant.\" She was really sweet about it and I just said \"don't worry about it.\" As I was trying to eat my potatoes I could feel a lump in my throat and I could feel a tear coming on. I kept telling myself; \"Don't be a little bitch brigitte!\" But try as hard as I might, I couldn't keep the tears from coming. Trust me --I'm well aware of how embarrassing it is for a grown woman to be crying in public. It was beyond humiliating. My sister, being outraged with the way he spoke to me went up to him and said \"that was incredibly rude of you to talk to my sister that way, and that is no way to run a business.\" He just rolled her eyes at her. When the waitress brought the bill she was kind enough to profusely apologize, I think she felt embarrassed for her boss. We got the bill and my friends refused to let me pay for my meal that I did not eat. I think once the manager saw that my friends weren't allowing me to pay he had the waitress take my food off the bill, which was kind of him but quite frankly the least he could do after the way he treated me. I may have made a mistake and ordered the wrong thing, but you don't treat customers like they're a worthless piece of trash. He complained about his business not doing well, but clearly if he learned a little customer service and respect, I'm sure his business would be doing much better.  It's unfortunate that this happened, and it definitely dampened the mood for the rest of our trip in San Francisco. Next time I visit San Fran I'll be sure to steer clear from Kate's Kitchen.", "author": "Brigitte B."}

I do find, best to go \"early\" as it gets really busy and the noise level is off the charts. Popped in yesterday as I was feeling a \"breakfast out\" might be in order. Decided on the California Oatmeal which was \"more than plentiful\" and reasonably priced @ $8.00. Sadly, the oatmeal came only \"luke warm\" and I asked the server if I might get a new order.  I did put a little milk on it and she said, the milk is really cold, this is probably what happened.  Well, I think the bowl was cold to begin with and then yes, the tiny bit of milk I put on it may have added to the temperature factor.  Thankfully the 2nd bowl came piping hot, I could see the steam and it was full of delicious Strawberries and Bananas but the promised Walnuts were almost non existent.  The texture was a lot like cream of wheat... not very oatmeal like.  Plus it had absolutely no flavor.  The maple syrup helped, but not much.  I did ask for a side of Cinnamon, which did help.  I will stick to the other breakfast options moving forward.", "author": "Marla B."}

Stuffed to overflowing with pulled pork, avocado, and roasted tomatoes and red peppers, it was a massive pile of scrumptiousness, accompanied by an equally massive pile of excellent home fries and toast.

Admittedly it's a small place and when 12 of us walked in it probably caused a bit of stress! We offered to sit on separate tables but the staff said it would be fine and asked us to wait outside while they rearranged things. When we came back in they had put a line of tables down one side of the restaurant, facing the wall. We really wanted to be able to talk and so apologised (several times) and said we would sit on separate tables after all. Some of us offered to help put the tables back but the staff said they would do it although when the waitress in question saw what we had decided she said 'Are you f*cking kidding me?'. Nice.

Fine place, a little rough around the edges, but inviting and the service was friendly.  Good music, strong coffee, and a vegetarian-friendly breakfast menu.  I was ready to become a fan.\n\nBut whoa, the food was gross.  That's not exactly true:  my girl's french toast was fried right, a little tough because it seemed to be made of a baguette, but the orange flavor was good and she was happy.  But sweet baby Jesus, I ordered the cheesy biscuits with gravy, and I can say without question they were the nastiest biscuits and gravy I've ever had in my life.  I just vurped thinking about them.\n\nFrankly, they weren't biscuits by any definition of the word.  The server brought these two hulking, fifty pound blocks of over-floured cake to the table and dropped 'em, BAM!  The whole restaurant shook.  I took a bite and my eyes stopped blinking because the cake had sucked all the water out of my body.  They seemed to have been seasoned with onion salt and sand.\n\nThankfully, a good gravy can save any shitty biscuit.  Here, however, I received a two-gallon trough of greenish-grey phlegm that tasted vaguely of re-hydrated mushrooms.  Or something.  It was as thick as oatmeal and impossible to dip.  In fact, I tried to dip one of the boulder biscuits into it and a giant slab of the biscuit ripped off and cleaved a hole in the floor that went down to hell.  I chucked the biscuit into the firey pit and an instant later Satan threw it back up.  Even Hell can't take those goddamn nasty biscuits.\n\nKate's \"biscuits\" and \"gravy\" cost $9 bucks, if I remember correctly.  For another $4, you can go to Safeway and get a can of pre-made biscuits and a package of white pepper gravy that you can use to wash the flavor out of your mouth.\n\nOne star for the kind service and the coffee, one star (barely) for the french toast.", "author": "Cody V."}

There was no white toast option (what kind of a greasy spoon doesn't offer white toast?) so I settled for whole wheat, which somehow turned out to be a mealy AND dried out bun. I  overheard the servers ask almost every single diner if they wanted a box to take home their glaring leftovers - either the portions are too big, or the food isn't great, or maybe it's both.

I ordered the fried chicken and he had the meatloaf. Both were tasty, clearly all elements on the plate were homemade and it was completely satisfying.

BUT... then I flipped it over and read the descriptions of producers and got a really good understanding of why Kate's pours the wines they do and all was good in the world again. \n\nSo while the dinner was really great, the breakfast menu on the big chalk board caught our attention all through dinner. So much so that I returned the next morning for breakfast. Turns out that the chalk board is only a small portion of the breakfast menu. The \"real\" menu had even more scrumptious options. The very friendly server (as was the woman the night before) was quite accommodating and let me order a smattering of this and a side of that.

On more than 1 occasion, I've decided to go elsewhere since I only had a debit card and did not want to use the shady ATM next to the restaurant and pay over  $5 in fees to get cash. Not sure how they'll survive over the next 4 years remaining a cash only establishment.  Directing customers to a shady ATM that charges $3 in fee's doesn't seem customer friendly.", "author": "Mike T."}

The were served with honey butter and dusted with sugar but very bland. They were dressed up to be sweet but were not flavorful.\n\nThe first thing we noted about the food was NOTHING IS SEASONED. It's one of those places were they expect you to load up your seasonings. What? Put some salt and pepper on my eggs, please. \n\nThe most flavorful thing about our meal was my juice. The blueberry, strawberry and apple blend was great. Recommend.\n\nNothing on our plates was memorable.

Whatever.\n\nAbout those hushpuppies. The best part about them is that they were free with a Scoutmob offer. The only flavor came from the oil they'd been cooked in and everything else that had been cooked in it plus the pile of powdered sugar. No corn flavor. No salt. A weird musty flavor as if the mix used is old. The \"Pooh\" honey butter made me a little nervous since it seemed entirely possible it's made from the plain butter that comes back to the kitchen.\n\nI stayed basic since this was my first visit and ordered the Farmer's breakfast w/ the homemade pork sausage, cheese-onion biscuit, substituted grits for the hashbrowns. The eggs were cooked to order. The sausage is dry, but  the grill cook still hasn't learned not to press down on patties with a spatula while they're cooking. Consequently, they were absolutely dry.. The grits had absolutely no salt and very little flavor. The biscuit had no cheese, large pieces of green onion tops, no salt, no flavor.\n\nWhile I've had my share of meals where the kitchen has a heavy hand with salt, no salt is worse. Everything needs a pinch of salt to enhance flavor.

Since he has been diagnosed with Celiac Disease we have been on the hunt for great places to eat that can accommodate his dietary restrictions.\n\nWe ordered the gluten-free oatmeal cakes for him.  He's very sensitive so we always ask about the chances for cross contamination depending on the food preparation environment.  The waitress was very nice and said she would go and ask for us to make sure.  Soon after, someone else came out and let us know that they actually add a little bit of gluten to the oatmeal to make the cakes.\n\nYes.  You heard correctly.  \"We add a little bit of gluten...\" to our gluten-free oatmeal cakes.  We kindly asked them to stop calling them gluten-free.\n\nSo instead we ordered an egg scramble and a gluten-free biscuit.  They assured us that the biscuits were free of gluten.  When the food came, it came with home fries.  My partner then asked if they can check how the home fries are prepared, since we have encountered places that actually dredge the potatoes in a flour, or dust the potatoes in flour.  They came back to let us know that there is no flour there either.\n\nAwesome...let's eat!\n\nSo my partner digs in to the scramble, only to find that there are strips of tortilla throughout the scramble.  This was not listed on the ingredients on the menu board.\n\nWe are accustomed to asking about food preparation and the presence of gluten in the food we order.  It's appalling that after we had asked about pretty much everything we ordered nobody at Kate's Kitchen clued in that we cannot have flour tortilla strips in the scramble.  \n\nBrunch ruined...my partner left Kate's Kitchen hungry and angry.\n\nDear Kate's Kitchen,\n\nPlease do take seriously your customers' dietary restrictions.  It is insane that you call your oatmeal cakes gluten-free when you consciously add gluten to them.  For my partner, gluten is poison.  You are intentionally poisoning people when you tell them something is gluten free, when you know that it is not.

Service is fast and very nice. \n\nThe corned beef (flannel) hash is pretty freakin awesome. Tons of food for a pretty good price. Just the right amount of beefiness. \n\nthe French toast orgy is a major fake out. The menu says French toast, smothered with fruit, yogurt, and honey. Over the years I have been trained to expect BERRIES with my French toast. Nothing beats a good French toast covered with fresh berries. We all know that. However, this one comes with a hodgepodge of gutter fruit. There is a time and a place for melon and it is not at breakfast on my French toast. The fruit selection is bizarre and low quality: honeydew, grapes, watermelon, and pineapple. WTF?!\n\nBottom line: go savory and you can't go wrong.", "author": "Winston L."}

My poached egg was perfection and the potatoes were yummy too (boo to no Chalula or Tapatio, come on, is this California or what?).

He proceeded to tell me that the place closes at 2:45 and his cooks had been there since 7 a.m. and it was almost 4 p.m.  Still it's 9 hours and I don't think an extra 3 minutes would have killed anyone and it would have been another sale but I guess my money wasn't good enough. \n\nIn general I got a negative vibe and major side-eye action from the owner/manager. My thoughts are if you are so close to closing time then don't take my order to begin with.  But if you do and I ask for something while I'm still eating and it doesn't require fire what's the big deal? \n\nOverall I liked the service from my waitress hated the attitude from the manager/owner. Would I go there again? Only if I was starving and hungover.", "author": "Y M."}

It wasn't lunch time, but there were several diners inside and we figured that was a good sign. We split an order of hush puppies and each had a glass of tea. The hushpuppies were great and I made a mental note to go back again someday for something more substantial.\n\nThe next time I was in the area it was breakfast time and we decided to actually have a meal here. There were lots of people hanging outside waiting for a table this time. We put our name on the list hanging outside the door and joined the wait. \n\nI thought the French Toast Orgy sounded interesting even though it wasn't something I would usually order. I decided to try it anyway and it was fantastic! The orange spice French toast alone was very flavorful and it was piled high with fresh fruit, plain yogurt, and granola. There was enough on my plate to easily serve two hungry people. I can't remember what my friend ordered, but I do remember that she was happy with her meal too. \n\nI've been back a few times since and now I usually split the French Toast Orgy with whomever I'm dining with. If no one wants to split it, I have them give me less French toast because I hate wasting al that food. I've taken several people for breakfast at Kate's Kitchen and everyone has loved it.\n\n\nI've tried lunch here too and had the M & M Sandwich, but I was not so impressed with that.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-08-15", "description": "Wow! Really Kate's?!?! You took a piece of happiness away from me today...\n\nI live in the lower Haight and have seen the lines outside this place for years, but have never had the chance to try it.  Today, my best friend and boyfriend asked me where I would like to go for my BIRTHDAY brunch. I chose Kate's, and was very excited about eating out at a new, local spot  with my two favorite people.   \n\nAfter we signed up on the very long wait list, I began perusing the menu and there were several tasty items that I couldn't wait to try (I get really excited about new food).  The only menu that you can see outside while you are waiting is RIGHT by the door that has to be opened each time the host/busser comes outside to check someone off the list and take them to be seated.  Each time the girl came out, I could plainly see that she was irritated that I was in her way.  ForGIVE me for wanting to see a menu that is new to me while I wait in your enormously long line.  (Strike one for having the outdoor menu in a bad location that entices dirty looks from frustrated employees)\n\nThere were several names on the list, when they were called, they were no where to be found, including a party of 6.  We thought this would work in our favor... yay!\n\nAfter waiting forty-five minutes, a member of the staff calls our name. I was so excited I gave a little \"woohoo!\" out loud :) .  Yaaay! Time to eat! The girl brings us in and gives us our table.  We start looking over our menus, and I notice three staff members talking next to our table, and then one of them points at us (strike two...don't POINT at your patrons. That's rude on OR off the clock...common sense here...come on!).  \n\nA minute later the girl who has been seating people comes up to our table and says to us, \"I'm sorry there is a party of six who called ahead and this is their table.  Can you please go outside and we will call you in 10 or 15 minutes?\"  \n\nWTF? Are you serious? You give us a table then you make us get up after five minutes, after we've taken our coats off and go back outside? Wow, really??  Who DOES that?\n\nOh wait...isn't that that party of six whose name you called earlier that wasn't even THERE? That showed up 30 minutes AFTER we had been standing outside waiting? Wow... (big strike three, get us excited and then let us down.  Boo!! ) \n\nOkaaay.  So we go back outside and we continue waiting for another 10 minutes.  \n\nWhen we get called back inside, the staff is not apologetic about giving us a table and then taking it away.  Its a little disappointing, because ONE sincere apology would have made such a difference.  When a mistake is made, you would think that the staff would try to make up for it with a good attitude, or smiling or apologizing.  Naaaah...not this time around.  (strike four)\n\nWe order an orange juice and two coffees and they bring us an OJ and coffee and a mystery juice.  My friend says to the girl (same girl who asked us to leave our table and wait outside) \"Im sorry, we didn't order a grapefruit juice.\" the girl looks back at her and says \"Oh honey, that's not a grapefruit juice! Its an apple juice.\" \n\nReally? Well it sure ain't coffee, HONEY!! I didn't even CARE they had brought the wrong thing.  Who cares?!?! Its just a juice!! What I DO care about is the tone of voice that you use to talk to me and hers.....was NOT cute.  Coming from an old crotchedy waitress chewing gum the \"honey\" would have worked...but she was younger than us and it came out sounding soo condescending.  (strike five)\n\nEven though I'm irritated at this point...I am being NICE because I am really trying my BEST to still have a nice birthday brunch. Really really trying.   \n\nThen, our waitress is rude and ignores most of what I say to her. Even if you are busy, all you have to do is acknowledge your customer so that they can relax and know you will take care of them.  Its hard to convey her attitude in words, but she was acting like a teenage girl that is mad at her mum.  When the mum asks her to clean her bedroom, the child just continues pouring her water and ignores the parent.  THAT is the attitude that came across. Bratty! ewwwww (strike 6)   \n\nIt is hard for me to even talk about the food because I was so distracted by the out right rude staff.  I have worked in restaurants on and off for the past 14 years and I know what service is suppose to be. When you go to a restaurant, how can you relax and enjoy the food and the overall experience when people all around you are acting like douche bags??? What's the point of eating out, if you can't have a good time?! Why should I PAY to be treated like CRAP and ignored!? WAAH!! :( Makes me so sad!! \n \nBiscuits were dry, gravy was bland. The egg sandwich thing (Lori's special?) was pretty tasty but was NOT worth an hour wait and NOTHING is worth being treated the way we were.  \n\nI will never return to Kate's and I feel sad that I wasted my time and money here today.

Second, the portions here are quite filling. Third, the food here is exceptionally friendly on your wallet. One of the more expensive dishes was priced at around $9.99. This dish is almost too much food for me to eat! Try going to Toast or Eats. $9.99 is going to get you one of the smaller, less filling entrees. You can walk out of this place at around $12 WITH a delicious beverage. I love that.\n\nYou have to try their banana walnut pancakes!! I mean, try any of them. They are all so amazing. Also, any breakfast with their fruit is great. The French Toast Fruit Orgy is fantastic! My only complaint about this place is that they are a little shysty with their maple syrup. All you have to do is ask for some more, but I always feel weird asking. I think it's bc maybe they're trying to get people to stop smothering their food in sugar. Maybe? I'm not sure.

Kate's is a pretty good spot for brunch. Service is good, it's decently sized and it's not too expensive. Actually, I probably would have only given Kate's 3 stars because some of the stuff I had there wasn't that great, but the french toast orgy had to bump it up a star. \n\nImagine this: You take a loaf of french bread, slice it up, turn it into french toast. Lay down a foundation of these french toast slices on a plate, pile on a huge load of fresh fruit, dump a whole glob of sweet and tart yogurt on top of that, cover the whole creation with a layer of granola, and then serve it with a side of maple syrup. That's your french toast orgy. It probably tastes better than it sounds. I think the best thing about it is that you end up eating a whole lot, but a lot of it was fruit and yogurt and granola, so you don't feel too heavy afterwards. Good stuff.

When they showed up they were covered with powdered sugar.  She doesn't particularly like powdered sugar and was surprised because the menu seemed oddly specific calling out both the butter and the maple syrup which also came with and on the pancakes. \n\nWhen she asked for them with no sugar, she was told that she should have ordered them without sugar.  When she pointed out that the menu said nothing about smothering the pancakes with powdered sugar she was told 'people who eat pancakes know they are covered with powdered sugar.'  Now folks, I've eaten pancakes my whole life, and with rare exception, they've been sugar free.\n\nWhen the new pancakes arrived, they were thick, heavy and tasteless.\n\nNo thanks to Kate's kitchen.\n\n(For actual amazing pancakes, try Al's Cafe in Bernal).", "author": "Bob R."}

I would have like plain honey minus the butter but they were still a sweet surprise.\n\nCorned Beef Hash\n*Carrots, there are carrots with the big chunks of corned beef and potatoes. An egg served medium was placed atop everything and oozed its yolk goodness into it.\n\nOrange Spiced French Toast w/fruit, yogurt and granola\n*I do believe that my 4th quandrant of my stomach opened up with eating a few pieces of this. I'm not sure if it was plain or vanilla yogurt but there was a slight bitter taste to the dish. A little fresh honey would have done it just right!\n\nI liked this cozy little quick brefassis place in lower haight and may go back if in a hugely hungover stupor!

Kate's was described as having one of the \"best\" breakfasts in the city. Well, after making my way over to Kate's I can agree. She really is \"one\" of the best... *ahem* one of a hundred best breakfasts in the city. Too bad it's not in the middle to upper echelon.   \n\nThere is no pretense upon arriving at Kate's. It's sort of a hole in the wall grease spoon breakfast house. A few tables, a few chairs, a few servers. Nothing fancy and nothing exciting. \n\nI ordered the \"meat omelette\" which consisted of bay shrimp, onion, garlic, tomato, and spinach. On the side came potatoes and toast. The omelette arrived and appeared unappetizing due to its rather large oil slick that puddled in the lower side of the plate. Either Kate's last name is Gilroy or she is deathly afraid of vampires because the garlic in this omelette was so overwhelming it usurped any and all flavor from the other ingredients. Furthermore, the shrimp were tiny and scarce and the potatoes were burnt and cancerous. When the entrees title says \"meat\" omelette and contains bay shrimp in quantities you'd think came from a \"bathtub sized\" bay I call bs. \n\nThe French Toast Orgy aptly named for it's cornicopia of flavors and messy chaotic appearance was nothing amazing. It's a typical French Toast but topped with granola and yogurt *yawn*. This French Toast should be called the cialis infused \"swingers over 80\" French Toast because it was dated and stale. If only Kate's pepped it up a bit with thick slices of egg battered cinnamon whole wheat toast, coated in macadamia and hazelnuts, topped with enough fresh fruit to sell on a street corner, blanketed with vanilla Tahitian butter, and accompanied with nutella and coconut maple syrup dipping sauces... only then would it be a true Orgy of greatness.\n\nIn summary, the food lacked flavor, variety, and quality. If it was 3am and I was drunk without any concept of money or a palate then sure Kate's would be a great spot, otherwise try something much better like... Brenda's, Mama's, Dottie's, Crepevine, etc....", "author": "Rhett S."}

I refrained from toppings, but was quite happy with the syrup since it came separately and help me not over do it and drown my cakes.  I guess you can say I am watching my non-girl like figure. \n\nMoving on to the oatmeal pancakes, I have to say I was VERY impressed.  They were filling, smooth and really had a great flavor.  I would have to say that I will be ordering oatmeal pancakes from now one or at least when available.

So we paid the 28$ for the Texas home fries, egg sandwich and side of fruit. The fruit was moldy and old and disintegrating. Completely inedible. The Texas home fries is supposed to be potatoes with bacon and cheese and salsa and sour cream. It only came with the potatoes and cheese. I asked for a side of avocado and they literally put 1/10th of an avocado on there. I'm sure they charged about 2$. The bread in the egg sandwich is stale, crumbling and inedible so basically we paid 30$ for a bunch of old food we can't even eat. My boyfriends the least picky person in the world and he won't even eat it. Probably not guna try this place for a third time.", "author": "Laura S."}

I'm always down for Sunday brunch and Kate's had all the makings of a winner. The inside is pretty cramped with tables and chairs everywhere but it's decorated nicely with some fun writing on the walls that distracted us while we waited for our food. I got an egg and cheese sandwich that was just kind of alright. It came on a bun that was too big and dry to put just cheese and eggs on. It needs some sort of sauce or a thinner bun. My girlfriend got some vegetarian biscuits and gravy that weren't that great. Nothing was super offensive, but it just wasn't that good. I probably should have gotten the french toast or the hash that I hear about, but I feel like a good brunch place should be able to nail an egg and cheese sandwich.", "author": "Jeremy J."}

First of all came here with Grace, Slash, and Devon and we split a stack of 4 cornmeal buttermilk pancakes.  \n\nThe pancakes here all start with the same batter and then they top it off with fruit or mix stuff in with them.  We decided on having 2 pumpkin pancakes and 2 bacon and cheddar.. yes that's right, bacon and cheddar mixed right into the batter then topped with more cheese. They look amazing when they come out.. but I'm still not too sure how I feel about them.  I love plain old pancakes and maple syrup.  No fancy cornmeal or whole wheat stuff or fruit toppings.  Just gimme the flapjacks.  So if you're like me and that's what you want when you order a plate of pancakes then this probably isn't for you.  \n\nInstead, if you think of it as a flat, circular piece of cornbread, then you might get a kick out of them.  Surprisingly they still go really well with the maple syrup.  The same goes for the pumpkin pancakes.  Just think of it as a warm, flat pumpkin spice bread and you'll be in love.  \n\nJust don't think of them as pancakes.  \n\nAlso the green onion and cheese biscuits weren't mind-blowing.  Biscuits should be crisp and flaky, but these were more dense and doughy.  Also the sausage gravy was a little bland.  \n\nOn to the good stuff: the corned beef hash is incredible.  You won't find this in any Hormel can.  This is REAL chunks of crispy corned beef, mixed with red-skinned potatoes, carrots, and celery, topped with eggs any style.  So good.  The french toast is made with thick slices of french bread and is also superb.  \n\nI saw someone order the french toast orgy and it was ridiculous.. just a huge pile of french toast topped with yogurt, granola, and fruit.  That guy finished pretty much everything too.  What a champion.  \n\nSo although my particular dish (biscuits and gravy) wasn't that great, I still liked this place, and there are definitely other dishes I wanna try.  Plus the prices can't be beat (42 bucks for the 4 of us and we were stuffed) and it is definitely easier to get here than Dotties.\n\nBut Dottie's is still just the best.", "author": "William S."}

Granted, I didn't order the fruit orgy because I couldn't bring myself to pay 6 bucks for a bowl of fruit and I wanted something more substantial for brunch. Instead, I got the orange French toast and my BF got the cheese and onion biscuits in gravy.\n\nFor French toast it was good. Tasty. But for orange French toast it was lacking. I heard it was supposed to be amazing, but I could barely taste the orange. Boo. And I had to pay extra to get bacon on the side since the French toast didn't come with anything else. (Though, I don't know if this counts as a valid complaint or more of a declaration of my piggy-ness.)\n\nThe biscuits weren't too bad. Tasty from the bites I stole. But I could see how a big bowl of gravy and two biscuits would get boring after awhile. \n\nOverall it's overrated and overpriced. We order all that and some tea and the bill was almost $30.

The French Toast Orgy absolutely, 100% rocks. There is nothing fake, girly or wussy about this dish.  It requires a battle plan and a full arsenal of weaponry from the second it hits your table.  But believe me, it can be finished!  You can beat this thing!\n\nWhen taking on this beast, remember to pace yourself.  My 4'11\" friend can usually out-eat me any day, but she rushed and left with a stomach ache and a bruised ego (and the girl can eat).  Don't rush.  Savor.  This is seriously some of the best pre-hike or pre-bike food you can eat--it doesn't put you to sleep.  All that granola somehow balances out the sugar coma most french toast induces.  I've eaten this thing and walked to Ocean Beach and back without hesitation or weariness.\n\nI can't attest to any other dish at Kate's because in the last five years, I've never ordered anything but the Orgy.  It all smells good and looks good, though.  They make a really good hand-made ginger ale.  The prices are incredibly reasonable for what you get, and the waits don't tend to be too long.  Even with ten parties in front of you, the cattle prod is frequently used in the form of extremely efficient service, so the line goes fast.  In this case, the line is genuinely a reflection of very good food, instead of lazy waiters and laggy patrons.\n\nKate herself?  Wander through the kitchen toward the bathroom to see her in action.  Wow.  No wonder things move quickly.  She is one bad-ass woman.\n\nDon't let the exterior, neighborhood, or even the interior greasy-spoon-looking atmosphere turn you back.  Eat here, and be happy.

Unfortunately, my recent brunch at Kate's did not live up to my (admittedly high) brunch standards.  The regular menu was pretty small, so I ended up ordering the omelette special: chicken, onion, sundried tomatoes, rosemary, and feta.  I can't say no to feta.  The filling was quite good - the chicken moist and satisfying, the onions golden-brown, and although the rosemary in the eggs was a little too strong, I was satisfied.  \n\nIt was when I turned to the sides that I found real disappointment.  An eggy breakfast is obviously incomplete without its potato counterpart, and at Kate's, they take the shape of home fries.  Home fries done well are heaven on earth, with subtle flavors of onions and peppers mingling with the starchy potato goodness.  Kate's home fries, however, were luke-warm, mushy instead of crispy, and completely lacking in the fullness of flavor that makes fries more than just a baked potato.\n\nThe final disappointment was the english muffin.  I don't have english muffins very often, so i was really looking forward to a crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, nooks and crannies overflowing with golden butter experience.  Instead, I think I was served a kitchen sponge that had been sliced in half, briefly heated, and dipped in oil.\n\nThe 30+ minute had me hoping for more, but Kate, you let me down.

It reminded me both in taste and texture of condensed clam chowder soup. The biscuits were just as bad. Dense, with hardly any cheese or green onions in them. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered one of their scrambles and he wasn't impressed with it either. The amount of food they pile on the plates is disgusting as well. The only reason I give this place 2 stars is because the wait staff was nice.", "author": "Jade L."}

The pancakes were decent but certainly nothing to write home about.  The dryness I felt while masticating was not readily alleviated by the syrup that accompanies the dish.  The omelet was terrible.  It was as if they had just cooked an inch of egg in a pan and then thrown the ingredients on top willy-nilly.  Overall, I believe the food is seriously about quantity and filling the plate to the brim for the surprise value, with scant afterthought given to how it is put together.  Particularly troubling for me was the lack of cheese and meat inside the omelet.\n\nENVIRONMENT/SERVICE: THREE STARS (* * *)\nThe environment is decidely no-frills, with an obvious shout-out to the diner days of yesteryear.

A short stack of pancakes for only around $4 is hard to beat, especially in this city.  However, I am unwilling to give this particular category five stars (* * * * *) because I don't feel the quality of the food warrants it, even at these price points.

Most of the plates usually come with enough food to soak up all the residual booze and fill you up good, especially if you split a side of pancakes (cornmeal or pumpkin, both are great) or hush puppies (very average) with someone.  The potatoes are actually pretty tasty, although they do give you like 5 pounds of them.   \n\nThis place should appeal to vegetarians (not vegans), as they usually have many meatless options.

Eggs were cooked to perfection though.\n\nAngie B. proudly requested, then proudly shared, the aforementioned French Toast Orgy and it was delicious.  I can't say anything negative about orange spiced anything.  Yogurt/granola/fruit combo was definitely a great pairing, and just a touch of syrup made this a great morning meal.  Natalie M. got the special omelette of the day and I LOVED IT for its unabashed display of garlic heaven.

On weekends I go out to eat with my friends after running. This morning, we did 16 miles, so we had worked up enough of an appetite to sample a good portion of the menu. One of my friends got Kafka's scramble (veggies and eggs), while the other basically ordered 5 side dishes and mixed them together on one plate. The waiter looked at him strangely, but was accommodating of his bizarre tastes. I got the corned beef hash. and some hush puppies.\n\nMy friends seemed to enjoy their meals, but the hash was definitely not what I was hoping for. I like my hash to be chopped up pretty well -- this was SUPER chunky, with some hunks of corned beef that were maybe 1\" cubes. That's a pretty big cube of meat if you think about it. The hush puppies were delicious, mostly because of the (apparently legendary) pooh butter. I would almost consider getting 3 orders of these and making a meal of them, but I'm pretty sure my stomach would hate me later.\n\nWe had to wait a little bit, but that seems to be pretty standard for any decent brunch place on the weekends. Service was pretty good, though the waiter said he could bring us some orange juice outside while we waited for a table and never followed through.

It is so big it's a good idea to split it w/someone OR have them box up half of it for you to take home or give to a homeless person as you walk home/catch the bus/walk to your car. \n\nThe parking isn't bad but it is easily accessible by public transit (close to the Church St. muni station & bus lines). \n\nYou will likely wait on a typical weekend but there is a list you can write your name on & it gives you lots of time to read a book or visit w/your friends while you wait. I think I've typically waited 20 minutes plus for a table for 2, not bad really. \n\nThey are really nice & have great service when I've been there.

The other thing completely inappropriate is the way the employees used the sound system as a personal DJ device constantly flipping through their favorite Guns 'n Roses, assorted heavy metal and yes, even Carlos Santana. I thought a restaurant was for the customers not the employees - well not at Kate's, you have entered a zone where the inmates run the asylum. Ask yourself, do want to listen to Axel Rose at full tilt boogie at 10:00am in the morning? \n\nPerhaps I'm spoiled but the food - at least what my companion and I ordered  - was either mediocre, poorly prepared or both. Having been spoiled by Rick and Ann's and Cafe Fanny (both East Bay establishments) perhaps I was expecting too much for breakfast fare.\n\nI ordered the \"oatmeal\" although I cant remember what they called it with their particular Kate's Kitchen nomenclature. When it arrived it looked good enough with ample fresh strawberries and bananas but was fatally wounded by the fact that it was not fully cooked. How you screw up oatmeal is beyond me but Kate's has perfected it. In my book if I can cook something better than the \"chef\" you loose all credibility as an eating establishment. And if you screw up something that needs 4 minutes in a microwave or half an hour in a crock pot you need some remedial cooking instruction - and pronto.\n\nMy friend ordered a \"fruit and granola salad\" again apologies to the wizard who came up with the cutesy Kate's name.

The wait can be 20 minutes and onwards but let's keep in mind that it's the city and this place is totally worth it. They serve a good coffee called chicory, different and good. Also, their food tends to be on the heavier side, so if you eat here you're not exactly going to get a lot of work done later. I love their cornmeal pancakes, and they serve real maple syrup which is amazing. Real maple syrup is delicious, and completely changes the typical pancake experience. If you are looking for a very hearty, and home cooked feel, then you will love this place.", "author": "Sundeep G."}

Yeah i know, shit happens. But in the broader context of this place sucking, i figured it was worth a mention.\n\nNow, i'm told that their French Toast Orgy is amazing. But i don't really like tons of sweet stuff for breakfast so i have not been able to verify this. I tend to go for the simple breakfast: eggs, toast, potatoes, and coffee. And they still manage to find room in there to get my order wrong. Also their potatoes are sorry as hell.\n\nOf course, when your neighbor who grew up down the street says \"That place isn't that good, they messed up my order, and it's overpriced,\" you should probably just take his word for it.\n\nOne star for the chicory, one star for everyone who said \"Dude you can't talk shit until you've had the French Toast Orgy.\" And i really think i'm being generous.", "author": "player z."}

The orange spice french toast is delicious(and don't let the name fool you, it tastes nothing like oranges), and the bacon is pretty great too.  \n\nHowever, the service often leaves something to be desired.  In both of my last two visits, items I ordered or asked for were never brought.  I can only remember ever seeing one server there at a time - usually the same girl - and she hasn't seemed very enthusiastic to be there recently.   Also be prepared to deal with a crowd - especially weekend mornings.\n\nAll in all a good place.  And if anyone cracks the bizarre code on the wall, let me know, won't you?", "author": "Mike S."}

As for the staff, i have never had a problem with them, but i could see how i might have problems if i was expecting a five star breakfast, (i'm gonna go out on a limb here) and guess that the people who panned Kates are just too yuppyish or just expecting way too much for too little,,,like most marinaites...

On my last visit, however, it was downright disrespectful.  We had to ask for everything -- water, extra coffee -- while in the past those things were offered automatically.  \n\nThe young lady who has always worked the weekend early morning shift was helping herself to what looked like a 3,000 calorie breakfast of an omelet and ice cream, while completely ignoring  her customers.  One gentleman walked in, stood in the middle of the room looking lost, just to have her wave him to a table, while chewing at the same time.  He turned around and walked out and I can't say that I blame him.\n\nOther staff members were engaging in behavior, in full view of the few patrons that were there, that was downright unsanitary.

The sausage tasted like unseasoned ground beef that had been formlessly slapped onto a grill and overcooked.  Our wobbling table was centered in the line of traffic so every waitress and customer who walked by haphazardly knocked our elbows.  The wait was long and the price was way too high for the food I ate.  The only reason I even offer one star is because the menu had items that sounded tasty.", "author": "regina k."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-01-15", "description": "My favorite meal is, undoubtedly, brunch. The thing I miss most about living in a big city is the ready availability of brunch and the relative adventurousness of a few special menu items therein. The first time I was here, my best friend and I, never having been in the area, just happened to secure parking right in front of Kate's. As soon as I saw the accumulation of people waiting out front and noted the item \"French Toast Orgy\" on the menu, I knew we'd solved our parking and hunger issues in one fell swoop. \n\nThe inside of Kate's is necessarily cramped, but it earns the euphemistic adjective \"cozy\" because everyone inside seems to be enjoying themselves. It's also busy, so your coffee cup won't stay as full as you'd like. I'd be wary of bringing a group of more than four. The other key technical aspect is to know that it is cash only---fortunately there is an ATM right outside the door if you forget.\n\nAs for the food, I definitely won. Of course, my superpower is the ability to always order the best meal at a restaurant (which I would never give up for something as trivial as flying or telepathy), especially when breakfast items are involved. I contemplated the whole wheat Texas toast with strawberries and bananas, but since I'd been craving corn bread, I went with the more basic cornmeal pancakes. The short stack (with a side) is sufficient unless you are ravenous or are filling the bottomless hangover pit in your stomach (note: corn may not be the way to go there, compadre). Kate's also reminds me of a good hint for breakfast-ordering: when they describe the syrup, and extra syrup costs extra, that's usually an indicator that the pancakes/French toast are a wise choice. You will have to stretch the single serving of syrup they provide, but the pancakes are flavorful enough to stand with just butter, so don't fear. \n\nPancakes are best served with some form of porkage, so I opted for the so-described \"thick-cut\" bacon. I have to say that my Southern roots were a bit offended by the alleged thickness of said pork, but having gracefully handled such situations in many alternate contexts, I set out to enjoy it. While tasty, the bacon was lazily cooked on a too-hot surface: it was near black in parts but practically raw in between. Needless to say, I'm Southern, it's bacon, and so that didn't stop me. In between bites I snagged a couple of my friend's potatoes: sufficient, but nothing to write home about.\n\nAt this point, I could have signed off saying this was a delightful meal. I must rant, however, because it is a travesty that such a delightful place to eat would perform the following unforgivable food foul: the highly touted biscuits and gravy were downright vile. The biscuits looked rather instant, and the cheese and chive or whatever was supposed to be in them was hardly noticeable. Less than stellar biscuits can be forgiven (even though Kentucky sense says you should never marry someone who can't make biscuits from scratch) if, and only if, the gravy is amazing. Oh, but no. First of all, Kate's offers both a vegetarian and a sausage gravy. Um, no. Gravy, my friends, is made of animal remnants. \"Vegetarian gravy\" is an oxymoron. Call it sauce, call it dip---it ain't gravy. Kate's \"sausage gravy\" (which also merits quotation marks, as such a cruel parody) was more from the glue family, and, sin of sin, *it had celery in it.* NO YOU DI'IN'T. My friend likened it to clam chowder (\"um, without the clams, I guess\") although it was apparent that the \"gravy\" was more akin to a veggie dip with perhaps 5 stray particles of sausage in it, and obviously none of the animal juices required to make gravy. Worst of all, it was served lukewarm and was completely cold by the third bite. When we asked the waitress to warm it up, she brought back a fresh serving, which was nice, except that it arrived in a cold bowl and was tepid in nanoseconds. \n\nSo, overall, go to Kate's and have some pancakes. I heartily endorse the lumberjack breakfast, which I've had on subsequent visits, which covers all of your possible breakfast needs. The egg sandwiches look amazing, too, and I'd bet on the French toast. Just stay away from the biscuits and poseur gravy, no matter how tantalizing the description seems.", "author": "Mary R."}

The last time I was here my boyfriend had to stand up about 7 times to let the waitress get past.  The wait time is usually really long, and that's because people lazily sit at their tiny table and drink the over-priced coffee for far too long.

It is a literal mountain of food. You know it's going to be interesting when your dining companion's jaw drops open when she sees it. It's french toast topped with yogurt, fruit and granola. When I ordered it, it never occurred to me that the french toast component and the fruit/yogurt/granola component would be unified. I thought I'd get a plate of french toast and a bowl of yogurt/fruit/granola. I have to say that although I liked every ingredient, I didn't like them together. I wanted to slather my (totally great, and I am a snob about these things) french toast in syrup, which I couldn't do with the yogurt int he way. (Heck, I could barely get to the french toast with the yogurt in the way!) Plus, the yogurt down by the french toast was warm. Eew. Word to the wise: if you are ordering the orgy, order the components to be served separately. Or, just order the french toast. \n\nMy companions were also happy with their breakfasts (egg sandwich, pancakes) and we all left stuffed and satisfied.\n\nI did knock off one star for not having soy milk. I really, really wanted to have some coffee, but they had no non-dairy creamer of any kind. And my tummy just can't handle the milk. I think this is bizarre at best, for such a popular SF place.

I tried to go this morning for a quick bite and had a horrible interaction with the server that has made me never want to come back. I showed up rather early after a really early appointment desperate for coffee and and food. It looked empty when I approached so I looked for posted hours which I didn't see and proceeded to walk in. Not one foot was in the door when the server looked up from what she was doing and said, \"No! You cannot come in! We are not ready. You have to wait outside\". I looked to see what time it was. It was 7:56. Apparently they open at 8. I went outside to wait. At 8:05 I walked in to see if they were ready yet. I was hoping I could just dit down since it was cold and have a cup of coffee. The lady working looked peeved and said, \"I guess you can sit and I'll get to you later\". I just left. I obviously had pissed her off and I felt totally unwelcomed. I will put up with all kinds of bad food and lame service if the server is friendly. I understand after my tenure as a restaurant employee that things don't always go smoothly. I become far less understanding when I'm being yelled at and treated badly before I've had my coffee. There are many places to eat in this city. I will go to any one of them before I come back here.", "author": "Jenny L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-02-04", "description": "Because variety is the spice of life I decided to let this weekend be a Mission Pork Store-free weekend.  Because kicking an addiction is always hard, I must admit, my withdraw symptoms might have made me slightly more cantankerous than usual...but, I do try to be fair on YELP, always.\nFirst and foremost, as I walked in to the restaurant, my first thought was: rough around the edges.  The decorating is interesting (my boyfriend and I spent at least twenty minutes pouring over a full-wall mural of the US and all the exports for each state.  As a proud Missourian I was pleased to see not only were pigs, cows and corn represented, but also the Ozarks.  \nThe place is crowded, which is good, but it's too crowded: crowded in a chaotic, noisy, un-thought-out way, rather than designed to use space and eliminate noise.  Plus, the kitchen was open, but not in the charming ways of Zuni, more like an elementary school art classroom with a large window so you can watch you food being put together on and off...with the artistry of...the dudes that work in kitchen.\nAnd, to make issue worse, every time the table to our side was served we had to lean forward to accommodate.  I know it's SF, I know space is not of the essence, but planning and thought do eliminate if not alleviate issues of this sort.\nAnd the food.  Actually, I can't lie.  The food was pretty good.  The portions were too big, but that's not a problem, that's a must for brunch dishes.  The coffee rocked, the cornmeal and buttermilk pancakes were a delightful gritty masa texture that was so yummy I got told to keep my hands off the boyfriend's plate.  I was a bit let down by the potatoes--I like mine shredded and deep friend to a crispy sort of hash plate, but these were more J's Pots of Soul-style.\nGood for my liver and bad for my point of view, there was no alcohol.  And, I gotta say, a brunch with out mimosa is like a cock fight with out pecking.\nMy original thought was my final thought: well on it's way, but still very rough around the edges.  Once this place closes in the kitchen ceiling or creates a more unified open-kitchen look, gets a liquor lic. or starts serving sujou and figures out how to make the most out of a small space, I'm likely to give up pork store for good and become a one restaurant girl--but until that day, I pledge my allegiance to the pig.\nOh, and PS: never, ever name anything \"orgy\" anything.  I hate it.  I won't say it.  Even though fresh oatmeal and yogurt sound amazing on a waffle, I won't order a french toast orgy just like I won't order a chocolate thunda from down unda from Outback.  it won't happen.", "author": "Jamie H."}

The veggie scram promised the potential of this, but failed to deliver, rather oil drenched, no herbal/delicate dimension and that slip of the mouth feel wasn't olive or extra virgin coconut (i know, toss the health nut from her soap box before she gets too deep..). Anyhow, i'm unlikely to clamor for a return, esp w/ Samovar so nearby (uuuummmm.. egg bowl with seaweed..) but can appreciate the large portions post eve out that drive other more flex consumers of the cooked-oil-genre to its doors.", "author": "Rachel S."}

We were all ready for some good \"down home\" breakfast goodness - and every single thing was a bit \"off.\" My friend had an omelette with bacon, and the bacon had a weird texture - almost like veggie-bacon or something, The omelette wasn't very well made (too fluffy and not dense enough) - though few places make really good omelettes. The potatoes were burned beyond \"crispy\" and flavourless. Whole Wheat French toast and . . .no butter? What's up with that? OK, the strawberries on the French Toast were good and fresh, but that's just sort of expected in SF. The hush puppies are more like cornbread. The weird funky biscuits are like a dense cheese onion scone, not flaky or light in any way. And the gravy - way gross. Takes a lot for me not to like biscuits and gravy - but it wasn't cream gravy. I'm not sure what you would call it. Almost like a thickened vegetable stock with some pesto added. Very herb-y and green tasting. Not what biscuits and gravy is supposed to be. Gravy is just  bacon or sausage grease with some flour cooked in it, half and half,salt, pepper, and maybe a bit of Tabasco. Why places in SF can't get that right is beyond me. I think it's all these \"vegetarian\" b&g choices and they just use the same gravy and add some sausage for non-vegetarian. LAME. Places need to stop trying to do these healthy/hippie versions of Southern breakfasts. IT JUST DOESN'T WORK. Don't be a fool and wait in line here. At least go up the street to The Pork Store. Sure, it's more touristy - but at least they serve something resembling breakfast. Or if you must be a hipster go over to Blue Jay instead. They manage to balance the Cali/Down Home thing pretty well.", "author": "David C."}

Arriving around a quarter to 12 on a Sunday, my stomach growling after having gotten back from SF marathon training, I am a bit disappointed to see the dreaded line outside Kate's Kitchen. But then again, this seems to be standard for brunching in the city. Luckily, you can write your name down and then go off to mind your own business, but since I don't live that close, I just sat on the outdoor bench in the drizzling fog and waited for my friend to arrive. We probably waited about 25-30 minutes before being seated at a cramped red checker table cloth covered table. As I had heard the portions were enormous, I opted for the short stack of buttermilk cornmeal pancakes with lemon curd, strawberries, and bananas while my friend went for the special of the day- a vegetable filled omelet with toast and potatoes. However, I wouldn't have known I ordered the short stack when the food arrived (incredibly quickly) as the pancakes (all three of them) took up the entire plate which was at least the size of a pizza. Wow. Now I was indeed hungry, after my long run today, but not hungry enough to even come close to finishing the pancakes. Although it was incredibly delicious, lemon curd and butter drizzling every which way and an abundance of fruity goodness-I probably only managed to finish a quarter of the lot. The omelet was good too- I tasted brussel sprouts and other interesting veggies you don't often associate with egg dishes. In summary, I liked Kate's Kitchen, if only for the name of it, but the food was pretty darn tasty and definitely bountiful.", "author": "Kate A."}

It's kinda hard to avoid, especially when my tummy demands to be filled with yummy breakfast food. I gotta say they have a pretty good deal if you come before 10am. I've never tried the flip egg but the Farmer breakfast is always good and consistent.  The place is very casual. I think most of the places around lower Haight tend to be that way. No over the top customer service. French Toast orgy is GOOD and the New England Flannel Hash is ok. Not really my favorite. Most of their dishes have generous portion. It'll definitely fill your tummy up. I would say it's a good place to go for casual breakfast but I wouldn't wait in line for them. That's why I usually go early morning or during the weekdays. It's pretty annoying too when they're full since their tables really close to each other. It has happened for quite some times when I couldn't get out of my chair without asking people who sit behind me to get up and move out of my way! Believe me, I am no fat ass!", "author": "Perry S."}

She never came back to check and I had to actually go over to where she was sitting with her boyfriend to flag her down.  She did apologize but did nothing really great after that.  Why we left her a generous tip had more to do with \"the hell if I know\".  Anyway nothing there about the place that would get me back.

Now I'm gonna tell you, then menu got me worked into a fever it looked so good!  Butter my behind and call me a biscuit, I had a darn tough time tryin to skinny down what I wanted for brunch.  They had everything hearty and delicious and fattening that I wanted, but in the end, everything was better on the paper menu than it was on my plate.  I got the special breakfast sandwich which was tasty enough, and the cornmeal pancakes we're pretty decent, but in general everything seemed like it had been prepared several hours ago and it wasn't all that flavorful.  The homemade sausage patties were a bit dry and the potatoes were surprisingly bland but at least not oily.  On the upside, Kate's a cheap gal, she only stole 22 bucks for brunch for two.

Who else would order the Corn Beef Hash breakfast, as well as a side of biscuits and gravy (even though there was no one there to share it with)??  That's just insane.  I guess I have a death wish because I really really wanted both.  The hash was realllly good, big chunks of meat with home fried potatos, onions, and carrots, with two eggs on top and toast on the side.  The biscuits and gravy weren't the greatest for me - the biscuit was a little bit thick and tough for my taste, and the gravy a little bland.  It was good with some hot sauce, salt n pepper to spice it up.  Good coffee too.... I have also been here on another occassion and gotten the Flanched Flarney Blarney (not sure if I got that right) - which is a fried egg sandwich with your choice of meat - it's pretty good.
