Also, I rarely drink coffee (maybe once every four months??). Decided to try the Philtered Soul (hazelnut, chocolate) but tbh I didn't think Philz was necessarily better than your standard coffee shops (again, I'm a coffee noob). My palette for distinguishing flavors in coffee obviously needs work. Aside from the flavor though, the caffeine kicked in. Ohhhh did it kick in at 3PM... 4PM... allllll the way until now. It's amazing how much sleep I'm losing. Truly.\n\n3 stars for the taste. 5 stars for the coffee doing its job. Well played Philz.... too....well........", "author": "Cathy C."}

Unfortunately, I was really disappointed with the quality of coffee. \n\nAlthough the atmosphere is great and the staff is very friendly, my coffee tasted a little burnt and odd. I got the Philtered Soul, and couldn't taste any Hazelnut coffee at all. I could barely drink half of it before I gave up and threw it away. \n\nMy friends later told me to try the mint flavored coffees, so maybe it was just the one flavor. But I highly recommend against the Philtered Soul - save yourself the trouble and just grab something from Starbucks!", "author": "Will W."}

Because of its prime SoMA location, I imagine this is a very busy stop during the weekdays.\n\nEmily L. and I came for their classic mint mojito coffees (creamy, please!) on Pride and were pleasantly surprised by the overwhelming support for the LGBTQ community when we arrived. In addition to each barista having an assortment of pins proudly announcing their support for different genders and sexualities, this Philz also had a multitude of flags and a chalkboard explaining who each flag represented. My barista also asked if I'd like rainbow sprinkles on my drink in honor of Pride weekend -- um, absolutely! It was lovely.\n\nDecor aside, the drinks were as good as usual. The mint and cream really take away the bite of the strong coffee, and the large left me energized for many hours to come. Unlike the Embarcadero location, the baristas here did not overfill the cup with ice, so I got a well-sized portion for the amount I paid. It seemed that the line for mobile orders was longer than the line to order in person, so if you have to get a drink within crunch time, you may want to evaluate which is faster.\n\nI just really wish they'd ask for a name on the order and call out the name, rather than the drinks in the order.

True drip coffee freshly made with plenty of fresh mint on top. Amazing! I have yet to find something like this in Manhattan. Incredibly smooth and not acidic at all plus just enough of natural mint flavor. \n\nThere are many different options for each type of coffee roast choices. I haven't tried their pastries and other light fare items such as avocado toast w/ sliced hard boiled eggs, etc. Looking forward to trying some of these when I come back for breakfast/brunch later this week!\n\nI love their spacious open area with local art works & plenty of windows for natural light. Some folks are doing some light reading and working on laptops. Plenty of customers simply grab & go.\n\nAll of their barista/staff seem naturally friendly -- or is this San Francisco culture? (relatively speaking compared to Manhattanites) Makes me want to consider moving to SF. And 52deg F sunny winter weather definitely helps!

The baristas are friendly and knowledgable, the WiFi is free and fast, and there's ample seating if you want to stay and work for a little bit. There's one longer wood, communal table, 2 more comfy chairs on a corner, and a smattering of 2-seater wood tables. The space is filled with natural sunlight, lots of windows, and the communal table is nicely separated from the hustle & bustle of people ordering and paying for their drinks.\n\nOrder your drink with one of the baristas (pick light, medium or heavy on the cream and/or sugar) and then go to the counter to pay for your drink (even if it's not ready yet). My favorite is the Philtered Soul, but the descriptions listed under each blend should help steer you in the right direction. I got the Chai tea with some almond milk, and it was delicious. It's not your typical latte like most places where the tea is just boiling water and a tea bag, too much sugar, and some milk. These teas are delicious and my be my new obsession since I've pretty much cut coffee out of my diet. The chai is pretty spicy, strong, and will keep you well caffeinated.\n\nThe music they were playing was similar to Spotify's \"Tropical Morning\" or light EDM - think Kygo, etc. I found the music to be quite enjoyable, but it probably rotates and your taste in music is probably not the same as mine. But the coffee and tea is delicious, they have Pepple's donuts, pastries (croissants, muffins), breakfast burritos, if you want to complement your drink with breakfast or a bite to eat. I'll definitely be back here - it's nice to have a free WiFi coffee shop to go to that is not Starbucks or Peet's. \n\nThey take credit cards & Apple Pay (NFC) - if you pay with that, it's much faster than a normal credit card!", "author": "Christina L."}

Honestly, all coffee tastes the same to me.  My rating scale is very simple; good coffee, bad coffee.  I got the Silken Splender which is a medium blend with hints of dark cocoa, nuts, and butter. Good coffee. \n\nIf I were to compare Philz with the other competitors, I would say their coffee is the best but also the most expensive.

There seems to be a new Philz popping up everyday in the city. Which is a good thing. \n\nLet's first get one thing straight - every single Philz location is five stars. Period.\n\nI've been on a quest to try every flavor of coffee available at Philz TWICE. Once with cream only (which is how I normally take my coffee), and then a second time \"Philz way\" - which is supposedly medium sugar and medium cream. I'd figure when something is named after the restaurant/bar/deli/chef/owner/etc, there's a reason for it and I want to experience it they way it was meant to be experienced by the visionary who created it. No one wants to view the Mona Lisa with the salad dressing on the side. Experience it for how it was meant to be experienced!\n\nThey have a nice selection of light, medium, and dark roast coffees. So far they've been all good, and I can't quite pick my favorite.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go to Philz. Now!", "author": "Richard S."}

They sort their coffee by Roasts. Every single cup is specially made to order. None of that drip coffee nonsense. My favorite thing at Philz is the avocado breakfast toast. I also tried one of their breakfast wraps and it was eggcelent.", "author": "Hanan Q."}

If you can, I recommend you come here after 9:50am, the long line miraculously disappears since all the white collar have to go to work by 10 (how sad:P)\n\nWith many outlets, free wifi, and clean restroom, this is also a good working place if you don't mind billboard type music.", "author": "Alice C."}

It's on my way to the pharmacy across the street so I'll only  go when I have to renew a prescription\n\nAfter  you order you have to walk to left (thru people waiting)  to pay, then walk back to right, thru all the same  people waiting for their coffee, to sit and wait.    Then to leave after picking up your coffee you go thru the same crowd of people to get to the door.\n\nAnd since they don't take your name, and barely talk above a whisper when the coffee is ready, it's very confusing when to go get your coffee.  I was trying to pay attention to who was ahead of me in line, and who was behind me.  But then my order was ready before people ahead of me, and then We were all wondering whose order it was.", "author": "Foodlover B."}

While the weekdays will easily be the busiest with the extra 100,000 or so commuters in the SoMa office buildings doing their work thang, the weekends will likely prove that there is A LOT of pent up demand in Rincon HIll for neighborhood businesses like Philz that can provide a spot where faces become more familiar and frienships form.  2016 is going to be a very exciting year for Rincon Hill - and I think Philz Coffee at Beale and Folsom Streets has kicked it off with its opening on December 14, 2015!\n\nFirst, I gotta admit that I do not consider myself a coffee drinker.  Second, I've been to Philz twice - both the Saturday and Sunday of their first week of operations.  I had the Tesora with medium cream and sugar on Saturday, and it was delightful! I like that the barista had me try it out after she prepared it and called my name \"to make sure its perfect.\"  On Sunday, I had the Dancing Water, and it was very good too - though I think I personally enjoyed Tesora more. \n\nThe baked goods I've tried were high-quality treats - a persimmon danish on one visit and a chocolate croissant on another.\n\nI'm so excited to have this business join Rincon Hill's other neighborhood joints like Local Kitchen, Cocoon Urban Day Spa, and Spice Kit.  The coffee is great - and that comes from someone who has very rarely drank coffee in his life.", "author": "Jamie W."}

And Peet's delivers that stroooooooooong flavor that I yearn for. I was peer- pressured into trying Philz.  Philz opened a location near my office and became the hot spot for meetings and the necessary 3PM fix.  I admit, it took several tries before I found my coffee heaven. Again, I like my coffee strooooooooooong - no cream, no sugar-  at the recommendation of others I tried Jacbob's Wonder Bar (hated it), Ambrosa (hated it), Philtered Soul (not so bad, but not great)  before I found my heaven with Ether.  Ether is literally the best coffee ever! I've become an addict.  I also absolutely love the Isantbul tea (a mixature of black and green tea).  \n\nAlso, kudos to the great staff!  The staff ensures that your coffee or tea is made to your liking.  \n\nI mostly frequent the Philz Coffee on Folsom because it's close to my office, but I also want to send a shout out to Philz Cofee in Berkeley (@Shattuck), where I frequent to get my weekend fix.  Again, always a great cup of coffee or tea and great service.  \n\nThe only negatives are -  the cost, but the good stuff is rarely cheap!  And locations - can we please get a location in Oakland?! Even Alameda?!", "author": "Tina B."}

I'm writing this poor review, because I went to Philz today and ordered the coffee I order every time--Silken Splendor, low-fat version, no sugar. When the coffee was ready it had sugar and I told the woman that it had sugar and she was defensive, telling me that no, it was only the low-fat version...it was super sweet and I order this coffee all the time. Finally, she said she would remake the coffee. When the coffee was ready for a second time it was awful--it tasted watered down and flavorless, I threw it out. I was so disappointed! 95% of the time I am SO happy with Philz, but this experience really bummed me out.
