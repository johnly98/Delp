Working in the downtown area during their death defying practice runs, I can honestly say they get so close to the buildings that you can almost touch them as they literally scream through. You actually hear them before you see them, having a top speed of over mach 1.7. Crissy Field is a perfect place to see these amazing supersonic jets, it offers \"enough\" parking during this event, but you still have to arrive early to stake your space as they fill up fast as it gets closer to show time. The venue is also large enough to allow everyone a good view of the jets as they perform their death defying acrobatics at speeds close to the speed of sound, and if you're lucky, they may even entertain you with a vapor cone at transonic speed just before booming through the speed of sound. Literally with a loud audible boom! If you want to view The Blue Angels air show in San Francisco during Fleet Week from Crissy field, plan on getting out there around 11:30am to stake a comfortable claim on the field, spread out your towels, food, drinks, and assorted toys like a football or baseball or frisbee to keep you busy. Lay down, enjoy a nap, enjoy a book, enjoy the company of your friends and family, and enjoy the unmatched San Francisco views while you wait for the air show to begin. A number of other airplanes like the Team Oracle biplane and The Patriots Jet Team participating in the show will start to fly around 12:30pm. Just before the Blue Angels start to fly, you may be entertained by a United Airlines Boeing 747 flying so low to the Golden Gate Bridge you might even get an urge to call Homeland Security. But rest assured, it's part of the show, at least for the many years I've attended. And just moments before the Blue Angels start to appear from the Sausalito and Tiburon skies, the Navy Aircraft C-130 affectionately known as \"Fat Albert\" will put on a dazzling show of acrobatics, flying at a 90 degree angle straight up towards the sky which is no small feat considering the husky build of the plane. My family and I have enjoyed watching the Blue Angels since my son was 2 years old, minus year 2013 when the Blue Angels were absent, my son is now 13 years old and the show is still one of the big events he looks forward to every year.\n\nhttp://studio-v.wingsdomain.com/featured/blue-angels-f-18-super-hornet-7d8055-wingsdomain-art-and-photography.html\n\nhttp://studio-v.wingsdomain.com/featured/blue-angels-f-18-super-hornet-7d8129-wingsdomain-art-and-photography.html\n\nhttp://studio-v.wingsdomain.com/featured/blue-angels-f-18-super-hornet-7d7948-wingsdomain-art-and-photography.html", "author": "Wingsdomain.com V."}

Our perch site was the upper platform of the Sausalito Ferry Terminal. We chose this site for viewing, figuring Pier 41 and the Fisherman's Wharf/Pier 39 would be very crowded. We even sat in the shade and we were comfortable...very comfortable.\n\nSitting and/or standing, we were able to catch some of the spectacular maneuvers of the Blue Angels, roaring by at a very rapid pace. It was an awesome sight and there were plenty of oohs and aahs from the spectators around us. Sometimes I lost track of them in the bright sunlight. However, I still enjoyed and appreciated what I have seen - the precision of these jet pilots performing the amazing feats on a beautiful day.\n\nWe will return to the same site with our folding chairs to watch the Blue Angels next year, which is the upper platform of the Sausalito Ferry Terminal.

I grew up in Oshkosh, WI, which for those who don't know is the home of EAA Oshkosh (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oshkosh_Airshow), the largest airshow in the US and quite probably the world.  It's a celebration of flight in all its forms, everything from cessnas, to homebuilts, to stunt pilots, to the largest gathering of WW2 aircraft anywhere, to the most modern military jets.\nGoing to watch these planes do their thing every year as a kid was totally inspiring, and a large part of why I ended up becoming an engineer.\n\nSo that said, I love the Blue Angels.  Sure, they're military, and they're expensive, and they pollute, and they're loud.  But (excepting the military part) so are fireworks.  And fireworks are awesome.  Similarly, astoundingly high performance jets doing amazingly complex aerobatics at wickedly high speeds are also awesome.  Not only in the \"we as humans are able to create things which are capable of this\" way, but also in the \"the people who fly these are unbelievably skilled\" sort of way.\nPlus, the kid in me totally loves it when he sees a jet streak silently past, and then a few seconds later hears the huge-ass roar.  So cool.\n\nAnd for those of you complaining about the \"environmental waste\", lets do a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation.  There are only 6 of them.  Each plane carries about 10,000lb of fuel.  For comparison, a 747 uses about 100,000lb of fuel on a 5-hour flight.  So worst case, if they managed to use their entire fuel supply each time, each air show or practice is the rough equivalent of one 747 flying from SF to New York.  Compared to the number of commercial jets flying around the globe in any given moment, that's reasonably insignificant.

Look, I'm as progressive as anybody else in this city, so I recognize self-righteous bullish*t when I see it. And 99% of the negative reviews for the Angels on this site are just that. If you hate them that much, make plans to deal with it. It isn't a surprise, they are here every year. The planes are not armed, they aren't celebrating war, they are just plain badass. And though I despise how much $$ this country spends on defense, and am outraged over wars in the Middle East, I have zero problem with the best pilots in the world demonstrating how incredible these machines are. And yes, I get a little thrill knowing that the Navy is out there, ostensibly at least, to protect our shores. Get a grip, one-star posters, and let your hair down a little.

San Francisco banned the Blue Angels for noise abatement and a near mid air crash, yet SF gets all the revenue from Blue Angels and Fleet week. Oakland and the Port of Oakland cash in on use of the North Field at Oakland Airport. The Blue Angels roar about 500 feet over the tops of residences in Alameda as they take off fully loaded with fuel. Alameda gets the peanut shells. Has the Navy brass and the FAA not considered the death toll and damage to homes should one of these fighter jets crash on take off? We have Moffett Field and Travis Air Force Base that could be easily used as their base. The saddest part is that Alameda residents are put through this fear and thundering noise, yet the Blue Angels did not come over the former Alameda Naval Air Station even once to satisfy the onlookers from all over the East Bay who had gathered on the base to watch the jets high above.

We watched today from Treasure Island as they maneuvered and barrel-rolled me into a love affair with the US Navy.  I had been told to go to Crissy field or Coit tower to get the best view, but after reading a thread on Yelp, we went to Treasure Island.  And the poster was spot-on!  As I sat on the rocks and the Angels were approaching, I found myself instinctively ducking and covering because they were coming in so low.  The view from TI was incredible, and the noise was deafening and it was magical.  I could see them start over by GG park and Crissy field, then shoot over downtown SF, swing around TI and Angel Island and back again.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-05-13", "description": "Little known fact: the Blue Angels were originally called, \"The Annoy Cats and Small Children Angels.\"  In fact, the mission of the Blue Angels is to train 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, spend countless days away from home and family to annoy the people they have sworn to protect against all enemies, foreign and domestic.  They spend months and years overseas, away from their families and loved ones, in some cases earning less than minimum wage, often in dangerous situations, just to have the chance, to one day, possibly annoy the cats and dogs of San Francisco.\n\nThere is no sought after position in the military more than the \"Annoy San Francisco Cats and Dogs Angels.\"  In fact, the Marines who spent Christmas in Iraq and Afghanistan fighting an enemy that kills innocent civilians and beats women for wanting to learn and their Marine and Navy brothers in the sky, braving anti-aircraft missiles and artillery, were just training to come back to the States and fly missions in San Francisco to annoy cats and dogs.\n\nIt has nothing to do with providing the American people a glimpse of their military.  It has nothing to do with providing a little entertainment.  It has nothing to do with instilling pride in America and its strength and force.  Its sole purpose is to annoy the cats and dogs of San Francisco, to show a big dick and to wake people from their naps.\n\nNext time, you or Billy Bragg may want to look upon those loud machines and think about the men and women, who fly, ride in, and maintain them.  Ponder the sacrifices they make in providing this nation with the warm blanket of freedom we all enjoy.  Maybe you might even imagine how much more disturbing it would be if you were not sure what country the planes were from, or whether they were going to attack your beautiful neighborhood.  But you shouldn't worry too much about that, because they will not let it happen.\n\nThe Blue Angels apologize for the noise... it is the sound of freedom.\n\nNo wonder why the rest of the country laughs at my hometown, San Francisco.\n\nThe people complain about the Blue Angels because it annoys their cats and dogs.  Well, so do fireworks on the Fourth of July, so does a police siren, so does thunder and lightning.  But, you know what?  I get the fuck over it.  And so does my dog.  And the poor bastard has a small dick and no balls (sorry Ike-my bad).\n\nYou can look at them as machines of war.  And, sure, machines of war fought off the Nazis during D-day, and fought the Japanese in the Pacific.  Wah Wah Wah, war is bad; So is tyranny.  And don't like the war in Iraq?  Fine.  We did end up fucking that one up.  But, don't sit in your air conditioned office drinking your non-fat latte and complain and lecture to the world about war.  You can hate war and the politicians who cause war, but the one week where this city faces the men and women who make sacrifices to ensure we are safe and that nobody will fuck with us, put all your ideology aside, and thank them for their service and for your freedom to be an asshole.  And don't make this into a \"big dick, small dick, testosterone\" thing- you just look bitter and stupid.\n\nAnd I love the argument about wasting taxpayer money?  Seriously?  I wonder what the % of the Defense budget is spent on the Blue Angels.  San Franciscans lecturing about wasting taxpayers' money?  We spend taxpayer money on parades that celebrate all aspects of our society, from cultural parades to gay pride parades.  And we should, b/c it celebrates what makes this country great.  But, you really don't care about taxpayers money. Besides, the Blue Angels bring a lot of revenue into San Francisco, so that pretty much ruins that argument.  Don't like the traffic?  Now we will cancel everything in San Francisco that causes traffic problems.  There goes the Bay to Breakers, the Gay Pride Parade, and all the great festivals San Francisco has.\n\nOh, and if you do fall of a ladder b/c of the Blue Angels, your lawsuit will be laughed out of District Court.  And shattering your ear drum from the Blue Angels?  Are there a lot of San Franciscans falling off ladders and going deaf during Fleet Week?  Stop being bitter, some complaining about dick size, shave your legs, go outside, be thankful for the freedom you enjoy, drink a beer and enjoy the show.  Life is good if you let it be.  You may not like the war, but the people who serve in uniform do so with many sacrifices in dangerous situations that you couldn't even imagine.  Soldiers and Marines die on a daily basis trying to better a country that faced 30 years of oppression.  Sure, our politicians, both Democrats and Republicans, fucked it up, but when you see someone who signed the dotted line and took an oath to serve something more important than himself or herself, shut the fuck up, go up to him or her, shake his or her hand and say, \"Thank you.\"  Then ask yourself what difference you have made in the lives of others...

Today they seem to be in the air as they come screaming by every few minutes but it's even more overcast today. Safety concerns have been voiced for years over this event and, thank the Gods/Goddesses, nothing has happened so far. What really got me was the comments from disappointed, pissed-off people who 'drove for 45 minutes' and 'scrambled' to find seating for the show. The Blue Angels need three miles of visibility to perform their stunts. What? You want they should crash into each other or into buildings just to satisfy you disappointed onlookers? I say go to a NASCAR event..you're sure to see some spectacular crashed there! Oh, and I researched how much it cost to do one show...8000 gallons of JP5 fuel per plane at $1,378..that's six planes using up a total of about $8,200/per show. Dang! I bet their Chevron cards are steep at the end of the month! Oh, right, WE pay for that, right?  And don't get me started on the Columbus Day parade! Wonder how many Native American's are involved in this event? Crappy weekend.", "author": "michael s."}

Sadly, the politicians have removed the real fun of it, having them fly low across the City when starting the show. However, it's still a gem. Go USA! Down with the whiners!", "author": "T.J. K."}
