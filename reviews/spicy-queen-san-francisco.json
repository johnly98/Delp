I very like  hot pots and I'm willing to try all types of the hot pots. Chinese, Korean, Japanese, etc. \n\nReferred by a friend, went to Spicy Queen Szechuan Cuisine to try the hot pot. This is the far better hot pot than any hot pot restaurants I have tried before. We have the half and half soup base with the original and spicy. The original soup was so fresh and tasty, and the spicy soup was even better, the soup was hot and delicious. It added the spicy favorites to the meats and vegetables. The spicy dipping sauces come with the orders are very good too. \n\nThe services are excellent and the waitresses always come to our table to make sure we have everything we want. \n\nParking was no problem when we are here on Tuesday evening at about 6:30pm. We have a street parking in front of the restaurant. \n\nI know I'll come back again and again every time when I come to San Francisco.

I would say this place is a very legitimate Szechuan flavored Chinese restaurant. Came here for the noodles and chicken and I would say both tasted very authentic and had the right amount of Mala. For those who don't know what m a l a means it is a type of spiciness where your mouth and tongue feels slightly numb tingling from the Szechuan peppercorn. I took one star off just because the restaurant felt too cramped for me and also the AC could have been turned up.", "author": "Ben C."}

Don't let this intimidate you, it was very flavorful. It's not ayce so you pick the plates of the items you want and dipping sauce is extra. \n\nHe ordered the fish, fish balls with roe, enoki, Napa cabbage, quail eggs, tofu, greens and marinated beef for me. I'd skip the marinated beef because I'm used to thinly sliced beef and the beef was small thick cuts of beef probably better in a stir fry dish. I was actually really surprised by the amount of meat though for the price it was. I'd consider trying one of their other meats or not because I was happy with everything else. Fish ball roe is a must if you've never tried it. The roe in the middle will knock your socks off.\n\nThe spicy side of the pot caught me a bit off guard but turned out to be not that spicy. Being this is food from Sichuan I was expecting it to be numbing and tingling but thankfully it wasn't any of that. The flavor tasted of a citrus, peppercorn, star anise flavoring and I love how the flavor infuses into the fish, tofu, and quail eggs. I didn't order sauce but the food seemed flavorful that it didn't need sauce. \n\nThe other side of the pot was a little on the plainer side and I can't describe what the flavor was will have to ask for more details the next time I visit but the more items we dumped into it the more flavorful it got. Best part was they refilled our soup pot towards the end and my friend suggested I take the non spicy soup home and make porridge with it. *mind blown* did exactly that. It did not disappoint.

The outside of the restaurant seemed authentic...decorated in chinese characters and photos of the flaming hot szechuan dishes. The decor inside Spicy Queen is reminiscent of a local village hot pot shop. It has a fancy dining pagoda that seats 5, and several booths and tables equipped with the hot pot heating mechanism built into the table. \n\nThe food is CHEAP! Lunch specials are served M-F from 11am-4pm. It includes a variety of meat/veggie combos with rice for only $9!!! Or if you are ordering off the regular menu, those options are reasonably priced as well. There is the hot pot option: purchase the hot pot base soup, and order additional items to cook for your meal. I will say the dishes are a little on the oily side, but that doesn't bother me with szechuan style food. \n\nI highly recommend the following: \n-Tan Tan Noodles\n-Onion Pancake\n-Ma po tofu\n\nA nice addition to your stay in the hot pot kingdom is free green tea! It's served in the HEAVIEST teapots allowed in this galaxy. The density alone could introduce a new black hole. \n\nService is not great. That's the ONLY reason Spicy Queen is not receiving 5 stars. The servers are not the most attentive to timing with orders and bringing the free tea out. Always be sure to ask!

They serve authentic Chinese food from the Sichuan region. \n\nHotpot: you have to try their segmented hotpot because it just look so damn cool. It has holes between the segments so the broth is actually one pot, except for you can locate your food better. It is filled with pepper which looks scary but it's not too spicy that you lose your ability to taste. My husband who usually order mild in restaurants thinks that it has a good kick but is still very edible. The choices for hotpot is below average because they serve a lot of other food than hotpot. I like to order lamb, beef, fish fillets, lotus root, mushroom, and tofu. \n \nOther dishes: Dry saut\u00e9ed string beans, Couples delight, scallion pancake, wuhan hot dry noodle, moo tofu, and House special land ribs is TO DIE FOR! It is authentic xinjiang lamb, which is very rare in the US.\n\nTips:\n1. Their menu has photos next to nearly every dish, which is very helpful for non-Chinese diners. \n2.

Definitely on the reorder list!\n\n- Sliced Pork Belly in Spicy garlic sauce (4/5): cold appetizer that isn't spicy. Overall it was good, the thin slices of cucumbers made the dish a tiny bit healthier, I guess. Not sure if necessarily need to reorder this dish since there are so many other items on the menu to try out.\n\nEntree:\nSilly Tofu & Chicken in Numbing Sauce (3/5): I was a bit worried that I'd lose all my tastebuds and wouldn't be able to taste all the flavors but that wasn't the case. It definitely had a kick to it but at least for me it wasn't all that spicy... my tolerance for spicy food has gone up though. If you're sensitive to spicy food.. opt for another dish since \"numbing\" is the highest level of spiciness. As for the dish itself.. I definitely wouldn't order it again. We were forewarned that the chicken had bones but this was literally more bones than meat.. it seems like it's small pieces near the cavity of the chicken. The dish was also way too salty..

I have had high hopes, and a lot of great deal of Sichuan restaurants experiences, both in China and in the states. We walked by this place since it first opened, like million or so times. Really hope that it'll be good. \n\nFood is oily. I have never had a Sichuan hot oil boiled beef dish with this heavy gravy sauce before. It's super salty, barely edible. I don't know what it is called. I can't imagine any Chinese chain restaurant could survive this kind of non authentic dishes, but maybe they made it for the Americans here, but still the restaurant is filled with mainlander Chinese, you think you'd get at least an authentic dish but no such luck. The ribs were deep fried, flavorful but seemed to be coated with MSG. The Dan Dan noodles should be easy to make, heck I make it at home, but it did not appear to even look like the picture printed on the menu. \n\nTable is greasy. The door is not shut and cannot be shut fully, and there was no heat, so we ate with our coats on, terribly cold winter night. The most horrific experience is the bathroom, where there were literately piss everywhere on the seat, a little dose of China right there and then. To give you slightly more of a taste what a lousy but typical chinese restaurant in China would do, they also announce that they charge a container fee, not much like 25 cents or something, but really? Can't you just built the price in? \n\nI have eaten in many different Sichuan places. My step mother was from Chongqing. I know what a mediocre place looks like: both in China and in the states. I also know when it's been Americanized and / or just a Taiwanese Sichuan joint. \n\nWe were debating between this one or Terra Cotta Warrior on the other side of the park. It was really a toss but I think we'd enjoyed it more there, at least it looked cleaner. \n\nHere is the silver lining of eating at a Chinese chain restaurant's very first outpost in America: you really can get just about anything in the Avenues. even a lousy Chinese restaurant that would be considered lousy in China.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-07", "description": "Really great place for spicy szechuan hot pot. We ordered the double broth hot pot ($8.95) , which gives you the spicy szechuan broth, but also the non-spicy herbal broth. It's great for those who love spicy, but also need something not as spicy to balance out. The meats, fish filet, mushrooms are all $5.95 and the vegetables/tofu are $3.95. There are plenty of options - my favourite is the fish filet because it's really good when cooked in the spicy broth - the fish remains tender.\n\nThe service always seems to be a bit slow here. I don't think they have many servers and the place gets really packed. Good idea to make a reservation prior to coming as to avoid long waits. But I definitely recommend if you have a lot of time to chill/eat with friends.", "author": "Shihyung H."}

Walking through the main dining room, I was directed to a set of stairs midway down to the left leading there.  It's definitely roomy and comfortable as there were sofas positioned around the big screen.\nArriving a bit late, half of our party of fourteen were enjoying (not really, since the Warriors trailed early on) the game while the other half were having conversations at the large circular table for fourteen.  To secure this room, our organizer negotiated a set dollar minimum ($500.00) for our party.  They ordered appetizers and small bites to start and it was BYOB which is a nice perk for those wanting their choice of imbibe.  We munched on a variety of small marinated dishes like preserved egg, tofu, seaweed, pig ears, and chicken (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q); the green onion pancakes weren't bad either.  As everyone's appetites grew, everyone returned to the main table as the waitress set up two burners, one already imbedded in the table and another electric tabletop one (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  The main burner had two broths, an herbal one with goji berries and a spicy one that looked intimidating but wasn't that bad; the tabletop one had a special spicy lamb broth which I didn't try since it was a bit of a reach from my seat.\nThen, came the proteins which included mussels, shrimp on a stick (easier to cook), thinly sliced beef and lamb, and an assortment of veggies and tofu skin, tofu, quail eggs, enoki mushrooms, and fish and meat balls.  Trying to pace myself, I took my time which proved to be at my disadvantage.  Around 8:30 pm, the power on both the in-table burner and the plug in burner both shut off... as in there was no electricity.  Interesting since the large screen TV, the wall mounted smaller TV, and the lights were all still operational.  After about thirty minutes of searching and checking the wire, fuses, and other causes for this disruption, our waitress found an old school gas (butane can) burner, but only one for fourteen people.  As the game winded down after a gallant Golden State comeback, the Cavs prevailed and most everyone was hungover from the loss.  Also, since the restaurant closes at 10 pm and it was around 9:30 pm before the burner was back on, we decided to order a variety of drinks, appetizers, and green onion pancakes to bring our total closer to the minimum; we ended up around $330.00 before gratuity and, given the technical difficulties, the owner was kind to waive the minimum for our particular situation.  Nothing really stood out and the situation was awkward and unusual since we didn't get a full taste of the potential of this place.  \nWill try to come back and give it another try, but the experience left more of a bitter taste than a numbing one.", "author": "Mike C."}

BULL$HIT service.\n\nFor a place with hot pot, you would think that they would know it would require more attention. People will need UTENSILS, DRINKS, refills on broth when it gets too low in the pot, refills on their tea, MORE FOOD WHEN WE RUN OUT. It was such a burden to get water. It took over an hour and several requests. Whenever I did ask for something, the one waitress made it seem like I was bothering her and caused her suuuuuch annoyance.\n\nAnd yea, we came with a group. When it came time to pay the bill, we were calculating the best way to split it. They only allow the bill to be split between 2 cards. Fine with us, we didn't have an issue with that policy.  BUUUUUT the female waitress muttered in Mandarin that we were troublesome. YEA I HEARD YOU, FREAKING BIAO ZI! They didn't include automatic gratuity even though were were a group larger than 6. Spicy Queen probably should because with their terrible attitude and service, nobody in their right minds would tip them.

I ordered beans and meat sauce noodle. I once had it in Chongqing, and this place made even better taste of it. \nSome restaurant mistakenly think Szechuan food is only about spicy. But it's not. The real Szechuan cuisine has rich aftertaste - after the mouth numbing spicy, you should taste some sweetness, as well as the delicate flavor of the ingredient itself. That's the fascination of Szechuan food - the complex taste burst in your mouth. Unfortunately, only a few restaurant in the Bay Area could do that. \nSpicy Queen exceed the standard and does very good job on balancing the flavor. The noodle I ordered is not too spicy. The beans and the pork are perfect match. I will definitely order it again.", "author": "F. Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-19", "description": "I had a great time at Spicy Queen tonight. Growing up in a first generation Chinese-American home, with highly fatigued, over worked immigrant parents from Hong Kong, trying to keep their heads above water, managing language barriers, balancing being acclimated, yet Chinese; my mother couldn't always explain everything verbally to an Americanized son. But one thing she wanted me to fully comprehend in my vernacular was artful cooking through demonstration. Good Chinese cooking through balanced umami flavors, skilled cutting, quality ingredients, vibrant array of textures, attentive cooking and surprise elements of freshness. \n\nOften at various Chinese restaurants within SF, I know they are missing the mark--overburdened kitchen staffs, fast turnover demands, mediocre ingredient sourcing, overuse of cornstarch--leading to passable, but ordinary flavors, and sloppy presentation. \n\nSpicy Queen is none of those things. My guest and I ordered modest dishes--scallion pancakes, spicy oil cold tripe, and a lamb hot pot. But each dish was remarkable. The scallion pancakes were thin, crisp, served hot, that you'd only receive from a highly skilled cook with good practice of temperature, oil, and kneading. The spicy oil cold tripe was tender, artfully cut in easy to eat bites, generous in seasoning with a surprise of sweet vinegar, sesame seeds, crisp, fresh soy sprouts, and refreshing cilantro. The hot pot, oh the hot pot, generous, flavorful slow cooked broth, authentic, unique vegetables combinations, high quality lamb with just the right tender layer of  skin, rustic, and real. \n\nNow for novice Sichuan eaters, just know the primary feeling in the dishes is heat, but within that numbing heat, are nuances--tang, sweetness, savory, nutty. Spicy Queen satisfied all of it. \n\nEach dish arrived in careful sequence, severed at the right temperatures, portions were generous without being overwhelming, served in elegant organic form ceramics and steel pots akin to the practices of the best eateries in Mainland China. The interior is compact, but comfortable, and again, possesed an adroit flow. It was artful--all of it--the kind that affirmed what my mom tried to teach me through many years of patient teachings. Attention to detail, the high level of quality, was all given at kind, reasonable price points. I felt the same kind of love you receive from your most cherished family cooked meals. The quality was 100%. \n\nThank you for a great time! This restaurant is a gem. The staff is caring, elegant, and understated. I hope that things stay the same here, because I hope to keep a great relationship with this restaurant to cherish. I know my mom would definitely be a supporter of this excellence.", "author": "N T."}

Ordered up plenty of meats and veggies along with rounds of Tsingtao beer. Overall the food was pretty good, the service was rather slow as it seemed there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant on a Tuesday night.", "author": "Shane B."}

I had sore throat so ordered some noodle and asked for non spicy option for one of them. And half hour later, our dishes finally arrived. Not only the wonton tasted not fresh at all but also the waiter brought my noodles covered in spicy sauces. The waiter refused to change my noodle to non spicy one and insisted that I didn't specify the non spicy option when ordering. He refused to order more food for us as well. It is ridiculous! Worse food and service ever!", "author": "Linda S."}

The quality of the meats such as chicken and beef is not high. The beef taste mediocre and the chicken taste pretty horrible, It's the spiciness of the dishes that make its OK to eat.

I brought a cake and there was no additional charge which was very nice of them and they also provided new plates and forks for the cake (which they didn't have to do). The food tasted really good and came out fairly quickly. I will be coming back here again and this time to try hot pot. The only reason i didn't give 5 stars was because of the way the food came out we got the chicken out first but not the rice with it, by the time the rice came out the chicken started getting cold. The other thing is the service wasn't quick but the guy who was working was really nice and always had a smile.", "author": "Nelly L."}

I mentioned that they may keep it on the milder side.  Rather than a hot pot to cook, the chefs had cooked everything and the food was sitting in a pool of oil and red peppers. This was not from the lunch menu but from the hot pot selection.  More like $$$.\nSince it was lunch, I didn't know whether this was the norm.  All the ingredients were soggy and oily.  It was only mid-meal did I see other customers with hot pot style.  By then, it was too late to return.  \nHot pot, maybe yes...but didn't get to cook.  Pre cooked....no way.", "author": "bernie s."}
