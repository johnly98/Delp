(#potential)\n\n2) the cook had to find a clerk to get my order started\n\n3) the clerk was in a corner LOOKING AT ME while he dried dishes.  Let me clarify, he was only drying  one dish (a tiny bowl).  (#hellaWeird #dishesCanWait #howDryDoesThatBowlHaveToBe)\n\n4) with limited seating, an employee was sitting in the back of the restaurant - taking up three seats - doing ...  taxes? or doodling? or creating a vision board?  Sometimes, it pays to have a smidgen of situational awareness..  (#dontMakePatronsStand)\n\nThis is not a minor rant, I can withstand substandard service, but this was egregious.  Management can find better resources to run this place.  If I had the time, and the patience for sweet sweet revenge - I'd open a burger spot right next door with awesome service ... just to put them outta business.

After all, what kind of idiotic local would find himself looking for a place to eat on that strip of commercial excess and moral depravity? I guess that would be me. Y'see, I was finding myself strolling down Nob Hill thinking I really wanted a bite and landed in the Burger House since it was relatively quiet on a Thursday evening. Now I've been to Hubert Keller's Burger Bar in Macy's, so I figured I needed to try what the peasants eat at street level. I'm a people-person after all.\n\nIt's an odd set-up where they have the world's skinniest counter in front of the grill and prep area, and the place is saddled adjacent to a Cafe Bellini and a pizza place. Yes, it's a suburban mall court next to Union Square to appease the tourists. There was a free stool, so I parked myself after ordering the $6.25 double-patty Super Burger with all the free toppings and of course, the $2 Virgin Fries (see photos). The size of the burger was certainly right, and the lettuce, red onion, tomato, jalapenos, and secret sauce were all in there and accounted for. By the way, is the secret sauce a tribute to Jack-in-the-Box?\n\nYet for all that effort, something tasted a bit off for me, and I have to say the texture of the meat was a bit too mealy for my taste. The fries, however, I really liked because they were thick-cut (...no jokes please) with the skin left on and a bit on the wilty-greasy side which I prefer when they're that big. They give you quite a hefty portion here, and I couldn't finish it which is rare for me as you know. So the next time I want to feel like I want to replicate a shopping mall experience without having to schlep to Tanforan or Serramonte, then I have an option that isn't outside my Clipper Card zone.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...big but average-tasting burger with stand-out fries\nAMBIANCE - 2 stars...compact space and oh-so mallish\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...nice guy manages the place\nTOTAL - 3 stars...if Hubert is not part of your Google+ circle, well...", "author": "Ed U."}

I ordered a burger and while I waited, of course, watched the staff making my food.  The woman flipping the burgers took out raw meat with her both her bare hands and placed it on the cooking surface, then she used those same hands and grabbed the buns and started slicing them.  At this point I should have asked for my money back, but I'm not bold enough to say \"give me my money back you just gave my burger salmonella\".\n \nI got my burger and took it back to work.  When I bit into the burger it was completely raw in the middle, and I'm not talking medium rare, I'm talking RAW.  So, I microwaved it.  Finally, I could start eating my burger with the crappy crumbling bun  Half way through my burger I notice that the burger is still raw in some parts even though I had already zapped in the microwave!  Gawd, how much raw meat did I eat?! I tossed the burger in the garbage. I also remembered that the one other time I came to this place my burger was under cooked as well.  I must have blocked out that memory.  There's good seating here and it's in a central place, but the hygiene practices here are just too much of a risk to take.", "author": "Theresa C."}

But service is poor and so is the food. They seem to have three people working the kitchen and the counter at one time. One for making the crepes/desserts, one for the freshly mixed drinks, and the cook who makes the burgers and fries. Because it's a small space with an open kitchen, you can see EVERYTHING they do behind the counter. The service is poor and slow because they're talking to each other while not doing anything, because one person is asking another person to interrupt their task and complete their order for them, or they are just poorly trained.\n\nI ordered the cheapest options on the menu, a junior burger, fries, and a fountain drink. This small meal still came out to over $9.00.\n\nI could tell right away that my order was going to take long to make. A woman before me gave me a disgruntled look and I could tell she had been waiting for a long time already for her order. As I patiently waited, I watched the staff behind the counter and it made me wish I couldn't see behind the scenes.\n\nWhile waiting, I noticed how talkative the staff was. I have no problem with this, actually, I think it adds to the charm of a place. But when you're talking and just standing around when you can be cleaning something up, refilling something, or helping the next customer (and there were these things to be done), it pisses me off. At one point, all three of the staff left their areas completely unattended while they were preparing the food! This one man was ordering the girl making drinks to finish up his order, when she was clearly busy finishing orders of her own while taking the orders for the next customers. The cook would constantly pause, chat with her friends who were there, or walk away from view.\n\nThe thing that bothered me most was the lack of CLEANLINESS. I was right in front of the poorly trained girl making drinks with raw fruit. She had one glove on while grabbing the chopped up fruit, but she also used the same hand to touch EVERYTHING else! The counter, the fridge door, utensils, machines, and at one point, even the POS register! She never took her glove off, and she continued touching the raw fruits and placing them into the blender! Someone needs to re-train this girl on food safety and kitchen hygiene. The cook would also walk away for a few minutes, touching God knows what and then touching the food.\n\nThe food wasn't that great when I finally got it. The fries, which I was most looking forward to, were soggy with oil. The burger was okay, just needed some ketchup because it was a little dry. The meal was definitely not worth almost $10.

The coupon I received showed a very tasting-looking burger with lots of cheese hanging out all over the place but in reality they charge you extra if you want cheese. Boo. Our order took a long time for a casual burger joint. When it was finally ready the guy seemed to have forgotten that the coupon included a soft drink as well so I had to ask for that. Soft drink machine was out of ice.\n\nRegarding the food itself, very \"meh\". Decent burger, kinda small. Fries not so good, extremely dry and a very small portion. Walked away hungry.\n\nAs a 7 dollar \"bargain\" deal it was passable but I would have been PISSED had I payed full price for what I got as it would not have been cheap.\n\nI would recommend walking a few blocks to Pearl's at 6th and Market, similar price but MUCH superior quality.", "author": "Mike J."}

Ok, I'll give them points because my burger was a good medium. \n\nThe patty was seasoned well, had a good sear, and the special sauce (I'm guessing which is just some sort of thousand island) was good. Structurally, the bun held well and didn't get soggy at all but that's because it was dry, thick and not toasted enough. They just run it through a toaster conveyer rather than on the grill. I was confused by the measly pickle spear that made it's way into the burger. Spears should be served on the side because otherwise you get bites with mostly no pickle and the occasional bite with pickle. But it was so tiny anyway that it didn't really add anything. There was also an overwhelming amount of red onion on the burger.

I had all but decided to pass on this place (yes, based on that one experience) when my co-worker suggested we eat there last night.\n\nWe started our meal with the avocado/bacon burger, cut in half, which was dee-licious. We split a second course of onion rings, and these were not the kind of onion rings with that thick batter that doesn't ahere to the onion. No, these were dredged in flour right in front of us, and came out with a thin, crispy crust that actually stuck! The third and final course was another burger. We got the classic burger with the condiments that usually come on the salmon buger. Also fantastic. \n\nSo, instead of passing on this place, I decided I love it. Oh, our server, Katelyn, was super nice, too.", "author": "Vanessa R."}

However, when looking for something to eat late you have to appreciate the quick options in the area even if they are gear towards the tourists! \n\nI desperately needed some food but just wanted something basic. So I ordered the Classic Cheeseburger ($8.25) and upgrade to cheese fries ($1.25). The burger was good, flavorful but not too greasy. The cheese fries left much to be desired. While the fries were good, they were covered in what can only be described as the world's weakest nacho cheese sauce. I was expecting real cheese or at least a nacho cheese sauce with some cheese flavor, this version tasted more buttery than cheesy. \n\nThe dark chocolate milkshake was good. However, I thought the portion was very small for the price ($5.95). \n\nOverall I was happy considering it was late night food. Not my favorite burger joint but worth going back in for the burger and plain fries!

What else can you ask for ... My first time ordering a burger from Burgerhouse( to go) and let me tell you... it was delicious for less than $10.00 dollars you get a 1/2 pound of hand-formed Niman Ranch 100% angus beef, I order mine medium well and it was cooked to perfection. It came with thick and very tasty french fries but the other best part was the Bun \"OMG\" additionally lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle and they must have a secrete homemade sauce because it was very, very tasty. The place is simple you go to the counter and order (just like that ) but the flavors are huge and very exquisite. Try it !!", "author": "Ernesto C."}

I ordered the Buffalo wings with a side of \"fancy fries\" and it was okay. The place itself is pretty small and they share the space with a pizza shop, which happens to be operated or managed by the most annoying lady. She voluntarily moved a chair that was next to me with mine and a friend's purse without even asking me or giving me a heads up. Seating was a bit of an issue since we were limited to two tables outside, or a few cramped ones inside. The food itself was filling, the wings weren't great, the taste was a bit dull and overpowered by the dressing they offered as a side. The fries were just like any other you'd find at any random restaurant. I'm not giving the place three stars because on my visit here I was rudely interrupted by the manager of the pizza restaurant that we had to share seating with; she had moved the chair I had placed next to me with mine and a friends purse without telling me and once I scooted it back closer to me, she rudely asked me not to do it because I would block the condiments that were easily accessible without my things in the way.", "author": "Diana L."}

If you want a good burger you can go to the Jack in the Box, This place, or Burger Bar. I choose Burger House. The service and wait time kind of suck so I call in my order. It's a bit on the spendy side, but you're hard pressed to get lunch for under $10 anywhere around here unless you go for fast food. The fries are AWESOME. Definitely worth a shot if you are a local and work in the area-I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. If you're a tourist and want a good burger, walk a few blocks and treat yourself to The Grand Cafe.", "author": "Nitalia P."}

They said with the groupon offer I can only get their basic \"classic beef burger\" ~$8.??.    This was mention Nowhere in the  groupon offer.   I ended up not eating there, not because of the price difference (only ~1$) but because of their unethical service.", "author": "Alex S."}

My girlfriend and I purchased Groupons for this restaurant and looked forward to using them. When we showed up, the cashier rejected our Groupons. Let me clarify: the Groupon printout states it is good for \"A Gourmet Burger and Fries.\" Nowhere on the voucher did it say which type of burger. Furthermore, the value of the voucher is, according to Groupon, 50% off. Seeing as how we purchased the voucher for $5, my math skills tell me that the voucher should be worth $10. Well, the cashier said we can only get the cheapest burger, which is just a patty and bread. We asked if we could speak to her manager, but she replied that she has no idea where the manager is at the time. When she talked to her co-worker, her co-worker came and said if we could wait an hour at the restaurant, the manager MIGHT show up. I asked if the manager could help, but then the original cashier chimed in and said the manager would be taking their side because they're right. Nice job, Burger House. We decided not to use the Groupon at all and just left.", "author": "Stanley C."}
