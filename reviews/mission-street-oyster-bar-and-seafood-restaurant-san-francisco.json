I'm not really a big Oyster person, but I love seafood. I tried the Ahi tuna steak and the caesar salad with prawns. Both really good picks.\n\nI feel like caesar salads are a underrated art when done really well. \n\nYou can tell this restaurant puts a lot of care and attention into their food. The menu is definitely a little on the pricey side, but they do have happy hour all day from Friday-Sunday, so I will be back for drinks.", "author": "Cynthia G."}

They have happy hour which wasn't exactly super deal but since it happens all day on the weekend so any discounts would still be nice. The HH menu is basically just some 2 dollar oysters and, 6 dollars for a bloody orange cider, and 8 dollars for a glass of wine. There is also premium oysters for $3 each but we chose to opt out.\n\nAmong all the 2 dollar oysters we tried, summerset was our favorite, it was flavorful and creamy. \n\nAwesome place, will definitely go back for more oysters!", "author": "Jas L."}

I've been to places where they had happy hour for $1 each oyster or $1.5. So this place was $2 for regular oysters and $3 for premium oysters. But honestly, my friends and I couldn't tell the differenced between the oysters but maybe that is because we aren't sophisticated enough.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, the oysters were super fresh and really delicious. The reason I gave this place a 3 star is because their other food items are pretty mediocre but heavily over priced. Everything else on the menu was at least $20 but didn't hit the spot in my defense or satisfied that seafood craving. We had the fish and chips which was $20 and I've had better at the city fish and it was $7.\n\nIn the end, we thought the quality was decent but overpriced.

Immediately we were greeted with a smile from the owner's son as he seated us and helped us with our drinks before the waiter arrived. \n\nThe daily oyster menu had 5 varieties of fresh oysters and we got 3 of each. My favorite was the Chesapeake Bay oysters. A bit creamy and briny. Yeeum. Fyi, any month with an \"R\" in it is good for oysters. Usually the colder months. \n\nNext we got the Dungeness Crab Cocktail with avocado. Wow the crab meat was sooo fresh and moist.  Super clean and refreshing if you're watching your calories. It was so good we got another order. Obviously we're not counting OUR calories \n\nThe Spicy Shrimp Scampi did not disappoint. Five large shrimp cooked to perfection served with saut\u00e9ed broccolini, carrots and potatoes. \n\nBut the star of the show was the Fresh Whole Dungeness Crab served in a delicious herbed broth.  The crab was so plumped and fresh and  the meat came easily off the shell. You can tell un-fresh crab because the meat will shrivel inside the shell and when you crack a claw, there is a bit of air space between the meat and shell. This meat was plump and moist. I could've drank the herbed sauce with a straw. \n\nThey have a good wine list and a nice selection of beers. It was a slow Monday night but nevertheless the service was grea\n\nWe will definitely be back. \n\n\nHappy Eating!!", "author": "Toan D."}

They were all incredibly delicious and exceedingly fresh tasting. As good as oysters get. They served it with lemon wedges, mignonette, and a traditional cocktail sauce that rocked, due to it's VERY fresh horseradish.  (The cocktail sauce was so good that I finished it with a spoon after I ran out of oysters.)\n\nFor my entree, I ordered a stuffed petrale sole. I haven't had that in years. Again, this dish was a home run. The petrale sole was stuffed with small bay shrimp, some sauteed mushroom, onion, etc. The sole was perfectly cooked, with a big of very light browning on the outside which added incredible depth of flavor. The fish was served on a bed of creamy, buttery, flavorful mashed potatoes (nicely seasoned, just the right amount). I was not enthused about the potatoes when they told me that is how they serve it, but honestly, they went together perfectly. There was also a lovely medley of whole carrots, kale, and broccoli. I love vegetables and these were as with everything else, perfectly cooked and delicious.\n\nGiven my raving, why did I only give it 4 stars?  The service was a little disjointed and getting my check took a while. Everyone is very nice, but I kept seeing different waiters. The place is very casual, and a nice place for a group meal, a quiet dinner, or a quick detour to get yourself some delicious oysters. Prices were very reasonable for what you get. I can't wait to go back, now that they're on my radar screen. Wish I had found them sooner.", "author": "Carol M."}

We arrived a few minutes after I called, and to our surprise a table was already set for us! \nWe went ahead and started with 2 dozen oysters while we reviewed the menu. The waiter kindly explained the different varieties of oysters but there were so many I couldn't even remember which ones were which as we dined! As we went through our first round of oysters, we all decided to get bowls of clam chowder and a serving of garlic bread as well as beers/wines. Their house wines were pretty affordable, but I knew we had a long night ahead and opted for only one glass. The clam chowder was delicious though! There were a lot of goodies inside, and it wasn't too heavy like some other chowders I've had in life. There is also a cup option which is a lot smaller than the bowl, so go with that if you want to try a wider variety of menu items. The garlic bread was decent, but nothing out of the ordinary in my opinion. I'm glad we shared it as a large group because I only wanted a little bit - if I'm on vacation in SF I'd rather have more oysters than more garlic bread!\nService during our meal was decent...waters were filled occasionally, and when we accidentally knocked over a glass of wine someone came by with a big wad of napkins and helped clean up the spill. Though I didn't actually use it, there is also a restroom inside and my teammates that did go said it was decent as well. \nOur dining experience ended after a few more rounds of oysters (because really, how could you not?!) and by then most of us were pretty oystered out. Our server let us split our check three ways, which was very helpful! \nThanks to Mission Street Oyster Bar for accommodating our large party and offering great oyster deals! I'll for sure be back during my future SF adventures. \n\nTL;DR - walkable from Dolores Park, skip the garlic bread, and $2 oysters all weekend!", "author": "Jasmine W."}

The restaurant was nice enough to make me pay for just the oysters I ate (12/24) and waved 2 glasses of happy hour wine but it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

We love oysters and were determined to get oyster-wasted on my last night in town. \n\nRemember my fun oyster shopping experience at Sun Fat Seafood Company (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sun-fat-seafood-company-san-francisco?hrid=xupN2YDs8PNGFuC-0xVi-w&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct))? \nMission Street Oyster Bar happened just 30 mins after that. \nWith our fresh live oysters bagged & tagged, we walked down a few blocks to the MSOB for happy hour oysters & wine. Oyster pre-gaming at its best. \n\n* Open Monday thru Sunday 12:00 P.M. to 10:00 P.M.\n\n* Happy Hour:\n- M-F $1.50 oysters from 12:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M.\n- Sat-Sun $2.00 oysters ALL DAY!\n\nThey have 5 varieties of oysters daily. These were the specials just for that day:\n\nFANNY BAY: Meaty larger oysters with a nice milky smooth finish. It's a bit firmer than your kumies or miyagi oysters, but still fresh tasting with a light crisp finish.\n\nCHESAPEAKE BAY: Sweet and creamy. Not very briny but still tasty.\n\nKUMAMOTO: These small but plump kumies are one of my favs to eat. Buttery succulent fruity flavor that resembles a mix of cucumbers and honeydew melon. Just lovely!\n\nBLUE ROCK POINT: Medium-sized oysters that is great for oyster noobs. I just like that it's nice and salty.\n\nMIYAGI: Up there as my other favorite with the kumamoto oyster. Mildly briny and just perfect with a squirt of lemon. \n\nWe chose to start off with the 10 mix ($15, $1.50 each). We just wanted to sample 1 each before deciding which ones to order more of for the next round.\nhttp://bit.ly/1MXku2u\n\nEnjoyed every one of them so we repeatedly the same order for our 2nd platter, but added 2 additional Miyagi Oysters to make it a full dozen ($18). \nhttp://bit.ly/1LFVzyw\n\nCALAMARI ($13.95): \nThere was a good amount of calamari rings but only a couple pieces of tentacles (the best part!). The crispy thing batter had a terrific crunch, while the calamari still retained its tenderness on the inside. \nhttp://bit.ly/1PjPE9Y\n- Served with a rich tangy tartar sauce and house cocktail sauce. My friend and I both preferred the tartar sauce, since the cocktail sauce was blah without the much needed horseradish.\n\nWe each had a couple rounds of their happy hour wines to go along with our oysters. \n\n Tempranillo ($6): My friend Kiko loves her reds so our server suggested she try a more diverse food-pairing wine to go along with our meal since we're having oysters and fried calamari. It's mildly acidic with hints of cherries and plum. She loved it so much that she asked for another one.\n\nHouse white ($7): I just got a chardonnay. Just a clean, crisp white wine to go with my freshly-shucked oysters. Yep, I'm boring like that. Step.\n\nService was fast and food was delicious as expected with fresh oysters. We would've stayed longer to try out more items but we still had our poor oysters & clams in bags sitting next to us from Sun Fat Seafood Company......fearfully awaiting their fate when they got home.

I don't give many ratings less than 4 stars. \n\nEverything that wasn't an app on the menu was about $23 bucks. I guess that 4 dollars less than the other place? But everything cost a lot!! The Caesar salad was $13 bucks. \n\nIt's an ok clean looking casual restaurant on Mission, amongst a lot of very cheap store fronts and garbage. I'm not too worried about the junk around it unless you're going to make more cost more than it should be - and this is the place. \n\nWe started with a platter listed as shrimp, oysters, and calamari - lightly fried, because that's what my newly 50 yr old friend wanted. Cool - it came out as a pile of over cooked calamari, 2 shrimps, and 2 charcoaled oysters (so cooked there was black burnt crust on it). Well - The one SHRIMP I ate was Excellent. But for $22 bucks it's way too much calamari - how about we skip 25 calamari rings and get a couple more shrimp on the place - very disappointed and I told Mellow (sp?), our cheerful waitress about it - she handled it well. \n\nI also bought the garlic bread for $6.50 - and it was very good. And the table beside us had this delicious smelling spicy marinara, - may I have a ramekin of that to dip the garlic toast in - absolutely, for $4.50 you can have some. I went for it - and it was Excellent - maybe even worth the 4.50. I just start feeling nickel and dimed. Do you want to charge me for a piece of lemon too? \n\nThere was this other guy working with Mello (sp?) and he had a very Sour attitude which sure as hell didn't help our experience. \n\nWaitress was great. One shrimp was delicious and I can recommend the spicy marinara sauce and garlic bread. so I'm bumping up one star.", "author": "Rew C."}

We walked in at 6pm on a friday night and were seated right away. The service was great. I actually only wanted oysters, but ended up being really impressed with the food. We ordered the two items most reviews recommended- the cioppino and pasta with prawns. \n\nThe cioppino was the best cioppino Ive ever had and Im not over exaggerating either. The amount of seafood was more than generous. The portion was perfect for 2 people- maybe even 3 because we had left overs. But it would definitely be way too much for 1 person. It comes with 2 pieces of delicious garlic bread, but I guarantee youll have to order more to dip in that cioppino. A half order of garlic bread is 2 pieces and a full is 4. Do yourself a favor and just get a full order. \n\nThe daily pasta w/praws with the roasted garlic, white wine sauce was also delicious! I never usually finish pasta entrees but this one I did. The size of the praws were huge and there were maybe 8 pieces. This pasta really exceeded my expectations.\n\nWe ordered Fanny Bay Oysters and I have to admit that of all the places Ive ordered these, this place had the biggest fanny bays Ive ever had. They were very meaty!\n\nIt was our first time at this restaurant and was even going to order a Calamari but our server was kind enough to warn us that we had plenty of food already with the cioppino and should hold of. Im glad she did that because we didnt even finish the cioppino. \n\nMy server told us this place has been open about 2.5 years but had just went through a renovation. The sign outside was changed and its been attracting a lot more business. Well it worked for me because I always saw their sign on my way to Boba Guys. When we stepped out of the restaurant, we literally heard 3 different couples walking by saying \"Oh cool, whats this Oyster Bar?\". Obviously, the new sign and renovation was just what this place needs. \n\nI really didnt expect much from this place because I havent heard much about this place, but my experience totally exceeded my expectations. I have to admit, as I first sat down I decided that if I was still hungry and not satisfied with the food here I would head over to Hog & Rocks after. Well, I sure didnt need to do that!

Now it could have been the bugs that may have infiltrated my scalp taking the 14 next to a sanitation-challenged passenger or maybe I was getting his dandruff by osmosis. But I just knew it was time for me to get off the bus and give it a try. I have to admit I got a little nervous since there was only one customer in the whole place at 7PM. Did people know something I didn't about the fish served here? Maybe even the guy with the dandruff and the gnat battalion knew. Nevertheless, I threw caution to the wind and stayed. Lots of shellfish on the menu and appetizers (photo: http://bit.ly/1ywM8Nm)\n\nAnd what's a classic seafood menu without a shrimp cocktail? Oh there it is. So of course, I asked the waitress what she recommended. Without hesitation, she said the Cioppino. I must get the Cioppino. Of course, it's the most expensive item on the menu. What does she take me for?... so I ordered the $32.95 Cioppino. But before I get into that, let me tell you about the $4.25 cup of Boston Clam Chowder I ordered. Thick and creamy enough to cut with a knife. Believe it or not, I prefer it a little watery since it tastes closer to the sea that way, but I wasn't complaining except they charge extra for bread and butter. Good thing it came with two baggies of oyster crackers which I used as a crunchy topping (photo: http://bit.ly/1xUgv0U).\n\nSo finally the Cioppino. A big flat bowl arrived with a pair of crusty garlic toast wedges on top. The rich red broth was slopping over the edge as there was an aquarium of shellfish: little neck clams, manila clams, mussels, huge prawns, crab legs, squid rings. All of it festooned with lemon slices and pepper (photo: http://bit.ly/11kTiJE). Pretty darn delicious though quite a chore to get through all the shells without getting the requisite bib. I'm the type that needs a bib for egg drop soup. I'm a splasher. For the plethora of bivalves and such, it was still no Swan Oyster Depot when it came to freshness, and I have to admit even the big bowl of fresh-off-the-ice sea life in the cioppino at Phil's Fish Market at Moss Landing still lingers in the memory. But hey, I'm coming back 'cause it's close.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...plentiful cioppino, quite a variety of shellfish\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...didn't scream fish house to me\nSERVICE - 3 stars...attentive at first but wavered as my meal went on and on\nTOTAL - 4 stars...come here for the cioppino if you don't want to hang in North Beach", "author": "Ed U."}

That was all I was going to say, but apparently I need to write more for this to qualify as a review. I was drunkenly walking down Mission st. when I stumbled upon this oyster bar. It was an overwhelmingly positive experience. I am traveling solo for work, so I was just looking for a place to sit and enjoy some food by myself. I'm a fan of oysters, so I thought why not, oyster bar sounds good. It was. I highly recommend coming here. Just do it. Amen.", "author": "Sam G."}

That excuse finally came when the hubby and I were looking for a lunch spot on mission before he went to work. I was in the mood for seafood, so this seemed like a great option. The decor is updated, but I think they could get better artwork on the walls cuz it's so cheesy as is.\n\n \nThere were only a few customers when we arrived, but we came during off hours so I'm sure this place can get busy.  The waitress was nice and told us to sit wherever we wanted. I was stupid and didn't double check yelp to see what to order, since it's been a long time since I bookmarked, so we got the seafood cocktail and regretted it because it was too bland. They needed to add some spice or something. Had I checked yelp I woulda known this cuz there are barley any pics of it and no one ever mentions it.....ugh. We also ordered the mussels and they were solid and a fairly large portion.\n\nThe best part of the entire meal was the bread! Holy crap, I could've eaten seconds and thirds of it but my stomach just couldn't stretch that far. I don't really like that you have to pay for it, but whatever. It was worth it and perfect for dipping in the broth.\n\n\nI'd say the prices are a bit steep and nothing stood out, except the bread, so I won't be back any time soon.

Our three criteria were: within walking distance of 21st & Valencia, no wait for two, and decent food. After a few stops, Mission Street Oyster was the first place we found that had open tables. \n\nTHE WAIT: None at about 8:30pm on a Friday. We were seated immediately - the place had several open tables.\n\nTHE COST: about $70 for two entrees and a beer. This was quite pricey, and my boyfriend thought that Anchor Oyster Bar has a better selection on the menu for a comparable price, better quality food, and was just a nicer experience. \n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE: It's like they couldn't decide between a sailboat, modern, and homey kitchen vibe. There's a half-hearted attempt at a seafaring theme up front with some boat paddles, lifesavers, etc. The bar has these sleek metallic lights that looked cool but didn't go with everything else. The bar itself is blue tile and the tables are simple wood, the kind you'd eat breakfast on at home. The walls are painted a bright blue, without much decoration on the walls. The whole place doesn't come together, it's kind of haphazard in an incomplete way.\n\nOur server was very sweet & came by often. She read the specials off a notepad (and mentioned the prices, which was nice) and I went for the scallops - my boyfriend got the crab cake entree. They ended up being very, very similar dishes and I kind of wish she had mentioned something about that, especially since I was debating the Frutti di Mare that she had recommended. \n\nDinner menu: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-street-oyster-bar-san-francisco?select=Gf_jxnL10hls7veYIZ6uNg#rVEraX56aVAX0caXRmbmMg\n\nAPPETIZER\n* Garlic Bread ($5.50) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-street-oyster-bar-san-francisco?select=Gf_jxnL10hls7veYIZ6uNg#Gf_jxnL10hls7veYIZ6uNg\nA really big serving - great melty cheese, strong garlic flavor, and crunch bread! This took a long time to come out - we got it after our entrees, and it should have come a little before. \n\nENTREES\n* Dungennes Crab Cakes (with potato wedges and vegetables, $21.95) - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-street-oyster-bar-san-francisco?select=Gf_jxnL10hls7veYIZ6uNg#JJ1BE8Q1nkqg1Jv0V8eXyQ\nThe veggies were just steamed, not much flavor. The wedges were spiced well, but the skin was a little dry. The crab cakes were moist and tasty, the dip fresh and tart. \n\n* Scallops (a dinner special) - 3 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-street-oyster-bar-san-francisco?select=Gf_jxnL10hls7veYIZ6uNg#89FyBDsxTGaYYNr_doWTVA\nOnce again, simple steamed veggies. The scallops are baked & breaded, I liked the stringy texture that was preserved, and it had a garlic-y flavor. The mashed potatoes had some chunks to it and were slightly buttery and garlicy as well. Good but not overly impressive.\n\nOverall, the seafood was good, but the dishes were pretty simple and not worth the price. I should have gotten the Frutti di Mare or Cioppino in retrospect! Would have given our dinner more variety and more interesting flavors.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

This place has \"happy hour\" that starts pretty early in the afternoon, so you don't have to wait til 5:30PM or so and fight the crowd. Their happy hour price is $1.50 per oyster. Great price (just half the cost of Hog Island), and tastes great and fresh! I think because they have happy hour daily (or at least M-F), their oysters are fresh.

The steamed clams and prawns were large and juicy. \n\nThe Cioppino was filled with tender fish, crab and mixed shellfish. The sauce was delicious and rich.

On top of that though, these guys have their service down. They have servers and waiters rotating in and around so quickly that you'll never be wanting for attention. Draft beer selection is just your standard one (Anchor, Lagunitas, Prohibition Ale, etc.), but it's only $6 for a pint, which is a steal for this day and age, particularly in the mission. The ambiance is decent enough with new chairs and tables, and the bar is clean. As for the food, I love the batter for the fish and chips. I don't enjoy the super briny taste to the fish, but it lets me know that the seafood is fresh. If you want bread and butter or garlic bread, it'll cost you ($6.50 for the latter).

They offer 3 varieties on oysters.  When I was there, they were: Chesapeake, French Kiss and Miyagi.  My most favorite one was the Chesapeake!  It had a distinct, seawater flare that I liked about it very much.  The French Kiss and Miyagi does so as well, but it wasn't as strong as the Chesapeake.\n\nIt was $2 per oyster when we went there during non-happy hours.  Happy hours are everyday and even weekends, between 3pm-6pm.  When you get there for happy hour, it is a buck per oyster.  I would totally go on a weekend between those hours!  \n\nThey offer other seafood entrees as well, but nothing really captivated my attention besides the raw oysters.

A quick Google search and I found hundreds of websites and blogs with people professing their hatred for them. Geez, harsh much? Admittedly, I'm not a fan of hipsters yet I regularly find myself in \"the\" hipster mecca of San Francisco: The Mission. \n\nI'm such a hypocrite. So does that make me a hipster too? \n\nIf only I could shoe horn my way into skinny jeans without looking like I have a camel toe. Anyhow...\n\nHipster mecca aside, The Mission is the breeding ground for the newest and hottest restaurants in San Francisco. Instead of going to Hog Island at the Ferry Building, my friends and I decided to check out the new oyster bar in The Mission for happy hour. \n\nWe were disappointed. My friends suggested 2 stars but I'll be nice and round up. \n\nI absolutely adore Anchor Oyster Bar (my review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/anchor-oyster-bar-san-francisco#hrid:p84AaAmuoJL-9jFCU8Esfg) and after reading that Mission Street Oyster Bar's owner worked there for 18+ years, I expected the same caliber in terms of food quality especially with their Fisherman Wharf prices. Not only was the food lackluster, the service was unorganized and snail paced, and the tacky teal ambiance left little to be desired.   \n\nIt seems the owner bought a taqueria and just added two flat screen TVs. Viola! A hipster \"oyster bar\" is born. Mission Oyster Bar is not an \"oyster bar\" per say as there's no seafood display and all the shucking is done in the kitchen in the back. It's very bare boned and all the empty space makes it uninviting. \n\nThe Happy Hour menu (everyday 3 pm - 6 pm) consists of $1 oysters (3 varieties), $2.50 draft beers, and one house wine for $7.  \n\nFour solid stars for the fresh oysters and offering three varieties: Fannie Mae, Chesapeake Bay and Miyagi (my fav) http://bit.ly/XiwjZk. DO COME FOR THE OYSTERS! They were super silky and sweet but a mignonette would have been better than the accompanying cocktail sauce. Kudos to Mission Oyster Bar's awesome oyster supplier. Unfortunately, all the praising stops there. \n\nWe decided to order a small sampling of the menu in the event we wanted to come back for dinner. The Clam Chowder ($5.50) tasted generic http://bit.ly/Y3999u. It was watery, bland, and there was barely any clams in it. Not only did it take 45 minutes to arrive, it arrived lukewarm. The much raved about Garlic Bread ($4.95) wasn't garlicky and was over toasted to a hard crouton http://bit.ly/YzSDwQ. The mediocre Dungeness Crab Cakes ($11.95) were made with minced crab meat not lump crab and similar to what I've bought at Trader Joe's http://bit.ly/15iWUZB. \n\nAnd then there's the service. The restaurant is understaffed and the staff lacks training. One waitress for 10 tables and the bar is not enough. We were never given basic things like plates, forks or spoons nor were any of the oysters described; they were just plopped onto our table. Our additional rounds of oysters were wrong (we wanted miyagis only) and came without lemon and oyster forks. Again, there was the 45 minute wait for lukewarm clam chowder which is inexcusable after two reminders to our waitress and one of the chefs.\n\nAfter being opened for 2 months, I would have expected for Mission Street Oyster Bar to have ironed out major kinks. Seems like they haven't. \n\nI will leave Mission Street Oyster Bar for the hipsters to have at it....", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

In fact I  looked forward this past Friday to try this new oyster Bar located on a couple doors down from Taqueria Cancun.  \n\nWe arrived around 5pm, still an hour before Happy Hour ends so we ordered  14 ($1) oysters to start and 2 ($2.50) Stella beers.  They have all the usual types, Blue Points, Kumamotos, etc.  My favorite being Kumamotos.  They are small but have a nice fresh and sweet taste.  \n\nAfter our oysters we ordered:\n\nCombination Seafood Salad $22.95: a combination of prawns, Shrimp, and Dungeness Crab. A generous amount of seafood over mixed greens and tomatoes.  Your choice of dressing. \n\nCioppino $28.95:  Delicious tomato based broth served with a nice amount of fish, prawns, shrimp, clams, mussels, and crab.  Maybe because it was colder than Bashar al-Assad's heart outside that night but the cioppino really hit the spot.  In fact I liked it so much I wanted to talk to the chef and it turns out he was a chef at Anchor Oyster bar for 18yrs.  It really shows in the food that Chef Freddie is a pro.\n\nOur waitress Maria was friendly and attentive.  The restaurant looks brand new as well as the restrooms.  The kitchen is in plain view so you can watch the chef and cooks preparing the food.  A couple flat screens at the bar to watch the games on.\n\nTo me this restaurant is a pearl in the Mission that happens to serve oysters..", "author": "Michael L."}

It wasn't bad, by any means, but it wasn't great either.  The oysters may have been inexpertly shucked, there was basically no brine left in many of them, which caused the flavor to suffer.  The oyster shooters were a bit mystifying, there was at least 6 oz. of liquid, *way* too much to \"shoot\" so I had to sip on mine for a while before I could knock back the oysters at the bottom.  Not bad at all, but a little confusing.\n\nThe ambiance also left something to be desired.  There are a couple of big marlins mounted on the walls, but other than that there really wasn't much going on in the decor department.  Nautical decor can be tough to pull off, but it's worth it to try.

But--This place is really good. Incredible oysters $2 each-- miyagi, fanny bay, Kumamoto-- all great, nice mignonette , really tasty. Fresh, delicious seafood except for the shrimp, which did taste frozen, but the sole was good. I like more seasoning, but they have tapatio on the table so it was cool. The Phil Collins background music was annoying & made us miss Anchor, where some of these cooks used to work. It's cool that they're here, the space is larger than anchor.

And now thanks to MSOB, my $20 promo is expired. \n\nBy the way, the food is ok... Oyster is fresh... we ordered 4 for each oyster, totally 16 of them, but they all tasted pretty much the same to me. I was expecting a little bit of change from different type of oyster. Totally no surprise. For the Mission Fried Special, the calamine is not bad, moist enough and crisp at the same time. For the shrimp, they are a bit over done. And last but not least, the fried oyster, it is average. But overall this dish is a bit under season, add  a small amount of salt will help the favor of the plate.", "author": "V L."}

We ordered two dozen oysters for the table and they were all super fresh! There was tiny bit of shell in a few but other than that very nicely shucked! \n\nTheir entrees were also very tasty and large! The cioppino was definitely a size for two. Seems like a standard dish offered at seafood restaurants in the bay area and although I'm not as familiar with it - it was very good and the garlic bread that came with it was amazing to dip the sauce in! We also ordered the spicy garlic prawns and this was also a very large dish and tasty.

The restaurant was clean and neat but slightly chilly with the door left open.\n\nMy friend and I tried their fresh oysters at a price of $2 each. Unfortunately, their $1.50 happy hour deal does not apply to Friday. Nevertheless, the oysters were very delicious, though the horseradish was not very potent. \n\nWe decided to share the Steamed Shell Fish Combination which was around $20. This was ridiculously good! It left the two of us satisfied and very stuffed. This dish included shrimp, clams, and mussels in a wonderful sauce. The sauce definitely made the dish. It was savory with a hint of sweetness. I'm not sure what ingredients were used in concocting this wonderful broth but there were tomatoes and a variety of fragrant spices. \n\nThe total bill including tip for two people was around $40.

We were the only ones in the restaurant at the time (3:30pm). Ordered the Mission half special (6 oysters, 2 prawns, and some steamed clams), as well as a bowl of clam chowder. While the seafood was good quality (I especially enjoyed the clams!) and the price was decent, I was really let down by the service. We received our food, and since we were splitting the meal we finished in a pretty reasonable amount of time, and decided we wanted to order some more oysters.\n\nWe waited for 20 minutes with empty plates in front of us waiting for someone to come by our table so we could order the oysters. Nobody came to check up on us, refill our water, or bus our table. We tried to make eye contact with a member of the staff, but they were all in the back of the room talking amongst each other and not paying attention to the only customers in the restaurant. I would totally have understood the slow service if the restaurant was busy, but there were at least 4 people working and nobody came by or acknowledged us, which I thought was odd. My boyfriend and I decided that if it was going to take this long for us to get our table bussed, there was no use trying to order more food. So after another 10 minutes of waiting, our check comes, we paid and we left.\n\nI would love to come back to this establishment, as I thought the quality of food was good.

My roomie and I were craving oysters by the dozen and headed over.\n\nNothing special inside, but clean and more family-friendly than the usual Mission restaurant. We sat at the bar and were quickly greeted by the bartender with water glasses and menus. We said we came for oysters so she explained each of the oysters on the menu. Decided to go with 6 Dutchboys and 6 Chesapeakes to start with. So good! The Dutchboys were sweet and plump, my favorite of all. We got another half dozen each of the Miyagis and the French Kiss. \n\nWe split a bottle of Enohe (?) wine; I didn't choose it; I would normally go with a white to accompany my seafood, but it's not all about me, so I compromised. The wine was mild and nice, just not my first choice with oysters. A bit pricey for the wine if you ask me, but worth the happiness of my friend. In all honesty I wanted a dirty martini but they don't have a hard liquor liscence (though they have been there for over a year...).\n\nThe music was Latin and loud, enough for us to both comment on to eachother. I would have liked jazz or something more mellow. Some low booths would be nice to fill in the place and make it a bit more cozy. They could also use more adversiting/PR: I had never heard of this place until I Yelped for oysters in the Mission, and it was pretty empty for a Saturday night.

A little on the expensive side with their $2 oyster from Friday to Sunday, but they make it up with their ambience and their amazing entr\u00e9es! \n\nFriday night around 8PM, a friend and I decided to try one of each of the listed oysters, and two of the supposedly best Konomoto oysters - small, but extremely creamy and flavorful. Our waitress was helpful in explaining the differences between all the oysters and recommended a few dishes as well. They oysters came and one by one we ate the biggest, or the least flavorful, to the smallest, the most flavorful. I have to say, it is true - the bigger oysters are typically more bland! If you all have a chance, definitely go for the Konomoto because I'm in love with it. I also love adding the vingerette provided, along with the lemon and and tapatio for an extra kick! Also, I recommend the house chardonnay with the oysters. It's a great match!\n\nMoving on to the next appetizer - The Garlic Bread (capitalization to emphasize how amazing it was). I don't know what these guys do to their garlic bread, but it is literally the best I have EVER tasted. The outside is crunchy/cripsy and the inside is moist and soft. I believe they light buttered the bread and then layered slightly browned cheese on top. Then lightly sprinkled a bit of pepper, basil (?), and garlic powder. Everything just sort of melts in your mouth and leaves a slightly delicious garlic taste aftertaste. UGH. HEAVEN. It was so unexpected, but brilliant. The appetizer comes with about five large pieces; I'd say equivalent to the size of a iPhone 4S, possibly a tad longer and definitely wider.\n\nNext was the Cioppino, which was taken from a yelp suggestion. It reminds me of a stew, but instead of vegetables, they use seafood. Using a tomato base, the restaurant adds a mixture of clams, muscles, shrimp and fish that blends well with the tomato broth. The sour tomato mixed with the sweet seafood gives the dish a slightly sweet, almost tangy flavor. I had no problem easily scooping out the contents of the seafood from the shells since it was quite soft. The shrimp does not have the shell, only the tail, which is easy to eat. It comes with two pieces of garlic bread, which I highly recommend dipping it into the sauce. \n\nTheir seafood is obviously of high quality. However, they could work on their ambiance a little more. It's a dark and dimly lit restaurant that creates a cozy atmosphere. However, I noticed that because the building is so large, I could often hear and occasional echoing. With the light chatter from all the customers, I definitely think that the restaurant could turn up the music a bit as well. I did notice, and love, that each table is kind of in their own little bubble. It's definitely a more intimate environment and they always keep your water glasses filled - props!", "author": "Annie T."}

Now I do understand that they were fully packed and way understaffed for a 3 day weekend, but we noticed that when she was serving the plate of dozen oysters to the different tables, she would actually make effort to explain the different types of oysters and where they came from, but when she was serving us the oysters, she just abruptly dropped them on our table, without any acknowledgement or explanations of the oysters, and left quickly. Now, normally I would let that slide because I understand that she was super busy and that the huge party of 15 white folks to the left of us was far more important, but every time she served us, she clearly looked like she didn't give a crap, and when we asked why did she bring out just one bowl of clam chowder, when we actually ordered three bowls, instead of being apologetic or even throwing a corny joke, which would have been the professional way to handle it, she instead complained to us how she was the only server for the night, and that we would  just have to wait for her to bring it over. \n\nNow besides the lackluster service, with the exception of the Mexican bus boy who refilled our waters with a smile and would actually ask us if everything was okay..

The dozen raw oysters weren't thoroughly cleaned since there were still some very small shell pieces in it and tasted flat and mediocre. \nNow on to the clam chowder...my wife makes a way better clam chowder than what we were served here! There was no rich creaminess of cholesterol heaven that you'll expect from a professionally well made clam chowder..I thought it kinda tasted like I was drinking a Campbell's soup can.  \nThe crab meat cocktail was not seasoned well and was lamely served with some cocktail sauce. The Prawn Alfredo was ok..but the prawns tasted frozen and the Alfredo sauce tasted like Italian amateur night.. almost very similar to what my 12 year old daughter can make at home. \nI can go on and bitch about the food more, but that'll just be a waste of my time..and your time reading it. Overall, we felt unwelcome, waited almost 40 minutes for just the appetizers to come out, and weren't  thrilled by the entrees at all. On the plus side, the bottle of house Chardonnay we ordered was quite good for like 25.00 a bottle... But then again.. You can't really fuck that one up.", "author": "Fontine D."}

First off, the crowd was like that at a sports bar during a major game.....LOUD!  The high ceiling makes the sounds of voices, dishes being placed down, glasses clanging, etc. amplified to an absurdly loud level.  We arrived when the place was half full and it was already questionable.  By the time we left it was about 80% full and so damn loud that I found myself nearly screaming across the table.  We both gave up trying to converse and hurried through our meal just to get out of there.  When we left my ears felt like I had just left a dance club.  We walked up and down Mission.  Every other place was quieter, even the full bars! \n\nFood:  Best ciopinno I've had in SF.  Garlic bread was very good too, but not the best I have had.  Raw oysters were fresh but tiny.  Oysters Rockafeller were a joke!  All it consisted of was the same happy hour small raw oyster with the garlic spread across it and placed under a broiler for a few seconds.  At $3.50 each it was insulting for a morsel as small as my thumb nail.  This was NOT oysters Rockafeller by any standard.  Service was friendly and attentive.\n\nIf you are adverse to a loud echoing room clinging with the sounds of plates and glasses coupled with patrons all screaming across the tables just to be heard then stay away.  You will hate it.  If you love ciopinno and want to have one of the best then come here during the off hrs when no more than 3 tables are occupied and enjoy it......good luck finding those circumstances though.  \n\nOverall, given the alternatives in SF many of which are mentioned in the other reviews I'd say skip it. \n\nPRICE:  Oh, and the prices are not cheap either.  We split one entree, had half a dozen oysters, one glass of their cheapest wine and a half order of garlic bread.......really just about what one person might order.....total was $72!!!  One entree, a drink, bread and an appetizer in the mission at a very casual seafood place.....NOT a good value no matter how you slice it.\n\nSMOKING---They leave the door and front windows open so that everyone walking by smoking might as well be seated at your table.  It gets really bad of the smokers stand right outside or by the store fronts next door.  Trust me.....they do!  If you are adverse to cig. smoke I'd stay away.  Eventually they closed the door and windows but each time the door was opened, which was frequently with all the people coming and going, the smoke immediately outside was sucked in.

The restaurant itself is very minimalistic and not overpacked with seating leaving the ambiance with a spacious, yet calming feel with slate blue walls adorned with ocean themed accessories.  I love the colorful marlin on the wall!\n\nMy bf and I ordered the full order of 12 raw oysters, four prawns and steamed clams for $32.95.  We ended up with yummy, fresh Chesapeake and Miyagi oysters which satiated our raw oyster craving.  The steamed clams came with four prawns and were a real buttery delight!  -perfectly cooked shrimp and nuances of flavors in the broth!  A pleasant woman with short hair who tended to us the whole time sold us on the garlic bread.  Great suggestion!  That was probably the best garlic bread we had ever indulged in!  It was regular French bread with butter, paprika, parsley, garlic and some cheese on top.  I think it was Monterey Jack.  It was the perfect addition to the steamed clams and frankly would be to anything brothy here.  Sorry no hard liquor here, but there is a decent selection of beers, IPA and wine.

He brought me a water glass (no ice, water was tap-temperature) and then took him about 10 minutes to take my order and another 15 or so to bring it out. Three slices of bread were toasted crusty, slightly burned on the top but nothing inedible, but had no flavor and the butter was just wrapped little pats. Not worth $2.50. \n\nThe chowder was thinner than I'd expected and very few clams, mostly potato that I could taste. Good flavor overall but bland; tasted, to be frank, like Campbell's clam chowder. Not what I was expecting. Needed some seasoning for sure, and more clams in it--- tasted like I was eating watery cream of potato soup.\n\nMy bill came to about $8, waiter dropped it off and after waiting about 7 minutes he never came back to pick it up so I just left cash (with his tip) and headed home.", "author": "Amanda R."}

Interestingly so, they all have a different texture and taste profile to them (sorry if I'm preaching to the choir).  Now for the main dish, I tried one of their specials, which was the crab stuffed sole.  Cooked to perfection, fish was nice and moist, amazing peppercorn sauce on top, served with the most velvety mashed potatoes ever.  My friend had their other special, which was the lobster and prawn.  Once again, delish!!  Seafood was sauteed in a wonderful buttery chile sauce, which gave it a little bit of a kick.  Would highly recommend trying their specials, and ordering the garlic bread to dip all the good sauces with.  Parking, not so hot.  Service... I feel that there were not enough servers for the place, which resulted in a little delay with everything.  Also, when it comes to reservations, they don't really keep up.  So my advice would be to get there about 30mins early, let them know you have a reservation so they can start getting the table ready, and hang out at the bar.

The entire place had a strange funky smell in it.  Old seafood?  Backed up sewer?  We couldn't place our noses on it.  We did push on knowing that we'd most likely get used to the smell (we did) and we were hell bent on eating oysters.   \n\nThe seafood was actually good.  Lesser than Bar Crudo, or Anchor Oyster Bar, but solid overall.  Nothing fancy, but seafood done right.  We ordered oysters on the half shell (3 dozen), Cioppino, and a Baked Sole entree.  Oysters & Cioppino were great - the Cioppino heavy with seafood.  Negative stars for their entree.  It came with the most uninspiring side of mashed potatoes and vegetables I've eaten.  The veggies tasted as though they were cooked in a pan full of burnt Teflon.  Bad.  Really bad.  \n\nOverall, the ambiance of the place is poor.  It's just cheap tables and chairs.  That's pretty much it.  I don't have issues with such a cheap set-up in and of itself, it's just that if you're committing to a $260 dinner for a party of 4, you expect more.  You certainly don't expect the place to stink like poopy feet. \n\nThe prices are the same, if not more than other casual seafood places in the city.  That's just wrong for what the place is overall.  Go to Woodhouse, go to Anchor, go to Bar Crudo, go to Hogs & Rocks, go to Swan Oyster Bar.  Don't go here.  Just don't do it unless you're in the hood and looking for some oysters for lunch.  I simply can't say it's worth it for any other reason.", "author": "Shawn S."}

At $23-28 per entree, this is one of the most over priced eateries in the mission.\n\nThe crab cakes were soggy and without the cocktail sauce would have been flavorless. The sole stuffed with crab was over cooked, dry and heavily salted. The calamari batter was bland. All in a low effort from the kitchen.\n\nOn the service side, things were pretty bad. I won't go into specifics for everything but a microcosm of the evening was the waitress took our forks following the apps and when entrees were delivered we asked for more forks - she proceeded to then go to 2 other tables to take orders. So as our food sat there getting cold without utensils to eat, she was taking drink orders.

THERE'S A PIGEON INSIDE THE RESTAURANT!! CLOSE THE DOOR!! THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO RID THE PLACE OF THAT PIGEON, AND WE DINED THE ENTIRE TIME WITH THAT BIRD WALKING AROUND US. (I'm sure this breaks a few health codes!)\n\nService was horrendous! We came in, and the bus boy \"greeted\" us by showing us our table, handing us our menu, and then walking away. In writing, this sounds normal, but his tone was completely monotonous and disinterested. He seemed confused when I told him we had a reservation, despite there being a couple open tables...he didn't really seem willing to help \"serve\" us.\n\nIt took quite a while before the waitress actually came by. It was \"busy\" (PLEASE...not even) enough that she didn't notice two people entering the restaurant to dine at their restaurant. Oh well...\n\nThe food was horrible. I'm always very weary about dining at seafood restaurants, normally because they are WAY overpriced or horrendous quality...or both!\n\nWe ordered the half order of their Mission Special (6 oysters, bowl of clams, and 2 shrimp), their fried calamari, and their Garlic Bread.\n\nFor their Mission Special, yea...the half order gives you 2 shrimp (ok...). We chose a couple of types of oysters, and the waitress got our order wrong (mixed up the types). They were fresh, but at the same time I just prayed we wouldn't get sick.\n\nThe clams weren't special, and the sauce was ok. The shrimp...big enough I guess.\n\nMy advice on the fried calamari...NEVER ORDER THIS...EVER!! THE WORST FRIED CALAMARI I'VE EVER EATEN!! You know those plastic bands people wear around their wrists? Think about chewing (eating) them, wrapping in \"batter\" which barely was present. Oooh, you could tell these were probably frozen at some point. Definitely NOT fresh, nor tasted anywhere close! We didn't finish our order.\n\nA highlight (after all we ate...definitely a saving point) was our garlic bread. Really warm and cheesy and soft - loved dipping it in the clam sauce. Amused that out of all the seafood we had, only the bread was good. Sad...\n\nHow much did all of this cost, you might be wondering? $45...yup, such a rip-off!\n\nIt completely baffles me how this place gets a 4 star rating. I feel tricked into coming here.

It was completely empty when I went in so service was naturally good. She server at the bar was pleasant and knowledgeable in her description of the different oysters they have on hand.  Her one mistake was one I didn't catch till I was on my way out which was she charged me 12 dollars for a wine that was clearly advertised as 8 dollars on their menu board. Not a huge issue and it was something I should have caught earlier. I'm just chalking it up to a simple mistake.  She really pushed the garlic bread as being the best around and it was certainly good but a pretty big title to throw around for some bread, butter, and garlic. But I guess if all your regulars love it I can't really argue.

Two large parties had the front of the dining room filled. Upon arriving, we were greeted by one of the servers - he was very cordial and asked us to have a seat at the bar while they prepped our table. From what we observed, there were only 2 guys working the front of the house and nobody stationed behind an awkwardly large bar. I'm far from a restaurant expert, but the place seemed under-staffed. The design of the room seems very confused, with an enormous granite-topped bar, deep colors in the dining room, two awkward mounted Marlin on the walls and then... an Open kitchen that didn't really add any visual interest. At least it appeared very clean! That's a positive - right? :-) When our Uber driver dropped us off, we thought we were being punked - the surrounding area is a little \"rough around the edges\" in a visual way. Being from Philly, I have a buffer for that type of thing.\n\nOn to the real reason for our visit - The Food.\nWe based our visit purely on the Yelp reviews and our desire for fresh seafood. We were not disappointed!!! We started with a variety of Raw Oysters, our server was extremely knowledgable and helped us assemble a hit list of their offerings. We did a Briney vs. Creamy selection - based on his coaching - Excellent and VERY well priced!!! We split the house speciality - Cippino. After finishing the oysters, we watched a dozen orders of Cippino come through the dining room - our mouths with watering!!!!!\n\nThe Cippino - Comes with the BEST GARLIC BREAD you will EVER eat!!! We were advised by our server to give a 5 minute warning if we wanted more... Do yourself a favor and ORDER another round!!! You'll Want it and NEED IT to sop up the heavenly juice from the Cippino. Our bowl was FILLED with: mussels, shrimp, clams, crab meat, chunks of fish and a broth that was LOADED with flavor. Mesmerizing.\n\nDrinks - we kept it simple: She had the Torontes (was a rather small pour for the $8.00 price point) and I had the Lagunitas IPA.\n\nWe walked away VERY satisfied with our visit. *I would rate the place higher if the room \"felt\" better.

Actually wanted Swans but forgot they are on summer break for a week. But very glad I got to try this place. Sat at the counter as the place was not very busy and wanted the feel of Swans. This place is run by a sweet Hispanic couple, husband runs the kitchen the wife waits tables. Had a dozen oysters: Kumamoto, Chesapeake Bay and another from Washington state. Also tried the Seafood Gazpacho which I highly recommend. The husband would stop by as he was dropping off food to other tables and show us each dish. Everything looked delish!  He gave us a free order of garlic bread which went well with the Gazpacho. Def coming back for happy hour $1 oysters and the soup looks great on a foggy day!", "author": "Stephanie T."}

I had almost lost hope trying to come up with an idea for dinner tonight and then it came to me: cioppino.\n\nNow let me start out by saying that I actually don't love shellfish and I probably only eat it once a year. I mean, it is typically prepared in such a way to hide the flavor as much as possible, often just poor quality (which is why you want to hide its flavor) and generally a pain in the butt to eat, \n\nThe cioppino at Mission Street Oyster Bar though is none of those things. The sweet flavor of the crab and mussels shone through the slightly spicy, slightly sweet tomato broth. The quality was clearly high. The crab was de-shelled. Ok the mussels were still a pain to eat as were the shrimp, but people seem to like having mussel shells and shrimp tails in their soup so what can you do?\n\nI was a little worried about the portion size. The photos here made it look rather small which considering the price worried me a bit, but it was more food than I could eat one once. \n\nI should note that I ordered this all via Postmates. There is always a risk ordering something like cioppino to go because of how it gets packaged. They packed it in a box (lined with some tin foil). It *almost* got to me in tact. I lost a wee bit of broth in the bag. Luckily, the box waited until I had started pouring it into a bowl to fully disintegrate. I'd be hesitant to order it again to go, but considering how good it was, I might risk it again.", "author": "Jordan M."}

We came in before their daily happy hour at 3pm and ordered clam chowder.  The portions here are very small considering the prices.  The clam chowder tasted very water'ed down.  As we waited for the oyster happy hour to start, a few other parties came in.  (BTW, we were sitting at the bar).  When 3pm hit, I ordered 6 - 2 of each type they have on special.  They give you 3 choices for happy hour, which is great.  I didn't get my oysters for 20 minutes - they told me that they bring the orders out by their ticket order, but one of the parties that came in after me got their happy hour oysters AND finished them, before I even got mine.  And, let me remind you, we were there before 3pm.  \n\nAnyway, I asked where my order was at 3:20pm, and shortly after, the waitress brings it out.  She leaves without explaining which oysters were which... another example of poor service.\n\nI must say, the oysters were great - fresh and ocean-y just the way oysters shoudl be.  I loved the local ones they had on special that day (see, the names aren't sticking anymore because the waitress didn't tell me!)  \n\nAnyway, I recommend coming in for the HH oysters ONLY and expect to wait awhile... a long while.  On the upside (or is it?), they're REALLY fast about giving you your check when you ask/ sliding your card and giving you your receipt.  It's only the food you have to wait for.", "author": "Joyce C."}

The Bay area is ripe with oyster farms, so I know it's not for lack of abundance. \n\nOysters are also served with cocktail sauce and freshly grated horseradish - which is puzzling to me because any oyster-lover will know that cocktail sauce completely covers the natural flavors of the oyster and any oyster that needs such a sauce is not worth eating. They can have cocktail sauce upon request, but a mignonette might be a better to serve it with. \n\nThat said, the oysters were fresh though I did get a couple of shells in my oysters and $1 an oyster for HH appears to be a good deal.", "author": "Stina M."}

I also had the clam chowder which is reaaallly good. Not just that goopy stuff down near touristy pier 39, but a tasty flavorful broth that hasn't been simmering and sitting out all day.

They had 3 kinds of oysters to choose from that day- they rotate from day to day. Chesapeakes (Maryland), Miyagis (local), and Pacific Inlets (washington). The miyagis stood out in terms sweetness and flavor. The chesapeake had a buttery texture that reminded me of live scallop but was bland in flavor. We also ordered bread and chowder, which were both made very well.\nWe ate at the bar, and it seemed like the bartender was also the waitress for the sit-down tables.

I'd read that the chef at Mission Street Oyster worked at Anchor for years, so I decided to check it out.\n\nMy party of three arrived at 7pm on a Sunday, and there was no wait.  We started with oysters, which are $2 per oyster all weekend long!  The selection included six varied oysters, including Kumamotos, my personal favorite.  The oysters were expertly shucked - no shell or mangling at all - which is sadly pretty rare, even among places that profess to be oyster specialists. \n\nWe ordered the frutti di mare - clams, mussels, green mussels, fish, prawns, and crab in a white wine garlic sauce.  Each piece of seafood was amazingly fresh, tender, and well-flavored.  The dish was packed with seafood goodness, and our table of three probably could have shared it and gone home happy.  Instead, we also ordered the pasta with prawns in a white wine, tomato, and basil sauce and the cod special.  The cod was flaky and tender with excellent flavor and a nice breading, which was crispy without being crunchy.  The pasta was quite delicious and came with five or six big prawns. \n\nThe ambiance is a little lacking - the restaurant has a cavernous, sterile feel, but you'll be so impressed by the food, you probably won't notice.", "author": "Pearl L."}

Also, the waitress couldn't distinguish between the different pastas we ordered when it came out so we had to switch dishes a few times to get it right. None of us had touched it yet though so it was fine :)", "author": "Elyse R."}

A d our server Maria was charming and very helpful. We had never been so we mixed it up a bit. I got the Sol stuffed with crab and prawns. It was light for a stuffed dish and the flavors were so balanced that I could distinguish each ingredient. We also had the mission fry that had fried oysters, calamari and prawns served with fries all fried perfectly. And the best for last, the few oysters. They had a nice selection so we just picked a few to try at the happy hour price that I think 2.00 each. It came with your simple red cocktail sauce and horseradish but, there was a small light vinigar/wine drizzle which ended up being the only thing we used. The oysters were so perfect they didn't need the sauce or even the lemon.", "author": "Carl C."}

It was so good the first time that I had to go back again before we left SF. Their oysters were super fresh and absolutely delicious. I'd say, being a big fan of oysters, this was just like the more popular joints like Hog Island or Anchor Oyster Bar which was so refreshing that we didnt have to wait long for our food. \n\nWe ordered the crab with cocktail sauce for appetizer as well. This was very good, a nice change from a traditional shrimp cocktail. The crab meat was sweet and fresh. We really liked this a lot. \n\nFor our main course we ordered the seafood stew called the Frutti di Mare. This was AWESOME!! BY FAR, one of the best seafood stews I've ever had. That plus their garlic bread was a winning combination. Think vongole, minus the pasta, plus a whole lot of flavors and seafood. This isn't your plain butter/ white wine sauce....it was loaded with other ingredients that gave the dish a lot more complex flavors and added deliciousness. I really love it and would go back for more in a heartbeat. \n\nYou can't leave without having the Bomba for dessert as well. Its a mix of two sorbets (I believe a passionfruit and raspberry??) in a white chocolate shell. It truly is the BOMB! Had it both times :-)\n\nService was also really good. Our server Mel was very friendly and helpful and never screwed up. I'm not sure why people would complain about the service. This place isn't claiming to be a five star joint, relax about your expectations. Still, I think over all the service was perfect, I had no complaints for both occassions and there were a few other tables besides us as well. \n\nI will definitely be back the next time i'm in the city!", "author": "Bianca E."}

I'm not one to refuse free oysters, so we decided to give it a try, and we were glad we did! We had:\n\nOysters (free): Big and fresh, bf was hoping they would be served live but he was happy enough with recently deceased.\nClam chowder: Delicious, not too full of potatoes, although I think  it could be improved by the addition of bacon! \nOyster crackers: My clam chowder came with oyster crackers! I looked down the bar and there was a huge bowl overflowing with packets of oyster crackers. I have never had my clam chowder served with oyster crackers since I moved to SF! Maybe I've been going to the wrong places? After listening to me flipping my lid with excitement for a few minutes, the amused bartender brought me extra oyster crackers. I stuffed them in my bag and took them home. Awww yeah!\nCalamari: I'm not sure what they put in this stuff, I'm guessing crack? It had a flavor that was spicy without being hot. I couldn't stop eating it! I'm afraid this place has ruined every other restaurant's calamari for me.\nCrab cocktail: My dear bf hogged this but I managed to sneak a taste, and it was super fresh and delicious.\nGarlic bread (also free): I was all set to ignore the plate full of free garlic bread, because I don't like garlic, but I ended up eating a ton of it. It was very cheesy, more like a white pizza with garlic I guess?\n\nInsert typical disclaimer that I don't write yelp reviews except for that one place which blah blah blah.

We had oysters on the happy hour special. Every bit as good as Zuni at a fraction of the cost. The crab cakes were genuinely the best I've ever had. And I've had a lot. Pretty much everything was great. Don't be fooled by he humble decor. You might think its a dive (they should reconsider the logo but that's just me). Anyhow I promise you won't be disappointed. And if I sound a bit biased maybe I am a tad. I really want these guys to make it. Service was also wonderful. Freddy, the owner, really took care of us. And we walked in with sweats on. Ok so Mission folks head on over", "author": "Janet K."}

Travelers should be warned that this is a very sketchy neighborhood.  I would definitely have gone there had I known to take a cab.  I was in a rental car with my wife and in a bad neighborhood that is unfamiliar to me and realized we would be leaving after dark and having to walk several blocks back to the car.  I wish I would have known and I would have just taken a cab and probably, by all accounts, loved the place.", "author": "Steve R."}

I wanted to go to my usual oyster bar but it was closed at the time so I found this place and decided to give it a  try.  Must've been good timing because they had just opened for lunch so we were the only customers.  The owner (I believe) was very friendly and nice and took his time answering our questions about the different oysters and gave some amazing recommendations.  We ordered the Mission Fried Special, garlic bread, Spicy Marinara Pasta, clam chowder, and ofcourse OYSTERS (lotsss of em).  Everything was amazeballs!!  The clam chowder was better than that one \"famous\" brand at Fisherman's Wharf but the oysters!!! were just mouth watering-ly fresh and good!  I don't remember all the names of them because we had about 10 different types that were mostly recommended by the owner or that he would just surprise us with.  The best part of it was the quality didn't match the price.  We had about 6.5 dozen oysters (all different price points) and all that other food but our bill was no more than $200 (including a pretty decent tip).  Definitely looking forward to eating here again on my next visit!", "author": "Ann P."}
