Man, side note, just the address got me all screwed up. Their adjacent parking lot is tiny but at least there is one. For the event, there was no parking lot attendant. So, I'm sorry I can't tell you if there is one regularly. It looked like there was some street parking but not much.  This restaurant is on a pretty busy street. The entrance to the restaurant isn't anything grand but their food sure was tasty.  The service was OK but I can't say it was the best. After all, there were more than 200+ people that they were waiting on for this reception, not including their general restaurant guests.  Because we were there for the wedding reception, the general public that came in were kept to one side of the restaurant so as not to disturb the wedding events. Once the servers kinda got into the swing of things, getting what we needed was much easier. I'd easily come her again considering everything that we had was really tasty.  We had dishes like jellyfish, bbq pork, pork belly, a whole steamed fish, honey walnut shrimp, etc.  I can't say that we had anything exotic but I'm glad that each of the dishes we had were all very nicely prepared and tasty. Again, because we were here for a wedding reception I can't comment on pricing or anything like that. Sorry I can't be of more help. Another side note, the restrooms were clean. We didn't have to send any dishes, tea cups or utensils back to be re-washed. All the linens were clean and nicely pressed. Nice.", "author": "Chris C."}

We've always passed by this place over the years, but never actually eaten here. The place was always packed with diners so I assumed the food must be good. We were strollin' around San Bruno Ave. so we decided it was time to give this place a try. It was also one of the few times I didn't check the app for ratings assuming lots of diners equals good food. \n\nIt was around noon time as we walked in the door as I approached the host/hostess stand, which was empty. I noticed a couple off to my side with a baby stroller were sitting down (Caucasian male and Asian female) who were obviously waiting with a strained look on their faces. I turned around and there was a lady by the counter and it took a while before we could communicate to reserve a table. I finally got to speak with her and told her table for two as she wrote down her name. \n\nWifey sat down as I stood by the door and began to browse on my phone. There were a lot of people who came in after us and it appears they were getting seated first. I assumed they already had reservations so we just waited patiently. But the couple, especially the male, would get up and check with the host/hostess stand on every occasion as the minutes continued ticking and the same pattern occurred of people (all Asians) continued to get seated before us. Maybe they were all regulars who happened to have reservations, I thought again. Wifey also checked with lady who took our name to check the wait time and saw that there were only a few names listed on the sheet and wondered if there was a secret reservations process. \n\nThe process repeated itself as people who came in after us (all Asians) would approach them and get seated right away. The male waiting before us also approached the host/hostess again and wondered the same as his voice began to get elevated and he was obviously perturbed at this point. We made quick eye contact with each other and were probably thinking the same thing without saying a word and understanding each other telepathically. \n\nWifey said, \"Let's go\" and I agreed as we both extricated ourselves from the situation. \n\nAdios...\nVamonos....\nZaijian....", "author": "John G."}

They were offering dimsum, so I was intrigued. What i didnt know was that they were expecting us to do the whole dimsum experience, with the carts and everything... when there was barely any carts roaming around. When i explained that we were in a rush, they tried to be accommodating by giving us a menu to order from.  \nAside from that fact, they were pretty rude and hovered around us while we ordered, and rushed us even more, since we could not do that whole dimsum/yumcha experience. \n\nThe dimsum we got was okay. We got the the har gow, the dried shrimp rolls, and their specialty soup dumplings. The only thing that stood out to me was their soup dumplings that they have in a wooden platter. It looks pretty cool. It was about 20 dumplings, each in their own separate spoon, and a sliced carrot on the bottom. It was really good, the soup was still hot and the pork dumpling was juicy. Presentation was nice considering what it was.\n\nThe neighborhood is too small and cramped for a restaurant this size. It's built horizontally instead of up, so the efficiency of space is completely lacking. Parking lot is also small and doesnt equate to at least half of the number of people that could be seated in this restaurant.\n\nOne star because of their rude interactions with us, and the food was below average. I added a star because of their soup dumplings, and because they tried to accommodate us in the best way possible, and they rush ordered our food for us.", "author": "Vivian H."}

I came here for a huge group event (my mom's birthday), at which we booked over 10 tables and enjoyed many classic dishes of a Cantonese seafood banquet. Overall, the dishes were pretty average in terms of execution, freshness, and flavor.\n\nWe started with the cold appetizer plate of cold cut beef, barbecue pork, seaweed, and jellyfish, before moving on to the seafood soup. The cornstarch laden soup was lacking in flavor and texture, but more good stuff came soon after! The walnut prawns were nice and crispy--not overloaded on the mayo, and the Mongolian beef with king trumpet mushrooms was so tender. My overall favorite dish was probably the ginger stir-fried lobster, which came with huge chunks of delicious meat! Another favorite of mine was the steamed whole fish--you could really taste the freshness of the extremely tender flesh, soaked in a light soy sauce. We also had a stir-fried luffa vegetable dish, which was a bit greasy, and the chilled chicken and scallop fried rice to finish off the meal.\n\nI've been to my fair share of seafood banquets (especially as a kid), and while the food at Imperial Garden wasn't close to the best of what I've had, the restaurant provided an overall enjoyable experience! However, the atmosphere and service don't earn much praise--the restaurant had a somewhat unclean feel to it, and several servers ignored our requests for water.", "author": "David K."}

He speaks no Chinese, and I speak some limited Mandarin. We were seated towards the back of the banquet hall.\n\nI didn't notice how terrible our service was until my friend pointed out that we had been waiting for 40 minutes, and our two Chinese dishes still hadn't come out yet. We looked around us, and it was obvious that other parties, some who came in later than us, were getting their dishes a lot earlier than we were. Our first dish came after an hour of waiting, and our second dish came 10 minutes afterwards.\n\nThe dishes were pretty bad, especially for the wait time. We ordered some beef chow fun (wide Chinese noodles with beef) and peppered beef. The peppered beef was not worth the $15, and the chow fun noodles were bland. (There was not much beef in the noodles either.)\n\nOverall, I'm most irritated by the fact that they were not actively serving us, and kept their attention on other people in the banquet hall. One of the waiters and the manager were hanging around one of the other tables, telling jokes and getting all chummy with them. (The waiter had his arm around one of the customers there.) Basically, if we were Cantonese speaking people who ordered more food for ourselves, the night could have gone a lot better. I had to hunt down one of the waiters to get our check, and I left with a message of how terrible their service was, giving no tip.\n\nAlso, while serving dishes to customers, the manager stuck his pinkie super deep into his nose digging for gold.

The dim sum was okay, the wrappings were not the best, as they broke easily. The steamed custard buns were overcooked and were a little too hard. The food did not very stand out on my opinion, it was more of the Chinatown quality. For better dim sum, I would suggest the restaurants in the Sunset or Richmond. The service here was no good, no refill for tea and the bus boy walked past a few times, but did not clear the empty dishes. The plus about this restaurant is that they have parking, which is rare piece of real estate in San Francisco.

I'm writing my review now because with the weddings I was involved in after mine, I have discovered no one else to have this issue with their restaurants for their weddings. \n\nWe discussed the wedding details and had an agreement. He said I could pay however I wanted, credit, check, cash etc. I let him know I wanted to pay credit. He asked me to pay half with credit and half with cash to save him on transaction fees. I wanted to use my card to get rebates. Was he going to give me a discount if I paid cash. No, he smiled. \n\nAnyway, night of the wedding, he comes to ask for payment and refused to take credit as was agreed, so we offered a check. He refused the check and demanded cash. How the hell do you expect anyone to carry 15k+ in cash?! I'm not the mafia. \n\nSo with a shit load of stress my family and I did not need, we had to send someone to make runs to gather cash (and of course they sent one of the servers to come along. Why? I'm not even sure seeing as how most of us were still there)\n\nLong story short, horrible experience, wouldn't do any major events here as they do not keep their word and that's just dishonest. Made promises they didn't keep. \n\nOccasionally I'll still eat dim sum here because if they refuse my card at least I'll have cash for that or can get it from the atm. \n\nThe food and service were okay, nothing that stood out but honesty is important in business.

We then took a walk back to all the live seafood in all of the tanks at the back of the restaurant-- and my stomach started churning. Most of the fish were stacked,and packed tightly in each tank-- even the Dungeness Crab (the biggest ones I've ever seen in my life) had no room to move in their tank.

My friend on the other hand, was eyeing all the tanks, each fish and crab one by one, like a hungry tiger, salivating over it's prey, it's about to feast on. It's crazy, I think he was actually drooling when his eyes made contact with the Dungeness Crab... \n\nHow could I not enjoy someone getting so much pleasure out of this place?

The place is ALWAYS packed full, but they manage to seat us right away and we're easily in and out in 30 minutes or less.\n\nMy first visit we were starving and chose about 6 dim sum dishes - we were shocked to see a bill of $37!!! For dim sum?!?! Apparently one of the pork dishes we got was $14.99. I'm still not convinced that we weren't just ripped off b/c we're not asian. The dish was not even served hot.\n\nNone the less, we went back again and were careful of what we ordered. The sui mai is good and flavorful, the scallop 'roll' is really more like shrimp. Everything is about average quality, but having lived in the Richmond for many years, I know there is a LOT better dim sum out there. Second time around bill was more reasonable, but we were disappointed to see we were charged $2 for our tea. Really?!", "author": "Rachel G."}

Then they were barely acknowledging my friend and I since we were the only 2 people there who were not Asian, talking shit as they left the table when we declined a dish like chicken feet. The thing that was extremely unbelievable was they charged us $2.80 for 2 waters, mind you it was not like sparkling water it was tap water!!! Then when we asked why we were charged for wTer she couldn't give us a reason! Like it just felt as though they didn't want to bother with us! It was my best friends first time to dim sum and I had never been to this place mistakingly not looking at the reviews but that jug made her experience that much worse!

Knowing how Chinese restaurants will keep those signs up until they fall down on their own, we walked in with an open mind. The restaurant front looked like it had been recently remodeled and there were numerous congratulatory plants just inside the entrance that didn't appear to be super dusty. \n\nThere were a few people waiting so we dutifully got a number and waited to be called. We were told to expect about a 10 minute wait and they were spot on. We were seated at a table against the front window and our tea order taken. Because the table was being set-up when we arrived, they had to bring us plates, napkins and chopsticks. \n\nAs the food runners went by, we selected several dishes. Being hungry, we were on the fourth dish before I realized that our tea had not yet arrived. Flagging down an employee in a suit, he apologized and brought the tea immediately and filled our cups before leaving the pot.\n\nThe selection of dim sum was reasonably decent however we were disappointed that some of the \"standard\" dishes were not presented before we were done eating. We never saw chicken feet, ha gow, or stuffed bell peppers. What we did have was:\n\nRoast Suckling Pig (4) - perfect crispy skin, lean meat, flavorful\n\nSeaweed Salad/Jellyfish (1) - the jellyfish had what i thought was an odd flavor. enough so that it also ruined the seaweed salad for me. my dining companion thought that it was just different from what i was used to and finished the dish so i didn't send it back.\n\nScallop & Shrimp Gow (1) - it was sold as scallop gow. the wrapper was very thick and the scallop had been chopped up and mixed with shrimp. \n\nLotus Leaf Rice (4) - very flavorful; had all the right ingredients\n\nHom Sui Gok (4) - good flavor; decent filling\n\nPork Sui Mai (4) - nice and fat\n\nThe last four dishes were served piping hot. The server even warned us to be careful of the Hom Sui Gok as it had just come out of the fryer.\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to visit this restaurant again but if I were in the area, I wouldn't hesistate to go again either.", "author": "Dexter D."}

Things have changed after all those years closed, mostly the food and prices. Coming here on a weekend is a bad idea if you've ever read Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential.

The noodle are split in the middle as you can see in the various pictures on this page and the goodies are inside. I'm not a big fan of this dish because I don't like the fried noodles on the top and side to begin with, but my dad is crazy for this dish because of the presentation is unique. I was always a fan of the saucy noodles in the bottom. Give me a plate of that and I'll be a happy yelper.\n\nEverything else is pretty standard.

And so the tale of the ridiculous restaurant begins. \n\nHuge ripoff. So much for helping out the neighborhood businesses. \n\nI came on a semi-windy night with my family. There were only a few other groups eating there -- I'd say no more than 5. We were a group of six. The waiter starts chatting up my mother and aunt, and recommended a fish since, hey, we're in a sort of fishy mood. (It should have been a clear indicator at this point that something FISHY was about to occur at the end of the meal.)\n\nBefore I launch into full restaurant bashing mode, I will preface my bashing with some background. Our family is Chinese, we've been to a ton of Chinese restaurants all over the city. Usually, when we ask a waiter to recommend a fish, we take the recommendation -- with the norm being that the fish is approximately between $40 to $60 dollars. We don't look at the menu to confirm price because hey, that's THE NORM. \n\nSo our food comes, and it seems that fish is the motif for 3 out of 5 dishes we have. There's fish soup, fish with vegetables, and fried fish coated with sauce. Okay, so it seems like the fish was big enough to make three large dishes out of. No biggie. The fried stuff was a little salty, and all the dishes were pretty greasy. \n\nYet.\n\nThe bill comes, and the FISH alone is $149. Our TOTAL bill was about $180. \n\nFor six people. (FYI, we're six women, not huge guys who eat a TON.) At some mediocre Chinese restaurant. \n\nGee, thanks for telling us the fish you recommended we order was MORE THAN HALF THE BILL. Who the freak recommends a $149 fish for a party of six? Okay, so we didn't look at the menu to check, BUT, they do NOT do this at other Chinese restaurants. \n\nTotally dishonest pricks who will never receive our business again.", "author": "Betty T."}

It seems, as a decorator or landscaper might say, to have no theme.  But there are plenty of Chinese and Mexican restaurants on San Bruno, and the Imperial Garden seems to stand out.  \n\nThree of us showed up for dinner around 5:30 pm on Sunday.  The waiter was friendly and helpful.  The menus had pictures of everything.  Everything!  This made large plastic menus, but we were able to browse the food without wondering what it was.  Many delicious looking items had descriptions that took me aback:  pig stomach, alligator belly bone in, braised sea cucumber, whole pig, whole goat, whole rabbit, roasted or fried squab, etc.  I'm sure it's great eating for a Chinese connoisseur, but for our first visit I wanted to stick with things I knew so I could get a baseline impression.  \n\nThe prices looked a little high, until we saw the size of the dishes.  It would have been perfectly satisfying to stick to one dish per person, but we succumbed to temptation and ordered 4 dishes for 3 people.  \n\nThe won ton soup was not nearly as salty as the soups we've had at other restaurants, and that is a good thing.  The chicken broth in it was excellent.  \n\nThe broccoli beef was a little fatty, but they compensated for that by steaming the broccoli instead of soaking it in the beef fat.  Another plus.  \n\nWe also had a mixed seafood plate, with shrimp the size of my fingers and scallops all over the plate, and the tastiest peas I've had in years.  \n\nWe bound all of this together with shrimp fried rice, which had more of the large shrimp, and also a lot of squid tube slices, along with the usual egg and diced pork.  \n\nWe all agreed to stick with the black tea for our beverage, as tea has the amazing property of cutting fat.  Fortunately, there was not a great need for this property in this meal.  \n\nThe three of us ate more than we should have, with more food left over when we were too stuffed to eat any more, for about $60 + tip.  The scales tell me I gained 4 pounds yesterday.  \n\nThis restaurant is huge.  The dining room goes on forever, with 8-tops and lazy susans stretching to infinity.  It was a little odd to see an open garbage can in the dining room near the back, and a small open office near the front.  I've seen the office in other Chinese restaurant layouts before, though.  The room was spacious, a high ceiling that had a neon-lit dome in the center, and a giant phoenix and dragon mural along one wall.  There were other dining rooms off the main room, as well as, it appears, upstairs.  The men's room was clean, and it had flowers on the wash basin counter.  \n\nAnother plus:  by the time we left at 7:30 pm, the room was full.  Almost everyone there was Chinese.  That's a good testimonial.", "author": "David D."}

In talking to one of their managers, we learned that ownership has changed, and they changed the chef for dim sum very recently.

These were the beef trip, the steamed rice noodle (shrimp), the lotus leaf wrapped sticky rice, and the Shanghai dumpling. Very meh.\n\nThe restaurant is generally clean, but the do need to do something about those fugly cardboard leading to the bathroom, and inside the bathroom. In talking to the restaurant manager (today), I referenced Yelp and their bad reviews. I spoke specifically about the cardboard, and that bathroom needs to be cleaner. He talked about the carpet, then said that they have not generated enough revenue to change things like the old carpet. It's a bad situation - they have a bad reputation, but their food has improved from those reviews (dim sum only - dunno about dinner).\n\nOn a Sunday around noon, this place was fairly full.

But whereas the dining rooms are clean enough, their restrooms and kitchen areas remain filthy. Too bad because I appreciate several of their uncommon menu choices one can only find in restaurants willing to cater to diners seeking cultural authenticity as I do.\n\nUnfortunately, most other Chinese restaurants in this city barely go beyond an 80 health code rating either.

Im an ABC too, and I understand that one doesn't typically go to a Chinese restaurant of low caliber and expect good service. With that said, we would've been better off serving ourselves... It ruined the whole meal. If your waiter is an asian man with receding haired mid aged man, request another waiter.", "author": "Gina T."}

I don't know how \"new\" it actually is, but currently it getting packed even on a weekday afternoon for lunch, something that wasn't happening before.  I notice they did some remodeling by putting in a new dining area, and word from a coworker is that they hired a new chef.  Other than that, I see the same people who appears to be the owners as before, but I do see someone new who I think is the owner of Riverside Seafood on Vicente Street.  Maybe this is a new partnership.\n\nAnyway, at least the dim sum seems good.  My coworker and I enjoyed the chicken feet in black bean sauce more than before, and a different coworker said she enjoyed the dinner and her husband like the dim sum better than before also.  The menu has also changed from before, both the dim sum lunch and the dinner menu.\n\nFor that, I'll give them the benefit of a four-star review.  Hopefully the current management can keep the customers coming this time around unlike the previous setup.", "author": "H K."}

Thank goodness nothing was stolen! AND i accidently left my phone in the car too! They have a guy watching the parking lot though.. maybe that stopped anyone from sneaking around the lot.\n\nIt's sad.. but, although i'm asian.. it doesn't mean I can fluently speak it :( I only recognize the words for \"fork\", \"tea\", and some miscellaneous dim sum dishes. All the employees at Imperial still assumed I spoke Chinese even though I was answering in English with a confused look on my face. I guess I need to pick up a copy of Rosetta Stone: Cantonese 1.\n\nThe dim sum was so/so. I've had fresher tasting dim sum before - especially since we're in SF and there are so many GREAT dim sum places! The black bean spare ribs were a bit odd, the egg tarts were so flakey it fell into pieces the moment I picked it up, and the char siu was a little different tasting than I'm used to.  On the bright side, the restaurant wasn't crowded and our group of 4 was seated promptly! I probably won't go here again but it wasn't bad or anything.", "author": "Samantha L."}

It also wasn't great, but nothing to send you to the restroom. The restaurant however was DIRTY.  Dirty as in the entire interior really needs to be gutter and remodeled. \n\nThe carpet is literally threadbare and was dirty enough that your feet stick to the floor in places.  The cloth table cover and clearly not been replaced from the previous customers who sat at our table as dried food was stuck to it where I sat.  The glass of the lazy Susan had been wiped with a very dirty cloth and the wipe marks had dried, leaving a trail of where previous grease had been evenly smeared about.  For inexplicable reasons, the walkway into the restrooms was lined with cardboard boxes that had been opened flat and used in place of carpets.  As if that weren't odd enough, signs had been posted on the walls in Chinese warning you to be safe and not trip while walking.  Perhaps they meant to not trip on the cardboard boxes they had put down on the ground?\n\nThe food was fine and the service was decent.

My dad and I came here for lunch at noon on a Friday and there were only about four tables filled. Parking was difficult to find and we ended up parking at a space with a 30 minute time limit so my dad had to keep going back to put more coins in. \n\nWe ordered off of the dim sum menu instead of waiting for the ladies to come out with trays of food (which they rarely did btw). Because we had no visuals, we ended up ordering way too much food. We ordered six dishes which I will try my best to name in English:\n\nSweet Tofu Soup: I asked for no sugar on this since I had Splenda in my bag. Haha. It was great but this isn't the type of things anyone could really mess up on. Its like soft silken tofu and water. The lady kept insisting to give me sugar and asked if I would like it on the side. \n\nStuffed Mushrooms: I'm always paranoid they're going to be stuffed with meat but it was just fish cake. The sauce they poured on top of it was disgusting. Not only was it thick and goopy, it was virtually tasteless as well. It was like someone sneezed all over them. I ended up wiping off all the sauce on those paper placemats and it wasn't until afterwards I realized how unsanitary that was since they don't change them often. Yuck. \n\nMai Lai Cake (Steamed Sponge Cake): This is my dads favorite thing to order at dim sum places and it quickly became my favorite. Their portion was really small though but it was pretty good. Some parts were kind of oily though which was pretty off putting. \n\nShrimp Dumplings: These were brought to us last and I was already stuffed to the gills. We didn't want to bring anything home so I struggled to eat three of them while my dad ate the forth one. The first one I tried to pick up completely fell apart. The skins are really chewy on these. \n\nMy dad also ordered Steamed Chicken Feet which I went no where near and some porridge. \n\nIt was $23 total which I thought was pretty reasonable but my dad kept saying how expensive it was and how he'll never be back. He said it used to be cheaper. \n\nHere's a funny story. Once when I went here as a child, I found a penny on the bottom of my water glass as I went to take a sip.

My family and I have always received great service, but today was different. The odd thing that changed was the food carts being pushed around. I haven't been here for years and so when I walked in, it was weird to see them walk around with trays. There were a few servers who just came to our table several times with the same food items. It got annoying after a while since I was waiting for other items to be presented. I did ask this one server for chicken feet and he got it for me, but that twas about it. It just seemed like I had to speak Chinese to get the items I wanted because most of the servers didn't understand the food item in English, even though it was listed on their menu. There menu did have pictures, but I felt it was too scattered and that it needs to be helpful for the customer and server. After 15 minutes, my husband and I got tired of waiting for water and other food items to come around so we left. We enjoy dim sum and usually have at least 6 dishes on our table, but today was a disappointment because we only ordered 3. The total came out to be $15.50 and I didn't think it was worth it at all.

Because it was their grand opening since new management, the place was jam packed with people. Understandably they wanted to seat us upstairs in their second floor loft. However, they had a dozen large bags of dining linen blockading the bottom of the stairs and we had to climb over them just to get to the top. This is a serious fire hazard especially to my grandpa who needs a cane to get around. The upstairs loft that we sat in was basically a storage room for their employees that they decided to open up last minute to shuffle in business quickly. The corner that I sat in had a row of large metal lockers with dirty towels poking through their shutters, much like those rusty ones in high school hallways. The carpet beneath us had so many dark stains that anything is imaginable. I literally only took one bite and immediately felt sick and wanted to haul my ass out of their. We requested to speak to their manager but the waiters told us repeatedly that he was \"busy\".

I'm not going to lie, the food does taste better than before with the old manager. \n\nEvery time I come here, the service seems to be different, even though it's crowded and there's a lot of people. Today when I first sat down, tons of servers were asking us if we wanted food. But soon, after 10 minutes, this lady stopped asking us. I said \"excuse me\" because she was carrying something I wanted and she didn't even bother to turn around or stop at my table. Talk about being rude. I'm sorry lady, I didn't like what you were carrying before but I like the item now. Kill me if I don't order everything. \n\nThe line for the bathroom was long (typical...for every restaurant) so I was just patiently waiting with all the other people... until the lady who usually serves you to your table came in. She loudly announced that she came into the bathroom 3 times already and there's still a long line. So she decided to cut everyone just so she can go first. Hello, some of us are waiting to go to. I expected better from someone who works here. You would normally always want to satisfy your customers first, right?\n\nThe food service here is alright. The food is constantly serving but it's not Dim Sum. It's always bread or some cold cut food that doesn't take time to prepare since it's pre-made. If you want to eat a variety of dim sum, you really do have to order it on the paper. I also ordered the Grilled Leak and they gave us the wrong order. It was definitely not the same as the picture shown. The picture also shows 5 pieces but we only got 4. That's definitely a rip from a \"special\" food item. \n\nOverall, my first few times here (when they first opened with the new manager) were better than my last few times. Maybe they're just getting tired of all the people everyday...", "author": "Jackie L."}

This is a review that's long overdue: we came here on Mother's Day for dinner because my parents live close by. Figure it's convenient. Now I wish we had of taken the time and gone else where. We called and made reservations. Got seated and was served the menu. They inflated the prices on everything! I realize it's Mother's Day and most places would charge more but it's ridiculous what they did. The had set menus for you to choose. Prices were tripled and some were quadrupled compared to their usual menu. The food was not good. Service was terrible. We paid $175 for a crappy meal which would have cost no more than $60 on a regular night. Waiter told us they will serve us the free desert after the dinner. We paid our bill and tipped them (which we should not have but given it's a holiday, we did). We sat there for 15 minutes after they took the bill, money and tip and no one came back. No one came back with the dessert. Finally we just left.  A friend of mine told me he found a slug in his food once...I should listened to him and stay away from this place. It's amazing this place is still open. I think the only reason why it's still open is because there is a large Chinese community around the area and they just go there because it's convenient.

Ordered shrimp fried rice, sweet and sour pork, kung pao chicken, combination chow mein, and an order of pot stickers. We were told that our order would be ready to pick up in 20 minutes. We arrived at the restaurant after the 20 minute mark, were promptly greeted, but did not get our food until well over the 40 minute mark. We waited over 20 extra minutes in the restaurant waiting for our food which was time we could have spent ordering inside of the restaurant and starting on our food. I was extremely dissatisfied with their phone ordering system and do not recommend it. Upon opening our orders we found that our combination chow mein had NO MEAT and was so so! I was even more dissatisfied with the restaurant as a whole. The shrimp fried rice was bland and mediocre. The sweet and sour pork, kung pao chicken, and dumplings were pretty good. Overall, I wouldn't return seeing as they took such a long time, got one order wrong, food was mediocre, and the bill came out to over $60. Next place please.", "author": "Briana G."}

Very inexpensive and very good!  The usual dumplings, plus some other dishes I had not seen.  Heavy on the shrimp, some pork, did not see any duck or squid, but if we had asked they would have provided.  They brought a delicious steamed brocoli dish out especially for us.\n\nTheir regular menu is kind of pricy.  My husband ordered noodles and egg rolls for takeout once when I was out of town and it was $20!\n\nI am so glad I no longer have to brave the search for a parking spot in the Richmond, or pay Yank Sing prices, to get my dim sum, so I give it the extra star because I can walk there!", "author": "Holly B."}

However, WORST of all was that the lobster lo mein. DO NOT get it. The noodles were wrong, the lobster pieces were sparse and it tasted like it came from one of those cheap Chinese frozen dinners.
