How much better can it get?\n\nAs I walked up the stairs, I was fascinated on how beautiful it was. There were little lights and decorations everywhere. I proceeded to go to the bar to get a drink. My fave alcohol is tequila so I got the La Ponderosa. The drink was good, but then my friend let me try her drink (Fashion Victim) and it was EVEN BETTER. It tasted like juice! Mixed drinks aren't my thing but these Alchemist cocktails are so delicious.\n\nThis bar is definitely chill vibes and more of a socializing bar. Although there was music, people didn't dance. Nonetheless, Alchemist is still a great place to have a chill night and enjoy a yummy cocktail.", "author": "Julian Y."}

If you get a table,  there's table service ( waitress) for you. Thats a plus.  I didn't have to stand at the bar.  They have specialty cocktails to choose from.  They're are at least 3 that i wanted to try containing bourbon or scotch.  I got the bourbon and mezcal beverage. Delicious. Perfect smoke taste.  Accidentally we were given the drink that has tequila in it. Before tasting, we were told that's it was the wrong drink. But we were able to keep it to try it out. I like to try various Cocktails so of course trying it was a plus for me. However I didn't like it so if you like tequila in might be up to your par but not mine. I was at a bit hungry so I went with the deviled eggs that came out in for small parts. I think out of the four parts it probably equals up to one egg. But no biggie. The bites on the menu seemed like some great options.. enough options to come back and try.\nYou know what I enjoyed a lot? The music. The genres of music that they were playing where are so awesome. They even actually played Don't Worry Be Happy. And I don't know about you but that song makes me not worry and be happy. I also noticed that it was an area that kind of set up like in a plateau like Style that seem like you can maybe rent that part out to have a small intimate party but not a party.

There's an empty space in the main living area for either people standing around or a dance floor, some comfy couches to lounge in and a fully-stocked bar in the corner with a dope bartender! Their cocktail menu here is something I haven't seen before with unique blends. \n\nI ordered a guava cocktail which had an actual guava fruit and bitters. It was called, \"Rum is the new bassline\": rum blend, black tea, milk, cinnamon, basil, lime and guava soda. It's exotic and tastes refreshing. It's definitely a cocktail meant for summer evenings. It's crisp and delicious; worth $13! \n\nOverall, this cocktail bar deserves another go around, on a Friday & Saturday night where there's a bigger crowd and a more vibrant feel. We came last night which was empty on a Monday evening. \n\nI'm coming back for more!", "author": "Allister D."}

The acoustics do you the favor of ensuring the wall of pretentious, try-hard, vapid noise keeps you from hearing your companion(s) speak or enjoying the beautiful space in silence when you give up on conversation.\n\nThe place is missing any charm or joi de vivre and entirely takes its self too seriously to leave you anything but slightly jaded. \n\nTo be fair, this likely isn't the owner/management team's fault but due to the venture capitalists the space attracts.

(We work really close to the ballpark).   At the same as time we were on our way to happy hour, so were all the giants fans post game! We walked around and most places were super crowded with tons of already drunk people. We searched yelp for what other options were around and it was the Alchemist to the rescue! \n\nI think because of it's second floor location, and narrow dark hallway as an entrance - it is easy to just pass by and not even notice. The entrance is just a side hallway with some interesting decor - lab stuff, big old vintage book, an old record player. Go up the stairs and you are welcomed by high ceilings, and a refreshing amount of space compared to all the crowded first floor bars that the giants game fans go to. The space has an industrial warehouse vibe, with a twist of steampunk but not at all a steampunk bar. Crowd was calm and just seemed like a lot of after work drinks crowd. It was only a few people at the bar when we entered by two hours later we left and the place was packed. \n\nThere is comfy lounge seating everywhere which makes it good for groups if you can get to the seating first. It has a good cocktail menu, beer selection. Happy hour options aren't anything special but they do have a happy hour. Limited bar bites like fries, tator tots - nothing special.

It was good but none of the ingredients really stood out to me and it took nearly 20 minutes to get it made even though the bar wasn't all that busy. Is it always just me that seems to get the shaft when it comes to ordering a drink! Probably not just seems like it. \nI really like the brick wall that as you walk in where they are showing cartoons from a projector, one a modern day cartoon and another an old shadow puppet like cartoon projection, gotta say that was really cool, had hip-ster written all over this place.

The white gentleman was not friendly and it took us a while to get his attention. He was more concentrated on making drinks for himself, tasting them, then dumping them out. I saw him do this at least 4 times. The lemon drop he made was horrible but he did make a good drink called the fashion victim. We will not be back. Bartenders are suppose to make you feel welcome and he certainly did not.", "author": "Robert W."}

The atmosphere is really cool and it wasn't crowded at all! There is a bar downstairs as well as upstairs. The drinks are really good! I ordered the \"Something with Vodka\" and it was so good! It was also bright pink which I is extra fun with a flower to top it all off. The place has a very relaxed vibe it's exactly how you would picture a lounge. They have both couches for larger parties or tables if you want a more formal setting. It's an easy place to have a conversation while enjoying some good drinks. \n\nThe bar tenders were not the friendliest but we were able to overlook that and just enjoy the atmosphere. This is definitely a trendy place if you are looking for something unique in the city!", "author": "Maddy H."}

We had Rum Is the New Bassline, made with tea, milk, cinnamon and other spices, guava, lime, basil -- it was complex but bright and such an interesting blend of flavors.  The Kalimera was made from yogurt and cucumber, lemon and herbs and I liked it because it was not too sweet and very refreshing.  They had some lovely non-alcoholic drinks as well.\n\nComfortable places to sit and not too crowded although I would have loved to have the music turned down just a little.  This is a great place to go after work with co-workers.\n\nADDITION TO ORIGINAL REVIEW:\nDear Phil C. --\nI just read the very gracious reply you wrote to the review posted by Christina M.  Wanted to tell you that \"soulless\" is a completely inaccurate way to describe your place -- it has a lot of soul and I definitely got a sense of the personality behind the shadow animation, the welcoming seating and the appealing, creative drink menu. In this era of people lashing out at each other on social media, I was charmed by your kind response to a very negative (and in my opinion, unfair) review.  We just moved to SF, were so pleased to find the Alchemist and we will be back.", "author": "Ann S."}

It was a Thursday night so it wasn't too crazy, too loud or too crowded. They got nice comfortable seats and the menu item names made me giggle a little bit. The atmosphere was cool but I wasn't really my thing, although I do know a lot of people that would LOVE it. My review is actually for the staff. Everyone was extremely nice and easy to talk to and I felt comfortable ordering drinks (I have social anxiety). Even the security downstairs was super nice.

There was a nice crowd but still seats to be found.  It was not on a game day so I would imagine it's busier then.  They had some cool old school black and white films projected onto the exposed brick walls that went well with the quirky steampunk decor.  I was definitely a fan of the atmosphere.  They had some music playing but I don't remember what it was, must have been loud enough to drown out the other conversations but not too loud to be overpowering.  Good lightning for the scene.  I saw a few people eating some small snacks like tater tots and hummus but didn't see a food menu.\n\nNow to the drinks.  The beers were reasonably priced for the neighborhood, $6 or $7 each for a bottle or can.  Not a huge selection but what they had was good.  The cocktail list was well balanced and $12 each. I've been on a Frenet kick lately so I asked the bartender to mix me something up that was Frenet forward and he did a great job. Something with scotch, (scared me at first), bitters and another ingredient I can't remember but it was great!  That's the sign of a great bartender.  The happy hour cocktails were overpriced and I saw one of the other bartenders rip the label off the well liquor they used.  Everyone knows the cheap drinks are using well liquor but I found it odd that they ripped the labels off.  I would have given this place five stars otherwise.     \n\n4 beers and one cocktail, $38.  Not too shabby.  I'd go back again.", "author": "Scott M."}

I came here on Friday night around 10pm, there was no cover and no line. The ambiance and vibe of this place is incredible, from the moment you start walking up the staircase, you are greeted with painted walls and antique decor. You can see the amount of time that has been spent on the furnishing of this place. Once you get upstairs, the floor plan really opens up. The venue was surprisingly big, with a lot of different areas for seating, tables as well as big comfy couches and fancy chairs. They were projecting movies on the wall which was pretty cool, and kept me entertained while my friend was getting us drinks. I was also able to snag a couch with no problem. The venue did get more packed as the night went on, but never so much that you felt uncomfortable. It is a perfect venue for a relaxed night out, or a good starter bar before a crazier night out.\n\nThe only reason I deducted a star was for the service, the bartender I was ordering from was not friendly at all. When I asked him for recommendations, he was hesitant and wouldn't even tell me what was more popular between the drinks I inquired about. I understand if the bar was busy and he had a bunch of people waiting, but it was early enough in the night that i was the only person ordering at that time.

I really appreciate the eclectic charm of the furniture and decor as well as the shadow puppet foreign films that they project on the walls especially when paired with the sounds of Postmodern Jukebox. I have however been here when they've been blasting fist-pumping beats which is a disconnect. The offer of run in/run out fireball shots at the entrance on game day definitely compounds the disconnect. With that said, service has typically been pretty good here and we've managed to find seating for even larger groups. You can call ahead and reserve the separate little nook overlooking the bar. I also like that they offer bottles of Erdinger here. \n\nIt's a decent bar in the neighborhood where its second floor location can be a big plus when all the other watering holes around are packed wall to wall.

Not sure why I thought it would have coffee in it. I guess I was too tired to really read the description. My second cocktail was Smoking with the devil. I wanted something light and refreshing.

My gf and I had seen the strawberry basil gimlet pic which looked so pretty and delish. They just made us the strawberry version though.\n\nI played shuffleboard which was super fun.

Which can count as #300 depending on your significant figures.\n\nDoes chemistry occur chez the Alchemist?  I don't know, because all good chemistry pickup lines argon.  \n\nI've wanted to come here for awhile because I've heard it is comparable to Local Edition, though the primary reason is my affinity for all things science-related--theLab, DNA Lounge, and now the Alchemist. \n\nI half-expected a chemistry lab theme, which would be quite swanky with dranks prepared with pipets, mixed in flasks, and served in beakers.  (This was actually one of my musings for what I would do for a living had I not gotten accepted into pharmacy school).  I was therefore ecstatic to be greeted by flasks, microscopes, and other paraphernalia that blur the lines of witchcraft and alchemy.\n\n[THE AMBIENT CONDITIONS]\n\nIf you want to take a picture of the fascinating labware setup in order to look cool on social media (yes I confess being guilty to this practice), there might not be time becuase the bouncer is very efficient and the line moves surprisingly quickly.  He paused on me for awhile though; I guess pharmacy school hasn't made me age too much... yet. \n\nUp the obligatory staircase for the imitation speakeasy experience, the main room wasn't exactly the nerdy chemistry bar of my dreams, but the unique ambiance was primarily warehouse, blended with electric and intellectual elements.  One might describe it as entropy: disorder in perfect natural order.  The overlooking second level is obliquely designed like a haphazard makeshift platform, and the vintage edison bulbs, brick walls, and projections of black-and-white videos only add to the charm.  \n\n[THE WAVELENGTHS]\n\nThe music selection is solid: all the songs on the radio that I don't skip over.  It's a mix of popular/EDM minus annoying girly songs.  Overall the noise is at a good level, loud enough to feel alive but not so loud that you have to scream to hear yourself think.\n\n[THE EtOH]\n\nI half suspect the bartenders to be fans of My Chemical Romance, which would explain the name Alchemist as well the fact that all the cocktail names are so morbid.  Death in a Rose Garden and Smoking with the Devil sound like something straight out of the Black Parade.\n\nI got the B.A. Baracus (scotch, lemon, ginger & habanero syrup, hard cider), and it was crafty enough to be worth the $11.  I especially liked the spicy kick, which went well with the scotch.  It was just the right level of spiciness to give it character without being flamboyantly firey and barely tolerable like the Local Edition Bloody Mary.  Because we were trying to identify what we ordered, I tried a sip of some other cocktails, and all were wonderfully complex.  \n\nI also appreciated how artsy the cocktails looked, with the thin layer of foam up to the rim, simple elegant garnishes, and a large ice cube curiously floating pointy side up (reminiscent of the half-sunk marshmallow in the $7 mocha named Titanic at Hollow).\n\n[THE KINETICS]\n\nOh snaps the shuffleboard.  It's quite entertaining over dranks, with all the spontaneity.   Unlike the cumbersomely strategic game of pool involving vectors, transfer of momentum, etc. etc, the nature of the game is such that there isn't much you can control given the variability from the sand and the sloped surface.  It's something of a crap shoot, essentially an adult version of beer pong.", "author": "Edna C."}

Stirred direct over 2nd story Soma/South Beach views. Garnish with no cover and you have a drink for success.\n\nAll I heard this past weekend on the radio was Hyphy, Trap and Justin Beiber and despite keeping myself busy by eating and drinking my way across the Bay I kind of wanted to get back to my roots, my peoples, a craft cocktail bar. I was a little tiki'd out and the beer up here is not as good as back home. SF is arguably where I got my craft cocktail start back in the day at B&B, Rickhouse and though I usually check out the latest and greatest, my friends suggested something for the whole group.\n\nIt's a connected bar at the bottom of the stairs to a sports bar, neighborhood space with video games, but we wanted to go upstairs where the music was. 90's, 2000's, R&B, Hip Hop. No DJ tonight, but the set up is in the back by the mens room. The dance space is small and right down the middle flanked by the lounging couches and area on the far wall and the bar. A small alcove loft has some more private areas, but it's loud so it forces some intimate proximity just to talk. Brick walls, tall ceilings, very flat/loft esque with wood floors and tables, coat/purse hooks. A dozen seats around he bar are pretty comfortable, but as the bar gets slammed you will feel the crush of 2-3 deep. Bathroom is small, but has large stalls.\n\nJust looking at their bottles on shelf they have everything you'd expect, fresh fruits, citrus, syrups, cordials, orgeat and a variety of rums for tiki (smith & cross, Hamilton, flor de cana), a few dozen whiskies/bourbons as well as amaros. \n\nMy night here, the point station was run by who I think was the manager, obviously knew his way around a bar, but not this station, was a little slow on the recipe's. I could tell Simon at the service station usually ran point based on which hand he grabbed the bitters, well bottles and mixes. I went to him and patiently waited as he served female after female and string ordering sports jacket wearing ex hipster after string ordering sports jacket wearing hipster. A quick chat and a few tips later I had my drinks, some free shots and connect. No Henny, so we went with their Martel XO Cordon Blue, which I warned my friends would cost a pretty penny as it's between VSOP and Paradis. Negroni, 2 cognac & Mexican coke's were $47. I went with a mezcal & green chartreuse with a smith & cross daiquiri back. My next round was a vieux carre, a shot of fernet, then some Rittenhouse. My buddy wanted a surfer on acid which hey couldn't make, so I improvised the recipe using branca menta, plantation rum and pineapple. A hit. They have pebble ice and their cold draft machine is on point. Bar back looks like he's on his 2nd 5 hour energy. They are definitely short about 1 waitress and probably need to rope off the service area. Tip your bartender people, it goes along way.\n\nEven someone like me can find it hard to hit up all your favorite spots, which now have waits and with so many places to try I'm glad I found somewhere I can add to my list for good drinks, good music and a non pretentious vibe.", "author": "Walter M."}

Large, home-y and festive enough (note: maybe they have the x-mas lights up all year?). we found a seat at the bar and were happy to find an abundance of great beers and crafty cocktails. I started with the Steelhead DBL IPA which was hoppy and full of flavor.... Definitely helped kick the night off in the right direction. After some talk and banter about my pumpkin spice experience, the night took a turn for the best.\n\nI found the BasicBitch cocktail.\n\nImagine this: pumpkin spice latte in cocktail form. From what I recall, it was made with whiskey and pumpkin spice liquor with some bitters.  I lost my phone the night before (like a basic bitch should) so I was unable to capture the picture.... Or the menu to take note of its ingredients.... But dear god, this hit the spot. It was warm, it was full of flavor and by the third one I found myself nuzzled up in a corner wearing yoga pants and uggs.\n\nAfter reading reviews and looking at photos, I've come to conclude that this art of a cocktail is seasonal (obvi) so get it while you can. \n\nBasic bitches, UNITE!\nhttps://media1.giphy.com/media/ENMWsXKe9EBAA/200.gif", "author": "Ryan L."}

Please head out.\"   He and his colleagues were not interested in helping us and only wanted to get us out of the bar.  This is the same individual who first greeted us a few minutes earlier with \"You have 30 seconds to chug that, and get out of the door, we're closing.\"  \n\nWhen the owner learned of the incident, he reached out to help.  Together, we were able to determine that another large group that night had left with all of our coats (thinking they were left by their friends).

Upstairs, the bar was surprisingly empty (it was around 5:45), and we found an empty corner with very comfortable leather couches. The decor of the bar is really industrial with exposed bricks, raw wood, and dark leathers.  It felt like the ultimate bachelor pad or something.

I came here on a typical Friday night with some friends after Off the Grid to see if this place really matches with all the fantastic reviews.\n\nCocktail menu is nice and short with a good variety of unheard of creations. Pretty standard prices. The drinks are nicely crafted, but not out of this world. I had a Campfire Fizz, a fascinating blend of  mezcal, cherry herring, lemon, simple syrup, egg and IPA. You often see beer in cocktails, but not IPAs. However, it turned out giving the drink a nice bitter taste. I tried several others that my friends ordered and they were also decent, but nothing to rave about.\n\nThere's ample room to move around, so don't worry about being squished here. Some areas do get cramped but there's a large space by the windows and upstairs if you want to keep to your bubble. Not too much room to sit down with your friends. Big thumbs up for the shuffleboard table, though! \n\nOne thing that bothers me about this place is it seems to have an identity crisis. The bartenders are quite slow and like to take their time chatting up with the customers when there's people waiting for drinks. It tries to come off as an underground prohibition-style bar, but it's just not working with the quality of drinks and decor. It's decorated as more of an art studio than a bar with its wide open spaces. \n\nGood drinks, awesome shuffleboard table, but the overall concept needs some work.", "author": "Dmitriy S."}

Hmm. \n\nWhen I first got there, there weren't too many people there and we were able to get a seat at the bar. After we got our drinks, more people showed up and it seemed like some of them had to wait awhile to get their drinks ordered.

Previously, 3rd Degree Lounge (http://www.yelp.com/biz/3rd-degree-lounge-san-francisco), Alchemist is just another speakeasy type bar above Roots restaurant serving artisanal cocktails ($11). They have nonalcoholic drinks ($6) available as well. My friend tried one of their too sweet cocktails (Something with Vokkah) so I stuck with shots the entire night. \n\nHappy hour is 4 pm - 8 pm with $5 bubbly, $2 off wine and $1 off bottled beer.\n\nWhile the concept is similar to Local Edition, Alchemist is absolutely NO Local Edition nor any members of the Bourbon & Branch family as some people have made comparisons to (it's about 1/3 the size with a meh crowd).

Something beyond their control but I don't want to have to drink till he or she is cute.\n*No music (at least I couldn't hear any); just an extremely loud box of chatter.\n*Bartenders were snotty and seemed like they were doing us a favor when ordering.\n*Limited alcohol selection.\n*Just ordering a drink here takes a while and getting an artisanal cocktail even longer so come with a lot of patience.\n*Bar stools (and people sitting in them) BLOCKED the entire bar area making a drink even harder and longer to get in hand. Every bar/lounge I've been to clear the stools after 10 pm so why can't Alchemist do the same?\n*Limited seating area.\n\nPro Tip: IF you're a beer drinker or shots person, you're better off rolling in a keg or refilling your flask from the nearby liquor store.

I wasn't too sure if this was for happy hour or Valentine's day since we were each given a ticket for it. \n\nThe bar itself is upstairs in a cozy, dimly lit space with a bunch of couches and smelled of popcorn. I was confused until I saw their mini popcorn machine and large can of caramel and cheese popcorn. That was pretty cool and it was free! They also play black and white movies on the wall. We didn't want to spoil our appetite so we just headed over to the bar. It took the bartenders a while to acknowledge us, which was a little annoying. When they finally did, I ordered the Death in a Rose Garden cocktail ($11). The price seemed kind of steep especially since it came in a small gimlet, but it was strong!

Everyone was trying to socialize but had to yell. If you look at the person you are trying to listen to, enjoy the droplets of spit in your eye. \n My friends assured me that we were meeting them at a cool lounge, not a dance club. They know I hate those places.\n Loud as hell and hot as balls should be the name of this place. Never going back. Plenty of good bars in the city that don't play shitty music at the highest setting. Kind of sad because the place looks really cool. Can't really describe the look other than to say it would have made sense to hear Sisters of Mercy, DM or NIN being played. Not blared mind you, just played at a normal bar volume.\n \nUPDATE: MARCH 3 2015 Phil C from Alchemist messaged me and was quite apologetic about my experience.\nHe assured me that blaring music is not something that is supposed to happen there nor is 70 music normally played. Because the music being so loud was my only issue with the business I am adding two more stars and trusting that one could have conversations there after the issue was resolved.  Its a very stylish and properly lighted space (not too bright)  with good drinks. Therefore, I will return this weekend and give it another try. If I can talk to people without the need to yell, the four stars will remain intact.\n Thanks Phil. \n Steve.", "author": "Steve M."}

Luckily, when you have friends that live in the city, it makes being in the \"know,\" a whole lot easier. This particular night, we were in the SoMa watching the Giants play. The game ends as expected, and thus we are left with the rest of the night to drink. Public House and all those spots are okay, but I really wanted to try out some new spots in the area. The Alchemist, was definitely new, and boy do I like this spot. If you're coming from AT&T, it literally is about a 5 minute walk. There really isn't a dress code here considering the fact that it's so close to the ballpark, but people still do dress nicer than your average pub.\n\nAlchemist is a 2nd story bar right on 3rd street. If you're just walking up 3rd Street, you might actually miss it because there aren't any huge signs telling you to come in for a drink. Once you walk upstairs, you're transformed from the baseball filled SoMa, to a lounge/speakeasy of sorts. The theme is definitely somewhere around the 1920-1950s. From the music, the foreign movies playing in the background, and the sofa/lounge area, everything screams speakeasy. Luckily, unlike most speakeasies, there is plenty of room to both sit, and stand around. Even on a Friday night, I was able to move around easily, with plenty of room to spare. \n\nAs far as drinks go, it's your straight up cocktail bar. Alchemist does have their own concoctions such as the Beez Nuts, but I always stick to the Manhattan when I venture to cocktail bars. Price-wise, they're around the usual price of $12-15, so that shouldn't shock you at all. Taste-wise, my Manhattan was pretty amazing. It was strong, just how I like it, and had the right ratios of each of the ingredients. I enjoyed my drink, and the ambiance so much, that I proceeded to have another.\n\nWith so many bars in San Francisco, sometimes you just want to drink in a chill spot where you can actually hear what people are saying, and have room to move around. Alchemist fulfills both of those requirements, and adds on great ambiance as well. This is a great place to grab some drinks with a few friends, and even better, grab drinks after the Giants win another game.", "author": "Michael W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-05-09", "description": "I really really really like this place. I've been here for a New Year's Eve party, work happy hour event, long night of drinks with an old friend to catch up, someone's birthday,  and will be back next week for happy hour with a small group.\n\nAlright, let's do this.\n\nDRINKS: Tasty cocktails for $11. Not a long a menu, but the variety is good. And if you have a sense of humor, you'll enjoy the names. I've at least tasted everything and haven't hated any of it. That's a big deal. Two Words: Beez Nuts!!! Two More Words (if you're dragging your friend here and they hate cocktails): High Life!!! If you're coming for an event, expect to wait a minute. \n\nFOOD: They have it! Get the sweet potato tater tots. Perfect for when you accidentally get drunk---you probably will---because the cocktails are stiff and the bartenders have lead hands. There's some other stuff on the menu, but these are easy to shove in your mouth.\n\nSPACE: Beautiful day light. Dark and moody in the evenings. Tall ceilings, sweet brick walls. Not overly stylized. Sweet projections to stare at when you need a break from talking.\n\nSTAFF: Door dudes are awesome (they've laughed at my lame banter). Staff is TCOB. Bar back brought me water as I was borderline faded and ready to melt into my chair on New Year's Eve.\n\nMUSIC: Good throwbacks playing in the background (50's, not 80's-90's). Louis Prima & Kelly Smith on the 1s and 2s! Find myself singing along in the restroom.\n\nSPEAKING OF RESTROOM: May not be important to you, but it is to me! This is my least favorite part of being here. But it's multi-stall, clean, and I haven't had to wait in a long-ass line so I can't take a star away for that.\n\nSEMI-PRIVATE EVENTS: I don't know if I suck at searching (I'm pretty sure I don't because I'm obsessive and research the shit out of everything), but does anyone realize how difficult it is to reserve a space that can accommodate a group of 20 for happy hour and serves food without a ridiculous minimum?! It's hard. So if you find yourself organizing events, just go here. You're welcome.\n\nHOW IT COMPARES: Since everyone compares this place to Local Edition, I'll share my thoughts. The layout is open like Local Edition, the drink menu is equally tasty, and I've even see one of the bartenders working at both bars, but it definitely doesn't have the same atmosphere. The atmosphere (on weeknights, happy hour into the late evening) reminds me more of Rye: laid back, pleasant, ready and willing to work with whatever your drinking mood is.\n\nOVERALL: Come here if you're looking for an interesting space to enjoy a great cocktail menu. And if you're looking for a classic done right or something obscure, the bartender dudes I've ordered from are legit so they have you covered. Oh yeah, there's shuffle board! WTF?! It's like El Rio and (fine) Local Edition had a baby!", "author": "Phoebe G."}

Their decor is trendy without being annoyingly hipster and the entry way was lined with various potions and ingredients made our hero feel like he was walking into Hogwarts or something.  The venue feels like a multi-level brick walled warehouse space with a lot of nice lounge furniture and a dimly lit vibe.  There's no DJ's, annoying music videos, or anything too distracting going on, so this spot is prime for just chilling out and chatting.\n\nDrinks are fairly standard for downtown at around $11 a cocktail and $6-8 a beer.  Their Japanese infused tater tots were also pretty cool and tasted great fresh out of the kitchen.  The menus here aren't overwhelming and the bartender was very good with recommendations and took time hand crafting a great drink.  This is definitely a bar worth checking out in the SoMa area of SF if you're into just hanging out with a couple friends in a non-pretentious, comfortable environment.\n\nPROS:\n- Really large spacious venue.\n- Good social vibe that's apt for hanging out or a date.\n- Simple but diverse food and cocktail menu that hits the spot.\n\nCONS:\n- They don't seem to have any beers on draft.

Fortunately  this bar is more consistently pleasing than the Giants have been of late.  Sigh...\n\nI had the most delightful interaction with the boucer/doorman the other day, he made me laugh.  He's charming and funny, he kicks the experience off well.  I really like the stripped down, speakeasy feel of the place, the second floor open floor plan/large window combo give it a nice vibe and I love that you don't feel trapped even when the place is crowded.\n\nThe cocktail menu is what keeps us coming back though.  My go-to is the 'Somethin With Vodkah', I love the combo of thyme with elderflower liqueur.  I had a horse named Mr. T when I was little, so I also love that they have a drink called B.A. Baracus, sadly I'm not a scotch drinker, but still, it makes me happy that it's there.  It is also great that they have a couple of inventive non-alcoholic cocktails on the menu, for those times when it's your turn to be the designated driver but you want something more exciting than water or a soda.\n\nAll in all, this place is a winner and is well worth a stop.", "author": "Renae H."}

I understand the concept of a mixology bar, I mean it has become as ubiquitous as macaroons, speakeasies, love of corgis and TOMS. What is never in style however is being rude to customers. We asked for a drink -  no, it wasn't a vodka soda - and was flatly denied. \"No.\" was all I heard and he went on to ignore us. I politely inquired why and after a few seconds of superior silence he said, \"We don't carry that. You can choose another brand, or something...if you want...\" \n\nI'm sorry if I offended your superior mixologist sensibilities but you could have just said, \"no, we don't carry that actually, we specialize in _.

Maybe one of the weirder and more interesting confluence of drinkers I've seen in a while. I think the SOMA/FIdi proximity makes for people gathering from various companies and not folks who would normally drink together. Marina chicks and tech dudes in the same group? Gotta be a company thing. Came here late after seeing a show. Got a couple of drinks before catching the train out of town.

This was a very refreshing atmosphere, likely due to the location.  It's possible that Giants fans are simply the most democratizing rabble imaginable - no matter the environment, they sort of shut down the hipster too-cool-for-school vibe in any scenario. So plus one on the location to make it a better crowd of good people.\n\n*&* I doubt it *was* the Giants fans that poured in about 3/4 the way through our visit.....  The owner (I think) & the staff were professional, on the ball, and cheerful... no disdain, and certainly no \"I know better than you what you like\", which is a constant    problem with this \"movement\".  It's likely they still just considered themselves noble bartenders crafting high end cocktails.  They even seemed to deconstruct the \"silly drink name\" list, quite well, showing a bit of coy sass and good natured aplomb - obviously not taking themselves too seriously.\n\nThe barkeep that tended to us was friendly but professional without being curt during her 4 or 5 person deep crush....  as busy as it got, she was able to converse, keep up with drinks, and still provide \"service\", in the lost and traditional sense of the word.\n\nI guess that's why I enjoyed my experience so much - this place is obviously about hospitality, and that's all too rare nowadays.  Perusing their website after the fact, I see them actually use the concept as a hallmark of their mission... and it's lovely to see.  As a hotel guy, me and friends joke that the problem with modern hospitality is that there's none of it.\n\nIt's really refreshing to find a corner of this city where good-natured service and professional hospitality isn't just an operational decision, but a way of life.

I'm all about positivity, so let's start with the pros: \n\n1) Pro doorman with nothing but a great attitude, no hassle getting in;\n2) Drinks were tasty, strong and reasonably priced.\n\nNow for the not-so-much:\n1) The interior. I don't see the resemblance to Local Edition that everyone else talks about - this is much more open, lofty and multi-level. Having said that, it's a somewhat generic look. Compared to say, Wilson & Wilson or Blind Barber in Culver City, I felt like Alchemist lacked a \"wow!\" factor.\n2) Four bartenders for a place this size is ridic. Install a satellite bar near the front and hire more servers.\n3) I'm all for inclusiveness, but having said that, it wouldn't hurt to be a bit more selective in regard to who gets admitted. There were some embarrassingly sloppy drunk people stumbling all over and bumping into people; shouldn't happen at a place like this.\n\nUltimately, Alchemist needs to figure out what it is.

I actually walked away liking it.  Non-baseball night.\n\nThe room was cool and the decorations were actually quirky and interesting without being too kitchy.  Great spaces and nice feel to it.  Drinks were interesting.  We liked Shrub Down and the Vokaah.  Two other drinks were less than yummy but our \"mixologist\" was nice enough to notice we hated them and replaced our bad with good.  \n\nBeer list is pretty awful and needs a lot more focus around being as quality as they strive for \"top notch craft\" and becoming an \"incubator\".  Time to make that thought fully integrated across the whole venue.\n\nStaff was great.  Room would be cool to rent out (with my own beer list) and the theme is interesting.  Crowd it a bit odd but I am sure that will change and evolve as Baseball starts and people find the place.", "author": "Doreen D."}

Love trying new places on a company tab, so my review may be a little swayed since I paid no attention to the prices. \n\nSo glad this place has appetizers - I hate bars without food...it's asking for TROUBLE. Overall, best tater tots EVER. Classier than when you were a kid of course. They were so cripsy  and made me want to gorge on fast food for the rest of the night. \n\nLove the drink menu - it matches the dark, mysteriousness of the place. I had a Campfire Fizz - although not called that (It's the name on their online menu...I just can't remember the actual name). First time I had mezcal and boy was it SMOKEY. I also never had egg in an alcoholic beverage so it was interesting. The first few sips were nasty, but as a true trooper, I didn't waste alcohol and kept sipping. It eventually got really good! \n\nNext was a glass of chardonnay, can't go wrong. Proves that they have both normal and interesting drinks for everyone! \n\nWings and crispy spring rolls were yummy too. \n\nThis bar is upstairs and is very cool in general.

We got there at 4pm, which happened to be when they opened.\n\nOur cocktails were all good. They had a great selection of fun drinks. This is definitely another mixology bar.  The atmosphere is adorable....vintage leather couches, type writers, old vintage lamps, etc. Very speakeasy-ish. The bar was pleasantly light actually in the afternoon. The bar is on the 2nd floor and has nice large windows. Some people might not like this, but it suited our business crowd well. \n\nThe bartenders were very nice. We were sitting in a lounge however, and we had to order from the bar the entire time. It would have been nice to have a waitress at some point. Maybe they have servers later at night. \n\nWe were also able to order from a limited menu from the thai place downstairs. There were about 5-6 appetizers to choose from. Definitely not enough to fill you up by any means, but it was nice to snack on something. \n\nThe reason for my lack of a star is that the place was virtually empty. I would not recommend coming here unless you are with a group of people. There was not any music, or many people, and no TV so your experience would be fairly lackluster.\n\nA great new addition to SOMA though, I look forward to visiting again soon.

The music sounds very 1920s and gives the place very speakeasy vibe.\n\nDrinks are market rate (which is to say overpriced), but they were solid. I got a couple Moscow mules and they didn't stiff me on the liquor. Bartenders were nice.\n\nThat said, have a hard time giving it too high a rating because of the crowd. Super Asian, sorta yuppie, with a terrible male:female ratio. I know it's a bar in SF, and in startup center in Soma, but the ratio in here seemed especially horrible. I wasn't even on the prowl that particular night, I just found it hilarious and depressing looking around and seeing 2-3 guys talking to just about every girl in the establishment. Groups seemed pretty segregated as well, although I find that typical of SF.\n\nIf you're just looking for some nice artisan cocktails and are content to stick to your friends, I think this is a very solid spot.

I called all my girl friends and set up a ladies night and reserved a lounge area for $150 for happy hour.  It seemed so convenient and easy to do online, but there was very little description on how things work, like would we get kicked out or our seats at 9pm if the seats were reserved after that, etc.  I emailed them for the answers and they didn't respond.  I finally just pulled the trigger and paid the $150 and then I got all my email responses.  Not great customer service off the bat...should have been a sign.\n\nOnce we got there we had a nice table in the corner with some fun chairs, but they were completely uncomfortable because it was so loud in there at happy hour we all had to yell and lean forward out of our chairs to talk.  I thought this place was made for large groups because of how they set up the reservations, but if you come with more than two people you won't hear anyone at the other end of the table.  We ended up playing musical chairs so we could talk to everyone.  \n\nTwo of my girl friends got there at 5pm, I got there at 5:30pm and at that time the server still hadn't come over to ask for an order yet.  We waited another 15 minutes and I gave up and went up to the bar to see if there was a server coming, since we hadn't actually seen one.  The bar tender wouldn't look at me and seemed annoyed I was cutting his line to ask a question.  He snapped at me to go back to my seat and said she would be there soon.  Soon was about another 20 minutes later.  \n\nThe server was very nice, and she apologized for being late, but that doesn't make up for the fact that we lost an hour and a half of our 4 hour time window that I already paid for!  We ordered lots of food and drinks, which took the normal amount of time.  The server did bring over a inexpensive bottle of Cava, which was pretty good, to say sorry, however the problem with that is the $150 minimum for the table was only on alcohol and now we are getting drunk on a something cheap and we weren't able to get to our minimum because who can drink $150 worth of alcohol between 5 girls in two hours!\n\nNo where on the reservation site did it say the minimum was only for alcohol, if it did is wasn't clear.  We ended up spending almost $300, because the waitress suggested buying two bottles of wine to cover the minimum and we could take it home.  I'm pretty sure that is bad drinking and driving practice and I see them loosing their liquor license over that one day.  The bottles went over the $150 minimum and then they added tax and gratuity on, which is how the bill got so high!  I would have liked to lower the gratuity.  It was only a party of 5!\n\nLastly, the bill actually came in two parts!  Apparently the food is a different company, so they need to bill separate.  This made it harder to calculate who owed what.  The food was great.  Way better than all the drinks.  \n\nIn the end, I will never ever be going back to this bar.

No party atmosphere, just good ole relaxing with a beverage & people watching. I have been in when it has been super busy as well as quiet as a church mouse. All my experiences there have been pleasant. Last summer they even allowed us to have my son's steam-punk inspired high school graduation party in their space. Being that most of the attendees were underage, the bar staff kindly made \"mocktails\" for his celebration & they were EXCELLENT. I was allowed to bring in a caterer & a DJ as long as the noise stayed at a decent level. Their help arranging everything was priceless & they get extra bay love for that night. I take visiting guests, old friends & business associates to their well hidden location. They are a  jewel of SF.", "author": "M G."}

It is a great addition to the area.  The decor is very dim, and they have a couple of old movies playing off the brick building wall.  It's a very relaxed atmosphere, and the servers are very friendly and attentive. Felt like my friends were running the place.  We had shots all night, and I did try one drink that has jalapenos in it.  Very nice to drink it a 1:00 am to give a kick in my head.  I didn't like the Dale's pale ale beer though, very bitter, but the good think was I was able to nurse that beer for about an hour.  I hope this place does well and attracts more girls!

The first time I went, my bartender was high or something.  He started making my friend's drink and took a good 10 minutes to pour whiskey into the cup, and had started on mine, got distracted, walked to the back of the bar and I think kind of had a storytelling session with another bartender, came back, finished making my drink and just kind of sat the drink in front of him and didn't hand it to me.  We had to reach around people to grab our drinks and he started on some others.  We stared at him to see if he wanted payment, and he didn't pay attention or care.  So we put cash down (ugh, too nice) and walked away, puzzled. I thought maybe this would be a first time thing, but i went back another night and the service wasn't as strange or crappy but still really slow.
