At work, I had half a bagel painted with cream cheese, and I finished it in at least ten minutes rather than eating it without a cream cheese.  Later on, someone came and bought Noah's best bagels, and they looked a bit richer.  I like the one with blueberries; they're perfect for breakfast just like the muffin.  I thought I cut any of Noah's bagel in half neatly, but I nearly destroyed it.  It would be nice to buy me a special bagel slicer, so I can guillotine the bagel. :-}\n\nMy first purchase in Noah's Bagel is the Hummus Veg-out and I get to have a fruit cup with it followed by a long slice of pickle.  It's too bad Noah's never had any type of bagel that's gluten free, so I'm OK with a multigrain instead.  When I quickly head back home this afternoon, I thought I give my mom my other half of the bagel sandwich.  We both find my bagel sandwich tasty and satisfying.  I should've asked the staff to hold the onions since the taste of it is strong, but that's nothing I can't handle.  I'll be glad back once more to go for what I like to purchase.", "author": "Jimmy C."}

I don't know the story behind that, but it seemed very unprofessional and disruptive. Anyway, my bf and I tried to order breakfast from the menu, only to find out (after ordering everything, but luckily before paying) that they ran out of eggs. Um... okay. That seems like a staple that shouldn't be out, especially since it wasn't that late in the day. They were also out of some of the deli meats. What was left?

Especially when I can make the same things at home for at least 1/3 of the price but don't because I'm busy in the mornings and don't have time?  I feel like Noah's goes out of its way to put itself in convenient locations and then intentionally puts no effort into its food to spite desperate customers on their way to work.  Ok, that's probably not true, but still.  I'm not complaining about the bready, not authentic, dry bagels.  All I want is to have them toasted well.  Apparently this is too much to ask.  The coffee shop down the street sometimes sells Noah's bagels and toasts them way better for the same price.  I think this morning's venture into a veggie egg ciabatta sandwich really ruined Noah's for me.  How can you go wrong with a combo of egg, mushrooms, spinach, tomato and cheese?  You can!!  If you're Noah's Bagels!  You don't put any salt in the food, so you end up with a dull, flat tasting egg and a sour tomato taste.  Horrible!  Even Subway seasons its sandwiches with salt, pepper and oil, and for way less of a price.  \n\nUgh.  I guess the point of this review is don't waste your money on the veggie egg sandwich.  I'll probably still go to the local Noah's out of desperation every once in a while because it's so convenient, but never again with the egg sandwiches.", "author": "Pearl L."}

I like the texture and the flavor. The salmon smear goes great with the savory bagels. I get coupons in the mail every once in awhile for $4 off a bagel box with 13 bagels and 2 smears.
