The chirashi came with 2 slices of 5 types of fish-- the selection that day was salmon, tuna (perfect red color, not fishy at all), the hamachi fell apart a bit, another pink type of fish (not sure which) was also tasty and held together more firmly, and the escolar was pretty standard. They topped the bowl with a sprinkling of ikura (the salty kind, though not quite seawater level).\n\nMainstream complaints of the wasabi and ginger being too close to the fish, but that's every sushi takeout ever.

Well this is the sushi spot that we found on Groupon that was amazing that I referenced in that review. Geary is really a great street, tons of good bars and restaurants on that long strip of road. The golden donut was all right, but they stay open until midnight which is pretty sweet. The hogshead dive bar, one of the better in the city that we have found so far, also on Geary. But back to sushi:) This sushi spot is close quarters, not a lot of breathing room but the quality of the fish was excellent. I'd like to fancy myself somewhat of a sushi snob so I would highly recommend hitting this place, hopefully with a Groupon if they're still running their promotion, and giving them a try. And what made it even more exciting was that we sat next to an older gentleman that had multiple large bottles of sake all around his seating area that decided to tell me how good-looking and voluptuous I was when my husband went to the bathroom. Told me he's been living in San Francisco since the 70s, since the sexual revolution he said.

We made reservations for 6pm and were seated right away.  \n-Our waitress was very efficient and took our orders.  We had four orders: salmon with scallops roll, jalapeno Hamachi roll, salmon belly sashimi (4 pieces) and the lobster roll.  I really loved the salmon belly sashimi, I ate my pieces so fast that I forgot to initially take pictures of them.  They were fresh and slid off my tongue type of delicious.  The lobster roll was my second favorite because it was very flavorful.  My mouth was in shock with so many different flavors--from sweet to spicy.  I especially liked the crunchy stuff atop.  The salmon with scallops was good but more on the plain side for me despite the fact that they added some flavor on top (Sriracha I believe).  The jalapeno Hamachi was my least favorite, it had way too much rice rolled up on the sides and very less fish.  It had so much rice that I barely tasted any fish.  What stood out more was the jalapeno as the main taste.  \n\nImprovement:\n-The jalapeno Hamachi roll came out last and very late.  We finished all our food and maybe waited about a good ten minutes before this came out.  I would recommend this roll come out with the others.\n\nTips:\n-I would come here again with the Groupon deal.  \n-I looked at the omakase orders and they looked reasonably price.  The next time I come, I would love to try the omakase!\n-Cash and credit cards accepted.\n-Very fast service.\n-There were several TVs so you won't miss any sports games, FYI.", "author": "Kristy L."}

The Temptation roll had all of my favorite elements: crab, unagi, avocado, etc. but it was rolled too loosely and too large. It fell apart as soon as I tried to pick it up.

First of all, the ebi tempura rolls had tough soggy cold tempura inside.  Granted it's a roll, but usually it's more warm or fresh.  Secondly, the nigiri wasn't made with actual sushi rice.  Wrong texture and taste.  Third was the agedashi tofu. I have never in my life seen the grainy hard tofu used instead of the silky tofu.  I thought it had curdled or gone bad.  When I inquired about this with the waitress, she didn't know what kind of tofu was actually used and had to ask st the kitchen.  It was actually gross.  The clincher of the whole evening was that she didn't offer to refund or exchange this weird tofu for something else.  I feel like an authentic restaurant would have been upset or embarrassed about the gross tofu and made it right.

There's Japanese pop music in the background - like ELT, but higher pitched. The inevitable flat-screen TV played silently in the background, subtitled in English.\n\nThe food is as good as I hoped. The obligatory miso soup (shiro miso) was sweet and flavorful, and it paired nicely with the genmaicha tea. Generous mounds of wasabi and sliced ginger.\n\n1. Vegetable Tempura was a real surprise. Arashi avoids oily dishes; that arrived as a warm vegetable tempura wrapped in inari skin. Tasty and unexpected.\n\n2. Nigiri. I tried eel and saba nigiri, and both were tender and tasty. The size was a little smaller than I hoped, given the price, but the flavor was on target.\n\n3. Spider Roll was also well-seasoned, with not a hint of oiliness.

It was delicious and passed my tests of fresh green tea, crispy tempura, and flavorful miso soup. On Wed, the food was so wonderful, we raved about it. The staff was attentive and cordial. We had Tempura Udon, Beef Teriyaki, and a Spider Roll. The tempura was very generous and crispy. The soup broth was delicious although just slightly salty. The quality of the beef for the teriyaki was very good and sliced nicely with a bowl of sauce in the middle of the plate instead of slathered all over the beef. The spider sushi was beautiful and delicious. The miso soup was red and white miso and perfect.\n\nWe decided to come back with a party of 6 for my birthday on 5/27/18 (Sun.).  When we arrived at 4:25 pm, the woman looked upset that we came without reservations. I told her that we were told on Wed night that we wouldn't need reservations if we came around that time. She said who told you that? I told her a man had. The restaurant wasn't full and we were seated. So, I don't know what her problem was.  Interesting thing was my boyfriend & I decided to order the same items.  \"When the food came, it was INCONSISTENT WITH PRESENTATION AND TASTE.\" The beef teriyaki came with too much sauce poured all over it instead of a bowl of sauce in the middle of the plate. The chicken teriyaki also came with too much sauce poured on and swimming in it. The soup for the udon noodles was tasteless and almost like just water with a little bit of soy sauce in it.

The miso soup shocked me as it was only white miso and less robust because there was no red miso in it.   \n\nWait staff was rough and she even addressed as \"Hey guys.\" and the rest of the conversation was similar. She poured the tea so fast that I was afraid that it was going to fly out of the cups and spill on us. \n\nOne last thing that 3 people at our table complained about and found difficult to deal with was the very strong perfume smell in the area we were sitting.  It made one get a headache and another a sore throat. It may have been permeating from the restrooms. \n\nAll in all, our 2nd visit to Arashi on the weekend was a huge disappointment. The food and customer service is inconsistent and there doesn't appear to be a standard for either.", "author": "Cynthia H."}

The restaurant had the typical sushi bar and also a separate dining room separated by a curtain.\nWe ordered...\n\nChirashi - with tuna, salmon, salmon roe, shrimp tail, tamago, etc. over rice:\nMost of the fish tasted pretty fresh and sweet, but the tamago wasn't very sweet. The serving seemed to be on the small side too.\n\nFish Tacos - 2 Pcs w/ Albacore, salmon, avocado, salsa on fried nori:\nMost variations come on a fried tortilla chip or wonton crisp, so fried nori was an interesting rendition. It was crunchy and somewhat puffed up. It came together nicely with creamy avocado, strips of fish, and tart salsa.\n\nCha-Shu Ramen - cha-shu, fish cake, mushroom, bamboo shoots, egg, bean sprouts, corn, green onion, fried garlic, dry seaweed:\nMr. Joy was curious to try the ramen, but as usual, I'm skeptical of ramen from restaurants that do not specialize in ramen. The broth was a little bland. The pork was rather dry and the egg was slightly overcooked. The noodles and various toppings like corn and seaweed strips were okay though. \n\nPerhaps it is best to stick to the sushi and the rolls. The fish tacos were the most enjoyable of the bunch.

I know Sundays aren't great days to get sushi, but how do you run out of salmon when you are an average sushi restaurant?! Was the salmon in the back not defrosting fast enough? Mind blown. Anyway, we had a Groupon and were pretty hungry so we decided to stay.   \n\n+ Chirashi - decently sized portions. The albacore was definitely the highlight of this dish as it was extremely fatty and melted in my mouth, definitely a pleasant surprise. Everything else was pretty average, though.\n\nSidenote: I'm usually cautious of restaurants that serve 'white tuna,' since it could be walu/escolar (which may cause digestive problems), so I opted for no white tuna. I later found out that they have walu/escolar on their menu, so I should have said no escolar instead -___-. I'm pretty sure it was included in the chirashi, but when we asked what a particular opaque white cut of fish was, our server said 'butterfish' aka escolar, upon Googling what a 'butterfish' was. We didn't end up getting the shits that night cause we each only ate one piece so I guess we dodged that bullet.. although I think you have to eat a lot of it to actually experience some discomfort.\n\n+ Hamachi toro nigiri - decided to order this because it seemed interesting, but the texture wasn't as buttery as I imagined. Never had this anywhere, so maybe it's supposed to be like this.\n\n+ X and Spider rolls - haven't ordered rolls in dayssss, but once in a while I don't mind some carbs, fish covered in sauce and whatever else they pile and stuff into those things lol. We asked the waiter what they would substitute the salmon with in the rolls, and he replied that they actually do have salmon but just enough for rolls. I'm guessing they only had scraps left which could be thrown on the rolls. Size of the rolls were a bit small for the price.\n\nOverall, not terrible but I'd probably want to try other spots around the area before coming back here again.", "author": "Laverne N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-02-05", "description": "My mind is kind of blown that this place has four stars, where more legit sushi places (especially in San Mateo which is a sushi hot spot) have the same rating. The four stars here is a bit deceptive to me, and not all four star places are created equal! We came here because we saw a Groupon for this place but we actually intended to go to Ariake Sushi and I mistakenly read the name of the restaurant the Groupon was for (which is nearby and better if you're searching for a sushi spot in this area). We came here on a Friday, and it was very easy to get a seat. Also, I will say one thing about this place: the service is very good and the servers are all very friendly. \n\nSushi places are broken up into different types for me. You have your super high end sushi spot, where I often opt for the omakase menu for about $100 and only go for a special occasion. Then you have your middle of the road quality sushi places, where I judge them by the following: (1) quality of sushi; and (2) price. This is like the weekly Friday date night type of sushi restaurant. And then you have your all you can eat sushi restaurants, where a whole different set of criteria apply. I would classify this place as a middle of the road sushi place. So how does it rate? \n\n(1) Quality of Sushi: The quality was not bad. I would say it's on par with other middle of the road sushi places I've been to. The rolls are decent, though a bit small which I talk about below. Their uni is a little weird, because it was cut up into a lot of little pieces when they served it to us. As a result, it looked a little unappetizing. \n\n(2) Price of Sushi: I was not a fan of the size of our rolls. As a point of comparison, other places, like Fuji Sukiyaki or Joy Sushi in San Mateo, have much bigger rolls for the price. I think we ordered three rolls. Normally, this would fill us up at those two places in San Mateo. However, I was still hungry afterward. Even with the Groupon discount, this dinner ran us about $70 which is fine for a middle of the road quality sushi place but not justified by the food we got.\n\nUltimately, knowing that I could get heftier, good quality rolls at the same price made me feel like I wouldn't come back to this place. I think like Jared says in Silicon Valley, this place needs to pivot if it's going to stay in business and to get people to come back.", "author": "Lin Z."}

Very reasonable prices for sake and beer, which he promptly ordered upon sitting down. I attributed it to him being of a certain type of men, the type who apparently thinks that it's a good idea to chase a cold beer down with a shot of hot sake, I am not into that combo, but I would take a small sip of hot sake from time to time.\n\nI'm beginning to appreciate portion appropriate sushi. You see, sushi should be a one bite food, you pick up with your hands or chopsticks, you gracefully put it in your mouth, close your mouth and then chew. That's the gauge I'd have for a good portion, too small it feels that you've been cheated, too large it feels that you are committing gluttony, you don't need to be religious to feel overindulgent.  \n\nI find Arashi has good portion control. In addition, its white tuna was quite delicious. It makes a distinction between hamachi and hamachi belly, that's interesting enough for me to order the belly just to see if I could tell the difference, sadly I couldn't but I suspect belly meat generally is fattier, and to some, fishier. Like when you get your lutefisk fix in Norway after mid October. They often serve two portions, the regular piece of meat, and then onto the \"back of the fish\", as the Norwegians would call it. It's fishier, and therefore, to some, yummier. I liked the belly a lot. We did another order of it.\n\nThere are many advantages to eating here, perhaps the unexpected one is that it's a fairly inexpensive expedition, if you sticks to their nigiri selections.", "author": "Victoria E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-14", "description": "I have to admit that, before coming to Arashi, they hardly made a blip on my Yelp radar.  Not that I didn't think they'd be worth trying; there just wasn't anything to prioritize them over any of the other Japanese restaurants that the Richmond has to offer.  At least, until my buddy offered to split his Amazon Local deal with me.  Woohoo for eating on the cheap!\n\nTaking over the spot where Rockin' Crawfish used to be, it's hard to imagine this is the same space (Arashi is much more open and brighter).  As for the menu, it's pretty typical for the most part (starters, sashimi, a lot of rolls, udon/ramen, and dinner entrees over bento boxes), except with the addition of robata grill and house specialty items.\n\n**NOTE: Prices are off the menu, but our portions may have been different because of our Amazon Local deal - the starters mentioned below plus 2 Miso Soup's ($1.95 each), Garlic Edamame ($4.95), and any two sushi rolls (the soup and edamame were pretty standard).\n\n-- AGEDASHI TOFU - Fried Tofu with Bonito Flakes and Tempura Sauce...$4.50\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arashi-sushi-house-san-francisco?select=tCMSi8YaKXhsr9tu3e5k0w)\nMaybe it's because I haven't had this in a while, but the dish was pretty good.  Although the skin was a little gummy, the tofu was pretty big and silky smooth.  The sauce was nice as well, though bonito flakes would have been much better than the shavings we got.\n\n-- MIXED TEMPURA (6 Pcs)...$5.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arashi-sushi-house-san-francisco?select=uvQ6_BsnwDiw31t8zp9VOQ)\nI've had some bad luck with tempura dishes lately, but this one was surprisingly decent.  Not only was the batter mostly crispy, but it didn't have that \"fried in old oil\" look/taste to it.  Plus, the veggies and shrimp weren't torched, which can't be said for others I've had recently...\n\n-- PLUM SAKE SASHIMI...Unlisted (though we estimated about $10.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arashi-sushi-house-san-francisco?select=v7z1YrjZ0mm0n9dE-sNKXw)\nIt's a shame this isn't on the regular menu, as it was the best dish of the night.  There was a slight tartness from the plum sauce, but I thought the taste of the dish as a whole was good.  The cuts of salmon were relatively fresh and I liked the slight kick of the jalapeno.\n\n-- X ROLL - Hamachi & Avocado topped with Salmon, Tuna, Tobiko, and Spicy Mayo...$10.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arashi-sushi-house-san-francisco?select=RULzPzTYWTaBO8-Ax4X9jg)\nSimilar to a Rainbow Roll, but better (no shrimp or crab salad).  That being said, I'd be hard pressed to say this was exceptional.  All three cuts seemed fresh enough, but as much as I like all three types individually, the overall taste didn't come together like I would have hoped.\n\n-- BAY SCALLOP - Spicy Tuna topped with Seared Scallop, Green Onions, and Spicy Mayo...$11.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arashi-sushi-house-san-francisco?select=dBdvDQNHZG_fII6UD-sqHw)\nI generally like rolls with (bay) scallops, but this one missed the mark.  While the spicy tuna wasn't bad (not a big fan in general), the scallops were rather \"meh\".  Rather than adding a nice crust/texture, the sear served more to numb the natural flavor/sweetness of the scallop.\n\n-- CRUNCHY LOBSTER - Lobster Salad and Cucumber topped with Salmon, Avocado, Crunchy Flake, Tobiko, Green Onion, and Special Sauce...$12.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arashi-sushi-house-san-francisco?select=zE6ayzjJ58szdg65g_gs2w)\nA typical \"jive ass roll\", though different than what I had imagined.  High school Mike might have liked the mayo, sauce, and \"flakes\", but current Mike thought they only overwhelmed the lobster and salmon, which should be featured instead of (literally) buried.  Skip.\n\nIn the case of most sushi joints, I usually find that the hot/cooked dishes end up holding back the rest of the food.  However, in this case, the rolls (ha!) were reversed.  For that reason, and the fact that most people probably come here for the sushi, I'm rounding down from THREE AND A HALF STARS.  Although, that's not to say Arashi can't be better; from what I've seen on Yelp, there's some potential with their sashimi and specialty dishes!", "author": "Mike L."}

I love the combination of oyster, uni and quail egg. I did wish the oysters had more of a sweet briny flavor to them, but this was still a very enjoyable dish. It was hard to take everything in one bite due to all the different components, but I didn't care since I loved the flavors.\n\n*Butterfish carpaccio: butter fish, jalapeno, sweet onion, ikura, ponzu sauce\nThis was okay. The ponzu sauce was a little too much when I poured the whole container onto the dish. I wished this had a little more heat to counteract the fattiness and citrus flavors.\n\n*Sake toro nigiri: salmon belly ($4.95)\n*Hamachi toro nigiri: yellowtail belly ($5.50)\n*Ankimo nigiri: monkfish liver ($4.50)\n*Uni nigiri: sea urchin ($9.50) +Quail egg (+$1)\n\nAll the nigiri was pretty good.

We were forgotten and forced to wait 40 minutes for our food without any acknowledgement or apology. \n\nIf it wasn't for the Groupon deal, I wouldn't have come here. Arashi serves average, somewhat pricey sushi compared to other local sushi restaurants and is definitely not a bad place, but nothing particularly special. My boyfriend and I have eaten here twice now and have minimal complaints about our first visit; however, our second visit was sadly very disappointing. We waited a whopping 40 minutes for our order of three rolls. The waitress and/or chefs must have forgotten to prepare our food, since the table next to us ordered at the same time but already finished and paid before we even got our first roll. The waitress never even checked in on us or apologized for the absurdly long wait. We ordered the Rainbow roll, 49er roll, and the Lion King. To us, the 49er roll was a bit plain and the Lion King was too saucy. The reason why I'm giving this place three stars instead of two is because the waiter who started his shift and served us towards the end of our meal was friendly and nice.", "author": "Jacqueline L."}

For example,  the tuna nigiri we got, it looked like they just placed the tuna on top of the tiny rice ball. when i picked up the sushi with my chopsticks, the sushi immediately felling apart. The sashimi were small and thin. It wasn't worth of $32. Also, the fresh wasabi they served, it reminds me of hot dog relish. \n\nAlso, Arashi gave out a free bowl of edamame for each table.

It was great to get to choose any two rolls you would like and not be limited to a reduced menu.  The crunchy lobster roll was totally bananas and had that saucy crunchy composure that many sushi rolls have.  Also got the Foxy roll, which was good, but missed the mark a bit on the mango it was supposed to deliver on.\n\nAdditionally, they have a Yelp check in deal for a free hot sake that they let us use in addition to the Groupon.

Highly recommend grabbing this coupon and giving Arashi a shot, or, just stopping in for good sushi when you're in the area.  \n\nMore sushi places should consider putting together a Groupon that involves an affordable fixed menu/sampling with a little bit of customization so that the customer can leave experiencing an array of flavors on a sensible budget.", "author": "Sean S."}

Shortly after eating my food, I could feel my stomach turning. I spent the rest of my afternoon in excruciating stomach pain thereby ruining the rest of my afternoon and evening. Eventually, the pain was so bad I vomited it all back up.

It had the right dryness and stickiness to keep the rolls right and tight. \n\nNothing tastes fishy at ALL, just clean pure notes of freshness on the palate.

Even with the groupon for our party of 2 it was still quite expensive for the amount of food they give you.\n\nWe order 3 different rolls, which were quite small considering how they each costed over 10$. The first roll that arrived was the bay scallop roll, which was pretty good so we had high hopes for the other 2 rolls. Our 2nd roll was the volcano roll, which was very bland and the worst part was that the salmon was disgustingly chewy to the point that we did not even want to eat it. The volcano roll was also very poorly constructed to the point where the rolls were falling apart and they also gave us extremely tiny pieces of unagi in it. Our last roll was the halloween roll, which also had the same disgusting chewy salmon in it. \n\nIn addition to the bad food, our server was also very slow with service when there were hardly any other people there. They also gave us wrong food that belonged to another table twice. After eating such nasty rolls, we never want to come back here again.", "author": "Andy Z."}

I found it near impossible and I learned this the hard way. I knew I should have stopped trying after the fifth sushi restaurant on Yelp that was closed. \n\nAfter driving through the Richmond, we finally just settled for Arashi and it was just what I expected...overpriced mediocre sushi. :( I ordered the 8 piece sake toro sashimi for $14.95 (only $1 more than regular sake sashimi) and it was actually really fresh, but pieces were cut pretty small. I'm so glad I ordered the toro because I traded one piece for my bf's regular sake from his Chirashi and it was so much better. We also shared Tamago nigiri and the Sunset roll (cucumber instead of rice, avocado, tuna, salmon, and another fish I can't remember). The Sunset roll only came with 5 pieces at $8.95. The ends of the rolls had a decent amount of fish, but the three pieces in the middle, not so much. Avocado was also lacking. There wasn't much flavor to the roll either. \n\nThe service was on the slow side even though the restaurant was almost empty. Mostly disappointing meal, but I did like their sake toro.

The staff is friendly enough and the rolls were yummy enough to take the leftovers home for later tonight. But they dropped a star for how they handled the misleading deals they were offering on the internet.\n\nUnfortunately, since they offered what they thought was the same deal on Groupon, Living Social and Amazon Local, they were surprised to discover Amazon Local's deal (for the same price) was completely different and they just didn't honor it and told us Amazon got it wrong. They just gave us the Groupon deal. I would have rather had the Amazon deal but oh well.\n\nSo they handed us a special Groupon sampler menu of five appetizers and one small sample roll per person from a special paper menu they give to people with deals. Hard to figure out what it's worth since this menu didn't have prices and was a sampler meal so not for regular customers but they claim it's $53 worth of food. (They also make the customer pay for sales tax on the full value of the meal (the $53) on top of whatever else you order, and then even charge sales tax on that sales tax which I'm pretty sure is wrong.)\n\nWe live a couple blocks away and are always trying the new places so when I noticed this new restaurant where the cajun place was (too bad 'cause they were good) I wanted to try it. We liked the food and may come back but not with a \"deal.\" Having lived in Japan for many years I can say this is not as good as other Japanese restaurants in our neighborhood like Daigo, Minami, or even Joo Mak a block away.", "author": "Kira B."}

First time I time was on its third day if business, and most recently last night. This has established itself as another one of my favorite sushi places, one that I'll likely come quite regularly. I love their omakase, especially their eight piece nigiri version where you get eight different kinds of fish for  I think $23.95 (this is in contrast to the 12 piece sashimi version where you get only six kinds but two pieces each). You get \"non-regular\" sushi items shipped from Japan. According to the main chef every week they get a shipment of assorted kinds. Weekend selection are likely to be better than weekdays for now, also according to the chef.\n\nLast night I ordered the clam soup and that was great also, very different from other sushi places I ordered that from. That will likely be another must order whenever I come.\n\nThis place is worthy of five stars for the food. The reason I am giving only four stars for now is that the service still seems a little challenged, even when the restaurant is only a little more than half full. They left the clam soup on the counter for a long time and didn't bring it until I asked about it, therefore allowing it too much time to cool. I also ordered a hot sake, though not with the original order, and the young lady staffperson totally forgot and I had to ask a different guy later on. It seems the fact they do delivery and takeout may be taking away too much focus.  Hope it's just growing pains and they overcome it.", "author": "H K."}

I'm thinking it would be 3x better in restaurant. For delivery though, this was top notch.  \n\nAll I'm going to talk about is the curry dish, because everything else was good/okay, unremarkable. The katsu was crispy outside and moist inside. The flavor of the curry was complex, I even got the bay leaf (Good luck in my family haha). There was substance and I could tell it wasn't just thrown together. Honestly, it's better than the curry I make, and I make great curry. It's not as good as like two other places I've been to, but that's personal preference. Plus, deliiiiiiiivery ~ \u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3001\u5d50\u3002", "author": "Vanessa H."}

Although the food wasn't bad and the fish could of been more fresh I thought the service was pretty good. This review is more to inform people of this living social/groupon deal because after eating there I was a bit curious to know if my meal was really worth $53 so I did some calculation. Also, I wanted to say that these prices are taken from the menu prices taken from the yelp pictures that was listed 5 months ago so I'm not exactly sure if they change the prices to meet the $53. \nHere's what I order\n\nSunset roll- 8.95\nTemptation roll- 8.95\nAge dashi tofu- 4.50\nMix tempura- 5.95 (menu offers 8 piece, pre fix is only 6)\nGarlic edamame -4.95\nMiso soup- 1.95 x2\nPlum salmon sashimi- not listed on the menu, but if you compare it to the other similar dish it will probably be 9.95 -10.95 tops.\n\nSo now let's add it up with out the plum salmon- the total is 37.20, let's say the plum salmon is 9.95 it would be 47.15. This is still not close to $53. I also want to mention I order the 2 most expensive roll at $8.95 each, image if you picked the one that are only 5.95 -6.50, you are even further away from the $53. \n\nSo although the deal is not by any means ripping us off, it is very misleading considering it is really not worth $53 worth of food. At this point, I rather have you let me order up to $53, than create a menu that is actually not worth that much. \n\nTo end this review. I give this place 2 and a half stars and have to think twice about coming back mainly cause it bothers me about the deal they are advertising.", "author": "Angela T."}

But sadly, I was pretty disappointed with Arashi. \n\nThe appetizers were just okay. The best thing I had was the garlic edamame, but even those I kind of wished they served were warm not cold. The set came with this plum salmon sashimi that I really did not care for. It had this green leaf or lettuce with a lemon slice and a drip of this strange sour red sauce on top of really thin sliced salmon. I really wished it was just some salmon by itself. Their agedashi tofu wasn't bad, but I've had better. Shrimp and veggie tempura was pretty on par and the dipping sauce was good.\n\nNow for the sushi rolls. They tasted good, but had way too much rice. The rice should just be able to wrap around the filling inside, but the rice rolled over that and overlapped. (Imagine like the rice kind of made a spiral.) \n\nDon't believe I'll be coming back here.", "author": "Sharon L."}

Little did I know until I sat down, the deal was for a prix fix menu. If you ask me half off for a prix fix menu with VERY minimal selection is NOT a deal! I would of much rather just got the $ back and used it to order whatever I wanted. This menu had nothing I would normally order... maybe the miso soup. It just left me kicking myself I failed to read fine print. Nonetheless I gave it a fair shot since I had the groupon and was sitting in their restaurant. \n\nTo start off service was not good. No utensils or plates. I ordered sake and didn't get until I had to remind them in the middle of my meal. They also forgot to give me my sashimi from my prix fix menu but because the meal was so disappointing I didn't even notice until left and was like \"hey.... they never gave us our picked sashimi\" (whatever that is...). I also had ordered some additional things since the prix fix was crappy but let me just say I should've stopped right there.\n\nI ordered two additional things: the Butterfish Carpaccio; one word - UNDERWHELMING. But what really was the nail in the coffin was the server bringing us out grey uni. I stared at it for a bit wondering why it was that color? I should of eaten it but I did. Grey uni = decomposing uni. \n\nAll in all... a frustrating experience with no fresh fish. Why would I go here when there are 1,001 better places in the outer richmond.

The roll of your choice is of course, rolls from the cheaper end of the menu ($9 and under). They have additional rolls for $9+, which is pretty typical of sushi places around the area. We decided on the Bay Scallop in addition to our meal, which ran for $11.95. \n\nThe service was good, mainly because we were the only ones here on a Sunday night. The other table left before we ordered our food. It was a tad awkward that the staff outnumbered us. This is a Chinese run, Japanese restaurant... pretty sure because they were all chattering away in Chinese during our entire meal. \n\nMiso soup: average, not super piping hot but nothing special from any other restaurant\nBowl of garlic edamame: super garlicky, and pretty tasty unless you hate garlic\n4 pieces of hiyashi tofu (which is now agedashi tofu): it's not normal agedashi tofu, it's delicate on flavor (or bland, depending how strong you typically expect the broth to be. I've definitely had better elsewhere)\n4 pieces of mix tempura: there were more than \"four\" pieces: 2 ebi tempura, 2 zucchini, 1 yam, 1 broccoli. It wasn't super crispy like I like, and the sauce was whatever. \n6 pieces of plum sake sashimi: This was the star of the groupon, it was really good. The waiter also suggests that you don't add soy sauce, and I agree. It was delicious. I would come back for this alone (but I didn't see it on their normal menu)\nSpider Roll: over sauced, not super pretty but still good. \nTemptation: oversauced as well, pretty decent. \n\nI got this groupon for a steal since there was an additional 20% code on top of the already discounted price so I'm not going to complain. All in all, the place isn't bad and that plum sake sashimi was great. I should come back for just the sashimi.

As mentioned in other reviews, the sushi menu is limited with the groupon. I also agree that these rolls seemed a bit smaller that the regular roll.  So if you get 4 different rolls there's no way that you get to the amount of the groupon said price.  The food was good.  But they charge sales tax on the full amount of the groupon, with a confusing explanation of how they lower that amount when they tax it again with the full bill. We ordered 1 more roll as it was not on the limited list of sushi. Total bill including groupon, tax and tip came out to $75...Which is just ok for what we got. Could have gone to another restaurant w better quality and gotten the same amount.\n\n3* Service was also really rushed. They kept bringing out dish after dish and forced us to hurry up and finish plates so they could add more to the table. The first 6 dishes were pushed on us within 17 min. I mean who eats that fast.  The waitress was standing at our table trying to get us to hurry or move stuff over to another plate. It was half empty and seemed unnecessary. \n\n4* the food was decent...nothing mind blowing BUT I might go back for the buttery fresh sashimi we tried as well as the regular rolls.", "author": "Sharra C."}

It's Monday so our favorite Chinese place is closed, and one of my children will only eat Chinese food from there. It's complicated. So we look at Japanese food. Arashi Sushi. Arashi means storm or tempest - usually with dark overtones. I had always been leery of it. It's like Tsunami Sushi - I don't care how good it is you don't name a place after a disaster.\n\nBut we needed to eat so I went to eat24 to order food. Menu looked good so we figured out what to get and placed our order, only to be told that it's CLOSED. Say what?\n\nSo I called. No, there were just busy and were only taking orders for themselves. I placed the order and before I had said ten words they said \"delivery will be 60-90 minutes\". Well you know what? I'm invested in this now so I said that I would come pick it up. I was willing to give up the parking space. \"30 minutes\"\n\nI got there in 20. The food was ready. Same price. 3 bags. We got the food home and dug in.\n\nI can't speak to the sushi. We didn't have any. My oldest had the Chicken Teriyaki. My youngest had the Chicken Don. My wife had the Katsu Don. I had the Ton Katsu. Yes, there was a pattern but so what. This is my review damn it.\n\nThe portions were generous. The taste was spot on - we eat a lot of Japanese food and this was solid stuff. We all cleaned our plates and had food left over. The Teriyaki sauce was the right balance of sweet and spicy, and the Katsu sauce was as good as any you could find in a Japanese market.\n\nWe fed 4 large people for just a hair over $50.00. We ate well, we enjoyed the experience, and we will order from them again. What else could you ask for?\n\nOh, and my parking space was still there we I got back home.

It was just okay.\n\nThere are a lot of items on the menu. We ended up getting the chef's special tacos, tuna sashimi, and a couple of rolls since we were trying to eat light. The flavors are pretty good, and the fish tasted fresh. I don't know, we've just had better I guess so nothing wow'd us. The best thing we tasted were probably the tacos.\n\nThe decor is drastically different from its predecessor - Rockin' Crawfish.

So i was really sad when I found out that they had moved to Oakland instead. Anyways my BF bought a Groupon for this place so we decided to eat here for dinner on a Saturday night and brought my mom too since she loves sushi. Keep in mind that parking in this area can be pretty difficult especially on the weekends so you just have to get lucky, which we did but only after circling around a few times. We got seated right away. The menu has a good amount of items on there to choose from and everything sounded pretty tasty. \n\nWe ordered 4 rolls and got complimentary edamame and miso soup. Our rolls came out shortly after we finished our soup. Portions of the rolls was pretty generous and each piece fit nicely into your mouth. Both my BF and I really enjoyed the Giant Roll, which we agreed was both of our favorite roll of the night. The Crunchy Lobster and the Sept Third Roll was just as good also and each roll was very flavorful and distinct in taste. We also got the Wagyu Roll, which doesn't contain any rice but was a little on the plain side for us. The sliced onions was a good compliment with the wagyu beef though. It was great that most of the rolls come with green onion and the orange fish eggs because they really give the rolls texture and flavor! Overall, we were pretty satisfied and was full after 4 rolls. My bf wants to come back again next time to order their real wasabi and some fresh sashimi. So we will be back! :)", "author": "Mary C."}

So when I get to arashi, I just tried their fresh fish directly. Do you know how much parasites ankimo(monkfish liver) contains before served? Black worms just coming out from those livers. Scary right? But tasty! Good Japanese restaurants serve ankimo because they don't care to pay the labor, but just for good food and good outcome. So arashi pass the first test. My favorites from them are also the salmon belly, hamachi belly and at last the walu(butterfish), they are all just amazing! Melts in you mouth with just a few bites.

The hiyashi tofu dish was cold, bland tasting cubes of tofu that fell apart easily. The tempura was good with the right about of crunchiness, but portion is a lot smaller than other places. The rolls that came with the order were also on the smaller side and the taste was okay. The spider roll could've been better and the Temptation roll wasn't very tempting.

Our dinner came with miso soup, a bowl of edamame, cold tofu (tasted like they just took a carton of tofu out of the fridge and poured some soy sauce on it), tempura that came with two broccolis, shrimp, and two green beans, two sushi rolls, and six pieces of sake sashimi. We chose a spider roll and one of their specialty rolls and they both only came with 4-5 pieces... The only good part was the sashimi (which they were not going to serve us until I showed her the groupon deal on my phone which listed all the item included).  The sake sashimi was served with some kind of sauce, sriracha, and a jalape\u00f1o. It wasn't like anything we've ever tried before.  Items on the menu were pretty pricey for the amount of food you get... And yes we left hungry. I guess for $26 it was ok, definitely not worth $53 tho.", "author": "Linz C."}

Also ordered the Sushi Regular (5pc with CA roll. Very reasonable price. Relatively large pieces of fish which were really fresh tasting.

The interior is quite small but provided a really warm atmosphere also the music  they play there is nice too. I went in yesterday with my boyfriend we had some beer to start off with. The service was amazing, our waitress kept checking in on us and quick to punch in our order, most importantly she was smiley and didn't rush us when it past their closing time. Anyways we ordered some uni nigiri, which was really fresh no bitter taste to it it was sweet. We also ordered the regular oysters and oyster shooters. Im an oyster fanatic and i just wanna say they have like the most perfect size oysters ever (cause i like them tiny) even my boyfriend who doesn't eat oysters much ate a lot that day. We ordered the plum salmon sashimi, tasted really unique cant describe it but its pretty amazing. Btw the food came out pretty fast so im glad. We decided to order some sake midway of our dinner, even though theyre almost about to close they still let me which is a double plus plus ! Anyways ordered two rolls and also the hamachi carpaccio. The rolls has a nice presentation tasted fine no rice or the filling falling out. Aside from the oysters the hamachi carpaccio is my favorite! It was so fresh, flavorful, and melty , absolutely my favorite. I am definitely coming back here next time with pictures taken!", "author": "Jenny L."}

Good luck understanding what to order from the menu. \n\nSince we didn't quite understand...\n\nWaitress was rude to my wife when ordering.\n\nThe edamame with garlic was super soggy. Tofu was decent, tempura was good. The sushi took FOREVER to come out. They clearly forgot about my nigiri I ordered as well as the salmon sashimi. 35 minutes into the appetizer, we're like 'where the hell is the real food?'\n\nManager comes in to apologize, I ask for our food. He comes back later and says 'sorry, out of the frozen Saba, would you like a fresh one?' I say ok, that takes another 10 minutes to serve? Why didn't they tell me ahead of time? One piece had wasabi underneath the Saba, the other did not..how odd. It was not good.\n\nThe waiter/manager even said he'll charge me normal price for fresh Saba nigiri..nope..10 Bucks my wife said afterwards..\n\nThey knew we were getting mad, so the waitress said 'dessert is free, I'll be right back' 15 minutes later, I had enough and walked out with my son while my wife stayed with the younger one. Horrific service.\n\nJust asked her (a day later) 'how was the free dessert?' She scoffed at me and said 'they never gave it to us!'\n\nShe had to walk out of the room to just ask for the check. Sad.\n\nOnly thing good was that we had a semi-private room facing Geary street. It was peaceful since both kids are so loud.\n\nOverall, HORRIBLE service, mediocre food.

Starting with the garlic edamame, nice change up.  The sushi was fresh and bursting with flavor. The spice tuna was not spicy enough but hey that is what Siracha sauce is for.  They had the best tempura ever.  Given my mother is from Japan and it is a household staple in my family, all tempura is common at best.  But theirs was magical.  Their ingredients fresh and cooked just right. Bravo.  5 stars is for perfection so I took it down 1.  Attentiveness was great, always filling water and taking dirty dishes away quickly.  But the table they seated us at needed to be cleaned when we sat down and food bits flew everywhere with the towel they used.  We asked for Sirach but they forgot so we had to go get it ourselves.

I dont understand why people think anyone can just open up a shitty sushi restaurant and expect people to pay a high price for horrible food. Arashi sushi house is another horrible addition to the cluster-fuck of bad restaurants in the richmond. The Gf and i ordered 5 dishes and each one were complete let down.  First off, the tako sunomono was just plain disgusting, it literally tasted like the frozen octopus you get at the asian super market ( im pretty sure it is from a shitty asian market ). The octopus was still frozen in the middle and the cucumbers we butchered in all different sizes which made it unpleasant to eat. There was almost no dressing so it just tasted like a frozen bland bowl of crap. The hamachi carpaccio was fishy and hard to stomach. The spider and hollywood was boring and plain. The sushi rice was mushy and tasteless. The mixed tempura's batter was hard and dense. i really dont know how and why this place has four and half stars on yelp, but im pretty sure as time goes on this place's rating will drop. And like the business that was previously there before, i wouldn't be surprised if this place closes its door for good within a year or two. I will never come back here and i advise anyone else thinking about trying this place not to come here.", "author": "R S."}
